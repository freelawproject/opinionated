EDWARDS, Circuit Judge:</author>\n<p id=\"b1337-9\">Charitable solicitation of Federal employees or military personnel at their workplaces or duty stations is conducted exclusively through an annual fund raising drive called the Combined Federal Campaign (the \u201cCFC\u201d or the \u201ccampaign\u201d). On February 10, 1983, the Government issued an executive order excluding legal defense funds from future participation in CFCs. <em>See </em>Exec.Order No. 12,404, 48 Fed.Reg. 6,685 (1983). The NAACP Legal Defense and Educational Fund, Inc. (\u201cNAACP LDF\u201d) and six other legal defense funds,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> all recognized by the Government as lawful charitable organizations, brought suit arguing that the decision to exclude them from the CFC violated their First and Fifth Amendment rights. The District Court agreed and, by summary judgment, permanently enjoined Donald Devine, Director of the Office of Personnel Management (\u201cOPM\u201d), from excluding the appellees from participating in CFCs on the basis of Executive Order 12,404.</p>\n<p id=\"b1337-10\">Because we find the exclusion of LDFs from the CFC to be patently capricious and unreasonable, we agree with the result reached by the District Court. We therefore affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b1337-15\">I. Background</p>\n<p id=\"b1337-16\">A. <em>The Combined Federal Campaign</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1337-17\">As the appellant has previously acknowledged, \u201c[i]t has been long-standing policy of the Federal Government to cooperate with and assist voluntary health and welfare agencies in soliciting funds for worthy causes from Federal personnel.\u201d Memorandum from Donald J. Devine to David A. Stock-man 1 (Oct. 22, 1981) (hereinafter \u201cDevine Memo II\u201d), <em>reprinted in </em>I Joint Appendix 70 (hereinafter \u201cJ.A.\u201d). Prior to the creation of the CFC, this policy was implemented essentially in an ad hoc manner: \u201c[t]he heads of some Federal facilities permitted no solicitations whatsoever; at other Federal worksites, no restrictions were imposed, and it was not uncommon for a collection to be taken up each week on behalf of one charity or another.\u201d <em>Hearings Before the Subcomm. on Manpower and Housing of the House Comm, on Governmental Operations </em>29 (1983) (statement of Donald J. De-vine) (hereinafter \u201cDevine testimony\u201d), <em>reprinted in </em>II J.A. 397.</p>\n<p id=\"b1337-18\">The early haphazard approaches to solicitations for charitable causes proved to be largely unsatisfactory. Charities \u201ccould not understand why they were allowed to solicit in some Federal establishments and not in others, nor did they appreciate the fact that some charities seemed to have the support of Federal management\u201d while others did not. <em>Id. </em>Federal employees were sometimes confused or upset at being subjected to repeated solicitations. <em>Id. </em>The situation created an \u201cintolerable administrative burden for Federal officials,\u201d Devine Memo II, <em>supra, </em>at 1, <em>reprinted in </em>I J.A. 70, as well as \u201can increasingly chaotic situation in Federal offices.\u201d Memorandum from Donald J. De-vine to Craig L. Fuller 2 (Feb. 2, 1983) (hereinafter \u201cDevine Memo III\u201d), <em>reprinted in </em>I J.A. 107.</p>\n<p id=\"b1337-19\">In 1961, \u201cin order to control and simplify the process of charitable solicitation in the Federal workplace,\u201d President Kennedy <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1250\">*1250</page-number>created the CFC. <em>Id. </em>He \u201cdirected that all ad hoc solicitations be ended, and that worthy charities be permitted to solicit in the Federal workplace through a single, annual drive combining all participating [charitable] agencies.\u201d Devine testimony, <em>supra, </em>at 29-30, <em>reprinted in </em>II J.A. 397-98. To implement this plan, President Kennedy issued Executive Order 10,927, instructing that arrangements be made \u201cfor such national voluntary health and welfare agencies and such other national voluntary agencies as may be appropriate to solicit funds from Federal employees and members of the armed forces at their places of employment or duty stations.\u201d Exec.Order No. 10,927, \u00a7 2(a), 3 C.F.R. 454 (1959-1963 Compilation).</p>\n<p id=\"b1338-4\">The mechanics of the CFC have been described at length in other judicial opinions, <em>see NAACP Legal Defense and Educational Fund, Inc. v. Devine, </em>560 F.Supp. 667 (D.D.C.1983) <em>(\u201cNAACP LDF II\u201d); NAACP Legal Defense and Educational Fund, Inc. v. Campbell, </em>504 F.Supp. 1365 (D.D.C.1981) <em>(\u201cNAACP I\u201d); </em>therefore, we will highlight only those features that are necessary to understand the dispute at hand. The CFC is governed by the Director of the OPM, who makes all \u201cbasic policy, procedural, and eligibility decisions for the program.\u201d 5 C.F.R. \u00a7 950.201(a) (1983). Normally, there is bifurcated responsibility for the CFC drive in each participating locality. A designated private voluntary organization (the \u201cPrincipal Combined Fund Organization\u201d or \u201cPCFO\u201d) \u201cwill raise money from Federal employees and administer the local campaign.\u201d <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 950.211(e). A local Federal coordinating committee oversees the PCFO, and is authorized to make decisions regarding administration of the local campaign (subject to those constraints imposed by the Director). <em>Id. </em>\u00a7\u00a7 950.211(a), 950.509. The PCFO is reimbursed for its administrative expenses from the funds raised for the participating charities. <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 950.509(e); appellant\u2019s brief, p. 13.</p>\n<p id=\"b1338-7\">Each local campaign consists of a \u201csingle, annual drive,\u201d conducted in the fall. 5 C.F.R. \u00a7 950.103(b), (c) (1983). The Federal agencies involved conduct their \u201cown solicitation among [their] employees, using campaign materials, supplies, and speakers furnished by or through\u201d the PCFO. <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 950.103(d). Federal employees are encouraged to participate in this and other CFC responsibilities undertaken by the Federal Government \u201cto the extent consistent with Federal agency policy and prudent use of official time. They are encouraged also to devote private time to such volunteer work.\u201d <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 950.105.</p>\n<p id=\"b1338-8\">An information leaflet is distributed to each potential contributor. <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 950.521(c). This leaflet is printed and supplied by the PCFO, <em>id. </em>\u00a7 950.521(a), and is accompanied by a brochure listing each charity (or \u201cvoluntary agency\u201d) approved for participation in the campaign and providing \u201ca brief statement of about 30 words on [each charity\u2019s] programs.\u201d <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 950.521(e)(2)(i). The content of this statement is provided by the participating charities and/or the PCFO, subject to approval of the local Federal coordinating committee.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1338-9\">Federal employees who choose to contribute can either (1) designate specific participating charities for receipt of the contribution or (2) make undesignated contributions. Undesignated contributions are pooled and deemed designated to the local PCFO, <em>id. </em>\u00a7 950.513(a), which can then distribute the funds \u201cto any participant in the local CFC.\u201d 47 Fed.Reg. 29,497 (1982).</p>\n<p id=\"b1338-10\">B. <em>Exclusion of Legal Defense Funds From the CFC</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1338-11\">In 1980, the NAACP LDF and the Puerto Rican Legal Defense and Education Fund, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1251\">*1251</page-number>Inc. (\u201cPR LDF\u201d) applied to participate in the CFC, but the Government refused this request, arguing that these LDFs did not provide <em>direct services </em>to persons in the fields of health and welfare services. <em>See </em>Appellant\u2019s brief, p. 6.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> This exclusion was challenged in <em>NAACP I, </em>where the District Court agreed with the plaintiffs that the \u201cdirect services\u201d requirement did \u201cnot have the precision necessary to comport with [the First Amendment\u2019s] requirements.\u201d 504 F.Supp. at 1368. The court also challenged the suggestion that the plaintiffs did not provide direct services to the needy, pointing out that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1339-4\">The record is replete with the results of plaintiffs\u2019 work, indicating that law suits by plaintiffs have provided millions of dollars in back pay and benefits, and invaluable other \u201cservices\u201d such as increased training opportunities, additional promotions, improved school programs, and better hospital facilities. Apart from their litigation activities, each plaintiff also provides \u201cdirect services\u201d through scholarship programs and education efforts.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1339-5\">Id.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> The court enjoined the defendant from using the direct services requirement as a basis for rejecting pending or future applications from the plaintiffs, and encouraged the \u201cgovernment officials responsible for the program to re-examine the basic premises on which [the CFC] was established so that more acceptable standards [could] be developed.\u201d Id. at 1369.</p>\n<p id=\"b1339-6\">In June 1981, the appellant circulated a memorandum discussing the <em>NAACP I </em>opinion and eligibility for the 1981 CFC. <em>See </em>Memorandum from Donald J. Devine to Department and Agency Fund-Raising Program Coordinators and Chairmen, Field Coordinating Groups (June 9, 1981) (hereinafter \u201cDevine Memo I\u201d), <em>reprinted in </em>I J.A. 52. In his review of so-called \u201cborderline cases,\u201d Devine explained that while the imprecision of the \u201cdirect services\u201d requirement had made it constitutionally infirm, he nevertheless found \u201csome merit in the argument that these [legal defense funds do] not fall under Executive Order 10927.\u201d Despite the decision in <em>NAACP I, </em>Devine also persisted in contending that there is \u201clogic to the direct vs. indirect services distinction.\u201d On this point, Devine argued that \u201c[t]he difficulty is that the Manual does not define either of these criteria with the specificity required by the Court.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 4, I J.A. 55.</p>\n<p id=\"b1339-10\">Because more precise definitions had yet to be formulated, the memorandum concluded that the legal defense funds \u201cmust be allowed to participate in the present campaign,\u201d but added that this question was \u201camong those that will be reviewed for the next campaign.\u201d <em>Id. </em>The memorandum also reported that \u201cserious procedural questions have been raised regarding the eligibility\u201d of the Planned Parenthood World-Population organization, but determined that \u201cthe facts presented are in doubt.\u201d <em>Id. </em>In discussing his decisions for the 1981 campaign, Devine offered that he had \u201ccome to the reluctant conclusion ... [that] it is probably too late in the planning process to make the wholesale revisions which are necessary\u201d to bring the regulations \u201cmore in accord with the precision required by the First Amendment.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 3,1 J.A. 54. Adequate standards would, he assured, be promulgated for the 1982 campaign. Id. at 5,1 J.A. 56.</p>\n<p id=\"b1339-11\">In October 1981, the appellant sent a memorandum to David Stockman, the Director of the Office of Management and Budget. Devine Memo II, supra, <em>reprinted in </em>I J.A. 70. The subject of this memorandum was a proposed new executive order which, among other things, provided that to be eligible for the CFC, an organization <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1252\">*1252</page-number>could \u201cnot seek to influence ... the determination of public policy ... by litigating public policy in any court on behalf of any person other than itself.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 9, I J.A. 78. The appellant argued that unless this and other proposed eligibility restrictions were adopted:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1340-4\">[T]he inevitable result will be mandatory admission to the Combined Federal Campaign of a multitude of organizations whose programs, whatever their benefit in other ways, are considered less critical to the national interest than those directed at common human needs in the areas of health and welfare. Furnishing Federal administrative effort and indirect support to obtain contributions for programs of lower priority would clearly conflict with the thrust of the President\u2019s budget decisions to accord priority of Federal support to vital health and welfare programs.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1340-5\"><em>Id. </em>at 3,1 J.A. 72.</p>\n<p id=\"b1340-6\">The proposed executive order was not adopted prior to the 1982 campaign. Instead, on March 23, 1982, Executive Order 12,353 was issued, revoking Executive Order 10,927, but retaining its general eligibility standard allowing \u201cappropriate\u201d national voluntary agencies to participate in the CFC. Exec.Order No. 12,353, \u00a7\u00a7 1, 9, 3 C.F.R. 139-40 (1982 Compilation). Pursuant to authority granted under the new executive order, the appellant promulgated comprehensive regulations to govern the 1982 campaign. These regulations defined \u201cnational voluntary health and welfare agencies and such other national voluntary agencies as may be appropriate\u201d in language that clearly included LDFs.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> 5 C.F.R. \u00a7 950.101(a)(2), (3)(vii) (1983).<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1340-14\">Despite this official stance, there is no indication in the record that the appellant\u2019s opposition to LDF participation in the CFC, as expressed in the June and October 1981 memoranda, ever waivered. Indeed, the appellant has contended that LDFs were admitted into the CFC in 1981 and 1982 \u201cwith the hope of reducing the potential for further litigation.\u201d Devine testimony, <em>supra, </em>at 32, <em>reprinted in </em>II J.A. 400. <em>See also </em>Devine Memo III, at 7, <em>reprinted in 1 </em>J.A. 112 (indicating that \u201clitigation is highly likely\u201d to result from executive order excluding LDFs). On February 2, 1983, a memorandum from the appellant to Craig Fuller, Assistant to the President for Cabinet Affairs, implied that inclusion of LDFs in the CFC had been viewed as an impermanent approach, <em>id. </em>at 3-^4, I J.A. 108-09, and argued that exclusion of LDFs was \u201curgently required.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 8, I J.A. 113. This memorandum included a draft executive order which incorporated almost verbatim the appellant\u2019s October 1981 proposal to exclude LDFs. <em>Id. </em>at 9, I J.A. 114.</p>\n<p id=\"b1340-15\">The February 2, 1983 memorandum offered somewhat different justifications for the proposed exclusions than those that had been voiced previously. First, it was claimed that \u201c[mjany employees objected\u201d to inclusion of \u2014 in the appellant\u2019s words\u2014 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1253\">*1253</page-number>\u201caggressive and controversial political and legal advocacy\u201d groups. <em>Id. </em>at 4, 5, I J.A. 109, 110. He explained that \u201c[s]everal unions organized boycotts of the CFC because of the participation of such groups as the Right to Work Legal Defense Fund.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 4,1 J.A. 109. The appellant argued that these protests jeopardized the CFC\u2019s fund-raising objective, <em>id., </em>and later warned that unless the campaign was reformed \u201cdevastating\u201d employee boycotts \u201cwould bring the life of the Campaign to an end.\u201d Devine testimony, supra, at 6, <em>reprinted in </em>II J.A. 388. Second, the exclusion was justified by the impropriety of the Government\u2019s use of \u201ctaxpayer resources to raise funds for advocacy organizations and political education groups, however worthy or sympathetic may be their causes.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 4-5, I J.A. 109-10. Finally, the appellant argued that because it was \u201cbecoming increasingly difficult to draw any lines and keep participation to a manageable number of organizations\u201d the President had directed that the CFC be limited to \u201ctraditional health and welfare agencies.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 5, I J.A. 110.</p>\n<p id=\"b1341-4\">One week later, Executive Order 12,404 was issued. It enumerated the objectives of the CFC<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> and established new eligibility criteria. The new criteria are both inclu-sionary and exclusionary. The inclusionary provision specifies that participation in the CFC is limited to organizations that are considered \u201cvoluntary, charitable, health and welfare agencies,\u201d and details at some length what this phrase encompasses.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> The exclusionary provision stipulates that \u201c[ajgencies that seek to influence the outcomes of elections or the determination of public policy through political activity or advocacy, lobbying, or litigation on behalf of parties other than themselves shall not be deemed ... eligible to participate\u201d in the CFC. Exec.Order No. 12,404, \u00a7 1(b), 48 Fed.Reg. 6,685 (1983).</p>\n<p id=\"b1341-10\">C. <em>The District Court Proceedings</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1341-11\">Shortly after issuance of Executive Order 12,404, the appellees brought suit arguing that the order unconstitutionally excludes them from the CFC. The appellees relied on the First Amendment, and their right to equal protection under the law, and requested that the appellant be enjoined from excluding the appellees from the campaign.</p>\n<p id=\"b1341-12\">In analyzing the appellees\u2019 claims, the District Court carefully distinguished between the appellees\u2019 interests in designated and undesignated contributions. The court held that when soliciting <em>designated </em>contributions \u201can organization seeks to persuade an employee to make a donation to that organization,\u201d and Government restrictions on this solicitation are constrained by the First Amendment. <em>NAACP Legal Defense and Educational Fund, Inc. v. Devine, </em>567 F.Supp. 401, 406 (D.D.C.1983) <em>(\u201cNAACP III\"). </em>In contrast, control over the distri<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1254\">*1254</page-number>bution of <em>undesignated </em>contributions is yielded to the CPC; such contributions are dedicated to the public good, and are not a response to the appeal of particular organizations. The lower court thus concluded that First Amendment rights are not implicated by restrictions on the distribution of undesignated contributions; such restrictions are \u201cmore properly the subject of an equal protection analysis.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Finding that the appellees\u2019 equal protection claim regarding undesignated contributions was not ripe, the lower court dismissed this portion of the appellees\u2019 suit. This dismissal is not appealed.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1342-4\">However, the court held that excluding LDFs from the designated contribution portion of the CFC was unconstitutional. This decision- was predicated on the court\u2019s finding that the CFC was a limited public forum. It reasoned that the CFC \u201cpermits numerous charitable organizations to present their messages to federal employees,\u201d <em>id., </em>and \u201c \u2018the government has, in effect, provided a billboard or channel of communication through which organizations can disseminate their appeals to federal workers.\u2019 \u201d 567 F.Supp. at 407 (quoting <em>NAACP I, </em>504 F.Supp. at 1367). Moreover, because \u201cExecutive Order 10927 made no differentiation among charitable organizations on the basis of how they accomplish their objectives,\u201d the court held that the appellees did \u201cfall within the limits of that forum as it historically has existed.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1342-5\">The court then considered, and agreed with, the appellees\u2019 claim that the exclusion of LDFs from the CFC was a content-based prohibition on speech, which would only be justified by a compelling state interest. It reasoned that as the protected expression \u201cin an act of charitable solicitation is a request for contributions, the \u2018content\u2019 of that expression is the accompanying statement of how those contributions will be used. It is this \u2018content\u2019 that has, according to defendant, engendered such controversy among potential contributors as to warrant the exclusion based thereupon.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Finding that there was no compelling state interest to support the Government\u2019s position, the court enjoined the appellant from using Executive Order 12,404 to exclude legal defense funds from participating in CFCs. In particular, the court held that the Government\u2019s interest in excluding allegedly controversial groups from the forum was \u201can <em>impermissible </em>basis for a restriction upon speech.\u201d 567 F.Supp. at 408.</p>\n<p id=\"b1342-10\">II. Discussion</p>\n<p id=\"b1342-11\">A. <em>First Amendment Restrictions on Government Regulation of Access to the CFC</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1342-12\">Charitable solicitation indisputably involves speech interests \u201cthat are within the protection of the First Amendment.\u201d <em>Village of Schaumburg v. Citizens for a Better Environment, </em>444 U.S. 620, 632, 100 S.Ct. 826, 833, 63 L.Ed.2d 73 (1980). <em>See also Heffron v. International Society for Krishna Consciousness, Inc., </em>452 U.S. 640, 647, 101 S.Ct. 2559, 2563, 69 L.Ed.2d 298 (1981); <em>National Black United Fund, Inc. v. Devine, </em>667 F.2d 173, 178 (D.C.Cir.1981). While conceding this general proposition, the appellant posits that the CFC does not involve solicitation by the participating charities, and is more accurately described as a \u201csubsidy\u201d by the Federal Government. The appellant then argues that the Government\u2019s decision to restrict this subsidy to certain charities does \u201cnot implicate the First Amendment.\u201d Appellant\u2019s brief, p. 25.</p>\n<p id=\"b1342-13\">The appellant\u2019s description of the nature of the CFC flies in the face of uniform, and unequivocal, Government characterizations of the campaign over the past 20 years. In 1961, Executive Order 10,927 directed that arrangements be made for charitable organizations to \u201csolicit funds\u201d from Government employees, Exec. Order No. 10,927, \u00a7 2(a), 3 C.F.R. 454 (1959-1963 Compilation), and the two sub<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1255\">*1255</page-number>sequent executive orders have contained similar mandates. <em>See </em>Exec.Order No. 12,-404, \u00a7 1(a), 48 Fed.Reg. 6,685 (1983) (Director \u201cshall make arrangements for voluntary health and welfare agencies to solicit contributions from Federal employees ... at their places of employment or duty.\u201d); Exec.Order No. 12,353, \u00a7 1, 3 C.F.R. 139 (1982 Compilation) (same). The appellant has testified that President Kennedy\u2019s directive was \u201cthat worthy charities be permitted to solicit in the Federal workplace,\u201d Devine testimony, <em>supra, </em>at 3, <em>reprinted in </em>II J.A. 385, and even in this litigation, he has acknowledged that the CFC \u201cpermits traditional health and welfare charities to make a strictly limited appeal in the federal workplace.\u201d Defendant\u2019s Memorandum of Points and Authorities in Opposition to Plaintiffs\u2019 Motion for Summary Judgment, p. 40, <em>NAACP III, </em>567 F.Supp. 401 (D.D.C.1983).</p>\n<p id=\"b1343-5\">This uniform characterization of the CFC as permitting charities to solicit is entirely consistent with the long-standing practices followed under the program. The Government has understandably imposed time, place, and manner restrictions to prevent disruption of its facilities by solicitation through the CFC. These restrictions have never been viewed as depriving the permitted solicitation of <em>any </em>First Amendment protections, and they surely have not converted \u201csolicitations\u201d into \u201csubsidies.\u201d The CFC remains a limited, but critical, opportunity for charitable organizations to prepare and \u2014 with the support of the Government \u2014 disseminate their message to Federal employees. <em>See National Black United Fund, Inc., </em>667 F.2d at 179 (\u201cThe CFC clearly provides <em>some </em>charities with a substantial opportunity to publicize their views ....\u201d) (footnote omitted). In reaching this conclusion, which is in accord with the position taken by the lower court and every other court that has considered the question, we are adhering to the view we expressed in <em>National Black United Fund, Inc.</em><footnotemark><em>10</em></footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1343-8\">Because this case involves restrictions on First Amendment activity, it presents an entirely different question than that decided in the case cited by the appellant, <em>Regan v. Taxation With </em>Representation, -- U.S. --, 103 S.Ct. 1997, 76 L.Ed.2d 129 (1983). In <em>Taxation With Representation, </em>the Court upheld a statute granting a tax exemption to certain nonprofit organizations that did not engage in substantial lobbying activities. In ruling that the First Amendment did not require Congress to extend this subsidy to the plaintiff\u2019s lobbying activities, the Court expressly pointed out that \u201c[i]n this case ... Congress has not infringed any First Amendment rights or regulated any First Amendment activity.\u201d 103 S.Ct. at 2001.</p>\n<p id=\"b1343-12\">Although it is obvious that the CFC does involve a minor element of \u201csubsidization,\u201d it is equally clear that the CFC also involves the regulation of important First Amendment activity. While we are in agreement with the District Court\u2019s finding that the Government has undertaken a role in the CFC so that it can most effectively regulate, rather than subsidize, charitable solicitation of Federal employees, <em>see NAACP III, </em>567 F.Supp. at 408, we need not reexamine this determination here. For even if <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1256\">*1256</page-number>we accepted the appellant\u2019s contention that subsidization is one purpose of the CFC, it is clear that this would not insulate the campaign from the commands of the First Amendment. Permitting public speech on Government property, in Government facilities, or in a forum such as the CFC, will often involve some quantum of Government subsidization, and yet there has never been the faintest suggestion in the case law that at some indeterminate level this causes the strictures of the First Amendment to dissipate. <em>See Perry Education Association v. Perry Local Educators\u2019 Association, </em>-- U.S. --, 103 S.Ct. 948, 74 L.Ed.2d 794 (1983) (use of intraschool mailing system); <em>Widmar v. Vincent, </em>454 U.S. 263, 102 S.Ct. 269, 70 L.Ed.2d 440 (1981) (use of university facilities); <em>Southeastern Promotions, Ltd. v. Conrad, </em>420 U.S. 546, 95 S.Ct. 1239, 43 L.Ed.2d 448 (1975) (use of public auditorium). While the costs incurred by the Government can certainly be relevant to the Government\u2019s interest in regulating access to public property for First Amendment activities, the Government\u2019s decision to incur such costs surely does not entirely remove such regulation from the purview of the First Amendment.</p>\n<p id=\"b1344-7\">While we reject the appellant\u2019s claim that the First Amendment is not even implicated in this case, we also recognize that \u201cthe First Amendment does not guarantee access to property simply because it is owned or controlled by the government.\u201d <em>United States Postal Service v. Council of Greenburgh Civic Associations, </em>453 U.S. 114, 129, 101 S.Ct. 2676, 2685, 69 L.Ed.2d 517 (1981). As the Supreme Court has often indicated, \u201cthe State, no less than a private owner of property, has power to preserve the property under its control for the use to which it is lawfully dedicated.\u201d <em>E.g., id. </em>In determining the degree of protection afforded by the First Amendment in this case, we are governed by the test articulated in <em>Perry Education </em>Association, \u2014 U.S. \u2014, 103 S.Ct. 948, 74 L.Ed.2d 794 (1983). <em>See generally </em>Cass, <em>First Amendment Access to Government Facilities, </em>65 Va.L.Rev. 1287 (1979); Kalven, <em>The Concept of the Public Forum: Cox v. Louisiana, </em>1965 Sup.Ct.Rev. 1; Stone, <em>Fora Americana: Speech in Public Places, </em>1974 Sup.Ct.Rev. 233; Note, <em>A Unitary Approach to Claims of First Amendment Access to Publicly Owned Property, </em>35 Stan.L.Rev. 121 (1982).</p>\n<p id=\"b1344-10\">In <em>Perry, </em>the Court considered a rival union\u2019s challenge to a collective bargaining provision between a school district and the teachers\u2019 exclusive bargaining representative. The provision stipulated that the bargaining representative, but no other union, would have access to the interschool mail system and teacher mailboxes in the district\u2019s schools. In evaluating the rival union\u2019s claim that this restriction violated its First Amendment rights, the Court distinguished three types of public property:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1344-11\">(1) <em>Traditional Public Forums. </em>\u201cAt one end of the spectrum\u201d is property such as streets and parks, which by tradition has \u201c \u2018been held in trust for the use of the public, and, time out of mind, [has] been used for purposes of assembly, communicating thoughts between citizens, and discussing public questions.\u2019 \u201d 103 S.Ct. at 954-55 (quoting <em>Hague v. Committee for Industrial Organization, </em>307 U.S. 496, 515 [59 S.Ct. 954, 964, 83 L.Ed. 1423] (1939)). In these forums, communicative activity cannot be entirely prohibited, and content-based exclusions will be sustained only if the Government shows they are necessary to serve a compelling state interest and are narrowly drawn to achieve that end. <em>Id. </em>[103 S.Ct.] at 955. Content-neutral regulations of time, place, and manner of expression can also be enforced if they are narrowly tailored to serve a significant Government interest, and if ample alternative channels of communication are left open. <em>Id.</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1344-12\">(2) <em>Limited Public Forums. </em>Public property \u201cwhich the state has opened for use by the public as a place for expressive activity,\u201d <em>id., </em>may constitute a limited public forum. Although the state may not have been required to create this forum originally, and \u201cis not required to indefinitely retain the open character of the facility, as long as it does so it is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1257\">*1257</page-number>bound by the same standards as apply in a traditional public forum.\u201d <em>Id.</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1345-4\">(3) <em>Public Property that is Neither a Traditional Nor a Limited Public Forum. </em>\u201cPublic property which is not by tradition or designation a forum for public communication is governed by different standards.\u201d <em>Id. </em>On this property, the Government may impose time, place, and manner regulations, and also \u201cmay reserve the forum for its intended purposes, communicative or otherwise, as long as the regulation on speech is reasonable and not an effort to suppress expression merely because public officials oppose the speaker\u2019s view.\u201d <em>Id.</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1345-5\">In applying this tripartite analysis to the facts in <em>Perry, </em>the Court held that the school mail facilities fell within the third (nonpublic forum) category. <em>Id. </em>The Court explained that there was no evidence indicating that permission had been granted \u201cas a matter of course\u201d to all who sought to distribute material; although selective access had been permitted to groups \u201csuch as the YMCA, Cub Scouts, and other civic and church organizations,\u201d this was not sufficient to \u201ctransform government property into a public forum.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 956. Independently, the Court held that even assuming that this selective access had transformed the property into a limited public forum, the constitutional right of access would \u201cextend only to other entities of similar character.\u201d As the purposes of the rival union\u2019s communications were entirely different than those of the civic organizations that had been permitted access, the rival union was not encompassed by the limited forum. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1345-8\">In the instant case, the parties have debated at length the correctness of the lower court\u2019s holding that the CFC is a \u201climited public forum.\u201d In our view it is unnecessary to decide this question. Even in forums falling within the third (nonpublic forum) category identified in <em>Perry, </em>the First Amendment imposes constraints on the Government\u2019s right to allow access to some speakers while denying it to others. \u201cThe touchstone for evaluating\u201d a differential access policy by the Government is whether the distinctions relied on by the Government \u201care reasonable in light of the purpose which the forum at issue serves.\u201d <em>Perry, </em>103 S.Ct. at 957 (footnote omitted). Because our subsequent discussion reveals that the exclusion of LDFs does not satisfy this reasonableness standard, we do not decide whether the test used in cases involving limited public forums is applicable.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1345-9\">B. <em>Application of the Reasonableness Test to Differential Treatment of Like Speakers</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1345-10\">In <em>Perry, </em>the Supreme Court held that the school district\u2019s differential access policy satisfied the reasonableness standard applicable to public property falling within the third (nonpublic forum) category. In reaching this conclusion, the Court emphasized that the district\u2019s differential access policy was \u201cbased on the <em>status </em>of the respective unions rather than their views.\u201d 103 S.Ct. at 957. The Court explained that a bargaining representative \u201chas official duties as representative [of the district\u2019s] teachers.\u201d Id. at 958 n. 10. Use of the school mail facilities enabled the bargaining representative to perform these duties effectively. Id. at 958. In essence then, the district had simply restricted use of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1258\">*1258</page-number>mail system \u201cto those who participate^] in the forum\u2019s official business,\u201d <em>id. </em>at 959 (footnote omitted) \u2014 a restriction that was permissible \u201cwithout further justification.\u201d <em>Id. </em>The Court also found that the exclusion of a rival union was reasonable because of the need to insure \u201clabor-peace within the schools,\u201d <em>id. </em>(footnote omitted), and because \u201csubstantial alternative channels [remained] open for union-teacher communication to take place.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Finally, the Court considered, but ultimately rejected, the rival union\u2019s suggestion that the district\u2019s policy was overinclusive and underinclusive. <em>Id. </em>at 959 n. 13.</p>\n<p id=\"b1346-4\">In this case, we also must evaluate a differential access policy adopted by the Government. While the Government has granted hundreds of charities access to the CFC, the Government has expressly denied access to the appellees and other LDFs. In one essential respect, however, this case is strikingly different from <em>Perry: </em>there is no discernible difference in the <em>status </em>of the appellees and that of the organizations which have been permitted access to the CFC.</p>\n<p id=\"b1346-5\">In contrast to <em>Perry, </em>this is not a case in which access has been restricted to those engaged in the forum\u2019s official business\u2014 both the included charities and the appellees wish to engage in charitable solicitation through the CFC. Aside from this obvious equivalence, there are other manifest and substantial similarities between the included charities and the appellees. Like the included charities, the appellees are charitable organizations within the meaning of section 501(c)(3) of the tax code. 26 U.S.C. \u00a7 501(c)(3) (1976). It is also undisputed that the appellees are not engaged in political activities which are inconsistent with this charitable status. <em>See generally id.; </em>26 C.F.R. \u00a7 1.501(c)(3)-1(c)(3) (1983). Equally clear is the fact that the appellees and the included charities share the traits that have traditionally been considered critical in determining eligibility for the CFC: all provide and support \u201cdirect health and welfare services.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1346-6\">In <em>NAAGP I, </em>the court held that an attempt to exclude two of the appellees from the CFC on the ground that they did not provide \u201cdirect services\u201d was constitutionally infirm. By the same token, it cannot seriously be argued that the appellees do not \u201cprovide or support direct health and welfare services to individuals or their families\u201d within the meaning of Executive Order 12,404. The appellees provide and support such services by furnishing legal assistance, by seeking judicial enforcement of the common law, statutory and constitutional rights of their clients, and by obtaining health and welfare benefits for the needy. Indeed, because the Government has included groups such as the National Parks and Conservation Association, the United States Olympic Committee, the Wilderness Society and the National Recreation and Park Association in the CFC, <em>see </em>Memorandum from Donald J. Devine to Chairmen and Chairwomen, Federal Coordinating Committees, National Voluntary Agencies, and Federated Groups 4 (Aug. 20, 1982), <em>reprinted in </em>II J.A. 551, a strong argument can be made that the appellees more closely comport with the standard established by the Government than do some of the included charities. In short, both in terms of their longstanding treatment under the tax code, and the parameters of the CFC as it has traditionally been understood, the status of the appellees and the included charities is virtually identical.</p>\n<p id=\"b1346-7\">The Government\u2019s decision in 1983 to add an exclusionary clause to bar LDFs from the CFC obviously does not affect this conclusion. If the LDFs are generally of the type included in the campaign \u2014 and the preceding analysis indicates that they are\u2014 the Government cannot simply manufacture a difference in status by adding a specific exclusionary clause. Were this not the case, any charity could gain a \u201cdifferent\u201d status from the others \u2014 regardless of their substantive similarities \u2014 for each is susceptible to categorization within a class of charities <em>(e.g., </em>organizations providing food aid; organizations studying cancer) that could be targeted for exclusion by the Government.</p>\n<p id=\"b1347-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1259\">*1259</page-number>The similarities between the appellees and the included charities make the Government\u2019s differential access policy in this case far more troublesome than the policy considered in <em>Perry. </em>By permitting hundreds of charities to solicit through the CFC, the Government has plainly evidenced its view that such solicitation is not antagonistic to its interests nor inconsistent with the normal activities in the Federal workplace. On the contrary, it is clear that the Government views this charitable solicitation as highly worthwhile. Nevertheless, the Government has also chosen to forbid the same solicitations by similarly situated charities. Such differential treatment of like entities raises the serious possibility that a speaker, or class of speakers, has been excluded from a forum, not in furtherance of a legitimate interest of the Government, but instead simply because the speaker has been viewed disfavorably by the Government. Cf. Karst, <em>Equality as a Central Principle in the First Amendment, </em>43 U.Chi.L.Rev. 20, 36-41 (1975) (discussing \u201chidden\u201d techniques for content discrimination in public forums).</p>\n<p id=\"b1347-4\">The factual distinction between this case and <em>Perry </em>therefore makes it essential that we examine with some care the Government\u2019s claim that its differential access policy satisfies the requirement of reasonableness established by <em>Perry.</em><footnotemark><em>12</em></footnotemark><em> </em>In assessing the reasonableness of differential treatment of similarly situated speakers, we must consider whether the Government\u2019s discriminatory policy is related to, and in furtherance of, a legitimate Government interest, and whether the asserted interest adequately explains why some speakers have been permitted access, while others have been denied it. We must also be circumspect in evaluating conclusory statements by Government officials which do not comport with either the evidence in the record or common sense. In undertaking this review, we emphasize the narrow scope of our holding: the inquiry that we have delineated is demanded by the similarities between the included and excluded charities in this case; we in no way suggest that this inquiry is appropriate in situations, such as that reviewed in <em>Perry, </em>which involve differential treatment of speakers who are not similarly situated.</p>\n<p id=\"b1347-7\">C. <em>The Unreasonableness of Excluding LDFs From the CFC</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1347-8\">One point that is noteworthy about the Government\u2019s opposition to the inclusion of LDFs in the CFC is that the official explanations for this opposition have vacillated substantially over the past three years. Although this vacillation may be cause for suspicion, we nonetheless' have accepted the various explanations at face value and have carefully considered each asserted justification for the Government\u2019s differential treatment of similarly situated charities in this case. Pursuant to this examination, we conclude that none of the Government\u2019s explanations satisfy the reasonableness test explicated in <em>Perry.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1347-9\">1. <em>Assistance to the Needy</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1347-10\">The justification most consistently offered by the Government is its claim that exclusion of LDFs is a critical means of restricting participation in the CFC to \u201cthose charities which assist those who are most in need.\u201d Appellant\u2019s brief, p. 32. However, the appellant\u2019s suggestion that access to the CFC is somehow restricted to organizations whose programs \u201care aimed directly at the needs of the poor, the infirm, the hungry, and the truly needy,\u201d Office of Personnel Management News Release 1 (Feb. 10, 1983), <em>reprinted in </em>I J.A. 25, is patently ludicrous in view of the wide range of organizations included in the CFC. Although the programs of organizations like the United States Olympic Committee may be laudable, the Government certainly cannot explain the inclusion of such organizations and the exclusion of LDFs on this ground. Indeed, in defending Executive Order 12,404, the appellant told a congressional committee that \u201csports associations\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1260\">*1260</page-number>and \u201crecreation societies\u201d had never been considered appropriate for inclusion in the CFC because \u201cthey were not engaged in supplying health and welfare services directly to human beings who were ill, infirm, poor, or distressed.\u201d Devine testimony, <em>supra, </em>at 30-81, <em>reprinted in </em>II J.A. 398-99.</p>\n<p id=\"b1348-4\">In contrast to the activities of some organizations that the appellant ultimately <em>did </em>include in the CFC, the undisputed evidence in the record reveals that as a result of the NAACP LDF\u2019s litigation efforts, primarily on behalf of low income blacks, \u201chundreds of thousands of persons have received direct benefits, such as income supplementation in the form of back pay and future earnings, better educations, improved health care, better housing and other living conditions, humane conditions of incarceration and, in the case of our capital punishment program, life itself.\u201d Affidavit of Jack Greenberg, Director-Counsel of the NAACP LDF 6 (Nov. 25,1980), <em>reprinted in </em>I J.A. 130.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1348-5\">2. <em>Political Advocacy</em></p>\n<p id=\"asm-dedup-0\">The appellant has also argued that exclusion of LDFs from the CFC is necessary because they are political advocacy groups, and the Government has a legitimate interest in avoiding the appearance of Federal support for such groups. Appellant\u2019s brief, p. 36. While we agree that this is a legitimate interest, it is not advanced by excluding LDFs from the CFC. As we have indicated, LDFs are not considered political action groups under the tax code. By providing tax exemptions to such organizations the Government has already resolved any questions concerning allegations of political advocacy by the LDFs. There is no indication that the Government ever saw a need to deviate from the tax code definition prior to the issuance of Executive Order 12,404\u2014 to the contrary, the regulations preceding Executive Order 12,404 expressly adopted the tax code\u2019s definition of a political action group. <em>See </em>5 C.F.R. \u00a7 950.101(a)(2) (1983) (limiting eligible charities to those that \u201c[a]re not \u2018action\u2019 organizations within the meaning of 26 C.F.R. \u00a7 1.501(c)(3)-l(c)(3) and are eligible to receive tax deductible contributions under 26 U.S.C. 170\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b1348-8\">In fact, at no point in these proceedings, or in the documents included in the record, has the appellant provided a plausible explanation of why LDFs are properly characterized as political advocacy groups. The <em>only </em>distinction proffered by the Government between legal aid societies (which are included in the CFC) and LDFs is that the LDFs \u201care selective of clients on the basis of whether or not they have a cause, claim, or defense\u201d that the LDF wishes to advance, Affidavit of Joseph A. Morris, General Counsel of the OPM 3 (Apr. 12, 1983), <em>reprinted in </em>II J.A. 433. But this surely cannot be the basis for considering LDFs political advocacy groups. While the participating charities \u2014 as well as the LDFs\u2014 share the common trait of providing health and welfare services, many of these organizations have chosen to focus on a particular facet of this extensive area. Whether this focus is on a particular group <em>(e.g., </em>war veterans) or a particular need <em>(e.g., </em>housing), this decision obviously does not turn a group into a political advocacy organization.</p>\n<p id=\"b1348-9\">As the inclusion of legal aid societies in the CFC demonstrates, the fact that a group undertakes litigation seeking judicial enforcement of common law, statutory, and constitutional rights also does not make its activities impermissibly political. We think it equally clear that an organization\u2019s view that it can aid the greatest number of individuals by pursuing relief for a class of individuals cannot be said to \u201cpoliticize\u201d its activities. <em>See generally </em>Affidavit of M.D. Taracido, President of PR LDF 2 (Nov. 25, 1980), <em>reprinted in </em>II J.A. 310 (\u201c[I]t has been the judgment of PRLDEF that, with only six full time staff attorneys, its efforts would serve and benefit a far greater number of people through the vehicle of class <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1261\">*1261</page-number>action litigation than by litigation solely on behalf of individuals.\u201d). Moreover, because both legal aid societies and LDFs typically litigate individual actions and class actions, this consideration would not justify including the former in the CFC while excluding the latter.</p>\n<p id=\"b1349-4\">Inevitably, many of the charities participating in the CFC will have identifiable philosophies. Nevertheless, as their treatment in the tax code demonstrates, this is neither inherently inconsistent with their charitable status nor does it invariably require that the Government deny them access to any Government facility. <em>Cf. Wid-mar v. Vincent, </em>454 U.S. 263, 102 S.Ct. 269, 70 L.Ed.2d 440 (1981) (use of university facilities by student religious group); <em>U.S. Southwest Africa/Namibia Trade &amp; Cultural Council v. United States, </em>708 F.2d 760, 771-72 (D.C.Cir.1983) (political advertisements at public airport did not create appearance of Government support for, or endorsement of, the message advertised).</p>\n<p id=\"b1349-5\">3. <em>The Claim That LDF Participation Would Be Controversial</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1349-6\">We next consider the appellant\u2019s claim that LDFs were excluded from the CFC because their participation was controversial. In his October 1981 memorandum, Dr. Devine revealed his staunch opposition to LDFs before there was any suggestion that their participation in the CFC might prove. controversial. His more recent explanations for their exclusion have emphasized the need to minimize controversy. He argues that many employees opposed their participation in the 1981 and 1982 campaigns, and that individuals and unions threatened to \u2014 and did in fact \u2014 boycott the CFC.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1349-19\">The appellant\u2019s suggestion that LDFs were excluded from the CFC to pacify protesting employees is an extremely disturbing notion when considered in the light of First Amendment protections. The growth of our nation has not been accomplished by suppressing ideas or speakers that we find distasteful. <em>See Bridges v. Wixon, </em>326 U.S. 135, 166, 65 S.Ct. 1443, 1458, 89 L.Ed. 2103 (1945) (Murphy, J., concurring).<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> To allow the intolerance (and threats) of a vocal minority (or even the majority) to determine who shall and shall not speak \u201cwould lead to standardization of ideas,\u201d <em>Terminiello v. Chicago, </em>337 U.S. 1, 4, 69 S.Ct. 894, 93 L.Ed. 1131 (1949), and would \u201cfictionaliz[e] the <em>rationale </em>of the First Amendment.\u201d Note, <em>Constitutional Law </em>\u2014 Free <em>Speech and the Hostile Audience, </em>26 N.Y.U.L.Rev. 489, 491 (1951) (footnote omitted). <em>See also West Virginia State Board of Education v. Barnette, </em>319 U.S. 624, 638, 63 S.Ct. 1178, 1185, 87 L.Ed. 1628 (1943) (\u201cThe very purpose of a Bill of Rights was to withdraw certain subjects from the vicissitudes of political controversy, to place them beyond the reach of majorities and officials and to establish them as legal principles to be applied by the courts.\u201d). This concern has long been reflected in our jurisprudence, and we have been loath to prohibit speech \u201cmerely because the ideas are themselves offensive to some of their hearers.\u201d <em>Street v. New </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1262\">*1262</page-number><em>York, </em>394 U.S. 576, 592, 89 S.Ct. 1354, 1366, 22 L.Ed.2d 572 (1969). Indeed, the Supreme Court has observed that \u201c[t]he right to speak freely and to promote diversity of ideas <em>and programs </em>is .. . one of the chief distinctions that sets us apart from totalitarian regimes.\u201d <em>Terminiello, </em>337 U.S. at 4, 69 S.Ct. at 895 (emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b1350-4\">For the reasons we have already expounded, opposition to including LDFs in the CFC cannot be explained by relevant differences between LDFs and the charities included in the campaign. Nor has the opposition been aroused by the inflammatory nature of the LDFs\u2019 speech. Whittled to its core, the appellant\u2019s argument therefore is simply that when some ill-defined faction in an audience threatens to withhold charitable contributions <em>for any reason, </em>this threat of withholding is sufficient justification for suppression of speech. History unmistakably informs us that the principal victim of this type of censorship is the unpopular minority \u2014 be it religious, racial, political, or some other. <em>See </em>McGaffey, <em>The Heckler\u2019s Veto: A Reexamination, </em>57 Marq.L.Rev. 39, 39 (1973).</p>\n<p id=\"b1350-5\">Allowing such considerations to become the touchstone for regulating First Amendment speech leaves First Amendment liberties subject to the whim of the listener. It also provides Government officials hostile to the interests of a speaker a ready excuse for restricting these liberties. The Supreme Court has said in another context that \u201cone man\u2019s vulgarity is another\u2019s lyric.\u201d <em>Cohen v. California, </em>403 U.S. 15, 25, 91 S.Ct. 1780, 1788, 29 L.Ed.2d 284 (1971). Much the same can be said of attempts to identify the \u201ccontroversial\u201d speaker \u2014 what is controversial to some, may seem perfectly natural to others. Is the Government to determine which speakers are unacceptably controversial by counting letters of protestation, or should its unverified suspicion that a speaker will cause \u201cill feelings\u201d between workers suffice? <em>See </em>appellant\u2019s brief, p. 36. Earlier litigation involving the CFC, in which Director Devine was ultimately required to include Planned Parenthood in the CFC, starkly illustrates the danger entailed by blithe acceptance of such Government determinations:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"aah-dedup-0\">Throughout the prolonged investigation of Planned Parenthood, defendant has stated no specific reason for the extra attention now focused on this agency, aside from the suggestions, without noted evidence supporting them, that financial problems exist and that this is a \u201ccontroversial\u201d agency. At the eligibility hearing on September 2 defendant stated his own views of Planned Parenthood as follows:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1350-7\">Everyone knows where I [Director De-vine] stand in regard to the kind of practices that Planned Parenthood does. You promote abortions; I think that\u2019s detestible (sic). I think in a just world you\u2019d have nothing to do with a charitable drive.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1350-8\">Indeed, the controversial nature of this organization and the vocal opposition of pro-life groups appear to be either the primary factor delaying a decision, or a paramount consideration in that delayed decision.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1350-9\"><em>Planned Parenthood Federation of America, Inc. v. Devine, </em>No. 83-2118, order at 3-4 (D.D.C. Sept. 14, 1983) (order providing that if defendant failed to issue a decision with cogent reasons resolving application of plaintiff by 3:00 p.m. on September 14, plaintiff would automatically be approved for participation in the CFC).</p>\n<p id=\"b1350-10\">These considerations compel us, at a minimum, to examine very carefully the appellant\u2019s suggestion that a differential access policy for the CFC is justified by the Government\u2019s interest in excluding so-called controversial groups. Because this examination reveals the frailty of the appellant\u2019s claim on the facts of this case, we need not go as far as the lower court and decide whether the controversial nature of a speaker is in all cases an <em>impermissible </em>basis for restricting speech on public property.</p>\n<p id=\"b1350-11\">In evaluating the appellant\u2019s claim, we again emphasize that this appeal involves only that portion of the CFC <em>in which employees choose </em>to designate their contributions to specific charities. The Govern<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1263\">*1263</page-number>ment\u2019s role in the CFC facilitates a broad and informed choice by employees interested in making charitable contributions. As long as it is the employees that ultimately decide who they will support, the addition of brief statements by LDFs to a leaflet that already includes hundreds of statements should not engender significant protest.</p>\n<p id=\"b1351-4\">It should also be understood that the access sought in this case is quite unlike that examined by the Supreme Court in <em>Greer v. Spock, </em>424 U.S. 828, 96 S.Ct. 1211, 47 L.Ed.2d 505 (1976). In <em>Greer, </em>the Court had to consider the lawfulness of a military authority\u2019s decision to prevent certain Presidential and Vice Presidential candidates from <em>making speeches, </em>and other plaintiffs from <em>distributing literature, </em>on a military reservation. In upholding the regulation on which the latter prohibition was based, the Court said that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1351-5\">[I]t is to be emphasized that [the regulation] does not authorize the Fort Dix authorities to prohibit the distribution of conventional political campaign literature. The only publications that a military commander may disapprove are those that he finds constitute \u201ca clear danger to [military] loyalty, discipline, or morale,\u201d and he \u201cmay not prevent distribution of a publication simply because he does not like its contents,\u201d or because it \u201cis critical \u2014 even unfairly critical \u2014 of government policies or officials . ... \u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"Apb\"><em>Id. </em>at 840, 96 S.Ct. at 1218 (footnote omitted). Justice Powell\u2019s concurrence further explained that \u201c[although the recruits [on the reservation] may be exposed through the media and, perhaps, the mail to all views in civilian circulation, <em>face-to-face persuasion </em>by someone who urges, say, refusal to obey a superior officer\u2019s command, has an immediacy and impact not found in reading papers and watching television.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 849, 96 S.Ct. at 1223 (Powell, J., concurring) (emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b1351-9\">In the instant case, there is no plausible reason to suspect that the limited and unobtrusive communications at issue will in any way interfere with the normal activities in the workplace. Workers frequently have some exposure to ideas that may prove controversial, but their normal reaction certainly is not to discontinue the work they are being paid to perform. Should they do so, they can be reprimanded or otherwise disciplined. Absent any tangible evidence in the record suggesting that some real and serious disruptions of the workplace will likely occur, we are unwilling to defer to the fanciful \u2014 and somewhat specious \u2014 speculations offered by the appellant.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1351-10\">Nor are we persuaded by the appellant\u2019s suggestion that inclusion of LDFs imperils the fund-raising purposes of the CFC. Although some unions protested the inclusion of one particular LDF in the campaign, the record indicates that these unions encouraged members either to simply <em>designate </em>the charities they wished to support, <em>see </em>Statement of AFL-CIO Executive Council 2 (Aug. 4,1982), <em>reprinted in </em>I J.A. 97, or to \u201cgive <em>directly </em>to causes that we have traditionally supported and that have supported us.\u201d Letter from International Association of Machinists and Aerospace Workers to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1264\">*1264</page-number>Grand Lodge Representatives, <em>et al. </em>(Aug. 18, 1982), <em>reprinted in </em>I J.A. 93 (emphasis added). Moreover, as long as all employees are permitted to <em>choose </em>which groups they will contribute to, providing employees a broad range of groups to choose among may encourage, rather than discourage, employee contributions. The undisputed evidence in the record reveals that substantial numbers of employees chose to contribute to LDFs, <em>see, e.g., </em>Affidavit of Emanuel Owens, Coordinator of NAACP LDF\u2019s Combined Federal Campaign 8-9 (Mar. 1983), <em>reprinted in </em>II J.A. 302-03 (indicating that NAACP LDF received at least $170,000 through CFC in 1981-82); Report of Capital Area CFC (Mar. 2, 1983), <em>reprinted in </em>I J.A. 105 (indicating that among the 41 national service agencies listed, the Sierra Club LDF received the fourth highest percentage of designated contributions, and the NAACP LDF received the seventh highest), and that there was a 3.8% <em>increase </em>in funds raised by the 1982 CFC, Affidavit of P. Kent Bailey, Program Analyst, OPM 2 (June 30, 1983), <em>reprinted in </em>II J.A. 553, in spite of the \u201cdeclining [size of the] federal work force.\u201d Letter from Jack Greenberg to President Reagan 1 (Jan. 11, 1983), <em>reprinted in </em>I J.A. 101.<footnotemark>17</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1352-4\">Hence, the record does not support the appellant\u2019s claim that the Government acted reasonably in excluding LDFs from the campaign to appease employees opposed to their inclusion. It should also be noted that the appellant\u2019s protestations of concern about controversial eligibility decisions is tellingly rebutted by his treatment of charities providing family planning services. As we have indicated, the appellant resisted inclusion of Planned Parenthood in the campaign, ostensibly on the ground that its participation was controversial. However, participation by the Moral Majority Foundation, Inc., was allowed even though its activities include providing educational services with respect to abortion counseling.<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> One can hardly envision decisions more likely to lead to outcries of \u201cpoliticization\u201d and demands for boycotts of the campaign. The Government cannot simply \u201cpick and choose\u201d its controversies as a means to restrict speech by those it views disfavorably. On the facts of this case, the appellant\u2019s claim \u2014 that the alleged controversial nature of LDFs justifies denying them the same opportunity to communicate permitted similarly situated charities \u2014 must be rejected as wholly unreasonable.</p>\n<p id=\"b1352-8\">4. <em>Restricted Access to Avoid Undue Burdens on the CFC</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1352-9\">The final rationale asserted by the appellant is the need to avoid innundation of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1265\">*1265</page-number>CFC. Absent some reasonable <em>distinction </em>between LDFs and the included charities, however, this consideration cannot possibly justify the Government\u2019s differential access policy. If the Government is required to limit the access of charities that it cannot meaningfully distinguish, it must allocate spots in the CFC between these charities in some even-handed manner, <em>see, e.g., Hef-fron v. International Society for Krishna Consciousness, Inc., </em>452 U.S. 640, 649, 101 S.Ct. 2559, 2565, 69 L.Ed.2d 298 (1981) (\u201cfirst-come, first-served system\u201d), rather than arbitrarily identifying LDFs for exclusion. Additionally, the appellant has recently acknowledged that this Government interest is not furthered in any noticeable way by exclusion of LDFs:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1353-4\">I do not suspect that many groups that are presently eligible for the campaign would not be eligible under our proposal.... [T]here will be very little impact in terms of numbers on those eligible.... It is going to have an impact [on the number of charities], but in terms, let\u2019s say, of 500 in the Washington, D.C. area, we may be talking about ten or something like that, and in terms of percentage in it would be very small.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1353-5\">Devine testimony, <em>supra, </em>at 44 \u2014 45, <em>reprinted in </em>II J.A. 412-13.</p>\n<p id=\"b1353-6\">5. <em>Alternative Forums</em></p>\n<p id=\"AKBY\">Finally, we need not consider at great length any claims made regarding the alleged availability of alternative forums to the appellees. In a society that cherishes freedom to speak, deprivation of a particular forum typically will not leave the speaker without <em>any </em>opportunity to communicate. It is therefore not surprising that the availability of alternative forums has never been considered to justify Government attempts to \u201cpick and choose\u201d among preferred speakers. To allow such a justification would be to nullify important rights of free speech.</p>\n<p id=\"b1353-8\">The LDFs have every right to seek access to the CFC once the Government makes the forum available to other like charities and offers no reasonable explanation for the exclusion of LDFs. It is hardly surprising that the LDFs have challenged their exclusion from the CFC. Effective charitable solicitation depends on economical and efficient means to communicate one\u2019s message to mass audiences. The CFC is the <em>exclusive </em>forum for charitable solicitation in the Federal workplace, and the undisputed evidence in the record indicates that it is a critical medium for making charitable appeals to Federal employees.<footnotemark>19</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1353-9\">The principal point here, however, is not that the CFC is an effective forum for solicitation; the same result that we reach today would hold even if it could be shown that the CFC produced relatively little by way of contributions for LDFs. The principal point in this case is that, in the absence of any reasonable ground for making the CFC forum available to charities like LDFs but not to LDFs, the restriction challenged by the appellees violates the First Amendment.</p>\n<p id=\"b1353-10\">A Postscript in Response to the Dissent</p>\n<p id=\"A-g\">In affirming the District Court\u2019s opinion, we have been guided by a fundamental, yet hardly earthshaking, proposition: the First Amendment does not permit the Government to differentiate between similarly situated speakers in regulating speech on public property, unless there is some reasonable basis for this differentiation. This limitation on the Government\u2019s right to discriminate <em>unjustifiably </em>between like speakers, in no way imperils the Government\u2019s power to insist reasonably on order within its facilities. It is simply a recognition that a free society neither requires, nor countenances, the creation of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1266\">*1266</page-number>vast enclaves in which one is permitted to speak only at the fancy of the Government.</p>\n<p id=\"b1354-4\">The dissent obviously takes a very different view of the First Amendment. It proclaims that the Amendment is the \u201cbasic bulwark of our liberty,\u201d but proceeds to make a mockery of this declaration by advocating a \u201ctest\u201d which arbitrarily and unreasonably removes the workplaces of millions of Americans from the Amendment\u2019s protection. We need not respond at length to the views expressed in this dissent. For the most part, it is sufficient for us simply to note that the test it advocates completely disregards any value of the First Amendment, and the \u201cfacts\u201d it analyzes are totally removed from those actually before us.</p>\n<p id=\"b1354-5\">The dissent begins \u2014 as it must \u2014 by acknowledging that <em>Perry </em>requires that distinctions between speakers in \u201cnonpublic forums\u201d be <em>reasonable. See Perry Education Association v. Perry Local Educators\u2019 </em>Association, -- U.S. --, 103 S.Ct. 948, 957, 74 L.Ed.2d 794 (1983). <em>See also United States Postal Service v. Council of Greenburgh Civic Associations, </em>453 U.S. 114, 131 n. 7, 101 S.Ct. 2676, 2686 n. 7, 69 L.Ed.2d 517 (1981). It then inexplicably ignores its own words by applying a <em>rational basis </em>test. Although the dissent does not deem it necessary to explain what this <em>does </em>require the Government to establish, it is quite emphatic in its enumeration of what is <em>not </em>required of the Government:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1354-8\">(1) the Government\u2019s distinction need not further a significant Government interest (Dissenting Opinion at 1274);</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1354-9\">(2) the Government need not produce any evidence that the asserted interest will be advanced (Dissenting Opinion at 1275);</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1354-10\">(3) a Government prohibition of otherwise protected speech is justified when it is in response to the protestations of potential listeners (Dissenting Opinion at 1277-1280);</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1354-11\">(4) the existence of less restrictive means to advance the Government\u2019s interest is irrelevant (Dissenting Opinion at 1275); and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1354-12\">(5) the fact that the Government is motivated by a desire to suppress a speaker, or even a speaker\u2019s view, is irrelevant if the Government can point to some rational basis for its treatment of the speaker</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1354-14\">(Dissenting Opinion at 1281 n. 48).</p>\n<p id=\"b1354-15\">This is an extraordinary view of the protection afforded by the \u201cbasic bulwark of our liberty.\u201d The word \u201creasonable,\u201d as used by the Supreme Court in <em>Perry, </em>has been rendered meaningless by the dissent. We do not have the slightest doubt that <em>any </em>Government restriction on speech would survive scrutiny under the so-called deferential test enunciated by the dissent. Indeed, the dissent seems to embrace a notion that any Government prohibition of First Amendment activity is by definition rational because it is an act of the Government. In advocating such an approach, the dissent has simply chosen to ignore the clear teachings of <em>Perry.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1354-16\">The dissent\u2019s defense of the Government\u2019s differential access policy is predicated on its unquestioning acceptance of the Government\u2019s characterization of this policy. The dissent repeatedly labels the charities included in the CFG as noncontroversial, \u201ctraditional charities,\u201d while labeling the excluded LDFs as \u201cpolitical advocacy groups\u201d; it therefore has little trouble finding a rational basis for the Government\u2019s policy. This is a gross oversimplification of the policy that is really at issue in this case, and disregards the undisputed facts about the organizations that <em>actually participate </em>in the campaign.</p>\n<p id=\"b1354-17\">By acquiescing in the Government\u2019s abstractions, the dissent offers no explanations for the real distinctions that are being made by the Government. The dissent does not tell us why LDFs can reasonably be considered \u201cadvocacy\u201d groups, while legal aid societies are not. It does not tell us why affording employees an opportunity to contribute to LDFs is unacceptably controversial, while differential treatment of groups providing abortion counseling is not. Nor does it explain how the sports and recreation societies \u2014 which Dr. Devine said have no place in a charity drive \u2014 better provide for the essential needs of the hungry, sick and ignorant, than organizations <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1267\">*1267</page-number>dedicated to the protection of basic legal rights.</p>\n<p id=\"b1355-4\">Content to rely on Dr. Devine\u2019s self-serving and inaccurate characterizations of the CFC, the dissent proceeds to consider whether a justification can be found for treating \u201ctraditional charities\u201d differently than \u201cadvocacy groups.\u201d Given the tenuity of the test it employs, one should not be surprised to find the dissent persuaded by <em>every </em>justification raised by the Government during its three year effort to exorcise LDFs from the CFC. Even more revealing is the dissent\u2019s unqualified acceptance of justifications that either <em>were not even mentioned </em>by the Government until this litigation was commenced or were <em>expressly repudiated </em>by the Government.</p>\n<p id=\"b1355-5\">We have already elucidated the obvious shortcomings in these justifications; some final observations are now in order. First, the dissent\u2019s consistent references to LDFs as \u201cpolitical advocacy groups\u201d implies a difference between the activities of LDFs and other charities that simply ignores reality. <em>See </em>Devine testimony, <em>supra, </em>at 52, 53, <em>reprinted in </em>II J.A. 420,421 (arguing that it is \u201cperfectly appropriate\u201d for charities to \u201clobby or otherwise present their views on issues that relate to their interests\u201d). Even the dissent appears uncomfortable with the implication that \u201creal\u201d charities transcend advocacy, since it makes no serious attempt to argue that \u201cpolitical advocacy\u201d is even a rational basis for distinguishing LDFs from the charities included in the CFC. Instead, the dissent unconvincingly attempts to salvage its position by asserting that the Government will appear less political if LDFs are excluded. The Supreme Court\u2019s \u201cnonpublic forum\u201d eases have never suggested that restrictions on <em>nonpolitical </em>speech can be justified by the baseless complaints of some listeners that the Government is being political. We can only express our amazement at the dissent\u2019s claim that unreasonable distinctions between <em>speakers </em>\u2014 imposed <em>simply to appease protesting listeners </em>\u2014 will somehow make the Government seem <em>less </em>political.</p>\n<p id=\"b1355-11\">The dissent\u2019s discussion of the \u201ccontroversial nature\u201d of LDFs is equally disturbing. The dissent conveniently ignores the fact that only <em>designated </em>contributions are at issue in this case. It does not explain why affording employees the <em>opportunity </em>to contribute to LDFs will prove as \u201ccontroversial\u201d as the possibility that employees might <em>unwittingly </em>support them through undesig-nated contributions. Even more fundamentally, the dissent\u2019s discussion reveals its willingness to allow the reaction of an audi<em>ence </em>\u2014 no <em>matter how unworthy its basis </em>\u2014to define the scope of First Amendment activity. Whether the cause of this reaction be racial hatred, religious bigotry, or otherwise, in the dissent\u2019s view the Government acts wisely when it responds by silencing the speaker.<footnotemark>20</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1355-12\">Nothing more need be said of this dissenting opinion. The dissent has simply attempted \u2014 by advocating an astonishingly narrow construction of the First Amendment and by refusing even to question the Government\u2019s assertions of interest in this ease \u2014 to make the First Amendment a nullity in that part of the public domain that it considers the \u201cnonpublic forum.\u201d The Constitution does not envision such pockets of tyranny, and we unqualifiedly repudiate the dissent\u2019s attempt to create them.</p>\n<p id=\"b1355-13\">Conclusion</p>\n<p id=\"b1355-14\">Although the Government has substantial latitude in regulating speech on property falling within the third category delineated in <em>Perry, </em>this regulation cannot discriminate between speakers absent some reasonable justification for doing so. In this case, the Government has permitted hundreds of charities to make unobtusive appeals to Federal employees through the CFC, and has thereby facilitated its employees\u2019 awareness of a broad range of options for their charitable support. Our review of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1268\">*1268</page-number>multifarious and shifting explanations advanced by the appellant reveals no reasonable basis for denying the appellees the same opportunity. Instead, it most strikingly reveals the appellant\u2019s steadfast desire to find some way to exclude LDFs, while including charities that he viewed more favorably. The First Amendment does not tolerate discrimination of this sort by the Government.</p>\n<p id=\"b1356-4\">Judge Wright is in complete agreement with this opinion, but would reach the issue that we find unnecessary to decide: whether the CFC constitutes a limited public forum. He would hold that it does, and would affirm the District Court\u2019s decision because the applicable First Amendment requirements have not been satisfied.</p>\n<p id=\"b1356-5\">The District Court\u2019s decision is affirmed. As ordered by the District Court, the appellant, his agents and subordinates, are permanently enjoined from excluding the ap-pellees from participation in the Combined Federal Campaign with respect to the solicitation of designated contributions on the basis of the provisions of section 2(b)(l through 3) of Executive Order 12,353, as amended by section 1(b) of Executive Order 12,404.<footnotemark>21</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"AE-\">\n<em>So ordered.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1337-11\">.

Although we therefore will refer to the CFC as the forum at issue, this differentiation has little impact on our analysis because we assume, without deciding, that the forum is within Perry\u2019s third category. In assessing the reasonableness of restrictions in such a forum, it is proper to consider Government interests in preventing disruption of the environment in which the forum is located \u2014 in this case, the Federal workplace. <em>See id. </em>at 959 (Government could restrict access to school mail facilities to \u201cinsur[e] labor-peace within the schools\u201d).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"12\">\n<p id=\"b1347-5\">.

In <em>Perry, </em>the Supreme Court recognized that disruption of the workplace would be highly likely if an employer was required to allow a <em>rival </em>union access to the school mail system so that it could challenge a lawfully certified union.

Not only does the record fail to support the suggestion that work was disrupted when LDFs participated in the CFC in 1981 and 1982, the fear of such disruption is completely counterintuitive. Assertions of workplace disruption resulting from First Amendment activities can often be made, and almost inevitably will be made when speech critical of the Government is involved.

The appellant\u2019s suggestion that the inclusion of controversial groups necessitated \u201cextraordinary exertions\u201d by Federal officials conducting the CFC, is wholly unpersuasive as a justification for excluding LDFs. Generally, Federal employees are only encouraged to participate actively in the work of voluntary agencies in the CFC \u201cto the extent consistent with Federal agency policy and prudent use of official time,\u201d 5 C.F.R. \u00a7 950.105 (1983), although one or more Federal executives may be \u201cloaned\u201d to work on a local CFC. <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 950.509(k). The appellant has not claimed that the controversial nature of the CFC required additional personnel to be assigned to its management, nor has he made any attempt to provide even the roughest approximation of the extra efforts which allegedly were required.</p>\n<p id=\"b1352-6\">In fact, the record indisputably indicates that the concern raised by the appellant is merely a post hoc rationalization for the exclusion of LDFs. Although in the proceedings below the appellant\u2019s briefings made some vague references to \u201cworkplace disruption,\u201d it was never suggested that the efforts required of Federal personnel justified exclusion of LDFs, or that they played any part in the Government\u2019s decision to exclude LDFs. Similarly, neither the appellant\u2019s February 1983 memorandum, nor his subsequent testimony, even argue that the alleged extra efforts required by the inclusion of LDFs were so substantial that they justified exclusion of LDFs. The only evidence cited in the appellant\u2019s argument on this point on appeal, is a statement in the preamble to new regulations proposed in June 1983, see 48 Fed.

The appellant\u2019s objections to the District Court\u2019s order are frivolous and merit only a brief response. As the Government has chosen to impose time, place, and manner requirements dictating that charitable solicitation in Federal facilities be conducted through the CFC, and it is only the unreasonable exclusion from the CFC pursuant to Executive Order 12,-404 that is at issue in this appeal, it was completely appropriate for the District Court to enjoin exclusion from the CFC on the basis of the executive order as a remedy. The appellant\u2019s suggestion that the appellees should instead be permitted to make direct, personal appeals in the workplace, not only goes beyond what is at issue in this case, but is hopelessly inconsistent with the appellant\u2019s professed concerns about disruption and controversy in the workplace.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b1356-6\">STARR, Circuit Judge,</author>\n<p id=\"AUe\">dissenting:</p>\n<p id=\"ajt-dedup-0\">Western philosophers, theologians, and statesmen of widely varying viewpoints have affirmed for over two thousand years that charity \u2014 the feeding of the hungry, the healing of the sick, and the educating of the ignorant \u2014 has a claim on the human conscience that transcends political differences. In response to this ancient claim, the federal government conducts an annual charitable drive among federal employees known as the Combined Federal Campaign. Like those private employers which conduct similar drives, the federal government has a legitimate interest both in minimizing the time devoted by its employees to the charitable campaign and in preventing the campaign from disrupting the workplace. As a provider or financier of welfare and health benefits, the government, unlike private employers, has a profound and direct interest in the success of this charitable drive, for what the needy receive from charity they will not require from government.</p>\n<p id=\"b1356-9\">The majority\u2019s decision today to mandate the federal charitable campaign\u2019s inclusion of advocacy groups \u2014 non-profit, tax-exempt organizations engaged in the pursuit of policy goals through litigation \u2014 distorts the nature of charity. The results of this exercise of judicial power not only threaten the success of the federal charitable drive, but impose as well unnecessary burdens on the federal resources required to conduct it. If the law required this unhappy result, I would suppress my own misgivings about the wisdom of the decision and stoutheart-edly join the majority. But today\u2019s decision is compelled neither by the Constitution nor by relevant decisions of the Supreme Court. In fact, as I will seek to demonstrate, the majority\u2019s decision is at war with the law of the First Amendment.</p>\n<p id=\"b1356-10\">To foreshadow the discussion to come, the bedrock distinction between a \u201cpublic forum\u201d and \u201cnonpublic forum\u201d in First Amendment law \u2014 a pivotal distinction avoided by the majority\u2019s analytical legerdemain \u2014 is designed to prevent that basic bulwark of our liberty from irrationally transforming the nature of a facility which is devoted to purposes <em>other </em>than public discourse and debate. We are dealing here not with a street or park or other gathering place for exchange in the marketplace of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1269\">*1269</page-number>ideas. This is the federal workplace. And while the majority\u2019s approach does not directly challenge the proposition that a federal charitable campaign conducted in the federal workplace constitutes a \u201cnonpublic forum\u201d under applicable First Amendment analysis, the majority, in striking down the limitations at issue here, employs a stringent standard of review under the guise of a \u201creasonableness test\u201d that comports not at all with the deferential standard demanded by Supreme Court precedent. In a word, much of the majority\u2019s analysis is inapplicable to the case at hand.</p>\n<p id=\"b1357-4\">Furthermore, the majority seems to overlook the fact that this case comes before us on the advocacy groups\u2019 motion for summary judgment. Far from reading the evidence in the light most favorable to the government, the majority in fact blinks at substantial evidence in this record that would support the restrictions at issue here even in the face of more searching judicial scrutiny than governing case law warrants. Inasmuch as the government has presented ample evidence in support of the challenged restrictions to survive a summary judgment motion testing their reasonableness, I respectfully dissent.</p>\n<p id=\"b1357-5\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b1357-6\">A.</p>\n<p id=\"b1357-7\">The standards for measuring government-imposed limitations upon First Amendment access to public property differ depending upon the nature or character of the property at issue.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> <em>Perry Education Association </em>v. <em>Perry Local Educators Association, -</em>- U.S. --, 103 S.Ct. 948, 74 L.Ed.2d 794 (1983). Judicial review is most exacting when the place to which access is sought is categorized as a \u201cpublic forum.\u201d Governmental restrictions on access to a public forum will be upheld only if the limitations are \u201cnecessary to serve a compelling state interest and ... [are] narrowly drawn to achieve that end.\u201d <em>Id. </em>The standard of review is also stringent when a \u201climited public forum\u201d is at issue; however, such a forum may legitimately be limited to the use of groups or the discussion of subjects for which the forum was created in the first instance. <em>Perry, </em>103 S.Ct. at 955 n. 7. In contrast, the standard of judicial review for limitations on access to a \u201cnonpublic forum\u201d<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> is considerably more deferential. Such restrictions will be upheld so long as they are \u201creasonable\u201d and are \u201cviewpoint neutral,\u201d which is to say that the restrictions are \u201cnot an effort to suppress expression merely because public officials oppose the speaker\u2019s view.\u201d <em>Perry, </em>103 S.Ct. at 955.</p>\n<p id=\"b1357-11\">The paradigm instances of a public forum are streets and parks \u2014 traditional places for public assembly and expression. <em>See United States Postal Service v. Council of Greenburgh Civic Associations, </em>453 U.S. 114, 101 S.Ct. 2676, 69 L.Ed.2d 517 (1981) (citing, <em>e.g., Hague v. CIO, </em>307 U.S. 496, 59 S.Ct. 954, 83 L.Ed. 1423 (1939)). Other forums deemed \u201cpublic\u201d for First Amendment purposes are university meeting facilities, <em>see Widmar v. Vincent, </em>454 U.S. 263, 102 S.Ct. 269, 70 L.Ed.2d 440 (1981) and municipal theaters, <em>see Southeastern Promotions, Ltd. v. Conrad, </em>420 U.S. 546, 95 S.Ct. 1239, 43 L.Ed.2d 448 (1975).<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> On the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1270\">*1270</page-number>other hand, the Court has held that a school\u2019s internal mail system, <em>see Perry, supra; </em>postal mailboxes, <em>see Greenburgh, supra; </em>military bases, <em>see Greer v. Spock, </em>424 U.S. 828, 96 S.Ct. 1211, 47 L.Ed.2d 505 (1976); and advertising panels in rapid transit vehicles, <em>see Lehman v. Shaker Heights, </em>418 U.S. 298, 94 S.Ct. 2714, 41 L.Ed.2d 770 (1974) (plurality opinion), are not public forums.</p>\n<p id=\"b1358-4\">These cases clearly indicate that no bright-line test exists to distinguish between public and nonpublic forums. Instead, the Supreme Court cases analyze the nature of the particular facility in question and determine whether the forum is \u201cpublic\u201d or \u201cnonpublic\u201d in light of three factors. <em>First, </em>the Court analyzes the history of the facility to determine whether the public has traditionally used the place as a forum for expression of views. <em>See Greer v. Spock, supra, </em>424 U.S. at 838, 96 S.Ct. at 1217 (\u201cThe notion that federal military reservations, like municipal streets and parks, have traditionally served as a place for free pub-lie assembly and communications of thoughts by private citizens is thus historically and constitutionally false\u201d).<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> <em>Second, </em>the Court has looked to the capacity in which the government is operating the forum. The Court is less likely to determine that a public forum exists when the government is operating the facility or installation in the role of employer; <em>see Greer v. Spock, supra, </em>424 U.S. at 830, 838, 96 S.Ct. at 1213, 1218 (emphasizing that military bases are used for the training of personnel); or a commercial venturer, <em>see Lehman, supra, </em>418 U.S. at 303, 94 S.Ct. at 2717 (emphasizing that in running a rapid transit service the municipality was operating as a commercial venturer); <em>Greenburgh, supra, </em>453 U.S. at 127, 101 S.Ct. at 2684 (emphasizing the commercial nature of the postal service).<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> <em>Third, </em>and finally, the Court inquires into whether the government permits the forum to be used \u201cindiscriminately\u201d by the public. <em>See Perry, </em>103 S.Ct. at 956.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1359-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1271\">*1271</page-number>B.</p>\n<p id=\"b1359-4\">The threshold question in this case, which the majority chooses not to address, is how to characterize the forum at issue here in accordance with the Supreme Court\u2019s teaching, as set out above. The government argues that the forum at issue is the federal workplace in which the campaign takes place. The advocacy groups argue, in contrast, that the forum should be viewed as the Combined Federal Campaign, as embodied in the standardized pamphlet listing charitable organizations which is circulated to employees throughout the federal workplace. While the Supreme Court has never squarely addressed a similar problem, this court recently resolved a similar issue in <em>United States-South West Africa/Namibia Trade &amp; Cultural Council v. United States, </em>708 F.2d 760 (D.C.Cir.1983) [hereinafter cited as Namibia]. In that case, the district court in its public forum analysis had focused solely upon the advertising display cases at National Airport, disembodied from the airport terminals in which the displays were situated. In reversing the district court, this court stated that the analytical focus upon the display cases alone was unduly \u201cnarrow.\u201d To \u201cappraise accurately\u201d whether the forum is public or nonpublic, the court concluded that it had to evaluate the advertising panels in the context of the airport of which they were a part. <em>Namibia, </em>708 F.2d at 784.</p>\n<p id=\"b1359-5\">In my view, this approach \u2014 analyzing the communicative medium in the larger context of the place in which the facility exists \u2014 is supported both by Supreme Court precedent and the rationale of the public forum doctrine. As the <em>Namibia </em>court itself noted, focusing on the larger context \u201cparallels the Supreme Court\u2019s consideration of the functions and physical limitations of the buses at issue in <em>Lehman.\u2019\u2019 Namibia, </em>708 F.2d at 764 (citation omitted). Furthermore, in- deciding that political speakers had no right of access to a <em>public area </em>on a military base, the Supreme Court analyzed that area in the context of the history and traditions of the military base as a whole. <em>See Greer v. Spock, supra. </em>Both in <em>Lehman </em>and <em>Greer, </em>therefore, the Court eschewed an artificial, piecemeal analysis in determining precisely the metes and bounds of the forum in question.</p>\n<p id=\"b1359-7\"><em>Namibia </em>is entirely consistent with this common-sense approach. Moreover, because the public forum doctrine involves an analysis of property and facilities in order to determine the appropriate level of scrutiny for restrictions on access, it would be anomalous to analyze the communicative medium \u2014 such as an advertising display panel in an airport terminal or on a bus\u2014 without reference to the place in which it exists. The fact that an advertising display panel is situated on a bus rather than in a park or publicly owned property abutting a street is highly relevant to an evaluation of government-imposed restrictions on access to the advertising panel.</p>\n<p id=\"b1359-8\">The anomaly of ignoring the larger place within which the medium for communication is situated would be particularly glaring in cases where, as here, the communicative medium is inseparable from the place in which it is situated. The CFC pamphlets are circulated only within the federal workplace. So too the solicitations by federal workers on behalf of the CFC occur only within the federal workplace. It is therefore to the federal workplace to which we must initially look to decide whether a public or nonpublic forum analysis is appropriate.</p>\n<p id=\"b1359-9\">The federal workplace in which the CFC takes place, both military and civilian, bears little resemblance to a public street or park, places that the Supreme Court has found to be paradigms of the public forum. Indeed, as we have already observed the Supreme Court in <em>Greer v. Spock </em>specifically held that the federal military workplace- \u2014 the military base \u2014 is a nonpublic forum. The Court reasoned that there is no history or tradition of public expression at a military base. It stated that \u201cit is ... the business of a military installation like Fort Dix to train soldiers, not to provide a public forum.\u201d <em>Greer v. Spock, </em>424 U.S. at 838, 96 S.Ct. at 1217.</p>\n<p id=\"b1360-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1272\">*1272</page-number>This reasoning, in my view, applies just as readily in the setting of the civilian workplace. It is the business of the federal civilian workplace to attend to the myriad interests and duties of government, not to provide a public forum for First Amendment communication. Not surprisingly, therefore, the federal workplace has not traditionally served as a place for public assembly or communication of ideas among private citizens. Public debate and discussion of United States foreign policy, for example, are at the core of First Amendment concerns, but that debate and discussion between private citizens need not be permitted in State Department offices at Foggy Bottom.</p>\n<p id=\"b1360-4\">The Supreme Court has suggested repeatedly in <em>dicta </em>that public institutions such as the federal workplace, whose primary mission lies other than in serving as forums for communication, are simply not public forums. \u201cWere we to hold to the contrary [i.e., that the forum at issue was public], display cases in public hospitals, libraries, <em>office buildings, </em>military compounds, and other public facilities would become Hyde Parks open to every would-be pamphleteer and politician. This the Constitution does not require.\u201d <em>Lehman, supra, </em>418 U.S. at 304, 94 S.Ct. at 2718 (plurality opinion of Blackmun, J.) (emphasis added).<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> The presence of security personnel and sign-in sheets throughout the federal workplace powerfully attest to the undisputed fact that, in a word, the offices of the Department of State or the Department of Defense are not public parks surrounded by walls and ceilings. They are places to which the general public, even for First Amendment purposes, is not automatically permitted to enter simply to exercise constitutional rights.</p>\n<p id=\"b1360-9\">C.</p>\n<p id=\"b1360-10\">The advocacy groups contend, however, that the federal government\u2019s introduction of a charitable drive in the federal workplace creates a public forum, albeit of a limited nature.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> There is absolutely no evidence in this record, however, suggesting any tradition that a charitable drive conducted in an employer\u2019s workplace is open to the public. Nor is any evidence of such a tradition likely to exist. To the contrary, a letter from the chairman of the Board of Governors of the United Way of America, a charity invariably included in both public and private employer charitable drives, makes it crystal clear that charitable endeavors in the workplace have depended upon the agreement of government, industry, and labor to put aside political differences; as the letter aptly states, the inclusion of groups engaged in pursuing political or policy goals endangers that long-standing \u201csocial compact.\u201d<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> From the evidence in this record, in short, it seems abundantly clear that employers have traditionally not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1273\">*1273</page-number>opened their charitable drives to any public group that wishes to participate.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1361-4\">Moreover, the government, as represented by six different Administrations, has never voluntarily included advocacy groups in the federal campaign, let alone every group that wishes to appeal to federal workers for funds. President Kennedy\u2019s 1961 Executive Order initiating the Federal Charitable Campaign limited participation in the campaign to \u201cnational voluntary health and welfare agencies and such other[s] ... as may be appropriate.\u201d Exec. Order No. 10,927, \u00a7 2(a), 3 C.F.R. 454 (1959-1963 compilation). There is <em>undisputed </em>evidence in the record that this language was understood to limit participation in the campaign to charities that provided traditional health and welfare services to the needy, not organizations devoted to legal advocacy in pursuit of various notions of public policy.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> This understanding was codified in a government manual governing the conduct of the campaign: it limited participation to organizations \u201cproviding direct services to persons in the fields of health and welfare services.\u201d<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> Only after the federal district court for this District in <em>NAACP Legal Defense and Educational Fund, Inc. v. Campbell, </em>504 F.Supp. 1365 (D.D.C.1981), invalidated this provision as unacceptably vague under the First Amendment did the government allow advocacy groups to participate.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> The advocacy groups thus entered the CFC only as a direct consequence of a lawsuit contested by the government. On this record, it is clear beyond doubt from the two-decade history of the campaign that the government is seeking to return the CFC to the traditional contours within which it has always operated. This, then, is not a ease of the government\u2019s trying to close the barn door after voluntarily allowing the horse to gallop away.</p>\n<p id=\"b1361-8\">Moreover, <em>Perry </em>plainly means that a traditionally nonpublic forum is not transformed into a public forum, limited or otherwise, by the government\u2019s conferring selective access to the facility on the part of certain groups. The Court in <em>Perry </em>specifically rejected the contention that use of the internal school mail system by the Cub Scouts and similar groups turned the mail system into a public forum or limited public forum, since such selective access did not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1274\">*1274</page-number>amount to \u201cindiscriminate use\u201d by the general public. 103 S.Ct. at 955-956.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> Certainly the Combined Federal Campaign is not and never has been used indiscriminately by the public, nor is the public allowed indiscriminate access to the federal workplace.</p>\n<p id=\"b1362-4\">As indicated above, the government does not circulate all appeals from the public in the CFC but only those from certain traditional health and welfare organizations generally included in an employer\u2019s charitable drive. Furthermore, the \u201cspeech\u201d permitted to the charitable groups is strictly limited in ways that clearly prevent any possible claim of indiscriminate access. First, the CFC allows the pamphlets to be circulated once a year for six weeks. 5 C.F.R. \u00a7 950.103 (1983). Second, the statements are limited to thirty-word descriptions of the nature of the program. 5 C.F.R. \u00a7 950.521. These materials must not contain \u201cdistractions that compete for the contributors\u2019 attention,\u201d 5 C.F.R. \u00a7 950.-521(d) and \u201cmust have the approval of the local Federal Coordinating Committee.\u201d<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> 5 C.F.R. \u00a7 950.521(a). The charitable group-is not permitted to make any spontaneous or personal appeal of its own; to the contrary, federal workers circulate the pamphlets and make any follow-up solicitations. These strict limitations on speech conclusively establish that the CFC, as conducted and regulated in the federal workplace, resembles not at all the public forums that \u201chave been used for the purpose of assembly, communicating thoughts between citizens, and discussing public questions.\u201d <em>Hague v. CIO, supra, </em>307 U.S. at 515, 59 S.Ct. at 964.</p>\n<p id=\"b1362-8\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b1362-9\">A.</p>\n<p id=\"b1362-10\">Once the forum is categorized as nonpublic, the restrictions on access must be upheld if they are both reasonable and neutral as to the viewpoint espoused by the \u201cspeaker.\u201d <em>Perry, </em>103 S.Ct. at 955. The Supreme Court\u2019s decisions make it abundantly clear that the standard of \u201creasonableness\u201d is deferential, giving substantial weight to judgments of those familiar with the nature of the forum \u2014 an approach far removed from that employed by the majority.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> In none of these cases was the government required to produce a \u201ccompelling\u201d or \u201csignificant\u201d governmental interest<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> to justify the restrictions. To the contrary, the government must simply provide a \u201crational basis\u201d for its exclusion of certain organi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1275\">*1275</page-number>zations from the nonpublic forum.<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> Nor has the Court engaged in the \u201cleast restrictive alternative analysis\u201d to strike down restrictions in a nonpublic forum.<footnotemark>19</footnotemark> Indeed, in <em>Greenburgh, supra, </em>453 U.S. at 132, 101 S.Ct. at 2686, the Court refused to be drawn into balancing the interests of the civic association in using the mailboxes at issue there as against the interests of the government in restricting mailbox access \u2014 a task in which the lower court had engaged at length. The Court made it clear that the standard of review applicable to content-neutral time, place and manner regulations did <em>not </em>have to be met in the case of restrictions on access to a nonpublic forum.</p>\n<p id=\"b1363-4\">Moreover, in several cases the Court has not required the government to produce evidence of dangers against which the government-imposed restrictions on access are to be aimed. The judicial deference evidenced in those cases is particularly noteworthy in divining the appropriate standard of review in the instant case, because the dangers against which the restrictions upon CFC participation are aimed are strikingly similar. For instance, when in <em>Perry </em>the school system alleged that allowing a union which was a rival to the incumbent bargaining agent to use the school\u2019s internal mail system would disrupt the school, the Court specifically stated that it would require no proof of the possibility of disruption. <em>Perry, </em>103 S.Ct. at 959 n. 12.<footnotemark>20</footnotemark> Similarly in <em>Lehman, </em>the worthies of Shaker Heights produced no evidence whatever, nor were they required to, to justify the contentions that allowing paid political advertisements would endanger long term transit revenues and that such advertisements would create \u201clurking doubts about favoritism\u201d on the part of city authorities. 418 U.S. at 304, 94 S.Ct. at 2718.</p>\n<p id=\"b1363-10\">In particular, the majority dramatically departs from this body of prior case law when it in effect steps up the standard of judicial review by virtue of the fact that advocacy groups have the same <em>status </em>under the Internal Revenue Code as traditional health and welfare organizations. The tax laws were not drafted with the conduct of charitable campaigns in the federal workplace in mind. With due respect both to the majority and to the tax laws, the Internal Revenue Code may well be of abid<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1276\">*1276</page-number>ing relevance and interest to taxpayers, but it is breathtakingly irrelevant to whether the government\u2019s restrictions on CFC participation are reasonable. It is certainly true that <em>Perry </em>emphasized the respective statuses of the union that, as the elected bargaining agent, was allowed to use the internal mailbox, and of the union that, as a mere rival with no collective bargaining responsibilities, was excluded from mailbox access. <em>But, critically, the Supreme Court has not heightened judicial review in nonpublic forum eases when there happens to be no difference in legal status between the admitted and the excluded. </em>In <em>Green-burgh, North Carolina Prisoners\u2019 Union, Greer, </em>and <em>Lehman, supra, </em>the Court did not demand that the groups or individuals treated unfavorably have different statuses as codified in some law like the tax code; rather, the Court merely inquired into whether the government had a rational basis for distinguishing between the groups in the context of the forum.</p>\n<p id=\"b1364-4\">Indeed, <em>Perry, </em>insofar as it speaks to the reasonableness of restrictions in a very different kind of nonpublic forum, supports the government\u2019s position here. In <em>Perry, </em>the Supreme Court emphasized the relevance of private industry practice in evaluating whether there was a rational basis for the differential access given to different groups. 103 S.Ct. at 958 n. 11. The evidence in this record, indicating that private industry admits traditional health and welfare groups but not advocacy groups like appellees into its charitable drives,<footnotemark>21</footnotemark> suggests that the government\u2019s distinction is not capricious.</p>\n<p id=\"b1364-5\">As a practical matter, the majority\u2019s invocation of the various organizations\u2019 legal status as the linchpin of its constitutional analysis would potentially transform the federal charitable drive into a Babel of competing organizations, once the news goes forth that tax-exempt status, without more, entitles an organization to participate in the CFC. By using tax-exempt status <em>vel non </em>as the touchstone for access to government property, the majority seemingly opens wide the door to organizations that have not heretofore participated in the CFC. From religious organizations to public policy thinktanks, from museums to universities, the range of tax-exempt organizations is wide and diverse. And it is not at all clear how, under the majority\u2019s analysis of reasonableness, principled limitations to exclude any tax-exempt organization can be fashioned. By the judiciary\u2019s imaginative use of the First Amendment, the entrance to the federal workplace charitable drive has thus been thrown wide open to any organization that can display evidence of having passed into the safe harbor of section 501(c)(3). Perhaps there is no longer a need for churches to depend exclusively upon giving on Sunday; coupling the majority\u2019s analysis with the Supreme Court\u2019s holding in <em>Widmar v. Vincent, supra, </em>454 U.S. 263, 102 S.Ct. 269, 70 L.Ed.2d 440, suggests an attractive new vehicle for the effectuation of ecclesiastical stewardship drives.</p>\n<p id=\"b1364-8\">B.</p>\n<p id=\"b1364-9\">In contrast to the majority\u2019s conclusion, the government\u2019s showing in this case easily meets the deferential standard enunciated by the Supreme Court for restrictions on access to nonpublic forums. The government identifies three legitimate interests served by limiting access to the CFC so as to exclude advocacy groups. Importantly, the government has adduced substantial and at times overwhelming evidence that those interests will be impaired unless such groups are excluded from the campaign. <em>First, </em>the exclusion of legal advocacy groups promotes both the government\u2019s general interest in the present and future success of the charitable campaign and the government\u2019s specific interest in seeing that a maximum amount of charitable aid goes to the needy. <em>Second, </em>the exclusion promotes both the government\u2019s interest in minimizing the time the campaign draws away from federal workers\u2019 performance of their primary duties and the governmental interest in preventing disruption in the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1277\">*1277</page-number>workplace. <em>Third, </em>the exclusion aids the federal government in avoiding the appearance of political favoritism.</p>\n<p id=\"b1365-4\">The government\u2019s position on this appeal is, moreover, greatly strengthened by the procedural posture in which this case comes before us. The district court granted summary judgment in favor of the advocacy groups\u2019 position that their exclusion from the campaign was an unconstitutional abridgement of First Amendment rights. It is well settled that \u201cthe party who defended against the motion for summary judgment [in the trial court] will have the advantage of the [appellate] court\u2019s reading the record in the light most favorable to him, will have his allegations taken as true, and will receive the benefit of the doubt when his assertions conflict with those of the movant.\u201d <em>See </em>10A C. Wright &amp; A. Miller, Federal Practice and Procedure \u00a7 2761 (1983). The grant of summary judgment is to be upheld only if the record, when reviewed in this light, show \u201cthat there is no genuine issue as to any material fact and that the moving party is entitled to a judgment as a matter of law.\u201d Fed.R. Civ.P. 56(c). Because the government has presented abundant evidence on whether the inclusion of advocacy groups (1) threatens the viability of the campaign, (2) distracts federal employees from their primary duties, and (3) creates the appearance of political favoritism, this court can affirm the grant of summary judgment only by concluding that these three evils are legally irrelevant to the reasonableness of the government\u2019s determination to exclude advocacy groups.<footnotemark>22</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1365-9\">It is self-evident that the government has an interest in the success of the CFC.<footnotemark>23</footnotemark> From the evidence in this record, it is manifestly clear that inclusion of the advocacy groups caused both specific losses in the 1983 campaign<footnotemark>24</footnotemark> and threatened the success of the charitable campaign in the years to come. While the amount of contributions measured in constant dollars was un<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1278\">*1278</page-number>changed from the previous year,<footnotemark>25</footnotemark> boycotts in several localities caused sharp contribution declines in those areas, thus indicating that inclusion of advocacy groups did in fact cost the campaign money. For example, in Bremerton, Washington a union boycott caused contributions to drop by over twelve percent.<footnotemark>26</footnotemark> Contributions in Dade County, Florida also slipped considerably by virtue of the inclusion of controversial advocacy groups.<footnotemark>27</footnotemark> The Denver campaign reported that contributions from postal workers were down because of a boycott by a craft union<footnotemark>28</footnotemark> The International Association of Machinists and Aerospace Workers boycotted the campaign nationwide with consequences that defy calculation.<footnotemark>29</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1366-4\">The record, moreover, strongly suggests that without the exclusion of advocacy groups the disruption of the campaign will deepen in the future. These are not cas-sandrian fears. Uncontradicted evidence indicates that in many localities and agencies the 1983 campaign achieved success only because federal workers involved in the CFC, from local campaign heads to campaign workers, devoted extraordinary time and effort to enlisting and cajoling their colleagues to contribute to the CFC despite the inclusion of advocacy groups.<footnotemark>30</footnotemark> There was evidence that this level of support could not be sustained in the future.<footnotemark>31</footnotemark> The decline in the number of contributors to the campaign was viewed as a distressing signal of possible troubles ahead, representing an erosion of the base on which future campaigns depend.<footnotemark>32</footnotemark> Indeed, in thirteen of the twenty-one largest local CFC\u2019s on which information was available, the number of contributors declined.<footnotemark>33</footnotemark> The record further indicates that at least in some localities one important union, the American Federation of Government Employees, was persuaded to stay in the 1983 campaign but promised to boycott future campaigns if advocacy groups were not excluded.<footnotemark>34</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1366-11\">Thus, the government had received a substantial body of information which taken collectively suggested that the CFC faced <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1279\">*1279</page-number>difficulties in the future. The government should not be held powerless to forestall the serious erosion of future campaigns simply because the campaign did not immediately collapse under the weight of advocacy groups. In Justice Jackson\u2019s memorable phrase, the Bill of Rights is not a suicide pact, but neither should it be turned into an instrument for forced self-immolation at more deliberate speed.</p>\n<p id=\"b1367-4\">These concerns over the campaign\u2019s future were widely shared; contrary to the majority\u2019s implication, the concerns were in no way limited to the Administration in Washington. Local CFC administrators stated that the inclusion of advocacy groups placed a \u201cstumbling block\u201d in the \u201cpath of potential givers\u201d which would give them an excuse not to contribute.<footnotemark>35</footnotemark> The AFL-CIO, while not boycotting the campaign, stated that inclusion of advocacy groups \u201ccannot help but impair the enthusiasm with which trade union members respond to CFC solicitations.\u201d<footnotemark>36</footnotemark> The United Way, a seasoned veteran in the ways and means of charitable fundraising, indicated through its national chairman that the inclusion of advocacy groups threatened the \u201csocial compact\u201d between government, industry, and labor which has sustained charitable enterprises across the Nation.<footnotemark>37</footnotemark> Members of Congress expressed concern.<footnotemark>38</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1367-10\">In the face of these uniform and uncon-tradicted misgivings about the CFC\u2019s future, it is wholly unwarranted for the judiciary \u2014 the arm of the government intended by the Framers to be the least dangerous branch \u2014 to dismiss as unreasonable the remedial actions taken to protect the campaign from the wounds inflicted by an earlier district court decision that was not reviewed on appeal.<footnotemark>39</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1367-11\">The government likewise has an interest in minimizing the amount of time federal employees spend in soliciting their colleagues, for such solicitations are conducted \u201cduring duty hours.\u201d 5 C.F.R. \u00a7 950.103(e). An extra hour spent on fundraising for the CFC is presumably an hour not spent on other government business. The record is replete with evidence that the inclusion of advocacy groups required federal workers <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1280\">*1280</page-number>to spend time persuading unions not to boycott the campaign, explaining to skeptical workers how they could designate funds to avoid giving money to advocacy groups, and trying to help people surmount the psychological and emotional barriers which the inclusion of litigation advocacy groups firmly implanted in the way of charitable giving.<footnotemark>40</footnotemark> In the Portland, Oregon, area alone approximately 2,500 more hours were devoted by Federal employees to soliciting and managing the Portland area CFC.<footnotemark>41</footnotemark> Such an increase in federal employee time spent on the campaign would obviously represent on a national scale a very real and substantial additional burden on federal resources.</p>\n<p id=\"b1368-4\">While the record does not indicate that any specific contretemps occurred in the workplace because of the advent of advocacy groups into the CFC, facts exist which would, it seems to me, warrant the government\u2019s reasonably inferring the possibility of such occurrences. Union leaders denounced the inclusion of advocacy groups in terms reflecting neither detachment nor polite disinterestedness.<footnotemark>42</footnotemark> In at least one locality, pressure groups appeared outside the federal workplace, handing out pamphlets and pressing workers not to give to the CFC.<footnotemark>43</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1368-5\">Finally, the record suggests that the appearance of governmental favoritism toward advocacy groups is a genuine and deep concern. The AFL-CIO, the country\u2019s largest labor organization, opened a news release on the 1983 CFC with the following <em>pronuneiamento: </em>\u201cThe Reagan Administration has granted yet another opportunity to the far right wing to enrich itself, this time at the expense of federal and postal employees and the needy.\u201d<footnotemark>44</footnotemark> Others were even less complimentary about the presumed motives inspiring the introduction of advocacy groups into the CFC. One union leader colorfully described the CFC\u2019s inclusion of the National Right to Work Foundation as equivalent to inviting Jack the Ripper to an \u201cafternoon tea party for maiden ladies.\u201d<footnotemark>45</footnotemark> In contrast to <em>Lehman </em>where the Court found that the mere <em>possibility </em>of \u201clurking doubts\u201d of political favoritism was a reason for excluding political advertisements from rapid transit advertising panels, here the record contains the acrid comments of national union leaders who in plain English expressly charged the Administration with politically inspired favoritism.</p>\n<p id=\"b1368-10\">Of course, just as there is no suggestion in <em>Lehman </em>that Shaker Heights was actually parceling out advertising space on the basis of political beliefs, the record indicates that the CFC included in 1983 all advocacy groups that wanted to participate. But actual favoritism need not exist to warrant an exclusionary effort by government. The Supreme Court has recognized a legitimate government interest in avoiding the very appearance of favoritism even when none exists.<footnotemark>46</footnotemark> Indeed, it is highly significant that union leaders who had access to information and were presumably aware of the reasons prompting the inclusion of advocacy groups in the 1983 CFC still attributed the action to partisan motives. Suspicions har<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1281\">*1281</page-number>bored by national union leaders suggest that it may prove difficult indeed to persuade rank-and-file employees of the federal civil service that the inclusion of advocacy groups, particularly one with which an employee happens to disagree, did not occur for political reasons.<footnotemark>47</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1369-4\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b1369-5\">Finally, I turn to the argument, not relied upon by the majority, that exclusion of advocacy groups is not \u201cview-point neutral\u201d and is therefore impermissible even in a nonpublic forum.<footnotemark>48</footnotemark> The President\u2019s Executive Order excludes groups which are trying \u201cto influence the outcomes of elections or the determination of public policy through political activity, advocacy, lobbying or litigation on behalf of parties other than themselves .... \u201d Exec.Order No. 12,404 \u00a7 1(b), 48 Fed.Reg. 6,685 (1983). Since the exclusion operates to prevent groups which are advancing political or policy concerns through certain enumerated means, no matter what those concerns are, appellees cannot plausibly claim that the restrictions on access discriminate on the basis of political viewpoint, as commonly understood. Instead, appellees contend that the order violates \u201cviewpoint neutrality,\u201d because it discriminates against groups that choose to promote human welfare by litigation rather than other methods.</p>\n<p id=\"b1369-8\"><em>Litigation, however, is generally understood to be a means of obtaining a goal or promoting a viewpoint, rather than a viewpoint itself. </em>Even if appellees\u2019 argument is construed as the claim that they are engaged in advancing the implicit message that litigation is an excellent method of promoting human welfare, Supreme Court precedent demonstrates that restricting such a message does not constitute viewpoint discrimination. For instance, it might well be believed that partisan political activities promote human welfare; yet the Court has upheld restrictions that prohibit public employees from expressing their views on public affairs if the expression is directed toward party success \u201con the grounds that such restrictions are not aimed at particular parties, groups, or points of view.\u201d <em>United States Civil Service Commission v. National Association of Letter Carriers, </em>413 U.S. 548, 556, 93 S.Ct. 2880, 2886, 37 L.Ed.2d 796 (1973). Similarly, some might think that a completely non-censorious approach to materials dealing with human sexuality would promote human welfare; yet the Court upheld zoning restrictions on theaters displaying sexually explicit movies on the grounds that the restrictions \u201c[are] unaffected by whatever social, political, or philosophical message a film may be intended to communicate.\u201d <em>Young v. American Mini Theatres, Inc., </em>427 U.S. 50, 70, 96 S.Ct. 2440, 2452, 49 L.Ed.2d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1282\">*1282</page-number>310 (1976) (plurality opinion). In this case, the restriction on the CFC is unaffected by the \u201csocial, political, or philosophical message\u201d that groups wish to convey through \u201cadvocacy, litigation, or lobbying.\u201d As in <em>Young, </em>the restriction here is permissible.</p>\n<p id=\"b1370-4\">IV.</p>\n<p id=\"b1370-5\">None of the six Administrations that have conducted the federal charitable drive have voluntarily included advocacy groups. From this record, it appears that private employers generally do not allow advocacy groups to participate in the charitable drives conducted in their workplaces. Local administrators of the CFC from across the Nation attest persuasively to the fact that advocacy groups at a bare minimum befoul the atmosphere needed to conduct a successful charitable campaign. Their comments complain vehemently about the extra burdens imposed upon federal resources by inclusion of litigation advocacy groups. Non-government experts who know firsthand how to appeal to the human wellsprings of charitable giving protest that advocacy groups should not participate in the CFC.</p>\n<p id=\"b1370-6\">The majority evidently thinks it possesses an expertise which enables it to dismiss this accumulated wisdom from diverse and experienced sources, abundantly documented in the record, and to conclude that the government\u2019s restrictions are so blatantly unreasonable that they merit judicial disapprobation without benefit of trial. Convinced that I am not possessed of such expertise, and persuaded that the Constitution neither demands nor warrants today\u2019s result, I respectfully dissent.</p>\n<p id=\"b1370-7\">ADDENDUM A</p>\n<p id=\"b1370-8\">September 15, 1982</p>\n<p id=\"Akm\">The President of the United States</p>\n<p id=\"ajk-dedup-2\">The White House</p>\n<p id=\"ae9-dedup-0\">Washington, D.C. 20500</p>\n<p id=\"b1370-9\">Dear Mr. President:</p>\n<p id=\"b1370-10\">The Board of Governors of United Way of America, acting through its Executive Committee, has adopted the enclosed Resolution respectfully requesting Presidential action to amend Executive Order 12353 to limit eligibility for the Combined Federal Campaign to charitable agencies providing direct, human-care services in the fields of health and welfare, including health research.</p>\n<p id=\"b1370-12\">When Executive Order 12353, restructuring the Combined Federal Campaign, was issued on March 23, 1982, there were high hopes in your Administration that it would mark the beginning of a new era of cooperative effort and support for the program\u2019s charitable purposes. Certainly, those hopes were shared by the some twenty million dedicated volunteers in United Way organizations across the nation.</p>\n<p id=\"b1370-13\">Unfortunately, the Executive Order and the implementing regulations issued by the Director, U.S. Office of Personnel Management, have had an opposite and I am sure, unintended affect.</p>\n<p id=\"b1370-14\">We now find that the Combined Federal Campaign has become a source of intense controversy because of admission to the campaign of organizations whose principal purpose is other than the providing of direct human-care services and health research to persons and families in need of such services.</p>\n<p id=\"b1370-15\">Illustrative of the controversy is that organized labor, because of the admission to the campaign of the National Right To Work Legal Defense Foundation, now regards the campaign as having departed from its original charitable purpose of support for human-care services. As a result, some unions with hundreds of thousands of members including the National Association of Letter Carriers, have taken the position that the Combined Federal Campaign is no longer deserving of employee support and have directed a boycott of the campaign.</p>\n<p id=\"b1370-16\">The implications of these actions by organized labor can and do extend beyond the Combined Federal Campaign. Until now, in the cause of charity, leaders of government, industry, and labor have been able to put aside any difference between them on other matters. They have come together at <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1283\">*1283</page-number>the workplace in a social compact to assist the less fortunate in our society through support of charitable endeavors such as the Combined Federal Campaign as well as the annual nationwide United Way campaign. To jeopardize that compact appears clearly to run contrary to the national interest and to the goals of your Administration.</p>\n<p id=\"b1371-4\">Mr. President, on behalf of the more than 37,000 charitable health and welfare agencies that are participating members of United Way, we urge favorable consideration and appropriate action to clarify and amend Executive Order 12353.</p>\n<p id=\"b1371-5\">Sincerely,</p>\n<p id=\"b1371-6\">/s/ Donald V.

This year NANS again picketed the Federal buildings; however, after a meeting with their chairman and the CFC chairman they agreed to stop picketing and passing out the handbills. They are still adamant and will no doubt be active next year. The threat of boycott by unions was real. Only by hard work were we able to gain their outward support, but many of the rank and file members still reacted negatively.</p>\n<p id=\"b1371-18\">The steering away from the traditional health and welfare groups could spell the demise of the CFC as we have grown to know it. The loaned executives and key persons must at times face groups of employees who are staunch union members and they must overcome a negative attitude caused by CFC inclusion of advocacy groups.</p>\n<p id=\"b1371-19\">To be ultimately successful in a general fund drive all agencies must be noncontroversial. When advocacy groups or groups that stir up negative feelings because of religious or union affiliation are present, we place an undue stumbling block in the path of many potential givers.</p>\n<p id=\"b1371-20\">There is a growing concern on the part of Federal officials that if the CFC does not remove many of the controversial organizations, dire results will occur. Many people are looking for a chink in the CFC armor, and it appears that by including advocacy groups we play into their hands; and we provide the \u201cI\u2019ll give at home\u201d individual the excuse for not participating.</p>\n<p id=\"b1371-21\">We strongly urge the OPM [to] exert maximum efforts to exclude \u201call\u201d advocacy groups from the 1983 program.</p>\n<p id=\"b1371-22\">Sincerely,</p>\n<p id=\"b1371-23\">/s/ Sidney M. Ford</p>\n<p id=\"b1371-24\">Chairman</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1357-8\">. The government also argues that because the CFC represents a government subsidy to charity, the exclusion of certain organizations from the enjoyment of the fruits of the CFC is to be tested under the equal protection clause rather than the First Amendment and is permissible under the analysis of a recent Supreme Court decision, <em>Regan v. Taxation with Representation, -- </em>U.S. --, 103 S.Ct. 1997, 76 L.Ed.2d 129 (1983). In view of my conclusion that the CFC is a nonpublic forum and that the restrictions meet the \u201creasonableness\u201d test for public forums under the First Amendment, I do not reach the government\u2019s argument under <em>Regan.</em></p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b1357-12\">. <em>Perry </em>is the first Supreme Court case to use the term \u201cnonpublic forum.\u201d 103 S.Ct. at 957. <em>See also </em>note 3, <em>infra, </em>as to \u201climited public forums.\u201d Previous cases simply stated that a particular place was not a public forum. <em>See, e.g., United States Postal Serv. v.

First, if the forum is one in which speech has traditionally flourished, there is little danger that stringent judicial review resulting in greater \u201cspeech\u201d of some kind will alter the nature of the forum. However, the relative absence of public discourse in a forum suggests that it has a <em>bona fide </em>purpose other than communication. Second, restrictions on traditional forums may cut off crucial public debate, because such restrictions prevent people from expressing themselves in places upon which they have reasonably come to rely for public expression. If, however, the forum is not traditionally given over to public discourse, the restrictions will cause no displacement of speech, and the existence of traditional forums will provide the public with obvious alternative venues. Finally, the judiciary has great experience in dealing with traditional forums like parks and streets. However, it may be thought to possess less expertise concerning the nature of nonpublic forums. Therefore, a standard of review which gives more deference to the other branches of government that operate such forums would seem entirely appropriate.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b1358-11\">. Considering the capacity in which the government is operating the forum is also useful in determining the level of First Amendment scrutiny. If the government is operating the forum for the use of the public, strict scrutiny is, under binding precedent, reasonably required to ensure that the public in fact has access to the facility. However, when the government is operating a facility as a commercial venturer or employer, it is performing functions to which the public in general has no expectation of access.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b1358-12\">. If the forum is in fact being used indiscriminately by the public, there seems no reason to suspect that the introduction of more speakers will change the nature of the forum. <em>See also </em>note 4 <em>supra.</em></p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b1360-5\">.

Indeed, even where the government facility in question is an office whose purpose is to disseminate information, such as an Office of Public Affairs, it has never been the law that free, unimpeded access must be permitted to such offices on the part of the general public, or that only carefully crafted and narrow time, place or manner restrictions on access would be constitutionally permissible.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b1360-6\">.

The world of not-for-profit organizations had always included many other kinds of groups and institutions, of course, ranging from private schools and universities to opera guilds, sports associations, recreation societies, and many more, including the newer \u201cadvocacy groups\u201d such as legal defense funds and public policy research organizations, all of which number today in the many tens of thousands. But it had never been thought appropriate \u2014 and certainly not practical \u2014 for these kinds of institutions to participate in the Combined Federal Campaign, especially since they were not engaged in supplying health and welfare services directly to human beings who were ill, infirm, poor, or distressed, thereby lessening the burdens of government in meeting such needs.\u201d). II J.A. 385-86.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"12\">\n<p id=\"b1361-10\">. <em>Manual on Fund-Raising Within the Federal Service </em>\u00a7 5.21 (1977) (U.S. Government Printing Office No. 006-000-01024-5).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"13\">\n<p id=\"b1361-11\">. In <em>Campbell, </em>the district court impliedly premised its strict First Amendment scrutiny on the proposition that CFC was a public forum. 504 F.Supp. at 1367. I respectfully disagree with the learned district judge\u2019s conclusion in this respect. But in any event, it is clear that the government\u2019s alteration of the contours of the campaign in response to a decision declaring the campaign to be a public forum should not be taken into account in deciding whether the campaign is a public or nonpublic forum.</p>\n<p id=\"b1361-12\">Lest there be any misapprehension as to the significance of the fact that no appeal was maintained in <em>Campbell, </em>the Supreme Court has recently reminded us, in a unanimous opinion, that decisions by the Solicitor General to appeal or not to appeal are governed by a variety of factors which would not necessarily obtain as to a private litigant. <em>United States v. Mendoza, </em>-- U.S. --, --, 104 S.Ct. 568, 571, 78 L.Ed.2d 379 (1984).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"14\">\n<p id=\"b1362-5\">. See <em>also Greer v. Spock, supra, </em>424 U.S. at 838 n. 10, 96 S.Ct. at 1217 n. 10 (1976) (\u201cThe fact that other civilian speakers and entertainers had sometimes been invited to appear at Fort Dix ... surely did not leave the authorities powerless thereafter to prevent any civilian from entering Fort Dix to speak on any subject whatever.\u201d).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"15\">\n<p id=\"b1362-6\">. Such restrictions on expression are difficult to characterize as time, manner and place regulations but would normally be classified as pri- or restraints under traditional First Amendment analysis. If the CFC is categorized as a limited public forum with the stringent First Amendment scrutiny which that categorization implies, such regulations would likely not survive. <em>See, e.g., New York Times Co. v. United States, </em>403 U.S. 713, 91 S.Ct. 2140, 29 L.Ed.2d 822 (1971) (discussing the heavy presumption against prior restraints). Thus, categorization of the CFC as a public forum may endanger other regulations of the campaign, thereby radically altering its nature. Perhaps the majority\u2019s silence on the precise nature of the CFC in the federal workplace is the better part of valor in light of the havoc which would inevitably be wrought by applying a limited public forum analysis.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"16\">\n<p id=\"b1362-12\">. Commentators have noted the deferential standard applied to nonpublic forums. <em>See, e.g., Note, A Unitary Approach to Claims of First Amendment Access to Publicly Owned Property, </em>35 Stan.L.Rev. 121, 127 (1982) (characterizing \u201cscrutiny\u201d of nonpublic forums as \u201cweak\u201d); Cass, <em>First Amendment Access to Government Facilities, </em>65 Va.L.Rev. 1287, 1303 (1979) (noting that the Supreme Court grants little protection to speech when the place has been characterized as a nonpublic forum). Indeed, it would seem pointless to go to the trouble of distinguishing between public and nonpublic forums only to employ a stringent scrutiny analysis to restrictions of access to both types of facilities.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"17\">\n<p id=\"b1362-13\">. <em>See Greenburgh, supra, </em>453 U.S. at 131 n. 7, 101 S.Ct. at 2686 n. 7 (rejecting the \u201csignificant governmental interest\u201d test advanced by Justice Marshall in dissent).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"18\">\n<p id=\"b1363-5\">. <em>See Jones v. North Carolina Prisoners\u2019 Labor Union, Inc., </em>433 U.S. 119, 134, 97 S.Ct. 2532, 2542, 53 L.Ed.2d 629 (1977).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"19\">\n<p id=\"b1363-6\">. Indeed, in some nonpublic forum cases less restrictive alternatives have been suggested only to be ignored by the Court. <em>See, e.g., Lehman, supra, </em>418 U.S. at 321, 94 S.Ct. at 2726 (suggesting that the \u201cimpression of city endorsement can be dispelled by requiring disclaimers to appear prominently on the face of every advertisement\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b1363-7\">In this regard, the majority\u2019s postscript advances the view that under this analysis, <em>\u201cany </em>Government restriction on speech would survive scrutiny under the so-called deferential test enunciated by the dissent.\u201d Majority Op. at 1266 (emphasis in original). In rather heated terms, the majority takes umbrage with what is, in fact, a straight-forward analysis of governing precedent. After all, <em>Jones </em>flatly holds that the burden on the government in nonpublic forum cases is \u201conly [to] demonstrate a <em>rational basis </em>for their distinctions between organizational groups.\u201d 433 U.S. at 134, 97 S.Ct. at 2542 (emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b1363-8\">The majority\u2019s <em>sturm und drang </em>approach is misplaced. While judges should refrain from rendering advisory opinions, I have no difficulty at all in suggesting that, for example, the government\u2019s elimination from the CFC of only those charitable groups that assist members of discrete and insular minority groups would plainly run afoul of <em>Perry's </em>analysis. So would any exclusion based upon disagreement with the views or positions of the particular charitable organization, under the viewpoint-neutrality analysis set forth below. The majority therefore need not lose any sleep over concern that <em>Perry </em>ushers in an era of utterly unbridled discretion on the part of government officials. Neither <em>Perry </em>nor anything in this opinion, dispassionately read, suggests anything of the sort.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"20\">\n<p id=\"b1363-12\">. The Court\u2019s refusal to require evidence of disruption cannot be explained away as an instance of its extraordinary deference to the national interest in labor stability. To justify its refusal to require such evidence, the Court cited another nonpublic forum case, <em>Greer v. Spock, supra, </em>which did not require the production of evidence to prove that political speech would disrupt the military workplace. It will not do to tuck <em>Perry </em>away in a pigeonhole marked \u201cLabor Relations,\u201d and thus drain it of all efficacy outside the employment setting. <em>Perry\u2019s </em>locks are not so Samson-like to be so easily lopped off.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"21\">\n<p id=\"b1364-6\">. For a discussion of this evidence, see part I.C., <em>supra.</em></p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"22\">\n<p id=\"b1365-5\">. As shown in part II. A., <em>supra, </em>the Supreme Court has viewed such considerations as quite relevant to whether a restriction on access to a nonpublic forum is permissible.</p>\n<p id=\"b1365-6\">With respect to the summary judgment issue, the approach in this case stands in marked contrast to a very recent decision of this court overruling the district court\u2019s grant of summary judgment. See <em>Family Division Trial Lawyers of the Superior Court </em>\u2014 D.C., <em>Inc. v. Moul-trie, </em>725 F.2d 695 (D.C.Cir.1984). In that case, over my dissent, which was grounded on the conclusion that no evidence could sustain a constitutional attack on a voluntary court assignment system, this court showed great solicitousness for permitting a case to be made out by the attorneys-plaintiffs in the face of a motion for summary judgment by District of Columbia officials.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"23\">\n<p id=\"b1365-7\">. The majority seems to doubt that the government can promote the charitable campaign by excluding a class of organizations that pursue controversial and often mutually antagonistic policies. It cites many First Amendment cases which declare that the right to speak cannot be impaired because of the controversial nature of what the speaker has to say. <em>None of these cases, however, concern what is at issue here </em>\u2014 restrictions <em>on access to nonpublic forums. </em>A nonpublic forum is not designed to promote or even sustain controversial discourse but has other objectives. In this case, the objective is raising money for charity, and the government can legitimately pursue that objective at the expense of diversity of speech. In <em>Lehman, </em>418 U.S. at 304, 94 S.Ct. at 2718, the Court allowed a municipally-owned bus company to refuse political advertisements in favor of \u201cless controversial\u201d advertisements which would not endanger long term revenues, which was the objective of that nonpublic forum.</p>\n<p id=\"b1365-11\">Moreover, the majority blinks at reality in claiming that the controversial nature of the participation of advocacy groups does not stem from the nature of the groups themselves. <em>Groups that are promoting or opposing policies like affirmative action or the closed shop are controversial, for the plain reason that the arguments for and against such policies are controvertible in a way that arguments in favor of a policy of seeking a cure for cancer are not.</em></p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"24\">\n<p id=\"b1365-12\">. In the CFC, federal employees are solicited in the late fall of the year for a pledge of contributions that will then be deducted from the employee\u2019s paycheck in the following year. Thus, solicitations for the 1983 campaign took place in the fall of 1982. Because all active work on behalf of the 1983 campaign took place in 1982, people writing to the government about the campaign often refer to it as the \u201c1982 campaign.\u201d From the dates of their letters, it is clear that they are referring to the 1983 campaign.

The government has a rational basis for concluding that in general a dollar given to a traditional health and welfare charity will more certainly aid the needy than a dollar given to an advocacy group. The connection between the activities in which advocacy groups engage and aid for the needy is speculative for two reasons. First, the methods by which advocacy groups advance their policies are risky. In the course of litigation, lobbying, or influencing elections an advocacy group may spend a huge sum of money only to lose. Second, the policies such groups advance are often controversial in the sense that opinion is still divided over whether they aid the needy or not. Indeed, since many of these groups have antagonistic aims, it is simply not possible that all their policies are bringing net benefit to the needy. In view of the uncertainty over the effect of advocacy groups\u2019 policies on the plight of the needy, the government can rationally choose to exclude them from the CFC.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"40\">\n<p id=\"b1368-6\">. <em>See, e.g., </em>Letter of Wayne Hawkins, <em>supra </em>note 31; Letter from San Juan Romero, Chairman of the Greater Cincinnati Federal Executive Board to Donald Devine (Jan. 12, 1983) (\u201cMaking goal [sic], however, was due primarily to the inordinate amount of official time and effort put into the campaign by everyone concerned.
