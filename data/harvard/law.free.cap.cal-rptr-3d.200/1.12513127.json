A video recording of the interview shows Joseph sitting on a couch next to his stepmother, Krista McCary, whose husband Joseph had just killed. Riverside Police Detective Roberta Hopewell sat in an adjacent chair; she was courteous and not overbearing. At the beginning of the interview, Detective Hopewell informed Joseph of his\n   <em>\n    Miranda\n   </em>\n   rights, and he purported to waive them. (\n   <em>\n    Miranda v.

Here the petition for review and supporting letters contend that as a matter of \"social science and cognitive science\" as well as \"what 'any parent knows'-indeed, what any person knows-about children generally\" (\n   <em>\n    J.D.B., supra,\n   </em>\n   564 U.S. at p. ---- &amp; fn. 5, 131 S.Ct. at p. 2403 &amp; fn. 5 ), it is doubtful that Joseph understood or was capable of understanding the nature of\n   <em>\n    Miranda\n   </em>\n   rights and the consequences of waiving those rights. The petition further contends that the presence of Joseph's stepmother Krista during the interview does not aid the validity of the waiver because Krista had a conflict of interest and, in any event, sat silently and gave no advice as Joseph waived his rights.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   Having reviewed the transcript and video of the interview, I believe the issue of whether Joseph validly waived his\n   <em>\n    Miranda\n   </em>\n   rights subsumes several questions worthy of our review: (1) whether there is an age below which the concept of a voluntary, knowing, and intelligent waiver has no meaningful application, (2) whether and, if so, how the\n   <em>\n    Miranda\n   </em>\n   warnings and waiver decision can realistically be made intelligible to very young children, and (3) what role parents, guardians, or counsel should play in aiding a valid waiver decision by such children, and under what conditions a parent or guardian\n   would be unable to play that role. In\n   <em>\n    Lara,\n   </em>\n   we said \"the immaturity of most minors will make it desirable for those in custody to have the advice of counsel or other responsible adult,\" but we held that \"the presence or consent of counsel or other responsible adult\" is not invariably a requirement for a valid\n   <em>\n    Miranda\n   </em>\n   waiver by a juvenile.

In affirming the applicability of the totality-of-the-circumstances test to juvenile waivers,\n   <em>\n    Lara\n   </em>\n   discussed numerous cases involving minors as young as 14 but nowhere considered waivers by children in Joseph's age range.

A key issue in this case is whether\n   <em>\n    Lara\n   </em>\n   's rule that a valid\n   <em>\n    Miranda\n   </em>\n   waiver\n   does not invariably require the presence of counsel or an interested adult applies to children under age 14, including children as young as 10.

For the purpose of obtaining the waiver, in the case of juveniles who are under the age of fourteen, we conclude that no waiver can be effective without this added protection.... For cases involving a juvenile who has reached the age of fourteen, there should ordinarily be a meaningful consultation with the parent, interested adult, or attorney to ensure that the waiver is knowing and intelligent. For a waiver to be valid without such a consultation the circumstances should demonstrate a high degree of intelligence, experience, knowledge, or sophistication on the part of the juvenile.\"].)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   We have not extensively examined the issue of juvenile\n   <em>\n    Miranda\n   </em>\n   waivers since our decision in\n   <em>\n    Lara\n   </em>\n   almost a half-century ago. Although we are barred from adopting an exclusionary rule that is not required by the federal Constitution (Cal. Const. art. I, \u00a7 28, subd. (f)(2)), whether federal constitutional law requires the type of safeguards that other courts have adopted for children as young as Joseph is a question that neither the high court nor this court has examined. As noted, there were 613 felony arrests of children under age 12 in California in 2011, the year Joseph killed his father. In 2012, there were 523 such arrests; in 2013, there were 449; and in 2014, there were 381. (Cal. Dept. of Justice, Juvenile Justice in California (2012-\n   2014) p. 59, table 4; cf. Kim et al., The School-to-prison Pipeline: Structuring Legal Reform (2010).) The proper application of\n   <em>\n    Miranda\n   </em>\n   to children in Joseph's age range likely affects hundreds of cases each year, even though few such cases result in a trial and appeal. For these reasons, I vote to grant review.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   Finally, it bears mention that consideration of special safeguards for young children need not await judicial action. Many states have found the issue worthy of legislative attention. (See 705 Ill.Comp.Stat. 405/5-170 [child under age 13 suspected of serious crimes must be represented by counsel throughout the entire custodial process, including the reading of\n   <em>\n    Miranda\n   </em>\n   rights];\n   <extracted-citation index=\"69\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Iowa%20Code%20%C2%A7%20232.11\">\n    Iowa Code \u00a7 232.11\n   </extracted-citation>\n   [child under 16 cannot waive right to counsel without written consent of the child's parent]; Mont.Code \u00a7 41-5-331 [child under 16 can waive rights only with a parent's agreement; when a parent does not agree, the child can waive only after consulting with counsel]; N.M.

Gen.Stat. \u00a7 46b-137 [no statement of a child made during custodial interrogation is admissible in juvenile court unless a parent is present and advised of the child's rights]; Ind.Code \u00a7 31-32 [child's rights can be waived only by a parent or counsel unless the child has been emancipated]; N.C. Gen.Stat. \u00a7 7B-2101 [child under 14 cannot waive\n   <em>\n    Miranda\n   </em>\n   rights unless a parent or attorney is present]; Okla. Stat. tit. 10A, \u00a7 2-2-301 [advisement of rights of child 16 or younger attendant to custodial interrogation must take place in the presence of a parent, guardian, or counsel].) Our Legislature may wish to take up this issue in light of this court's decision not to do so here. (See Cal. Const. art. I, \u00a7 28, subd.
