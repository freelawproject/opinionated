C. Fry, tbe defendant in tbe criminal suit, was guilty of tbe offense with which he was charged, viz: The larceny of an oil well rig; and failing in this the verdict should be for the plaintiff.\u201d (3) In refusing the following offer of testimony on part of defendant: \u201cQ. Mr. Wolf, had you lost anything else from this same property at any time prior to this information? A. Yes, sir. Q. What had you lost? A. You mean from where the wood rig was taken? There was some second-hand cables there \u2014 \u25a0 By Mr. McQuistion: We object to that. By Mr. Galbreath: We propose to prove by the witness on the stand that at about the same time that he discovered this rig was gone he discovered also that a second-hand cable, which he also owned, and which was left at the same place on this lease, was taken away, and that he discovered that also in the possession of Mr. Fry\u2019s employees, and we also offer to show by the same witness, that prior to this time he lost, among other tilings, froth his boiler house on another lease in the same vicinity, a number of tools and parts of machinery, among others a set of elevators, and they were also found in the possession of Mr. Fry\u2019s employees. This for the purpose of showing probable cause for making an information in this case for this rig. By Mr. McQuistion: Objected to as incompetent and irrelevant, because they do not propose to show that the other property alleged to have been stolen was stolen by Mr. Fry, plaintiff in this case; but an attempt to show that employees of his had in their possession other property of the witness, and defendant in this case, and therefore it is incompetent, because Mr. Fry would not be bound by acts of his agent, if any were committed. And objected to further because the offer does not in any way attempt to connect Mr. Fry with the larceny of the articles mentioned in the offer. By the Court: We will sustain the objection and give an exception.\u201d</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b500-5\"><em>J. M.

W. </em>Lee, for appellant.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AGK\">The court\u2019s answer to the second point of the plaintiff below is objectionable in that it states the rule too strongly as to the degree of proof required by the defendant in order to show probable cause of the suit instituted by him. Being a civil action the defendant was only required to show <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"471\">*471</page-number>by the weight of the evidence, that he had probable cause for the prosecution: 1 Greenleaf on Evidence, 18. See also Heister v. Laird, 1 W. &amp; S. 245; Ott v. Oyer, 106 Pa. 6.</p>\n<decisiondate data-order=\"21\" data-type=\"decisiondate\" id=\"AA1K\">October 24, 1898:</decisiondate>\n<p data-order=\"22\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b501-5\">The court\u2019s answer to the plaintiff\u2019s second point is objectionable in that it excludes from the jury\u2019s consideration the -question of the defendant\u2019s want of malice, and is an explicit direction to find for the plaintiff unless the defendant has shown to their satisfaction the existence of probable cause. This contravenes the well-established principle that, in actions for damages for malicious prosecution, in order to a recovery the jury must find, not only that there was no probable cause for the prosecution, but also that the prosecutor was actuated by malice. The existence of malice and the want of probable cause must concur: McClafferty v. Philp, 151 Pa. 86; Cooper v. Hart, 147 Pa. 597; McCarthy v. DeArmit, 99 Pa. 63.</p>\n<p data-order=\"23\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b501-6\">Nothing is better settled than that when the prosecutor submits the facts to his attorney, who advises they are sufficient, and he acts thereon in good faith, such advice is a defense to an action for malicious prosecution: McClafferty v. Philp, 151 Pa. 86; Emerson v. Cochran, 111 Pa. 619.</p>\n<p data-order=\"24\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b501-7\">Whether or not there was probable cause for the prosecution depended not on the actual state of the case, but upon defendant\u2019s honest and reasonable belief.: Smith v. Ege, 52 Pa. 419; Mitchell v. Logan, 172 Pa. 349.</p>\n<p data-order=\"25\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b501-8\">The testimony, which the court refused, had a place in bringing defendant to a reasonable belief of plaintiff\u2019s guilt, and as such should have been admitted.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"26\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b501-9\"><em>Newton Black </em>with him Lev. <em>McQuistion, </em>for appellee.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"27\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AmIQ\">There is ample authority for the court\u2019s affirmance of the second point: Ritter v. Ewing, 174 Pa. 341; Barhight v. Tammany, 158 Pa. 545; Miller v. Hammer, 141 Pa. 196.</p>\n<p data-order=\"28\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b501-10\">Plaintiff\u2019s third point which was affirmed by the court below, is a fair statement of the requirements of law and is supported by Ritter v. Ewing, 174 Pa. 341, and McClafferty v. Philp, 151 Pa. 86.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"29\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<p id=\"b501-11\">Opinion by</p>\n<author id=\"A4k7\">Rice, P. J.,</author>\n<p id=\"b501-12\">If there is anything well settled in the law, it is, that malice and want of probable cause must be proved in order to entitle <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"472\">*472</page-number>a plaintiff to recover damages for a malicious prosecution. \u201cThese are essential and must co-exist:\u201d Auer v. Mauser, 6 Pa. Superior Ct. 618. The lawful discharge of the defendant in the prosecution, by the examining magistrate, is prima facie evidence of want of probable cause, and the burden of proof that there was probable cause, as a general rule, is then cast on the defendant in the action: Auer v. Mauser, supra; Bernar v. Dunlap, 94 Pa. 329; Barhight v. Tammany, 158 Pa. 545. He failed to show this to the satisfaction of the jury, and therefore this essential may be considered as established by the verdict. As the terms \u201cprobable cause\u201d are defined in Smith v. Ege, 52 Pa. 419, and the cases there cited, it is difficult to see how any other conclusion could be drawn from the facts given in evidence by the defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b502-5\">In this connection we might as well dispose of the third assignment of error.</p>\n<p id=\"b502-6\">It is true the question whether or not there was probable cause does not depend on the actual state of the case in point of fact. The test is the prosecutor\u2019s belief of its existence at the time. But this must be based upon reasonable grounds, and we agree with the court below that the mere fact that other articles, missed by the defendant at different times, were found in the possession of various enployees of the plaintiff\u2019s company would have no legitimate tendency to induce a reasonable belief in the mind of any prudent man \u2014 knowing what the defendant did of the plaintiff\u2019s rights and possession under his contract \u2014 that the latter was guilty of stealing this derrick, when he caused it to be removed in broad daylight and set up on an adjacent property. The court committed no error in rejecting this offer.</p>\n<p id=\"b502-7\">Was the prosecution malicious? Something more than mere legal or theoretical malice is requisite to sustain an action of this kind, for it must be proved as a fact, and, while it may be inferred from a want of probable cause, its existence, nevertheless, is for the jury: Schofield v. Ferrers, 47 Pa. 194; Bernar v. Dunlap, supra; McCarthy v. DeArmit, 99 Pa. 63; Emerson v. Cochran, 111 Pa. 619; Cooper v. Hart, 147 Pa. 594. \u201c While the former\u201d \u2014 want of probable cause \u2014 \u201cis evidence of malice proper to be submitted to the jury, it does not establish legal malice to be declared by the court:\u201d McClafferty v. Philp, 151 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"473\">*473</page-number>Pa. 86. This statement of the rule was reiterated in Ritter v. Ewing, 174 Pa. 341. Hence it is erroneous to instruct the jury that where the defendant in the prosecution was discharged by the magistrate the plaintiff is entitled to' recover unless the defendant in the action prove to their satisfaction that there was probable cause for the arrest. This assumes, that if this be lacking, malice must necessarily be implied \u2014 a proposition not sustained by the authorities. It has been said that \u201cthe absence of probable cause being shown, malice will ordinarily be inferred unless there be extenuating circumstances, as that the prosecutor submitted the facts fully to counsel learned in the law and acted under his advice:\u201d Mahaffey v. Byers, 151 Pa. 92. Let this be granted, nevertheless, it is an inference of fact to be drawn by the jury, and not a presumption of law, and there is nothing in the case last cited to indicate that the court intended to lay down a different rule.</p>\n<p id=\"b503-5\">Moreover, the defendant in the action gave evidence of precisely such extenuating circumstances as are referred to hi that ease. If hi good faith the prosecutor seeks, obtains and honestly follows tiie advice of competent counsel on a full and fair statement of all the facts within his knowledge, or which he has reason to believe he is able to prove, and omits none which, with reasonable diligence, he could ascertain or discover, the advice so received will constitute a defense to the action: Beihoffer v. Loeffert, 159 Pa. 374; Barhight v. Tammany, supra; McClafferty v. Philp, supra. Such advice is sometimes called probable cause, but in strictness it rebuts the inference of malice arising from want of probable cause: McCarthy v. DeArmit, supra.</p>\n<p id=\"b503-6\">It is claimed that the defendant could not set up the advice of counsel as a defense, because (1) he did not inform him that Fry had told him that if his men had taken the rig he would pay for it; and (2) did not show him the written contract under which the plaintiff\u2019s company held possession of the property from which the rig was removed. This contract was in the form of a receipt for $2,800, in payment for two gas wells, and contained this clause: \u201cThe condition of this sale is, that when the gas is exhausted the wells are to be returned to me free from rentals due as they are delivered.\u201d The counsel who advised the prosecution and drew the information tes<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"474\">*474</page-number>tilled that while the written contract was not shown him he was informed by the defendant that he had sold the gas in a certain lease, and that the rig had been taken away. It is apparent from his testimony taken as a whole that he was informed of all the facts material to the question upon which his advice was asked which the paper itself would have disclosed. As to the other objection, it is sufficient to say, that he had knowledge of the substance of the conversation referred to from the plaintiffs own letters before the prosecution was begun. Without going further into detail, there was evidence, which, if believed by the jury, was sufficient to rebut any inference of malice, which, without it, might arise from the absence of probable cause. The learned judge correctly affirmed the defendant\u2019s point which was drawn substantially in the language of the decision in Beihoffer v. Loeffert, supra. But in affirming the plaintiff\u2019s third point he also told the jury that the defendant \u201cmust show such conduct on the part of the accused as would warrant an ordinarily prudent man in believing that H. C. Fry .... was guilty of the offense with which he was charged; .... \u2018and failing in this the verdict should be for the plaintiff.\u201d The defendant may have failed to show such conduct on the part of the plaintiff and he may also have acted under the advice of counsel. In such a case, which instruction was the jury to follow; find a verdict for the plaintiff or for the defendant? Perhaps the jury understood that the affirmance of this point was subject to the qualification implied in the affirmance of the defendant\u2019s point, and doubtless the learned judge intended them so to understand, but through inadvertance he omitted to say so. Again, in affirming this, as well as the second point, they were told, in effect, that if there was not prohable cause they should find for the plaintiff. \u201c This,\u201d to adopt the language of Mr. Justice Strong, \u201c was leaving out of view the second essential to the maintenance of such an action, namely, whether the prosecution was instituted maliciously, a question always for the jury, and one which must be proved affirmatively to entitle the plaintiff to a verdict. It is true that want of probable cause is evidence of malice, but it is not malice itself. It is to be submitted to the jury for them to draw the proper inference:\u201d Schofield v. Ferrers, supra. So that, even if the evidence as to the advice of coun<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"475\">*475</page-number>sel were out of the case, or we were to assume that the defense founded thereon was not made out to the satisfaction of the jury, still, the question of the defendant\u2019s malice ought to have been submitted to the jury, and'the points should have been negatived or at least qualified. For these reasons the first and second assignments of error are sustained.</p>\n<p id=\"b505-5\">The judgment is reversed, and a venire facias de novo awarded.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
