Moyer to sell liquor at retail, the petition setting forth that \u201c on the evening of March 19, 1898, the said Moyer did sell liquors and intoxicating drinks ,to H. B. McManagel, and others all of whom are under the age of twenty-one years andhaving the appearance of being minors.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b505-12\">The court below granted a rule on such petition to show cause why such license should not be revoked and after .hearing on testimony taken made the rule absolute, the court below filing an opinion.</summary>\n<decisiondate data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"decisiondate\" id=\"A9c\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"476\">*476</page-number>October 24, 1898:</decisiondate>\n<summary data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b506-4\"><em>Errors assigned </em>among others were (1) in finding the appellant chargeable with negligence.

That there was no negligence by the proprietor or even the bartender is clearly proven by the evidence.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b506-7\"><em>F. P.

J.,</author>\n<p id=\"b506-9\">This is an appeal from an order revoking a retail liquor license. The petition alleged all the facts necessary to give the court jurisdiction. The respondent was accorded a full opportunity to be heard and the proceedings were in all respects regular. In short, the record shows that the court kept within the limits of its jurisdiction and proceeded with regularity according to law. The question as to the respoiident\u2019s .negligence in the sale of liquor to these minors was one of fact and for the exclusive determination of the court of quarter sessions and its finding is not reviewable upon appeal, for the reason that an appeal in such a case is but a mere substitute for a certiorari and does not bring up the evidence. Finding no error in the record and no abuse of discretion being apparent, the order is affirmed and the appeal dismissed at the costs of the appellant.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
