The gravamen of the action, as alleged by the plaintiff, was \u201cthat the defendant, after issuing a warrant, on the application of the plaintiff, for the arrest of one Louisa DeYoung, charged with malicious mischief, wilfully and deliberately refused, at the hearing thereof before him, to hear all the testimony offered by the plaintiff, and discharged the prisoner, without the hearing of testimony which was material to the case, he at the time acting in a rude, violent and insulting manner, submitting the plaintiff to personal indignities and holding him up to contempt and ridicule in the presence of various persons who, at the time, were pres <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"510\">*510</page-number>ent. Notice to make amends within thirty days, as required by the act of March 21, 1772, was duly served on defendant.\u201d</summary>\n<decisiondate data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"decisiondate\" id=\"AGv\">November 14, 1898:</decisiondate>\n<summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b540-5\">The court left the question of defendant\u2019s liability to the jury subject to the opinion of the court as to the plaintiff\u2019s right of action against a magistrate for the cause shown. The jury rendered a verdict in favor of plaintiff for $1.00.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b540-6\">The court subsequently entered judgment for defendant non obstante veredicto.

The general rule both in this country and- in England is, that justices of the peace while acting within the scope of their authority are not answerable in damages for the merely erroneous exercise of purely judicial functions. There is nothing in this case to take it out of the general rule. The gravamen of the plaintiff\u2019s complaint was that the magistrate dismissed the prosecution without permitting him ,to call all of his witnesses. While there was sufficient evidence to warrant a finding that the plaintiff was not permitted to call all of his witnesses it also shows that all the facts that could have been proved by the testimonv of the\u2019 excluded witnesses were testified to by the wit<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"511\">*511</page-number>nesses sworn. In effect, therefore, the cause of action was the exclusion of cumulative testimony. Whether this was right or wrong, we all agree that in the absence of proof of fraud or corruption, the fact that the manner of the magistrate was rude and his judgment mistaken, would not give the prosecutor a right of action.</p>\n<p id=\"b541-5\">The judgment is affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
