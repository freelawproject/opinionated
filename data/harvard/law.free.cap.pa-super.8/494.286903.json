Cleaiy, an undertaker, an order directing him to give deceased \u201ca first-class funeral, leaving the cost for the same entirely with him, and any amount he may ask or charge for his services will be perfectly satisfactory to me. (Signed) John Cullen.\u201d At Mr. Cullen\u2019s request and by his renunciation, Cleary took out letters of administration and took credit in his account as administrator for his bill as undertaker for $810.90.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b524-12\">The auditing judge, Ashman, J., filed the following adjudication :</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b524-13\">The account of Thomas R. Cleary, administrator, was called for audit before Ashman, J., February 14 and 16, 1898, and March 18, 1898.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b525-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"495\">*495</page-number>Counsel appeared as follows:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b525-5\">Horace M. Rumsey, Esq., representing Hon. F. Cabjroll Bkewstee., for tlie accountant.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b525-6\">Wm. Gorman, Esq., for John, Joseph and Alice Cullen, brothers and sister of the decedent.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b525-7\">Mary Cullen, as appears by the annexed affidavit of John Cullen, died November 7, 1896, unmarried and without issue, leaving as her sole surviving next of kin under the intestate laws two brothers, John and Joseph, and one sister, Alice Cullen.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b525-8\">At the hearing the auditing judge was asked to decide the question of what constitutes a \u201c first-class funeral,\u201d that being the alleged term used in the contract under which the undertaker, who is also the administrator, buried the decedent;</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"AmH\">The question happens in this instance to be very sharply defined, because no doubt exists as to the decedent\u2019s social status nor as to her pecuniary means. Her position was that of a domestic servant and her fortune consisted of $1,167.36 cash in the saving fund, together with clothing, household furniture and an umbrella which were valued altogether at $3.25. Her funeral cost $810.90. Her surviving sister and brothers complain that this expenditure evinced a want of economy in the administrator, by which their several shares in her estate will be \"reduced to the meager sum of $41.57 with a further diminution from counsel fees. Several undertakers were called by the accountant as experts to define the qualities of a first-class funeral. Their testimony was even more vague than that which is usually given by experts. One of them divided all funerals into two classes. He said, \u201cthere is funerals, and there are funerals,\u201d but he did not say whether, in his opinion, this funeral belonged to the first or the second of these divisions. The ex-ceptants, in order to provide materials for the judgment of the experts whom they also produced, opened the grave of the decedent more than a year after the interment and exhumed the coffin; and the casket and its contents, exclusive of the corpse, were duly appraised. The prospect afforded by this proceeding is not reassuring to future decedents. The church, as it did here, may offer up prayers for the repose of their souls, but neither the church nor the state can secure the repose of their bodies when the bill of an undertaker is at stake. In no light <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"496\">*496</page-number>to which the credit claimed in the account for this outlay may be exposed, can it be sustained. To take that which was attempted to be cast upon it by the claimant himself, it appeared that the body was sent to his rooms by the woman at whose house the decedent had died. He had an interview with the decedent\u2019s brother, who told him that he was the decedent\u2019s sole surviving relative; that he had not seen his sister for many years ; that he did not believe she had left an3r money, or at least so much as the undertaker asserted; and that he did not care to take out letters of administration nor to attend to the funeral. He thereupon renounced in favor of the undertaker his right to letters and he made his mark to a paper drawn up by the accountant requesting the latter to bury the decedent and \u201c to furnish such articles as may be necessary for a first-class funeral, leaving the cost for the same entirely with the undertaker.\u201d Undoubtedly the general proposition is true that a man may direct the expenditure of as much o\u00a3 his money as he pleases in celebrating his funeral and that a relative may contribute the whole of his share in an estate towards the burial of his testator ox intestate, but he must first know what he is doing. In this instance the brother could neither read nor write and believed that his sister had died poor. His idea of the equipment for a first-class funeral for his deceased sister as shown by a paper which he and his messenger swore was given to the undertaker, but which the latter denied having received, was entirely reasonable, and if adopted would have accorded her a respectable interment.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b526-5\">The undertaker\u2019s views were on a larger scale.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b526-6\">For an obscure woman who had lived in a single room in a back street, he provided a casket at $500 and a burial robe at $40.00. Five relatives, in all, attended at the funeral, yet he furnished twelve carriages, six professional pall bearers and an usher, and-he charged $10.00 for his personal supervision. There was also a charge of $20.00 for chairs, bouquets and candelabra. If the testimony for the exceptants is reliable every one of these amounts was an overcharge. But the real question is one of good faith. The accountant was administrator, and it was no part of his official business to make money out of his trust. Long before the body was removed from his rooms, he was notified that other relatives besides the brother <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"497\">*497</page-number>existed; so that he was not protected even by the improvident agreement of the brother, if it was ever made. In awarding, as administrator, a contract to himself as undertaker, which involved the funds of the estate, he was bound to see that its terms were at least such as a prudent trustee would, under the circumstances, have expected from a stranger. It is unpleasant to be compelled to make these criticisms, and still more unpleasant to be forced to act upon them ; but under the evidence which was submitted the largest allowance which can reasonably be granted for the expenses of the decedent\u2019s burial, exclusive of the sum paid for masses, which will stand, is $200, and the balance of the credit, $585.90, must be striken out. Of the many cases which might be cited as apposite, it is sufficient to refer to Hasson\u2019s Estate, 5 C. C. Rep. 19, where the balance of the fund was $1,500, and the undertaker\u2019s claim, $475.75, was reduced to $150.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b527-5\">Exceptions were filed to the adjudication as follows:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b527-6\">1. The learned auditing judge erred in finding \u201c long before the body was removed from his (the undertaker\u2019s) rooms, he was notified that other relatives besides the brother existed.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"21\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b527-7\">2. The learned auditing judge erred in not allowing the credit of $810.90 for the funeral expenses of decedent.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"22\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b527-8\">3. The learned auditing judge erred in allowing only the sum of $200 for said funeral expenses.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"23\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b527-9\">These exceptions were dismissed in th\u00e9 following opinion by Hanna, P. J.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"24\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b527-10\">In this case the administrator is the undertaker, who assumed the risk of retaining for his own use the sum of $810.90 out of an estate of $1,167.36, for the expenses of the funeral and interment of the decedent. And his only authority for the expenditure of so large a proportion of the estate is the alleged assent of a brother of decedent that he should take out letters of administration and furnish his sister \u201c a first-class funeral.\u201d No thought, apparently, was given to the rights of another brother and sister, who were equally interested. The decedent was a domestic servant at the time of her death, and her estate consisted of her savings deposited from time to time in a saving fund. The room she occupied when not employed was so inconvenient and illy adapted for the purpose that her <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"498\">*498</page-number>funeral took place from the office of the undertaker. And while the magnificence of the surrounding ceremonies and cost of her interment might well have gratified her vanity, yet we can but think the lavish outlay of expense would have been a severe shock to her noti\u00f3ns of thrift and economy. She certainly never contemplated her remains would repose in a \u201c cedar couch casket, heavily draped, lined with white silk, with raised name plate oxidized, and gold extension bar handles, and silk pillow,\u201d at a cost of \u00a7500, nor that they would be embalmed at a further expense of $50.00. Nor that an imposing cortege of twelve carriages would be provided, together with six professional pall bearers, each adorned with a buttonhole bouquet, while the procession of mourning relatives numbered but five persons, but not similarly ornamented. This was evidently an oversight of the undertaker.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"25\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b528-5\">In addition to this we are inclined to believe that amid the many details of this elaborate and munificently arranged ceremony, while the undertaker perhaps intended to inter the remains of the decedent in the cedar couch casket with gold extension bar handles, etc., yet through some inadvertence a casket of a very different and far inferior character was substituted. Whether from information received or suspicion that so costly a casket had not been used by him and charged for, during the hearing before the auditing judge at the instance of the surviving relatives of the decedent, her grave was opened and her remains exhumed, when it was discovered she had been interred in an ordinary couch casket with satin lining and covered with black cloth. It was constructed of chestnut or poplar instead of cedar, and with six oxidized silver handles in place of gold extension bar handles. The entire cost of which, as testified to, would be about the sum of \u00a7150. In view of this testimony, which is uncontradicted except by the undertaker himself, and upon which but little reliance can be placed, we think the claim has been liberally and generously dealt with. Parties interested in the estates of the dead, whether as widow, children, legatees, distributees or creditors, will be protected against such exorbitant and rapacious, if not fraudulent, bills for funeral expenses as here presented. And it is time it is clearly understood that only such a sum will be allowed for funeral expenses, cost of cemetery lot, erection of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"499\">*499</page-number>monument, etc., as will bear a just, fair and reasonable proportion to the amount of the estate of the decedent and his or her station in life. Undertakers should also realize they take the risk of the estate proving insolvent, in which case as against creditors they will be held strictly to the requirements of the rule. In this connection it is only necessary to say that this is no novelty in the procedure in this court and has been enforced in a number of instances: Bradley\u2019s Est., 11 Phila. 87, Hirst\u2019s Est., 12 W.
