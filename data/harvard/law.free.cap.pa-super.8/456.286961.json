(2) Refusal of plaintiff\u2019s second point, which point is as follows : \u201c 2.

That even if Robert H. Reedy did agree to pay $200 on this mortgage of June 16,1875, said promise is barred by the statute of limitations.\u201d (5) In the general charge as follows: \u201c Now, we say to you as a matter of law, that if this evidence is correct, you believe it, that this arrangement was entered into by R. H. Reedy to pay these $200 to him, and that the way he was to pay it was by giving a credit of $200 upon the mortgage, then the defendant here is entitled to the credit.\u201d (6) In admitting the bond and mortgage of Daniel J. Reedy to Anna W. Reedy, and the receipts thereon, said offer, objection and ruling being as follows: \u201cWe have two mortgages here which we offer, just the instruments; there is one from Daniel J. Reedy to Anna W. Reedy, the bond and mortgage. The purpose is to show two receipts on them, dated June 16, 1875. The purpose is, that it is part of the res gestas, being the transaction here upon which we claim this credit. It is to corroborate our theory and statement as to the fact that there was an agreement entered into with these people at that time. It is all of the same transaction. Mr. P\u00e1tton : We object to it as irrelevant, being a mortgage and bond from Daniel J. Reedy to Anna W. Reedy, and being res inter alios acta. By the Court: It is not offered for the purpose of showing a payment, but it is only in the nature of persuasive evidence, having happened at the same time, and we think it will have to be admitted. We will overrule the objection and admit the evidence, and on the request of plaintiff, exception allowed and sealed.\u201d The receipt covered by the said offer being as follows: \u201c June 16, 1875, received on the within mortgage' two hundred dollars being over-work after he was of age.

Reedy.\u201d (7) In the general charge in calling the attention of the jury only to the evidence on part of the defendant and in not calling their attention to the evidence of the plaintiff in rebuttal.</summary>\n<decisiondate data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"decisiondate\" id=\"ALX_\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"458\">*458</page-number>October 10, 1898:</decisiondate>\n<attorneys data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b488-4\"><em>W.

S.

In pursuance thereof, the defendant gave mortgages to his brother and sisters to secure the amount of the difference in value between the portions of said real estate taken by himself and them respectively. The present action is a scire facias upon one of those mortgages. It is alleged that, after the mortgages were given and on the day upon which they were acknowledged, a family meeting was held, in which it was agreed that the defendant should be allowed out of the estate of his father $800 for services rendered by him to his father after he reached his majority, of which said sum his brother and sisters should each pay the sum of $200, making with Ms own share the entire amount. The mortgage upon wMch this scire facias was issued was admittedly paid, except $200, so that, if the alleged family arrangement were actually made and the agreement were bmding upon the mortgagee, there could be no recovery.</p>\n<p id=\"b489-5\">Was such an agreement made? This was the controlling fact in the case and was found by the jury in favor of the defendant. If it was, it was a family agreement \u2014 not an agreement between the defendant and his brother. As was observed by Mr. Cliief Justice Thompson in Shartel\u2019s Appeal, 64. Pa. 25: \u201cAll compromises and settlements by families are maintained not only as beneficial to themselves but the law seeks to sustain them as conducing to peace and harmony where it ought most especially to exist.\u201d The testimony as to the family agreement was clear and the acts of the sisters of the defendant, as shown by their receipts upon the mortgages given by the defendant to them, were corroborative of the oral testimonj- upon the subject. In the case above cited, the acts of the other heirs M failmg to make complaints in regard to the distribution are spoken of as strengthening the presumption that the said distribution was fairly and honestly made. The acts of the other heirs in carrying out the agreement alleged to have been made for the compensation of the defendant for the services rendered to his father, after he attained his majority, were, we think upon the same principle, competent testimony as to the fact of such an agreement having been made. They would, of course, have been irrelevant, if the alleged agreement had been an independent one made between the defendant and the brother whose administrator sued out the scire facias upon the mortgage. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"460\">*460</page-number>They were offered as part of the res gestee and, the real question being the family agreement, we think they were properly admitted as such.</p>\n<p id=\"b490-5\">The alleged agreement was made about the time the administrator had settled the estate of the father. Whether or not he had funds in his hands out of which the claim of the defendant could have been paid does not appear, but undoubtedly the real estate in the hands of the heirs would have been ultimately liable for the claim of the defendant, whether there were funds in the hands of the administrator out of which it could have been paid or not. There was, therefore, a good and* valuable consideration for the agreement. If the agreement were actually made, as the jury has found, it was equivalent to a payment upon the mortgage and the failure of the mortgagee to credit it did not in any sense invalidate the agreement. An acknowledgment of payment upon a mortgage in parol is, of course, landing upon the person making the acknowledgment and is not, in any sense, equivalent to a release of a mortgage, by which we understand the release of the lien of a mortgage is meant. The statute of limitations did not apply, inasmuch as it was not an agreement to pay but an acknowledgment of payment on account of the mortgage.</p>\n<p id=\"b490-6\">This disposes of all of the assignments of error, except the seventh, as to which it may be said that the charge of the court is not open to serious objection for failure to call the attention of the jury to the evidence of the plaintiff in rebuttal. This testimony did not in any way seriously deny the agreement under which the defendant claimed the payment of $200. It all related to the failure of the defendant to claim the credit, after the death of his brother and at the first interview with the administrator in regard to the balance due. It was before the jury for their consideration and the effect of it was not in any sense minimized by the court. The jury may have believed, as they could reasonably have done, that the defendant\u2019s explanation of his failure to claim the credit at the first effort at settlement was probable and that his conduct was not inconsistent in any way with the alleged agreement.</p>\n<p id=\"b490-7\">All things considered, we think the case was fairly submitted to the jury and' that their finding should not be disturbed.</p>\n<p id=\"b490-8\">Judgment affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
