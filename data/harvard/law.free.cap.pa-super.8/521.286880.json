Before Biddle, P. J. and Arnold, P. J.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b552-6\">It appears from the record that an application for retail liquor license in the usual form was filed on February 9, 1898. On March 8, 1898, the remonstrance of Hiram DeWalt was filed assigning as reasons that the place was not necessary for the entertainment of strangers or travelers and was not designed or fitted for the entertainment of strangers or travelers, but for the business of selling by retail in small quantities spirituous and intoxicating liquors; that any act of assembly authorizing such a place to be licensed should be adjudged unconstitutional and void. On March 28, a hearing was had on the petition and remonstrance, and on May 2,1898, the petition was granted. Hiram DeWalt appealed.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b552-7\"><em>Errors assigned </em>among others were (1) in granting the license. (5) In not holding that the act of assembly entitled \u201c An act to restrain and regulate the sale of vinous and spirituous, malt or brewed liquors, or any admixture thereof,\u201d was unconstitutional.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b552-8\"><em>Hiram De Wali, P. </em>P.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AWO\">The retail liquor saloon or dram shop is a common nuisance: License Cases, 5 Howard, 504, 626; Mugler v.

Kansas, 123 U. S. 623.</p>\n<p data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b553-5\">A dram shop always depreciates the value of surrounding property and produces an iinmoral effect upon the community.</p>\n<p data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b553-6\">It cannot be contended that license acts must be constitutional because they have existed more than two hundred years. This proposition is established by Somerset v. Stewart, Loft. 1.</p>\n<p data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b553-7\">No legislature can bargain away the public health or the public morals: Stone v. Mississippi, 101 U. S. 814.</p>\n<p data-order=\"21\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b553-8\">Unless the courts can decide that the tippling house or dram shop conserves the public health or the public morals, they should declare any act of assembly authorizing or establishing it unconstitutional or void.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"22\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b553-9\">No paper-book or appearance for appellee.</attorneys>\n<opinion data-order=\"23\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b553-10\">Per Curiam,</author>\n<p id=\"b553-11\">The record shows a petition in the form prescribed by the statute, and an order granting the license after due hearing. As the evidence given on the hearing is not before us, the decision of the court upon the questions of fact raised by the remonstrance is not reviewable. And notwithstanding the very earnest argument of the appellant, who appeared in person, we see no reason to doubt the constitutionality of the law under which the license was granted. The power of the state to regulate the sale of intoxicating liquors, and, in the exercise of that power, to authorize the granting of licenses to fit persons under such conditions as the legistature may impose is too well settled to be open to discussion.</p>\n<p id=\"b553-12\">Finding no error in the record the order is affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
