The portion of the will causing the dispute is i\u00f1 these' words: \u201c I will, give and bequeath unto my beloved wife, Mariann Hartman, all my property, real, personal and mixed, of whatever nature and wherever the same may be at the time of my death, to enjoy <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"171\">*171</page-number>the same during her natural life, but not to dispose of any real estate, except it be with the consent of at least one of the co-executors, and who shall in such case join in the deed of conveyance of any property so sold; and I enjoin on my wife and her co-executors that they shall collect promptly all debts owing to me and invest the same in safe loans at interest, which said interest shall be used for the maintenance of my wife and children.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b201-5\">Judgment was obtained for the plaintiff for $560.08 and an attachment was issued on the said judgment, naming as garnishees, Maria Hartman and Anthony Kunzler, executors of Peter Hartman and the German Savings and Deposit Bank of Birmingham. Defendant claimed the benefit of the exemption act. Answers to the interrogatories filed were to the effect that the only property of defendant held by garnishee was ten shares of stock in said German Savings and Deposit Bank of Birmingham, still standing on the books of said bank, in the name of Peter Hartman, and having a market value of $1,600, there having accrued thereon dividends amounting to $270. After argument of the rule at the suggestion of the court, the following stipulation was made and entered into by and between the parties and duly filed: \u201c And now, February 28,1898, upon argument of the rule for judgment upon the answers heretofore filed, it is understood that the sole question for the determination of the court is whether under said will of Peter Hartman, the defendant took an absolute estate in the stock described in the answers or only a life estate therein; in the former case the rule shall be made absolute, and in the latter case, judgment shall be entered for defendant and garnishees. Reserving to each party the right to appeal to the higher courts.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b201-6\">Judgment.was entered in favor of the defendant and garnishees and against plaintiff with costs.

In this case it may be that \u201c his idea was that after his wife\u2019s death his \u2022 children would take the property,\u201d as held by the court below, but is this what he says in his will? 'We think not. The will provides: \u201c I will, give, and bequeath unto my beloved wife, Mariann Hartman, all my property, real, personal and mixed, of whatever nature and wherever the same may be at the time of my death, to enjoy the same during her natural life.\u201d Then follows a restriction that the real estate shall only be sold with consent of the coexecutor. Finally the testator directs that the wife and her coexecutor \u201c shall collect promptly all debts. owing to me, and invest the same in safe loans at interest, which said interest shall be used for the main<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"173\">*173</page-number>tenance of my wife and children.\u201d The gift in the first clause, to the wife, of the personal estate \u201c to enjoy the same during her natural life \u201d in the absence of a trust and of a remainder over, undoubtedly gave her an estate absolute to all thereof except perhaps to such part of it as consisted of debts due the testator and which are not involved in this controversy.</p>\n<p id=\"b203-5\">In Appeal of Merkel, 109 Pa. 235, the clause under consideration was: \u201c I give and bequeath to my beloved wife, Susanna, my remaining personal property, it may be money or whatever kind it will, to her full ownership, so long as she doth live. Further, I recommend that my hereinafter named executor shall see that her money does not become lost.\u201d On this clause it is said by Mr. Justice Paxsost: \u201cThe language of the will above quoted is ample to vest the personal estate of the testator absolutely in his widow. It is a gift for life, without any limitation over, and without the intervention of a trustee. There is a line of decisions in this state which hold that such a bequest is absolute: Smith\u2019s Appeal, 23 Pa. 9; Brownfield\u2019s Estate, 8 Watts, 465; Diehl\u2019s Estate, 36 Pa. 120; Silknitter\u2019s Appeal, 45 Pa. 365; Grove\u2019s Appeal, 58 Pa. 429. Authorities might be multiplied if it were necessary.\u201d See also Cox v. Sims, 125 Pa. 525; Boyle v. Boyle, 152 Pa. 108; Markley\u2019s Estate, 132 Pa. 352; Drennan\u2019s Appeal, 118 Pa. 176.</p>\n<p id=\"b203-6\">The other clauses of the paragraph do not affect the construction placed upon the one creating the absolute ownership of the personalty. It is true that the real estate is included in the clause as well as the personalty. But there can be no presumption from this that the title to the personal property should follow the title to the real estate, even if it should be found that the title to the real estate was restricted to an estate for life. There is in respect to the real estate a restriction as to the power of alienation which nowhere is made applicable to the personal estate.</p>\n<p id=\"b203-7\">The last clause of the paragraph affects only debts owing to the testator. The personal property here in dispute is not affected by this clause. The attachment is levied upon certificates of bank stock owned by the testator and which still remain in his name and which formed the corpus of his personal estate.</p>\n<p id=\"b203-8\">Under the facts of this case, and keeping our eyes fixed on <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"174\">*174</page-number>the words of the will to determine their meaning, we are constrained to hold that an absolute interest passed to the widow and that the rule should have been made absolute under the stipulation filed in the court below.</p>\n<p id=\"b204-5\">Judgment reversed.</p>\n<judges id=\"b204-6\">Beaver, J., dissents.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
