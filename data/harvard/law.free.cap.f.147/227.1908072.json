United States (just decided) 145 Fed. 791, appellant\u2019s counsel objected \u201cto the commissioner proceeding with this hearing on the ground that he has not jurisdiction of this matter, and, further, on the ground that the government has presented no proofs or evidence to show that the defendant is unlawfully in the United States; and I object to the defendant being sworn at this time by the commissioner and compelled to testify against himself, and to any questions being propounded to him with reference to the charge herein contained.\u201d \u25a0</p>\n<p id=\"b240-5\">These objections were overruled, and Law Chin Woon was examined as a witness by the United States Attorney. At the close of \u25a0 his testimony his counsel moved \u201cto strike out all the testimony of this witness on the grounds previously stated.\u201d This motion was denied, and an exception to this ruling was taken.</p>\n<p id=\"b240-6\">The record then states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b240-7\">\u201cTlie Commissioner: Ha've you any testimony on behalf of the defendant?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b240-8\">\u201cMr. Woodworth: X hold that we are not called upon to produce any evidence in his behalf. I desire at this time again to raise the question of the jurisdiction of the commissioner in this case.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b240-9\">\u201cThe Commissioner: X overrule the objection pro forma.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b240-10\">Law Chin Woon was then ordered by the commissioner to be deported.</p>\n<p id=\"b240-11\">The District Judge thereafter \u201cordered that the said judgment of deportation be, and the same is hereby, affirmed,\u201d from which judgment the appeal herein is taken for the purpose of-raising the \u25a0 question of jurisdiction.</p>\n<p id=\"b240-12\">This case, although the testimony was on somewhat different lines, is identical in principle with that of Low Foon You, in which the question involved was fully considered, and decided adversely to the views contended for by appellant.</p>\n<p id=\"b240-13\">Upon the authority of that case, the judgment herein appealed from is affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
