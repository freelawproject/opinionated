On this suit the trial had proceeded to the rendition of a verdict in favor of the defendant in error, for seven thousand dollars, and the overruling of a motion for a new trial, when the plaintiff in error filed in the Circuit Court Ms bill in equity, asking that the further prosecution of the suit at law be restrained; and upon tills bill, the answers thereto, and 'a replication, an injunction was issued restraining the further prosecution of the suit at law, but upon this condition, that the plaintiff in error should cause to be filed an injunction bond in the sum of ten thousand dollars, conditioned among other tilings, that in case of the dissolution of the injunction, the plaintiff in error would pay the amount of the verdict rendered in the suit at law, together with interest thereon at five per cent, and all costs, and such judgment, if any, as should at any time thereafter be entered on such verdict.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b705-13\">The bond, conditioned as above, was duly fiied, and a decree having Been entered, was appealed from to the Circuit Court of Appeals, where, on consideration, it was reversed.

Edward B. Leigh, supra, and need not be repeated here. It is sufficient to say that the bill was predicated largely upon the alleged existence of an equitable set off not provable in the suit at law; and was disposed of in this court, chieffy because the facts set forth constituted no rightful set off, either equitable or legal. True the court held that one of the claims made by the bill could have been interposed as a defense in the suit at law; but this was a minor part of the claims upon which the bill was founded.</p>\n<p id=\"b706-4\">The suit at law was enjoined after it had proceeded to verdict and motion for new trial overruled. Nothing remained in that suit but judgment. But for the injunction the judgment presumably would have been entered at once, and satisfied at once, either by payment or execution. The effect\" of the injunction suit was to delay this satisfaction \u2014 to hang the suit at law in the air \u2014 and cause defendant in error to follow the equity case into the Circuit Court, and take it finally to the Circuit Court of Appeals. It is our judgment that an injunction, thus hanging up at the last moment the entry of judgment, but upon condition exacted by the court, and accepted by the plaintiff in error, that in case the injunction was dissolved, the verdict and the judgment thereon should be paid in full, is, in effect, a stipulation in court that all errors in the suit at law, up to the granting of the injunction, are waived and released. Otherwise the condition exacted for the injunction, and accepted and acted upon, would be wholly ineffective \u2014 resulting in the plaintiff in error having obtained all he asked, and being permitted to cast off with impunity all that was required of him.</p>\n<p id=\"b706-5\">The demurrer to the plea of release of errors, is overruled, the plea is sustained; and, there being no assignmnt of error outside of those released, the judgment of the Circuit Court is affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
