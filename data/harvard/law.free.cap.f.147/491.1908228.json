We deem it unnecessary to consider the question of pleading with respect to the technical character of the seventeenth plea, whether it should be construed as a puis darrein continuance, and whether, therefore, it supplants all defenses theretofore interposed, because the seventeenth plea substantially embodies all the material averments of the first 16 pleas, and is sufficient to raise the vital question of law upon which this case must turn. The material facts set out in the several pleas may be put in brief concrete form as follows: The plaintiff corporation is alleged to have been organized on the 26th day of May, 1900, in the state of Wisconsin, for the purpose, as stated in its charter, of acting as exclusive sales agent for the paper and paper products thereafter to be produced by 21 certain manufacturing corporations located in the states of Wisconsin and Michigan, engaged in the paper industry; that its board of directors Consisted of representatives of the 21 paper mills, so that for trade purposes there was a practical amalgamation of the 21 producing companies; that thereupon, on the same day, pursuant to such confederation, the plaintiff corporation became the exclusive sales agent of all such paper mills, with exclusive power to determine the extent of the output, and to fix prices arbitrarily, and that by such confederation, competition between the 21 producing corporations was stifled, and the plaintiff corporation as such sales agent, put in control of 90 per cent, of the paper and paper products manufactured west of the Alleghany Mountains ; that immediately after such plaintiff corporation had been so organized and equipped, it came to the city of Chicago, complied with the requirements of the local law, secured a place of business, and has since that time continued to handle and sell such combined product of the 21 mills in Wisconsin, Michigan, Illinois, and other Western states, as contemplated by the agreement of confederation'; that the alleged combination is violative of the statute of Illinois, entitled \u201cAn act to provide for the punishment of persons, copartners or corporations forming pools, trusts and combines, and mode of procedure and rules of evidence in such cases,\u201d approved June 11, 1891, in force July 1, 1891 (Laws 1891, p. 206).</p>\n<p id=\"b505-10\">It cannot be successfully contended that the contract in suit falls within the sanction of the fifth section. The contract thereby denounced as void is plainly one which directly contravenes the earlier sections ; one in which the trust takes root, or by which the illicit scheme is organized. The defendant below purchased the paper in the.ordi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"494\">*494</page-number>nary course of business. It was a stranger to the alleged unlawful combination. The sale of the merchandise had no direct relation to the prohibitions of sections 1 and <em>2. </em>The same distinction has been drawn under the federal anti-trust act (Hopkins v. United States, 171 U. S. 578, <em>592, </em>19 Sup. Ct. 40, 43 L. Ed. 290; Anderson v. United States, 171 U. S. 604, 615, 19 Sup. Ct. 50, 43 L. Ed. 300), and this court has several times held that contracts founded upon a good consideration are collateral to the unlawful scheme or combination and not tainted thereby. Dennehy v. McNulta, 86 Fed. 825, 30 C. C. A. 422, 41 L. R. A. 609; Star Brewery Co. v. United Breweries, 121 Fed. 713, 58 C. C. A. 133; Harrison v. Glucose Co., 116 Fed. 304, 53 C. C. A. 484, 58 L. R. A. 915.</p>\n<p id=\"b506-4\">The real defense tendered by the several pleas is bottomed upon secuon 6, and it becomes material to analyze this, part of the enactment. It will be noted at the outset that the structure of sections 5 and 6, is almost identical. Both hinge upon \u201cviolation of any provisions of the preceding sections of this act.\u201d Section 4 metes out punishment to officers of the offending corporation for any violation of section 1. So here there are three distinct consequences that flow from infringement of earlier sections: Under section 4, fine and imprisonment; under section 5, the avqidance of contract; and under section 6, denial of civil remedy in the courts. They partake of the same nature. They are penal inflictions of different kinds, consequent upon a single-transgression. The violation contemplated in either case must be such as will sustain the penalty imposed by either section. In other words, if the combination effected in Wisconsin constituted such a violation of section 1 as to warrant the exclusion of the plaintiff company from the courts of Illinois under section 6, then a direct proceeding-might have been instituted under section 4 to punish the officers of such offending corporation.</p>\n<p id=\"b506-5\">The penal character of section 6 sufficiently appears upon its face.. To debar trading corporations from all redress in the courts is a. drastic infliction. The same conclusion as to the nature of the section is reached by 'a legal inference. The title of the statute deals only with punishments and the manner of their infliction. If, therefore, section 6 were of a different character, it would contravene section 13 of article 4 of the Constitution of Illinois and be of no effect. It is fundamental and elementary that the General Assembly of Illinois has no jurisdiction to provide any punishment for an act done outside of the territorial limits of the state. It cannot project its public policy into another sovereignty. The dereliction charged against the plaintiff below by the several pleas inheres in its contract relations with the 21 producing companies whereby, as claimed, it was intended to suppress competition, restrict the output, and arbitrarily fix the price of paper. This illicit combination culminated in the organization of the plaintiff corporation and the agreement by which it was to officiate as exclusive sales agent. Thereby the combine became an accomplished fact which, for aught that appears, may not have infringed the public policy of Wisconsin. All these things happened five years before the contract in suit, and took place within the state of Wisconsin, before-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"495\">*495</page-number>the plaintiff entered upon any business in Chicago. Since that time nothing has happened, certainly nothing within the state of Illinois, of which section 1 takes cognizance. It is argued that the Illinois statute is unconstitutional, and that a combination formed in one state to control prices in another state affects interstate commerce and therefore is not subject to state regulation. We are not concerned with the constitutionality of this act, if it can, in no event, be applicable to the case at bar. The Supreme Court of Illinois has had occasion to interpret this statute, and the doctrine which it lays down is decisive of the issues here.</p>\n<p id=\"b507-3\">In People v. Butler Street Foundry Co., 201 Ill. 236, 66 N. E. 349, the court say:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b507-4\">\u201cIt Is fundamental that the Legislature of this state is powerless to pass an enactment making an act committed in a foreign state punishable in that state, or the Legislature of a foreign state to pass an enactment to make an act committed In this state a crime punishable in this state. It Is therefore evident that a violation of the statute above set forth in this state cannot be punished as an original offense in a foreign state, and that the immunity afforded by the statute is complete against a prosecution under the law of the other states of the Union. The anti-trust statute of 1891 has no extraterritorial effect. While its terms may be broad enough to include trusts, pools, combines, etc., formed with parties residing outside of this state, the courts, in construing it, must necessarily confine it to those matters upon which the General Assembly has power to act, viz., trusts, pools, combinations, etc., formed within the state of Illinois. In the construction of the statute the courts will exclude from the operation thereof subjects or classes upon which the state Legislature has no power to legislate, though comprehended within the general terms of the act, unless the different parts of the statute are so connected that they cannot be separated without destroying the evident intention of the Legislature. * * * If the statute be confined to its legitimate constitutional scope its proper construction only requires the affidavit to state whether or not the corporation upon whose behalf it is made had violated the statute by performing some one or more of the acts therein pro.hibited within the state of Illinois, and would not include, but would exclude all acts which would connect it with any trust, pool, combination, etc., formed outside of the state, and which would violate the anti-trust statute of the United States. * * * In making the affidavit the affiant is only required to take into consideration the acts of the corporation while engaged in business wholly within the state, and if, in connection with that business, it has not been connected with any trust, pool, or combination within the state, or otherwise violated the Illinois anti-trust statute, he can truthfully make the affidavit to that effect, although the corporation at the same time, in its business outside the state, has been connected with trusts, pools, combinations, etc., in violation of the United States anti-trust statute; that being a matter exclusively within the jurisdiction of the United States and over which the state has no control and to which the statute of this state does not apply. * * * We conclude, therefore, that the officer making the affidavit, and the corporation in whose behalf the same Is made, are fully protected by the statutory immunity from a prosecution by any other state or by the federal authorities.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b507-5\">We are reminded that section 6 was not specifically involved in that case. This is immaterial. The discussion above recited was vital to the very questions before the court, so that the opinion is authoritative and applies with full force to every portion of the act.</p>\n<p id=\"b507-6\">There is nothing decided in Coal Co. v. People, 214 Ill. 421, 73 N. E. 770, which is inconsistent with the doctrine of the earlier case. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"496\">*496</page-number>It may be conceded that if a foreign corporation enter into a combine within the state of Illinois which is forbidden by the statute, it must stand upon the same footing as a domestic corporation, and be liable to all the pains and penalties of the act, without regard to the place of its origin. It is therefore apparent that a direct proceeding could not be sustained to subject the officers of the General Paper Company to the penalties of section 4 for an alleged transgression occurring in Wisconsin. The same reasoning must be fatal to a defense based upon section 6. \u25a0</p>\n<p id=\"b508-4\">We adopt and follow the conclusion of the Supreme Court of the state. \u2022 It results, therefore, that the Illinois anti-trust act, so called, is not available as a defense to this action, and the judgment of the Circuit Court is affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
