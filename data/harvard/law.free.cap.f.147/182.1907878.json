The order restrains the plaintiff in an action of trover from recovering the value of property which, if its contention is correct, never became part of the bankrupts\u2019 estate, and was converted by the trustee. In effect the order overrules several decisions of this court. In re Russell &amp; Burkett, 101 Fed. 248, 41 C. C. A. 323; In re Kanter &amp; Cohen, 121 Fed. 984, 58 C. C. A. 260; In re Spitzer, 130 Fed. 879, 66 C. C. A. 35; In re Grissler, 136 Fed. 754, 69 C. C. A. 406. We find nothing in Whitney v. Wenman, 198 U. S. 539, 25 Sup. Ct. 778, 49 L. Ed. 1157, which conflicts with the views expressed in these decisions.</p>\n<p id=\"b194-15\">The order is reversed, with costs.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
