On appeal, Zaldivar argues that there was insufficient evidence for the jury to find him guilty.</p>\n<p id=\"b857-22\">\u201cWe review challenges to the sufficiency of the evidence <em>de novo, </em>viewing the evidence in the light most favorable to the government.\u201d <em>United States v. Futrell, </em>209 F.3d 1286, 1288 (11th Cir.2000). This evidence can be either direct or circumstantial. <em>United States v. Wilson, </em>183 F.3d 1291, 1300 (11th Cir.1999). The evidence is deemed sufficient if a reasonable factfinder could have found that it established that the defendant was guilty beyond a reasonable doubt. <em>United States v. McDowell, </em>250 F.3d 1354, 1364-65 (11th Cir.2001). On appeal, all reasonable inferences are drawn in favor of the jury\u2019s verdict. <em>Id. </em>The jury has the exclusive power to determine the credibility of witnesses, and we must defer to a jury\u2019s reasonable credibility determinations. <em>United States v. Chastain, </em>198 F.3d 1338, 1351 (11th Cir.1999).</p>\n<p id=\"b857-23\">To sustain a substantive felon in possession conviction under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 922(g)(1), the government must prove: \u201c(1) that the defendant was a convicted felon, (2) that the defendant was in know<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"834\">*834</page-number>ing possession of a firearm, and (3) that the firearm was in or affecting interstate commerce.\u201d <em>United States v. Deleveaux, </em>205 F.3d 1292, 1296-97 (11th Cir.2000).</p>\n<p id=\"b858-4\">Upon review of the record and the parties\u2019 briefs, we discern no reversible error. The only element that is being disputed on appeal is whether Zaldivar had knowing possession of a firearm. A police officer testified that: (1) he saw the handle of a gun in Zaldivar\u2019s hand; (2) after seeing the police officer, Zaldivar went back into his apartment, knelt next to a pile of clothes, and proceeded to make strange motions with his body while being located next to the pile of clothes; and (3) police officers then discovered a gun inside that pile of clothes. Therefore, we find that the evidence was sufficient to convict Zaldivar, and, accordingly, we affirm his conviction.</p>\n<p id=\"b858-5\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
