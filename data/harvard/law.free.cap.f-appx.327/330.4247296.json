For the drug offenses, he was sentenced to 262 months of imprisonment to run concurrently. For the gun offense, he was sentenced to 60 months of imprisonment to run consecutively, as required by \u00a7 924(c)(1)(D). Following amendments to the Sentencing Guidelines, Lopez\u2019s concurrent sentences were reduced to an aggregate of 168 months, and the consecutive sentence of 60 months remained intact.</p>\n<p id=\"b355-12\">On November 3, 2008, Lopez filed the instant motion. Therein, he cited two cases as \u201cauthority to persuade [the District Court] to amend judgment executed on December 13, 1994, to run all counts con-current [sic] as opposed to consecutive, consistent with substantial justice.\u201d The District Court denied the motion, finding that \u201c[n]o matter whether we construe his motion as one to correct sentence under Fed.R.Crim.P. 35 or as a notice of appeal under \u00a7 3742, we deny his motion as untimely.\u201d Lopez timely appealed from that order.</p>\n<p id=\"b355-15\">As a preliminary matter, we do not endorse the District Court\u2019s literal reading of the heading atop Lopez\u2019s filing for purposes of analyzing his claim. <em>See United States v. Miller, </em>197 F.3d 644, 648 (3d Cir.1999) (\u201cfederal courts have long recognized that they have an obligation to look behind the label of a motion filed by a pro se inmate and determine whether the motion is, in effect, cognizable under a different remedial statutory framework\u201d) (citation omitted). Clearly, Lopez is not trying to \u201ccorrect a sentence that resulted from arithmetical, technical, or other clear error\u201d pursuant to Fed.R.Crim.P. 35(a). As such, that statute\u2019s seven-day limitations period is inapplicable. Nor is Lopez attempting to take a direct appeal more than a decade after he was convicted, and thus the District Court\u2019s timeliness analysis under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3742(a)(1), is flawed as well.</p>\n<p id=\"b355-16\">Instead, the body of Lopez\u2019s motion reveals that he attempted to persuade the District Court to adopt the holding of the Second Circuit\u2019s opinion in <em>United States v. Whitley, </em>529 F.3d 150 (2d Cir.), <em>reh\u2019g denied, </em>540 F.3d 87 (2d Cir.2008), in order to invalidate his consecutive sixty-month sentence for using a firearm.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"332\">*332</page-number>Thus, the motion is more appropriately-read as a collateral attack by Lopez on his sentence. So read, the District Court should have dismissed the motion for lack of jurisdiction, as Lopez has already filed one \u00a7 2255 motion, which the District Court denied on November 30, 2000, and he must \u201cmove in the appropriate court of appeals for an order authorizing the district court to consider the application\u201d before filing a second or successive \u00a7 2255 motion. 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2244(b)(3)(A).</p>\n<p id=\"b356-4\">Indeed, this would have been the proper course of events, because the presumptive means by which a federal prisoner can challenge the validity of his conviction or sentence is by motion pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255. <em>See Okereke v. United States, </em>307 F.3d 117, 120 (3d Cir.2002); <em>see also Davis v. United States, </em>417 U.S. 333, 343, 94 S.Ct. 2298, 41 L.Ed.2d 109 (1974). That said, we need not remand this case to the District Court so that it may dismiss the motion on alternative grounds. Rather, we will modify the District Court\u2019s order so that it can be read as dismissing Lopez\u2019s \u201cmotion to amend\u201d as an impermissibly second or successive \u00a7 2255 motion, and we will affirm on that basis.</p>\n<p id=\"b356-5\">There being no substantial question presented by Lopez\u2019s appeal, we will summarily affirm the District Court\u2019s order as modified by this opinion. <em>See </em>LAR 27.4; I.O.P. 10.6.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b355-13\">. In <em>Whitley, </em>a panel of the Second Circuit found that a consecutive ten-year minimum sentence for discharge of a firearm pursuant to 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924(c)(l)(A)(iii), did not apply to a defendant who was also subject to a fifteen-year minimum sentence provided by ACCA\u2019s \"three strikes\u201d rule under \u00a7\u00a7 922(g)(1) and 924(e) of that title. <em>See </em>529 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"332\">*332</page-number>F.3d at 158. We express no opinion on the resultant circuit split at this time.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
