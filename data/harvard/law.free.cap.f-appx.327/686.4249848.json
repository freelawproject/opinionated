Benitez, United States District Judge for the Southern District of California, sitting by designation.</p>\n</footnote>\n<opinion data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"majority\">\n<p id=\"b711-7\">MEMORANDUM <footnotemark>**</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b711-8\">Floyd Lowe appeals from the district court\u2019s denial of his second amended petition for a writ of <em>habeas corpus </em>under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254. We affirm because the district court correctly held that (1) the state court jury had sufficient evidence to convict Lowe of being a felon in possession of a firearm, despite the constitutional errors in other related convictions; and (2) counsel\u2019s failure to appeal the firearm-possession conviction did not amount to ineffective assistance of counsel. Because the parties are familiar with the factual and procedural history of this case, we will not recount it here.</p>\n<p id=\"b711-9\">Following the denial of Lowe\u2019s petition, the district court granted a certificate of appealability on three questions:</p>\n<p id=\"b711-10\">1. Does Lowe\u2019s firearm-possession conviction violate due process because it is based on a jury verdict after a trial that has been infected by substantial constitutional errors as to all other verdicts?</p>\n<p id=\"b711-11\">2. If Lowe\u2019s due process rights were thereby violated, does the failure of his appellate counsel to raise that issue constitute ineffective assistance of counsel?</p>\n<p id=\"b711-16\">3. Does Lowe\u2019s 25-years-to-life sentence violate due process and the protection against cruel and unusual punishment?</p>\n<p id=\"b711-17\">On appeal, Lowe abandoned the third question and changed his theory in the first and second questions. He argued\u2014for the first time before any court\u2014that the jury instructions for the firearm-possession charge contained an erroneous theory of guilt and that counsel was ineffective for failing to raise the instructional errors on direct appeal. Because his erroneous-jury-instruction claims fall outside the scope of the certificate of appealability, we do not address them. <em>See Gatlin v. Madding, </em>189 F.3d 882, 886 (9th Cir.1999) (holding that the \u201cissuance of a certificate of appealability is a jurisdictional prerequisite to appeal\u201d). Our refusal to address these claims does not preclude him from bringing them in a new petition, but we express no view on the merits.</p>\n<p id=\"b711-18\">Because Lowe fails to raise the certified questions in this appeal, he has waived his challenges to the district court\u2019s denial of his petition. <em>Styers v. Schriro, </em>547 F.3d 1026, 1028 n. 3 (9th Cir.2008) (per curiam). Even if reviewed <em>de novo, </em>however, the district court\u2019s rulings on the certified questions withstand scrutiny.</p>\n<p id=\"b711-19\">With respect to the first certified question, Lowe lacks a factual basis for his claim that his firearm-possession conviction violates due process because of constitutional errors in other related convictions. As the district court held, the record contains sufficient evidence to support a jury finding that Lowe took control of the gun. Moreover, the jury through its verdict <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"688\">*688</page-number>credited the victim\u2019s testimony, which contradicted that of Lowe. The district court therefore correctly deferred to the jury\u2019s credibility determination. <em>Bruce v. Terhune, </em>376 F.3d 950, 957-58 (9th Cir.2004). In any event, the errors in Lowe\u2019s other convictions are specific to those convictions and thus have no bearing on the jury\u2019s determination of the firearm-possession charge. Accordingly, he cannot prevail on the first certified question.</p>\n<p id=\"b712-4\">The validity of Lowe\u2019s firearm-possession conviction dooms his ineffective-assistance-of-counsel claim raised in the second certified question. Where, as here, a <em>habeas </em>petitioner had \u201conly a remote chance of obtaining reversal\u201d absent the purported unprofessional error, he cannot satisfy the two-prong test under <em>Strickland v. Washington, </em>466 U.S. 668, 104 S.Ct. 2052, 80 L.Ed.2d 674 (1984). <em>Miller v. Keeney, </em>882 F.2d 1428, 1435 (9th Cir.1989).</p>\n<p id=\"b712-5\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b711-20\"><em> </em>This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by Ninth Circuit Rule 36-3.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
