After finding\u2014based on evidence from the trial of coconspirators\u2014that Wazwaz\u2019s involvement in the conspiracy continued after he was imprisoned for an earlier conviction, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"670\">*670</page-number>the district court<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> sentenced Wazwaz to 42 months in prison to run consecutively to, rather than concurrently with, the undischarged prison term he was then serving, <em>see </em>U.S.S.G \u00a7 5G1.3. On appeal, his counsel has moved to withdraw and filed a brief under <em>Anders v. California, </em>386 U.S. 738, 87 S.Ct. 1396, 18 L.Ed.2d 493 (1967), arguing that the district court erred in relying on evidence from the coconspirators\u2019 trial, as Wazwaz was not a party to the trial and could not cross-examine witnesses. Wazwaz has filed a pro se brief arguing, with regard to the consecutive sentence, that the district court violated Federal Rule of Criminal Procedure 32(i)(4)(A)(ii) (before imposing sentence, district court must address defendant personally to permit him to speak or present any information to mitigate the sentence).</p>\n<p id=\"b694-4\">Because Wazwaz did not object at sentencing to the district court\u2019s consideration of evidence from the coconspirators\u2019 trial, we review the issue for plain error. <em>See United States v. Sharpfish, </em>408 F.3d 507, 511 (8th Cir.2005). We find no error in the court\u2019s reliance on the evidence, as the sentencing judge presided over the coconspirators\u2019 trial, and'\u2014contrary to his assertions on appeal\u2014Wazwaz had ample notice of the proposed use of the evidence to support a consecutive sentence, and he had an opportunity at sentencing to rebut the evidence and to address the court personally. <em>See Smith v. United States, </em>206 F.3d 812, 813 (8th Cir.2000) (per curiam). Thus, the district court properly found that Wazwaz was subject to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 5G1.3(a) (if instant offense was committed while defendant was serving term of imprisonment, sentence for instant offense shall run consecutively to undischarged term of imprisonment).</p>\n<p id=\"b694-7\">Further, we conclude that the district court did not abuse its discretion in imposing a fully consecutive sentence. <em>See United States v. Winston, </em>456 F.3d 861, 867 (8th Cir.2006) (standard of review). The court explicitly stated that it was considering the factors in 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a), and indicated that a consecutive sentence was needed for rehabilitation purposes and for proportionality. <em>See </em>18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3584(a)-(b) (imposition of concurrent or consecutive prison terms; court shall consider \u00a7 3553(a) factors in making determination); 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a)(2)(A) (just punishment), (2)(B) (adequate deterrence), (4)(A)(i) (applicable Guidelines range), (6) (avoidance of unwarranted sentence disparities among defendants); <em>Winston, </em>456 F.3d at 868 (affmming sentence where district court explained its decision to run sentence consecutively and cited \u00a7 3553(a) factors).</p>\n<p id=\"b694-8\">After reviewing the record independently under <em>Penson v. Ohio, </em>488 U.S. 75, 109 S.Ct. 346, 102 L.Ed.2d 300 (1988), we have found no nonfrivolous issues for appeal. Accordingly, the judgment is affirmed. We also grant counsel\u2019s motion to withdraw on the condition that counsel inform Wazwaz about the procedures for filing petitions for rehearing and for certiorari.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b694-5\">.
