For the reasons below, we will affirm the District Court\u2019s orders.</p>\n<p id=\"b378-21\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b378-22\">In 2000, Walsh, who was then represented by counsel, filed a medical malpractice suit in the Erie County, Pennsylvania, Court of Common Pleas. Judge John A. Bozza presided over the case and John Quinn and Francis Klemensic represented defendants Dennis Borozon, M.D. and St. Vincent Health Center. On June 4, 2004, three days before the trial was to begin, the defendants moved for summary judgment. Four days later, Walsh moved for leave to file an amended complaint. The trial court denied Walsh\u2019s motion and granted the defendants\u2019 motions for summary judgment. On July 11, 2005, the Pennsylvania Superior Court affirmed the trial court\u2019s decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b379-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"355\">*355</page-number>Two-and-one-half years later, on November 26, 2007, Walsh filed the current complaint in the United States District Court for the Western District of Pennsylvania. She alleges that Quinn and Klemensic\u2014the attorneys for the defendants in her state case\u2014conspired with Judge Bozza to interfere with her due process rights. Walsh asserts that in 2003 Bozza formed a medical malpractice workgroup in response to a medical malpractice case he had presided over in which the jury awarded substantial damages to the plaintiff. According to Walsh, Bozza named Quinn and Klemensic to the workgroup, and throughout 2003 and 2004, \u201cupon information and belief,\u201d they had ex parte communications about her case. She believes that \u201cQuinn and Klemensic along with Bozza acted unlawfully together to violate [her] rights by making sure that her case was terminated in favor of the defendants. Quinn and Klemensic had to have worked with Judge Bozza to end the case improperly.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b379-5\">The District Court, upon motion by Quinn and Klemensic, dismissed Walsh\u2019s case. The District Court first determined that it lacked jurisdiction under the <em>Rook-er-Feldman </em>doctrine.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> <em>See Rooker v. Fidelity Trust Co., </em>263 U.S. 413, 44 S.Ct. 149, 68 L.Ed. 362 (1923); <em>District of Columbia Court of Appeals v. Feldman, </em>460 U.S. 462, 103 S.Ct. 1303, 75 L.Ed.2d 206 (1983). The District Court then found that, even if it did have jurisdiction, Walsh\u2019s conspiracy claim, as assessed under 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983, failed because she did not plead sufficient facts to demonstrate that Quinn and Klemensic could be treated as having acted \u201cunder color of state law.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b379-6\">Ten days after the District Court dismissed her complaint, Walsh\u2019s counsel sought to withdraw from the ease and Walsh filed pro se a motion for reconsideration and for leave to file an amended complaint. Walsh asserted that she should be allowed to amend her complaint because she \u201cha[d] new information which she feels will strongly impact the case against defendants Quinn and Klemensic.\u201d On September 8, 2008, the District Court denied Walsh\u2019s motions. Walsh now appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b379-10\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b379-11\">We have jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291 and exercise plenary review over an order dismissing a complaint for failure to state a claim. <em>Angstadt v. Midd-West Sch. Dist., </em>377 F.3d 338, 342 (3d Cir.2004). \u201cWe accept as true all factual allegations in the complaint and will affirm ... only if it is certain that no relief can be granted under any set of facts which could be proved.\u201d <em>Steamfitters Local Union No. 420 Welfare Fund v. Philip Morris, Inc., </em>171 F.3d 912, 919 (3d Cir.1999) (internal quotation and citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b379-12\">As the District Court explained, a claim for a violation of civil rights under 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983 can be sustained only if a defendant has deprived a plaintiff of a federal constitutional or statutory right while acting under color of state law. <em>Kaucher v. County of Bucks, </em>455 F.3d 418, 423 (3d Cir.2006). Walsh claims that Quinn and Klemensic acted under color of state law by conspiring Judge Bozza, a state actor. To allege such a conspiracy, the complaint must specifically present facts tending to show agreement and concerted action to deprive the plaintiff of his or her rights. <em>Crabtree v. Muchmore, </em>904 F.2d 1475, 1476 (10th Cir.1990); <em>Dennis v. Sparks, </em>449 U.S. 24, 27-28, 101 S.Ct. 183, 66 L.Ed.2d 185 (1980).</p>\n<p id=\"b380-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"356\">*356</page-number>[I] Assuming Walsh\u2019s allegations to be true, as we must, and viewing the facts in the light most favorable to Walsh, we conclude that there is no set of facts from which we can infer an understanding among Judge Bozza, Quinn, and Klemensic to deprive Walsh of her constitutional rights. Walsh attempts to tie Judge Bozza\u2019s and the lawyers\u2019 involvement with the medical malpractice workgroup\u2014which she suggests was formed to curb plaintiffs\u2019 damages in medical malpractice cases\u2014-to supposed ex parte conversations about her case, to the dismissal of her case. However, she presents nothing more than vague inferences and ambiguous allegations. And as the District Court articulated in its opinion, mere allegations of joint action or a conspiracy are not sufficient to survive a motion to dismiss. <em>See Crabtree, </em>904 F.2d at 1476. In sum, as nothing in the complaint demonstrates the existence of any concerted effort between Judge Bozza and the attorneys, we agree with the District Court\u2019s determination that Walsh failed to demonstrate that the attorneys acted under color of state law. It was thus appropriate for the District Court to dismiss Walsh\u2019s complaint.</p>\n<p id=\"b380-4\">Walsh also complains that the District Court abused its discretion by denying her motion to amend her complaint, which she filed after the District Court dismissed her case. As Walsh points out, refusals to grant leave to amend are reviewed for abuse of discretion. <em>In re Burlington Coat Factory Sec. Litig., </em>114 F.3d 1410, 1434 (3d Cir.1997). However, \u201c[although Rule 15 vests the District Court with considerable discretion to permit amendment \u2018freely ... when justice so requires,\u2019 Fed. R.Civ.P. 15(a), the liberality of the rule is no longer applicable once judgment has been entered. At that stage, Rules 59 and 60 govern the opening of final judgments,\u201d and amendment is not allowed unless the judgment is set aside or vacated under one of those rules. <em>Ahmed v. Dragovich, </em>297 F.3d 201, 207-08 (3d Cir.2002) (citing 6 Charles Alan Wright, Arthur R. Miller, Mary Kay Kane, <em>Federal Practice and Procedure, </em>\u00a7 1489).</p>\n<p id=\"b380-6\">Walsh filed her motion for reconsideration within ten days of the District Court\u2019s dismissal of her case; however, neither Rule 59 nor Rule 60(b) provides relief. She failed to demonstrate any basis for granting her motion, such as an applicable intervening change in controlling law, new evidence, clear error of law or fact, or manifest injustice. <em>See Max\u2019s Seafood Caf\u00e9 v. Quinteros, </em>176 F.3d 669, 677 (3d Cir.1999). Moreover, Walsh did not allege any new facts when proposing to file an amended complaint\u2014she stated only that she \u201chas new information which she feels will strongly impact the case against defendants Quinn and Klemensic.\u201d The District Court thus did not abuse its discretion by denying Walsh\u2019s motion to amend her complaint after her case had been dismissed.</p>\n<p id=\"b380-7\">For these reasons, we will affirm the District Court\u2019s orders.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b379-7\">. We need not address the District Court\u2019s ruling pursuant to the <em>Rooker-Feldman </em>Doctrine because we are affirming on other grounds.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
