Fuentes argues that the IJ infringed his due process rights by not permitting him to make statements concerning whether his fingerprint and biometric information had been obtained and that the IJ inaccurately reported that he had not filed a motion for a continuance. Fuentes also contends that the BIA erred by adopting the IJ\u2019s decision without considering his due process argument.</p>\n<p id=\"b529-20\">Fuentes\u2019s arguments lack merit. Our review of the record shows that the IJ was apprised of the pertinent information and permitted Fuentes to present his case. Further, the IJ\u2019s decision was in accord with the applicable regulation. <em>See </em>8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1003.31(c). Fuentes has shown no error in connection with the BIA\u2019s decision to adopt the IJ\u2019s opinion as its own, nor has he shown that the BIA acted <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"506\">*506</page-number>improperly by failing to address any claims raised in the appellate brief he filed in his administrative proceedings. The petition for review is DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b529-21\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir.
