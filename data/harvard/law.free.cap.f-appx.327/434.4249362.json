In August 2008, the district court revoked Burgess\u2019 supervised release and sentenced him to twenty-four months\u2019 imprisonment. On appeal, Burgess contends that his twenty-four month prison sentence is plainly unreasonable because it does not further the purposes of supervised release. Finding no error, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b459-13\">A sentence imposed after revocation of supervised release will be affirmed if it is within the applicable statutory maximum and is not plainly unreasonable. <em>United States v. Crudup, </em>461 F.3d 433, 437, 439-40 (4th Cir.2006). In determining whether a sentence is \u201cplainly unreasonable,\u201d this court first assesses whether the sentence is procedurally and substantively reasonable. <em>Id. </em>at 438. In evaluating the reasonableness of a revocation sentence, this court views issues of fact and the district court\u2019s exercise of discretion with deference. <em>Id. </em>at 439. A district court has broad discretion to revoke its previous sentence and impose a term of imprisonment up to the statutory maximum. <em>Id. </em>Moreover, a district court\u2019s statement of reasons for going beyond the Guidelines\u2019 nonbinding policy statement \u201cin imposing a sentence after revoking a defendant\u2019s supervised release need not be as specific as has been required when courts departed from guidelines that were, before <em>Booker, </em>considered to be mandatory.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 439 (quoting <em>United States v. Lewis, </em>424 F.3d 239, 245 (2d Cir.2005)).</p>\n<p id=\"b459-14\">A sentence is procedurally reasonable if the district court considered the Sentencing Guidelines\u2019 Chapter Seven policy statements and the pertinent factors in 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a) (2006). <em>See Crudup, </em>461 F.3d at 440. A sentence is substantively reasonable if the district court stated a proper basis for concluding that the defendant should receive the sentence imposed, up to the statutory maximum. <em>See id. </em>Only if a sentence is found procedurally or substantively unreasonable will this court \u201cthen decide whether the sentence is plainly unreasonable.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 439.</p>\n<p id=\"b459-15\">In this case, it is undisputed that Burgess\u2019 twenty-four month prison sentence falls within the applicable statutory maximum sentence of two years\u2019 imprisonment. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"436\">*436</page-number><em>See </em>18 U.S.C.A. \u00a7\u00a7 371, 3583(e)(3), 3559(a) (West 2006). Additionally, Burgess does not dispute that the district court properly calculated and considered the Guidelines\u2019 policy statement range of three to nine months\u2019 imprisonment. Further, Burgess does not assert that the district court failed to consider any pertinent sentencing factor under \u00a7 3553(a).</p>\n<p id=\"b460-4\">Moreover, the district court sufficiently stated a proper basis for its decision to sentence Burgess above the range recommended by the Guidelines. The district court\u2019s comments at the revocation hearing indicate that it imposed a sentence above the advisory policy statement range as a result of Burgess\u2019 repeated breaches of trust following instances of leniency. <em>See </em>USSG Ch. 7, Pt. A, intro cmt. 3(b) (\u201c[A]t revocation the court should sanction primarily the defendant\u2019s breach of trust.\u201d); <em>see also Crudup, </em>461 F.3d at 440 (affirming the imposition of the statutory maximum sentence when the appellant had repeatedly violated numerous conditions of his supervised release). Based on the broad discretion that a district court has to revoke a term of supervised release and impose a prison term up to and including the statutory maximum, Burgess\u2019 sentence is not unreasonable. Therefore, we find that Burgess\u2019 sentence is not plainly unreasonable. <em>See Crudup, </em>461 F.3d at 438-39.</p>\n<p id=\"b460-5\">Accordingly, we affirm the district court\u2019s judgment revoking Burgess\u2019 supervised release and imposing a twenty-four month prison term. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process. AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
