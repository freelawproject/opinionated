Hammond was convicted by a jury of conspiracy to distribute five kilograms or more of cocaine and fifty grams or more of cocaine base, in violation of 21 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 841(a)(1), 846 (2006), and was sentenced to 360 months in prison. Hammond appealed, challenging his conviction and sentence. We affirmed Hammond\u2019s conviction and rejected claims relating to his sentence, but because he was sentenced under the then-mandatory Sentencing Guidelines, vacated and remanded for resentencing consistent with <em>United States v. Booker, </em>543 U.S. 220, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005). <em>See United States v. Davis, </em>270 Fed.Appx. 236 (4th Cir.2008) (unpublished).</p>\n<p id=\"b456-18\">On remand, the district court imposed a 300-month variant sentence and Hammond timely appealed. Hammond asserts that the district court erred when it determined that the mandate rule barred it from reconsidering whether he incorrectly <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"433\">*433</page-number>received a 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 851 (2006) enhancement and that the district court procedurally erred in imposing his variant sentence. Finding no error, we affirm the district court\u2019s judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b457-5\">We reject Hammond\u2019s challenges to his \u00a7 851 enhancement because these challenges could have been litigated on Hammond\u2019s first appeal but were not. Accordingly, the district court correctly refused to revisit the issue during Hammond\u2019s remand proceeding. <em>See United States v. Bell, </em>5 F.3d 64, 66 (4th Cir.1993) (stating that the mandate rule \u201cforecloses relitigation of issues expressly or impliedly decided by the appellate court,\u201d as well as \u201cissues decided by the district court but foregone on appeal.\u201d); <em>see also Volvo Trademark Holding Aktiebolaget v. Clark Mach. Co., </em>510 F.3d 474, 481 (4th Cir.2007) (\u201c[A] remand proceeding is not the occasion for raising new arguments or legal theories.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b457-6\">\u201c[T]he doctrine [of the law of the case] posits that when a court decides upon a rule of law, that decision should continue to govern the same issues in subsequent stages in the same case.\u201d <em>United States v. Aramony, </em>166 F.3d 655, 661 (4th Cir.1999) (internal citation and quotation marks omitted). The law of the case must be applied:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b457-7\">in all subsequent proceedings in the same case in the trial court or on a later appeal ... unless: (1) a subsequent trial produces substantially different evidence, (2) controlling authority has since made a contrary decision of law applicable to the issue, or (3) the prior decision was clearly erroneous and would work manifest injustice.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b457-8\"><em>Id. </em>(internal citation and quotation marks omitted); <em>see Doe v. Chao, </em>511 F.3d 461, 464-66 (4th Cir.2007) (discussing mandate rule and its exceptions). Hammond\u2019s challenges do not fall within any of the above-mentioned exceptions.</p>\n<p id=\"b457-10\">Although Hammond suggests that the district court should have conducted a de novo hearing on remand, this assertion is meritless. In affirming Hammond\u2019s convictions, we explicitly rejected Hammond\u2019s and his co-conspirators\u2019 numerous objections to their sentences. We nonetheless vacated most of the appellants\u2019 sentences, noting that we were doing so solely because the sentences were imposed under a <em>.pre-jBooker </em>mandatory Guidelines regime. <em>See Davis, </em>270 Fed.Appx. at 248-49. Accordingly, this court\u2019s mandate remanding Hammond\u2019s case for resentencing limited the district court to considering the Guidelines range we upheld, along with the \u00a7 3553(a) factors, Amendment 706, and the crack-to-powder cocaine sentencing disparity, if applicable, to fashion an appropriate sentence. <em>See id. </em>at 248-49, 256 n. 16.</p>\n<p id=\"b457-11\">We also affirm the district court\u2019s 300-month variant sentence. After <em>Booker, </em>a sentence is reviewed for reasonableness, using an abuse of discretion standard of review. <em>Gall v. United States, </em>552 U.S. 38, 128 S.Ct. 586, 597, 169 L.Ed.2d 445 (2007). The first step in this review requires the court to ensure that the district court committed no significant procedural error. <em>United States v. Evans, </em>526 F.3d 155, 161 (4th Cir.2008). Assuming the district court committed no significant procedural error, this court must next consider the substantive reasonableness of the sentence imposed, taking into account the totality of the circumstances. <em>Id. </em>at 161-62.</p>\n<p id=\"b457-12\">While the court on appeal may presume that a sentence within the Guidelines range is reasonable, it may not presume that a sentence outside the Guidelines range is unreasonable. <em>Gall, </em>128 S.Ct. at 597; <em>see United States v. Abu Ali, </em>528 F.3d 210, 261 (4th Cir.2008) (\u201c[A] sentence that deviates from the Guidelines is re<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"434\">*434</page-number>viewed under the same deferential abuse-of-discretion standard as a sentence imposed within the applicable guidelines range.\u201d), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S.-, 129 S.Ct. 1312, 173 L.Ed.2d 584 (2009). Rather, in reviewing a sentence outside the Guidelines range, the court \u201cconsider[s] the extent of the deviation, but must give due deference to the district court\u2019s decision that the \u00a7 3553(a) factors, on a whole, justify the extent of the variance.\u201d <em>Gall, </em>128 S.Ct. at 597. Even if this court would have imposed a different sentence, this fact alone will not justify vacatur of the district court\u2019s sentence. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b458-6\">On remand, the district court considered Hammond\u2019s Guidelines range, heard counsel\u2019s argument regarding the weight that should be afforded the \u00a7 3553(a) factors, allowed Hammond an opportunity to allocute, and thoroughly considered the \u00a7 3553(a) factors before imposing Hammond\u2019s sentence. We find that the district court adequately explained its rationale for imposing the variant sentence and that the reasons relied upon by the district court are valid considerations under \u00a7 3553(a) and justify the sentence imposed. <em>United States v. Pauley, </em>511 F.3d 468, 473-76 (4th Cir.2007).</p>\n<p id=\"b458-7\">Based on the foregoing, we affirm the district court\u2019s judgment. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b458-8\">\n<em>AFFIRMED.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
