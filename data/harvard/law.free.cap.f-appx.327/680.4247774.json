Benson, </em>193 F.3d 936, 939 (8th Cir.1999) (stating a grant of summary judgment is reviewed de novo), we conclude dismissal was proper because the record before the district court showed Baker did not complete the third step of Pottawattamie County Jail\u2019s grievance procedure, <em>see </em>42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1997e(a) (declaring, \u201c[n]o action shall be brought with respect to prison conditions ... by a prisoner confined in any jail, prison, or other correctional facility until such administrative remedies as are available are exhausted\u201d); <em>Woodford v. Ngo, </em>548 U.S. 81, 90, 126 S.Ct. 2378, 165 L.Ed.2d 368 (2006) (explaining the proper exhaustion of remedies \u201cmeans using all steps that the [prison] holds out, and doing so <em>properly </em>\u201d); <em>Johnson v. Jones, </em>340 F.3d 624, 627 (8th Cir.2003) (holding an inmate must exhaust all available administrative remedies before filing suit, and \u201c[i]f exhaustion was not completed at the time of filing, dismissal is mandatory\u201d), and nothing in the record indicates this step in the procedure was unavailable to Baker, <em>see Chelette v. Harris, </em>229 F.3d 684, 688 (8th Cir.2000) (concluding an inmate\u2019s subjective beliefs, logical or otherwise, are irrelevant in determining whether administrative procedures are available).</p>\n<p id=\"b704-21\">Accordingly, we affirm. We also deny Baker\u2019s motion to obtain state court transcripts. <em>See Huelsman v. Civic Ctr. Corp., </em>873 F.2d 1171, 1175 (8th Cir.1989) (relating <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"681\">*681</page-number>that \u201c[a]n appellate court can properly consider only the record and facts before the district court and thus only those papers and exhibits filed in the district court can constitute the record on appeal\u201d).</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b704-16\">.
