Mincey (\u201cMincey\u201d) appeals the denial of his 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255 petition for post-conviction relief, arguing that the district court violated his Sixth Amendment rights when it twice denied his post-verdict motion for substitute counsel. Personal disputes with his appointed counsel at the underlying trial led Mincey to dismiss counsel following an adverse jury verdict, and to represent himself during the subsequent civil forfeiture and sentencing proceedings. Reciting the facts only as necessary, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b735-7\">\n<em>Legal Con\u00f1ict of Interest</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b735-8\">A defendant is constructively denied his constitutional right to counsel if his \u201cattorney is representing conflicting interests.\u201d <em>Plumlee v. Masto, </em>512 F.3d 1204, 1210 (9th Cir.2008) (en banc). Attorney Hodgkins\u2019s representation of Mincey never implicated an actual, legal conflict of interest.</p>\n<p id=\"b735-9\">Assuming arguendo that Hodgkins had opposed the motion for substitute counsel (the record indicates he did not), his \u201csiding with the district court\u201d did not create a conflict because the court is a neutral decisionmaker, not an interested party adverse to any of the litigants. <em>See Stenson v. Lambert, </em>504 F.3d 873, 886 (9th Cir.2007) (explaining that a \u201c \u2018conflict of interest\u2019 is a term of art in the law\u201d that \u201cdenotes representation of multiple conflicting interests, such as an attorney\u2019s representation of more than one defendant in the same criminal case\u201d). Neither was there an actual, legal conflict of interest because Hodgkins \u201csp[oke] out against [Mincey]\u201d in an apparent effort to \u201cextricate himself from this difficult attorney-client relationship.\u201d Hodgkins\u2019s concern that Mincey may have lied and been conniving simply does not create an actual, legal conflict of interest. <em>See Plumlee, </em>512 F.3d at 1210 (distinguishing \u201clegal conflicts of interest\u201d from the \u201cthe word \u2018conflict\u2019 [as it is] used in common parlance to describe a personality conflict, an artistic conflict, a family conflict, and many other sorts of antagonism\u2014even war\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b735-13\">Mincey\u2019s assertion that Hodgkins \u201cresisted\u201d Mincey\u2019s wish to file a post-conviction motion for a new trial based on an ineffective assistance of counsel claim also does not support finding a conflict of interest. We have already recognized that a defendant\u2019s desire to raise an ineffective assistance claim is \u201cnot inconsistent\u201d with his present attorney\u2019s \u201cgoal of rendering effective assistance.\u201d <em>United States v. Moore, </em>159 F.3d 1154, 1158 (9th Cir.1998). In fact, the possibility of a future malpractice claim or later embarrassment through collateral relief for ineffective assistance would logically motivate Hodgkins to correct through post trial motions any ineffective assistance he might have previously rendered.</p>\n<p id=\"b735-14\">\n<em>Breakdown of Communications</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b735-15\">A criminal defendant is also constructively denied his constitutional right to counsel when there is an irreconcilable interpersonal conflict between attorney and defendant that is not the defendant\u2019s fault and is so pervasive that it leads to a complete lack of communication between the two. <em>See Moore, </em>159 F.3d at 1159-60 (Sixth Amendment violation because \u201cir<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"712\">*712</page-number>reconcilable [interpersonal] conflict\u201d was so great that appointed counsel and defendant did not \u201chave any communication at all\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b736-4\">Here, the district court twice concluded that there was not a complete breakdown of communication between Mincey and Hodgkins. That finding of fact was not clearly erroneous. Indeed, the great weight of the evidence indicates that there was ample communication between the two, notwithstanding Mincey\u2019s general dissatisfaction with Hodgkins. What is more, any difficulty the two had communicating appears to have been solely the product of Mincey\u2019s own interference. <em>See United States v. Roston, </em>986 F.2d 1287, 1292 (9th Cir.1993) (no Sixth Amendment violation where the \u201cbreakdown in communication between [defendant] and his current counsel was entirely [defendant\u2019s] fault\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b736-5\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"***\">\n<p id=\"b735-16\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by Ninth Circuit Rule 36-3.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
