The district court dismissed his case without prejudice under the abstention doctrine articulated in <em>Younger v. Harris, </em>401 U.S. 37, 91 S.Ct. 746, 27 L.Ed.2d 669 (1971). Danner appeals, and we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b602-9\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b602-10\">We review de novo a district court\u2019s order declining federal jurisdiction on grounds of <em>Younger </em>abstention. <em>Fieger v. Thomas, </em>74 F.3d 740, 743 (6th Cir. 1996). The <em>Younger </em>doctrine counsels federal courts to abstain from enjoining certain pending state court criminal proceedings, 401 U.S. at 44, 91 S.Ct. 746, but the doctrine also extends to ongoing administrative proceedings, such as state bar disciplinary processes, <em>Middlesex County Ethics Comm. v. Garden State Bar Ass\u2019n, </em>457 U.S. 423, 434-35, 102 S.Ct. 2515, 73 L.Ed.2d 116 (1982). Federal <em>courts </em>properly invoke <em>Younger </em>abstention when a proceeding satisfies three criteria: \u201c(1) the underlying proceedings constitute an ongoing state judicial proceeding; (2) the proceedings implicate important state interests; and (3) there is an adequate opportunity to raise constitutional challenges in the course of the underlying proceeding.\u201d <em>Danner v. Bd. of Prof'l Responsibility of the Tenn. Supreme Court, </em>277 Fed.Appx. 575, 578 (6th Cir.2008).</p>\n<p id=\"b602-12\">Here the Board proceedings are ongoing state judicial proceedings for purposes of applying <em>Younger. </em>The Board commenced its disciplinary process by authorizing a Petition for Discipline before Danner filed his state court claim. State bar disciplinary proceedings may be \u201cjudicial in nature.\u201d <em>Middlesex, </em>457 U.S. at 433-34, 102 S.Ct. 2515. In fact, this Circuit holds that similar attorney disciplinary proceedings are \u201can adjudicative, rather than a legislative, function.\u201d <em>Squire v. Coughlan, </em>469 F.3d 551, 556 (6th Cir.2006); <em>see also Danner, </em>277 Fed.Appx. at 578; <em>Fieger, </em>74 F.3d at 744.</p>\n<p id=\"b602-13\">As for the <em>remaining Younger </em>criteria, the regulation and discipline of attorneys is without a doubt an important state function. <em>See Danner, </em>277 Fed-Appx. at 579. Moreover, the disciplinary process provides for judicial review of allegations that the Board\u2019s findings violate constitutional provisions. <em>Id. </em>We therefore conclude that the proceedings satisfy all three of the <em>Younger </em>criteria and hold that the district court correctly abstained in deference to the state proceeding. In addition, Danner <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"579\">*579</page-number>failed to invoke any of the exceptions to <em>Younger </em>abstention\u2014\u201cbad faith, harassment, or flagrant unconstitutionality.\u201d <em>Squire, </em>469 F.3d at 556 (citation and internal quotation marks omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b603-5\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b603-6\">We affirm.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
