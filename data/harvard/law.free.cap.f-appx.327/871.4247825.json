Goettel, appointed counsel for Jose Mejia, has filed a motion to withdraw on appeal, supported by a brief prepared pursuant to <em>Anders v. California, </em>386 U.S. 738, 87 S.Ct. 1396, 18 L.Ed.2d 493 (1967). Our independent review of the entire record reveals that counsel\u2019s assessment of the relative merit of the appeal is correct. Because independent examination of the entire record reveals no arguably meritorious issues, counsel\u2019s motion to withdraw is GRANTED, and Mejia\u2019s conviction and sentence are AFFIRMED. Mejia\u2019s motion for appointment of counsel is DENIED as moot.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
