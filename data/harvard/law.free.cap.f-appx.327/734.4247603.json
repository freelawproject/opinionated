She also petitions for review of the BIA\u2019s June 26, 2007, denial of her motion to reopen. We have jurisdiction pursuant to 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(a)(5). <em>See Toufighi v. Mukasey, </em>538 F.3d 988, 990 (9th Cir.2008). We deny each of the petitions for review.</p>\n<p id=\"b759-12\">1. The BIA did not abuse its discretion in its August 8, 2006, decision because the evidence Balachandran submitted in support of her motion to reopen did not establish that \u201ccircumstances have changed sufficiently [such] that a petitioner who previously did not have a legitimate claim for asylum now has a well-founded fear of future persecution.\u201d <em>See Malty v. Ashcroft, </em>381 F.3d 942, 945 (9th Cir.2004). Although Balachandran presented evidence of escalated violence in Sri Lanka and evidence that Mr. Pararajasingham, a Sri Lankan politician who was her husband\u2019s cousin and close friend, was murdered, the new evidence did not demonstrate that Balachandran herself was objectively subject to future persecution. The evidence demonstrated that most of the violence was in the eastern portion of the country and that Balachandran\u2019s similarly situated family remained in Columbo, Sri Lanka, without harm. In light of the evidence, the BIA reasonably concluded that Balachandran \u201cfailed to present any additional information evidencing that she would be at risk of persecution either because of her ethnicity or because of her connection to Mr. Pararajasingham .... \u201d <em>See Cuadras v. INS, </em>910 F.2d 567, 571 n. 2 (9th Cir.1990) (noting that the court may \u201cconsider evidence that [petitioner] could avoid the geographical source of his danger when it reviews the BIA\u2019s determinations as to \u2018well-founded fear\u2019 of persecution\u201d); <em>Khourassany v. INS, </em>208 F.3d 1096, 1101 (9th Cir.2000) (finding no well-founded fear of future persecution when petitioner\u2019s similarly situated family continued to live in the home country without harm).</p>\n<p id=\"b759-13\">2. The BIA also did not abuse its discretion in denying Balachandran\u2019s sec<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"736\">*736</page-number>ond motion to reopen as untimely. <em>See </em>8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1003.2(c)(2). Balachandran failed to assert any changed country conditions that might excuse her untimeliness. 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1003.23(b)(4)(i). Moreover, she cannot assert the doctrine of equitable tolling to excuse her untimeliness because she fails to demonstrate any deception, fraud, or error. <em>See Iturribarria v. INS, </em>321 F.3d 889, 897-98 (9th Cir.2003). We lack jurisdiction to review the BIA\u2019s discretionary decision not to reopen the matter <em>sua sponte. </em>8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(a)(2)(B)(ii).</p>\n<p id=\"b760-4\">PETITIONS DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b759-11\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9th Cir.
