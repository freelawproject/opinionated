Espinosa\u2019s \u00a7 3582(c)(2) motion was based on Amendment 706 to the Sentencing Guidelines, which reduced the base offense levels applicable to crack cocaine offenses. On appeal, Espinosa argues that Amendment 706 changed his guideline range because he was not sentenced as a career offender. Espinosa elaborates that the district court in the original sentencing hearing did not have the authority to enhance his sentence further for obstruction of justice after it had already enhanced his base offense level under the career-offender guideline. Therefore, by enhancing his sentence further, the district court \u201creverted\u201d back to the non-career offender sentencing scheme. Espinosa further requests that we hold his case in abeyance pending the resolution of a petition for rehearing <em>en banc </em>in <em>United States v. Argro, </em>No. OS-14591.</p>\n<p id=\"b873-9\">\u201cWe review <em>de novo </em>a district court\u2019s conclusions about the scope of its legal authority under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582(c)(2).\u201d <em>United States v. James, </em>548 F.3d 983, 984 (11th Cir.2008). A district court may not modify a term of imprisonment unless a defendant was sentenced based on a sentencing range that has \u201csubsequently been lowered\u201d by the Sentencing Commission. <em>See </em>18 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 3582(c)(1)(B), (c)(2). When the district court is determining whether to modify a defendant\u2019s sentence pursuant to \u00a7 3582(c)(2), <em>\u201call </em>original sentencing determinations remain unchanged with the sole exception of the guideline range that has been amended since the original sentencing.\u201d <em>United States v. Bravo, </em>203 F.3d 778, 781 (11th Cir.2000) (emphasis in original).</p>\n<p id=\"b873-11\">Amendment 706, which has been made retroactive, amends the Drug Quantity Table in U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2Dl.l(c) \u201cto provide a two-level reduction in base offense levels for crack cocaine offenses.\u201d <em>United States v. Moore, </em>541 F.3d 1323, 1325 (11th Cir. 2008), <em>cert. denied, McFadden v. United States, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 129 S.Ct. 965, 173 L.Ed.2d 156 (2009), <em>and cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S.-, 129 S.Ct. 1601, 173 L.Ed.2d 689 (2009). However, if a defendant is a career offender, his base offense level is determined under the career-offender guideline in U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4Bl.l(b) and not the drug-quantity guideline in \u00a7 2Dl.l(c). 541 F.3d at 1327-28.</p>\n<p id=\"b873-16\">In <em>United States v. Moore, </em>541 F.3d 1323, 1327-28 (11th Cir.2008), we held that defendants who are sentenced under the career-offender guideline are not sentenced under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2D1.1, and are, therefore, ineligible for a \u00a7 3582(c)(2) sentence reduction pursuant to Amendment 706. Espinosa\u2019s argument that he was not sentenced as a career offender is belied by the record, which shows that he was sentenced under the career-offender guideline. Although Espinosa argues that the district court improperly applied an obstruction of justice enhancement at his original sentencing, we may not reexamine a potential error from an original sentencing proceeding unrelated to the amended guideline range during a \u00a7 3582(c)(2) proceeding. <em>See Bravo, </em>203 F.3d at 781. Accordingly, we must conclude that the district court\u2019s sentencing of Espinosa as a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"850\">*850</page-number>career offender under \u00a7 4B1.1 renders him ineligible for a sentence reduction under Amendment 706. <em>See Moore, </em>541 F.3d at 1327-28.</p>\n<p id=\"b874-4\">Additionally, we decline to hold Espinosa\u2019s case in abeyance pending the resolution of the <em>en banc </em>petition in <em>Argro </em>because the fact that a petition for rehearing is pending in another case does not change the status of <em>Moore </em>as binding precedent, which we must follow. <em>See United States v. Vega-Castillo, </em>540 F.3d 1235, 1236 (11th Cir.2008) (holding that we are bound by our precedent \u201cunless and until it is overruled by this [C]ourt <em>en banc </em>or by the Supreme Court\u201d). Therefore, we affirm the denial of the \u00a7 3582(c)(2) motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b874-5\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
