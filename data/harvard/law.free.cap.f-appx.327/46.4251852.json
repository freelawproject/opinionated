The BIA denied all forms of relief, relying on only one of the immigration judge\u2019s three justifications for finding Petitioner not credible: that Petitioner\u2019s Chinese Resident Identification Card was counterfeit.</p>\n<p id=\"b71-18\">We review an adverse credibility finding for substantial evidence. <em>Singh v. Gonzales, </em>439 F.3d 1100, 1105 (9th Cir.2006). Athough this standard is highly deferential, the reason identified for disbelieving a petitioner\u2019s testimony must \u201cstrike at the heart of the claim.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(quoting <em>Li v. Ashcroft, </em>378 F.3d 959, 964 (9th Cir.2004)). \u201cAn inconsistency goes to the heart of a claim if it concerns events central to petitioner\u2019s version of why he was persecuted and fled.\u201d <em>Singh, </em>439 F.3d at 1108.</p>\n<p id=\"b71-19\">In this case, the Resident Identification Card did not go to the heart of Petitioner\u2019s claim. As in <em>Chen v. INS, </em>266 F.3d 1094 (9th Cir.2001), <em>overruled on other grounds by INS v. Orlando Ventura, </em>537 U.S. 12, 123 S.Ct. 353, 154 L.Ed.2d 272 (2002) (per curiam), the document was not submitted to prove any event central to Petitioner\u2019s alleged persecution in China. Moreover, Petitioner submitted three other pieces of evidence attesting to his identity\u2014a birth certificate, a household registry, and a marriage certificate\u2014none of which the BIA questioned as to authenticity or persuasive value. Accordingly, Petitioner\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"48\">*48</page-number>submission of a counterfeit identification card does not support the BIA\u2019s adverse credibility finding.</p>\n<p id=\"b72-4\">In <em>Soto-Olarie v. Holder, </em>555 F.3d 1089, 1095-96 (9th Cir.2009), we recently explained that our precedent permits us either to direct the BIA on remand to deem a petitioner credible or to remand on an open record, depending on the circumstances. Here, the IJ gave three reasons to disbelieve Petitioner, whereas the BIA gave only one without clearly and expressly rejecting the other two. Neither did the BIA decide whether Petitioner would be denied relief for other reasons, even if he were deemed credible. In this situation, the most appropriate course is to remand the case to the BIA for reconsideration on an open record. <em>See Gonzales v. Thomas, </em>547 U.S. 183, 186-87, 126 S.Ct. 1613, 164 L.Ed.2d 358 (2006) (per curiam); <em>Orlando Ventura, </em>537 U.S. at 16, 123 S.Ct. 353.</p>\n<p id=\"b72-6\">PETITION GRANTED; REMANDED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b71-20\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by Ninth Circuit Rule 36-3.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
