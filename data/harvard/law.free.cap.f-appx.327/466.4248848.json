Rodriguez challenged his jury conviction for murder. Rodriguez argued that the denial of an interpreter during voir dire constitutes a structural error that mandates automatic reversal. The district court denied the petition but granted a certificate of appeal-ability on the issue whether \u201cthe state trial court\u2019s failure to provide an interpreter for [Rodriguez] during a portion of voir dire can ever be considered harmless error.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b491-18\">Where the petitioner\u2019s claims have been adjudicated on the merits by the state court, this court\u2019s review of the state court\u2019s decision is deferential under \u00a7 2254. <em>See Mallard v. Cain, </em>515 F.Sd 379, 381 (5th Cir.2008). Federal habeas relief cannot be granted on claims adjudicated on the merits in state court unless the state adjudication was contrary to clearly established federal law as determined by the Supreme Court, involved an unreasonable application of clearly established federal law as determined by the Supreme Court, or was based on an unreasonable determination of the facts. \u00a7 2254(d).</p>\n<p id=\"b491-19\">A state court decision is contrary to clearly established federal law if the decision applies a rule that contradicts the governing law set forth by the Supreme Court or if the decision involves a set of facts that are materially indistinguishable from a Supreme Court decision but reaches a result different from that Court\u2019s precedent. <em>Williams v. Taylor, </em>529 U.S. 362, 405-06, 120 S.Ct. 1495, 146 L.Ed.2d 389 (2000). If the Supreme Court \u201chas not broken sufficient legal ground to establish an asked-for constitutional principle, the lower federal courts cannot themselves establish such a principle with clarity sufficient to satisfy the [\u00a7 2254(d) ] bar,\u201d and habeas relief is prohibited. <em>Williams, </em>529 U.S. at 381, 120 S.Ct. 1495. \u201cIt is not enough, under \u00a7 2254, that a Supreme Court case apply \u2018by extension\u2019 to a pur<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"468\">*468</page-number>ported state court violation; the Supreme Court must speak clearly.\u201d <em>Burgess v. Dretke, </em>350 F.3d 461, 469 (5th Cir.2003).</p>\n<p id=\"b492-4\">Rodriguez has not identified clearly established federal law that applies to his claim that the denial of an interpreter during voir dire is structural error that requires reversal. Accordingly, Rodriguez has not shown that the district court erred in concluding that the state court\u2019s decision is contrary to, or involved an unreasonable application of, clearly established federal law. <em>See </em>\u00a7 2254(d)(1); <em>Burgess, </em>350 F.3d at 469. Accordingly, the judgment of the district court is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b491-14\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
