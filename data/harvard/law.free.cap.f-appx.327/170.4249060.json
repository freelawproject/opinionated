The PSI found that he was accountable for 27.25 ounces (772 grams) of crack cocaine, and his base offense level was 36. After a two-level increase for possession of a firearm, Woods\u2019 total offense level was 38, and he was assigned a criminal history category of III. His guideline range was 292 to 365 months imprisonment.</p>\n<p id=\"b195-16\">The district court adopted the PSI and sentenced Woods to 330 months imprisonment on each count, running concurrently. The court stated that it had sentenced Woods \u201cat the mid-range of the guidelines due to the seriousness of the offense in connection with the age of the defendant,\u201d which was twenty-two at the time of judgment. The court concluded that \u201c[t]he sentence imposed addresses the seriousness of the offense and meets the sentencing objectives of punishment, deterrence, and incapacitation.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b195-17\">In 2008 Woods filed a motion to reduce his sentence under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582(c)(2) based on Amendment 706 to the sentencing guidelines, which was made retroactive by Amendment 713. He requested the opportunity \u201cto address any and all \u00a7 3553(a) factors either in writing or at a hearing.\u201d The district court issued an order finding that Woods\u2019 sentence should be reduced. The court noted that the original 330 month sentence, which had been imposed by a different district judge, was in the middle of the guidelines range. The court found that Woods\u2019 new guidelines range was 235 to 293 months, stated that it had reviewed the \u00a7 3553(a) factors, and said it would impose a similar mid-range <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"172\">*172</page-number>sentence of 264 months unless either party filed a written objection.</p>\n<p id=\"b196-4\">The government did not object, but Woods did. He contended that he should have a chance to address the \u00a7 3553(a) factors because the court did not specify which factors it had reviewed. Woods asked the court to allow him to review the sentencing transcript and to address the \u00a7 3553(a) factors \u201cin writing or at a hearing.\u201d Alternatively, he asked the court to sentence him at the low end of the new guidelines range.</p>\n<p id=\"b196-5\">The district court denied Woods\u2019 request for a hearing; however, it extended the time for filing additional written objections so that Woods could review the sentencing transcript. After the allotted time had run, the court entered an order stating that no further objections had been filed. The court again observed that it had reviewed all of the relevant factors, including the ones set forth in \u00a7 3553(a), and it reduced Woods\u2019 sentence to 264 months as it had proposed in its earlier order.</p>\n<p id=\"b196-6\">Woods filed a motion to vacate, asserting that he had not received notice of the court\u2019s order granting him more time to file additional objections. The court granted Woods\u2019 motion to vacate and gave him extra time. In his objections Woods asserted that: (1) an unconstitutional disparity still existed in sentencing even after the amendment to the crack cocaine guidelines; (2) Woods was denied due process because the court did not hold a hearing; (3) the proposed new sentence did not consider all the factors under \u00a7 3553(a); (4) the proposed new sentence gave unwarranted weight to the reasoning of the original sentencing judge, who imposed the sentence under mandatory guidelines; and (5) the new sentence would perpetuate the unconstitutional mandatory guideline scheme. The district court entered an order stating that it had reviewed Woods\u2019 objections and had considered the \u00a7 3553(a) factors, and it reduced Woods\u2019 sentence from 330 months to 264 months. Woods appeals that judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b196-11\">Woods contends that the district court\u2019s refusal to hold a hearing was a violation of his due process rights because the judge who ruled on his \u00a7 3582(c)(2) motion was not the same one who originally sentenced him. Woods also contends that under <em>United States v. Booker, </em>543 U.S. 220, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005), as interpreted in <em>Gall v. United States, </em>552 U.S. 38, 128 S.Ct. 586, 169 L.Ed.2d 445 (2007), the district court failed to adequately consider the 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a) factors or to explain why it reduced his sentence to 264 months imprisonment.</p>\n<p id=\"b196-12\">We review <em>de novo </em>questions of constitutional law. <em>United States v. Brown, </em>364 F.3d 1266,1268 (11th Cir.2004). However, \u201cthe decision whether or not to grant an evidentiary hearing generally is committed to the discretion of the district court.\u201d <em>United States v. Yesil, </em>991 F.2d 1527, 1531 (11th Cir.1992).</p>\n<p id=\"b196-13\">Woods\u2019 \u00a7 3582(c)(2) resentencing did not require a hearing. Nothing in \u00a7 3582(c)(2) requires a hearing, and Woods\u2019 presence was not required. Fed.R.Crim.P. 43(b)(4) (providing that there is no need for a defendant to be present at a proceeding involving a reduction in his sentence under \u00a7 3582(c)(2)). We have explained that \u201c[a] proceeding under \u00a7 3582(c)(2) is not a full resentencing hearing.\u201d <em>United States v. Melvin, </em>556 F.3d 1190, 1193 (11th Cir. 2009). Furthermore, \u201cthere is no statutory or constitutional right to counsel for a \u00a7 3582(c)(2) motion or hearing,\u201d <em>United States v. Webb, </em>565 F.3d 789, 795 (11th Cir.2009), and by the same reasoning, due process does not mandate a hearing on a \u00a7 3582(c)(2) motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b197-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"173\">*173</page-number>Nothing in the rules governing proceedings under \u00a7 3582(c)(2) requires a different result when the resentencing judge is different from the original sentencing judge.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Neither the original sentencing judge nor the resentencing judge could have made new factual determinations because in a \u00a7 3582(c) proceeding <em>\u201call </em>original sentencing determinations remain unchanged with the sole exception of the guideline range that has been amended since the original sentencing.\u201d <em>United States v. Bravo, </em>203 F.3d 778, 781 (11th Cir.2000). Woods does not contend that the resentencing judge incorrectly calculated the new guideline range.</p>\n<p id=\"b197-5\">Although the district court was not required to hold a hearing for Woods\u2019 re-sentencing, it was required to consider the \u00a7 3553(a) factors to determine the extent of the sentence reduction that would be granted.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> <em>Id. </em>(\u201cAfter recalculating the guidelines, the district court next must consider the sentencing factors listed in 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a), as well as public safety considerations, and may consider the defendant\u2019s post-sentencing conduct, in evaluating whether a reduction in the defendant\u2019s sentence is warranted and the extent of any such reduction.\u201d). However, the district court does not have to \u201carticulate the applicability of each factor, as long as the record as a whole demonstrates that the pertinent factors were taken into account by the district court.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(quotation marks omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b197-10\">Woods asked the court for the opportunity to address the factors \u201cin writing or at a hearing.\u201d The district court gave Woods extra time to review the sentencing transcript and to present his arguments about the \u00a7 3553(a) factors. Woods filed written objections to the district court\u2019s order, which had proposed a reduction of Woods\u2019 sentence to 264 months. The district court stated that it considered Woods\u2019 objections and the \u00a7 3553(a) factors, and it found 264 months to be appropriate. That is enough.</p>\n<p id=\"b197-11\">Woods\u2019 <em>Booker </em>argument also fails because <em>Booker </em>does not apply at resentencing proceedings under \u00a7 3582(c)(2). <em>See United States v. Melvin, </em>556 F.3d 1190, 1192-93 (11th Cir.2009).</p>\n<p id=\"b197-12\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b197-6\">. In analyzing whether a district court provided enough detail about the \u00a7 3553(a) factors when it denied resentencing under \u00a7 3582(c)(2), we have taken into account \"that same district court judge who sentenced Defendant originally was the one who declined to resentence him.\u201d <em>United States v. Eggersdorf, </em>126 F.3d 1318, 1323 (11th Cir. 1997). <em>Eggersdorf </em>did not focus on the identity of the sentencing and resentencing judges in order to determine whether a hearing should have been held or whether the factors were adequately considered in granting a sentence reduction. <em>See id.</em></p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b197-7\"><em>. </em>We have explained:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b197-8\">The \u00a7 3553(a) factors that must be considered by the district court in ruling on a defendant\u2019s \u00a7 3582(c)(2) motion to reduce his sentence include: (1) the nature and circumstances of the offense and the history and characteristics of the defendant; (2) the need for the sentence imposed to accomplish certain aims, such as reflect the seriousness of the offense, afford adequate deterrence, protect the public, or the defendant\u2019s educational, medical, or correctional treatment needs; (3) the kinds of sentences available; (4) the applicable sentencing range under the guidelines; (5) any pertinent Sentencing Commission policy statement; (6) the need to avoid unwarranted sentence disparities among defendants; and (7) the need to provide restitution to victims.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b197-15\"><em>United States v.
