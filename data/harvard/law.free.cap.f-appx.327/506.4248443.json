Charoliya argues that he demonstrated a well-founded fear of persecution based upon the documentary evidence establishing that Hindu extremists seek to persecute and kill Muslims, such as Charoliya. Charoliya also maintains that the documents submitted establish that government officials condone or participate in such actions against Muslims. We conclude from a review of the record that the BIA\u2019s determination is supported by substantial evidence, and the record does not compel a conclusion contrary to the BIA\u2019s denial of withholding of removal. <em>See Eduard v. Ashcroft, </em>379 F.3d 182, 193 (5th Cir.2004); <em>Chun v. INS, </em>40 F.3d 76, 78 (5th Cir.1994); 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 208.16(b).</p>\n<p id=\"b530-18\">Charoliya concedes that his asylum application was untimely and does not challenge the finding that he failed to establish that he was entitled to relief under the CAT; thus, these claims are abandoned. <em>See Soadjede v. Ashcroft, </em>324 F.3d 830, 833 (5th Cir .2003).</p>\n<p id=\"b530-19\">The petition for review is DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b530-22\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir.
