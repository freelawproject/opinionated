Mack argues that the district court erred by failing to reduce his sentence based on Amendment 706 of the Guidelines, <em>see U.S. Sentencing Guidelines Manual </em>\u00a7 2D1.1(c) (2007 &amp; Supp.2008); USSG App. C Amend. 706, and <em>United States v. Booker, </em>543 U.S. 220, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005). As we recently observed, \u201cAmendment 706 ... amended \u00a7 2D1.1 of the Sentencing Guidelines by reducing the offense levels associated with crack cocaine quantities by two levels.\u201d <em>United States v. Hood, </em>556 F.3d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"429\">*429</page-number>226, 232 (4th Cir.2009). Mack\u2019s sentence was determined by the career offender guideline, USSG \u00a7 4B1.1, and was not based on a sentencing range lowered by the amendment. The fact that the district court reduced Mack\u2019s sentence under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(e) (2006) and USSG \u00a7 5K1.1 is irrelevant to the applicability of Amendment 706. <em>Hood, </em>556 F.3d at 234. Moreover, Mack\u2019s contentions that the court could have considered a sentence below the amended guidelines range and that he is entitled to a full resentencing under <em>Booker </em>are foreclosed by our decision in <em>United States v. Dunphy, </em>551 F.3d 247 (4th Cir.2009), <em>petition for cert. filed, </em>77 U.S.L.W. 3559 (U.S. Mar. 20, 2009) (No. 08-1185).</p>\n<p id=\"b453-5\">We have reviewed the record and find no reversible error. Accordingly, we affirm the district court. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b453-6\">\n<em>AFFIRMED.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
