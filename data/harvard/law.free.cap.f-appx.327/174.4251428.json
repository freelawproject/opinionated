In this <em>pro se </em>appeal, he challenges the district court\u2019s reduction of his sentence pursuant to 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582(c)(2). The \u00a7 3582(c)(2) reduction was based on Amendment 706, which reduced Payne\u2019s base offense level from 32 to 30. With his category V criminal history, Payne\u2019s reduced sentence was 151 months\u2019 imprisonment, the minimum of the amended Sentencing Guidelines range.</p>\n<p id=\"b198-23\">On appeal, Payne asserts that the district court should have applied <em>United States v. Booker, </em>543 U.S. 220, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005), and <em>Kimbrough v. United States, 552 </em>U.S. <em>85, 128 </em>S.Ct. 558, 169 L.Ed.2d 481 (2007), at re-sentencing. Specifically, he argues that his reduced sentence was unreasonable because the district court did not explicitly acknowledge that the Guidelines or the 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a) factors were advisory. He also argues that he should have had the opportunity to challenge the legality of considering unindicted drug quantities in his offense conduct. He further argues that his sentence should have conformed to the statutory terms of 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 841(b)(1)(C) because the indictment did not specify any drug quantity, and attrib<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"175\">*175</page-number>uting any drug quantity not found by the jury would be unconstitutional.</p>\n<p id=\"b199-5\">\u201cWe review <em>de novo </em>a district court\u2019s conclusions about the scope of its legal authority under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582(c)(2).\u201d <em>United States v. James, </em>548 F.3d 983, 984 (11th Cir.2008) (per curiam). A district court may modify a term of imprisonment \u201cin the case of a defendant who has been sentenced to a term of imprisonment based on a sentencing range that has subsequently been lowered by the Sentencing Commission ....\u201d18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582(c)(2). Any reduction, however, should be \u201cconsistent with applicable policy statements issued by the Sentencing Commission.\u201d <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 3582(c)(2). The applicable policy statement indicates that \u201cthe court shall not reduce the defendant\u2019s term of imprisonment under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582(c)(2) and this policy statement to a term that is less than the minimum of the amended guideline range .... \u201d U.S. Sentencing Guidelines Manual \u00a7 1B1.10(b)(2)(A) (2008).</p>\n<p id=\"b199-6\">Payne\u2019s arguments are foreclosed by our precedent. We have concluded that <em>\u201cBooker </em>and <em>Kimbrough </em>do not apply to \u00a7 3582(c)(2) proceedings.\u201d <em>United States v. Melvin, </em>556 F.3d 1190, 1190 (11th Cir. 2009) (per curiam), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 129 S.Ct. 2382, 173 L.Ed.2d 1300. We have further held that \u201ca district court is bound by the limitations on its discretion imposed by \u00a7 3582(c)(2) and the applicable policy statements by the Sentencing Commission.\u201d <em>Id. </em>In light of our holding in <em>Melvin, </em>Payne\u2019s challenges based on <em>Booker </em>and <em>Kimbrough </em>to his reduced sentence are meritless. Under the Guidelines, Payne\u2019s sentence cannot be reduced below the level to which the district court has already reduced it.</p>\n<p id=\"b199-9\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
