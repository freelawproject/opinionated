For the reasons set forth below, we will summarily affirm. <em>See </em>I.O.P. 10.6.</p>\n<p id=\"b344-8\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b344-9\">Lindsey commenced an action under 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983 against Paul M. O\u2019Connor, Director of the Pennsylvania Department of Corrections (\u201cDOC\u201d), and the following officials at Lindsey\u2019s prior place of confinement, SCI-Camp Hill: Superintendent Donald L. Kelchner; Sergeant Lucas; and Correctional Officers O\u2019Leary, Simson, and Tomson. Lindsey claimed that Defendants violated his civil rights on various occasions during his confinement at SCI-Camp Hill.</p>\n<p id=\"b344-11\">According to Lindsey\u2019s complaint, he was transferred to R Block at SCI-Camp Hill on March 3, 2008. Following his arrival at R Block, he had a verbal exchange with Defendant Tomson, which resulted in Tomson confiscating his identification card. On March 5, 2008, Lindsey claimed that he was subjected to verbal harassment by Defendant O\u2019Leary. O\u2019Leary allegedly \u201ccalled into\u201d Lindsey\u2019s prison cell suggesting that Lindsey was sexually attracted to his cell mate. The next day, Lindsey\u2019s cell mate was removed.</p>\n<p id=\"b344-12\">On March 6, 2008, Defendant Tomson allegedly told Lindsey that because he no longer had a cell mate, the harassment was \u201cjust beginning.\u201d The following day, Lindsey claimed that Defendants Lucas, O\u2019Leary, Tomson and Simson came to his cell, and Defendant Lucas grabbed him and threatened him with his fist. The following morning, according to Lindsey, he was denied breakfast at Lucas\u2019 request.</p>\n<p id=\"b344-14\">Lindsey filed a \u00a7 1983 action seeking declaratory and injunctive relief as well as compensatory and punitive damages. The District Court granted Lindsey\u2019s motion to proceed in forma pauperis but later dismissed his complaint pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(e)(2)(B)(i). Lindsey filed a timely appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b344-15\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b344-16\">We have jurisdiction over this appeal pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291. <em>See Tourscher v. McCullough, </em>184 F.3d 236, 240 (3d Cir.1999). After a careful review of the record, we conclude that the appeal presents \u201cno substantial question\u201d under Third Circuit LAR 27.4 and I.O.P. 10.6. We will therefore summarily affirm the District Court\u2019s order on the grounds that Lindsey\u2019s claims were not viable.</p>\n<p id=\"b344-17\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b344-18\">The District Court correctly determined that Lindsey\u2019s complaint was subject to dismissal under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(e)(2)(B)(i). As an initial matter, Defendants O\u2019Connor and Kelcher were not appropriate Defendants in the action, as there was no allegation they were involved in the events which gave rise to Lindsey\u2019s claim. Civil rights claims cannot be premised on a theory of <em>respondeat superior. See Rode v. Dellarciprete, </em>845 F.2d 1195, 1207 (3d Cir.1988).</p>\n<p id=\"b344-19\">The District Court also correctly concluded that Lindsey\u2019s claim against Defendants Lucas, O\u2019Leary, Tomson and Simson regarding their alleged verbal abuse of him did not present a viable claim <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"321\">*321</page-number>under \u00a7 1983. Verbal harassment of a prisoner, although distasteful, does not violate the Eighth Amendment. <em>See, e.g., McBride v. Deer, </em>240 F.3d 1287, 1291 n. 3 (10th Cir.2001).</p>\n<p id=\"b345-5\">The District Court also properly dismissed Lindsey\u2019s other Eighth Amendment claims against Defendant Lucas. As mentioned above, Lindsey claimed that Lucas grabbed him and threatened him when he was outside of his cell on March 7, 2008. He did not claim that he suffered any injury as a result. The following day, Lindsey claimed that Lucas denied him breakfast. The District Court correctly determined that Lucas\u2019s alleged grabbing of Lindsey did not constitute a violation of the Eighth Amendment\u2019s cruel and unusual punishment provision. The Eighth Amendment does not protect an inmate against an objectively <em>de minimis </em>use of force. <em>See Smith v. Mensinger, </em>293 F.3d 641, 648 (3d Cir.2002).</p>\n<p id=\"b345-6\">Lindsey\u2019s other claim against Lucas\u2014that he denied him food on one occasion in violation of the Eighth Amendment\u2014also fails. The purported deprivation of a single meal is not of such magnitude as to rise to the level of a constitutional violation. <em>See Robles v. Coughlin, </em>725 F.2d 12, 15 (2d Cir. 1983) (only a substantial deprivation of food to a prisoner sets forth a viable Eighth Amendment claim).</p>\n<p id=\"b345-7\">Finally, the District Court properly dismissed Lindsey\u2019s claim that Defendant Tomson impermissibly confiscated his identification card. To the extent this was a due process claim, it was flawed. A prisoner\u2019s cause of action based on unauthorized depi\u2019ivation of property by a state actor is not actionable under \u00a7 1983 unless there is no adequate post-deprivation remedy available. <em>See Parratt v. Taylor, </em>451 U.S. 527, 542, 101 S.Ct. 1908, 68 L.Ed.2d 420 (1981). As noted by the District Court, Pennsylvania law provided an adequate remedy in Lindsey\u2019s case. Furthermore, we perceive no other constitutional ground that his allegation implicated.</p>\n<p id=\"b345-9\">For the foregoing reasons, we conclude that there is no substantial question presented by this appeal. Accordingly, we will summarily affirm the District Court\u2019s dismissal of Lindsey\u2019s complaint. <em>See </em>Third Cir. LAR 27.4; I.O.P. 10.6.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
