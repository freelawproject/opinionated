Mulligan denying his applications for asylum, withholding of removal, and relief under the Convention Against Torture (\u201cCAT\u201d). <em>In re Jian Jiang, </em>No. A 99 523 170 (B.I.A. Feb. 7, 2008), <em>aff'g </em>No. A 99 523 170 (Immig. Ct. N.Y. City June 26, 2006). We assume the parties\u2019 familiarity with the underlying facts and procedural history in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b300-10\">When the BIA agrees with the IJ\u2019s conclusion that a petitioner is not credible and, without rejecting any of the IJ\u2019s grounds for decision, emphasizes particular aspects of that decision, this Court reviews both the BIA\u2019s and IJ\u2019s opinions\u2014 or more precisely, the Court reviews the IJ\u2019s decision including the portions not explicitly discussed by the BIA. <em>Yun-Zui Guan v. Gonzales, </em>432 F.3d 391, 394 (2d Cir.2005). We review the agency\u2019s factual findings, including adverse credibility determinations, under the substantial evidence standard. 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(b)(4)(B); <em>see also Corovic v. Mukasey, </em>519 F.3d 90, 95 (2d Cir.2008). For asylum applications governed by the REAL ID Act of 2005, the agency may, considering the totality of the circumstances, base a credibility finding on an asylum applicant\u2019s demeanor, the plausibility of his or her account, and inconsistencies in his or her statements, without regard to whether they go \u201cto the heart of the applicant\u2019s claim.\u201d 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1158(b)(1)(B)(iii). Thus, we \u201cdefer to an IJ\u2019s credibility determination unless, from the totality of the circumstances, it is plain that no reasonable fact-finder could make such an adverse credibility ruling.\u201d <em>Xiu Xia Lin v. Mukasey, </em>534 F.3d 162, 167 (2d Cir.2008).</p>\n<p id=\"b300-12\">As an initial matter, Jiang failed to exhaust before the BIA any argument challenging the IJ\u2019s findings that: 1) his testimony was internally inconsistent; and 2) that his testimony was inconsistent with his asylum application. <em>See Lin Zhong v. U.S. Dep\u2019t of Justice, </em>480 F.3d 104, 119-20 (2d Cir.2007). Therefore, those findings stand as valid bases for the IJ\u2019s credibility determination. <em>See Shunfu Li v. Mukasey, </em>529 F.3d 141, 146-147 (2d Cir.2008). Thus, the only issue before this Court is whether the IJ erred in relying on his observation of Jiang\u2019s demeanor to support his adverse credibility determination. We find no error in the IJ\u2019s assessment of Jiang\u2019s demeanor. Although Jiang argues that the IJ made \u201cvague assertions\u201d about his testimony and failed to support his demeanor finding with examples from Jiang\u2019s testimony, that argument is belied by the record. In assessing Jiang\u2019s demeanor, the IJ stated that Jiang \u201cfailed to provided details to answers that one would expect [] responses to, and his answers were very short, very tight, and without a natural flow to his testimony.\u201d We generally afford deference to the trier of fact\u2019s assessment of demeanor and find no rea<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"277\">*277</page-number>son not to do so here. <em>See Majidi v. Gonzales, </em>430 F.3d 77, 81 n. 1 (2d Cir. 2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b301-5\">Ultimately, substantial evidence supports the IJ\u2019s \u00a7 1252(b)(4)(B); <em>Xiu Xia Lin, </em>534 F.3d at 167. Therefore, the IJ properly denied Jiang\u2019s application for asylum, withholding of removal, and CAT relief because the only evidence that he would be persecuted or tortured depended on his credibility. <em>See Paul v. Gonzales, </em>444 F.3d 148,156 (2d Cir.2006).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b301-6\">For the foregoing reasons, the petition for review is DENIED. As we have completed our review, any pending motion for a stay of removal in this petition is DISMISSED as moot. Any pending request for oral argument in this petition is DENIED in accordance with Federal Rule of Appellate Procedure 34(a)(2), and Second Circuit Local Rule 34(b).</p>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b301-15\">. We find no merit in the government's argument that Jiang failed to exhaust his withholding of removal and CAT claims.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
