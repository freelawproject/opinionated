MURPHY, Circuit Judge.</author>\n<p id=\"b837-18\">After examining Appellant\u2019s brief and the appellate record, this court has determined unanimously that oral argument would not materially assist the determination of this appeal. <em>See </em>Fed. RApp. P. 34(a)(2); 10th Cir. R. 34.1(G). The case is therefore ordered submitted without oral argument.</p>\n<p id=\"b837-19\">In 2008, appellant James K. Conkleton, a Colorado state prisoner, filed a complaint pursuant to 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983. The first claim for relief centered around Conkleton\u2019s participation in a sex offender treatment program. According to Conkleton, his due process rights were violated when <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"814\">*814</page-number>he was terminated from the program in 2003 and denied reentry in 2006. In connection with this claim, Conkleton sought a preliminary injunction requiring Defendants to place him in a sex offender treatment program. The district court denied Conkleton\u2019s motion, concluding he failed \u201cto allege facts that demonstrate he is facing immediate and irreparable injury.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b838-4\">This court reviews the denial of a preliminary injunction under an abuse of discretion standard. <em>Gen. Motors Corp. v. Urban Gorilla, LLC, </em>500 F.3d 1222, 1226 (10th Cir.2007). Having reviewed the record, Conkleton\u2019s appellate brief, and the applicable law, we can discern no reversible error by the district court. Exercising jurisdiction pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1292(a)(1), we affirm the district court\u2019s order of January 21, 2009, for substantially the reasons stated therein. Conkleton\u2019s motion to proceed <em>in forma pauperis </em>on appeal is granted. Conkleton is reminded that he remains obligated to continue making partial payments until his appellate filing fee is paid in full. <em>See </em>28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(b).</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b837-10\"> This order and judgment is not binding precedent except under the doctrines of law of the case, res judicata, and collateral estoppel. It may be cited, however, for its persuasive value consistent with Fed. R.App. P. 32.1 and 10th Cir. R. 32.1.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
