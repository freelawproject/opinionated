McLeroy argues that the administrative law judge posed to the vocational expert a hypothetical question that contained an incorrect standard to determine whether McLeroy\u2019s skills were transferable. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b162-18\">We review the decision by the Commissioner \u201cto determine if it is supported by substantial evidence and based on proper legal standards.\u201d <em>Lewis v. Callahan, 125 </em>F.3d 1436, 1439 (11th Cir.1997). Substantial evidence consists of \u201csuch relevant evidence as a reasonable person would accept as adequate to support a conclusion.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1440. When the administrative law judge denies benefits and the Appeals Council denies review, we review the decision of the administrative law judge as the final decision of the Commissioner. <em>Doughty v. Apfel, </em>245 F.3d 1274, 1278 (11th Cir.2001).</p>\n<p id=\"b162-19\">The administrative law judge posed an accurate hypothetical question to the voca<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"139\">*139</page-number>tional expert. McLeroy argues that the administrative law judge should have asked the vocational expert whether McLeroy had skills that were transferable \u201cwith little or no vocational training or job orientation,\u201d but that standard does not apply to McLeroy. The regulations provide that skills must be transferable with little or no adjustment either (1) to applicants aged 55 or older who are limited to sedentary work or (2) to applicants who are capable of light work and are between 60 and 64 years old. 20 C.F.R. pt. 404, subpt. P, app. 2 \u00a7\u00a7 201.00(f), 202.00(f). McLeroy does not challenge the finding of the administrative law judge that he can perform light work and the administrative law judge made that finding when McLeroy was 57 years old. When an applicant is limited to light work, the \u201cpresence of acquired skills that are readily transferable to a significant range of semi-skilled or skilled work within an individual\u2019s residual functional capacity would ordinarily warrant a finding of not disabled regardless of the adversity of age....\u201d 20 C.F.R. pt. 404, subpt. P, app. 2, \u00a7 202.00(e). The hypothetical question posed to the vocational expert about whether there would \u201cbe much in the way of adjustment required in the terms of tools or work processes, work settings, or the industry\u201d enabled the administrative law judge to determine if McLeroy\u2019s skills were \u201creadily transferable.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b163-5\">The judgment in favor of the Commissioner is AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
