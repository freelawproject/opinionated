Schriro, </em>189 F.3d 781, 783 (8th Cir.1999) (per curiam), we conclude that the federal constitutional challenges raised in plaintiffs\u2019 complaint fail. We affirm the preservice dismissal of the complaint, but we modify it to be without prejudice as to the state-law claims, <em>see Labickas v. Ark. State Univ., </em>78 F.3d 333, 334-35 (8th Cir.1996) (per curiam) (following dismissal of federal claims, district court may dismiss state-law claims without prejudice). We also conclude that the district court did not clearly <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"669\">*669</page-number>abuse its discretion in denying the intervention motions filed under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 24(b). <em>See South Dakota ex rel. Barnett v.
