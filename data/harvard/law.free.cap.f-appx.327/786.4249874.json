R.App. P. 34(f); 10th Cir. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"787\">*787</page-number>R. 34.1(G). The case is, therefore, submitted without oral argument.</p>\n<p id=\"b811-5\">Kevin Petties pleaded guilty to participating in a conspiracy to distribute cocaine base (\u201ccrack\u201d). The district court sentenced Petties to 210 months\u2019 imprisonment and 10 years\u2019 supervised release. After the 2007 amendment of the crack-related Sentencing Guidelines, the district court modified Petties\u2019s sentence to 168 months\u2019 imprisonment. Petties now appeals his modified sentence, challenging the district court\u2019s denial of his request for a sentence below the amended Sentencing Guidelines range. We exercise jurisdiction pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291, and affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b811-6\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b811-7\">A federal grand jury indicted Petties and eleven co-defendants on eighteen counts of drug-related crimes. Petties pleaded guilty to one count of conspiracy to possess with intent to distribute fifty grams or more of crack within 1000 feet of a school in violation of 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 846, 841(a)(1), (b)(l)(A)(iii), and 860(a). After Petties entered his plea, a probation officer prepared a presentence report (\u201cPSR\u201d). The PSR listed a base offense level of 35, a 2-level enhancement for Pet-ties\u2019s role as a leader in the criminal activity, and a 3-level reduction for Petties\u2019s acceptance of responsibility and timely providing authorities with information concerning his involvement in the offense. Petties\u2019s recommended offense level was 34. With a criminal history category of IV, Petties\u2019s Sentencing Guidelines range was 210 to 262 months\u2019 imprisonment. The district court adopted the recommendations in the PSR and sentenced Petties to 210 months\u2019 imprisonment and 10 years\u2019 supervised release.</p>\n<p id=\"b811-8\">On November 1, 2007, the United States Sentencing Commission promulgated Amendment 706, which amended the Drug Quantity Table in U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2Dl.l(c). U.S.S.GApp. C, Arned. 706 (2007). Amendment 706 provided a 2-level reduction in base offense levels for crack-related offenses. <em>Id. </em>On December 11, 2007, the Sentencing Commission promulgated Amendments 712 and 713, which, together, operated to make Amendment 706 retroactive. Amendments 712 and 713 became effective on March 3, 2008.</p>\n<p id=\"b811-11\">Petties filed a pro se motion requesting a reduction of his sentence under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582(c)(2). Petties requested a sentence of 168 months\u2019 imprisonment. The government filed a response to Pet-ties\u2019s motion, indicating that it did not object to a modified sentence within the revised Sentencing Guidelines range of 168 to 210 months\u2019 imprisonment; the government objected to any sentence less than 168 months\u2019 imprisonment.</p>\n<p id=\"b811-12\">On August 18, 2008, the district court held a resentencing hearing. Petties\u2019s counsel requested a sentence of 135 months\u2019 imprisonment because Petties \u201chas been an absolute model prisoner.\u201d R. Vol. Ill at 16. Without addressing Pet-ties\u2019s argument or any response from the government, the district court stated that the matter came \u201cbefore the Court for sentencing pursuant to motion by the defendant in accordance with 18 United States Code Section 3582(c)(2).... The Court ... reviewed the [PSR] factual findings and ... considered the sentencing applications and the factors set forth in 18 United States Code 3553(a)(1) through (7).\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 17. The district court calculated Petties\u2019s amended offense level to be 32, with a Sentencing Guidelines range of 168 to 210 months\u2019 imprisonment. The district court then modified Petties\u2019s sentence by reducing his term of imprisonment to 168 months.</p>\n<p id=\"b812-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"788\">*788</page-number>II</p>\n<p id=\"b812-4\">On appeal, Petties argues that the district court erred by assuming that it lacked \u201cthe authority to impose a sentence that is less than the minimum of the amended guideline range based on U.S.S.G. \u00a7 lB1.10(b)(2)(A), because the sentencing hearing was pursuant to 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582(c)(2)....\u201d Aplt. Br. at 5. Because the issue presented raises a question of law, we review de novo the scope of a district court\u2019s resentencing authority under \u00a7 3582(c)(2). <em>United States v. Rhodes, </em>549 F.3d 833, 837 (10th Cir.2008), <em>cert. </em>denied,-U.S.-, 129 S.Ct. 2052, 173 L.Ed.2d 1136 (2009).</p>\n<p id=\"b812-7\">Petties argues that the district court improperly considered itself bound by U.S.S.G. \u00a7 1B1.10, and consequently assumed it lacked authority to sentence him to less than the minimum of the amended Sentencing Guidelines range. Petties contends these assumptions contradict <em>United States v. Booker, </em>543 U.S. 220, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005). As Petties acknowledges, we rejected this argument in <em>Rhodes. </em>549 F.3d at 840 (\u201c[W]e conclude that <em>Booker </em>simply has no bearing on sentencing modification proceedings conducted under \u00a7 3582(c)(2).\u201d). Although Petties argues that \u201c[t]he reasoning of <em>Rhodes </em>is flawed,\u201d Aplt. Br. at 9, \u201cthis panel cannot overturn the decision of another panel of this court barring en banc reconsideration, a superseding contrary Supreme Court decision, or authorization of all currently active judges on the court.\u201d <em>United States v. Edward J., </em>224 F.3d 1216, 1220 (10th Cir.2000) (quotation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b812-8\">Petties also contends that this court erred in <em>Rhodes </em>by reading 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582(c)(2) and U.S.S.G. \u00a7 1B1.10 to limit the district court\u2019s discretion when resentencing a defendant under \u00a7 3582(c)(2). Section 3582(c)(2) provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b812-9\">in the case of a defendant who has been sentenced to a term of imprisonment based on a sentencing range that has subsequently been lowered by the Sentencing Commission pursuant to 28 U.S.C. 994(o), upon motion of the defendant or the Director of the Bureau of Prisons, or on its own motion, the court may reduce the term of imprisonment, after considering the factors set forth in section 3553(a) to the extent that they are applicable, <em>if such a reduction is consistent with applicable policy statements issued, by the Sentencing Commission.</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b812-10\">18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582(c)(2) (emphasis added). Section 1B1.10 of the U.S.S.G. sets forth the applicable policy statements from the Sentencing Commission: \u201c[T]he court shall not reduce the defendant\u2019s term of imprisonment under 18 U.S.C. 3582(c)(2) and this policy statement to a term that is less than the minimum of the amended guideline range.... \u201d U.S.S.G. \u00a7 lB1.10(b)(2)(A). In <em>Rhodes, </em>we read \u00a7 1B1.10 to be binding on district courts, concluding that district courts \u201clack[ ] the authority to impose a modified sentence that [falls] below the amended guideline range.\u201d 549 F.3d at 841. Therefore, a reduction in sentence below the amended sentencing guidelines range at a \u00a7 3582 sentence modification proceeding is impermissible because it would be inconsistent with the policy statement in \u00a7 1B1.10.</p>\n<p id=\"b812-11\">Petties argues that this conclusion overlooks the Supreme Court\u2019s instruction that a policy statement from the Sentencing Commission cannot violate a court\u2019s statutory or constitutional sentencing obligations. Aplt. Br. at 10 (citing <em>Stinson v. United States, </em>508 U.S. 36, 38, 113 S.Ct. 1913, 123 L.Ed.2d 598 (1993)). Because the relevant statute, 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582(c)(2), explicitly references the applicability of Sentencing Commission policy statements, the policy statement does not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"789\">*789</page-number>violate the controlling statute. The only-constitutional rights Petties identifies are Sixth Amendment rights defined in <em>Booker. Rhodes, </em>however, clarified that <em>Booker </em>is not applicable to sentence modification proceedings held pursuant to \u00a7 3582(c)(2). 549 F.3d at 840. Thus, the relevant policy statement does not violate any identified statutory or constitutional obligation.</p>\n<p id=\"b813-5\">Ill</p>\n<p id=\"b813-6\">We conclude that the district court properly resentenced Petties under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582(c)(2) and denied his request for a sentence below the amended guideline range.</p>\n<p id=\"b813-7\">Affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b810-14\"> This order and judgment is not binding precedent, except under the doctrines of law of the case, res judicata, and collateral estoppel. It may be cited, however, for its persuasive value consistent with Fed. R.App. P. 32.1 and 10th Cir. R. 32.1.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
