After applying for asylum in 1991, Tax returned to Guatemala at least twice, in 1991 and 1996. Accordingly, after a hearing in August 2007, the IJ denied Tax\u2019s application for asylum and withholding of removal. <em>See </em>8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1208.8(a) (\u201cAn applicant who leaves the United States without first obtaining advance parole ... shall be presumed to have abandoned his or her application [for asylum, withholding of removal, or CAT relief] under this section.\u201d). Tax appealed the IJ\u2019s judgment to the BIA. The BIA adopted and affirmed the IJ\u2019s decision and noted specifically its \u201cagreement with the Immigration Judge\u2019s conclusion that respondent abandoned his asylum application when he departed the United States without first obtaining advance parole.\u201d Tax now petitions for review of th\u00e9 BIA\u2019s decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b869-13\">It is clear that the IJ and BIA denied Tax\u2019s application because he failed to overcome the presumption that traveling abroad without obtaining advance parole abandons a petition for asylum and withholding of removal. <em>See 8 </em>C.F.R. \u00a7\u00a7 1208.8; 1208.1(a). Yet, in his brief to this Court, Tax fails to address that issue or even to mention it. Instead, his brief focuses exclusively on Tax\u2019s allegations of persecution in Guatemala.</p>\n<p id=\"b869-14\">An appellant\u2019s brief must set forth his \u201ccontentions and the reasons for them, with citations to the authorities and parts of the record on which the appellant relies.\u201d Fed. R.App. P. 28(a)(9)(A). Because Tax has failed to make any argument that his travel abroad did not abandon his asylum application, his brief is insufficient to raise that claim and the issue is abandoned. <em>See, e.g., Sepulveda v. U.S. Attorney Gen., </em>401 F.3d 1226, 1228 n. 2 (11th Cir.2005) (\u201cWhen an appellant fails to offer argument on an issue, that issue is abandoned.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b869-15\">In sum, Tax has made no argument that the BIA and IJ erred in deeming his application abandoned. Therefore we dismiss Tax\u2019s petition for review.</p>\n<p id=\"b869-16\">PETITION DISMISSED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
