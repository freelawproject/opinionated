Polhamus, David Lawrence, Jerry Harris, and Gary Bollinger. Moore also seeks a new trial on their state law discrimination claim. We affirm in part, vacate in part, and remand for further proceedings consistent with this disposition.</p>\n<p id=\"b30-16\">We reject Moore\u2019s 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983 claim that the defendants violated his constitutional right to procedural due process by utilizing an allegedly biased decisionmaker and failing to produce all of the evidence considered against him at his pre-termination hearing. The defendants provided Moore with notice and a hearing, in compliance with the minimum requirements of <em>Cleveland Board of Education v. Loudermill, </em>470 U.S. 532, 538-46, 105 S.Ct. 1487, 84 L.Ed.2d 494 (1985). Furthermore, even assuming the pre-termi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"7\">*7</page-number>nation hearing was procedurally deficient, available post-hearing remedies in the form of detailed grievance procedures established by the collective bargaining agreement satisfied Moore\u2019s procedural due process right to present evidence before an impartial decision maker. <em>See Walker v. City of Berkeley, </em>951 F.2d 182, 184-85 (9th Cir.1991).</p>\n<p id=\"b31-5\">We also reject Moore\u2019s 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983 claim that his discharge for dereliction of duty violated his substantive due process right to engage in the occupation of his choosing. <em>See Engquist v. Or. Dep\u2019t of Agric., </em>478 F.3d 985, 997-98 (9th Cir. 2007), <em>aff'd on other grounds, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 128 S.Ct. 2146, 170 L.Ed.2d 975 (2008). The Fire District has subsequently rehired Moore, and he has apparently been working as a Firefighter First Class since 2006. Therefore, he cannot meet his heavy burden of demonstrating that the defendants\u2019 actions have made it \u201cvirtually impossible\u201d for him to find employment in his chosen profession. <em>See id. </em>at 998-99 (internal quotation marks omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b31-8\">Pursuant to the Washington Supreme Court\u2019s recent decision in <em>Hale v. Wellpinit School District No. 49, </em>198 P.3d 1021, 165 Wash.2d 494 (2009), we vacate the judgment as to Moore\u2019s state law discrimination claim. The Washington state legislature\u2019s retroactive application of its 2007 amendment adding a statutory definition for \u201cdisability\u201d to the Washington Law Against Discrimination, Rev.Code Wash. \u00a7 49.60.040(25) (2008), does not violate the state constitution\u2019s separation of powers doctrine. <em>Hale, </em>198 P.3d at 1024-25, 1028, 165 Wash.2d at 501-02, 509-10. The amended definition therefore applies to Moore\u2019s cause of action, rendering improper the district court\u2019s instruction to the jury defining disability according to <em>McClarty v. Totem Electric, </em>137 P.3d 844, 851, 157 Wash.2d 214, 228 (2006) (en banc). Moore\u2019s state law discrimination claim is remanded to the district court for further proceedings consistent with this disposition.</p>\n<p id=\"b31-12\">Finally, because the defendants are no longer the \u201cprevailing party[,]\u201d we vacate the district court\u2019s award of taxation of costs. <em>See </em>Fed.R.Civ.P. 54(d).</p>\n<p id=\"b31-13\">AFFIRMED in part; VACATED and REMANDED in part.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b30-9\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9th Cir.
