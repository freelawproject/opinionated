Citing our decision in <em>United States v. Moore, </em>541 F.3d 1323 (11th Cir.2008), the district court held that Amendment 706 was inapplicable because Gibson had been sentenced as a career offender. Gibson now appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b190-5\">On appeal, Gibson argues that the district court erred in concluding that it lacked authority under \u00a7 3582(c)(2) to reduce his sentence due to the fact that he was sentenced as a career offender. Specifically, Gibson asserts that the district court had the authority to reduce his sentence because (1) he received a downward variance when originally sentenced, and (2) <em>United States v. Booker, </em>543 U.S. 220, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005), and <em>Kimbrough v. United States, </em>552 U.S. 85, 128 S.Ct. 558,169 L.Ed.2d 481 (2007), gave the court authority to reduce his sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b190-6\">\u201cWe review <em>de novo </em>a district court\u2019s conclusions about the scope of its legal authority under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582(c)(2).\u201d <em>United States v. James, </em>548 F.3d 983, 984 (11th Cir.2008). A district court may modify a term of imprisonment in the case of a defendant sentenced to a term of imprisonment based on a sentence range that has been lowered by the Sentencing Commission. 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582(c)(2). Any reduction, however, must be \u201cconsistent with applicable policy statements issued by the Sentencing Commission.\u201d <em>Id. </em>The applicable policy statements, found in U.S.S.G. \u00a7 1B1.10, state that \u201cthe court shall not reduce the defendant\u2019s term of imprisonment under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582(c)(2) and this policy statement to a term that is less than the minimum of the amended guideline range.\u201d U.S.S.G. \u00a7 1B1.10(b)(2)(A).</p>\n<p id=\"b190-9\">The district court was prohibited from granting Gibson \u00a7 3582(c)(2) relief because, while he received a downward variance, he was sentenced as a career offender. <em>See </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7 1B1.10, cmt. (n.1(A)) (prohibiting reduction where \u201camendment does not have the effect of lowering the defendant\u2019s applicable guideline range because of the operation of another guideline\u201d); <em>Moore, </em>541 F.3d at 1330 (holding that a district court lacks authority under \u00a7 3582(c)(2) to reduce a defendant\u2019s sentence when the defendant was sentenced under \u00a7 4B1.1 as a career offender). Additionally, Gibson\u2019s <em>Booker </em>and <em>Kimbrough </em>arguments are foreclosed by our precedent. <em>See United States v. Melvin, </em>556 F.3d 1190, 1192-93 (11th Cir.2009), <em>petition for cert. filed, </em>(U.S. Feb. 10, 2009) (No. 08-8664) (holding that <em>Booker </em>and <em>Kimbrough </em>do not apply at resentencing proceedings under \u00a7 3582(c)(2)).</p>\n<p id=\"b190-10\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b190-7\">. This case is before this court for the third time. In <em>U.S. v. Gibson, 92 </em>Fed.Appx. 781, PIN (11th Cir.2004), we vacated Gibson's sentence of 140 months and remanded the case for resentencing. The court reimposed the 140 months\u2019 sentence, and he appealed. In <em>United. States </em>v. <em>Gibson, </em>434 F.3d 1234 (11th Cir.2006), we vacated that sentence and remanded the case for resentencing. The district court resentenced him to the same prison term, 140 months.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
