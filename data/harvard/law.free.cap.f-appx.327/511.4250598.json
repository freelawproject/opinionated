He argues that his sentence within the Sentencing Guidelines range is unreasonable in light of his difficult past, his genuine attempts to rehabilitate, and the effect that incarceration would have on his wife and his infant son. He argues that the sentence was greater than necessary to fulfill the sentencing purposes of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a). Relying on <em>Kimbrough v. United States, </em>552 U.S. 85, 128 S.Ct. 558, 574-75, 169 L.Ed.2d 481 (2007), Carrillo argues that the presumption of reasonableness, <em>see United States v. Alonzo, </em>435 F.3d 551, 553 (5th Cir.2006), should not apply to his illegal reentry sentence because it is not based on empirical data or experience. He argues that his criminal history was double-counted because it was used to determine his offense level and his criminal history category.</p>\n<p id=\"b535-21\">Double counting is not impermissible unless the Guidelines so state. <em>United States v. Calbat, </em>266 F.3d 358, 364 (5th Cir.2001). The sentencing transcript shows</p>\n<p id=\"b536-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"512\">*512</page-number>that the court listened to and considered Carrillo\u2019s arguments and articulated reasons for rejecting those arguments and imposing a sentence at the bottom of the applicable guidelines range. <em>See Rita v. United States, </em>551 U.S. 338, 127 S.Ct. 2456, 2468-69, 168 L.Ed.2d 203 (2007). The district court considered the sentencing factors set forth in 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a), including Carrillo\u2019s history, his new marriage, and his infant son and concluded that a guidelines sentence was sufficient but not greater than necessary to comply with the provisions of \u00a7 3553(a). Accordingly, the sentence was not substantively unreasonable. <em>See, e.g., United States v. Campos-Maldonado, </em>531 F.3d 337, 339 (5th Cir.2008). Carrillo has failed to demonstrate that the district court abused its discretion in imposing a within-guidelines sentence. <em>See Gall v. United States, </em>552 U.S. 38, 128 S.Ct. 586, 597, 169 L.Ed.2d 445 (2007). His sentence is therefore AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b535-15\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
