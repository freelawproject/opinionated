On appeal, Wright argues that the Administrative Law Judge\u2019s (\u201cALJ\u2019s\u201d) decision denying benefits is not supported by substantial evidence because the ALJ\u2019s hypothetical questions to the Vocational Expert (\u201cVE\u201d) did not include all of his mental health impairments.</p>\n<p id=\"b160-20\">In a Social Security case, we review the Commissioner\u2019s factual findings to determine if they are supported by substantial evidence. <em>Ingram, v. Comm\u2019r of Soc. Sec. Admin., </em>496 F.3d 1253, 1260 (11th Cir. 2007). Substantial evidence is defined as \u201crelevant evidence as a reasonable person would accept as adequate to support a conclusion.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(quoting <em>Bloodsworth v. Heckler, </em>703 F.2d 1233, 1239 (11th Cir. 1983)). \u201c\u2018We may not decide the facts anew, reweigh the evidence, or substitute our judgment for that of the [Commissioner].\u2019 \u201d <em>Phillips v. Barnhart, </em>357 F.3d 1232, 1240 n. 8 (11th Cir.2004) (quoting <em>Bloodsworth, </em>703 F.2d at 1239). The Commissioner\u2019s legal conclusions are reviewed <em>de novo. Ingram, </em>496 F.3d at 1260.</p>\n<p id=\"b160-21\">The Social Security regulations provide a five-step sequential evaluation process for determining whether a claimant is disabled. <em>See </em>20 C.F.R. \u00a7 404.1520. The claimant has the burden of proof with re<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"137\">*137</page-number>spect to the first four steps: (1) whether he is currently performing a substantial gainful activity; (2) whether he has a severe impairment; (3) whether that severe impairment meets or exceeds an impairment in the listings; and (4) whether he can perform his past relevant work. <em>Phillips, </em>357 F.3d at 1237-39. Under the fifth step, the burden shifts to the Commissioner to show that the claimant can perform other jobs that exist in the national economy. <em>Id. </em>at 1240,1241 n. 10.</p>\n<p id=\"b161-5\">One way in which an ALJ may determine whether such jobs exist is by posing hypothetical questions to a VE. <em>Id. </em>at 1240. \u201c \u2018In order for a vocational expert\u2019s testimony to constitute substantial evidence, the ALJ must pose a hypothetical question which comprises all of the claimant\u2019s impairments.\u2019 \u201d <em>Ingram, </em>496 F.3d at 1270 (quoting <em>Wilson v. Barnhart, </em>284 F.3d 1219, 1227 (11th Cir.2002)). However, the ALJ is not required to include findings in the hypothetical that the ALJ properly rejects. <em>See Crawford v. Comm\u2019r of Social Security, </em>363 F.3d 1155, 1161 (11th Cir.2004) (findings rejected as unsupported). Moreover, if additional impairments asserted by a claimant are not supported by substantial evidence, they do not need to be included in a hypothetical. <em>Id. </em>A hypothetical need not include \u201ceach and every symptom\u201d alleged by a claimant. <em>Ingram, </em>496 F.3d at 1270.</p>\n<p id=\"b161-6\">Under Steps 4 and 5, the ALJ must determine the claimant\u2019s residual functional capacity (\u201cRFC\u201d). \u201cThe residual functional capacity is an assessment, based upon all of the relevant evidence, of a claimant\u2019s remaining ability to do work despite his impairments.\u201d <em>Lewis v. Callahan, </em>125 F.3d 1436, 1440 (11th Cir.1997) (citing 20 C.F.R. \u00a7 404.1545(a)). In evaluating the claimant\u2019s RFC, the ALJ must give substantial weight to the opinions of a treating physician unless the ALJ identifies \u201cgood cause\u201d for not doing so. <em>Id. </em>The ALJ is not required to give the same amount of weight to the opinions of a non-examining physician. <em>Broughton v. Heckler, </em>776 F.2d 960, 961-62 (11th Cir.1985). The ALJ is required \u201cto state with particularity weight he gave the different medical opinions.\u201d <em>Sharfarz v. Bowen, </em>825 F.2d 278 (11th Cir.1987).</p>\n<p id=\"b161-8\">In this case, the evidence in the record demonstrates that Wright had moderate difficulties in maintaining his concentration, persistence and pace, and moderate difficulties in social functioning. He was also limited to work involving simple tasks or simple instructions. The ALJ included all of these limitations in his hypothetical questions to the VE. Although Wright was also diagnosed with Personality Disorder NOS, the record did not include any functional limitations caused by this disorder, and, therefore, we conclude that the ALJ did not have to include this diagnosis in his hypotheticals. Accordingly, we affirm the district court\u2019s order affirming the Commissioner\u2019s denial of benefits.</p>\n<p id=\"b161-9\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
