The first two are judgment orders describing the total amount of the Snyders\u2019 federal tax assessments. The third order denied George Snyder\u2019s motion to enjoin the Government from garnishing his Social Security checks for the purpose of satisfying his outstanding tax liability. For the reasons that follow, we will affirm the orders of the District Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b348-17\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b348-18\">George and Sharon Snyder are husband and wife and long-time residents of Pennsylvania. In the mid-1980\u2019s, the Snyders held proprietary interests in a variety of businesses, including motels, a glass factory, a farm, a mold-making operation, and a small resort. The Snyders filed their federal income tax return for 1988 in May 1990. They reported income from the sale of a property, revenues from their motels, and income from interest, among other things. As to deductions, the Snyder\u2019s claimed that they had lost almost two million dollars because of \u201cBusiness bad debt (\u2018Fires, Thefts, etc.\u2019).\u201d <footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b348-19\">In March 1992, the Government issued a notice of deficiency concerning the Snyder\u2019s 1988 tax return. Soon after, the Snyders attempted to amend their 1988 return, including an additional itemized deduction of over seventy-two million dollars for theft loss, the majority of which the Snyders attributed to allegedly stolen \u201cGlass molds, Equipment, Fixtures, Supplies, Etc.\u201d During proceedings before the United States Tax Court in 1995, the Snyders gave various explanations to substantiate the losses claimed on the 1988 return, including one that attributed the losses to theft from \u201ca $90 million cash hoard kept in a 30-by-30-foot, underground, fireproof, fortified room underneath the Blue Moon Motel that not even Mrs. Snyder knew about.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b348-20\">The Tax Court found the Snyders\u2019 explanations \u201cincredible\u201d and unsubstantiated, and sustained the Government\u2019s disallowance of certain losses, property taxes, self-employment taxes, and additions to tax that were claimed on the Snyders\u2019 original 1988 return. Pursuant to that decision, the Government assessed the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"325\">*325</page-number>Snyders a deficiency in federal individual income taxes for 1988, an accuracy penalty, a negligence penalty, and accumulated interest. In 2004, George Snyder was also assessed deficiencies for federal individual income taxes for the years 1991,1992, and 1993, as well as fraud penalties and interest.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Since the Snyders did not appeal from these decisions of the Tax Court, they became final. <em>See </em>26 U.S.C. \u00a7 7481(a)(1).</p>\n<p id=\"b349-5\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b349-6\">As of September 2005, the Snyders had not repaid their tax liabilities in full, and interest continued to accrue. So, in February 2006 the Government filed a complaint in the District Court for the Western District of Pennsylvania, the first four counts of which requested that the Snyders\u2019 tax assessments be reduced to judgment. The Snyders filed several counterclaims. In April 2007, the District Court granted the Government\u2019s unopposed motion for summary judgment, finding that \u201c[bjecause these liabilities have been fully adjudicated, they are <em>res judicata </em>and cannot be challenged.\u201d The District Court also dismissed the Snyders\u2019 counterclaims, characterizing them as \u201cquintessential example[s] of an insubstantial, implausible or otherwise completely-devoid-of-merit\u201d counterclaim.</p>\n<p id=\"b349-7\">The Snyders moved for reconsideration, which the District Court granted in part to allow them another opportunity to oppose the Government\u2019s motion for summary judgment. After the Snyders filed a brief and the Government filed its response, the</p>\n<p id=\"b349-10\">District Court reaffirmed its grant of summary judgment in favor of the Government. A judgment order was entered in June 2007, stating that the Snyders\u2019 joint indebtedness was $1,808,676.70, and that George Snyder\u2019s individual indebtedness was $3,033,741.68. The Snyders again moved for reconsideration, claiming that the Government\u2019s indebtedness calculations were incorrect and unsupported by reliable evidence. The District Court granted the motion in part to allow the Snyders to file objections to the indebtedness calculations, which they did.</p>\n<p id=\"b349-12\">In affirming its June 2007 judgment, the District Court noted that instead of providing legitimate reasons why the Government\u2019s indebtedness calculations were in error, the purported objections showed that George Snyder specifically \u201ccontinues to obfuscate, deny, distract, and disdain not only the legitimacy of the government\u2019s tax claims, but also the very judicial proceedings that are designed to protect him.\u201d Two weeks later, George Snyder individually filed a \u201cpetition to enjoin enforcement of judgment in violation of 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 407,\u201d claiming that the Government has been impermissibly garnishing his Social Security checks, which he alleges are his only source of income.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> The District Court denied the motion to enjoin, and the Snyders appealed from that order and the two judgment orders.</p>\n<p id=\"b349-13\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b349-14\">The Snyders have not submitted any argument on appeal, so we will analyze the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"326\">*326</page-number>only two questions fairly presented: 1) whether the District Court erred in adopting the Government\u2019s indebtedness calculations; and 2) whether the District Court erred in denying George Snyder\u2019s motion to enjoin the garnishment of his Social Security checks.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b350-4\">As to the first question, we affirm the judgment orders of the District Court because it correctly recognized the preclusive effect of the Tax Court\u2019s liability calculations on future claims by the Snyders concerning the extent of their tax liabilities. Barring certain exceptions not present in this case, \u201cif a claim of liability or non-liability relating to a particular tax year is litigated, a judgment on the merits is res judicata as to any subsequent proceeding involving the same claim and the same tax year.\u201d <em>Commissioner v. Sunnen, </em>333 U.S. 591, 598, 68 S.Ct. 715, 92 L.Ed. 898 (1948). <em>See also United States v. Bottenfield, </em>442 F.2d 1007, 1008 (3d Cir.1971).</p>\n<p id=\"b350-5\">As to the second question, we affirm the District Court\u2019s order disposing of George Snyder\u2019s motion to enjoin, but do so on the alternative basis that the District Court lacked jurisdiction over the motion under the Anti-Injunction Act. <em>See </em>26 U.S.C. \u00a7 7421(a); <em>Sherman v. Nash, </em>488 F.2d 1081, 1083 (3d Cir.1973) (\u201cunder 26 U.S.C. \u00a7 7421 and its predecessors, Congress has withheld from courts jurisdiction to enjoin the \u2018assessment or collection\u2019 of \u2018any tax\u2019 \u201d). There are exceptions to the Anti-Injunction Act\u2019s general proscription, <em>see Flynn v. United States ex rel. Eggers, </em>786 F.2d 586, 589 (3d Cir.1986), but they are inapplicable given the facts of this case.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b350-9\">There being no substantial question presented by this appeal, we will summarily affirm the orders of the District Court. <em>See </em>LAR 27.4; I.O.P. 10.6.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b348-14\">.
