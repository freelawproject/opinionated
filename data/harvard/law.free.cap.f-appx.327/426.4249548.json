The sole issue Okafor raises on appeal is whether the district court erred by denying his motion to withdraw his guilty plea.</p>\n<p id=\"b451-13\">We review the district court\u2019s denial of a motion to withdraw a guilty plea for abuse of discretion. <em>United States v. Ubalkanma, </em>215 F.3d 421, 424 (4th Cir.2000). \u201cA defendant has no absolute right to withdraw a guilty plea.\u201d <em>United States v. Bowman, </em>348 F.3d 408, 413 (4th Cir.2003) (internal citation and quotation marks omitted). Once the district court has accepted a defendant\u2019s guilty plea, it is within the court\u2019s discretion whether to grant a motion to withdraw it. <em>United States v. Battle, </em>499 F.3d 315, 319 (4th Cir.2007). The defendant bears the burden of showing a \u201cfair and just reason\u201d for withdrawing his guilty plea. Fed.R.Crim.P. 11(d)(2)(B); <em>Battle, </em>499 F.3d at 319. \u201c[A] \u2018fair and just\u2019 reason ... is one that essentially challenges ... the fairness of the Rule 11 proceeding.\u201d <em>United States v. Lambey, </em>974 F.2d 1389, 1394 (4th Cir. 1992).</p>\n<p id=\"b451-15\">In deciding whether to permit a defendant to withdraw his guilty plea, a district court considers:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b451-16\">(1) whether the defendant has offered credible evidence that his plea was not knowing or otherwise involuntary; (2) whether the defendant has credibly asserted his legal innocence; (3) whether there has been a delay between the entry of the plea and filing of the motion; (4) whether the defendant has had close assistance of counsel; (5) whether withdrawal will cause prejudice to the government; and (6) whether withdrawal will inconvenience the court and waste judicial resources.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b451-17\"><em>United States v. Moore, </em>931 F.2d 245, 248 (4th Cir.1991).</p>\n<p id=\"b451-18\">The record discloses that the district court\u2019s hearing held pursuant to Fed. R.Crim.P. 11 was extensive, as was the subsequent hearing on the motion to withdraw. Further, we afford Okafor\u2019s guilty plea a strong presumption of validity. We find no credible evidence of ineffectiveness of counsel, undue pressure, lack of competence, or actual innocence.</p>\n<p id=\"b451-19\">After reviewing the <em>Moore </em>factors and the district court\u2019s articulated reasons for <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"428\">*428</page-number>denying Okafor\u2019s motion to withdraw, we find no reversible error. Accordingly, we affirm. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b452-4\">\n<em>AFFIRMED.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
