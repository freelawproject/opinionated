The presentence report (\u201cPSR\u201d) recommended a sixteen-level increase to his base offense level pursuant to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2L1.2(b)(l)(A). The enhancement was predicated on Mr. De La Cruz-Madrigal having been previously deported subsequent to being convicted of attempted kidnapping and attempted sexual assault in Arizona. Mr. De La Cruz-Madrigal made two objections to the PSR. He objected to the sixteen-level enhancement, arguing that his prior convictions were not crimes of violence. He also objected to the \u201ccharacterization of the facts surrounding his prior felony offense in paragraph 20 of the presentence report.\u201d R., Vol. II, at 2 (PSR Addendum, dated Nov. 6, 2007). However, the PSR author found that Mr. De La Cruz-Madrigal\u2019s prior convictions were crimes of violence and that the characterization of the facts surrounding his prior convictions was accurate.</p>\n<p id=\"b102-6\">At sentencing, Mr. De La Cruz-Madrigal renewed both of his objections to the PSR. The district court determined that Mr. De La Cruz-Madrigal\u2019s prior convictions were crimes of violence and that paragraph 20 of the PSR was true and accurate. The district court judge also stated, \u201cIn [applying the crime of violence adjustment], I have not taken into account the statements of fact in paragraph 20 of the Presentence Report ... to influence my decision that the offenses identified in paragraph 20 are properly characterized as crimes of violence. I think the Arizona statutes [and the] guideline language justify that conclusion independent of the underlying facts.\u201d R., Vol. Ill, Tr. at 16 (Sentencing Tr., dated Jan. 3, 2008). The district court imposed a 46-month sentence, the bottom of the advisory Guidelines range. Mr. De La Cruz-Madrigal timely appealed.</p>\n<p id=\"b102-8\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b102-9\">Mr. De La Cruz-Madrigal contends on appeal that neither attempted kidnapping nor attempted sexual assault under Arizona law is a crime of violence. He argues that Arizona\u2019s kidnapping statute is significantly broader than the generic meaning of kidnapping and that Arizona\u2019s sexual assault statute does not contain an element of force. Section 2L1.2 only requires one prior crime of violence conviction to support the sixteen-level enhancement. <em>See </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2L1.2(b)(l)(A)(ii). Accordingly, we need only determine whether one of Mr. De La Cruz-Madrigal\u2019s prior convictions is a crime of violence. Because we find that attempted sexual assault under Arizona law is a crime of violence, we need not address attempted kidnapping.</p>\n<p id=\"b102-10\">The district court\u2019s interpretation of the Sentencing Guidelines is a legal question we review de novo. <em>United States v. Ruiz-Gea, </em>340 F.3d 1181, 1185 (10th Cir. 2003); <em>see United States v. Torres-Ruiz, </em>387 F.3d 1179, 1180-81 (10th Cir.2004). Section 2L1.2(b)(l)(A)(ii) of the Guidelines allows for a sixteen-level increase to a defendant\u2019s base level \u201cif the defendant previously was deported, or unlawfully remained in the United States, after a conviction for a felony that is ... a crime of violence.\u201d The Guidelines define a crime of violence as one of twelve enumerated offenses, including kidnapping and forcible sex offenses, or \u201cany offense under federal, state, or local law that has as an element the use, attempted use, or threatened use of physical force against the person of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"79\">*79</page-number>another.\u201d U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2L1.2 cmt. n. 1(B)(iii).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b103-5\">We treat this definition as disjunctive\u2014 enumerated offenses are categorically \u201ccrimes of violence,\u201d while unenumerated offenses must involve the \u201cuse of physical force.\u201d <em>See United States v. Munguia-Sanchez, </em>365 F.3d 877, 880-81 (10th Cir. 2004). \u201cWhen determining whether a pri- or conviction is a crime of violence, the Supreme Court has instructed sentencing courts to take \u2018a formal categorical approach, looking only to the statutory definitions of the prior offenses, and not to the particular facts underlying those convictions.\u2019 \u201d <em>United States v. Perez-Vargas, </em>414 F.3d 1282, 1284 (10th Cir.2005) (quoting <em>Taylor v. United States, </em>495 U.S. 575, 600, 110 S.Ct. 2143, 109 L.Ed.2d 607 (1990)); <em>see United States v. Ruiz-Rodriguez, </em>494 F.3d 1273, 1275 (10th Cir.2007). However, when a statute is ambiguous or broad enough to encompass both violent and nonviolent crimes, the sentencing court may undergo a modified categorical approach, looldng beyond the statute to certain records of the prior proceedings, such as \u201c \u2018the terms of the charging document, the terms of a plea agreement or transcript of colloquy between judge and defendant in which the factual basis for the plea was confirmed by the defendant, or to some comparable judicial record of this information.\u2019 \u201d <em>United States v. RomeroHernandez, </em>505 F.3d 1082, 1086 (10th Cir. 2007) (quoting <em>Shepard v. United States, </em>544 U.S. 13, 26, 125 S.Ct. 1254, 161 L.Ed.2d 205 (2005)); <em>see Perez-Vargas, </em>414 F.3d at 1284. \u201cThe court may also rely on any admissions the defendant has made regarding the facts of the prior conviction.\u201d Romero<em>-Hernandez, </em>505 F.3d at 1086; <em>Perez-Vargas, </em>414 F.3d at 1284-85.</p>\n<p id=\"b103-10\">Following the categorical approach, we look first to the language of the statute to determine whether Mr. De La Cruz-Madrigal was convicted of a crime of violence. Here, because we conclude that Arizona\u2019s sexual assault statute unambiguously prohibits only conduct that is categorically a crime of violence under \u00a7 2L1.2, our analysis ends with the language of the statute, and we need not proceed to apply the modified categorical approach.</p>\n<p id=\"b103-11\">Mr. De La Cruz-Madrigal pleaded guilty to attempted sexual assault,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> in violation of A.R.S. \u00a7\u00a7 13-1001, 1406. Arizona defines sexual assault as \u201cintentionally or knowingly engaging in sexual intercourse or oral sexual contact with any person <em>without consent </em>of such person.\u201d A.R.S. \u00a7 13-1406 (emphasis added). Mr. De La Cruz-Madrigal argues that this statute does not contain an element of force and, therefore, cannot be considered a \u201cforcible sexual offense.\u201d<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> However, Mr. De La Cruz-Madrigal cites no caselaw to support this conten<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"80\">*80</page-number>tion. Moreover, his argument directly conflicts with our holding in <em>RomeroHemandez, </em>where we held that \u201c[w]hen an offense involves sexual contact with another person, it is necessarily forcible when that person <em>does not consent.\u201d Romero-Hernandez, </em>505 F.3d at 1089 (emphasis added); <em>see also United States v. Yanez-Rodriguez, </em>555 F.3d 931, 945 (10th Cir.2009) (\u201c[B]ased on the precedent established in <em>Romero-Hernandez, </em>a conviction under a statute is a \u2018forcible sex offense\u2019 when the statute prohibits nonconsensual sexual contact with another person.\u201d). We reasoned that \u201cwhere one party has sufficient control of a situation to overcome the [sic] another\u2019s free will, force is present.\u201d <em>Romero-Hemandez, </em>505 F.3d at 1088. Here, Arizona\u2019s sexual assault statute under which Mr. De La Cruz-Madrigal was convicted only prohibits nonconsensual sexual contact. Therefore, it is properly considered a forcible sexual offense.</p>\n<p id=\"b104-4\">Accordingly, Mr. De La Cruz-Madrigal\u2019s prior conviction for attempted sexual assault under Arizona law is a crime of violence under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2L1.2(b)(l)(A)(ii). The district court consequently did not err in applying the sixteen-level enhancement.</p>\n<p id=\"b104-6\">CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b104-7\">For the foregoing reasons, we AFFIRM the district court\u2019s judgment.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b101-20\"> This Order and Judgment is not binding precedent, except under the doctrines of law of the case, res judicata, and collateral estoppel. It may be cited, however, for its persuasive value consistent with Fed. R.App. P. 32.1 and 10th Cir. R. 32.1.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b103-6\">. \u201cIn interpreting a guideline, we look at the language in the guideline itself, as well as the interpretative and explanatory commentary to the guideline provided by the Sentencing Commission.\u201d <em>United States v. Yanez-Rodriguez, 555 </em>F.3d 931, 944 n. 6 (10th Cir.2009) (internal quotation marks omitted).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b103-7\">. For purpose of \u00a7 2L1.2(b)(1)(A), a conviction for \"attempted\u201d sexual assault may qualify as the enumerated offense of sexual assault. <em>See </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2L1.2 cmt. n. 5; <em>cf. United States v. Gonzalez-Ramirez, </em>477 F.3d 310, 312 (5th Cir.2007) (\"[A] conviction for <em>attempted </em>'kidnapping' may qualify as the enumerated offense of kidnapping for purposes of section 2L1.2(b)(1)(A).\u201d). The commentary to \u00a7 2L1.2 states that \"[p]rior convictions of offenses counted under subsection (b)(1) include the offenses of aiding and abetting, conspiring, and <em>attempting, </em>to commit such offenses.\u201d U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2L1.2 cmt. n. 5 (emphasis added). Therefore, the analysis is not affected by Mr. De La Cruz-Madrigal having been convicted of attempted sexual assault rather than sexual assault. <em>See Gonzalez-Ramirez, All </em>F.3d at 312-13.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b103-13\">. Arizona's sexual assault statute would qualify as a \"crime of violence\u201d if it either has as \"an element the use, attempted use, or threatened use of physical force against the person <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"80\">*80</page-number>of another\u201d or if it constitutes an enumerated offense for purposes of \u00a7 2L1.2. U.S. S.G. \u00a7 2L1.2 cmt. n. l(B)(iii). The government does not argue that Arizona's sexual assault law could meet the \"use of physical force\u201d definition. Therefore, we only address whether Mr. De La Cruz-Madrigal's prior crime constitutes an enumerated offense for purposes of \u00a7 2L1.2, i.e., \"forcible sex offense.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
