He was principally sentenced to 78 months\u2019 imprisonment. On appeal, he argues that this sentence is both procedurally and substantively unreasonable. We assume the parties\u2019 familiarity with the facts and the scope of the issues, and affirm the sentence for substantially the reasons stated by the District Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b342-5\">Ferone\u2019s first argument is that the judicial factfinding made under a preponderance of the evidence standard as part of his sentencing procedure is unconstitutional. This argument is clearly foreclosed by existing precedent. <em>See United States v. Garcia, </em>413 F.3d 201, 220 n. 15 (2d Cir. 2005). Ferone\u2019s second argument is that the District Court lacked sufficient evidence upon which to impose a four-level enhancement pursuant to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2K2.1(b)(6). Having independently reviewed the factual record, particularly the testimony of the confidential informant and the evidence corroborating that testimony, we find that it was plainly sufficient to support the District Court\u2019s determination.</p>\n<p id=\"b342-7\">We have carefully considered all of Fer-one\u2019s claims, and find them to be meritless. Accordingly, we AFFIRM the decision of the District Court.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
