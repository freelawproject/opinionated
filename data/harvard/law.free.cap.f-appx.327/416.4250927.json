R. Civ. P. 12(h)(3) and denying their Fed. R. Civ. P. 59(e) motion seeking reconsideration of the dismissal order.<footnotemark>*</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b441-11\">The Barneses filed a civil action asserting claims under Maryland law arising out of a sale-leaseback transaction among the Barneses, plaintiff Burnett, and Defendants. The Barneses sought well over $75,000 in damages resulting from Defendants\u2019 alleged fraud and misrepresentation and claimed jurisdiction on the basis of diversity of citizenship, <em>see </em>28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1332 (2006). The complaint, however, failed to allege facts sufficient to establish complete diversity of citizenship between Plaintiffs and all Defendants. <em>See Axel Johnson, Inc. v. Carroll Carolina Oil Co., Inc., </em>145 F.3d 660, 663 (4th Cir.1998). Accordingly, the district court properly dismissed the action without prejudice for lack of jurisdiction.</p>\n<p id=\"b441-16\">With regard to the Barneses\u2019 Rule 59(e) motion, we find that the district court did not abuse its discretion in denying the motion. <em>See Pacific Ins. Co. v. American Nat\u2019l Fire Ins. Co., </em>148 F.3d 396, 402-03 (4th Cir.1998). Accordingly, we affirm the district court\u2019s orders. <em>Barnes, et al. v. Johnson, et al., </em>No. 8:08-cv-01056-RWT (D.Md. Nov. 25, 2008; Dec. 17, 2008). We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b441-17\">\n<em>AFFIRMED.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b441-12\"> Although the Barneses did not specify whether their \"motion for reconsideration\u201d was filed pursuant to Fed. R. Civ. P. 59(e) or 60(b), because it was filed within the ten-day limit for Rule 59(e) motions, it is treated as such. <em>See Dove v. CODESCO, </em>569 F.2d 807, 809 (4th Cir. 1978).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
