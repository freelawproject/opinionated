On appeal, Goin seeks to challenge the reasonableness of his sentence. The Government argues that Goin\u2019s appeal is barred by his waiver of the right to appeal included in the plea agreement. Upon review of the plea agreement and the transcript of the Fed. R. Crim. P. 11 hearing, we conclude that Goin knowingly and voluntarily waived his right to appeal his sentence, and that his challenge to the reasonableness of his sentence is within the scope of the waiver. <em>United States v. Blick, </em>408 F.3d 162, 168 (4th Cir.2005). Accordingly, we dismiss Goin\u2019s appeal. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately pi\u2019esented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b443-8\">\n<em>DISMISSED.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
