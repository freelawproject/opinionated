Because Huntley was found to be an armed career criminal under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924(e) (2006), he was sentenced to the statutory mandatory minimum of 180 months in prison. Huntley timely appealed.</p>\n<p id=\"b463-12\">Counsel for Huntley filed a brief in accordance with <em>Anders v. California, </em>386 U.S. 738, 87 S.Ct. 1396, 18 L.Ed.2d 493 (1967), certifying that there are no meritorious grounds for appeal but questioning whether the district court properly found that Huntley qualified as an armed career criminal. Finding no reversible error, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b463-13\">Huntley argues that the district court erred by finding that he was an armed career criminal under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924(e) and <em>U.S. Sentencing Guidelines Manual </em>\u00a7 4B1.4 (2007) because his qualifying convictions were consolidated for sentencing and arose from the same criminal episode. A defendant is an armed career criminal when he violates \u00a7 922(g)(1) and has three prior convictions for violent felonies or serious drug offenses. 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924(e)(1). Huntley\u2019s predicate convictions were charged separately, occurred on different dates in different locations, and involved different victims. <em>See United States v. Leeson, </em>453 F.3d 631, 640 (4th Cir.2006); <em>United States v. Thompson, </em>421 F.3d 278, 284-86 (4th Cir.2005) (explaining ACCA\u2019s requirement that prior convictions be \u201ccommitted on occasions different from one another\u201d). The fact that the offenses were consolidated for sentencing does not merge the offenses under the ACCA as \u201c[n]othing in \u00a7 924(e) or the Guidelines suggests that offenses must be tried or sentenced separately in order to be counted as separate predicate offenses.\u201d <em>United States v. Samuels, </em>970 F.2d 1312, 1315 (4th Cir.1992). We thus conclude that Huntley possesses the requisite number of predicate convictions required for an enhancement and his classification as an armed career criminal was accordingly proper.</p>\n<p id=\"b463-14\">In accordance with <em>Anders, </em>we have reviewed the record in this case and have found no meritorious issues for appeal. We therefore affirm the district court\u2019s judgment. We deny counsel\u2019s motion to withdraw. This court requires that counsel inform Huntley, in writing, of the right to petition the Supreme Court of the United States for further review. If Huntley requests that a petition be filed, but counsel believes that such a petition would be frivolous, then counsel may move in this <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"440\">*440</page-number>court for leave to withdraw from representation. Counsel\u2019s motion must state that a copy thereof was served on Huntley.</p>\n<p id=\"b464-4\">We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b464-5\">\n<em>AFFIRMED.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
