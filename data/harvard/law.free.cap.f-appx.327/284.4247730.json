Harris, </em>401 U.S. 37, 91 S.Ct. 746, 27 L.Ed.2d 669 (1971). We assume the parties\u2019 familiarity with the factual and procedural history of the case, as well as the issues on appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b309-17\">We review <em>de novo </em>a district court\u2019s determination that \u201cthe requirements for abstention [under <em>Younger </em>] have been met.\u201d <em>Diamond \u201cD\u201d Constr. Corp. v. McGowan, </em>282 F.3d 191, 197 (2d Cir.2002) (quoting <em>Schlagler v. Phillips, </em>166 F.3d 439, 441 (2d Cir.1999)). <em>\u201cYounger </em>abstention is required when three conditions are met: (1) there is an ongoing state proceeding; (2) an important state interest is implicated in that proceeding; and (3) the state proceeding affords the federal plaintiff an adequate opportunity for judicial review of the federal constitutional claims.\u201d <em>Diamond \u201cD\u201d Constr. Corp., </em>282 F.3d at 198. However, we have held that \u201capplication of the <em>Younger </em>doctrine is inappropriate where the litigant seeks money damages for an alleged violation of \u00a7 1983 ...\u201d <em>Rivers v. McLeod, </em>252 F.3d 99, 101-02 (2d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"286\">*286</page-number>Cir.2001) (citing <em>Kirschner v. Klemons, </em>225 F.3d 227, 238 (2d Cir.2000)).</p>\n<p id=\"b310-4\">Upon a review of the record, we conclude that insofar as plaintiff was seeking injunctive relief, the District Court properly found that the three <em>Younger </em>factors were met and accordingly properly abstained from exercising jurisdiction. However, we conclude that the District Court erred in abstaining from exercising jurisdiction over plaintiffs claims for monetary damages.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b310-5\">Accordingly, the judgment of the District Court is AFFIRMED with respect to plaintiffs claims seeking injunctive relief, but VACATED with respect to plaintiffs claims for monetary damages, and the cause is REMANDED to the District Court for further proceedings consistent with this order.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b310-16\">. We intimate no view on the merits of these claims.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
