He asserted that he has a medical condition that causes him to urinate frequently. The district court dismissed the suit as frivolous and for failure to state a claim because Clegg failed to assert an actual injury as a litigant that resulted from the policy. The court denied Clegg\u2019s motion for leave to proceed in forma pauperis (IFP) on appeal, certifying that the appeal was not taken in good faith. Clegg seeks this court\u2019s leave to proceed IFP.</p>\n<p id=\"b524-21\">Although Clegg asserts generally that his attempts to obtain post-conviction relief and an out-of-time appeal were adversely affected by the prison policy, he fails to assert any facts that demonstrate how he was injured as a litigant. Accordingly, he fails to show that he will raise a nonfrivolous issue on appeal. <em>See Lewis v. Casey, </em>518 U.S. 343, 351, 116 S.Ct. 2174, 135 L.Ed.2d 606 (1996). The motion is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"501\">*501</page-number>denied and the appeal is dismissed as frivolous. <em>See Baugh v. Taylor, </em>117 F.3d 197, 202 &amp; n. 24 (5th Cir.1997); 5th Cir. R. 42.2.</p>\n<p id=\"b525-5\">The district court\u2019s dismissal of Clegg\u2019s complaint and our dismissal of his appeal count as two strikes for purposes of 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(g). <em>See Adepegba v. Hammons, </em>103 F.3d 383, 387 (5th Cir.1996). Clegg is cautioned that once he accumulates three strikes, he may not proceed IFP in any civil action or appeal filed while he is incarcerated or detained in any facility unless he is under imminent danger of serious physical injury. <em>See </em>\u00a7 1915(g).</p>\n<p id=\"b525-6\">APPEAL DISMISSED; IFP MOTION DENIED; SANCTION WARNING ISSUED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b524-15\"> Pursuant to 5th Cm. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cm.
