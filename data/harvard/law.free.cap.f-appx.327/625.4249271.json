The district court sentenced him to 78 months\u2019 imprisonment. Smith appeals, arguing that the district court erred by enhancing his sentence under \u00a7 2K2.1(b)(6) of the Sentencing Guidelines, for using or possessing a firearm or ammunition in connection with another felony offense. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b650-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"626\">*626</page-number>I.</p>\n<p id=\"b650-4\">On April 18, 2005, according to reports from the Lansing, Michigan Police Department, officers pulled over a ear after hearing a loud crash followed by two gunshots. As the driver, Andrew Stewart, exited the vehicle, officers saw Smith\u2014who was sitting in the front passenger seat\u2014lean over toward the driver\u2019s seat. After arresting both Smith and Stewart, officers searched the car and found a loaded 9mm handgun under the driver\u2019s seat and a 9mm casing on the roadway.</p>\n<p id=\"b650-5\">A witness, Navene Button, approached police and told them she saw an argument between occupants of a van and a car matching the description of Smith\u2019s car. Button claimed that after the two vehicles drove a short distance, the front-seat passenger of the car got out, ran toward the van, and fired a shot at it. Her account corresponded with the place in the road where officers found the shell casing.</p>\n<p id=\"b650-6\">Stewart told police that while driving Smith\u2019s car he noticed a van following them and pulled over. He said Smith got out of the car and a Hispanic male got out of the van, and the latter began yelling at Smith and smashed the car window with his fist. Smith fired his gun several times toward the van and returned to the car, directing Stewart to drive. After going a short distance, Smith again jumped out of the car and shot at the van. Police stopped the car before they could drive away.</p>\n<p id=\"b650-7\">Smith\u2019s version of events differs in some key respects. He acknowledges firing the gun after the Hispanic driver broke his car window, but maintains that he fired only once and that he fired into the air\u2014not toward the van or any person.</p>\n<p id=\"b650-8\">Smith pleaded guilty to being a felon in possession of a firearm. The Presentence Investigation Report (\u201cPSR\u201d) recommended a four-level enhancement to his sentence pursuant to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2K2.1(b)(6), for using or possessing a firearm or ammunition in connection with another felony offense. The PSR stated that Smith \u201cfired the firearm at a second occupied vehicle according to several witnesses, including Mr. Stewart. This behavior reflects a felonious assault.\u201d Smith filed a formal objection to the enhancement, arguing that firing a gun into the air constitutes a misdemeanor offense of illegally discharging a firearm or a lesser offense, or an act of self-defense. The district court heard argument on Smith\u2019s objection and overruled it, imposing a sentence of 78 months. Smith timely appealed.</p>\n<p id=\"b650-10\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b650-11\">Smith contends that the district court erred by applying the sentencing enhancement for using or possessing a firearm or ammunition in connection with another felony offense, see U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2K2.1(b)(6), because the evidence was insufficient to support the district court\u2019s finding that he committed felonious assault. In our review, we \u201caccept[ ] the findings of fact of the district court unless they are clearly erroneous and shall \u2018give due deference to the district court\u2019s application of the guidelines to the facts.\u2019 \u201d <em>United States v. Richardson, </em>510 F.3d 622, 625 (6th Cir.2007) (quoting <em>United States v. Hill, </em>79 F.3d 1477, 1481 (6th Cir.1996)). \u201c[I]f the district court\u2019s account of the evidence is plausible in light of the record as a whole, the reviewing court may not reverse it even if the court is convinced that, had it been sitting as the trier of fact, it would have weighed the evidence differently.\u201d <em>United States v. Hopkins, </em>295 F.3d 549, 551 (6th Cir.2002).</p>\n<p id=\"b650-12\">Specifically, Smith disputes the district court\u2019s finding that he fired two shots <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"627\">*627</page-number>(rather than just one), and that he fired a shot at the van. First, he argues that Stewart\u2019s story is \u201cunworthy of belief.\u201d He points out that Stewart admitted to being a \u201ccrack head\u201d out looking for drugs the night of the arrest, and asserts that Stewart\u2019s account was a \u201cself-serving story aimed at keeping himself out of trouble.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b651-5\">The district court may consider hearsay evidence at sentencing so long as it \u201cbear[s] some minimal indicia of reliability.\u201d <em>United States v. Silverman, </em>976 F.2d 1502, 1512 (6th Cir.1992) (en banc) (quoting <em>United States v. Robinson, </em>898 F.2d, 1111, 1115 (6th Cir.1990)). If the defendant challenges the evidence, he \u201cmust establish that [it] is materially false or unreliable.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(quoting <em>Robinson, </em>898 F.2d at 1116) (emphasis omitted). Here, the district court considered Smith\u2019s objection to Stewart\u2019s statement, but found that reports from both the police and Button corroborated Stewart\u2019s story: the police heard two gunshots, with a delay in between, and Button said she saw the front-seat passenger leave his car and shoot at the van. <em>See United States v. Paull, </em>551 F.3d 516, 527 (6th Cir.2009) (finding hearsay evidence sufficiently reliable where other witnesses gave corroborating statements). Moreover, the district court did not base its sentencing decision on Stewart\u2019s report alone, but on the combined statements of Stewart, Button, and the Lansing police officers. <em>See Silverman, </em>976 F.2d at 1512 (noting that a defendant challenging evidence must establish that the \u201cunreliable information actually served as the basis for the sentence\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b651-6\">Next, Smith complains that the district court relied on -witness statements that were \u201cinternally inconsistent and there was no explanation as to why the version ultimately selected by the district court was relied upon.\u201d The police, Smith notes, reported hearing the second gunshot \u201cas they observed the vehicle turn,\u201d but did not mention seeing Smith get out of the car. Button said she saw Smith fire a shot at the van, but mentioned only one shot, not two. Stewart claimed that Smith fired multiple shots at the van and, finally, Smith himself stated that he fired only one shot, and that it was in the air\u2014not toward the van. The evidence, Smith argues, therefore insufficiently supports the finding that he committed felonious assault.</p>\n<p id=\"b651-8\">Smith\u2019s contention cannot withstand this court\u2019s clear-error review. The police said they heard two shots, Button described Smith exiting the car and shooting at the van, and Stewart reported at least two shots\u2014with a delay in between\u2014and Smith firing at the van. Police found an expended shell casing at the intersection where Button claimed to have seen a man shoot at a van. The district judge explained his conclusion as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b651-9\">And I think what clinches the evidentiary analysis for this Court is the second shot. The first one [is] perhaps arguable, but when Mr. Stewart is starting to drive away with Mr. Smith, Mr. Smith, according to Mr. Stewart, orders the car stopped, he gets out and fires again, which I believe is coincident with Paragraph 12 [of the PSR] in the independent witness\u2019s description. I think at that point Mr. Smith has committed a felonious assault.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b651-10\">Smith protests that the shot Button observed could not have been the second shot, because the police officers who heard the second shot did not report seeing Smith exit the ear. The PSR, however, does not elucidate what the police officers saw, stating only that \u201cas [the officers] observed the vehicle turn, they heard a second gunshot.\u201d The car may have turned out of the officers\u2019 sight before they heard the second shot, or they may have <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"628\">*628</page-number>otherwise failed to see Smith leave his car. Both Stewart and Button reported seeing Smith fire his gun at the van; thus, the district court did not clearly err in so finding.</p>\n<p id=\"b652-4\">Smith also argues that there was no evidence that any person occupied the van when he allegedly fired the second shot, but he is mistaken. Button stated that Smith jumped out of his car \u201cwhen the van returned\u201d and shot at it\u2014implying that at least a driver occupied the van. Stewart reported that a woman occupied the passenger seat of the van throughout the entire encounter.</p>\n<p id=\"b652-5\">Finally, Smith claims in his reply brief that U.S.S.G. \u00a7 1B1.3\u2014which permits a district court to consider a broad range of conduct in applying sentencing enhancements\u2014is unconstitutional. By failing to raise this argument in his opening brief, Smith has forfeited it. <em>See Golden v. Comm\u2019r, </em>548 F.3d 487, 493 (6th Cir.2008). But even were this court to address the issue, it is meritless: district courts may consider relevant conduct. <em>See, e.g., Silverman, </em>976 F.2d at 1512-13.</p>\n<p id=\"b652-6\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b652-7\">Because the district court did not err by enhancing Smith\u2019s sentence, we affirm.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
