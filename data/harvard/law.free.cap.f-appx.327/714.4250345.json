Ill, by virtue of California Civil Code section 43.1, was a person at the time of the accident and the infliction of the injury. But was he a family member resident in his father\u2019s household? If he was, he was insured. By virtue of the exclusion his coverage did not extend to injury caused by his father. We interpret the policy consistently. If R.L.H. Ill had coverage, he was excluded from coverage for injury inflicted by a family member.</p>\n<p id=\"b739-6\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b738-29\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9th Cir.
