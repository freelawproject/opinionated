The district court granted Tensley\u2019s motion for a certificate of appealability (\u201cCOA\u201d) for the following issue: Whether Tensley \u201cmade a substantial showing of the denial of a constitutional right, specifically the Sixth Amendment right to effective assistance of counsel.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b861-22\">In a \u00a7 2255 proceeding, we review a district court\u2019s legal conclusions <em>de novo </em>and factual findings for clear error. <em>Lynn v. United States, </em>365 F.3d 1225, 1232 (11th Cir.2004). A claim of ineffective assistance of counsel is a mixed question of law and fact that we review <em>de novo. Caderno v. United States, </em>256 F.3d 1213, 1216-17 (11th Cir.2001). We allot \u201csubstantial deference to the factfinder .... in reaching credibility determinations with respect to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"838\">*838</page-number>witness testimony.\u201d <em>United States v. McPhee, </em>336 F.3d 1269, 1275 (11th Cir. 2003) (quotation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b862-4\">In <em>Roe v. Flores-Ortega, </em>528 U.S. 470, 120 S.Ct. 1029, 145 L.Ed.2d 985 (2000), the Supreme Court held that <em>Strickland v. Washington, </em>466 U.S. 668, 104 S.Ct. 2052, 80 L.Ed.2d 674 (1984), applies when determining whether counsel was ineffective for failing to file a notice of appeal. <em>Flores-Ortega, </em>528 U.S. at 477, 120 S.Ct. 1029. \u201c[WJhere a defendant has not specifically instructed his attorney to file an appeal, we must still determine \u2018whether counsel in fact consulted with the defendant about an appeal.\u2019 \u201d <em>Thompson v. United States, </em>504 F.3d 1203, 1206 (11th Cir.2007) (quoting <em>Flores-Ortega, </em>528 U.S. at 478, 120 S.Ct. 1029). The Supreme Court held that \u201ccounsel has a constitutionally imposed duty to consult with the defendant about an appeal when there is reason to think either (1) that a rational defendant would want to appeal (for example, because there are nonfrivolous grounds for appeal), or (2) that this particular defendant reasonably demonstrated to counsel that he was interested in appealing.\u201d <em>Flores-Ortega, </em>528 U.S. at 480, 120 S.Ct. 1029. The Supreme Court defined the term \u201cconsult\u201d specifically to mean \u201cadvising the defendant about the advantages and disadvantages of taking an appeal, and making a reasonable effort to discover the defendant\u2019s wishes.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 478, 120 S.Ct. 1029. Such a consultation assures that any waiver of the right to appeal is knowing and voluntary. <em>Thompson, </em>504 F.3d at 1206.</p>\n<p id=\"b862-5\">Upon review of the record and the parties\u2019 briefs, we discern no reversible error here. The magistrate judge made a detei'mination based on testimony in the evidentiary hearing that Tensley lacked credibility, and found that Tensley\u2019s testimony that he told his lawyer to file an appeal was in direct conflict with his lawyer\u2019s testimony that he had advised Tensley of his right to file an appeal, yet Tensley did not wish to. His lawyer produced letters to Tensley supporting his contentions, and testified that he had discussed the right to appeal with Tensley on three separate occasions and each time Tensley showed no interest in appealing his sentence. On this record, we cannot say the district court\u2019s finding that Tensley\u2019s lawyer indisputably consulted with Tensley was clearly erroneous. Accordingly, we affirm the district court\u2019s denial of Tensley\u2019s \u00a7 2255 motion to vacate.</p>\n<p id=\"b862-7\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
