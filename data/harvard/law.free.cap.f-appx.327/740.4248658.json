Delaware, </em>438 U.S. 154, 98 S.Ct. 2674, 57 L.Ed.2d 667 (1978). Martin has not identified any false statements or <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"742\">*742</page-number>omissions in the affidavit that were made with \u201creckless disregard for the truth.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 155-56, 98 S.Ct. 2674.</p>\n<p id=\"b766-4\">Martin claims that the affidavit falsely misrepresented that IRC channels are like websites or emails and that agents have found child pornography \u201con these channels.\u201d However, the affidavit describes IRC channels in detail, referring to them as \u201cchat rooms,\u201d not as websites or emails, and then specifically explains how pornography is exchanged \u201con\u201d such channels. In the context of the affidavit, therefore, the phrase \u201con these channels\u201d was not misleading.</p>\n<p id=\"b766-5\">Similarly, Martin claims that the affidavit misrepresented that the channels accessed by \u201cZarman\u201d were \u201cknown pornography channels\u201d because IRCs cannot be \u201cknown\u201d for anything. The affidavit, however, explains how these channels were \u201cknown\u201d for pornography, indicating that agents had conducted investigations in which individuals had downloaded pornography from these channels. This statement was therefore also not misleading.</p>\n<p id=\"b766-6\">Martin does point to one statement in which the affidavit may have been misleading. In paragraph 31, the affidavit makes no distinction between the \u201cZarman\u201d who logged into \u201c# rOundtable\u201d and the \u201cZarman\u201d who logged into the other IRC channels later. This could be read to mean that these were the same \u201cZarman,\u201d which Martin\u2019s expert\u2019s affidavit shows was not necessarily the case. However, Martin offers no proof anywhere that this potentially misleading statement was made recklessly. Without any such proof, this one statement did not warrant a <em>Franks </em>hearing.</p>\n<p id=\"b766-7\">We also affirm the district court\u2019s denial of Martin\u2019s first motion to suppress the search warrant for lack of probable cause. All that is required for probable cause is a \u201cfair probability\u201d under the \u201cto-</p>\n<p id=\"b766-8\">tality of the circumstance,\u201d including \u201cfair inferences,\u201d that evidence or fruits of a crime will be found at the place searched. <em>United States v. Gourde, </em>440 F.3d 1065, 1070 (9th Cir.2006) (en banc) (quoting <em>Illinois v. Gates, </em>462 U.S. 213, 103 S.Ct. 2317, 76 L.Ed.2d 527 (1983)). In <em>United States v. Kelley, </em>482 F.3d 1047 (9th Cir.2007), we held that, to support a finding of probable cause, an affidavit need not contain direct evidence of volitional actions to seek out actual child pornography when reasonable inferences can be made from the facts in the affidavit that the defendant possessed child pornography. In Martin\u2019s ease, it was reasonable to infer that Martin was the individual who visited several different internet relay chat (\u201cIRC\u201d) channels within a short time period that were all known to Customs Service agents to be used for exchanging child pornography, and there was a \u201cfair probability\u201d that such an individual would possess child pornography on his home computer. Therefore, the search warrant was valid.</p>\n<p id=\"b766-9\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b765-12\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9th Cir.
