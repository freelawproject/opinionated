This court has jurisdiction pursuant to 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(b). We deny the petition.</p>\n<p id=\"b755-9\">Azabo failed to meet his burden of establishing his eligibility for asylum, withholding of removal, and CAT relief through credible evidence. <em>See Singh-Kaur v. INS, </em>183 F.3d 1147, 1149 (9th Cir.1999); <em>Kamalthas v. INS, </em>251 F.3d 1279, 1282 (9th Cir.2001). Substantial evidence supports the IJ\u2019s adverse credibility finding, including multiple inconsistencies regarding the 1987-89 Ba\u2019ath recruitment, how dangerous Iraq was and is, and whether there were outstanding formal charges that could be enforced, as well as his general unresponsiveness and \u201cwhimsical\u201d demeanor. These bases were specific and tied to significant aspects of his case. <em>See Arulampalam v. Ashcroft, </em>353 F.3d 679, 686-87 (9th Cir.2003); <em>Gui v. INS, </em>280 F.3d 1217, 1225 (9th Cir.2002); <em>Chebchoub v. INS, </em>257 F.3d 1038, 1043 (9th Cir.2001). Azabo\u2019s brief provides little to no argument otherwise.</p>\n<p id=\"b755-13\">Because the IJ found him not credible, Azabo could not establish through oral testimony the changed circumstances necessary to circumvent the statutory bar to his asylum claim. <em>See </em>8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1158(a)(2)(C), (D). That adverse credibility finding also prevented him from meeting the higher withholding of removal standard. <em>See Farah v. Ashcroft, </em>348 F.3d 1153, 1156 (9th Cir.2003).</p>\n<p id=\"b755-14\">Azabo\u2019s CAT relief claim was properly denied both because he was not credible and because the objective evidence in the administrative record as to post-Saddam-era Iraq\u2014all from the Government\u2014 showed no clear probability he would be tortured if he returned to Iraq. <em>See Kamalthas v. INS, </em>251 F.3d 1279, 1284, 1282 (9th Cir.2001).</p>\n<p id=\"b755-15\">Because Azabo never met his burden to establish past persecution, he was not entitled to asylum based on the likelihood of \u201cother serious harm,\u201d <em>see </em>8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1208.13(b)(l)(iii)(B), even assuming he articulated such a harm.</p>\n<p id=\"b755-16\">Petition DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b755-10\"><em> </em>This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9 th Cir. R. 36-3.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b755-11\">. Despite several requests by the IJ, Azabo never actually presented any documents verifying his identity as an Iraqi citizen. The IJ mentioned, but did not rely on, Azabo\u2019s failure to establish his identity in his decision.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
