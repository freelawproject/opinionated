We have jurisdiction pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291, and we reverse and remand.</p>\n<p id=\"b741-17\">Because the parties are familiar with the facts and procedural history of the case, we need not repeat them here. Lima is entitled to statutory tolling of the one-year statute of limitations while his state habeas petitions were pending before the California Superior Court (March 21, 2005-May 13, 2005) and the California Supreme Court (November 22, 2005-August 23, 2006). In addition, Lima is entitled to statutory tolling for the period between these two petitions, because his state petitions were pending during this period. <em>See Carey v. Saffold, </em>536 U.S. 214, 222-23, 122 S.Ct. 2134, 153 L.Ed.2d 260 (2002).</p>\n<p id=\"b741-18\">California\u2019s unique system of collateral review (a petitioner files a new \u201coriginal\u201d petition in a higher court) means that a subsequent habeas petition in a higher state court is \u201cpending\u201d if it is part of the same \u201cone full round\u201d of review. <em>Id. </em>at 221-22, 122 S.Ct. 2134; <em>see also King v. Roe, </em>340 F.3d 821, 823 (9th Cir.2003) (per <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"718\">*718</page-number>curiam). Lima\u2019s state petitions were part of the same full round of review because they alleged the same grounds of relief, and because the second petition was an attempt to \u201ccorrect the deficiencies\u201d of the first petition, <em>id., </em>and \u201c \u2018achieve final resolution through the State\u2019s post-conviction procedures,\u2019 \u201d <em>id. </em>(quoting <em>Saffold, </em>536 U.S. at 220,122 S.Ct. 2134).</p>\n<p id=\"b742-4\">Moreover, we find that Lima\u2019s second petition to the California Supreme Court was filed within a \u201creasonable time.\u201d <em>See Evans v. Chavis, </em>546 U.S. 189, 198, 126 S.Ct. 846, 163 L.Ed.2d 684 (2006) (holding that if the state supreme court\u2019s disposition does not state whether the petition was timely or untimely, the federal court of appeals must make that determination itself). There was a six month delay between Lima\u2019s state petitions, but three and one half of these months are justified or explained by his lack of access to his legal files while he was in administrative segregation. <em>See id. </em>at 201, 126 S.Ct. 846. We hold that the remaining two and one half months is a reasonable time to prepare and file a habeas petition.</p>\n<p id=\"b742-5\">Accordingly, Lima is entitled to statutory tolling sufficient to render the instant federal petition filed within the one-year statute of limitations. Thus, we remand to the district court to proceed with Lima\u2019s petition on the merits. We leave to the district court the question whether any of Lima\u2019s claims are procedurally defaulted under <em>In re Dixon, </em>41 Cal.2d 756, 264 P.2d 513 (1953).</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b741-11\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9th Cir. R. 36-3.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b742-7\">GOULD, Circuit Judge,</author>\n<p id=\"A5U\">dissenting:</p>\n<p id=\"b742-8\">I believe that it is incorrect to view Lima\u2019s two state habeas petitions as part of \u201cone full round\u201d of state review, in light of the intervening federal habeas corpus petition filing and the dismissal for exhaustion. Lima did not argue on appeal to us that his state petitions were part of one round, and I would not take that position <em>sua sponte. </em>If, as I believe, the gap between Lima\u2019s state filings is not tolled by statute, then timeliness turns on the issue of equitable tolling. As I see that issue, Lima showed insufficient diligence for equitable tolling. Accordingly, I respectfully dissent.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
