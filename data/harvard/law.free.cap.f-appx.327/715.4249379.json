We have jurisdiction under 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252, and we deny the petition.</p>\n<p id=\"b740-7\">As the IJ found that Kumar had suffered past persecution, Kumar was entitled to a rebuttable presumption of a well-founded fear of future persecution. 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1208.13(b)(1); <em>Ladha v. INS, </em>215 F.3d 889, 897 (9th Cir.2000). However, the Board affirmed the IJ\u2019s conclusion that the Government had rebutted this presumption by a preponderance of the evidence. Specifically, the IJ found, and the BIA affirmed, that Kumar could avoid future persecution by relocating within India, and that such relocation was reasonable. <em>See </em>8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1208.13(b)(l)(i)(B). We find that substantial evidence supports these findings.</p>\n<p id=\"b740-8\">Because Kumar failed to satisfy the lower standard of proof for asylum, it necessarily follows that he failed to satisfy the more stringent standard for withholding of removal. <em>See Fisher v. INS, </em>79 F.3d 955, 960-61 (9th Cir.1996) (en banc). Moreover, we find that substantial evidence supports the Board\u2019s rejection of Kumar\u2019s claim that the past persecution he endured was so severe that returning him to India would be inhumane. <em>See, e.g., Vongsakdy v. INS, </em>171 F.3d 1203, 1205 (9th Cir.1999). Finally, as Kumar has not shown that it is more likely than not that he will be arrested and tortured upon his return to India, his argument for relief under the Convention Against Torture fails. <em>See Nuru v. Gonzales, </em>404 F.3d 1207, 1221 (9th Cir. 2005); <em>Lemus-Galvan v. Mukasey, </em>518 F.3d 1081, 1084 (9th Cir.2008).</p>\n<p id=\"b740-10\">PETITION DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b740-22\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9th Circuit Rule 36-3.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
