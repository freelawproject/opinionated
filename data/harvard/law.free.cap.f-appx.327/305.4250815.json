HALL, Circuit Judges.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<p id=\"b330-11\">SUMMARY ORDER</p>\n<p id=\"b330-12\">Defendant-appellant Enrique Simmons, who in 1998 was sentenced principally to 322 months\u2019 imprisonment for conspiracy to distribute 50 grams or more of \u201ccrack\u201d cocaine in violation of 21 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 846 and 841(b)(1)(A), challenges an August 5, 2008, 2008 WL 3178729 order of the District Court denying his motion for a reduced sentence under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582(c)(2) in light of the United States Sentencing Commission\u2019s amendment of the United States Sentencing Guidelines to lower offense levels for crack cocaine offenses.</p>\n<p id=\"b330-13\">On appeal, Simmons argues that he was denied due process of law because his counsel did not receive a July 2, 2008 memorandum from the United States Probation Office (\u201cUSPO\u201d) supplementing Simmons\u2019s original presentence report (\u201cPSR\u201d) and the District Court did not conduct a hearing or otherwise provide him with an opportunity to respond to the information contained in the supplemental letter.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Additionally, Simmons posits that the District Court erred in failing to comply with the procedural requirements of Rule 32 of the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure; the District Court insufficiently explained its rationale for denying Simmons\u2019s motion; and the District Court abused its discretion in taking into consideration defendant\u2019s post-sentencing conduct and leaving in place a sentence that was within the adjusted Guidelines range. We assume the parties\u2019 familiarity with the facts and procedural history of the case.</p>\n<p id=\"b330-14\">Simmons\u2019s due process claim is unavailing. In particular, his reliance on <em>Gardner v. Florida, </em>in which the Supreme Court <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"307\">*307</page-number>held that a defendant in a capital murder case was \u201cdenied due process of law when the death sentence was imposed, at least in part, on the basis of information which he had no opportunity to deny or explain,\u201d 430 U.S. 349, 362, 97 S.Ct. 1197, 51 L.Ed.2d 393 (1977) is misplaced. Notwithstanding Simmons\u2019s contentions in this case, we have observed that \u201cthere can be no doubt that [Gardner\u2019s] holding is strictly limited to \u25a0 due process guarantees in <em>Capital cases.\u201d United States v. Fatico, </em>579 F.2d 707, 711 n. 10 (2d Cir.1978) (emphasis added). However, even if we assume, as Simmons does, that the rule in <em>Gardner </em>applies in non-capital cases and applies to motions for reduced sentences under \u00a7 3582(c)(2), it at most stands for the proposition that \u201ca defendant cannot be sentenced ... based on <em>secret information </em>in a presentence investigation report which he cannot dispute or explain because it is <em>not disclosed to him.\u201d Id. </em>(emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b331-5\">The Government contends that \u201cwhatever [d]ue [pjrocess right Simmons had to review and respond to the [USPO\u2019s July 2, 2008 supplemental memorandum containing] information about his prison disciplinary record was satisfied by the Government\u2019s detailed presentation of the [same] information in its [July 24, 2008] letter ... opposing Simmons\u2019[s] motion for resentencing.\u201d Appellee\u2019s Br. 15. We agree. As the Government correctly observes, although Simmons\u2019s counsel did not receive a copy of the USPO\u2019s supplemental memorandum, Simmons\u2019s counsel <em>did </em>receive a copy of the Government\u2019s July 24, 2008 letter to the District Court opposing a reduction in sentence. Our review of the record reveals that the Government\u2019s letter adverted to the USPO\u2019s supplemented memorandum and catalogued Simmons\u2019s post-sentence prison disciplinary record in greater detail than the USPO\u2019s supplemental memorandum. Accordingly, we are confident that Simmons received ample notice of the <em>contents </em>of the USPO\u2019s supplemental memorandum.</p>\n<p id=\"b331-7\">Simmons argues that he was entitled to a hearing or some further opportunity to explain the circumstances underlying many of the infractions listed in the Government\u2019s July 24, 2008 letter and the USPO\u2019s supplemental memorandum. Simmons does not dispute that the information on which the District Court relied accurately listed disciplinary infractions in his record. He simply argues that he should have been permitted to explain certain aspects of that record. We note, however, that the District Court had before it both the USPO\u2019s supplemental memorandum, which reported that Simmons had obtained a GED, was working as an orderly, and had participated in numerous classes and workshops, as well as Simmons\u2019s May 8, 2008 motion for a reduced sentence. In the memorandum supporting Simmons\u2019s motion, his counsel provided a thorough and detailed account of Simmons\u2019s various accomplishments in prison and his \u201cdiligent[ ]\u201d efforts to \u201c \u2018better\u2019 him-self.\u201d J.A. 11. Attached to Simmons\u2019s motion were a lengthy transcript of educational programs Simmons had attended and a progress report from a Bureau of Prisons Correctional Counselor familiar with Simmons\u2019s prison record. In the circumstances presented here, we are satisfied that the District Court did not impair or violate his due process rights.</p>\n<p id=\"b331-8\">We have considered Simmons\u2019s other arguments and find them to be without merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b331-9\">CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b331-10\">For reasons stated above, the August 5, 2008, 2008 WL 3178729 order of the District Court is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b330-10\">. The Guidelines authorize a court entertaining a motion under \u00a7 3582(c)(2) to \"consider,\u201d among other things, \u201cthe post-sentencing conduct of the defendant that occurred after imposition of the original term of imprisonment.\u201d U.S.S.G. \u00a7 1B1.10 comment (n.l(B)(iii)).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
