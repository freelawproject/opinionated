INS, </em>224 F.3d 1147, 1150 (9th Cir.2000). We review factual determinations for substantial evidence. <em>Id. </em>(\u201cUnder the substantial evidence standard of review, the court of appeals must affirm when it is possible to draw two inconsistent conclusions from the evidence.\u201d) (citing <em>Lambert v. Ackerley, </em>180 F.3d 997, 1012 (9th Cir.1999) (en banc)). For us to disturb the BIA\u2019s decision, petitioner must show \u201cthe evidence not only <em>supports ... </em>but <em>compels </em>\u201d reversal. <em>INS v. Elias-Zacarias, </em>502 U.S. 478, 481 n. 1, 112 S.Ct. 812, 117 L.Ed.2d 38 (1992).</p>\n<p id=\"b51-5\">An alien seeking withholding of removal must establish a clear probability of persecution\u2014namely that it is more likely than not that his \u201clife or freedom would be threatened\u201d\u2014on account of his race, religion, nationality, membership in a particular social group, or political opinion if he returned to his home country. 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1231(b)(3)(A); 8 C.F.R. 1208.16(b); <em>Lim v. INS, </em>224 F.3d 929, 937-38 (9th Cir.2000) (citing <em>INS v. Stevic, </em>467 U.S. 407, 424, 430, 104 S.Ct. 2489, 81 L.Ed.2d 321 (1984)); <em>Duarte de Guinac v. INS, </em>179 F.3d 1156, 1159 (9th Cir.1999).</p>\n<p id=\"b51-6\">Because Wu converted to IKuan Tao after he arrived in the United States, he did not suffer past persecution in China on account of his religion. Wu could still qualify for withholding of removal if he showed that it is more likely than not that his life or freedom would be threatened on account of his conversion to I-Kuan Tao. Wu failed to do so, even accepting that he is credible. <em>See Prasad v. INS, </em>101 F.3d 614, 616 (9th Cir.1996). Wu\u2019s showing before this court, including the translation of <em>Qiao Bao News\u2019 </em>March 15, 2002 article entitled \u201cTianjin Suppressed I-Kuan Tao (first part),\u201d does not compel a determination that he is likely to be persecuted if returned to China.</p>\n<p id=\"b51-10\">PETITION FOR REVIEW DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b50-18\"><em> </em>This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9th Cir.
