On appeal, Richardson argues that this Court\u2019s decision in <em>United States v. Williams, </em>549 F.3d 1337 (11th Cir.2008) (per curiam), was wrongly decided and maintains that Amendment 706 lowered his guideline range despite the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"195\">*195</page-number>fact that his original sentence was based upon the application of a statutory mandatory minimum sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b219-5\">\u201cWe review a district court\u2019s decision whether to reduce a sentence pursuant to 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582(c)(2), based on a subsequent change in the sentencing guidelines, for abuse of discretion.\u201d <em>Williams, </em>549 F.3d at 1338 (quoting <em>United States v. Brown, </em>332 F.3d 1341, 1343 (11th Cir. 2003)). \u201cHowever, where the issue presented involves a legal interpretation, our review is <em>de novo.\u201d Id. </em>at 1338-39 (citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b219-6\">A district court may modify a term of imprisonment in the case of a defendant who was sentenced to a term of imprisonment based on a sentencing range that has been lowered subsequently by the Sentencing Commission. 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582(c)(2). However, we have held that when a defendant is subject to a statutory mandatory minimum that replaces his guideline range, that defendant is ineligible for a sentence reduction under Amendment 706. <em>Williams, </em>549 F.3d at 1342 (\u201cBecause Williams was subject to a statutory mandatory minimum that replaced his original sentencing guideline range, he was not sentenced according to the base offense level in \u00a7 2D1.1, even taking into account the \u00a7 5K1.1 downward departure. He thus would not fall within the scope of Amendment 706.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b219-7\">Upon review of the record and the parties\u2019 briefs, we discern no error. Richardson\u2019s sentence was not based on the drug quantity tables set forth in \u00a7 2D1.1 of the Sentencing Guidelines, but was the result of the application of the statutorily required minimum sentence under 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 841(b)(1)(A), which prescribes a term of life imprisonment for a defendant with two prior felony drug convictions. Because Richardson\u2019s sentence was based upon the applicable statutory mandatory minimum of life imprisonment rather than his original guideline range, he was ineligible for a reduction under \u00a7 3582(c)(2) based upon Amendment 706. Further, his argument that <em>Williams </em>was wrongly decided and is inapplicable is without merit, as <em>Williams </em>is binding precedent and has not been overturned. <em>See United States v. Hogan, </em>986 F.2d 1364, 1369 (11th Cir.1993) (holding that prior panel decisions are binding on subsequent panels unless overturned by an intervening decision of the Supreme Court or the Eleventh Circuit sitting <em>en </em>banc). Therefore, Richardson was ineligible for a \u00a7 3582(c)(2) sentence reduction, and we affirm the district court\u2019s denial of his \u00a7 3582(c)(2) motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b219-9\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
