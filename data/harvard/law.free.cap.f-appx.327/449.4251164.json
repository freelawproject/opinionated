At the sentencing hearing, the district court overruled Walker\u2019s objections to the following enhancements: (1) the tax loss amount of over $400,000, under <em>U.S. Sentencing Guidelines Manual </em>(\u201cUSSG\u201d) \u00a7\u00a7 2T1.1(a)(1), 2T4.1(H) (2006), resulting in a base offense level of 20; (2) a two-level increase for failing to report more than $10,000 of income from an illegal source, under USSG \u00a7 2T1.1(b)(1); and (3) a two-level increase for abusing a position of trust, under USSG \u00a7 3C1.1. Walker\u2019s resulting total offense level was twenty-four, which, with a criminal history category of I, resulted in a sentencing range of 51-63 months of incarceration. The court imposed a sentence of sixty-three months of incarceration: sixty-three months each for Counts 1-3, and sixty months each for Counts 4-9. All sentences were imposed to run concurrently.</p>\n<p id=\"b474-7\">On appeal, Walker again contests the above three sentencing enhancements. We review Walker\u2019s sentence under a deferential abuse-of-discretion standard. <em>Gall v. United States, </em>552 U.S. 38, -, 128 S.Ct. 586, 590, 169 L.Ed.2d 445 (2007). We find Walker has alleged no procedural or substantive error in the district court\u2019s sentence. <em>Id. </em>at 597; <em>United States v. Pauley, </em>511 F.3d 468, 473-74 (4th Cir. 2007). Moreover, we find no clear error in the district court\u2019s factual findings that the enhancements were supported by a preponderance of the evidence presented at the sentencing hearing. <em>United States v. Allen, </em>446 F.3d 522, 527 (4th Cir.2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b474-11\">Accordingly, we affirm Walker\u2019s sentence. We dispense with oral argument as the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b474-12\">\n<em>AFFIRMED.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
