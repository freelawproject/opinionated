On appeal, Southern argues that the decision to run his sentence consecutively to the state sentence he was then serving was unreasonable and constituted an abuse of discretion. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b418-10\">Under <em>U.S. Sentencing Guidelines Manual </em>\u00a7 5G1.3(c) (2007), the district court possessed the discretion to run the imposed sentence concurrently, partially concurrently, or consecutively to Southern\u2019s prior undischarged term of imprisonment. In choosing to run the sentence consecutively, the court considered the undisputed advisory Guidelines range of 180-210 months in prison, the 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553 (2006) sentencing factors, the fact that Southern\u2019s undischarged state sentence was the result of a \u201cseries\u201d of probation violations, the fact that the state and federal sentences were not related, and Southern\u2019s \u201cextensive criminal history.\u201d In fact, the court noted that there was a significant argument to be made that an appropriate sentence would require an upward departure from the Guidelines, but the court declined to so depart, given Southern\u2019s cooperation, age, and the fact that his sentence would be run consecutively. We find no abuse <em>of </em>discretion and hold that the decision to run Southern\u2019s sentence consecutively to his undischarged state sentence was reasonable.</p>\n<p id=\"b418-12\">Accordingly, we affirm. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b418-13\">\n<em>AFFIRMED.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
