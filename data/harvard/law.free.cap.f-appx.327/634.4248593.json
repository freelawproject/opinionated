After observing what he believed were health and safety violations at the facility, Beaver contacted the local fire department and the Wisconsin Department of Health and Family Services. Shortly thereafter the owners revoked his visitation rights. Beaver then filed this lawsuit, alleging that the defendants\u2019 decision constituted retaliation under the Americans with Disabilities Act. <em>See </em>42 U.S.C. \u00a7 12203.</p>\n<p id=\"b659-7\">The district court granted summary judgment for the defendants, finding that Beaver had not engaged in any activity protected by the ADA. The court also raised the prospect that he would be sanctioned with fines: it noted that many of Beaver\u2019s claims were \u201ccompletely baseless\u201d and admonished that \u201cany future action filed in this court involving baseless claims will be subject to swift monetary sanction.\u201d The court denied Beaver\u2019s subsequent post-judgment motion for relief because \u201cthere was no evidence that [Beaver] had been retaliated against in violation of the ADA.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b659-8\">On appeal Beaver argues first that the district court\u2019s decision and subsequent order do not comport with Circuit Rule 50, which requires a district court to provide reasons for decisions that terminate litigation. Beaver\u2019s argument borders on the frivolous. The court\u2019s summary judgment order, which ran five pages long, examined the underlying merits of the suit in detail\u2014it analyzed several ADA provisions, applied them to Beaver\u2019s complaint, and explained that the ADA did not protect Beaver because he \u201cwas not retaliated against for opposing any acts made unlawful by the ADA, nor was he participating in any investigation under the ADA.\u201d Moreover, to the extent that Rule 50 even applies to the court\u2019s post-judgment order, <em>see Stoller v. Pure Fishing, Inc., </em>528 F.3d 478, 480 (7th Cir.2008), its purposes were met by the district court\u2019s seven-line order, which reiterated that Beaver had not presented any evidence of retaliation.</p>\n<p id=\"b659-10\">Beaver next challenges the court\u2019s sanction\u2014admonishing him that he would be fined for future frivolous filings\u2014as violating Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 11(c) because the court did not first issue an order to \u201cshow cause\u201d why his conduct did not violate the rule. But in April 2008, at a motions hearing, the district judge said that he planned to \u201cexercise my authority under Rule 11(c) to consider sanctions, including attorneys\u2019 fees in this case\u201d because \u201cthere really is no basis in any law for you to bring this action.\u201d And two months later the court followed up its concern by holding a hearing on Rule 11 sanctions, which led to the admonition in question. Beaver offers no articulable basis for why these proceedings were insufficient under Rule 11.</p>\n<p id=\"b659-11\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
