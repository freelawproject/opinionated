We review de novo his contention that the district court erred in holding his conviction for kidnapping under California Penal Code \u00a7 207 to categorically be a crime of violence for purposes of a 16-level guidelines enhancement under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2L1.2. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"11\">*11</page-number>We agree, and accordingly vacate his sentence and remand for resentencing. We reject Fernandez-Serrano\u2019s other arguments.</p>\n<p id=\"b35-5\">Fernandez-Serrano\u2019s \u00a7 207 conviction is not categorically a crime of violence because the conviction lacked the \u201cnefarious purpose\u201d element of the generic crime of kidnapping. <em>See United States v. Gonzalez-Perez, </em>472 F.3d 1158, 1161 (9th Cir. 2007). The conviction also does not have as an element the use, attempted use, or threatened use of <em>physical </em>force against the person of another. <em>See United States v. Lopez-Montanez, </em>421 F.3d 926, 931 (9th Cir.2005). We decline to apply the modified categorical approach to Fernandez-Serrano\u2019s \u00a7 207 conviction, but remand to the district court on an open record to determine whether to apply the modified categorical approach in the first instance. <em>See United States v. Grisel, </em>488 F.3d 844, 852 (9th Cir.2007) (en banc).</p>\n<p id=\"b35-6\">We reject Fernandez-Serrano\u2019s contention that he deserves an adjustment for acceptance of responsibility under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3El.l(a). Fernandez-Serrano actively argued at trial that he was not guilty and that the government could not meet its burden of proof. He called into question the reliability of government witnesses and declined to speak to the probation officer. Given these actions, the district court did not clearly err in denying the acceptance of responsibility adjustment. <em>See United States v. Weiland, </em>420 F.3d 1062, 1080 (9th Cir.2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b35-7\">The district court also did not err when it increased Fernandez-Serrano\u2019s statutory maximum sentence even though the indictment failed to allege a specific date of deportation. The indictment permitted the jury to find Fernandez-Serrano guilty only if he was removed <em>after </em>the date of his aggravated felony conviction, which <em>was </em>alleged. More is not required. <em>See United States v. Martinez-Rodriguez, </em>472 F.3d 1087, 1093-94 (9th Cir.2007); <em>see also United States v. Salazar-Lopez, </em>506 F.3d 748, 752 (9th Cir.2007).</p>\n<p id=\"b35-9\">Fernandez-Serrano correctly recognizes that his arguments that the prior conviction exception of <em>Almendarez-Torres v. United States, </em>523 U.S. 224, 118 S.Ct. 1219, 140 L.Ed.2d 350 (1998), should be limited to its facts, that <em>Almendarez-Torres </em>has been implicitly overruled, and that \u00a7 1326 is unconstitutional, are foreclosed by circuit precedent. <em>See Salazar-Lopez, </em>506 F.3d at 751 n. 3.</p>\n<p id=\"b35-10\">VACATED and REMANDED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b34-20\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9 th Cir.
