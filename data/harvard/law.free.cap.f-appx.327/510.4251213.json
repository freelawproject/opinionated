Guajardo argues that his sentence was substantively unreasonable because the guidelines sentence range was greater than necessary to meet the requirements of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a). Guajardo acknowledges that a discretionary sentence imposed within a properly calculated guidelines range is entitled to a rebuttable presumption of reasonableness, citing <em>Kimbrough v. United States, </em>552 U.S. 85, 128 S.Ct. 558, 574-75, 169 L.Ed.2d 481 (2007), however, he contends that his within-guidelines sentence is not entitled to a presumption of reasonableness because the drug offense guideline, U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2D1.1, is not supported by empirical research and may result in sentences greater than necessary in normal cases.</p>\n<p id=\"b534-20\">Guajardo\u2019s reliance on <em>Kimbrough </em>is misplaced. While the Supreme Court did note that the drug trafficking guideline was based upon drug quantity and not empirical research, the Court held only that a district court may sentence a defendant outside of the guidelines range on the basis that it had determined that the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"511\">*511</page-number>guidelines range was flawed, not that the permissible appellate court presumption is inapplicable in drug trafficking cases. <em>See Kimbrough, </em>128 S.Ct. at 564, 567, 571-76. In other words, <em>Kimbrough </em>did not tie the presumption of reasonableness to whether the guideline was supported by empirical research. <em>See id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b535-5\">Guajardo also argues that his sentence was greater than necessary to meet the goals of Section 3553(a). For the reasons noted above, Guajardo\u2019s within-guidelines sentence is presumptively reasonable. <em>See United States v. Alonzo, </em>435 F.3d 551, 554 (5th Cir.2006). Guajardo has presented nothing on appeal that was not specifically considered by the district court in choosing a sentence within the guidelines range that met the requirements of Section 3553(a). The district court\u2019s judgment is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b534-21\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
