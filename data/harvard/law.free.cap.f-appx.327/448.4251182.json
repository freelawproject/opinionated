The district court sentenced Wright to concurrent terms of 168 months in prison. Wright appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b473-5\">Wright\u2019s counsel has filed a brief pursuant to <em>Anders v. California, </em>386 U.S. 738, 87 S.Ct. 1396, 18 L.Ed.2d 493 (1967), stating that, in her view, there are no meritorious grounds for appeal. Counsel questions, however, whether Wright was denied effective assistance of counsel. This court \u201cmay address [claims of ineffective assistance] on direct appeal only if the lawyer\u2019s ineffectiveness conclusively appears from the record.\u201d <em>United States v. Baldovinos, </em>434 F.3d 233, 239 (4th Cir. 2006). We find that Wright has failed to meet this high standard and therefore decline to review this claim on direct appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b473-6\">In accordance with <em>Anders, </em>we have reviewed the record in this case and have found no meritorious issues for appeal.<footnotemark>*</footnotemark> We therefore affirm Wright\u2019s convictions and sentence. This court requires that counsel inform Wright, in writing, of the right to petition the Supreme Court of the United States for further review. If Wright requests that a petition be filed, but counsel believes that such a petition would be frivolous, then counsel may move in this court for leave to withdraw from representation. Counsel\u2019s motion must state that a copy thereof was served on Wright.</p>\n<p id=\"b473-7\">We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b473-11\">\n<em>AFFIRMED.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b473-8\"> We have reviewed the claims in Wright's pro se supplemental brief and find them to be without merit.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
