Five years later, in late 2007, the Sentencing Commission reduced the base offense levels for some crack offenses and made the changes retx'oaetive. <em>See </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2Dl.l(c); Guidelines Manual, Supp. to App. C 226-31 (2008) (Amendment 706); <em>see generally United States v. Lawrence, </em>535 F.3d 631 (7th Cir.2008). Nomood then moved under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582(c)(2) to reduce his sentence based on Amendment 706. The district court calculated a modified imprisonment range of 87 to 107 months and reduced Norwood\u2019s sentence to 107 months.</p>\n<p id=\"b657-14\">Norwood now appeals, insisting that he is entitled to an even greater reduction. He argues that because the district court originally imposed a sentence \u201cequal to 88.88% of the high end of the guideline range\u201d he should have been resentenced to \u201cthe same 88.88% of the high end\u201d of the revised range. We review the court\u2019s decision for abuse of discretion. <em>United States v. Young, </em>555 F.3d 611, 615 (7th Cir.2009).</p>\n<p id=\"b657-15\">Despite Norwood\u2019s arguments to the contrary, the district court was not required to impose a sentence at exactly the same percentage of the range as before. Indeed, \u00a7 3582(c)(2) merely \u201cpermits,\u201d but does not require, a court to reduce a defendant\u2019s term of imprisonment. <em>United States v. Forman, </em>553 F.3d 585, 588 (7th Cir.2009); <em>Young, </em>555 F.3d at 614-15. And if a district court can decline to make any reduction, surely it is not required to impose an amended sentence at the exact same percentage of the original range. Norwood identifies no other reason why the term of imprisonment imposed constitutes an abuse of discretion.</p>\n<p id=\"b657-16\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
