TYMKOVICH, Circuit Judge.</author>\n<p id=\"b791-10\">Irving Rene Henriquez-Serrano appeals the district court\u2019s denial of his motion seeking a reduction of his sentence. Because we find that Henriquez-Serrano did not bring a motion pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255, and because he is not eligible for relief under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582(c), we AFFIRM the denial of his petition and dismiss this appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b791-11\">I. Background</p>\n<p id=\"b791-12\">Henriquez-Serrano pleaded guilty to an illegal reentry charge under 8 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1326(a) and (b)(2), and was sentenced to 46 months\u2019 imprisonment. Henriquez-Serrano did not file an appeal. Instead, he filed a pro se motion for reduction of his sentence, in which he indicated that he sought relief under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255 and 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582(c). In his motion, Henriquez-Serrano argued a denial of his equal protection and due process rights, alleging in particular, that as a non-citizen of the United States, he could not obtain certain sentencing benefits available to citizens, including obtaining a reduction in sentence through participation in a drug rehabilitation program and placement in a half-way house. To remedy this alleged discrimination, he asked the court to grant a reduction in his sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b791-16\">The district court denied the motion. First, the court explained that HenriquezSerrano\u2019s motion sought a reduction in his sentence pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255; however, the court found that none of Henriquez-Serrano\u2019s allegations supported relief under that statute. Second, the court concluded that 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582(c)(2) permits a court to modify a sentence only under very limited circumstances, none of which existed in Henriquez-Serrano\u2019s case.</p>\n<p id=\"b791-17\">II. Analysis</p>\n<p id=\"b791-18\">Because of his status as a pro se litigant, we construe Henriquez-Serrano\u2019s filing liberally. <em>See Andrews v. Heaton, </em>483 F.3d 1070, 1076 (10th Cir.2007).</p>\n<p id=\"b791-19\">As an initial matter, we decline to construe his motion under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255. Despite the fact that Henriquez-Serrano claimed he was proceeding under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255, as well as under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582, we do not view his motion as constituting a collateral attack on his underlying conviction or sentence as imposed by the court. A 28 U.S.C. \u201c\u00a7 2255 petition attacks the legality of detention,\u201d rather than the execution of a sentence. <em>Cara</em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"768\">*768</page-number><em>valho v. Pugh, </em>177 F.3d 1177, 1178 (10th Cir.1999) (citation omitted); <em>see </em>28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255 (establishing that a federal prisoner can challenge a sentence as a violation of the Constitution or laws of the United States, as imposed by a court without jurisdiction, as beyond the maximum permitted by law, or as otherwise subject to collateral attack).</p>\n<p id=\"b792-4\">Instead, he contends he properly lodged his motion under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582. Consequently, viewing his pro se filing liberally, and to avoid prejudicing a future 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255 habeas petition, we decline to construe his filing under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255. <em>See Castro v. United States, </em>540 U.S. 375, 381-82, 124 S.Ct. 786, 157 L.Ed.2d 778 (2003) (\u201cFederal courts sometimes will ignore the legal label that a pro se litigant attaches to a motion and recharacterize the motion in order to place it within a different legal category.... They may do so in order to avoid an unnecessary dismissal, ... to avoid inappropriately stringent application of formal labeling requirements, ... or to create a better correspondence between the substance of a pro se motion\u2019s claim and its underlying legal basis.\u201d); <em>United States v. Martin, </em>357 F.3d 1198, 1199-1200 (10th Cir.2004) (explaining that a court should not characterize a pro se litigant\u2019s motion as a request for relief under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255 unless the court warns the litigant of the consequences of having any future 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255 petition be successive and subject to the ensuing rigorous restrictions, and the court affords the litigant an opportunity to withdraw or amend his motion) (citing <em>Castro, </em>540 U.S. at 382, 124 S.Ct. 786).</p>\n<p id=\"b792-6\">We turn to 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582. <em>See United States v. Sharkey, </em>543 F.3d 1236, 1238 (10th Cir.2008) (\u201cWhen a \u2018motion for [a] sentence reduction is not a direct appeal or a collateral attack under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255, the viability of [the] motion depends entirely on 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582(c).\u2019 \u201d) (citation omitted). Section 3582(c) permits a district court to modify a sentence in only three limited circumstances: (1) on motion of the Director of the Bureau of Prisons if special circumstances exist; (2) if otherwise expressly permitted by statute or Federal Rule of Criminal Procedure 35; or (3) if the sentencing range is subsequently lowered by the United States Sentencing Commission. <em>Id. </em>at 1239; 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582(c). Henriquez-Serrano\u2019s arguments do not implicate any of these circumstances\u2014his sole contention is that he has been denied eligibility in certain prison programs that may reduce his sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b792-8\">Finally, Henriquez-Serrano gets no solace by pointing to the sentencing factors of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553 to support his motion for a reduction of his sentence. \u201c[C]lear and significant differences\u201d exist between original sentencing proceedings, which are governed by 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553, and sentence modification proceedings, governed by 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582(c).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> <em>United States v. Rhodes, </em>549 F.3d 833, 840 (10th Cir.2008); <em>see also United States v. Williamson, </em>315 Fed.Appx. 690, 693 (10th Cir.2009) (\u201c[Because a \u00a7 3582(c)(2) modification proceeding is not a full resentencing, <em>Rhodes, </em>549 F.3d at 840, the district court \u2018had no occasion to consider the 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a) factors.\u2019 <em>Sharkey, </em>543 F.3d at 1239.\u201d). This argument provides no support for relief under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582.</p>\n<p id=\"b792-10\">To the extent Henriquez-Serrano is referring to language in 18 U.S.C.</p>\n<p id=\"b793-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"769\">*769</page-number>\u00a7 3582(c)(2), his contention is still merit-less. Section 3582(c)(2) provides that \u201cin the case of a defendant who has been sentenced to a term of imprisonment based on a sentencing range that has subsequently been lowered by the Sentencing Commission ... the court may reduce the term of imprisonment, after considering the factors set forth in section 3553(a) to the extent they are applicable, if such a reduction is consistent with applicable policy statements issued by the Sentencing Commission.\u201d 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582(c)(2). Henriquez-Serrano makes no argument that the applicable sentencing range has been lowered by the Sentencing Commission. <em>See United States v. Price, </em>438 F.3d 1005, 1006-07 (10th Cir.2006) (\u201cBy the terms of the statute, then, the court only has authority to modify a sentence when the range has been lowered \u2018by the Sentencing Commission.\u2019 \u201d) (citing 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582). Therefore, Henriquez-Serrano is not entitled to a sentence reduction either under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582(c)(2) or 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553. <em>See Sharkey, </em>543 F.3d at 1239 (explaining that because the Amendment at issue had no effect on the guideline Sharkey was sentenced under, Sharkey\u2019s motion for relief pursuant to 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582(c)(2) was properly denied, and consequently \u201c[t]he district court did not re-sentence Sharkey and therefore had no occasion to consider the 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a) factors\u201d).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b793-5\">For the foregoing reasons, we AFFIRM the denial of Henriquez-Serrano\u2019s motion and DISMISS this appeal.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b791-20\"><em> </em>This order and judgment is not binding precedent except under the doctrines of law of the case, res judicata and collateral estoppel. It may be cited, however, for its persuasive value consistent with Fed. R.App. P. 32.1 and 10th Cir. R. 32.1.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b792-5\">. We also decline to view Henriquez-Serrano's reference to 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553\u2014inserted as support for his argument that the district court erred in construing his motion as one under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255 rather than 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582\u2014as rendering this a 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255 petition challenging his underlying sentence.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b793-7\">. Additionally, although not addressed by the district court in its order, it appears from the record that Henriquez-Serrano waived the ability to collaterally attack his sentence under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255, or to seek a reduction in his sentence under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582(c)(2). <em>See </em>Dist. Ct. R.10, May 8, 2007, Plea Agreement, at 6.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
