He seeks an order from this court directing the district court to act. Our review of the docket sheet reveals that on May 13, 2009, the district court transferred claims 13 through 30 of Farrakhan\u2019s complaint to the Western District of Virginia, the court of proper venue pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1391(b) (2006), and dismissed claims 1, 3 through 9, 11, and 12 pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915A(b)(l) (2006) for failure to state a claim. Claims 2 and 10 remain pending in the Eastern District.</p>\n<p id=\"b432-21\">Because the district court has recently acted in Farrakhan\u2019s case, we deny the mandamus petition as moot. We grant leave to proceed in forma pauperis and deny Farrakhan\u2019s motion for appointment of counsel. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b432-22\">\n<em>PETITION DENIED.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
