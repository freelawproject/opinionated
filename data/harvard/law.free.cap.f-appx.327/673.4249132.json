Fonville argued his sentence was based upon the United States Sentencing Guidelines (U.S.S.G. or Guidelines), and therefore, his sentence should be reduced pursuant to the Guidelines\u2019 amendments which retroactively reduced the offense level applicable to cocaine base (crack) offenses. <em>See </em>Amendment 706 to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 1B1.10(c); Amendment 715 to U.S.S.G. \u00a7\u00a7 1B1.10, 2D1.1. The district court denied Fonville\u2019s motion because Fonville was sentenced according to the terms of a Federal Rule of Criminal Procedure 11(c)(1)(C) (formerly Fed.R.Crim.P. 11(e)(1)(C)) plea agreement, which was agreed to by the parties and accepted by the sentencing court.</p>\n<p id=\"b698-9\">On appeal, Fonville argues his Rule 11(c)(1)(C) plea agreement does not preclude a sentence reduction under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582(c)(2). In <em>United States v. Scurlark, </em>560 F.3d 839, 842-13 (8th Cir.2009), our court held that when a sentence is based upon a binding Rule 11(c)(1)(C) plea agreement, courts are bound by the terms of the agreement and have no authority under \u00a7 3582(c)(2) to alter those terms because of the subsequently amended Guidelines for the retroactive crack cocaine sentencing reduction. We follow our precedent, as we must, and affirm the district court\u2019s opinion and judgment denying Fonville\u2019s motion for a reduced sentence.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b698-10\">.
