We have jurisdiction pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1291, 2253, and 2255, and we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b776-8\">Ramirez is barred from using a \u00a7 2255 motion to relitigate issues decided on direct appeal. <em>See United States v. Redd, </em>759 F.2d 699, 701 (9th Cir.1985). Because we held on direct appeal that any error that occurred when Ramirez\u2019s wife invoked her marital testimonial privilege in front of the jury was harmless, <em>see United States v. Ramirez, </em>44 Fed.Appx. 80, 84 (9th Cir.2002) (unpublished disposition), Ramirez is barred from contending here that his attorney rendered ineffective assistance by forcing Ramirez\u2019s wife to invoke her privilege before the jury. <em>See Redd, </em>759 F.2d at 701.</p>\n<p id=\"b776-9\">Moreover, the district court did not err when it denied Ramirez\u2019s motion because Ramirez failed to show that his attorney rendered ineffective assistance. <em>See Strickland v. Washington, </em>466 U.S. 668, 687, 104 S.Ct. 2052, 80 L.Ed.2d 674 (1984). On direct appeal, we held the district court did not err when it admitted at trial the grand jury testimony of Ramirez\u2019s wife. <em>See Ramirez, </em>44 Fed.Appx. at 84. This determination is binding on us. <em>See United States v. Scrivner, </em>189 F.3d 825, 828 (9th Cir.1999). Therefore, even assuming the failure of Ramirez\u2019s attorney to object to the admission of this testimony is deficient performance, Ramirez cannot show prejudice because the grand jury testimony was admissible. <em>See Strickland, </em>466 U.S. at 688, 104 S.Ct. 2052. Similarly, we held on direct appeal that \u201cno error, much less plain error\u201d resulted from the failure to sever Ramirez\u2019s trial from that of his co-defendants. <em>Ramirez, </em>44 Fed.Appx. at 84. Therefore, Ramirez was not prejudiced by the failure of his attorney to move to sever Ramirez\u2019s trial. <em>See Strickland, </em>466 U.S. at 688,104 S.Ct. 2052.</p>\n<p id=\"b776-12\">Finally, Ramirez has failed to show that he was prejudiced by his attorney\u2019s failure to help Ramirez\u2019s wife invoke her marital testimonial privilege, his attorney\u2019s failure to object to the district court\u2019s advice to Ramirez\u2019s wife regarding her marital testimonial privilege, his attorney\u2019s failure to urge the district court to advise Ramirez\u2019s wife she could refuse to testify, or his attorney\u2019s failure to invoke the marital communications privilege on Ramirez\u2019s behalf; even had the testimony of Ramirez\u2019s wife been excluded, the district court admitted other evidence that justified Ramirez\u2019s convictions. <em>See id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b776-13\">The district court did not abuse its discretion when it did not grant Ramirez an evidentiary hearing because Ramirez failed to make \u201cspecific factual allegations that, if true, state a claim upon which relief could <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"753\">*753</page-number>be granted.\u201d <em>United States v. Leonti, </em>326 F.3d 1111, 1116 (9th Cir.2003).</p>\n<p id=\"b777-5\">Finally, we decline to consider the uncertified issues Ramirez raises in his opening brief. <em>See </em>9th Cir. R. 22-1 (e).</p>\n<p id=\"b777-6\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b776-10\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9th Cir.
