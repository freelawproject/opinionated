He contends that he did not enter the United States free from \u201cofficial restraint\u201d and that the government therefore failed to prove the elements of illegal entry beyond a reasonable doubt. We review de novo the district court\u2019s denial of a motion for judgment of acquittal pursuant to Rule 29 of the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure, <em>see United States v. Ruiz-Lopez, </em>234 F.3d 445, 447-48 (9th Cir.2000), and we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b49-16\">Viewing the evidence in the light most favorable to the prosecution, <em>United States v. Zavala-Mendez, </em>411 F.3d 1116, 1118 (9th Cir.2005), there was a lapse in official observation by U.S. officials between the time Arook passed from the view of U.S. border cameras and the time Agent Pohjonen arrived and took Arook into custody, <em>see United States v. Hernandez-Herr era, </em>273 F.3d 1213, 1219 (9th Cir. 2001) (holding that even a very brief lapse in official observation is sufficient to establish entry).</p>\n<p id=\"b49-17\">That Arook may have been observed by an off-duty, Canadian border official has no bearing on our decision. To constitute official restraint, the constant surveillance must be by \u201cgovernmental authorities.\u201d <em>United States v. Castellanos-Garcia, </em>270 F.3d 773, 775 (9th Cir.2001); <em>Hernandez-Herrera, </em>273 F.3d at 1219. In the context of enforcing U.S. immigration laws, \u201cgovernmental authorities\u201d clearly means authorities of the U.S. government. The independent actions of a non-U.S. citizen (who happened to be an off-duty, foreign official) in reporting a crime cannot be imputed to the U.S. government as an official action. And, even if those actions were imputable to the U.S. government, the foreign official\u2019s observations were not constant.</p>\n<p id=\"b49-18\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b49-14\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9th Cir.
