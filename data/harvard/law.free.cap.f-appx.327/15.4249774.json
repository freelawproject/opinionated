His claim is that his Sixth Amendment rights were violated because the trial judge, and not a jury, found statutory aggravating factors and increased his sentence beyond the presumptive one, citing <em>Apprendi v. New Jersey, </em>530 U.S. 466, 120 S.Ct. 2348, 147 L.Ed.2d 435 (2000). The district court denied the petition, holding that Scott had <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"17\">*17</page-number>procedurally defaulted on the <em>Apprendi </em>claim under Ariz. R.Crim. P. 32.2(a)(3).</p>\n<p id=\"b41-5\">1. The right Scott seeks to invoke was not clearly established until <em>Blakely v. Washington, </em>542 U.S. 296, 124 S.Ct. 2531, 159 L.Ed.2d 403 (2004), a decision announcing a new constitutional rule of criminal procedure. <em>See Schardt v. Payne, </em>414 F.3d 1025, 1038 (9th Cir.2005) (holding <em>Blakely </em>not retroactive). In <em>Blakely, </em>the Court applied <em>Apprendi </em>to a Washington statute that allowed a trial judge to impose an \u201cexceptional\u201d sentence upon his own findings that the defendant acted with \u201cdeliberate cruelty.\u201d 542 U.S. at 298, 301,124 S.Ct. 2531. The Court held that this procedure violated <em>Apprendi </em>because the relevant \u201cstatutory maximum\u201d for <em>Apprendi </em>purposes was the maximum sentence a judge may impose without finding any additional facts, rejecting the state\u2019s argument that the only relevant maximum under <em>Apprendi </em>is the maximum the judge could impose under state law after finding additional facts. <em>Id. </em>at 303-04, 124 S.Ct. 2531.</p>\n<p id=\"b41-6\">Similarly here, Scott was convicted of second-degree murder, carrying a \u201cpresumptive\u201d term of 16 years. By statute, the sentence can be increased on a finding of statutory aggravating factors, and Scott\u2019s claim, like Blakely\u2019s, is that the Sixth Amendment requires that a jury find these factors. Scott\u2019s claim is, then, \u201cvirtually indistinguishable from the question reviewed by the Supreme Court in <em>Blakely. </em>In both cases, the judge imposed a sentence greater than the standard range specified [in the applicable state law] based on findings made by the judge, rather than the jury.\u201d <em>Schardt, </em>414 F.3d at 1032. The <em>Blakely </em>rule is \u201cnew,\u201d as we explained in <em>Schardt, </em>because it was not clear that <em>Apprendi </em>alone would have compelled the rule announced by the Court in <em>Blakely; </em>as we noted, every circuit court considering the question presented in <em>Blakely </em>had reached the opposite conclusion later reached by the Supreme Court. <em>See id. </em>at 1035.</p>\n<p id=\"b41-8\">2. Scott\u2019s conviction and sentence became final in 2002, when the time for filing a petition for writ of certiorari on direct appeal expired. <em>See Caspari v. Bohlen, </em>510 U.S. 383, 390, 114 S.Ct. 948, 127 L.Ed.2d 236 (1994). <em>Blakely </em>was not decided until 2004. The new rule announced in <em>Blakely </em>was therefore not applicable to Scott on habeas. <em>See Schardt, </em>414 F.3d at 1038.</p>\n<p id=\"b41-9\">3. Scott maintained at oral argument that because Arizona \u201cRule 32 of-right\u201d post-conviction relief proceedings are a form of direct appeal, <em>Blakely </em>is available to him, because his post-conviction proceedings were not final until 2005, after <em>Blakely </em>had been decided. Under the Arizona rules, however, a \u201cRule 32 of-right proceeding\u201d is only available to \u201c[a]ny person who pled guilty or no contest, admitted a probation violation, or whose probation was automatically violated based upon a plea of guilty or no contest.\u201d Ariz. R.Crim. P. 32.1. Scott\u2019s post-conviction relief proceedings, however, came after his trial and direct appeals, not after a guilty or no contest plea. It was therefore not a \u201cRule 32 of-right\u201d proceeding.</p>\n<p id=\"b41-10\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b40-9\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9th Cir.
