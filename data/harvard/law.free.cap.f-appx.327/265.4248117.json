Apr. 25, 2008), <em>affg </em>No. A 99 523 206 (Immig. Ct. Buffalo Aug. 25, 2006). We assume the parties\u2019 familiarity with the underlying facts and procedural history in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b290-21\">When the BIA does not expressly \u201cadopt\u201d the IJ\u2019s decision, but its brief opinion closely tracks the IJ\u2019s reasoning, the Court may consider both the IJ\u2019s and the BIA\u2019s opinions \u201cfor the sake of completeness.\u201d <em>Zaman v. Mukasey, </em>514 F.3d 233, 237 (2d Cir.2008) (per curiam) (internal quotation marks omitted). We review the agency\u2019s factual findings under the substantial evidence standard. 8 U.S.C. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"267\">*267</page-number>\u00a7 1252(b)(4)(B); <em>see also Corovic v. Mukasey, </em>519 F.3d 90, 95 (2d Cir.2008). We review <em>de novo </em>questions of law and the application of law to undisputed fact. <em>See Salimatou Bah v. Mukasey, </em>529 F.3d 99, 110 (2d Cir.2008).</p>\n<p id=\"b291-5\">As an initial matter, because Hirpa fails to challenge the IJ\u2019s denial of his claims for relief on account of his Oromo ethnicity, we consider that claim abandoned. <em>See Gui Yin Liu v. INS, </em>508 F.3d 716, 723 n. 6 (2d Cir.2007) (per curiam). We thus limit our review to the agency\u2019s conclusions that Hirpa failed to demonstrate that (1) he endured past persecution, and (2) any alleged persecution was on account of his political opinion. We find that the agency erred on both counts.</p>\n<p id=\"b291-6\">Hirpa testified that after he participated in a demonstration opposing the Ethiopian government following an election, he was detained for nineteen days. He claimed that during his detention, his captors shaved his head, beat him, interrogated him regarding his political affiliation, and registered him according to his ethnicity and political party membership. Upon his release, he was monitored by the government.</p>\n<p id=\"b291-7\">We have recognized that persecution \u201cis an extreme concept that does not include every sort of treatment our society regards as offensive.\u201d <em>Ai Feng Yuan v. U.S. Dep\u2019t of Justice, </em>416 F.3d 192, 198 (2d Cir.2005) (internal quotation marks omitted), <em>overruled in part on other grounds by Shi Liang Lin v. U.S. Dep\u2019t of Justice, </em>494 F.3d 296, 305 (2d Cir.2007) (en banc). However, in <em>Beskovic v. Gonzales, </em>467 F.3d 223, 226 (2d Cir.2006), we cautioned the BIA to be \u201ckeenly sensitive\u201d to the fact that a \u201cminor beating, or for that matter, any physical degradation designed to cause pain, humiliation, or other suffering, may rise to the level of persecution if it occurred in the context of an arrest or detention on the basis of a protected ground.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b291-9\">Here, the IJ observed that Hirpa had \u201cone encounter with the authorities, an encounter resulting in his alleged detention and mistreatment. With respect to this detention, however, [Hirpa] was released without charge.\u201d The IJ further found that although Hirpa alleged that he was mistreated, he \u201coffered no evidence of permanent or serious physical injury amounting to persecution.\u201d The BIA agreed that Hirpa had not endured past persecution. Hirpa, however, presents a similar factual scenario to that which we described in <em>Beskovic </em>as evidence of past persecution. <em>See </em>467 F.3d at 226. Consequently, we find that the IJ and BIA erred when they concluded that Hirpa failed to establish past persecution.</p>\n<p id=\"b291-10\">Notwithstanding this error, remand would be futile if the agency\u2019s nexus finding was proper. <em>See Xiao Ji Chen v. U.S. Dep\u2019t of Justice, </em>471 F.3d 315, 338 (2d Cir.2006). We therefore address that aspect of the agency\u2019s decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b291-11\">In order to demonstrate eligibility for asylum and withholding of removal, an applicant must establish that his or her past persecution or well-founded fear of future persecution is on account of race, religion, nationality, membership in a particular social group, or political opinion. 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1101(a)(42); 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1208.16(b)(1). We have stated that \u201cto establish persecution \u2018on account of political opinion ..., an asylum applicant must show that the persecution arises from his or her own political opinion,\u201d not merely from some \u201cgeneralized political motive.\u201d <em>See Yueqing Zhang v. Gonzales, </em>426 F.3d 540, 545 (2d Cir.2005) (internal quotation marks omitted). Furthermore, \u201c[t]he plain meaning of the phrase \u2018persecution on account of the victim\u2019s political opinion,\u2019 does not mean persecution <em>solely </em>on account of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"268\">*268</page-number>victim\u2019s political opinion.\u201d <em>Osorio v. INS, </em>18 F.3d 1017, 1028 (2d Cir.1994). \u201cWhere there are mixed motives for a persecutor\u2019s actions, an asylum applicant need not show with absolute certainty why the events occurred, but rather, only that the harm was motivated, in part, by an actual or imputed protected ground.\u201d <em>Uwais v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>478 F.3d 513, 517 (2d Cir.2007).</p>\n<p id=\"b292-4\">As the BIA states in its decision, Hirpa was detained for nineteen days after violating the Ethiopian government\u2019s one-month ban on demonstrations imposed during the time period surrounding the country\u2019s May 2005 national elections. It is true that punishment for violation of a generally applicable criminal law is not persecution. <em>See Saleh v. U.S. Dep\u2019t of Justice, </em>962 F.2d 234, 239 (2d Cir.1992). Punishment for committing a crime, however, may also \u201cbe a pretext for punishing an individual for his political opinion.\u201d <em>Matter of S-P-, </em>21 I. &amp; N. Dec. 486, 492 (B.I.A.1996). When examining motive where prosecution may be a pretext for such a purpose, and particularly where there ultimately was no prosecution, \u201cthe evidence must be evaluated ... to determine whether the motive for the abuse in the particular case was directed toward punishing or modifying perceived political views, as opposed to punishment for criminal acts.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 493-94.</p>\n<p id=\"b292-5\">In this case, Hirpa asserts that the Ethiopian government\u2019s ban on demonstrations was imposed to limit political dissent following the outcome of the elections. The agency, however, failed to consider both the \u201cpolitical context\u201d and \u201cpotentially deeply political nature\u201d of Hirpa\u2019s claimed persecution. <em>See Vumi v. Gonzales, </em>502 F.3d 150, 156-57 (2d Cir.2007). Nor did it consider that during his detention, Hirpa was interrogated regarding his affiliation with the opposition CUD party. Moreover, the harm inflicted on Hirpa went \u201cwell beyond the bounds of legitimate questioning\u201d that would be expected for violating the government\u2019s ban on demonstrations. <em>Matter of S-P-, </em>211. <em>&amp; </em>N. Dec. at 495. Accordingly, because the agency failed to consider the political context of Hirpa\u2019s alleged persecution, we remand to give the BIA the opportunity, in the first instance, to properly analyze Hirpa\u2019s claim. <em>See Vumi, </em>502 F.3d at 151.</p>\n<p id=\"b292-7\">Finally, we note that the BIA\u2019s corroboration finding does not convince us that remand would be futile. <em>See Xiao Ji Chen, </em>471 F.3d at 338. Although the IJ noted the lack of corroborative evidence in this case, he did not base his denial of Hirpa\u2019s requests for relief on the absence of such evidence; rather, the IJ denied relief \u201c[separate and apart from the absence of corroboration.\u201d Consequently, the BIA may have acted beyond its authority when it relied on the lack of corroboration as a ground for why Hirpa did not meet his burden of proof as to his asylum claim. <em>See </em>8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1158(b)(1)(B)(ii); 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1003.1(d)(3).</p>\n<p id=\"b292-9\">For the foregoing reasons, the petition for review is GRANTED and the case is REMANDED for further proceedings consistent with this order.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
