Horn denying his applications for asylum, withholding of removal, and relief under the Convention Against Torture (\u201cCAT\u201d). <em>In re Shishi Zhang, </em>No. A 099 649 627 (B.I.A. Oct. 28, 2008), <em>affg </em>No. A 099 649 627 (Immig. Ct. N.Y. City May 8, 2007). We assume the parties\u2019 familiarity with the underlying facts and procedural history in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b333-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"309\">*309</page-number>When the BIA agrees with the IJ\u2019s conclusion that a petitioner is not credible and, without rejecting any of the IJ\u2019s grounds for decision, emphasizes particular aspects of that decision, this Court reviews both the BIA\u2019s and IJ\u2019s opinions\u2014 or more precisely, the Court reviews the IJ\u2019s decision including the portions not explicitly discussed by the BIA. <em>Yun-Zui Guam v. Gonzales, </em>482 F.3d 391, 394 (2d Cir.2005). We review the agency\u2019s factual findings, including adverse credibility determinations, under the substantial evidence standard, treating them as \u201cconclusive unless any reasonable adjudicator would be compelled to conclude to the contrary.\u201d 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(b)(4)(B); <em>see also Xiu Xia Lin v. Mukasey, </em>534 F.3d 162,167 (2d Cir.2008) (\u201cWe defer ... to an IJ\u2019s credibility determination unless, from the totality of the circumstances, it is plain that no reasonable fact-finder could make such an adverse credibility ruling.\u201d). We review <em>de novo </em>questions of law and the application of law to undisputed fact. <em>See Salimatou Bah v. Mukasey, </em>529 F.3d 99, 110 (2d Cir.2008).</p>\n<p id=\"b333-5\">Here, the IJ properly found that inconsistencies in the record showed that Zhang \u201clacked credibility with regard to his claim.\u201d <em>See </em>8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1158(b)(1)(B)(iii). First, he found Zhang\u2019s testimony that the government seized his parents\u2019 home and they were in hiding to be inconsistent with his parents\u2019 use of their home address as the return address on documents they mailed to Zhang in the U.S. Second, the IJ found inconsistencies regarding the circumstances of Zhang\u2019s release from jail. Zhang\u2019s asylum application stated that his \u201cparents asked [for] help from relatives to bail [him] out after thirty days\u2019 detention.\u201d Before the IJ, however, Zhang testified that no one paid money for his release. After the IJ asked him about the statement in his application, Zhang changed his testimony and stated that a relative did pay his bail. When asked who the relative was, Zhang responded \u201c[a] friend of my father.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b333-7\">Zhang contends that: (1) his parents only used the home address \u201cto show that they used to live there and that [the] house was not a fiction,\u201d (2) he misunderstood that \u201cbail\u201d involves a payment, and (3) the person who secured his release from jail may have been both a distant relative and a friend of his father. Although Zhang offers \u201cplausible\u201d explanations for at least some of the inconsistencies, this is insufficient to warrant reversal. <em>Wu Biao Chen v. INS, </em>344 F.3d 272, 275 (2d Cir.2003). Because he has not plainly shown that no reasonable fact-finder could have based an adverse credibility determination on the inconsistencies, we must defer to the agency\u2019s adverse credibility ruling. <em>See Xiu Xia Lin, </em>534 F.3d at 167.</p>\n<p id=\"b333-8\">The IJ also properly discounted letters Zhang submitted. The IJ characterized these letters as \u201callegedly\u201d written by Zhang\u2019s father, aunt, and neighbor, indicating he doubted their authenticity. The IJ reasoned that the letters \u201call seem to labor under the same misconception of what [\u2018bail\u2019] means.\u201d This unlikely consistency of confusion, coupled with Zhang\u2019s inconsistent testimony about whether he was bailed out of jail, sufficiently supported the IJ\u2019s inference that the letters were not authentic. <em>See Siewe v. Gonzales, </em>480 F.3d 160, 168 (2d Cir.2007) (\u201c[W]e we will reject a deduction made by an IJ only when there is a complete absence of probative facts to support it.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b333-9\">Because Zhang failed to present credible evidence that he was persecuted or has a well-founded fear of persecution in China, his claims for asylum and withholding of removal were properly denied. <em>See Wu Biao Chen, </em>344 F.3d at 275-76. Because his CAT claim was based on the same <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"310\">*310</page-number>evidence, this claim fails as well. <em>See Xue Hong Yang v. DOJ, </em>426 F.3d 520, 523 (2d Cir.2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b334-4\">For the foregoing reasons, the petition for review is DENIED. As we have completed our review, the pending motion for a stay of removal is DENIED as moot. Any pending request for oral argument in this petition is DENIED in accordance with Federal Rule of Appellate Procedure 34(a)(2), and Second Circuit Local Rule 34(b).</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
