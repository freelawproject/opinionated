WESLEY, Circuit Judges.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<p id=\"b239-16\">ORDER OF GRIEVANCE PANEL</p>\n<p id=\"b239-17\">By order filed July 16, 2007, this panel referred Carl M. Weideman III to this Court\u2019s Committee on Admissions and Grievances (\u201cthe Committee\u201d) for investigation of the matters described in that order and preparation of a report on whether he should be subject to disciplinary or other corrective measures. <em>See </em>Second Circuit Local Rule 46(h).</p>\n<p id=\"b239-18\">After the referral of the matter to the Committee, Weideman was suspended by the Michigan bar for a period of four years, commencing October 27, 2007, based on his improper lending of certain estate funds to himself and his firm, and his misrepresentations concerning those funds to a court, counsel, and a Michigan grievance administrator. <em>See </em>Order of Michigan Attorney Discipline Board, filed Sept. 28, 2007. The Committee became aware of the September 2007 suspension order and took the order, and the facts underlying the order, into consideration in its proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b239-19\">Weideman, on the other hand, did not address any of the evidence considered by the Committee. Although the Committee twice ordered Weideman to show cause why he should not be subject to disciplinary or other corrective measures, and thereafter left a telephone message for him, he failed to respond to any of the Committee\u2019s communications and did not participate in the Committee\u2019s proceedings. The Committee members assigned to this matter, Eileen M. Blackwood, Terrence M. Connors, and Paul C. Curnin, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"216\">*216</page-number>thereafter determined that they could proceed without a hearing pursuant to Rule 7(d) of the Committee\u2019s Rules. Upon concluding its investigation, the Committee filed in this Court the record of its proceedings and its report and recommendations. Although a copy of the report was served on Weideman in October 2008, he has not responded in any way.</p>\n<p id=\"b240-4\">In its report, the Committee recommended as follows: (a) this Court should give the Michigan four-year suspension reciprocal effect, notwithstanding the fact that Weideman is not admitted to this Court\u2019s bar; and (b) the Court should further discipline Weideman, in light of the Michigan misconduct and suspension, his repeated violations of this Court\u2019s Local Rule 46(d), his failure to cooperate with the Committee\u2019s investigation, and the presence of several aggravating factors identified by the Committee. The Committee recommended the following disciplinary measure, which begins with a reciprocal sanction, but extends that sanction to account for all of Weideman\u2019s offenses:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AzW\">Weideman should not be permitted to seek admission to the Court\u2019s bar until the expiration of two years after the conclusion of his suspension from the practice of law in Michigan, assuming he has successfully completed all other conditions of his Michigan suspension, nor be permitted to practice before the Court under any circumstances until he successfully seeks admission to the Court\u2019s bar.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b240-5\">Report at 6.</p>\n<p id=\"b240-6\">After receipt of the Committee\u2019s report, this Court became aware of further discipline imposed On Weideman by the Michigan bar authorities. In July 2008, Weideman\u2019s license to practice law in Michigan was revoked as a result of his additional misconduct in three immigration cases. <em>See </em>Order of Michigan Attorney Discipline Board, filed June 16, 2008 (attached). According to the complaint filed by the Michigan Grievance Administrator, the immigration cases at issue were, or were intended to be, before the United States Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit, the Board of Immigration Appeals, and an unspecified immigration office or officer (presumably an immigration judge or the BIA). <em>See </em>Oct. 2007 Complaint and Feb. 2008 Amended Complaint of Michigan Grievance Administrator (attached). We are informed that Weideman has not appealed the Michigan revocation order.</p>\n<p id=\"b240-8\">Although the nature of the discipline imposed by Michigan has changed somewhat, it does not alter our view of the Committee\u2019s report or require any additional proceedings since the primary thrust of the Committee\u2019s recommendation is that Weideman not be permitted to apply for admission to this Court\u2019s bar until two years after he is in good standing in Michigan. In any event, in light of the additional information from Michigan, we construe the Committee\u2019s report as making that recommendation.</p>\n<p id=\"b240-9\">Upon due consideration of the matters described above, it is hereby ORDERED that the Committee\u2019s findings and recommendations are adopted by the Court, and Carl M. Weideman III is barred from (a) seeking admission to this Court\u2019s bar until the expiration of two years after his full readmission to the Michigan bar as an attorney in good standing, or (b) practicing before this Court, or performing legal services of any kind in any case in this Court, under any circumstances until he successfully seeks admission to the Court\u2019s bar. Additionally, Weideman is instructed that he must disclose this order in any future attorney disciplinary proceeding or bar application, or if required by any bar or court rule or order.</p>\n<p id=\"b240-10\">The Clerk of Court is directed to release this order to the public by posting it on this Court\u2019s web site and providing copies <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"217\">*217</page-number>to members of the public in the same manner as all other unpublished decisions of this Court. The text of this Panel\u2019s July 2007 order referring this matter to the Committee, the Committee\u2019s report, and the Michigan disciplinary materials referenced above are also to be released to the public, as Appendices to the present order.</p>\n<p id=\"b241-5\">Finally, the Clerk of Court is directed to serve a copy of this order on Weideman, this Court\u2019s Committee on Admissions and Grievances, the Michigan Attorney Discipline Board, the attorney disciplinary committee for the United States Court of Appeals for the Sixth Cii'cuit, and the attorney disciplinary officials for the Executive Office of Immigration Review.</p>\n<p id=\"b241-6\">APPENDIX 1</p>\n<p id=\"b241-7\">\n<em>Text of July 2007 order referring Carl M. Weideman III to this Court\u2019s Committee on Admissions and Grievances</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b241-8\">For the reasons that follow, Carl M. Weideman III is referred to this Court\u2019s Committee on Admissions and Grievances for investigation of the matters described below and preparation of a report on whether he should be subject to disciplinary or other corrective measures. <em>See </em>Second Circuit Local Rule 46(h). We express no opinion here as to an appropriate disposition. The Committee may, of course, in the first instance, determine the appropriate scope of its investigation.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b241-9\">In April 2007, this Court received a letter from Weideman, informing the Court that he had been \u201csuspended from the practice of law for 30 days, from April 21, 2007 to May 21, 2007,\u201d and that he could not appear before the Court during that time period. Accordingly, he requested that the Court adjourn the one matter he currently had pending, <em>Ndoci v. Gonzales, </em>No. 06-3755-ag. The letter did not explain the basis for, or identify the jurisdiction that had imposed, the suspension.</p>\n<p id=\"b241-13\">This Court usually would initiate its reciprocal disciplinary procedures upon being notified of an attorney\u2019s suspension by a state bar or the bar of another court. <em>See </em>Second Circuit Local Rule 46(f). However, after a preliminary investigation of the suspension noted in the April 2007 letter, and of Weideman\u2019s practice in this Court, we instead request the guidance of the Committee regarding the appropriate approach to the circumstances described below.</p>\n<p id=\"b241-14\">After the receipt of Weideman\u2019s April 2007 letter, this Court contacted the Attorney Discipline Board for the State of Michigan\u2014where Weideman is licensed\u2014and received copies of the relevant \u201cOrder of Suspension with Conditions,\u201d No. 06-117-GA (Mar. 30, 2007) (\u201cOrder\u201d) and the \u201cReport of Tri-County Hearing Panel No. 8 on Discipline,\u201d No. 06-117-GA (Mar. 30, 2007) (\u201cReport\u201d). According to the Report, Weideman had been admonished in five prior matters between 2000 and 2005, because of his failure to: \u201ctake all necessary measures to ensure clients\u2019 matters were not jeopardized,\u201d \u201cprotect clients\u2019 interests,\u201d \u201cadequately represent clients\u2019 interests,\u201d \u201cact with reasonable dispatch and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"218\">*218</page-number>promptness in representing client and ... keep client reasonably informed,\u201d and \u201ccommunicate with client.\u201d <em>See </em>Report at 1-2. The Report further indicated that Weideman also had been issued a suspension in another matter, for reasons that were not disclosed, but that the other suspension order was currently under appeal. <em>Id. </em>at 2, 6. Although the Report stated that Weideman had claimed to have \u201cchanged and improved his office procedures and practices as a result of the prior admonitions,\u201d the disciplinary panel found that his testimony on that subject was \u201cvery vague and unpersuasive,\u201d and that any changes he had made after receiving prior admonitions \u201cwere not enough to prevent the professional misconduct which the Panel found in this case.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 4. In addition to being suspended from the practice of law for 30 days, Weideman was ordered to, <em>inter alia, </em>obtain as a mentor an attorney experienced in the practice of immigration law, who would observe his practice for a one-year period and provide advice on \u201cestablishing systems and procedures to ensure that all required court appearances and deadlines are met, to ensure that required filings are made in a timely manner, and to assure regular and full communication with clients.\u201d Order at 1.</p>\n<p id=\"b242-5\">A review of Weideman\u2019s cases in this Court reveals the following information relevant to this referral order. First, contrary to Weideman\u2019s assertion in his letter, he has <em>two </em>cases pending in this Court. Weideman failed to mention <em>Zefi v. Ashcroft, </em>05-0191-ag, which has been pending without significant activity since its filing in January 2005. According to the docket sheet, in April 2005, Weideman indicated that he was considering requesting transfer of the petition for review to the Eleventh Circuit; however, the docket sheet does not indicate that any transfer request was filed and a scheduling order was issued in April 2007.</p>\n<p id=\"b242-9\">Second, Weideman\u2019s briefing was criticized in <em>Urita v. Gonzales, </em>02-4553-ag. In this Court\u2019s April 2005 order denying the petition, the panel held, <em>inter alia, </em>that the petitioner had waived two of his major arguments by failing to comply with Federal Rule of Appellate Procedure 28. In particular, the panel noted that his argument that the immigration judge\u2019s adverse credibility finding was not supported by substantial evidence was deficient in that he merely recited the substantial evidence standard and made conelusory statements about the evidence, without citing to the record or connecting the law to the facts.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> <em>See Urita, </em>02-4553-ag, Order filed Apr. 15, 2005 [128 Fed.Appx. 810].</p>\n<p id=\"b242-10\">Third, this Court recently dismissed <em>Gashaj v. Gonzales, </em>07-0438-ag, in which Weideman is the petitioner\u2019s counsel of record, based on the petitioner\u2019s failure <em>to </em>file the required addendums to Form C/A. <em>See Gashaj, </em>07-0438-ag, Order filed April 11, 2007. Although it is not clear whether that default constituted misconduct, Weideman did not request an extension of time to comply with the addendum requirement, move to withdraw the case, or respond to the Court\u2019s notification that the omission need to be cured. In other appeals where defaults occurred, Weideman\u2019s motions for leave to file late briefs consisted primarily of boiler-plate verbiage and factual assertions lacking a clear connection to the relief requested. <em>Compare Gorvokovic v. Ashcroft, </em>03-4023-ag, Mo<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"219\">*219</page-number>tion filed Nov. 20, 2006, <em>with Charcani v. Gonzales, </em>03-40274-ag, Motion filed May 23, 2005.</p>\n<p id=\"b243-6\">Upon due consideration of the matters described above, it is ORDERED that Carl M. Weideman III is referred to this Court\u2019s Committee on Admissions and Grievances for investigation and preparation of a report, pursuant to Federal Rule of Appellate Procedure 46, this Court\u2019s Local Rule 46(h), and the Rules of the Committee on Admissions and Grievances. The Court requests that the Committee, as part of its deliberations, consider whether some form of oversight of Weideman\u2019s practice in this Court is warranted and, if so, whether that oversight should be coordinated in some fashion with the mentoring attorney required by the Michigan Order. <em>See, e.g., Hua Liu v. Bureau of Citizenship and Immigration Serv., </em>No. 03-4640-ag, Order filed Oct. 17, 2005 (appointing special master to oversee attorney\u2019s law practice for two years in order to, <em>inter alia, </em>certify attorney\u2019s compliance with all deadlines and prevent attorney from taking on an unmanageable workload).</p>\n<p id=\"b243-7\">FOR THE COURT:</p>\n<p id=\"b243-8\">Catherine O\u2019Hagan Wolfe, Clerk</p>\n<p id=\"AhP\">By: /\u00a7/</p>\n<p id=\"b243-9\">Michael Zachary</p>\n<p id=\"ArQ\">Supervisory Staff Attorney</p>\n<p id=\"b243-10\">APPENDIX 2</p>\n<p id=\"b243-11\">\n<em>September 2008 Report of the Committee on Admissions and Grievances (without exhibits)</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b243-12\">\n<em>UNITED STATES COURT OF APPEALS</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b243-13\">\n<em>FOR THE SECOND CIRCUIT</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b243-14\">\n<em>COMMITTEE ON ADMISSIONS AND GRIEVANCES</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"AnR\">\n<em>Mary Jo White</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b243-16\">\n<em>Chair</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b243-17\">\n<em>Debevoise &amp; Plimpton LLP</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b243-18\">\n<em>919 Third Avenue</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b243-19\">\n<em>New York, NY, 10022</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b243-20\">\n<em>Tel: (212)909-6260</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b243-21\">\n<em>Shanya Dingle and Felix Gilman</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b243-22\">\n<em>Secretaries</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b243-23\">\n<em>Debevoise &amp; Plimpton LLP</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"AVD\">\n<em>New York, NY, 10022</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"A7p\">\n<em>Tel: (212)909-6000</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"AQe\">\n<em>Email: sjdingle @debevoise.com,</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"AV_\">\n<em>fjgilman @debevoise.com</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"A5D\">\n<em>Committee Members:</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b243-24\">\n<em>Eileen M.

Weideman, III, # 07-9035-am</p>\n<p id=\"b243-35\">I. Introduction</p>\n<p id=\"b243-36\">By order dated July 16, 2007, the United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit (the \u201cCourt\u201d) referred Carl. M. Weideman, III, to this Committee for investigation of his conduct before the Court and for preparation of a report on whether <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"220\">*220</page-number>he should be subject to disciplinary or other corrective measures.</p>\n<p id=\"b244-5\">Weideman has been suspended by the State of Michigan Attorney Review Board for four years for serious misconduct involving funds entrusted to him as an executor of an estate and misrepresentations regarding the availability of those funds. Additionally, Weideman has never been admitted to the Court\u2019s bar despite repeated appearances before the Court and he failed to cooperate with the Committee\u2019s investigation into his conduct. In light of this serious misconduct, the Committee recommends that Weideman not be permitted to practice before the Court until two years after the conclusion of his suspension in Michigan. The following constitutes the Committee\u2019s report and recommendation to impose discipline on Weideman.</p>\n<p id=\"b244-6\">II. The Referral Order</p>\n<p id=\"b244-7\">The Court referred Weideman to the Committee by order dated July 16, 2007 (the \u201cReferral Order\u201d). According to the Referral Order, Weideman informed the Court in April 2007 that he had been suspended from the practice of law in Michigan for thirty days (April 21, 2007 to May 21, 2007). After receipt of Weideman\u2019s letter, the Court obtained from the State of Michigan Attorney Discipline Board the March 30, 2007 Order of Suspension with Conditions and the March 30, 2007 Report of Tri-County Hearing Panel No. 8 on Discipline, No. 06-117-GA (the \u201cReport\u201d).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> According to the Report, Weideman had been admonished in five prior matters between 2000 and 2005 because of his failure to protect his clients\u2019 interests and adequately represent his clients. In addition to suspending Weideman for thirty days, the Attorney Discipline Board also ordered Weideman to obtain a mentor with immigration law experience to monitor Weideman\u2019s practice for one year and provide advice on establishing procedures to better represent his clients.</p>\n<p id=\"b244-13\">The Referral Order also noted concerns about Weideman\u2019s conduct in cases pending in the Second Circuit. No activity had occurred in <em>Zefi v. Ashcroft, </em>05-0191-ag, between January 2005, when the petition for review was filed, and over two years later when the Court entered the Referral Order in July 2007.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> In <em>Urita v. Gonzales, </em>02-4553-ag, the Court\u2019s April 2005 order denying the petition for review criticized Weideman\u2019s briefing. The Court held that Weideman\u2019s client had waived two of his most significant arguments by failing to comply with Federal Rule of Appellate Procedure 28, which requires an appellant\u2019s brief to contain, among other things, the \u201cappellant\u2019s contentions and the reasons for them, with citations to the authorities and parts of the record on which the appellant relies.\u201d Fed. RApp. P. 28(a)(9)(A). In <em>Gashaj v. Gonzales, </em>07-0438-ag, the Court dismissed Weideman\u2019s client\u2019s petition for review based on the petitioner\u2019s failure to file the required addendums to Form C/A.</p>\n<p id=\"b244-14\">Additionally, the Referral Order indicated that a \u201cCarl M. Weideman\u201d was admitted to the Court\u2019s bar in 1988, but the listing does not include \u201cIII\u201d after the surname. The Court requested that the Committee \u201cdetermine Weideman\u2019s status with [the] Court and whether he is in compliance with Second Circuit Local Rule 46(d),\u201d which requires counsel of record <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"221\">*221</page-number>for all parties to be admitted to practice before the Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b245-6\">As part of its referral, the Court requested the Committee to \u201cconsider whether some form of oversight of Weideman\u2019s practice in this Court is warranted and, if so, whether that oversight should be coordinated in some fashion with the mentoring attorney required by the Michigan Order.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b245-7\">III. This Disciplinary Proceeding</p>\n<p id=\"b245-8\">On March 21, 2008, this Committee issued an Order to Show Cause regarding Weideman\u2019s conduct as alleged in the Referral Order. The Order to Show Cause was sent to the address Weideman listed on his notice of appearance in <em>Gashaj v. Gonzales, </em>07-0438-ag, which is the same address on the letterhead of Weideman\u2019s April 2007 letter to the Court. After Weideman failed to respond to the Order to Show Cause, the Committee sent a second notice to Weideman on April 30, 2008. The April 30, 2008 letter informed Weideman that if he did not respond by May 13, 2008, the Committee would proceed without the benefit of his response. The Committee also attempted to reach Weideman at the telephone number he listed on his notice of appearance in <em>Gashaj v. Gonzales, </em>07-0438-ag. Weideman failed to respond to the Order to Show Cause and follow up letter, did not return the telephone message left for him, and has not otherwise contacted the Committee. Therefore, a sub-committee consisting of Eileen M. Blackwood, Terrence M. Connors, and Paul C. Curnin elected to proceed in this matter without a hearing in accordance with Rule 7(d) of the Rules of the Committee on Admissions and Grievances.</p>\n<p id=\"b245-14\">IY. Factual Background</p>\n<p id=\"b245-15\">Shortly after the Committee commenced its investigation into this matter, we learned that Weideman has once again been suspended from the practice of law by the State of Michigan Attorney Review Board. According to the Attorney Review Board\u2019s September 28, 2007 Opinion, Weideman breached his fiduciary obligations, as executor of a California decedent\u2019s estate, by loaning estate funds to himself and his law firm, and made misrepresentations regarding the availability of the funds to a California court, to counsel, and to the Grievance Administrator in Michigan.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> As a result, Weideman was suspended from the practice of law for four years commencing on October 27, 2007.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b245-16\">Additionally, Weideman appears .never to have been admitted to the Court\u2019s bar. According to the Referral Order, a \u201cCarl M. Weideman\u201d was admitted to the Court\u2019s bar in 1988, but the listing does not include \u201cIII\u201d after the surname. The Committee contacted the Michigan State Bar, where Weideman\u2019s office is located, and learned that Carl M. Weideman, III, was not admitted to the Michigan bar until November 1992.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Therefore, Weideman</p>\n<p id=\"b246-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"222\">*222</page-number>appears not to be the \u201cCarl M. Weideman\u201d that is admitted to the Second Circuit\u2019s bar. Nevertheless, he has appeared repeatedly before the Court, including in <em>Gashaj v. Gonzales, </em>07-0438-ag; <em>Ndoci v. Gonzales, </em>06-3755-ag; <em>Zefi v. Ashcroft, </em>05-0191-ag; <em>Urita v. Gonzales, </em>02-4553-ag; <em>Gorvokovic v. Ashcroft, </em>03-4023-ag; and <em>Paluca v. Ashcroft, </em>03-4863-ag.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b246-5\">V. Legal Standard</p>\n<p id=\"A2V\">Under the Rules of this Committee,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b246-6\">An attorney may be subject to discipline or other corrective measures for any act or omission that violates the rules of professional conduct or responsibility of the state or other jurisdiction where the attorney maintains his or her principal office, or the rules of professional conduct of any other state or jurisdiction governing the attorney\u2019s conduct. An attorney may also be subject to discipline or other corrective measures for any failure to comply with a Federal Rule of Appellate Procedure, a Local Rule of the Court, an order or other instruction of the Court, or a rule of professional conduct or responsibility of the Court, or any other conduct unbecoming a member of the bar.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b246-7\">Rules of the Committee on Admissions and Grievances, Rule 4.</p>\n<p id=\"b246-8\">\u201cA court of appeals may discipline an attorney who practices before it for conduct unbecoming a member of the bar or for failure to comply with any court rule.\u201d Fed.

The Michigan Suspension</p>\n<p id=\"b246-15\">Pursuant to Rule 46 of the Federal Rules of Appellate Procedure, a member of a circuit court\u2019s bar is subject to suspension if the member has been suspended in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"223\">*223</page-number>any other court after the member is given an opportunity to show good cause why he should not be suspended. Fed. R.App. P. 46(b)(1)(A) &amp; (2). According to the Second Circuit\u2019s Local Rule 46:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b247-6\">In all cases in which an order disbarring an attorney or suspending the attorney from practice (whether or not on consent) has been entered in any other court of record, federal or state, and a certified copy thereof has been filed in this court, the clerk shall enter an order for the court, to become effective twenty-four days after the date of service upon the attorney unless sooner modified or stayed, disbarring the attorney or suspending the attorney from practice in this court upon terms and conditions comparable to those set forth by the other court of record.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b247-7\">Local Rule 46(f)(1). The attorney may move the Court for a modification or revocation of the order within twenty days of its service. Local Rule 46(f)(2).</p>\n<p id=\"b247-8\">Federal courts conduct only a \u201climited review\u201d before imposing reciprocal discipline. <em>Selling v. Radford, </em>243 U.S. 46, 50-51, 37 S.Ct. 377, 61 L.Ed. 585 (1917). Reciprocal discipline will not be imposed only if there is \u201c(1) absence of due process in the state procedure, (2) substantial infirmity in the proof of lack of private and professional character, or (3) \u2018some other grave reason\u2019 sufficient to indicate that reciprocal disbarment was inconsistent with \u2018principles of right and justice.\u2019 \u201d <em>In re Tidwell, </em>295 F.3d 331, 334 (2d Cir.2002) (quoting <em>Selling, </em>243 U.S. at 51, 37 S.Ct. 377).</p>\n<p id=\"b247-9\">Weideman has been suspended from the practice of law for four years in Michigan. If he were a member of the Court\u2019s bar, this suspension would trigger a reciprocal suspension. As set forth below, however, Weideman is not a member of the Court\u2019s bar.</p>\n<p id=\"b247-11\">B. Appearances Before the Court Without Being Admitted to the Court\u2019s Bar</p>\n<p id=\"b247-12\">Local Rule 46(d) provides in relevant part: \u201cCounsel of record for all parties must be admitted to practice before this court. Oral argument may be presented only by attorneys admitted to practice before this court.\u201d Weideman has repeatedly violated this rule as set forth above.</p>\n<p id=\"b247-13\">VII. Aggravating Factors</p>\n<p id=\"b247-14\">In recommending discipline, the Committee has considered several aggravating factors. They include (1) Weideman\u2019s pri- or disciplinary offenses; (2) a pattern of misconduct; and (3) his multiple offenses. ABA Standards \u00a7 9.22(a), (c), <em>&amp; </em>(d). The Committee also considers Weideman\u2019s failure to cooperate with the Committee\u2019s investigation to be an aggravating factor, as well as an independent basis for discipline. ABA Standards \u00a7 9.22(e); <em>cf Committee on Grievances of the U.S. Dist. Court for Eastern Dist. of New York v. Feinman, </em>239 F.3d 498 (2d Cir.2001) (affirming discipline imposed in part for failure to cooperate with district court\u2019s disciplinary proceeding).</p>\n<p id=\"b247-15\">The Committee is not aware of any mitigating factors.</p>\n<p id=\"b247-16\">VIII. Recommendation</p>\n<p id=\"b247-17\">Weideman\u2019s conduct clearly warrants discipline. The fact that Weideman is not admitted to the Court\u2019s bar should not stop the Court from giving reciprocal effect to Weideman\u2019s Michigan suspension. In light of that suspension and the reasons for which it was imposed, Weideman\u2019s repeated violations of Local Rule 46(d), his failure to cooperate with the Committee\u2019s investigation, and the presence of several aggravating factors, Weideman should not be permitted to seek admission to the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"224\">*224</page-number>Court\u2019s bar until the expiration of two years after the conclusion of his suspension from the practice of law in Michigan, assuming he has successfully completed all other conditions of his Michigan suspension, nor be permitted to practice before the Court under any circumstances until he successfully seeks admission to the Court\u2019s bar.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"AUG\">Respectfully Submitted,</p>\n<p id=\"b248-5\">/s/</p>\n<p id=\"b248-6\">Member of the Committee</p>\n<p id=\"AW0\">September 19, 2008</p>\n<p id=\"b248-7\">APPENDIX 3</p>\n<p id=\"b248-8\">\n<em>Relevant documents \u00f1-om Michigan attorney discipline authorities</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b248-9\">STATE OF MICHIGAN</p>\n<p id=\"AiR\">Attorney Discipline Board</p>\n<p id=\"A2M\">GRIEVANCE ADMINISTRATOR, Attorney Grievance Commission, Petitioner/Appellant/Cross-Appellee, v CARL M.

Golden, for the Respondent/Appellee/Cross-Appellant</p>\n<p id=\"b250-5\">\n<em>BOARD OPINION</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b250-6\">The hearing panel found that respondent breached his fiduciary obligations, as executor of a California decedent\u2019s estate, in loaning the estate funds to himself and/or his firm to finance litigation and pay personal debts, and made misrepresentations regarding the availability of the funds to the California court, to counsel, and to the Grievance Administrator. The panel imposed a suspension of 90 days. The Grievance Administrator filed a petition for review arguing that the panel erred in failing to find that respondent violated the criminal law of California, and in failing to impose greater discipline in light of respondent\u2019s mishandling of estate funds and his misrepresentations. Respondent filed a cross-petition arguing that the panel had no jurisdiction to consider respondent\u2019s conduct as a California fiduciary, or to determine whether his conduct violated California law, and that the panel erred in concluding respondent lied to others about the amount of estate assets in respondent\u2019s trust account. We affirm the panel\u2019s findings of misconduct and modify the order of discipline to require a suspension of four years.</p>\n<p id=\"b250-7\">I. Factual Background.</p>\n<p id=\"b250-8\">Robert H. Weideman lived and died in California. Respondent, a Michigan lawyer, practiced law with his father, who was the first cousin of the decedent. Respondent was appointed executor of the estate in February, 2001. The amended formal complaint charged respondent with various misconduct stemming from respondent\u2019s \u201cloan\u201d of estate funds to himself as a shareholder of Weideman &amp; Weideman, P.C.</p>\n<p id=\"b250-10\">We will set forth in some detail the chronology of respondent\u2019s receipt of the estate funds, his use of the funds, the delay in distributing assets to beneficiaries, misrepresentations to the California court and counsel, a misleading response to the Request for Investigation, and, ultimately, payment of estate proceeds to the most assertive beneficiaries who had retained counsel. This payment was made only after respondent received funds from the settlement of an unrelated matter handled by his firm.</p>\n<p id=\"b250-11\">On June 30, 2001, respondent\u2019s IOLTA account had a balance of $10,927.88. On or about July 2, 2001, respondent received $264,905.20 on behalf of the Weideman estate, which he deposited into his IOLTA account contrary to the requirements of the California Probate Code. During July, 2001, varying amounts were withdrawn and paid to Weideman and Weideman PC, and $25,000 was transferred to the Savings Bank of Albania to repay a personal loan made to respondent by his brother-in-law. As of July 31, 2001, the balance in respondent\u2019s IOLTA account was $224,920.08.</p>\n<p id=\"b250-13\">Respondent is not a California attorney. He retained California counsel to assist in probating the estate. In August, 2001, respondent\u2019s counsel wrote the first of several letters requesting accounting information from respondent. On March 18, 2002, counsel filed a motion for leave to withdraw as attorneys for the executor reciting respondent\u2019s failure to answer these letters. The motion further stated that a final certified letter was sent January 25, 2002, that respondent\u2019s father replied on February 7, 2002 \u201cindicating that the Executor was ready to submit the accounting information,\u201d and that as of March 18, 2002, the date the motion was filed, no <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"227\">*227</page-number>such information had been received by counsel.</p>\n<p id=\"b251-5\">Finally, on September 12, 2002, respondent filed, through counsel, a First and Final Account and Report of Executor, Petition for Approval cf Accounts, etc. The Account, signed by respondent under the penalty of perjury, showed cash on hand in the amount of $258,888.28. On that day, September 12, 2002, the balance in respondent\u2019s IOLTA account was $171,714.01.</p>\n<p id=\"b251-6\">In February, 2003, respondent\u2019s counsel renewed his motion to withdraw explaining that respondent now refused to sign a supplemental accounting. Respondent filed, in pro per, objections to his counsel\u2019s fee requests and a request that he be allowed to distribute only half of the estate\u2019s cash to beneficiaries. On that day, May 5, 2003, respondent\u2019s IOLTA account had a balance of $147,202.78.</p>\n<p id=\"b251-7\">On May 7, 2003, the California court issued an Order Settling the First and Final Account, etc., which recited that the \u201ctotal value of the property on hand is $266,609.48, of which $258,888.23 is cash.\u201d Respondent was directed to distribute the decedent\u2019s entire residuary estate. Respondent did not do so. On December 4, 2003, the surety company filed petition requiring various relief including deposit into court of estate funds. On January 6, 2004, various beneficiaries represented by California attorney James Morris filed an application for order to show cause regarding respondent\u2019s failure to obey the court\u2019s order authorizing final distribution. Attorney Morris also filed a Request for Investigation reciting the history of respondent\u2019s refusal to distribute the estate to beneficiaries and stating Morris\u2019s suspicion that respondent may have commingled and misappropriated estate funds. The Request for Investigation was received by the Attorney Grievance Commission on February 2, 2004.</p>\n<p id=\"b251-11\">On March 29, 2004, respondent deposited a check for $269,292.03 into his IOLTA account which check was from the settlement of an unrelated lawsuit in which respondent represented one Harold Kowal. On or about April 30, 2004, respondent issued a check to James Morris, attorney for several beneficiaries, in the sum of $191,552.44 for distribution to his clients.</p>\n<p id=\"b251-12\">Respondent\u2019s answer to the Request for Investigation does not respond to the allegations of misappropriation and attaches an account certification letter from Comerica dated April 5, 2004, and showing that as of April 2, 2004, there was $423,324.74 in the Weideman and Weideman PC IOLTA.</p>\n<p id=\"b251-13\">II. Misconduct Found By The Hearing Panel.</p>\n<p id=\"b251-14\">During an investigatory statement under oath at the offices of the Attorney Grievance Commission on January 19, 2005, respondent produced a \u201cLine of Credit Agreement\u201d reciting that \u201c[respondent] is desirous of financing\u201d the Kowall litigation in Oakland Circuit Court, and that the estate \u201chas money available for which it would be preferable to earn interest.\u201d The document provides that \u201cfor the duration of [the] case\u201d the estate shall make funds available to respondent \u201cas he shall deem appropriate for the prosecution of [the case].\u201d Interest at <em>7% </em>per annum is provided and respondent signed as executor and again as the president of Weideman and Weideman, P.C. The only beneficiary, indeed the only person, respondent told about the loan was his father. At the time, respondent\u2019s father was engaged in the practice of law with him. As we have set forth above, respondent did not keep the estate funds in a separate account and preserve them, but instead placed them in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"228\">*228</page-number>the Weideman and Weideman P.C. IOLTA account and used the funds to pay business and personal expenses.</p>\n<p id=\"b252-4\">The hearing panel concluded that respondent violated MRPC 3.3(a)(1), (2), and (4)<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> as charged in Count One of the complaint:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b252-5\">[R]espondent represented to the probate court that he had cash on hand belonging to the estate in the amount of $258,888.23. Respondent knew at the time that he made the representation to the California probate court that he did not have cash on hand in this amount. As a result, by making this representation and failing to inform the California probate court of the deposit of the funds in his law firm\u2019s IOLTA and subsequent loan to himself, respondent misrepresented the amount of cash on hand belonging to the estate. [HP Report, p 7.].</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b252-6\">The panel also found, with respect to Count Two, that \u201crespondent did intentionally make false, misleading and deceptive statements to attorneys Allard and Gibson\u201d when he \u201crepresented to these attorneys, in conjunction with the administration of the probate estate, that these funds were in cash and were available for distribution.\u201d In reality, the panel found, and respondent admitted, that he had \u201cloaned those funds to himself,\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b252-7\">Count Three charged that respondent failed \u201cto fully and fairly disclose all facts and circumstances pertaining to the alleged misconduct in answer to [the] request for investigation\u201d filed by California attorney James Morris by engaging in \u201cfalse, misleading and deceptive behavior in attaching the April, 2004 account certification, and failure to disclose that $269,292.03 did not belong to [the] estate but were settlement proceeds from a separate lawsuit\u201d (HP Report, p 8). The panel found misconduct here as well, specifically that the certification</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b252-12\">was submitted by respondent for the purpose of misleading and deceiving the Grievance Administrator into believing that the law firm\u2019s IOLTA account had sufficient funds to reimburse the probate estate for the funds deposited into the IOLTA. In this regard, respondent failed to respond to the specific question as to the balance in the IOLTA at an earlier time because to do so would have revealed that the IOLTA had insufficient funds to reimburse the probate estate for the funds deposited into the IOLTA. [HP Report, p 9.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b252-13\">The funds from the settlement of the Kowal litigation (which had yet to be disbursed to clients and those to whom costs were owed) amounted to $269,292.03. Subtracting that from $423,324.74 (the amount shown on the certification), leaves $154,032.71. The estate funds, had they not been invaded by respondent, would have totaled $258,888.23. Thus, respondent\u2019s account was in deficit by at least $104,855.52 as of the date of his answer to the request for investigation in April, 2004. The panel found that the conduct established under Count Three was in violation of MCR 9.104(A)(1)\u2014(4) and MRPC 8.1(a)(1) and (2) and 8.4(a)-(c).</p>\n<p id=\"b253-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"229\">*229</page-number>The hearing panel next found that respondent committed misconduct alleged in Count Four by:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b253-5\">(a) placing estate funds in his law firm\u2019s IOLTA and not in a bank account payable in United States funds, (b) commingling estate funds with professional funds in his law firm\u2019s IOLTA, (c) using estate funds for personal and professional purposes, and (d) making a loan to himself with estate funds. [HP Report, p 9.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b253-6\">The panel determined that this conduct violated various provisions of the California Probate Code constituted \u201cself dealing,\u201d and that \u201crespondent violated his fiduciary obligations to the estate,\u201d all in violation of MCR 9.104(A)(1)\u2014(4) and MRPC 8.4(a)-(c) as alleged in the formal complaint.</p>\n<p id=\"b253-7\">In sum, the panel expressly declined to find that respondent commingled estate funds with his own as alleged in Count One. Nor did the panel find a violation of former MRPC 1.15(a)-(c), as alleged in Count Five, which asserted that a deficiency in respondent\u2019s trust account existed following the deposit of the estate funds and that commingling and misappropriation were the result. However, the panel did find that respondent violated his fiduciary duties with respect to the handling of the estate funds as described more fully above. The Administrator does not seek review of the panel\u2019s factual findings. Respondent\u2019s arguments as to the panel\u2019s factfinding simply ask us to weigh the evidence anew and amend the panel\u2019s credibility determinations. These arguments are rejected and will not be discussed further. <em>Grievance Administrator v. Carrie L.P. Gray, </em>93-250-GA (ADB 1996) (\u201cit is not the Board\u2019s function to substitute its own judgment for that of the panels\u2019 or to offer a de novo analysis of the evidence\u201d), Iv den 453 Mich. 1216 (1996).</p>\n<p id=\"b253-8\">III. Panel Rulings Regarding Violation of California Probate and Criminal Law.</p>\n<p id=\"b253-9\">The hearing panel rejected respondent\u2019s arguments that the Michigan Rules of Professional Conduct do not apply to his conduct while acting as a California executor and that the panel had no authority to determine whether respondent violated California law. The panel concluded that respondent\u2019s acts violated the California Probate Code, but was \u201cnot persuaded that the Grievance Administrator has met its burden of proof that respondent violated either California or Michigan criminal law.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b253-10\">On review, respondent offers cursory attacks on the panel\u2019s jurisdiction. A eonclusory recitation of alleged error is insufficient to trigger this Board\u2019s review. <em>See Grievance Administrator v. Frederick A. Potman, </em>93-47-GA; 94-157-GA (ADB 1997), citing <em>Mitcham v. City of Detroit, </em>355 Mich. 182, 203, 94 N.W.2d 388 (1959), and <em>Taunt v. Moegle, </em>344 Mich. 683, 686-687, 75 N.W.2d 48 (1956). While we consider respondent\u2019s arguments abandoned, and without exception baseless, we will briefly discuss them.</p>\n<p id=\"b253-11\">First, respondent argues:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b253-12\">There is no authority anywhere in the Michigan Court Rules, statutes or case law which gives the Michigan Grievance Administrator jurisdiction to complain of, and the Attorney Discipline Board to hear, violations of other states [sic] criminal or probate code in court proceedings taking place in that other state. In fact the only mention of violations which take place in other states in the jurisdiction granting sections of the Michigan Court Rules is to be found at MCR 9.104(B):</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b253-13\">\u201cProof of an adjudication of misconduct in a disciplinary proceeding by <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"230\">*230</page-number>another state or a United States court is conclusive proof of misconduct in a disciplinary proceeding \u25a0 in Michigan ...\u201d [Respondents\u2019 Brief on Appeal, pp 7-8.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b254-4\">This argument completely ignores MCR 9.104(A)(5) in which the Michigan Supreme Court plainly defined misconduct to include \u201cconduct that violates a criminal law of <em>a state </em>or of the United States\u201d (emphasis added). The panel\u2019s ruling <em>from the </em>bench<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> and its written Report are firmly and correctly predicated on MCR 9.104(A)(5). Respondent\u2019s argument also disregards the plain language of MRPC 8.4(c) stating that it is misconduct to \u201cengage in ... violation of the criminal law....\u201d Notwithstanding respondent\u2019s argument, this Board and its panels have in fact found misconduct based on violation of the criminal law of other states,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> as well as upon violation of the probate law of another state.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> This is hardly remarkable; other jurisdictions follow a similar approach. See, e.g., <em>In re Slattery, </em>767 A.2d 203 (D.CApp., 2001) (\u201cIn construing the phrase \u2018criminal act\u2019 for purposes of Rule 8.4(b), this court may properly look to the law of any jurisdiction that could have prosecuted the respondent for the misconduct,\u201d and conviction is not necessary to pursue disciplinary charges.)</p>\n<p id=\"b254-5\">Also, respondent argues that either our Rules of Professional Conduct or the authority of the Board and panels cannot have \u201cextraterritorial application.\u201d Given the utter lack of support advanced for such an argument, as well as the commentary of noted authorities in this area to the contrary, we find respondent\u2019s argument to be groundless:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b254-9\">A state disciplinary authority has, in general, the power to discipline a person admitted to the bar in that jurisdiction even though the acts complained of occurred outside the jurisdiction....</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b254-10\">The rationale for the extraterritorial application of ethics rules is easy to understand. The purpose of lawyer discipline is not to punish (although the lawyer may be deprived of her livelihood) but rather to \u201cseek to determine the fitness of an officer of the court to continue in that capacity and to protect the courts and the public from the official ministrations of persons unfit to practice.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b254-11\">Given this rationale, if the lawyer engages in improper conduct\u2014even if she engages in the conduct while not acting as a lawyer (e.g., lying to secure a real estate license), and even if the improper conduct occurs outside of the jurisdiction of Stat A, that conduct still reflects on the ability of that lawyer to practice in State A. The lawyer\u2019s admission to practice in State A (even thought State A is not the site of her improper act) gives <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"231\">*231</page-number>State A the jurisdiction to discipline the lawyer. [Ronald D. Rotunda &amp; John S. Dzienkowski, <em>Legal Ethics: The Lawyer\u2019s Deskbook on Professional Responsibility </em>2007-2008, \u00a7 8.5-1, pp 1213-1214. Footnotes omitted.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b255-5\">Moreover, to the extent it even makes sense to try to pin down the situs of respondent\u2019s acts and omissions, the misconduct clearly took place in Michigan. Michigan is where the Weideman and Weideman, P.C. IOLTA account was located. Some misrepresentations may have been repeated in California, but they originated here.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Finally, the misleading conduct during the AGC investigation clearly took place in Michigan. Respondent\u2019s arguments in this regard, and the argument that this Board and the panel cannot act where a California court has not acted, are specious.</p>\n<p id=\"b255-6\">The Administrator argues that the hearing panel\u2019s findings that respondent secretly loaned estate funds in violation of the California Probate Code should also have resulted in a finding that respondent violated Section 506 of the California Penal Code.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> Citing the Code<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> and caselaw, the Administrator contends that the intent to restore funds is not a defense to a charge under this section. This proposition appears to be correct. Indeed, additional cases not cited provide support for the argument that a California criminal law violation might be established if fraudulent intent within the meaning of that state\u2019s jurisprudence could be established. For example, in <em>People v. Talbot, </em>220 Cal. 3, 28 P.2d 1057 (1934), the California Supreme Court stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b255-11\">The element of felonious intent in every contested criminal case must necessarily be determined from the facts and circumstances of the case.... <em>\u201cAn officer or agent of a corporation cannot take money of the corporation which is entrusted to him, or which comes into his possession by virttie of his office or agency, and use it even temporarily for his personal benefit and avoid criminal responsibility by calling it a loan. </em>The law calls such a transaction a wrongful conversion, from which a fraudulent intent can be inferred.\u201d [220 Cal. at 15, 28 P.2d 1057; citations and internal quotation marks omitted; emphasis added.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b255-12\">And, in <em>Seavey v. State Bar of California, 4 </em>Cal.2d 73, 47 P.2d 281 (1935), an attorney was convicted under Section 506 of the Penal Code for secretly loaning funds he managed under a power of attorney during liquidation of a partnership. Arguments that he was acting in the best interest of the principals and did not himself profit were unavailing.</p>\n<p id=\"b255-13\">However, we decline to disturb the panel\u2019s determination regarding the alleged violation of the California Penal Code given that the issue of \u201cfraudulent intent\u201d within the meaning of California law was not squarely addressed, and in light of the panel\u2019s unchallenged findings as to respondent\u2019s intent (discussed further in the following section).</p>\n<p id=\"b256-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"232\">*232</page-number>IV. Appropriate Level of Discipline.</p>\n<p id=\"b256-4\">Our Supreme Court has directed the Board and hearing panels to use the American Bar Association (ABA) Standards for Imposing Lawyer Sanctions when determining the appropriate level of discipline for misconduct <em>Grievance Administrator v. Lopatin, </em>462 Mich. 235, 612 N.W.2d 120 (2000). The Court explained that</p>\n<p id=\"b256-5\">The inquiry begins with three questions:</p>\n<p id=\"b256-6\">(1) What ethical duty did the lawyer violate? (A duty to a client, the public, the legal system or the profession?)</p>\n<p id=\"b256-7\">(2) What was the lawyer\u2019s mental state? (Did the lawyer act intentionally, knowingly, or negligently?)</p>\n<p id=\"b256-8\">(3) What was the extent of the actual or potential injury caused by the lawyer\u2019s conduct? (Was there a serious or potentially serious injury?)</p>\n<p id=\"b256-9\"><em>[Lopatin, </em>462 Mich, at 239-240, 612 N.W.2d 120 (quoting ABA Standards, p 5).]</p>\n<p id=\"b256-10\">We set forth the following steps of the analysis under the Standards in <em>Grievance Administrator v. Ralph E. Musilli, </em>No. 98-216-GA (ADB 2000):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b256-11\">Next, the hearing panel examines recommended sanctions based the answers to these questions. <em>Lopatin, </em>462 Mich, at 240, 612 N.W.2d 120; ABA Sanctions, pp 3, 4-5.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b256-12\">Then, aggravating and mitigating factors are considered. <em>Id.</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b256-13\">And, in Michigan, the final step <em>of </em>the process involves a consideration of other factors, if any, which may make the results of the foregoing analytical process inappropriate for some articulated reason. As the Court explained in directing this Board and the panel\u2019s to follow the Standards:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b256-14\">We caution the ADB and hearing panels that our directive to follow the ABA standards is not an instruction to abdicate their responsibility to exercise independent judgment. Where, for articulated reasons, the ADB or a hearing panel determines that the ABA standards do not adequately consider the effects of certain misconduct, do not accurately address the aggravating or mitigating circumstances of a particular case, or do not comport with the precedent of this Court or the ADB, it is incumbent on the ADB or the hearing panel to arrive at, and explain the basis for, a sanction or result that reflects this conclusion. [Lopatin, 462 Mich, at 248 n. 13, 612 N.W.2d 120.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b256-15\">A. Mishandling of Estate Funds.</p>\n<p id=\"b256-16\">This case is somewhat similar to the matter of <em>Grievance Administrator v. Frederick A. Petz, </em>99-102-GA (ADB 2001) (disbarment is the presumptively appropriate discipline for intentional conversion of client funds and should be imposed absent compelling mitigation). Like respondent, Mr. Petz did not intend to permanently deprive the rightful owners of their funds which he \u201cinvested\u201d in his partnership without authorization. However, distinctions between that case and this one include the fact that <em>Petz </em>involved <em>deliberate conversion </em>of client funds, and that a violation of MRPC 1.15 was found by the panel and not contested on review.</p>\n<p id=\"b256-17\">Also relevant is <em>Grievance Administrator v. Ronald P. Derocher, </em>99-98-GA (ADB 2000), appropriately cited for the proposition that the absence of an intent to permanently deprive the rightful owner of his or her funds is no defense to misappropriation. Again, however, <em>Derocher </em>involved a violation of MRPC 1.15.</p>\n<p id=\"b257-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"233\">*233</page-number>Because client funds are not involved, ABA Standard 4.1 is inapplicable to the misconduct here. <em>Grievance Administrator v. Rodney Watts, </em>05-151-GA (ADB 2007). However, the Administrator urged the panel to apply ABA Standard 4.11 and disbar respondent, arguing that the conduct here is analogous to that described in Standard 4.11, which provides: \u201cDisbarment is generally appropriate when a lawyer knowingly converts client property and causes injury or potential injury to a client.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b257-5\">We do not disagree with the tenor of the Administrator\u2019s argument that the intentional misappropriation of funds belonging to a non-client third party should, as a general proposition, be considered to be as serious as the theft of client funds. See, e.g., <em>Watts, supra </em>(comparing ABA Standards with proposed Michigan Standards and concluding \u201cit is untenable to give this respondent a \u2018break\u2019 simply because he stole money belonging to another lawyer rather than money belonging to a client\u201d). However, as we have noted, the hearing panel did not find a violation of MKPC 1.15, misappropriation, embezzlement or theft, and these findings and conclusions are not challenged on review. Rather, the Grievance Administrator\u2019s brief on appeal characterizes this matter as follows, \u201cRespondent loaned estate monies to himself without court approval and with no notice to interested parties in violation of the California Probate Code. Respondent told no one except his father (his law partner) about the loan.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b257-6\">The panel also did not find a violation of criminal law, as we have noted above, and so did not apply ABA Standard 5.11(a) which provides that disbarment is generally appropriate when</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b257-7\">a lawyer engages in serious criminal conduct, a necessary element of which includes intentional interference with the administration of Justice, false swearing, misrepresentation, fraud, extortion, misappropriation, or theft; or the sale, distribution or importation of controlled substances; or the intentional killing of another; or an attempt or conspiracy or solicitation of another to commit any of these offenses[.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b257-11\">On review, the Administrator argues that disbarment would be appropriate under ABA Standard 5.11(a). However, in light of the panel\u2019s determination that the loan did not rise to the level of theft or misappropriation, it does not appear that this Standard is clearly applicable.</p>\n<p id=\"b257-12\">We emphasize, however, that lawyers are bound to act as fiduciaries whenever they handle funds of a client or another. Not infrequently lawyers serve\u2014pursuant to agreement, court order or otherwise\u2014 as executors, personal representatives, trustees, agents or in other such fiduciary capacities. Prior to and after the <em>Lopatin </em>Court\u2019s adoption of the ABA Standards for Imposing Lawyer Sanctions in 2000, discipline for conversion of funds held in such roles has ranged from a suspension requiring reinstatement proceedings to disbarment. See, e.g., <em>Neaton, supra, </em>n. 4 (revocation), <em>Grievance Administrator v. Myles B. Hoffert, </em>99-79-GA (HP Consent 2003) (Panel imposed three years by consent for respondent\u2019s use of trust funds for business entities and personal use while serving as trustee), <em>Grievance Administrator v. William J. Conlin, </em>93-215-GA (HP 1994) (One year suspension where respondent misappropriated $28,000 from an account held in his capacity as a trustee and repaid several months later), <em>Grievance Administrator v. Peter B. Short </em>(HP 1988) (Revocation for mishandling of two estates, which included false accountings, commingling, misappropriation, i.e., \u201cinvesting\u201d funds in his own name allegedly on behalf of the beneficiaries).</p>\n<p id=\"b258-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"234\">*234</page-number>While we defer to the panel\u2019s uncontested findings in this case, we wish to make it very plain that, in general, a secret loan arrangement by a lawyer in violation of fiduciary duties is serious misconduct. Indeed, because \u201cthe likelihood of actual embezzlement is so great, and the policy of professional responsibility in protecting the client from such risks is so strong,\u201d<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> such conduct should, in the future, generally be regarded as tantamount to knowing conversion.</p>\n<p id=\"b258-4\">B. Misrepresentation.</p>\n<p id=\"b258-5\">Count One of the formal complaint alleged that respondent\u2019s \u201cknowing and material misrepresentations to the probate court that he had cash on hand belonging to the estate of $258,888.23, were untrue, and were made in violation of MCR 9.104(A)(l)-(4), MRPC 3.3(a)(1), (2) and (4), and MRPC 8.4(a)-(c).\u201d The hearing panel found that these charges of misconduct were established. Specifically, the panel found that respondent \u201cknew at the time that he made the representation to the California probate court that he did not have cash on hand in this amount.\u201d In light of these allegations and findings regarding respondent\u2019s mental state, the panel correctly applied Standard 6.12 (suspension generally appropriate for submission of knowingly false documents or statements to a court). However, we agree with the Administrator that the discipline should be increased. The misrepresentations in this case were at least as serious as those in <em>Grievance Administrator v. Russell G. Slade, </em>ADB 150-89 (ADB 1991) (three year suspension for respondent\u2019s failure to inform the court and opposing parties of the death of his client, the plaintiff, in pending litigation).</p>\n<p id=\"b258-8\">Our opinion in <em>Slade, supra, </em>is also apposite with respect to the misrepresentation to California counsel in the probate proceedings. We note the panel\u2019s finding that respondent made intentionally false, misleading and deceptive statements to two California attorneys and that Standard 5.11(b) provides that disbarment is the generally appropriate sanction for such conduct when it \u201cseriously adversely reflects on the lawyer\u2019s fitness to practice.\u201d The panel did not make an express finding as to this point. However, the panel did find, in applying other standards, that suspension was appropriate, in part because potential injury was caused by respondent\u2019s conduct. We must also square the allegations in Count Two with those in Count One pertaining to misrepresentation which are essentially similar and were alleged and found to involve a \u201cknowing\u201d rather than intentional state of mind. Finally, as we are directed to do by <em>Lopatin, </em>we consider Michigan precedent, in particular <em>Slade, </em>and we conclude that a lengthy suspension is appropriate.</p>\n<p id=\"b258-9\">We have also considered the aggravating and mitigating factors identified by the panel and the parties. We note respondent\u2019s previous 30-day suspension for neglect and several admonitions for similar conduct. We also acknowledge that respondent made restitution with interest, or, rather, repaid the \u201cloan.\u201d However, respondent\u2019s argument that injury or potential injury was nonexistent because the loan was secured by the \u201cstanding offer of settlement\u201d in the Kowal litigation merits little credence for reasons too obvious to discuss.</p>\n<p id=\"b258-10\">IV. Conclusion.</p>\n<p id=\"b258-11\">Taking into account all of the factors set forth in the ABA Standards and in <em>Lopa</em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"235\">*235</page-number><em>tin, </em>including the nature of the misconduct found by the panel, the proofs and findings as to respondent\u2019s mental state, the degree of harm resulting from respondent\u2019s conduct, aggravating and mitigating factors, and applicable precedent, we conclude that the circumstances of this particular case warrant an increase in discipline to a suspension of four years.</p>\n<p id=\"b259-5\">Board members William P.

Respondent\u2019s conduct is alleged to be in violation of MCR 9.104(A)(4) and Michigan Rules of Professional Conduct 1.1(c), 1.3, 1.4(a), 1.4(b)(a), 1.15(d), 1.16(d), and 8.4(a) and (b). All three counts related to respondent\u2019s representation of three clients in their individual immigration cases.</p>\n<p id=\"b262-7\">The matter was assigned to Tri-County Hearing Panel # 15 and a hearing was scheduled for December 20, 2007 pursuant to MCR 9.115(G). On November 28, 2007, respondent\u2019s default for failure to answer the formal complaint was filed. On December 6, 2007, respondent filed a motion to set aside the default, extend the time to file an answer and enter a stay of proceedings pending the resolution of an application for leave to appeal to the Michigan Supreme Court of a prior disciplinary order. On .December 13, 2007, the panel granted, in part, and denied, in part, respondent\u2019s motion. This panel set aside the default, however, respondent was ordered to file an answer within twenty-one days and an affidavit of facts establishing a meritorious defense. The panel adjourned the hearing but denied a stay of proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b262-9\">On January 2, 2008, respondent filed an answer to the formal complaint. With respect to Count I, related to Gazmend Dervishaj\u2019s immigration matter, respondent admitted that he was retained to file an appeal in the Sixth Circuit Court of Appeals. Respondent admitted that he was required to file the client\u2019s brief on appeal on November 7, 2005. He further admitted that on February 21, 2006, the Court dismissed Dervishaj\u2019s appeal for failure to file a brief on appeal. Respondent denied that between February 21, 2006 and November 28, 2006, he represented to the client that his matter was still pending. Further, respondent admitted that he did not place the $3,000.00 previously paid fee in a client trust account. Respondent also admitted that he did not return unearned fees to Dervishaj.</p>\n<p id=\"b262-10\">As to the charges in Count II, all related to Klodian Yzo\u2019s immigration matter, respondent admitted that in 2004, Yzo paid respondent $1,200.00 to file a motion to reopen his immigration matter. Respondent further admitted that he never filed such a motion. Respondent affirmatively stated that a motion was never filed because Yzo failed, after being requested on three occasions, to provide evidentiary support for his motion to reopen. Respondent admitted that he never placed the $1,200.00 fee in a client trust account. Respondent denied that he failed to return unearned fees to Yzo. Respondent further denied that he made false representations to Yzo that he had filed the motion to reopen.</p>\n<p id=\"b262-11\">The allegations in Count III were substantially similarly to those pled in Counts <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"239\">*239</page-number>I and II, however, they related to Dionis Kasolli\u2019s immigration matter. Respondent admitted that he was paid $2,500.00 in March of 2005, to file an appeal and brief with the Board of Immigration Appeals (BIA) on Kasolli\u2019s behalf. Respondent denied that he failed to file a brief with the BIA and further, that the appeal was dismissed by the BIA for failing to file the brief. He also denied that he failed to notify Kasolli of the dismissal. Respondent admitted that he did not file a motion to reopen the matter after being notified of the dismissal, but explained that he had been contacted by two other attorneys claiming to represent Kasolli during the time in which a motion to reopen could have been filed. Respondent admitted that he did not deposit the $2,500.00 in a client trust account, however, he denied that he failed to return unearned fees and failed to provide the client file to subsequent counsel. Respondent also denied that he told subsequent counsel that the matter was still pending in the Sixth Circuit or that he failed to file the requisite brief.</p>\n<p id=\"b263-5\">On February 7, 2008, petitioner filed a motion to amend the complaint to add a charge that respondent, in violation of the panel\u2019s order, failed to file an affidavit of meritorious defense with his answer to the complaint. An order granting the motion to amend was entered on February 12, 2008.</p>\n<p id=\"b263-6\">The hearing in this matter was held on April 3, 2008. At that time, petitioner moved to reinstate the default against respondent for failure to file an affidavit of meritorious defense, a condition imposed at the time the panel set aside the original default. (Tr 04/03/08, pp 6-7.) The panel denied the motion to reinstate the default in light of respondent\u2019s filing of an answer to the complaint. (Tr 04/03/08, p 12.) Respondent failed to attend the April 3, 2008, hearing. The hearing was briefly adjourned and phone contact was made with respondent three times. Respondent claimed that his notice of hearing indicated that the hearing was set for the following day. Respondent indicated that he would not be attending the hearing which, thereafter, proceeded in his absence. (Tr 04/03/08, pp 9-11.)</p>\n<p id=\"b263-8\">The panel received the testimony of the Grievance Administrator\u2019s witness, Gazmend Dervishaj (Count I), who testified that in March of 2005, he hired and paid respondent $3,000.00 to file an appeal on his behalf. (Tr 04/03/08, p 19.) He had been in the country as a foreign exchange student and, after this status expired, he attempted to seek political asylum. (Tr 04/03/08, p 20.) Dervishaj frequently called respondent about his case. Respondent repeatedly told him to \u201csit tight\u201d and that he would get a call as soon as respondent heard something. (Tr 04/03/080000, p 21.) When Dervishaj became concerned about his appeal, he contacted, Namir Daman, another immigration attorney, in November of 2006. (Tr 04/03/08, pp21, 23, 32.) Daman testified that he retrieved the docket sheet from PACER, the online public access service that allows users to obtain docket information. (Tr 04/03/08, p 32. ) In Daman\u2019s opinion, most immigration attorneys would know how to use this service. (Tr 04/03/08, p 40.)</p>\n<p id=\"b263-10\">From the docket sheet, Daman discovered that Dervishaj\u2019s appeal had been dismissed on February 21, 2006, for failure to file the brief on appeal. (Tr 04/03/08, p 33. ) With the documentation in hand, Dervishaj called respondent on a speaker phone to inquire into the status of his case. (Tr 04/03/08, p 21-22.) Dervishaj and Daman both heard respondent claim that the case was still pending in the Court of Appeals. (Tr 04/03/08, pp 21, 36.) Dervishaj testified that respondent had never <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"240\">*240</page-number>returned any money to him but he admitted that he had not requested the return of money. (Tr 04/03/08, pp 23, 26.) When Dervishaj confronted respondent about the dismissal of his case, respondent shook his head and said, \u201cI know, I know.\u201d Then he said, \u2018We\u2019ll take care of it.\u201d (Tr 04/03/08, pp 28-29.)</p>\n<p id=\"b264-4\">Daman testified that by filing a <em>Lozada </em>motion, arguing ineffective assistance of counsel, he was able to get Dervishaj\u2019s appeal reinstated. (Tr 04/03/08, pp 37-38, 48.) However, during respondent\u2019s representation, when the appeal was dismissed in February of 2006, Dervishaj was deemed a fugitive. He could have been picked up, detained and deported at any time. (Tr 04/03/08, pp 33-34.)</p>\n<p id=\"b264-5\">After Dervishaj and Daman testified, attorney Bette Jean Lahti testified regarding respondent\u2019s representation of Dionis Kasolli (Count III). Kasolli would not be testifying as he had been picked up by the Immigration Service and was currently being held in a detention facility. (Tr 04/03/08, p 53.) Lahti\u2019s representation of Kasolli began on September 25, 2006 after he was referred to her by attorney James Elsman. Lahti spoke with respondent on that day and he admitted that Kasolli\u2019s appeal had been dismissed for failure to file a brief which he had been paid to prepare. (Tr 04/03/08, pp 58-59.) Later, Lahti learned that the BIA had issued its decision on June 26, 2006, dismissing Kasolli\u2019s appeal for failing to file a brief on appeal. (Exhibit 8.) Respondent misled her and other attorneys to believe that the dismissal was older than that. In Lahti\u2019s opinion, had respondent been forthcoming to her and other attorneys, a motion to reopen could have been filed in a timely manner. (Tr 04/03/08, p 65.) According to Lahti, respondent knew that the appeal was in jeopardy because in August of 2006, he received a \u201cbag and baggage\u201d letter, which notified him that because of the dismissal, Kasolli was at risk of being deported. (Tr 04/03/08, pp 70-71.) Lahti also explained that respondent filed a timely appeal, however, the brief that was due on March 14, 2006, was never filed. (Tr 04/03/08, pp 75-77.) Lahti made several attempts to get all or part of Kasolli\u2019s file from respondent. Respondent failed to cooperate. (Tr 04/03/08, pp 55, 59.)</p>\n<p id=\"b264-7\">After Lahti\u2019s testimony, the Grievance Administrator offered the testimony of attorney Zeina Makki in support of the allegations made in Count II of the complaint relative to respondent\u2019s representation of Klodian Yzo. Yzo would not be available to testify on his own behalf as he had been deported to Albania. (Tr 04/03/08, p 91.) Makki assisted attorney Nabih Ayad in the subsequent representation of Yzo when the client came to them in April of 2007. (Tr 04/03/08, pp 90-91, 99.) At that time, Yzo was \u201cout of status,\u201d which meant that because he had no current visa and no appeal was pending, he was deportable. (Tr 04/03/08, p 102.) Makki picked up Yzo\u2019s file from respondent. She was specifically looking for a videotape, original birth certificate and a news article provided to respondent by Yzo in 2004, which would be the factual support for the motion to reopen on the grounds of changed country conditions. (Tr 04/03/08, pp 95-96, 107.) These items were not in the file and respondent claimed that he had misplaced them during a move. (Tr 04/03/08, p 96.) She eventually got the things from respondent.</p>\n<p id=\"b264-8\">When Makki reviewed the materials provided, she found a document dated August 15, 2004 (Exh. 5), which purported to be a cover letter to the BIA representing that a motion to reopen was accompanying the letter for filing. (Tr 04/03/08, p 103.) When Makki contacted the BIA to ascertain whether respondent had filed a motion <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"241\">*241</page-number>to reopen the case as he was hired to do, she was informed that no motion had been filed. (Tr 04/03/08, p 98.) Although respondent claimed in his answer that he did not file a motion to reopen because Yzo had not provided requested evidentiary materials, Makki felt that there was enough information in the file eventually provided to her by respondent, to support the filing of such a motion. (Tr 04/03/08, p 104.)</p>\n<p id=\"b265-5\">Although respondent chose not to attend the hearing, two of his sworn statements taken prior to the filing of the complaint were admitted into evidence. (Exhibits 3 and 3A.) On June 13, 2007, respondent testified that Dervishaj paid him $3000.00 in March of 2005. (Exh. 3, pp 4-5.) Respondent filed a petition for review and an extension of time because an administrative order was late in coming. (Exh. 3, p 4.) Respondent admitted that after being granted one extension, the brief in Dervishaj\u2019s case was due on November 7, 2005. Respondent admitted that he never filed a brief but explained that the client had decided to abandon the appeal and attempt to \u201cadjust his status\u201d through an alternative avenue. (Exh. 3, p 6.) When confronted with the inconsistency between this position and the position respondent took in response to the investigation (that Dervishaj had a new lawyer), respondent back tracked and said that it was a \u201cpresumption on his part\u201d that Dervishaj was going to seek an alternative route rather than pursue the appeal. (Exh. 3, p 7.) Respondent then testified that Dervishaj told him in June of 2005 that he was hiring another attorney; at that point, respondent decided to do nothing else on the file. (Exh. 3, pp 7-8.)</p>\n<p id=\"b265-6\">Respondent did not send the client a refund of his fee because the brief he was hired to prepare was \u201cabout 90 percent done.\u201d Respondent felt that he had earned the entire $3000.00. (Exh. 3, p 8.) Respondent did not recall speaking to Dervishaj by telephone on November 28, 2006 and he never told Dervishaj that the case was still pending after it had been dismissed. (Exh. 3, p 10.) Respondent .stated in his response to the request for investigation, that because he now knew that Dervishaj was unhappy, he had filed a motion to open the immigration matter in an attempt to get the case reinstated. (Exh. 3, p 11.) When asked why the court\u2019s docket sheet did not reflect the filing of such a motion, respondent explained that it is possible that the court rejected his attempt to file because he was no longer the attorney of record. (Exh. 3, p 13.) Respondent then stated that the UPS receipt he provided to the GA was proof that he had attempted to file the brief. However, when confronted with date discrepancies, respondent admitted that the UPS receipt he sent the GA was probably for another case. (Exh. 3, p 16.)</p>\n<p id=\"b265-8\">With respect to Yzo\u2019s matter, respondent admitted that Yzo paid him $1,200.00 to file a motion. (Exh. 3, p 23.) Respondent never filed the motion because Yzo failed to provide the requested materials that would form the basts of a motion to reopen. (Exh. 3, pp 23-24.) Respondent did some preparation work in Yzo\u2019s file and he considered some of the $1200.00 unearned fees but he did not know how much as he had not prepared a statement. By a letter dated April 30, 2007, respondent knew that Yzo had retained new counsel. (Exh. 3, p 27.) Respondent did not return unearned fees to Yzo because he learned that Yzo had been arrested and he assumed that if Yzo wanted a refund of fees, his new attorney would tell respondent where to find Yzo. The attorney never did this. (Exh. 3, pp 26-27.) Respondent admitted that the $1,200.00 was not in a trust account. He further stated that he would prepare a bill and whatever <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"242\">*242</page-number>balance was owed to Yzo he would pay it. (Exh. 3, p 28.) Respondent admitted that the $1,200.00 was the client\u2019s money until he earned it and that client\u2019s money should be in a trust account. (Exh. 3, p 28.) Although Yzo stated in his request for investigation that he was told by respondent that the motion to reopen had been filed, respondent denied having made this representation to the client. (Exh. 3, p 31.)</p>\n<p id=\"b266-4\">When the taking of respondent\u2019s sworn statement resumed on September 4, 2007, respondent once again admitted that he still had not returned unearned fees to Yzo, that he did not place any of the unearned fees in a trust account, and he did not know where Yzo was to return the money. (Exh. 3A, pp 41-44.) With respect to client Kasolli\u2019s immigration matter, respondent admitted that the client paid him $2,500 to file and appeal with the BIA. (Exh. 3A, p 50.) He filed an appearance and a notice of appeal. (Exh. 3A, p 31.) Respondent received the briefing schedule from the court which provided that the brief was due on March 14, 2006. (Exh. 3A, p 52.) Respondent would know that the court received the brief because he would eventually receive a decision. (Exh. 3A, p 52.) Respondent claimed that he filed a brief and sent a copy to opposing counsel on March 8, 2006. (Exh. 3A, pp 52-53.) Respondent looked through his file and confirmed that he had not received a decision in the Kasolli matter. (Exh. 3A, p 53.) Respondent admitted that a year and a half after filing the brief in the BIA, he received a call from Elsman saying that he had been retained by Kasolli and that the client was going to take a different \u201ctactic.\u201d (Exh. 3A, 55.) A few days latter, respondent was contacted by Kasolli\u2019s new attorney, Lahti. (Exh. 3A, pp 53-55.) Lahti told respondent that the case had been dismissed. (Exh. 3A, p 54.) Respondent denied that he told Lahti that he had failed to file a brief. (Exh. 3A, p 54.) Respondent did not recall if Kasolli\u2019s $2,500.00 was ever placed into a trust account. (Exh. 3A, p 62.) Further, respondent did not feel that it was necessary to check on the filing of Kasolli\u2019s brief because sending and receiving a brief was so routine. (Exh. 3A, p 66.)</p>\n<p id=\"b266-6\">At the conclusion of the testimony, the panel considered petitioner\u2019s closing argument, then took a recess and returned with a finding of misconduct. Thereafter, the sanction phase began with counsel for the Grievance Administrator introducing evidence of six admonitions and two suspensions respondent had previously received (exhibits 9 and 9A). This prior misconduct is summarized below. After precluding proffered evidence of other uncharged acts of alleged misconduct, the panel directed counsel for the Grievance Administrator to file a brief addressing the issues of misconduct and discipline. Counsel for the Grievance Administrator was given twenty-one days after the preparation of the hearing transcript to file a brief. By letter dated April 10, 2008, the panel directed that the Administrator\u2019s brief would be due on May 1, 2008 and that the respondent would be entitled to file a brief on or before May 15, 2008.</p>\n<p id=\"b266-7\">On May 1, 2008, counsel for the Grievance Administrator filed the requested brief. In addition to recapping the evidence that was presented at the hearing, counsel conceded that with respect to the allegations of misconduct in the representation of Yzo, the evidence did not prove that respondent failed to keep the client reasonably informed, failed to explain a matter to the client, and engaged in conduct involving, dishonesty, fraud, deceit and misrepresentation. (First Amended Formal Complaint, \u00b6\u00b6 27(e), (f) and (g).) Counsel further conceded that evidence was not presented to establish that respon<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"243\">*243</page-number>dent knowingly made a false statement of material fact to a third person (First Amended Formal Complaint, \u00b6 45(g)). Counsel then argued for revocation of respondent\u2019s license to practice law. Respondent has not filed a response to the Grievance Administrator\u2019s brief as of the date of this report.</p>\n<p id=\"b267-5\">IV. <em>FINDINGS AND CONCLUSIONS REGARDING MISCONDUCT</em></p>\n<p id=\"b267-6\">As to Count I of the Amended Formal Complaint, we find that the allegations of misconduct were proven. Respondent neglected a legal matter entrusted to him when he failed to file the brief to perfect Dervishaj\u2019s immigration appeal. Thereafter, not only did respondent fail to keep the client reasonably informed, he made material misrepresentations to Dervishaj regarding the status of the action. Further, we conclude that respondent failed to preserve the client\u2019s funds and failed to return unearned fees, which was essentially the entire amount paid by the client. We reject respondent\u2019s claim that he earned the $3,000.00 fee paid because he completed ninety percent of the brief on appeal. His testimony to this effect in his sworn statement simply lacks credibility. We reach this conclusion based, in part, upon the multiple and inconsistent explanations respondent gave for why he did not file the brief on appeal. Respondent\u2019s explanations ranged from his mere belief that the client had decided to change approaches to his legal matter to stating that Dervishaj had hired new counsel. Respondent\u2019s conduct constituted a violation of MRPC 1.1(c), 1.3, 1.4(a) and (b), 1.15(d), 1.16(d), 8.4(a) and 8.4(b) and MCR 9.104(A)(4).</p>\n<p id=\"b267-7\">We find that the allegations of misconduct In Count II, with respect to respondent\u2019s representation of Yzo, were similarly proven. Respondent was retained to file a motion to reopen Klodian Yzo\u2019s immigration case. The evidence established that this service was never performed and we reject, as implausible, respondent\u2019s explanation that Yzo did not provide him with requested materials to support a motion to reopen based upon changed country conditions. The evidentiary materials substitute counsel ultimately used to file a motion to reopen were provided to respondent in 2004. Respondent admitted that he did not perform the services for which he was retained, that he did not maintain Yzo\u2019s money in a trust account, and that he owed Yzo the return of some unearned fees. Based upon the testimony and evidence presented, the panel finds that respondent neglected legal matters entrusted to him, failed to act with reasonable diligence, failed to return unearned feels and failed to deposit client funds in an IOLTA account, in violation of MRPC 1.1(c), 1.3, 1.16(d), 1.15(d), 8.4(a) and (b) and MCR 9.104(A)(4).</p>\n<p id=\"b267-9\">Finally, this panel concludes that respondent engaged in misconduct during his representation of Dionis Kasolli in an immigration matter as set forth in Count III of the First Amended Formal Complaint. Kasolli paid respondent $2,500.00 to file an appeal and brief with the BIA. While respondent did file the appeal, the immigration matter was ultimately dismissed by the court for failure to file a brief on appeal. The evidence is conflicting with respect to whether respondent prepared and mailed a brief to the court. Attorney Lahti testified that respondent admitted to her that he did not file the brief. However, respondent asserted that he did prepare and mail the brief on appeal to the court and opposing counsel, but admitted that he never followed-up with the court to confirm receipt because it was a routine filing. Further, opposing counsel in the Kasolli matter filed a motion to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"244\">*244</page-number>dismiss based, in part, on the failure to file a brief on appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b268-4\">The more credible evidence supports the conclusion that respondent never mailed the brief and then made a false statement in his sworn testimony. In any event, the record established that no brief was received by the BIA. Even if respondent mailed the brief to the court, and was unaware that it had not been received, at some point he should have known that an irregularity had occurred as he received a \u201cbag and baggage\u201d letter from the BIA indicating that his client was at risk of being deported as no appeal was pending. At no time did respondent investigate these events, file a motion to reopen or contact his client. With respect to the issue of unearned fees, counsel for the Grievance Administrator admits that there was no direct evidence that respondent failed to return unearned fees to the client. Thus, based upon the evidence presented, this panel finds that respondent neglected a legal matter entrusted to him, failed to act with reasonable diligence, failed to keep his client reasonably informed about the status of a matter, and knowingly made a false statement in connection with his disciplinary matter, in violation of MRPC 1.1(c), 1.3, 1.4(a) and (b), 8.1(1), 8.4(a) and (b), and MCR 9.104(A)(4) and MCR 9.104(A)(6).</p>\n<p id=\"b268-5\">V. <em>REPORT ON DISCIPLINE</em></p>\n<p id=\"b268-6\">In deciding the level of discipline to be imposed in this matter, we are instructed by <em>Grievance Administrator v. Lopatin, </em>462 Mich. 235, 612 N.W.2d 120 (2000), to employ the American Bar Association (ABA) Standards for Imposing Lawyer Sanctions. Pursuant to the Standards, we examine the duty respondent violated, respondent\u2019s mental state, and the actual or potential injury caused by respondent\u2019s conduct. Next, aggravating and mitigating factors are to be considered and, finally, we are directed to take into account \u201cany other factors which may make the results of the foregoing analytical process inappropriate,\u201d including Michigan precedent in discipline cases. <em>Lopatin, </em>462 Mich, at 248 n. 13, 612 N.W.2d 120.</p>\n<p id=\"b268-8\">Although there are several allegations of misconduct that have been proven, the gravamen of the misconduct alleged in each count is neglect, albeit neglect significantly compounded by a failure to return the unearned portion of fees paid in advance. Additionally, respondent has demonstrated a pattern of neglect with respect to client immigration matters. Respondent appears to be preying on particularly vulnerable clients. Respondent\u2019s conduct heightened this vulnerability. Because they had run out of \u201cstatus,\u201d as one of the witnesses explained, these clients, unbeknownst to them, were fugitives. This subjected each client to the possibility of arrest, detention and deportation. Indeed, two of the clients have already experienced these consequences. While no one has argued that the clients\u2019 immigration issues would have been resolved more favorably if respondent had not committed misconduct, it is clear that the clients were denied an opportunity to explore their alternatives and/or have their legal status preserved pending appeals. Under the circumstances in this case, we concluded that the level of discipline should be governed by American Bar Association Standard 4.41 which provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b268-9\">4.41 Disbarment is generally appropriate when:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b268-10\">sH <em>-l' *</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b268-11\">(b) a lawyer knowingly fails to perform services for a client and causes serious or potentially serious injury to a client; or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b269-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"245\">*245</page-number>(c) a lawyer engages in a pattern of neglect with respect to client matters and causes serious or potentially serious injury to a client.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b269-5\">Because respondent knowingly failed to perform services for a client causing serious injury to the client, and he engaged in a pattern of neglect with respect to client matters, the misconduct committed warrants revocation of respondent\u2019s license.</p>\n<p id=\"b269-6\">Further, none of the aggravating or mitigating factors in ABA Standard 9.0 compel this panel to question this conclusion. Respondent\u2019s prior disciplinary offenses (9.22(a)) are significant and they illustrate a pattern of mishandling legal matters entrusted to him. Between the years 2000 and 2005, respondent has been admonished six times. At least five of these admonitions have been as a result of his neglect and/or lack of diligence. Several of the admonishments related to immigration matters. Respondent was suspended in April of 2007 for neglecting two immigration matters. Then, in November of 2007, respondent was suspended from the practice of law for four years related to his breach of fiduciary obligations regarding the deposit and availability of funds belonging to an estate and misrepresentations to counsel, a California court and the Grievance Administrator. The Michigan Supreme Court, on January 8, 2008, denied respondent\u2019s application for leave to appeal that suspension.</p>\n<p id=\"b269-7\">Respondent\u2019s selfish motive (9.22(b)) is clearly demonstrated by his failure to perform the work requested and then keeping the unearned fees. Respondent\u2019s conduct has been, at ail times, solely in his self-interest. Not only has respondent\u2019s actions appeared to escalate over the years, they now evidence a pattern of misconduct (9.22(c)). Respondent has repeatedly faded to comply with the rules of the disciplinary process (9.22(e)). He failed to respond to the complaint in a timely fashion, failed to file an affidavit of meritorious defense which was a condition of setting aside the default and he failed to appear at the April 3, 2008 hearing. Finally, as discussed above, respondent\u2019s misconduct frequently involved clients who are particularly vulnerable. (Standard 9.22(h).) No evidence was presented from which we could conclude that any of the mitigating factors set forth in Standard 9.0 applied to this matter.</p>\n<p id=\"b269-9\">This panel, after considering the evidence presented and the brief submitted, concludes that respondent\u2019s license to practice law in the State of Michigan should be revoked. See <em>Grievance Administrator v. Paul S. Schaefer, </em>01-140-GA (ADB 2004) (increasing 30-month suspension to revocation in matter involving serious neglect, lack of diligence and failure to communicate with clients coupled with failure to return unearned fees and aggravating factors which included prior disciplinary offenses and deception during the discipline proceedings). We further order that respondent shall, within 90 days, pay restitution to Gazmend Dervishaj in the amount of $3,000.00, Klodian Yzo in the amount of $1,200.00, and Dionis Kasolli in the amount of $2,500.00.</p>\n<p id=\"b269-10\">VI. <em>SUMMARY OF PRIOR MISCONDUCT</em></p>\n<p id=\"b269-11\">Admonitions:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b269-12\">August 25, 2000 Respondent \u201cfailed to take all necessary steps to ensure that ... clients\u2019 matters were not jeopardized.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b269-13\">October 29, 2001 Respondent failed to protect client\u2019s interests by notifying court of inability to communicate with client.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b269-14\">March 26, 2002 Neglect; competence.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b270-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"246\">*246</page-number>June 24, 2004 Failure to act with reasonable diligence and promptness and failure to keep client reasonably informed about matter.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b270-4\">August 30, 2005 Failure to communicate.

Moreover, the misconduct for which we are recommending punishment does not lend itself to correction by the assistance of a mentoring attorney. Therefore, the Committee does not recommend that the Court require Mr. Weideman to obtain a mentor.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b252-8\">.
