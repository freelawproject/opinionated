(\u201cAmerican\u201d) to include claims under California\u2019s Labor Code Private Attorneys General Act (\u201cLCPAGA\u201d), Cal. Labor Code \u00a7 2698 <em>et seq., </em>and (2) the district court\u2019s subsequent decision to grant American summary judgment on Milligan\u2019s original claims under California Labor Code Sections 226(e) (\u201cSection 226(e)\u201d) and (3) 226(g) (\u201cSection 226(g)\u201d). Because the Supreme Court of California is considering the scope of recovery available under Section 226(e), <em>Brinkley v. Pub. Storage, Inc., </em>84 Cal. Rptr.3d 873, 880 (2008) (a Section 226 plaintiff must show that she suffered an injury as an \u201cessential element\u201d of her claim), <em>review granted and opinion superseded by </em>\u2014 Cal.4th-, 87 Cal.Rptr.3d 674, 198 P.3d 1087 (2009), we defer resolution of Milligan\u2019s Section 226(e) claim pending a decision from the Supreme Court of California. We also defer resolution of Milligan\u2019s LCPAGA claim under Section 226 pending <em>Brinkley. </em>The parties are directed to (1) inform this court in writing within 14 days of the Supreme Court of California\u2019s decision in <em>Brinkley, </em>and (2) move for appropriate relief.</p>\n<p id=\"b719-16\">However, we affirm the district court with respect to its decision to (1) grant <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"696\">*696</page-number>American summary judgment on Milligan\u2019s Section 226(g) claim, and (2) deny Milligan leave to amend her Complaint to include LCPAGA claims under California Labor Code Sections 201 and 202 (\u201cSections 201 and 202\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b720-4\">(a) Milligan does not have standing to seek injunctive relief under Section 226(g)</p>\n<p id=\"b720-5\">Ninth Circuit and United States Supreme Court case law directly rebut Milligan\u2019s argument that she need not be a current American employee to seek injunctive relief, because she brings a class action claim, under which she asserts \u201cformer employees [may] provide superior representation.\u201d To have standing under Article III of the United States Constitution, Milligan must (1) have suffered an injury in fact that is (a) concrete and particularized and (b) actual or imminent; (2) there must be a causal connection between the injury and the complained-of conduct; and (3) it must be likely that the court\u2019s favorable decision provides redress to the individual. <em>Lujan v. Defenders of Wildlife, </em>504 U.S. 555, 560, 112 S.Ct. 2130, 119 L.Ed.2d 351 (1992). Further, \u201c[i]n the context of injunctive relief, [Milligan] must demonstrate a real or immediate threat of an irreparable injury.\u201d <em>Clark v. City of Lakewood, </em>259 F.3d 996, 1007 (9th Cir. 2001) (internal citations omitted). Milligan is not an American employee. She therefore cannot show that she faces a \u201creal or immediate threat of irreparable injury\u201d by American\u2019s employment practices. The fact that Milligan bi\u2019ought a class-action claim does not alter this analysis. <em>See, e.g., Lewis v. Casey, </em>518 U.S. 343, 357, 116 S.Ct. 2174, 135 L.Ed.2d 606 (1996) (\u201c[t]hat a suit may be a class action ... adds nothing to the question of standing\u201d). Accordingly, the district court properly granted American summary judgment on Milligan\u2019s Section 226(g) claim for injunctive relief.</p>\n<p id=\"b720-7\">(b) Milligan\u2019s LCPAGA claims under Sections 201 and 202 were untimely.</p>\n<p id=\"b720-8\">We affirm the district court\u2019s decision to deny Milligan leave to amend her Complaint to add LCPAGA claims under Sections 201 and 202. Milligan sought leave to amend her Complaint after California\u2019s one-year statute of limitations elapsed. LCPAGA\u2019s tolling provisions do not save the claims from Milligan\u2019s delay in bringing them before the district court. Moreover, the claims under Sections 201 and 202 do not relate back to the date of Milligan\u2019s Complaint, because the claims did nor arise out of the conduct, transaction, or occurrence set forth or attempted to be set forth in the Complaint. <em>See </em>Fed R. Civ. Pro. 15(c). Accordingly, the district court did not abuse its discretion when it denied Milligan leave to amend.</p>\n<p id=\"b720-9\">AFFIRMED in part, DEFERRED in part.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b719-10\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9th Cir.
