Lan claimed past persecution and a fear of future persecution based on his experiences as a Zhong Gong practitioner. The IJ made an adverse credibility determination in connection with Lan\u2019s failed attempt to establish his identity. The Board of Immigration Appeals (\u201cBIA\u201d) agreed that Lan had failed to establish his identity. Lan filed a timely petition for review and we deny the petition because we cannot find that the record compels reversal of the adverse credibility determination.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b52-15\">We review the findings of eligibility for asylum and denial of withholding of removal under the substantial evidence standard. <em>Malkandi v. Mukasey, </em>544 F.3d 1029,1035 (9th Cir.2008). Adverse credibility findings are also reviewed for substantial evidence. <em>Gui v. INS, </em>280 F.3d. 1217, 1225 (9th Cir.2002). \u201cUnder the substantial evidence standard, \u2018administrative findings of fact are conclusive unless any reasonable adjudicator would be compelled to conclude to the contrary.\u2019 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(b)(4)(B).\u201d <em>Malkandi, </em>544 F.3d at 1035. Where, as here, a petitioner challenges the IJ\u2019s credibility determination as <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"29\">*29</page-number>erroneous, he must establish that the evidence not only supports his position, but compels it. <em>Farah v. Ashcroft, </em>348 F.3d 1153,1156 (9th Cir.2003).</p>\n<p id=\"b53-5\">We find the adverse credibility determination in this case to be based on substantial evidence. Petitioner entered the country with a regularly issued passport and visa in the name of Xianzhao Lan. Petitioner\u2019s picture was attached to each document. Petitioner, however, testified that he is <em>Xiantong </em>Lan, and that <em>Xianzhao </em>Lan is his brother. He further testified that this brother had procured the passport and visa for him without his knowledge. The only evidence petitioner offered to support his testimony was a birth certificate issued in China in 2002, which was after petitioner had arrived in the United States. Petitioner, however, stated that he requested the birth certificate in 2003, and his testimony as to how he obtained the birth certificate was vague. Although a picture of petitioner as an adult was attached to the birth certificate, petitioner could not say how this came about, and the birth certificate was not properly authenticated, although it appears to have been notarized. This evidence does not compel the conclusion that petitioner is not Xiangzhao Lan.</p>\n<p id=\"b53-6\">Petitioner\u2019s reliance on <em>Akinmade v. INS, </em>196 F.3d 951, 956 (9th Cir.1999), is misplaced. There, we distinguished between \u201cfalse statements made to establish the critical elements of the asylum claim from false statements made to evade INS officials.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 956. In <em>Akinmade, </em>there was no question that the proffered Canadian passport was false, and the issue was whether the admittedly false passport could serve as a basis for an adverse credibility determination as to petitioner\u2019s claim of persecution in his native Nigeria. Here, petitioner has not established his identity, or that his regularly issued passport and visa are false. Although he claims that they are, the proffered proof of his identity is a birth certificate issued in China after petitioner left China and apparently a year before petitioner sought a birth certificate. This is not sufficient to meet petitioner\u2019s burden of establishing his identity. Because the inconsistencies between the passport and visa and the birth certificate are central to establishing petitioner\u2019s identity, they \u201cgo to the heart of the asylum claim\u201d and are not \u201cminor inconsistencies.\u201d <em>See Mendoza Manimbao v. Ashcroft, </em>329 F.3d 655, 660 (9th Cir.2003).</p>\n<p id=\"b53-8\">The IJ\u2019s concern with petitioner\u2019s credibility is also supported by petitioner\u2019s implausible testimony that even though he was being persecuted for practicing Zhong Gong, and that the police were watching his house, three people came to his house three times a week to learn Zhong Gong and that they practiced Zhong Gong when the police were not present.</p>\n<p id=\"b53-9\">Because petitioner has not met the eligibility requirements for asylum, he does not meet the stricter requirements for withholding of removal. <em>See Gomes v. Gonzales, </em>429 F.3d 1264, 1266 (9th Cir.2005). Also, petitioner has failed to carry his burden of showing that it is more likely than not that he would be tortured if returned to China, and therefore does not qualify for relief under the CAT. <em>See Villegas v. Mukasey, </em>523 F.3d 984, 988 (9th Cir.2008).</p>\n<p id=\"b53-10\">Petitioner\u2019s arguments were well presented by counsel both in the briefs and at oral argument, however, we can reverse only if the evidence presented by the petitioner compels findings contrary to those made by the IJ and the BIA. <em>See </em>8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(b)(4)(B); see <em>also INS v. Elias-Zacarias, </em>502 U.S. 478, 481, 112 S.Ct. 812, 117 L.Ed.2d 38 (1992). Because we are not so compelled, the petition for review is DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b52-11\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9 th Cir. R. 36-3.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b52-16\">. Because the parties are familiar with the facts and procedural history, we do not restate them here except as necessary to explain our disposition.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-3\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b54-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"30\">*30</page-number>SILVERMAN, Circuit Judge,</author>\n<p id=\"Aq\">dissenting:</p>\n<p id=\"b54-4\">We defer to an immigration judge\u2019s adverse credibility finding so long as there is a basis in the record for the finding. If the IJ\u2019s finding amounts to nothing <em>more </em>than a guess, it is not supported by substantial evidence. <em>See Zhou v. Gonzales, 437 F.3d </em>860, <em>865 </em>(9th Cir.2006); <em>Shire v. Ashcroft, </em>388 F.3d 1288, 1295-96 (9th Cir. 2004).</p>\n<p id=\"b54-5\">Here, the lynchpin of the IJ\u2019s ruling was her disbelief of petitioner\u2019s testimony that the Chinese passport bore his photo but his brother\u2019s name. He testified that the passport had been obtained for him by his brother so that he could escape from China. The IJ looked at a photocopy of the passport; the passport did not look phony to her, and so she proclaimed it valid and the petitioner a liar.</p>\n<p id=\"b54-6\">It is not inconceivable that the petitioner is, in fact, lying about the provenance of the passport. By the same token, it is not beyond the realm of possibility that the passport was obtained just as the petitioner testified. The problem is that there is simply no way one can tell just by looking at it, yet that is exactly what the IJ purported to do. Speculation and conjecture are not entitled to deference.</p>\n<p id=\"b54-7\">Furthermore, it is worth noting that the petitioner\u2019s conduct upon entering the United States is consistent with his story. At his very first asylum interview, petitioner volunteered of his own accord that the passport he used to enter the country was fraudulent. If he were trying to pull a fast one on U.S. immigration authorities, how he could benefit from volunteering that the passport with which he gained entry to United States looks real but isn\u2019t?</p>\n<p id=\"b54-8\">Petitioner tendered what he represented to be his real birth certificate, bearing his photo. The IJ deemed this document a phony because it bore an issuance date prior to his arrival in the United States. The petitioner explained that his brother\u2014 who obtained the false passport before petitioner left China\u2014also procured this birth certificate. These documents were all obtained at around the same time. Again, maybe this is true, maybe it\u2019s not, but I fail to see what basis the IJ has to reject this testimony other than conjecture.</p>\n<p id=\"b54-10\">The IJ also found incredible petitioner\u2019s testimony that he managed to avoid being caught practicing Zhong Gong at his home. It is not unheard of for an asylum applicant to exaggerate his encounters with the police. Here, paradoxically, the petitioner is minimizing them. In any event, I do not see what is so inherently incredible about petitioner\u2019s claim that he was able to practice Zhong Gong at home, behind closed doors, without having been caught\u2014especially since he was actively trying to avoid detection. If the testimony is not inherently implausible, the IJ needs a non-speculative reason to disbelieve it. <em>See Jibril v. Gonzales, </em>423 F.3d 1129, 1135 (9th Cir. 2005). That reason is lacking here.</p>\n<p id=\"b54-11\">Because the IJ\u2019s adverse credibility determination was not supported by substantial evidence, I respectfully dissent. I would grant the petition for review and remand to the BIA for consideration of whether Lan was eligible for asylum, withholding of removal, and CAT relief in the first instance.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
