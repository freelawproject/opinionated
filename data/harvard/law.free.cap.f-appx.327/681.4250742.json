His counsel has moved to withdraw and filed a brief under <em>Anders v. California, </em>386 U.S. 738, 87 S.Ct. 1396, 18 L.Ed\u00fcd 493 (1967), arguing that the factual basis supporting the guilty plea was insufficient.</p>\n<p id=\"b706-7\">Avalos-Lopez pleaded guilty pursuant to a plea agreement that contained a waiver of his right to appeal his conviction and his sentence. Upon careful review, we conclude that Avalos-Lopez understood and voluntarily accepted the terms of the plea agreement, including the appeal waiver; the appeal falls within the scope of the waiver; and no miscarriage of justice would result from enforcing it. <em>See United States v. Andis, </em>333 F.3d 886, 889-92 (8th Cir.2003) (en banc) (discussing enforceability of appeal waiver); <em>United States v. Estrada-Bahena, </em>201 F.3d 1070, 1071 (8th Cir.2000) (per curiam) (enforcing appeal waiver in <em>Anders </em>case). Having reviewed the record independently under <em>Penson v. Ohio, </em>488 U.S. 75, 80, 109 S.Ct. 346, 102 L.Ed.2d 300 (1988), we have found no nonfrivolous issues for appeal beyond the scope of the appeal waiver.</p>\n<p id=\"b706-10\">Accordingly, we enforce the appeal waiver and dismiss the appeal. We grant counsel\u2019s motion to withdraw, subject to counsel advising Avalos-Lopez of his right to file a petition for a writ of certiorari.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b706-8\">.
