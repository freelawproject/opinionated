R.App. P. 34(a)(2).</p>\n</footnote>\n<opinion data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"majority\">\n<p id=\"b62-5\">MEMORANDUM <footnotemark>**</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b62-6\">Anna Gyumushyan (\u201cGyumushyan\u201d), and derivatively her daughter, Marianna Simikyan, natives and citizens of Armenia, petition for review of the Board of Immigration Appeal\u2019s (\u201cBIA\u201d) decision adopting and affirming the Immigration Judge\u2019s (\u201cI J\u201d) denial of their application for asylum and withholding of removal. While finding her testimony credible, the IJ held that whatever persecution Gyumushyan suffered was not on account of any imputed political opinion or any other protected ground. This finding was not supported by substantial evidence. Because the BIA did not properly apply Ninth Circuit law regarding when whistleblowing against corrupt government officials constitutes protected political opinion, we grant the petition and remand to the BIA. The parties are familiar with the facts of the case and we need not recite them here.</p>\n<p id=\"b62-7\">The IJ discounted Gyumushyan\u2019s testimony that the cause of her husband\u2019s arrest, the search of her apartment, and the threats they received was related to evidence her husband possessed and his efforts to prove the corruption of a government official, because the corruption was \u201cpublic knowledge.\u201d The IJ engaged in improper speculation and her finding is not supported by the record. <em>See also Ratnam v. INS, </em>154 F.3d 990, 995 (9th Cir. 1998) (applying presumption of political motivation if no logical reason or legitimate prosecutorial purpose supports harassment of an individual).</p>\n<p id=\"b62-10\">Gyumushyan satisfied the test established in <em>Grava v. INS, </em>205 F.3d 1177 (9th Cir.2000), for determining when whistle-blowing against corrupt government officials may constitute a protected political activity, as applied in <em>Hasan v. Ashcroft, </em>380 F.3d 1114 (9th Cir.2004), and <em>Sagaydak v. Gonzales, </em>405 F.3d 1035 (9th Cir. 2005). The BIA erred by finding that Gyumushyan needed to show that her husband\u2019s actions were directed at the government as a \u201cwhole.\u201d Rather, she met the <em>Grava </em>test by showing that \u201ca powerful political leader use[d] his political office as a means to siphon public money for personal use, and use[d] political connections throughout a wide swath of government agencies, both to facilitate and protect his illicit operations.... \u201d <em>Hasan, </em>380 F.3d at 1121. Gyumushyan satisfied this requirement by credibly testifying that the official used military personnel and trucks to facilitate his corruption and that he used his connections with the KGB to search Gyumushyan\u2019s apartment, arrest her husband and stifle any investigation into his disappearance. As a government employee, refusing the bribe of his superior officer and turning over evidence of corruption to prosecutors was sufficient to impute political opinion to Gyumushyan\u2019s husband. <em>See Sagaydak, </em>405 F.3d at 1042.</p>\n<p id=\"b62-11\">The imputed political opinion extends to Gyumushyan, and not just her husband, not only because of her relationship to him, but also because of her perceived actions in continuing his \u201cfight\u201d in her own right. <em>See id. </em>at 1044-1045 (considering husband and wife\u2019s persecution together, though based only on husband\u2019s political activities); <em>Navas v. INS, </em>217 F.3d 646, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"39\">*39</page-number>659 n. 18 (9th Cir.2000) (\u201cIn the eyes of those who persecute the spouse of a political activist, the activist\u2019s political sins are, by derivation, the spouse\u2019s.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b63-5\">We remand to the BIA to determine whether Gyumushyan also has a well-founded fear of future persecution and whether the government has met its burden of rebutting her presumption of future persecution through evidence of changed country conditions or Gyumushyan\u2019s ability to internally relocate. <em>See Hasan, </em>380 F.3d at 1122 (citing <em>INS v. Ventura, </em>537 U.S. 12, 16-17, 123 S.Ct. 353, 154 L.Ed.2d 272 (2002)).</p>\n<p id=\"b63-6\">PETITION GRANTED and REMANDED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b62-8\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9th Cir.
