May 8, 2007), <em>affg </em>No. A77 317 144 (Immig. Ct. N.Y. City Dec. 9, 2005). We assume the parties\u2019 familiarity with the underlying facts and procedural history in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b325-16\">Although Liu is challenging the denial of relief in \u201casylum-only\u201d proceedings, as opposed to an actual removal order, we nonetheless have jurisdiction under 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(a)(1) because the denial of relief in these circumstances is the functional equivalent of a removal order. <em>See Kanacevic v. INS, </em>448 F.3d 129, 134 (2d Cir. 2006). When the BIA agrees with the IJ\u2019s conclusion that a petitioner is not credible and, without rejecting any of the IJ\u2019s grounds for decision, emphasizes particular aspects of that decision, we review both the BIA\u2019s and IJ\u2019s opinions\u2014or more precisely, we review the IJ\u2019s decision including the portions not explicitly discussed by the BIA. <em>Yun-Zui Guan v. Gonzales, </em>432 F.3d 391, 394 (2d Cir.2005). We review the agency\u2019s factual findings, including adverse credibility findings, under the substantial evidence standard. <em>See </em>8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(b)(4)(B); <em>see also Xiu Xia Lin v. Mukasey, </em>534 F.3d 162, 167 (2d Cir.2008). We review <em>de novo </em>questions of law and the application of law to undisputed fact. <em>Salimatou Bah v. Mukasey, </em>529 F.3d 99, 110 (2d Cir.2008).</p>\n<p id=\"b325-17\">We \u201cdefer ... to an IJ\u2019s credibility determination unless, from the totality of the circumstances, it is plain that no reasonable fact-finder could make such an adverse credibility ruling.\u201d <em>Xiu Xia Lin, </em>534 F.3d at 167. For asylum applications governed by the amendments made to the Immigration and Nationality Act by the REAL ID Act, the agency may base a credibility finding on an asylum applicant\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"302\">*302</page-number>\u201cdemeanor, candor, or responsiveness,\u201d the plausibility of his or her account, and inconsistencies in his or her statements, without regard to whether they go \u201cto the heart of the applicant\u2019s claim.\u201d 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1158(b)(1)(B)(iii).</p>\n<p id=\"b326-4\">Substantial evidence supports the agency\u2019s adverse credibility determination. Liu testified that his wife had been forcibly aborted; yet his statement to an asylum officer during his credible fear interview made no mention of any family planning claim. <em>Id. </em>Moreover, Liu admitted to the asylum officer that he had not mentioned his wife\u2019s alleged forced abortion during his credible fear interview. <em>Cf. Ramsameachire v. Ashcroft, </em>357 F.3d 169, 179 (2d Cir.2004) (noting that where discrepancies and omissions arise in the context of an applicant\u2019s statements during an airport interview, the agency and this Court must closely examine the interview to ensure that it represents a \u201csufficiently accurate record\u201d of the applicant\u2019s statements to merit consideration in determining whether the applicant is credible). The IJ reasonably declined to credit Liu\u2019s explanation that he failed to mention his wife\u2019s alleged forced abortion because he was under stress, he had insufficient time to explain his claim, and he was worried about the money he owes to smugglers. <em>See Majidi v. Gonzales, </em>430 F.3d 77, 80-81 (2d Cir.2005) (finding that an agency need not credit an applicant\u2019s explanations for inconsistent testimony unless those explanations would compel a reasonable fact-finder to do so).</p>\n<p id=\"b326-5\">Because Liu\u2019s failure to mention his wife\u2019s alleged forced abortion in his credible fear interview provided a sufficient basis for the agency\u2019s adverse credibility determination, <em>see </em>8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1158(b)(1)(B)(iii), we need not review the IJ\u2019s additional finding that Liu\u2019s testimony was vague, <em>see Xian Tuan Ye v. Dep\u2019t of Homeland, Security, </em>446 F.3d 289, 294 n. 6 (2d Cir.2006). Liu\u2019s applications for asylum, withholding of removal, and CAT relief all rested on the same factual predicate. Accordingly, the agency\u2019s denial of each application was proper. <em>See Paul v. Gonzales, </em>444 F.3d 148, 156 (2d Cir.2006) (recognizing that withholding of removal and CAT claims necessarily fail if the applicant is unable to show the objective likelihood of persecution needed to make out an asylum claim and the factual predicate for the claims is the same).</p>\n<p id=\"b326-7\">As to Liu\u2019s CAT claim based on his illegal departure from China, an applicant cannot demonstrate that he is more likely than not to be tortured \u201cbased <em>solely </em>on the fact that [ ]he is part of the large class of persons who have illegally departed China\u201d and on generalized evidence indicating that torture occurs in Chinese prisons. <em>See Mu Xiang Lin v. U.S. Dep\u2019t of Justice, </em>432 F.3d 156, 159-60 (2d Cir.2005); <em>see also Pierre v. Gonzales, </em>502 F.3d 109, 118\u201419 (2d Cir.2007). Liu provided no basis for the IJ to conclude that he, or someone in his \u201cparticular alleged circumstances,\u201d faces a risk of torture. Substantial evidence therefore supports the agency\u2019s denial of his application for CAT relief based on his illegal departure.</p>\n<p id=\"b326-8\">For the foregoing reasons, the petition for review is DENIED. As we have completed our review, any stay of removal that the Court previously granted in this petition is VACATED, and any pending motion for a stay of removal in this petition is DISMISSED as moot. Any pending request for oral argument in this petition is DENIED in accordance with Federal Rule of Appellate Procedure 34(a)(2), and Second Circuit Local Rule 34(b).</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
