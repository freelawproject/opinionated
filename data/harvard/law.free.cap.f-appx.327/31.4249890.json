AMF purchased the monuments from Jeffory Fairbrother (\u201cFairbrother\u201d) in February of 2002, but failed to fulfill its obligations under the contracts. Fairbrother subsequently assigned his rights to the monuments to Global, which initiated the present action against AMF.</p>\n<p id=\"b56-4\">AMF argues that it was fraudulently induced into the AMF-Fairbrother purchase agreements through Fairbrother\u2019s representations regarding potential buyers. We hold that the district court properly upheld the contract, notwithstanding AMF\u2019s objection. The AMF-Fairbrother purchase agreements include the following language: \u201c[n]o representations or warranties ... have been made by any party to the other party to induce the making of this agreement except as specifically set out in this agreement.\u201d The agreements, which were drafted by AMF, do not include any reference to potential buyers. Further, the district court found that AMF\u2019s internal documents reaffirmed the company\u2019s contractual obligations to Fair-brother as late as May of 2006. This finding is supported by the record. The district court therefore properly upheld the AMF-Fairbrother purchase agreements.</p>\n<p id=\"b56-5\">AMF challenges the validity of the Fairbrother-Global assignment on fraudulent transfer grounds. Nevada\u2019s fraudulent transfer provision provides a cause of action to a \u201ccreditor\u201d against a debtor who transfers property in violation of NRS 112.180. <em>See </em>NRS 112.210. A creditor is defined as \u201ca person who has a claim,\u201d which is in turn defined as \u201ca right to payment, whether or not the right is reduced to judgment, liquidated, unliquidated, fixed, contingent, matured, unmatured, disputed, undisputed, legal, equitable, secured or unsecured.\u201d NRS 112.150(3)\u2014(4). The district court determined that AMF does not have \u201ca right to payment\u201d against Fairbrother or Global on the facts of this case. We now affirm that finding. Because AMF is not a creditor of either party to the assignment, it cannot avail itself of Nevada\u2019s fraudulent transfer provision.</p>\n<p id=\"b56-7\">AFFIRMED. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"33\">*33</page-number>nesses, that she improperly interpreted the government\u2019s burden of proof, and that she wanted to be removed from the jury because she no longer wished to explain her views to the other jurors.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b55-20\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9th Cir.
