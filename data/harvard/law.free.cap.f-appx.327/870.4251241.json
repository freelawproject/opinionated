Spechler appeals the dismissal of his five-count civil rights damages complaint, filed under 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983, against Chief Judge Victor Tobin of Bro-ward County alleging violations of various liberty and property interests without due process of law, as well as other state law claims. These claims arose out of former county judge Spechler\u2019s reassignment by the Chief Judge to a different judicial post, and Spechler\u2019s resignation one day later, alleging that he had been \u201cbanished\u201d to a satellite court office with a nonexistent docket.</p>\n<p id=\"b894-16\">The district court reviewed Spechler\u2019s claims and determined that defendant is protected by qualified immunity because no violation of a clearly established constitutional right occurred, plaintiff does not have standing to pursue his claims, sovereign immunity protects defendant from the state law claims, and, in any event, they have no merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b894-17\">We have reviewed the pleadings, the record, and the district court\u2019s order dismissing this case. Finding no error, we shall</p>\n<p id=\"b894-18\">AFFIRM.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
