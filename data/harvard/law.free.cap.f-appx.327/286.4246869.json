We assume the parties\u2019 familiarity as to the facts, the procedural context, and the specification of appellate issues.</p>\n<p id=\"b311-6\">This Court reviews sentences for reasonableness, ascertaining whether the sentence imposed is the product of an abuse of discretion. <em>United States v. Verkhoglyad, </em>516 F.3d 122, (2d Cir.2008). A district court abuses or exceeds its discretion only \u201cwhen (1) its decision rests on an error of law or a clearly erroneous factual finding, or (2) its decision\u2014though not necessarily the product of a legal error or a clearly erroneous factual finding\u2014cannot be located within the range of permissible decisions.\u201d <em>United States v. Brady, </em>417 F.3d 326, 332 (2d Cir.2005) (quoting <em>Zervos v. Verizon N.Y. Inc., </em>252 F.3d 163, 169 (2d Cir.2001)). A sentence may be found unreasonable either because of its length or because the sentencing judge committed a procedural error by selecting \u00e1 sentence in violation of applicable law. <em>See, United States v. Crosby, </em>397 F.3d 103, 113 (2d Cir.2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b311-7\">Greggs challenges the substantive reasonableness of his sentence, arguing that the district court failed to strike an appropriate balance between the various factors set forth in 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a) in imposing his sentence. Specifically, he claims that the district court placed too much weight on the seriousness of his bank robbery offenses, while not relying heavily enough upon his claimed mental and emotional depression at the time he committed the crimes. However, while the district court emphasized the severity Greggs\u2019 crimes, it also acknowledged that Greggs had made a strong argument for leniency, stating that the \u201clow end of the guideline range may be appropriate here.\u201d Accordingly, the court imposed a sentence of 51 months, declining to impose a below-Guidelines sentence, but sentencing Greggs to the low end of the 51 to 63 month range recommended in the PSR. In light of the district court\u2019s careful consideration of not only the Guidelines and the applicable range set forth therein, but also of Greggs\u2019 arguments for leniency, the government\u2019s response, and the factors in 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a), we cannot conclude on this record that the district court abused its discretion in sentencing Greggs to 51 months incarceration. <em>See Gall v. United States, </em>552 U.S. 38, 128 S.Ct. 586, 594, 169 L.Ed.2d 445, 454-55 (2007); 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a).</p>\n<p id=\"b311-9\">Accordingly, for the reasons set forth above, the judgment of the district court is AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
