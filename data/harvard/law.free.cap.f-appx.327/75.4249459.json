We take jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291, DENY Mr. Edwards\u2019s request for a COA, and DISMISS this appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b99-27\">I. BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b99-28\">Mr. Edwards filed this habeas petition while incarcerated at the Oklahoma County Detention Center. He named only the State of Oklahoma as the respondent. The state filed a motion to dismiss, contending that it was not a proper respondent. Mr. Edwards did not respond to the motion. The magistrate issued a report and recommendation agreeing with the state\u2019s position. The magistrate further advised against substituting the proper respondent due to the unintelligible nature of the petition.</p>\n<p id=\"b100-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"76\">*76</page-number>Mr. Edwards then filed an \u201cApplication for Immediate Release,\u201d which the district court construed as an objection to the report and recommendation. This filing, however, did not address who should be named as the respondent; indeed, the district court noted that it appeared entirely unrelated to the matters raised in the habeas petition. Thus, the court agreed with both of the magistrate\u2019s recommendations and dismissed the petition for failure to name the proper party respondent and for being unintelligible. Mr. Edwards appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b100-4\">II. DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b100-5\">A habeas petitioner may not appeal from the denial of his petition without first obtaining a COA. 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2253(c)(1). We will issue a COA \u201conly if the applicant has made a substantial showing of the denial of a constitutional right.\u201d <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 2253(c)(2). When the district court denies the petitioner\u2019s claim on the merits, \u201c[t]he petitioner must demonstrate that reasonable jurists would find the district court\u2019s assessment of the constitutional claims debatable or wrong.\u201d <em>Slack v. McDaniel, </em>529 U.S. 473, 484, 120 S.Ct. 1595, 146 L.Ed.2d 542 (2000). When the petition is denied on procedural grounds, the petitioner must demonstrate \u201cthat jurists of reason would find it debatable whether the petition states a valid claim of the denial of a constitutional right and that jurists of reason would find it debatable whether the district court was correct in its procedural ruling.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b100-6\">The district court correctly determined that the State of Oklahoma was not the proper respondent. A habeas petition must be directed toward the petitioner\u2019s custodian. 28 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 2242, 2243. When Mr. Edwards filed his petition, he was in detained at the Oklahoma County Detention Center and therefore in the custody of the county sheriff. Okla. Stat. tit. 19 \u00a7 513 (\u201cThe sheriff shall have the charge and custody of the jail of his county, and all the prisoners in the same\u201d). It appears that Mr. Edwards is currently incarcerated at the Jackie Brannon Correctional Center in McAlester, Oklahoma; thus, his current custodian is the warden of that facility. <em>See Rumsfeld v. Padilla, </em>542 U.S. 426, 435, 124 S.Ct. 2711, 159 L.Ed.2d 513 (2004) (\u201c[T]he default rule is that the proper respondent is the warden of the facility where the prisoner is being held\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b100-8\">We further agree that the district court properly dismissed the petition rather than substitute the proper party respondent. Although Mr. Edwards is proceeding pro se, the court was under no obligation to correct obvious deficiencies in his petition. <em>See Hall v. Bellmon, </em>935 F.2d 1106, 1110 (10th Cir.1991) (\u201c[W]e do not believe it is the proper function of the district court to assume the role of advocate for the pro se litigant.\u201d). This is especially true where, as here, the pro se petitioner has been repeatedly advised of the error but has failed to respond at all to the matter. Finally, we agree with the magistrate\u2019s and the district court\u2019s assessment of Mr. Edwards\u2019s filings. Even construing them liberally, we fail to comprehend the nature of Mr. Edwards\u2019s elaim(s). Thus, the petition was properly dismissed. <em>See Knox v. Wyo. Dep\u2019t. of Corr., </em>34 F.3d 964, 968 (10th Cir.1994) (affirming dismissal of \u00a7 2254 petition for failure to state a claim).</p>\n<p id=\"b100-9\">III. CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b100-10\">The district court properly dismissed Mr. Edwards\u2019s \u00a7 2254 petition. Accordingly, we DENY his request for a COA and DISMISS this appeal. Mr. Edwards\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"77\">*77</page-number>motion to proceed in forma pauperis is GRANTED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
