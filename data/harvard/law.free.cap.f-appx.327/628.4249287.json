Acker appeals the district court\u2019s summary judgment in favor of Defendant-Appellee Workhorse Sales Corporation (\u201cWorkhorse\u201d) on Acker\u2019s claim of age discrimination under the Michigan Elliot Larsen Civil Rights Act (\u201cELCRA\u201d), Mich. Comp. Laws \u00a7 37.2201, et seq. Acker also appeals the district court\u2019s denial of his motion for reconsideration of the court\u2019s grant of summary judgment. Acker alleges that Workhorse terminated him because of his age in violation of the ELCRA. Workhorse moved for and the district court granted summary judgment because Acker had failed to put forth any <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"629\">*629</page-number>direct evidence of discrimination and because Acker failed to demonstrate a genuine issue of material fact as to whether Workhorse\u2019s third reduction-in-force was pretext for discrimination. <em>Acker v. Workhorse Sales Corp., </em>No. 06-cv-14467, Doc. No. 62, 2008 WL 1902034, at *16-18 (E.D.Mich. Apr. 28, 2008). Finding no error in its previous decision, the district court subsequently denied Acker\u2019s motion for reconsideration. <em>Acker v. Workhorse Sales Corp., </em>No. 06-cv-14467, 2008 WL 4104499, at *5 (E.D.Mich. Sept. 2, 2008).</p>\n<p id=\"b653-5\">This Court reviews a grant of summary judgment de novo. <em>Sullivan v. Or. Ford, Inc., </em>559 F.3d 594 (6th Cir.2009) (citing <em>Miller v. Admin. Office of the Courts, </em>448 F.3d 887, 893 (6th Cir.2006)). The moving party is entitled to summary judgment \u201cif the pleadings, the discovery and disclosure materials on file, and any affidavits show that there is no genuine issue as to any material fact and that the movant is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.\u201d Fed. R. Civ. P. 56(c)(2); <em>see also Anderson v. Liberty Lobby, Inc., </em>477 U.S. 242, 247, 106 S.Ct. 2505, 91 L.Ed.2d 202 (1986). We view factual evidence in the light most favorable to the non-moving party and draw all reasonable inferences in that party\u2019s favor. <em>See Henderson v. Walled Lake Consol. Sch., </em>469 F.3d 479, 487 (6th Cir. 2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b653-7\">We have carefully reviewed the parties\u2019 briefs, the applicable law, and the district court\u2019s order granting summary judgment to Workhorse. We agree that no genuine issues of material fact exist and defendants are entitled to judgment as a matter of law. Because the district court\u2019s decision is well-reasoned, we find no reason to expand on its analysis. Therefore, we AFFIRM the grant of summary judgment to Workhorse for the reasons stated in the district court\u2019s opinion.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
