O\u2019BRIEN, Circuit Judge.</author>\n<p id=\"b821-24\">In a one-count indictment, Alexander Christian Miles, age 44, was charged with violating the Mann Act, 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2423(a), by transporting a fifteen-year-old girl into Oklahoma for sexual activity in violation of Oklahoma law. (Case No. 05-CR-213). The indictment did not specify the Oklahoma law(s) Miles allegedly violated.</p>\n<p id=\"b821-25\">After the jury was sworn but before any evidence was presented or arguments made, Miles moved to dismiss the indict<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"798\">*798</page-number>ment for lack of specificity. The district court granted the motion. Almost immediately Miles was re-indicted under the Mann Act in this case (Case No. 06-CR-96) for the same interstate transportation, but the new indictment contained a citation to the Oklahoma statutes Miles allegedly violated. Miles again moved to dismiss, this time on double jeopardy grounds. The district court denied his motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b822-4\">The Fifth Amendment of the United States Constitution guarantees that no person shall \u201cbe subject for the same of-fence to be twice put in jeopardy of life or limb.\u201d U.S. Const, amend. V. It prevents a person from being prosecuted for a crime of which he has once been acquitted.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"A5yh\">The rationale for barring a retrial after an acquittal has been explained as follows: \u201cthe State with all its resources and power should not be allowed to make repeated attempts to convict an individual for an alleged offense, thereby subjecting him to embarrassment, expense and ordeal and compelling him to live in a continuing state of anxiety, and insecurity, as well as enhancing the possibility that even though innocent he may be found guilty.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b822-5\"><em>United States v. Wood, </em>958 F.2d 963, 971 (10th Cir.1992) (quoting <em>Green v. United States, </em>355 U.S. 184, 187-88, 78 S.Ct. 221, 2 L.Ed.2d 199 (1957)). <em>See also Burks v. United States, </em>437 U.S. 1, 11, 98 S.Ct. 2141, 57 L.Ed.2d 1 (1978) (\u201cThe Double Jeopardy Clause forbids a second trial for the purpose of affording the prosecution another opportunity to supply evidence which it failed to muster in the first proceeding.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b822-6\">On the other hand:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b822-8\">The double-jeopardy provision of the Fifth Amendment ... does not mean that every time a defendant is put to trial before a competent tribunal he is entitled to go free if the trial fails to end in a final judgment. Such a rule would create an insuperable obstacle to the administration of justice in many cases in which there is no semblance of the type of oppressive practices at which the double-jeopardy prohibition is aimed.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b822-9\"><em>Wade v. Hunter, </em>336 U.S. 684, 688-89, 69 S.Ct. 834, 93 L.Ed. 974 <em>(1949). In </em>other words, the government is entitled to one fair opportunity to present its evidence and make its case for conviction. <em>See Burks, </em>437 U.S. at 16-17, 98 S.Ct. 2141.</p>\n<p id=\"b822-10\">The jury had no opportunity to decide anything in this case\u2014it heard neither evidence nor argument. Nevertheless, if there was an event equivalent to an acquittal, which terminated jeopardy in the original proceeding, a second trial is barred. The dismissal of the first indictment for failure to state an offense was not such an event. Because the government has yet to have its one opportunity to obtain a conviction, the district court properly denied Miles\u2019 motion to dismiss.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b822-11\">I. BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b822-12\">In 2001, Miles, an anesthesiology resident in New York, traveled to Cambodia, where he met a fourteen-year-old girl, S.K., to whom he proposed marriage. The giri\u2019s family agreed to the proposal and the two were married in a traditional Cambodian wedding ceremony. Two months later, after Miles obtained a passport for S.K., allegedly based on a misrepresenta<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"799\">*799</page-number>tion of her age, Miles and S.K. traveled together to New York. The two were married in a ceremony there, again allegedly based on a misrepresentation of S.K.\u2019s age. In June 2002, Miles accepted employment as an anesthesiologist at the Jackson County Memorial Hospital in Altus, Oklahoma. Miles and S.K. traveled to Oklahoma together where they lived as husband and wife.</p>\n<p id=\"b823-5\">In an indictment filed on November 16, 2005, Miles was charged with one count of violating the Mann Act, which prohibits the knowing transportation of a minor in interstate commerce \u201cwith intent that the individual engage in ... any sexual activity for which any person can be charged with a criminal offense under the laws of [any state]....\u201d 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2423(a). The indictment charged:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b823-6\">In or about July of 2002, in the Western District of Oklahoma and elsewhere, ALEXANDER CHRISTIAN MILES, knowingly transported a girl who had not attained the age of 18 years in interstate commerce with the intent that the girl engage in sexual activity for which the defendant could be charged with a criminal offense, in that, the defendant transported a 15-year old Cambodian girl from New York City to Altus, Oklahoma, with the intent to engage in sexual intercourse with the girl for which acts the defendant could be charged with a criminal offense under the laws of the State of Oklahoma.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b823-9\">(Appellant\u2019s App. at 8.) Despite its lack of specificity as to the assimilated Oklahoma statute(s) Miles neither moved to dismiss the indictment nor requested a bill of particulars during the four months the indictment was pending.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b823-10\">On April 3, 2006, one week prior to jury selection, the government filed proposed jury instructions which identified the specific Oklahoma statutes Miles allegedly violated\u2014the statutory rape statute, Okla Stat. tit. 21, \u00a7 1111(A)(1) (defining statutory rape as \u201can act of sexual intercourse ... accomplished with a male or female who is not the spouse of the perpetrator ... [w]here the victim is under sixteen (16) years of age ... \u201d), and the lewd acts statute, Okla. Stat. tit. 21, \u00a7 1123(A)(2) (making it a crime to \u201cknowingly and intentionally ... [l]ook upon, touch, maul, or feel the body or private parts of any child under sixteen (16) years of age in any lewd or lascivious manner ... \u201d).<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b823-11\">One week later, on April 10, a jury was \u201cempaneled and admonished\u201d and sent home with instructions to return a week later to begin the trial. No argument or evidence was presented. Before the jury returned to hear the case, Miles moved to dismiss the indictment for failure to state an offense, arguing the government could not prove he committed statutory rape or lewd molestation under Oklahoma law because marriage is a defense to both <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"800\">*800</page-number>crimes.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> In response the government argued the marriages were a sham and their validity was an issue for the jury. In the alternative, the government argued the indictment did not mention the violation of any specific Oklahoma statute and, based on recently discovered evidence, it could prove Miles forcibly raped his putative wife (an offense for which marriage is no defense) in violation of Okla. Stat. tit. 21, \u00a7 1111(B) (defining rape as \u201can act of sexual intercourse accomplished with a male or female <em>who is the spouse of the perpetrator </em>if force or violence is used or threatened ... \u201d) (emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b824-4\">The government submitted new jury instructions based on its forcible rape theory, even though the indictment did not mention the use of force. Miles was unaware of the government\u2019s forcible rape theory and its evidence supporting that theory. Understandably, he complained.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> He filed a written response to the government\u2019s newly proposed jury instructions. It began: \u201cThe Indictment is void on its face for failure to state a charge. By failing to specify which provision of Oklahoma law Dr. Miles allegedly violated, the grand jury failed to charge an offense as required by Rule 7, Fed.R.Crim.P., and the due process clause. The United States has demonstrated the flaw in the charging process by changing its theory of the case, from statutory rape to rape by force.\u201d (W.D. Okla. Doc. No. 47 at 1-Am. Resp. to Government\u2019s Supp. Br. Regarding Jury Instructions) (emphasis in original).<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> Miles argued the indictment was deficient because it failed to give fair notice of forcible rape and its lack of specificity would not enable him to assert acquittal or conviction as a double jeopardy bar to another prosecution, citing <em>United States v. Poole, </em>929 F.2d 1476, 1479 (10th Cir.1991). Miles complained: \u201cIf convicted of whatever charges the Government ultimately settles on, Dr. Miles is facing a long period of incarceration.... The United States cannot levy such grave accusations against a defendant in terms so vague and indistinct. This error cannot be cured through a bill of particulars since a bill of particular cannot save an invalid indictment. <em>Russell [v. United States, </em>369 U.S. 749, 769-70, 82 S.Ct. 1038, 8 L.Ed.2d 240 (1962) ].\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at 3.) Miles requested a judgment of acquittal.</p>\n<p id=\"b824-10\">The trial judge expressed general concern about the sufficiency of the indictment because it failed to identify the Oklahoma statute(s) allegedly violated. But he specifically decided the government could not proceed on the forcible rape theory identified in its alternative proposed jury instructions because the indictment contained no allegation of forcible sexual intercourse. Miles was thus deprived of proper notice of the alleged crime.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> The <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"801\">*801</page-number>judge explained: \u201cThe government\u2019s shifting theories for avoiding the impact of the marriage alleged in this case either fall short as a matter of law [the marriages were at most voidable, not void] or involve attempts to establish liability based on matters not alleged in the indictment, contrary to the Fifth and Sixth Amendments.\u201d (Appellant\u2019s App. at 15.) Accordingly he dismissed the indictment, concluding it \u201cd[id] not state an offense and [wa]s therefore fatally defective.\u201d <em>(Id.)</em></p>\n<p id=\"b825-5\">On April 18, 2006, while Miles was in the process of being released from jail, he was arrested under a new indictment (this case). The second indictment was the same as the first but for two changes. First, it contained an additional paragraph in the \u201cINTRODUCTION\u201d: \u201cIn New York and elsewhere, the defendant engaged in acts of sexual intercourse with the girl through use of force and threatened use of force.\u201d<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> <em>(Id. </em>at 17.) Second, it specifically referenced two particular statutes alleged to have been violated\u2014 Okla. Stat. tit. 21, \u00a7\u00a7 1111(B) and 1114.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> Marriage is not a defense to those crimes.</p>\n<p id=\"b825-10\">Miles moved to dismiss the second indictment and acquit \u201cdue to want of jurisdiction and double jeopardy.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at 23.) The court denied his motion, concluding the dismissal of the first indictment was not \u201ctantamount to an acquittal,\u201d and instead \u201camounted to a bare dismissal of the charge based on the inadequacy of the indictment.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at 45-46.) Miles contends this was error.</p>\n<p id=\"b826-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"802\">*802</page-number>II. DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b826-4\">\u201cWe review de novo the district court\u2019s denial of a motion to dismiss an indictment on double jeopardy grounds.\u201d <em>United States v. McAleer, </em>138 F.3d 852, 855 (10th Cir.1998). The defendant has the burden of establishing double jeopardy. <em>United States v. Jones, </em>816 F.2d 1483, 1486 (10th Cir.1987).</p>\n<p id=\"b826-5\">The first question in a double jeopardy analysis is whether jeopardy has attached. The government concedes jeopardy attached, as the jury was empaneled and sworn before the first indictment was dismissed. <em>See United States v. Bizzell, </em>921 F.2d 263, 266 (10th Cir.1990).</p>\n<p id=\"b826-6\">The next, and critical, question is whether jeopardy terminated in a way that prevents re-indictment and re-prosecution. <em>See Illinois v. Somerville, </em>410 U.S. 458, 467, 93 S.Ct. 1066, 35 L.Ed.2d 425 (1973) (\u201c[T]he conclusion that jeopardy has attached begins, rather than ends, the inquiry as to whether the Double Jeopardy Clause bars retrial.\u201d).<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> \u201c[T]he protection of the Double Jeopardy Clause by its terms applies only if there has been some event, such as an acquittal, which terminates the original jeopardy.\u201d <em>Richardson v. United States, </em>468 U.S. 317, 325, 104 S.Ct. 3081, 82 L.Ed.2d 242 (1984). This rule has been extended to apply to the functional equivalents of acquittals. <em>See Smalis v. Pennsylvania, </em>476 U.S. 140, 143, 106 S.Ct. 1745, 90 L.Ed.2d 116 (1986) (concluding \u201ca demurrer is not the functional equivalent of an acquittal\u201d and therefore double jeopardy is no bar to an appeal); <em>Burks, </em>437 U.S. at 16, 98 S.Ct. 2141 (holding retrial barred where conviction following jury trial reversed for insufficient evidence because that is the functional equivalent of an acquittal); <em>United States v. Marchese, </em>46 F.3d 1020, 1023 (10th Cir.1995) (holding retrial not barred on double jeopardy grounds because the court\u2019s dismissal of the indictment \u201cdid not act as the functional equivalent of an acquittal\u201d). Since Miles was not acquitted this case turns on whether the dismissal of the first indictment was the functional equivalent of an acquittal.</p>\n<p id=\"b826-10\">On April 11, 2006, after the jury was sworn and sent home, Miles made an oral motion to dismiss the indictment but in subsequent written materials requested a judgment of acquittal.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> Significantly, a judgment of acquittal was not forthcom<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"803\">*803</page-number>ing.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> Instead, being sensitive to Miles expressed Constitutional arguments about fair notice, the judge dismissed the indictment for failure to state an offense. He later characterized the dismissal order as not \u201ctantamount to an acquittal,\u201d but rather, \u201ca bare dismissal of the charge.\u201d (Appellant\u2019s App. at 46.)</p>\n<p id=\"b827-5\">\u201c[Wjhat constitutes an \u2018acquittal\u2019 is not to be controlled by the form of the judge\u2019s action.\u201d <em>United States v. Martin Linen Supply Co., </em>430 U.S. 564, 571, 97 S.Ct. 1349, 51 L.Ed.2d 642 (1977). \u201cRather, [the reviewing court] must determine whether the ruling of the judge, whatever its label, actually represents a resolution, correct or not, of some or all of the factual elements of the offense charged.\u201d <em>Id.; see, e.g., United States v. Appawoo, </em>553 F.2d 1242, 1246 (10th Cir.1977) (concluding a \u201cjudgment of acquittal\u201d was in fact a dismissal because it was based on legal issues raised before trial, not on facts developed at trial). While the form of the judge\u2019s ruling is not controlling, it does inform the debate. <em>See Sanabria, </em>437 U.S. at 66, 98 S.Ct. 2170 (\u201cWhile form is not to be exalted over substance in determining the double jeopardy consequences of a ruling terminating a prosecution, neither is it appropriate entirely to ignore the form of order entered by the trial court.\u201d) (citations omitted). In <em>Sanabria </em>the trial court\u2019s denomination of its decision as a \u201cjudgment of acquittal\u201d was significant. <em>See id. </em>at 66-69, 98 S.Ct. 2170. Likewise here, the form of the dismissal order (\u201ca bare dismissal of the charge\u201d not \u201ctantamount to an acquittal\u201d) as well as the judge\u2019s expressed rationale for doing so (the indictment failed to give fair warning of forcible rape) are significant. The judge\u2019s ruling was consistent with the long-standing rule that the dismissal of a defective indictment corrects a trial error and does not bar retrial.</p>\n<p id=\"b827-8\">In <em>Ball v. United States, </em>two of three co-defendants were convicted by a jury but their convictions were reversed on a motion by the defendants due to a fatal defect in the indictment. 163 U.S. 662, 664-65, 16 S.Ct. 1192, 41 L.Ed. 300 (1896). The Supreme Court held the reversal was no bar to retrial because \u201cit is quite clear that a defendant who procures a judgment against him upon an indictment to be set aside may be tried anew upon the same indictment, or upon another indictment, for the same offense of which he had been convicted.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 671, 16 S.Ct. 1192. In <em>Burks, </em>the Supreme Court explained \u201c[t]he reversal in <em>Ball </em>was ... based not on insufficiency of evidence but rather on trial error, <em>i.e., </em>failure to dismiss a faulty indictment.\u201d 437 U.S. at 14, 98 S.Ct. 2141. The <em>Burks </em>Court clarified that a reversal due to insufficient evidence bars retrial but a reversal due to trial error does not. <em>See id. </em>at 15-16, 98 S.Ct. 2141.</p>\n<p id=\"b827-9\">The circumstances here are admittedly different\u2014Ball and his co-defendant were convicted, Miles was not even tried. Nevertheless, the <em>Burks </em>Court was clear in characterizing the dismissal of a faulty indictment as a trial error which presents no bar to a subsequent prosecution. <em>Id. </em>at 15, 98 S.Ct. 2141; <em>accord Somerville, </em>410 U.S. at 459, 93 S.Ct. 1066.</p>\n<p id=\"b827-10\">But Miles has a different twist. He argues the dismissal of the first indictment is the functional equivalent of an acquittal because the court made a \u201cfactual resolution that the government could not prove a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"804\">*804</page-number>necessary element that an unlawful sexual act under Oklahoma law had occurred.\u201d (Appellant\u2019s Br. at 17.)</p>\n<p id=\"b828-4\">The details of Miles\u2019 argument are intricate. He first claims, because of its introductory language, the first indictment can only be read to charge rape in the second degree, which exempts a spouse from its reach. But the introductory language makes no difference. We recently explained: \u201cAn indictment need not contain introductory or prefatory matter at all ... so if it does such matter is perforce superfluous unless expressly incorporated into one of the counts.\u201d <em>United States v. Red-corn, </em>528 F.3d 727, 735 (10th Cir.2008). Next he claims that in acknowledging the marriage defense the court made a factual finding\u2014Miles and the alleged victim were married. According to Miles, the fact of his marriage, regardless of how it came to be known by the court, is a \u201cfinding\u201d triggering the double jeopardy bar. Specifically he argues,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b828-5\">[I]n <em>United States v. Martin Linen, </em>430 U.S. 564, 97 S.Ct. 1349, 51 L.Ed.2d 642 (1977), the test is put that a defendant is acquitted when the ruling of the judge, whatever its label, actually represents a resolution [in the defendant\u2019s favor], correct or not, of some or all of the factual elements of the offense charged.... Thus, applying substance over form to a district judge\u2019s judgement of acquittal, appeal is barred if the court evaluated the Government\u2019s evidence and determined that it was legally insufficient to sustain a conviction.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b828-6\">(Appellant\u2019s Br. at 10) (emphasis omitted). We are not persuaded.</p>\n<p id=\"b828-7\">In responding to Miles\u2019 motion to dismiss the first indictment because of the marriage defense the government presented two arguments: (1) the marriages were a sham and the validity of the New York marriage was a factual issue the jury should decide; (2) the forcible rape theory rendered the marriage issue irrelevant.</p>\n<p id=\"b828-10\">The judge rejected the government\u2019s first argument, concluding the New York marriage was voidable, not void. The fact of the marriage was never at issue\u2014its legal significance was the tipping point. Thus, he did not consider the validity of the marriage to be a fact the jury should decide. The judge took no evidence and refused to make, or even consider making, a factual determination on the issue. But the marriage is beside the point with respect to the government\u2019s second argument.</p>\n<p id=\"b828-11\">The government argued the first indictment was worded broadly enough to encompass forcible rape and it could prove forcible rape if permitted to proceed to trial. The trial judge rejected that argument, but not because the forcible rape theory was untenable or unprovable. Instead, he agreed with Miles that the first indictment failed to state an offense, requiring Miles to go to trial on the forcible rape theory would violate his Constitutional rights, and the deficiencies in the first indictment could not be remedied by a bill of particulars.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> <em>See supra </em>at 7.</p>\n<p id=\"b828-12\">Contrary to Miles\u2019 argument, which the dissent adopts as its central thesis, the first indictment was not dismissed based on the \u201cfact\u201d (stipulated or otherwise) of marriage. It was based on the failure of the indictment to provide fair warning to Miles that he must defend against forcible rape allegations. There was no adjudica<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"805\">*805</page-number>tion of any fact going to the merits of the charge against Miles, which is an essential ingredient of a claim of double jeopardy. <em>See Martin Linen, </em>430 U.S. at 571, 97 S.Ct. 1349.</p>\n<p id=\"b829-5\">The lynchpin of Miles\u2019 argument is that the first indictment charged a violation of the Mann Act premised on, and only on, a violation of Oklahoma\u2019s statutory rape law. He had good reason to assume that was the case because of the government\u2019s posture, but that is not what the indictment charged. It did not specify any particular Oklahoma statute. Miles could have timely forced the government to be more precise, but he did not. Nevertheless, he was justifiably distressed with the government\u2019s eleventh hour change in tactics. And he was entitled to appropriate relief. Such relief might have included a postponement of the trial to give him an opportunity to meet the unanticipated theory and evidence. But that is not the relief he requested. The trial judge was sympathetic to his situation and, in accord with his arguments, imposed a stiff (and appropriate) sanction against the government\u2014 dismissal of the indictment. Appropriate relief did not, and does not, include immunity from trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b829-6\">This case is much like <em>Lee v. United States, </em>where the Supreme Court held a second prosecution was not barred if the first proceeding was terminated at the defendant\u2019s request after jeopardy had attached. 432 U.S. 23, 97 S.Ct. 2141, 53 L.Ed.2d 80 (1977). Immediately prior to the attachment of jeopardy, Lee\u2019s counsel moved to dismiss the information for failure to charge knowledge or intent. <em>Id. </em>at 25, 97 S.Ct. 2141. The court tentatively denied the motion due to its late timing and proceeded with a bench trial. <em>Id. </em>at 26, 97 S.Ct. 2141. At the conclusion of the trial, the court had no question about the defendant\u2019s guilt, but nonetheless dismissed the information for failure to charge knowledge or intent. <em>Id. </em>In deciding whether double jeopardy barred a second prosecution, the Supreme Court explained \u201c[t]he critical question is whether the order contemplates an end to all prosecution of the defendant for the offense charged.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 30, 97 S.Ct. 2141. The Court answered that question in the negative:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b829-10\">The dismissal clearly was not predicated on any judgment that Lee could never be prosecuted for or convicted of the [crime charged]. To the contrary, the District Court stressed that the only obstacle to a conviction was the fact that the information had been drawn improperly. The error, like any prosecutorial or judicial error that necessitates a mistrial, was one that could be avoided\u2014 absent any double jeopardy bar\u2014-by beginning anew the prosecution of the defendant. And there can be little doubt that the court granted the motion to dismiss in this case in contemplation of just such a second prosecution.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b829-11\"><em>Id. </em>at 30-31, 97 S.Ct. 2141.</p>\n<p id=\"b829-12\">Like in <em>Lee, </em>the district court here did not intend for its dismissal of the first indictment to bar re-indictment and re-prosecution of Miles. The court stated in its order of dismissal that it took \u201cno pleasure in this disposition.\u201d (Appellant\u2019s App. at 15.) Miles \u201cplainly deserves substantial exposure to the criminal justice system.\u201d <em>(Id.) </em>The error in the indictment\u2014whether described as failure to state an offense or insufficient specificity\u2014was one that could have been avoided and thus, a second prosecution is not barred. <em>See United States v. Bowline, </em>593 F.2d 944, 949 (10th Cir. 1979) (re-indictment not barred where indictment is dismissed based on validity of charge, not merits of the ease, because such dismissal \u201cis not distinguishable from <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"806\">*806</page-number>a motion for a mistrial made by the defendant\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b830-4\">The case of <em>Illinois v. Somerville, </em>410 U.S. 458, 93 S.Ct. 1066, 35 L.Ed.2d 425 (1973), is even more telling. After the jury was sworn but before evidence was presented, the prosecutor realized the indictment was fatally defective because it failed to allege intent. <em>Id. </em>at 459, 93 S.Ct. 1066. The prosecutor moved for a mistrial, which was granted over the defendant\u2019s objection. The case was retried in spite of the defendant\u2019s claim of double jeopardy and the defendant was convicted. The case arrived at the Supreme Court on federal habeas. The Court saw no double jeopardy bar to the second trial: \u201c[T]he trial judge terminated the proceeding because a defect was found to exist in the indictment that was, as a matter of Illinois law, not curable by amendment.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 468, 93 S.Ct. 1066. Here the indictment was dismissed at Miles\u2019 urging, not over his objection.</p>\n<p id=\"b830-5\">Miles argued before the trial court that the flaws in the first indictment (failure to allege force and failure to specify the Oklahoma statute(s) allegedly violated) were of constitutional dimension and could not be cured by amendment or a bill of particulars. The dismissal of the indictment was thus akin to the mistrial declared in <em>Somerville. </em>Because it was done upon Miles\u2019 request, not over his objection, the circumstances favoring retrial are even more compelling here. The <em>Somerville </em>Court stated: \u201cThe interests of the public in seeing that a criminal prosecution proceed</p>\n<p id=\"b830-7\">to verdict, either of acquittal or conviction, need not be forsaken by the formulation or application of rigid rules that necessarily preclude the vindication of that interest.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 463, 93 S.Ct. 1066. In reaching its decision the <em>Somerville </em>Court acknowledged \u201cthe interest of the defendant in having his fate determined by the jury first impaneled is itself a weighty one.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 471, 93 S.Ct. 1066. Miles expressed no interest in having his fate determined by the jury first impaneled.</p>\n<p id=\"b830-8\">In <em>United States v. Kehoe, </em>the Fifth Circuit considered \u201cwhether the double jeopardy clause prohibits further prosecution of defendants who procure the mid-trial dismissal of the indictment on the ground that it fails to state an offense.\u201d 516 F.2d 78, 83 (5th Cir.1975). The court held a second trial was not barred, focusing in particular on the fact it was the defendants who challenged the indictment, and they did so only after the jury was sworn. <em>Id. </em>at 86. Likewise here, Miles moved for dismissal of the indictment after the jury was sworn, despite the fact he had almost a week to review the government\u2019s first proposed jury instructions and make his motion before jeopardy attached. Had Miles moved to dismiss the indictment before the jury was sworn there would be little room for a double jeopardy argument.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> And nothing changed in the intervening period. Miles allowed himself to be placed in jeopardy by not moving to dismiss the indictment prior to the attachment of jeopardy. It appears to have been a calculated strategy.</p>\n<p id=\"b831-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"807\">*807</page-number>In <em>Wilkett v. United, States, </em>we considered a double jeopardy question similar to the one presented here. 655 F.2d 1007 (10th Cir.1981). There, two of three defendants charged with conspiracy in the Western District of Oklahoma moved to dismiss the indictment for lack of venue at the end of the government\u2019s case. <em>Id. </em>at 1009. The court granted their motion and the defendants were then indicted in the Eastern District for substantially the same conduct. We held jeopardy had not terminated in the first proceeding in such a way as to prevent re-indictment and re-prosecution because \u201c[t]he termination of the case was not a resolution, correct or not, of some or all of the federal elements of the offense charged.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1011-12 (quotations omitted). We noted the defendants \u201cwere responsible for the dismissal\u201d and \u201cthe dismissal was not predicated upon the merits of the case, that is, the insufficiency of the evidence to convict.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1011. The dismissal was instead predicated on the government\u2019s failure to establish venue, which \u201cis a question of procedure, more than anything else, and ... does not either prove or disprove the guilt of the accused.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Like the defendants in <em>Wilkett, </em>Miles himself brought about the termination of the first proceeding on a basis other than adjudication of his guilt or innocence.</p>\n<p id=\"b831-5\">Miles calls attention to two of our cases, claiming they support his position. In both <em>United States v. Hunt, </em>212 F.3d 539 (10th Cir.2000), and <em>United States v. Fay, </em>553 F.2d 1247 (10th Cir.1977), the district judge found the evidence insufficient to sustain the charges and entered judgments of acquittal. In both cases we concluded the acquittals were not merely a matter of form, but of substance. We fail to see how either <em>Hunt </em>or <em>Fay </em>appreciably advance Miles\u2019 argument since the judge here correctly referred to his order as a \u201cbare dismissal,\u201d not an acquittal.</p>\n<p id=\"b831-6\">Miles also makes an \u201callowable unit of prosecution\u201d argument citing <em>Sanabna, </em>437 U.S. 54, 98 S.Ct. 2170, and an argument under <em>Blockburger v. United States, </em>284 U.S. 299, 52 S.Ct. 180, 76 L.Ed. 306 (1932). In a single count indictment Sanabria was charged with illegal gambling based upon allegations of numbers betting and horse race betting. <em>Sanabria, </em>437 U.S. at 57, 98 S.Ct. 2170. After hearing evidence the trial judge dismissed the numbers theory and later entered a judgment of acquittal as to horse betting. The question before the Supreme Court was whether Sanabria could again be tried for illegal gambling based upon his participation in numbers betting. In resolving the issue the Court looked at the allowable unit of prosecution in deciding the second trial was barred. Critical to the decision was the acquittal on the horse race betting. <em>Id. </em>at 64-65, 98 S.Ct. 2170. Until there has been an acquittal (or a conviction) the allowable unit of prosecution question is not ripe. Since Miles was neither convicted nor acquitted on the original indictment the allowable unit of prosecution is not in play here. Miles is attempting to put the cart in front of the horse. His <em>Blockburger </em>argument is of similar ilk.</p>\n<p id=\"b831-7\">Under the <em>Blockburger </em>\u201csame evidence\u201d test, the double jeopardy bar applies where a defendant is subjected to successive prosecutions for multiple offenses \u201cif the facts alleged in one would sustain a conviction if offered in support of the other.\u201d <em>United States v. Mintz, </em>16 F.3d 1101, 1104 (10th Cir.1994) (quotations omitted). This problem only presents itself where jeopardy terminated in the first prosecution in such a way as to prevent re-indictment and re-prosecution. <em>See Wood, </em>958 F.2d at 974 (\u201c[T]he double jeopardy test for subsequent prosecutions ... is not applicable when the defendant has not been convicted.... The Supreme Court has <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"808\">*808</page-number>looked to whether the subsequent prosecution was based on the same conduct of an earlier prosecution only when the earlier prosecution resulted in a conviction or acquittal.\u201d). Here, as previously discussed, it did not.</p>\n<p id=\"b832-4\">Miles cites <em>United States v. Genser, </em>710 F.2d 1426 (10th Cir.1983), in support of his <em>Blockburger </em>argument, but that case is inapposite because the charges in <em>Genser </em>were dismissed due to insufficiency of the evidence, the equivalent of an acquittal. <em>See Burks, </em>437 U.S. at 16, 98 S.Ct. 2141. In <em>Genser </em>we said, \u201cIn the case before us, the Government does not argue that the trial court\u2019s dismissal of the first action was on other than factual grounds.\u201d 710 F.2d at 1428. \u201c[T]he government conceded ... that although the case was \u2018dismissed,\u2019 it is clear from the record that the decision was a factual one\u2014a recognition that the government was unable to prove that the defendant was a dispenser as defined by statute.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(quotations omitted). The only issue in <em>Genser </em>was whether \u201cthe offense charged and tried in the first prosecution is identical in law to that charged in the second.\u201d <em>Id. Genser </em>does not inform this debate\u2014whether the dismissal here was equivalent to an acquittal.</p>\n<p id=\"b832-5\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b821-17\"> This order and judgment is not binding precedent. 10th Cir.

As the majority opinion states at p. 13, we \u201c\u2018must determine whether the ruling of the judge, whatever its label, actually represents a resolution, correct or not, of some or all of the factual elements of the offense charged.\u2019 \u201d <em>United States v. Martin Linen Supply Co., </em>430 U.S. 564, 571, 97 S.Ct. 1349, 51 L.Ed.2d 642 (1977). Here clearly the reason that the district judge dismissed the first indictment was the <em>fact </em>that the defendant and the alleged victim were married. This stipulated fact, due to operation of Oklahoma law, meant there was not a violation, as alleged, of the Mann Act. Thus a solid basis for a double jeopardy defense against prosecution under the second indictment was clear. The denial of the defendant\u2019s timely and proper motion to dismiss, invoking his double jeopardy defense, was error, and the ruling on the second indictment, with its new theory, must be reversed in this <em>Abney </em>appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b832-9\">Here, the second indictment\u2019s shift to adopt a new theory does not free the Government from the restrictions of the Double Jeopardy Clause. The second indictment added a new paragraph. It was, nevertheless, predicated, on the same basic circumstances. The new Introduction alleged, <em>inter alia, </em>that \u201cthe defendant engaged in acts of sexual intercourse with the girl through the use of force and threatened use of force ...\u201d citing Oklahoma Stat. tit. 21, \u00a7\u00a7 1111(B) and 1114(A)(3). Double jeopardy based on the resolution against the Government of some or all of the factual elements of the offense as first charged bars any later prosecution under the Mann Act for the same sexual conduct \u201ceven if based on a different theory....\u201d <em>United States v. Hunt, </em>212 F.3d 539, 547 (10th Cir.2000).</p>\n<p id=\"b832-11\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b832-12\">If the fact of the marriage of Miles and S.K. had been contested and the Government had put on evidence that the couple were not married, then a determination by the judge that the Government\u2019s evidence was insufficient on the issue would stand as a bar to further prosecution under the basic principle of double jeopardy jurisprudence. I am satisfied that it makes no difference that the insufficiency of the Government\u2019s evidence is established by a stipulated fact. In <em>United States v. Ogles, </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"809\">*809</page-number>440 F.3d 1095 (9th Cir.2006) <em>(en </em>banc), the court specifically rejected the contention that a factual determination which amounts to an acquittal must be of a <em>contested </em>fact:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b833-5\">The government suggests that because Ogles did not contest his licensed status, the district court\u2019s ruling did not meet the Supreme Court\u2019s definition of acquittal'\u2014that \u201cwhatever its label, [it] actually represents a resolution, correct or not, of some or all of the factual elements of the offense charged.\u201d <em>[United States v. Martin Linen Supply Co., </em>430 U.S. at 571, 97 S.Ct. 1349], The Court\u2019s double jeopardy decisions do not, however, condition an acquittal under Rule 29(a) on the district court\u2019s examination of contested facts. Here, the district court determined that a factual element of the offense had not been proved by the government. What is this if not a \u201cresolution\u201d?</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b833-6\">440 F.3d at 1104.</p>\n<p id=\"b833-7\">The Government here contends that the trial court\u2019s ruling was not on any matter of evidence but only on a legal issue. In <em>Ogles </em>the Government similarly argued that the district court\u2019s judgment of acquittal of a charge of selling firearms without a license was based on a legal determination, specifically that the term \u201clicensed dealer\u201d in the statute was not location specific. The defendant was licensed in California but prosecuted for a sale he had made in Arizona. Thus, in one sense, the district court\u2019s judgment of acquittal was based on a legal issue, the interpretation of the statute that a license to sell is not restricted to the state of the licensee\u2019s residence. But that legal ruling was simply preliminary, the Ninth Circuit held, to the <em>factual </em>determination that the Government\u2019s evidence was insufficient for a conviction. 440 F.3d at 1103. So too, in this case, the district court\u2019s ruling dismissing the first indictment is best viewed, I conclude, as a determination that the Government would be unable to prove an essential element of the offense (that there was no marriage).</p>\n<p id=\"b833-10\">In my view, the dismissal of the first indictment was based on a finding of fact: the undisputed fact that the Defendant was married to the alleged victim. This case is unusual, in that it is true the fact-based decision of the marriage was made before any evidence had been taken. But no evidence was required to establish that critical fact: it was stipulated. The legal consequences thus are the same as if the government\u2019s evidence had been heard. The district judge\u2019s decision was a determination that the Government\u2019s evidence was insufficient to prove the charged offense. If this be so, as I am convinced is the case, then the ruling was the equivalent of an acquittal, and the constitutional protection against double jeopardy unquestionably bars the Government\u2019s second attempt to prosecute the Defendant.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"810\">*810</page-number>Government had one full opportunity to prosecute the defendant,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> and the Double Jeopardy Clause protected him against such further prosecution.</p>\n<p id=\"b834-4\">Ill</p>\n<p id=\"b834-5\">In the second indictment, the Government shifted gears. It had lost on its first attempt to convict the defendant due to the determination that marriage barred conviction under the Oklahoma statutory rape statute, 21 Okla. Stat. \u00a7 1111(A)(1), and under Oklahoma\u2019s lewd acts statute, 21 Okla. Stat. \u00a7 1123. The Government cannot rely on \u201cshift[ing] theories for avoiding the impact of the marriage\u201d, App. at 13-14, Br. of the United States 16, \u00b6 2, as the district judge stated. I am convinced that the perception of the district judge points to the proper analysis under the Double Jeopardy Clause.</p>\n<p id=\"b834-6\">The shift to the new theory of forcible rape is barred by the analysis in <em>United States v. Hunt, </em>212 F.3d 539 (10th Cir. 2000). There prosecution for theft from the mail was sought under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1708. During a bench trial the court entered judgment which stated: \u201cI find and conclude that the defendants are not guilty under the indictment as charged.\u201d The judge concluded that the indictment alleged a theft from CTC distributor\u2019s facility. It was further concluded that CTC was not part of the mail as required for the charged offense, and the indictment failed to allege any other theft from the mail, as suggested by the Government. The defendants asserted that the Double Jeopardy Clause barred the appeal, and this court agreed.</p>\n<p id=\"b834-9\">In doing so we relied on <em>Sanabria v. United States, </em>437 U.S. 54, 98 S.Ct. 2170, 57 L.Ed.2d 43 (1978). There the Government charged the defendant with conducting an illegal gambling business in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1955. The indictment had alleged two types <em>of </em>illegal gambling activities: horse betting and numbers betting in violation of Massachusetts law. After trial began, the defendant moved for acquittal, arguing that there was no evidence of horse betting, a proper basis for the illegal gambling charge, it having been determined that numbers betting was not prohibited by the Massachusetts code. The Government conceded there could be no review of the district court ruling that there was insufficient evidence of the defendant\u2019s involvement with horse betting. The Government argued it was entitled to a new trial on the numbers betting charge. The Supreme Court disagreed. A judgment of acquittal which had been entered barred further prosecution on any aspect of the count and hence barred appellate review of any trial court error.</p>\n<p id=\"b835-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"811\">*811</page-number>Although the Supreme Court held that the Government \u201ccould prove the offense in more than one way (by demonstrating numbers betting, horse betting or other betting), an acquittal of the offense of participation in illegal betting barred prosecution for participation in illegal gambling even if based on a different theory.\u201d 437 U.S. at 69, 98 S.Ct. 2170. Thus, <em>Hunt </em>correctly followed the holding of <em>Sanabria.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b835-5\">From precedent of the Supreme Court and our court it is clear that the shift to a new theory is impermissible as a basis for avoiding the protection of the Double Jeopardy Clause for the defendant Miles, as for the defendants in other cases.</p>\n<p id=\"b835-6\">Accordingly, I must respectfully dissent.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b833-8\">. In my view, the two indictments charge a single violation of the Mann Act, even though the kind of violation of state law, <em>i.e., </em>the specific type of rape alleged, differed. <em>See Sanabria v. United States, </em>437 U.S. 54, 73, 98 S.Ct. 2170, 57 L.Ed.2d 43 (1978) (prosecution had \"charged only a single gambling business\" that was illegal under state law, although the state law could have been violated by either a \"numbers\" game or by gambling on horse racing); <em>United States v. Hunt, </em>212 F.3d 539 (10th Cir.2000) (acquittal of charge of theft from the mail would prohibit second prosecution for same theft on different theory).</p>\n<p id=\"b833-12\">The government here does not argue that the second indictment stated a different offense, so that prosecution under that indictment could proceed even if the dismissal of the first indictment were determined to be an acquittal, as I would hold it was. Instead, the Government argues, wrongly, that the dismissal of the first indictment was not an acquittal. (Brief of Plaintiff-Appellee at 29-34.)</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b834-7\">. The majority invokes Fed.R.Crim.P. 29(a), which provides that a motion for judgment of acquittal may be made either after the prosecution has rested or at the close of all evidence, to assert that the sufficiency of the government's evidence is \"not subject to judicial scrutiny\u201d at any earlier stage. I do not, of course, contend otherwise as a matter of proper procedure. But this point provides no support whatsoever for the majority's holding because defendant's double jeopardy rights are in no way dependent upon the correctness of the district court\u2019s judgment, nor on the correctness of any rulings underlying that judgment. Instead, -\"[w]here a midtrial dismissal is granted on the ground, correct or not, that the defendant simply cannot be convicted of the offense charged, <em>[United States v. J Jenkins </em>[,420 U.S. 358, 95 S.Ct. 1006, 43 L.Ed.2d 250 (1975)] establishes that further prosecution is barred by the Double Jeopardy Clause.\u201d Lee v. <em>United States, </em>432 U.S. 23, 30, 97 S.Ct. 2141, 53 L.Ed.2d 80 (1977). If the trial court's decision is in effect an acquittal, it would violate the Double Jeopardy clause to bring the defendant to trial again even if the acquittal had been \" 'based upon an egregiously erroneous foundation.' \u201d <em>Sanabria v. United States, </em>437 U.S. 54, 64, 98 S.Ct. 2170, 57 L.Ed.2d 43 (1978) (quoting <em>Fong Foo v. United States, </em>369 U.S. 141, 143, 82 S.Ct. 671, 7 L.Ed.2d 629 (1962)).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
