We have jurisdiction under 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252. We review for substantial evidence, <em>Dhital v. Mukasey, </em>532 F.3d 1044, 1051 (9th Cir. 2008), and we deny the petition for review.</p>\n<p id=\"b65-20\">The record does not compel the conclusion that Velasquez-Lomeli established extraordinary circumstances to excuse his late filed asylum application. <em>See </em>8 C.F.R. \u00a7 208.4(a)(5).</p>\n<p id=\"b65-21\">The record does not compel the conclusion that Velasquez-Lomeli suffered past persecution or has a clear probability of persecution on account of a protected ground. <em>See INS v. Elias-Zacarias, </em>502 U.S. 478, 481-82, 112 S.Ct. 812, 117 L.Ed.2d 38 (1992); <em>see also Dinu v. Ashcroft, </em>372 F.3d 1041,1044-45 (9th Cir.2004) (no well-founded fear based on a protected ground if government has a legitimate prosecutorial purpose). Therefore, his withholding of removal claim fails.</p>\n<p id=\"b65-22\">Substantial evidence supports the BIA\u2019s finding that Velasquez-Lomeli failed to establish that is more likely than not he would be tortured if returned to Mexico. <em>Singh v. Gonzales, </em>439 F.3d 1100, 1113 (9th Cir.2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b65-23\">We reject Velasquez-Lomeli\u2019s due process contention that the IJ was biased <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"42\">*42</page-number>when he considered an unauthenticated warrant fails for lack of prejudice. <em>See Lata v. INS, </em>204 F.3d 1241, 1246 (9th Cir.2000) (to prevail on a due process challenge an individual must show substantial prejudice).</p>\n<p id=\"b66-4\">PETITION FOR REVIEW DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b65-16\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9th Cir.
