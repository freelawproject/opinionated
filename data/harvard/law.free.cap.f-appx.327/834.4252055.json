The district court denied Defendant\u2019s motion to reduce sentence, a motion based on Amendment 706. He now appeals. The district court did not abuse its discretion by denying Defendant\u2019s motion; we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b859-11\">In 1996, police executed a warrant to search two motel rooms in Mobile, Alabama. In one of the rooms, police located Defendant, along with two other people; $9,004 in bundles of $1,000; approximately one gram of a white substance that field-tested positive for cocaine; and a ledger that appeared to be used for dealing drugs. Defendant claimed ownership of the currency.</p>\n<p id=\"b859-16\">Defendant\u2019s girlfriend, who was in the motel room with him, told police that she frequently traveled with Defendant as he sold cocaine from Atlanta to Mobile. Defendant\u2019s girlfriend and other witnesses provided extensive information about Defendant\u2019s drug-dealing. One associate told police that Defendant had transported crack cocaine from Atlanta to Mobile for almost three years, making approximately thirty trips carrying and selling between one-quarter and one-half kilogram of crack cocaine per trip. Based on this and other information, the Pre-Sentence Investigation report (\u201cPSI\u201d) stated that Defendant was involved with at least 7.5 kilograms of crack.</p>\n<p id=\"b859-17\">After a jury trial, Defendant was found guilty of one count of conspiracy to possess with intent to distribute crack cocaine. The court adopted the PSI\u2019s determinations that Defendant\u2019s total offense level was 38,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> his criminal history was category III, and his sentencing guideline range 292 to 365 months.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Defendant did not object. Noting that this drug conviction was Defendant\u2019s third, the court sentenced Defendant to 365 months. The conviction was affirmed on direct appeal. The district court later denied Defendant\u2019s 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255 motion and his attempt to obtain a Certificate of Appealability (\u201cCOA\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b859-18\">Defendant later filed a motion pursuant to 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582(c)(2) for retroactive application of Amendment 706 (as amended by Amendment 711), which can reduce a defendant\u2019s base offense level when the amount of crack attributable to the defendant is less than 4.5 kilograms. Because at least 7.5 kilograms of crack were attributed to Defendant, and because Defendant did not object to that amount, the district <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"836\">*836</page-number>court decided that Amendment 706 did not affect Defendant\u2019s guideline range. The court therefore denied Defendant\u2019s motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b860-4\">\u201cWe review a district court\u2019s decision not to reduce a sentence pursuant to \u00a7 3582(c)(2) for [an] abuse of discretion.\u201d <em>United States v. Moreno, </em>421 F.3d 1217, 1219 (11th Cir.2005). Under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582, a defendant\u2019s term of imprisonment may be reduced when the defendant was sentenced based on a guideline range that was later lowered by the Sentencing Commission, <em>if </em>the reduction is also consistent with the Commission\u2019s policies. <em>Id. </em>(emphasis added); <em>see also </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7 1B1.10. Through Amendment 706, which applies retroactively, the Sentencing Commission reduced by two the base offense level of certain crack cocaine offenses.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Defendant\u2019s offense does not qualify for reduction because the base offense level for the amount of crack attributed to him\u20147.5 kilograms\u2014remained at 38 even after Amendment 706. Because Defendant\u2019s guideline range did not change, the district court correctly determined that a sentence reduction was not authorized under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582(c)(2). <em>See </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7 lB1.10(a)(2)(B).</p>\n<p id=\"b860-5\">Defendant argues that the amount of crack attributed to him at sentencing should be revisited because, among other reasons, his counsel was ineffective for failing to object to the amount of crack listed in the PSI and adopted by the court. Yet the district court rejected Defendant\u2019s claim of ineffective assistance by denying Defendant\u2019s section 2255 petition and his request for COA. Moreover, Defendant\u2019s argument is squarely foreclosed by U.S.S.G. \u00a7 1B1.10(a)(3) (section 3582(c)(2) does \u201cnot constitute a full re-sentencing\u201d). <em>See also Moreno, </em>421 F.3d at 1220 (section 3582(c)(2) \u201cdoes not constitute <em>de novo </em>re[-]sentencing\u201d); <em>United States v. Vautier, </em>144 F.3d 756, 760 (11th Cir.1998) (original sentencing determinations remain except for newly amended guideline range).</p>\n<p id=\"b860-8\">Defendant also contends that under <em>United States v. Booker, </em>543 U.S. 220, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005), the Sentencing Commission\u2019s new guidelines\u2014including U.S.S.G. \u00a7 1B1.10\u2014are only advisory, and the district court may therefore re-examine settled sentencing issues. This Court has recently said, however, that <em>Booker </em>does \u201cnot address motions to reduce a sentence under \u00a7 3582(c)(2).\u201d <em>United States v. Melvin, </em>556 F.3d 1190, 1192-93 (11th Cir.2009). Therefore, a judge\u2019s discretion to reduce a sentence is limited by the strictures of section 3582(c)(2); and a \u201cproceeding under \u00a7 3582(c)(2) is not a full re[-]sentencing hearing.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1193. Accordingly, the district court could not reconsider Defendant\u2019s original sentencing determinations, such as the amount of drugs attributed to Defendant on the PSI.</p>\n<p id=\"b860-9\">Amendment 706 did not change the base offense level, and thus the guideline range, for the amount of drugs attributed to Defendant at sentencing. The district court did not abuse its discretion by denying Defendant\u2019s section 3582(c)(2) motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b860-10\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b859-12\">. Involvement with crack cocaine in excess of 1.5 kilograms then corresponded with a base offense level of 38. <em>See </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2D1.1(c)(1).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b859-19\">. Defendant\u2019s total offense level was based entirely on the applicable drug quantity; no aggravating or mitigating sentencing factors were deemed applicable.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b860-6\">. For example, when Defendant was originally sentenced, 1.5 kilograms or more of crack corresponded to a base offense level of 38. After Amendment 706, the base offense level for more than 1.5 and less than 4.5 kilograms of crack was reduced from 38 to 36. For crack quantities of 4.5 kilograms or higher, the base offense level remained at 38.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
