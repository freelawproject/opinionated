Gibson was sentenced to five concurrent terms of life imprisonment, plus a total of 1260 months\u2019 imprisonment to be served consecutively. Gibson challenges the district court\u2019s denial of his motion for a bill of particulars and the sufficiency of the evidence. Finding no error, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b416-20\">Gibson first challenges the district court\u2019s denial of his motion for a bill of particulars. Whether a bill of particulars wrongly was denied is reviewed for abuse of discretion. <em>See United States v. MacDougall, </em>790 F.2d 1135, 1153 (4th Cir. 1986). A bill of particulars is appropriate when an indictment fails to provide adequate information to allow a defendant to understand the charges and to avoid unfair surprise. <em>See United States v. Am. Waste Fibers Co., Inc., </em>809 F.2d 1044, 1047 (4th Cir.1987); <em>United States v. Jackson, </em>757 F.2d 1486, 1491 (4th Cir.1985); <em>United States v. Schembari, </em>484 F.2d 931, 934-35 (4th Cir.1973). \u201c[A] defendant may show <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"393\">*393</page-number>abuse of discretion ... by proving unfair surprise.\u201d <em>Jackson, </em>757 F.2d at 1491 (citing <em>Wong Tai v. United States, </em>278 U.S. 77, 82, 47 S.Ct. 300, 71 L.Ed. 545 (1927)).</p>\n<p id=\"b417-5\">We have thoroughly reviewed the record and find that Gibson has failed to demonstrate that he suffered any unfair surprise as a result of the district court\u2019s denial of his motion for a bill of particulars. We therefore find that the district court did not abuse its discretion in denying Gibson\u2019s motion for a bill of particulars.</p>\n<p id=\"b417-6\">Gibson also challenges the sufficiency of the evidence to support four of the counts of possession of cocaine base with intent to distribute, the count of distribution of cocaine base, and four of the counts of possession of a firearm in relation to a drug trafficking crime. We review de novo a district court\u2019s denial of a Fed.R.Crim.P. 29 motion. <em>United States v. Reid, </em>523 F.3d 310, 317 (4th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S.-, 129 S.Ct. 663, 172 L.Ed.2d 637 (2008). A defendant challenging the sufficiency of the evidence faces a heavy burden. <em>United States v. Beidler, </em>110 F.3d 1064, 1067 (4th Cir. 1997). The verdict of a jury must be sustained \u201cif, viewing the evidence in the light most favorable to the prosecution, the verdict is supported by \u2018substantial evidence.\u2019 \u201d <em>United States v. Smith, </em>451 F.3d 209, 216 (4th Cir.2006) (citations omitted). \u201c[Substantial evidence [i]s evidence that a reasonable finder of fact could accept as adequate and sufficient to support a conclusion of a defendant\u2019s guilt beyond a reasonable doubt.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Furthermore, \u201c[t]he jury, not the reviewing court, weighs the credibility of the evidence and resolves any conflicts in the evidence presented.\u201d <em>Beidler, </em>110 F.3d at 1067 (internal quotation marks and citation omitted). \u201cReversal for insufficient evidence is reserved for the rare case where the prosecution\u2019s failure is clear.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(internal quotation marks and citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b417-9\">With these standards in mind, we have thoroughly reviewed the trial transcript. Our review convinces us that the evidence supports the jury\u2019s verdict. <em>See United States v. Stephens, </em>482 F.3d 669, 673 (4th Cir.2007) (setting forth elements of \u00a7 924(c)(1) offense); <em>United States v. Alerre, </em>430 F.3d 681, 689 (4th Cir.2005) (discussing elements of offense of distribution of controlled substance); <em>United States v. Collins, </em>412 F.3d 515, 519 (4th Cir.2005) (discussing elements of possession with intent to distribute offense). We therefore find that the district court did not err in denying Gibson\u2019s Rule 29 motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b417-10\">Accordingly, we affirm the judgment of the district court. We also deny the motions for leave to file a pro se supplemental brief. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b417-11\">\n<em>AFFIRMED.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
