O\u2019BRIEN, Circuit Judge.</author>\n<p id=\"b805-29\">Eduardo Soto-Diarte, a federal prisoner appearing pro se and <em>in forma </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"782\">*782</page-number><em>pauperis (ifp), </em>seeks a certificate of appealability (COA) permitting him to appeal from the district court\u2019s dismissal of his \u00a7 2255 habeas petition. The petition claims Soto-Diarte received ineffective assistance of counsel during sentencing. The government filed a motion to enforce Soto-Diarte\u2019s waiver of appeal in his plea agreement. In response, Soto-Diarte claimed his attorney did not fully explain the waiver and, therefore, it was not voluntary. <em>See United States v. Cockerham,, </em>237 F.3d 1179, 1187 (10th Cir.2001) (\u201c[A] plea agreement waiver of postconviction rights does not waive the right to bring a \u00a7 2255 petition based on ineffective assistance of counsel claims challenging the validity of the plea or the waiver.\u201d). The record, however, demonstrates SotoDiarte specifically stated he understood and knowingly agreed to the waiver in his petition to plead guilty, in his plea agreement, and in a specific and extensive colloquy with the judge at his plea hearing. The district court determined Soto-Diarte was not entitled to federal habeas relief because he knowingly and voluntarily waived his right to collaterally attack his sentence in his plea agreement and enforcement of the waiver would not result in a miscarriage of justice. <em>See United States v. Hahn, </em>359 F.3d 1315, 1325 (10th Cir.2004) (en banc).
