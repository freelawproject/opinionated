For the reasons set forth below, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b867-16\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b867-17\">In 1999, Workman pled guilty to one count of distributing crack cocaine, in violation of 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 841(a)(1). The probation officer determined that Workman had a base offense level of 28 under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2D1.1 because he was responsible for at least 20, but less than 35, grams of crack cocaine. However, because Workman had two prior felony convictions for drug distribution, the probation officer found that he was a career offender under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4B1.1. Workman\u2019s status as a career offender gave him a new offense level of 34, which was reduced to 31 after the probation officer applied a 3-level reduction for acceptance of responsibility. Workman had a criminal history category of VI which, when coupled with an offense level of 31, produced an applicable guideline range of 188 to 235 months\u2019 imprisonment. The district court ultimately sentenced Workman to 188 months\u2019 imprisonment, and we affirmed Workman\u2019s conviction and sentence on appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b867-18\">On March 12, 2008, the district court, acting <em>sua sponte, </em>entered an order denying Workman a sentencing reduction. After re-calculating Workman\u2019s guideline range in light of Amendment 706, the court explained that Workman was ineligible for a sentencing reduction because \u201c[t]here is no change in [his] advisory guideline range since he is a career offender and his offense level is determined based on th[e] Chapter Four enhancement.\u201d This appeal followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b867-19\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b867-20\">\u201cWe review <em>de novo </em>a district court\u2019s conclusions about the scope of its legal <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"844\">*844</page-number>authority under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582(c)(2).\u201d <em>United States v. James, </em>548 F.3d 983, 984 (11th Cir.2008). Under \u00a7 3582(c)(2), a district court may modify a defendant\u2019s term of imprisonment where he \u201chas been sentenced to a term of imprisonment based on a sentencing range that has subsequently been lowered by the Sentencing Commission. ...\u201d 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582(c)(2). Any such reduction must also be consistent with the Commission\u2019s applicable policy statements, which similarly provide, inter alia, that a sentencing reduction is not permitted where the retroactive amendment \u201cdoes not have the effect of lowering the defendant\u2019s applicable guideline range.\u201d U.S.S.G. \u00a7 lB1.10(a)(2)(B).</p>\n<p id=\"b868-4\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b868-5\">In this case, the district court correctly found that Workman was ineligible for a sentencing reduction because, although Amendment 706 would reduce Workman\u2019s base offense level from \u00a7 2D1.1, it would not affect his guideline range, as his underlying base offense level was superseded when he was sentenced as a career offender. <em>See United States v. Moore, </em>541 F.3d 1323,1330 (11th Cir.2008) (\u201cWhere a retroactively applicable guideline amendment reduces a defendant\u2019s base offense level, but does not alter the sentencing range upon which his or her sentence was based, \u00a7 3582(c)(2) does not authorize a reduction in sentence.\u201d), <em>cert. denied, McFadden v. United States, </em>\u2014 U.S. --, 129 S.Ct. 965, 173 L.Ed.2d 156 (2009), and cert. <em>denied </em>- U.S. -, 129 S.Ct. 1601, 173 L.Ed.2d 689 (2009). Workman\u2019s remaining arguments are wholly without merit. Accordingly, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b868-9\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
