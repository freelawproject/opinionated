The Government concedes\u2014 and our review of the record confirms\u2014 that the Government breached the terms of its plea agreement with Hoffman by opposing a downward departure for acceptance of responsibility under <em>U.S. Sentencing Guidelines Manual </em>(\u201cUSSG\u201d) \u00a7 3E1.1 (2007). The parties agree that Hoffman\u2019s sentence should be vacated and the case remanded for resentencing.</p>\n<p id=\"b435-5\">Accordingly, we vacate the sentence and remand to the district court for resentencing before a different district judge.<footnotemark>*</footnotemark> <em>See United States v. McQueen, </em>108 F.3d 64, 66 (4th Cir.1997) (directing remand for resentencing before a different sentencing judge after breach of plea agreement); <em>United States v. Peglera, </em>33 F.3d 412, 415 (4th Cir.1994) (same). In view of this resentencing, we decline to address whether the extent of the reduction of Hoffman\u2019s sentence pursuant to USSG \u00a7 5K1.1 was an abuse of discretion. We grant Hoffman\u2019s motion to withdraw the first argument contained in his appellate brief. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b435-6\">\n<em>VACATED AND REMANDED.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b435-8\"> This result is in no way a reflection on the able sentencing judge, but is dictated by our prior precedent in such cases.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
