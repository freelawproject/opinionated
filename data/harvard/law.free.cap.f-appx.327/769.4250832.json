BALDOCK, Circuit Judge.</author>\n<p id=\"b794-14\">Defendant Maurice Simmons pled guilty to distributing crack cocaine in May 2004. Based on his criminal history, Defendant was determined to be a career offender under \u00a7 4B1.1 of the United States Sentencing Guidelines. As his base offense level proved to be 34 under both the career-offender guidelines and the drug guidelines found in \u00a7 2D1.1, this designation initially proved immaterial. <em>See </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4Bl.l(b) (noting that the career offender guidelines generally do not apply unless the base offense level they establish is \u201cgreater than the offense level otherwise applicable\u201d). In combination with Defendant\u2019s criminal history category of VI, Defendant\u2019s total offense level of 31 yielded a suggested Guidelines range of 188 to 235 months imprisonment. The Government, however, filed a motion recommending a non-Guidelines sentence. In October 2005, the district court obliged in sentencing Defendant to a prison term of 120 months.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b795-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"771\">*771</page-number>Subsequently, Defendant filed a Motion to Reduce Sentence based on 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582(c)(2) and the Sentencing Commission\u2019s amendment to the crack cocaine guidelines in \u00a7 2D1.1. <em>See United States v. Winder, </em>557 F.3d 1129, 1136 (10th Cir. 2009) (explaining that the Sentencing Commission instituted a 2-level, retroactive reduction in the base offense levels for crack cocaine-related offenses). The district court denied this motion because the amendment to \u00a7 2D1.1 failed to lower Defendant\u2019s Guidelines range. <em>See </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7 lB1.10(a)(2)(B) (stating that a reduction in a defendant\u2019s term of imprisonment is not authorized under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582(c)(2) unless a retroactive amendment to the Guidelines has \u201cthe effect of lowering the defendant\u2019s applicable guideline range\u201d). Even if Defendant\u2019s \u00a7 2D1.1 sentencing range was lowered by 2 levels, the career offender guidelines in \u00a7 4B1.1 would come into play, thus reestablishing Defendant\u2019s base offense level at 34. <em>See id. </em>\u00a7 lB1.10(b) (explaining that, in determining whether an amendment lowers a defendant\u2019s Guidelines range, only the amended guideline is substituted and \u201call other guideline application decisions\u201d remain \u201cunaffected\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b795-5\">Nonetheless, Defendant challenges the district court\u2019s denial of his Motion to Reduce Sentence on three grounds. First, Defendant claims that \u00a7 lB1.10(a)(2)(B)\u2019s stated limitation on the availability of re-sentencing proceedings under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582(c)(2), <em>i.e. </em>that a Guidelines amendment must have the effect of lowering a defendant\u2019s Guidelines range, is not mandatory.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Second, Defendant brings a Sixth Amendment challenge to the validity of the above-stated requirement. <em>See United States v. Booker, </em>543 U.S. 220, 266-67, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005). Third, Defendant contends that hinging the availability of a sentence modification proceeding on policy statements issued by the United States Sentencing Commission violates the Constitution\u2019s separation of powers principle and the nondelegation doctrine. Exercising jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b795-9\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b795-10\">De novo review applies to the purely legal questions Defendant raises on appeal. <em>See Lorenzo v. Mukasey, </em>508 F.3d 1278, 1282 (10th Cir.2007) (\u201cWe review constitutional and legal questions de novo.\u201d). Our precedents foreclose Defendant\u2019s arguments. <em>See United States v. Jackson, </em>493 F.3d 1179, 1186 (10th Cir.2007) (recognizing that a panel of this court is normally powerless to overrule the holding of a pri- or panel). We, therefore, affirm the district court\u2019s ruling in all respects.</p>\n<p id=\"b795-11\">A.</p>\n<p id=\"b795-12\">The law of this circuit uniformly rejects Defendant\u2019s claim that district courts need not adhere to the policy statements contained in \u00a7 1B1.10 of the Guidelines. A district court does not possess the \u201cinherent power to resentence defendants at any time.\u201d <em>United States v. Green, </em>405 F.3d 1180, 1184 (10th Cir.2005); <em>see also </em>18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582(c) (stating that generally a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"772\">*772</page-number>\u201ccourt may not modify a term of imprisonment once it has been imposed\u201d). To the contrary, resentencing is only appropriate in \u201cspecified instances where Congress has expressly granted the court jurisdiction to do so.\u201d <em>Green, </em>405 F.3d at 1184; <em>see also United States v. Mendoza, </em>118 F.3d 707, 709 (10th Cir.1997) (\u201cA district court does not have inherent authority to modify a previously imposed sentence; it may do so only pursuant to statutory authorization.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b796-4\">The grant of jurisdiction at issue here adheres only when two requirements have been met. First, the Sentencing Commission must have subsequently lowered a defendant\u2019s Guidelines range. <em>See </em>18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582(c)(2). Second, a reduced sentence must be \u201cconsistent with applicable policy statements issued by the Sentencing Commission.\u201d <em>Id.; see also Stinson v. United States, </em>508 U.S. 36, 38, 113 S.Ct. 1913, 123 L.Ed.2d 598 (1993) (noting that Guidelines commentary is binding \u201cunless it violates the Constitution or a federal statute, or is inconsistent with, or a plainly erroneous reading of, that guideline\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b796-5\">The relevant policy statement in \u00a7 1B1.10 of the Guidelines is quite clear: A reduction in a defendant\u2019s term of imprisonment is not authorized unless an amendment to the Guidelines has \u201cthe effect of lowering the defendant\u2019s applicable guideline range.\u201d U.S.S.G. \u00a7 lB1.10(a)(2)(B); <em>see also Winder, </em>557 F.3d at 1137 (noting that a reduction in sentence is only authorized under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582(c)(2) if an amendment to the Guidelines has the effect of lowering a defendant\u2019s Guidelines range). We have already held that a district court lacks jurisdiction to resentence a defendant when a subsequent reduction in his \u00a7 2D1.1 guidelines range is effectively mooted by the application of the career offender guidelines in \u00a7 4B1.1. <em>See United States v. Sharkey, </em>543 F.3d 1236, 1238-39 (10th Cir.2008). Accordingly, Defendant\u2019s first claim is without merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b796-8\">B.</p>\n<p id=\"b796-9\">Our precedent also precludes Defendant\u2019s claim that adhering to \u00a7 lBl.lO\u2019s limitations on the availability of a sentencing modification proceeding violates the Sixth Amendment, as construed by the Supreme Court in <em>Booker. </em>In <em>United States v. Rhodes, </em>549 F.3d 833, 840 (10th Cir.2008), <em>cert. denied </em>\u2014 U.S.-, 129 S.Ct. 2052, 173 L.Ed.2d 1136 (2009), we held that <em>Booker </em>has \u201cno bearing on sentencing modification proceedings conducted under \u00a7 3582(c)(2).\u201d <em>See also United States v. Pedraza, </em>550 F.3d 1218, 1220 (10th Cir.2008) (\u201cA resentencing proceeding is an entirely different animal that does not implicate the Sixth Amendment concerns that drove the Booker remedy.\u201d). We reached this conclusion for four reasons.</p>\n<p id=\"b796-12\">First, and most importantly, original sentencing proceedings and resentencing proceedings are \u201cgoverned by different statutes.\u201d <em>Rhodes, </em>549 F.3d at 840. Second, although 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553 authorizes the district court to conduct a wide-ranging inquiry in original sentencing proceedings, the scope of resentencing proceedings under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582 is much more circumscribed. <em>See id. </em>Third, <em>Booker </em>simply did not address resentencing proceedings under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582. <em>See id.; see also Pedraza, </em>550 F.3d at 1220. Fourth, the Sixth Amendment concerns identified in <em>Booker </em>are inapplicable to sentence modification proceedings. No possibility exists that a district court would make a factual finding, in such a proceeding, that would raise a defendant\u2019s sentence beyond the level justified by a jury\u2019s verdict or a defendant\u2019s plea. <em>See Rhodes, </em>549 F.3d at 840.</p>\n<p id=\"b797-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"773\">*773</page-number><em>Rhodes </em>explicitly rejected the Ninth Circuit\u2019s reasoning in <em>United States v. Hicks, </em>472 F.3d 1167 (9th Cir.2007), on which Defendant relies here. After <em>Booker, Hicks </em>held that to the extent the Guidelines\u2019 policy statements restricted the application of \u00a7 3582(c)(2), \u201cthey must be void.\u201d 472 F.3d at 1172. As we explained in <em>Rhodes:</em></p>\n<blockquote id=\"b797-5\">The problem with the <em>Hicks </em>decision ... is that it failed to consider that ... sentence modification proceedings have a different statutory basis than original sentencing proceedings. As a result, the Ninth Circuit erroneously concluded that the remedial portion of the <em>Booker </em>decision, which rendered the guidelines effectively advisory for purposes of original sentencing proceedings, applied to \u00a7 3582(c)(2) proceedings as well.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"A7G\">549 F.3d at 841. <em>\u201cBooker </em>simply has no bearing on sentencing modification proceedings conducted under \u00a7 3582(c)(2).\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 840. We consequently reject Defendant\u2019s second claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b797-6\">C.</p>\n<p id=\"b797-7\">Defendant also raises a separation of powers attack on \u00a7 3582\u2019s effective incorporation of the Guidelines commentary found in \u00a7 1B1.10. <em>See </em>18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582(c)(2) (stating that a reduced sentence must be \u201cconsistent with applicable policy statements issued by the Sentencing Commission\u201d). Our review of Defendant\u2019s Motion to Reduce Sentence, however, reveals that Defendant never presented this argument to the district court. We generally refuse to consider arguments that have not been presented to and decided by the district court, <em>see United States v. Duncan, </em>242 F.3d 940, 950 (10th Cir.2001), because a party should \u201cnot lose in the district court on one theory of the case, and then prevail on appeal on a different theory.\u201d <em>United States v. Jarvis, </em>499 F.3d 1196, 1202 (10th Cir.2007); <em>see also United States v. Lyons, </em>510 F.3d 1225, 1238 (10th Cir.2007) (recognizing that we exercise our discretion to rule on issues raised for the first time on appeal only \u201cin the most unusual circumstances\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b797-10\">Even if we were to exercise our discretion to address this argument, Defendant would not prevail. We recently held in <em>United States v. Dryden, </em>563 F.3d 1168, 1170-71 (10th Cir.2009), that \u00a7 lB1.10(a)(2)(B)\u2019s requirement that a defendant\u2019s guidelines range be lowered before a resentencing proceeding is available under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582(c)(2) merely restates a limitation Congress placed in the statute itself. Thus, we reasoned no separation of powers violation could possibly occur. <em>See id. </em>at 1171 (\u201cBecause the language of U.S.S.G. \u00a7 lB1.10(a)(2) challenged by Mr. Dryden as resulting from an <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"774\">*774</page-number>unconstitutional delegation of Congressional authority is merely a paraphrase of Congress\u2019s own language, his delegation argument fails.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b798-4\">\u201cSection 3582(c) provides that a court may not modify a term of imprisonment once it has been imposed unless a listed exception applies.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1170. Congress limited the exception in \u00a7 3582(c)(2) to cases in which a defendant\u2019s \u201csentencing range ... has subsequently been lowered by the Sentencing Commission.\u201d 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582(c)(2). In <em>Dryden, </em>we explained that the \u201c\u2018lowering\u2019 requirement of \u00a7 3582(c)(2) is <em>identical </em>to the requirement in U.S.S.G. \u00a7 lB1.10(a)(2) that the amendment to the guidelines have the effect of lowering the defendant\u2019s applicable guideline range.\u201d <em>Dryden, </em>563 F.3d at 1171 (emphasis added). We consequently rejected Dryden\u2019s non-delegation argument. <em>See id. </em>at 1171. The same reasoning applies here.</p>\n<p id=\"b798-5\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b794-8\"> This order and judgment is not binding precedent except under the doctrines of law of the case, res judicata, and collateral estoppel.
