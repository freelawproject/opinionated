Nelson, pretermitting his asylum application and denying his applications for withholding of removal and relief under the Convention Against Torture (\u201cCAT\u201d). <em>In re Min Lin, </em>No. A99 320 423 (B.I.A. June 23, 2008), <em>aff\u2019g </em>No. A99 320 423 (Immig. Ct. N.Y. City Aug. 16, 2006). We assume the parties\u2019 familiarity with the underlying facts and procedural history of the case.</p>\n<p id=\"b307-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"283\">*283</page-number>As an initial matter, because Lin does not challenge the IJ\u2019s pretermission of his untimely asylum application, we deem any such challenge to have been waived. <em>See Yueqing Zhang v. Gonzales, </em>426 F.3d 540, 541 n. 1, 545 n. 7 (2d Cir.2005). Thus, we review only Lin\u2019s challenge to the agency\u2019s denial of his applications for withholding of removal and CAT relief.</p>\n<p id=\"b307-5\">When the BIA adopts the decision of the IJ and supplements the IJ\u2019s decision, we review the decision of the IJ as supplemented by the BIA. <em>See Yan Chen v. Gonzales, </em>417 F.3d 268, 271 (2d Cir.2005). We review the agency\u2019s factual findings, including adverse credibility determinations, under the substantial evidence standard. 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(b)(4)(B); <em>see also Corovic v. Mukasey, </em>519 F.3d 90, 95 (2d Cir.2008).</p>\n<p id=\"b307-6\">For asylum applications governed by the amendments made to the Immigration and Nationality Act by the REAL ID Act of 2005, the agency may, considering the totality of the circumstances, base a credibility finding on an asylum applicant\u2019s demeanor, the plausibility of his or her account, and inconsistencies in his or her statements, without regard to whether they go \u201cto the heart of the applicant\u2019s claim.\u201d 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1158(b)(l)(B)(iii); <em>see Matter of J-Y-C-, </em>24 I. &amp; N. Dec. 260, 265 (BIA 2007).</p>\n<p id=\"b307-7\">Substantial evidence supports the IJ\u2019s adverse credibility determination. Specifically, the IJ based that determination on: (1) discrepancies between Lin\u2019s testimony that he fled China because he feared sterilization and his asylum application, which made no such claim; (2) discrepancies between his testimony that his wife only had one IUD inserted and his wife\u2019s affidavit, which stated that she had \u201canother IUD\u201d inserted; (3) implausible aspects of his testimony, such as his wife not contacting him for over a month after she was forced to have an abortion and his wife\u2019s willingness to return to her home to collect clothing when she knew authorities were looking for her; and (4) Lin\u2019s failure to provide sufficient corroborative evidence to rehabilitate his testimony.</p>\n<p id=\"b307-12\">We find Lin\u2019s arguments challenging the IJ\u2019s findings unpersuasive. For example, Lin asserts that the IJ erred in focusing on the omission in his asylum application when the facts \u201clater emerged during his testimony.\u201d While petitioners are not required to list every single incident of persecution on their asylum application, <em>Pavlova v. I.N.S., </em>441 F.3d 82, 90 (2d Cir. 2006), the IJ did not err in expecting that Lin would have remembered to include the threat of sterilization, even if he had based his claim on his wife\u2019s alleged forced abortion, when he testified that the reason he left China was because of that threat. <em>See Majidi v. Gonzales, </em>430 F.3d 77, 80-81 (2d Cir.2005). Nor was it improper for the IJ to conclude that aspects of Lin\u2019s testimony were implausible. <em>See Ying Li v. BCIS, </em>529 F.3d 79, 80 (2d Cir.2008).</p>\n<p id=\"b307-13\">Thus, based on the totality of the circumstances, the IJ properly found that Lin was not credible.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> <em>See </em>8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1158(b)(1)(B)(iii). Because the only evidence of a threat to Lin\u2019s life or freedom depended upon his credibility, the adverse credibility determination in this case necessarily precludes success on his claims for withholding of removal and CAT relief. <em>See Paul v. Gonzales, </em>444 F.3d 148, 156 (2d Cir.2006); <em>Xue Hong Yang v. U.S. Dep\u2019t of Justice, </em>426 F.3d 520, 523 (2d Cir.2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b308-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"284\">*284</page-number>For the foregoing reasons, the petition for review is DENIED. As we have completed our review, any stay of removal that the Court previously granted in this petition is VACATED, and any pending motion for a stay of removal in this petition is DISMISSED as moot. Any pending request for oral argument in this petition is DENIED in accordance with Federal Rule of Appellate Procedure 34(a)(2), and Second Circuit Local Rule 34(b).</p>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b307-8\">. Because Lin does not challenge the agency\u2019s finding that he failed to provide sufficient corroborative evidence to rehabilitate his testimony, any such argument is deemed waived. <em>See Yueqing Zhang, </em>426 F.3d at 541 n. 1, 545 n. 7.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
