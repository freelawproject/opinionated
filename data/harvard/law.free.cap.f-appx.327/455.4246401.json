The district court granted Butler\u2019s motion for a certificate of appealability on the following issues: (1) whether the retroactive application of a state judicial decision concerning the Louisiana Habitual Offender statute violated the Ex Post Facto Clause; and (2) whether Butler\u2019s life sentence was excessive \u201cinsofar as it is impacted by finding in petitioner\u2019s favor as to claim one above.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b480-15\">The respondent argues that the COA motion filed by Butler\u2019s counsel did not specify the name of the court to which the appeal was taken, and therefore, it was not the functional equivalent of a notice of appeal. This court has excused the failure to name it as the court to which the appeal is taken where the appellant has evinced an intent to appeal and \u201cthis is the only court to which an appeal may be had.\u201d <em>McLemore v. Landry, </em>898 F.2d 996, 999 (5th Cir.1990). Therefore, Butler\u2019s COA motion is construed as a timely notice of appeal. <em>Cf. Stevens v. Heard, </em>674 F.2d 320, 323 (5th Cir.1982).</p>\n<p id=\"b480-16\">Butler argues that the trial court incorrectly applied a retroactive judicial interpretation of the Louisiana Habitual Offender statute to his case in violation of the Ex Post Facto Clause. The retroactive application of a new judicial interpretation of a criminal statute does not implicate the Ex Post Facto Clause. <em>Rogers v. Tennessee, </em>532 U.S. 451, 460, 121 S.Ct. 1693, 149 L.Ed.2d 697 (2001). Butler has not shown that the retroactive application of the Louisiana Supreme Court\u2019s rein<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"457\">*457</page-number>terpretation of the statute violated his due process rights as he has not shown that it was \u201c \u2018unexpected and indefensible by reference to the law which had been expressed prior to the conduct in issue.\u2019 \u201d <em>See id. </em>at 462, 121 S.Ct. 1693; <em>Janecka v. Cockrell, </em>301 F.3d 316, 324 n. 11 (5th Cir. 2002). The plain language of the statute itself does not contain a sequencing requirement. La.Rev.Stat. Ann. \u00a7 15:529.1. The statute was not amended during this time period between the Louisiana Supreme Court\u2019s decisions in <em>State ex rel. Mims v. Butler, </em>601 So.2d 649, 650 (La. 1992), <em>overruled by State v. Johnson, </em>884 So.2d 568 (La.2004) and <em>Johnson, </em>884 So.2d at 573-79. In <em>Johnson, </em>the Louisiana Supreme Court merely reinterpreted the effect of a 1982 amendment to the statute. Contrary to Butler\u2019s argument, a 2005 amendment to the statute did not reinstate the <em>Mims </em>decision; rather, it amended the statute to provide that if multiple convictions are obtained on the same day, they count as one conviction for future multiple offender purposes. <em>See </em>La. Rev.Stat. Ann. \u00a7 15:529.1(B) (applicable to convictions obtained after October 19, 2004). The Louisiana Supreme Court in <em>Johnson </em>gave the statute a different reasonable interpretation which was not unexpected and indefensible. <em>See Rogers, </em>532 U.S. at 462, 121 S.Ct. 1693; <em>see also Janecka, </em>301 F.3d at 324 n. 11. Therefore, the district court did not err in denying habeas relief on this claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b481-5\">Butler argues that his life sentence is excessive in violation of the Eighth and Fourteenth Amendments and especially in light of the violation of the Ex Post Facto Clause. We have held that the retroactive application of the judicial reinterpretation of the Louisiana Habitual Offender statute did not violate Butler\u2019s rights under the Ex Post Facto Clause. To the extent Butler is arguing that his sentence is constitutionally excessive in violation of the Eighth and Fourteenth Amendments, the district court did not grant a COA on this issue. Butler did not make an express request to expand the COA to include this additional issue. <em>See United States v. Kimler, </em>150 F.3d 429, 430 (5th Cir.1998). Because this court\u2019s review is limited to the issue specified in the grant of COA, the court need not consider Butler\u2019s argument that his sentence is constitutionally excessive in violation of the Eighth and Fourteenth Amendments. <em>See Lackey v. Johnson, </em>116 F.3d 149,151-52 (5th Cir.1997).</p>\n<p id=\"b481-7\">He also argues that the trial court erred in imposing the statutory maximum sentence of life imprisonment without providing sufficient reasons as required by La.Code Crim. Proc. art. 894.1(C). His claim that the trial court violated state law is not cognizable in this federal habeas proceeding. <em>See Estelle v. McGuire, </em>502 U.S. 62, 67, 112 S.Ct. 475, 116 L.Ed.2d 385 (1991).</p>\n<p id=\"b481-8\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b480-12\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
