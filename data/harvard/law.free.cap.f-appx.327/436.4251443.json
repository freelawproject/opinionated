Longoria was sentenced to a total term of 292 months in prison, and he timely appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b461-13\">Counsel for Longoria filed a brief in accordance with <em>Anders v. California, </em>386 U.S. 738, 87 S.Ct. 1396, 18 L.Ed.2d 493 (1967), certifying that there are no meritorious grounds for appeal, but questioning whether the district court properly conducted Longoria\u2019s guilty plea hearing and fashioned a reasonable sentence. Finding no reversible error, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b461-14\">In the absence of a motion to withdraw a guilty plea in the district court, we review for plain error the adequacy of the guilty plea proceeding under Fed.R.Crim.P. 11. <em>United States v. Martinez, </em>277 F.3d 517, 525 (4th Cir.2002). Our examination of the record shows that the district court fully complied with the requirements of Rule 11. Longoria\u2019s plea was knowingly, voluntarily and intelligently entered, and supported by a factual basis. We therefore find no error.</p>\n<p id=\"b461-15\">Moreover, a review of the record reveals that the district court did not abuse its discretion in sentencing Longoria. When determining a sentence, the district court must calculate the appropriate advisory guidelines range and consider it in conjunction with the factors set forth in 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a) (2006). <em>Gall v. United States, </em>552 U.S. 38, 128 S.Ct. 586, 596, 169 L.Ed.2d 445 (2007). Appellate review of a district court\u2019s imposition of a sentence, \u201cwhether inside, just outside, or significantly outside the [guidelines range,\u201d is for abuse of discretion. <em>Id. </em>at 591. Sentences within the applicable guidelines <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"438\">*438</page-number>range may be presumed by the appellate court to be reasonable. <em>United States v. Pauley, </em>511 F.3d 468, 473 (4th Cir.2007).</p>\n<p id=\"b462-4\">The district court followed the necessary procedural steps in sentencing Longoria, appropriately treating the sentencing guidelines as advisory, properly calculating and considering the applicable guidelines range, and weighing the relevant \u00a7 3553(a) factors. The court found that concurrent sentences of 292 months on Count One and 240 months on Count Thirty-Four were appropriate in light of the seriousness of the offenses, Longoria\u2019s leadership role in the drug organization, the need to promote respect for the law and to protect the public, and because a substantial amount of drugs were involved. Furthermore, Longoria\u2019s sentence for Count One, which is the low end of the applicable guidelines range and below the statutory maximum of life in prison, is presumed reasonable on appeal. Further, while Longoria\u2019s sentence on Count Thirty-Four is the statutory maximum, we note that it is below the guidelines range. Accordingly, we conclude that the district court did not abuse its discretion in sentencing Longoria.</p>\n<p id=\"b462-5\">In accordance with <em>Anders, </em>we have reviewed the record in this case and have found no meritorious issues for appeal. We therefore affirm the district court\u2019s judgment. This court requires that counsel inform Longoria, in writing, of the right to petition the Supreme Court of the United States for further review. If Longoria requests that a petition be filed, but counsel believes that such a petition would be frivolous, then counsel may move in this court for leave to withdraw from representation. Counsel\u2019s motion must state that a copy thereof was served on Longoria.</p>\n<p id=\"b462-6\">We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b462-8\">\n<em>AFFIRMED.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
