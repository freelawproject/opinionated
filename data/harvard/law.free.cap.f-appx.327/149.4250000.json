On appeal, Phillips argues that the district court erred in its application of \u00a7 3582(c)(2) when it refused to sentence him below the minimum of the amended guideline range. After thorough review, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b173-24\">\u201cWe review <em>de novo </em>a district court\u2019s conclusions about the scope of its legal authority under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582(c)(2).\u201d <em>United States v. James, </em>548 F.3d 983, 984 (11th Cir.2008).</p>\n<p id=\"b173-25\">A district court may modify a term of imprisonment in the case of a defendant who was sentenced to a term of imprisonment based on a sentencing range that has subsequently been lowered by the Sentencing Commission. 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582(c)(2). Any reduction, however, must be \u201cconsistent with applicable policy statements issued by the Sentencing Commission.\u201d <em>Id. </em>The applicable policy statement provides that, \u201cthe court shall not reduce the defendant\u2019s term of imprisonment under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582(c)(2) and this policy statement to a term that is less than the minimum of the amended guideline <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"150\">*150</page-number>range.\u201d U.S.S.G. \u00a7 lB1.10(b)(2)(A). The policy statement does allow for one exception, <em>see id., </em>but that exception is not relevant here.</p>\n<p id=\"b174-4\">Phillips\u2019s argument is foreclosed by precedent. We recently held that <em>Booker </em>does not apply to \u00a7 3582(c)(2) proceedings, and thus, the district court is bound by the limitations imposed by \u00a7 1B1.10 and does not have the authority to sentence below the amended guideline range. <em>See United States v. Melvin, </em>556 F.3d 1190, 1192 (11th Cir.2009) (holding that <em>Booker </em>does not \u201cprohibit the limitations on a judge\u2019s discretion in reducing a sentence imposed by \u00a7 3582(c)(2) and the applicable policy statement by the Sentencing Commission\u201d), <em>petition for cert. filed, </em>(U.S. Feb. 10, 2009) (No. 08-8664). Accordingly, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"AGz\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
