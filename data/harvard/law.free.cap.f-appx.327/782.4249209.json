TYMKOVICH, Circuit Judge.</author>\n<p id=\"b807-10\">Johnny Lee Dawson, a federal prisoner serving a 188-month sentence for distribution of crack cocaine, appeals the denial of his motion for a sentence reduction under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582(c). The district court determined that although recent amendments to the United States Sentencing Guidelines (USSG) lowered certain base offense levels for crack cocaine crimes, Dawson was ineligible for resentencing because he was sentenced as a career offender and not under the recently amended Guideline.</p>\n<p id=\"b807-13\">Having jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291, we AFFIRM.</p>\n<p id=\"b807-14\">I. Background</p>\n<p id=\"b807-15\">In 2004, Dawson pleaded guilty to conspiracy to possess with intent to distribute and distribution of crack cocaine within 1000 feet of a school, violations of 21 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 841(a)(1), (b)(1)(C), 846, and 860(a). Dawson\u2019s presentence report (PSR) attributed 1.8 grams of crack cocaine to these offenses. The PSR calculated a USSG \u00a7 2D1.1 base offense level of 18 for the amount of cocaine, a 1-level increase under \u00a7 2D1.2(a)(2) because the offenses occurred in close proximity to a school, and a 3-level acceptance of responsibility reduction, yielding a total offense level of 16. Coupled with Dawson\u2019s criminal history category of V, the guideline sentencing range would have been 41 to 51 months.</p>\n<p id=\"b807-16\">In light of Dawson\u2019s prior convictions for robbery and cocaine trafficking, the PSR also recommended a USSG \u00a7 4B1.1 career offender enhancement. This enhancement increased Dawson\u2019s adjusted offense level to 31, after accounting for the 3-level acceptance of responsibility reduction, and provided for a criminal history category of VI. The resulting guideline sentencing range was 188 to 235 months\u2019 imprisonment. The district court imposed a 188-month sentence, the low end of the guideline range.</p>\n<p id=\"b807-17\">In 2007, the Sentencing Commission amended the Guidelines by providing a 2-level reduction in base offense levels for <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"784\">*784</page-number>certain crack cocaine offenses. <em>See </em>USSG App. C, Amend. 706 (Reason for Amend.); USSG \u00a7 lB1.10(a) and (c), Amends. 712, 713 (making Amendment 706 retroactive); <em>see </em>USSG \u00a7 2D1.1 (incorporating amended base offense levels); <em>see also United States v. Sharkey, </em>543 F.3d 1236, 1237 (10th Cir.2008).</p>\n<p id=\"b808-4\">Pursuant to these amendments, Dawson filed a motion under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582(c)(2), arguing he was entitled to a sentencing reduction as a result of Amendment 706 to the Guidelines. The district court noted that had Dawson been sentenced pursuant to USSG \u00a7 2D1.1, he would be entitled to the 2-level reduction to his base offense calculation. The court concluded, however, that \u201capplying the amended sentencing guidelines d[id] not have the effect of lowering [Dawson\u2019s] applicable guideline range\u201d because he was sentenced under the career offender provisions of USSG \u00a7 4B1.1. R., Vol. I, Doc. 37 at 4. The court concluded it was without jurisdiction to modify Dawson\u2019s career offender sentence because Amendment 706 had no effect on USSG \u00a7 4B1.1 and because of the limited scope of resentencing permitted under \u00a7 3582(c)(2). Consequently, the district court denied Dawson\u2019s motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b808-5\">Dawson now appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b808-6\">II. Analysis</p>\n<p id=\"b808-7\">Dawson argues the district court erred in failing to reconsider his sentence in light of the recent amendments to the Guidelines. He concedes our decision in <em>United States v. Sharkey, </em>543 F.3d 1236 (10th Cir.2008), forecloses his contentions of error, but nevertheless attempts to distinguish his arguments. We are not persuaded.</p>\n<p id=\"b808-8\">We review the district court\u2019s interpretation of a statute as well as the sentencing guidelines de novo. <em>Id. </em>at 1238. A district court\u2019s decision to deny a sentence reduction under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582(c)(2), however, is reviewed for an abuse of discretion. <em>Id. </em>Since this case is not a direct appeal or a habeas petition, Dawson\u2019s motion depends entirely on \u00a7 3582(c)(2). <em>Id. </em>(citing <em>United States v. Smartt, </em>129 F.3d 539, 540 (10th Cir.1997)). Section 3582(c)(2) provides that when a defendant \u201chas been sentenced to a term of imprisonment <em>based on a sentencing range that has subsequently been lowered by the Sentencing Commission ... </em>the court may reduce the term of imprisonment, after considering the factors set forth in section 3553(a) to the extent they are applicable, if such a reduction is consistent with applicable policy statements issued by the Sentencing Commission.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1238-39 (emphasis added) (quoting \u00a7 3582(c)).</p>\n<p id=\"b808-10\">This case is on all fours with <em>Sharkey. </em>In that case, the defendant sought a sentence reduction after having been convicted of distributing crack cocaine within 1000 feet of a school. <em>Id. </em>at 1238. At sentencing, the district court applied the career offender provisions under USSG \u00a7 4B1.1 and imposed a 188-month prison term. <em>Sharkey, </em>543 F.3d at 1238. We concluded:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b808-11\">At the time defendant was sentenced, had Amendment 706 been in place, it would have lowered by two levels his base offense level under \u00a7 2D1.1 to 28. However, Amendment 706 had no effect on the career offender guidelines in \u00a7 4B1.1, which were the guidelines used by the district court in sentencing Sharkey. As a result, \u201ca reduction\u201d in Sharkey\u2019s term of imprisonment \u201cis not consistent with\u201d the policy statement in \u00a7 1B1.10 \u201cand therefore is not authorized under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582(c)(2)\u201d because a two-level reduction in the offense level under Amendment 706 \u201cdoes not have the effect of lowering [his] ap<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"785\">*785</page-number>plicable guideline range.\u201d Because Amendment 706 has no effect on the Guideline Sharkey was sentenced under, Sharkey\u2019s motion for relief pursuant to \u00a7 3582(c)(2) was properly denied.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b809-5\"><em>Id. </em>at 1239 (citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b809-6\">Dawson attempts to distinguish his circumstances by arguing that the original sentencing court in his case had \u201cconsidered\u201d the now-amended USSG \u00a7 2D1.1 guideline range as a factor in imposing a sentence at the low end of the career offender advisory range. Hence, he asserts, his sentence is based\u2014at least in part\u2014on a guideline range that has been subsequently lowered, thereby qualifying him for a resentencing proceeding under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582(c)(2).</p>\n<p id=\"b809-7\">While the sentencing court may have considered, as one of the 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a) factors, the much lower sentencing range that Dawson would have qualified for in the absence of his status as a career offender, Dawson was nevertheless sentenced as a career offender. His sentencing range as a career offender was calculated based on the advisory USSG \u00a7 4B1.1 guideline. This Guideline has not been lowered by the Sentencing Commission. <em>See Sharkey, </em>543 F.3d at 1239.</p>\n<p id=\"b809-8\">Because we are unpersuaded by Dawson\u2019s attempts to differentiate his claims from <em>Sharkey, </em>we apply our binding precedent. <em>United States v. Mitchell, </em>518 F.3d 740, 752 n. 14 (10th Cir.2008) (\u201cWe are bound by the precedent of prior panels absent en banc reconsideration or a superseding contrary decision by the Supreme Court.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b809-9\">Finally, Dawson claims that post-Hoo/c<em>er, </em>an amendment to the Guidelines triggers a district court\u2019s resentencing authority under \u00a7 3582(c)(2) and the court\u2019s discretion is no longer limited by USSG \u00a7 1B1.10. <em>See United States v. Booker, </em>543 U.S. 220, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005) (excising the mandatory provision in 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(b)(1)). He complains the courts have failed to recognize that the overall purpose of the amendments to the Guidelines is to minimize the disparity in crack sentencing. Essentially, he argues the limitations in \u00a7 1B1.10 are now \u201cpurely advisory\u201d in light of <em>Booker, </em>and the more recent Supreme Court decisions in <em>Kimbrough v. United States, </em>552 U.S. 85, 128 S.Ct. 558, 169 L.Ed.2d 481 (2007), and <em>Gall v. United States, </em>552 U.S. 38, 128 S.Ct. 586, 169 L.Ed.2d 445 (2007), and that the district court should have exercised its resentencing authority to reduce his sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b809-11\">Prior precedent precludes this argument as well. In <em>United States v. Rhodes, </em>we concluded that <em>\u201cBooker </em>simply has no bearing on sentencing modification proceedings conducted under \u00a7 3582(c)(2).\u201d 549 F.3d 833, 840 (10th Cir.2008), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S.-, 129 S.Ct. 2052, 173 L.Ed.2d 1136 (2009). <em>\u201cBooker </em>made no alteration to \u00a7 3582(c)(2), which, as noted, provides the statutory basis for sentence modification proceedings.\u201d <em>Id. </em>More recently, we reiterated that the limitation on modification proceedings arises not from USSG \u00a7 1B1.10, but from 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582(c). <em>United States v. Dry den, </em>563 F.3d 1168, 1170 (10th Cir.2009) (\u201cSection 3582(c) provides that a \u2018court may not modify a term of imprisonment once it has been imposed\u2019 unless a listed exception applies.\u201d). When Amendment 706 changed the base offense levels under USSG \u00a7 2D1.1, it did not necessarily follow that everyone convicted of a crack cocaine offense would be entitled to a re-sentencing under \u00a7 3582(c)(2). <em>See id. </em>(\u201cIt is not enough that the Sentencing Commission has lowered the offense level for similar offenses\u2014such as distributing less crack cocaine than the defendant distributed.\u201d). In sum, we find that nothing <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"786\">*786</page-number>in Dawson\u2019s arguments manifests he was entitled to a sentencing modification.</p>\n<p id=\"b810-4\">III. Conclusion</p>\n<p id=\"b810-5\">For the foregoing reasons, we AFFIRM the district court\u2019s denial of Dawson\u2019s motion for resentencing. We' further VACATE the order to show cause. Appellant\u2019s motion to supplement the record on appeal is GRANTED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b807-18\"> This order and judgment is not binding precedent except under the doctrines of law of the case, res judicata and collateral estoppel. It may be cited, however, for its persuasive value consistent with Fed. R.App. P. 32.1 and 10th Cir. R. 32.1.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
