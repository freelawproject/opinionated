DeFeo was sentenced principally to 860 months\u2019 imprisonment His primary contention on appeal is that the district court improperly refused to compel the government to file a motion to modify his sentence pursuant to Federal Rule of Criminal Procedure 35(b). <em>See United States v. DeFeo, </em>No. 90-cr-250, 2008 WL 2557425, *3-*4 (S.D.N.Y. June 26, 2008). We agree with the district court that it was without authority to compel the government to move for such a modification. We assume the parties\u2019 familiarity with the facts, procedural history of the case, and issues presented on appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b282-4\">The government has \u201ca power, not a duty, to file a motion when a defendant has substantially assisted.\u201d <em>Wade v. United States, </em>504 U.S. 181, 185, 112 S.Ct. 1840, 118 L.Ed.2d 524 (1992).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> DeFeo did not have a cooperation agreement with the government providing for a possible sentence modification under Rule 35(b), and he has not alleged that the government failed to make such a motion based on an unconstitutional motive. Therefore, he is entitled to relief only if he can establish that the government\u2019s reasons for refusing to file a Rule 35(b) motion were \u201cnot rationally related to any legitimate Government end.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 186, 112 S.Ct. 1840,</p>\n<p id=\"b282-5\">Among the reasons identified by the government for its decision not to file a Rule 35(b) motion on DeFeo\u2019s behalf were (1) DeFeo\u2019s history of serious drug trafficking; (2) threats DeFeo made during the course of his prosecution to cooperating witnesses and prosecutors; and (3) false allegations DeFeo made during his trial. Given the latitude afforded the government\u2019s determination as to whether to make such a motion, we believe these reasons suffice.</p>\n<p id=\"b282-9\">DeFeo asserts that he was entitled to an evidentiary hearing to dispute the truth of the latter two grounds. However, DeFeo was not entitled to an evidentiary hearing because he did not make a \u201csubstantial threshold showing\u201d that the government\u2019s reasons for refusing to submit a Rule 35(b) motion were irrational. <em>Id. </em>at 186, 112 S.Ct. 1840 (noting that \u201cgeneralized allegations of improper motive\u201d will not trigger the right to a remedy, \u201cor even to discovery or an evidentiary hearing\u201d). Even where that threshold has been met, whether to hold an oral argument or a formal evidentiary hearing \u201clies within the sound discretion of the district court.\u201d <em>United States v. Knights, </em>968 F.2d 1483, 1487 (2d Cir.1992) (examining allegation of government bad faith where a plea agreement provided for substantial assistance motion). The district court held oral argument on DeFeo\u2019s motion and determined that DeFeo had failed to present \u201cany evidence to cast doubt on the government\u2019s justifications.\u201d <em>DeFeo, </em>2008 WL 2557425 at *4.</p>\n<p id=\"b282-10\">We have considered DeFeo\u2019s remaining contentions and find them to be without merit. The district court\u2019s order is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"A5_E\">. This Court interprets the procedural requirements of Rule 35(b) in light of U.S.S.G. \u00a7 5K1.1. <em>See United States v. Gangi, </em>45 F.3d 28, 30-31 (2d Cir.1995).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
