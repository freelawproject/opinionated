The district court listened to the recording of the hearing and discovered that the transcript\u2014 which reflects that the court pronounced a term of 150 months\u2014is in error: the term pronounced from the bench was 210 months, the same term reflected in the written judgment. The transcript has been corrected and made part of the record on appeal. Because there is no discrepancy between the orally pronounced sentence and the written judgment, and Zepeda has presented no other argument on appeal, the judgment of the district court dated July 13, 2007 is AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
