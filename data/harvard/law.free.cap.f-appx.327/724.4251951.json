The BIA dismissed Larin\u2019s appeal on the ground that he had waived his right to appeal in exchange for a grant of voluntary departure. Although he acknowledges having agreed to the waiver, Larin argues that the Board\u2019s decision was nonetheless erroneous because his decision to waive his rights was not \u201cconsidered and intelligent.\u201d We agree with Larin and therefore grant his petition.</p>\n<p id=\"b749-21\">I. Exhaustion of Waiver Argument</p>\n<p id=\"b749-22\">This Court has jurisdiction to hear Larin\u2019s appeal because the BIA expressly addressed the validity of Larin\u2019s waiver in its final order, rather than declining to address Larin\u2019s argument on procedural grounds. <em>See Abebe v. Gonzales, </em>432 F.3d 1037, 1041 (9th Cir.2005) (en banc).</p>\n<p id=\"b750-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"726\">*726</page-number>I. Validity of Waiver</p>\n<p id=\"b750-4\">\u201cFor a waiver to be valid, the government must establish by \u2018clear and convincing evidence\u2019 that the waiver is \u2018considered and intelligent.\u2019 \u201d <em>United States v. Pallares-Galan, </em>359 F.3d 1088, 1097 (9th Cir.2004) (internal citations omitted). A waiver is not \u201cconsidered and intelligent\u201d if, among other things, an IJ fails to explore an issue adequately with the petitioner, <em>see id.; </em>does not adequately advise the petitioner of the consequences of his choices, <em>see id.; </em>does not inform the petitioner about available relief, <em>see United States v. Arrieta, </em>224 F.3d 1076, 1079 (9th Cir.2000); or pressures a petitioner to drop a request for relief \u201cbefore any significant exploration of all relevant facts ha[s] occurred,\u201d <em>see Cano-Merida v. I.N.S., </em>311 F.3d 960, 965 (9th Cir.2002). Where, as here, the petitioner appears pro se, the IJ\u2019s duty \u201cto fully develop the record\u201d is heightened. <em>See Agyeman v. I.N.S., </em>296 F.3d 871, 884 (9th Cir.2002).</p>\n<p id=\"b750-5\">We hold that Larin\u2019s decision to waive his right to appeal was not \u201cconsidered and intelligent\u201d because he made that decision only (1) after having been informed by the IJ, prematurely and without proper investigation, that he was ineligible for adjustment of status, and (2) after being improperly pressured to accept voluntary departure, which required that he waive his appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b750-6\">1. The IJ concluded that Larin was ineligible for adjustment of status because he was not the beneficiary of a visa petition that had been filed before April 30, 2001. <em>See </em>8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1255(i); <em>Acosta v. Gonzales, </em>439 F.3d 550, 553 (9th Cir. 2006) (listing eligibility requirements for penalty-fee adjustment of status). The IJ\u2019s decision was based largely on the Department of Homeland Security\u2019s (\u201cDHS\u201d) assertion (through a new attorney) at Larin\u2019s final hearing that the record did not contain an approved 1-130 visa petition listing Larin as the beneficiary. This assertion contradicted the agency\u2019s previous representations at one of Larin\u2019s earlier hearings. The administrative record, however, contains several indications that an 1-130 visa petition <em>had </em>been filed on Larin\u2019s behalf in the early 1990s, among them the assurances from DHS to Larin and the IJ that Larin\u2019s file contained an approved 1-130 petition listing Larin as the beneficiary. The IJ should not have accepted DHS\u2019s sudden reversal of position without further exploration, including, at a minimum, providing Larin with an opportunity to obtain a copy of an approved petition.</p>\n<p id=\"b750-9\">Moreover, the record also shows that DHS scheduled an adjustment of status interview for Larin in 1998 based on a previously filed adjustment of status application, although that application was later denied for \u201cfailure to prosecute.\u201d An I-130 (or other) visa petition must be filed on an alien\u2019s behalf before the alien may adjust status, <em>see 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 </em>1255. So it is unlikely that Larin would have been granted an interview without a petition having been filed on his behalf.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The fact that Larin\u2019s previous adjustment of status application had been denied would not render a previously approved 1-130 petition invalid. See <em>Agyeman, </em>296 F.3d at 875-76. The 1998 interview appointment therefore suggests that there was an approved 1-130 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"727\">*727</page-number>petition, as DHS had previously represented.</p>\n<p id=\"b751-5\">In addition, under the regulations in effect in 1992, Larin, as the child of someone who was not a lawful permanent resident (\u201cLPR\u201d), could <em>not </em>have been the derivative beneficiary of a visa petition filed on behalf of his non-LPR mother by his mother\u2019s U.S. citizen spouse. <em>See </em>8 C.F.R. \u00a7 204.1 (1992); 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 204.2(a)(4) (current version); <em>see also </em>Ira J. Kurzban, Immigration Law Sourcebook, ch. 6, \u00a7 III.D.5 (11th ed.2008). As Larin received an adjustment of status interview in 1998, it is likely that he was the beneficiary of a separate petition filed by his stepfather in 1992, as the governing regulations required.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b751-6\">At oral argument, the government could not explain how Larin could have been scheduled for an adjustment interview in 1998 without an 1-130 visa petition that had been filed before April 30, 2001 on his behalf, rather than derivatively. We therefore hold that the IJ erred when he simply accepted DHS\u2019s revised statement\u2014that Larin\u2019s file did not contain an approved 1-130\u2014and did not develop the issue further or afford Larin the opportunity to produce the approval notice (which he had no reason to bring with him as DHS had previously conceded that it existed). The IJ\u2019s denial of Larin\u2019s adjustment of status application was premature, and Larin\u2019s subsequent waiver of adjustment relief and of his right to appeal the IJ\u2019s decisions was not considered and intelligent.</p>\n<p id=\"b751-7\">2. Larin also asserts that his waiver was not \u201cconsidered and intelligent\u201d because the IJ pressured him into accepting voluntary departure by misleading him as</p>\n<p id=\"b751-11\">to the consequences of that option, and failed to properly exploring Larin\u2019s asylum claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b751-12\">The only benefit of voluntary departure that was cited by the IJ\u2014i.e., that Larin would not be subject to the ten-year reentry bar that accompanies a removal order\u2014would not, in fact, have benefited Larin. That is so because, even if Larin accepted voluntary departure and avoided the ten-year removal bar, he would nonetheless be subject to a ten-year bar for having been \u201cunlawfully present in the United States for one year or more.\u201d 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1182(a)(9)(B)(i)(II). The government acknowledged this point at oral argument. The IJ\u2019s advice to Larin regarding voluntary departure was therefore misleading, and prevented Larin from intelligently evaluating that option. <em>See Pallares-Galan, </em>359 F.3d at 1097 (noting that a waiver is not valid where \u201caliens were not represented by legal counsel at the hearing and were not adequately advised of the consequences of the choices they were forced to make\u201d). To make matters worse, the IJ refused Larin\u2019s request for a continuance to evaluate the voluntary departure option, an option presented to Larin for the first time during his final hearing.</p>\n<p id=\"b751-13\">III. Prejudice</p>\n<p id=\"b751-14\">To receive a new hearing, Larin must show not only that his waiver was invalid, but also that he was prejudiced by the IJ\u2019s misconduct. <em>See Arrieta, </em>224 F.3d at 1079. Prejudice exists where an IJ fails to provide a petitioner with the opportunity to present evidence in support of a request for relief. <em>See Cano-Merida, </em>311 F.3d at 965. By prematurely denying Larin\u2019s adjustment of status application and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"728\">*728</page-number>by improperly pressuring Larin to accept voluntary departure and therefore to waive appeal, the IJ denied Larin such an opportunity here. We therefore hold that Larin was prejudiced by the IJ\u2019s actions.</p>\n<p id=\"b752-4\">PETITION GRANTED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b749-14\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9th Cir.
