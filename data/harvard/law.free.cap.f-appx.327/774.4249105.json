We take jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291, DENY Mr. Luke-Sanchez\u2019s request for a COA, and DISMISS this appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b799-5\">I. BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b799-6\">Mr. Luke-Sanchez was convicted of various drug and firearm offenses. We affirmed his conviction on direct appeal. Mr. Luke-Sanchez then timely filed this \u00a7 2255 petition, asserting claims for ineffectiveness of counsel. The district court ordered the government to respond, after which Mr. Luke-Sanchez would be permitted to file a reply. The government submitted a response. Apparently unaware of the government\u2019s filing, Mr. Luke-Sanchez sought a default judgment based on the government\u2019s purported failure to respond. He sought his immediate release from custody.</p>\n<p id=\"b799-7\">The district court determined that Mr. Luke-Sanchez\u2019s ineffectiveness claims did not entitle him to relief under <em>Strickland v. Washington, </em>466 U.S. 668, 104 S.Ct. 2052, 80 L.Ed.2d 674 (1984), and denied his \u00a7 2255 petition. The court further observed that the government had, in fact, responded to the petition and thus denied Mr. Luke-Sanchez\u2019s motion for a default judgment as moot. Mr. Luke-Sanchez sought to vacate the judgment under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 60(b), contending that the government had not formally served him with its answer, that he had never received the answer, and that this had deprived him of the opportunity to file a reply brief in violation of his due process rights. The district court denied the motion to vacate. Mr. Luke-Sanchez appeals from that decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b799-8\">II. DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b799-9\">Because Mr. Luke-Sanchez\u2019s Rule 60(b) motion \u201casserts a defect in the integrity of the federal habeas proceedings,\u201d as opposed to an error in the district court\u2019s resolution of the merits of his ineffectiveness claims, the motion is a \u201ctrue\u201d Rule 60(b) motion. <em>See Spitznas v. Boone, </em>464 F.3d 1213, 1224-25 (10th Cir.2006); see <em>also United States v. Cleaver, </em>319 Fed. Appx. 728, 729 (10th Cir.2009) (unpublished) (Rule 60(b) motion based on government\u2019s failure to serve its response on petitioner and subsequent denial of opportunity to file a reply is a \u201ctrue\u201d Rule 60(b) motion). To appeal from the denial of a \u201ctrue\u201d Rule 60(b) motion, Mr. Luke-Sanchez must obtain a COA. <em>See Spitznas, </em>464 F.3d at 1218. We will issue a COA \u201conly if the applicant has made a substantial showing of the denial of a constitutional right.\u201d 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2253(c)(2). When the district court denies the petitioner\u2019s claim on the merits, \u201c[t]he petitioner must demonstrate that reasonable jurists would find the district court\u2019s assessment of the constitutional claims debatable or wrong.\u201d <em>Slack v. McDaniel, </em>529 U.S. 473, 484, 120 S.Ct. 1595, 146 L.Ed.2d 542 (2000). When the petition is denied on procedural grounds, the petitioner must demonstrate \u201cthat jurists of reason would find it debatable whether the petition states a valid claim of the denial of a constitutional right and that jurists of reason would find it debatable whether the district court was correct in its procedural ruling.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Mr. Luke-Sanchez has failed to make this showing.</p>\n<p id=\"b799-10\">Rule 60(b)(6) \u201cis a catchall provision, allowing relief from judgment for \u2018any other reason justifying relief.\u2019 \u201d <em>Davis v. Kan. Dep\u2019t of Corr., </em>507 F.3d 1246, 1248 (10th Cir .2007) (quoting Fed.R.Civ.P. 60(b)(6)). \u201cRelief under Rule 60(b)(6) is extraordinary and may only be granted in exceptional circumstances.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1248 (quotations omitted). Relief under Rule <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"776\">*776</page-number>60(b)(6) \u201cwill rarely occur in the habeas context.\u201d <em>Omar-Muhammad v. Williams, </em>484 F.3d 1262, 1264 (10th Cir.2007) (quoting <em>Gonzalez v. Crosby, </em>545 U.S. 524, 535, 125 S.Ct. 2641, 162 L.Ed.2d 480 (2005)).</p>\n<p id=\"b800-4\">Even assuming Mr. Luke-Sanchez is correct that he was entitled to formal service of the government\u2019s response, he has not demonstrated how he was prejudiced by that failure\u2014namely, that the district court would have resolved his \u00a7 2255 petition differently had he been able to submit a reply brief. The district court denied habeas relief based on the inadequacy of Mr. Luke-Sanchez\u2019s legal assertions. It did not, as Mr. Luke-Sanchez suggests, adopt the government\u2019s version of events without affording him the opportunity to rebut them. Indeed, the government\u2019s response, much like the district court\u2019s order, simply emphasized the shortcomings of Mr. Luke-Sanchez\u2019s petition as a matter of law. Submitting a reply brief would not have ameliorated those defects, as the district court was under no obligation to consider new or refined theories presented for the first time in such a brief. Moreover, Mr. Luke-Sanchez has never identified what arguments or assertions he would have included in a reply brief, despite filing seven documents related to the issue in the district court. His notice of appeal, application for a COA, and brief on the merits are similarly silent in this regard. Thus, we cannot say that this is an \u201cextraordinary\u201d case in which Rule 60(b) relief is warranted.</p>\n<p id=\"b800-5\">III. CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b800-6\">We DENY Mr. Luke-Sanchez\u2019s request for a COA and DISMISS this appeal. His motion to proceed in forma pauperis is GRANTED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
