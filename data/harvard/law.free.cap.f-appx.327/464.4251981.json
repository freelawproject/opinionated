For the following reasons, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b489-16\">In 2003, Casanova filed for Title II disability insurance benefits and for supplemental security income benefits under Title XVI. She alleged her disability based on back pain began January 29, 2003. Her claims were denied by the Commissioner, and she sought review by an administrative law judge (ALJ). The ALJ concluded that, while Casanova\u2019s impairment was severe, she \u201chas the residual functional capacity to perform work at the light exertional level.\u201d Accordingly, the ALJ denied benefits.</p>\n<p id=\"b489-17\">After Casanova exhausted her administrative remedies, Casanova sought review in federal district court under \u00a7 205(g) of the Social Security Act, 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 405(g) (2000). A federal magistrate judge issued a report and recommendation to affirm the decision of the Commissioner. Casanova filed objections, which the district court overruled. The district court adopted the magistrate judge\u2019s report and recommendation and denied relief. Casanova now appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b489-18\">We review a denial of social security benefits \u201conly to ascertain whether (1) the final decision is supported by substantial evidence and (2) whether the Commissioner used the proper legal standards to evaluate the evidence.\u201d <em>Newton v. Apfel, </em>209 F.3d 448, 452 (5th Cir.2000). A final decision is supported by substantial evidence if we find relevant evidence sufficient to establish that a reasonable mind could reach the same conclusion reached by the Commissioner. <em>Id. </em>In our review of the evidence, we do not substitute our judgment <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"466\">*466</page-number>for the Commissioner\u2019s judgment. <em>Id. </em>If there are conflicts in the evidence, we accept the Commissioner\u2019s resolution of those conflicts so long as that resolution is supported by substantial evidence. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b490-4\">Casanova\u2019s sole argument on appeal is that substantial evidence does not support the ALJ\u2019s finding as to her residual functional capacity (RFC). The Commissioner uses a sequential five-step inquiry to evaluate disability claims under 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 423(d)(1)(A). <em>Perez v. Barnhart, </em>415 F.3d 457, 461 (5th Cir.2005); 20 C.F.R. \u00a7 404.1520(a)(4). In step four of the inquiry, the Commissioner considers whether the claimant has the RFC to perform past relevant work. 20 C.F.R. \u00a7 404.1520(a)(4)(iv). The ALJ found that Casanova retained the ability to perform her past relevant work as a cashier.</p>\n<p id=\"b490-5\">Casanova contends that the ALJ erred in placing great weight on her admission that she took care of her family and certain household tasks. We disagree. Although the ALJ did consider this evidence, he did not put undue emphasis on it. \u201cIt is appropriate for the Court to consider the claimant\u2019s daily activities when deciding the claimant\u2019s disability status.\u201d <em>Leggett v. Chater, </em>67 F.3d 558, 565 n. 12 (5th Cir.1995). Indeed, any \u201cinconsistencies between [Casanova\u2019s] testimony about [her] limitations and [her] daily activities were quite relevant in evaluating [her] credibility.\u201d <em>Reyes v. Sullivan, </em>915 F.2d 151,155 (5th Cir.1990) (per curiam).</p>\n<p id=\"b490-6\">Moreover, the ALJ expressly considered Casanova\u2019s medical records, including a normal MRI and a normal bone scan. Dr. Cone found a slightly diminished range of motion in the lower back but no spasm. Dr. Cone also indicated that Casanova had had \u201csymptoms for a couple of years\u201d and characterized them as \u201cgenerally under-whelming.\u201d Dr. Veggeberg had found her temporarily totally disabled but did not indicate that she was permanently unable to work. The ALJ recognized that Casanova had lumbar pseudoarthrosis and found it to be a severe impairment. However, the ALJ found Casanova\u2019s \u201ctestimony and subjective complaints ... only generally credible.\u201d Credibility determinations are generally entitled to great deference. <em>Newton, </em>209 F.3d at 459. In this case, we find the ALJ\u2019s determination that Casanova has retained the ability to perform her past relevant work as a cashier is supported by substantial evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b490-8\">The order of the district court is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b489-12\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
