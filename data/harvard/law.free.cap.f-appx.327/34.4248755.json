For the reasons that follow, we hold that the IJ violated Filimonova\u2019s statutory right to counsel and thus abused his discretion.</p>\n<p id=\"b59-5\">We review an IJ\u2019s denial of a request for a continuance for abuse of discretion. <em>See Nakamoto v. Ashcroft, </em>363 F.3d 874, 883 n. 6 (9th Cir.2004). We determine <em>de novo </em>whether such denial violates a statutory or constitutional right. <em>See Mendoza-Mazariegos v. Mukasey, </em>509 F.3d 1074, 1079-80 (9th Cir.2007); <em>Hernandez-Gil v. Gonzales, </em>476 F.3d 803, 804 n. 1 (9th Cir. 2007).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The \u201cquestion whether [a] denial of a continuance ... constitutes an abuse of discretion ... must be resolved on a case by case basis according to the facts and circumstances of each case.\u201d <em>Baires v. INS, </em>856 F.2d 89, 91 (9th Cir.1988). We consider such factors as \u201cthe number of prior continuances granted the alien and their duration,\u201d \u201cthe nature of the evidence to be presented and its importance to the alien\u2019s claim,\u201d and the \u201cconvenience of the immigration court.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 92-93. Central to our analysis is the question whether, in denying the request for a continuance, the IJ violated the alien\u2019s statutory or constitutional rights. <em>Id. </em>at 91 n. 2.</p>\n<p id=\"b59-6\">Aliens in removal proceedings have a statutory right to be represented by counsel of their choice, at their own expense. <em>See </em>8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1362; <em>see also </em>8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1240.10(a); <em>Mendoza-Mazariegos, </em>509 F.3d at 1084; <em>Hernandez-Gil, </em>476 F.3d at 808. There was no \u201cknowing and voluntary waiver\u201d of that right here, <em>see Tawadrus v. Ashcroft, </em>364 F.3d 1099, 1103 (9th Cir.2004), as Filimonova consistently expressed her desire to be represented by counsel.</p>\n<p id=\"b59-10\">The IJ abused his discretion and denied Filimonova her right to retained counsel when he refused her request for a continuance after her retained counsel did not show up for her hearing. The denial was based on an erroneous reading of the record and deprived Filimonova of the assistance of counsel in a hearing in which counsel could have been helpful.</p>\n<p id=\"b59-11\">First, contrary to the IJ\u2019s characterization, the record does not indicate that Filimonova\u2019s immediate need for a continuance was due \u201cto unreasonable conduct on the part of the alien.\u201d <em>Baires, </em>856 F.2d at 93. When Belitsky failed to appear for the merits hearing, Filimonova expressed surprise and confusion. The IJ did not inquire whether she knew that Belitsky had previously sought a continuance because of personal obligations, or whether she had any foreknowledge that Belitsky might not attend her hearing. The record suggests that Belitsky\u2019s conduct was not reasonable, but does not indicate that Filimonova was in any way responsible for Belitsky\u2019s failure to appear.</p>\n<p id=\"b59-12\">Second, in considering the number of prior continuances and their duration, the IJ noted that there had been many continuances since the removal proceedings began in 1999. The IJ miscounted the total number of continuances, however, and failed to recognize that two of the continuance requests were submitted by the government, not by Filimonova. Further, the IJ did not review the specific reasons for <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"36\">*36</page-number>the continuances sought before the Los Angeles immigration court, and so failed to attribute some of those requests to Filimonova\u2019s former, ineffective counsel. <em>See Baires, </em>856 F.2d at 93; <em>Mendoza-Mazariegos, </em>509 F.3d at 1081. The IJ also failed to recognize that Filimonova\u2019s new counsel (after succeeding in reopening her proceedings on the basis of ineffective assistance) had requested a continuance only once, and the request was denied. The IJ therefore abused his discretion in evaluating the previous continuances factor as part of the determination whether to grant a continuance.</p>\n<p id=\"b60-4\">Third, although it is true that Filimonova\u2019s case had been pending for a total of five years when the IJ pretermitted her application, much of the delay was attributable to the immigration court itself. For example, the delay from October 4, 2001, until January 6, 2003, was due to the immigration court\u2019s own scheduling conflicts. As we have previously stated, \u201c[i]t is disturbing that an individual petitioner\u201d could be \u201cpunished for the crowded docket of the immigration courts.\u201d <em>Mendoza-Mazariegos, </em>509 F.3d at 1084. The IJ did not take this consideration into account in denying the request for a continuance, and so abused his discretion for that reason as well.</p>\n<p id=\"b60-5\">Fourth, Filimonova faced a difficult hearing. A previous IJ had warned her that the INS intended to present evidence that her birth certificate was fraudulent, and that this would cause her \u201cserious difficulty in proving [her] case.\u201d Although Filimonova appears to have a good command of the English language, it would likely be difficult for her to cross-examine the INS\u2019s expert witness on such a technical issue as forensic documents analysis. <em>See Baires, </em>856 F.2d at 92.</p>\n<p id=\"b60-6\">Finally, \u201c \u2018myopic insistence upon expeditiousness in the face of a justifiable request for delay\u2019 ... render[ed] the alien\u2019s statutory rights merely \u2018an empty formality.\u2019\u201d <em>Baires, </em>856 F.2d at 91 (quoting <em>Rios-Berrios v. INS, </em>776 F.2d 859, 862 (9th Cir.1985)). The IJ denied Filimonova\u2019s request out of hand, without asking her how long a continuance she wanted or consulting the court\u2019s upcoming schedule. On this record, the \u201cconvenience of the immigration court,\u201d <em>Baires, </em>856 F.2d at 92, does not justify the IJ\u2019s denial of Filimonova\u2019s request.</p>\n<p id=\"b60-8\"><em>In </em>sum, the IJ\u2019s denial of Filimonova\u2019s request for a continuance was based on an erroneous reading of the record and is unsupported by any other relevant considerations. The BIA affirmed, adding only that \u201cthe absence of counsel at a hearing does not constitute a denial of due process without some showing of prejudice to the alien,\u201d citing <em>Ramirez v. INS, </em>550 F.2d 560, 565 (9th Cir.1977). <em>Ramirez, </em>however, does not stand for that proposition. We have, in fact, long left unanswered the question whether prejudice is required when an IJ\u2019s denial of a continuance effectively denies an alien\u2019s statutory right to counsel. <em>See Hernandez-Gil, </em>476 F.3d at 808; <em>Mendoza-Mazariegos, </em>509 F.3d at 1084; <em>Baires, </em>856 F.2d at 91 n. 3.</p>\n<p id=\"b60-9\">We need not resolve that question today. Filimonova faced the very serious charge of document falsification. Disputing that charge would require cross-examination of the government\u2019s forensics expert on highly technical questions, for which an attorney fluent in English and familiar with the law and with the art of cross-examination would be much better positioned than Filimonova herself. Had Filimonova\u2019s counsel \u201cbeen present at h[er] merits hearing, it is highly likely that [she] would have more advantageously presented h[er] case.\u201d <em>Hernandez-Gil, </em>476 F.3d at 809. We therefore conclude that Filimonova has demonstrated prejudice of the kind recog<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"37\">*37</page-number>nized by our denial-of-counsel case law as adequate.</p>\n<p id=\"b61-5\">For the foregoing reasons, we grant the petition for review and remand the case to the agency for further proceedings. We order that Filimonova\u2019s case be assigned to a different IJ on remand. <em>See Nuru, </em>404 F.3d at 1229.</p>\n<p id=\"b61-6\">PETITION FOR REVIEW GRANTED and REMANDED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b58-17\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publicalion and is not precedent except as provided <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"35\">*35</page-number>by 9th Cir. R. 36-3.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b59-8\">. Because the BIA expressly adopted the reasoning of the IJ and added some of its own reasoning, our review encompasses both decisions. <em>See Nuru v. Gonzales, </em>404 F.3d 1207, 1215 (9th Cir.2005).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
