(\u201cTPI\u201d) and Hawaii International Seafood, Inc., et al., the United States District Court for the District of Hawaii entered an order construing certain claims of TPI\u2019s U.S. Patent 5,484,619 (\u201cthe '619 patent\u201d). <em>Tuna Processors, Inc. v. Haw. Int\u2019l Seafood, Inc., </em>No. 05-cv-00517, 2007 WL 3072815, 2007 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 77396 (D.Haw. Oct. 17, 2007). Following claim construction, the parties entered into a stipulated judgment of noninfringement. The district court then entered a final judgment of noninfringement, from which TPI now appeals. <em>See Tuna Processors, Inc. v. Haw. Int\u2019l Seafood, Inc., </em>No. 05-cv-00517, Stipulation for Entry of Final J. and Order (D.Haw. May 7, 2008) (Dkt. No. 193) (\u201cStipulated Final Judgment\u201d). Hawaii International Seafood, Inc. and William Kowalski (collectively, \u201cHISI\u201d) cross-appeal from the district court\u2019s denial of their motion for partial summary judgment. <em>See Tuna Processors, Inc. v. Haw. Int\u2019l Seafood, Inc., </em>No. 05-cv-00517, 2006 WL 2989248, 2006 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 76885 (D.Haw. Oct. 17, 2006). Because the court correctly entered judgment of noninfringement, we <em>affirm. </em>HISI\u2019s cross-appeal is moot.</p>\n<p id=\"b229-16\">BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b229-17\">The tuna fish enjoyed by U.S. diners is often caught in and shipped from distant locations. Given the relatively long travel time required to deliver tuna to U.S. consumers, importers seek out ways of preserving the fresh look and taste of their <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"206\">*206</page-number>fish. This case involves a patent dispute that centers on a method of curing tuna fish meat using cooled smoke.</p>\n<p id=\"b230-4\">Kowalski is the sole owner of Hawaii International Seafood, Inc. (\u201cHawaii Int\u2019l\u201d), a company that imports sushi grade tuna into the United States. Kowalski is also the owner of U.S. Patent 5,972,401, entitled \u201cProcess for Manufacturing Tasteless Super-Purified Smoke for Treating Seafood to be Frozen and Thawed.\u201d Kowalski licenses his patented method to Hawaii Int\u2019l, as well as other companies involved in curing tuna.</p>\n<p id=\"b230-5\">The '619 patent, entitled \u201cMethod for Curing Fish and Meat by Extra-Low Temperature Smoking,\u201d issued to Kanemitsu Yamaoka, among others, on January 16, 1996. Claim 1 of the '619 patent reads as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b230-6\">A method for curing raw tuna meat by extra-low temperature smoking comprising the steps of:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b230-7\">burning a smoking material at 250\u00b0 to 400\u00b0 C. and passing the produced smoke through a filter to remove mainly tar therefrom; cooling the smoke passed through the filter in a cooling unit to between 0\u00b0 and 5\u00b0 C. while retaining ingredients exerting highly preservative and sterilizing effects; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b230-8\">smoking the tuna meat at extra-low temperatures by exposure to the smoke cooled to between 0\u00b0 and 5\u00b0 C.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b230-9\">Shortly after the issuance of the '619 patent, Yamaoka and Kowalski entered into a nonexclusive license agreement that permitted Kowalski to use the invention. The license agreement stated that Kowalski did not believe that he was \u201cinfring[ing] on any valid claims of the ['619] Patent,\u201d but that he was obtaining a license agreement \u201cin order to prevent the Other Inventors [of the '619 patent] from asserting ... unlicensed infringements on the Patent.\u201d The license agreement ran through December 10, 2004.</p>\n<p id=\"b230-11\">On January 15, 2003, the '619 patent, as well as the rights under the license agreement between Yamaoka and Kowalski, were assigned to TPI. TPI, a holding company based in California, was created by several Philippine-based tuna exporters in order to administer the '619 patent. On the day that Kowalski\u2019s license expired, TPI filed an infringement action against HISI in the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Michigan. HISI successfully moved for transfer of the case to the United States District Court for the District of Hawaii.</p>\n<p id=\"b230-12\">Following transfer of the case, HISI moved for partial summary judgment of noninfringement and requested an order barring TPI from asserting the doctrine of equivalents against HISI. In that motion, HISI argued that the \u201cdisclosure-dedication rule\u201d limited the '619 patent to smoke produced between 250\u00b0 and 400\u00b0 C. According to HISI, the disclosure-dedication rule applied because the claims of the '619 patent were limited to smoke produced between 250\u00b0 C and 400\u00b0 C while the specification described smoke temperatures outside of that range. <em>Tuna Processors, </em>2006 WL 2989248, at *4, 2006 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 76885, at *11-*12. The district court denied HISI\u2019s motion for summary judgment, finding that there were material facts that needed to be ascertained before infringement could be determined. <em>Id. </em>at *5, 2006 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 76885, at *14-*15. Furthermore, the court declined to construe the claims of the '619 patent at that time. <em>Id. </em>The court denied HISI\u2019s motion for reconsideration, finding again that the disclosure-dedication rule did not apply and that the court had not erred in failing to enjoin TPI from asserting any doctrine of equivalents argument. <em>Tuna </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"207\">*207</page-number><em>Processors v. Haw. Int\u2019l Seafood, Inc., </em>No. 05-CV-00517, 2007 WL 1141496, at *4-*5, 2007 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 28135, at *12-*13 (D.Haw. Apr. 16, 2007).</p>\n<p id=\"b231-5\">On October 17, 2007, the district court issued its claim construction order for the '619 patent. That order contained three constructions that form the basis of TPI\u2019s present appeal. First, the court found that the phrase \u201cburning a smoking material at 250\u00b0 to 400\u00b0 C\u201d refers to the temperature of the medium in which the smoking material is burned, not to the temperature of the smoking material itself. <em>Tuna Processors, </em>2007 WL 3072815, at *3, 2007 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 77396, at *11. In so finding, the court noted that while the claim language and the specification were \u201cambiguous\u201d on this point, the extrinsic evidence was \u201cdecisive.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at *3, 2007 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 77396, at *10-*11.</p>\n<p id=\"b231-6\">Second, the district court construed the step of \u201cpassing the produced smoke through a filter to remove mainly the tar therefrom\u201d as only applying to filtration processes that did not filter \u201cflavor-giving particles out of the smoke.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at *6, 2007 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 77396, at *18. As support for its construction of the filtration step, the court relied on both the language of claim 1 and the specification\u2019s description of imparting flavor through its smoking method.</p>\n<p id=\"b231-7\">Lastly, the court construed the step of \u201cexposure to the smoke cooled to between 0\u00b0 and 5\u00b0 C\u201d as occurring after the smoke \u201chas already been cooled ... to between 0\u00b0 and 5\u00b0 C.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at *6-7, 2007 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 77396, at *20. The court relied heavily on the plain language of the claim itself in reaching its construction of that limitation.</p>\n<p id=\"b231-8\">The parties then entered into a stipulated judgment that under the district court\u2019s claim construction, HISI had not infringed the '619 patent. The district court entered a final judgment based on that stipulation. TPI timely appealed the district court\u2019s final judgment and HISI filed a timely cross-appeal. We have jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1295(a)(1).</p>\n<p id=\"b231-10\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b231-11\">Before we address the question of construction of the disputed terms, we turn to the terms of the stipulated agreement, which was entered as the Stipulated Final Judgment. TPI argues that the Stipulated Final Judgment is \u201cat best ambiguous\u201d and that if we reverse one of the three disputed claim constructions we must remand the case for \u201cfurther factual findings.\u201d Oral Argument at 9:28, http:// oralarguments.cafc.useourts.gov/mp3/20081410.mp3. HISI counters that if we were to uphold \u201cthe District Court\u2019s construction on even one of these limitations, there can be no infringement, and the judgment of non-infringement in favor of HISI would stand.\u201d Appellant\u2019s Br. at 19.</p>\n<p id=\"b231-12\">We agree with HISI that affirmance of the construction of one of the disputed claim limitations results in an affirmance of the judgment of noninfringement. That conclusion is borne out by the plain language of the Stipulated Final Judgment itself. Paragraph 2 of the Stipulated Final Judgment defines the three disputed limitations as \u201ccollectively, \u2018disputed claim construction points.\u2019 \u201d <em>Stipulated Final Judgment, </em>at \u00b6 2. The final line of the agreement reads:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b231-13\">If the United States Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit reverses the <em>disputed claim construction points, </em>the parties may reassert all claims and issues previously set forth on remand to the United States District Court for the District of Hawaii.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b232-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"208\">*208</page-number><em>Id. </em>at \u00b6 7 (emphasis added). Thus, the Stipulated Final Judgment permits reassertion of issues on remand only in the event that we reverse all three disputed limitations, or, as the Stipulated Final Judgment defines them, the \u201cdisputed claim construction points.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b232-4\">Furthermore, the agreement stipulates that HISI does not infringe the '619 patent \u201cbecause the patent claim limitations\u201d are not met by any of the allegedly infringing products. <em>Id. </em>at \u00b6 3. Although \u201cpatent claim limitations\u201d is not a defined term in the Stipulated Final Judgment, the use of the plural in that phrase amounts to a concession by TPI that the accused products do not meet any of the three disputed limitations. As is well established, for infringement to occur an accused infringer must perform all of the steps of a method claim or the equivalent thereof. <em>See Ricoh Co., Ltd. v. Quanta Computer, Inc., </em>550 F.3d 1325, 1333 (Fed.Cir.2008) (\u201cInfringement of a method claim 'occurs when a party performs all of the steps of the process.\u2019 \u201d) (quoting <em>BMC Res., Inc. v. Paymentech L.P., </em>498 F.3d 1373, 1379 (Fed.Cir.2007)). Because TPI has conceded that HISI\u2019s products do not infringe any of the three disputed claims as construed by the district court, we must reverse all three constructions in order for TPI to succeed in its appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b232-5\">Having determined the scope of the stipulated judgment and thus the scope of the appeal, we now turn to the appropriate construction of one of the disputed limitations. We review claim construction de novo on appeal. <em>Cybor Corp. v. FAS Techs., Inc., </em>138 F.3d 1448, 1456 (Fed.Cir. 1998) (en banc). Claim terms should generally be given their ordinary and customary meaning and such meaning is one \u201cthat the term would have to a person of ordinary skill in the art in question at the time of the invention.\u201d <em>Phillips v. AWH Corp., </em>415 F.3d 1303, 1312-13 (Fed.Cir. 2005) (en banc). Moreover, \u201cthe person of ordinary skill in the art is deemed to read the claim term not only in the context of the particular claim in which the disputed term appears, but in the context of the entire patent, including the specification.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1313.</p>\n<p id=\"b232-7\">With these principles in mind, we turn to the appropriate construction of one of the disputed terms. We turn to the third disputed limitation, that of \u201csmoke cooled to between 0\u00b0 and 5\u00b0 C.\u201d TPI argues that the district court erred by construing that limitation as requiring a process that first cools the smoke and later applies the cooled smoke to the tuna. According to TPI, under the language of the claim, the smoke can be applied to the tuna first, and then cooled to the stated temperature range. In support of that interpretation, TPI notes that the \u201csmoke cooled\u201d limitation does not introduce the smoke using the word \u201csaid,\u201d which is traditionally used by claim drafters to reference previously-mentioned limitations. Here, the claim instead refers to the smoke as <em>\u201cthe </em>smoke cooled,\u201d which, in TPI\u2019s view, introduces a new element to the claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b232-8\">HISI, in contrast, urges us to affirm the district court\u2019s construction which requires the smoke to have been cooled before exposing it to the tuna. HISI interprets the phrase \u201cthe smoke cooled\u201d as referring to the smoke filtered in the previous step of claim l\u2019s method. According to HISI, the use of the past tense \u201ccooled\u201d precludes any reading that would permit the cooling and smoking steps to be performed simultaneously or in reverse order. Furthermore, HISI argues, the specification of the '619 patent confirms the order of the cooling steps in the smoking process.</p>\n<p id=\"b232-9\">We agree with HISI that to infringe the '619 patent, a method must cool the smoke before the smoke contacts the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"209\">*209</page-number>tuna. The plain language of claim 1 demonstrates that the district court was correct in placing a temporal limitation on the steps of the smoking method. As the district court noted, this case is one in which the \u201csequential nature of the claim steps is apparent from the plain meaning of the claim language and nothing in the written description suggests otherwise.\u201d <em>Tuna Processors, </em>2007 WL 3072815, at *6, 2007 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 77396, at *19 (quoting <em>Interactive Gift Exp., Inc. v. Compuserve, Inc., </em>256 F.3d 1323, 1342 (Fed.Cir.2001)).</p>\n<p id=\"b233-5\">Claim 1 describes a multistep process of creating smoke within a particular temperature range and then cooling that smoke to another temperature range. In each step of the method, the smoke is referenced by-using a past participle describing the action that occurred in the previous step. To illustrate this, the steps of the '619 patent are reproduced below with the smoke references underlined:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AHa\">burning a smoking material at 250\u00b0 to 400\u00b0 C. and passing <em>the produced smoke </em>through a filter to remove mainly tar therefrom;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b233-6\">cooling <em>the smoke passed through the filter </em>in a cooling unit to between 0\u00b0 and 5\u00b0 C. while retaining ingredients exerting highly preservative and sterilizing effects; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b233-7\">smoking the tuna meat at extra-low temperatures by exposure to <em>the smoke cooled to between 0\u00b0 and 5\u00b0 C.</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b233-8\">In the first step of claim 1, the smoke is \u201cproduced\u201d by burning a smoking material. In that same limitation, the smoke is passed through a filter. The smoke filtration aspect of the first step, which must occur after the smoke is produced, refers to the smoke as \u201cthe produced smoke.\u201d The use of the past participle confirms that the smoke must be produced prior to being filtered. The second step of claim 1, the cooling step, refers to the smoke as \u201cthe smoke passed through the filter.\u201d Again, the use of the past participle \u201cpassed\u201d leads to the conclusion that the cooling of the smoke occurs after the smoke has passed through the filter. In both the first and second steps, the smoke from a previous limitation is referenced using a past participle, indicating that the previous limitation must have occurred pri- or to the present limitation. In other words, \u201cthe smoke produced\u201d must have been produced prior to filtration, just as the \u201csmoke passed through the filter\u201d must have been filtered prior to being cooled. In the same manner, the use of the past participle in \u201cthe smoke cooled\u201d in the disputed third step requires that the smoke have been cooled prior to contacting the tuna meat for infringement to occur.</p>\n<p id=\"b233-10\">Nothing in the specification dissuades us from reading a temporal limitation in the third step of claim 1. Indeed, the specification confirms the appropriateness of such a temporal limitation. The second step of claim 1 states that the smoke is cooled in a \u201ccooling unit.\u201d '619 Patent, Cl. 1. The Summary of the Invention of the '619 patent instructs that the smoke from the \u201csmoke-cooling unit\u201d is exposed to the tuna in a separate location, \u201ca smoking chamber.\u201d <em>Id. </em>col. 1 11. 63, 65; <em>see also id. </em>fig. 1, col. 4 11. 13-14 (drawing of separate locations for the smoking chamber and smoke-cooling unit). The presence of two distinct locations for the cooling step and the exposure step eliminates the possibility of simultaneous cooling and exposure. The Summary of the Invention further indicates that the smoking chamber is where pieces of tuna are placed together and \u201cexposed to smoke from the smoke-cooling unit.\u201d <em>Id. </em>col. 1 11. 66-67. Thus, the smoke must have been cooled prior to being introduced into the smoking chamber. Numerous other references in the specification confirm this sequential order<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"210\">*210</page-number>ing of steps. <em>See id. </em>col. 3 11. 33-40 (teaching that the smoke from the smoke-cooling unit is \u201cbrought into contact\u201d with fish in the smoking chamber); col. 4 11. 66-col. 5 1.1 (\u201cThe smoke-cooling unit 3 delivers the smoke cooled to between 0\u00b0 and 5\u00b0 C. through the pipe 32 to the smoking chamber 4.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b234-4\">TPI\u2019s argument that the use of the definite article \u201cthe\u201d in the third step somehow indicates that the smoke used in that step is different from the smoke in the previous step is without merit. As demonstrated above, all of the steps of claim 1 clearly refer to the same smoke. There is nothing in the claims or specification of the '619 patent that would indicate that smoke different from the filtered and cooled smoke of the first and second steps is introduced in the last step of the method. The '619 patent is concerned with creating smoke having a particular temperature, preservative ability, and flavor in order to optimally cure tuna fish. TPI\u2019s claim that a new type of smoke is introduced during the last step of the process runs contrary to the entire purpose and design of the '619 patent and its claims. It simply is an attempt to cloud the issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b234-5\">Furthermore, TPI\u2019s claim drafting argument misstates traditional claim drafting practice. Indeed, the introduction of a new element is accomplished through the use of an indefinite article, not through the use of a definite article. <em>See, e.g., </em>Robert C. Faber, <em>Faber on Mechanics of Patent Claim Drafting, </em>App. D-l (6th ed. 2008) (\u201cthe definitive article THE is used to refer to an ELEMENT which has been established earlier in a claim.\u201d); <em>see also </em>2 <em>Manual of Patent Examining Procedure, </em>ch. 2173.05(e) (8th ed. 2006) (giving an example of an indefinite claim caused by use of the term \u201cthe lever\u201d without an antecedent introduction of \u201ca lever\u201d). Thus, the use of the definite article in the third step of claim 1 supports our conclusion that \u201cthe smoke cooled\u201d is the smoke from the previous step.</p>\n<p id=\"b234-7\">In light of all of the above, we conclude that the third step of claim 1 of the '619 patent must occur after the smoke has been cooled to between 0\u00b0 and 5\u00b0 C for infringement to exist. Having reached that conclusion, we affirm the district court\u2019s final judgment of noninfringement. It is not necessary for us to consider the other contested claim terms in light of the stipulation.</p>\n<p id=\"b234-8\">As for HISI\u2019s cross-appeal, it is rendered moot by our decision above.</p>\n<p id=\"b234-9\">CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b234-10\">Because the district court correctly construed \u201cexposure to the smoke cooled to between 0\u00b0 and 5\u00b0 C,\u201d we affirm the court\u2019s final judgment of noninfringement.</p>\n<p id=\"b234-11\">\n<em>AFFIRMED</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b234-12\">COSTS</p>\n<p id=\"b234-13\">Costs to be awarded to HISI.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
