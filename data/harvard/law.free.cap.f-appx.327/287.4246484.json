Mulligan, denying his applications for asylum, withholding of removal, and relief under the Convention Against Torture (\u201cCAT\u201d). <em>In re Xian Long Ou, </em>No. A99 683 028 (B.I.A. Aug. 19, 2008), <em>affg </em>No. A99 683 028 (Immig. Ct. N.Y. City Aug. 18, 2006). We assume the parties\u2019 familiarity with the underlying facts and procedural history of the case.</p>\n<p id=\"b312-23\">As an initial matter, to the extent that Ou challenges the IJ\u2019s pretermission of his asylum application as untimely, we lack jurisdiction and therefore dismiss his petition for review. <em>See </em>8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1158(a)(3). Thus, we review only Ou\u2019s challenge to the agency\u2019s denial of his applications for withholding of removal and CAT relief.</p>\n<p id=\"b313-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"289\">*289</page-number>When the BIA issues an opinion that fully adopts the IJ\u2019s decision, we review the IJ\u2019s decision. <em>See Mei Chai Ye v. U.S. Dep\u2019t of Justice, </em>489 F.3d 517, 523 (2d Cir.2007). We review the agency\u2019s factual findings, including adverse credibility determinations, under the substantial evidence standard. 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(b)(4)(B); <em>see also Corovic v. Mukasey, </em>519 F.3d 90, 95 (2d Cir.2008). For asylum applications governed by the REAL ID Act, the agency may, considering the totality of the circumstances, base a credibility finding on an asylum applicant\u2019s demeanor, the plausibility of his or her account, and inconsistencies in his or her statements, without regard to whether they go \u201cto the heart of the applicant\u2019s claim.\u201d 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1158(b)(l)(B)(iii); <em>see Matter of J-Y-C-, </em>24 I. &amp; N. Dec. 260, 265 (B.I.A.2007).</p>\n<p id=\"b313-5\">Substantial evidence supports the IJ\u2019s adverse credibility determination. The IJ drew a negative inference as to Ou\u2019s credibility after observing his demeanor. Specifically, the IJ indicated that Ou paused for a long time before answering the IJ\u2019s questions and looked around while answering. Because particular deference is given to the trier of fact\u2019s assessment of demeanor, and the record supports the IJ\u2019s finding, the IJ did not err in basing his adverse credibility determination, in part, on Ou\u2019s demeanor. <em>See Majidi v. Gonzales, </em>430 F.3d 77, 81 n. 1 (2d Cir.2005). It was also not improper for the IJ to rely on Ou\u2019s confusing testimony regarding the use of his passport when the IJ provided Ou several opportunities to explain and clarify his testimony, which Ou failed to do. <em>See Zhi Wei Pang v. BCIS, </em>448 F.3d 102, 109-10 (2d Cir.2006); <em>Ming Shi Xue v. BIA, </em>439 F.3d 111, 124 (2d Cir.2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b313-6\">The IJ erred, however, in finding a discrepancy between Ou\u2019s asylum application and testimony regarding whether Ou\u2019s wife went into hiding with him. This error notwithstanding, considering the totality of the circumstances, substantial evidence supports the IJ\u2019s finding that Ou was not credible and we are confident that the IJ would make the same adverse credibility finding absent this error. <em>See </em>8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1158(b)(1)(B)(iii); <em>Xiao Ji Chen v. U.S. Dep\u2019t of Justice, </em>471 F.3d 315, 339 (2d Cir.2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b313-8\">Because the only evidence of a threat to Ou\u2019s life or freedom depended upon his credibility, the adverse credibility determination in this case necessarily precludes success on his claims for withholding of removal and CAT relief. <em>See Paul v. Gonzales, </em>444 F.3d 148, 156 (2d Cir.2006); <em>Xue Hong Yang v. U.S. Dep\u2019t of Justice, </em>426 F.3d 520, 523 (2d Cir.2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b313-9\">For the foregoing reasons, the petition for review is DISMISSED in part and otherwise' DENIED. As we have completed our review, the pending motion for a stay of removal in this petition is DISMISSED as moot. The pending request for oral argument in this petition is DENIED in accordance with Federal Rule of Appellate Procedure 34(a)(2), and Second Circuit Local Rule 34(b).</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
