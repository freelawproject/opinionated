Siler, Jr., Senior United States Circuit Judge for the Sixth Circuit, sitting by designation.</p>\n</footnote>\n<opinion data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"majority\">\n<p id=\"b733-6\">MEMORANDUM <footnotemark>**</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b733-7\">Petitioner-Appellant Aaron Christopher Hargrove appeals the district court\u2019s denial of his petition for a writ of habeas corpus. We have jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2253, and we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b733-8\">Because the parties are familiar with the facts, we do not recount them here except as necessary to explain our decision. We review Hargrove\u2019s <em>Batson v. Kentucky, </em>476 U.S. 79, 106 S.Ct. 1712, 90 L.Ed.2d 69 (1986), claim de novo, because the state court\u2019s use of the standard laid out in <em>People v. Wheeler, </em>22 Cal.3d 258, 148 Cal. Rptr. 890, 583 P.2d 748 (1978), does not satisfy constitutional requirements. <em>See Wade v. Terhune, </em>202 F.3d 1190, 1192 (9th Cir.2000).</p>\n<p id=\"b733-9\">Hargrove failed to present a prima facie case of discrimination with regards to Jl. Hargrove\u2019s claim \u201cthat the totality of relevant facts gives rise to an inference of discriminatory purpose\u201d hinges on a statistical argument involving very small numbers. <em>Batson, </em>476 U.S. at 94, 106 S.Ct. 1712. This argument, standing alone, is insufficient to establish a prima facie case in light of the ample legitimate reasons in the record for the prosecution\u2019s challenge. <em>See Fernandez v. Roe, </em>286 F.3d 1073, 1078 (9th Cir.2002). Hargrove\u2019s claim of pretext as to J2 and J3 also fails. The prosecution had valid, non-racially focused, individualized reasons for challenging both J2 and J3 on the basis of relationships or personal experiences not shared by the other jurors. <em>See Miller-El v. Dretke, </em>545 U.S. 231, 241, 125 S.Ct. 2317, 162 L.Ed.2d 196 (2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b733-13\">Hargrove is likewise not entitled to the writ on his claim that he was denied due process. This court is bound by state court interpretations of state law. <em>Mullaney v. Wilbur, </em>421 U.S. 684, 691 <em>&amp; </em>n. 11, 95 S.Ct. 1881, 44 L.Ed.2d 508 (1975). Even if Hargrove could show that the state court made federally-recognizable errors, these alleged errors would be harmless in light of the prosecution\u2019s strong case against him. <em>Brecht v. Abrahamson, </em>507 U.S. 619, 631, 113 S.Ct. 1710, 123 L.Ed.2d 353 (1993).</p>\n<p id=\"b733-14\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b733-23\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9th Cir.
