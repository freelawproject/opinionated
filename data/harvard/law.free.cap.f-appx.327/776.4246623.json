Because Swanner failed to satisfy the standards for the issuance of a COA, we deny his request and dismiss the matter.</p>\n<p id=\"b801-9\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b801-10\">Swanner was tried by jury and found guilty of two counts of aggravated criminal sodomy, one count of aggravated battery, and one count of criminal threat. Swanner was subsequently sentenced to 444 months\u2019 imprisonment. Swanner\u2019s convictions were affirmed on direct appeal by the Kansas Court of Appeals, with the exception of the aggravated battery conviction. <em>State v. Swanner, </em>No. 83,710, 16 P.3d 339 (Kan.Ct.App. Dec.8, 2000). The aggravated battery conviction was subsequently dismissed. The Kansas Supreme Court denied Swanner\u2019s request for review.</p>\n<p id=\"b801-11\">Swanner then sought state post-conviction relief pursuant to Kan. Stat. Ann. \u00a7 60-1507, arguing that he was denied his Sixth Amendment right to effective assistance of counsel because his trial attorney was operating under a conflict of interest. The state district court denied relief, and the Kansas Court of Appeals affirmed the district court. <em>Swanner v. Nelson, </em>No. 91,416, 2005 WL 1661297, at *8 (Kan.Ct. App. Nov.2, 2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b801-15\">Before the federal district court, Swanner raised the same claim in his \u00a7 2254 petition as he raised in his state post-conviction relief motion. The district court denied Swanner\u2019s petition. Swanner filed a timely notice of appeal, as well as an application for a COA.</p>\n<p id=\"b801-16\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b801-17\">Issuance of a COA is jurisdictional. <em>Miller-El v. Cockrell, </em>537 U.S. 322, 336, 123 S.Ct. 1029,154 L.Ed.2d 931 (2003). In other words, a state prisoner may appeal from the denial of federal habeas relief under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254 only if the district court or this court first issues a COA. 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2253(c)(1)(A). A COA may be issued \u201conly if the applicant has made a substantial showing of the denial of a constitutional right.\u201d 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2253(c)(2). In order to make that showing, a prisoner must demonstrate \u201cthat reasonable jurists could debate whether (or, for that matter, agree that) the petition should have been resolved in a different manner or that the issues presented were adequate to deserve encouragement to proceed further.\u201d <em>Slack v. McDaniel, </em>529 U.S. 473, 484, 120 S.Ct. 1595, 146 L.Ed.2d 542 (2000) (internal quotations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b801-18\">III</p>\n<p id=\"b801-19\">Swanner seeks a COA with respect to the ineffective assistance of counsel issue raised in his federal habeas petition. Swanner argues that his trial counsel was under an actual conflict of interest arising from a disciplinary complaint against him, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"778\">*778</page-number>and that therefore, Swanner\u2019s defense was adversely impacted. Because the Kansas Court of Appeals addressed this claim on the merits in affirming the denial of post-conviction relief, Swanner can only prevail on this claim in this federal habeas proceeding if he can demonstrate that the state court\u2019s ruling was \u201ccontrary to, or involved an unreasonable application of, clearly established Federal law, as determined by the Supreme Court of the United States,\u201d or was based on an unreasonable determination of the facts in light of the evidence presented in the State court proceeding. 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254(d)(1), (2).</p>\n<p id=\"b802-3\">Claims of ineffective assistance of counsel are governed by the Supreme Court\u2019s decision in <em>Strickland v. Washington, </em>466 U.S. 668, 104 S.Ct. 2052, 80 L.Ed.2d 674 (1984). <em>To </em>support such a claim, a defendant must show that his attorney\u2019s performance \u201c \u2018fell below an objective standard of reasonableness\u2019 and that the unreasonably deficient performance resulted in prejudice.\u201d <em>Lucero v. Kerby, </em>133 F.3d 1299, 1323 (10th Cir.1998) (quoting <em>Strickland, </em>466 U.S. at 688, 691-92, 104 S.Ct. 2052).</p>\n<p id=\"b802-4\">The district court concluded that the Kansas Court of Appeals, in rejecting Swanner\u2019s ineffective assistance of counsel claim, reasonably applied the <em>Strickland </em>standard. More specifically, the district court agreed that the more stringent standard found in <em>Cuyler v. Sullivan, </em>446 U.S. 335, 100 S.Ct. 1708, 64 L.Ed.2d 333 (1980), which presumes prejudice to a defendant claiming ineffective assistance of counsel when that defendant shows an actual conflict of interest adversely affected the counsel\u2019s performance, was inapplicable because no \u201cactual conflict\u201d existed. The district court also agreed with the Kansas Court of Appeals that Swanner had not satisfied the <em>Strickland </em>standard because he had failed to demonstrate any reasonable probability that the outcome of his trial would have been different but for his counsel\u2019s alleged deficient performance.</p>\n<p id=\"b802-6\">After examining the record on appeal, we conclude that Swanner has not demonstrated that \u201creasonable jurists could debate whether\u201d his ineffective assistance of trial counsel claim \u201cshould have been resolved in a different manner or ... w[as] adequate to deserve encouragement to proceed further.\u201d <em>Slack, </em>529 U.S. at 484, 120 S.Ct. 1595. Swanner is therefore not entitled to a COA on his claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b802-7\">IV</p>\n<p id=\"b802-8\">After carefully reviewing Swanner\u2019s appellate pleadings and the record on appeal, we conclude he has failed to establish that \u201creasonable jurists could debate whether\u201d his habeas petition \u201cshould have been resolved in a different manner or ... w[as] adequate to deserve encouragement to proceed further.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b802-9\">We therefore DENY Swanner\u2019s request for a COA and DISMISS the matter.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b801-12\"> This order is not binding precedent, except under the doctrines of law of the case, res judicata, and collateral estoppel.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
