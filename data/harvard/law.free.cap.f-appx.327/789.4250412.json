HENRY, Circuit Judge.</author>\n<p id=\"b813-28\">After examining the briefs and appellate record, this panel has determined unani<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"790\">*790</page-number>mously that oral argument would not materially assist in the determination of this appeal. <em>See </em>Fed. R.App. P. 34(a)(2); 10th Cir. R. 34.1(G). The case is therefore ordered submitted without oral argument.</p>\n<p id=\"b814-4\">This is the fourth sentencing-related appeal in this case. In this proceeding, Dedrick Caldwell challenges the district court\u2019s order denying his motion for sentence reduction pursuant to 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582(c)(2). Because Mr. Caldwell was a career offender, his advisory guideline range would not change with the retroactive application of the Amendment 706. Exercising our jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291 and 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3742(a), we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b814-5\">In 1994, Mr. Caldwell was convicted by a jury of one count of unlawful possession with intent to distribute and distribution of more than five grams of cocaine base, in violation of 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 841(a)(1). Prior to trial, the government filed an information pursuant to 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 851 alleging that defendant had a prior felony drug conviction that would enhance his statutory maximum sentence. After three sentencing hearings, the district court resentenced Mr. Caldwell as a career offender (under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4B1.1) to 262 months\u2019 imprisonment. <em>See United States v. Caldwell, </em>21 Fed.Appx. 810 (10th Cir.2001); <em>United States v. Caldwell, </em>219 F.3d 1186 (10th Cir.2000); <em>United States v. Caldwell, </em>Nos. 95-1003, -1023, 1996 WL 185749 (10th Cir. Apr.17,1996).</p>\n<p id=\"b814-6\">In July 2007, Mr. Caldwell filed a motion in the district court to modify his sentence pursuant to the retroactive application of Amendment 706 of the Guidelines.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> In reviewing the motion, the district court determined that, because it had sentenced Mr. Caldwell as a career offender under 4B1.1, he was not eligible for a corresponding reduction of his sentence under Amendment 706 and U.S.S.G. \u00a7 B1.10(a)(2)(B), and denied the motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b814-11\">Before this court, Mr. Caldwell argues the recent guidelines amendments do apply to him. We review de novo the district court\u2019s scope of authority in a resentencing proceeding under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582(c)(2) as well as its interpretation of a statute or the Guidelines. <em>United States v. Sharkey, </em>543 F.3d 1236, 1238 (10th Cir.2008). We review the district court\u2019s decision to deny a reduction in sentence under \u00a7 3582(c)(2) for an abuse of discretion. <em>Id. </em>\u201cWhen a motion for [a] sentence reduction is not a direct appeal or a collateral attack under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255, the viability of [the] motion depends entirely on 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582(c).\u201d <em>Id. </em>(alterations in original) (internal quotation marks omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b814-12\">Mr. Caldwell acknowledges that under <em>Sharkey, </em>543 F.3d at 1239, we have held that \u201cAmendment 706 had no effect on the career offender guidelines in \u00a7 4B1.1, which were the guidelines used by the district court in sentencing [him].\u201d <em>See </em>Aplt\u2019s Br. at 9 (citing Sharkey). Here, as in <em>Sharkey, </em>we \u25a0 acknowledge that \u201chad Amendment 706 been in place\u201d at the time of sentencing, 543 F.3d at 1239, it would have lowered Mr. Caldwell\u2019s base offense level by two levels under \u00a7 2D1.1. However, as Mr. Caldwell points out, after a sentencing court determines the \u00a7 2D1.1 offense level, it applies the career-offender section, \u00a7 4B1.1, comparing the career offender offense level with the \u00a7 2D1.1 offense level. The court then must select the greater of the two, and consider any policy statements or commentary regard<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"791\">*791</page-number>ing departure. Aplt\u2019s Br. at 10; U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4Bl.l(b) (providing that \u201cif the offense level for a career offender ... is greater than the offense level otherwise applicable, the offense level from the table in this subsection shall apply\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b815-5\">Because Mr. Caldwell\u2019s argument is foreclosed by our decision in <em>Sharkey, </em>548 F.3d at 1239, we hold that the district court did not err when it denied his motion. We AFFIRM the district court\u2019s order denying Mr. Caldwell\u2019s motion filed pursuant to 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582(c)(2) for a downward variance under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a).</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b813-17\"> This order and judgment is not binding precedent except under the doctrines of law of the case, res judicata and collateral estoppel.
