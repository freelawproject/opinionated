Cruz contends, as the Immigration Judge (IJ) concluded, that his application should have been granted because he will be persecuted on account of his membership in a particular social group consisting of young Honduran males targeted by gangs for recruitment. (Because Cruz has not challenged the BIA\u2019s conclusion that he was not entitled to withholding of removal or relief under the Convention Against Torture, any such claims are abandoned. <em>See Soadjede v. Ashcroft, </em>324 F.3d 830, 833 (5th Cir.2003).)</p>\n<p id=\"b537-21\">In reviewing decisions of the BIA, we review questions of law <em>de novo </em>but defer \u201cto the BIA\u2019s interpretation of immigration statutes unless the record reveals compelling evidence that the BIA\u2019s interpretation is incorrect\u201d. <em>Gomez-Palacios v. Holder, </em>560 F.3d 354, 358 (5th Cir.2009). Findings of fact are reviewed for substantial evidence. <em>Id. </em>\u201cThis court reviews the order of the BIA and will consider the underlying decision of the IJ only if it influenced the determination of the BIA.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b537-22\">Cruz contends the BIA erred in failing to consider the history of harassment and mistreatment suffered by Cruz and his family at the hands of gang members. Cruz maintains the BIA should have considered documentary evidence showing the Honduran population in general has problems with gang members and young men are typically recruited for gang member<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"514\">*514</page-number>ship. Cruz has not established the evidence compels a contrary conclusion from that reached by the BIA. <em>See Eduard v.
