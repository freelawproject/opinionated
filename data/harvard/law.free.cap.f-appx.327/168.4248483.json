On appeal, Taylor argues that the court abused its discretion by failing to consider the 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a) factors in determining the extent to which a reduction was warranted. Taylor further argues that the court should have granted more than the two-level reduction that was authorized by Amendment 706, and that the guidelines policy statements limiting the court\u2019s discretion in reducing a sentence are invalid in light of <em>United States v. Booker, </em>543 U.S. 220, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005), and <em>Kimbrough v. United States, </em>552 U.S. 85, 128 S.Ct. 558, 169 L.Ed.2d 481 (2007).</p>\n<p id=\"b193-16\">\u201cWe review <em>de novo </em>a district court\u2019s conclusions about the scope of its legal authority under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582(c)(2).\u201d <em>United States v. James, </em>548 F.3d 983, 984 (11th Cir.2008). We review a district court\u2019s decision whether to reduce a defendant\u2019s sentence pursuant to \u00a7 3582(c)(2) for an abuse of discretion. <em>United States v. Brown, </em>332 F.3d 1341, 1343 (11th Cir. 2003).</p>\n<p id=\"b193-17\">A district court may reduce a defendant\u2019s sentence if he has been \u201csentenced to a term of imprisonment based on a sentencing range that has subsequently been lowered ..., after considering the factors set forth in section 3553(a) to the extent that they are applicable, if such a reduction is consistent with applicable policy statements issued by the Sentencing Commission.\u201d 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582(c)(2). In determining whether to reduce a defendant\u2019s sentence under \u00a7 3582(c)(2), the district court must engage in a two-step analysis:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b193-18\">First, the court must substitute the amended guideline range for the originally applied guideline range and determine what sentence it would have imposed. In undertaking this first step, only the amended guideline range is changed. All other guideline application decisions made during the original sen-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"170\">*170</page-number>tenting remain intact ... Second, in light of the conclusion reached in the first step, the court <em>must </em>consider the factors listed in \u00a7 3553(a) and determine whether or not <em>to </em>reduce the defendant\u2019s original sentence.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b194-4\"><em>United States v. Vautier, </em>144 F.3d 756, 760 (11th Cir.1998) (citations omitted, emphasis added). The applicable policy statements instruct that, in considering whether and to what extent a reduction is warranted, the court <em>shall </em>consider the \u00a7 3553(a) factors and public safety concerns, and it may consider the defendant\u2019s post-sentencing conduct. U.S.S.G. \u00a7 1B1.10, comment. (n.1(B)) (emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b194-5\">We have held that \u201ca district court commits no reversible error by failing to articulate specifically the applicability\u2014if any\u2014of each of the section 3553(a) factors, as long as the record demonstrates that the pertinent factors were taken into account by the district court.\u201d <em>United States v. Eggersdorf, </em>126 F.3d 1318, 1322 (11th Cir.1997). However, we recently vacated and remanded the <em>grant </em>of a \u00a7 3582(c)(2) reduction where the record failed to indicate whether the district court considered the \u00a7 3553(a) factors. <em>United States v. Williams, </em>557 F.3d 1254, 1257 (11th Cir. 2009).</p>\n<p id=\"b194-6\">After reviewing the record, we conclude that the district court correctly calculated Taylor\u2019s amended offense level and reduced guideline range. Contrary to Taylor\u2019s contention on appeal, the district court was not permitted to reduce his offense level beyond the two-level reduction authorized by Amendment 706. However, the district court\u2019s order granting the reduction to the middle of the amended range provides only that the court considered Taylor\u2019s \u00a7 3582(c)(2) motion. Because Taylor\u2019s motion contained no analysis of the specific factors that were relevant to the \u00a7 3553(a) inquiry, except for Taylor\u2019s post-conviction conduct, and the district court did not otherwise explain its decision, the record does not clearly indicate whether the court properly considered the pertinent factors. As a result, we vacate and remand for further consideration and explanation.</p>\n<p id=\"b194-8\">VACATED AND REMANDED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
