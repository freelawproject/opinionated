Jones appeals the district court\u2019s order denying his motion for modification of sentence pursuant to 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582(c)(2) (2006). Jones argues that the district court erred by failing to reduce his sentence based upon Amendment 706 of the Guidelines. <em>See U.S. Sentencing Guidelines Manual </em>\u00a7 2D1.1(c) (2007 &amp; Supp.2008); USSG App. C Amend. 706. As we recently observed, \u201cAmendment 706 ... amended \u00a7 2D1.1 of the Sentencing Guidelines by reducing the offense levels associated with crack cocaine quantities by two levels.\u201d <em>United States v. Hood, </em>556 F.3d 226, 232 (4th Cir.2009). Jones\u2019s guideline range, because of a statutory mandatory minimum sentence, was 120 to 135 months. He was sentenced to 120 months, a sentence later reduced to 108 months for substantial assistance, under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(e) (2006) and USSG \u00a7 5K1.1.</p>\n<p id=\"b445-25\">The district court correctly concluded that, on account of the statutory mandatory minimum, Amendment 706 \u201cdoes not have the effect of lowering\u201d Jones\u2019s guideline range. USSG 1B1.10, p.s., cmt. n. 1(A). Accordingly, a reduction in Jones\u2019s sentence is not authorized under \u00a7 3582(e)(2). Further, the fact that the district court reduced Jones\u2019s sentence for substantial assistance is irrelevant to the applicability of Amendment 706. <em>Hood, </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"422\">*422</page-number>556 F.3d at 234. Accordingly, we affirm the decision of the district court. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b446-4\">\n<em>AFFIRMED.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
