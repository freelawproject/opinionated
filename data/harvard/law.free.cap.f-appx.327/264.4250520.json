Feb. 14, 2008), <em>aff'g </em>No. A200 032 088 (Immig. Ct. N.Y. City Jul. 11, 2006). We assume the parties\u2019 familiarity with the underlying facts and procedural history in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b288-24\">When the BIA does not expressly \u201cadopt\u201d the IJ\u2019s decision, but its brief opinion closely tracks the IJ\u2019s reasoning, the Court may consider both the IJ\u2019s and the BIA\u2019s opinions for the sake of complete<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"265\">*265</page-number>ness if doing so does not affect the Court\u2019s ultimate conclusion. <em>Jigme Wangchuck v. DHS, </em>448 F.3d 524, 528 (2d Cir.2006). We review the agency\u2019s factual findings, including adverse credibility findings, under the substantial evidence standard. 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(b)(4)(B); <em>see also Xiu Xia Lin v. Mukasey, </em>534 F.3d 162, 165-66 (2d Cir.2008).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b289-5\">Substantial evidence supports the agency\u2019s adverse determination. In finding Yu not credible, the IJ properly relied on Yu\u2019s discrepant account of her attempt to register her daughter\u2019s birth. <em>See Liang Chen v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>454 F.3d 103, 106-107 (2d Cir.2006). While Yu stated in her asylum application and during her direct testimony that she returned home after officials told her she would need to pay a fine and be sterilized in order to register her daughter\u2019s birth, during cross-examination she claimed that she ran out the back door of the office because she was afraid of being arrested. When confronted with the discrepancy, she testified that she \u201cdidn\u2019t understand it.\u201d The IJ reasonably rejected that explanation and relied on the discrepancy in finding Yu not credible. <em>See Liang Chen, </em>454 F.3d at 106-107; <em>see Majidi v. Gonzales, </em>430 F.3d 77, 80-81 (2d Cir .2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b289-6\">We also afford particular deference to the IJ\u2019s assessment of Yu\u2019s demeanor where the IJ was in the unique position of observing her testify. <em>See Majidi, </em>430 F.3d at 81 n. 1. After observing that testimony, the IJ found that Yu\u2019s demean- or indicated that she was not testifying in a credible manner, noting that she was frequently \u201cvery hesitant in answering questions\u201d and that it appeared that \u201cshe [was] trying to follow a poorly rehearsed script.\u201d We are in no position to disturb such findings. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b289-9\">Finally, as the IJ did not find Yu\u2019s testimony credible, she properly noted the absence of documentary evidence that may have corroborated her claim. <em>See Xiao Ji Chen v. U.S. Dep\u2019t of Justice, </em>471 F.3d 315, 341 (2d Cir.2006). Thus, we decline to disturb the agency\u2019s adverse credibility determination. 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1158(b)(l)(B)(iii); <em>see also Xiu Xia Lin, </em>534 F.3d at 165-66. Because Yu based her claims for asylum, withholding of removal, and CAT relief on the same factual predicate, each of her claims necessarily fails. <em>See Paul v. Gonzales, </em>444 F.3d 148,156 (2d Cir.2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b289-10\">For the foregoing reasons, the petition for review is DENIED. As we have completed our review, any stay of removal that the Court previously granted in this petition is VACATED, and any pending motion for a stay of removal in this petition is DISMISSED as moot. Any pending request for oral argument in this petition is DENIED in accordance with Federal Rule of Appellate Procedure 34(a)(2), and Second Circuit Local Rule 34(b).</p>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b289-7\">.
