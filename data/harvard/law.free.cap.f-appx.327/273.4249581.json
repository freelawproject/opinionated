A 98 346 829/830 (B.I.A. Dec. 31, 2007), <em>affg </em>Nos. A 98 346 829/830 (Immig. Ct. N.Y. City May 10, 2006). We assume the parties\u2019 familiarity with the underlying facts and procedural history in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b298-13\">When the BIA affirms the IJ\u2019s decision in all respects but one, we review the IJ\u2019s decision as modified by the BIA decision\u2014 that is minus the single argument that the BIA did not rely upon in rendering its decision. <em>See Xue Hong Yang v. U.S. Dep\u2019t of Justice, </em>426 F.3d 520, 522 (2d Cir.2005). We review the agency\u2019s factual findings under the substantial evidence standard, treating them as \u201cconclusive unless any reasonable adjudicator would be compelled to conclude to the contrary.\u201d 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(b)(4)(B); <em>see, e.g., Corovic v. Mukasey, </em>519 F.3d 90, 95 (2d Cir.2008). We review <em>de novo </em>questions of law and the application of law to fact. <em>See, e.g., Passi v. Mukasey, 535 F.3d </em>98, 101 (2d Cir.2008).</p>\n<p id=\"b298-14\">Substantial evidence supports the agency's determination that there has been a fundamental change of circumstances in Albania such that Nexhmije Ramadani no longer has a well-founded fear of persecution. <em>See 8 </em>C.F.R. \u00a7 1208.13(b)(l)(i). Ramadani argues that the agency failed to adequately address the particular circumstances of her claim. This argument ignores <em>Hoxhallari v. Gonzales: </em>the agency need not enter specific findings supporting a changed country conditions determination where \u201cchanged conditions evidently prevail in a country that is the subject of an appreciable proportion of asylum claims,\u201d such as Albania. 468 F.3d 179, 187 (2d Cir.2006) (per curiam). In any event, the agency did provide a reasoned basis for its finding. Ramadani\u2019s claim was based on her activities in support of the Democratic Party; but as the BIA found, that party had returned to power, and Ramadani had not experienced problems when it previously controlled the national government. There is record evidence that neither the government nor the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"275\">*275</page-number>major political parties currently engage in abuse or coercion of political opponents. Because Ramadani fails to provide evidence compelling a conclusion contrary to that of the agency, we will not disturb its decision. <em>See Corovic, </em>519 F.3d at 95.</p>\n<p id=\"b299-5\">The changed country conditions finding is supported by the record and is dispositive of Ramadani\u2019s claims for asylum and withholding of removal. Therefore, we need not reach the agency\u2019s alternative findings. <em>See </em>8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1208.13(b)(l)(i)(A); 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1208.16(b)(l)(i)(A).</p>\n<p id=\"b299-8\">Because Ramadani was unable to show the objective likelihood of persecution needed to make out an asylum claim, she cannot meet the higher standard for a withholding of removal claim, because both claims were based upon the same factual predicate. <em>See Paul v. Gonzales, </em>444 F.3d 148, 156 (2d Cir.2006). As to Ramadani\u2019s argument that she is entitled to a humanitarian grant of asylum regardless of changed country conditions, Ramadani failed to raise the issue in her appeal to the BIA, and we decline to consider the unexhausted issue. <em>See Lin Zhong v. U.S. Dep\u2019t of Justice, </em>480 F.3d 104, 118-20 (2d Cir.2007).</p>\n<p id=\"b299-9\">Finally, because Ramadani has failed to sufficiently challenge the agency\u2019s denial of CAT relief, we deem any such argument waived. <em>See Yueqing Zhang v. Gonzales, </em>426 F.3d 540, 541 n. 1, 545 n. 7 (2d Cir.2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b299-10\">For the foregoing reasons, the petition for review is DENIED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
