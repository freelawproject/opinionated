Wiggins seeks to appeal the magistrate judge\u2019s <footnotemark>*</footnotemark> order denying relief on his 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254 (2006) petition, and the subsequent order denying a certificate of appealability. The orders are not appealable unless a circuit justice or judge issues a certif\u00edcate of appealability. <em>See </em>28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2253(c)(1) (2006). A certificate of appealability will not issue absent <em>\u201ca </em>substantial showing of the denial of a constitutional right.\u201d 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2253(c)(2) (2006). A prisoner satisfies this standard by demonstrating that reasonable jurists would find that any assessment of the constitutional claims by the district court is debatable or wrong and that any dispositive procedural ruling by the district court is likewise debatable. <em>See Miller-El v. Cockrell, </em>537 U.S. 322, 336-38, 123 S.Ct. 1029, 154 L.Ed.2d 931 (2003); <em>Slack v. McDaniel, </em>529 U.S. 473, 484, 120 S.Ct. 1595, 146 L.Ed.2d 542 (2000); <em>Rose v. Lee, </em>252 F.3d 676, 683-84 (4th Cir.2001). We have independently reviewed the record and conclude that Wiggins has not made the requisite showing. Accordingly, although we grant Wiggins\u2019 motion to amend his informal brief, we deny certificates of appealability, deny his motion for bond, and dismiss the appeals. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b442-11\">\n<em>DISMISSED.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b442-25\">The parties consented to proceed before a magistrate judge pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 636(c) (2006).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
