The first petition, No. 05-72374, seeks review of the Board of Immigration Appeals\u2019 (\u201cBIA\u201d) denial of petitioners\u2019 application for asylum, withholding of removal, and relief under the Convention Against Torture (\u201cCAT\u201d). The second petition, No. 07-72491, seeks review of the BIA\u2019s denial of petitioners\u2019 motion to reopen on account of changed country conditions. We have jurisdiction pursuant to 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(a)(1), and we grant the petition in part and remand in light of our recent decision in <em>Sinha v. Holder </em>for the agency to clarify the basis of its denial of relief. <em>See </em>564 F.3d 1015 (9th Cir.2009).</p>\n<p id=\"b46-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"22\">*22</page-number>The BIA\u2019s \u201copinion must contain a statement of its reasons for denying the petitioner relief adequate for us to conduct our review, and we must remand for clarification if the Board fails to provide an adequate statement of the reasons for its decision.\u201d <em>Ghaly v. INS, </em>58 F.3d 1425, 1430 (9th Cir.1995). Where, as here, the agency fails to make specific findings regarding the severity of petitioners\u2019 mistreatment, its nexus to a protected ground, and the government\u2019s ability to control those responsible, the proper course is to remand for the agency to make such findings in the first instance. <em>See Sinha, </em>564 F.3d at 1020-21,1023-26.</p>\n<p id=\"b46-4\">We therefore grant the petition in part and remand in light of Sinha for the agency to provide a reasoned explanation for its denial of relief. Because we grant the petition with respect to petitioners\u2019 asylum claim, we vacate submission of case No. 07-72491 \u201cpending further order of the court, and hold it in abeyance pending the BIA\u2019s ruling on remand.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1026. We note that the agency may find it appropriate to consider petitioners\u2019 evidence of changed country conditions on remand, in which case petitioners\u2019 appeal from the BIA\u2019s denial of their motion to reopen would most likely become moot. In either event, the parties should advise this Court when the agency\u2019s proceedings on remand are concluded, and inform us of whether any issues remain for our review at that time.</p>\n<p id=\"b46-5\">GRANTED and REMANDED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b45-20\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9th Cir.
