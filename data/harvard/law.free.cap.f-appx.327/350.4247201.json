Irorere, a native and citizen of Nigeria, seeks review of final orders issued by the Board of Immigration Appeals (\u201cBIA\u201d). For the reasons that follow, we will grant the petitions for review.</p>\n<p id=\"b375-18\">On July 10, 1998, Irorere adjusted his immigration status to lawful permanent resident on a conditional basis under section 216 of the Immigration and Nationality Act (\u201cINA\u201d) based upon his marriage to a United States citizen. Under section 216, legal status is granted for two years, but within ninety days before that period expires, the alien and his spouse must apply for the removal of conditional status on a Form 1-751 and present evidence of a bona fide marriage. See 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 216.4. Alternatively, if an alien or his spouse is unable to file a joint application, the alien may seek a waiver. INA \u00a7 216(c)(4) [8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1186a(c)(4) ]. Irorere failed to apply for removal of the conditions or to seek a waiver, so his conditional resident status expired as of July 11, 2000. The government instituted removal proceedings in July 2006.</p>\n<p id=\"b375-19\">After a hearing, the Immigration Judge (\u201cIJ\u201d) found Irorere to be removable. Irorere, then represented by counsel, requested a continuance so that he could pursue a Form 1-130 immediate relative visa petition<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> to once again adjust his status as a lawful permanent resident. The IJ found that Irorere was prima facie eligible to adjust his status but also found that he did not have an approved 1-130 visa petition and had not arranged for one to be filed in advance of the hearing. Moreover, the IJ did not believe that the Department of Homeland Security would expedite any such petition because Irorere had been convicted of a crime.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Combined with factors including Irorere\u2019s failure to take any corrective action for more than <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"352\">*352</page-number>six years, the IJ denied Irorere\u2019s request for a continuance.</p>\n<p id=\"b376-4\">The BIA dismissed Irorere\u2019s <em>pro se </em>appeal. In addition to the above findings, the BIA noted the IJ\u2019s finding at the hearing that Irorere, through counsel, stated that the sole reason he had not timely filed an 1-751 petition to remove the conditions on residence was that he was unaware of the requirement to do so; the IJ found the explanation did not constitute good cause or extenuating circumstances under INA \u00a7 216(d)(2)(B) to excuse the failure to timely file the 1-751. The BIA also noted that while Irorere had presented \u201ca litany of events\u201d to the BIA to explain his failure to timely file, these arguments were not raised below and could not be considered by the BIA in the first instance. The BIA found no error in the IJ\u2019s denial of Irorere\u2019s request for a continuance and found no merit to Irorere\u2019s claim that he was prevented from presenting evidence to the IJ. The BIA then denied Irorere\u2019s post-decision motion, construed either as a motion to reopen or as a motion for reconsideration. Irorere filed <em>pro se </em>petitions for review of both decisions.</p>\n<p id=\"b376-5\">The government has filed a motion to dismiss the petitions for review, asserting that under 8 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1252(a)(2)(B)(ii), we lack jurisdiction to review discretionary decisions by the agency. The government states that this matter involves the agency\u2019s discretionary denial of Irorere\u2019s request to file an 1-751 beyond the typical ninety-day filing period. The government appears to refer to the IJ\u2019s finding at the hearing that Irorere presented no good cause or extenuating circumstances under INA \u00a7 216(d)(2)(B) to excuse the failure to timely file the 1-751. However, to the extent that the agency decisions were based upon the IJ\u2019s denial of Irorere\u2019s motion for a continuance to pursue a Form 1-130 petition, we have jurisdiction over the petition for review, and we review the denial of a continuance for an abuse of discretion. <em>See Khan v. Attorney General, </em>448 F.3d 226, 233 (3d Cir.2006). Moreover, as the government concedes, we have jurisdiction to review questions of law or constitutional issues raised in Irorere\u2019s petition for review. <em>See </em>8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(a)(2)(D).</p>\n<p id=\"b376-8\">Several of Irorere\u2019s issues warrant only brief discussion. First, Irorere argues that the agency erred in requiring him to file a new Form 1-130 immediate relative petition, given that he already has an approved 1-130 petition. Irorere refers to the 1-130 form prepared in 1997 upon which his immigration status was adjusted in 1998. However, Irorere\u2019s conditional resident status expired and was terminated in 2001, effective July 2000. There is no evidence in the record that he had a <em>current </em>approved 1-130 petition at the time of the IJ hearing.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Next, Irorere contends that the IJ erroneously made his criminal conviction\u2014a non-deportable offense\u2014a \u201ckey part of the deportation.\u201d Petr.\u2019s Brief at 19. We disagree, as it is plain that the IJ found Irorere to be removable as charged because his lawful resident status had terminated as a matter of law, not because of his conviction. Also, Irorere argues that the IJ erred in combining a bond hearing with his removal <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"353\">*353</page-number>hearing in contravention of 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 3.19(d) (now 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1003.19(d)). The BIA noted in its decision that bond and removal proceedings are separate and apart. BIA Jan. 19, 2007 Decision at 3. Upon review of the hearing transcript, although the IJ observed that Irorere may not be eligible for bond, it does not appear that the IJ conducted a bond hearing or entered any determination with respect to Irorere\u2019s custody status or bond. We discern no error on these issues.</p>\n<p id=\"b377-5\">We now address Irorere\u2019s due process argument. Irorere claims that the IJ prevented him a meaningful opportunity to show good cause and extenuating circumstances for failing to timely file an 1-751. The BIA found no merit to Irorere\u2019s argument. Noting that the IJ did not allow Irorere to read from a lengthy prepared statement, the BIA stated that the IJ invited Irorere to tell his story in his own words after his counsel had finished presenting his case. Thus, the BIA concluded that Irorere had the opportunity to present whatever information he wanted before the IJ entered his decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b377-6\">Notwithstanding the BIA\u2019s description of events, the transcript of the hearing reflects that the IJ interrupted Irorere\u2019s presentation mid-sentence, after only a few words, and did not allow any further argument or evidence. Instead, the IJ indicated that he had already reached his decision in the case, advised Irorere to appeal to the BIA if he so wished, and proceeded to issue the oral decision. (Oct. 3, 2006 Tr. at 6-8.) We reject the BIA\u2019s conclusion that Irorere was not prevented from presenting evidence at the hearing. We note that on appeal to the BIA, Irorere preserved this issue and proffered details concerning a showing of extenuating circumstances. The BIA characterized Irorere\u2019s allegations as \u201ca litany of events\u201d to make a showing under INA \u00a7 216(d)(2)(B), <em>see </em>BIA Decision at 2, but the BIA refused to consider those assertions in the first instance because none of the arguments were raised before the IJ. However, it appears from Irorere\u2019s position that he did not present those arguments to the IJ because the IJ denied him the opportunity to do so.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b377-9\">We will grant the petitions for review and remand to the agency for further proceedings consistent with this opinion. The government\u2019s motion to dismiss is denied.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b375-15\">. Irorere remains married to the same United States citizen who filed the previous 1-130 petition on his behalf.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b375-20\">. In his brief to the BIA, Irorere states that he was convicted of fraud.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b376-6\">. It appears from Irorere\u2019s argument that he believes that his previously-approved 1\u2014130 remains viable today, notwithstanding the conditional nature of his adjustment of status and the eventual expiration of that status. Because the IJ found no good cause or extenuating circumstances to excuse the failure to timely file a Form 1-751, and because Irorere had not applied for a waiver, Irorere\u2019s path under that scenario would be to once again pursue an 1-130 petition to adjust his status back to lawful permanent resident. Indeed, Irorere\u2019s former counsel requested a continuance for that very purpose.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b377-7\">. Irorere argues in his response to the government\u2019s motion to dismiss that the BIA erred in failing to grant a continuance for him to apply for a hardship waiver under INA \u00a7 216(c)(4) because he is prima facie eligible to adjust his status. The BIA did not address the issue. However, although this issue is noted in his petition for review, Irorere did not raise this argument in his brief, so we deem the argument waived. <em>See United States v. Quillen, </em>335 F.3d 219, 224 (3d Cir.2003).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
