The Honorable Brian Stacy Miller, United States District Judge for the Eastern District of Arkansas, sitting by designation.</p>\n</footnote>\n<opinion data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b699-23\">PER CURIAM.</author>\n<p id=\"b699-24\">In 1996, Paul Moore was convicted by a jury of conspiracy to possess with intent to distribute cocaine and cocaine base, commonly known as \u201ccrack,\u201d in violation of 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 846, aiding and abetting possession with intent to distribute cocaine in violation of 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 841(a)(1) and 841(b)(1)(B) and 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2, possession with intent to distribute crack in violation of 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 841(a)(1) and 841(b)(1)(A), and being a felon in possession of a firearm in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 922(g)(1). At sentencing, the district court<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> found Moore\u2019s Guidelines range to be 262 to 327 months, and sentenced him to 262 months imprisonment.</p>\n<p id=\"b699-25\">In 2008, Moore moved for a reduction in his sentence pursuant to 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582(c) and Amendment 706 to the Guidelines, which reduced the base offense level for crack offenses by two levels. He also sought to reduce his sentence by more than two levels based on the factors set forth in 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a) and alleged errors in his original sentencing, specifically the application of a firearm enhance<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"676\">*676</page-number>ment and the calculation of his criminal history points.</p>\n<p id=\"b700-4\">The district court calculated an amended Guidelines range of 210 to 262 months, and resentenced Moore to 210 months imprisonment. The court denied Moore\u2019s request to further reduce his sentence, stating \u201cthe Court finds no legal or factual basis to grant Moore\u2019s request for a resentencing hearing or for imposing a sentence below the newly applicable guidelines range of 210 to 262 months.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b700-5\">Moore appeals, arguing that the district court had authority to reduce his sentence below the amended Guidelines range and erred by not doing so. His argument, however, is foreclosed by <em>United States v. Starks, </em>551 F.3d 839 (8th Cir.2009), in which we held a resentencing court does not have the authority to reduce a defendant\u2019s sentence to a term below the amended Guidelines range. <em>Id. </em>at 843. The district court thus did not err in refusing to consider a further reduction in Moore\u2019s sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b700-6\">Additionally, as noted in <em>Starks, </em>\u201cproceedings under \u00a7 3582(c) \u2018do not constitute a full resentencing of the defendant.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>at 842 (citing U.S. Sentencing Guidelines Manual (U.S.S.G.) \u00a7 lB1.10(a)(3)). The district court may only consider the Guidelines amendment at issue and \u201cshall leave all other [Guideline applications decisions unaffected.\u201d U.S.S.G. \u00a7 1B1.10(b)(1). As such, the district court did not err by rejecting Moore\u2019s arguments regarding the alleged errors in his original sentencing.</p>\n<p id=\"b700-7\">For these reasons, the judgment of the district court is affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b699-26\">.
