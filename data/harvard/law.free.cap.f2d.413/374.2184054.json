In 1959 he assigned this license to Radio KDAN, taking back a purchase money mortgage as part of the consideration for the sale. In 1961 KDAN defaulted on the mortgage and, through foreclosure proceedings, Appellant regained possession of the station\u2019s real and personal property. During this period, however, Radio KDAN had been \u201coff the air\u201d for ten months without Commission approval.</p>\n<p id=\"b439-11\">In May 1967 Appellant, as assignee of the licensee, filed with the Commission an assignment application for the KDAN license. This application was received but never formally filed or accepted by the Commission due to the absence of the assignor\u2019s section of the application. Appellant attempted to remedy this omission by executing the assignor\u2019s portion of the application; in doing so Appellant sought to rely on a \u201crider\u201d which had been added to the mortgage subsequent to the Commission\u2019s 1959 approval of the initial assignment. The \u201crider,\u201d which was not filed with the Commission until July 1967,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> provides, in pertinent part\u2014</p>\n<p id=\"b439-16\">Mortgagor [Radio KDAN] irrevocably appoints Mortgagee [Appellant] as Mortgagor\u2019s attorney in fact for the purpose of applying to the FCC for transfer of said license to Mortgagee in the event of default by Mortgagor under this mortgage or the note which the same secures and the exercise of any of Mortgagee\u2019s rights hereunder by Mortgagee upon such default.</p>\n<p id=\"b439-17\">While this application was pending, Radio KDAN filed a separate application to assign its license to one Phil Jackson; Appellant filed a Petition to Deny this application. The Commission denied the KDAN-Jaekson application on the ground that it \u201ccontemplate [d] little more than the sale of the naked license\u201d and that \u201cCommission policy bars such a sale.\u201d<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> At the same time the Commission dismissed Appellant\u2019s assignment petition on the grounds that the license had been forfeited by Radio KDAN for non-use,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> thereby rendering moot Appellant\u2019s application.</p>\n<p id=\"b439-18\">In a footnote to its decision the Commission addressed itself to the efficacy of the mortgage \u201crider,\u201d and declared the clause \u201cvoid <em>ab initio </em>since it attempts to retain for [Appellant] a re-versionary interest in the KDAN license, and as such is expressly forbidden by Section 73.19 of [the Commission\u2019s] rules.\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"376\">*376</page-number>At the close of the sam\u00e9 footnote the Commission stated that \u201c[w]e need not treat of this matter at length, however, because our action today in declaring forfeit the KDAN license renders it moot.\u201d In subsequently denying Appellant\u2019s petition for reconsideration the Commission recited both the prior finding of forfeiture for non-use and the invalidity of the mortgage \u201crider\u201d.</p>\n<p id=\"b440-4\">In urging reversal Appellant argues that the Commission erred in holding that the mortgage \u201crider\u201d clause was void <em>ab initio. </em>We find it unnecessary to reach this issue, however, since the Commission\u2019s dispositive action was to cancel KDAN\u2019s outstanding license, in consequence of which it determined that Appellant\u2019s assignment application became moot. Neither on this appeal nor in the administrative proceedings below has Appellant challenged the validity of the Commission\u2019s action declaring forfeit the KDAN license or its dismissing as moot Appellant\u2019s application to assign such forfeited license. Appellant\u2019s petition for reconsideration asked only that the Commission hold \u201cin abeyance the cancellation of the license for KDAN.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"ABpV\">Under 47 U.S.C. \u00a7 405 (1962) this court is precluded from entertaining objections to issues which the Commission has not first been invited to rule upon through a petition for rehearing. <em>See, e.g., </em>Albertson v. FCC, 100 U.S.App.D.C. 103, 105, 243 F.2d 209, 211 (1957). Section 405\u2019s prohibition of judicial review reflects the well settled doctrine expressed by Chief Justice Yin-son that</p>\n<p id=\"b440-5\">A reviewing court usurps the agency\u2019s function when it sets aside the administrative determination upon a ground not theretofore presented and deprives the Commission of an opportunity to consider the matter, make its ruling, and state the reasons for its action. Unemployment Compensation Comm. v. Aragon, 329 U.S. 143, 155, 67 S.Ct. 245, 251, 91 L.Ed. 136 (1946).</p>\n<p id=\"b440-6\">No reasons have been advanced which would justify our departing from this sound rule in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b440-7\">Our conclusion that affirmance is compelled by Appellant\u2019s failure to challenge the forfeiture ruling does not require approval or disapproval of the Commission\u2019s findings either on that issue or the mortgage \u201crider\u201d issue; accordingly, we do not reach or pass on the Commission\u2019s contentions on those issues.</p>\n<p id=\"b440-8\">Affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b439-12\">. There is some dispute as to whether the failure to file the mortgage \u201crider\u201d with the Commission in 1959 was a violation of 47 C.F.R. \u00a7\u00a7 1.540 and 1.613(b) (5). Our disposition of the case renders it unnecessary to discuss this issue.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b439-19\">. The Commission here relied on 47 U.S.C. \u00a7 301 (1962), which provides for the use of radio frequencies \u201cbut not the ownership thereof\u201d by licensees. <em>See also </em>47 U.S.C. \u00a7 309(h) (1962).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b439-21\">. <em>See </em>47 C.F.R. \u00a7\u00a7 73.73, 73.82 and 73.91.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
