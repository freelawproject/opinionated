Foley v. Hershey, 7 Cir., 1969, 409 F.2d 827; Bowen v. Hershey, 1 Cir., 1969, 410 F.2d 962. See generally Oestereich v. Selective Serv. Sys. L. Bd. No. 11, Cheyenne, Wyo., 393 U.S. 233, 89 S.Ct. 414, 21 L.Ed.2d 402 (1968). On January 28, 1969, the District Court enjoined appellee\u2019s induction into the Armed Forces of the United States over appellants\u2019 objection that a federal court is without jurisdiction to adjudicate a registrant\u2019s claim for a I-S student deferment in a preinduction judicial proceeding.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> 50 U. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1008\">*1008</page-number>S.C.App. \u00a7 460(b) (3);<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Rich v. Hershey, 10 Cir., 1969, 408 F.2d 944. On April 3, 1969,. the appeal was docketed, and on April 23, 1969, a panel of this Court granted appellants\u2019 motion for advancement of the cause for hearing. Oral argument was heard on May 26, 1969. After a careful review of the unusual circumstances of the present case, we conclude that the issues raised herein are moot, and thus we dismiss the appeal. See, e. g., Maner v. Maner, 5 Cir., 1968, 401 F.2d 616.</p>\n<p id=\"b1072-4\">Pursuant to the stipulation of the parties of which we take cognizance, and in the absence of a statutory definition of \u201cacademic year\u201d in the context of a I-S deferment, we find that appellee\u2019s academic year terminated on June 1, 1969. Thus, were we to affirm the District Court on substantive grounds, appellee, at this late date, would not gain any additional relief. Conversely, were we to reverse the lower court, such a reversal would have the same effect as an affirmance, since appellee already obtained a deferment until the end of the academic year. In these circumstances, where appellants have lost their case irrespective of this Court\u2019s disposition on appeal, \u201c \u2018A federal court is without power to decide moot questions or to give advisory opinions which cannot affect the rights of the litigants in the case before it. * * *\u2019 St. Pierre v.

United States v. Munsingwear, 340 U.S. 36, 71 S.Ct. 104 (1950), recognizes that a case may warrant an exception to the general rule of reversing or vacating the judgment below.
