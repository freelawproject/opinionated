First, that cross-examination of a defense witness (who participated in the crimes charged) as to six prior alleged felony convictions when he admitted but three was error; second, that certain unrequested instructions should have been given because this was a complex trial; third, that conducting a trial in a courtroom where noises from outside the room could be heard at times was a denial of due process.</p>\n<p id=\"b1471-27\">We hold there was no error in any of the three matters urged and we affirm the conviction. The appeal approaches the frivolous.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
