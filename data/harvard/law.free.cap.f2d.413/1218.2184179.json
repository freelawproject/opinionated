Their motion for preliminary injunction was overruled, the District Court dismissed the complaint, and they promptly appealed. Subsequently, in 1967, this Court, after a panel had heard arguments on the merits, on its own motion ordered the case to be argued and submitted to the Court en banc in January 1968. Since that time many things have occurred.</p>\n<p id=\"b1283-6\">After the hearing en banc the Court was advised of the passage in March 1968 of Mississippi House Bill 109 amending the attacked sections of the Mississippi Code. This changed the selection from an appointive to an elective process. In April 1968, the State moved the Court to dismiss the appeal as moot due to the passage of H.B. 109. The Court called for full briefs on this point. Appellants opposed this motion on the grounds (a) that H.B. 109 was ineffective for failure of Mississippi to comply with \u00a7 5 of the 1965 Voting Bights Act<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> by submitting H.B. 109 for approval to the United States Attorney General or the District Court for the District of Columbia and (b) that H.B. 109 violates the Fourteenth and Fifteenth Amendments to the United States Constitution.</p>\n<p id=\"b1283-11\">During ,the consideration of these ques-tons, four cases were appealed<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> to the United States Supreme Court, and when the Supreme Court took the question of jurisdiction with the merits, this Court postponed determination in the present case. When the consolidated opinion in these cases was announced in March 1969,<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> this Court again called for additional briefs in the light of the Supreme Court opinion. In response to specific inquiries from the Court concerning the Supreme Court\u2019s decision, \u00a7 5, and the necessity for a 3-Judge Court determination, the Appellants stated categorically:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1283-12\">\u201cIf within fifteen days the state submits House Bill 109 for approval, then this Court should properly await the decision of the Attorney General of the United States. If he should approve the Bill, then this cause is clearly moot as the amended statute will be in full force and effect.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1283-13\">Appellants\u2019 Supplemental Memorandum at 9 (March 28,1969).</p>\n<p id=\"b1284-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1220\">*1220</page-number>On March 24,1969, the State of Mississippi formally submitted the provisions of amended \u00a7\u00a7 3204, 3205 and 3242 (along with the statutes involved in <em>Allen, supra, </em>note 4) to the Attorney General of the United States for his approval. On May 21, 1969, the Attorney General expressly approved the provisions of amended \u00a7\u00a7 3204, 3205 and 3242, while disapproving the other statutes not here involved.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1284-4\">Despite the earlier statement by Appellants, the Court again called for briefs and their previous position was expressly reiterated.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1284-5\">By virtue of this approval the statutes under attack in this cause have been superseded by the amendments of March 28, 1968.

In that earlier memorandum appellants abandoned their constitutional claims. It is appellants\u2019 understanding that the State of Mississippi did submit House Bill 109 to the Attorney General of the United States and that said bill has been approved by the Attorney General. Therefore, appellants having earlier abandoned their constitutional claims and the amendments to Section 3204, 3205 and 3242 now being in full force and effect, it is appellants\u2019 view that this cause is moot.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1284-14\">Appellants\u2019 Supplemental memorandum (June 13, 1969).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b1284-15\">.
