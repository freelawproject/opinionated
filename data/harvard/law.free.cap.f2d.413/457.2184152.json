Finding substantial evidence in the record to support the Board\u2019s conclusion that Brown was fired for protected activity in violation of \u00a7 8(a) (1) of the National Labor Relations Act, 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 158(a) (1), we grant enforcement.</p>\n<p id=\"b521-29\">On March 22, 1967, most of the forty employees in Hanes Hosiery\u2019s shipping department left their work, gathered in the break room adjacent to their work area, and sought to petition management for more pay and more help. They had no union representation. Upon getting a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"458\">*458</page-number>promise that high management would speak to them later, they dispersed and returned to work within about thirty minutes.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Brown was one of two organizers of this protest. Earlier he had moved through the clerk\u2019s section of the shipping department drumming up support. His solicitation took about twenty-five minutes. The next day Brown was away from his work station three times, but not, the Board found on substantial evidence, because he was organizing another work stoppage. Brown was fired within a week.</p>\n<p id=\"b522-4\">The company concedes that the gathering itself was protected activity within \u00a7 7 of the Act. But it argues that Brown was fired not for leading the protest, but for being away from his job and interrupting the work of others the day of the stoppage and the next day.</p>\n<p id=\"b522-5\">The Board, however, found that Brown was discharged because he had organized the first protest and was, management thought, going to lead another. This finding is supported by substantial evidence. Brown testified:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b522-6\">\u201cMr. Ashburn [Brown\u2019s foreman] told Mr. Fredricks [the personnel manager], he said, T would like to dismiss Kenny [Brown].\u2019 And Mr. Fredricks said, \u2018Well, why?\u2019 And he said, \u2018Well, there\u2019s another sit-down. It looks like Kenny is causing the trouble; looks like he\u2019s continued to brew it up. So, it would be best to just dismiss Ken-ney.\u2019 \u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b522-7\">The superintendent of the shipping department corroborated Brown:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b522-8\">\u201cQ. Wait a minute. But as a matter of fact, the sit-down had nothing to do with his discharge, did it?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b522-9\">******</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b522-10\">\u201cA. The . sit-down itself, the fact that Kenny [Brown] was the one who went around to the departments to get the people to sit down the first, added to the fact that here he was doing it a second time, yes, this did have something to do with it.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b522-13\">\u201cQ. The fact that he had done it the first time, too ?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b522-14\">\u201cA. Added to the fact that he was doing it a second time, yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b522-15\">******</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b522-16\">\u201cQ. So you had Mr. Ashburn [Brown\u2019s foreman] make an investigation to determine who caused this work stoppage, right?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b522-17\">\u201cA. Yes, sir.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b522-18\">\u201cQ. And the result of this investigation was that he was the one who caused it, right?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b522-19\">\u201cA. He was the one who came around and got them, yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b522-20\">\u201cQ. And this was one of the things to cause you to decide to discharge him?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b522-21\">\u201cA. One of the things, yes, sir.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b522-22\">Undoubtedly, the fact that a worker takes part in protected activity does not insulate him from discharge for legitimate business reasons. And \u201c[prevention of interference with the work of others while they are busy is a common requirement in industrial plants.\u201d NLRB v. Wix Corp., 309 F.2d 826, 832 (4th Cir. 1962). But business reasons may not be used as a pretext for a discriminatory firing. NLRB v. Overnite Transp. Co., 308 F.2d 284, 288 (4th Cir. 1962). And if a desire to stifle protected activity is a factor in the employer\u2019s decision, the discharge is discriminatory. Winchester Spinning Corp. v. NLRB, 402 F.2d 299, 304 (4th Cir. 1968); NLRB v. Dove Coal Co., 369 F.2d 849, 852 (4th Cir. 1966).</p>\n<p id=\"b522-23\">We enforce the Board\u2019s order.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b522-11\">. Although both the company and the \u25a0workers referred to this protest as a \u201csit-down,\u201d it did not involve a seizure of the plant or a refusal to leave the premises. See NLRB v. Fansteel Metallurgical Corp., 306 U.S. 240, 59 S.Ct. 490, 83 L.Ed. 627 (1939); Cone Mills Corp. v. NLRB, 413 F.2d 445 (4th Cir. 1969).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
