In this action, he claims benefts for accidental injuries under the terms of a master policy issued by appellant to the City and County of San Francisco, appel-lee\u2019s employer. Appellant\u2019s principal defense is that appellee was not a \u201cfull-time employee\u201d on the date of his injury and thus was not covered by the policy. The trial judge found that the injury was accidental, that Simpson was an employee, under the terms of the policy, on the date of the accident and entitled to judgment. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b1106-28\">Inasmuch as the phrase \u201cfull-time employee\u201d is not defined in the policy, any ambiguity arising from failure to define must be resolved against appellant. General Cas. Co. of America v. Azteca Films, Inc., 278 F.2d 161 (9th Cir. 1960), <em>cert. denied, </em>364 U.S. 863, 81 S.Ct. 103, 5 L.Ed.2d 85; Allstate Ins. Co. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1043\">*1043</page-number>v. Erickson, 227 F.2d 755 (9th Cir. 1955). If doubt exists as to the person or persons protected, the language of the policy must be construed in the inclusive sense for the benefit of insured. Ohio Cas. Ins. Co. v. Armendariz, 224 Cal.App.2d 56, 36 Cal.Rptr. 274 (4th Dist.Ct.App.1964); Safeco Ins. Co. of America v. Hartford Fire Ins. Co., 238 Cal.App.2d 77, 47 Cal.Rptr. 550 (1st Dist.Ct.App.1965). An issue of fact, as to coverage under the policy, was presented to the trial judge, and by him resolved against the appellant. The findings of the trial judge are supported by substantial evidence and are not clearly erroneous.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
