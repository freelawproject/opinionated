Stout v. Broom, 5 Cir., 1969, 406 F.2d 758.</p>\n<p id=\"b1112-26\">Appellant filed a complaint asking the district court to nullify his dishonorable discharge from the armed forces on grounds that he was denied his \u201cconstitutional rights\u201d of indictment by a grand jury and a trial by a petit jury. Upon motion of the United States, the complaint was dismissed. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b1112-27\">Appellant has failed to allege exhaustion of the administrative remedies afforded under the provisions of 10 U.S.C. \u00a7 1552. To consider his claims before he has exhausted those remedies <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1049\">*1049</page-number>would be premature. Beard v. Stahr, 1962, 370 U.S. 41, 82 S.Ct. 1105, 8 L.Ed.2d 321; Tuggle v. Brown, 5 Cir., 1966, 362 F.2d 801, cert. denied 385 U.S. 941, 87 S.Ct. 311, 17 L.Ed.2d 220 (1966); McCurdy v. Zuckert, 5 Cir., 1966, 359 F.2d 491.</p>\n<p id=\"b1113-9\"> However, even if appellant had exhausted such remedies, he would not be entitled to relief. While the fifth amendment guarantees the right to indictment by grand jury, it also states an exception for cases arising in the armed forces. Ex parte Quirin, 1942, 317 U.S. 1, 63 S. Ct. 1, 87 L.Ed. 3; Owens v. Markley, 7 Cir., 1961, 289 F.2d 751.</p>\n<p id=\"b1113-10\">Similarly, the guarantee of the right to trial by jury has been held inapplicable to court-martial proceedings. Whelchel v. McDonald, 1950, 340 U.S. 122, 71 S.Ct. 146, 95 L.Ed. 141, rehearing denied 340 U.S. 923, 71 S.Ct. 356, 95 L.Ed. 666; Ex parte Quirin, supra.</p>\n<p id=\"AYY\">Affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
