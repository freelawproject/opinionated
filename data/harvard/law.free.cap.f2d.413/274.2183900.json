He was indicted for knowingly failing to perform a duty in violation of Section 12(a) of the Universal Military Training and Service Act (Act), 62 Stat. 622 (1948), 50 U.S.C. App. \u00a7 462(a) (1964). Following a non-jury trial he was convicted and given a three year sentence under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 4208(a) (2) (1964). This appeal followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b339-7\">Shoemaker argues that he should have been acquitted because he presented a prima facie case for a IY-D ministerial classification and he asserts that no evidence whatsoever appears to rebut the claim. Under a IV-D classification a registrant, as in the case of a I-O classification, is exempt from induction. But one classified IV-D, unlike a I-O registrant, is not subject to a board order requiring him to engage in selected civilian employment for any period of time. See section 6(g) of the Act, 62 Stat. 611, 50 U.S.C. App. \u00a7 456(g) (1964); Daniels v. United States, 9 Cir., 372 F.2d 407, 409, note 2.</p>\n<p id=\"b339-8\">Shoemaker did not defend in the trial court on the ground that he was entitled to a IV-D classification. In the absence of plain error, points not raised in the trial court will not be considered on appeal. Yeater v. United States, 9 Cir., 397 F.2d 975.</p>\n<p id=\"b339-9\">In our opinion there was neither plain error within the meaning of Rule 52(b), Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure, nor was there error of any kind with respect to this IV-D contention.</p>\n<p id=\"b339-10\">Examination of Shoemaker\u2019s selective service file establishes that he requested a I-O classification, and that is what he received. He did not seek a IV-D classification, indicating at most that he hoped to qualify for such a classification at a later time. He was advised by the local board, in effect, that if and when he expanded his ministerial activity to such an extent that he was entitled to a IV-D classification, he should present evidence thereof to the board. Shoemaker submitted no additional evidence of this kind and did not, formally or informally, request a reopening of his classification after the appeal board classified him I-O.</p>\n<p id=\"b339-15\">Apart from Shoemaker\u2019s failure to seek a IV-D classification from the agency, there is, in any event, a basis in fact for his I-O classification as distinguished from a IV-D classification.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Shoemaker would not have been entitled to a IV-D classification unless the ministry was his vocation. See Langhorne v. United States, 9 Cir., 394 F.2d 129. Shoemaker did not assert that he worked more than about ten hours a week in furtherance of his ministerial duties. He therefore failed to establish that the ministry was his vocation. See Daniels v. United States, 9 Cir., 404 F.2d 1049,' 1050-1051.</p>\n<p id=\"b339-16\">Shoemaker also contends that he should have been acquitted because, when he was ordered to perform civilian work, he was not given or offered a final physical inspection.</p>\n<p id=\"b339-17\">Shoemaker did take the regular pre-induction physical examination required of all registrants, and was found physically acceptable. Selective service regulations do not require that registrants classified I-O, as distinguished from registrants classified I-A or I-A-O, be subject to a final physical inspection before being ordered to report for civilian work. Briggs v. United States, 9 Cir., 397 F.2d 370, relied upon by Shoemaker on this branch of the case, pertains to I-A registrants, and is therefore distinguishable.</p>\n<p id=\"b339-18\">The regulations require fair and equal treatment of all those subject to the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"276\">*276</page-number>Act. See section 1(c) of the Act, 62 Stat. 605 (1948), 50 U.S.C. App. \u00a7 451(c) (1964), and 32 C.F.R. \u00a7 1622.1. . But there is a rational basis for exempting those classified 1-0 from the provision for a final physical inspection. Unlike those classified I-A and I-A-O, there is no possibility that registrants classified 1-0 will be subject to the rigors of military life in a combat zone. In view of this rational basis for exempting 1-0 registrants from final physical inspections, it cannot be said that Shoemaker was not accorded fair and equal treatment.</p>\n<p id=\"b340-4\">Affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b339-11\">. A selective service classification may not be overturned for lack of evidentiary support if there is a basis in fact for the classification. Witmer v. United States, 348 U.S. 375, 381, 383, 75 S.Ct. 392, 99 L.Ed. 428.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
