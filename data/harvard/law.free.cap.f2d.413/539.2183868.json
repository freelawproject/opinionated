The trial court held the exclusion was invalid. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b603-27\">The facts are undisputed. The plaintiff was involved in an accident in which an automobile driven by him and a vehicle owned by the City of North Little <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"540\">*540</page-number>Rock, driven by Joseph Roberts, an employee of the City, collided. The plaintiff instituted a suit against Roberts and recovered a judgment of $8,000. Since neither the City of North Little Rock<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> nor Roberts<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> had insurance covering the vehicle, the plaintiff instituted a suit against the defendant, State Farm Fire and Casualty Company, under the terms of a State Farm policy held by him. The plaintiff\u2019s vehicle was covered by a liability insurance policy containing the following provision:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b604-4\">\u201cCOVERAGE <em>U </em>\u2014 Damages <em>for bodily injury caused by uninsured automobiles. </em>To pay all sums which the insured or his legal representative shall be legally entitled to recover as damages from the owner or operator of an uninsured automobile because of bodily injury sustained by the insured, caused by accident and arising out of the ownership, maintenance, or use of such uninsured automobile; * *</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b604-5\">The defendant denies liability on the grounds that the policy excluded vehicles owned by municipalities from the term \u201cuninsured automobiles.\u201d The provision relied upon reads:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b604-10\">\u201c(2) * * * [B]ut the term \u2018uninsured automobile\u2019 shall not include: * * * (iv) a land motor vehicle which is owned by the United States of America, Canada, a state, a political subdivision of any such government or an agency of any of the foregoing:. * .*</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b604-12\">It is undisputed that if this provision is valid, it would cover the vehicle owned by the City of North Little Rock and, therefore, relieve the defendant of liability.</p>\n<p id=\"b604-13\">The District Court noted that the Arkansas Supreme Court had not resolved the question. It held that the policy provision was contrary to the public policy of the State of Arkansas as set forth in \u00a7 66-4003, Ark.Stat.Ann. (1947),<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> and, therefore, was invalid. It [case reported sub nom. Carter v. Saint Paul Fire and Marine Insurance Com<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"541\">*541</page-number>pany, 283 F.Supp. 384, 388, 390 (1968)] stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b605-5\">\u201cThe Arkansas statute requires coverage \u2018for the protection of persons insured thereunder who are legally entitled to recover damages from owners or operators of uninsured motor vehicles. * * * \u2019 Under existing Arkansas law it is true that the plaintiff had no cause of action against the City of North Little Rock, the owner of the vehicle, but the plaintiff did have a cause of action against the operator of the uninsured vehicle, Joseph Roberts. To give effect to the exclusion in the policy would deprive plaintiff of the benefit of the statute, although the collision was with one who is legally liable, and one who was driving an uninsured vehicle at the time of the accident.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b605-7\">\u201cThe obvious intent of the Legislature in enacting the Uninsured Motorist Act was to provide insurance to policyholders such as plaintiff Vaught against inadequate compensation for injuries in a collision with uninsured motorists\u2019 vehicles at least to the extent provided by the statute. ******</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b605-8\">\u00ab* * * [This provision] * * * [is] held to be valid the purpose of the Arkansas statute, which is to provide a basic minimum coverage against the actions of financially irresponsible motorists, would be frustrated. This basic coverage may not be abrogated nor diminished by the \u2018small print\u2019 in an insurance contract.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b605-9\">Although the exclusion appears to be a standard one,<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> only one case has been called to our attention in which consideration was given to the question of whether the exclusionary clause can be given effect on the face of a statute similar to that enacted by the Arkansas legislature. Jones v. Southern Farm Bureau Casualty Company, 163 S.E.2d 306 (S.C.1968). The South Carolina Supreme Court decided that the exclusion was a valid one. It did so on the narrow grounds that the Act specifically permitted the exclusion. It reasoned that the Uninsured Motorist Act had been codified into Chapter 8 of the South Carolina Code (the Motor Vehicle Safety Responsibility Act), and became a part thereof. That chapter included the following section:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b605-11\">\u201cThis chapter shall not apply with respect to any motor vehicle owned by the United States, this State or any political subdivision of this State or any municipality therein.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b605-12\">The court held that the quoted section was applicable to all of the provisions of the chapter, including those dealing with uninsured motorists.</p>\n<p id=\"b605-13\">We do not have the same circumstances here. The Uninsured Motorist Act and the Motor Vehicle Safety Responsibility Act are not codified in one chapter in the Arkansas statutes. The Uninsured Motorist Act does not specifically exclude governmentallyowned vehicles. The appellant argues, however, that because the Uninsured Motorist Act refers to the Motor Vehicle Safety Responsibility Act for the purposes of prescribing the limits of coverage, it is fair to look to the latter Act to determine legislative intent as to exclusions. Since that Act contains an exclusion for vehicles owned by the government, \u00a7 75-1426 (h), Ark.Stat.Ann. (1947), the appellant argues that a similar exclusion should be read into the Uninsured Motorist Act.</p>\n<p id=\"b605-14\">The short answer to this contention is that if the legislature had so intended, it could have been as explicit with respect to the one as it was with the other.</p>\n<p id=\"b605-15\">The defendant argues that the Uninsured Motorist Act deals with the problem of insurer\u2019s insolvency in two provisions, \u00a7\u00a7 66-4004 and 66-4005, Ark. Stat.Ann. (1947), and finds it incongruous that the legislature would expressly deal with this contingency and yet would <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"542\">*542</page-number>not be deemed to have dealt with the problem of governmental immunity and uninsured motorist coverage. We find no such incongruity. On the contrary, the legislature\u2019s inclusion of the provisions covering insolvent insurers indicates, if anything, an intent to give broad coverage to the statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b606-4\">The defendant next contends that a defendant insurance company\u2019s right to subrogation is defeated if the exclusionary clause is invalidated. This argument is without merit. The defendant may be precluded from seeking recovery against the owner of the vehicle, City of North Little Rock, but nothing prevents it from seeking recovery from the vehicle\u2019s operator. The defendant would have the same rights against the operator as its insured had. <em>Cf., </em>King v. State Farm Mutual Insurance Company, 274 F.Supp. 824 (W.D.Ark.1967).</p>\n<p id=\"b606-5\">The defendant\u2019s final contention is that the Arkansas Supreme Court has recognized the right of an insurer to narrow the scope of the uninsured motorist statute.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> *It cites M.F.A. Mutual Ins. Co. v. Bradshaw, 245 Ark. 85, 431 S.W.2d 252 (1968), and M.F.A. Mutual Ins. Co. v. Wallace, 245 Ark. 227, 431 S.W.2d 742 (1968), in support of its view.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b606-16\">In <em>Bradshaw, </em>the court held that a clause requiring that the consent of the company to an action against the uninsured must be obtained before a judgment was conclusive against the company. was. valid. Compare, M.F.A. Mutual Ins. Co. v. Lovins, 248 F.Supp. 108 (E.D.Ark.1965), cited with approval by the Arkansas Supreme Court in M.F.A. Mutual Ins. Co. v. Bradshaw, <em>supra </em>431 S.W.2d at 254.</p>\n<p id=\"b606-18\">In <em>Wallace, </em>the Arkansas Supreme Court held than an \u201cother insurance clause\u201d prohibiting \u201cstacking\u201d was valid.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b606-19\">In our view, neither ease indicates that the Arkansas Supreme Court would permit an insurer to defeat the basic purpose of the Uninsured Motorist Statute; <em>i. e., </em>to \u201cenable Arkansas <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"543\">*543</page-number>people purchasing automobile insurance to obtain for an additional premium the same protection against death or injuries at the hands of an uninsured motorist as they would have had if that motorist had obtained for himself the minimum insurance coverage required by the Safety Responsibility Act.\u201d Childers v. Southern Farm Bureau Casualty Insurance Co., 282 F.Supp. 866 (E.D.Ark. 1968), vacated for other reasons memorandum decision LR 66 0-259 . (Sept. 18, 1968). See also, 22 Ark.L.Rev. 152 (1968); 20 Ark.L.Rev. 370 (1966); 19 Ark.L.Rev. 377 (1965); 15 Ark.L.Rev. 219 (1960); and Annot. 79 A.L.R.2d 1252 (1961), for a discussion of uninsured motorist coverage.</p>\n<p id=\"b607-4\">We are convinced that if the Arkansas Supreme Court were faced with the question raised here that its opinion would be the same as that of the District Court. We, therefore, affirm.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b604-6\">. At the time of the accident, Arkansas adhered to the position that a municipality, when acting in its governmental capacity, was not liable in damages for injuries inflicted on others by the negligent acts of its employees, servants and officers. The Arkansas Supreme Court subsequently abandoned this position in Parish v. Pitts, 244 Ark. 1239, 429 S.W.2d 45 (1968). Prior to this decision, the legislature, in an effort to mitigate the hardship imposed by the doctrine of governmental immunity, authorized municipalities to buy liability insurance and for direct actions against the insurers. See, \u00a7 66-3240, Ark.Stat.Ann. (1947). The City of North Little Rock had not purchased liability insurance. The Arkansas legislature has recently reinstated the doctrine of governmental immunity, but now requires municipalities to carry liability insurance.
