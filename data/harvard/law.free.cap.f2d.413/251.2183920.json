After entry of the revocation order appellant was sentenced to imprisonment for a term of one year. He now contends that the court abused its discretion in revoking probation and lacked jurisdiction to impose sentence. Neither contention has merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b316-12\">On April 5, 1967, after entry of a plea of nolo contendere, a judgment of conviction was entered against appellant for the offense of accepting wagers without paying the special occupational tax required by 26 U.S.C. \u00a7 4411 in violation of 26 U.S.C. \u00a7 7203. He was fined $2,-500, imposition of sentence was reserved by the court, and appellant was placed on probation for a period of two years. No appeal was taken from the judgment. On October 21,1968, following a full evi-dentiary hearing, the court found that appellant had violated the conditions of his probation and entered the subject order of revocation followed by the imposition of sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b316-17\">Courts have long noted that revocation of probation is a power that \u201cimplies conscientious judgment, not arbitrary action\u201d<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> but that \u201call that is required is evidence and facts which reasonably satisfy the judge that the probationer\u2019s conduct has not been as good as that required by the conditions of probation.\u201d <footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The evidence in the case at bar established that during a search of appellant\u2019s home on October 4, 1968, local police officers had found booking sheets and marked football schedules showing the point spread applicable for betting, two separate telephone lines, and the presence of appellant\u2019s brother, Mickey Rodgers, a known gambler, who was observed by the officers to flush torn bits of paper down the commode. Although appellant admitted that the records found in his home (under the cushions of the sofa) were gambling records he testified that the records had been in that unusual spot for over a year and a half; that the extra telephone was for the benefit of his wife\u2019s teen-age brother and sisters who lived a block away; that, although he knew his brother was running an active book, his presence in the house was simply that of a visitor. The trial court rejected appellant\u2019s account as not credible. The record clearly supports the trial court\u2019s action as one of \u201cconscientious judgment\u201d and has no aspect of arbitrariness.</p>\n<p id=\"b316-19\">Appellant\u2019s attack upon the jurisdiction of the court to revoke probation and then proceed to imposition of sentence springs from the decisions in Marchetti v. United States, 390 U.S. 39, 88 S.Ct. 697, 19 L.Ed.2d 889, and Grosso v. United States, 390 U.S. 62, 88 S.Ct. 709, 19 L.Ed.2d 906, and is premised on <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"253\">*253</page-number>the conclusion that the cited decisions render appellant\u2019s original judgment of conviction invalid. The question of the validity of the original judgment cannot be raised for the first time on appeal from an order revoking probation. Yates v. United States, 10 Cir., 308 F.2d 737. Accordingly, we indicate no opinion as to the merits of this contention and hold only that the issue is beyond the scope of our present review.</p>\n<p id=\"b317-5\">Affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b316-13\">.
