Davis, a fully insured deceased wage earner. The district court granted the Secretary\u2019s motion for summary judgment on the grounds that Donna was not the \u201cchild\u201d of an insured individual as that term is defined by the Social Security Act. This appeal ensued.</p>\n<p id=\"b332-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"268\">*268</page-number>The parties agree that if Donna qualifies as a \u201cchild\u201d under the Act, she does so only by virtue of Section 216(h) (3), 42 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 416(h) (3), which provides in pertinent part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b332-4\">\u201c(h) * * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b332-5\">\u201c(3) An applicant who is the son or daughter of a fully or currently insured individual, but who is not (and is not deemed to be) the child of such insured individual under paragraph (2) of this subsection, shall nevertheless be deemed to be the child of such insured individual if:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b332-6\">******</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b332-7\">\u201c(C) in the ease of a deceased individual</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b332-8\">******</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b332-9\">\u201c(ii) such insured individual is shown by evidence satisfactory to the Secretary to have been the father of the applicant, and such insured individual was living with or contributing to the support of the applicant at the time such insured individual died.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b332-10\">The biological paternity of the claimant has been satisfactorily established. It has been established to the Hearing Examiner\u2019s satisfaction and to our satisfaction that Davis, the wage earner, was living with Carolyn Wagner at the time of his death. The mother of the wage earner reported that wage earner told her that he and the mother of Donna were living together. Appellant\u2019s mother reported that appellant and the wage earner were living together. These people were in a low income group, and because of distance and lack of money, theirs was not a day-by-day relationship. Substance, not form, must govern. Medically speaking, Donna was viable from the instant of conception onward. An action for damages could have been brought in her behalf for injuries she might have received prior to birth. When the deceased wage earner came over for his weekend visits he was in fact living with both child and mother. We would strain ordinary meaning to require that all the proper prerequisites to maintaining a home are the sine qua non to entitlement under the Act. We find nothing in the legislative history to assist with the definitions of the phrases \u201cliving with\u201d and \u201ccontributing to.\u201d Apparently, Congress did not discuss or contemplate any dollar amount of support or minutes, hours, days or years of \u201cliving with\u201d in order to qualify, once the fact of parenthood was established. To the extent possible, Donna has met all the requirements. Insofar as she was capable of dependency on the wage earner, she was dependent on him on the date of his death. Within less than a month she would have met every possible requirement of the statute. Had her father not been killed shortly after she was conceived and two weeks before his planned marriage to her mother, there would be no question of the child-claimant\u2019s right to benefits.</p>\n<p id=\"b332-12\">The crucial issue remaining is whether or not this child, conceived outside of marriage and born after her father\u2019s death, may nevertheless be deemed to be her father\u2019s child under 42 U.S.C.A. 416(h) (3) of the Act. Counsel for appellant, seeking an affirmative answer to this query, relies on a ruling of the Social Security Administration made on March of 1968 and cited as SSR 68-22 wherein it was held that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b332-13\">\u201cWhere the deceased insured worker, at the time of his death, was living with and contributing to the support of the mother of his unborn illegitimate child, held, the worker\u2019s contributions to the support of the child\u2019s mother and his living with the mother constitute contributions to the support of, and living with, the unborn child within the meaning of section 216(h) (3) (C) (ii) of the Act, provided that the child was born alive.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b332-14\">A \u201cSocial Security Ruling\u201d which interprets the Act as applied to the facts in a particular case does not have the effect of law. However, in this instance where there is no case law which interprets the \u201cliving with\u201d provision of the statute, we agree that the illegitimate child of a deceased father, conceived before, but born after, the father\u2019s death, is sufficiently \u201cin being\u201d to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"269\">*269</page-number>be capable of \u201cliving with\u201d the father at the time of his death. The fact that a worker dies before the birth of a child already \u201cin being\u201d is no legal or equitable reason to prohibit that child from benefits.</p>\n<p id=\"b333-5\">We conclude that Donna, having met all the requirements, is deemed to be the child of the wage earner under Section 216(h) (3) (C) (ii) of the Act, and is entitled to a child\u2019s insurance benefits.</p>\n<p id=\"b333-6\">The judgment of the district court is reversed and the case remanded to the Secretary with instructions to grant the application for benefits to Donna.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
