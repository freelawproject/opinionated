On two prior occasions he was deported from the United States. He last entered the United States on February 20, 1967, as a transient without visa and was authorized to remain for four days. He did not depart within the allotted time and remained at large until his arrest on June 13,1968.</p>\n<p id=\"b752-7\">Petitioner was placed under arrest by two immigration officials at a bakery shop which he owned and operated in Jersey City, New Jersey, and was taken to the New York Office of the Immigration and Naturalization Service. The following day he was served with a warrant of arrest and an order to show cause alleging that he was deportable under Section 241(a) (2) of the Immigration and Naturalization Act, 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1251(a) (2).</p>\n<p id=\"b752-17\">A hearing was commenced on June 17, 1968, at which petitioner was represented by Lyle O\u2019Rourke, an experienced attorney,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> and was accompanied by a relative, who was also an attorney and who acted as interpreter. Petitioner\u2019s counsel contended that since petitioner was arrested in New Jersey, the case should be heard in Newark and requested a two day extension to \u201ccheck the file, consider the facts,\u201d and talk to his client.</p>\n<p id=\"b752-18\">The hearing resumed on June 20, 1968. Petitioner\u2019s counsel abandoned his contention that the hearing should be conducted in New Jersey.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> He conceded that the petitioner was deportable<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> and advised the special inquiry officer that petitioner was not requesting voluntary departure.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b752-19\">The special inquiry officer entered an order directing petitioner\u2019s deportation to Italy. Petitioner waived his right to appeal and was released upon posting a $3,500 appearance bond. He was granted the right to leave the United States <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"689\">*689</page-number>within 30 days and subsequently was granted a 30 day extension.</p>\n<p id=\"b753-4\">On August 19, 1968, through new counsel, petitioner moved to reopen the deportation proceedings and requested an opportunity to apply for the privilege of voluntary departure. Following a hearing on August 20 before a special inquiry officer, the motion was denied.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> This decision was affirmed by the Board of Immigration Appeals on September 3, 1968, and, upon reconsideration, again affirmed on October 17, 1968. Petition for review was filed November 1, 1968.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b753-5\">Legality of Arrest</p>\n<p id=\"b753-6\">8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1357(a) (2) provides, <em>inter alia, </em>that any officer or employee of the Immigration Service may arrest an alien without a warrant \u201cif he has reason to believe that the alien so arrested is in the United States in violation of any * * * law or regulation and is likely to escape before a warrant can be obtained for his arrest * * *.\u201d Petitioner was the owner and operator of a bakery in Jersey City. It would seem that a warrant might have been obtained for his arrest. On the other hand, petitioner had twice been deported and subsequent to re-entry in February, 1967, had absconded. From the record we cannot say that the officers did not have reason to believe that petitioner was likely to escape before a warrant could be obtained.</p>\n<p id=\"b753-16\">Certainly there was probable cause to place petitioner under arrest, and his deportability was conceded at the hearing. The Immigration Service did not rely upon any statements taken or evidence seized at the time of his arrest. Under these circumstances, even if the arrest without a warrant were illegal, this would not invalidate the subsequent deportation proceedings. As the Supreme Court said in Bilokumsky v. Tod, 1923, 263 U.S. 149, 158, 44 S.Ct. 54, 68 L.Ed. 221: \u201cIrregularities on the part of the government official prior to, or in connection with, the arrest would not necessarily invalidate later proceedings in all respects conformable to law.\u201d <footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b753-18\">Place of Hearing</p>\n<p id=\"b753-19\"> There is no clear mandate in either the statute or regulations as to where a hearing should be held.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> Here the hearing was held in New York City instead of Newark \u2014 a distance of 15 miles.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> Petitioner resided in Jersey City, where he was arrested. The place of hearing was easily accessible to him. He was represented by competent coun<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"690\">*690</page-number>sel. At the initial hearing he was accompanied by a relative who was also an attorney. Petitioner was able to post bond. When the hearing was resumed three days later, he waived any objection to the place of hearing. This is a matter of venue rather than jurisdiction, and plaintiff could properly waive any right to have the hearing in the district of his residence or place of arrest.</p>\n<p id=\"b754-4\">There is no showing that the immigration officials acted arbitrarily or capriciously in holding the hearing in New York City or that petitioner was in any way prejudiced or denied a fair hearing. His counsel expressly abandoned any objection to the place of hearing. Accordingly, there is no valid basis for plaintiff\u2019s contention that it was improper to hold the hearing in New York City. See United States ex rel. Vermiglio v. Butterfield, 6 Cir. 1955, 223 F.2d 804; United States ex rel. Mastoras v. McCandless, 3 Cir. 1932, 61 F.2d 366.</p>\n<p id=\"b754-5\">Refusal to Reopen Proceedings</p>\n<p id=\"b754-6\">We find no merit in petitioner\u2019s final contention that the hearing should have been reopened to permit him to attempt to establish eligibility for voluntary departure. His counsel specifically stated at the June 20 hearing that petitioner did not request voluntary departure.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b754-7\">8 C.F.R. \u00a7 242.22 provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b754-8\">\u201cA motion to reopen will not be granted unless the special inquiry officer is satisfied that evidence sought to be offered is material and was not available and could not have been discovered or presented at the hearing; nor will any motion to reopen for the purpose of providing the respondent with an opportunity to make an application under \u00a7 242.17<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> be granted if respondent\u2019s right to make such application was fully explained to him by the special inquiry officer and he was afforded an opportunity to do so at the hearing, unless circumstances have arisen thereafter on the basis of which the request is being made.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b754-14\">The special inquiry officer at the August 20 hearing found that petitioner had failed to submit any evidence which could not have been presented at the first hearing<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> and that there was \u201cnothing here to warrant * * * either the stay of deportation proceedings or the grant of the motion to reopen the cause.\u201d The Board of Immigration Appeals affirmed this decision and dismissed the appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b754-15\">The grant or denial of a motion to reopen a deportation proceeding is discretionary with the Board of Immigration Appeals. \u201cThe courts cannot review the exercise of such discretion; they can interfere only when there has been a clear abuse of discretion or a clear failure to exercise discretion.\u201d United States ex rel. Adel v. Shaughnessy, 2 Cir. 1950, 183 F.2d 371, 372. There was no abuse of discretion on the part of the Board in denying petitioner\u2019s motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b754-16\">The petition is denied.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b752-9\">.

The special inquiry officer in his oral decision of August 20, 1968, stated that Mr. O\u2019Rourke \u201cwas experienced in Immigration matters\u201d and appeared in \u201cnumerous causes in the New York Office.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b752-12\">. \u201cSpecial Inquiry Officer: \u2018Now, let me ask one question.

Petitioner\u2019s motion to reopen was made upon the same grounds asserted in his petition for review. Each contention was considered and expressly rejected by the special inquiry officer.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b753-10\">. Pursuant to stipulation of counsel, the time for filing the certified record of the administrative proceedings was extended to March 1, 1969, and the time for petitioner\u2019s brief to May 7, 1969. Respondent\u2019s brief was filed June 7, 1969. At oral argument petitioner\u2019s counsel was granted two days within which to serve and file a reply brief. Counsel\u2019s subsequent request for an additional 30 days and for reargument was denied. The issues are simple, and we see no reason to delay further the final determination of this case.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b753-11\">. See also Medeiros v.

Ordinarily the better procedure would be to hold the hearing in the district of the alien\u2019s residence or place of arrest.

For administrative purposes the Immigration and Naturalization Service has been divided into four regions and numerous districts. See 8 C.F.R. 100.4.
