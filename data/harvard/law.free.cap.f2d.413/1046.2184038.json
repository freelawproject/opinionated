Since this case is <em>pre-Escobedo, </em>pr <em>e-Miranda, </em>the strict rules of admissibility of confessions as laid down in those cases are not applicable. Johnson v. New Jersey, 1966, 384 U.S. 719, 86 S. Ct. 1772, 16 L.Ed.2d 882. The legality and admissibility of a pr <em>e-Escobedo, pre-Miranda </em>confession is determined by its voluntariness, not <em>per se </em>by whether defendant was advised of his right to remain silent or was denied counsel. However, in determining whether a confession was voluntary the failure to advise the accused of his privilege against self-incrimination or to allow him access to outside assistance is a factor to be taken into account. <em>See </em>Haynes v. State of Washington, 1963, 373 U.S. 503, 83 S.Ct. 1336, 10 L.Ed.2d 513; Spano v. New York, 1959, 360 U.S. 315, 79 S.Ct. 1202, 3 L.Ed.2d 1265.</p>\n<p id=\"b1110-25\">Appellant makes two arguments. The first is that, apart from the absence of counsel factor, his confession was involuntary. The District Judge after a full evidentiary hearing concluded that the confession was voluntary. Because this factual holding is not clearly erroneous, we reject appellant\u2019s first contention.</p>\n<p id=\"b1110-26\">Appellant\u2019s second contention is that because he had no counsel during the police interrogation, the confession <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1047\">*1047</page-number>was invalid. In <em>pre-Escobedo, pre-Mi-randa </em>cases this fact does not <em>per se </em>invalidate a conviction. As stated above, this is one of the substantive factors to be evaluated in determining voluntariness. The District Judge considered this fact in coming to his conclusion that the confession was voluntary.</p>\n<p id=\"b1111-5\">Appellant\u2019s third contention is that he would not have pleaded guilty had he not confessed, and since his confession was involuntary, his plea of guilty was involuntary. Since we uphold the District Judge\u2019s determination that the confession was voluntary, this ground fails as a basis for claiming that the guilty plea was involuntary.</p>\n<p id=\"b1111-6\">We reject as unfounded appellant\u2019s last contention that the evidentiary hearing in the District Court was not full arid fair.</p>\n<p id=\"b1111-7\">Affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1110-19\">. Pursuant to new Rule 18 of the Rules of this Court, we have concluded on the merits that this case is of such a character as not to justify oral argument and have directed the Clerk to place the case on the Summary Calendar and to notify the parties in writing. See Murphy v. Hou-ma Well Service, 5 Cir., 1969, 409 F.2d 804.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
