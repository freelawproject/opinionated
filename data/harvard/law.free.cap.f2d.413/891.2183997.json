On August 7, 1967, the grand jury returned an indictment charging the defendant and Schneider with violations of 26 U.S.C. \u00a7 4704(a), purchasing cocaine not in the original stamped package; 26 U.S.C. \u00a7 4705(a), selling cocaine without the requisite order form; and 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 174, receiving, concealing, and facilitating the transportation of illegally imported cocaine.</p>\n<p id=\"b956-18\">The district court for the District of Puerto Rico sitting without a jury convicted defendant on all three counts and sentenced him to five years imprisonment for each count, the terms to run concurrently. Defendant brings this appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b956-19\">Defendant argues that he is entitled to an acquittal on two of the three counts because the convictions under \u00a7 4704 (a) and \u00a7 4705(a) abridge his privilege against self-incrimination.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b956-20\">We begin by confronting defendant\u2019s challenge to 26 U.S.C. \u00a7 4704(a) which makes it a crime to purchase or sell narcotic drugs except in or from the original stamped package.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Defendant <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"893\">*893</page-number>concedes that on its face \u00a7 4704(a) punishes affirmative acts independent of incriminating disclosures, but he argues that self-incrimination is present because one can establish his innocence under \u00a7 4704(a) only if he has satisfied the registration and occupational tax provisions of 26 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 4721-22.</p>\n<p id=\"b957-5\">As support for his position, defendant relies on Haynes v. United States, 390 U.S. 85, 88 S.Ct. 722, 19 L.Ed.2d 923 (1968), where the Supreme Court held that a conviction for possession of an unregistered firearm was in essence a conviction for failure to register, and therefore, a conviction for failure to make an incriminating disclosure. We agree with defendant that consistent with the teaching of <em>Haynes </em>our initial task is to determine the \u201cperimeter of the offense\u201d made punishable by \u00a7 4704(a). Simply stated, our inquiry must be whether a conviction for violation of \u00a7 4704(a) is in fact a conviction for failure to register as required by 26 U.S.C. \u00a7 4722 and for failure to pay the occupational tax imposed by 26 U.S.C. \u00a7 4721. If the answer is in the affirmative, we must then determine whether compliance with \u00a7\u00a7 4721 and 4722 would involve substantial hazards of incrimination in violation of the Fifth Amendment.</p>\n<p id=\"b957-6\">Defendant\u2019s argument with respect to the registration requirement of \u00a7 4722 is not well taken. The Narcotics Act permits acquisition of narcotics only by special classes of persons and it is only as to those classes that the obligation to register is applicable.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Had defendant desired to register, he would not have been permitted to do so. <em>See, e. g., </em>Walker v. United States, 176 F.2d 796 (9th Cir. 1949); Kavanaugh v. Fowler, 146 F.2d 961 (6th Cir. 1945); Georgia Ass\u2019n of Osteopathic Physicians &amp; Surgeons v. Allen, 112 F.2d 52 (5th Cir. 1940); Gerardi v. United States, 24 F.2d 189 (1st Cir. 1928). We therefore fail to see how defendant could fear self-incrimination at the hands of a disclosure obligation which did not apply to him.</p>\n<p id=\"b957-13\">The question remains, however, as to whether a non-registrant is liable for the occupational tax imposed by \u00a7 4721. We think it clear that the defendant was not covered by the tax. Defendant was convicted of <em>purchasing </em>narcotics not in the original stamped package. 26 U.S.C. \u00a7 4721 does not impose a tax on purchases of narcotics; rather it reaches only dispensers of narcotics.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b957-14\">The present case is clearly distinguishable from Leary v. United States, 395 U.S. 6, 89 S.Ct. 1532, 23 L.Ed.2d 57 (May 19, 1969), because unlike the Narcotics Act, the Marijuana Act contemplated the acquisition of marijuana by non-registrants \u2014 albeit at a $100 per ounce tax rate rather than the $1 per ounce rate accorded registrants. By requiring non-registrants to pay a tax which would result in incrimination the Act established an impermissible indirect prohibition of the purchase of marijuana by unauthorized persons. The Narcotics Act, on the other hand, creates a permissible, direct, absolute prohibition on the acquisition of narcotic drugs by non-registrants such as defendant. The fact that compliance with \u00a7\u00a7 4721 and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"894\">*894</page-number>4722 is a defense to a \u00a7 4704(a) prosecution avails defendant nothing, for compliance with \u00a7\u00a7 4721 and 4722 simply was not possible for defendant. The conviction under \u00a7 4704(a) is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b958-4\">Defendant also challenges his conviction under \u00a7 4705(a) for selling cocaine in the absence of an order form.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark>\n<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> It is, of course, the purchaser and not the seller who must furnish the order form. If, however, an order form is presented by the buyer, the seller must note on the form the quantity of drugs furnished and the date of the transaction. 26 C.F.R. \u00a7 151.185. In addition, the seller must retain a copy of the form for two years for purposes of inspection by appropriate government officials, 26 U.S.C. \u00a7 4705(d) and (e), and a copy must be forwarded to the Federal District Narcotics Supervisor in the seller\u2019s district. 26 C.F.R. \u00a7 151.201.</p>\n<p id=\"b958-5\">It is these obligations concerning the order form which are alleged to violate the Fifth Amendment privilege against self-incrimination. But the seller\u2019s failure to comply with \u00a7 4705(a), i. e., requiring a written order from a buyer, could not result in his being punished for failure to record his own crime. <em>Cf. </em>Nigro v. United States, 276 U.S. 332, 48 S.Ct. 388, 72 L.Ed. 600 (1928). Even assuming that these other obligations pose substantial hazards of incrimination in prosecution under these other sections (a matter which we do not decide), the requirement that sales be made only pursuant to an order form executed by the buyer is not so indissolubly linked to these obligations as to be one of \u201cessentially inseparable elements of a single registration procedure.\u201d Marchetti v. United States, 390 U.S. 39, at 42-43, 88 S.Ct. 697, 19 L.Ed.2d 889.</p>\n<p id=\"b958-8\">For even if the seller cannot be forced to fill out the order form and retain it for inspection, \u00a7 4705(a) serves the valid purposes of insuring that sales are made only to authorized purchasers and of facilitating government supervision of legitimate narcotics traffic. <em>See </em>United States v. Minor, 398 F.2d 511 (2d Cir. 1968) , <em>cert. granted, </em>395 U.S. 932, 89 5. Ct. 2000, 23 L.Ed.2d. 447 (June 2, 1969) (No. 189). The functioning of the order form system is aided by detailed regulations (26 C.F.R. \u00a7 151.141-151.229). For example, 26 C.F.R.. \u00a7 151.146 requires that a purchaser furnish the government with his name, address, registry number, and class number. In addition, 26 C.F.R. \u00a7 151.201 requires the purchaser to retain a copy of the order form for two years for purposes of .inspection'.</p>\n<p id=\"b958-12\">In view of the valid purposes of the order form system which operate independently of the seller\u2019s obligations, we believe, that effect must be accorded Congress\u2019 intention that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b958-13\">\u201cIf any provision of this title [title 26], or the application thereof to any person or circumstances, is held invalid, the remainder of the title, and the application of such provision to other persons or circumstances, shall not be affected thereby.\u201d 26 U.S.C. \u00a7 7852(a).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b958-14\">We therefore affirm defendant\u2019s conviction under \u00a7 4705(a).</p>\n<p id=\"b958-15\">Finally, defendant argues that he is entitled to a new trial because of the prejudice arising from a statement of the United States Attorney.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> Bruton v. United States, 391 U.S. 123, 88 S.Ct. 1620, 20 L.Ed.2d 476 (1968), relied upon by defendant is clearly inapposite. <em>Bruton </em>involved a co-defendant\u2019s extra-ju-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"895\">*895</page-number>dieial confession reported by a government witness in the presence of the jury. Moreover, the confession directly implicated the defendant. Here Schneider\u2019s guilty plea implicated only himself. The evidence of defendant\u2019s implication stemmed from testimony at trial. Most importantly, there was no jury involved. We do not condone the conduct of the United States Attorney, but we do not see how defendant was prejudiced.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"An-\">Affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b956-11\">. Defendant does not challenge his conviction for violation of 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 174. However, in view of the Supreme Court\u2019s recent decision in Benton v. Maryland, 395 U.S. 784, 89 S.Ct. 2056, 23 L.Ed.2d 707 (June 23, 1969), we elect to consider the validity of the convictions under 26 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 4704(a) and 4705(a).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b956-23\">. Specifically, 26 U.S.C. \u00a7 4704(a) provides that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b956-25\">\u201cIt shall be unlawful for any person to purchase, sell, dispense, or distribute <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"893\">*893</page-number>narcotic drugs except in the original stamped package or from the original stamped package; and the absence of appropriate taxpaid stamps from narcotic drugs shall be prima facie evidence of a violation * *</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b957-8\">. 26 U.S.C. \u00a7 4722 requires that \u201cevery person who engages in any of the activities enumerated in section 4721 shall register\u201d. 26 U.S.C. \u00a7 4721 sets out the following classes as liable for the tax: (1) importers, manufacturers, or producers lawfully entitled to so act; (2) lawful wholesalers ; (3) lawful retailers; (4) physicians, don-fists, and other practitioners lawfully entitled to dispense drugs; (5) persons lawfully engaged in research, teaching or analysis ; and (6) persons dispensing preparations of limited narcotic content under \u00a7 4702(a).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b957-16\">. Indeed, it is arguable that \u00a7 4721 taxes only those lawfully engaged in the handling of narcotics. If such a construction of the statute is reasonable, and we think it is, defendant would not be liable for the tax even in the capacity of a seller. He would, of course, be liable for unlawful sale under \u00a7 4704(a).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b958-6\">. 26 U.S.C. \u00a7 4705(a) provides that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b958-7\">\u201cIt shall be unlawful for any person to sell, barter, exchange, or give away narcotic drugs except in pursuance of a written order of the person to whom such article is sold, bartered, exchanged, or given, on a form to be issued in blank for that purpose by the Secretary or his delegate.\u201d</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b958-16\">. The United States Attorney told the court that the defendant\u2019s co-participant in the sale, Carlos Schneider, had pleaded guilty. The statement was stricken in response to an objection by the defense, and the court stated that \u201cI have no idea that this plea of the other defendant will affect me in any way.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b959-28\">. A jury may have difficulty in disregarding extrajudicial statements implicating a defendant. We will not presume that a judge suffers from the same disability. Indeed, the presumption is to the contrary.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
