Appellee relies on the case of Glass v. Flowers, 149 So.2d 747 (La. App.1963), which they contend is on \u201call fours\u201d, both factually and legally, with the instant case.</p>\n<p id=\"A8\">The undisputed facts reveal: (1) the policy was issued to Wendelken, whose work was completed before January 25, 1963; (2) this litigation results from the death of Alex Latino, who is alleged to have died from injuries sustained in an accident on April 26, 1963; (3) as of April 26, 1963, Wendelken\u2019s policy with Hardware expressly excluded the products-completed hazard, which was defined to include operations whether or not goods or products were involved. The law of <em>Glass </em>is sound. Liability under the policy is a matter of contract upon which contract principles apply. The policy provisions excluding <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1044\">*1044</page-number>liability for damages occurring after an assured\u2019s activity has ceased are perfectly valid. The plain meaning of the language of the policy excludes coverage for occurrences taking place after operations of the assured had been completed. In any event, it is clear that it was not the intention of Wendelken to contract for, nor was it the intention of the insurer to provide, Completed Operations coverage, which would have been necessary to afford coverage here.</p>\n<p id=\"b1108-4\">The judgment of the district court is affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
