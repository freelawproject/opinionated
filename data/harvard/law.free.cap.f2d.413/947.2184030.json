We deny the petition and, in accordance with the Board\u2019s cross-petition, enforce the order.</p>\n<p id=\"b1012-7\">The question raised by the Company\u2019s petition to review is whether the Company\u2019s claim representatives supervised by a divisional claim superintendent form an appropriate unit so as to justify the Board\u2019s order that the Company bargain with the union representing the unit. Essentially the same question was raised earlier by the Company in this court in State Farm Mutual Auto Ins. Co. v. N.L.R.B., 411 F.2d 356 (7th Cir., March 26, 1969), referred to here as <em>State Farm I. </em>We shall herein refer to the case before us as <em>State Farm II.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1012-8\">In <em>State Farm I </em>the Company refused to bargain with the union<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> which had been certified as bargaining representative for the Company\u2019s claim representatives or adjusters working in New York City and in the lower part of Westchester County. In <em>State Farm II </em>now before us the ACA was certified as bargaining representative for the claim representatives in Nassau and Suffolk Counties, who had earlier rejected IWIU in the election.</p>\n<p id=\"b1012-9\">In <em>State Farm I </em>this court en banc held that the Board did not abuse its discretion in choosing the Company\u2019s claim representatives as an appropriate unit for bargaining. We granted enforcement of the summary judgment order of the Board that the Company bargain with IWIU. That decision virtually disposed of the question presented in <em>State Farm II </em>by the Company\u2019s main brief and the Board\u2019s brief, <em>i.e., </em>whether the unit chosen was appropriate. In the Company\u2019s reply brief filed April 14, 1969, however, reliance is placed on the recent Second Circuit case, Pepsi-Cola Buffalo Bottling Co. v. NLRB, 409 F.2d 676 (2d Cir. 1969), to set aside the Board\u2019s summary judgment before us, not on the ground that the unit is inappropriate, but on the ground that the Board failed to make its own determination that the unit is appropriate.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1012-14\">In essence, the Company\u2019s reply brief argues that when the hearing in <em>State Farm II </em>was held, it was able \u201cfor the first time\u201d to prove that the unit determination in <em>State Farm I </em>\u201cmust inevitably\u201d lead to labor strife. The reason \u2014as stated in the Company\u2019s main brief \u2014is that the unit chosen by the Board is \u201cunstable and subversive of efficient collective bargaining and harmonious labor relations.\u201d The Company argues that since the Board itself has not considered these \u201cnew facts\u201d on their merits, its order should be set aside under the <em>Pepsi-Cola </em>decision. In view of our decision in <em>State Farm </em>/, we limited oral argument in <em>State Farm II </em>to the issue whether the <em>Pepsi-Cola </em>decision should govern this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b1012-15\">The \u201cnew facts\u201d are: The Company in 1967 \u2014 after the Board\u2019s decision in <em>State Farm </em>I \u2014 added a \u201cfifth divisional claim superintendent\u201d responsible for three \u201cclaim representatives\u201d in New York City and two in Nassau and Suffolk Counties. The result is that three claim representatives in New York City <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"949\">*949</page-number>are members of IWIU and two in Nassau and Suffolk Counties are members of ACA. And the Company now faces different bargaining agreements of rival unions representing members doing the same work under a single supervisor.</p>\n<p id=\"b1013-5\"><em>Pepsi-Cola </em>is distinguishable from <em>State Farm, II. </em>In <em>Pepsi-Cola </em>the court held that the Board failed to perform its statutory function of independently determining .the \u201ccrucial issue\u201d \u2014 whether Pepsi-Cola\u2019s distributors were employees. Instead, the Board, having denied petition to review the Regional Director\u2019s determination, thereby affirmed it and incorporated that determination into its order. Here the Board has reviewed the record.</p>\n<p id=\"b1013-6\">In <em>State Farm I </em>the Regional Director had determined that the Company\u2019s claim representatives constituted an appropriate unit. In the unfair labor practice proceeding the Company sought to have the Board transfer the cause to a trial examiner for further hearing on the issue of appropriateness of the unit. The Board refused on two grounds: since the evidence was merely cumulative, the issue \u201cneed not be relitigated\u201d; and since the evidence to be offered at the \u201cfurther hearing\u201d was available at the time of the representative hearing, the Company had the duty to produce the evidence there. This court\u2019s opinion, filed March 26, 1969, found no abuse of the Board\u2019s discretion in the Board\u2019s ruling. <em>State Farm I, </em>411 F.2d 356.</p>\n<p id=\"b1013-7\">Meanwhile, ACA filed its representation petition May 8, 1967, to begin this, the <em>State Farm II </em>proceeding. A hearing was held on the same issue that was heard at the corresponding hearing in <em>State Farm I. </em>The record in <em>State Farm I </em>was introduced before the hearing officer and the additional evidence \u2014 for which the Company sought the \u201cfurther hearing\u201d in <em>State Farm </em>I \u2014 was introduced. This included the history since 1958 up to late 1967 of the Company organization in creating additional divisional claim superintendents and reassigning existing ones. The Company urged on this evidence that the claim representatives unit chosen by the Board in <em>State Farm I </em>was subject to \u201cconstant and frequent change\u201d with representatives in and out of the unit and no \u201cstability of collective bargaining.\u201d The Regional Director, on the record of <em>State Farm I </em>and the additional evidence, determined the claim representatives formed an appropriate unit. The union\u2019s certification, the Company\u2019s refusal to bargain, and the unfair labor practice proceeding in <em>State Farm II </em>followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b1013-9\">In its answer to the General Counsel\u2019s complaint the Company stated the unit was \u201carbitrary,\u201d bore no relationship to the Company operating structure, unreasonably divided a \u201chomogenous group of employees\u201d and would result in \u201cchaos and labor unrest.\u201d The General Counsel moved for summary judgment, pointing out that the Company\u2019s answer did not assert newly discovered evidence or its unavailability at the representative hearing in <em>State Farm II. </em>The Company\u2019s response to the motion set out, in substance, the additional facts testified to at the hearing, and stated that if the Board would reconsider its decision denying petition to review, the Company would show that the superintendent added in 1967 was supervising the claim representatives \u201cin the same \u2018unit,\u2019 doing the same work, but * * * represented by two * * * unions.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1013-10\">The Board ordered the proceeding before the Regional Director transferred to itself. In its Decision and Order \u201cupon the entire record in this case,\u201d the Board granted summary judgment on the General Counsel\u2019s motion. It reviewed the substance of the entire proceeding, including the contentions asserted by the Company in its opposition to the summary judgment motion. These were the asserted changes in the Company structure, and the chaos, etc., due to result from the arbitrary unit chosen. The Board noted it had considered the same contentions previously and found the General Counsel\u2019s allegations supported by the record or admitted. The Board then found, <em>inter alia, </em>that the claim rep<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"950\">*950</page-number>resentatives constituted an appropriate unit.</p>\n<p id=\"b1014-4\">The uncontroverted \u201cnew facts\u201d were before the Board when it ruled on the summary judgment motion. There was no genuine issue of material fact raised by the motion and \u201copposition.\u201d The Board itself determined the \u201ccrucial issue.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1014-5\">We conclude therefore that the decision in Pepsi-Cola Buffalo Bottling Co. v. NLRB, 409 F.2d 676 (2d Cir. 1969), does not govern <em>State Farm II.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1014-6\">The order will be enforced.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1012-11\">.
