His prayer was grounded on the assertion that the conviction was based on an involuntary confession. The writ was denied. We affirm, on the opinion of the District Court.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b504-7\">There Chief Judge Thomsen with caution and clarity recounts the crime and the circumstances of the confession. He squarely meets and soundly resolves the imputations of invalidity arising from an alleged coercively-protracted detention following a concededly illegal arrest. He found Mefford\u2019s spoken and written admissions of guilt and the manner of the felony\u2019s commission wholly free of pressure, overbearing of will, or inducement of any kind. The judge\u2019s recital of the facts he finds altogether warrants his conclusion.</p>\n<p id=\"b504-8\">Upholding the judgment against Mef-ford, the Maryland Court of Appeals declared inapplicable to State prosecutions the pronouncement upon confessions of the Supreme Court in Wong Sun v. United States, 371 U.S. 471, 83 S.Ct. 407, 9 L.Ed.2d 441 (1963). The District Court did not make this distinction, nor do we, for nothing is seen in <em>Wong Sun </em>to call for disturbance of the decision here. Cf. United States v. Close, 349 F.2d 841 (4 Cir. 1965).</p>\n<p id=\"b504-9\">The order on review is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b504-10\">Affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b504-11\">. Mefford v.
