The government\u2019s determination is presumptively correct, and it is the taxpayer\u2019s burden to demonstrate its incorrectness. Fulton Container Co. v. United States, 355 F.2d 319, 324 (9th Cir. 1966). We cannot say that the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1042\">*1042</page-number>findings of the trial court were clearly erroneous.</p>\n<p id=\"b1106-4\">The fifth specification, abuse of discretion in refusing to grant appellant\u2019s motion for a new trial, is also without merit. Neither the court nor the government misled appellant. Appellant alone bears the responsibility for the choice of evidence it presented at trial, and it is not entitled to guidance from the court or government on how to conduct a legal proceeding.</p>\n<p id=\"b1106-5\">Affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
