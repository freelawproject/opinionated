No direct appeal was taken although a petition under Pennsylvania\u2019s Post Conviction Hearing Act, 19 P.S. \u00a7 1180-1 et seq., was filed in the sentencing court within a month of the sentencing. The court denied relief and was affirmed by the state Superior Court in Commonwealth ex rel. Fletcher v. Maroney, 210 Pa.Super. 96, 232 A.2d 206, 207 (1967).</p>\n<p id=\"b79-27\">Following denial of an application for allocatur to the Pennsylvania Supreme Court on November 6, 1967, a petition for federal habeas corpus relief was filed in the district court.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> The petition alleged various grounds for relief, prominent among which was an allegation that the petitioner had been \u201ctricked into pleading guilty.\u201d In addition, the petition included numerous affidavits from persons whom the petitioner claimed could fully establish his inno-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"16\">*16</page-number>cenee of the charge of receiving stolen goods.</p>\n<p id=\"pAl\">Based on a review of the record of the state proceedings, the district judge concluded that the guilty plea had been \u201cknowingly and intelligently entered,\u201d<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> and viewed the submitted affidavits as \u201cineffective in the face of his voluntary pleas of guilty.\u201d Moreover, the court noted that this matter had not been presented to the state courts and could not therefore be given consideration by the federal forum. Consequently, the court denied relief.</p>\n<p id=\"b80-5\">Unsatisfied and undaunted by this adjudication, the appellant filed a second petition before the same court.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> This time, however, in addition to the allegations previously made, he charged that he had not been afforded the assistance of counsel in presenting his post-conviction state petitions. Reiterating the rulings it had made on the prior petition and noting that the allegation of the denial of counsel had never been presented to the state courts, the district court again denied relief. This appeal followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b80-6\">We have painstakingly examined the present record and can find nothing which indicates that the actions of the district court were improper. The appellant\u2019s contention that he was denied the assistance of counsel on his post-conviction attempts to obtain relief in the state courts must be presented to those courts for initial adjudication. In this respect, we note that the appellant has in fact returned to the state courts for an adjudication of this and other matters.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b80-7\">Accordingly, the judgment of the district court will be affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b79-16\">.
