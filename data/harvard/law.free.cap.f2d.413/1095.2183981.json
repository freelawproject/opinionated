Although the Government\u2019s case consisted largely of evidence of circumstances, it is clear that reasonable jurors could have fairly concluded Appellant\u2019s guilt beyond a reasonable doubt.</p>\n<p id=\"b1160-22\">Objection was made to the closing argument of the prosecutor which stated \u201cHe waited for her there with his gun, and shot her, stabbed her and kicked her \u2014 shot her down just like a dog.\u201d Viewing the record as a whole, as we must, we are unable to conclude these remarks warrant reversal. The test of reversal is not the only test of appropriate conduct. The prosecutor may \u201cstrike hard blows,\u201d but not \u201cfoul.\u201d Berger v. United States, 295 U.S. 78, 88, 55 S.Ct. 629, 79 L.Ed. 1314 (1934). We need not characterize the prosecution argument here as foul to conclude that the prosecution has an obligation to set an example of professional conduct. The Government may prosecute vigorously, zealously with hard blows if the facts warrant, for a criminal trial is not a minuet. Nevertheless, there are standards which a Government counsel should meet to uphold the dignity of the Government. The language of the prosecutor here was hardly in keeping with what the Courts and the public expect of its representatives. We take this occasion to remind the bar, prosecutors and defense counsel alike, that we expect \u2014 indeed insist \u2014 that their conduct reflect that they are officers of the court as well as advocates for a cause.</p>\n<p id=\"b1160-23\">Perhaps under the pressures of inordinately heavy criminal calendars which place all the participants under strain we have all become too tolerant of violations of canons and customs; hence our observations are not intended to condemn but to guide future conduct.</p>\n<p id=\"b1160-24\">Affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
