Insanity</p>\n<p id=\"b1292-14\">Davis\u2019 principal defense was a claim of insanity at the time of commission of the offense. The defendant introduced extensive testimony of lay witnesses and medical experts suggesting that he suffered from depressive paranoia with aggressive reactions and rejection of responsibility, as evidenced by his ambitious financial schemes, violent outbursts of temper, and history of past medical treatment. The government introduced no expert medical testimony. To refute Davis\u2019 claim of insanity it relied on the cross-examination of the defense witnesses and the rebuttal testimony of lay witnesses concerning Davis\u2019 actions at the time of the commission of the crime.</p>\n<p id=\"b1292-19\">The trial court gave instructions on the insanity defense comporting with its view of the then existing Fifth Circuit standards. Subsequent to the trial, and while the case was on appeal, this court adopted a new insanity definition in Blake v. United States, 5th Cir. 1969, 407 F.2d 908 [February 12, 1969] (en banc) and held that the Blake standards were to be applied to all cases then pending on appeal.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Since the trial court\u2019s instructions did not comport to <em>Blake, </em>Davis\u2019 conviction must be reversed. However, we cannot say that the record before us compels the entry of a judgment of acquittal. There was sufficient conflicting evidence concerning the relationship of Davis\u2019 mental defects to the commission of the crime to send the insanity issue to the jury. Under the circumstances of this case the government\u2019s failure to offer expert testimony did not warrant a directed verdict in favor of the defendant. See Bishop v. United States, 394 F.2d 500 (5th Cir. 1968); Brock v. United States, 387 F.2d 254 (5th Cir. 1967); Mims v. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1229\">*1229</page-number>United States, <em>supra. </em>Accordingly, we remand the ease for a new trial.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1293-5\">Davis has advanced several additional assignments of error. We deal with those likely to recur in a subsequent trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b1293-6\">2. Pre-trial medical examination</p>\n<p id=\"b1293-7\">Prior to trial the government moved under 18 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 4244 (1969) for a medical examination of Davis to determine his competency to stand trial. Davis did not object at that time to the nature or extent of the examination ordered by the court. However, he now contends that since the government was on notice that insanity at the time of the offense was to be one of the primary defenses at the trial, it was under an obligation to see that any pre-trial mental examination of him was broad enough to determine his mental responsibility at the time of the commission of the offense as well as his capacity to stand trial. We find this contention to be without merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b1293-8\">Section 4244 provides for a psychiatric examination to ascertain whether \u201ca person charged with an offense against the United States may be presently insane or otherwise so mentally incompetent as to be unable to understand the proceedings against him or properly to assist in his own defense.\u201d Courts have long recognized that \u201cthere is a vast difference between the mental state which permits an accused to be tried and that which permits him to be held responsible for a crime,\u201d and that the psychiatric examination necessary to determine competency to stand trial is far less extensive than the examination necessary to determine mental competency at the time of the commission of the offense. Winn v. United States, 106 U.S.App.D.C. 133, 270 F.2d 326, 328 (1959); see also Birdsell v. United States, 346 F.2d 775, 780 (5th Cir. 1965); Johnson v. United States, 344 F.2d 401 (5th Cir. 1965). We cannot infer from the language of \u00a7 4244 requiring an examination to determine competency to stand trial that the statute requires the court or the prosecution automatically to provide the more extensive examination necessary to determine mental capacity at the time of the commission of the offense.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1293-12\">3. Evidence of debt</p>\n<p id=\"b1293-13\">Davis\u2019 insanity defense was based on the theory that a psychotic condition was triggered by heavy debts and business failures shortly before he began trafficking in counterfeit currency. In order to present evidentiary \u201craw material\u201d relating to his mental condition, see, <em>e. g., </em>United States v. Currens, 290 F.2d 751 (3d Cir. 1961), he sought to introduce evidence of the nature and extent of the debts. The court excluded evidence of certain of the debts, but it did so on the basis that the evidence proffered was not competent to prove the existence of the particular debts. This was not error. Background material should be freely admitted, but it must be competently proved.</p>\n<p id=\"b1293-14\">4. Passing of counterfeit bills</p>\n<p id=\"Az8z\">Over objection by the defendant, the court permitted a government rebuttal witness to testify that nineteen days <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1230\">*1230</page-number>prior to the date on which Davis passed counterfeit bills to the undercover agent, Davis paid for a meal at a restaurant with a counterfeit bill, and appeared to be sane at that time. The witness further testified that one week later Davis returned to ask for the counterfeit money back and that he appeared sane at that time as well.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> We agree with the appellant that this testimony should not have been admitted in rebuttal.</p>\n<p id=\"b1294-4\">The government recognizes that evidence of a defendant\u2019s prior criminal acts is not admissible to prove that the defendant was guilty of the crime for which he is charged because he is a man of criminal character. See, e. g., McCormick, Evidence \u00a7 157 (1954). It maintains, however, that the witness\u2019 testimony concerning Davis\u2019 actions and demeanor during a reasonable period before the offense is admissible to establish Davis\u2019 sanity at the time of the commission of the offense. Evidence of an accused\u2019s conduct may under proper circumstances be introduced to support a lay witness\u2019 testimony that the accused appeared sane during a period reasonably proximate to the commission of the offense. See, e. g., Breland v. United States, 372 F.2d 629 (5th Cir. 1967). But whatever probative value if any, the act of passing a counterfeit bill had on the question of Davis\u2019 sanity at the time of the commission of the offense for which he was charged was outweighed by a substantial danger of unfair prejudice and confusion of issues that could not adequately be cured by the court\u2019s cautionary instructions. See McCormick, <em>supra </em>\u00a7 152, at 319-21. Proof of Davis\u2019 demeanor, orientation, and appearance of sanity at the restaurant did not necessitate testimony that what he was engaged in was the illegal act of passing counterfeit money.</p>\n<p id=\"b1294-9\">5. Recorded conversations</p>\n<p id=\"b1294-10\">The telephone conversation between Davis and the government informant in which Davis agreed to sell the counterfeit notes was tape recorded with the permission of the informant from an extension to the telephone line the informant used in making the call. No warrant authorizing the recording was obtained.</p>\n<p id=\"b1294-11\">Prior to trial to trial the defendant made timely motions for the discovery and inspection of the tapes under Fed. R.Criin.P. 16(a) and 16(b) <footnotemark>7</footnotemark> and for the suppression of the tapes as the product of an illegal search under the Federal Communications Act, 47 U.S.C. \u00a7 605, and the Fourth Amendment. Both motions were denied and the recording was introduced at the trial. We conclude that the court properly refused to suppress the tapes but erred in denying discovery.</p>\n<p id=\"b1294-12\">In denying the discovery motion the trial court held that the recording was not a \u201cstatement\u201d or \u201cconfession\u201d of the accused so as to be discoverable under Rule 16(a) (1) <footnotemark>8</footnotemark> and that the tape was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1231\">*1231</page-number>not a \u201ctangible object\u201d within the meaning of 16(b).<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1295-5\">Rule 16(a) (1) allows the discovery of any \u201cstatements\u201d of the defendant \u201cwithin the possession, custody or control of the government, the existence of which is known, or by the exercise of due diligence may become known, to the attorney for the government.\u201d The Rule does not indicate that the defendant\u2019s discovery rights should be restricted because his words are spoken in the context of a secretly recorded conversation rather than during a formal confession. We agree with and adopt the conclusion of Judge Marovitz in United States v. Lubomski, 277 F.Supp. 713, 721 (N.D.Ill.1967) that secretly made tape recordings of the defendant\u2019s conversations are \u201cstatements\u201d discoverable under 16(a) (1):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1295-6\">If confessions are producible under Rule 16(a) (1), the-same principles would seem to apply even more com-. pellingly to recorded conversations, particularly because the defendant may not even be aware that his remarks were recorded. It seems logical that the considerations requiring production of statements knowingly and willingly made, should apply <em>a for-tiori </em>to incriminating remarks furnished unwittingly to the government. That confessions [sic] of defendants obtained secretly through recording devices are encompassed within the intent of the rule seems apparent from the Comments of the Advisory Committee, which state at one point: \u2018The defendant is not required to designate because he may not always be aware that his statements or confessions are being recorded.\u2019 * * *</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1295-11\">See also United States v. Black, 282 F. Supp. 35 (D.D.C.1968); United States v. Iovinelli, 276 F.Supp. 629 (N.D.Ill. 1967);<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> cf. Cash v. Superior Court, 53 Cal.2d 72, 346 P.2d 407 (1959).</p>\n<p id=\"b1295-13\">In its argument in this court the government asserts that the tape recording should be considered a statement of the informant who made the call so as to fall within the discovery provisions of the Jencks Act, 18 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 3500 (Supp.1969), and therefore will be exempt from discovery under Rule 16(b). The government errs in assuming the Jencks Act\u2019s application to the facts of this case. United States v. Sopher, 362 F.2d 523 (7th Cir. 1966), held that a secretly made tape recording of a defendant\u2019s conversations with an undercover agent did not fall within the , Jencks Act. The court pointed out that the Jencks Act applies to recitals of past occurrences by a prospective prosecution witness, which differ materially from recordings of the events at issue in the trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b1295-15\">As to the motion to suppress, Davis\u2019 contention that the recording and introduction into evidence of his conversation with the informant violated the Federal Communications Act, 47 U.S.C. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1232\">*1232</page-number>\u00a7 605,<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> is without merit. In Rathburn v. United States, 355 U.S. 107, 111, 78 S.Ct. 161, 164, 2 L.Ed.2d 134, 137-138 (1957), the Supreme Court said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1296-4\">Each party to a telephone conversation takes the risk that the other party may have an extension telephone and may allow another to overhear the conversation. When such takes place there has been no violation of any privacy of which the parties may complain. Consequently, one element of Section 605, <em>interception, </em>has not occurred. [Emphasis in original.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1296-5\">In cases following <em>Rathburn </em>lower courts, including this court, have upheld under the Communications Act the introduction of recordings made from extension phones with the permission of one of the parties to the conversation. <em>See, e. g., </em>Rogers v. United States, 369 F.2d 944 (10th Cir. 1966), cert. denied, Ferguson v. United States, 388 U.S. 922, 87 S.Ct. 2125, 18 L.Ed.2d 1371 (1967); Carnes v. United States, 295 F.2d 598 (5th Cir. 1961), cert. denied 369 U.S. 861, 82 S.Ct. 949, 8 L.Ed.2d 19 (1962).</p>\n<p id=\"b1296-13\">The admissibility of the recordings under the Fourth Amendment follows from this court\u2019s decision in Koran v. United States, 5th Cir. 1969, 408 F.2d 1321 [January 27, 1969], petition for cert. filed, 37 U.S.L.Week 3459 (Sup.Ct. May 23, 1969). We there recognized that the Supreme Court\u2019s holding in Katz v. United States, 389 U.S. 347, 351, 88 S.Ct. 507, 511, 19 L.Ed.2d 576, 582 (1967) that \u201cthe Fourth Amendment protects people, not places\u201d<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> shifts the focus of the Fourth Amendment from \u201cprotected areas\u201d to the individual\u2019s expectations of privacy.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> Whether the government\u2019s activity is considered a \u201csearch\u201d depends upon whether the individual\u2019s reasonable expectations of privacy are disturbed<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> Just as no \u201csearch\u201d occurs in the observation of items left in \u201copen view\u201d<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> or an undercover agent\u2019s participation in conversations<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> or an informant\u2019s carrying of a recording device on his person,<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> no \u201csearch\u201d occurred in the re<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1233\">*1233</page-number>cording of the defendant\u2019s telephone conversation with the informant under the circumstances of the present case. Davis' reasonable expectations of privacy were not violated, since he \u201cknowingly took the risk that his conversants might expose his statements.\u201d Koran v. United States, <em>supra. </em>Since no search occurred, no warrant was necessary,<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> and the court properly denied the defendant\u2019s motion to suppress.</p>\n<p id=\"b1297-5\">Reversed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1292-15\">. 18 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 472 (1966).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b1292-16\">. 18 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 473 (1966).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b1292-17\">.

Where the defendant has properly raised as a defense insanity at the time of the commission of the offense, and is unable because of the lack of financial resources to procure adequate evidence on the insanity question, the government may be constitutionally required to afford him access to competent psychiatric testimony. See Bush v. McCollum, 231 F.Supp. 560 (N.D.Tex.1964), aff\u2019d 344 F.2d 672 (5th Cir. 1965); Goldstein &amp; Fine, The Indigent Accused, the Psychiatrist, and the Insanity Defense, 110 U.Pa.L.Rev. 1061 (1962); cf.
