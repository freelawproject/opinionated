He requested an independent psychiatric examination contending that he had been confined for more than nine months and had not received an independent examination. <em>See </em>Watson v. Cameron, 114 U.S.App.D.C. 151, 312 F.2d 878 (1962); De Marcos v. Overholser, 78 U.S.App.D.C. 131, 137 F. 2d 698 (1943). Appellee\u2019s response was that St. Elizabeths\u2019 staff was of the opinion that Proctor had not recovered from his \u201cabnormal mental condition, schizophrenic reaction, chronic undifferentiated type\u201d and that Appellee could not certify that Proctor would not be dangerous to himself or others within the foreseeable future if released, in short that he was not eligible for release.</p>\n<p id=\"b448-9\">Appellant\u2019s court-appointed counsel thereafter renewed his motion for an independent psychiatric examination and on February 3, 1967 the District Court ordered the Legal Psychiatric Service to examine Proctor and render a report within 30 days. The Court\u2019s Order also provided that a copy of the report was to be sent to counsel for Appellant. Accordingly, Dr. Donald Goldberg, a staff psychiatrist for the Service, examined Appellant and reported that in his opinion Proctor \u201ccontinues to suffer from a mental disorder i. e. Schizophrenic reaction, chronic undifferentiated type in partial remission. It is also my feeling that the patient could be dangerous to himself and others if released from Saint Elizabeths Hospital at the present time\u201d.</p>\n<p id=\"b448-14\">Thereafter, in March 1967, a hearing was held on the writ and Appellant, Dr. Goldberg, and Dr. William Schwartz, a staff psychiatrist at Saint Elizabeths, testified. Essentially, Appellant testified that he was not satisfied with the treatment he was receiving at St. Eliza-beths, that he was not insane, and that he would not want to hurt anybody if he were released. Dr. Goldberg was then called by the Government and reiterated the opinion expressed in his report to the Court. He also testified that he could not affirmatively predict that Proctor <em>would </em>be dangerous if released, but he was unable to certify that Proctor would not be dangerous if released. Dr. Schwartz agreed with Dr. Goldberg\u2019s characterization of Appellant\u2019s mental illness as being then substantially in remission, but as to his potential dangerousness, he believed: \u201cHe seems to have extreme passivity and assaultiveness and there doesn\u2019t seem to be much in between, so I would say it would be more <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"385\">*385</page-number>likely that Mr. Proctor would be dangerous than most other people\u201d.</p>\n<p id=\"b449-5\">The District Court concluded that Proctor had failed to sustain his burden of proving his eligibility for release<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> and had not shown that Appellee\u2019s failure to certify him eligible for release was arbitrary or capricious. Accordingly, the writ was discharged.</p>\n<p id=\"b449-6\">It is against this background we must examine Appellant\u2019s argument on appeal<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> which is in essence that an involuntary indigent patient seeking release from St. Elizabeths by habeas corpus does not receive adequate independent psychiatric assistance in prosecuting his petition unless he has the assistance of a \u201cfriendly\u201d expert. He asserts that the present procedure which provides for an independent, non-partisan psychiatric examination fails to supply the Petitioner and his appointed counsel with the asset most critical to their efforts \u201c * * namely, the assistance of a psychiatrist in preparing and presenting appellant\u2019s case at the habeas corpus proceeding.\u201d The unarticulated assumption is that since an affluent person can \u201cshop around\u201d until he finds a psychiatrist who tells him what he wants to hear, and then guides the lawyer in how to conduct cross-examination of other psychiatrists, the court must provide Appellant with the same kind of service.</p>\n<p id=\"b449-7\">This is not the first time that an appellate court has had to consider this sort of claim. In McGarty v. O\u2019Brien, 188 F.2d 151, 154, 1st Cir., cert. denied, 341 U.S. 928, 71 S.Ct. 794, 95 L.Ed. 1359 (1951), the First Circuit was faced with a contention that an indigent accused had been convicted in violation of his Fourteenth Amendment due process rights when the Massachusetts courts had denied his motion that he be \u201c \u2018allowed, at the expense of the Commonwealth, to employ medical experts to impartially examine him, and to be used, if necessary, as witnesses in his behalf.\u2019 \u201d The appellant there was claiming that his right to effective assistance of counsel had been rendered illusory by the court\u2019s failure \u201cto make available to assigned counsel such financial means as may be necessary to enable him to develop and present an appropriate defense.\u201d <em>Id. </em>188 F.2d at 155. Recognizing that a person of modest means, though not \u201cindigent,\u201d is also limited in his ability to marshal an entire entourage of attorneys, experts, and investigators, the First Circuit concluded it was not disposed to provide every person with these auxiliary aids so long as fundamental fairness is achieved.</p>\n<p id=\"b449-9\">The <em>McGarty </em>court hypothetically envisioned the state\u2019s obligations in a case where the independent and non-partisan psychiatric expert arrived at the same professional conclusion as the expert from the Government institution. A person with unlimited financial resources could perhaps find a favorable psychiatrist, therefore does the court have a duty to provide the indigent defendant with the means to continue to \u201cshop\u201d for a favorable expert? The First Circuit found no constitutional demand for such expenditures where the state had already supplied independent expert examinations. <em>McGarty, </em>188 F.2d at 157.</p>\n<p id=\"b449-10\">This court encountered a similar problem in Naples v. United States, 113 U.S. App.D.C. 281, 307 F.2d 618 (1962). There, the defendant wanted the Government to pay the cost of a psychiatrist selected by him. We found no error in the trial court\u2019s ruling that he would not</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b449-11\">\u201cpermit any defendant, at Government expense, to employ a psychiatrist of his own choosing, which means that a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"386\">*386</page-number>defendant can shop around for a favorable expert witness, and then have the Government pay for it. I don\u2019t consider that good administration of justice.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b450-4\"><em>Id. </em>at 286, 307 F.2d at 623. We see no reason to deviate from that resolution. Cf. United States ex rel. Smith v. Baldi, 344 U.S. 561, 73 S.Ct 391, 97 L.Ed. 549 (1953); State v. Crose, 88 Ariz. 389, 357 P.2d 136 (1960).</p>\n<p id=\"b450-5\">From Appellant\u2019s posture, no psychiatrist can really \u201cassist\u201d him adequately unless he agrees with Appellant\u2019s position. Stripped of its verbiage Appellant\u2019s position is that he is entitled to a psychiatrist sufficiently sympathetic so that he will assist counsel in preparing his case favorably to his claims, and, accordingly, in structuring cross-examination of the hospital doctors so as to neutralize their testimony. Neither sound administration, basic fairness, nor constitutional standards require such a course.</p>\n<p id=\"b450-6\">The situation would be entirely different if Appellant had been denied a meaningful hearing where he could \u201cbe present with counsel, have an opportunity to be heard, be confronted with witnesses against him, have the right to cross-examine, and to offer evidence of his own.\u201d Specht v. Patterson, 386 U.S. 605, 610, 87 S.Ct. 1209, 1212, 18 L.Ed.2d 326 (1967). Appellant was granted a full and meaningful hearing. We think that the court\u2019s observations in <em>McGarty </em>are particularly appropriate here:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b450-7\">The [doctor] designated * * * to make the examination [is] not [a partisan] of the prosecution, though [his] fee is paid by the state, any more than is assigned counsel for the defense beholden to the prosecution merely because he is, as here, compensated by the state. Each is given a purely professional job to do \u2014 counsel to represent the defendant to the best of his ability, the designated psychiatrists impartially to examine into and report upon the mental condition of the accused.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b450-8\"><em>McGarty, </em>188 F.2d at 155.</p>\n<p id=\"b450-9\">Although Appellant\u2019s brief disclaims a desire for a \u201cpsychiatric advocate,\u201d it seems clear to us that he really envisions the relationship between a petitioner and psychiatrist as analogous to that existing between petitioner and court-appointed counsel. Indeed, although Judge Bazelon seems to disclaim a desire to provide a \u201cpsychiatric advocate,\u201d he argues that the \u201ccentral tenet of the adversarial process is that each side should attempt to \u2018neutralize\u2019 the evidence of the other side.\u201d This description of the central purpose of the adversary process has very limited application to the expert medical witness, who is, as we have noted, bound to be a neutral if he is to observe the canons of his own discipline. Under the theory of Appellant \u2014 and of the concurring opinion \u2014 reports obtained from examinations conducted by the \u201cfriendly expert\u201d would be submitted directly to petitioner\u2019s counsel and not, as is the present practice, to the court. If counsel found the report helpful to his case he would then be free to call the psychiatrist as an expert on behalf of the petitioner, but if otherwise, not call that witness at all. We have grave doubt that physicians would relish the idea of lending themselves to any such role, demeaning both to them and their profession.</p>\n<p id=\"b450-10\">In further attempting to evaluate the position taken by Appellant, we are well aware of the rationale of our holdings relating to psychiatric assistance for involuntary indigent patients contesting confinement. In De Marcos v. Overholser, 78 U.S.App.D.C. 131, 132, 137 F. 2d 698, 699, cert. denied, 320 U.S. 785, 64 S.Ct. 157, 88 L.Ed. 472 (1943), we observed :</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b450-11\">[T]he right to bring habeas corpus would be of little value to an indigent person unless expert testimony were available to him to rebut the opinion evidence of the staff of the institution who believed he should be continued in custody.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b450-12\">No careful judge is likely to assume the responsibility of allowing an al<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"387\">*387</page-number>leged insane person to go free when the sole expert opinion in the record advises him that such a course is dangerous to the community. * * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"APf\">Therefore, where an indigent confined in a mental hospital seeks habeas corpus it is more important to provide him with an independent psychiatric <em>examination </em>than to give him independent counsel. (Emphasis</blockquote>\n<p id=\"A6U\">Our concern for expert opinion to serve as a check on other expert opinion depicts a striving to assist the Court in resolving complex and elusive issues presented in proceedings of this kind, but our holdings do not mean the process is to go on <em>ad, infinitum; </em>it should not be forgotten that the 1938 legislation providing for the establishment of the Commission on Mental Health, 21 D.C.Cooe \u00a7 308 (1940), which was the focus of the Court\u2019s attention in De Marcos, was \u201cpart of a nationwide movement to give courts the assistance of unbiased experts who are <em>not selected by parties to the proceeding,\u201d </em>De Marcos, <em>id. </em>at 133, 137 F.2d at 700; <em>cf. McGarty, supra.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b451-4\">Before <em>De Marcos, </em>in the case of an indigent, the court was faced with the unsatisfactory prospect of having the staff psychiatrist of the institution in which the petitioner was confined as its only source of expert opinion evidence. To afford a reasonable check on the views of the institutional experts, the court sought to provide an expert who would <em>assist the court </em>in arriving at its determination. Appellant now suggests we traverse the full circle and make the hearing a contest of experts in which each expert seemingly owes partisan allegiance to some litigant. We reject that concept.</p>\n<p id=\"b451-5\">As noted previously, Appellant insists that his appointed expert will not be an advocate in arriving at his medical opinion, but we see no basis for assuming that one court-designated expert needs the surveillance of another psychiatrist who is thrust into what would be essentially a partisan role. <em>See </em>Lake v. Cameron, 124 U.S.App.D.C. 264, 364 F. 2d 657 (1966). Such a course would deprive the court of the very resource which our decisions in De Marcos, supra and Watson v. Cameron, 114 U.S.App.D.C. 151, 312 F.2d 878 (1962), sought to provide.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b451-12\"> The question whether an independent psychiatrist or a hospital staff psychiatrist should \u201ccooperate\u201d with counsel for one who is confined depends on who provides the definition of \u201ccooperate\u201d. We have no occasion to doubt that the expert will do his utmost and exercise the best judgment of which he is capable in aiding the court. By the same token we can expect that he will assist counsel by making available relevant medical and technical information, deemed by him to be reliable and pertinent in his discipline so that the views of other experts may be tested in cross-examination. Such techniques by themselves and through the process of illumination comprise a basis upon which aid to the court may rest. If \u201ccooperation\u201d is thus achieved, no more need be asked. But the fact remains that psychiatrists are physicians, not advocates; <footnotemark>6</footnotemark> nevertheless, when they express views which are not in accord with those harbored by the confined patient or his counsel, there is a partisan tendency to regard such an expert as an adversary. It is absurd to suggest that Government psychiatrists are \u201cuncooperative\u201d in this context; we can readily take judicial notice that over a dozen years or more the medical views of these Government psychiatrists, as a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"388\">*388</page-number>whole, generally turned out to be more favorable to defendants than to prosecutors in verdicts of not guilty by reason of insanity. In observing this we do so to acknowledge, and not in any sense to challenge, their independent stance as professional people.</p>\n<p id=\"b452-4\">This record totally fails to support the idea that Appellant was denied any relevant information or other legitimate assistance from government employed psychiatrists.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> If Appellant seeks the aid of a psychiatrist to act in any capacity other than as an independent professional person whose function is to aid the trier of the issues, we are not prepared to oblige him.</p>\n<p id=\"b452-5\">Affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b448-11\">.

Notwithstanding some dicta indications to the contrary in Thornton v. Corcoran, 132 U.S.App.D.C.-, 407 F.2d 695 (Jan. 3, 1969), in Lake v. Cameron, 124 U.S. App.D.C. 264, 268, 270, 364 F.2d 657, 661, 663 (1966), both the majority and dissenting opinions recognized that \u201c[proceedings involving the care and treatment of the mentally ill are not strictly adversary proceedings.\u201d (maj. opin. per Bazelon, C. J.) <em>See </em>note 7 <em>infra.</em></p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b451-14\">.

That the confining institution must make its records available to the court and otherwise cooperate in providing information about the patient was made clear in our opinion in Bolton v.

Code \u00a7 301(d) (1967). The failure of the majority to distinguish among these roles produces needless confusion concerning the claims of the appellant in this case and the proper resolution of the issues presented.</p>\n<p id=\"b452-8\">First, and most obviously, the psychiatrist may examine the petitioner, report to the court and testify concerning his conclusions. In this role, the psychiatrist whether hired by the patient, appointed by the court or employed by Saint Elizabeths Hospital is by oath impartial. The majority merely states the obvious when it concludes that the appellant cannot claim a right to favorable testimony from a \u201cfriendly\u201d expert.</p>\n<p id=\"b452-12\">The uncertainty surrounding the diagnosis of and prognosis for mental illness is such that an affluent patient able to finance a thorough search may likely find an expert whose honest testimony will be favorable to his cause. But despite the suspicion with which the law views distinctions based upon wealth in court proceedings, it has not yet been found practicable to assure the indigent patient the same scope for psychiatrist-shopping that the rich patient enjoys. The indigent patient may perhaps claim some voice in the choice of an independent expert who is qualified and impartial; as the majority points out, the appellant cannot demand an expert who \u201cagrees\u201d with him.</p>\n<p id=\"b452-13\">But this is not the appellant\u2019s request; his counsel in fact explicitly refuses to roost upon this straw man erected by the majority. Mr. Proctor claims a right not to the favorable testimony of a psychiatrist, but to the assistance of a psychiatrist in preparing his case.</p>\n<p id=\"b452-14\">A psychiatrist plays quite different roles in testifying and in providing assistance off the witness stand to a patient seeking release. Testimony should ring clear and true. But the premise of our law is that truth is best insured by an adversarial struggle. Because this is so, the majority enters quite another realm when it slides from the self-obvious proposition that the appellant is not entitled to the favorable testimony of a psychiatrist to the quite different conclusion that \u201cneither sound administra<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"389\">*389</page-number>tion, basic fairness nor contitutional standards\u201d may entitle the appellant and his appointed counsel to assistance from a qualified psychiatrist \u201cin structuring cross-examination of the hospital doctors so as to neutralize their testimony.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b453-4\">The central tenet of the adversarial process is that each side should attempt to \u201cneutralize\u201d the evidence of the other side. That purpose alone explains the right to confrontation and cross-examination. The majority opinion suggests that the impartiality of the hopsital psychiatrist all but obviates the need for effective cross-examination. This argument might be valid if our only concern were the possibility of bias or bad faith. But the right to cross-examination serves broader needs. The direct testimony of even an impartial expert may be, however unintentionally, incomplete or otherwise misleading to a fact-finder unversed in psychiatry. The risk is multiplied by the fact that a Government attorney elicits this direct testimony. It is unnecessary to accuse either the neutral psychiatrist or the Government attorney of bad faith in order to conclude that vigorous cross-examination is essential to provide the fullest and most balanced presentation to the fact-finder.</p>\n<p id=\"b453-5\">The appointment of counsel, while not a matter of constitutional right in habeas corpus proceedings,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> 2*is appropriate and necessary \u201cwhere a petition * * presents a triable issue of fact the clear presentation of which requires an ability to organize factual data or to call witnesses and elicit testimony in a logical fashion * * United States ex rel. Wissenfeld v. Wilkins, 281 F.2d 707, 715 (2d Cir. 1960). In addition to structuring the petitioner\u2019s affirmative case, a lawyer is also necessary to conduct the effective cross-examination which can \u201cneutralize\u201d opposing witnesses.</p>\n<p id=\"b453-14\">But if an indigent patient needs and is entitled to a lawyer, far more may he also need the assistance of a psychiatrist in the preparation of his case. This court has often pointed out the difficulty a lawyer untutored in the arcane mysteries of psychiatry may encounter when appointed to represent an indigent who is mentally disturbed.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> If the attorney is cut off from all sources of expert assistance on these matters, the patient may be effectively denied his right to an adversarial determination of his mental health and likely dangerousness.</p>\n<p id=\"b453-15\">It is, however, far easier to announce the principle that an indigent patient and his attorney are entitled to some psychiatric assistance preparing for and participating in an adversarial hearing than to map out a workable means to implement the right. This Court pointed out in Thornton v. Corcoran, <em>swpra, </em>the duty of the professional staff at Saint Eliza-beths Hospital to cooperate with counsel appointed to represent indigent patients. It seems even more clear that a psychiatrist appointed to conduct an independent examination should also be available for consultation by appointed counsel.</p>\n<p id=\"b453-16\">An independent psychiatrist rendering such assistance must of course distinguish scrupulously between his role as an impartial expert in reporting to the court and testifying, and his role as an adviser on psychiatric matters for the patient\u2019s counsel. Delicate questions will, of course, arise. But an independent psychiatrist could, it would seem, advise an attorney of the nature of his indigent client\u2019s mental abnormalities, the degree of uncertainty surrounding diagnoses of this sort.of illness, and the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"390\">*390</page-number>lines of inquiry which might best help his client.</p>\n<p id=\"b454-4\">The record in this case does not demonstrate that the appointed psychiatrist, or for that matter the hospital doctors themselves, refused to cooperate with the appointed counsel for the appellant. Consequently, I can not conclude that the appellant has shown a denial of the sort of psychiatric assistance in the preparation of his case to which he is entitled. Accordingly, I concur in the result reached by the majority.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b453-6\">. <em>See </em>Brown v.
