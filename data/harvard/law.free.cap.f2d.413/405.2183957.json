On November 2, 1966, while the proceedings involving petitioner were <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"406\">*406</page-number>pending before the Service, Congress amended Section 245<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> of the Immigration and Naturalization Act. Under this amended provision petitioner applied to the Service for adjustment of his status to that of an alien admitted for permanent residence. The Special Inquiry Officer to whom his application was remanded by the Board of Immigration Appeals found petitioner deportable and denied his application for adjustment of status. His request to be permitted voluntarily to depart was also denied. Petitioner\u2019s appeal to the Board of Immigration Appeals was dismissed by order of the Board on the ground that under Section 212(a) (9) <footnotemark>2</footnotemark> petitioner was statutorily ineligible for the adjustment of status since he had been convicted of false pretenses with \u201cintent to defraud,\u201d on each of two counts of an information under 22 D.C.Code \u00a7 1301. He now petitions this court for review of this order of the Board of Immigration Appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b470-4\">The sole ground presented is that Section 212(a) (9), in using the standard \u201ca crime involving moral turpitude\u201d to create ineligibility for adjustment of status, is unconstitutionally vague, and is void as an indefinite delegation of power to an administrative agency.</p>\n<p id=\"b470-12\">We think this challenge to the statutory standard is foreclosed to this court by Jordan v. DeGeorge, 341 U.S. 223, 71 S.Ct. 703, 95 L.Ed. 886.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Though petitioner points to the statement of the Court in <em>DeGeorge </em>that the question of vagueness was not- raised by the parties or argued, the Court, no doubt referring to the dissenting opinion, said \u00ab* * * it hag been suggested that the phrase \u2018crime involving moral turpitude\u2019 lacks sufficiently definite standards to justify this deportation proceeding and that the statute before us is therefore unconstitutional for vagueness.\u201d<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> The Court then examined the application of the vagueness doctrine to the statute, notwithstanding the matter had not been raised by the parties or argued. The Court said it did this in view of the grave nature of deportation. Upon full consideration of the question the Court upheld the statute as constitutional,<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> especially in its application to \u201ccrimes in which fraud is an ingredient,\u201d the situation in petitioner\u2019s case. Deeming the Supreme Court to be now the proper forum for presentation of appellant\u2019s contentions we have not considered them on the merits.</p>\n<p id=\"b470-14\">Affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b470-5\">.
