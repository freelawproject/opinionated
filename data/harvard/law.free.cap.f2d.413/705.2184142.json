The Board found, in agreement with the trial examiner, that the Union violated Sections 8(b) (2) and 8(b) (1) (A) of the Act, 29 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 158(b) (2) and 158(b) (1) (A), by causing Ledford Bros., a contracting firm, to discriminate against and to fire an employee, Thomas Connolly, because he was not a member of the Union. The Board found that the Union had previously refused the employee Union membership. The Board\u2019s order requires the Union to make Connolly whole for any loss of pay caused by the unfair labor practice and to notify the company that it has no objection to Connolly\u2019s employment without regard to his membership or non-membership in the Union.</p>\n<p id=\"b769-22\">Thomas Connolly was a member of the International Union of Operating Engineers, Local Union No. 12, in 1956, when he began working for a company which by a collective bargaining agreement re<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"706\">*706</page-number>quired him to join another union. Connolly dropped his membership in the Engineers Union, but did not receive a withdrawal card. In 1962 Connolly sought employment with Ledford Bros., which was subject to a collective bargaining contract with the Engineers Union. This agreement required union membership after eight days on the job; it also provided for the referral of prospective employees through a dispatch or hiring hall according to the priority rating of the prospective employee.</p>\n<p id=\"b770-4\">Arthur Ledford, a partner in Ledford Bros., wanted to hire Connolly; he had known Connolly for 20 years and liked his work. The Board found that Led-ford and Connolly talked to a Union representative and tried to obtain Connolly\u2019s reinstatement in the Union. When this attempt at reinstatement was unsuccessful, Ledford hired Connolly anyway, without going through the hiring hall. For more than two years Connolly worked for Ledford Bros, without incident or complaint from the Union.</p>\n<p id=\"b770-5\">Then in May, 1964, Skidmore, the business agent for the Union, spoke to Ledford about Connolly. In January, 1965, Skidmore asked Ledford for the first time to get rid of Connolly because he was not a Union member. Nothing was said, however, about Connolly not being hired through the dispatch hall. In August, 1965, Skidmore spoke to Connolly about his non-Union status; he told him that it would cost $300 to be reinstated, and that he would be placed on the low priority hiring list. Three months later Skidmore talked to Ledford again about Connolly. Ledford said he would try to get Connolly back in the Union and Skidmore told Ledford to send Connolly to the Union hall in Los Angeles. Connolly saw a Union representative in Los Angeles who referred him to the Union office in Santa Ana. There, another Union representative told Connolly that there was no reason to give him consideration; the representative also told Connolly that reinstatement would cost $300 and that he would be placed on the low priority hiring list. This would mean that he would not be able to retain his job with Ledford Bros, because of the number of men out of work and ahead of him on the list. The representative also mentioned, for the first time, that Connolly was not originally hired through the hiring hall. Connolly did not tender the reinstatement payment, but returned to work the next day.</p>\n<p id=\"b770-7\">A month later Skidmore threatened to shut down the company if it did not fire Connolly. Skidmore gave John Ledford, the other partner in the business, a printed form which, under the heading \u201cReason For Request For Corrective Action\u201d, listed two reasons for the request. The first reason \u2014 that Connolly was not a Union member \u2014 was not checked. The second reason \u2014 that Connolly was not hired through the dispatch hall \u2014 was checked. Fearing a shut-down, the company terminated Connolly.</p>\n<p id=\"b770-8\">Before the Board, the Union took the position that it was merely enforcing the hiring hall provision of its collective bargaining contract; that since Connolly was not hired through the dispatch hall, he could not work for Ledford Bros. The trial examiner and the Board found, however, that this was only a pretext for the Union action. The true reason was Connolly\u2019s lack of Union membership. The Board found that this lack of membership resulted from the Union\u2019s refusal to reinstate Connolly in 1962, before he began working for the company. This initial refusal prevented Connolly from building up seniority which would have entitled him to a high priority rating on the hiring hall list. Consequently, the Board reasoned, Connolly was not subject to the union-security provision of the contract because of the Union\u2019s refusal to allow reinstatement in 1962.</p>\n<p id=\"b770-9\">The Union objects to enforcement of the Board\u2019s order, urging that the order is not supported by substantial evidence on the record as a whole. Specifically, the Union contends that the Board\u2019s finding that the Union refused to reinstate Connolly in 1962, before he went to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"707\">*707</page-number>work for Ledford Bros., is based on the incompetent hearsay testimony of only one witness, Arthur Ledford. The Union would have the Board disregard this testimony.</p>\n<p id=\"b771-4\">This argument is without merit. Ordinarily, where there is no objection to hearsay evidence, it is a clear indication that the evidence is not disputed, hence the absence of objection. Most of Ledford\u2019s testimony was not hearsay; he testified that he talked to a Union representative named Greenstreet concerning Connolly\u2019s reinstatement before hiring the latter. This is direct, uncontradicted testimony of what Led-ford himself did. Ledford also testified that he \u201cunderstood\u201d that Connolly had contacted the Union about reinstatement before he was hired. There was no objection to this hearsay testimony. \u201cHearsay, even at common law, if unobjected to when offered, can be of probative value, and certainly occupies a similar position in an administrative proceeding such as this.\u201d Fox v. San Francisco Unified School Dist., 111 Cal.App.2d 885, 891, 245 P.2d 603, 607-608 (1952). A proceeding before the Board is to be conducted in accordance with the rules of evidence applicable in the district courts of the United States, N. L.R.A. \u00a7 10(b), 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 160(b). Unobjeeted to hearsay is admissible and of probative value in the district courts. Pearson v. Dennison, 353 F.2d 24, 29 n. 10 (CA 9, 1965). See 29 Am.Jur.2d, Evidence \u00a7 494, and 30 Am.Jur.2d, Evidence \u00a7 1103.</p>\n<p id=\"b771-5\">We agree with the Board that Led-ford\u2019s uncontradieted testimony constitutes substantial evidence to support the finding that the Union refused to reinstate Connolly before he was hired by Ledford Bros, in 1962. Respondent points out that Connolly himself did not testify on this subject. This is not controlling, however, as there was the un-contradicted testimony of Ledford that he and Connolly spoke to Greenstreet, the Union representative, and were unable to get Connolly reinstated. Respondent did not object to Ledford\u2019s testimony, nor did it present evidence in rebuttal \u2014 Greenstreet did not testify.</p>\n<p id=\"b771-8\">Respondent cites several cases for its view that the Board should have disregarded Ledford\u2019s hearsay testimony. These cases are distinguishable as they involve situations not present here; either the hearsay was uncorroborated or contradicted, or there was an objection to it. Consolidated Edison Co. et al. v. N.L.R.B., 305 U.S. 197, 230, 59 S.Ct. 206, 83 L.Ed. 126 (1938) and Oughton v. N.L.R.B., 118 F.2d 486, 490 (3 Cir.1941) indicate that unsubstantiated and uncorroborated hearsay does not constitute substantial evidence upon which to base a finding. These cases are inapplicable, however, as in the present case, Led-ford\u2019s hearsay testimony is corroborated by his direct testimony based on his own personal knowledge.</p>\n<p id=\"b771-9\">In N.L.R.B. v. Lowell Sun Publishing Co., 320 F.2d 835, 841 (1 Cir.1963), the Board found that the company discharged an employee because of his union activity. The Board based this finding partly on hearsay. In thoroughly examining the record, the reviewing court found that the real reason for the employee\u2019s discharge was his dereliction of duty, and not an anti-union bias by the company. In the face of this contradictory evidence, the court held that the hearsay testimony could not support the Board\u2019s finding. Similarly, in N.L.R.B. v. Amalgamated Meat Cutters, 202 F.2d 671, 673 (2 Cir.1953), the Board found that an employee had been discriminato-rily discharged on the basis of hearsay testimony of the employee that a company official had told the employee that the union would not let the company keep him because he was not a union member. There was contradictory evidence \u2014 there was no general agreement that new employees must belong to the union and the company official denied making the statement that the union forced the company to discharge the employee. The court held that where there is direct contradictory evidence, hearsay alone cannot amount to substantial evi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"708\">*708</page-number>dence to support the Board\u2019s finding. These cases are also inapposite. In the instant case, there is no contradictory evidence; the Union did not present the testimony of the Union representative, Greenstreet, or anyone else, contradicting Ledford\u2019s testimony. Furthermore, most of Ledford\u2019s testimony was not hearsay, but based on his own personal knowledge.</p>\n<p id=\"b772-4\">Superior Engraving Co. v. N.L.R.B., 183 F.2d 783, 792, 794 (7 Cir.1950), holds that a trial examiner may properly exclude hearsay testimony. This case, too, is inapplicable. There was no objection to the Ledford testimony as there apparently was in <em>Superior Engraving. </em>As discussed above, unobjected to hearsay is admissible and of probative value.</p>\n<p id=\"b772-5\">The petition for enforcement is granted.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
