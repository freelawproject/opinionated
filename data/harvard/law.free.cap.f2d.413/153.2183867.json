They brought this class action against the Company in the United States District Court for the District of the Canal Zone on behalf of the pilots and pilots-in-training employed by the Company, seeking a declaratory judg<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"154\">*154</page-number>ment that, under Canal Zone statutes and regulations, they are entitled to a \u201ctropical differential,\u201d i.e., compensation for overseas service in addition to a base salary. The appellants\u2019 complaint alleged two different theories \u2014 referred to as causes of action \u2014 for arriving at the base salary upon which to compute the tropical differential. Although we do not have before us the portion of the record relating to the district court\u2019s disposition of the second of the appellants\u2019 theories, the court apparently dismissed that theory from the case, calling its ruling a grant of summary judgment. The court declined to grant \u201csummary judgment\u201d as to the portion of the appellants\u2019 complaint containing another computation theory. However, after a full trial on the merits, the court granted summary judgment for the Company on the basis of Leber v. Canal Zone Central Labor Union<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> which was handed down subsequent to the trial. We agree with the appellants that the court below misapprehended the import of the <em>Leber </em>case; accordingly, we reverse the judgment of the district court and remand the case for further proceedings, including the making of appropriate findings of fact and conclusions of law.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b218-4\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b218-5\">The Panama Canal Company is a corporate agency of the United States<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> whose employment practices, among other things, are subject to regulation by the Secretary of the Army<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> in accordance with the applicable provisions of the Canal Zone Code.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Subsection 144 (b) of title 2 of the Code states in pertinent part: \u201cThe rates of basic compensation <em>may be established </em>and revised in relation to rates of compensation for the same or similar work performed in the continental United States * * *.\u201d<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> The permissive <em>may </em>of this statute is transformed into a mandatory <em>shall </em>in the Secretary\u2019s regulations:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b218-12\">(b) Rates of pay * * * for all security positions <em>shall be established </em>in relation to rates for the same or similar work performed in the continental United States by employees of the Government of the United States. * * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b218-14\">(c) The rates established under this section constitute the base salary or wage rates for the positions in question.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b218-15\">In addition to the base salary thus provided for, the Code also provides that employees who are United States citizens must be paid \u201can overseas (tropical) differential not in excess of an amount equal to 25 percent of the aggregate amount of the rate of basic compensation * * *.\u201d<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> Prior to 1964, the regulations merely repeated the statutory language permitting a differential <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"155\">*155</page-number>up to 25 percent,<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> thus leaving to the discretion of the Company \u2014 subject to a requirement of uniformity of compensation<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> \u2014 the determination of the precise amount of the differential. In 1944, the Secretary amended the regulations to specify a lower amount for the differential and to make certain categories of employees ineligible for the differential.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b219-5\">In the <em>Leber </em>case, five of the Company\u2019s employees who had been made ineligible for the differential by the Secretary\u2019s 1964 amendments to the regulations contended that the new regulations contravened the Code provision establishing the differential. In rejecting the contention, the court stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b219-6\">Recognizing the purpose of overseas or tropical differential [to encourage United States citizens to work overseas], we conclude that Congress meant to leave the amount of the differential to the discretion of the President and his delegates.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b219-7\">In response to the Company\u2019s motion for summary judgment, the court below expressed the view that <em>Leber </em>held that the Company had complete discretion regarding payment of the tropical differential. The court was of the opinion that the Secretary of the Army had re-delegated his authority to the Company by the promulgaton of the regulations relating to the differential.</p>\n<p id=\"b219-20\">We cannot accept the district court\u2019s view of either the <em>Leber </em>case or the regulations. <em>Leber </em>does indicate that the heads of the various departments, in the Canal Zone possess considerable discretion concerning the differential.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> Indeed, this is clear from the facts that both statute and regulation, prior to 1964, permitted the department head to set the differential at any percentage up to 25 percent. However, the Secretary carefully circumscribed the scope of the department head\u2019s discretion by requiring that the differential \u201cshall be uniform within and among all departments.\u201d <footnotemark>14</footnotemark> The Company\u2019s answers to the appellants\u2019 interrogatories indicate that it paid all other eligible employees a 25 percent differential prior to the 1964 amendment and the appropriate percentage thereafter. Thus the Company could not simply refuse to pay the differential to the pilots. If the Company found \u201cpractical difficulties or unnecessary hardships\u201d involved in paying the pilots a differential, the Secretary\u2019s regulations provided a procedure for obtaining authority to deviate from the regulatory provisions.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> In the absence of authority to deviate,<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> however, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"156\">*156</page-number>the Company was legally obligated to pay the differential required by the applicable regulations during the relevant period.</p>\n<p id=\"b220-4\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b220-5\">Although for purposes of decision our consideration of this appeal could end here, efficiency in the administration of justice compels us to attempt to obviate some of the confusion in this case.<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> The appellants\u2019 complaint stated a single claim for relief, <em>i.e., </em>the payment of the differential required by the regulations. However, the complaint stated alternative theories for computing the amount of the differential due. First, the appellants suggested that the amount of the differential should be determined on the basis of the salary which the pilots had actually received during the relevant time periods, apparently inviting the court to presume that the salary received was \u201cbase salary\u201d for purposes of determining the amount payable as differential. Alternatively, the appellants suggested that the Company be required to establish the base salary of pilots in relation to the rates for the same or similar positions in the continental United States and then to compute the differential as thus derived.</p>\n<p id=\"b220-6\">Apparently the district court originally ruled, early in the proceedings below, that the first alternative was the appropriate method of computation and dismissed the second alternative.<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> As already indicated, the portion of the trial transcript relating to the court\u2019s action on the second alternative is not included in the record and thus we have no way of knowing whether the appellant\u2019s objected to the court\u2019s ruling. However, since we are of the opinion that the court\u2019s ruling was <em>plain error, </em>we must recognize it even in the absence of an objection.<footnotemark>19</footnotemark> Our discussion in part I of this opinion makes clear that the Company must set the pilots\u2019 base salary in relation to rates for the same or similar work performed in the continental United States by employees of the Government of the United States. The Company does not dispute this proposition but argues instead that the appellants cannot prevail because there are no such same or similar positions from which to derive the Canal pilots base salaries. In another part of its brief, the Company undermines this argument by contending that Navy pilots are the most similar continental positions and that \u201c[t]he Company, therefore, could pay its pilots base rates fixed in relation to the Navy pilots\u2019 rates if it chose to do so.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b220-12\">In any event, it is perfectly clear from the record before us that there are at least two <em>similar </em>positions in the continental United States in relation to which the pilots\u2019 base salaries could be derived, <em>viz., </em>MSTS masters or mates and Navy pilots. The affidavit of the Company\u2019s personnel director states in pertinent part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b220-13\">The Company considers that the position of master of ocean-going vessels is not comparable to the position of its pilots, either as to duties and responsibilities or as to the circumstances under which the respective employments are performed. The principal point of difference is that for the captain of an ocean-going ship navigation in confined waters is a minor part of his duties if, indeed, he performs any at all, whereas a Panama Canal pilot handles such navigation almost exclu<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"157\">*157</page-number>sively. Accordingly, the Company prior to April 1958 used masters\u2019 rates for certain classes of vessels only as bench marks to each of which a number of different pilots\u2019 rates were related for purposes of pay adjustments. Commencing April 20, 1958 the use of maritime rates even as bench marks was discontinued altogether and the present pay system was adopted.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b221-5\">******</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b221-6\">The Company considers that there is no pilotage work performed by employees of the United States Government in the continental United States that is sufficiently comparable to provide an appropriate wage base for Panama Canal pilots. The Department of the Navy hires pilots in the United States but their duties are considered to be generally less difficult than those of the Company\u2019s employees. The Navy pilots\u2019 rates, which are substantially lower than those paid to Panama Canal pilots, have not been used as a base for wage-fixing by the Company.<footnotemark>20</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b221-7\">The Company appears to read the regulations to mean that the pilots\u2019 base salary shall be fixed at the <em>same rate for the same position </em>in the continental United States. The regulations simply do not advert to the same rate or solely to the same position. The provision states that the base salary rates \u201cshall be established <em>in relation to </em>rates for the same or <em>similar </em>work performed in the continental United States * * <footnotemark>21</footnotemark> The Secretary obviously anticipated that every position in the Panama Canal Company would not have an exact equivalent in the continental United States. Thus the regulations permit the derivation of appropriate rates from merely similar continental positions. The fact that the pilots in the continental United States operate primarily in different waters or have different duties and responsibilities does not make them wholly dissimilar. The differences simply require adjustment of the salary rates. Thus, insofar as a similar continental position entails greater responsibility or requires higher qualifications, the Canal Zone rate must be adjusted downward to an appropriate level; conversely, insofar as the continental position entails less responsibility or requires lower qualifications, the Canal Zone rate must be adjusted upward to an appropriate level.</p>\n<p id=\"b221-12\">It should be noted that we make no findings whatever as to which similar continental position or positions are most appropriate for use in deriving the base salaries for the various levels of pilots and pilots-in-training during the years involved in this case. We find only that there are some similar positions which can be used by the Company to derive the base salaries. Additionally, we think it appropriate to permit the parties to introduce evidence upon remand as to any factual issues raised by this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b222-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"158\">*158</page-number>The judgment of the district court is reversed and the case is remanded for further proceedings not inconsistent with this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b222-4\">Reversed and remanded.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b218-6\">. 383 F.2d 110 (5th Cir. 1967), <em>rev\u2019g </em>Canal Zone Central Labor Union and Metal Trades Council, A.F.L.-C.I.O. v.
