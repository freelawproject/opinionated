The chief witness for the prosecution was a confessed accomplice. Mainly because he had earlier been convicted in the State court of armed robbery in the hold-up, and had made prior inconsistent statements as to Smith\u2019s participation in the crime, and also because of the like unsavory record of another critical witness, appellant questions the sufficiency of the proof.</p>\n<p id=\"b357-22\">With trial before the District Judge without a jury, the testimony to guilt overcame the required caution against accepting the word of an accomplice without corroboration, and left no reasonable doubt of Smith\u2019s perpetration of the offenses for which judgment went against him. <em>Cf. </em>United States v. Maddox, 394 F.2d 297, 299 (4 Cir. 1968).</p>\n<p id=\"b357-23\">Affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
