The conviction was affirmed by the Pennsylvania Supreme <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"501\">*501</page-number>Court in Commonwealth v. Snyder, 408 Pa. 253, 182 A.2d 495 (1962)<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b565-5\">In 1966, further relief was sought in a petition filed in the sentencing court under Pennsylvania\u2019s Post Conviction Hearing Act. This petition was dismissed without hearing and affirmed by the state Supreme Court in an extensive opinion at 427 Pa. 83, 233 A.2d 530 (1967).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Having exhausted his state remedies, the appellant then filed a habeas corpus petition in the district court below. Here he reiterated the arguments advanced in the state post-conviction proceeding. Foremost among these was the contention that the 1961 conviction had resulted from the admission at trial of allegedly coerced confessions.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Relying on the decision of the Pennsylvania Supreme Court, the district court denied relief without evidentiary hearing. This appeal followed, and was argued pro se by appellant who is now on parole.</p>\n<p id=\"b565-7\">The appellant has alleged facts describing the taking of his confessions which are strikingly similar to those portrayed in Escobedo v. Illinois, 378 U.S. 478, 84 S.Ct. 1758, 12 L.Ed.2d 977 (1964) <footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Even so, because Snyder\u2019s trial occurred in 1961, three years before the decision in <em>Escobedo, </em>the non-retroactive rule of Johnson v. New Jersey, 384 U.S. 719, 86 S.Ct. 1772, 16 L.Ed.2d 882 (1966), precludes application of the precise rule of <em>Escobedo </em>to this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b565-9\">This is not to say, however, that the facts alleged by him are not relevant to the question whether the confession was his voluntary act. On the contrary, such facts could constitute significant components in the \u201ctotality of circumstances\u201d affecting its voluntary character.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b565-10\">Appellant claims that at the very least he is entitled to an evidentiary hearing so that he may demonstrate that the statements adduced from him by the police were the product of coercive forces. Diluting the efficacy of this apparently reasonable argument, however, has been a previous determination by the Pennsylvania Supreme Court that the appellant, for sound tactical reasons at trial, intentionally waived any objection to their introduction, \u201cdeliberately bypass [ing] state procedures available to litigate the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"502\">*502</page-number>allegation.\u201d The trial record discloses that appellant\u2019s counsel did not object to the admission of the confession; and the state court reasoned that no objection was made because the statement contained much exculpatory material which \u201cconstituted substantial support for appellant\u2019s defense.\u201d <footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b566-4\">Although we agree with the Pennsylvania court\u2019s statement of the law that an effective waiver will bar collateral attack, we have some difficulty in reconciling this principle with the record facts of this case.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> It is true that the transcript in this pre-Jackson v. Denno <footnotemark>8</footnotemark> trial contains no objection by counsel to the introduction of the confession. But the record is equally devoid of any discussion or dialogue from which any conclusion of waiver by the appellant may be convincingly demonstrated.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b566-5\">The Supreme Court has made it clear that for a waiver to be effective, it must be the \u201cconsidered choice of the petitioner. * * * A choice made by counsel not participated in by the petitioner does not automatically bar relief.\u201d Fay v. Noia, 372 U.S. 391, 439, 83 S.Ct. 822, 849 (1963).</p>\n<p id=\"b566-13\"> Moreover, the record must convincingly demonstrate a factual background for a finding of waiver, and failing this, an evidentiary hearing is required. Henry v. Mississippi, 379 U.S. 443, 85 S.Ct. 564, 13 L.Ed.2d 408 (1965).</p>\n<p id=\"b566-14\">Here there is no testimony upon which to make a proper adjudication of this issue. On the basis of the present record \u2014consisting only of the trial transcript, there having been no post-conviction evi-dentiary hearings in any of the state or federal proceedings \u2014 we are unable to decide whether an effective waiver was made. The record simply does not address itself to this point. Undoubtedly, the record is capable of supporting the hypothesis that no objection was made by counsel for tactical reasons. On the other hand, it is equally capable of supporting the appellant\u2019s assertion that he had no part in counsel\u2019s decision not to object. This is especially true where, as here, the defense was not provided with a copy of the confession until the moment of its <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"503\">*503</page-number>offer by the state, affording little time for deliberate reflection.</p>\n<p id=\"b567-5\">The existence of possibly conflicting inferences amply demonstrates that the question of waiver is not one which should be resolved by an appellate hypothesis divined from a silent record. To do so is to presume the abandonment of rights; such a presumption flies in the face of what has been called the Supreme Court's abhorrence of technical forfeiture and waiver.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> The Court has stated in unequivocal terms: \u201cThere is a presumption against the waiver of constitutional rights, see e. g., Glasser v. United States, 815 U.S. 60, 70-71, 62 S.Ct. 457, 464-465, 86 L.Ed. 680, and for a waiver to be effective it must be clearly established that there was \u2018an intentional relinquishment or abandonment of a known right or privilege.\u2019 Johnson v. Zerbst, 804 U.S. 458, 464, 58 S.Ct. 1019, 82 L.Ed. 1461.\u201d Brookhart v. Janis, 384 U.S. 1, 4, 86 S.Ct. 1245, 1247, 16 L.Ed.2d 314 (1965).</p>\n<p id=\"b567-6\">We are quick to recognize that there may be circumstances where the issue of waiver is capable of proper resolution by an examination of the trial record alone. Brookhart v. Janis, <em>supra. </em>But this is not such a case; it is one which requires an evidentiary hearing on the threshold question of waiver, such as this court confronted in United States ex rel. Gockley v. Myers, 378 F.2d 398 (3 Cir. 1967). There we remanded a c\u00e1se for further hearing on the question of waiver even though counsel had expressly voiced \u201cno objection\u201d to the introduction of an incriminating statement. We reiterate what we said there:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b567-7\">\u201cWe think the issue of waiver must be decided, after opportunity is afforded to the parties to supplement the record on this question if they so desire. And if the court finds no waiver of constitutional right to challenge the admission of the petitioner\u2019s statements it will then be necessary to consider and decide whether due process of law was denied by the use of this evidence against the accused.\u201d 378 F.2d at 401.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b567-11\">And to obviate the necessity for additional direction from this court should the district court determine, after hearing, that there was no waiver, we hold that it would be appropriate for the district court to decide whether due process of law was denied by the use of the statements against the accused. See United States ex rel. Gockley v. Myers, 411 F.2d 216 (3 Cir. 1969).<footnotemark>11</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b567-12\">The order of the district court will be vacated and the cause remanded for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b565-11\">. The issues raised on this direct appeal were: (1) it was error to permit evidence of a prior plea of nolo contendere to impeach the defendant when he testified in his defense; (2) the introduction of a vial of the victim\u2019s blood was prejudicial ; and (3) the introduction of photos of the victim was prejudicial.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b565-15\">. The issues raised on this collateral appeal were: (1) the introduction of four coerced confessions; (2) use of perjured testimony by the Commonwealth; (3) false statements by the trial judge obstructing the right to appeal; and (4) denial of due process in failing to afford an evidentiary hearing on the substantive allegations.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b565-18\">. Appellant maintains that four separate coerced confessions were introduced against him: (1) an oral statement given to the arresting officers, written notes of which were introduced at trial; (2) a signed statement (Commonwealth Exhibit No. 35) obtained during interrogation at the stationhouse; (3) certain testimony concerning the re-enactment of the homicide performed by the appellant for the police; and (4) appellant\u2019s actual testimony at trial which he claims was involuntarily given.</p>\n<p id=\"Aoz\">We have carefully considered each of these \u201cconfessions\u201d and have concluded that only the first two are worthy of consideration.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b565-23\">. Appellant alleges that the police initially attempted to prevent his attorney from ascertaining his whereabouts and failing to accomplish this, employed \u201can armed guard\u201d to prevent the lawyer from gaining access to his client.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b565-24\">. See Johnson v. New Jersey, <em>supra, </em>384 U.S. at 730, 86 S.Ct. 1772; Davis v. North Carolina (384 U.S. 737, 86 S.Ct. 1761, 16 L.Ed.2d 895 (1966). In addition to preventing him from consulting with counsel, the appellant alleges that while being interrogated, he could hear his wife screaming in an adjoining room, that he was refused permission to see her, that he was held incommunicado for five hours, that he was deceived into believing that he would be charged with nothing worse than manslaughter, and that he was assured that he could see his attorney as soon as his counsel arrived.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b566-6\">. 233 A.2d at 533. Pennsylvania practice requires a \u201ccontemporaneous objection\u201d at trial to preserve an issue for review. Commonwealth ex rel. Fox v. Maroney, 417 Pa. 308, 207 A.2d 810 (1965) ; Commonwealth ex rel. Mullenaux v. Myers, 421 Pa. 61, 217 A.2d 730 (1966).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b566-7\">. The state court\u2019s determination of waiver does not, of course, bar an independent determination by the federal courts because \u201cwaiver affecting federal rights is a federal question.\u201d Fay v. Noia, 372 U.S. 391, 439, 83 S.Ct. 822, 849, 9 L.Ed. 2d 837 (1963).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b566-9\">. 378 U.S. 368, 84 S.Ct. 1774, 12 L.Ed.2d 908 (1964).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"9\">\n<p id=\"b566-10\">. We are not unmindful that there is formidable authority for the proposition that failure to object to the admission of an allegedly coerced confession in a Pennsylvania court prior to the Supreme Court\u2019s decision in Jackson v. Denno, 378 U.S. 36S, 84 S.Ct. 1774 (1964) cannot be considered waiver \u201cas a matter of law.\u201d Dissenting on other grounds in the second <em>O-oelcley </em>case, Senior Circuit Judge John Biggs, Jr. advances this theory, suggesting that under Pennsylvania\u2019s <em>\u25a0pi'e-Jachson </em>procedures, \u201can objection to the admissibility of the statements would have been fruitless and perhaps even harmful to [the defendant\u2019s] case.\u201d U.S. ex rel. Gockley v. Myers, 411 F.2d 216 (3 Cir. 1969). In Smith v. Yeager, 393 U.S. 122, 89 S.Ct. 277, 21 L.Ed.2d 246 (1968), petitioner\u2019s counsel, prior to the landmark case of Townsend v. Sain, 372 U.S. 293, 83 S.Ct. 745, 9 L.Ed.2d 770 (1963), which substantially increased the availability of evidentiary hearings in habeas corpus proceedings, stated in open court that he did not think that an evi-dentiary hearing was necessary. Ruling that this did not constitute a waiver of such a right, the Court said: \u201cWhatever counsel\u2019s reasons for this obscure gesture of <em>noblesse oblige, </em>we cannot now examine the state of his mind or presume that he intentionally relinquished a known right or privilege, Johnson v. Zerbst, 304 U.S. 458, 464, 58 S.Ct. 1019, 82 L.Ed. 1461, when the right or privilege was of doubtful existence at the time of the supposed waiver.\u201d 393 U.S. at 126, 89 S.Ct. at 279.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"10\">\n<p id=\"b567-8\">.

In the first <em>dodkley </em>case,' <em>swpra, </em>there was a remand for an evidentiary hearing. In the second appeal, after the district court decided there had been no waiver, we were faced with the determination of whether the ultimate question of voluntariness was for the federal or state courts in the first instance.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
