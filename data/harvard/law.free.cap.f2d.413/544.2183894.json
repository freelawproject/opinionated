The judgment read:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b609-20\">\u201cThat plaintiffs have judgment against the defendants in the sum of $136,956.04, which amount may be paid and satisfied by defendants\u2019 delivery to plaintiffs [sic] bonafide notes secured by valid deeds of trust;\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b609-21\">and awarded $13,000.00 attorneys\u2019 fees to be paid in cash.</p>\n<p id=\"b609-22\">Appellees filed no brief and elected not to appear at the argument of this appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b609-23\">Where notes give to the promisor the kind of an election as shown by the note in this case, the promisor may not make the election after his default; rather, the promisee is entitled to payment in money. Texas &amp; Pac. Ry. Co. v. Marlor, 123 U.S. 687, 8 S.Ct. 311, 31 L.Ed. 303 (1887); Meissner v. Ogden, L. &amp; I. Ry. Co., 65 Utah 1, 233 P. 569 (1924).</p>\n<p id=\"b609-24\">The judgment is modified by striking from the judgment the following words, \u201cwhich amount may be paid and satisfied by defendants\u2019 delivery to plaintiffs bonafide notes secured by valid deeds of trust,\u201d so that the judgment will read:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b609-25\">\u201cThat plaintiffs have judgment against the defendants in the sum of $136,956.04.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b609-26\">Plaintiffs recovered $13,000.00 as attorneys\u2019 fees in the trial court. This appears to be ample compensation for their attorneys\u2019 and we reject their suggestion that we should award an additional amount for the services of their attorneys in connection with this appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b609-27\">As so modified, the judgment is affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
