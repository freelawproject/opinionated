The Superior Court of Gordon County, Georgia, issued an ex parte order restraining further strikes and work stoppages on the part of defendant-appellee.</p>\n<p id=\"b1029-12\">Thereafter, the defendant-appellee removed the suit to the United States District Court for the Northern District of Georgia and moved the federal court to dissolve the injunction and dismiss the suit. Plaintiff-appellant then moved to remand and later moved for a preliminary injunction against defendant-ap-pellee.</p>\n<p id=\"b1029-13\">Below the parties stipulated that the controversy involved was not one subject to arbitration under the collective bargaining agreement and that the applicable grievance procedure had been exhausted. The District Court denied the motion to remand, dismissed that count of the original petition relating to the alleged violation of state law, granted the motion to dissolve the state court injunction, denied the motion of appellant for a preliminary injunction and, finally, retained jurisdiction of that count of the original petition relating to the alleged breach of the collective bargaining agreement for such further orders as may be proper.</p>\n<p id=\"b1029-14\">Appellant seeks review of only two sections of the District Court\u2019s order, namely, the denial of appellant\u2019s motion for a preliminary injunction and the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"966\">*966</page-number>granting of appellee\u2019s motion to dissolve the state court injunction. We find no error in the Trial Judge\u2019s disposition of these motions and, accordingly, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b1030-4\">The refusal of the District Court to issue a preliminary injunction is clearly supported by the decision of the United States Supreme Court in Sinclair Refining Company v. Atkinson, 370 U.S. 195, 82 S.Ct. 1328, 8 L.Ed.2d 440 (1962). <em>Sinclair, </em>holds that the proscription of Section 4 of the Norris-LaGuardia Act,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> barring federal courts from issuing injunctions \u201cin any case involving or growing out of any labor dispute\u201d was not impliedly repealed by the later enactment of Section 301 of the Taft-Hartley Act<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> which gave federal courts jurisdiction of suits between employers and unions for breach of collective bargaining agreements. Thus, since the petition in this case seeks neither an order to compel arbitration<footnotemark>4</footnotemark>\n<footnotemark>5</footnotemark>nor a judgment enforcing the decree of an arbitrator,<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> <em>Sinclair </em>disposes completely of appellant\u2019s first assignment of error.</p>\n<p id=\"b1030-5\">Appellant also complains of the District Court\u2019s dissolution of the state court injunction. While it is not and, indeed, cannot<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> be disputed that the action was properly removed under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1441 as a case falling within the District Court\u2019s \u201coriginal jurisdiction\u201d and while it is, likewise, not disputed that the District Court has the power to dissolve state court injunctions on removal,<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> appellant, nonetheless, urges that the dissolution of the injunction was error in view of the fact that the Supreme Court in Avco Corporation v. Aero Lodge No. 735, International Association of Machinists and Aerospace Workers, 390 U.S. 557, 88 S.Ct. 1235, 20 L.Ed. 2d 126 (1968), reh. den. 391 U.S. 929, 88 S.Ct. 1801, 20 L.Ed.2d 670 (1968) did not specifically hold that such state court injunctions should be dissolved on removal.</p>\n<p id=\"b1030-15\">We are of the view that the District Court did not err in dissolving the injunction, not because either <em>Sinclair, </em>supra, or <em>Avco, </em>supra, explicitly dictates that result, but because, in our view, once this case was removed, a failure to dissolve the state court injunction would have been tantamount to issuance of that same injunction by the federal district court,<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> which, as we have just noted, would be proscribed by the Norris-LaGuardia Act under the <em>Sinclair </em>decision. Thus, we do not reach the question left unanswered in <em>Avco, </em>supra, i. e., whether or not the State Court could, itself, properly issue such an injunction or, stated in the terms of <em>Avco, </em>whether \u201cthe remedies available in State Courts are limited to the remedies available under Federal law.\u201d This question is not before us because the case was, in fact, removed and, having been removed as one falling within the District Court\u2019s original federal question, rather than diversity, jurisdiction, federal law is applicable.</p>\n<p id=\"b1030-16\">Affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1029-15\">.
