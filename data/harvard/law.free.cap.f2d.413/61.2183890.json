The defendant was arraigned on December 6, 1967, and a plea of guilty was entered to the charges in the indictment. At that time, the Government, pursuant to 26 U.S.C. \u00a7 7237(c) (2),<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> introduced a certified copy <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"62\">*62</page-number>of the defendant\u2019s previous conviction of a violation of the United States narcotics laws. This document recited a prior conviction based on the defendant\u2019s plea of guilty in 1956 before the United States District Court for the Southern District of Florida and the two-year sentence imposed by the court. Additionally, this document indicated on its face the fact that the defendant had been represented by counsel in the Florida proceeding. As a result of introduction of this prior conviction, the district judge was denied discretion to impose a five-year minimum sentence and the defendant was given the minimum mandatory ten-year sentence without parole.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b126-4\">The defendant moved to strike from the record the certified copy of his prior conviction on the ground that his plea was involuntarily entered in violation of the fifth amendment. In support of the motion the defendant filed his affidavit and a brief. The defendant also requested leave to obtain a transcript of the proceedings before the Florida district court and other evidence relevant to a determination of the voluntariness of his plea. A full hearing on the volun-tariness question was sought. On February 9, 1968, the district court heard oral argument and refused the defendant\u2019s request to strike the prior conviction from the record on the ground that the judge did not believe he had the authority or jurisdiction to grant the motion. It is this ruling of the district court which is before us upon appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b126-5\">From the defendant\u2019s uncontroverted affidavit and the transcript of the prior Florida proceedings, it appears that on March 16, 1956, the defendant appeared before the Honorable Emett C. Choate, United States District Judge, for the Southern District of Florida for arraignment on a two-count information that charged him with selling, dispensing and distributing a narcotic drug, and with purchasing and possessing a narcotic drug in violation of 26 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 4704 and 4704(a). Upon the court\u2019s determination that the defendant lacked funds to retain counsel, the court entered an order appointing counsel for him.</p>\n<p id=\"b126-8\">The defendant, by affidavit, states that he was not guilty of the Florida charge, although he admits being addicted to the use of narcotics during this period. He further avers that as a Spanish-speaking citizen he required the assistance of an interpreter at the 1956 Florida proceedings. As a result of this language barrier, the defendant spoke with his court-appointed attorney through an interpreter who spoke very poor Spanish. According to the defendant, his lawyer did not explain the law to him or advise him of his right to a jury trial. Initially, his lawyer advised the defendant to plead not guilty, but following a brief conference with some other individual, the lawyer returned and represented to the defendant that if he would plead guilty, he would receive treatment for his narcotic addiction. Although he still maintains his innocence, the defendant asserts that he pleaded guilty solely because he was undergoing withdrawal symptoms and was promised treatment. According to the defendant\u2019s affidavit, the trial judge did not question him concerning any promises or representations made to him in exchange for the plea of guilty as to one count of the information. Following his <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"63\">*63</page-number>plea of guilty and imposition of the two-year sentence, the defendant was transported to Lexington, Kentucky, for hospitalization and to serve his sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b127-4\">The appellant\u2019s argument is grounded on the premise that a constitutionally invalid prior conviction cannot be used to enhance a sentence imposed under 21 U. S.C. \u00a7 174. To support this position the appellant relies on the due process clause of the fifth amendment as recently interpreted by the Supreme Court in Bur-gett v. Texas, 389 U.S. 109, 88 S.Ct. 258, 19 L.Ed.2d 319 (1967). In that case the defendant was convicted by a jury of assault with intent to commit murder in a state court trial. A Texas habitual offender statute allowed the prosecution to introduce evidence of the defendant\u2019s four prior felony convictions. Among these was a certified copy of a Tennessee conviction which on its face raised a presumption that the defendant had been denied his right to counsel, and thus the prior conviction was void in light of Gideon v. Wainwright, 372 U.S. 335, 83 S.Ct. 792, 9 L.Ed.2d 799 (1963). In reversing his conviction, the Court stated the following principle:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b127-5\">To permit a conviction obtained in violation of Gideon v. Wainwright to be used against a person either to support guilt or enhance punishment for another offense * * * is to erode the principle of that case. Burgett v. Texas, 389 U.S. 109, 115, 88 S.Ct. 258, 19 L.Ed.2d 319 (1967).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b127-7\">We view the <em>Burgett </em>rationale, although involving a denial in the previous state court conviction of the sixth amendment right to counsel set forth in <em>Gideon, </em>as directly analogous to the instant facts. Here it is contended that the previous conviction was tainted by a denial of the defendant\u2019s fifth amendment right to due process as well as his right to the effective assistance of counsel provided by the sixth amendment. In both <em>Burgett </em>and the case before us, a prior conviction was utilized to enhance the defendant\u2019s punishment through invocation of an applicable mandatory subsequent offender provision that could not have been used but for the prior conviction. In both <em>Burgett </em>and the instant case, the prior conviction was alleged to have been obtained in vio-ation of a fundamental federal constitutional right.</p>\n<p id=\"b127-10\">The Government\u2019s position is that the <em>Burgett </em>rationale is inapplicable to the instant case because the constitutional invalidity discussed in <em>Burgett </em>appeared on the face of the record, whereas, here, no such defect appears. This argument admits the ^defendant\u2019s contention that the district court did have the power to strike from the record a constitutionally invalid prior conviction for purposes of sentencing a second offender. The Government admits that if absence of counsel at the prior proceeding were manifest on the face of the record, the district court could strike the prior proceeding from the present record. We are unable to accept the Government\u2019s proffered distinction between invalidity on the face and latent invalidity as a qualification on the district court\u2019s power to strike. If the district court has the power to strike invalid prior convictions, it is only fundamental that the same court with its inherent fact finding power and incidental power to conduct hearings can determine which prior convictions are invalid.</p>\n<p id=\"b127-11\">In our opinion the Government\u2019s contention that the district court lacked the power to strike the defendant\u2019s prior conviction from the record and to hold a hearing to determine the constitutional validity thereof must fall in light of <em>Burgett\u2019s' </em>rationale and the fundamental power of federal courts to establish rules of evidence and hold hearings incident to implementation of exclusionary rules. The application of exclusionary rules through court hearings has been repeatedly recognized and exercised. Weeks v. United States, 232 U.S. 383, 34 S.Ct. 341, 58 L.Ed. 652 (1914) (illegally seized evidence); McNabb v. United States, 318 U.S. 332, 63 S.Ct. 608, 87 L. Ed. 819 (1943) (statements of the accused); Alderman v. United States, 394 U.S. 165. 89 S.Ct. 961, 22 L.Ed.2d 176 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"64\">*64</page-number>(1969) (illegal electronic eavesdropping). The Government relies on Burton v. United States, 272 F.2d 473 (9th Cir.1959), cert. denied, 362 U.S. 951, 80 S.Ct. 863, 4 L.Ed.2d 869 (1960) to support its position that federal courts are not empowered to strike prior convictions. We view the <em>Burton </em>case in light of the Supreme Court\u2019s subsequent decision in <em>Burgett </em>to be necessarily limited to valid prior convictions. It is our conclusion that the district court has the power to conduct a hearing to ascertain the constitutional validity of a prior conviction which the Government attempts to introduce for the purpose of enhancing punishment.</p>\n<p id=\"b128-4\">The Government\u2019s alternative argument is that the defendant\u2019s affidavit failed to raise detailed facts sufficient to require the district court to hold a hearing to determine the constitutionality of the defendant\u2019s prior conviction. The Government relies principally on Machibroda v. United States, 368 U.S. 487, 82 S.Ct. 510, 7 L.Ed.2d 473 (1962) and Oliver v. United States, 398 F.2d 353 (9th Cir.1968) to support its position that the defendant\u2019s allegations were vague and conclusory. Our examination of <em>Machibroda </em>indicates that the defendant here was entitled to a hearing. In both cases the defendant\u2019s contention was that his plea had been coerced by a promise. A hearing was sought in each case on the basis of the defendant\u2019s affidavit alone. The affidavit here raises facts in sufficient detail to require a hearing to determine whether the defendant\u2019s plea was \u201cinduced by promises * * * which deprive it of the character of a voluntary act.\u201d Machibroda v. United States, 368 U.S. 487, 493, 82 S.Ct. 510, 513, 7 L.Ed.2d 473 (1962). We find that the specificity requirements of the <em>Oliver case are </em>likewise met by the Martinez affidavit.</p>\n<p id=\"b128-5\">The defendant has alleged that at the time he entered his plea of guilty he was under the influence of heroin and was suffering from withdrawal symptoms. On similar facts it has been held that a guilty plea based on a confession obtained while the defendant is suffering from withdrawal symptoms was not voluntary. United States ex rel. Collins v. Maroney, 287 F.Supp. 420 (E.D.Pa. 1968). The entry of a plea of guilty while under the influence of narcotics which is alleged in this case is potentially more substantial error, since \u201centry of a plea of guilty demands even more stringent safeguards than are required for confessions.\" United States ex rel. Codarre v. Gilligan, 363 F.2d 961, 966 (2d Cir.1966). For the same reasons, the allegation that the defendant was promised treatment for his addiction raises due process considerations.</p>\n<p id=\"b128-7\">The case is remanded for a hearing to determine the validity of the defendant\u2019s prior conviction.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b125-16\">. Section 7237 provides in part:</p>\n<p id=\"b125-17\">(2) Procedure. \u2014 After conviction (but before pronouncement of sentence) of any offense the penalty for which is provided in subsection (a) or (b) of this section, subsection (c) or (h) of section 2 of the Narcotic Drugs Import and Export Act, as amended, or such Act of July 11, 1941, as amended, the court shall be advised by the United States attorney whether the conviction is the offender\u2019s first or a subsequent offense. If it is not a first offense, the United States attorney shall file an information setting forth the prior convictions. The offender shall have the opportunity in open court to affirm or deny that he is identical with the person previously convicted. If he <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"62\">*62</page-number>denies the identity, sentence shall be postponed for such time as to permit a trial before a jury on the sole issue of the offender\u2019s identity with the person previously convicted. If the offender is found by the jury to be the person previously convicted, or if lie acknowledges that he is such person, he shall be sentenced as prescribed in subsection (a) or (b) of this section, subsection (c) or (li) of such section 2, or such Act of July 11, 1941, as amended, as the case may be.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b126-9\">. The ten-year minimum sentence is required by 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 174:</p>\n<p id=\"b126-10\">* * * For a second or subsequent offense (as determined under section 7237 (c) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1954), the offender shall he imprisoned not less than ten or more than forty years and, in addition, may be fined not more than $20,000.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"concurrence\">\n<author id=\"b128-8\">KERNER, Circuit Judge.</author>\n<p id=\"b128-9\">I concur in the fine opinion by my Brother Swygert. I only wish to express my regret over the law\u2019s failure to afford us a better remedy for the situation before us.</p>\n<p id=\"b128-10\">Where the alleged defect in a prior conviction is apparent from the face of the record and/or the transcript, there is no problem in having the local district court determine the validity of the prior conviction. However, where, as here, the alleged defect does not appear on the face of the record or transcript or where, also as here, the transcript has been destroyed in the ordinary course of court business, the problem becomes one which requires a full evidentiary hearing. It is then that it becomes regrettable that we are apparently without the power to transfer the case back to the district in which the trial was held to have such a hearing. This is especially true here where witnesses must be transported to Chicago from Florida. The Government\u2019s suggestion that Martinez proceed in Florida in <em>coram nobis </em>is impractical both because it would multiply the proceedings and because an indigent would not be required to be afforded counsel in such a proceeding.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
