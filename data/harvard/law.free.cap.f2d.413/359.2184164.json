Judgment was entered on the verdict. Brink\u2019s has appealed claiming error in the district court\u2019s instructing and re-instructing the jury.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b424-6\">For many years ADT has been a well-known supplier of electrical protection devices against burglars. Brink\u2019s has been similarly recognized as a protector and transporter of money and other valuables. From 1962 to 1966 Brink\u2019s also operated Brink\u2019s Signal Company, a business similar to ADT. It has also used ADT\u2019s service for many years in the United States and Canada.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b424-7\">At its office in Syracuse, New York, Brink\u2019s used ADT\u2019s central station system to protect its vault. In this system detection devices sensitive to sound or vibration are located inside the vault and are connected by a telephone wire to an ADT central station some distance away. When a detection device is activated, it transmits an alarm signal over the telephone wire to the central station where a watchman notifies police or sends an ADT patrol to the protected area. In addition, the station watchman periodically tests the entire system by sounding a horn in the vault activating the sensing device, which in turn sounds an alarm in the central station. This periodic testing device, which succeeded in frustrating an attempted burglary in Quebec City, Canada, was in use at Syracuse to assure proper operation of the system. In October, 1965, by use of an improved electronic device, burglars overcame the testing device and circumvented the Syracuse system so that no alarm signal was transmitted to the station. The burglars then, in four hours, using the same equipment used in Quebec City, fired 20mm armor-piercing shells through the 18\u201d reinforced concrete wall of Brink\u2019s\u2019 vault, entered and escaped with cash and checks totaling $250,000.</p>\n<p id=\"b424-14\">This suit followed, alleging ADT\u2019s deceit and misrepresentation in a statement relied on by Brink\u2019s to its damage, that the system installed at Syracuse was \u201cinvulnerable.\u201d Damages sought were the actual loss at Syracuse and Brink\u2019s\u2019 subsequent expense in providing additional protection to supplement ADT\u2019s central station.</p>\n<p id=\"b424-15\">In instructing the jury the court stated the substance of the issues, among others made by the pleadings: whether ADT had misrepresented that the device was invulnerable, and if so, whether as a reasonable and prudent man Brink\u2019s reasonably relied upon any alleged false representation. The court then gave Instruction #1,<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> challenged here by Brink\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"361\">*361</page-number>as reversibly erroneous. This instruction states the elements that must be proved by Brink\u2019s for recovery. Proposition 5 of the instruction, the prudent man test, was given over Brink\u2019s\u2019 objection and is challenged here. Brink\u2019s contends that that part of the instruction implies that if Brink\u2019s was negligent it cannot recover and that the implication violates Illinois law which governs here.</p>\n<p id=\"b425-4\">The authoritative rule is stated in Schmidt v. Landfield, 20 Ill.2d 89, 169 N.E.2d 229 (1960), that a defendant cannot interpose a defense of negligence on the part of the person to whom the false statement was made, but that the party seeking relief has to establish that he was justified in his reliance, especially where he had an opportunity to ascertain the truth and did not do so. This court in Harry Alter Co. v. Chrysler Corp., 285 F.2d 903 (7th Cir. 1961), does not state a different rule. In <em>Alter </em>this court, applying Illinois law, stated that</p>\n<p id=\"b425-5\">[I]t was incumbent upon plaintiff to prove by a preponderance of the evidence that a false representation was made as to some material fact, that the defendant know (sic) of the falsity and intended that plaintiff should rely upon the representation, that plaintiff, <em>in ignorance of the falsity thereof, </em>did rely upon the false representation, and that damage to the plaintiff resulted from its reliance thereon. Id. at 906. (Emphasis added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b425-6\">To prove ignorance of a false statement, a plaintiff must objectively show that he acted as a man of ordinary prudence in relying upon the statement\u2019s credibility.</p>\n<p id=\"b425-15\">We have read the Illinois cases cited by Brink\u2019s and ADT on the validity of the challenged instruction here. They vary in expression, but in substance state the same governing rule: Roda v. Berko, 401 Ill. 335, 340, 81 N.E.2d 912, 914 (1948) (\u201cmust reasonably believe it to be true\u201d); Pustelniak v. Vilimas, 352 Ill. 270, 276, 185 N.E. 611, 614 (1933). (\u201cor [the absence] of any facts which should arouse doubt or suspicion,\u201d (emphasis added) in which events the person was not bound to make inquiries for himself); Endsley v. Johns, 120 Ill. 469, 480, 12 N.E. 247, 251 (1887) (\u201cwithout knowledge of the falsehood, or the present opportunity or ability of verification, and under circumstances justifying belief * * <em>*.\u201d); </em>Schwabacker v. Riddle, 99 Ill. 343, 346 (1881) (\u201cordinary prudence\u201d); Broberg v. Mann, 66 Ill.App.2d 134, 213 N.E.2d 89 (1965) (relied on with the right to do so); Tate v. Jackson, 22 Ill.App.2d 471, 161 N.E.2d 156 (1959) (citing Endsley).</p>\n<p id=\"b425-16\">In Citizens Savings and Loan Ass\u2019n v. Fischer, 67 Ill.App.2d 315, 214 N.E.2d 612 (1966), the court did state that a party cannot escape the legal consequences of his fraudulent conduct by saying that the fraud might have been discovered if the party whom he deceived exercised reasonable care. But the court also stated <em>\u201c[ijn the absence of circumstances putting a reasonable person on inquiry, </em>a person is justified in relying on a misrepresentation of a material fact without <em>making further </em>inquiry.\u201d (Emphasis added.) We hold <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"362\">*362</page-number>there is no merit in the contention that Instruction #1 is erroneous.</p>\n<p id=\"b426-4\">Brink\u2019s also claims error in the giving of Instruction #6 <footnotemark>5</footnotemark> which told the jury in effect that fraud was never presumed, but must be proved by Brink\u2019s, that all dealings were presumptively free of intent to defraud and that as between two equally capable constructions of a transaction the law presumes that the transaction is honest and not dishonest. Brink\u2019s claims the instruction misstated Illinois law, contrary to the decisions of Endsley v. Johns, 120 Ill. 469, 12 N.E. 247 (1887), and John V. Farwell Co. v. Nathanson, 99 Ill.App. 185 (1900).</p>\n<p id=\"b426-5\">Neither of those cases supports Brink\u2019s\u2019 claim. In Farwell it is not clear that the \u201cfifth\u201d instruction was condemned because of a statement that the law \u201calways * * * preferred\u201d an honest to a dishonest motive where either was justified. In Endsley the \u201csixth\u201d instruction discussed was not similar to Instruction #6 before us. We think that the instruction challenged here correctly states Illinois law. Racine Fuel Co. v. Rawlins, 377 Ill. 375, 36 N.E.2d 710 (1941).</p>\n<p id=\"b426-6\">Finally, Brink\u2019s claims error in the court\u2019s re-instructing the jury. The morning after the case went to the jury, the district court considered two questions the jury had sent to the court the previous evening: (1) \u201cIs misrepresentation the same as fraud in this case?\u201d and (2) \u201cIf so, can the word \u2018fraud\u2019 be changed to \u2018misrepresentation\u2019?\u201d In a colloquy with counsel for Brink\u2019s and ADT, the court said arguments of counsel to the jury \u201cmust have misled the jury,\u201d but proposed not to directly answer the questions. The court upon examining the instructions said that #6 had \u201cmixed up the jury\u201d and that ADT should not have given it to him. Brink\u2019s\u2019 counsel suggested only adding an instruction that omissions could be construed as misrepresentations.</p>\n<p id=\"b426-10\">The court re-read Brink\u2019s\u2019 burden of proof instructions, the proximate cause instruction which used the term \u201cfraudulent misrepresentations\u201d four times, an instruction that omissions could be considered misrepresentations, another that a party has a duty to use reasonable care to disclose information, and ended by re-reading Instruction #6.</p>\n<p id=\"b426-11\">Brink\u2019s argues that merely re-reading #6 which had \u201cmixed up\u201d the jury was erroneous because it did not clear up the confusion. It relies upon this court\u2019s decision in United States v. Harris, 388 F.2d 373 (7th Cir. 1967), and Powell v. United States, 347 F.2d 156 (9th Cir. 1965), cited by this court in <em>Harris, </em>to sustain its claim of error in re-instructing the jury. Both <em>Harris </em>and <em>Powell </em>are criminal cases. <em>Harris </em>involved a thirteen count indictment charging four defendants with substantive and conspiracy offenses. The reading of instructions there consumed three hours and ended at 11:00 p.m. The next day the jury stated the reading of instructions was so rapid it did not understand some, and that the jurors were not clear about what findings they could make in the various counts. This court thought the original instructions were insufficient, and that re-reading of them did not meet the test announced in <em>Powell. </em>Quoting from Bollenbach v. United States, 326 U.S. 607, 613, 66 S.Ct. 402, 90 L.Ed. 350 (1946), the court in <em>Powell </em>required the judge to have cleared away with \u201cconcrete accuracy\u201d a jury\u2019s difficulties. It held this test had' not been satisfied by a re-reading of a prior instruction on evidence of intent, because the instruction was unresponsive to the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"363\">*363</page-number>jury\u2019s questions, and may have led the jury to apply an improper standard.</p>\n<p id=\"b427-4\">Brink\u2019s argues that, as the court thought in <em>Powell, </em>the re-instruction induced the jury here to apply an improper standard of proof. The district court however re-read the burden of proof instruction and it is unlikely that the jury did not apply that standard. Since we have held Instruction !#6 to be a correct statement of the law, a re-reading of it could not have misled the jury.</p>\n<p id=\"b427-5\">Moreover, Brink\u2019s did not move or request to withdraw Instruction i#6. It did not object, specifically, to a re-reading of Instruction #6, which might have led the district court to reconsider its method of removing the jury\u2019s confusion. Brink\u2019s entered nothing more than a \u201cperfunctory objection.\u201d The \u201cconcrete accuracy\u201d test stated in Bollenbach v. United States, 326 U.S. 607, 66 S.Ct. 402, 90 L.Ed. 350 (1946), a criminal case, if urged by Brink\u2019s at the trial, might have led to an unobjectionable response to the jury\u2019s question. We think it is too late now.</p>\n<p id=\"b427-7\">The judgment is affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b424-9\">. This was the posture of the case when submitted to the jury. Both parties amended original pleadings. The court denied ADT\u2019s motions for directed verdicts after plaintiff rested and after both sides rested.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b424-10\">. ADT has cross-appealed from a denial of its motion for a directed verdict. Pri- or to oral argument, Brink\u2019s filed a motion to dismiss the cross-appeal. On July 12, 1968, this court ordered that Brink\u2019s\u2019 motion be taken with the case. In view of our decision sustaining the judgment entered on the jury verdict, we need not decide the cross-appeal or Brink\u2019s\u2019 motion. Both are now moot.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b424-18\">.
