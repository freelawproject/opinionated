In Count One of the seventeen-count indictment, Garber is charged, along with nine other co-defendants and several persons named as co-conspirators but not as defendants, with a conspiracy to commit fraud in the sale and purchase of stock, in violation of the Securities Act of 1933, 15 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 77q(a) and 77x. Specifically, Count One charges that as part of the conspiracy, appellant would buy and sell Donbar Development Corporation (Donbar) stock through nominee accounts for the purpose of rigging their market price. Additionally, in the same count it is charged that Garber sold Donbar stock through his brokerage firm, Nassau Securities Service, without revealing that the stock was being manipulated and that secret compensation was being paid to securities salesmen. Appellant was not named in the other sixteen counts which charged five defendants with substantive violations of 15 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 77q (a) and 77x.</p>\n<p id=\"b349-8\">Appellant contends that the indictment should have been dismissed (1) because his privilege against self-incrimination was violated by an order of the District Court which required him to turn over to the Grand Jury records of his former brokerage firm, (2) because the indictment was unconstitutionally vague, and (3) because the Grand Jury was not properly selected in that it did not represent a cross-section of the community.</p>\n<p id=\"b349-9\">The denial of a motion to dismiss an indictment is not appealable under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291 and \u00a7 1292, because such a denial is not a final \u201cdecision\u201d or \u201cjudgment.\u201d See Snodgrass v. United States, 326 F.2d 409 (8th Cir. 1964); Yeloushan v. United States, 313 F.2d 303 (5th Cir.), cert. denied, 373 U.S. 912, 83 S.Ct. 1301, 10 L.Ed.2d 413 (1963); United States v. Foster, 278 F.2d 567 (2d Cir. 1960); United States v. Golden, 239 F.2d 877 (2d Cir. 1956); Chereton v. United States, 256 F.2d 576 (6th Cir. 1958); Atlantic Fishermen\u2019s Union v. United States, 197 F.2d 519 (1st Cir. 1952).</p>\n<p id=\"b349-12\"> As the Supreme Court stated in Parr v. United States, 351 U.S. 513, 518, 76 S.Ct. 912, 916, 100 L.Ed. 1377 (1956):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b349-13\">\u201c * * * In general, a \u2018judgment\u2019 or \u2018decision\u2019 is final for the purpose of appeal only \u2018when it terminates the litigation between the parties on the merits of the case, and leaves nothing to be done but to enforce by execution what has been determined.\u2019</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b349-14\">\u201c * * * \u2018Final judgment in a criminal case means sentence. The sentence is the judgment.\u2019 * * * \u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b349-15\">Thus, the appeal of the denial of this motion must be dismissed.</p>\n<p id=\"b349-16\">Garber also seeks to have this court review the denial of his motion for severance and change in venue. An order denying motions for severance and change in venue is also not appealable before trial. See United States v. Brown, 301 F.2d 664 (4th Cir. 1962); Holdsworth v. United States, 179 F.2d 933 (1st Cir. 1950). Although it may be reviewable by way of writ of mandamus, a strong showing of prejudice must be made since motions for severance and change in venue are addressed to the discretion of the trial judge. Application of Gottesman, 332 F.2d 975, 976 (2d Cir. 1964). Even treating appellant\u2019s <em>pro se </em>appeal as an application for a writ of mandamus, appellant has not shown a \u201cclear abuse\u201d of discretion which would warrant interference with the trial judge\u2019s determination. Bankers Life &amp; Casualty Co. v. Holland, 346 U.S. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"286\">*286</page-number>379, 383, 74 S.Ct. 145, 98 L.Ed. 106 (1953).</p>\n<p id=\"b350-4\">Furthermore, Judge Cooper denied ap-pellant\u2019s motion for a separate trial \u201cwithout prejudice to renewal at or near the time of trial.\u201d The denial of his motion for severance was, therefore, not final or conclusive. The trial court specifically left the matter open for further consideration prior to trial if facts, later \u2022developed or explained, indicated that a separate trial was required.</p>\n<p id=\"b350-5\">The appellant has made the unsupported allegation that \u201cthe newspapers in this district already tried the case.\u201d The trial judge acted well within his discretion in rejecting this claim because it was unsubstantiated and because there was no showing that there was a \u201creasonable likelihood that prejudicial news prior to trial will prevent a fair trial.\u201d Sheppard v. Maxwell, 384 U.S. 333, 363, 86 S.Ct. 1507, 1522, 16 L.Ed.2d 600 (1966).</p>\n<p id=\"b350-6\">The appeal as to the denial of appellant\u2019s motion for change in venue and severance is also dismissed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
