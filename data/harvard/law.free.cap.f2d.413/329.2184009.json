App. \u00a7 462 for wilfully refusing induction into the Armed Forces of the United States. Defendant\u2019s main contention is that his order to report for induction was void by reason of the local draft board\u2019s refusal to reopen his I-A classification and cancel his induction order at a time when he had furnished the board evidence that he was \u201csatisfactorily pursuing a full-time course of instruction\u201d as an undergraduate at Iowa State University.</p>\n<p id=\"b394-11\">The district court found no prejudicial error by reason of the board\u2019s failure to reopen the defendant\u2019s classification because his school quarter would have ended in a few days and his status would then have had to be changed. The district court also found that the defendant failed to cooperate with the local board by furnishing additional information concerning his schooling and that the defendant further voluntarily terminated his school studies after the spring quarter. Under these circumstances, the district court held that the defendant had not been prejudiced. We reverse.</p>\n<p id=\"b394-13\">The board must function according to statutory requirements and the administrative regulations governing its procedure. Simmons v. United States, 348 U.S. 397, 75 S.Ct. 397, 99 L.Ed. 453 (1955). Congress has provided:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b394-14\">\u201cAny person who while satisfactorily pursuing a full-time course of instruction at a college, university, or similar institution is ordered to report for induction under this title, shall, upon the facts being presented to the local board, be deferred (A) until the end of such academic year, or (B) until he ceases satisfactorily to pursue such course of instruction, whichever is the earlier * * 50 U.S.C. App. \u00a7 456 (i) (2).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b394-16\">See also 32 C.F.R. \u00a7 1622.15(b). Under the Selective Service Regulations it is <em>mandatory </em>for the board to \u201creopen and consider anew the classification of a registrant to whom it has mailed an Order to Report for Induction * * * whenever facts are presented to the local board which establish the registrant\u2019s eligibility for classification into Class I-S because he is satisfactorily pursuing a full-time course of instruction at a college, university, or similar institution of learning.\u201d 32 C.F.R. \u00a7 1625.3(b). Under 32 C.F.R. \u00a7 1625.14, when the board <em>reopens </em>a classification, it must cancel any pending order to report for induction.</p>\n<p id=\"b394-18\">On January 11, 1967, the draft board reclassified Rundle as I-A(3) (available for military service) from a II-S (student deferment) because the board had been notified by the University that Rundle was no longer in school. On January 25, Rundle reported that he was still registered in school. On February 13, 1967, the board received notice from the University by Form 109 stating Rundle was a full-time student. This was sufficient request and notice to cause a reclassification of Rundle from I-A to II-S. 32 C.F.R. \u00a7 1622.25. John <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"331\">*331</page-number>Rundle had first enrolled at the University in September of 1963. Subsequently he had been reclassified four different times to a II-S through use of the Form 109 certifying Rundle was satisfactorily pursuing his course of instruction. Although the specific facts are not clear, Rundle had frequently been delinquent in his tuition payments for various reasons and this had caused a breakdown in the University\u2019s timely certification of his active pursuit of study. In each instance these had been corrected, certification had been made and the board\u2019s change of classification from I-A(3) to II-S had been accomplished. However, notwithstanding the certification by the University on February 13, 1967, the board did not reclassify him II-S.</p>\n<p id=\"b395-5\">On April 4, 1967, the board received another Form 109, again saying Rundle was no longer enrolled. However, the board did not investigate further, because of their prior classification of I-A, pending since January 11, 1967. On May 5, 1967, Rundle received his notice to report for induction on June 28, 1967. On May 8, 1967, Rundle informed the board he was still in school and that because of sickness he had not paid his tuition on time but was attending classes. The board informed him that it would be necessary to have the University certify that he was properly enrolled and they would then recommend a <em>postponement </em>of induction.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> He told the board he would graduate in August of 1967. He also informed the board he was going into the Peace Corps in September.</p>\n<p id=\"b395-6\">Significantly, Rundle\u2019s Selective Service file then shows a call by the board\u2019s secretary to the Registrar\u2019s office dated May 9,1967. The file relates:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b395-7\">\u201cPer telecon Mrs. Springer, Registrar\u2019s ofc., ISU, registrant did not pay his spring qtr. fees until 5 May. Deadline for paying fees was March 8. She says he registered for 12-hrs. &amp; claimed that he has been attending classes even tho he was not registered &amp; had not paid fees. <em>She stated </em>that she had left word at his home for him to return to their office for further info &amp; <em>that she would not send a SSS 109 until his situation there is cleared up. Said it will have to be determined if he has been attending classes &amp; if he will get full academic credits for this quarter.\u201d </em>(Emphasis ours.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b395-12\">On May 12, three days after this call, the University notified the board by Form 109 that Rundle was a full-time student. We conclude that at least in the circumstances of this case, the University\u2019s certification was sufficient to establish under 32 C.F.R. \u00a7 1625.3(b) that Rundle was in fact \u201csatisfactorily pursuing\u201d his schooling. United States ex rel. Berman v. Craig, 207 F.2d 888 (3 Cir.1953). As the government concedes in its brief:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b395-13\">\u201cSome local boards would have no communication with the college administration and perhaps while a Form 109 is not the ultimate in proof of \u2018satisfactorily pursuing,\u2019 it would certainly be reasonable to use it as some evidence of satisfactory enrollment.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b395-14\">More significantly, there is no dispute that Rundle was in fact attending school and was in fact eligible under \u00a7 1625.-3(b) for a I-S deferment at that time.</p>\n<p id=\"b395-15\">On June 9, the board attempted to get further information from the registrant as to his credit hours then completed, the expected date of his graduation, and a verification of his enrollment in the summer session. On June 19, the board called the University and ascertained that Rundle was no longer enrolled and had not authorized the University to release any further information as to his credits. Such investigative procedures <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"332\">*332</page-number>were within the prerogative of the board and certainly, the board was in good faith in attempting to verify this information.</p>\n<p id=\"b396-4\">However, in view of the fact that the evidence conclusively shows that at the time Rundle received his induction order in May, he was pursuing his education and upon certification of that fact to the board under 32 C.F.R. \u00a7 1622.15(b) and the statute 50 U.S.C. App. \u00a7 456(i) (2)<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> the board was nonetheless required to <em>reopen </em>and <em>reconsider </em>his I-A classification and cancel his induction order. 32 C.F.R. \u00a7 1625.14. See United States ex rel. Berman v. Craig, 207 F.2d at 890 (3 Cir.1953). To hold otherwise would be to permit a board to disregard a mandatory duty to reopen by simply delaying consideration until the registrant\u2019s status has changed sufficiently so that he is no longer entitied to the requested reclassification. Indeed, a board\u2019s delay might in itself cause a change in a registrant\u2019s status. The local board\u2019s delay, coupled with both its evident reluctance to grant a I-S classification and the outstanding induction order might well have caused Rundle to conclude that registration for summer school was a futile act. For the same reason, Rundle\u2019s subsequent withdrawal of his request for a I-S deferment on June 23 and his application then to be considered for a I-A-0 status cannot affect the board\u2019s mandatory duty under the regulations to reopen and consider anew his classification.</p>\n<p id=\"b396-15\">The reopening and reconsideration of a classification have significance independent of the reclassification itself. This was recognized in Miller v. United States, 388 F.2d 973 (9 Cir.1967), where Senior Circuit Judge Harvey Johnsen <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"333\">*333</page-number>held that the local board had erred in refusing to reopen a classification when it had \u201cshortcut the situation, without purporting to reopen,\u201d by proceeding directly to a consideration on the merits of the probative elements in the registrant\u2019s file. Noting that the board had thereby eliminated the registrant\u2019s rights to appear personally and to appeal, Judge Johnsen stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b397-4\">\u201cFor a local board to be able to effect a discrimination of such substance * * * would seem to us to constitute a matter of basic unfairness and hence to be,- in the language of Bolling v. Sharpe, 347 U.S. 497, 499, 74 S.Ct. 693, 694, 98 L.Ed. 884, and Schneider v. Rusk, 377 U.S. 163, 168, 84 S.Ct. 1187, 1190, 12 L.Ed.2d 218, \u2018so unjustifiable as to be violative of due process.\u2019 \u201d Id. at 976-977.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b397-6\">Failure to follow administrative procedures for reopening classification has been consistently held to be a violation of due process. Davis v. United States, 410 F.2d 89 (8 Cir. 1969); United States v. Freeman, 388 F.2d 246 (7 Cir.1967); Miller v. United States, 388 F.2d 973 (9 Cir.1967); Olvera v. United States, 223 F.2d 880 (5 Cir.1955). The argument that Rundle was not \u201cprejudiced\u201d by the failure to do so is unavailing. The evidence of prejudice is conclusive here.</p>\n<p id=\"b397-8\">First, at the time of May 12, 1967, Rundle wanted to finish his education and obtain his degree. He anticipated graduating in August of 1967. Since his course of study had commenced in September, his \u201cacademic year\u201d would properly extend to September of 1967 which would have allowed Rundle time to complete his credits to graduate, and not just until the end of May as the trial court reasoned. This definition is now established by administrative regulation :</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b397-12\">\u201cIn determining eligibility for deferment in Class II-S, a student\u2019s \u2018academic year\u2019 shall include the 12-month period following the beginning of his course of study.\u201d 32 C.F.R. \u00a7 1622.-25(b) (effective July 1967).<footnotemark>2a</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b397-13\">Secondly, by refusing to reopen Rundle\u2019s classification under \u00a7 1625.3(b), he has been deprived of his right to a personal appearance before the board (32 C.F.R. \u00a7 1624.1) and the right to appeal to the state board (32 C.F.R. \u00a7 1626.2). As the Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit noted in United States v. Vincelli, 215 F.2d 210, 213 (2 Cir.1954):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b397-14\">\u201cThese are substantial rights and the board\u2019s procedure in this instance by depriving appellant of them, was a denial of due process. * *</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b397-15\">See also Miller v. United States, 388 F. 2d 973 (9 Cir.1967); Stain v. United States, 235 F.2d 339 (9 Cir.1956); United States ex rel. Berman v. Craig, 207 F.2d 888 (3 Cir.1953).</p>\n<p id=\"b397-16\">Finally, if the board had reopened his classification, his order of induction would have been cancelled. 32 C.F.R. \u00a7 1625.14. Five days before Rundle was to report for induction he applied for a I-A-0 classification. In such circumstances his burden to obtain a reopening for consideration to qualify as a I-A-0 would have been significantly less where no valid induction order was outstanding. He would only have had to make a prima facie showing of such a change in status. 32 C.F.R. \u00a7 1625.2. See Vaughn v. United States, 404 F.2d 586 (8 Cir. 1968). However, after an induction or<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"334\">*334</page-number>der has been issued and not otherwise cancelled, his burden to obtain a change in classification concededly is much greater, since he must then show \u201ccircumstances over which [he] ha'd no control.\u201d 32 C.F.R. \u00a7 1625.2(b). See Davis v. United States, supra.</p>\n<p id=\"b398-4\">Denial of procedural and substantive rights cannot be justified by subsequent events. Cf. United States v. Freeman, 388 F.2d 246, 250 (7 Cir.1967.) Had these rights \u2014 the reopening of his classification and the attendant cancellation of his induction order \u2014 been afforded the registrant, no one can predict what subsequent events might have turned out to be. However, we need not theorize about such possible events, for as stated in United States v. Simmons, 348 U.S. 397 at 406, 75 S.Ct. 397 at 402, 99 L.Ed. 453.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b398-5\">\u201cPetitioner has been deprived of * * * a fundamental safeguard, and he need not specify the precise manner in which he would have used this right \u2014 and how such use would have aided his cause \u2014 in order to complain of the deprivation.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b398-7\">The defendant also alleges that he was denied due process by the board\u2019s failure to meet formally and consider his application for a I-A-0 classification. The board rejected Rundle\u2019s I-A-0 application as not timely filed, without a meeting, by telephone vote, since Rundle\u2019s induction order had already been issued. We do not need to pass upon the board\u2019s action here in view of our reversal on other grounds.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> However, the true significance of this rejection is that if the induction order had been properly recalled by reason of the I-S reclassification in May, at a time Rundle was clearly entitled to it, it is conceded the board would properly have had to consider by formal meeting and quorum vote whether the defendant had made a prima facie showing for a I-A-0 status. 32 C.F.R. \u00a7\u00a7 1604.52a(d) and 1625.2. See United States v. Walsh, 279 F.Supp. 115 (D. Mass.1968).</p>\n<p id=\"b398-12\">Judgment reversed, with directions to enter a verdict of acquittal.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b395-8\">. A postponement of induction would also fail to meet the requirements of 32 C.F.R. \u00a7\u00a7 1625.3(b) and 1625.14. There is a substantial difference between cancellation of induction as required by these sections and mere postponement of induction. See Davis v. United States, 410 F.2d 89, (8 Cir. 1969).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b396-5\">. In Ellis v. Hershey, 302 F.Supp. 347 (E.D.Mich. April 30, 1969), second year law students brought a class action seeking injunctive relief from the board\u2019s refusal to grant them I-S deferments under \u00a7 456 (i) (2). Judge Kaess granted the injunction and wrote:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b396-7\">\u201cSeveral of the plaintiffs have passed their pre-induction physical examinations and have been called for induction. They have requested I-S deferments, which requests have been denied. These plaintiffs claim an immediate right to such deferments. The other plaintiffs, comprising the remainder of the class, are not so far along in the induction process, but are allegedly being injured in their ability to properly plan and pursue their academic careers by the Selective Service System\u2019s refusal to recognize their right to I-S deferments should they be called for induction during the academic year.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b396-8\">\u201cAll of the plaintiffs have exhausted their administrative remedies within the Selective Service System on this issue.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b396-9\">* * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b396-10\">* * * * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b396-11\">\u201cSection 456 (i) (2) contains the phrase \u2018shall * * * be deferred.\u2019 Webster\u2019s New Collegiate Dictionary defines the word \u2018shall\u2019 as meaning <em>obliged, must. </em>The phrase employed by Congress in subsection (i) (2) is mandatory in meaning. This court, or any court, would be stretching the intent and purpose of Congress in construing Section 456 (i) (2) differently. Section 456 (i) (2) of the Act in clear and unequivocal terms mandates the deferment until the end of the academic year of plaintiffs and those similarly situated when they are called for induction, so long as they remain full-time students.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b396-17\">* * * \u2756 *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b396-18\">\u201c * * * The language of a statute is the best and most reliable index of its meaning and where the language is clear and unequivocal it is determinative of its construction. Monte Vista Lodge v. Guardian Life Ins. Co. of America (C.A. 9, 1967), 384 F.2d 126, cert. den. 390 U.S. 950, 88 S.Ct. 1041, 19 L.Ed.2d 1142.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b396-21\">\u201cThe court\u2019s construction of Section 456, subsection (h) (1), (h) (2) and (i) (2) follows directly from the statute\u2019s clear unequivocal language. No ambiguity exists in the statutory language and there is no conflict between the respective sections.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b396-22\">sjs j\u00a1: :J; <em>% </em>#</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b396-23\">\u201cTherefore, since plaintiffs have a clear statutory right to an I-S deferment, not subject to Local Board discretion, the court finds that Section 460 (b) (3) of the Act is not a bar to its jurisdiction. Plaintiffs have a clear and unequivocal right to a statutory I-S classification until the end of the academic year, June 1969.\u201d</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2a\">\n<p id=\"b397-9\">. Under | 1622.25 a student who completes his requirements for his bachelor degree will, of course, lose his II-S deferment as an undergraduate. The definition of a twelve month \u201cacademic year\u201d is provided as a supplement to \u00a7 1622.25 (c) which allows a student to pursue a four-year course of study by earning 25% of the credits required for his degree each year. Thus, a student who attends school for the regular nine-month school year is still eligible for the deferment, although he might work during the summer and not actually attend classes until the start of his next fall semester.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b398-8\">. The courts of appeals have divided on the issue of whether an application for conscientious objector classification filed after an induction order has issued can be rejected summarily on the ground that reclassification under 32 C.F.R. \u00a7 1625.2 (b) requires \u201ca change of circumstances over which the registrant has no control.\u201d One view is that a belated claimed status of conscientious objector does not qualify. United States v. Jennison, 402 F.2d 51 (6 Cir. 1968); Davis v. United States, 374 F.2d 1 (5 Cir. 1967); United States v. Al-Majied Muhammad, 364 F.2d 223 (4th Cir. 1966); United States v. Schoebel, 201 F.2d 31 (7 Cir. 1953). The Second and Tenth Circuits and a divided panel of the Ninth follow what has been called the \u201ccrystallization\u201d theory and require the board nevertheless to give formal consideration to reopening the classification. United States v. Gearey, 368 F.2d 144 (2 Cir. 1966); Keene v. United States, 266 F.2d 378 (10 Cir. 1959); Ehlert v. United States, 416 F.2d 1012 (9 Cir. 1968) (en banc rehearing pending decision). Cf. Boswell v. United States, 390 F.2d 181 (9 Cir. 1968) . This Circuit has not directly decided the question. However, see, Davis v. United States, 410 F.2d 89 (8 Cir. 1969) , where we said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b398-19\">\u201cUndoubtedly, where a registrant presents a claim for conscientious objector status when his induction is imminent and when he has already been deferred for other reasons, the board is likely to view his claim and motives with considerable suspicion. Xet moral and religious values are subject to change, particularly as a young man reaches and enters maturity. There is little likelihood that such a person can be afforded a fair hearing without being allowed to personally present his claim.\u201d Id. at 94.</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"concurrence\">\n<author id=\"b398-13\">BLACKMUN, Circuit Judge</author>\n<p id=\"ACp\">(concurring).</p>\n<p id=\"b398-14\">I am not convinced that this registrant is not justly to be suspected of abusing the registration process.

Rundle will then be able to present whatever case he may feel he possesses and the process will begin all over again, with a conclusion not known at this time.</p>\n<p id=\"b399-5\">Until we have some definitive authority to that effect, I do not join Judge Lay in his apparent observation that because a student originally matriculates in one September his fourth and final \u201cacademic year,\u201d ordinarily expected to end in the fourth spring after the original September matriculation, nevertheless must necessarily extend to another September. I would have thought that the normal spring graduation was a conclusion, or a beginning of something new, and that that is what \u201cCommencement\u201d is all about. I suspect many young men, who graduate on one day and who then, soon, are on their way to basic training, would be surprised to discover that their academic year persists. It is interesting to note that a district judge\u2019s opinion, which Judge Lay quotes at length in his second footnote, pinpoints a June graduation as the end of the fourth academic year.</p>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-3\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b399-6\">MEHAFFY, Circuit Judge</author>\n<p id=\"A9O\">(dissenting).</p>\n<p id=\"b399-7\">I would affirm the judgment of conviction based primarily on the facts as summarized and the reasoning of the district court in its memorandum opinion.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
