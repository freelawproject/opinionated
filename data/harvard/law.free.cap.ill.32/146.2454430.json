Wallace, for an alleged breach of warranty of the soundness of a horse. A trial before the justice resulted in a judgment in favor of Wren, the plaintiff, from which Wallace took an appeal to the Superior Court of Chicago. Upon the trial in that court it appeared that a son of Wren exchanged horses with an agent of Wallace. On the question of warranty, the party making the trade on the part of the plaintiff, testified positively that the horse which he obtained in the exchange was warranted by the agent of Wallace to be sound. The latter testified, on the contrary, that he made no such warranty, but simply stated that the horse was sound so far as he knew. The testimony in regard to the unsoundness of the horse was conflicting, but preponderated in favor of the plaintiff, tending to show that the horse had the glanders, which, it was proven, was a contagious disease. The plaintiff was permitted to prove, against the objection of the defendant, that a mule which was being worked with the diseased horse took the disease, of which it died.</summary><summary data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b147-7\" pgmap=\"147\">The court below laid down the rule in regard to the measure of damages, in the following instructions, asked by the plain'tiff: \u2022</summary><summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b147-8\" pgmap=\"147\">\u201c If, at the time the trade was made, the defendant, or the agent of the -defendant, acting by the authority of the defendant, warranted the horse that the plaintiff got to be sound, when the horse was unsomid at the time of such warranty, then the plaintiff is entitled to recover, and the measure of damages should be the difference between the value of the horse as he then was, and what his value would have been if he had been sound.</summary><summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b147-9\" pgmap=\"147\">To the giving of this instruction the defendant excepted.</summary><summary data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b148-4\" pgmap=\"148\">The court, at the request of the defendant, gave to the jury the following instructions, numbered 1, 2, and 3:</summary><summary data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b148-5\" pgmap=\"148\">1. That on the sale of an article of personal property, no action can be maintained for any difference in quality between the thing contracted for and the thing delivered, unless there be an express warranty made by the seller, or there be fraud on his part.

The measure of damages in an action on a breach of warranty on the sale of personal property, is the difference between the price paid and the actual value of the property at the time and place of delivery, with all its defects and vices.

The evidence in reference to the mule becoming affected with glanders was proper, as tending to show the horse with which it worked had that disease.</p> <opinion data-order=\"31\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\"> <author id=\"b150-4\" pgmap=\"150\">Mr. Chief Justice Caton</author> <p id=\"AhK\" pgmap=\"150\">delivered the opinion of the Court:</p> <p id=\"b150-5\" pgmap=\"150\">This was an action for a breach of warranty of a horse. As to the fact of a warranty the testimony is conflicting; one witness swearing positively to a warranty, and another swearing just as positively that there was no warranty. So, too, upon the question of unsoundness, the testimony is conflicting, though, we think, the clear preponderance of the evidence is in favor of the plaintiff, on this point. In this state of the evidence we cannot disturb the verdict. It was for the jury to determine as to the credibility of the conflicting witnesses. For the purpose of showing that the horse had the glanders, the court permitted the plaintiff to show that a mule which worked with the horse took that disease, of which he died. We see no error in this. There was proof that glanders is contagious, and if that be so, then the proof was undoubtedly pertinent and proper.</p> <p id=\"b150-6\" pgmap=\"150\">The court properly refused to instruct the jury as to what would constitute a fraud in the sale of a horse. The action was on a warranty, and the jury had nothing to do with the question of fraud. ' The plaintiff could not have recovered for a fraud. Of that the justice had no jurisdiction.</p> <p id=\"b150-7\" pgmap=\"150(47) 151(155)\">The only remaining question is upon the rule laid down by the court for the measure of damages. The court told the jury that the measure of damages was the difference between the value of the horse as he was, and his value if sound. This, it is said, was in conflict with what we said in Crabtree v. Kile, 21 Ill. 180. There, the cattle were paid for in cash, at a fixed price, and it is said that in such a case the measure of damages is the difference between the price paid and the value of the cattle. If that be the correct rule in such a case, it is not applicable to a case like this, where no fixed price was paid for the horse, but another horse was given in exchange for him. That reduces the question at once to one of estimated value, and it is as feasible to estimate the value of the one horse as the other, and the rule laid down by the court in this case would seem to be the most just, and most consistent with principle in all cases; for then it gives each party the benefit of his bargain.</p> <p id=\"b151-5\" pgmap=\"151\">Had the plaintiff purchased the horse at a fixed price and paid for him in cash, if he got him at a low price he was entitled to the benefit of his bargain, which he would lose if he only recovered the price actually paid, and if he paid a high price for him, the defendant was, on the other hand, entitled to the benefit of his bargain, which he would lose if compelled to pay .the full amount of the money received. Justice would seem to require that the defendant should only be required to make good his warranty, which he does by making the horse as good as he warranted him to be; and so, too, the plaintiff is entitled to as good a horse as he bargained for, or the value of such a horse. At any rate, in a case like this where no fixed price was paid, the plaintiff is entitled to the pay for such a horse as this was warranted to be.</p> <p id=\"b151-6\" pgmap=\"151\">The judgment is affirmed.</p> <p id=\"b151-7\" pgmap=\"151\">Judgment affirmed.</p> </opinion> </casebody> ",
