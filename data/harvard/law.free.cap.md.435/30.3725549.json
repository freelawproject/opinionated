(Retired).</author>\n<p id=\"b62-12\">This case, consolidated actions brought by the appellees, Carl Snyder (\u201cSnyder\u201d) and Sarah Boltuck (\u201cBoltuck\u201d), 17 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"33\">*33</page-number>year-olds, who would have been 18 by the 2008 general election, presents a narrow issue: whether under Maryland law, 17 year-olds who will turn 18 by close of registration for the general election and, thus, are eligible to vote in the partisan primary election preliminary to, and associated with, that election, may vote in non-partisan primary elections, in this case, for county school boards in Frederick and Montgomery counties, respectively. This issue has its genesis in Lamone <em>v. Capozzi, </em>396 Md. 53, 912 A.2d 674 (2006). In that case, this Court held unconstitutional legislation that would have authorized early voting.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> <em>Id. </em>396 Md. at 93, 912 A.2d at 697. Critical to that legislation, in addition to permitting voting on more than one day as the Maryland Constitution prescribed, was a provision that permitted a voter to vote in a polling place other than his or her election ward or district. <em>Id. </em>at 64-65, 912 A.2d at 680-81.</p>\n<p id=\"b63-5\">Relevant to this case, we held that the latter provision conflicted with, and was therefore violative, of Article I, \u00a7 1 of the Maryland Constitution, which provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b63-6\">\u201cAll elections shall be by ballot. Except as provided in Section 3 of this article, every citizen of the United States, of the age of 18 year's or upwards, who is a resident of the State as of the time for the closing of registration next preceding the election, shall be entitled to vote in the ward or election district in which the citizen resides at all elections to be held in this State. A person once entitled to vote in any election district, shall be entitled to vote there until the person shall have acquired a residence in another election district or ward in this State.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AB\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"34\">*34</page-number>Construing this provision, we stated, \u201cIt is clear from Article I, \u00a7 1, that a voter can only vote in the election ward or district in which he resides.\u201d <em>Capozzi, </em>396 Md. at 84, 912 A.2d at 692. As the appellant, the Maryland State Board of Elections (\u201cthe appellant,\u201d \u201cMSBE,\u201d or \u201cBoard\u201d) submits, we further explained that \u201c[t]he phrase, \u2018shall be entitled to vote in the ward or election district in which he resides,\u2019 modifies the preceding phrase \u2018[ejvery citizen of the United States, of the age of 18 years or upwards, who is a resident of the State as of the time for the closing of registration next preceding the election____\u2019 The phrase, as a whole, designates who is allowed to vote, if they so choose.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 85, 912 A.2d at 692.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> We concluded:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b64-7\">\u201cThe location at which a citizen can vote also is a requirement. Even under the strained interpretation that the appellants give the phrase, \u2018shall be entitled to vote in the ward or election district in which he resides,\u2019 the subsequent language of Article I, \u00a7 1 bars voting in an election district or ward that a person does not live in. Article I, \u00a7 1 states that a person shall be entitled to vote in the ward or election district where he resides until he acquires residence in another election district or ward. Therefore, once a voter who resides and votes in a particular ward acquires residence in another election district or ward, that voter\u2019s right, his or her entitlement, to vote in the ward where he or she once resided is extinguished. If he or she has the right to vote it is in the newly acquired district or ward.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b64-8\">\n<em>Id.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b64-9\">The Court then rejected the State\u2019s alternative argument that the early voting statute was constitutional with respect to primary elections since those elections were not within the reach of Article I, \u00a7 1. <em>Id. </em>at 89, 912 A.2d at 695. We adopted the trial court\u2019s analysis and reasoned:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b65-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"35\">*35</page-number>\u201c[I]f Article I, \u00a7 1 were read to exclude primary elections, \u2018such a reading could lead to an absurd result, as it would eliminate <em>all </em>Constitutional qualifications for primary elections. Thus, a 12 year-old, non-U.S. citizen, residing in Virginia, would not be barred by the [Maryland] Constitution from voting in the Maryland primary election.\u2019 Such a reading simply cannot be correct.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b65-4\"><em>Id. </em>Thus, we held that \u201cprimary elections are included within the meaning of the phrase, \u2018at all elections to be held in this State\u2019 in Article I, \u00a7 1.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b65-5\">Following our decision in <em>Capozzi, </em>the appellant asked the Attorney General for advice as to the effect of that decision on the right of persons under 18 to vote in primary elections. That course was dictated because, prior to December 2006, when the opinion was issued, the Board had construed Maryland Code (2003, 2004 Cum. Supp.) \u00a7 3-102 of the Election Law Article (\u201cEL\u201d),<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> which implements Article I, \u00a7 1, to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"36\">*36</page-number>permit 17 year-olds to vote in primary elections. This interpretation was based on the Board\u2019s understanding that Article I, \u00a7 1 applied only to general elections and did not apply to primary elections. Therefore, before <em>Ccupozzi, </em>after becoming a registered voter pursuant to EL \u00a7 8-102(a), an individual who would be 18 by the general election could vote in a primary election, even if not 18 by the date of the primary election.</p>\n<p id=\"b66-5\">The appellant reports that the Office of the Attorney General responded that \u201cthe inescapable consequence of this Court\u2019s interpretation of Article I, \u00a7 1 was that only individuals who will turn 18 before the next election (as opposed to the next general election) should be permitted to register.\u201d Subsequently, the Attorney General\u2019s Office of Opinions and Advice issued the advisory memorandum, \u201cAge Requirement for Voting,\u201d which advised that, based on this Court\u2019s interpretation of Article I, \u00a7 1 in Capozzi, 17 year-olds who would be 18 by the next general election were prohibited from voting in primary elections. Still later, the Attorney General responded to an inquiry from a state senator regarding the decision of the two major political parties to allow 17 year-olds who would be 18 by the general election to vote in their primary.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Specifically, the senator inquired into how the decisions affected, if at all, the Attorney General\u2019s advice to the State Board on the matter of 17 year-olds voting in primary elections.</p>\n<p id=\"b66-6\">In his response, the Attorney General acknowledged the First Amendment associational rights of political parties to determine who will \u201cparticipate in the \u2018basic function\u2019 of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"37\">*37</page-number>selecting the Party\u2019s candidates,\u201d <em>Tashjian v. Republican Party of Conn., </em>479 U.S. 208, 216, 107 S.Ct. 544, 549, 93 L.Ed.2d 514, 524 (1986), and that, to burden those protected associational rights, there must be an overriding state interest. The Attorney General found no such state interest. Indeed, he found that EL \u00a7 3-102(a), as historically understood and applied by the State Board, \u201cexpressed a legislative policy in favor of permitting such voters to exercise the franchise in the primary\u201d \u2014 a policy that coincides with the associational interest recently embraced by the parties. He concluded that neither Article I, \u00a7 1, nor <em>Capozzi </em>\u201cindicates a specific state interest in excluding from primary elections those 17 year-olds who will be 18 by the time of the general election.\u201d Therefore, the Attorney General recommended that the State Board permit 17 year-olds to vote in partisan primaries, which he believed to be in accordance with EL \u00a7 3-102 and the First Amendment.</p>\n<p id=\"b67-4\">Consistent with the Attorney General\u2019s advice letter, the Board adopted the following policy:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b67-5\">\u201cA 17 year old who is a Democrat or Republican may vote in a primary election. However, if the voter lives [in a county with non-partisan contests on the ballot], the voter must vote by provisional ballot so that the local board of elections can ensure that the voter did not cast any votes in the nonpartisan contests. If a vote was cast in a non-partisan contest, this vote will not be counted, and only votes that the 17 year old is entitled to cast (i.e., partisan contests) will be counted.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b67-6\">After exhausting their administrative remedies, as required,<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Snyder<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> and Boltuck<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> filed separate complaints in the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"38\">*38</page-number>Circuit Court for Anne Arundel County against the MSBE seeking \u201cjudicial relief\u2019 pursuant to Maryland Code (2003) \u00a7 12-202 of the Election Law Article.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> Snyder alleged that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"39\">*39</page-number>the MSBE violated several provisions of the Election Law Article, including \u00a7\u00a7 3-102, 3-501,<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> and 8-802,<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> when it determined that he was ineligible to vote in the upcoming nonpartisan elections. Snyder additionally alleged that the MSBE\u2019s administrative actions violated Article I, \u00a7 1 of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"40\">*40</page-number>Constitution of Maryland, and Articles 8<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> and 24<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> of the Maryland Declaration of Rights. He requested an injunction to require the MSBE to allow him to vote by regular ballot, and to have his votes counted in the usual way in all contests on Frederick County\u2019s February 2008 ballot.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> Boltuck filed her action on January 18, 2008. The action mirrored Snyder\u2019s complaint by seeking relief pursuant to EL \u00a7 12-202, and alleging that the MSBE violated several provisions of the Election Law Article. The Snyder and Boltuck complaints were then consolidated.</p>\n<p id=\"b70-5\">At the hearing, the MSBE argued that the Circuit Court should dismiss both complaints or, in the alternative, provide favorable summary disposition. It reasoned that Article I, \u00a7 1 of the Maryland Constitution, as interpreted by <em>Capozzi, </em>prohibited persons under the age of 18 from voting in nonpartisan primary elections, even if they turn 18 before the subsequent general election.</p>\n<p id=\"b70-6\">The Circuit Court denied the MSBE\u2019s motion for summary judgment, granted the appellees\u2019 cross motion in part and, pursuant to the appellees\u2019 oral motion to amend, issued the following declaratory judgment:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b70-7\">\u201c[A]ll 17 year old voters, whether or not affiliated with any political party, who will be 18 on or before the November 4, 2008 general election, shall be entitled to vote in both the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"41\">*41</page-number>partisan and nonpartisan primary elections on February 12, 2008, and it is further ORDERED that Defendant State Board of Elections may use provisional ballots in the February 12, 2008 primary elections for all 17 year old voters, whether or not affiliated with any political party, who will be 18 on or before the November 4, 2008 general election.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AQU\">With respect to the issue this case presents, the eligibility of 17 year-olds to vote in non-partisan primary elections, the Circuit Court concluded that \u201cthe voter eligibility requirements of Article I, \u00a7 1 of the Maryland Constitution do not apply to non-partisan elections for Boards of Education, municipal elections, and local ballot questions that are not mandated by the Constitution.\u201d It found support for that interpretation of Article I, \u00a7 1 in <em>Hanna v. Young, </em>84 Md. 179, 183, 35 A. 674, 675 (1896). There, this Court stated, \u201cIt is only at elections which the constitution itself requires to be held, or which the legislature, under the mandate of the constitution, makes provision, that persons having the qualifications set forth in said Article 1, \u00a7 1 are by constitution of the state declared to be qualified electors.\u201d <em>Id. </em>The Circuit Court concluded from this statement that Article I, \u00a7 1 and <em>Capoz</em>zi\u2019s interpretation of it, were inapposite to this case and did not preclude registered 17 year-old voters from participating in a non-partisan primary election under EL \u00a7 3-102.</p>\n<p id=\"b71-4\">Pursuant to EL \u00a7 12-203(a)(3),<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> the MSBE noted its appeal of the Circuit Court\u2019s judgment. We subsequently exercised direct appellate jurisdiction to consider whether 17 year-old persons, who will be 18 at the time of the general election, are eligible to vote in the non-partisan primaries preceding that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"42\">*42</page-number>election.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> On February 8, 2008, following oral argument, we answered that question in the affirmative and issued a per curiam order, with opinion to follow, vacating the order of the Circuit Court and remanding the case <em>to </em>that court, \u201cwith directions to enter a new Order and Declaratory Judgment not inconsistent with the following determinations:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b72-5\">\u201c1. The provisions of Article I, Section 1 of the Maryland Constitution apply to primary elections conducted in Maryland.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b72-6\">\u201c2. The foregoing notwithstanding, the voter eligibility provisions of Article I, Section I are not in conflict with the age provisions of Md. Code, Election Law Article, Section 3-102. Article I, Section I does not operate to prohibit The General Assembly from establishing the age provisions in Section 3-102.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b72-7\">\u201c3. All 17-year-old registered voters who will be 18 on or before the November 4, 2008 general election, shall be entitled to vote in the primary elections to be held on February 12, 2008, including non-partisan elections for county boards of education.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b72-8\">\u201c4. The foregoing notwithstanding, such 17-year-old voters may not vote in any special or municipal election conducted concurrent with the February 12, 2008 primary election.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b72-9\">\u201c5. The State Board of Elections may use provisional ballots in the February 12, 2008 primary elections for all 17-year-old voters who will be 18 on or before the November 4, 2008 general election; and it is further</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b72-10\">\u201cORDERED, that the judgment be entered on the respective motions for summary judgment consistent with the above declarations. Mandate to issue forthwith.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b73-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"43\">*43</page-number><em>State Bd. of Elections v. Snyder, </em>403 Md. 172, 172-73, 941 A.2d 467 (2008). We now provide the reasons for our decision and order.</p>\n<p id=\"b73-4\">Article III, \u00a7 49 of the Constitution provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b73-5\">\u201cThe General Assembly shall have the power to regulate by Law, not inconsistent with this Constitution, all matters which relate to the Judges of election, time, place and manner of holding elections in this State, and of making returns thereof.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b73-6\">Pursuant to this mandate,<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> the General Assembly promulgated the State election law, <em>see County Council for Montgomery County v. Montgomery Ass\u2019n, Inc., </em>274 Md. 52, 60, 333 A.2d 596, 601 (1975), now codified as the Election Law Article. The Election Law Article expressly applies to all elections, general, primary, and special, and \u201cunless otherwise specifically provided in this article,\u201d excludes municipal elections except those in Baltimore City.<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> The provisions governing general, primary, and special elections are enumerated, and explicated, in Title 8, in Subtitles 2, 3, and 4, respectively. Also included in Title 8, in Subtitle 8, albeit exempted from some of the requirements pertaining to the other covered elections,<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> are the provisions that apply to, and govern, Board of Education elections. With the exception of ten counties and Baltimore City, county school boards are elected in countywide elections as provided in the State Code. <em>See </em>\u00a7 3-114 of the Education <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"44\">*44</page-number>Article (1978, 2008 Repl. Vol.). Significantly, although there are provisions in Title 8 pertaining to the presidential election, Subtitles 5 and 5A, the Senate elections, Title 6, and the Congressional elections, Title 7, there are no provisions for any other election.</p>\n<p id=\"b74-4\">With regard to Board of Education elections, EL \u00a7 8-802 makes clear that, unless the Education Article \u201crequires a partisan election,\u201d subsection (b), such elections are nonpartisan, making, \u201c[i]n a primary election to nominate board of education candidates, any registered voter of the county, regardless of party affiliation or lack of party affiliation, ... eligible to vote in those contests for nomination.\u201d Subsection (a). It also defines what constitutes a non-partisan election:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AFz\">\u201c(2) Candidates for election to boards of education shall, without party designation or regard to party affiliation:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"Acy\">\u201c(i) file certificates of candidacy;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b74-5\">\u201c(ii) be certified to the ballot;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b74-6\">\u201c(Hi) appear on the ballot; be voted on; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"A4\">\u201c(iv) be nominated and elected.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b74-7\">As \u00a7 8-802 indicates, there is a nominations process, in the form of a primary election, for Board of Education candidates. Section 8-804 prescribes that process:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b74-8\">\u201cNomination</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b74-9\">\u201c(a) In each year that one or more members of a board of education are to be elected, candidates shall be nominated at the primary election.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b74-10\">\u201cCandidate who dies or is disqualified before primary</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AU\">\u201c(b)(1) If a candidate dies or becomes disqualified before the ballots are printed, or at a time when the ballots can be reprinted, the name of the candidate may not appear on the ballot.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b74-11\">\u201c(2) If a candidate dies or becomes disqualified after the ballots are printed and too late for the ballot to be reprinted, any votes cast for that candidate may not be counted.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b74-12\">\u201cDetermination of nomination</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b75-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"45\">*45</page-number>\u201c(c)(1) The candidates, equal in number to twice the number of offices to be filled, who receive the largest number of votes in the primary election shall be the nominated candidates.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b75-5\">\u201c(2) If two or more candidates each receive the lowest number of votes necessary to qualify for nomination, creating a tie for the last nomination for the office to be filled, each shall be a nominated candidate.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b75-6\">Section 8-806 addresses the general election of Board of Education members:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b75-7\">\u201cNumber of votes in a contest</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b75-8\">\u201c(a) In a general election for board of education members, a voter may vote for a number of nominees equal to the number of members to be elected.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b75-9\">\u201cElections results</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b75-10\">\u201c(b)(1) The nominees, equal in number to the number of offices to be filled, who receive the largest number of votes in a general election shall be declared elected.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b75-11\">\u201c(2)(i) If two or more nominees each receive the lowest number of votes necessary to qualify for election, creating a tie for the last office to be filled, the office shall be considered vacant.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b75-12\">\u201c(ii) A vacancy occurring under subparagraph (i) of this paragraph shall be filled:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b75-13\">\u201c1. as if the vacancy occurred during the term of office for which the election is being held; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AGQ\">\u201c2. by the selection of one of the nominees who ties in the general election.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b75-14\">As we have seen, EL \u00a7 3-102 implements Article I, \u00a7 1 of the Constitution. We have stated the purpose of that Constitutional provision as being to prescribe \u201cwho may vote, where he or she may vote, and the qualifications for doing so.\u201d <em>Capozzi, </em>396 Md. at 59, 912 A.2d at 677. In implementing this provision, \u00a7 3-102 provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b75-15\">\u201c(a) Except as provided in subsection (b) of this section, an individual may become registered to vote if the individual:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b76-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"46\">*46</page-number>\u201c(1) is a citizen of the United States;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b76-4\">\u201c(2) is at least 18 years old or will be 18 years old on or before the day of the next succeeding general or special election;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b76-5\">\u201c(3) is a resident of the State as of the day the individual seeks to register; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b76-7\">\u201c(4) registers pursuant to this title.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b76-8\">\u201c(b) An individual is not qualified to be a registered voter if the individual:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b76-9\">\u201c(1) has been convicted of a felony and is actually serving a court-ordered sentence of imprisonment, including any term of parole or probation, for the conviction;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b76-10\">\u201c(2) is under guardianship for mental disability; or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AsH\">\u201c(3) has been convicted of buying or selling votes.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b76-11\">It thus expressly states that a person not yet 18, but who will be 18 by the time of the general election is eligible to vote in the primary election to which that general election relates.<footnotemark>19</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b76-12\">The Board does not deny that \u00a7 3-102 permits 17 year olds to vote in primary elections, without differentiating between partisan and non-partisan primary elections, if they would be 18 at the time of the general election. Indeed, before <em>Capozzi </em>it believed that provision to be a correct statement of the law and entirely consistent with both the letter and spirit of Article I, \u00a7 1. After <em>Capozzi </em>arguing that Article I, \u00a7 1 only provides for the right to vote for persons 18 years of age or older, it submits that EL \u00a7 3-102 conflicts with that provision and, therefore, is unenforceable, that the constitutional provision necessarily prevails, effectively prohibiting 17 year-olds from voting in nonpartisan elections.</p>\n<p id=\"b77-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"47\">*47</page-number>The appellant also argues that the Circuit Court erred in relying on <em>Hanna v. Young, </em>84 Md. 179, 35 A. 674 (1896), to conclude that Art. I, \u00a7 1 of the Maryland Constitution does not apply to, and thus does not regulate, non-partisan primary elections for \u201cCounty School Board.\u201d First, it submits, that the Circuit Court\u2019s reading of <em>Hanna </em>conflicts with <em>Capozzi, </em>which expressly determined that primary elections are included within the class of \u201call elections,\u201d as used in Article I, \u00a7 1, to which that provision applies, and others of our cases, namely <em>Reeder v. Board of Supervisors of Elections of Queen Anne\u2019s County, </em>269 Md. 261, 305 A.2d 132 (1973); <em>Nader for President 2004 v. Maryland State Board of Elections, </em>399 Md. 681, 926 A.2d 199 (2007); <em>Maryland Green Party v. Maryland Board of Elections, </em>377 Md. 127, 832 A.2d 214 (2003). In any event, the Board asserts, the holding reflected in the sentence on which the Circuit Court relies \u2014 \u201cIt is only at elections which the constitution itself requires to be held, or which the legislature, under the mandate of the constitution, makes provision, that persons having the qualifications set forth in said section 1, art. I, are by the constitution of the state declared to be qualified electors\u201d \u2014 aside from being dicta, is overbroad, \u201ca broad carve-out from the voter eligibility requirements of Article I, \u00a7 1.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b77-5\">The appellees take the opposite position. They argue, as the Circuit Court found, that the sentence from Hanna<footnotemark>20</footnotemark> that the Circuit Court determined to be dispositive precludes the application of constitutional requirements to the primary elections at-issue. They thus agree with the Circuit Court that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"48\">*48</page-number>the Maryland Constitution\u2019s election requirements do not apply to the non-partisan primary elections at issue here, as they are neither required by the Constitution nor otherwise the direct product of Constitutional mandate.</p>\n<p id=\"b78-5\">Whether, or not, the Circuit Court correctly interpreted and applied <em>Hanna, </em>however, the appellees believe the result it reached was correct. The appellees\u2019 argument proceeds from the simple proposition that Article I, \u00a7 1 does not expressly prohibit persons who are not 18 from having the right to vote, rather, that it merely guarantees the right to vote to individuals who will be 18 by the time of the next election. That \u201cpermits the General Assembly to expand voter qualifications when it has a rational basis to do so, as indisputably exists here.\u201d The appellees further argue that EL \u00a7 3-102 does not conflict with Article I, \u00a7 1 or any other provision of the Maryland Constitution.<footnotemark>21</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b78-6\">We disagree with the appellees\u2019 construction of <em>Hanna </em>as it relates to, and impacts, primary elections for State or county offices. <em>Hanna </em>fully applies, and is dispositive with regard, to municipal elections. The appellant is correct, the statement upon which the Circuit Court and the appellees heavily rely is dictum. The issue in <em>Hanna </em>was whether the Maryland Constitution applied to municipal elections. In the 111 years since <em>Hanna </em>was decided, we have only cited <em>Hanna </em>in four cases, and then only for the proposition that constitutional requirements for elections do not apply to municipal elections. <em>See Citizens Against Slots v. PPE Casino Resorts, </em>429 Md. 176, 186 n. 7, 55 A.3d 496, 502 n. 7 (2012) (observing that municipal elections generally fall outside the scope of Article I); <em>Hill v. Colmar Manor, </em>210 Md. 46, 53, 122 A.2d 462, 466 (1956) (same); <em>Jackson v. Norris, </em>173 Md. 579, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"49\">*49</page-number>602, 195 A. 576, 587 (1937) (same); <em>Johnson v. </em>Luers, 129 Md. 521, 531-532, 99 A. 710, 713 (1916) (same).<footnotemark>22</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b79-4\">Again, the only issue in <em>Hanna </em>was whether the State constitutional voter requirements, as set forth in Article I, \u00a7 1 of the Maryland Constitution, applied to a municipal election for the Town Commissioner of Bel Air, Maryland. <em>See Hanna, </em>84 Md. at 180-81, 35 A. at 674-75. We observed that the election requirements contained in Article I \u00a7 1 at that time did not refer to any municipalities other than Baltimore City. <em>Id. </em>at 182-83, 35 A. at 676. In considering the role of municipalities in the State government, we explained:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b79-5\">\u201cThe constitution of this state provides for the creation of certain offices, state and county, which are filled either by election or by appointment; and we regard it as an unreasonable inference to suppose that municipal elections held within the state (outside the corporate limits of Baltimore city) can be properly termed elections, under the constitution, such as state and county elections; or that the framers of the constitution ever contemplated that [Article 1, \u00a7 1], of that instrument was intended to apply to municipal elections, such as the one now under consideration, which is the mere creature of statutory enactment. In the creation of a new municipality, the constitution devolves upon the general assembly the entire duty of giving vitality to and of organizing and fostering the body corporate without any other constitutional regulation than the mandate to provide for the system itself. It is therefore the mere creature of legislative sanction, and the subject of statutory regulation.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AYA\"><em>Id. </em>at 183, 35 A. at 675. We reasoned that the office of \u201cTown Commissioner\u201d was a municipal office that was not subject to the requirements of Article I, \u00a7 1 of the Constitution because it was not selected by \u201ccounty or state election,\u201d not \u201cclothed with power\u201d of the State, and not \u201cdesignated as any part of our State government.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 183, 35 A. at 675. The position <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"50\">*50</page-number>of Town Commissioner was, in reality, a municipal office chosen by municipal election.<footnotemark>23</footnotemark> We concluded that, because municipal elections, as distinct from State and county elections, are not subject to the requirements of Article I, \u00a7 1, the election for town commissioner was not subject to the requirements of Article I, \u00a7 1. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b80-5\">The present case, of course, does not involve a municipal election or municipal office. Unlike the municipal position of \u201cTown Commissioner,\u201d at issue in <em>Hanna, </em>the issue here concerns a primary election to nominate persons for membership on the County School Boards of Frederick and Montgomery counties. County school boards, while local in some respects, are not municipal offices. They were established by the General Assembly in 1868, pursuant to the mandate of Article VIII, \u00a7 1 of the 1864 Constitution, by ch. 407 of the Acts of 1868,<footnotemark>24</footnotemark> <em>Chesapeake Charter, Inc. v. Anne Arundel Cnty. Bd. of Educ., </em>358 Md. 129, 136, 747 A.2d 625, 629 (2000), and, since, have been consistently regarded as State agencies, <em>Bldg. Materials Corp. of Am. v. Bd. of Educ., </em>428 Md. 572, 576, 53 A.3d 347, 350 (2012), notwithstanding that \u201cin terms of their composition, jurisdiction, funding, and focus, they clearly have a local flavor.\u201d <em>Chesapeake Charter, </em>358 Md. at 136-37, 747 A.2d at 629. In <em>Chesapeake Charter, </em>we explained:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b81-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"51\">*51</page-number>\u201cCounty school boards are considered generally to be State agencies because (1) the public school system in Maryland is a comprehensive State-wide system, created by the General Assembly in conformance with the mandate in Article VIII, \u00a7 1 of the Maryland Constitution to establish throughout the State a thorough and efficient system of free public schools, (2) the county boards were created by the General Assembly as an integral part of that State system, (3) their mission is therefore to carry out a State, not a county, function, and (4) they are subject to extensive supervision by the State Board of Education in virtually every aspect of their operations that affects educational policy or the administration of the public schools in the county.[<footnotemark>25</footnotemark>] Although <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"52\">*52</page-number>legally State agencies for those reasons, they are not normally regarded, for structural or budgetary purposes, as units within the Executive Branch of the State government.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b82-4\">358 Md. at 136-37, 747 A.2d at 629. We conclude that the Circuit Court erred in finding that our decision in <em>Hanna v. Young, </em>84 Md. 179, 35 A. 674 (1896), precludes the application of Article I, \u00a7 1 to the school board primary election at issue in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b82-5\">Also unlike the election at issue in <em>Hanna, </em>the selection process at issue in the present case is a primary election. <em>See </em>EL \u00a7 8-804. As the appellant has pointed out and emphasized, we have recently held that the election requirements contained in Article I, \u00a7 1 apply to all primary elections in the State of Maryland. <em>See Capozzi, </em>396 Md. at 89, 912 A.2d at 695 (holding \u201call elections to be held in this State\u201d as used in Article I, \u00a7 1, applies to all primary elections). In that case, the State contended that early voting was permissible in undifferentiated primary elections because of the Legislature\u2019s plenary authority to regulate primary elections. <em>See id. </em>at 88, 912 A.2d at 694. As pointed out, we rejected that argument and held that \u201cprimary elections are included within the meaning of \u2018all elections to be held in the State\u2019 in Article I, \u00a7 1.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>at 89, 912 A.2d at 695 (quoting Article I, \u00a7 1). We made that statement without qualification. Since EL \u00a7 8-804(a) provides that members of the County School Board shall be nominated by <em>primary </em>election and \u00a7 3-102 permits a 17 year-old to vote in a related primary, provided he or she will be 18 when the general election occurs, it follows that, unless <em>Capozzi </em>dictates the result the appellant advocates, Art I, \u00a7 1 applies to those non-partisan primary elections and, thus, the election at-issue in the present case, just as it applies to partisan primary and general elections in the State of Maryland.</p>\n<p id=\"b82-6\">We turn, therefore, to the remaining question this appeal presents: whether Article I, \u00a7 1 of the Maryland Constitution precludes enforcement of \u00a7 3-102(a) of the Election Law Article, which, by its terms (\u201can individual under the age of 18 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"53\">*53</page-number>years ... may vote in a primary election in which candidates are nominated for a general or special election that will occur when the individual is at least 18 years old\u201d) permits 17 yearolds to register to vote in non-partisan primary elections if they will be 18 years-old by the next general election. Stated differently, the question is whether <em>Capozzi </em>requires the conclusion drawn by the appellant that \u00a7 3-102(a) is in conflict with Article I \u00a7 1.</p>\n<p id=\"b83-4\">Resolving this conflict is a matter of constitutional construction or interpretation. Our task in matters requiring constitutional interpretation is to discern and then give effect to the intent of the instrument\u2019s drafters and the public that adopted it. <em>Fish Market Nominee Corp. v. G.A.A., Inc., </em>337 Md. 1, 8-9, 650 A.2d 705, 708 (1994). <em>See Bernstein v. State, </em>422 Md. 36, 43-44, 29 A.3d 267, 271 (2011) (citing <em>Buchholtz v. Hill, </em>178 Md. 280, 285-86, 13 A.2d 348, 351 (1940)) (recognizing that, because the Constitution was carefully written by its drafters, solemnly adopted by the constitutional convention, and approved by the people of Maryland, courts lack the discretion to freely depart from the plain language of the instrument). In that regard, we stated in <em>Brown v. Brown, </em>287 Md. 273, 412 A.2d 396 (1980):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b83-5\">\u201c[I]t is axiomatic that the words used in the enactment should be given the construction that effectuates the intent of its framers ... such intent is first sought from the terminology used in the provision, with each word being given its ordinary and popularly understood meaning ... and, if the words are not ambiguous, the inquiry is terminated....\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b83-6\">287 Md. at 277-78, 412 A.2d at 398-99. In approaching and performing this task, we look to the natural and ordinary meaning of the provision\u2019s language. <em>See Roskelly v. Lamone, </em>396 Md. 27, 48, 912 A.2d 658, 671 (2006). Where the provision at issue is clear and unambiguous, the Court will not infer the meaning from sources outside of the Constitution itself. <em>See Comptroller v. Phillips, </em>384 Md. 583, 591, 865 A.2d 590, 594 (2005); <em>see also Adamson v. Correctional Medical Services, </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"54\">*54</page-number><em>Inc., </em>359 Md. 238, 251, 753 A.2d 501, 508 (2000) (observing that when the language of a legal provision is clear or unambiguous our interpretative inquiry ends).</p>\n<p id=\"b84-4\">When a constitutional provision is ambiguous or otherwise unclear, we approach its interpretation the same way that we interpret statutory language, and we generally apply the same principles. <em>See Davis v. Slater, </em>383 Md. 599, 604, 861 A.2d 78, 81 (2004) (\u201cWhen interpreting constitutional provisions, we generally employ the same rules of construction that are applicable to the construction of statutory language.\u201d). That approach was described in <em>Johns Hopkins University v. Williams, </em>199 Md. 382, 86 A.2d 892 (1952):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b84-5\">\u201c[CJourts may consider the mischief at which the provision was aimed, the remedy, the temper and spirit of the people at the time it was framed, the common usage well known to the people, and the history of the growth or evolution of the particular provision under consideration. In aid of an inquiry into the true meaning of the language used, weight may also be given to long continued contemporaneous construction by officials charged with the administration of the government, and especially by the Legislature.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b84-6\"><em>Id. </em>at 386-87, 86 A.2d at 894. Because discerning and giving effect to the intent of the provision is the goal, interpretive results that are illogical or inconsistent with common sense should be avoided whenever possible, consistent with the statutory language. <em>State v. Fabritz, </em>276 Md. 416, 422, 348 A.2d 275, 279 (1975). We have also observed, in that regard, that statutory laws regarding the same subject are to be read and harmonized together in order to avoid leaving the provision at issue ineffective, duplicative, or nugatory. <em>See Whiting-Turner Contracting Co. v. Fitzpatrick, </em>366 Md. 295, 302, 783 A.2d 667, 671 (2001). For this reason, where a statutory provision is a part of a statutory scheme, that provision will be interpreted within the context of that statutory scheme. <em>Fitzpatrick, </em>366 Md. at 302, 783 A.2d at 671 (citing <em>Government Employees Ins. Co. v. Insurance Comm\u2019r, </em>332 Md. 124, 131-132, 630 A.2d 713, 717-18 (1993)).</p>\n<p id=\"b85-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"55\">*55</page-number>In construing a constitution, we have stated \u201cthat a constitution is to be interpreted by the spirit which vivifies, and not b[y] the letter which killeth.\u201d <em>Bernstein v. </em>State, 422 Md. 36, 56, 29 A.3d 267, 279 (2011) (quoting <em>Benson v. State, </em>389 Md. 615, 632, 887 A.2d 525, 535 (2005), in turn citing <em>Buchholtz v. Hill, </em>178 Md. 280, 286, 13 A.2d 348, 351 (1940)). We similarly do not read the Constitution as a series of independent parts. <em>See County Comm\u2019rs for Montgomery County v. Supervisors of Elections, </em>192 Md. 196, 208, 63 A.2d 735, 740 (1949). Just as a statute is read in the context of a regulatory scheme, this Court construes constitutional provisions as part of the Constitution as a whole. <em>See State v. Jarrett, </em>17 Md. 309, 328 (1861) (\u201c[i]n construing a Constitution, it must be taken as a whole, and every part of it, as far as possible, interpreted in reference to the general and prevailing principle.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b85-5\">With these guiding principles in mind, we turn first to the determination of whether Article I, \u00a7 1 is clear or ambiguous. The second sentence of that provision pertaining to the age requirement is the key to that inquiry. It provides, as we have seen:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b85-6\">\u201cExcept as provided in Section 3 of this article, every citizen of the United States, of the age of 18 years or upwards, who is a resident of the State as of the time for the closing of registration next preceding the election, shall be entitled to vote in the ward or election district in which the citizen resides at all elections to be held in this State\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b85-7\">Article I, \u00a7 1.</p>\n<p id=\"b85-8\">We read that sentence as providing that individuals who reside in Maryland and <em>will be </em>18 years-old by the close of registration next preceding \u201cthe election,\u201d have the right to vote in \u201call elections\u201d in Maryland.<footnotemark>26</footnotemark> The present case therefore turns upon whether the term, \u201cthe election,\u201d as used in the phrase, \u201cas of the time for the closing of registration next <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"56\">*56</page-number>preceding the election,\u201d is restricted to a general election\u2014 County, State, or Federal \u2014 or refers also to the primary election that precedes and informs it. If the term, \u201celection,\u201d in that phrase refers to \u201cprimary elections,\u201d then the appellant is correct, the appellees would not be entitled to vote because they would not be 18 by the time of the primary election. On the other hand, if \u201cthe election\u201d refers to the \u201cgeneral election,\u201d then the appellees would be entitled to vote in all primary elections because they would be 18 before the close of the registration preceding the general election.</p>\n<p id=\"b86-4\">The appellant reads <em>Lamone v. Capozzi, </em>396 Md. 53, 912 A.2d 674 (2006), as interpreting the above language to include the age restriction for voting and, thus, to prohibit persons who are not yet 18 from voting in primary elections. We said on the matter in <em>Capozzi:</em></p>\n<blockquote id=\"b86-5\">\u201cWe adopt the analysis offered by the Circuit Court in holding that primary elections are included within the meaning of \u2018at all elections to be held in this State\u2019 in Article I, \u00a7 1: if Article I, \u00a7 1 were read to exclude primary elections, \u2018such a reading could lead to an absurd result, as it would eliminate all Constitutional qualifications for primary elections. Thus, a 12 year-old, non-U.S. citizen, residing in Virginia, would not be barred by the [Maryland] Constitution from voting in the Maryland primary election.\u2019 Such a reading simply cannot be correct.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b86-6\"><em>Id. </em>at 89, 912 A.2d at 695. Pointing specifically to our statements in <em>Capozzi, </em>the appellant concludes that the appellees would not be 18 by the primary election, and are therefore prohibited from voting in that election.</p>\n<p id=\"b86-7\">Contrary to the appellant\u2019s view, we conclude that <em>Capozzi </em>is inapposite to the disposition of this case. First, as the appellees point out, <em>\u201cCapozzi </em>dealt solely with early voting. It did not address in any fashion the question of eligibility to vote based on age, and it did not in any manner address the interpretation of \u00a7 3-102 of the Election Code.\u201d<footnotemark>27</footnotemark> It is, of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"57\">*57</page-number>course, significant, to this point, that it was the phrase, \u201cshall be entitled to vote in the ward or election district in which the citizen resides at all elections to be held in this State,\u201d of the second sentence to which the <em>Capozzi </em>Court referred, not the phrase, \u201cwho is a resident of the State as of the time for the closing of registration next preceding the election.\u201d Second, the sentence\u2019s syntax and use of the definite article in the term \u201cthe election\u201d suggest that \u201celection\u201d in the phrase \u201cas of the time for the closing of registration next preceding the election\u201d is not synonymous with \u201call elections,\u201d as used in the phrase \u201cat all elections to be held in this State.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b87-4\">The latter term, \u201call elections,\u201d clearly refers to any election and was the quoted textual basis for the <em>Capozzi </em>Court\u2019s holding. <em>See id. </em>If the two terms \u201cthe election\u201d and \u201call elections\u201d were interchangeable, as the appellant uses <em>Capozzi </em>to argue, the second phrase of the second sentence of Article I, \u00a7 1 would be nugatory.<footnotemark>28</footnotemark> <em>See Whiting-Turner Contracting </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"58\">*58</page-number><em>Co. v. Fitzpatrick, </em>366 Md. 295, 302, 783 A.2d 667, 671 (2001) (\u201c[W]henever possible, the statute should be read so that no word, clause, sentence or phrase is rendered superfluous or nugatory.\u201d). It would also effectively eviscerate the difference between a primary election and a general election, a difference that the General Assembly took some pains to establish. <em>See </em>EL \u00a7\u00a7 8-201, et seq. and 8-301, et seq. and \u00a7\u00a7 8-804 and 8-806. The sentence would read as providing that every citizen who is 18 and a resident of the state at the close of registration before <em>all </em>elections shall be entitled to vote in <em>all </em>elections. That, in turn, would raise additional questions regarding the application of Article I, \u00a7 1, <em>e.g., </em>what exactly \u201cthe close of registration next preceding all elections\u201d means, and produce an unacceptable result under our precedents. <em>See id. </em>at 302, 783 A.2d at 671 (\u201c[A] statute is to be given a reasonable interpretation, not one that is illogical or incompatible with common sense.\u201d). We therefore conclude that <em>Capozzi </em>is inapposite to the question in the present case.</p>\n<p id=\"b88-4\">We also conclude that the term \u201cthe election\u201d in the phrase \u201cas of the time for the closing of registration next preceding the election\u201d refers to the next county, state, federal, or other \u201cgeneral election,\u201d and not to the next primary election. Primary elections are, as the relevant statutes make clear, nominating procedures by which the candidates in the general election are selected. <em>See State Administrative Board of Election Laws v. Calvert, </em>272 Md. 659, 676, 327 A.2d 290, 299 (1974). Such procedures were not in use in Maryland, or in the rest of the country, for that matter, when the Constitution of 1867 was adopted. <em>See id. </em>(\u201cA primary election is merely an officially supervised party nominating procedure. It appears to have been unknown in Maryland prior to the first decade of this century.\u201d) (citing <em>Hennegan v. Geartner, </em>186 Md. 551, 554, 47 A.2d 393, 394 (1946)); <em>see also </em>Sean M. Ramaley, <em>Is the Bell Tolling: Will the Death of the Partisan Blanket Primary Signal the End for Open Primary Elections?, </em>63 U. Pitt. L.Rev. 217, 221 (2001) (\u201cStates as a whole began adopting the direct primary system near the turn of the last century.\u201d). While the use of primary elections has recent<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"59\">*59</page-number>ly expanded to include nonpartisan elections, primary elections were originally created as a way for the major political parties to nominate candidates democratically for public office. <em>See Hennegan, </em>186 Md. at 554, 47 A.2d at 394. It is unlikely, therefore, that either the drafters or the adopters of the Constitution understood the term \u201cthe election\u201d to refer to a primary election. <em>See Roskelly v. Lamone, </em>396 Md. 27, 49, 912 A.2d 658, 671 (2006) (\u201c[The Constitution\u2019s] words must be taken in their ordinary and common acceptation, because they are presumed to have been so understood by the framers and by the people who adopted it.\u201d (internal citations omitted)).</p>\n<p id=\"b89-5\">Our conclusion that the term, \u201cthe election,\u201d refers to general, rather than primary elections, is consistent with other provisions of the Constitution that do not refer explicitly to a general election, but could not plausibly be read otherwise. For example, Article II, \u00a7 2 of the original 1876 Constitution provided:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b89-6\"><em>\u201cAn election </em>for Governor under this Constitution, shall be held on the Tuesday next after the first Monday of November, in the year eighteen hundred and sixty-seven, and on the same day and month in every fourth year thereafter, at the place of voting for delegates to the General Assembly[.]\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"Av_\">(Emphasis added). This provision provides for the holding of an election for Governor on the first Tuesday after the first Monday of November every four years.<footnotemark>29</footnotemark> The phrase \u201can election\u201d refers to what we now call a general election. The first reason for this is obvious. Primary elections, as we have seen, while elections in the sense that they are mechanisms by which the electorate decides between competing candidates, are merely nominating procedures for a subsequent general election. <em>See Hennegan, </em>186 Md. at 554, 47 A.2d at 394. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"60\">*60</page-number>Second, as pointed out, when the language that established the general election for Governor was first adopted as part of the Constitution of 1867, primary elections for public office were not in use within Maryland or in the greater United States, just as is the case with Article I, \u00a7 1.</p>\n<p id=\"b90-4\">We conclude from the above that Article I, \u00a7 1 refers to two distinct but equal classes of qualifications for the elective franchise. First are the age and residency requirements that must be satisfied by an individual prior to \u201cthe close of registration next preceding the election.\u201d Second are the time, place and manner requirements applicable to \u201call elections to be held in the State of the Maryland.\u201d When read in context, we think it clearly follows that EL \u00a7 3-102, which permits 17 year-olds to vote in primary elections if they will be 18 by the close of the voter registration preceding the general election, fully embodies, and is not in conflict with, the age qualifications of Article I, \u00a7 1.</p>\n<p id=\"b90-5\">Any contrary reading would impute an anti-democratic meaning upon that provision, and would thus contradict the democratic imperatives underlying Article I, \u00a7 1 of the Constitution. The drafters of the 1851 Constitution added Article I, \u00a7 1 to the Constitution as part of a broader effort to unify the constitutional elective franchise provisions under a single article of the Constitution. <em>See </em>Dan Friedman, <em>The Maryland Constitution, </em>50-51 (2006). They enacted Article I, \u00a7 1 as a \u201cdemocratizing reform\u201d to preserve the secrecy and independence of voters from the State\u2019s aristocratic classes who dominated Maryland politics at the time. <em>Id. </em>Consistent with this fact, we have stated multiple times that Article 1, \u00a7 1 of the Constitution embodies the same principles represented in Article 7 of the Maryland Declaration of Rights. <em>See Nader for President 2004 v. Maryland State Board of Elections, </em>399 Md. 681, 685-86, 926 A.2d 199, 201 (2007); <em>Maryland Green Party v. Maryland Board of Elections, </em>377 Md. 127, 140-43, 832 A.2d 214, 222-23 (2003); <em>Hennegan v. Geartner, </em>186 Md. 551, 554, 47 A.2d 393, 394 (1946). Article 7 of the Maryland Declaration of Rights provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b91-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"61\">*61</page-number>\u201cThat the right of the People to participate in the Legislature is the best security of liberty and the foundation of all free Government; for this purpose, elections ought to be free and frequent; and every citizen having the qualifications prescribed by the Constitution, ought to have the right of suffrage.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b91-4\">In accordance with this Article, in cases involving voting rights such as the case <em>sub judice, </em>we construe the relevant constitutional provisions in relation to their purpose of providing and encouraging the fair and free exercise of the elective franchise. <em>See Kemp v. Owens, </em>76 Md. 235, 241, 24 A. 606, 608 (1892). The rationale for this policy, as made clear by Article 7 of the Declaration of Rights, is that the \u201c[right to vote] is one of, if not, the most important and \u2018fundamental right[s] granted to Maryland citizens as members of a free society.\u2019 \u201d <em>Nader, </em>399 Md. 681, 686, 926 A.2d 199, 201-02 (2007) (quoting <em>Liddy v. Lamone, </em>398 Md. 233, 254, 919 A.2d 1276, 1290 (2007)). In <em>Maryland Green Party v. State Board of Elections, </em>we concluded that Article 7 of the Maryland Declaration of Rights \u201chas been held to be even more protective of rights of political participation than the provisions of the Federal Constitution.\u201d 377 Md. 127, 150, 832 A.2d 214, 228 (2003). Most clearly, we have stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b91-5\">\u201cThe elective franchise is the highest right of the citizen, and the spirit of our institutions requires that every opportunity should be afforded for its fair and free exercise. However ambiguously or obscurely statutes or constitutions may be phrased, it would not be just to give them a construction in hostility to the principles on which free governments are founded.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b91-6\"><em>Kemp, </em>76 Md. 235, 241, 24 A. 606, 608 (1892).</p>\n<p id=\"b91-7\">The above authorities illuminate the way to the disposition of the present case. It would be inconsistent with the purposes of Maryland law regarding the individual elective franchise were we to hold that an individual must be 18 years-old at the time of the primary election in order to vote in that election. Such a result would deny 17 year-old persons, who <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"62\">*62</page-number>would otherwise be eligible to vote in the subsequent general election, the opportunity to participate fully in the elective process. This result would directly contradict the right to vote and our observation in the Maryland Declaration of Rights that \u201cthe spirit of our institutions requires that every opportunity should be afforded for its fair and free exercise.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 241, 24 A. at 608.</p>\n<p id=\"b92-5\">For the above reasons, we conclude that 17 year-olds who will turn 18 by close of voter registration before the next general election are constitutionally and statutorily entitled to vote in primary elections, whether partisan or non-partisan, subject to all other provisions of the Constitution and statutory election law.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b63-7\">.
