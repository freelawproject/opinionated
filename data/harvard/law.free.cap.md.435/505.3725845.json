The Petition alleged that Respondent engaged in professional misconduct, in violation of the Maryland Lawyers\u2019 Rules of Professional Conduct (\u201cMLRPC\u201d), in two separate client matters: his representation of Lisa and Montgomery Embrey in an automobile warranty action, and his representation of Lily Cleaves in a credit card debt collection matter. Specifically, the Petition alleged that Respondent violated MLRPC 1.1 (competence)<footnotemark>2</footnotemark>; 1.3 (diligence)<footnotemark>3</footnotemark>; 1.4(a) and (b) (communication)<footnotemark>4</footnotemark>; and 8.4(a), (c), and (d) (misconduct)<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> with respect to the Embreys, and 1.1; <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"511\">*511</page-number>1.3; 1.4(a) and (b); 1.15(a) (safekeeping property)<footnotemark>6</footnotemark>; 5.5(a) (assistance in the unauthorized practice of law)<footnotemark>7</footnotemark>; and 8.4(a), (c), and (d) with respect to Ms. Cleaves.</p>\n<p id=\"b541-4\">On October 1, 2012, this Court designated the Honorable M. Elizabeth Bowen of the Circuit Court for Howard County (\u201cthe hearing judge\u201d) to conduct an evidentiary hearing and file written findings of fact and conclusions of law pursuant to Maryland Rules 16-752(a) and 16-757(c). Judge Bowen held the hearing on January 29, 2013. She then filed her Statement of Findings of Fact and Conclusions of Law with this Court on April 10, 2013, concluding by clear and convincing evidence that Respondent violated MLRPC 1.1; 1.3; 1.4(a) and (b); and 8.4(a), (c), and (d) with respect to the Embreys, and MLRPC 1.1; 1.3; 5.5(a); and 8.4(a) and (d) with respect to Ms. Cleaves.</p>\n<p id=\"b542-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"512\">*512</page-number>I.</p>\n<p id=\"b542-4\">Based on the evidence accepted at the January 29, 2013, hearing, the hearing judge set forth the following findings of fact:</p>\n<p id=\"b542-5\">Respondent has been a member of the Bar of this Court since December 16, 1997. He practiced for a short time at a small private law firm before joining the Office of the Attorney General, where he worked for seven years until he took medical retirement. He established his own practice in 2008.</p>\n<p id=\"b542-6\">\n<em>Representation of the Embreys</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b542-7\">In 2009, Respondent assumed an \u201cof counsel\u201d position at the Ohio law firm of Kahn <em>&amp; </em>Associates (\u201cKahn\u201d), in which he represented the firm\u2019s clients in \u201clemon lawsuits\u201d<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> in Maryland. Another Kahn attorney, Christal Edwards, had filed suit on behalf of Lisa and Montgomery Embrey against General Motors (\u201cGM\u201d) in the Circuit Court for Frederick County on August 6, 2009, alleging that the Embreys\u2019 Chevrolet malfunctioned. Kahn re-assigned the case to Respondent in September 2009, but Respondent did not enter his appearance until October 27, 2009. On October 5, 2009, the Circuit Court issued a Scheduling Order and Order for Civil Mediation setting deadlines for discovery, designation of expert witnesses, motions, and mediation.</p>\n<p id=\"b542-8\">On October 27, 2009, the same day he entered his appearance, Respondent filed a Line to Enter Change of Address from Kahn\u2019s Ohio mailing address to 205 E. 28th Street, Baltimore, MD 21218. Within a month of entering his appearance, Respondent moved his office from the 28th Street location in Baltimore to his home in Abingdon. As a result, he began to employ P.O. Box 347, Abingdon, MD 21009 as his professional mailing address.</p>\n<p id=\"b543-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"513\">*513</page-number>Respondent had not filed a second Line to Enter Change of Address with the Circuit Court. The attorney for GM in this matter, Barbara Duvall, acted as opposing counsel on numerous other unrelated cases with Respondent during this period and, as a consequence, was aware of his new mailing address. She thus addressed all correspondence in the Embreys\u2019 case to the Abingdon address and had all filings served there.</p>\n<p id=\"b543-4\">On November 13, 2009, Duvall mailed to Respondent interrogatories, a request for production of documents, and a request for admissions of fact. On December 16, 2009, the day on which responses were due, Respondent sent Duvall an email requesting an extension. Duvall consented to that request. Respondent, however, did not provide discovery by the date to which they had agreed. On January 12, 2010, Duvall sent to Respondent via email and regular mail a reminder that the extended deadline had passed, informing him that she would file a Motion to Compel Discovery if he did not provide responses by January 26, 2010. Respondent did not provide discovery, and on January 29, 2010, Duvall filed her Motion to Compel. Respondent filed no response to Duvall\u2019s motion. The Circuit Court granted the Motion to Compel on March 3, 2010, entering an order requiring an answer to discovery by March 8, 2010. Respondent never filed any discovery in the matter.</p>\n<p id=\"b543-5\">The October 5 Scheduling Order set December 12, 2009, as the deadline by which Respondent was to designate an expert witness in the Embreys\u2019 case. In a February 2, 2010, email to Duvall, Respondent admitted that he had failed to designate an expert witness in compliance with the Order. He requested an extension, to which Duvall did not acquiesce. On March 1, 2010, citing Respondent\u2019s failures to provide discovery and to designate an expert witness, GM filed a Motion for Summary Judgment. Respondent filed no opposition to the motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b543-6\">The October 5 Scheduling Order also mandated that the parties participate in mediation. Respondent and a paralegal at Duvall\u2019s law firm had corresponded over email in November <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"514\">*514</page-number>2009 and designated two mutually agreeable dates on which to schedule the mediation: March 2 and 3, 2010. The mediator sent his letter confirming March 3, 2010, as the chosen date to Christal Edwards. Respondent did not notify the Embreys of the two potential dates for the mediation and failed to confirm with Duvall\u2019s paralegal which date the mediator had selected. Neither Respondent nor the Embreys appeared at the mediation.</p>\n<p id=\"b544-5\">On March 12, 2010, Duvall filed a Motion for Sanctions, to which Respondent filed no opposition. On April 1, 2010, the Circuit Court granted the motion, dismissed the Embreys\u2019 case with prejudice, and assessed against the Embreys GM\u2019s attorney\u2019s fees and costs.</p>\n<p id=\"b544-6\">On June 7, 2010, Respondent filed a Motion to Vacate Judgment Due to Fraud, Mistake, or Irregularity. In the motion, Respondent stated that, because of his change of address, he \u201cnever received documentation of any kind from the court and only a few of Defendant\u2019s filings,\u201d and he cited this as the reason the court should vacate the dismissal.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> He also stated in the motion that he had filed a Line to Enter Change of Address on October 27, 2010, though he filed this Line on October 27, 2009, and the address he submitted at that time was his Baltimore address. On June 24, 2010, the Circuit Court denied the motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b544-7\">When Kahn re-assigned the Embreys\u2019 case to Respondent, the firm informed Ms. Embrey and gave her Respondent\u2019s contact information. Respondent and Ms. Embrey communicated over email on October 13, 2009, regarding whether Ms. Embrey should take her car to an automobile mechanic for service, but Respondent did not contact her again until the end of January 2010. Although Ms. Embrey offered contradictory testimony about the extent of her attempts to contact Respondent during this period, Respondent testified that there was no great need for communication over those months. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"515\">*515</page-number>The hearing judge, however, found this three-month period to be a critical one, requiring client input for the purposes of responding to discovery, scheduling the court-ordered mediation, and giving an expert the opportunity to inspect the Embreys\u2019 car.</p>\n<p id=\"b545-4\">After the depositions on February 15, 2010, at which she learned that Respondent had failed to provide responses to GM\u2019s interrogatories, Ms. Embrey contacted Respondent frequently via telephone and email to request information about the status of her case. The hearing judge found that Respondent did not respond to these requests to his client\u2019s satisfaction.</p>\n<p id=\"b545-5\">Respondent admitted that he did not inform the Embreys of his failure to designate an expert witness or provide discovery, nor of GM\u2019s Motions to Compel Discovery, for Summary Judgment, and for Sanctions. He did inform Ms. Embrey that they had missed the court-ordered mediation, but later told her, incorrectly, that this was the reason her case had been dismissed. After the Circuit Court denied the Motion to Vacate, Respondent assured Ms. Embrey that he would file a Motion for Reconsideration, but he never did so.</p>\n<p id=\"b545-6\">Respondent also failed to communicate to the Embreys GM\u2019s repeated requests for a settlement demand. The hearing judge found this failure of communication to be incompetent given Respondent\u2019s acknowledgment that he did not believe the Embreys were entitled to the remedy they desired (replacement of their vehicle), and that Respondent\u2019s failure to comply with GM\u2019s discovery demands rendered his clients\u2019 case susceptible to dismissal.</p>\n<p id=\"b545-7\">Based upon these factual findings, the hearing judge concluded that Respondent violated MLRPC 1.1 (competence); 1.3 (diligence); 1.4(a) and (b) (communication); and 8.4(a), (c), and (d) (misconduct). The hearing judge explained her conclusions, as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b545-8\">Rule 1.1 Competence</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b546-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"516\">*516</page-number>Respondent failed to provide competent representation to the Embreys. He failed to file any answers to GM\u2019s requests for discovery, despite reminders and extensions from opposing counsel and an additional five days for compliance given by the court in the order to compel. He failed to designate an expert in compliance with the deadline in the scheduling order, despite a clear understanding that this failure would prove fatal to his clients\u2019 lemon law case. Although opposing counsel took responsibility for coordinating a mutually agreeable mediation date, Respondent failed to verify and calendar the chosen date. As a result, he and his client failed to appear for mediation. Respondent failed to answer the motions to compel, for summary judgment and for sanctions which were the inevitable result of his inaction. Respondent\u2019s failures caused the dismissal of his clients\u2019 case and the entry of an order for sanctions against them. Respondent\u2019s conduct was in violation of Rule 1.1.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b546-4\">Rule 1.3 Diligence</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b546-5\">Respondent failed to act with <em>any </em>diligence or promptness in his representation of the Embreys. Rather, his conduct was characterized by a self-defeating ineptitude and procrastination bordering on paralysis. He failed to notify the court of his current mailing address when he moved his office to Abingdon. He missed every discovery due date and court-ordered deadline. He allowed the date for designation of experts to pass without any action on his part to select or designate this crucial witness. Although the notice of the mediation session was mistakenly sent to Respondent\u2019s predecessor, a modicum of attention on Respondent\u2019s part could have avoided the failure to appear for the mediation. The Scheduling Order and Order for Civil Mediation was signed on October 5, 2009. Respondent and his opponent\u2019s paralegal narrowed the possible dates for the mediation session to two in their email exchange on November 18, 2009. The date chosen by the mediator for the mediation session was March 3, 2010. Had Respondent been working diligently to insure compliance with the October 5th Sched<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"517\">*517</page-number>uling Order and Order for Mediation, he would have noticed that he had never received the mediation date in the ensuing three months and would have inquired of the court, the mediator, or his opponent\u2019s paralegal what date had been chosen. Given the mediator\u2019s error in misdirecting the notice, were this Respondent\u2019s only failure in the Embreys\u2019 case, it would have been excusable. In light of all the other failures to take any meaningful action on his clients\u2019 behalf, the failure to calendar and appear at the mediation session can only be regarded as another example of Respondent\u2019s neglect of the Embreys\u2019 case.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b547-4\">Further, Respondent failed to respond to Ms. Duvall\u2019s repeated requests for a settlement demand in November and December of 2009 and January of 2010, a request that she repeated even after Respondent\u2019s fatal failure to designate an expert to support his clients\u2019 claim. Certainly, at that juncture, settlement was Respondent\u2019s only hope to salvage any recovery for his clients, yet he failed to respond. In addition to his failure to comply with discovery, he failed to respond to GM\u2019s Motion to Compel and for Sanctions, Motion for Summary Judgment, or the second Motion for Sanctions. Even when at last he took the belated action of filing the Motion to Vacate Judgment, by waiting to file until more than thirty days after the entry of the judgment, he significantly limited the grounds on which the court could grant relief. Respondent\u2019s conduct violated Rule 1.3.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b547-5\">Rule 1.4 Communication</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b547-6\">During his representation of the Embreys, Respondent repeatedly failed to inform them of important developments in their case. He failed to inform them of GM\u2019s discovery requests and the mediation date, which then denied them the opportunity to participate in the preparation and presentation of their case. He failed to inform them of the consequences of his discovery lapses, which were the filing of the motions to compel, for sanctions and for summary judgment. He repeatedly misled Ms. Embrey with promises that he would answer the discovery. He failed to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"518\">*518</page-number>report the missed deadline for expert designation and the impact of the loss of this crucial witness on the overall prospect for success in the case. He failed to communicate GM\u2019s multiple requests for a settlement demand. After the case was dismissed and the Motion to Vacate was denied, he failed to candidly inform Ms. Embrey that he would not seek reconsideration, but instead promised further action for six months.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b548-4\">As a result of Respondent\u2019s failure to provide basic information to the Embreys about the status of their case, they were unable to make informed decisions about the representation. Respondent\u2019s conduct violated Rule 1.4(a) and (b).</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b548-5\">Rule 8.4 Misconduct</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b548-6\">Respondent\u2019s violations of the Maryland Lawyers\u2019 Rules of Professional Conduct establish a violation of Rule 8.4(a).</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b548-7\">Respondent\u2019s misrepresentations to the Circuit Court for Frederick County in the Motion to Vacate Judgment due to Fraud, Mistake, or Irregularity which he filed on June 7, 2010, establish a violation of Rule 8.4(c). Respondent stated that \u201cPlaintiffs counsel and Plaintiff never received documentation of any kind from the court and only a few of Defendant\u2019s filings.\u201d Contrary to Respondent\u2019s statement in the Motion to Vacate, Respondent stipulated that he received all of GM\u2019s discovery requests and GM\u2019s Motion to Compel and for Sanctions at his correct mailing address in Abingdon. As demonstrated by the certificates of service, GM\u2019s Motion for Summary Judgment and Motion for Sanctions were also sent to Respondent at his correct mailing address. Respondent further stated in the Motion to Vacate that he \u201cdid not become aware of the judgment and sanctions until the early part of May, 2010.\u201d Ms. Embrey\u2019s testimony that she discussed the dismissal of her ease with Respondent in mid-April is corroborated by her email exchange with Respondent on April 20, 2010, in which Respondent promised to send a later email with the motion to vacate attached. Respondent also stipulated that he in<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"519\">*519</page-number>formed Ms. Embrey of the dismissal sometime in April, 2010.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b549-5\">The Embreys\u2019 case was dismissed due to Respondent\u2019s complete failure to respond to any of the discovery requests or motions of his opponent. Whatever the merits of the case might have been, Respondent\u2019s dereliction of his duty to his clients was the sole reason they lost the opportunity to have their day in court. Respondent\u2019s conduct was clearly prejudicial to the administration of justice in violation of Rule 8.4(d).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b549-6\">\n<em>Representation of Ms. Cleaves</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b549-7\">In April 2009, Respondent answered a Craigslist advertisement regarding the closure of the law practice of Ralph Byrd, whom this Court disbarred on April 14, 2009. <em>See Attorney Grievance Comm\u2019n v. Byrd, </em>408 Md. 449, 970 A.2d 870 (2009). At their first meeting Respondent learned of Byrd\u2019s disbarment, but, notwithstanding this knowledge, entered into a professional relationship with him wherein Respondent would act as counsel of record for Byrd\u2019s clients in exchange for Byrd\u2019s mentorship in the law of debt collection and Byrd\u2019s promise to refer clients to Respondent in the future. Respondent was to share in none of Byrd\u2019s fees.</p>\n<p id=\"b549-8\">On April 16, 2009, two days after his disbarment, Byrd sent a proposed retainer agreement to Lily Cleaves, who was a defendant in a credit card debt collection action brought by Pasadena Receivables, Inc. (\u201cPasadena\u201d). Ms. Cleaves returned the signed retainer on April 22, 2009, agreeing to be represented by \u201cone of our affiliated attorneys.\u201d At this time, Ms. Cleaves paid Byrd $3,000 in attorney\u2019s fees, which he deposited in his own attorney trust account.</p>\n<p id=\"b549-9\">In May 2009, Byrd obtained from Ms. Cleaves her signature on a <em>pro se </em>Demand for Jury Trial, which he subsequently filed, to transfer her case from the District Court of Maryland in Montgomery County to the Circuit Court for Montgomery County. Respondent entered his appearance in the case on June 15, 2009. Respondent never sent Ms. Cleaves a letter <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"520\">*520</page-number>notifying her that he was assuming the representation, and the two did not enter into a separate retainer agreement. Respondent testified that it was his general practice when taking over Byrd\u2019s cases to conduct a telephone conference call with Byrd and the client, during which Byrd would explain that Respondent was his \u201csubsequent counsel.\u201d Respondent testified that he believed he had followed this practice with Ms. Cleaves. The hearing judge did not seem to credit this testimony, referring to Respondent\u2019s \u201cvague belief\u2019 that he participated in a conference call with Ms. Cleaves.</p>\n<p id=\"b550-5\">On June 15, 2009, Respondent filed a general denial in response to Pasadena\u2019s complaint. In his answer, he did not assert the defense of lack of authority to sue in a representative capacity. Respondent later characterized this decision as one of \u201ctrial strategy.\u201d On July 15, 2009, Pasadena filed a Motion for Summary Judgment. Respondent did not file timely an opposition but did file a Motion to Excuse Late Filing, stating that he had been away on vacation.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> This Motion to Excuse was granted. His opposition, thus accepted by the court, included an affidavit prepared by Byrd, who sent the document on his own letterhead to Ms. Cleaves for signature and had her return it to him.</p>\n<p id=\"b550-6\">Respondent\u2019s written filing raised two arguments, but at the October 20, 2009, hearing on the Motion for Summary Judgment, he attempted to raise a third. The judge hearing the motion refused to hear this third argument, as well as argument on the defense of Pasadena\u2019s lack of authority to sue in a representative capacity, treating that argument as waived because Respondent did not raise it in his answer. The judge also found that Ms. Cleaves\u2019s affidavit did not generate a genuine issue of material fact. Consequently, the Circuit Court granted summary judgment in favor of Pasadena and entered a judgment of $19,750 against Ms. Cleaves on October <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"521\">*521</page-number>26, 2009. Respondent filed a Motion for Reconsideration on November 5, 2009, but the court denied that motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b551-4\">On April 21, 2010, Respondent noted an appeal to the Court of Special Appeals. His notice of appeal, however, did not include the information report required by Maryland Rule 8-205(b). The Court of Special Appeals issued a Show Cause Order directing Respondent to file the information report or offer an explanation as to why his appeal should not be dismissed, but he did neither.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> As a result, the Court of Special Appeals dismissed Ms. Cleaves\u2019s appeal on July 12, 2010.</p>\n<p id=\"b551-5\">When he took over Ms. Cleaves\u2019s case, Respondent did not arrange to transfer the attorney\u2019s fees she had paid to Byrd from Byrd\u2019s attorney trust account to his own. As Respondent prepared to note the appeal to the Court of Special Appeals, Byrd recognized the impropriety of drawing the filing fee from his own account and so transferred to Respondent the $190 Ms. Cleaves had sent to him for that purpose.</p>\n<p id=\"b551-6\">On November 23, 2010, the Circuit Court granted a writ of garnishment to enforce Pasadena\u2019s judgment against Ms. Cleaves. Ms. Cleaves stated in a <em>pro se </em>Motion and Declaration to Vacate Judgment she filed on March 28, 2012, that she was not aware Respondent was her attorney until her wages were garnished.</p>\n<p id=\"b551-7\">Although Respondent testified that he in no \u201cway, shape, or form asked or allowed Mr. Byrd to practice law with\u201d him, the hearing judge found that their correspondence during the pendency of Ms. Cleaves\u2019s case reveals that Byrd assisted Respondent in drafting and filing court documents. For example, in preparing Ms. Cleaves\u2019s Motion for Reconsideration on the evening of November 5, 2009, Respondent sent Byrd a draft via email, requesting proposed changes. Three hours later, Byrd replied to the email stating that he had <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"522\">*522</page-number>\u201cModified it a little and filed it.\u201d Although Byrd afforded Respondent no opportunity to review what he filed in the Circuit Court under Respondent\u2019s own name, Respondent did not admonish Byrd in any way for this conduct nor did he restrict Byrd\u2019s participation in the matter <em>going forward.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b552-4\">Based upon these factual findings, the hearing judge concluded that Respondent violated MLRPC 1.1 (competence); 1.3 (diligence); 5.5(a) (unauthorized practice of law); and 8.4(a) and (d) (misconduct). The hearing judge explained her conclusions, as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b552-5\">Rule 1.1 Competence</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b552-6\">Respondent failed to provide competent representation to Ms. Cleaves in violation of Rule 1.1. Specifically, Respondent failed to act with the requisite legal knowledge, skill, thoroughness and preparation reasonably necessary for the representation. In the Answer he filed on behalf of Ms. Cleaves, Respondent failed to raise the issue of Pasadena\u2019s authority to sue in a representative capacity by specific negative averment as required by Rule 2-323(f), thereby admitting Pasadena\u2019s ownership of Ms. Cleaves\u2019 credit account for the purpose of the collection action. Respondent deliberately chose not to raise this required negative defense in the Answer as a matter of trial strategy. As a result of Respondent\u2019s waiver of this issue, the judge refused to consider this potentially meritorious argument at the hearing on the Motion for Summary Judgment.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b552-7\">When Respondent appealed the judgment against Ms. Cleaves, he failed to file the information report required by Rule 8-205. Respondent\u2019s admission at his deposition that he did not know the information report was required contradicts his claim at the hearing on January 29, 2013, that he had paid careful attention to filing the brief and all related documents and that he did not know what had happened to the report. Whether due to Respondent\u2019s lack of legal knowledge of the appellate rules, or to his lack of thoroughness in preparing the appeal, his client lost the opportunity <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"523\">*523</page-number>to have the appellate court review the ruling by the trial court which Respondent claimed had been in error.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b553-4\">Rule 1.3 Diligence</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b553-5\">Respondent failed to act with diligence and promptness in representing Ms. Cleaves in violation of Rule 1.3. The Dismissal Order from the Court of Special Appeals specifically refers to an earlier show cause order issued on June 21, 2010, which directed Respondent to file the necessary information report by July 6, 2010, or show cause in writing why the appeal should not be dismissed. In effect, this June 21st order gave Respondent an extension until July 6, 2010, to file the information report which had actually been due on May 3, 2010. Respondent took no action and the appeal was dismissed.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b553-6\">Rule 5.5(a) Unauthorized Practice of Law</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b553-7\">Respondent\u2019s willful disregard of the facts in front of him enabled Mr. Byrd to continue to function as an attorney and to retain unearned fees after his disbarment on April 14, 2009.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b553-8\">Respondent learned that Mr. Byrd had been disbarred when he met with Mr. Byrd the first time in April of 2009. When Respondent entered his appearance on behalf of Ms. Cleaves on June 15, 2009, he had an obligation to review the entire court file, including the Complaint and the request for jury trial. The Complaint was filed on March 10, 2009, thirty-four days before Mr. Byrd\u2019s disbarment. The only document which had been filed on behalf of Ms. Cleaves at the time of Respondent\u2019s entry was the <em>pro se </em>Demand for Jury Trial which was filed immediately after Mr. Byrd\u2019s letter on May 5, 2009, within three weeks after Mr. Byrd\u2019s disbarment and certainly after Respondent\u2019s initial meeting \u25a0with Mr. Byrd. This information alone was sufficient for Respondent to conclude as an attorney and as an officer of the court that Mr. Byrd had not earned the full fee in Ms. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"524\">*524</page-number>Cleaves\u2019 case before he was disbarred, if, indeed, he had earned any of it.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b554-4\">When Respondent became Ms. Cleaves\u2019 attorney, particularly in light of Mr. Byrd\u2019s disbarment, he had an affirmative duty to enter into a separate retainer agreement with Ms. Cleaves which would have made it clear to her, as the client, that Respondent (and not Mr. Byrd) was her attorney. Even in the face of evidence which showed that it was impossible for Mr. Byrd to have legitimately earned and disbursed Ms. Cleaves\u2019 full retainer at that juncture in the case, Respondent failed to demand that Mr. Byrd surrender Ms. Cleaves\u2019 payments for safekeeping in Respondent\u2019s trust account. Although Respondent testified that he \u201crelied\u201d on Mr. Byrd\u2019s retainer agreement with Ms. Cleaves rather than executing a separate representation agreement with her, Respondent never requested or received a copy of Mr. Byrd\u2019s retainer agreement. Had Respondent demanded a copy of Mr. Byrd\u2019s retainer agreement, he would immediately have seen that it was executed April 22, 2009, after Mr. Byrd\u2019s disbarment. Respondent also failed to fulfill his affirmative duty to his client Ms. Cleaves to inform her of her right to a refund of the payment to his disbarred predecessor and the fact that Mr. Byrd was now no longer able to represent her or to legitimately earn any of the fee which had been paid.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b554-5\">Despite Respondent\u2019s vague belief that he participated with Mr. Byrd in two conference calls with Ms. Cleaves, the record demonstrates that Respondent permitted Mr. Byrd to conduct all client contact, including obtaining Ms. Cleaves\u2019 signed affidavit, advising her of court outcomes and accepting her check (made payable to Mr. Byrd) for the appellate costs. The record supports Ms. Cleaves\u2019 statement in her <em>pro se </em>Motion and Declaration to Vacate Judgment, which she filed on March 28, 2012, that she \u201chad never been contacted by Mr. Bocchino regarding [her] case.\u201d That is because Respondent permitted Mr. Byrd to perform all the functions of an attorney in terms of client contact, and to profit from that relationship by keeping Ms. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"525\">*525</page-number>Cleaves\u2019 retainer, while Respondent simply represented her in court.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b555-4\">Although Respondent professed ignorance of Mr. Byrd\u2019s unauthorized practice of law, the facts were before him. As he acknowledged in testimony and as was evident in the email exchanges, Mr. Byrd still considered Ms. Cleaves to be his client and he was anxious to insert himself to direct Respondent\u2019s representation. Knowing this, Respondent nonetheless surrendered client contact to Mr. Byrd. Mr. Byrd\u2019s refusal to transfer any of the fee paid by Ms. Cleaves, his email that he had \u201cmodified and filed\u201d the Motion for Reconsideration (an email which prompted no action on Respondent\u2019s part), the use of a fax account which continued to identify Mr. Byrd as Esquire, Mr. Byrd\u2019s acceptance of a client\u2019s check made payable to him, all put Respondent on notice that Mr. Byrd continued to conduct himself as an attorney in Ms. Cleaves\u2019 case.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b555-5\">Respondent testified that he did not employ Mr. Byrd in any capacity. Had he employed Mr. Byrd as his non-legal assistant, these red flags would have required immediate action to control a subordinate who had overstepped the appropriate boundary between para-legal assistance and the practice of law. Respondent described a relationship in which Mr. Byrd was the mentor and Respondent was the apprentice. The facts of this case establish by clear and convincing evidence that Mr. Byrd was continuing to practice law through Respondent, by drafting, modifying and signing court documents in Respondent\u2019s name, by conducting all client contact through which information was given and legal counsel was provided, and by retaining all fees for those services, fees which could not possibly have been earned until after the date of Mr. Byrd\u2019s disbarment.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b555-6\">Although Respondent received over thirty cases from Mr. Byrd, Mr. Byrd retained control of the cases and possession of the files until they required action that only an attorney in good standing could provide, such as a court appearance or a signature on discovery or a motion. Respondent testified that \u201cwhat Mr. Byrd may or may not have been <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"526\">*526</page-number>doing with his clients/former clients, I don\u2019t know. I have my suspicions but that is not something I would be willing to testify to in court.\u201d Respondent opined that it was not his job, but the Attorney Grievance Commission\u2019s, to police Mr. Byrd\u2019s conduct. In fact, however, Respondent\u2019s willingness to step into each case when some crucial juncture was reached, rather than assuming responsibility for all of the cases shortly after Mr. Byrd\u2019s disbarment, allowed Mr. Byrd to practice law, not with his own license, but with Respondent\u2019s.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b556-4\">Respondent\u2019s conduct violated Rule 5.5(a).</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b556-5\">Rule 8.4 Misconduct</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b556-6\">Respondent\u2019s violations of the Maryland Lawyers\u2019 Rules of Professional Conduct, both directly and through the acts of Mr. Byrd, constitute a violation of Rule 8.4(a) and Respondent is, therefore, in violation of Rule 8.4(a).</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b556-7\">Respondent failed in his duty to inform Ms. Cleaves of her right to a refund of the unearned retainer held by Mr. Byrd, to execute a separate representation agreement with Ms. Cleaves so that she would have a clear understanding of who was (and who was not) her attorney, and to require Mr. Byrd to transfer the unearned funds to Respondent\u2019s trust account. His failure to follow basic rules of procedure in properly asserting Ms. Cleaves\u2019 negative defense to the collection action and in filing the information report eliminated Ms. Cleaves\u2019 opportunity for a full evidentiary hearing at the trial level and for consideration of her appeal on the merits thereafter. Respondent not only enabled, but relied on Mr. Byrd in his unauthorized practice of law. Respondent\u2019s conduct was prejudicial to the administration of justice in violation of Rule 8.4(d).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b556-8\">The hearing judge did not sustain Petitioner\u2019s allegations of violations of 1.4 and 1.15. She explained her conclusions, as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b556-9\">Rule 1.4 Communication</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b557-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"527\">*527</page-number>Neither Ms. Cleaves nor Mr. Byrd testified at the hearing on January 29, 2013. The Court, therefore, lacks clear and convincing evidence of the timing and content of the information Mr. Byrd conveyed to Ms. Cleaves regarding the progress of the case. Petitioner has failed to meet its burden of proof and the Court draws no conclusions of law regarding this Rule 1.4 in Ms. Cleaves\u2019 complaint.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b557-5\">Rule 1.15 Safekeeping Property</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b557-6\">This rule addresses the lawyer\u2019s obligation to safeguard a client\u2019s property that is in the lawyer\u2019s possession. The only funds or property belonging to Ms. Cleaves which Respondent had in his possession was the $190.00 she sent to Mr. Byrd in April of 2010, which was transferred to Respondent to cover costs associated with the appeal (the filing fee and the deposit on the transcript). As the appeal was filed, it would appear that these funds were used on the client\u2019s behalf for their intended purpose. The Court finds that the Petitioner has failed to meet its burden with regard to Rule 1.15.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b557-7\">Respondent\u2019s failure to require Mr. Byrd to transfer Ms. Cleaves\u2019 retainer into Respondent\u2019s escrow account is more properly addressed ... under Rule 5.5(a).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b557-8\">\n<em>Mitigation</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b557-9\">As a result of his military service in the Gulf War, Respondent suffers from post-traumatic stress disorder and depression. He presented as mitigation evidence a disability report prepared in 2008 by his psychiatrist, Dr. C. William Hicks, III, who believed that, at that time, Respondent was \u201cunable to engage productively in his work as an attorney for the State of Maryland. His diminished concentration, [an extreme lack of energy], markedly diminished motivation and poor self esteem, all would contribute to a recurrence of his poor work performance.\u201d With respect to the future, it was Dr. Hicks\u2019s \u201creasonable clinical expectation that if [Respondent] were to continue treatment, [he] would be able to return to gainful employment.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b558-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"528\">*528</page-number>Respondent testified that during the period at issue in these proceedings, his \u201coverwhelming feelings of worthlessness and helplessness\u201d manifested themselves in \u201cthings ... slip[ping] through the cracks.\u201d He \u201cwouldn\u2019t correct [his mistakes],\u201d he testified, because he \u201cwouldn\u2019t know where to start to correct them.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b558-4\">The hearing judge made the following mitigation finding:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b558-5\">Respondent\u2019s testimony and exhibits establish by a preponderance of the evidence that he has suffered from depression, anxiety and post-traumatic stress disorder for over twenty years. These chronic conditions have contributed to his inability to perform his duties as an attorney in the past and resulted in his medical retirement from his position as an assistant attorney general in 2008. The reported symptoms of these conditions \u2014 procrastination, feelings of helplessness, inability to make decisions, avoidance of confrontation and sense of being overwhelmed \u2014 can certainly be observed in Respondent\u2019s complete neglect of the Embrey case and his dependence on Mr. Byrd in the Cleaves case.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b558-6\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b558-7\">In attorney discipline proceedings, this Court \u201chas original and complete jurisdiction and conducts an independent review of the record.\u201d <em>Attorney Grievance Comm\u2019n v.

We address these exceptions in turn.</p>\n<p id=\"b559-6\">\n<em>Exceptions Regarding Representation of the Embreys</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b559-7\">Respondent\u2019s first exception concerns the hearing judge\u2019s factual finding that he \u201cincorrectly\u201d stated in the Embreys\u2019 Motion to Vacate the date on which he filed his Line to Enter Change of Address. Respondent characterizes this error as \u201can obvious typographical one\u201d that cannot support a conclusion that he attempted to mislead the Circuit Court. Insofar as Respondent challenges the hearing judge\u2019s characterization of his statement as \u201cincorrect,\u201d this factual finding is clearly supported by the record: Respondent filed his Line to Change Address on October 27, 2009, and stated in the Motion to Vacate that he filed it on October 27, 2010. If Respondent\u2019s exception represents a challenge to the hearing judge\u2019s reliance on this incorrect statement in concluding that he made misrepresentations to the court in violation of MLRPC 8.4(c), it is not clear that the hearing judge did rely on this fact. The judge enumerated two misrepresentations Respondent made to the court in the Motion to Vacate, but did not include this statement on that list. Accordingly, this exception is overruled.</p>\n<p id=\"b559-8\">Respondent\u2019s next exceptions concern the hearing judge\u2019s conclusion that he violated MLRPC 1.4(a) and (b). Specifically, he excepts to the hearing judge\u2019s findings that he <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"530\">*530</page-number>\u201crepeatedly failed to inform [the Embreys] of important developments in their case\u201d and failed to \u201cadequately respond\u201d to Ms. Embrey\u2019s requests for information.</p>\n<p id=\"b560-4\">Respondent first contends that there was no need for him to communicate with the Embreys \u201cfor certain periods of time,\u201d but maintains that he did inform them of the pendency of discovery and discuss with them the scheduling of depositions and mediation. The record belies Respondent\u2019s assertion that he kept the Embreys apprised of significant developments in the case as they occurred. Although Respondent was not required to inform his clients of each passing pre-trial deadline, he needed to inform the Embreys of missed deadlines that carried potential adverse consequences, the action he was taking to avoid such consequences, and any negative consequences that did come to pass. His failure to observe discovery deadlines resulted in GM\u2019s filing a dispositive motion. This was a significant development in the case, but it was not until late April that Respondent informed Ms. Embrey that GM had moved for dismissal, which, by that point, the court had granted. This constitutes a failure to \u201ckeep the client reasonably informed about the status of the matter.\u201d MLRPC 1.4(a)(2). Consequently, we overrule Respondent\u2019s exception.</p>\n<p id=\"b560-5\">Respondent next asserts that he \u201cdid in fact respond to the client.\u201d Instead of offering support for this assertion, he attempts to shift the blame onto the client, characterizing Ms. Embrey\u2019s attempts to contact him as \u201cbordering] on harassment.\u201d We, however, direct our focus squarely on Respondent\u2019s conduct.</p>\n<p id=\"b560-6\">Respondent admits to refusing to speak with Ms. Embrey on the telephone. Over email he was no more responsive. After the February 15, 2010, depositions, at which she learned that Respondent had failed to provide responses to GM\u2019s interrogatories, Ms. Embrey began sending Respondent emails seeking reassurance that he was paying proper attention to her case, but he did not reply to these messages. After learning in April 2010 that the court had granted GM\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"531\">*531</page-number>Motion to Dismiss, Ms. Embrey sent Respondent emails requesting updates on the \u201creinstatement\u201d of her case, and he answered few.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> When Respondent did reply, often after great delay or only upon prompting by staff at Kahn,<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> he would pledge to send Ms. Embrey copies of court pleadings or take certain legal action on the Embreys\u2019 behalf,<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> and he rarely kept these promises. This conduct constitutes a failure to \u201cpromptly comply with reasonable requests for information.\u201d MLRPC 1.4(a)(3). Accordingly, we overrule Respondent\u2019s exception.</p>\n<p id=\"b561-4\">Respondent further excepts to the hearing judge\u2019s factual finding that he failed to communicate opposing counsel\u2019s requests for a settlement demand to his clients. This finding is clearly supported by the record, chiefly Respondent\u2019s own admission that he made a deliberate decision not to engage in settlement discussions. Respondent did not articulate this challenge as an exception to the hearing judge\u2019s legal conclusion that his failure to convey the request for settlement demand amounts to a violation of MLRPC 1.4. If, however, this was his intention, we would overrule such an exception. Though he describes his decision as a \u201ctypical defense strate<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"532\">*532</page-number>gy in litigation,\u201d his failure to relay to his clients GM\u2019s request regarding settlement implicates the Embreys\u2019 ability to \u201cmake informed decisions regarding the representation.\u201d MLRPC 1.4(b). It may well have been a valid strategy not to present to GM the amount for which the Embreys would have settled their lawsuit, but Respondent was duty-bound to inform his clients that GM sought to engage in settlement negotiations. We therefore overrule this exception.</p>\n<p id=\"b562-4\">Respondent\u2019s fifth and sixth exceptions concern the hearing judge\u2019s legal conclusion that he violated MLRPC 8.4(c). He first excepts to the hearing judge\u2019s conclusion that he made a misrepresentation to the court when he stated in his Motion to Vacate that he \u201cnever received documentation of any kind from the court and only a few of Defendant\u2019s filings.\u201d Respondent claims that this statement was \u201ca truthful one.\u201d Because he failed to file a Line notifying the court of his Abingdon address, despite his mistaken belief that he or Kahn had done so, all court notices went to his Baltimore address and needed to be forwarded by the Postal Service. He therefore claims he \u201creceived none of them in a timely fashion.\u201d Similarly, while GM sent communications to his Abingdon address, he claims he did not receive these in a timely manner either.</p>\n<p id=\"b562-5\">The hearing judge correctly concluded that this was a false representation in violation of MLRPC 8.4(c). Respondent stated in the Motion to Vacate that he \u201cnever\u201d received court documents. He now asserts in his exceptions that he received none of them \u201cin a timely fashion.\u201d Respondent further stated in the Motion to Vacate that he received \u201conly a few of Defendant\u2019s filings,\u201d but admitted during this attorney discipline proceeding that he was aware of every pleading GM filed. The record reflects that Respondent knew of each deadline in the Embreys\u2019 case. His language in the Motion to Vacate, however, suggests to the court that he did not comply with the Scheduling Order because the inefficiency of the Postal Service left him unaware of his obligations. This amounts to misrepresentation.</p>\n<p id=\"b563-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"533\">*533</page-number>Respondent next excepts to the hearing judge\u2019s conclusion that he made a misrepresentation to the court when he stated in the Motion to Vacate that he did not become aware of the dismissal of his clients\u2019 case until May 2010. He now states that the date on which he became aware of the judgment is \u201cunknown,\u201d and argues that the hearing judge should not have viewed this \u201cfailure to recall the exact timing\u201d as an attempt to mislead the court. Respondent\u2019s own correspondence, however, demonstrates that he knew of the judgment on April 20, 2010, at the latest. Whether a \u201cfailure to recall the exact timing\u201d or \u201can attempt to mislead the court,\u201d his statement about the date on which he became aware of the dismissal is a misrepresentation. Consequently, we overrule Respondent\u2019s exceptions and sustain the hearing judge\u2019s conclusion that he violated MLRPC 8.4(c).</p>\n<p id=\"b563-4\">\n<em>Exceptions Regarding Representation of Ms. Cleaves</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b563-5\">Respondent\u2019s seventh exception concerns the hearing judge\u2019s factual finding that Byrd conducted all client contact in Respondent\u2019s representation of Ms. Cleaves. Specifically, Respondent challenges the hearing judge\u2019s partial reliance upon Ms. Cleaves\u2019s statement in her <em>pro se </em>Motion and Declaration to Vacate that she \u201chad never been contacted by Mr. Bocchino.\u201d Ms. Cleaves did not testify at Respondent\u2019s hearing, and Respondent argues that the hearing judge\u2019s acceptance of her statement in the absence of an opportunity for cross-examination violates his due process rights.</p>\n<p id=\"b563-6\">Even without Ms. Cleaves\u2019s motion, the record supports a finding that Byrd did conduct all client contact in this matter. At his deposition in these proceedings, when Bar Counsel asked whether he had informed Ms. Cleaves in writing that he would be acting as Byrd\u2019s subsequent counsel, Respondent testified,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b563-7\">No, I did not. I did not write to her to tell her that.... I\u2019ll just describe what generally happened because I don\u2019t recall what happened in any specific case because obviously we\u2019re talking about events that occurred quite some time ago. But what generally happened is ... Mr. Byrd would come <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"534\">*534</page-number>to my office and he and I would have a conference call with the client where he would explain that I was going to be subsequent counsel because he was no longer able to prosecute cases in Maryland courts.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b564-4\">When Bar Counsel asked whether such a conference call took place with Ms. Cleaves, Respondent testified, \u201cI believe it did, but I can\u2019t say with 100 percent certainty that we did that, but that was almost always what we did, so I\u2019m assuming that we did also do that with Ms. Cleaves, yes.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b564-5\">Yet, after Respondent entered his appearance, Ms. Cleaves continued to communicate with Byrd concerning her case. \u201cWhen an affidavit was necessary to accompany a Circuit Court pleading, Byrd, not Respondent, contacted Ms. Cleaves to obtain her signature. Later, she sent the amount of the Court of Special Appeals filing fee to Byrd, not Respondent, who, as the attorney of record, would pay the filing fee out of his attorney trust account. Finally, when she was considering filing a complaint against Respondent with the Attorney Grievance Commission, Ms. Cleaves still chose to convey this information to Byrd, not Respondent. Based on this record, it was not clear error for the hearing judge to find that Byrd conducted all client contact, and Respondent\u2019s exception is thus overruled.</p>\n<p id=\"b564-6\">Finally, Respondent excepts to the hearing judge\u2019s legal conclusion that he assisted Byrd in the unauthorized practice of law, in violation of MLRPC 5.5(a). The hearing judge found that, upon entering his appearance, Respondent should have reviewed the file in Ms. Cleaves\u2019s case, which would have led him to the conclusion that Byrd had not earned any fees in the case prior to his disbarment. It was Respondent\u2019s \u201cwillful disregard of the facts in front of him,\u201d the hearing judge stated, that allowed Byrd \u201cto continue to function as an attorney.\u201d Respondent argues that it is \u201cunfair and unreasonable ... to hold [him] responsible\u201d for Byrd\u2019s conduct prior to the moment when Respondent entered his appearance in Ms. Cleaves\u2019s case. He contends that he did not allow Byrd to continue to practice law.</p>\n<p id=\"b565-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"535\">*535</page-number>The record reveals that Respondent indeed assisted Byrd in his unauthorized practice of the law. \u201cThe goal of the unauthorized practice statute is achieved, in general, by emphasizing the insulation of the unlicensed person from the public and from tribunals such as courts....\u201d <em>In re Application of R.G.S., </em>312 Md. 626, 638, 541 A.2d 977 (1988). To the extent it was within his power, Respondent failed to insulate either the court or Ms. Cleaves from Byrd.</p>\n<p id=\"b565-4\">Essentially, Respondent allowed Byrd to practice in the Circuit Court under Respondent\u2019s license. After Pasadena filed its Motion for Summary Judgment, Respondent emailed Byrd on August 6, 2009, requesting a template of a memorandum in opposition, stating \u201cI can do the drafting on the motion.\u201d Byrd replied, \u201cI will prepare it and file it.\u201d Respondent presented no evidence that he instructed Byrd not to do so, and this type of conduct recurred. After the court granted summary judgment in favor of Pasadena, Byrd directed Respondent in an email which arguments he should include in the Motion for Reconsideration. Respondent drafted the motion and sent it to Byrd that night, along with the message, \u201cTake a look at what I\u2019ve written and see if it makes sense to you. Get back to me if you think it needs modification or change.\u201d Instead of responding with suggestions, Byrd replied, \u201cModified it a little and filed it.\u201d Respondent presented no evidence that he reproached Byrd for taking this action. He thus allowed Byrd to draft, edit, and file pleadings submitted under Respondent\u2019s name.</p>\n<p id=\"b565-5\">With respect to the client, Respondent stood by as Byrd held himself out to Ms. Cleaves as her attorney. Respondent did not enter into a separate retainer agreement with Ms. Cleaves, and Byrd continued to conduct all client contact, as discussed <em>supra. </em>These facts support the conclusion that Respondent assisted Byrd in his unauthorized practice of law, in violation of MLRPC 5.5(a), and we therefore overrule Respondent\u2019s eighth and final exception.</p>\n<p id=\"b565-6\">Having determined that the hearing judge\u2019s findings of fact were supported by clear and convincing evidence and that her <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"536\">*536</page-number>resulting conclusions of law are supported by those facts, we conclude that Respondent violated MLRPC 1.1, 1.3, 1.4(a) and (b), and 8.4(a), (c), and (d) with respect to the Embreys, and 1.1, 1.3, 5.5(a), and 8.4(a) and (d) with respect to Ms. Cleaves.</p>\n<p id=\"b566-4\">IV.</p>\n<p id=\"b566-5\">We now turn to the sanction for Respondent\u2019s professional misconduct. Maryland Rule 16-759(c) lists the dispositions the Court of Appeals may order: \u201c(1) disbarment, (2) suspension, (3) reprimand, (4) inactive status, (5) dismissal of the disciplinary or remedial action, or (6) a remand for further proceedings.\u201d Petitioner recommends, pursuant to Maryland Rule 16-758(b), indefinite suspension as the proper sanction in the present case, citing the proposition that while persistent client neglect may be grounds for disbarment, if such conduct is committed by an attorney suffering from a disability, a lesser sanction may be warranted. Respondent recommends a public reprimand, along with a practice monitor and \u201cperiodic reports of his psychiatric conditions to Bar Counsel from his service providers.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b566-6\">In determining the appropriate sanction, we bear in mind that the purpose of a sanction is not to punish the delinquent attorney, but to protect the public\u2019s confidence in the legal profession. <em>Attorney Grievance Comm\u2019n v.

Moreover, this Court has consistently regarded neglect and inattentiveness to a client\u2019s interests to be [an ethical violation] warranting the imposition of some disciplinary sanction.\u201d <em>Attorney Grievance Comm\u2019n v. Mooney, </em>359 Md. 56, 76, 753 A.2d 17 (2000) (quoting <em>Attorney Grievance Comm\u2019n v. Montgomery, </em>296 Md. 113, 120, 460 A.2d 597 (1983)). Indeed, this Court takes a dim view of such conduct:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b567-5\">It is clear ... that willful and flagrant neglect of a client\u2019s affairs is, in and of itself, the kind of misconduct by an attorney which can lead to disbarment. As is obvious, the nature and persistence of this kind of inattention may and does vary. Sometimes it is generated by an outside stimulus amounting to a physical or mental disability which upon proper treatment can be overcome. In such cases this Court has not been reluctant to impose indefinite suspension and to reinstate when the Court has been satisfied that the disability has been overcome or by other means removed.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b567-6\">In recent years, however, we have noticed too many instances when lawyers have agreed to represent clients and accepted fees, in part or in whole,<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> only to completely neglect these same legal problems, causing the same clients emotional distress, financial loss, or other varying kinds of inconvenience. More often than not, these situations have been exacerbated by the lack of respect and attention extended to the courts as evidenced by the failure to file timely pleadings or to make appearances as scheduled before the court to enable proceedings to be conducted. It seems to us that this kind of persistent conduct is evidence of a lawyer\u2019s disregard of his obligation.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b567-7\"><em>Attorney Grievance Comm\u2019n v.

Myers, </em>333 Md. 440, 449, 635 A.2d 1315 (1994). For that reason, \u201c[cjonduct involving fraud, dishonesty, or deceit will ordinarily result in disbarment.\u201d <em>Attorney Grievance Comm\u2019n v.

Dishonesty is not the flagship violation in Respondent\u2019s case, however. Although he did make misrepresentations to the Circuit Court for Frederick County in the Motion to Vacate he filed on behalf of the Embreys, Respondent did not engage in a \u201cpattern of ... deceitful conduct over an extensive period of time.\u201d <em>Attorney Grievance Comm\u2019n v.

When they are suspended or disbarred, they may not practice law except under [limited circumstances]. Members of the Maryland bar have their own duty under MLRPC not to assist suspended or disbarred lawyers in making a sham of the suspension or disbarment.

In cases where there has been a finding that the attorney suffered from a serious mental or physical illness, this Court \u201crarely impose[s] the ultimate sanction of disbarment absent misappropriation of funds. The weight we accord to a physical or mental illness depends in part on whether the condition was causally related to the attorney\u2019s misconduct....\u201d <em>West, </em>378 Md. at 417, 836 A.2d 588. As we are in agreement with the hearing judge that Respondent\u2019s mitigation evidence \u201chelps to explain [his] failures,\u201d we do not believe disbarment to be the appropriate sanction for Respondent\u2019s misconduct.
