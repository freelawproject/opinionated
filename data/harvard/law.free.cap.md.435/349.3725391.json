(Retired).</author>\n<p id=\"b381-15\">In this case, we must decide whether a party \u201cincurs\u201d litigation costs within the meaning of Maryland Rule 1-341 when those costs are paid, not by that party, but by an <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"352\">*352</page-number>insurance company on his or her behalf. We shall affirm the judgment of the Court of Special Appeals and hold that, regardless of who pays the attorney fees or of whether the fees are covered and paid pursuant to an insurance policy, attorney fees and litigation expenses are \u201cincurred\u201d within the meaning of Rule 1-341 when the party becomes subject to, or liable for, the services and expenses. In the case of attorney fees, that is when the services are rendered.</p>\n<p id=\"b382-5\">The events out of which this case arose began in February 2000 with a dispute between neighbors: Robert Greenfield (\u201cMr. Greenfield\u201d), one of the respondents in this case, filed criminal charges against Michael Worsham, the petitioner, alleging second-degree assault and malicious destruction of property.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> A jury acquitted the petitioner of malicious destruction of property and was unable to reach a verdict as to the assault count. The petitioner subsequently filed a six-count complaint in the Circuit Court for Hartford County against Greenfield, his wife Romualda Greenfield (\u201cMrs. Greenfield\u201d), an additional respondent in this case, (the \u201crespondent\u201d), and two neighbors, alleging, <em>inter alia, </em>defamation, false light/invasion of privacy, civil conspiracy, and aiding and abetting. In addition, the petitioner alleged, against Mr. Greenfield only, malicious prosecution.</p>\n<p id=\"b382-6\">Prior to trial, the Greenfields and the neighbors moved for summary judgment, which the Circuit Court granted with regard to all claims except the count for malicious prosecution. Summary judgment was granted as to that count at the close of the petitioner\u2019s case against Mr. Greenfield. The petitioner noted an appeal of the judgment thus entered to the Court of Special Appeals, which affirmed the judgment of the trial court. The petitioner\u2019s petition for a writ of certiorari, filed with this Court, was denied. <em>Worsham v. Greenfield, </em>411 Md. 599, 984 A.2d 244 (2009).</p>\n<p id=\"b383-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"353\">*353</page-number>Following our denial of \u201ccert,\u201d the respondents filed a \u201cMotion for Award of Attorney\u2019s Fees and Costs,\u201d pursuant to Maryland Rule 1-341,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> seeking recovery of the attorneys fees, expenses, and costs associated with the litigation initiated by the petitioner. They alleged that their insurance carrier, Erie Insurance Exchange (\u201cErie Insurance\u201d), had expended $38,693.00 in attorney\u2019s fees and $1,571.48 in related costs, in defending Mr. and Mrs. Greenfield. As such, the respondents candidly acknowledged that their attorney\u2019s fees, expenses, and other costs had been paid by Erie Insurance. The Circuit Court denied the respondents\u2019 motion with respect to Mr. Greenfield, but granted it with regard to the respondent, Mrs. Greenfield, finding that she had been joined in the action without \u201csubstantial justification.\u201d The court noted that, between the time that the suit was filed and the date when judgment was granted in favor of Mrs. Greenfield, there were sixty-two docket entries, manifesting \u201cwhat can only be characterized as a form of \u2018scorched earth\u2019 litigation primarily by Mr. Worsham.\u201d The court added that it could find \u201cno evidence\u201d suggesting \u201cany involvement at all by Mrs. Greenfield in any of the events\u201d relevant to the petitioner\u2019s complaint, and that the petitioner failed to present any \u201ccolorable reason to name Mrs. Greenfield as a defendant in Counts Three \u2014 Six.\u201d For this reason, the court concluded that it was \u201cbeyond doubt that there was no substantial justification for naming Mrs. Greenfield as a defendant in Counts Three\u2014 Six.\u201d The court then awarded the respondent $3,613.13 for the costs attributable to her defense. It found that Mrs. Greenfield had \u201cincurred\u201d the costs of her defense within the meaning of Rule 1-341, notwithstanding the fact that Erie Insurance had paid all of the costs of litigation on her behalf.</p>\n<p id=\"b384-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"354\">*354</page-number>The Court of Special Appeals affirmed the trial court\u2019s award. It concluded:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b384-4\">\u201cWhile the nature of the offending conduct is relevant to the amount, the amount must be compensatory and not designed to punish the offending party. In the case before us, the fees, costs, and expenses were in fact paid on Mrs. Greenfield\u2019s behalf, and the amount of the award was premised on reimbursement of the amount paid.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b384-5\">The court went on to note:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b384-6\">\u201c[T]he purpose of Rule 1-341 compels us to conclude that fees, costs, and expenses incurred by a party opposing a proceeding that was maintained in bad faith or without substantial justification are awardable even though paid by the party\u2019s insurer. The Rule clearly applies to \u2018any proceeding\u2019 and clearly applies to parties who maintain or defend such a proceeding.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b384-7\">The petitioner urges us to reverse the judgment of the Court of Special Appeals, primarily arguing that the respondent did not \u201cincur\u201d costs under Rule 1-341, because those costs were covered and paid by the respondent\u2019s insurer Erie Insurance.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Thus, he submits, permitting a party to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"355\">*355</page-number>recover when that party did not pay the cost of litigation him or herself would conflict with the purpose of Rule 1-341; rather than compensating the affected litigant, it would allow the recovering party to profit from the litigation. The petitioner argues further that permitting an insurance company to recover pursuant to the Rule would conflict with the Rule\u2019s purpose by conferring a benefit upon a non-party to the suit.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b385-5\">The respondents see the issue quite differently. They argue that Rule 1-341 applies no matter who pays the costs and expenses, and regardless of whether the party seeking the award actually paid the costs of litigation themselves. This is so, they assert, because the Rule\u2019s primary purpose is to deter abuse of the judicial system against the initiation or maintenance of frivolous actions. That purpose, they further submit, indicates that the focus of the Rule is on the actions of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"356\">*356</page-number>party responsible for the abusive litigation, not on who pays the costs associated with that litigation nor on the actions of the aggrieved party who seeks reimbursement by raising the issue. Thus, they conclude that the petitioner\u2019s focus on the respondent and, in particular, the manner in which she paid the costs and fees, is irrelevant for the purposes of the Rule. We agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b386-5\">As we have seen, the issue we must resolve is the meaning of \u201cincur,\u201d as used in Rule 1-341. This is an issue of Rules construction, to which we apply the same long-standing canons which we utilize in interpreting statutes. <em>State v. Romulus, </em>315 Md. 526, 533, 555 A.2d 494, 497 (1989); <em>Greco v. State, </em>347 Md. 423, 428-29, 701 A.2d 419, 421 (1997). As with the construction of a statute, our primary objective in this analysis is to \u201cascertain and effectuate the real and actual intent\u201d of the promulgating body, here this Court, the Maryland Court of Appeals. <em>Lockshin v. Semsker, </em>412 Md. 257, 274, 987 A.2d 18, 28 (2010) (citing <em>Board of Education v. Zimmer-Rubert, </em>409 Md. 200, 214, 973 A.2d 233, 241 (2009)). We begin with a review of the language of the Rule, allowing the \u201cordinary, popular understanding of the English language [to] dictate[] interpretation of its terminology.\u201d <em>Kushell v. Dep\u2019t of Natural Resources, </em>385 Md. 563, 576, 870 A.2d 186, 193 (2005) (citing <em>Deville v. State, </em>383 Md. 217, 223, 858 A.2d 484, 487 (2004)). If the rule is unambiguous, the inquiry ends and \u201cwe do not need to resort to the various, and sometimes inconsistent, external rules of construction,\u201d as the Court is \u201cpresumed to have meant what it said and said what it meant\u201d when it adopted the Rule. <em>Arundel Corp. v. Marie, </em>383 Md. 489, 502, 860 A.2d 886, 894 (2004) (quoting <em>Witte v. Azarian, </em>369 Md. 518, 525, 801 A.2d 160, 165 (2002)). If, however, the Rule is ambiguous, subject to \u201ctwo or more reasonable alternative interpretations,\u201d <em>Price v. State, </em>378 Md. 378, 387-88, 835 A.2d 1221, 1226 (2003), \u201cit then becomes necessary to survey the surrounding circumstances in which the rule was drafted to accurately discern the intent of the Court of Appeals in promulgating that rule.\u201d <em>Greco, </em>347 Md. at 428, 701 A.2d at 421.</p>\n<p id=\"b387-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"357\">*357</page-number>Upon conducting this analysis, the Court of Special Appeals concluded that \u201cthe rule is ambiguous as to whether a party must actually have paid the attorney\u2019s fees, costs, and expenses in order to have incurred them or whether they were paid by a collateral source.\u201d <em>Worsham v. Greenfield, </em>187 Md.App. 323, 332, 978 A.2d 839, 844 (2009). While we agree with the intermediate appellate court\u2019s ultimate conclusion regarding the Rule, we do not concur with this particular conclusion. On the contrary, we believe that the plain language of Rule 1-341 is unambiguous.</p>\n<p id=\"b387-4\">Rule 1-341 provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b387-5\">\u201cIn any civil action, if the court finds that the conduct of any party in maintaining or defending any proceeding was in bad faith or without substantial justification the court may require the offending party or the attorney advising the conduct or both of them to pay the adverse party the costs of the proceeding and the reasonable expenses, including reasonable attorney\u2019s fees, <em>incurred </em>by the adverse party in opposing it.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b387-6\">(Emphasis added). \u201cIncur\u201d is defined by the Merriam-Webster Dictionary as \u201cto become liable or subject to.\u201d It is similarly defined by Black\u2019s Law Dictionary as \u201c[t]o suffer or bring on oneself (a liability or expense).\u201d Black\u2019s Law Dictionary 771 (7th ed.1999). To be \u201cliable,\u201d in turn, is defined by the Merriam-Webster Dictionary as being \u201cobligated according to law or equity,\u201d and by Black\u2019s Law Dictionary as being \u201c[rjesponsible or answerable in law; legally obligated.\u201d Black\u2019s Law Dictionary 925-926 (7th ed.1999).</p>\n<p id=\"b387-7\">A party becomes \u201cliable\u201d for, \u201csubject to,\u201d \u201csuffer[s]\u201d or \u201cbring[s] on oneself\u2019 the costs of litigation, including reasonable attorney\u2019s fees, when that party acts in response to a claim brought against him or her by marshaling financial and human resources. The legal responsibility to pay the cost of the defense exists quite apart from the method he or she chooses to use to discharge that responsibility. To be sure, there are a variety of ways in which a litigant may discharge the financial obligation required to defend against a frivolous claim, including contracting for the purchase, and use, of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"358\">*358</page-number>liability insurance. Whatever method is chosen, however, does not undermine or diminish that litigant\u2019s responsibility, financially or otherwise, for his or her own defense. He or she will have become \u201cliable,\u201d and thus the expenses \u201cincurred\u201d the moment that the necessity for the expense has been realized and its amount fixed or becomes ascertainable. Having insurance to pay those expenses is merely one way of discharging the litigant\u2019s obligation or liability; it is a way of financing the costs. Paying those costs directly is another.</p>\n<p id=\"b388-5\">This view is confirmed by our precedents. Although we have not addressed the exact question before us previously, this Court has considered what it means for a party to \u201cincur\u201d a cost. In <em>Dutta v. State Farm Insurance Company, </em>363 Md. 540, 769 A.2d 948 (2001), the Maryland Code (1996, 2006 Repl.Vol.) \u00a7 19-505 of the Insurance Article<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> was at issue. Section 19-505(b)(2)(i) of that Article requires personal injury protection (PIP) coverage to include \u201cpayment of all reasonable and necessary expenses that arise from a motor vehicle accident and that are <em>incurred </em>within 3 years after the accident.\u201d (emphasis added). When the plaintiff in <em>Dutta </em>was injured in an automobile accident, he possessed coverage under two insurance plans, a private automobile policy with State Farm Insurance Company (\u201cState Farm\u201d),<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> and an employee health policy. <em>Dutta, </em>363 Md. at 542, 769 A.2d at 949. The plaintiffs employee coverage paid the costs of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"359\">*359</page-number>medical treatment for his injuries; however, when the plaintiff filed with State Farm a claim requesting reimbursement for those costs paid by the health insurer, his request was denied on the grounds that, because he did not pay them, the plaintiff had never \u201cincurred\u201d those costs. <em>Id. </em>at 546, 769 A.2d at 951. This Court disagreed, holding that \u201cwhen [plaintiff] was admitted to [the] [h]ospital, received medical treatment and signed an agreement to pay expenses, an expense was incurred on his behalf upon which the granting of PIP [Personal Injury Protection] benefits was both appropriate and mandatory,\u201d given the language of \u00a7 19-505. <em>Id. </em>at 563, 769 A.2d at 961. In so holding, we agreed with the rationale offered by <em>Shanafelt v. Allstate Insurance Co., </em>217 Mich.App. 625, 552 N.W.2d 671 (1996), in which the Michigan Court of Appeals considered the definition of \u201cincur\u201d in a similar statute<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> and concluded that a party \u201cincurs\u201d medical treatment costs regardless of whether those costs were paid by a third party. We explained:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b389-4\">\u201c \u2018The primary definition of the word \u2018incur\u2019 is \u2018to become liable for.\u2019 Obviously, [the] plaintiff became liable for her medical expenses when she accepted medical treatment. The fact that [the] plaintiff had contracted with a health insurance company to compensate her for her medical expenses, or to pay directly the health care provider on her behalf, does not alter the fact that she was obligated to pay those expenses. Therefore, one may not reasonably maintain that plaintiff did not incur expenses.\u2019 \u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b389-5\"><em>Dutta, </em>363 Md. at 562, 769 A.2d at 961 (quoting <em>Shanafelt, </em>552 N.W.2d at 676) (citations omitted).<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b390-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"360\">*360</page-number><em>Weichert Co. of Md., Inc. v. Faust, </em>419 Md. 306, 19 A.3d 393 (2011), involving the situation in which the costs of representation are covered by a third party, is to similar effect. There, we considered the interpretation of a contractual provision, which provided that, if either party to the contract brought an action to enforce its rights under the contract, the prevailing party \u201cwould be entitled to reimbursement for the attorney\u2019s fees that party incurred.\u201d 419 Md. at 324, 19 A.3d at 404. The appellant in that case asserted that because the opposing party\u2019s attorney\u2019s fees were covered by her new employer, she did not, in fact, \u201cincur\u201d the fees, and, thus, she was not entitled to be recover those fees under the terms of the contract. <em>Id. </em>at 314-15, 19 A.3d at 398. We rejected that argument, <em>id. </em>at 323, 19 A.3d at 404, holding that \u201cgenerally, attorney\u2019s fees include those fees for legal services <em>incurred on behalf of a client.\u201d Id. </em>at 331, 19 A.3d at 408 (emphasis added). We cited our opinions in <em>Dutta </em>and our analysis in <em>Henriquez v. Henriquez, </em>413 Md. 287, 992 A.2d 446 (2010).</p>\n<p id=\"b390-4\">The pertinent statutory provision at issue in <em>Henriquez </em>did not contain the term \u201cincur.\u201d <em>Henriquez </em>concerned the interpretation of Maryland Code (1984, 2006 Repl.Vol.) \u00a7 12-103 of the Family Law Article,<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> which permits fee-shifting in child <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"361\">*361</page-number>custody cases. <em>Henriquez, </em>413 Md. at 290, 992 A.2d at 448. In that case, a non-profit legal services organization provided Mrs. Henriquez with pro bono representation in her divorce and custody proceedings. <em>Id. </em>at 290, 992 A.2d at 449. Mrs. Henriquez prevailed at trial, and subsequently submitted a fee-petition pursuant to \u00a7 12-103. <em>Id. </em>at 292-93, 992 A.2d at 450. On appeal of the trial court\u2019s judgment granting her request, Mr. Henriquez, the opposing party, argued that attorney\u2019s fees could only be awarded \u201cwhen a party actually incurs expenses for legal representation.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 297, 992 A.2d at 452. We disagreed. <em>Id. </em>at 302, 992 A.2d at 455-56. Although noting that \u00a7 12-103 did not contain the word \u201cincur,\u201d and, so, we did not have to interpret the meaning of the word \u201cincur,\u201d as used by Mr. Henriquez, <em>id. </em>at 299, 992 A.2d at 454, we affirmed the judgment of the Court of Special Appeals, and concluded that \u201cpursuant to the plain language of the statute, there is no per se bar to awarding attorney\u2019s fees to a party who is represented by a non-profit organization that provides the party with free legal representation.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 302, 992 A.2d at 456 (quoting <em>Henriquez, </em>185 Md.App. 465, 478, 971 A.2d 345, 353 (2009)).</p>\n<p id=\"b391-5\">As we have seen, ambiguity requires that there be two or more possible alternative interpretations of the language in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"362\">*362</page-number>question for the purposes of rule construction. <em>See Price v. State, </em>378 Md. 378, 387-88, 835 A.2d 1221, 1226 (2003). Our review of the language of Rule 1-341, considered in it\u2019s ordinary usage and definitions, and our relevant precedents, convinces us that \u201cincurred,\u201d as used in that Rule, refers simply to the necessity that the party against whom frivolous litigation has been initiated and/or maintained was required to take on the expenses that arose as a result of that litigation. It addresses, in other words, the situation in which the party adversely affected by frivolous litigation must expend money to oppose it. The petitioner would have us conflate the creation of that obligation, which occurs, for instance, when any legal services are rendered, with the discharge, or reconciliation of the obligation, which occurs when the account is settled. Rule 1-341 is concerned with the existence of the former, the \u201cincurring\u201d of the cost. The Rule does not address the discharge of the obligation through the payment of those costs. The former obligation exists and belongs to the prevailing party initially and, at the very least, regardless of the manner in which it is ultimately discharged. Thus, we cannot conceive of alternative interpretations of the language, and certainly none which would, or should, lead us to a different conclusion.</p>\n<p id=\"b392-4\">Our conclusion is consistent with those reached by other courts addressing this issue or a similarly relevant issue. In <em>Pelletier v. Zweifel, </em>987 F.2d 716, 717 (11th Cir.1993), the Eleventh Circuit mandated that the District Court \u201caward [the defendant] a sum of money [against plaintiff and his attorney] that will compensate him for the attorney\u2019s fees, litigation expenses, and costs he incurred in defending this lawsuit in the district court and in prosecuting his motion for Rule 11 sanctions.\u201d The plaintiff argued on remand that, under the Eleventh Circuit\u2019s mandate, the defendant was not entitled to recover because he failed to \u201cincur\u201d any litigation expenses by allowing his insurance company to pay the entirety of his litigation expenses. <em>Id. </em>at 717. The District Court accepted the plaintiffs argument and the defendant appealed. <em>Id. </em>In <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"363\">*363</page-number>reversing the District Court\u2019s decision, the Eleventh Circuit panel explained:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b393-4\">\u201cIt is of no moment that [defendant] purchased insurance to cover the expense of defending claims such as those that [plaintiff] brought against him. [Plaintiff and his counsel] are not entitled to \u201cfree\u201d violations of Rule 11 because of [the defendant\u2019s] prudence in investing in insurance coverage. Nor is it of any moment that [defendant\u2019s] insurance carrier has not been made a party in this appeal. [Plaintiffs and counsel\u2019s] argument that [the defendant] cannot recover what he may have to pay over to the insurance company in satisfaction of its subrogation rights is patently frivolous.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b393-5\"><em>Id. </em>at 718-719.</p>\n<p id=\"b393-6\">In <em>Peddlers Square, Inc. v. Scheuermann, </em>766 A.2d 551 (D.C.2001), the District of Columbia Court of Appeals considered whether a trial court had properly imposed sanctions under the District of Columbia\u2019s Rule 11 provisions. In that case, the defendant filed a motion requesting sanctions under Rule 11 on the basis that the plaintiff filed suit against him without substantial justification. <em>Id. </em>at 555. Noting that the defendant\u2019s malpractice carrier paid approximately 80% of the defendant\u2019s litigation costs, the plaintiff argued that \u201cit should not be sanctioned for attorney\u2019s fees that [the defendant] was not required to pay personally.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 555-56, 558. The court, relying on the Eleventh Circuit\u2019s reasoning in <em>Pelletier, </em>affirmed the trial court\u2019s award of the defendant\u2019s litigation costs, including that portion paid by the defendant\u2019s malpractice insurance coverage.</p>\n<p id=\"b393-7\">In <em>Ed A. Wilson, Inc. v. General Services Administration, </em>126 F.3d 1406 (Fed.Cir.1997), the Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit considered whether an insured \u201cincurred\u201d legal fees when its insurer was responsible for paying those fees. That court concluded that, despite the fact that the defendant maintained insurance coverage, the defendant had indeed incurred litigation expenses. <em>Wilson </em>involved the Equal Access to Justice Act, which provided:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b394-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"364\">*364</page-number>\u201c(a)(1) An agency that conducts an adversary adjudication shall award, to a prevailing party other than the United States, fees and other expenses incurred by that party in connection with that proceeding, unless the adjudicative officer of the agency finds that the position of the agency was substantially justified or that special circumstances make an award unjust. Whether or not the position of the agency was substantially justified shall be determined on the basis of the administrative record, as a whole, which is made in the adversary adjudication for which fees and other expenses are sought.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b394-5\">5 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 504 (1994). Relying on Federal Circuit precedent, the <em>Wilson </em>Court explained, \u201cattorney fees are incurred by a litigant \u2018if they are incurred in his behalf, even though he does not pay them.\u2019 \u201d <em>Wilson </em>at 1409 (quoting <em>Goodrich v. Department of the Navy, </em>733 F.2d 1578 (Fed.Cir.1984)). The <em>Wilson </em>Court added:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b394-6\">\u201cDenying a small business, which in its keen acumen has obtained insurance to insulate itself from liability for accidents during contract performance, and thus from potential insolvency, an award of fees for the attorney services that it procured as part of its policy would thwart the Act\u2019s purpose of deterring unreasonable governmental action.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b394-7\">\n<em>Id.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b394-8\">We find the reasoning in each of the above cases to be instructive and persuasive. Furthermore, those cases represent merely a sampling of the cases in which courts across the country have held, or implied, that the mere fact that an insurer covers all or part of the litigation expense does not, in and of itself, mean that the insured fails to incur litigation expenses. See e.g., <em>Holmes v. California State Auto. Ass\u2019n, </em>135 Cal.App.3d 635, 185 Cal.Rptr. 521 (1982) (plaintiff \u201cat the time of her admission to the hospital expressly undertook personal liability for the expenses about to be incurred. When a legal obligation to pay was created upon the rendition of services, the Medicare agreement became applicable and the hospital was bound by its commitment \u2018not to charge,\u2019 i.e., not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"365\">*365</page-number>to enforce against the patient liability for the costs incurred by the patient\u201d); <em>Scott v.

Indianapolis Hebrew Congregation, Inc., </em>779 N.E.2d 52 (Ind.Ct.App.2002) (holding that a trial court may award attorney\u2019s fees regardless of whether those fees have been directly billed to and paid by a party; the critical inquiry is whether a party has incurred attorney fees); Michigan, <em>BJ\u2019s &amp; Sons Construction Company, Inc. v.

State, </em>360 Md. 250, 265, 757 A.2d 796, 804 (2000). Indeed, \u201c[w]e have often noted that looking to relevant case law and appropriate secondary authority enables us to place the rule in question in the proper context,\u201d and to confirm our interpretation. <em>Id. </em>(citing <em>Adamson v. Correctional Medical Serv. Inc., </em>359 Md. 238, 251-52, 753 A.2d 501, 508 (2000)); <em>State v. Brantner, </em>360 Md. 314, 323, 758 A.2d 84, 89 (2000). Thus, we shall look to the history of the Rule, as well as the case law interpreting it, for confirmation of our interpretation.</p>\n<p id=\"b395-6\">The text of Rule 1-341 and its predecessor Rule 604b, the Rule\u2019s history as reflected in the minutes of the Maryland Court of Appeals Standing Committee on Rules of Practice and Procedure (the Rules Committee), along with the interpretation Maryland appellate courts have given it, clearly and unambiguously indicate its purpose. Contrary to the petitioner\u2019s assertion that the Rule\u2019s purpose is to compensate the party who is the object and victim of the abusive litigation, that purpose reveals that the Rule is intended, instead, to serve as a deterrent against frivolous litigation. The Rule\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"366\">*366</page-number>deterrence function would be subverted if a party who clearly abused the judicial process was shielded from any legal ramifications prescribed by Rule 1-341, simply because the party injured by his or her conduct possesses, and uses, liability insurance to cover his or her litigation expenses or is fortunate enough to have some third person pay such expenses.</p>\n<p id=\"b396-5\">On July 18, 1956, this Court accepted the proposal of the Rules Committee and codified the procedural rules, effective January 1, 1957, following a nine-year codification project undertaken to simplify Maryland procedural law and increase its accessibility. Included in that codification, the 1956 version of the Maryland Rules, was Rule 604b, the predecessor to Rule 1-341.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b396-6\">The Rules Committee\u2019s understanding that the purpose of Rule 604b was a deterrent one was reflected in its minutes of February 22, 1961, when it declined to adopt a proposed change to the Maryland Rules that would have required that frivolous defenses to motions for summary judgment carry an automatic penalty of costs. The Rules Subcommittee on Chapter 600, chaired by Judge Gilbert Prendergast,<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> rejected <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"367\">*367</page-number>the proposal. Report of Subcommittee on Reconsideration of Chapter 600 (Nov. 18,1960). That decision was upheld by the entire Rules Committee, which found that the issue of restraining \u201cdishonest litigants\u201d in summary judgment proceedings was already accomplished through Rule 604b. <em>See </em>Rules Committee meeting minutes (Feb. 22,1961).</p>\n<p id=\"b397-4\">In January 1964, the Rules Subcommittee on Chapter 600 again reviewed the scope and purpose of Rule 604b, while considering changes to, or deletion of the rule and, at that time, explicitly stated its view that the Rule was \u201cdeterrent\u201d focused. It concluded:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b397-5\">\u201c[ejxperience demonstrates that the Rule is rarely invoked but its continuing existence could well serve as a deterrent to parties or counsel who may be disposed to bring frivolous suits. The subcommittee sees no reason why the existing Rule should be changed in any respect.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b397-6\">Report of Subcommittee on Chapter 600 (Jan. 31, 1964). This conclusion, too, was endorsed, soon thereafter, by the Rules Committee. Rules Committee meeting minutes (July 2, 1964).</p>\n<p id=\"b397-7\">The Rules Committee has more recently evinced its understanding that the Court of Appeals adopted Rule 1-341 with the intent that it serve as a deterrent to abusive litigation. In 1991, the Rules Committee, in a joint effort -with the Maryland State Bar Association, formed the Ad Hoc Committee on Management of Litigation, the purpose of which was to \u201cdevelop recommendations designed to aid the judiciary in regaining control over litigation and better managing it.\u201d Rules Committee meeting minutes at 15 (Sept. 11, 1992). The Ad Hoc Committee\u2019s study led to the appointment of a Rules Subcommittee on Management of Litigation, which considered various changes to Rule 1-341, and ultimately recommended that the Rule be abolished.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> Rules Committee meeting minutes, Ap<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"368\">*368</page-number>pendix 2 (Sept. 11, <em>1992). In </em>considering the <em>Subcommittee\u2019s </em>recommendations, the Rules Committee specifically addressed the purpose of Rule 1-341, noting that, while the scope of Rule 1-341 and its predecessor, Rule 604b, had been limited by courts to compensation, the Rule had originally been enacted to deter abusive litigation. Rules Committee meeting minutes at 26 (Nov. 20, 1992)<footnotemark>13</footnotemark>. The Rules Committee determined, \u201c[t]he goal of sanctions is accomplished by compensating the other party.\u201d Rules Committee meeting minutes at 26 (Nov. 20,1992).<footnotemark>14</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b398-5\">Case law interpreting the Rule provides further support for the intent demonstrated by its history. Indeed, Maryland courts have repeatedly emphasized the deterrent purpose of Rule 1-341. In <em>Zdravkovich v. Bell Atlantic-Tricon Leasing Corp., </em>for instance, this Court made that purpose clear, stating:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b398-6\">\u201cThe imposition of sanctions is to deter litigation that clearly lacks merit ... Rule 1-341 is not intended to simply <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"369\">*369</page-number>shift litigation expenses based on relative fault. Its purpose is to deter unnecessary and abusive litigation.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b399-5\">323 Md. 200, 212, 592 A.2d 498, 504 (1991). This is echoed in decisions by the Court of Special Appeals. <em>Major v. First Va. Bank-Central Md., 97 </em>Md.App. 520, 530, 631 A.2d 127 (1993) (\u201cThis Court has emphasized that Rule 1-341 is not a sanctions rule in the same sense as Rule 11. It does not provide for a monetary award to punish a party that misbehaves. The rule\u2019s purpose is to put the wronged party in the same position as if the offending conduct had not occurred.\u201d); <em>Legal Aid Bureau, Inc. v. Farmer, </em>74 Md.App. 707, 722, 539 A.2d 1173 (1988) (\u201cRule 1-341 represents a limited exception to the general rule that attorney\u2019s fees are not recoverable by one party from an opposing party. It is intended to prevent parties and lawyers from abusing the judicial process by filing or defending actions and proceedings \u2018without substantial justification\u2019 or \u2018in bad faith.\u2019 \u201d); <em>Bastian v. Laffin, </em>54 Md.App. 703, 719, 460 A.2d 623 (1983) (\u201c[T]he rule is intended to compensate a defendant as well as a plaintiff for the consequences of the defined types of improper conduct by an opponent\u201d). <em>See also Brady v. Hartford Ins. Co., </em>610 F.Supp. 735, 744 (D.Md.1985) (Rule 1-341 was \u201cdesigned to control the conduct of the litigation and the counsel appearing before the court .... Its effect is to streamline the litigation process by lessening frivolous claims and defenses. Imposition of attorney\u2019s fees awards against counsel is but one tool in the hands of the court by which it can control its docket.\u201d) (internal quotation marks omitted) (internal citations omitted); <em>In re Chaires, </em>249 B.R. 101, 105 (Bankr.D.Md.2000) (Rule 1-341 \u201cmakes the adverse party whole with respect to the cost of a proceeding which should not have been endured, and it is, in that sense, compensatory.... [The rule] is intended to eliminate abuses in the judicial process.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b399-6\">It is clear from the history of the Rule, and the case law interpreting it, that Rule 1-341 was intended to function primarily as a deterrent. We believe that requiring an aggrieved party to pay their litigation costs directly in order to recover under the Rule would contravene and, more to the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"370\">*370</page-number>point, undermine this purpose; the mere possession of insurance by the aggrieved party or the willingness of a third person, for whatever reason, to pay the freight would effectively eliminate the Rule\u2019s ability to discourage groundless litigation.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> This policy concern is a further basis for the interpretation we reach.</p>\n<p id=\"b400-5\">In sum, we consider it irrelevant, in the context of Rule 1-341, whether the cost to a party of defending him or herself against abusive litigation is covered by an outside source or a third party. Accordingly, we hold that a party compelled to defend him or herself against abusive litigation may recover the costs associated with that litigation under Rule 1-341, regardless of whether those costs were paid by that party or by an insurance company or by another third person on the party\u2019s behalf.</p>\n<p id=\"b400-6\">JUDGMENT AFFIRMED, WITH COSTS.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b382-7\">. A jury acquitted the petitioner of the malicious destruction of properly charge and was hung on the assault charge, as to which the trial court declared a mistrial.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b383-5\">. Maryland Rule 1-341 provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b383-6\">\"In any civil action, if the court finds that the conduct of any party in maintaining or defending any proceeding was in bad faith or without substantial justification the court may require the offending party or the attorney advising the conduct or both of them to pay to the adverse party the costs of the proceeding and the reasonable expenses, including reasonable attorney's fees, incurred by the adverse party in opposing it.\u201d</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b384-8\">. The petitioner primarily relies on <em>Seney v. Seney, </em>97 Md.App. 544, 631 A.2d 139 (1993), for support of this proposition. In <em>Seney, </em>however, Mrs. Seney and her counsel had entered into a contingency fee agreement and that was the basis for the court\u2019s finding that Mrs. Seney had never incurred any attorney\u2019s fees. From that finding, the court concluded that Mrs. Seney could not recover under Rule 1-341, which requires a \"direct correlation between the monetary sanction imposed and the actual fees incurred by the opposing party.\u201d The respondent thus contends that <em>Seney </em>is inapplicable to the case <em>sub judice </em>since the respondent and her counsel did not have a contingency fee agreement, and the respondent did, in fact, incur fees. We agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b384-9\">The petitioner cites several other cases that he believes supports this proposition. He overlooks, however, the fact that those cases construed Rule 1-341 specifically in contrast to Federal Rule 11, which has a much broader application. <em>See U.S. Health, Inc. v. State, </em>87 Md.App. 116, 129-130, 589 A.2d 485, 492 (1991) (observing that Federal Rule 11 permits punitive awards whereas Rule 1-341 awards only reasonable costs and fees actually incurred); <em>Major v. First Virginia Bank-Central Maryland, </em>97 Md.App. 520, 533-534, 631 A.2d 127, 133-134 (1993). <em>See also Beery v. Maryland Medical Laboratory, Inc., </em>89 Md.App. 81, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"355\">*355</page-number>102, 597 A.2d 516, 526-527 (1991) (explaining only that punitive awards must be related to actual, not speculative, costs).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b385-7\">. The petitioner argues, as a threshold matter, that Mrs. Greenfield failed to file her Rule 1-341 motion in a timely manner. He emphasizes, in that regard, that Mrs. Greenfield submitted her motion after this Court denied the respondent\u2019s Petition for Certiorari, rather than doing so immediately after the Circuit Court granted her motion for summary judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b385-8\">The petitioner failed to raise the question of timeliness in his Petition for Certiorari. As such, it was not noted as an issue for the resolution of which \u201ccert\u201d was granted in this case. We note that, in \"reviewing a decision rendered by the Court of Special Appeals ... the Court of Appeals ordinarily will consider only an issue that has been raised in the petition for certiorari[.]\u201d Maryland Rule 8 \u2014 131(b). Furthermore, the petitioner\u2019s argument that Mrs. Greenfield failed to file her Rule 1-341 motion in a timely manner is without merit, in any event. The only time limitation under the Rule arises from equitable considerations, and in particular, would be concerned with whether the non-moving party has been prejudiced. <em>See Litty v. Becker, </em>104 Md.App. 370, 376, 656 A.2d 365, 368 (1995). In this case, the respondent\u2019s Rule 1-341 Motion was filed less than two weeks after this Court denied the petitioner's petition for writ of certiorari, and the petitioner does not argue that he was prejudiced by the timing of the motion. For this reason, we agree with the opinion of the Circuit Court that \"[tjhere is no evidence of any kind that Mr. Worsham has in any way been prejudiced by the fact that the Greenfields waited until the case was finally concluded to file their request. In point of fact, it made good sense for them to do so.... Clearly the Motion was filed in a timely fashion.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b388-6\">.

There are three primary differences between Rule 604b and current Rule 1-341. An award under Rule 1-341 is discretionary <em>(\"may </em>require ...\u201d), whereas an award under Rule 604b was mandatory <em>(\"shall </em>require ... \u201d). <em>See </em>Rules Committee meeting minutes (Aug. 1, 1983). Additionally, Rule 1-341 allows imposition of an award against counsel of the offending party, rather than exclusively against the offending party under Rule 604b. <em>See </em>Rules Committee meeting minutes (Sept. 22, 1983). Rule 1-341 also lacks a reference to \"delay,\u201d included in Rule 604b, as this category was considered to be encompassed within \"bad faith.\u201d <em>See </em>Rules Committee meeting minutes (Sept. 22, 1983).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"11\">\n<p id=\"b396-10\">.
