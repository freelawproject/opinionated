(retired).</author>\n<p id=\"b95-7\">In 1968, this Court was presented with the question of whether, under the Workmen\u2019s Compensation Act, Maryland Code (1957, 1967 Cum. Supp.), Art. 101, the predecessor of The Workers\u2019 Compensation Act, Maryland Code (1991, 2008 Repl. Vol.) Title 9 of the Labor and Employment Article (L &amp; E), \u201can award of disability under [\u00a7] 36(4), concerning other cases, may be combined with an award under [\u00a7] 36(3), concerning specific injuries, so as to bring both awards within the purview of the serious disability provisions of [\u00a7] 36(4a) and [\u00a7] 36(3a).\u201d <em>Barnes v. Ezrine Tire Co., </em>249 Md. 557, 558, 241 A.2d 392, 393 (1968). Art. 101, \u00a7 36(3), like its successor today, L &amp; E \u00a7 9-627(a)-(h), prescribed a schedule of benefits and the \u201cweeks\u201d of compensation for specific injuries resulting in permanent partial disability. Section 36(4) provided, as its successor L &amp; E \u00a7 9-627(k) also does, that all other cases of permanent partial disability are to be determined from the percentage by which the industrial use of the body is impaired as a result of the injury.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Sections 36(3a) and 36(4a) provided for an increased rate and amount of compensation for those persons suffering a \u201cserious disability,\u201d which they both defined. Sections 36(3a) and 36(4a)<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> provided:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b96-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"66\">*66</page-number>\u201c(3a) (Permanent partial disability-Specific injuries)-Serious disability. \u2014 A person who receives under subsection (3) of this section an award for a period of one hundred and seventy-five weeks or more is thereby considered to have a serious disability. He automatically shall be entitled to (in addition to the award under subsection (3)) an extra award of a number of weeks equal to one third (computed to the nearest whole number) of the number of weeks awarded under subsection (3); and the award of compensation to him in no case shall exceed forty dollars per week; and as to him the maximum limitation of $12,500 shall not apply. \u201c(4a) (Permanent partial disability-Other cases)-Serious disability. \u2014 A person who receives under subsection (4) of this section an award equal in total to forty per centum or more of $12,500 is thereby considered to have a serious disability. He automatically shall be entitled to (in addition to the award under subsection (4)) an extra award of a number of weeks equal to one third (computed to the nearest whole number) of the number of weeks awarded under subsection (4); and the award of compensation to him in no case shall exceed forty dollars per week; and as to him the maximum limitation of $12,500 shall not apply.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b96-4\">The Workers\u2019 Compensation Commission (\u201cCommission\u201d), reading the sections together, combined the awards so that the claimant qualified for serious disability under both \u00a7 36(3a) and \u00a7 36(4a), the effect of which was increased compensation. Barnes, 249 Md. at 560, 241 A.2d at 394. The Baltimore City Court<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> granted summary judgment in favor of the employer and insurer, and we affirmed. <em>Id. </em>at 563, 241 A.2d at 396. In so doing, we rejected the claimant\u2019s argument that there was a conflict or ambiguity in the compensation law, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"67\">*67</page-number>and held that there is \u201cno basis for combining a non-qualifying award under one subsection with a qualifying award under the other subsection so as to make both of them qualify.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 562, 241 A.2d at 395. We explained:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b97-4\">\u201cThe arguments made by the claimant fly in the face of the legislative intent. Chapter 322 was enacted \u2018to create certain new categories (emphasis ours) of persons having a serious disability.\u2019 Subsection (3a) sets forth the conditions necessary for an injury to qualify as a serious disability under 36(3) relating to specific injuries. Likewise, subsection (4a) sets forth the conditions necessary to qualify as a serious disability under 36(4) concerning other injuries. In so doing, the legislature intentionally created two new categories. Had the legislature intended that (3a) and (4a) should be read together, it undoubtedly would have enacted only one additional subsection to s 36 with regard to serious disabilities. Furthermore, the qualifying conditions under 36(3a) and 36(4a) are not identical. In order for a claimant to qualify for a serious disability award under (3a), he must have been awarded compensation for 175 weeks or more under 36(3). And in order for him to qualify under (4a), the claimant must have been awarded compensation for 200 weeks or more (i.e., an award equal to 40% or more of $12,500 at $25 a week).\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b97-5\"><em>Barnes, </em>249 Md. at 562, 241 A.2d at 395.</p>\n<p id=\"b97-6\">Following the Barnes decision, the General Assembly amended \u00a7 36. <em>See </em>Ch. 446, Acts of 1970. Significantly, in light of the Barnes holding and the rationale underlying it, the \u201cserious disability\u201d provisions previously separately codified as \u00a7\u00a7 36(3a) and 36(4a) were combined into a single provision, \u00a7 36(4a), which was made applicable to all injuries arising \u201cfrom one accident,\u201d whether enumerated in \u00a7 36(3) or falling into the other cases category of \u00a7 36(4). It provided:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b97-7\">\u201c(4a). Serious Disability. \u2014 A person who, from one accident, receives an award of compensation for a period of two hundred and fifty (250) weeks or more under subsections (3) or (4) or a combination of both, is thereby considered to have a Serious Disability; except any award for disfigure<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"68\">*68</page-number>ment or mutilation under subsection (8)(f) of this section shall not be considered in the determination of a Serious Disability. The weeks for such award shall be increased by one-third (computed to the nearest whole number); and the compensation shall be for sixty-six and two-thirds per centum of the average weekly wages, in no case to exceed Sixty-five dollars ($65.00) per week and not less than a minimum of twenty-five dollars per week unless the employee\u2019s established weekly wages are less than twenty-five dollars per week at the time of the injury, in which event he shall receive compensation equal to his full wages. This subsection, to the extent of any inconsistency, prevails over subsection (8) and (4); but otherwise subsections (3) and (4) apply to persons covered by this subsection. Provided, however, that any additional compensation for permanent partial disability on a petition to reopen shall not increase the amount of compensation previously awarded and actually paid.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b98-4\">Sections 36(3) and (4), to which amended \u00a7 36(4a) expressly referred, continued to provide as they did prior to the amendment to the serious disability provision.</p>\n<p id=\"b98-5\">Thus, as the Court of Special Appeals observed in <em>Carter v. Allen, Son &amp; Company, </em>Inc., 28 Md.App. 541, 544, 346 A.2d 453, 455-56 (1975), \u201cThere can be no doubt of the legislative intent in the passage of the 1970 legislation whereby \u00a7 36(3a) and \u00a7 36(4a) were repealed and the new \u00a7 36(4a) enacted.\u201d The court explained:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b98-6\">\u201cIt is patent that the new subsection, combining the two prior subsections into one, was a legislative response to [the <em>Barnes </em>] decision. The new legislation made clear that the <em>full actual disability </em>of a workman must be considered in the determination of \u2018serious disability,\u2019 whether it was the product of scheduled specific injuries under \u00a7 36(3) or to the body as a whole under the \u2018other cases\u2019 provisions of \u00a7 36(4) or to a combination of both.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b98-7\"><em>Id. </em>at 546, 346 A.2d at 456. <em>See Duckworth v.

An award of compensation for a period less than 75 weeks in a claim arising from events occurring on or after January 1, 1989 shall be paid at a rate of thirty-three and one-third per centum of the average weekly wages, in no case to exceed $82.50 per week.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b99-6\">\u201c2.

This subparagraph, to the extent of any inconsistency, prevails over paragraphs (c) through (l) of this subsection; but otherwise paragraphs (c) through (l) of this subsection apply to persons covered by this subparagraph----\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b100-7\">Unlike the provision regarding serious disability, which made it clear that a combination of awards pursuant to the scheduled benefits and \u201cother cases\u201d could be utilized to achieve serious disability status, the new level of disability did not expressly address whether awards could be combined in order to allow a claimant to qualify for that level of compensation. In fact, it contained nothing either proscribing or allowing the combination of awards, nor did it make any distinction between scheduled and unscheduled awards.</p>\n<p id=\"b100-8\">Section 36 (3) continued to prescribe a schedule of benefits and the \u201cweeks\u201d of compensation for specific injuries in sub<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"71\">*71</page-number>sections (c) \u2014 (k), and to provide for \u201cother cases\u201d in subsection (j), which stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b101-4\">\u201cIn all other cases of disability other than those specifically enumerated disabilities set forth in paragraphs (c) through (i), inclusive, of this section, which disability is partial in character, but permanent in quality, the Commission shall determine the portion or percentage by which the industrial use of the employee\u2019s body was impaired as a result of the injury and in determining such portion or percentage of impairment resulting in industrial loss, the Commission shall take into consideration, among other things, the nature of the physical injury, the occupation, experience, training and age of the injured employee at the time of injury, and shall award compensation in such proportion as the determined loss bears to 500 weeks and compensation shall be paid to the employee at the rates enumerated for the periods as provided in subsection (3)(a)(i) through (iii), inclusive, of this section.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b101-5\">In 1991, as part of Code revision, the Legislature re-codified the Workers\u2019 Compensation statute as Title 9 of the Labor and Employment Article. <em>See </em>Acts of 1991, ch. 8. The re-codification made no substantive changes to the schedule of specific injuries or to the language defining the injuries or to the three levels of compensation prescribed for permanent partial disability. Section 9-627(a)-(j), like its predecessor, \u00a7 36(3)(c)-(k), contains a schedule in which the duration of compensation for certain injuries to the members of the body is pre-determined. In the case of injuries to which the schedule is applicable, the Commission evaluates each injury sustained, makes a determination as to percentage of impairment, and apportions the percentage of the injury that is work-related against any preexisting injury or condition. <em>See </em>\u00a7 9 \u2014 627(a)\u2014(j). If, however, a claimant suffers an injury to the body that is not \u201cscheduled,\u201d \u201cthe [Commission] ... determine^] the percentage by which the industrial use of the covered employee\u2019s body was impaired [as a result of this injury and] ... award[s] compensation to the covered employee in the proportion that the determined loss bears to 500 weeks.\u201d \u00a7 9-627(k). <em>Id. </em>Section 9-630, addressing the most <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"72\">*72</page-number>serious permanent partial disabilities, still contained, slightly-modified, the language first adopted in response to <em>Barnes </em>and retained when the statute was amended in 1987 (effective 1988), which expressly authorized combining awards, with the exception of \u201c[a]n award for disfigurement or mutilation, [which] may not be used to make up the 250 weeks under paragraph (1) of this subsection,\u201d to reach this level of compensation. Section 9-629, the next most serious level of disability, which did not contain a similar provision when initially enacted in 1987, was reenacted without adding any combination language.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b102-4\">The lowest level of compensation continues to govern all situations when \u201ca covered employee is awarded compensation for less than 75 weeks;\u201d however, the rate of compensation varies depending on the date of injury.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> Md.Code (1991, 2008 Repl.

Robinson and Anderson each suffered a single on-the-job accident, resulting in permanent partial disability, where at least one of the two injuries was a \u201cscheduled injury\u201d pursuant to \u00a7 9-627(a) through (j) and the other arose under \u201cother cases\u201d and was, therefore, an \u201cunscheduled injury\u201d pursuant to \u00a7 9-627(k). The Commission awarded Robinson 150 weeks of permanent partial disability benefits. It concluded that Robinson was to be paid at the \u201csecond tier\u201d rate of benefits, amounting to $267.00 per week. The employer in her case, Montgomery County, appealed the Commission\u2019s award to the Circuit Court for Montgomery County. There, it filed a Motion for Summary Judgment, contesting the Commission\u2019s decision to award \u201csecond tier benefits\u201d to Robinson. Robinson filed a Motion in Opposition to Summary Judgment. Judge William J. Rowan III granted summary judgment in favor of Montgomery County.</p>\n<p id=\"b104-4\">With respect to Anderson, the Commission awarded 77 weeks of benefits, also at the \u201csecond tier\u201d rate of permanent partial disability benefits, in her case amounting to $288.00 per week. The employer in her case, the Montgomery County School Board, also appealed the award to the Circuit Court for Montgomery County, seeking favorable summary disposition. Anderson filed a cross-motion for summary judgment in support of the Commission\u2019s award and the provision of second tier benefits. Judge Terrence J. McGann similarly reversed the Commission\u2019s award.</p>\n<p id=\"b104-5\">The respondents timely noted an appeal to the Court of Special Appeals. After hearing argument, the Court of Special Appeals reversed the judgments of the Circuit Court. <em>Anderson v. Board of Educ. of Montgomery County, </em>192 Md.App. 343, 994 A.2d 507 (2010). It held that the Commission could combine awards for scheduled injuries with awards for other cases for the purpose of determining whether the second tier compensation rate was applicable. <em>Id. </em>at 353, 994 A.2d at 514. In support of its decision, the intermediate appellate court stated that \u201cthe history of the creation of the second tier of compensation persuades us that the legislature intended for <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"75\">*75</page-number>the Commission to consider the total compensation awarded as a consequence of a single accident in making its determination of whether the enhanced rate was applicable.\u201d <em>Id. </em>The petitioners subsequently petitioned this Court for certiorari review, which we granted. <em>Montgomery County v. Robinson, </em>415 Md. 337, 1 A.3d 467 (2010) and <em>Board of Education v. Anderson, </em>415 Md. 337, 1 A.3d 467 (2010).</p>\n<p id=\"b105-4\">We must determine whether the respondents qualified for compensation under \u00a7 9-629, that is, whether, like \u00a7 9-630, which prescribes a higher level of compensation, \u00a7 9-629 authorizes the combining of compensation awards. In making the award pursuant to \u00a7 9-629, the Commission combined, in each case, the awards for the scheduled and unscheduled injuries. We hold that it is permissible under the Workers\u2019 Compensation Act to combine compensation awards in order to determine which of the three levels of compensation prescribed by \u00a7\u00a7 9-628-9-630 is appropriate. Therefore, we affirm the judgments of the Court of Special Appeals, which correctly applied \u00a7 9-629 and properly reversed the judgments of the Circuit Court for Montgomery County.</p>\n<p id=\"b105-5\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b105-6\">The consolidated cases <em>sub judice </em>arise from two separate claims filed by the respondents Robinson and Anderson with the Commission. Robinson filed her claim for permanent injuries that partially impaired her right hand/wrist and back on November 8, 2006. The Commission awarded, pursuant to \u00a7 9-627(d), 100 weeks of compensation for Robinson\u2019s \u201cscheduled\u201d hand/wrist injury and, pursuant to \u00a7 9-627(k), an additional 50 weeks for her \u201cunscheduled\u201d back injury. Combining the scheduled and unscheduled injuries, it then awarded Robinson 150 weeks of compensation at the intermediate level of compensation, pursuant to \u00a7 9-629.</p>\n<p id=\"b105-7\">Anderson filed a claim for permanent partial injuries sustained to her back and leg on January 11, 2007. The Commission awarded her 50 weeks of compensation for her \u201cunscheduled\u201d back injury, pursuant to \u00a7 9-627(k), and an additional <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"76\">*76</page-number>27 weeks of compensation for her \u201cscheduled\u201d leg injury; pursuant to \u00a7 9 \u2014 627(d). Again, the Commission combined the scheduled and unscheduled injuries and awarded 77 total weeks of compensation at the intermediate level of compensation.</p>\n<p id=\"b106-4\">The County does not challenge the Commission\u2019s determinations as to the severity of the injuries suffered or the period during which compensation was payable for each injury. It challenges only whether the individual injuries can be combined to reach the intermediate compensation level. In that regard, the petitioners challenged the Commission\u2019s authority to combine awards made with regard to scheduled and unscheduled injuries in order to award the intermediate level of compensation. They contend that both of Anderson\u2019s injuries should be compensated pursuant to \u00a7 9-628 at a lower rate of compensation because each injury, by itself, merits less than the required 75 weeks of compensation, which is the threshold for the application of \u00a7 9-629. Similarly, the County argues that Robinson\u2019s unscheduled back injury should be considered separately from her scheduled arm injury and that the 50-week award for her back injury should be compensated pursuant to \u00a7 9-628.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b106-5\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b106-6\">In this case, \u00a7 9-630 expressly authorizes the Commission to combine permanent partial disability awards to obtain the requisite period of disability to render the disability serious, while \u00a7 9-629, on the other hand, does not. We must determine whether the latter provision\u2019s silence on this point precludes the combining of awards to meet its threshold. This is a question of statutory construction. It is well established that, when engaging in statutory interpretation, \u201cour goal is to identify and effectuate the legislative intent underlying the statute.\u201d <em>Dep\u2019t of Health &amp; Mental Hygiene v. Kelly, </em>397 Md. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"77\">*77</page-number>399, 419, 918 A.2d 470, 482 (2007). Our analysis always begins with \u201cthe normal, plain meaning of the language of the statute, reading the statute as a whole.\u201d <em>Burnside v. Wong, </em>412 Md. 180, 194, 986 A.2d 427, 435 (2010) (internal quotations omitted). \u201cIf the language of the statute is clear and unambiguous, we need not look beyond the statute\u2019s provisions and our analysis ends.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 195, 986 A.2d at 435. If, however, because it is a part of a larger statutory scheme or for some other reason, the language of the statute is not clear, is ambiguous, or is subject to more than one interpretation, \u201cwe endeavor to resolve that ambiguity by looking to the statute\u2019s legislative history, case law, and statutory purpose.\u201d <em>People\u2019s Ins.

Pope, </em>402 Md. 157, 173, 935 A.2d 699, 709 (2007)).</p>\n<p id=\"b107-4\">In determining whether the statute is clear or ambiguous, \u201c[w]hen the statute is part of a larger statutory scheme, it is axiomatic that the language of a provision is not interpreted in isolation; rather, we analyze the statutory scheme as a whole considering the \u2018purpose, aim, or policy of the enacting body.\u2019 \u201d <em>Anderson v. Council of Unit Owners of Gables on Tuckerman Condo., </em>404 Md. 560, 572, 948 A.2d 11, 19 (2008) (quoting <em>Serio v. Baltimore Cnty., </em>384 Md. 373, 390, 863 A.2d 952, 962 (2004); <em>Drew v. First Guar. Mortgage Corp., </em>379 Md. 318, 327, 842 A.2d 1, 6 (2003)). Moreover, we interpret statutes within a statutory scheme with reference to one another even if the statutes were enacted at different times and do not refer to each other. <em>Gov\u2019t Employees Ins. Co. &amp; GEICO v. Ins. Com\u2019r, </em>332 Md. 124, 132, 630 A.2d 713, 717 (1993). We attempt, in that regard, to harmonize the statutes with each other and within the scheme without rendering any language or portion of the statutes meaningless, surplusage, superfluous, or nugatory. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b107-5\">Section 9-629 is, when viewed in isolation, clear enough. There is nothing in the statute that prohibits the combining of awards, scheduled and for \u201cother cases,\u201d to justify an award at the compensation level it prescribes. Ambiguity as to whether <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"78\">*78</page-number>compensation awards may be combined surfaces only when \u00a7 9-629 is compared with \u00a7 9-630, which governs compensation for the most serious permanent partial disabilities. That section expressly authorizes the Commission to combine awards resulting from a single accident in order to bring a claimant within its terms, entitling the claimant to enhanced benefits. It also contains a prohibition against combining permanent partial disability awards for scheduled injuries and injuries arising under \u201cother cases\u201d with those for disfigurement or mutilation, which are compensated separately pursuant to \u00a7 9-627G).</p>\n<p id=\"b108-4\">It is a settled principle of Maryland law that the General Assembly is presumed to be aware of legislation it has enacted, <em>Ali v. CIT Tech. Fin. Services, Inc., </em>416 Md. 249, 264, 6 A.3d 890, 898-99 (2010), <em>Md. State Highway Admin. v. Kim, </em>353 Md. 313, 324, 726 A.2d 238, 244 (1999) (citing <em>Gov\u2019t Employees Ins. Co. v. Insurance Comm\u2019r, </em>332 Md. 124, 132, 630 A.2d 713, 717 (1993)), as well as the interpretation the courts have given that legislation. <em>Williams v. State, </em>292 Md. 201, 210, 438 A.2d 1301, 1305 (1981); <em>Jones v. State, </em>362 Md. 331, 337-38, 765 A.2d 127, 131 (2001); <em>Hoile v. State, </em>404 Md. 591, 628, 948 A.2d 30, 52 (2008). Both the petitioners and the respondents embrace this principle and incorporate it into their arguments.</p>\n<p id=\"b108-5\">Relying on this principle, the petitioners proffer that the General Assembly must have been aware of our <em>Barnes </em>decision, which proscribed combining awards for scheduled members and \u201cother cases\u201d in order to render a claimant eligible for enhanced benefits, as well as of the subsequent statutory changes it enacted in 1970 to overrule <em>Barnes. </em>In that regard, they point out and emphasize that when the General Assembly enacted the legislation in 1987 to establish a third, intermediate level of compensation for injuries rendering a claimant permanently partially disabled, it did not include in the new section, then \u00a7 36(3)(a)(ii), the <em>post-Barnes </em>\u201ccombination language,\u201d while retaining that language in the section governing the highest level of compensation, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"79\">*79</page-number>\u00a7 36(3)(a)(iii). This, according to the petitioners, supports the inference, which is the real thrust of their argument, that the General Assembly intended that combining awards applied only to enhance compensation for the most serious permanent partial disabilities. They argue that, if combining awards is permitted under both \u00a7\u00a7 9-629 and 9-630, then the \u201ccombination language\u201d included in \u00a7 9-630 would be mere surplusage.</p>\n<p id=\"b109-4\">Adopting the same principle, the respondents emphasize, not the language of \u00a7 9-630, but the \u201cbroad plain meaning\u201d of \u00a7 9-629, the timing of its enactment and <em>Barnes\u2019 </em>relevance to its provisions. They explain:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b109-5\">\u201cWhen the predecessor to \u00a7 9-629 was enacted almost 20 years [after Barnes], there was no case that needed to be specifically overturned. In addition, the legislature had the benefit of the <em>Barnes </em>case to guide it. <em>Barnes </em>made it clear that a single enactment, with no separate provision for awarding heightened benefits for \u2018scheduled\u2019 versus \u2018unscheduled\u2019 losses would be interpreted as allowing for a combination of \u2018scheduled\u2019 and \u2018unscheduled\u2019 losses. With that in mind, the legislature enacted the predecessor to \u00a7 9-629, which had a single broad provision and standard for awarding \u2018second tier\u2019 benefits-simply an award of 75 weeks of compensation or more, with no mention of \u2018scheduled\u2019 versus \u2018unscheduled\u2019 losses.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b109-6\">(Citation omitted). Significant to the respondents\u2019 position is that \u00a7 9-629 was enacted with broad language and without there having been separate subsections addressing \u201cscheduled\u201d losses and \u201cunscheduled\u201d losses. Thus, they submit, \u201cno ambiguity would be created by combining compensation awarded for a \u2018scheduled\u2019 loss with that awarded for an \u2018unscheduled loss.\u2019 \u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b109-7\">To be sure, the petitioners\u2019 interpretation of \u00a7 9-629 as not permitting the combining of awards to make a claimant eligible for the enhanced benefits it provides does give effect to the \u201cor a combination of awards\u201d language in \u00a7 9-630 and avoids its being mere surplusage. On the other hand, it does not make the intent of the General Assembly in enacting \u00a7 9-629 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"80\">*80</page-number>in the form that it did clear, or stated differently, account for the apparent conflict between it and \u00a7 9-630. Moreover, their interpretation does not give effect to the remedial nature and purpose of the Workers\u2019 Compensation Act.</p>\n<p id=\"b110-5\"><em>Barnes, </em>as the respondents point out, did not announce a general rule regarding the combining of awards for scheduled and unscheduled losses. <em>Barnes, </em>249 Md. at 562, 241 A.2d at 395. It simply interpreted the statutes pursuant to which the Commission acted contrary to the way in which the Commission did. <em>Id. </em>Nevertheless, <em>Barnes </em>is instructive with regard to the proper disposition of this appeal.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> As we have seen, where the General Assembly enacted two separate statutes with different qualification requirements, one of which provided for and defined serious disability in terms of scheduled injuries to the body, and the other in terms of unscheduled injuries arising under \u201cother cases,\u201d the Court determined that combining awards made under those statutes to enhance the benefits payable under both was neither the meaning of the statutes nor the intent of the Legislature. <em>Id. </em>That conclusion was dictated by the fact that the General Assembly enacted different categories of serious disability for the scheduled injuries and for the \u201cother cases\u201d injuries, rather than creating one category to cover both kinds of injuries. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b110-6\">Before reaching that conclusion, the Court considered and rejected the argument made by the claimant that the statutes, as part of a remedial Act, were ambiguous and, thus, created uncertainty in the law and doubt as to the General Assembly\u2019s intention in passing the legislation, which entitled the claimant to the benefit of its liberal construction. <em>Barnes, </em>249 Md. at 561, 241 A.2d at 395. That argument was rejected not because it was an incorrect statement or interpretation of the law, but because the Court concluded that it did not apply under the facts and circumstances of that case. <em>Id. </em>Indeed, we said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b111-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"81\">*81</page-number>\u201cIt is true, as the claimant maintains, that where there is ambiguity in the compensation law, the uncertainty should be resolved in favor of the claimant, but that rule does not apply where, as here, there is no conflict and the intent of the legislature is clear.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b111-4\"><em>Barnes, </em>249 Md. at 561, 241 A.2d at 395.</p>\n<p id=\"b111-5\">When the General Assembly amended \u00a7 36 to provide that a single category of serious disability, which applied to enhance awards for both scheduled and unscheduled injuries and expressly authorized the awards for both categories of loss, it directly addressed and resolved the issue favorable to claimants. That it later again amended \u00a7 36 to include another level of compensation, now codified in \u00a7 9-629, without including the same or similar language concerning the combining of awards, as was included in \u00a7 9-630, does not conclusively establish that it was the General Assembly\u2019s intent to prohibit the combining of awards for scheduled and unscheduled losses for the newly enacted level of compensation. This is especially so because to interpret \u00a7 9-629 as prohibiting the combining of awards when such combination is expressly sanctioned in \u00a7 9-630 would lead to strange, unfair, and, therefore, illogical results. The example the respondents proffer is illustrative and persuasive:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b111-6\">\u201cA worker with multiple injuries, none individually resulting in compensation greater than 74 weeks could reach serious disability [pursuant to \u00a7 9-630] if the total compensation for the injuries was at least 250 weeks but, under the County\u2019s interpretation, if the total compensation was 249 weeks the worker\u2019s compensation would be reduced all the way to the \u201cfirst tier\u201d rate because no injury, individually, resulted in compensation greater than 74 weeks.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b111-7\">Moreover, as the respondents point out, the language of the subsection applicable to the \u201cintermediate\u201d level of compensation is quite broad and does not delineate or characterize, in terms of their being scheduled or unscheduled, the injuries that would qualify the claimant for that level of compensation.</p>\n<p id=\"b112-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"82\">*82</page-number>Further, the General Assembly\u2019s intent is not clarified, never mind established beyond doubt, by reference to the legislative history of Acts of 1987, eh. 591. As the Court of Special Appeals pointed out, the reinsertion, in \u00a7 36(a)(iii), of the language regarding the combining of awards could have had as much to do with the prohibition it mandated with respect to using an award for disfigurement or mutilation to enhance the benefits for serious disability as with any attempt to prohibit the combining of awards for scheduled and unscheduled losses in determining an award pursuant to \u00a7 9-629. That prohibition is contained in \u00a7 9-630 immediately after the language permitting the combining of awards, but it is expressly not contained in \u00a7 9-629.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b112-4\">The purpose of the Workers\u2019 Compensation Act was set out in the Preamble to Acts 1914, ch. 800, which enacted its predecessor. We have stated that purpose as being \u201cto protect workers and their families from hardships inflicted by work-related injuries by providing workers with compensation for loss of earning capacity resulting from accidental injury arising out of and in the course of employment,\u201d <em>Howard County Ass\u2019n, Retard. Cit. v. Walls, </em>288 Md. 526, 531, 418 A.2d 1210, 1214 (1980), and \u201cto promote the general welfare of the State and to prevent the State and its taxpayers from having to care for injured workmen and their dependents, when under the law as it previously existed, such workmen could not recover damages for their injuries.\u201d <em>Paul v. Glidden Co., </em>184 Md. 114, 119, 39 A.2d 544, 546 (1944). <em>See also Victor v. Proctor &amp; Gamble Mfg.

Co., </em>190 Md. 374, 379, 58 A.2d 684, 685 (1948). Consistent with this purpose, we have repeatedly emphasized the Act\u2019s remedial nature and that it \u201cshould be <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"83\">*83</page-number>construed as liberally in favor of the injured employees as its provisions will permit in order to effectuate its benevolent purposes.\u201d <em>Howard County Ass\u2019n Retard. Cit. v. Walls, </em>288 Md. at 530, 418 A.2d at 1213. <em>See Design Kitchen &amp; Baths v. Lagos, </em>388 Md. 718, 724, 882 A.2d 817, 821 (2005); <em>Harris v.

Thus, we do not apply the canon of construction that a statute in derogation of the common law should be strictly construed. <em>Breitenbach v. N.B. Handy Co., </em>366 Md. 467, 474-75, 784 A.2d 569, 573-74 (2001); <em>Philip Elecs., </em>348 Md. at 216-17, 703 A.2d at 153-54. <em>See Porter v.

Section 9-102, relating to the construction of the Act, is consistent, providing:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b113-4\">\u201c(a) In general. \u2014 This title shall be construed to carry out its general purpose.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b113-5\">\u201c(b) Rule for strict construction inapplicable. \u2014 The rule that a statute in derogation of the common law is to be strictly construed does not apply to this title.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b113-6\">The petitioners\u2019 interpretation of \u00a7 9-629 undercuts the remedial nature of the Act. <em>See, e.g., Design Kitchen &amp; Baths v. Lagos, </em>388 Md. 718, 724, 882 A.2d 817, 821 (2005) (holding that an undocumented alien is a covered employee under the Act even though the statutory scheme makes no reference to an undocumented alien being a covered employee). Giving effect to the remedial nature of the Workers\u2019 Compensation Act and applying the <em>Design Kitchen </em>logic to the cases sub <em>judice </em>requires us to hold that \u00a7 9-629 allows awards for scheduled and unscheduled losses to be combined. Such a holding harmonizes that statute and \u00a7 9-630 within the larger statutory scheme by providing that the combination of permanent partial injury awards is appropriate in all cases.</p>\n<p id=\"b114-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"84\">*84</page-number>Accordingly, we affirm the judgment of the Court of Special Appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b114-4\">JUDGMENT AFFIRMED, WITH COSTS.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b95-10\">. Under \u00a7 36(3), compensation was awarded in the proportion that the loss bore to the sum of $12,500.
