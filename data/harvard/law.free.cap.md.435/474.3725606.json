Williams, was prosecuted in the Circuit Court for Harford County for controlled substance and resisting arrest offenses. Following his convictions, Williams appealed to the Court of Special Appeals arguing that: (1) the trial court violated Maryland Rule 4-215(e) by failing to respond to a letter he sent to the court, prior to trial, seeking to discharge his counsel, and (2) the evidence was insufficient to support his conviction on the charge of resisting a lawful arrest under Maryland Code (2002, 2011 Cum.Supp.), Criminal Law Article, \u00a7 9-408(b)(l). The intermediate appellate court affirmed the judgment of the trial court. Williams asks us to reverse on the grounds that the letter he sent to the trial court (filed in the case jacket) was sufficient to trigger Rule 4-215(e) and that the trial court\u2019s failure to conduct an inquiry consistent with the mandates of the Rule is reversible error. He asks us also to hold that the Court of Special Appeals erred when it held that the use of force element necessary to sustain a conviction for resisting arrest may be satisfied by the deployment of force against a civilian who assisted voluntarily the arresting law enforcement officers in the capture of Williams.</p>\n<p id=\"b508-6\">We hold that Williams\u2019s letter to the trial court was sufficient to trigger the rigors of Rule 4-215(e), and further that the trial court\u2019s failure to inquire into the reasons behind Williams\u2019s request to discharge counsel was reversible error. We hold also that, on this record, the intermediate appellate court did not misinterpret Maryland\u2019s resisting arrest statute. Accordingly, we reverse in part and affirm in part the judgment of the Court of Special Appeals and shall direct remand ultimately to the Circuit Court for further proceedings not inconsistent with our opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b508-7\">FACTUAL &amp; PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b508-8\">On 8 October 2008, the State\u2019s Attorney for Harford County filed in the Circuit Court a four-count criminal information charging Melvin D. Williams with three controlled dangerous <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"479\">*479</page-number>substances offenses and one count of resisting a lawful arrest. John Janowich, Esquire, from the local Office of the Public Defender entered his appearance as Williams\u2019s counsel on 11 February 2009. On 27 January 2010, Williams sent from jail a letter that reads in its entirety:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b509-4\">Case No 12-K-08-1673</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b509-5\">The Honorable Judge?? 1/27/2010</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b509-6\">My name is Melvin Williams JR Im writting to request New representation From the Public defender\u2019s office. Pending me being able to afford an attorney. MR John Janowich has truly No interest on my behalf in trying to help me on my case. I truly feel Im being mis-represented. May U please remove him from my case. I\u2019ll truly be appreciated.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b509-7\">Sincerely Melvin Williams</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b509-8\">This letter, filed in the court jacket, has a date stamp by the Circuit Court Clerk as being received on 29 January 2010. An entry on the docket confirms the Circuit Court\u2019s receipt of Williams\u2019s letter: \u201cLetter of Defendant requesting new representation from the public defender\u2019s office. Filed: 1/29/10 Entered: 2/17/10.\u201d An additional notation in the same docket entry states \u201cCopies sent to SAO, and PD 2/17/10,\u201d presumably meaning that the Clerk sent copies of Williams\u2019s letter to the State\u2019s Attorney\u2019s Office and the local Office of the Public Defender.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b509-9\">There was utterly no response to Williams\u2019s letter documented. Mr. Janowich continued to represent Williams over the course of the next sixteen months, including a hearing in the Circuit Court on 7 June 2010, three subsequent hearings, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"480\">*480</page-number>and a two-day jury trial.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> There is no further <em>mention </em>in the record of Williams\u2019s letter by any of the four judges who presided over those various proceedings, by Janowich, by the assistant state\u2019s attorney who prosecuted the case, or by Williams.</p>\n<p id=\"b510-5\">At Williams\u2019s jury trial, two law enforcement officers testified to the following facts pertinent to the circumstances of Williams\u2019s arrest.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> During the evening of 15 September 2008, Deputies Grant Krulock and Robert Schultz of the Harford County Sheriffs Office (collectively, \u201cthe Officers\u201d) were in uniform and on bicycle patrol in Edgewood, Maryland. At approximately 11:00 P.M., the Officers were talking to a group of civilians clustered around a van parked on the side of Fountain Rock Way. During this conversation, Melvin Williams, who the Officers did not know or recognize at the time, was observed walking toward them down the center of the street, holding his left hand inside of his shorts. Williams veered toward the driver\u2019s side of the van, but, after making eye contact with Krulock, changed direction and walked past the van and returned to the center of the street.</p>\n<p id=\"b510-6\">At that point, Krulock, with Schultz close behind, began to follow Williams on their bicycles. Krulock asked Williams to stop so the Officers could identify him. He also asked Williams to take his hand out of his pants. Williams removed his left hand from his pants, but, while doing so, turned away from Krulock. The Officer saw a clear plastic baggie fall to the ground from Williams\u2019s hand. Krulock decided then to detain Williams, and asked him to put his hands behind his back. Williams began to comply, but suddenly ran away. The Officers yelled for Williams to stop running. Schultz deployed his Taser to no avail. A chase ensued, in which Williams, with the Officers in hot pursuit, ran around a nearby <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"481\">*481</page-number>apartment building. Krulock\u2019s literal narrative picks up the \u201cCat Ballou-like\u201d chase:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b511-5\">We continued to pursue the subject on foot around the apartment building. We completely circled the apartment building that we were originally in front of. As we came around back to the area where we originally tried to detain him, one of the subjects as I mentioned earlier that we were talking to at the van, he came running along side [sic] the building and pursued the subject in front of us and he ended up tackling him and holding him down on to the ground for us to catch up.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b511-6\">As soon as we turned the corner we saw the subject that we were originally talking to holding the subject down on the ground who was attempting to get away at the time and then we approached him. I advised for the subject to get down on the ground and he refused to listen to my commands. Several times I then advised that he was going to be Tased if he did not listen to commands. He continued to ignore my commands. At that point I Tased him to gain compliance and detain him and end up getting the cuffs on him.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b511-7\">Krulock concluded by stating that he searched Williams\u2019s wallet, finding a fingernail-sized plastic bag containing crack cocaine.</p>\n<p id=\"b511-8\">At the close of the State\u2019s case-in-chief, Williams moved for judgment of acquittal on the resisting arrest count, arguing that the force used against the officers, if any, was de minimis. The Circuit Court denied the motion, finding that the use of force was a question of fact for the jury to decide.</p>\n<p id=\"b511-9\">Williams testified in his defense. Much of his testimony contradicted that of the Officers. In particular, although Williams admitted to running from the Officers, he did not admit to using force against the bystander who tackled him. On direct examination, Williams stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b511-10\">I ran. Basically, when I got back into the middle of the street I gave up because I\u2019m safe now, but a guy that I <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"482\">*482</page-number>remember when I was a little kid, he jumps on me. I gave up. I got my weight back from not using [drugs]. He was only like about 100 pounds and I was 250, real big. He didn\u2019t pin me nowhere. I gave up.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b512-5\">Williams testified similarly in response to cross-examination questioning regarding his arrest:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b512-6\">I ran back in the middle of the street by the civilians where everybody had a visual of what was going on with me.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b512-7\">I just gave up. I was laying on the ground. A citizen was supposedly holding me, a ond [sic] hundred pound pound [sic] guy.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b512-8\">Following his testimony, Williams rested his case and renewed his motion for judgment of acquittal on the resisting arrest count. The Circuit Court denied the motion for the same reasons as before.</p>\n<p id=\"b512-9\">The jury found Williams guilty on the counts of misdemean- or possession of cocaine and resisting arrest.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Following sentencing, Williams filed timely a notice of appeal to the Court of Special Appeals. Williams argued that the Circuit Court failed to comply with Maryland Rule 4-215(e) by not addressing his written request to discharge counsel. Further, he insisted that the State\u2019s evidence was insufficient to sustain his conviction on the charge of resisting arrest. The intermediate appellate court, in an unreported opinion initially, affirmed the judgment of the Circuit Court. The State filed a Motion to Designate for Reporting the Unreported Opinion. The Court of Special Appeals granted the State\u2019s motion and filed subsequently a reported opinion. <em>Williams v. State, </em>208 Md.App. 622, 57 A.3d 508 (2012).</p>\n<p id=\"b512-10\">Williams sent a letter to this Court on 6 December 2012, which we treated as a Petition for Writ of Certiorari. We notified Williams that he had until 7 January 2013 to supplement his Petition. On that date, the Office of the Public <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"483\">*483</page-number>Defender filed a Petition for Writ of Certiorari on behalf of Williams. We granted the Public Defender\u2019s Petition to consider the following questions:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b513-4\">Where Petitioner stated unequivocally and conspicuously his desire to discharge his attorney in a letter filed with the court, was the court required to comply with the requirements of Maryland Rule 4-215(e), without the need for Petitioner to repeat his request in open court?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b513-5\">Did the Court of Special Appeals misinterpret Maryland Code (2002, 2011 Cum.Supp.), Criminal Law Article, \u00a7 9-408 in upholding Petitioner\u2019s conviction for resisting arrest where the force allegedly used in resisting arrest was \u201cemployed against someone other than the police officer who is attempting to effectuate the arrest\u201d?</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b513-6\"><em>Williams v. State, </em>430 Md. 644, 62 A.3d 730 (2013).</p>\n<p id=\"b513-7\">STANDARD OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b513-8\">We are called upon here to interpret provisions of the Maryland Rules and the Maryland Code. Our interpretations of both \u201care appropriately classified as questions of law.\u201d <em>Davis v. Slater, </em>383 Md. 599, 604, 861 A.2d 78, 80 (2004). As such, \u201cwe review the issues [without deference] to determine if the trial court was legally correct in its rulings on these matters.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b513-9\">We use \u201cthe same canons and principles\u201d of construction to interpret the Rules and the Code, as we do generally with legislation. <em>Pinkney v. State, </em>427 Md. 77, 88, 46 A.3d 413, 420 (2012) (quoting <em>Knox v. State, </em>404 Md. 76, 85-86, 945 A.2d 638, 644 (2008)); <em>see also Grade v. State, </em>431 Md. 85, 102, 64 A.3d 197, 207 (2013) (\u201c[T]he canons of construction applicable to statutes are equally applicable to rules.\u201d). We explained recently those canons and principles that are pertinent to this case:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b513-10\">We look to the plain meaning of the language employed in the[] rules and construe that language without forced or subtle interpretations designed to limit or extend its scope. We avoid a construction of a rule or statute that is unrea<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"484\">*484</page-number>sonable, illogical, or inconsistent with common sense. We construe statutes and rules as a whole so that no word, clause, sentence, or phrase is rendered surplusage, superfluous, meaningless, or nugatory.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b514-4\"><em>Black v. State, </em>426 Md. 328, 338-39, 44 A.3d 362, 368 (2012) (alteration in original) (internal citations and quotation marks omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b514-5\">ANALYSIS</p>\n<p id=\"b514-6\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b514-7\">We address first the question of whether Williams\u2019s letter to the Circuit Court was sufficient to require the Circuit Court to conduct an inquiry consistent with the rigors of Rule 4-215(e).</p>\n<p id=\"b514-8\">A.</p>\n<p id=\"b514-9\">Williams advances four interlocking arguments in pursuit of his quest for a reversal of the judgment of the Court of Special Appeals based on the trial court\u2019s asserted non-compliance with Rule 4-215(e). First, he argues that, once Rule 4-215(e) is triggered, the court must inquire into the defendant\u2019s reasons for discharge. As Williams sees it, he triggered the Rule in the present case by \u201cunequivocally and conspicuously stat[ing] his desire to discharge counsel.\u201d Second, he contends that the plain language of the Rule does not require that the modality of expression be oral and made in open court, nor does it require that the request, once made, need be repeated thereafter. Third, Williams claims that the Court of Special Appeals\u2019s reliance on <em>State v. Northam, </em>421 Md. 195, 26 A.3d 344 (2011), is misplaced because we did not hold there that a trial court may ignore a request to discharge counsel when the request was sufficient to trigger Rule 4-215(e) at the time it was advanced. Fourth, Williams disagrees with the conclusion of the Court of Special Appeals that the four Circuit Court judges, who presided over the collective hearings and the trial that took place after the letter was received, could infer reasonably that any problems between Williams and his counsel were resolved after the letter was sent merely because <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"485\">*485</page-number>Williams did not reiterate subsequent displeasure or dissatisfaction with Janowieh and allowed the representation to continue (even through trial), especially in view of defense counsel\u2019s ethical obligations under the Maryland Lawyers Rules of Professional Conduct to note for the court any discontent on his client\u2019s part.</p>\n<p id=\"b515-4\">The State counters that Williams did not trigger Rule 4-215(e) because he refrained from re-asserting the discharge of counsel issue during any of his five court appearances following sending the letter. In support of that argument, the State contends that Maryland case law, including <em>Northern, </em>creates an additional requirement for the defendant who expresses the desire to discharge counsel in a modality other than in open court, to \u201cutter something in open court that can reasonably be construed as a present desire by the defendant to discharge counsel.\u201d By failing to reiterate his desire to terminate counsel\u2019s representation in open court, the State continues, Williams waived effectively his initial request. Urging us to reject Williams\u2019s assertion that the content of his letter is more direct than, and therefore distinguishable from, the letter at the heart of <em>Northam, </em>the State argues that the \u201cmotion\u201d must be brought again to the court\u2019s attention regardless of how clearly and succinctly Williams styled it in his letter. The State contends also that it would be \u201cabsurd\u201d to require that a trial court \u201cshould <em>sua sponte </em>involve itself in the attorney-client relationship,\u201d where defense counsel did not apprise the court of Williams\u2019s unhappiness with his representation.</p>\n<p id=\"b515-5\">B.</p>\n<p id=\"b515-6\">The purpose of Rule 4-215 is to \u201cprotect that most important fundamental right to the effective assistance of counsel, which is basic to our adversary system of criminal justice.\u201d <em>Parren v. State, </em>309 Md. 260, 281, 523 A.2d 597, 607 (1987). That right is guaranteed by the Sixth Amendment to the United States Constitution, which is applied to the states via the Fourteenth Amendment, and by Article 21 of the Maryland Declaration of Rights. <em>State v. Davis, </em>415 Md. 22, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"486\">*486</page-number>29, 997 A.2d 780, 784 (2010) (citing <em>Brye v. State, </em>410 Md. 623, 634, 980 A.2d 435, 441 (2009)). Accordingly, \u201cwe have held consistently that the requirements of the Rule are mandatory,\u201d that its \u201cmandates [ ] require strict compliance,\u201d and that \u201ca trial court\u2019s departure from the requirements of Rule 4-215 constitutes reversible error.\u201d <em>Pinkney, </em>427 Md. at 87-88, 46 A.3d at 419; <em>see also Davis, </em>415 Md. at 31, 997 A.2d at 785 (\u201cThe failure to inquire into a defendant\u2019s reasons for seeking new counsel when the proper request has been made to the court is reversible error.\u201d (citing <em>Snead v. State, </em>286 Md. 122, 131, 406 A.2d 98, 103 (1979))).</p>\n<p id=\"b516-5\">The first part of subsection (e) of Rule 4-215, the only provision of the Rule at issue in this case, states: \u201c(e) Discharge of Counsel \u2014 Waiver. If a defendant requests permission to discharge an attorney whose appearance has been entered, the court shall permit the defendant to explain the reasons for the request.\u201d The Rule does not define \u201cwhat level of discourse is required to discharge counsel.\u201d <em>State v. Campbell, </em>385 Md. 616, 629, 870 A.2d 217, 224 (2005). Furthermore, a review of the Rule\u2019s history \u201ccontains no commentary on the meaning of the phrase <em>\u2018requests </em>permission to discharge an attorney.\u2019 \u201d <em>Campbell, </em>385 Md. at 628 n. 4, 870 A.2d at 224 n. 4.</p>\n<p id=\"b516-6\">Our prior interpretations of Rule 4-215(e) (and its predecessor, Rule 723c) assist, however, in clarifying what constitutes a cognizable discharge request under the Rule. We explained that a defendant need not \u201cutter a talismanic phrase,\u201d <em>Leonard v. State, </em>302 Md. 111, 124, 486 A.2d 163, 169 (1985), or \u201cstate his position or express his desire to discharge his attorney in a specified manner\u201d to trigger the rigors of the Rule. <em>Davis, </em>415 Md. at 32, 997 A.2d at 786. Moreover, a request to discharge an attorney need not be explicit. <em>See State v. Hardy, </em>415 Md. 612, 623, 4 A.3d 908, 914 (2010) (\u201cA defendant makes such a request when his or her statement constitutes more a declaration of dissatisfaction with counsel than an explicit request to discharge.\u201d). Rather, Rule 4-215(e) is triggered by any statement from which a court could <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"487\">*487</page-number>conclude reasonably that the defendant may be inclined to discharge counsel. <em>State v. Taylor, </em>431 Md. 615, 634, 66 A.3d 698, 710 (2013); <em>Hardy, </em>415 Md. at 623, 4 A.3d at 914; <em>Davis, </em>415 Md. at 31, 997 A.2d at 785; <em>Leonard, </em>302 Md. at 124, 486 A.2d at 169.</p>\n<p id=\"b517-5\">Once Rule 4-215(e) is triggered, the trial court has an affirmative duty to address the defendant\u2019s request. As we explained in <em>Taylor, </em>when it is (or should be) clear objectively that a defendant is making a request to discharge counsel, \u201cthe defendant must be provided [ ] with a forum in which he or she (and/or counsel) may explain the underlying reasons for the purported request to discharge counsel.\u201d <em>State v. Taylor, </em>431 Md. at 633, 66 A.3d at 709.</p>\n<p id=\"b517-6\">We held recently in <em>Northam </em>that the defendant\u2019s choice to send to the trial court a letter of a certain content did not trigger Rule 4-215(e), and therefore did not require an inquiry by the court. There, the defendant\u2019s writing, captioned as a Motion for Change of Venue, contained in its fourth and final paragraph, the following language:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b517-7\">Regardless of my race, gender, or ethnic belief I feel as a American citizen I have the right to be judge properly and be granted the ability to be represented by a Firm who has represented. Thereselves with Integerty and Justice. My Lawyers filed are updated but he has made no contact with me and trial is set at Sept 24 I\u2019m requesting a Court appointed attorney and change of venue.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b517-8\"><em>Northam, </em>421 Md. at 203, 26 A.3d at 348. The first three paragraphs of the letter concerned the defendant\u2019s request for a change of venue. The trial court denied Northam\u2019s \u201cmotion\u201d in a simple order filed on 11 September 2008. <em>Id. </em>The transcript of a hearing held the following day contained no mention of Northam\u2019s expressed desire to discharge his counsel; a docket entry from that day, however, stated \u201cDefendant consents to continued representation by [defense counsel].\u201d <em>Northam, </em>421 Md. at 203-04, 26 A.3d at 348-49. At a final pretrial hearing on 24 September 2008, Northam attempted to address the court, but was told by the judge to \u201ctalk to [his] lawyer,\u201d who in turn told the court that he needed to resolve <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"488\">*488</page-number>something with his client, and suggested that they may need a recess and reconvene the hearing. <em>Northam, </em>421 Md. at 204-05, 26 A.3d at 349. No request to reconvene was made that day. <em>Northam, </em>421 Md. at 205, 26 A.3d at 349. Northam stood for trial the next day and was convicted. <em>Id. </em>The Court of Special Appeals overturned, in an unreported opinion, Northam\u2019s conviction, holding that Northam\u2019s letter was sufficient to trigger a Rule 4-215(e) inquiry. <em>See Northam, </em>421 Md. at 205, 26 A.3d at 350 (citing the opinion of the Court of Special Appeals).</p>\n<p id=\"b518-5\">On certiorari review, we reversed the judgment of the Court of Special Appeals. The Court agreed with the State\u2019s argument that Northam\u2019s \u201cvague request, that he wanted a \u2018Court appointed attorney,\u2019 buried in the final sentence of the final paragraph of what was captioned and pled specifically and solely as a change of venue motion stands in stark contrast to other cases where 4-215 inquiries were mandated.\u201d <em>Northam, </em>421 Md. at 206, 26 A.3d at 350. We considered other cases where we held that defendants waived the opportunity for rulings on particular written requests that were part of larger \u201comnibus\u201d motions because the defendants failed to re-assert undecided motions in open court. Following our review of those cases, we noted that Northam failed to reiterate a request to discharge counsel in three appearances in open court after sending his letter. <em>Northam, </em>421 Md. at 206-07, 26 A.3d at 350-51. Consequently, we accepted the State\u2019s argument that, in Northam\u2019s case, \u201c \u2018Rule 4-215(e) was not implicated, much less violated, by the trial court.\u2019 \u201d <em>Northam, </em>421 Md. at 207, 26 A.3d at 351. Additionally, we refused to infer that Northam was attempting to request discharge of his counsel at the 24 September 2008 hearing when the judge cut him off because the court\u2019s \u201ctalk to your lawyer\u201d response was an appropriate one under the circumstances, and because \u201cwe shall not infer that [defense counsel] failed to comply with the Maryland Rules of Professional Conduct.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b518-6\">C.</p>\n<p id=\"b518-7\">We agree with Williams that his letter was sufficient to trigger the requirements of Rule 4-215(e). His letter <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"489\">*489</page-number>stated clearly, solely, and unequivocally that he intended to discharge his counsel. Unlike Northam\u2019s fleeting reference in closing to wanting a \u201cCourt appointed attorney,\u201d Williams\u2019s request was neither vague nor embedded within extraneous matter in an unrelated written motion. Indeed, by stating that he was writing \u201cto request New representation From the Public defender\u2019s office,\u201d and asking the court to \u201cremove [Mr. Janowich] from [his] case,\u201d Williams posed a request that was just as explicit, focused, and direct in content, if not more so, than requests in other cases where we held that Rule 4-215(e) inquiries were necessary. <em>See, e.g., Hardy, </em>415 Md. at 622, 4 A.3d at 914 (defendant stated that he was \u201c \u2018thinking about changing the attorney or something\u2019 \u201d); <em>Campbell, </em>385 Md. at 632, 870 A.2d at 226 (defendant made several statements including \u201cI don\u2019t like this man as my representative\u201d and \u201c[y]ou all wouldn\u2019t let me fire him\u201d); <em>Williams v. State, </em>321 Md. 266, 267, 582 A.2d 803, 804 (1990) (defendant stated to the court \u201cI want another representative\u201d). The only difference was that Williams chose a written form of expression.</p>\n<p id=\"b519-4\">The State\u2019s argument that Williams\u2019s letter was insufficient to trigger Rule 4-215(e) because the Rule requires that someone \u201cutter something in open court that can reasonably be construed as a present desire by the defendant to discharge counsel\u201d is well-intentioned, but unfounded. First, the plain language of the Rule states only that a court must inquire into the reasons for discharge \u201c[i]f a defendant requests permission to discharge an attorney.\u201d Nowhere in the Rule does it state that such a request must be oral, as opposed to written, or made in open court. We decline to adopt the State\u2019s categorical view that an out-of-open-court, written request filed with the court cannot alone compel an inquiry and disposition by the court. The State bases its argument on the ground that our prior decisions in which we held that statements triggered Rule 4-215(e) all involved oral declarations made in open court. In none of those cases, however, were we called upon to consider whether the Rule meant that an oral declaration made in open court is the <em>only </em>way to invoke the Rule. Furthermore, when we stated in <em>Davis </em>that a request to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"490\">*490</page-number>discharge counsel <em>\u201cneed not be made in writing </em>or even formally worded,\u201d 415 Md. at 31, 997 A.2d at 785 (emphasis added), the clear implication was that a written request may suffice under the Rule.</p>\n<p id=\"b520-5\">Here, Williams presented the Circuit Court with a request, in his own words, to discharge counsel. That Williams relayed those words by his pen, instead of his voice, is of no consequence. Moreover, that he delivered his request outside of open court is equally inconsequential. To hold otherwise would be to engraft impermissibly additional language into the Rule. <em>See, e.g., Bd. of Cnty. Comm\u2019rs v. Marcas, L.L.C., </em>415 Md. 676, 685, 4 A.3d 946, 951 (2010) (\u201cWe neither add nor delete language so as to reflect an intent not evidenced in the plain and unambiguous language of the [Rule].\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b520-6\">Of course, a danger to be guarded against when a defendant chooses a letter format, rather than something stated plainly in open court, is the trial court being sandbagged or the \u201cmine being salted.\u201d<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Although perhaps unstated as such in <em>Northam, </em>there is an undercurrent to the Court\u2019s reasoning that burying such a request in a more expansive writing will not necessarily be cognizable as a Rule 4-215(e) trigger. Here, no such ulterior motive is so obviously present. Even if a defendant harbors a hope that a letter (even expressing succinctly the desire to fire present counsel) in the court jacket may go unobserved by a busy trial judge (or group of trial judges, as was the case here), a busy prosecutor, or his/her defense counsel, and thus create insurance guaranteeing a \u201cdo-over\u201d if the defendant is convicted, that degree of slyness<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> can be protected against by reasonable diligence on the part of the other <em>dramatis personae </em>in criminal litigation, not the least of which could be the Clerk\u2019s Office transmitting the court jacket to a judge (with a copy of the letter appended <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"491\">*491</page-number>to the front) when a document such as was filed here is received.</p>\n<p id=\"b521-4\">Second, the State\u2019s reliance here on the need for a defendant to indicate a \u201cpresent desire\u201d to discharge counsel misconstrues our decisions. We noted in <em>Davis </em>that, to trigger Rule 4-215(e), a statement must indicate the defendant\u2019s \u201cpresent intent to seek a different legal advisor.\u201d 415 Md. at 33, 997 A.2d at 786. In that case, defense counsel told the administrative judge, on the morning of trial, that the defendant indicated, in a prior conversation, that he \u201c[wjanted a jury trial and new counsel,\u201d and that \u201cI told him it was very unlikely that the Court was going to award him another attorney in this case.\u201d 415 Md. at 27, 997 A.2d at 782. Thus, the first representation to the court that the defendant intended to discharge his counsel was expressed in the past tense and was unclear as to whether the defendant still harbored that intent. We concluded that, although Rule 4-215(e) does not mandate an inquiry where the court is informed only of a prior intent to discharge counsel, \u201cthe Court at least was required to inquire further so it could determine whether Davis still maintained that intent.\u201d <em>Davis, </em>415 Md. at 33, 997 A.2d at 786.</p>\n<p id=\"b521-5\">Williams\u2019s request was written and expressed in the present tense. It would be illogical to hold that a court may allow a defendant\u2019s expression of a present desire to discharge counsel (sufficient to trigger Rule 4-215(e)) to moulder into a past desire (not sufficient to trigger the Rule) by neglecting, overlooking, or otherwise failing to address promptly the defendant\u2019s clear request. Moreover, even if we were to accept the argument that Williams\u2019s aged request reflected a past desire, <em>Davis </em>requires that the court determine, at some point prior to trial, whether Williams continued to harbor an intent to discharge counsel.</p>\n<p id=\"b521-6\">The Court of Special Appeals erred by relying too uncritically on <em>Northam. </em>We did not hold in <em>Northam </em>that a request to discharge counsel must be made orally or in open court; nor did we hold that a request sufficient to trigger Rule <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"492\">*492</page-number>4-215(e) may be waived effectively by failure to repeat it or otherwise bring it to the court\u2019s attention once filed in writing. We concluded that Northam\u2019s written request was insufficient to trigger Rule 4-215(e) because it was vague and obscured by the larger body of the written motion captioned as (and concerned with) a Motion for Change of Venue. We touched briefly upon the matter of waiver in <em>Northam </em>only in the context of omnibus motions, where, like Northam\u2019s request for a \u201cCourt appointed attorney,\u201d a single sentence request or issue is concealed or obscured by other issues in the particular form where it is raised. Williams\u2019s request does not suffer from the problems of vagueness or obscurity \u2014 his request is singular and unambiguous. Any argument to the contrary is belied by the Circuit Court Clerk\u2019s docket entry on 29 January 2010 reflecting the filing of a \u201cLetter of Defendant requesting new representation from the public defender\u2019s office.\u201d Because we conclude that Williams\u2019s letter was sufficient for the Circuit Court to recognize it as a request to discharge counsel, the onus was on the Circuit Court to \u201cpermit the defendant to explain the reasons for the request.\u201d Md. Rule 4-215(e). By failing to do so, the Circuit Court violated the Rule.</p>\n<p id=\"b522-5\">Additionally, we agree with Williams\u2019s argument that the Court of Special Appeals erred by concluding that \u201cit was reasonable for the trial court to infer that any issues between the appellant and Mr. Janowich had been resolved, and that [Williams] was assenting to his continued representation by Mr. Janowich.\u201d <em>Williams, </em>208 Md.App. at 634, 57 A.3d at 516. That conclusion assumes too much. More specifically, it assumes that at least one of the judges who presided over the hearings and the trial read the letter, which the intermediate appellate court could not confirm based on the record.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> If a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"493\">*493</page-number>Circuit Court judge did read the letter, that judge could not assume that Williams and Janowich ever discussed, and resolved subsequently, the reasons for the discharge request. It is possible that Williams sent the discharge request directly to the court because he was uncomfortable discussing the request \"with, or in front of, Janowich. Because the Circuit Court did not confirm whether Janowich was aware of the request, it could not presume or rely on Janowich\u2019s ethical obligation to disclose the request, under the Maryland Lawyers Rules of Professional Conduct,<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> as proof that Williams abandoned his intent to seek new counsel.</p>\n<p id=\"b523-5\">Based on the record in the present case, we do not know whether the absence of a Rule 4-215(e) inquiry by the Circuit Court was the result of an oversight, a mistake, the adoption of what Williams calls a \u201cwait-and-see approach,\u201d or some other reason. Similarly, we do not know whether Williams refrained from repeating his desire in open court because he changed his mind, thought the court denied implicitly his request, thought that pressing the issue further would anger the court or Janowich, or he was adopting his own \u201cwait-and-see approach,\u201d hoping to use the court\u2019s failure to respond to his letter as grounds to reverse a potential conviction. Most <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"494\">*494</page-number>importantly, we do not know all of Williams\u2019s reasons for requesting the discharge in January 2010 and whether they were meritorious \u2014 the purpose behind the mandates of Rule 4 \u2014 215(e).</p>\n<p id=\"b524-5\">We hold that Williams\u2019s unambiguous and to-the-point letter was sufficient, on its own, to constitute a request to discharge counsel under Rule 4-215(e). The Circuit Court\u2019s failure to inquire into the reasons for that request before trial, in accordance with the Rule, is reversible error.</p>\n<p id=\"b524-6\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b524-7\">The second question before us arises from circumstances that are atypical and extraordinary in contemporary society. A bystander, of his own volition and without prompting from law enforcement officers, intervened physically to assist officers in effectuating an arrest.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> We are asked to decide the novel question of whether force used by the arrestee against the volunteer in this case can support a conviction for resisting arrest under Maryland\u2019s resisting arrest statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b524-8\">A.</p>\n<p id=\"b524-9\">Williams urges us to hold that the Court of Special Appeals erred when it concluded that the use of force necessary to prove a resisting arrest charge may be force \u201cemployed against someone other than the police officer who is attempting to effectuate the arrest.\u201d In support of that argument, Williams contends that the intermediate appellate court\u2019s conclusion misinterprets the plain language of Md.Code, Criminal Law Art., \u00a7 9-408. Williams points to the language of resisting arrest statutes in other jurisdictions to justify his interpretation of the plain language of \u00a7 9-408. Furthermore, Williams claims that the holding of the Court of Special <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"495\">*495</page-number>Appeals is inconsistent with the common law of Maryland and the General Assembly\u2019s purpose in enacting \u00a7 9-408.</p>\n<p id=\"b525-5\">Not surprisingly, the State disagrees with Williams\u2019s reading of the plain language of \u00a7 9-408, and argues that the Court of Special Appeals interpreted correctly the language of subsection (b)(1), which contains no reference to police officers as the sole objects of the prohibited force. The State refutes similarly Williams\u2019s reliance on foreign statutes, his claims regarding the purpose of \u00a7 9-408, and his interpretation of Maryland common law. Moreover, the State urges us to uphold the judgment of the Court of Special Appeals based on our recent opinion in <em>Nicolas v. State, </em>426 Md. 385, 44 A.3d 396 (2012).</p>\n<p id=\"b525-6\">B.</p>\n<p id=\"b525-7\">The General Assembly enacted Maryland\u2019s resisting arrest statute in 2004. The statute reads, in full:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b525-8\">(a) <em>\u201cPolice officer\u201d defined. </em>\u2014 In this section, \u201cpolice officer\u201d means an individual who is authorized to make an arrest under Title 2 of the Criminal Procedure Article.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b525-9\">(b) <em>Prohibited. </em>\u2014 A person may not intentionally:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b525-10\">(1) resist a lawful arrest; or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b525-11\">(2) interfere with an individual who the person has reason to know is a police officer who is making or attempting to make a lawful arrest or detention of another person.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b525-12\">(c) <em>Penalty. </em>\u2014 A person who violates this section is guilty of a misdemeanor and is subject to imprisonment not exceeding 3 years or a fine not exceeding $5,000 or both.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b525-13\">(d) <em>Unit of prosecution. </em>\u2014 The unit of prosecution for a violation of this section is based on the arrest or detention regardless of the number of police officers involved in the arrest or detention.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b525-14\">Md.Code (2002, 2011 Cum.Supp.), Criminal Law Art., \u00a7 9-408. Although the General Assembly changed the common law by criminalizing third-party interference with a lawful arrest in \u00a7 9-408(b)(2), it did not alter by enacting subsection (b)(1) the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"496\">*496</page-number>common law elements of the crime of resisting arrest. <em>McNeal v. State, </em>200 Md.App. 510, 526, 28 A.3d 88, 97 (2011).</p>\n<p id=\"b526-5\">The year before the General Assembly enacted \u00a7 9-408, we considered the common law elements of resisting arrest in <em>Purnell v. State, </em>375 Md. 678, 827 A.2d 68 (2003). We compared analyses of the elements of the offense in <em>Preston v. Warden of the Maryland House of Correction, </em>225 Md. 628, 629, 169 A.2d 407, 408 (1961), where we stated that the elements are \u201c \u2018refusal to submit to lawful arrest and resistance to an officer of the law in the performance of his duties,\u2019 \u201d and <em>Barnhard v. State, </em>325 Md. 602, 609-10, 602 A.2d 701, 704-05 (1992), where we approved a jury instruction stating the elements as: \u201c(1) the defendant was arrested; (2) the arrest was lawful; and (3) the defendant refused to submit to the arrest.\u2019 \u201d <em>Purnell, </em>375 Md. at 695, 827 A.2d at 78. We adopted as the elements of the offense the <em>Barnhard </em>formulation. <em>Id. </em>Explaining our adoption of the <em>Barnhard </em>elements, we noted that \u201c[ujnlike the statement of the elements made by the <em>Preston </em>Court, <em>Barnhard\u2019s </em>formulation does not refer to a \u2018law enforcement officer,\u2019 as the object of the resistance.\u201d <em>Purnell, </em>375 Md. at 695-96, 827 A.2d at 78. The statement of the elements expressed in <em>Barnhard, </em>and adopted in <em>Purnell, </em>constituted the common law elements of the crime of resisting arrest at the time that the Legislature codified it in 2004.</p>\n<p id=\"b526-6\">C.</p>\n<p id=\"b526-7\">We reject the State\u2019s argument that we may decide this case based on <em>Nicolas. </em>In that case, we compared the elements of second degree assault and resisting arrest to determine whether the offenses merge for sentencing purposes. In doing so, we stated \u201cwe agree with the State\u2019s contention that the force element of resisting arrest need not always constitute second degree assault against a law enforcement officer.\u201d 426 Md. at 407, 44 A.3d at 409. The State submits that this statement in <em>Nicolas </em>is the equivalent of the Court of Special Appeals\u2019s holding in this case that \u201c[t]he necessary force [to sustain a conviction for resisting arrest] may be employed against someone other than the police officer who is attempt<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"497\">*497</page-number>ing to effectuate the arrest.\u201d <em>Williams, </em>208 Md.App. at 642, 57 A.3d at 520. <em>Au contraire. Nicolas </em>did not require us to contemplate the use of force against persons other than law enforcement officers. We decline to be circumscribed by that literal statement under the circumstances and context of this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b527-4\">We do agree, however, with the State\u2019s argument that Williams misreads the plain language of \u00a7 9 \u2014 408(b)(1). Williams makes much of the fact that Maryland\u2019s resisting arrest statute contains a definition of the term \u201cpolice officer\u201d in subsection (a), and uses that term in subsections (b)(2) and (d). He argues, essentially, that the presence of the term \u201cpolice officer\u201d in those subsections suggests that the Legislature intended subsection (b)(1) to subsume and apply only to police officers. Williams points out that the definition of \u201cpolice officer\u201d from the Criminal Procedure Article, cross-referenced in \u00a7 9-408(a), does not include civilians who, like the gentleman in the present case, intervene with the apparent intent of helping police officers to effectuate an arrest. <em>See </em>Md.Code (2001, 2008 RepLVol.), Criminal Procedure Art., \u00a7 2-101(c). The definition of the term \u201cpolice officer\u201d and subsequent uses of that term in \u00a7 9-408, however, belies Williams\u2019s argument.</p>\n<p id=\"b527-5\">Section 9-408(a) states, \u201c[i]n this section, \u2018police officer\u2019 means ... [,]\u201d for the purposes of ascribing a particular meaning to the term \u201cpolice officer\u201d whenever it is used actually in the resisting arrest statute. But the Legislature did not include the term \u201cpolice officer\u201d in subsection (b)(1), the provision of the statute implicated in this case; rather, \u00a7 9 \u2014 408(b)(1) states simply that it is a crime to \u201cresist a lawful arrest.\u201d Because the term \u201cpolice officer\u201d is included in subsections (b)(2) and (d), we presume that the General Assembly would include the term also in subsection (b)(1) if it intended police officers to be sole subjects of the resistance. By leaving the term \u201cpolice officer\u201d out of subsection (b)(1), the General Assembly fashioned a statute that was consistent with the common law elements of resisting arrest as defined in <em>Purnell, </em>and our conclusion there that \u201cresisting arrest is, in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"498\">*498</page-number>short, an offense against the State and not personally against the officers.\u201d 375 Md. at 698, 827 A.2d at 80.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b528-5\">Reviewing the many statutes Williams cites from other states does not change our view of the plain language of \u00a7 9-408(b)(1). Even if we were to look to those statutes for guidance in our plain language analysis, which we need not do, we are not persuaded by the arguments Williams derives from their language.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> We are unwilling to conclude that the Maryland Legislature intended \u00a7 9-408(b)(l) to criminalize only force used against police officers because it could have adopted language similar to those states whose resisting arrest statutes refer to the use of force \u201cagainst the peace officer or another,\u201d if it wanted to include civilians. <em>See, e.g., </em>Ariz.Rev.Stat. Ann. \u00a7 13-2508 (2003) (West). Nor are we convinced, as Williams urges, that \u00a7 9-408(b)(l) applies only to force used against police officers because Delaware\u2019s resisting arrest statute refers to \u201cpeace officer[s],\u201d and a reference in the General Assembly\u2019s Fiscal Policy Note states that the members of the House subcommittee who recommended the original resisting arrest bill in Maryland \u201cloosely based their recommendation on Delaware\u2019s codification.\u201d<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> We have no clear indications concerning which aspects of the totality of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"499\">*499</page-number>\u00a7 9-408 may be \u201cloosely based\u201d upon Delaware\u2019s resisting arrest statute. One of the most glaring of the myriad differences between \u00a7 9-408 and the pertinent parts of Delaware\u2019s statute is the conspicuous absence of \u201cpeace officer,\u201d or any similar term, in subsection (b)(1).</p>\n<p id=\"b529-4\">Williams does not challenge whether the officers were acting lawfully when they arrested him; nor does he challenge whether the intervention of the bystander who tackled him constituted a citizen\u2019s arrest, and, if so, whether such an arrest would be a \u201clawful\u201d one under \u00a7 9 \u2014 408(b)(1).<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> Therefore, we shall assume, for present purposes, that the police officers were attempting lawfully to arrest Williams, and need only consider whether the requisite resistance-by-force element was proved under the circumstances of this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b529-5\">Assuming the arrest of Williams was lawful, we do not think the General Assembly intended to preclude a resisting arrest charge arising under the peculiar facts of this case. We agree with the Court of Special Appeals\u2019s conclusion that \u201c[t]he plain language of [\u00a7 9-408(b)(l) ] does not specify that a defendant may be found guilty of resisting arrest only if he employs force against the police officer who is attempting to arrest him.\u201d <em>Williams v. State, </em>208 Md.App. at 641, 57 A.3d at 520. It is reasonable to conclude from the evidence presented at Williams\u2019s trial that: (1) the bystander was aware that Krulock and Schultz were attempting to arrest Williams; (2) he tackled voluntarily Williams with the intent of helping the officers effectuate the arrest; (3) Williams used physical force against the bystander in the ensuing struggle; and, (4) <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"500\">*500</page-number>Williams\u2019s use of force was for the purposes of resisting the imminent arrest by the officers who were in hot and close pursuit. We hold that, on the record of the present case, the Court of Special Appeals did not misinterpret the plain language of \u00a7 9^408(b)(l).</p>\n<p id=\"b530-5\">JUDGMENT OF THE COURT OF SPECIAL APPEALS REVERSED IN PART AND AFFIRMED IN PART.
