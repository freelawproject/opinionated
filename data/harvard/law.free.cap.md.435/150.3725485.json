One such measure is the Jones Act, 46 U.S.C. \u00a7 30104, which provides a seaman with a cause of action against the seaman\u2019s employer for injuries incurred within the scope of employment.</p>\n<p id=\"b183-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"153\">*153</page-number>Who is a \u201cseaman\u201d? This is a recurring question in the case law under the Jones Act. The Supreme Court offered guidance in three decisions in the 1990s, but subsequent lower court decisions have resulted in a tempest of varying, and often conflicting, interpretations.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Although as a state court we do not speak authoritatively on this issue, it is our task in this case to discern what we can from these decisions.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b183-5\">In the complaint under the Jones Act that commenced this case, William S. Dize<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> alleged that he was injured as a result of the negligence by his employer, Respondent Association of Maryland Pilots (the \u201cAssociation\u201d). Whether that claim was properly made under the Jones Act depends on whether Mr. Dize was a \u201cseaman\u201d at the time of the alleged negligence. To distinguish seamen from land-based workers, the Supreme Court has adopted a \u201crule of thumb\u201d that a seaman must ordinarily have spent at least 30 percent of work time in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"154\">*154</page-number>service of a vessel in navigation. We hold, consistent with the purpose of the Jones Act and guidance of the Supreme Court, that the time Mr. Dize spent maintaining vessels that were dockside or ashore is not to be considered and, accordingly, that the lower courts correctly concluded that he was not a seaman.</p>\n<p id=\"b184-4\">Background</p>\n<p id=\"b184-5\">\n<em>Remedies for Seamen</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b184-6\">Remedies for employment-related injuries of seamen are provided under federal admiralty law rather than state worker compensation schemes. <em>Southern Pac. Co. v. Jensen, </em>244 U.S. 205, 218, 37 S.Ct. 524, 61 L.Ed. 1086 (1917). Two of those remedies have long existed under general maritime law, but are limited in scope. A third, broader, remedy has been created by statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b184-7\">Under general maritime law at the beginning of the 20th century, a maritime worker had two potential claims for injuries incurred during employment in service of a vessel: seaworthiness and \u201cmaintenance and cure.\u201d A ship owner has an \u201cabsolute, non-delegable\u201d duty to a seaman to provide a seaworthy vessel; liability for an unseaworthy vessel attaches regardless of fault. <em>Chisholm v. UHP Projects, </em>205 F.3d 731, 734 (4th Cir.2000). The warranty of seaworthiness applies only to vessels that are \u201cin navigation.\u201d <em>Roper v. United States, </em>368 U.S. 20, 82 S.Ct. 5, 7 L.Ed.2d 1 (1961). \u201cA claim for maintenance and cure relates to the vessel owner\u2019s obligation to provide food,' lodging, and medical' services to a seaman injured while serving the ship.\u201d <em>Lewis v. Lewis &amp; Clark Marine, Inc., </em>531 U.S. 438, 441, 121 S.Ct. 993, 148 L.Ed.2d 931 (2001).</p>\n<p id=\"b184-8\">Neither \u201cseaworthiness\u201d nor \u201cmaintenance and cure\u201d provided a seaman with a cause of action for negligence of a ship owner. <em>The Osceola, </em>189 U.S. 158, 175, 23 S.Ct. 483, 47 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"155\">*155</page-number>L.Ed. 760 (1903).<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> Congress created such a cause of action when it passed the Jones Act in 1920. That statute reads, in pertinent part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b185-5\">A seaman injured in the course of employment or, if the seaman dies from the injury, the personal representative of the seaman may elect to bring a civil action at law, with the right to a trial by jury, against the employer.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b185-6\">46 U.S.C. \u00a7 30104. To prevail on a negligence claim under the Jones Act, a seaman must show: \u201c(1) that he is a seaman under the Act; (2) that he suffered injury in the course of his employment; (3) that his employer was negligent; and (4) that his employer\u2019s negligence caused his injury at least in part.\u201d <em>Martin v. Harris, </em>560 F.3d 210, 216 (4th Cir.2009).<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> The term \u201cseaman\u201d is not defined in the Jones Act. But, as in many cases under the Jones Act, the interpretation of that term is key to the decision of this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b185-7\">\n<em>Mr. Dize\u2019s Employment</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b185-8\">Mr. Dize initially worked for the Association as a launch boat operator at the Solomons Island Transfer Station in Solomons, Maryland, beginning in the 1980s. In that capacity, he transported pilots to and from large commercial ships traveling on the Chesapeake Bay \u2014 a duty that he continued to perform after he was promoted to assistant station manager in 1997. As assistant station manager, Mr. Dize worked every other week but, during the weeks he was on duty, he was on-call all day every day. As will become apparent, the allocation <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"156\">*156</page-number>of his work time among the various duties of assistant station manager is significant for determining whether he was a seaman at the time of the alleged negligence in 2007.</p>\n<p id=\"b186-4\">During the five-year period prior to his injury, Mr. Dize spent somewhat less than 20 percent of his time operating launches.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> He also did maintenance work on the launches, both in the water and while the boats were undergoing overhaul and refits in dry dock. In deposition testimony, Mr. Dize estimated that, while the launches were tied up at the dock, he spent between 42 and 50 percent of his time on maintenance tasks such as painting; sanding; changing propellers, rotors, shafts, and rub rails; replacing zinc anodes; cleaning the boat interiors; and fueling. Relying on its records, the Association also estimated that between 3 and 5 percent of Mr. Dize\u2019s time was spent on overhaul and refits while the boats were out of the water. Adding up those estimates, Mr. Dize calculated that well over 60 percent of his time was spent operating, or performing maintenance on, launch boats. Mr. Dize also performed general maintenance on station buildings and property, ordered work supplies and groceries, unloaded trucks, installed rugs, mowed the lawn, and cleaned the docks.</p>\n<p id=\"b186-5\">In January 2008, Mr. Dize was diagnosed with silicosis. He thereafter suffered increasing breathing difficulties, required supplemental oxygen to live, and eventually died from his illness in September 2012.</p>\n<p id=\"b186-6\">\n<em>Negligence Action under the Jones Act</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b186-7\">On May 22, 2008, Mr. Dize sued the Association in the Circuit Court for Baltimore City, pursuant to the Jones Act, alleging negligence in regard to injuries he suffered from <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"157\">*157</page-number>exposure to free silica during a sandblasting project.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> The complaint alleged that, as part of his duties in June 2007, Mr. Dize sandblasted paint off the bottom of an Association boat in dry dock, using coal slag abrasive that contained free silica. It further alleged that the Association did not perform adequate occupational safety testing, as required by federal and State work safety standards, to determine whether Mr. Dize was fit to participate in sandblasting or should have worn a respirator mask while doing so. Because he had previously suffered from lung disease, the complaint alleged, he likely would have been excluded from the work as a result of the test.</p>\n<p id=\"b187-5\">In January 2010, both Mr. Dize and the Association filed motions for summary judgment.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> The Association argued that Mr. Dize was not a seaman for purposes of the Jones Act and therefore could not maintain a negligence claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b187-6\">On February 25, 2010, the Circuit Court granted the Association\u2019s motion for summary judgment on the Jones Act claim on the basis that Mr. Dize was not a seaman at the time of his injury.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> In doing so, the court concluded that Mr. Dize had not spent 30 percent of his work time in service of vessels in navigation, as required by a \u201crule of thumb\u201d adopted by the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"158\">*158</page-number>Supreme Court to decide seaman status for Jones Act cases. Mr. Dize appealed. On March 8, 2012, the Court of Special Appeals, in an unreported opinion, affirmed the Circuit Court. At the request of the Association, the court reissued its decision as a reported opinion on May 31, 2012. <em>See Dize v. Ass\u2019n of Md. Pilots, </em>205 Md.App. 176, 44 A.3d 1033 (2012).</p>\n<p id=\"b188-5\">We granted certiorari to resolve whether, in determining Mr. Dize\u2019s status for purposes of the Jones Act, work time spent maintaining vessels that are moored, dockside, or ashore is to be counted along with time spent at sea.</p>\n<p id=\"b188-6\">Discussion</p>\n<p id=\"b188-7\">\n<em>Standard Of Review</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b188-8\">A Circuit Court may grant summary judgment if there is no genuine dispute as to any material fact and the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law. Maryland Rule 2 \u2014 501(f)- With specific reference to the Jones Act, the issue of seaman status is a mixed question of law and fact, for which summary judgment is appropriate \u201cwhere the facts and law reasonably support only one conclusion.\u201d <em>Harbor Tug &amp; Barge Co. v. Papai, </em>520 U.S. 548, 554, 117 S.Ct. 1535, 137 L.Ed.2d 800 (1997) (citations omitted). Our role is to review whether the Circuit Court\u2019s legal conclusions were correct without according any special deference to that court. <em>D\u2019Aoust v. Diamond, </em>424 Md. 549, 574, 36 A.3d 941 (2012).</p>\n<p id=\"b188-9\">\n<em>Seaman Status under the Jones Act</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b188-10\">As indicated above, the Jones Act does not itself define the term \u201cseaman.\u201d Courts have defined the term affirmatively by looking to the meaning of the term in the general maritime law that preceded the Jones Act and negatively by distinguishing seamen for purposes of the Jones Act from land-based maritime workers covered by the less generous and later-enacted Longshore and Harbor Workers\u2019 Compensation Act (\u201cLHWCA\u201d). The key factors that are currently applied by the courts, including a numerical rule of thumb, derive from three Supreme Court decisions during the 1990s.</p>\n<p id=\"b189-3\">\n<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"159\">*159</page-number>\n<em>Relation to Seaman under General Maritime Law</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"AXl\">When the Supreme Court upheld the constitutionality of the Jones Act a few years after its passage, it appeared to equate seaman status under the statute to that under general maritime law. <em>Panama R. Co. v. Johnson, </em>264 U.S. 375, 388-89, 44 S.Ct. 391, 68 L.Ed. 748 (1924). Shortly thereafter, however, the Court, stating that \u201cwords are flexible,\u201d held that the statute also applied to an injured longshoreman even though a longshoreman did not fit the common understanding of a \u201cseaman.\u201d <em>Int'l Stevedoring Co. v. Haverty, </em>272 U.S. 50, 52, 47 S.Ct. 19, 71 L.Ed. 157 (1926) (stevedore injured while storing freight in ship hold covered by the Act).</p>\n<p id=\"b189-4\">\n<em>Relation to Workers Covered by LHWCA</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b189-5\">In 1927 \u2014 one year after <em>Haverty </em>\u2014 Congress enacted the LHWCA. That statute provides compensation and other remedies for land-based maritime employees who suffer injuries while working on navigable waters \u201cincluding any adjoining pier, wharf, dry dock, terminal, building way, marine railway, or other adjoining area customarily used by an employer in loading, unloading, repairing, dismantling, or building a vessel.\u201d 33 U.S.C. \u00a7 903(a). The LHWCA specifically omitted from its coverage \u201ca master or member of a crew of any vessel.\u201d 33 U.S.C. \u00a7 902(3)(G). The Supreme Court held that this exclusion is synonymous with \u201cseaman\u201d under the Jones Act and that the LHWCA \u201cconfine[d] the benefits of the Jones Act to the members of the crew of a vessel.\u201d <em>Swanson v. Marra Bros., </em>328 U.S. 1, 7, 66 S.Ct. 869, 90 L.Ed. 1045 (1946). As construed in <em>Swanson, </em>the LHWCA thus had the effect of narrowing Haverty\u2019s broad construction of the term \u201cseaman\u201d under the Jones Act.</p>\n<p id=\"b189-6\">\n<em>Efforts to Distinguish Seamen from Land-Based Workers</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"At3\">In the 12 years following <em>Swanson, </em>the Court continued to provide guidance on the definition of \u201cseaman,\u201d although its holdings were not easily condensed into an understandable standard. In <em>Desper v. Starved Rock Ferry Co., </em>342 U.S. 187, 72 S.Ct. 216, 96 L.Ed. 205 (1952), the Court held that a pilot of sightseeing vessels who was killed during off-season work on a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"160\">*160</page-number>ship that had been taken out of the water was not a seaman in those circumstances. The Court found persuasive that \u201cthere was no vessel engaged in navigation\u201d and that the activity that caused the injury was not typically a duty of a seaman. 342 U.S. at 190, 72 S.Ct. 216.</p>\n<p id=\"b190-4\">Nevertheless, five years later, in determining whether a handyman from an anchored dredge could recover under the Jones Act for injuries suffered while transporting equipment on the shore, the Court decided that whether the vessel was in transit during the worker\u2019s employment was not pertinent to seaman status. Rather, the designation \u201cseaman\u201d was appropriate where \u201csubstantially all\u201d of the employee\u2019s duties were performed \u201con or for\u201d the vessel. <em>Senko v. La Crosse Dredging Corp., </em>352 U.S. 370, 372, 77 S.Ct. 415, 1 L.Ed.2d 404 (1957). That the injury occurred on land was not relevant to the analysis, although it was appropriate to consider whether the worker would \u201chave a significant navigational function\u201d when the vessel was in transit. 352 U.S. at 373, 77 S.Ct. 415. A seaman therefore did not necessarily have to be employed on a vessel in transit at the time of the injury, but perhaps had to have duties that assisted in the navigation of a vessel. <em>See Butler v. Whiteman, </em>356 U.S. 271, 78 S.Ct. 734, 2 L.Ed.2d 754 (1958).</p>\n<p id=\"b190-5\">For the next three decades, the Supreme Court had nothing further to say on the subject. Meanwhile, the federal circuit courts of appeals split on whether the worker\u2019s employment had to aid the navigation of a vessel in order to qualify for Jones Act coverage. <em>See </em>DeGravelles, <em>Harbor Tug &amp; Barge Co. v. Papai: Another Turn in the Labyrinth? </em>10 U.S.F. Mar. L.J. 209, 211 (1998).</p>\n<p id=\"b190-6\">\n<em>Deriving the Modem Test for Seaman Status</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b190-7\">The Supreme Court revisited the question of seaman status under the Jones Act in three cases during the 1990s in which it attempted to devise a workable test.</p>\n<p id=\"b190-8\"><em>Wilander </em>\u2014 whether <em>the worker must aid navigation</em></p>\n<p id=\"b190-9\">In <em>McDermott Int\u2019l, Inc. v. Wilander, </em>498 U.S. 337, 111 S.Ct. 807, 112 L.Ed.2d 866 (1991), the Court held that a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"161\">*161</page-number>worker on a paint boat who supervised sandblasting and painting of oil drilling platforms at sea was a \u201cseaman\u201d even though he did not aid in the navigation of the vessel to which he was assigned. Reasoning that Congress had not intended to limit the Jones Act only to employees with navigational duties and noting that all workers on ships in navigation risk the perils of the sea, the Court employed a broader test: whether a worker asserting seaman status has a \u201cconnection\u201d to a vessel in <em>navigation </em>\u2014 i.e., whether the employee \u201ccontribute[s] to the function of the vessel or to the accomplishment of its mission\u201d and does \u201cthe ship\u2019s work.\u201d 498 U.S. at 354-55, 111 S.Ct. 807.</p>\n<p id=\"b191-4\"><em>Chand\u00f1s </em>\u2014 articulating <em>a two-part test</em></p>\n<p id=\"b191-5\">Four years later, the Court elaborated on the extent and nature of the required \u201cconnection\u201d in <em>Chandris, Inc. v. Latsis, </em>515 U.S. 347, 115 S.Ct. 2172, 132 L.Ed.2d 314 (1995). Mr. Latsis was an engineering supervisor who worked primarily from an office on shore but occasionally traveled on his employer\u2019s vessels. On one such trip, he injured his eye and received, he alleged, substandard care from the ship\u2019s doctor that resulted in a significant loss of vision in the eye. After he recuperated from his injury on shore, he returned to the ship and sailed to Germany, where he remained with the vessel while it underwent renovations in dry dock. Six months later, he traveled back to the United States aboard the ship. In his lawsuit under the Jones Act, Mr. Latsis claimed that he spent 72 percent of his employment working on his employer\u2019s vessels, while the employer put the figure at closer to 10 percent. The trial court instructed the jury that the time that Mr. Latsis spent with the ship while it was in drydock could not be considered because the ship was not \u201cin navigation.\u201d The jury returned a verdict in favor of the ship owner on the basis that Mr. Latsis was not a seaman.</p>\n<p id=\"b191-6\">The Supreme Court held that the trial court had defined \u201cin navigation\u201d too narrowly and remanded the case for a retrial. The Court also stated certain principles for the determination of seaman status. The Jones Act is \u201creserved for sea-based <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"162\">*162</page-number>maritime employees whose work regularly exposes them to the special hazards and disadvantages to which they who go down to sea in ships are subjected.\u201d <em>Chandris, </em>515 U.S. at 370, 115 S.Ct. 2172 (internal citations omitted).<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> The policy of the Act is \u201cto protect sea-based maritime workers, who owe their allegiance to a vessel, and not land-based employees, who do not.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 376, 115 S.Ct. 2172. Accordingly, whether an employee is covered by the Jones Act depends on the status of the employee\u2019s relationship with the vessel or vessels, not the cause or place of the injury.</p>\n<p id=\"b192-5\">To aid in the analysis, the Court created a two-part test. To be a \u201cseaman\u201d under the Jones Act, the employee must (1) contribute to the function of a vessel or to the accomplishment of its mission, and (2) have a connection to a vessel in navigation that is substantial in both duration and nature. <em>Chandris, </em>515 U.S. at 368, 115 S.Ct. 2172. The Court explained that the purpose of the latter requirement was to give \u201cfull effect to the remedial scheme created by Congress and to separate the sea-based maritime employees who are entitled to Jones Act protection from those land-based workers who have only a transitory or sporadic connection to a vessel in navigation and, therefore, whose employment does not regularly expose them to the perils of the sea.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b192-6\">As to the temporal element of its <em>test </em>\u2014 i.e., whether the duration of the employee\u2019s connection to a vessel in navigation was substantial \u2014 the Court favorably referred to a rule of thumb that had been developed in the Fifth Circuit: \u201ca worker who spends less than about 30 percent of his time in the service of a vessel in navigation\u201d would presumably not satisfy the substantial duration requirement. <em>Chandris, </em>515 U.S. at 371, 115 S.Ct. 2172. The Court also referred to this rule of thumb as computing the percentage of time \u201con <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"163\">*163</page-number>vessels\u201d or \u201caboard ship.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 367, 115 S.Ct. 2172.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> The Supreme Court characterized 30 percent as a guideline and noted that \u201cdeparture from it will certainly be justified in appropriate cases.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 371, 115 S.Ct. 2172.</p>\n<p id=\"b193-5\">In a passage that has generated some confusion as to where an employee may work for the time to be counted toward seaman status under the 30 percent guideline, the Court also considered whether a vessel in dry dock was necessarily not \u201cin navigation.\u201d The Court held that a vessel undergoing repairs or spending a relatively short period of time in dry dock is still \u201cin navigation\u201d; at some point, however, repairs become \u201csufficiently significant\u201d that the ship must be considered out of navigation. <em>Chandris, </em>515 U.S. at 374, 115 S.Ct. 2172. In the case before it, the Court held that, in light of the conflicting evidence in the record as to the significance of the dry dock repairs and the potential significance of evidence from that period as to Mr. Latsis\u2019 duties, the trial court\u2019s jury instruction that the period in dry dock was to be disregarded was erroneous. Accordingly, the Court remanded the case for a new trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b193-6\"><em>Harbor Tug </em>\u2014 connection <em>to vessel must take worker \u201cto sea\u201d</em></p>\n<p id=\"b193-7\">Only two years after the <em>Chandris </em>decision, the Court provided a further clarification that seemingly narrowed the definition of seaman. In <em>Harbor Tug &amp; Barge Co. v. Papai, </em>520 U.S. 548, 117 S.Ct. 1535, 137 L.Ed.2d 800 (1997), the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"164\">*164</page-number>Court held that a deckhand who never went to sea and was injured during a one-day painting assignment on a tugboat was not a seaman under the Jones Act. The Court emphasized that seamen are \u201cthose workers who face regular exposure to the perils of the sea.\u201d 520 U.S. at 560, 117 S.Ct. 1535. Accordingly, \u201c[f]or the substantial connection requirement to serve its purpose, the inquiry into the <em>nature </em>of the employee\u2019s connection to the vessel must concentrate on whether the employee\u2019s duties take him to sea. This will give substance to the inquiry both as to <em>duration and nature </em>of the employee\u2019s connection to the vessel and be helpful in distinguishing land-based from sea-based employees.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 555, 117 S.Ct. 1535 (emphasis added). Thus, although the Court in that case was focused on the nature of the employee\u2019s connection to a ship in navigation, it related the seagoing nature of the employee\u2019s duties to the duration test as well. In the case before it, the Court held that the deckhand did not have seaman status in part because his duties \u201cdid not include any seagoing activity\u201d but consisted only of maintenance work while the boat was docked. <em>Id. </em>at 559, 117 S.Ct. 1535.</p>\n<p id=\"b194-4\">\n<em>Application of the Chandris Test to Mr. Dize</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b194-5\">The resolution of this case turns on the application of the <em>Chandris </em>test to the circumstances of Mr. Dize\u2019s employment. Under that test, Mr. Dize would qualify as a seaman under the Jones Act if his position (1) contributed to the function of a vessel or to the accomplishment of its mission, and (2) had a connection to a vessel in navigation that was substantial in both duration and nature. The parties agree that the first prong is satisfied, and also that, as to the second prong, Mr. Dize worked on vessels \u201cin navigation.\u201d Therefore, the only issue is whether Mr. Dize\u2019s position had a connection to those vessels that was substantial in both duration and nature.</p>\n<p id=\"Agl\">\n<em>Application by the Circuit Court and Court of Special Appeals</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b194-6\">The Circuit Court concluded that, on the undisputed facts, Mr. Dize did not have a connection with a fleet of vessels in navigation that was substantial in duration. The court calcu<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"165\">*165</page-number>lated that the time Mr. Dize spent on water operating launches, which comprised less than 20 percent of his work time, did not satisfy the 30 percent rule of thumb adopted in Chandris. For purposes of the Association\u2019s summary judgment motion, the Circuit Court assumed that the additional hours that Mr. Dize spent maintaining and servicing vessels, whether those vessels were moored at the dock or on shore for repairs, when added to the hours \u201con the water,\u201d would have put Mr. Dize over the 30 percent threshold. But the court believed \u201cthe number of these hours is not material\u201d and declined to count them. The Circuit Court explained its reasoning:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b195-4\">The purpose of the duration requirement is to ensure that the individual\u2019s service regularly exposes him to the perils of the sea. That purpose is best served by a test that measures time spent aboard a vessel, regardless of whether other work activities contribute to the operation of a vessel. Time spent in other tasks on land, even if those activities are activities traditionally performed by seamen or are activities that contribute to the navigational operation of the vessel, do not contribute to this purpose. Therefore, the duration requirement must be measured in terms of time actually spent aboard vessels in navigation.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b195-5\">In answer to Mr. Dize\u2019s argument that the court should deviate from the 30 percent rule of thumb, as <em>Chandris </em>indicated could be appropriate in some circumstances, the Circuit Court noted that Mr. Dize had not provided a specific reason for such a departure.</p>\n<p id=\"b195-6\">On appeal, the Court of Special Appeals agreed that the focus should be on \u201cactivities [Mr. Dize] performed on board a vessel that actively subjected [him] to the perils of the sea.\u201d 205 Md.App. at 193, 44 A.3d 1033. It held that maintenance projects that Mr. Dize undertook on docked vessels and his various land-based duties should not be counted toward the 30 percent threshold. <em>Id. </em>at 191, 44 A.3d 1033.</p>\n<p id=\"b195-7\">In our review of this case, we are charged with construing the Jones Act \u201cuniformly\u201d with the other federal and state <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"166\">*166</page-number>courts that decide these cases. <em>Garrett v. Moore-McCormack Co., </em>317 U.S. 239, 244, 63 S.Ct. 246, 87 L.Ed. 239 (1942). When one attempts to apply the case law from the various federal circuits and state courts under the Jones Act, one encounters a bewildering array of decisions in which there is a citation to support any outcome and no outcome that fits comfortably with every precedent. In such circumstances, we must, like the Circuit Court, focus on the purpose of the statute and the guidance of the Supreme Court in its most recent interpretations of the Jones Act.</p>\n<p id=\"b196-5\">\n<em>The 30 Percent Test and Going to Sea</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"Ayy\">As noted above, the Supreme Court in <em>Chandris </em>used two different phrasings to refer to the 30 percent rule of thumb\u2014 in one instance, stating that an employee must spend at least 30 percent of the employee\u2019s time \u201caboard ship\u201d to be a seaman; in the other, declaring that an employee who spent less than 30 percent of work time \u201cin the service of a vessel in navigation\u201d would fail the test. <em>Chandris, </em>515 U.S. at 367, 371, 115 S.Ct. 2172. The Court thus apparently equated \u201cin the service of a vessel in navigation\u201d with \u201caboard ship.\u201d Accordingly, many courts have concluded that, for purposes of the duration requirement, an employee must spend at least 30 percent of the employee\u2019s time aboard or on a vessel to be a seaman.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b197-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"167\">*167</page-number>The parties have debated whether time \u201caboard ship\u201d also must be \u201cat sea\u201d in order to count for purposes of the 30 percent guideline. The cases that originated the guideline did not require that time aboard ship be at sea<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> and a number of courts have held, explicitly or implicitly, that a worker may be \u201caboard\u201d a vessel when it is moored or dockside (or perhaps even on the shore for repairs).<footnotemark>16</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b197-4\">But this broader understanding of what it means to be \u201caboard ship\u201d would seem to qualify many land-based workers for seaman status. <em>Harbor Tug </em>offers useful clarification: To give \u201csubstance to the inquiry\u201d as to the nature and duration of the employee\u2019s connection to the vessel and be \u201chelpful in distinguishing land-based from sea-based employees,\u201d a court must \u201cconcentrate on whether the employee\u2019s duties take him to sea.\u201d <em>Harbor Tug, </em>520 U.S. at 555, 117 S.Ct. 1535.</p>\n<p id=\"b197-5\">One might incorporate Harbor\u25a0 Tug\u2019s emphasis on sea-going duties into the durational connection test by requiring, as the Circuit Court held, that the employee must spend at least 30 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"168\">*168</page-number>percent of the employee\u2019s time actually at sea. This understanding also appears in two recent federal court decisions. <em>Clark v. Am. Marine &amp; Salvage, </em>494 Fed.Appx. 32, 35 (11th Cir.2012) (counting only hours spent on work that was of \u201ca seafaring nature\u201d toward the 30 percent threshold); <em>Casser v. McAllister Towing &amp; Transp. Co., </em>2010 WL 5065424 at *3 (S.D.N.Y.2010) (counting only \u201csea time\u201d in which employee was on vessels that were \u201cactually underway\u201d). This is a straightforward rule that is easy to apply and thus has great appeal. But it is somewhat at odds with the discussion of the \u201cin navigation\u201d requirement in <em>Chandris </em>and other courts\u2019 analysis of the \u201csubstantial nature\u201d determination under <em>Harbor Tug.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b198-4\"><em>\u201cIn Navigation, </em>\u201d <em>\u201cSeagoing Nature, </em>\u201d <em>and the Totality of the Circumstances</em></p>\n<p id=\"b198-5\">Under <em>Chandris, </em>a vessel need not be in transit on the water in order to be considered \u201cin navigation.\u201d In that case, the Court remanded the case for a jury determination whether the ship in question was \u201cin navigation\u201d during a six-month stay in dry dock. In light of that holding, courts have held that a vessel may remain \u201cin navigation\u201d even if it has been removed from the water.<footnotemark>17</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b198-6\">With respect to the statement in <em>Harbor Tug </em>that the employee\u2019s duties must be of a \u201cseagoing nature, subjecting him to the perils of the sea,\u201d the lower courts have reached a variety of interpretations. As noted above, some courts have read this in conjunction with <em>Chandris </em>to require that the worker spend at least 30 percent of the worker\u2019s time at sea. But other courts have understood this to be a requirement <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"169\">*169</page-number>only that the employee\u2019s duties take the employee to sea, not necessarily that the seagoing activities exceed 30 percent of work time.<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> Under that view, a worker who \u201cnever went to sea\u201d could not be a Jones Act seaman.<footnotemark>19</footnotemark> Other courts, however, have concluded that <em>Harbor Tug </em>did <em>not </em>create a requirement that an employee\u2019s duties \u201cliterally carry him to sea\u201d in order to achieve seaman status.<footnotemark>20</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b199-5\">Some courts have scrapped specific analysis of the elements of the substantial connection test in favor of a \u201ctotality of the circumstances\u201d review derived from the following passage in <em>Chandris:</em></p>\n<blockquote id=\"b199-6\">[T]he total circumstances of an individual\u2019s employment must be weighed to determine whether he had a sufficient relation to the navigation of vessels and the perils attendant thereon. The duration of a worker\u2019s connection to a vessel <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"170\">*170</page-number>and the nature of the worker\u2019s activities, taken together, determine whether a maritime employee is a seaman because the ultimate inquiry is whether the worker in question is a member of the vessel\u2019s crew or simply a land-based employee who happens to be working on the vessel at a given time.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b200-5\"><em>Chandris, </em>515 U.S. at 370, 115 S.Ct. 2172 (internal citation omitted). These cases rely less on numerical computations and more on a weighing of the employee\u2019s duties to determine whether they are primarily sea-based or land-based.<footnotemark>21</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b200-6\">\n<em>Sea-Based Duties</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b200-7\">Because the Supreme Court in <em>Chandris </em>stressed that land-based maritime workers are not seamen, courts in the Second and Ninth Circuits, in ruling on summary judgment motions concerning seaman status, have focused on whether the employee\u2019s duties are \u201csea-based activities.\u201d<footnotemark>22</footnotemark> For example, in <em>Vasquez v. McAllister Towing &amp; Transp. Co., </em>2013 WL 2181186 at *1 (S.D.N.Y.2013), the court considered whether a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"171\">*171</page-number>boatyard worker \u2014 with repair and maintenance duties very similar to those of Mr. Dize \u2014 was a Jones Act seaman. Although the court acknowledged that there was authority for the proposition that the substantial connection test does not require that an employee\u2019s duties literally take the employee to sea, the court found that the plaintiff nonetheless failed \u201cto demonstrate that his employment \u2018regularly exposefd]\u2019 him to seagoing perils\u201d and granted summary judgment in favor of the defendant. <em>Vasquez, </em>2013 WL 2181186 at *5 (citing <em>Chandris, </em>515 U.S. at 368, 115 S.Ct. 2172).</p>\n<p id=\"b201-5\">From this perspective, \u201csea-based\u201d duties that count for the purposes of the duration analysis are those that regularly expose the worker to seagoing perils. This is not to say that only time aboard a ship in transit over the water counts. There may be a variety of other circumstances that involve sea-based duties that expose a worker to the \u201cperils of the sea.\u201d <em>E.g., Navarre v. Kostmayer Construction Co., </em>52 So.3d 921, 930 (La.App.2010) (employee who worked on off-shore barge entitled to trial on Jones Act claim); <em>In re Endeavor Marine, </em>234 F.3d 287, 292 (5th Cir.2000) (worker who spent 18 months on derrick barge regularly \u201cexposed to the perils of the sea\u201d entitled to trial on Jones Act claim); <em>Delange v. Dutra Construction Co., </em>183 F.3d 916, 920-21 (9th Cir.1999) (carpenter who spent more than 80 percent of his time on board barge performing variety of seaman\u2019s duties in addition to carpentry raised triable issue as to his status under Jones Act); <em>Roberts v. Cardinal Services, Inc., </em>266 F.3d 368, 376 (5th Cir.2001) (although affirming summary judgment in favor of employer, court counted plaintiffs duties on liftboats toward 30 percent threshold). We need not catalog all of the possibilities for purposes of this case. But we can say that this approach, though not as bright a line as that drawn by the Circuit Court, serves the purpose of the statute with the degree of flexibility that the Supreme Court\u2019s decisions permit. We shall apply it in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b201-6\">\n<em>Application to Mr. Dize</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b201-7\">As the trial court did, we shall assume, without deciding, that Mr. Dize\u2019s piloting of the launch boats, which consti<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"172\">*172</page-number>tuted less than 20 percent of his work time, was a \u201csea-based\u201d activity that sufficiently exposed him to the perils of the sea. The question therefore becomes whether his dockside or onshore maintenance of the boats \u2014 which he estimated as taking up to 50 percent of his time \u2014 was \u201csea-based\u201d work.</p>\n<p id=\"b202-4\">The case law on seaman status reveals a widely shared conclusion that \u201c[performing repairs and conducting inspections on vessels that are dockside hardly exposes the plaintiff to \u2018the perils of the sea.\u2019 \u201d <em>Casser, </em>2010 WL 5065424 at *3. <em>Harbor Tug </em>itself held that the employee\u2019s maintenance work and painting aboard a docked tugboat were not \u201csubstantial for seaman-status purposes.\u201d <em>Harbor Tug, </em>520 U.S. at 559, 117 S.Ct. 1535. Subsequent cases have expounded upon this reasoning. For example, in <em>Vasquez, </em>the court noted:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b202-5\">While working on vessels tied to the dock, plaintiff was not subjected to storms, high seas, or other caprices of open water.... [OJnshore assistance was never far away. Accordingly, a reasonable jury simply could not conclude that plaintiffs employment exposed him to the \u201cspecial hazards and disadvantages\u201d of seamanship.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b202-6\">2013 WL 2181186 at *5.</p>\n<p id=\"b202-7\">In <em>Lara v. Arctic King, Ltd., </em>178 F.Supp.2d 1178 (W.D.Wash.2001) \u2014 another case involving a shipyard employee whose duties were similar to Mr. Dize\u2019s \u2014 the court also held that maintenance work on moored vessels did not subject the individual to the \u201cspecial hazards and disadvantages\u201d of sea duty:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b202-8\">The fact the vessel remained tied to a pier obviously eliminated many of the peculiar risks that seamen face, such as the need to fight fires without outside assistance, the need to abandon ship, and the need to survive exposure to the elements until help arrives.... Another seaman hazard or disadvantage that plaintiff did not face was potential delay or inconvenience in being transported to medical attention for injuries____ [Plaintiff could] depart his work place at any time. He therefore did not have any of the inconveniences, limitations and pressures encountered by seamen <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"173\">*173</page-number>who are often stuck with their vessel and the control of its Master and operator for extended periods until the next port call.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b203-4\"><em>Id. </em>at 1182.<footnotemark>23</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b203-5\">Mr. Dize\u2019s time spent maintaining the Association\u2019s vessels while they were docked or onshore at the Solomons Island Transfer Station (as well as his time spent performing upkeep of the station property) does not count toward the 30 percent threshold for the same reasons. As in the cases cited above, these duties \u2014 performing overhauls and refits of vessels; painting; sanding; changing propellers, rotors, shafts, and rub rails; replacing zinc anodes; cleaning the boat interiors; and fueling \u2014 did not subject him to the \u201ccaprices of open water,\u201d and, in the case of an emergency, \u201conshore assistance was never far away.\u201d During his commission of this work, there would never be a \u201cneed to abandon ship\u201d or \u201csurvive exposure to the elements until help arrives.\u201d His proximity to shore meant that there was no danger of unusual \u201cdelay or inconvenience in being transported to medical attention for injuries.\u201d This work plainly did not subject Mr. Dize to the perils of the sea, and therefore did not comprise sea-based activities that should have been counted in the Circuit Court\u2019s duration analysis.</p>\n<p id=\"b203-6\">Conclusion</p>\n<p id=\"b203-7\">As the Supreme Court has observed, the Jones Act provides a special remedy to maritime employees who face the \u201cperils of the sea.\u201d Accordingly, in order to satisfy the substantial connection test articulated in <em>Chandris, </em>an employee must <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"174\">*174</page-number>perform sea-based duties that give rise to those unique dangers. Because Mr. Dize did not spend at least 30 percent of his work time performing such duties, he did not have a connection to a vessel that was substantial in both duration and nature. He therefore was not a seaman for the purposes of the Jones Act.<footnotemark>24</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b204-5\">Judgment of the Court of Special Appeals Affirmed.

Contrary to the Association's assertions, the Fifth Circuit cases giving rise to the 30-percent rule do not establish that one must be <em>voyaging at sea </em>to be \"aboard\u201d a vessel. In <em>Barrett v. Chevron, U.S.A., Inc., </em>781 F.2d 1067, 1074 (5th Cir.1986), and <em>Lormand v. Superior Oil Co., </em>845 F.2d 536, 540-41 (5th Cir.1987), the employees seeking seaman status spent up to 80 percent of their time on offshore platforms and \"jack-up\u201d vessels supported by legs that extended to the seabed\u2014 not vessels that actually floated upon the water. In <em>Palmer v. Fayard Moving &amp; Transp. Corp., </em>930 F.2d 437 (5th Cir.1991), the plaintiff spent more than 80 percent of her time wholly on land; furthermore, that case describes the rule of <em>Barrett </em>and <em>Lormand </em>as merely requiring work \"on vessels.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 439.
