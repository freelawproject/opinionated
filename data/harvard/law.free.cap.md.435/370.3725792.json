Burris, according to the State\u2019s theory of the case, was a \u201chit man\u201d for the Black Guerilla Family gang (\u201cBGF\u201d) and was ordered by his gang boss, \u201cBam,\u201d<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> to Mil Hubert Dickerson, Jr., because Mr. Dickerson owed Bam money.</p>\n<p id=\"b404-6\">The State moved, prior to trial,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> to introduce the testimony of Sergeant Dennis WorMey of the Baltimore City Police Department, proffered as a gang expert, who would identify Burris as a member of BGF, and testify that BGF was a \u201cviolent\u201d gang that would commit murder on the basis of a debt owed to one of its members: \u201cThis is what [BGF] do[es]. You owe them money. They\u2019re going to go out and Mil you----\u201d According to the State, Sergeant WorMey\u2019s testimony was necessary to establish Burris\u2019s membership in BGF and, in turn, Burris\u2019s motive: that he killed Mr. Dickerson \u201cbecause that\u2019s what he was ordered to do\u201d by Bam, his BGF gang boss.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> The State further proffered that Sergeant Workley\u2019s testimony was necessary were witnesses to recant pretrial statements implicating Burris at trial, because the State intended to have Sergeant Workley testify as to \u201cwhat BGF is, what they do. They extort.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b405-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"375\">*375</page-number>Burris\u2019s counsel, in response, argued that Sergeant Workley should not be permitted to testify, because \u201cevery single witness in this case has known [Burris] for years. So, this isn\u2019t a question about identity[,]\u201d and that gang evidence was not relevant to motive:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b405-5\">The motive ... is that supposedly they\u2019re alleging that Mr. Burris shot Mr. Dickerson because Mr. Dickerson owed Bam money. Not that it had anything to do with the fact that either of these gentlemen may or may not have been in the organization.... All the State wants to do is taint the water in this case and taint [Burris] and say, okay, he\u2019s a gang member.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b405-6\">The court, thereafter, ruled the evidence admissible to prove motive based upon its understanding of the State\u2019s proffer:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AF4\">All right. Based upon my understanding at this time and in what was presented to me before, I am prepared to allow this information to come in. I believe that it is relevant in that the theory of the State\u2019s case as all parties seem to consider that the murder was as a result of a debt that was owed, but why the Defendant is the person who did the shooting because a debt was owed to Bam involves the question of their relationship. That their relationship that the State is prepared to prove involves the Black G[ue]rilla[<footnotemark>5</footnotemark>] Family \u2014 I believe makes that relevant evidence.[<footnotemark>6</footnotemark>]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b405-7\">The State, at trial, called several crime scene witnesses and the medical examiner, in addition to three fact witnesses who the State indicated, prior to trial, would likely recant. One of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"376\">*376</page-number>these witnesses allegedly told investigators that Burris was a \u201chit man\u201d for Bam, that Bam told Burris to kill the victim, that he heard Burris bragging to Bam about shooting a man, and that Bam responded to Burris\u2019s bragging by stating \u201c[tjhat\u2019s my boy, straight G[ue]rilla\u201d; another allegedly had told investigators that she overheard Burris state that he had shot a person subsequent to Mr. Dickerson\u2019s murder because \u201che owed Bam some money\u201d; and the third allegedly had stated to detectives he had witnessed Burris shoot the victim and that Burris did so over a debt.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> Two of these witnesses allegedly identified Burris and Bam as members of BGF. At trial, all three witnesses \u2014 Austin Lockwood, Ashley Sparrow, and Dominic Falcon \u2014 testified that they either did not remember or fabricated their pre-trial statements to investigators implicating Burris and, accordingly, recordings of their pretrial statements were played for the jury pursuant to Rule 5-802.1(a).<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b406-5\">The State then called Sergeant Workley and, prior to his taking the stand, a bench conference ensued during which the State identified various photographs of Burris\u2019s tattoos that it intended to present to Sergeant Workley for the purpose of having the Sergeant explain their relationship to Burris\u2019s membership in BGF. Burris\u2019s counsel objected to Sergeant Workley testifying as to Burris\u2019s tattoos, \u201cbecause the[ ] tattoos [were] not relevant to th[e] case in any, in any way <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"377\">*377</page-number>whatsoever.\u201d The court ruled, however, that Sergeant Workley would be permitted to testify as to the substance of Burris\u2019s tattoos insofar as they were related to his opinion that Burris was a member of BGF:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b407-5\">As these [tattoos] have an appearance of prejudice because there are some nasty things said, but just as if he had decided as he may someday to have tattooed I killed Hubert Dickerson, that if he chose to have it written on him may come back to be evidence against him at some point. What I\u2019m going to do is allow the State after establishing the S[e]rge[a]nt\u2019s expertise to go through pictures [of Burris\u2019s tattoos] one at a time and ask if there is anything in the picture that you see that is of significance in your determination on this question of your expert opinion. If they are, then I\u2019ll allow him to say what it is. If, in any of these pictures he says, I don\u2019t know what it is, it doesn\u2019t mean anything, we can take that picture out and it\u2019s, it\u2019s useless, but we have to understand that I am expecting the Detective S[e]rge[a]nt to say that within the world of gang orientation, marks are left in places, on walls, on buildings, on cars, on people so that other members of their own gang and others gangs understand what they\u2019re saying. If the Detective S[e]rge[a]nt can interpret that for us, then he can interpret it.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b407-6\">Sergeant Workley was then qualified as an expert \u201cin the field of gangs, gang membership, gang insignia, gang ranking, [and] gang identification.\u201d Burris\u2019s counsel interposed numerous objections during Sergeant Workley\u2019s testimony,<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> which began by explaining gang practices in general:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b408-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"378\">*378</page-number>[STATE\u2019S ATTORNEY]: [0]nce in a gang, can members quit whenever they want to?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b408-5\">[SERGEANT WORKLEY]: Usually not.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b408-6\">[STATE\u2019S ATTORNEY]: And what is a phrase like blood in, blood out mean?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b408-7\">[SERGEANT WORKLEY]: They\u2019re a blood member for life.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b408-8\">[STATE\u2019S ATTORNEY]: And does the concept of respect, the word respect have a special significance in the world of gang, criminal street gangs?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b408-9\">[SERGEANT WORKLEY]: Absolutely one hundred percent. That\u2019s their code, their code, their creed they live by. They have to be respected.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b408-10\">[STATE\u2019S ATTORNEY]: And how does a gang member gain respect in their membership ... ? ... Generally speaking.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b408-11\">[SERGEANT WORKLEY]: Generally speaking, by committing crimes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b408-12\">[STATE\u2019S ATTORNEY]: Does turf or territory have special significance in the gang culture?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b408-13\">[SERGEANT WORKLEY]: Sure.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b408-14\">[STATE\u2019S ATTORNEY]: And what about the term payback? ....</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b408-15\">[SERGEANT WORKLEY]: Just like any other criminal enterprise, if you do something against, you know, even going as far back as prohibition, when you did something against somebody else it was always pay back for whatever you did and whatever happens. There\u2019s always conse<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"379\">*379</page-number>quences to your actions and actions always have consequences.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b409-5\">Sergeant Workley further testified about the history, hierarchy, organization, and practices of BGF:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b409-6\">[STATE\u2019S ATTORNEY]: Can you tell me ... briefly what the Black G[ue]rilla family is?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b409-7\">[SERGEANT WORKLEY]: BGF started out, they still are a prison gang. They\u2019re a prominent prison gang in the State of Maryland. They control most of the jails in the State of Maryland. They control what goes on inside and they get information that happens on the outside and generally inside speaking, they control the narcotic trade inside, inside the jails and the inflow of information going back and forth.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b409-8\">[STATE\u2019S ATTORNEY]: Well, let\u2019s break it down. Does BGF have a constitution?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b409-9\">[SERGEANT WORKLEY]: Yes, they do.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b409-10\">[STATE\u2019S ATTORNEY]: Or a creed. Can you explain what that means?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b409-11\">[SERGEANT WORKLEY]: We learned BGF inside the prison walls, they have a leader and that leader came up with the concept, core ideas. It\u2019s just like any other business. Any other gang, there\u2019s a leader. He came up with concepts. There\u2019s a rank structure. There\u2019s rules to be followed. If you don\u2019t follow those rules, there\u2019s consequences and actually what they did inside the prison walls is that they came up with a way and they found an author and they authored a book, a manual for them to follow that creed by.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b409-12\">[STATE\u2019S ATTORNEY]: And based on your experience and training, is the Black G[ue]rilla Family run like a business?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b409-13\">[SERGEANT WORKLEY]: Absolutely.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b410-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"380\">*380</page-number>[STATE\u2019S ATTORNEY]: And just, does Black G[ue]rilla Family use like it\u2019s own language?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b410-5\">[SERGEANT WORKLEY]: Absolutely. When most members are inducted into BGF, they are taught that, basically almost like a Bible. Like we, you know we teach our regular, you know, for the ladies and gentlemen of the jury, like your kids, you\u2019re teaching them Bible study. They have, you know what they go by and actually they speak Swahili and the reason they speak Swahili is so the prison officials can\u2019t understand what they\u2019re saying and sometimes most of them, they learned how to write in that so that can\u2019t be \u2014 it\u2019s harder, it\u2019s harder to break their codes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b410-6\">[STATE\u2019S ATTORNEY]: And would you say that \u2014 does Black G[ue]rilla Family actually even have things like their own laws and guidelines?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b410-7\">[SERGEANT WORKLEY]: Absolutely. They have a constitution within that book that they published. You know, if you do this, this is what the actual consequences are. This is what you\u2019re allowed to do. This is what we don\u2019t allow you to do.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b410-8\">[STATE\u2019S ATTORNEY]: ... Does Black G[ue]rilla Family, do they rank their members?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b410-9\">[SERGEANT WORKLEY]: Sure, absolutely.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b410-10\">[STATE\u2019S ATTORNEY]: Do people have their place in that organization?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b410-11\">[SERGEANT WORKLEY]: Yes, they do.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b410-12\">[STATE\u2019S ATTORNEY]: What is a, what would the, what would the term hit man be in Black G[ue]rilla Family? What would that person be?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b410-13\">[SERGEANT WORKLEY]: Just like you said. That person goes out and they carry out the orders of violence either by assault and murder.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b410-14\">Sergeant Workley then testified as to his ultimate conclusion that Burris was a member of BGF:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b411-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"381\">*381</page-number>[STATE\u2019S ATTORNEY]: Now S[e]rge[a]nt Workley, in the course of your work, do you review law enforcement records about individual gang memberships?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b411-5\">[SERGEANT WORKLEY]: Yes, I do.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b411-6\">[STATE\u2019S ATTORNEY]: And has the Department of Corrections listed the Defendant Tyrone Burris as a member of the Black G[ue]rilla Family?[<footnotemark>10</footnotemark>]</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b411-7\">[SERGEANT WORKLEY]: Yes, they have.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b411-8\">[STATE\u2019S ATTORNEY]: Now based on information that you were able to review and your expertise in gangs, can you make a conclusion as to whether the Defendant is a member of the Black G[ue]rilla Family?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b411-9\">[SERGEANT WORKLEY]: Mr. Burris is a member of the Black G[ue]rilla Family.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b411-10\">Sergeant Workley, thereafter, testified regarding tattoos on Burris\u2019s face and upper body as seen in photographs proffered for identification by the prosecutor.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> As to tattoos on Burris\u2019s forearms that read \u201cBaltimore\u201d and \u201cFranklin,\u201d Sergeant Workley opined, \u201c[s]everal gang members, they tattoo themselves with the area that they\u2019re in, that they, you know, do their business in.\u201d Sergeant Workley also testified that Burris\u2019s tattoo on his left forearm \u201c187\u201d was \u201ca penal code in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"382\">*382</page-number>California for homicide\u201d that was \u201c[absolutely\u201d seen on gang members. As to Burris\u2019s \u201cMOB\u201d tattoo on his left forearm, Sergeant Workley testified:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b412-4\">Knowing that he\u2019s a member of the Black G[ue]rilla Family, two things. MOB in Baltimore means member of blood or money over bitches. Since he\u2019s a member of BGF, it\u2019s probably money over bitches....</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b412-5\">A tattoo on Burris\u2019s chest of \u201cSixx 9,\u201d according to Sergeant Workley, would be his \u201cstreet name.\u201d A tattoo on Burris\u2019s left biceps depicting a weapon being fired with the words \u201cDeath B4 Dishonor\u201d was also, according to Sergeant Workley, common \u201con guys that are inside the walls. They get tattoos and come out basically depicting and saying, you know, they\u2019ll die before they dishonor themselves.\u201d Sergeant Workley identified an \u201cOG\u201d tattoo on Burris\u2019s left forearm as meaning \u201coriginal gangster\u201d and, finally, opined that Burris\u2019s tattoo on that same forearm which read \u201creal nigga don\u2019t die,\u201d was similar to others he had seen on gang members.</p>\n<p id=\"b412-6\">After Sergeant Workley\u2019s testimony Burris\u2019s counsel restated for clarification the basis for his numerous objections interposed during that testimony:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b412-7\">You\u2019ve got a murder case here and to the best of what I\u2019ve heard in this case and I could be wrong, but to the best of what I\u2019ve heard in the case, nobody ever said that this was a gang ordered hit. So, that\u2019s why I have to object to all this stuff about the gang and the prejudice is outweighing the probative value.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b412-8\">Then you have these tattoos that have guns. These tattoos have death before dishonor and all this other stuff and this is a murder case and none of this stuff has anything to do with the identification of the Defendant involved in this particular murder. It isn\u2019t like anybody said, I saw this tattoo.... So, we\u2019ve got a murder case and I just think that the prejudice clearly outweighs the probative value. It poisons the well for the jury. So, that\u2019s why I have to object to all of these and [Sergeant Workley\u2019s] testimony.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b413-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"383\">*383</page-number>The court disagreed and ruled Sergeant Workley\u2019s testimony was admissible to show why witnesses recanted and to establish that Burris was a member of BGF:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b413-5\">Because we have witnesses who have changed their testimony from the time that they met with the police shortly after this event, to taking four[<footnotemark>12</footnotemark>] different tacts of denying their statements....</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b413-6\">Each of them in their statements indicate some level of fear of the Defendant, some specifically stating because of his gang involvement or Barn\u2019s gang involvement. That\u2019s how it got to be relevant in the case. It was in the statements. I wasn\u2019t going to clear it out of the statements.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b413-7\">Now, the question is whether or not the State should be allowed to prove that the Defendant is in fact a member of a gang. I think because of the way in which the information came from the reluctant witnesses, it is unavoidable. Had the witnesses not been and I am satisfied afraid to testify, we could have kept this all out, but because they changed their testimony because I am satisfied that they were afraid to testify truthfully, then everything they said virtually has to come in to explain why they\u2019ve changed their testimony....</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b413-8\">Now, [Sergeant Workley] who is before us now and the evidence that we\u2019re considering is only for the purpose of establishing whether or not the Defendant is a member of the gang. I remind you and the record that in anticipation of this, we asked the general voir dire question about whether information or references about gang activity would interfere with the juror\u2019s ability to render a fair and impartial verdict. That said, ... I am anticipating from [both Burns\u2019s counsel and the prosecutor] some form of specific instruction for me to give them about how they should be processing this information and I\u2019ll consider what <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"384\">*384</page-number>either one of you suggests about that instruction, but that\u2019s later on. So, I believe your position and the basis for my ruling are ... on the record as they can be.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b414-4\">Burris was convicted of first degree murder and use of a handgun in the commission of a crime of violence. The Court of Special Appeals, in a reported opinion, affirmed Burris\u2019s convictions determining, <em>inter alia, </em>that the Circuit Court did not err in permitting Sergeant Workley to testify. <em>Burris v. State, </em>206 Md.App. 89, 47 A.3d 635 (2012). We granted certiorari, <em>Burris v. State, 429 </em>Md. 81, 54 A.3d 759 (2012), to consider the following questions:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b414-5\">1. Whether it was error for the trial court to admit extensive gang-related evidence, including expert testimony, that Mr. Burris was a member of the Black Guerrilla Family gang?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b414-6\">Whether the Court of Special Appeals erred in holding that expert testimony on gangs was admissible to explain why several witnesses recanted prior to trial?</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b414-7\">We shall hold that the trial court abused its discretion in allowing Sergeant Workley to testify as he did, because the probative value of his testimony was substantially outweighed by unfair prejudice, and because this error was not harmless, we shall reverse and remand for a new trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b414-8\">The State sought to introduce Sergeant Workley\u2019s testimony under Rule 5-404(b), positing that Burris\u2019s BGF gang membership was a bad act that was probative of his motive to kill Mr. Dickerson. Rule 5-404, governing admission of prior bad acts, provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b414-9\">Character evidence not admissible to prove conduct; exceptions; other crimes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b414-10\">(a) Character evidence.

Evidence of other crimes, wrongs, or acts including delinquent acts as defined by Code, Courts Article, \u00a7 3-8A-01 is not admissible to prove the character of a person in order to show action in conformity therewith. Such evidence, however, may be admissible for other purposes, such as proof of motive, opportunity, intent, preparation, common scheme or plan, knowledge, identity, or absence of mistake or accident.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AzF\">Rule 5-404(b) is a rule of exclusion, <em>State v.

Rule 5-403 provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b416-6\">Although relevant, evidence may be excluded if its probative value is substantially outweighed by the danger of unfair prejudice, confusion of the issues, or misleading the jury, or by considerations of undue delay, waste of time, or needless presentation of cumulative evidence.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b416-7\">In <em>Gutierrez v. State, </em>423 Md. 476, 32 A.3d 2 (2011), we recently were called upon for the first time to determine \u201cwhether expert testimony about the history, hierarchy, and common practices of a street gang is admissible as proof of motive or is prohibited by Maryland Rule 5-404(b) as evidence of other crimes, wrongs or acts.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 481, 32 A.3d at 5. We held that \u201csuch testimony is permissible where fact evidence establishes that the crime charged was gang-related and the probative value of the testimony is not substantially outweighed by any unfair prejudice to the defendant.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 481-82, 32 A.3d at 5.</p>\n<p id=\"b416-8\">In the case, a car carrying Gutierrez and three other men approached a house where a group of people was congregating and Gutierrez \u201caddressed the group, shouting \u2018Mara Salvatru<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"387\">*387</page-number>cha[,]\u2019 [which] witnesses interpreted ... to mean that [Gutierrez] was a member of the MS-13 street gang.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 482, 32 A.3d at 5. Gutierrez then demanded to know the gang affiliation of the assembled group, to which one member responded by insulting MS-13. Gutierrez retaliated by firing multiple gunshots into the group, killing the victim.</p>\n<p id=\"b417-5\">At Gutierrez\u2019s trial, several witnesses testified about what Gutierrez shouted and also that the victim\u2019s murder was \u201cmotivated by Gutierrez\u2019s ties to MS-13,\u201d and was part of Gutierrez\u2019s initiation into the gang, because \u201c \u2018[y]ou have to kill someone to get into MS[-13.]\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>at 497, 32 A.3d at 14. The prosecution also called Sergeant George Norris \u201cas an expert witness \u2018in the area of MS-13 and gangs in general[,]\u2019 \u201d to establish Gutierrez\u2019s gang-related motive for the shooting. <em>Id. </em>at 484, 32 A.3d at 6. We summarized Sergeant Norris\u2019s testimony as:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b417-6\">[Sergeant] Norris provided jurors with an overview of the MS-13 culture. He began by explaining that \u201cMS-13\u201d stands for \u201cMara Salvatrucha,\u201d with \u201cmara\u201d meaning gang or group, \u201csalva\u201d referring to El Salvador, and \u201ctrucha\u201d translating as \u201cwatch out\u201d or \u201clook out.\u201d The 13 in the gang\u2019s name, he testified, is \u201cindicative of their alliance with the Mexican Mafia[.]\u201d [Sergeant] Norris also described how prospective members are inducted, or \u201cjumped,\u201d into MS-13, which involves a 13 second beating by four or five gang members. He identified Langley Park, the location of the apartment where Gutierrez, [and other occupants of the car] were congregated before driving to Riverdale, as an MS-13 stronghold. Riverdale (the scene of the crime), on the other hand, was a predominantly Mexican neighborhood and \u201c[t]he gangs within that community are more of the Mexican-based gangs as opposed to MS-13, which is predominantly Central American based.\u201d Thus, Riverdale is \u201can area where rival gang members are expected to be.\u201d [Sergeant] Norris explained that MS-13 members respond to criticism of their gang or untruthful displays of MS-13 membership (an act known as \u201cfalse flagging\u201d) with violence \u201cup to death.\u201d In fact, MS-13 is \u201cthe gang that [law <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"388\">*388</page-number>enforcement] had seen the most violence with recently for the past four, four and a half years in this region----\u201d Finally, [Sergeant] Norris, who often conducted internet investigations by visiting gang members\u2019 MySpace webpages, articulated a belief that Gutierrez was affiliated with MS-13 based on pictures of the defendant taken from MySpace.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b418-7\"><em>Id. </em>at 484, 32 A.3d at 6-7.</p>\n<p id=\"b418-8\">Gutierrez argued that he was entitled to a new trial, because \u201cthe trial court abused its discretion by admitting [Sergeant] Norris\u2019s irrelevant and unfairly prejudicial testimony on gang activity.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 486, 32 A.3d at 8. We disagreed and initially determined that the \u201cthreshold requirement\u201d for admission of gang expert testimony was the fact evidence demonstrating the crime was gang related:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b418-9\">We agree with the Supreme Court of New Mexico that courts must be vigilant in guarding against the improper use of gang affiliation evidence \u201cas a backdoor means of introducing character evidence by associating the defendant with a gang and describing the gang\u2019s bad acts.\u201d <em>[State v. Torrez, </em>146 N.M. 331, 210 P.3d 228, 235 (2009) ]. Thus, we hold that the threshold requirement for the admissibility of gang expert testimony is <em>fact </em>evidence showing that the crime was gang-related. <em>Accord Torrez, </em>210 P.3d at 235-36. Proof of such a link transforms a defendant\u2019s gang membership, current or prospective, from an impermissible prior bad act to a concrete component of the crime for which the defendant is on trial. To be clear, this requirement may be satisfied by fact evidence that, at first glance, may not indicate gang motivations, but when coupled with expert testimony, provides the gang-crime connection.... In adopting this threshold requirement, we are simply saying that a defendant\u2019s membership in a gang, in and of itself, is not enough.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b418-10\"><em>Gutierrez, </em>423 Md. at 495-96, 32 A.3d at 13-14 (emphasis in original) (footnotes omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b419-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"389\">*389</page-number>Evidence sufficient to meet this \u201cthreshold requirement\u201d for presentation of gang expert testimony was garnered in <em>Gutierrez, </em>when \u201cthree fact witnesses suggested that [the victim\u2019s] murder was motivated by Gutierrez\u2019s ties to MS-13.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 497, 32 A.3d at 14. We explained, however, that although this fact evidence \u201cwas enough to open the door for expert testimony, we must still determine whether the trial court abused its discretion in permitting [Sergeant] Norris to testify. Even if [Sergeant] Norris\u2019s evidence was otherwise admissible, it could still be excluded if its \u2018probative value is substantially outweighed by the danger of unfair prejudice ....\u2019\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 497-98, 32 A.3d at 14-15, quoting Rule 5-403.</p>\n<p id=\"b419-5\">With regard to four of the five statements uttered by Sergeant Norris that Gutierrez specifically challenged, we concluded \u201cthe trial court did not abuse its discretion when permitting the jury to hear and consider [them].\u201d<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> <em>Id. </em>at 499, 32 A.3d at 15-16.

Sergeant Norris\u2019s \u201cdescription of the process of \u2018jumping in\u2019 as a 13-second beating corroborates [a witness\u2019s] grand jury testimony that this seemingly senseless shooting was really Gutierrez\u2019s attempt to join MS-13.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Sergeant Norris\u2019s testimony explaining \u201cthat MS-13 members <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"390\">*390</page-number>respond to insults with punishment \u2018up to death\u2019 \u201d and that \u201cgang members also respond to [false proclamations of MS-13 affiliation] with violence up to death\u201d were probative of why \u201cGutierrez fired four shots after being insulted [when] [t]he average person would not react to a simple affront in such a brutal manner, and [Sergeant] Norris\u2019s opinion shed light on this otherwise \u2018inexplicable act.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id., </em>quoting <em>People v. Bryant, </em>241 Ill.App.3d 1007, 182 Ill.Dec. 376, 609 N.E.2d 910, 920 (1993). We came to a different conclusion, however, as to Sergeant Norris\u2019s \u201ccomment that MS-13 is the gang that law enforcement \u2018had seen the most violence with recently for the past four, four and a half years in this region[,]\u2019 \u201d which we deemed was error to admit, because \u201c[t]he fact that one gang is generally more violent than others [did] little to add to the jury\u2019s understanding of why the defendant was the person who committed the particular crime charged.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 499, 32 A.3d at 16.</p>\n<p id=\"b420-5\">We turn, then, to application of the two-part test in <em>Gutierrez </em>to this case by initially asking whether fact evidence was adduced sufficient to meet the threshold, requiring a nexus between the crime and current gang membership.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"391\">*391</page-number>The standard to determine such a link, suggested in Gutierrez, was sufficient fact evidence of such nexus to \u201ctransform[ ]\u201d Burris\u2019s membership in BGF \u201cfrom an impermissible prior bad act to a concrete component of the crime\u201d charged. 423 Md. at 496, 32 A.3d at 13.</p>\n<p id=\"b421-4\">Burris contends the \u201cthreshold requirement\u201d for admission of gang evidence was not satisfied in his case, because he was not charged with a gang-related crime, such as participation in a \u201ccriminal gang\u201d under Sections 9-804(a) or (b) of the Criminal Law Article, Maryland Code (2002, 2012 Repl.Vol.),<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> or conspiracy to commit a crime with another gang member. The State argues, however, that the \u201cthreshold requirement\u201d was met in this case, because the fact witnesses called by the State testified that the crime was gang-related.</p>\n<p id=\"b421-5\">The threshold for the admission of gang evidence does not require that the defendant be charged with a \u201cgang crime\u201d or conspiracy to commit a crime with a gang member. Although Gutierrez also was charged with conspiracy to commit murder and acquitted of that crime, his having been so charged did not influence our analysis of whether gang evidence was properly introduced in that case.</p>\n<p id=\"b421-6\">The theory of the State\u2019s case here was, and the trial judge understood, the relationship of gang membership to the crime to be that Burris was a \u201chit man\u201d in BGF, Burris was a \u201cboss\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"392\">*392</page-number>within BGF, and that Burris was executing Mr. Dickerson as a result of his role in BGF. Fact evidence adduced at trial in the alleged statements of fact witnesses that were introduced, established that both Burris and Bam were BGF members; Bam was a \u201cboss\u201d within the organization; Burris was a \u201chit man for real\u201d for Bam who was told by Bam to commit the killing; that Bam, apparently, responded to Burris\u2019s telling him that he \u201cjust killed a boy,\u201d by stating \u201c[tjhat\u2019s my boy, straight G[ue]rilla\u201d; and Burris was overheard stating that he committed a murder because the victim owed Bam money. Such evidence was sufficient to establish a nexus between BGF and the crime for which Burris was on trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b422-5\">Having determined the threshold for admissibility of gang evidence was met, however, does not end our inquiry, as we still must determine whether the evidence should have been excluded because \u201cits probative value is substantially outweighed by the danger of unfair prejudice\u201d or because it was \u201cneedless presentation of cumulative evidence.\u201d Rule 5-403. In the present case, the probative value of Sergeant Workley\u2019s testimony was substantially outweighed by the danger of unfair prejudice and in some instances cumulative of other evidence adduced at trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b422-6\">In balancing probative value against prejudice \u201cwe keep in mind that \u2018the fact that evidence prejudices one party or the other, in the sense that it hurts his or her case, is not the undesirable prejudice referred to in Rule 5-403.\u2019 \u201d <em>Odum v. State, </em>412 Md. 593, 615, 989 A.2d 232, 245 (2010), quoting Lynn McLain, Maryland Evidence: State and Federal, \u00a7 403:l(b) (2d ed.2001). Rather, evidence is considered unfairly prejudicial when \u201c \u2018it might influence the jury to disregard the evidence or lack of evidence regarding the particular crime with which [the defendant] is being charged.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>The more probative the evidence, therefore, \u201cthe less likely it is that the evidence will be unfairly prejudicial.\u201d <em>Id. </em>In starting from a point of exclusion of prior bad act evidence, a trial court must weigh both the <em>\u201cnecessity for </em>and probativeness of the evidence ... against the untoward prejudice which is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"393\">*393</page-number>likely to be the consequence of its admission.\u201d <em>Faulkner, </em>314 Md. at 640-41, 552 A.2d at 901 (emphasis in original), quoting <em>Cross v.

His testimony about BGF dealing narcotics in prison, controlling Maryland prisons, and concealing their illicit activities by speaking Swahili, in a case in which a prison environment was not implicated, clearly, was prejudicial.</p>\n<p id=\"b424-6\">Sergeant Workley\u2019s testimony about Burris\u2019s tattoos was graphic and inferential that Burris had a propensity to Mil and previously had been incarcerated, all of which were prejudi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"395\">*395</page-number>cial. He testified that Burris had \u201c187 and a picture of a weapon\u201d tattooed on his left forearm and that \u201c187 is a penal code in California for homicide.\u201d Sergeant Workley also testified that Burris had a tattoo of \u201cdeath before dishonor\u201d with a pistol being fired which, according to him, was common on \u201cguys that are inside the walls.\u201d Sergeant Workley further opined that Burris\u2019s tattoo \u201cMOB,\u201d likely meant \u201cmoney over bitches,\u201d and Burris had \u201creal nigga don\u2019t die\u201d and \u201coriginal gangster\u201d tattoos all of which was incendiary.</p>\n<p id=\"b425-5\">In response to the prejudicial aspect of Sergeant Workley\u2019s testimony, the State argues Sergeant Workley\u2019s testimony was \u201chighly probative,\u201d \u201cbecause [Burris\u2019s] membership in BGF was relevant to explaining both why [Burris] murdered the victim over a debt owed to Bam and why the State\u2019s witnesses would recant[.]\u201d The Court of Special Appeals agreed, concluding it was \u201chighly probative in identifying [Burris] as a member of the BGF, explaining the history and structure of the gang, and, thereby, explaining why [Burris] would commit a crime at Barn\u2019s \u2014 a gang boss\u2019s \u2014 direction.\u201d <em>Bums, </em>206 Md.App. at 131, 47 A.3d at 659.

As such, in addition [to recanting witnesses] specific mentions of [Burris\u2019s] gang affiliation and their fear, it is a reasonable inference that all of the witnesses\u2019 fear and subsequent recantations at trial resulted from [Burris\u2019s] gang affiliation coupled with either directly seeing [Burris] shoot the victim or hearing [Burris] admit to shooting the victim.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b425-7\"><em>Burris, </em>206 Md.App. at 128-29, 47 A.3d at 658.</p>\n<p id=\"b425-8\">With regard to identifying Burris as a member of BGF, Sergeant Workley\u2019s testimony was cumulative of other evi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"396\">*396</page-number>dence already adduced at trial that identified Burris as a member of BGF. Messrs.

Rather, Sergeant Workley opined regarding BGF members studying their gang\u2019s code or constitution as a child would study the Bible in \u201cBible study\u201d; that there is a BGF \u201crank structure\u201d and \u201crules to be followed\u201d and \u201c[i]f you don\u2019t follow those rules, there\u2019s consequences and actually what [BGF] did inside the prison walls is that they came up with ... a manual for them to follow that creed by\u201d; that BGF is run like a \u201cbusiness\u201d; and that members speak Swahili to avoid detection in prison. While Sergeant Workley did identify the role of a \u201chit man\u201d within BGF, there was no association with that role and extortion. Similarly, Sergeant Workley\u2019s testimony about Burris\u2019s tattoos was not probative regarding either the identification of Burris as a member of BGF or the State\u2019s theory of motive for him to kill to collect a debt for Bam in BGF.</p>\n<p id=\"b426-6\">With respect to the issue of admissibility of Sergeant Workley\u2019s testimony relative to witness recantation, Sergeant Workley said absolutely nothing to connect Burris\u2019s BGF membership to the reasons for several witnesses recanting in Burris\u2019s case. <em>Cf.

These cases are factually distinguishable, because the gang expert witness in each of these cases provided testimony establishing a nexus between the defendant\u2019s or witness\u2019s gang affiliation and witness recantation. In <em>Gonzalez, </em>for example, the defendant was on trial for murdering members of a rival gang and several members of that rival gang disavowed pre-trial statements implicating Gonzalez at trial. 135 P.3d at 652-53.

Burris was indicted as Tyrone Burris, but Burris styled his Petition for Writ of Certiorari as <em>\u201cShelton Burris a/k/a Tyrone Burris v. State of Maryland.\" </em>We shall, therefore, refer to Burris as Shelton Burris.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b404-9\">.

Throughout the proceedings in this case, however, Bam has been his appellation and we shall continue its use.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b404-10\">. Prior to the initiation of the proceedings on July 20, 2010, with which we are concerned, a mistrial had been declared during or after jury selection in a prior trial that occurred on June 24, 2010. None of those proceedings are implicated here.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b404-11\">. The State, during the pre-trial motions hearing, did not proffer that the victim owed Bam or BGF money, but rather that Mr. Dickerson\u2019s murder \"probably was a case of mistaken identity....\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b405-8\">5. Throughout the trial transcript the name of the gang is spelled \"Black Gorilla Family.\u201d The name of the gang, however, is spelled \u201cBlack Guerilla Family.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b405-9\">. Subsequent to the court's ruling, Burris\u2019s counsel requested a continuing objection \"to anything that has to do with the Black G[ue]rilla Family because I don't think it should be mentioned in this trial.\u201d The trial court allowed for a continuing objection as to references to BGF in the pre-trial recorded statements of witnesses, \"to the extent that it's mentioned by them, with them, to them and from them, I\u2019ll allow your continuing objection.\u201d The court, however, ruled that \"[t]o the extent that it comes in beyond that from someone, I'll want you to object.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b406-6\">. During their interviews with police, these three witnesses identified \"69\u201d or \"6.9\u201d as the nickname of the person committing the conduct that was the subject of the interview. One witness was unable to provide \"69s\u201d real name, but two others identified \"69\" as Shelton Burris.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b406-7\">. Rule 5-802.1(a) provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b406-8\">The following statements previously made by a witness who testifies at the trial or hearing and who is subject to cross-examination concerning the statement are not excluded by the hearsay rule: (a) A statement that is inconsistent with the declarant's testimony, if the statement was (1) given under oath subject to the penalty of perjury at a trial, hearing, or other proceeding or in a deposition; (2) reduced to writing and was signed by the declarant; or (3) recorded in substantially verbatim fashion by stenographic or electronic means contemporaneously with the making of the statement;....</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"9\">\n<p id=\"b407-7\">. Burris\u2019s counsel, in this regard, asked the court prior to Sergeant Workley\u2019s testimony whether he needed to \"object to every single thing or just take a continuing objection....\u201d The Court responded, \"I think you're objecting to his being called and qualified as an expert is sufficient to preserve the issue.... I think that if in fact you wish to object to anything beyond that, that ... it should be specific for some different reason rather than putting you in a position to have to underline each and every question and each and every answer as being prejudicial to your client.\u201d Subsequent to Sergeant Workley\u2019s testimony and the court\u2019s ultimate ruling on the issue, the court opined: \"I <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"378\">*378</page-number>believe you have preserved [your] objections for appeal and if the Appellate Court believes that this evidence is not relevant, then your objections have been well placed and the Court will take the actions they need to take to enforce the law their own way.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"10\">\n<p id=\"b411-11\">. The prosecutor was apparently referring to a Department of Public Safety and Correctional Services \u2018Tdentification/Intelligence Validation Worksheet\u201d in which Burris had been classified as a BGF member. During the testimony of the investigating detective, the State sought to introduce this Worksheet into evidence along with a letter that Burris had sent while incarcerated which he signed \u201cBGF 4 Life,\u201d but Burris\u2019s counsel's objection was sustained and the Worksheet and letter were not admitted. The court ruled, however, \"when your expert on gangs testifies, you may ask your expert is there any reason to believe that he's a member of that and you may show him this and it may come in at that time, but I'm not allowing it in independent of anything else.\u201d During Sergeant Workley\u2019s testimony, the prosecutor did not seek to have the Worksheet introduced into evidence.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"11\">\n<p id=\"b411-12\">. These photos which had previously been authenticated by the testifying investigator eventually were offered and received into evidence after Sergeant Workley's testimony.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"12\">\n<p id=\"b413-9\">. The court was referring not only to Messrs. Sparrow and Lockwood, and Ms. Falcon, but also to Joshua Johnson who testified initially that he did not recall his pre-trial statement to investigators implicating Burris, but after having had his recollection refreshed with the transcript from that interview, testified.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"13\">\n<p id=\"b419-6\">.
