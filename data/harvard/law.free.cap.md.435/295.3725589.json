On October 12, 2012, the Supreme Court of the State of Delaware suspended Respondent from the practice of law in Delaware for a period of one year. The Supreme Court determined that Vanderslice violated the Delaware Lawyers\u2019 Rules of Professional Conduct 1.5(f),<footnotemark>1</footnotemark>1.15(a) and (b),<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> and 8.4(b), (c), and (d).<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> On December <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"298\">*298</page-number>6, 2012 this Court entered an interim suspension of Respondent\u2019s right to practice law in Maryland, pursuant to Rule 16-773(d).<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b328-4\">Proceedings began in this Court on December 5, 2012 when the Attorney Grievance Commission (\u201cPetitioner\u201d or \u201cBar Counsel\u201d), acting pursuant to Rules 16-751(a)(2)<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> and 16-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"299\">*299</page-number>773(b),<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> filed a Petition for Disciplinary or Remedial Action against Vanderslice. Bar Counsel attached to the Petition a certified copy of the Delaware Supreme Court\u2019s per curiam opinion and incorporated into the Petition by reference the findings of fact and conclusions of law issued by that court in the Vanderslice case.</p>\n<p id=\"b329-4\">The Delaware Supreme Court determined that Respondent intentionally committed theft \u201ceight times over a period of ten months!.]\u201d The misappropriated funds were from the law firm of which he was a partner. Respondent also generated deficiently drafted retainer agreements. He violated Delaware Lawyers\u2019 Rules of Professional Conduct 1.5(f), 1.15(a) and (b), and 8.4(b), (c), and (d). Bar Counsel relied upon the Supreme Court\u2019s conclusion that Vanderslice violated Rules 1.5(f), 1.15(a) and (b), and 8.4(b), (c), and (d) of the Delaware Lawyers\u2019 Rules of Professional Conduct, which correspond to Rules 1.5(f), 1.15(a) and (b), and 8.4(b), (c), and (d) of the Maryland Lawyers\u2019 Rules of Professional Conduct (\u201cMLRPC\u201d or \u201cRule\u201d). Bar Counsel requested that we issue a Show Cause Order.</p>\n<p id=\"b329-5\">On December 6, 2012, we issued a Show Cause Order pursuant to Rule 16-773(e).<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> Bar Counsel responded, asked <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"300\">*300</page-number>that reciprocal discipline not be imposed, and requested that we order disbarment because of the existence of \u201cexceptional circumstances\u201d and because the established conduct \u201cwarrants substantially different discipline in this State.\u201d In Vanderslice\u2019s response to the Show Cause Order, he stated that the Delaware Supreme Court\u2019s Opinion in his case speaks for itself, recommended that we impose reciprocal discipline retroactive to October 12, 2012, and requested that no money judgment be entered against him for costs because he has been unemployed since October 24, 2012.</p>\n<p id=\"b330-4\">This case was scheduled for oral argument before this Court on September 10, 2013. Respondent failed to appear for oral argument or offer any explanation for his misconduct. On September 10, we issued a per curiam order and disbarred Vanderslice. We now explain our reasons for ordering his disbarment, rather than ordering reciprocal discipline in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b330-5\">Discussion</p>\n<p id=\"b330-6\">In reciprocal discipline cases, pursuant to Rule 16-773(g), we generally treat the factual findings and conclusions of law from the original jurisdiction as conclusive evidence of an attorney\u2019s misconduct:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b330-7\">(g) Conclusive effect of adjudication. Except as provided in subsection (e)(1) and (e)(2) of this Rule, a final adjudication in a disciplinary or remedial proceeding by another <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"301\">*301</page-number>court, agency, or tribunal that an attorney has been guilty of professional misconduct or is incapacitated is conclusive evidence of that misconduct or incapacity in any proceeding under this Chapter. The introduction of such evidence does not preclude the Commission or Bar Counsel from introducing additional evidence or preclude the attorney from introducing evidence or otherwise showing cause why no discipline or lesser discipline should be imposed.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b331-4\"><em>See also Attorney Grievance Comm\u2019n v. Haas, </em>412 Md. 536, 546, 988 A.2d 1033, 1038 (2010); <em>Attorney Grievance Comm\u2019n v. Whitehead, </em>390 Md. 663, 669, 890 A.2d 751, 754 (2006); <em>Attorney Grievance Comm\u2019n v. Scroggs, </em>387 Md. 238, 249, 874 A.2d 985, 992 (2005). In our review of the Petition for Disciplinary or Remedial Action and the responses to the Show Cause Order, we are guided by Rule 16-773. Pursuant to Rule 16-773(e)(3) and (4), respectively, we do not order reciprocal discipline if there is clear and convincing evidence that either the imposition of corresponding discipline would result in grave injustice, or the conduct established warrants substantially different discipline in this State. Bar Counsel asserts that the facts of this case warrant a more serious sanction than suspension from the practice of law for one year.</p>\n<p id=\"b331-5\">Our Rules provide that we \u201cmay ... impose corresponding discipline,\u201d not that we shall impose \u201cidentical discipline.\u201d <em>See </em>Rule 17-773(1); <em>Attorney Grievance Comm\u2019n v. Gordon, </em>413 Md. 46, 55-56, 991 A.2d 51, 56 (2010). We analyze each case individually \u201cand decide whether to deviate from the original jurisdiction\u2019s sanction[.]\u201d <em>Attorney Grievance Comm\u2019n v. Weiss, </em>389 Md. 531, 547, 886 A.2d 606, 615 (2005). Although most jurisdictions have the same purpose as we do in attorney discipline cases, \u201c[w]e have recognized that the public interest is served when this Court imposes a sanction which demonstrates to members of the legal profession the type of conduct that will not be tolerated.... \u201d <em>Gordon, </em>413 Md. at 56, 991 A.2d at 57 (quoting <em>Attorney Grievance Comm\u2019n v. Sperling, </em>380 Md. 180, 191, 844 A.2d 397, 404 (2004)).</p>\n<p id=\"b332-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"302\">*302</page-number>When considering an appropriate sanction in a reciprocal case, we must look \u201cnot only to the sanction imposed by the other jurisdiction but to our own cases as well. The sanction will depend on the unique facts and circumstances of each case, but with a view toward consistent dispositions for similar misconduct.\u201d <em>Weiss, </em>389 Md. at 548, 886 A.2d at 616. If our cases demonstrate that we would apply a different sanction had the conduct occurred or the case originated in Maryland, we need not follow the original jurisdiction\u2019s sanction. <em>Whitehead, </em>390 Md. at 673, 890 A.2d at 757. Our goal in imposing a sanction in an attorney discipline matter is to protect the public and to deter other lawyers from engaging in similar conduct. <em>Attorney Grievance Comm\u2019n v. Powell, </em>369 Md. 462, 474-75, 800 A.2d 782, 789 (2002). To reach that goal, we will balance our tendency to follow the original jurisdiction\u2019s sanction against our prior cases and the sanctions imposed upon members of this Bar for similar misconduct committed in this State. <em>Attorney Grievance Comm\u2019n v. Katz, </em>429 Md. 308, 317, 55 A.3d 909, 914 (2012) (quoting <em>Gordon, </em>413 Md. at 57, 991 A.2d at 57).</p>\n<p id=\"b332-4\">In <em>Weiss, </em>we pointed out that \u201cwe have become much less lenient towards any misconduct involving theft, misappropriation, fraud, or deceit.\u201d <em>Weiss, </em>389 Md. at 551, 886 A.2d at 617. We have deviated from the original jurisdiction\u2019s sanction and imposed a more serious sanction \u201cwhen the conduct involved is of such a nature that it would not be tolerated from any member of the Bar in this State if the conduct occurred here.\u201d <em>Weiss, </em>389 Md. at 551-52, 886 A.2d at 618. <em>See, e.g., Attorney Grievance Comm\u2019n v. Zodrow, </em>419 Md. 286, 302, 19 A.3d 381, 391 (2011) (holding that disbarment was the proper sanction in a reciprocal action, even when the Colorado Supreme Court only imposed a one year and one day suspension, because \u201c[t]he purpose of [Rule 16-773(e) ] is to ensure that all attorneys of this Bar are subject to similar sanctions for similar misconduct, regardless of whether the misconduct takes place in this State or another jurisdiction\u201d); <em>Attorney Grievance Comm\u2019n v. Beatty, </em>409 Md. 11, 18, 972 A.2d 840, 843-44 (2009) (holding that \u201can indefinite suspension would be the appropri<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"303\">*303</page-number>ate sanction in the case at bar even if the New Jersey Court Rules entitled Respondent to resume practicing law as soon as the period of his [three-month] suspension expired\u201d because other members of the Maryland Bar would be sanctioned in such a way).</p>\n<p id=\"b333-4\">The present case involves an attorney\u2019s misappropriation of funds from the law firm of which he was a partner. Respondent misappropriated \u201cconsultation fees\u201d and \u201cflat fees\u201d from the firm on eight separate occasions between December 2010 and September 2011. \u201cTo mitigate his financial difficulties resulting from [a] pay cut, Respondent misappropriated clients\u2019 [fees as indicated.]\u201d In addition, Respondent prepared deficiently drafted retainer agreements. In those agreements, he \u201cfailed to provide that any retainer was refundable if unearned, even though in practice his firm refunded any unearned retainers to its clients.\u201d Once the law firm discovered the misappropriation, the firm confronted Respondent. He confessed his misconduct and was dismissed immediately. The law firm informed Respondent that he had two weeks to report his wrongdoing to the Delaware Office of Disciplinary Counsel. Respondent apparently reported his misconduct to Delaware\u2019s equivalent of Bar Counsel, but he \u201cdid not report the disciplinary action taken in Delaware to Maryland Bar Counsel pursuant to Md. Rule 16-773(a).\u201d Respondent misappropriated a total of $1,780.00 from the law firm and repaid those funds from a life insurance distribution that the firm owed to Respondent upon his dismissal.</p>\n<p id=\"b333-5\">Respondent agrees that he violated Rule 1.5(f) with regard to his drafting in a deficient manner three retainer agreements. Likewise, he agrees that he violated Rules 1.15(a) and (b), and Rule 8.4(c). The Delaware Supreme Court also determined that Respondent violated 8.4(b) because he \u201ccommitted theft by misappropriating firm funds.\u201d In addition, the Supreme Court determined that Respondent\u2019s conduct was prejudicial to the administration of justice and in violation of 8.4(d) because he \u201ccommitted theft (an offense involving dishonesty and a breach of trust)[.]\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b334-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"304\">*304</page-number>In determining the appropriate sanction, the Delaware Supreme Court considered the American Bar Association Standards, mitigating, and aggravating factors. The Supreme Court concluded that five aggravating factors offset the mitigating factors and imposed a sanction of suspension from the practice of law for one year. As to the aggravating factors, the Supreme Court pointed out that Vanderslice had substantial experience in the practice of law, he did not voluntarily report his misconduct to the Office of Disciplinary Counsel or his law firm, he was involved in eight instances of misconduct over a ten month period, he acted from a dishonest or selfish motive, and there was a pattern of misconduct. As to the mitigating factors, the Supreme Court pointed to the absence of a prior disciplinary record, Vanderslice\u2019s personal or emotional problems stemming from deaths in his family, his character or reputation, his interim rehabilitation, and remorse.</p>\n<p id=\"b334-4\">Vanderslice\u2019s intentional misappropriation of the law firm\u2019s funds clearly violated Rules 8.4(b), (c) and (d). Even though he fully reimbursed the law firm the funds that had been taken, there are exceptional circumstances, under Rule 16-773(e), which warrant \u201csubstantially different discipline\u201d in Maryland. \u201cAbsent compelling extenuating circumstances,\u201d we have said, \u201cintentional misappropriation of client funds or another\u2019s funds is deceitful and dishonest conduct [and] justifies disbarment.\u201d <em>Attorney Grievance Comm. v. Carithers, </em>421 Md. 28, 58, 25 A.3d 181, 199 (2011); <em>see Attorney Grievance Comm\u2019n v. Spery, </em>371 Md. 560, 568, 810 A.2d 487, 491-92 (2002); <em>Attorney Grievance Comm\u2019n v. Vlahos, </em>369 Md. 183, 186, 798 A.2d 555, 556 (2002). In contrast, the Delaware Supreme Court has found that where an attorney stole funds from his law firm on one occasion, then continued to misrepresent the theft to his law firm, and fully reimbursed the firm, had no prior discipline and self-reported, a one-year suspension from the practice of law was appropriate. <em>In re Vanderslice, </em>55 A.3d 322, 328 (Del.2012) (discussing <em>In re Staropoli, </em>865 A.2d 522 (Del.2005)); <em>see also In re Figliola, </em>652 A.2d 1071 (Del.1995) (imposing six-month suspension where an <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"305\">*305</page-number>attorney recklessly and knowingly misappropriated both firm and client funds on multiple occasions, taking into consideration that the attorney had fully reimbursed the funds taken, had no prior discipline, and cooperated with the investigation).</p>\n<p id=\"b335-4\">When imposing the sanction of disbarment, we have also said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b335-5\">[I]n cases of intentional dishonesty, misappropriation cases, fraud, stealing, serious criminal conduct and the like, we will not accept as compelling extenuating circumstances anything less than the most serious and utterly debilitating mental or physical health conditions, arising from any source that is the \u201croot cause\u201d of the misconduct and that also result[s] in an attorney\u2019s utter inability to conform his or her conduct in accordance with the law and the [Maryland Rules of Professional Conduct].</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b335-6\"><em>Attorney Grievance Comm\u2019n v. Vanderlinde, </em>364 Md. 376, 413-14, 773 A.2d 463, 485 (2001). In the present case, there was evidence before the Delaware Supreme Court that Vanderslice, in 2008 and 2009, began to experience personal and emotional problems because of deaths in his family. In 2009, prior to the misappropriation of funds in this case, Vanderslice began seeking treatment for his ongoing depression. Although the Supreme Court found Vanderslice\u2019s personal and emotional problems to be a mitigating factor, it made no finding that Vanderslice\u2019s personal and emotional problems caused his misconduct or affected his day to day activities or interfered with his ability to conform his conduct to the requirements of the Rules of Professional Conduct. In addition, Vanderslice offered no such evidence to this Court or otherwise showed cause why we should not impose the sanction of disbarment.</p>\n<p id=\"b335-7\">In conclusion, consistent with our case law, the appropriate sanction in this reciprocal discipline case is disbarment. There are no adequate mitigating or extenuating circumstances presented to justify a reciprocal or a lesser sanction. The conduct established warrants substantially different discipline in this State.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b327-10\">.
