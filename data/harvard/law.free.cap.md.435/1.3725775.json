This legal matter is important to Petitioner because he links the denial of his motion to suppress evidence to his claim that the evidence, used against him at his subsequent criminal trial, was the unlawfully obtained fruit of his illegal arrest.</p>\n<p id=\"b34-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"4\">*4</page-number>Petitioner advanced this Fourth Amendment claim before the Court of Special Appeals, which, over the State\u2019s strenuous argument to the contrary, concluded that the claim was properly before that Court for review. Petitioner enjoyed only a Pyrrhic victory, however, because the Court of Special Appeals held that the claim failed on its merits. Petitioner seeks from us a second look at the same Fourth Amendment claim, and the State resurrects the argument that the claim is not properly before the appellate courts.</p>\n<p id=\"b34-5\">We agree with the State that Petitioner\u2019s claim is not properly before the appellate courts. Petitioner waived the claim by not raising it before the Circuit Court, as required by Maryland Rule 4-252, and the record otherwise does not support the conclusion reached by the Court of Special Appeals that the claim is capable of appellate review by operation of Maryland Rule 8-131(a). In the following pages we explain why that is so.</p>\n<p id=\"b34-6\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b34-7\">We begin with the historical and procedural facts that form the basis of the present appeal. The incident leading to Petitioner\u2019s arrest began when the police initiated a traffic stop of a vehicle traveling on Interstate 270. Petitioner was one of three occupants, in addition to the driver. As events unfolded, one of the officers on the scene asked the occupants to exit the vehicle. The officer obtained consent from a female passenger to look inside her wallet for identification. Instead of identification, the officer discovered multiple fake credit cards. At some unspecified point thereafter, all the occupants of the vehicle, including Petitioner, were arrested. Petitioner was charged with conspiracy to commit theft, making a false statement to the police while under arrest, and related offenses.</p>\n<p id=\"b34-8\">Before trial, Petitioner filed an \u201cOmnibus Motion\u201d pursuant to Maryland Rule 4-252.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The motion included boilerplate <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"5\">*5</page-number>language requesting suppression of all unlawfully obtained evidence. Relevant here, the motion alleged:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b35-4\">That articles of evidence taken from the Defendant by police authorities were obtained as the result of an illegal search and seizure in violation of the Defendant\u2019s constitutional rights.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b35-5\">WHEREFORE, the Defendant respectfully prays that this Honorable Court suppress all evidence obtained by police authorities as the result of an illegal search and seizure.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AH\">On the day before the scheduled hearing on the motion to suppress, Petitioner filed a \u201cSupplement to Omnibus Motion to Suppress Evidence,\u201d requesting suppression of \u201call evidence obtained as a result of an illegal traffic stop and illegal detention and search on or about October 5, 2010.\u201d The supplement set forth the following allegations:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b35-6\">1. That on October 5, 2010, the Defendant was a passenger in a black Ford Expedition that was traveling northbound on Interstate 270. The vehicle was stopped by the Montgomery County Police at approximately 1:00 p.m. for having blue headlights and for having air fresheners hanging from the rear view mirror.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b35-7\">2. That the Police Officers had no reasonable articulable suspicion that a traffic violation had occurred and therefore no legal basis to stop the vehicle. <em>Whren v. [United </em>States], 517 U.S. 806 [116 S.Ct. 1769, 135 L.Ed.2d 89] (1996), <em>Rowe v. State, </em>363 Md. 424 [769 A.2d 879] (2001).</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b35-8\">3. That the Defendant has standing to challenge the illegal stop of the vehicle. <em>Brendlin v. California, </em>551 U.S. 2[4]9 [127 S.Ct. 2400, 168 L.Ed.2d 132] (2007).</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b35-9\">4. That after the vehicle was stopped, the Officer determined that the vehicle\u2019s driver had a suspended license. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"6\">*6</page-number>The driver was taken to the officer\u2019s vehicle where he was issued traffic citations. After the citations were written, the passengers in the vehicle were illegally detained. <em>Ferris v. State, 355 </em>Md. 356 [735 A.2d 491] (1999).</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b36-5\">5. The detention of the passengers was [a] \u201csecond stop.\u201d The Officers had no independent reasonable articulable suspicion of criminal activity to detain the passengers after making the decision to issue the driver traffic citations. <em>Charity v. State, </em>132 Md.App. 5[98, 753 A.2d 556] (2000).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b36-6\">Neither the omnibus motion nor the supplement specified the evidence that Petitioner sought to suppress.</p>\n<p id=\"b36-7\">At the outset of the motions hearing, Petitioner, through counsel, outlined for the court why the fraudulent credit cards and other unspecified evidence found in the vehicle should be suppressed. Petitioner first asserted that he had standing to challenge the traffic stop, then articulated the basis for his suppression motion:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b36-8\">[I]f the State prevails on the traffic stop issue which we believe was illegal, the issue would then become that it becomes a second stop essentially of the group of people which then leads to a search of the female down the road, and that that second stop of the passengers would also be illegal.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b36-9\">Two witnesses testified at the hearing, Sergeant Mark White and Officer Robert Sheehan, both of whom were called by the State. Petitioner offered no evidence, testimonial or otherwise.</p>\n<p id=\"b36-10\">Sergeant White testified that he was on patrol on Interstate 270 on October 5, 2010, when he drove past a black Ford Expedition. Sergeant White noticed that the Expedition had blue-tinted headlights instead of white<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> and there were multiple air fresheners hanging from the windshield, which he <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"7\">*7</page-number>believed obstructed the view of the driver.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Based on these perceived Code violations, Sergeant White initiated a traffic stop of the Expedition. Before approaching the vehicle, Sergeant White performed a computer search of the Expedition\u2019s license plate number, revealing that the driver\u2019s license of the registered owner of the vehicle, Antoine Norris, had been suspended.</p>\n<p id=\"b37-5\">Following that portion of Sergeant White\u2019s testimony, defense counsel asked the court to hear argument and rule on the legality of the stop. The court agreed, heard from counsel, and ruled that the traffic stop of the vehicle was lawful because Sergeant White\u2019s observation of the blue headlights provided the requisite justification to believe that the owner of the Expedition was violating a Maryland traffic law.</p>\n<p id=\"b37-6\">Sergeant White resumed his testimony, describing next that he approached the driver of the Expedition, Mr. Norris, and asked for his license and registration. Mr. Norris gave Sergeant White an expired learner\u2019s permit, after which Sergeant White asked Mr. Norris to accompany him to the police cruiser and informed Mr. Norris of his intent \u201cto search the vehicle for items related to [Mr. Norris\u2019s] driving while suspended.\u201d Sergeant White then completed three traffic citations: two for driving with a suspended license and one for the obstructed windshield.</p>\n<p id=\"b37-7\">While Sergeant White was speaking with Mr. Norris in the police cruiser, three other officers arrived on the scene, including Officer Sheehan. There were three remaining passengers in the vehicle: an adult female in the front passenger seat, a juvenile female in the rear behind the driver\u2019s seat, and Petitioner in the rear on the passenger side. Officer Sheehan testified that, after briefly engaging the passengers, he asked them to exit the vehicle. Petitioner and the other passenger in the back seat complied immediately with Officer Sheehan\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"8\">*8</page-number>request, but the female in the front passenger seat, later identified as Mashea Ray,<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> did not get out of the vehicle, despite being asked twice by Officer Sheehan. Eventually, after stating that it was cold outside, Ms. Ray grabbed her jacket from the floor directly behind her seat and exited the vehicle. Officer Sheehan asked Ms. Ray if she had any weapons in her jacket, and she replied that she did not. Upon Officer Sheehan\u2019s request, Ms. Ray consented to a search of the jacket to ensure it contained no weapons. During the search of the jacket, Officer Sheehan discovered a large wallet. He testified, \u201cI said is your identification in this wallet? She said no. I said can I search it and make sure? She said something to the effect of yeah, it\u2019s not in there.\u201d Officer Sheehan next testified:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b38-4\">As soon as I opened the wallet I immediately saw a whole stack of credit cards inside the wallet that to me appeared to be fake credit cards. I started pulling them out and one by one I\u2019d say the name on the credit card and I\u2019d ask the female, who\u2019s this person? She said I don\u2019t know. Who\u2019s this person? I don\u2019t know. Who\u2019s this person? I don\u2019t know. So every card that I showed or took out of the wallet and asked her who these people were, she said she didn\u2019t know.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b38-5\">Officer Sheehan testified that Petitioner did not reach for the jacket or claim ownership of it or the wallet.</p>\n<p id=\"b38-6\">Upon completion of the testimony of the two officers, the court heard argument of counsel. Throughout the argument of both counsel, the focus remained squarely on Petitioner\u2019s claim, disputed by the State, that there occurred an unlawful second detention of the vehicle\u2019s occupants, during which the police obtained evidence that Petitioner was entitled to have suppressed.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b39-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"9\">*9</page-number>The State argued that the officers did not unlawfully detain the remaining passengers after issuing the citations because the passengers would have been free to leave had the vehicle not been pulled over on Interstate 270, a controlled access highway.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> Defense counsel disagreed, arguing that the officers unlawfully ordered Petitioner and the other passengers out of the car and detained them instead of ascertaining whether any of them had a valid driver\u2019s license and could drive the Expedition away. The following is an excerpt of the discussion that ensued:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b39-5\">[PROSECUTOR]: [T]he State\u2019s argument is they have to get these people out of there because we\u2019re stuck on 270, as the <em>Timmons [v. State, </em>114 Md.App. 410, 690 A.2d 530 (1997),] case notes. Sometimes you\u2019re in those situations where you have something that looks like a seizure but is not actually a seizure because of the circumstances.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b39-6\">Once that non-seizure, if you will, occurs and the defendant is asked out of the car with the female, what happens next is a variety of consent things with the female, which we already, he has no standing to contest. That leads to what are readily apparent fraudulent credit cards. And at that point, just as if drugs had been discovered, they\u2019ve got probable cause to arrest everybody.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b39-7\">THE COURT: Presumably, at the end of the day, there\u2019s something about what was in her purse that incriminated all of the occupants or more than one of the occupants.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b39-8\">THE COURT: [Defense counsel], where are you in this?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b39-9\">[DEFENSE COUNSEL]: Well, I guess sort of not knowing exactly which issue to address first, I mean, my argument, which I think a lot of which the State and I are on the same page, we agree, is that this is a classic second stop <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"10\">*10</page-number>that the officers did not have the right to perform under <em>Charity </em>and <em>Ferris.</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b40-4\">Later, when the court inquired precisely what evidence Petitioner hoped to suppress, defense counsel explained: \u201cI want to suppress everything, things found in the car,[<footnotemark>7</footnotemark>] as well as what was found on [Ms. Ray], because I don\u2019t think they had the right for that second detention of the group.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b40-5\">As argument before the court continued, defense counsel never strayed from the contention that the evidence found on Ms. Ray and in the Expedition must be suppressed because it was the fruit of an unlawful second stop of the passengers following issuance of the citations to the driver. Counsel argued:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b40-6\">[DEFENSE COUNSEL]: ... there was an illegal detention of these three is my argument.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b40-7\">[DEFENSE COUNSEL]: The group is stopped again, is my argument, illegally, after the citation....</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b40-8\">[DEFENSE COUNSEL]: ... I think what we have here is while [Sergeant White] is [explaining the ticket to the driver], he\u2019s clearly telling [Officer Sheehan], go get everybody else out. They\u2019re clearly at this point, after making that decision, after having those tickets written, it\u2019s been a decision; we\u2019re now going to get everybody else out of the car. That\u2019s the problem I have. <em>That\u2019s where it all becomes illegal.</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b40-9\">And I don\u2019t think it can be saved by saying well, we couldn\u2019t have let them walk off. Right, they can\u2019t let them walk off, but if you\u2019re not in a detention type situation, if everybody is free to go, they\u2019re going to say does anybody have a good license. Yes, I do. Okay, drive away. That\u2019s what\u2019s going to happen, and we have no \u2014 and they didn\u2019t do that. They never go to that point because \u2014 and maybe I <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"11\">*11</page-number>didn\u2019t make this, I guess I didn\u2019t make the argument that well \u2014 we didn\u2019t get to that point when the officers could\u2019ve said does anyone have a valid license and then let the car drive off because they were all three detained. And that\u2019s when we immediately get into this whole, can I search your wallet? Can I search your jacket? And that\u2019s the problem I have. <em>I think it all hinges right there.</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b41-4\">So I would ask that anything after that point be suppressed.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b41-5\">(Emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b41-6\">The court concluded that Officer Sheehan had the authority to order the remaining passengers out of the car while the driver was with Sergeant White and the officers \u201cgot lucky\u201d by discovering the credit cards during the consent search. The court also indicated its concurrence with the State\u2019s concession, <em>see supra </em>note 5, that, had the police officers searched Mr. Norris\u2019s vehicle merely as a search incident to his citation for driving with a suspended license, the search would have been illegal. The court then ruled:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b41-7\">I think this illegal search was interrupted by the consent search of the young woman who had contraband on her, and then of course, once the police discover contraband, they\u2019re not going to ignore that. And so for reasons that I\u2019ve probably articulated, perhaps ad nauseam, the motion to suppress will be denied.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b41-8\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b41-9\">On a later date, trial before the Circuit Court proceeded on an agreed statement of facts. The court found Petitioner guilty of conspiracy to commit theft of property having a value of at least $1,000 but less than $10,000 and making a false statement while under arrest. Petitioner raised several claims on appeal to the Court of Special Appeals, including that the Circuit Court erred in denying the motion to suppress evidence. In support of that argument, Petitioner relied on the theory that all the evidence obtained by the police \u2014 the counterfeit credit cards, Nordstrom shopping bags and merchan<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"12\">*12</page-number>dise, and a statement Petitioner eventually made to the police<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> \u2014 was the fruit of his unlawful arrest.</p>\n<p id=\"b42-5\">The Court of Special Appeals first addressed the State\u2019s argument that Petitioner\u2019s unlawful arrest theory in support of suppression of the evidence was not preserved for appellate review and concluded that it was. The Court of Special Appeals explained its rationale in a footnote:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b42-6\">The issue of whether law enforcement officers had probable cause to arrest appellant is preserved for appellate review because it was raised in the circuit court. Ironically, it was the prosecutor who raised the issue in the circuit court by arguing: \u201c[A]t that point, just as if drugs had been discovered, they\u2019ve got probable cause to arrest everybody.\u201d Afterward, the circuit court, ruling from the bench, endorsed the State\u2019s position by stating: \u201c[0]nce the police discover contraband, they\u2019re not going to ignore that.\u201d That appellant did not mention probable cause while arguing before the circuit court is not relevant. Pursuant to Maryland Rule 8 \u2014 131(a), to be preserved for appellate review, an issue simply needs to be \u201craised in or decided by the trial court,\u201d regardless of which party raises the issue.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b42-7\"><em>Ray v. State, </em>206 Md.App. 309, 337 n. 13, 47 A.3d 1113 (2012) (alterations in original). The Court of Special Appeals held that the police had probable cause to arrest Petitioner under the \u201ccommon enterprise\u201d theory endorsed by <em>Maryland v. Pringle, </em>540 U.S. 366, 124 S.Ct. 795, 157 L.Ed.2d 769 (2003), and therefore any evidence that police obtained pursuant to or as the fruit of that arrest was not subject to suppression.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> <em>See Ray, </em>206 Md.App. at 338-41, 47 A.3d 1113.</p>\n<p id=\"b43-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"13\">*13</page-number>Petitioner then filed with this Court a petition for a writ of certiorari. We granted the petition to consider the following question:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b43-4\">Did the Court of Special Appeals err in holding that there existed probable cause to arrest Mr. Ray under the common enterprise theory developed in <em>Maryland v. Pringle, </em>when a female passenger of the car in which Mr. Ray was also a passenger, consented to a search of her own jacket and of her own wallet found inside her jacket and police discovered counterfeit credit cards inside the wallet that had been used to purchase items later found in shopping bags inside the car?</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b43-5\">We also granted the State\u2019s conditional cross-petition, which asks:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b43-6\">Should the Court of Special Appeals have refused to address Ray\u2019s claim that he was arrested without probable cause where Ray did not challenge the legality of his arrest at the suppression hearing, and as a result, no testimony or evidence was produced on the circumstances of Ray\u2019s arrest?</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b43-7\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b43-8\">Petitioner claims that the Circuit Court wrongly denied his motion to suppress the physical evidence and inculpatory statement to the police on the ground that all of that evidence was the product of an unlawful arrest. In that regard, he insists that the Court of Special Appeals wrongly relied on the rationale and holding of <em>Maryland v. Pringle </em>in holding that Petitioner was lawfully arrested, and that we must correct that error here. We cannot decide the merits of Petitioner\u2019s claim because, as the State argues, the claim is not properly before us for appellate review.</p>\n<p id=\"b44-3\">\n<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"14\">*14</page-number>\n<em>Maryland Rule 1-252</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b44-4\">Maryland Rule 4-252 governs the mandatory motions that are deemed waived unless properly raised in the Circuit Court. The text of that rule provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b44-5\">(a) Mandatory motions. In the circuit court, the following matters <em>shall be raised by motion </em>in conformity with this Rule <em>and if not so raised are waived </em>unless the court, for good cause shown, orders otherwise:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b44-6\">(3) An unlawful search, seizure, interception of wire or oral communication, or pretrial identification;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b44-7\">(e) Content. A motion filed pursuant to this Rule shall be in writing unless the court otherwise directs, <em>shall state the grounds upon which it is made, </em>and shall set forth the relief sought.... Every motion shall contain or be accompanied by a statement of points and citation of authorities.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b44-8\">(Emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b44-9\">The purpose of Rule 4-252 is \u201cto alert both the court and the prosecutor to the precise nature of the complaint, in order that the prosecutor have a fair opportunity to defend against it and that the court understand the issue before it.\u201d <em>Denicolis v. State, </em>378 Md. 646, 660, 837 A.2d 944 (2003). Therefore, the word \u201craise,\u201d as used in subsection (a) of Rule 4-252, is properly defined as meaning \u201c[t]o bring up for discussion or consideration; to introduce or put forward.\u201d Black\u2019s Law Dictionary 1373 (9th ed. 2009). For example, \u201cthe party raised the issue in its pleading.\u201d <em>Id. See also </em>Merriam-Webster\u2019s Collegiate Dictionary 1028 (10th ed. 1999) (defining \u201craise\u201d as \u201cto bring up for consideration or debate\u201d and offering the phrase \u201craise an issue\u201d as an example). It is clear from Petitioner\u2019s motion to suppress and from what he did\u2014 and did not \u2014 argue at the hearing on the motion, that Petitioner did not comply with the dictate of Rule 4-252 that he raise the claim he now asks us to resolve.</p>\n<p id=\"b45-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"15\">*15</page-number>We begin with the omnibus motion, in which Petitioner sought suppression of unidentified evidence claiming merely \u201c[t]hat articles of evidence taken from the Defendant by police authorities were obtained as the result of an illegal search and seizure in violation of the Defendant\u2019s constitutional rights.\u201d The omnibus motion contained no supporting factual allegations, legal arguments, or citations to authority. In the words of Rule 4-252(e), the motion did not \u201cstate the grounds upon which\u201d suppression was sought. <em>See Denicolis, </em>378 Md. at 660, 837 A.2d 944 (describing this species of omnibus motions as those that \u201cseek[] a panoply of relief based on bald, conclusory allegations devoid of any articulated factual or legal underpinning\u201d); <em>Phillips v. State, </em>425 Md. 210, 217 n. 4, 40 A.3d 25 (2012) (cautioning that \u201ca motion that fails to provide either a factual or legal basis for granting the requested relief should not be granted\u201d). We therefore reject Petitioner\u2019s suggestion that the omnibus motion sufficed to put at issue the specific ground for suppression of evidence that it was the fruit of an unlawful arrest.</p>\n<p id=\"b45-4\">Petitioner filed a written supplement to the omnibus motion on the day before the motions hearing. In that motion, Petitioner offered two arguments for suppression of evidence and cited authority for each:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b45-5\">(1) \u201cThat the Police Officers had no reasonable articulable suspicion that a traffic violation had occurred and therefore no legal basis to stop the vehicle. <em>Whren v. [United States], </em>517 U.S. 806 [116 S.Ct. 1769, 135 L.Ed.2d 89] (1996), <em>Rowe v. State, </em>363 Md. 424 [769 A.2d 879] (2001).\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b45-6\">(2) \u201cAfter the citations were written, the passengers were illegally detained. <em>Ferris v. State, </em>355 Md. 356 [735 A.2d 491] (1999).... The detention of the passengers was [a] \u201csecond stop.\u201d The Officers had no independent reasonable articulable suspicion of criminal activity to detain the passengers after making the decision to issue the driver traffic citations. <em>Charity v. State, </em>132 Md.App. 5[98, 753 A.2d 556] (2000).\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b46-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"16\">*16</page-number>This motion satisfies Rule 4-252(e), but the grounds stated in it do not come close to raising unlawful arrest as a ground for suppression of the evidence, and Petitioner does not argue to the contrary.</p>\n<p id=\"b46-5\">Neither did Petitioner comply with the dictates of Rule 4-252(e) by orally injecting the unlawful arrest claim into the motions hearing. Not once during the hearing, which covers nearly 90 pages of transcript, did defense counsel even utter the terms \u201cprobable cause\u201d or \u201carrest\u201d when discussing Petitioner.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> Indeed, at the outset of the hearing, while stating his case for suppression, and throughout the hearing, while examining the police witnesses and later arguing to the court, Petitioner did not deviate from the two-part illegal stop/unlawful second \u201cdetention\u201d of the passengers theory \u2014 the same theory for suppression of evidence he set forth in the supplemental motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b46-6\">Notwithstanding that he never advanced before the motions court, in any way, shape, or form, the unlawful arrest claim he now asserts, Petitioner believes his case is akin to <em>Phillips, </em>in which we deemed it appropriate to address the merits of an issue that was not specifically identified at the Circuit Court level as a ground for suppression of evidence. We do not agree. In that case, the defendant Phillips\u2019s omnibus Rule 4-252 motion sought suppression of illegally obtained statements and confessions made by him, but offered \u201c[n]o facts supporting that allegation and no points or authorities.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 216, 40 A.3d 25. <em>On appeal, </em>Phillips asked this Court to consider whether his statements had been obtained in violation of <em>Edwards v. Arizona, </em>451 U.S. 477, 101 S.Ct. 1880, 68 L.Ed.2d 378 (1981), which dictates that, if an accused invokes his right to have counsel present, police questioning must cease \u201cuntil counsel is made available to him, unless the accused himself initiates further communication, exchanges, or conversations <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"17\">*17</page-number>with the police.\u201d 451 U.S. at 484-85, 101 S.Ct. 1880. The State argued that the issue was not preserved for appellate review, and we noted that <em>Edwards </em>was not cited in the written motion or during the court proceeding. <em>Phillips, </em>425 Md. at 216-17, 40 A.3d 25. But upon review of the hearing, it was \u201cclear from the entire context that counsel and the court understood [compliance with <em>Edwards </em>] to be the issue.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 217, 40 A.3d 25.</p>\n<p id=\"b47-5\">At the outset of the <em>Phillips </em>motions hearing, \u201cdefense counsel advised the court that [Phillips] \u2018was interviewed by the police and he asked for a lawyer, and it is in not honoring that request that brings us to court this morning.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>The prosecution also \u201cnoted that the issues were whether [Phillips] had initiated the conversation and whether doing so constituted a waiver of his right to counsel.\u201d <em>Id. </em>And the court \u201cruled that [Phillips] had initiated the conversation that led to the inculpatory statements and knew what he was doing.\u201d <em>Id. </em>The court and the parties were clearly aware of the argument advanced by Phillips on appeal. Consequently, we were able to address the merits of his claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b47-6\">Petitioner\u2019s case is quite different. Petitioner did not raise the issue of probable cause to arrest in his written motion or at the hearing, and he did not otherwise allude to that theory for suppression of the evidence. It is so that the prosecutor mentioned during argument that, at the point the counterfeit credit cards were found, \u201cjust as if drugs had been discovered, they\u2019ve got probable cause to arrest everybody,\u201d and the court appeared to agree. But that point was not pressed by the prosecutor, and, notably, Petitioner did not dispute the prosecutor\u2019s words. Moreover, the court did not rely on a search incident to arrest theory when ruling on the motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b47-7\">This case is more akin to <em>Miller v. State, </em>380 Md. 1, 843 A.2d 803 (2004), than to <em>Phillips. </em>Miller filed a pre-trial omnibus motion in which he asked, among other things,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AS\">that all evidence seized from his person \u201cat or about the time of the arrest\u201d be suppressed because such evidence \u201cwas seized unlawfully, absent probable cause, and in viola<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"18\">*18</page-number>tion of the United States Constitution, the Maryland Declaration of Rights and other legal rights of this Defendant.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b48-5\"><em>Id. </em>at 49, 843 A.2d 803. When Miller argued on appeal that he had been arrested without probable cause, we agreed with the State that the argument had been waived under Rule 4-252. <em>Id. </em>We noted that \u201cMiller\u2019s omnibus motion gave no details supporting his bald contention that evidence was seized from him \u2018at or about the time of the arrest\u2019 without probable cause. Nor ... did Miller ever pursue the matter at the hearing on the motion.\u201d <em>Id. </em>As a result, we held that, \u201c[although he pressed his complaint about evidence seized during a search of the apartment, pursuant to a warrant, he never mentioned, and thus effectively abandoned, any contention that the arrest itself, or any search incident to it, was without probable cause.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b48-6\">With the exception of its decision in the present case, recent opinions of the Court of Special Appeals are in accord with the principle of law that a claim for suppression of evidence must be advanced <em>and </em>litigated at the trial court level in order to avoid waiver under Maryland Rule 4-252. <em>See Joyner v. State, </em>208 Md.App. 500, 519, 56 A.3d 787 (2012) (refusing to consider, because it was raised for the first time on appeal and thus waived under Maryland Rule 4-252, appellant\u2019s argument seeking suppression of his statements to police on the ground that the <em>Miranda </em>warnings were infirm); <em>Carroll v. State, </em>202 Md.App. 487, 513, 32 A.3d 1090 (2011), <em>aff'd on other grounds, </em>428 Md. 679, 53 A.3d 1159 (2012) (stating that, \u201cif a defendant fails to raise a ground seeking suppression of evidence, which is required to be raised pre-trial by Rule 4-252, the defendant has waived his or her right to appellate review of that issue\u201d). In <em>Joyner, </em>the Court of Special Appeals explained:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b48-7\">In the instant case, appellant failed to raise at the motions hearing the specific argument that Officer McConnell did not advise him that he would be entitled to appointed counsel at no expense____Accordingly, appellant\u2019s contention is not preserved for appellate review because appellant raises this argument for the first time at the appellate <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"19\">*19</page-number>level.... [W]e conclude that appellant\u2019s specific challenge to the admission of his statement has been waived.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b49-5\">208 Md. at 519, 119 A.2d 430.</p>\n<p id=\"b49-6\">Similarly, in the present case, Petitioner filed, and later supplemented, a suppression motion, and argued zealously for suppression at the hearing before the motions court. But his arguments in support of suppression concerned only the legality of the stop of the vehicle and the detention of him and the other passengers after the citations were issued to the driver. Petitioner did not set forth, before or during the motions hearing, the specific grounds, facts, and arguments he now asserts on appeal, i.e., that the officers lacked probable cause to arrest him.</p>\n<p id=\"b49-7\">In sum, Maryland Rule 4-252 dictates that Petitioner, by failing to advance before the Circuit Court the theory that his unlawful arrest requires suppression of all evidence that was the fruit of that unlawful arrest, waived the right to have that claim litigated on direct appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b49-8\">\n<em>Maryland Rule 8-131(a)</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b49-9\">Petitioner contends that, even if the probable cause argument is deemed waived under Maryland Rule 4-252, it is nonetheless ripe for appellate review under Maryland Rule 8-131(a) because it was \u201craised in\u201d and \u201cdecided by\u201d the trial court. The Court of Special Appeals sided with Petitioner, noting that the prosecutor had \u201craised\u201d the issue by commenting \u201cat that point, just as if drugs had been discovered, they\u2019ve got probable cause to arrest everybody,\u201d and the motions court \u201cendorsed\u201d it by observing \u201conce the police discover contraband, they\u2019re not going to ignore that.\u201d <em>Ray, </em>206 Md.App. at 337 n. 13, 47 A.3d 1113. We disagree with our colleagues\u2019 application of Maryland Rule 8 \u2014 131(a) to this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b49-10\">Maryland Rule 8-131(a) provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b49-11\">Generally. The issues of jurisdiction of the trial court over the subject matter and, unless waived under Rule 2-322, over a person may be raised in and decided by the appellate court whether or not raised in and decided by the trial <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"20\">*20</page-number>court. Ordinarily, the appellate court will not decide any other issue unless it plainly appears by the record to have been raised in or decided by the trial court, but the Court may decide such an issue if necessary or desirable to guide the trial court or to avoid the expense and delay of another appeal.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b50-5\">Not one of the operative terms of the Rule is implicated in this case. As the text states, the \u201cissue\u201d must \u201cplainly appear\u201d by the record to have been \u201craised in\u201d the trial court or \u201cdecided by\u201d the trial court. Neither option in the slightest, let alone \u201cplainly,\u201d appears in the record.</p>\n<p id=\"b50-6\">Petitioner did not \u201craise,\u201d before or during the motions hearing, the argument that the police lacked probable cause to arrest him. Neither, for that matter, did he attempt to demonstrate, through cross-examination of the State\u2019s witnesses or testimony of witnesses on his behalf, either precisely when in the sequence of events he was arrested, or what evidence police obtained as a result of the arrest.</p>\n<p id=\"b50-7\">Petitioner argues, and the Court of Special Appeals decided, that, notwithstanding Petitioner\u2019s silence on the subject, the probable cause \u201cissue\u201d was \u201craised\u201d by the prosecutor when he observed:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b50-8\">Once that non-seizure, if you will, occurs and the defendant is asked out of the car with the female, what happens next is a variety of things with the female, which we already [determined] he has no standing to contest. That led to what are readily apparent fraudulent credit cards. And at that point, just as if drugs had been discovered, <em>they\u2019ve got probable cause to arrest everybody.</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b50-9\">The prosecutor\u2019s words did not \u201craise\u201d the probable cause question for consideration and debate by the parties, as we have defined the term. Perhaps more importantly, there was no probable cause \u201cissue\u201d put into play here. An \u201cissue\u201d is \u201ca point in dispute between two or more parties.\u201d Black\u2019s, <em>supra, </em>at 907. Alternatively, an \u201cissue\u201d may be a \u201cconcern\u201d or \u201cproblem\u201d or \u201cthe point at which an unsettled matter is ready for a decision.\u201d Webster\u2019s, <em>supra, </em>at 665. Defense counsel <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"21\">*21</page-number>never contested the prosecutor\u2019s comment that, when police placed Petitioner under arrest \u2014 a moment in time that is not identified in the record \u2014 the police had the requisite probable cause to make the arrest. Because the lawfulness of Petitioner\u2019s arrest was not disputed, it did not become an issue as the term is contemplated by Rule 8-131(a).</p>\n<p id=\"b51-4\">Neither did the motions court \u201cdecide\u201d the lawfulness of Petitioner\u2019s arrest when the court made the following italicized observation:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b51-5\">[PROSECUTOR]: ... And at that point, just as if drugs had been discovered, they\u2019ve got probable cause to arrest everybody.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b51-6\">THE COURT: Presumably, at the end of the day, <em>there\u2019s something about what was in her purse that incriminated all of the occupants </em>or more than one of the occupants.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b51-7\">(Emphasis added). Nor the did the court \u201cdecide\u201d the issue when it wondered:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b51-8\">[DEFENSE COUNSEL]: ... You don\u2019t have to take everybody back to the police station. If a car\u2019s broken down and there\u2019s one person, they could ride with the tow truck. If there\u2019s three people and someone has a valid \u2014 odds are, someone\u2019s got a valid license.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b51-9\">THE COURT: Well, we\u2019re missing a point. When we get the woman out of the car and she\u2019s got all these credit cards, <em>that\u2019s a problem, isn\u2019t it?</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b51-10\">(Emphasis added). And the court did not \u201cdecide\u201d the issue of the lawfulness of Petitioner\u2019s arrest when the court ruled:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AL\">I think this illegal search was interrupted by the consent search of the young woman who had contraband on her, and then of course, <em>once the police discover contraband, they\u2019re not going to ignore that. </em>And so for reasons that I\u2019ve probably articulated, perhaps ad nauseam, the motion to suppress will be denied.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b51-11\">(Emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b51-12\">In the context of Rule 4-252, the term \u201cdecide\u201d means \u201cto make a final choice or judgment about\u201d; \u201cto select as a course <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"22\">*22</page-number>of action\u201d; or \u201cto infer on the basis of evidence.\u201d Webster\u2019s, <em>supra, </em>at 322. The term \u201cimplies previous consideration of a matter causing doubt, wavering, debate, or controversy.\u201d <em>Id. </em>There is no indication that the motions court was \u201cconsidering\u201d or making any sort of \u201cjudgment\u201d about whether the police possessed the requisite probable cause to arrest Petitioner at the time they did so, much less what evidence the police obtained pursuant to, or following from, the arrest that would be subject to suppression were the arrest not supported by probable cause.</p>\n<p id=\"b52-5\">In a final attempt to secure our review of his unlawful arrest claim, Petitioner asks that we exercise our discretion to address the merits of the claim, pursuant to Maryland Rule 8-131(a). For this Court to attempt a resolution of the merits of Petitioner\u2019s claim, on the basis of the record before us, would be an abuse of our discretion.</p>\n<p id=\"b52-6\">\u201cThe primary purpose of Rule 8-131(a) is to ensure fairness for all parties and to promote the orderly administration of law.\u201d <em>Jones v. State, </em>379 Md. 704, 713-14, 843 A.2d 778 (2004). Although the Rule clearly authorizes an appellate court to address an unpreserved issue, we have warned that \u201c[s]uch prerogative to review an unpreserved claim of error ... is to be rarely exercised and only when doing so furthers, rather than undermines, the purposes of the rule.\u201d <em>Robinson v. State, </em>410 Md. 91, 103-04, 976 A.2d 1072 (2009). <em>See also Conyers v. State, </em>354 Md. 132, 151, 729 A.2d 910 (1999) (\u201cWe usually elect to review an unpreserved issue only after it has been thoroughly briefed and argued, and where a decision would (1) help correct a recurring error, (2) provide guidance when there is likely to be a new trial, or (3) offer assistance if there is a subsequent collateral attack on the conviction.\u201d). In particular, \u201c[t]his discretion should be exercised only when it is clear that it will not work an unfair prejudice to the parties or to the court.\u201d <em>Jones, </em>379 Md. at 714, 843 A.2d 778. We have previously offered an example of such an unfair prejudice:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b53-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"23\">*23</page-number>For example, with respect to the parties, a new argument presented by the State would work unfair prejudice to a criminal defendant if its validity depended upon evidence not adduced at the trial level. In such a case, an appellate court\u2019s consideration of the argument would most likely be an abuse of its discretion under Rule 8-131(a) because it would be manifestly unfair to the defendant who had no opportunity to respond to the argument with his own evidence to the contrary.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b53-4\"><em>Id. </em>(citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b53-5\">With the exception of the reversal of roles, this example from <em>Jones </em>is not at all different from the situation at hand. Petitioner wishes us to address on appeal an issue that was not litigated at the trial level, thus depriving the State of any opportunity to introduce additional evidence or advance a new theory in opposition to Petitioner\u2019s argument. We have advised appellate courts to consider precisely that concern before exercising discretion pursuant to Rule 8 \u2014 131(a):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b53-6\">It is a discretion that appellate courts should rarely exercise, as considerations of both fairness and judicial efficiency ordinarily require that all challenges that a party desires to make to a trial court\u2019s ruling, action, or conduct be presented in the first instance to the trial court so that (1) a proper record can be made with respect to the challenge, and (2) the other parties and the trial judge are given an opportunity to consider and respond to the challenge.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b53-7\"><em>Chaney v. State, </em>397 Md. 460, 468, 918 A.2d 506 (2007). The case before us is deficient in both regards.</p>\n<p id=\"b53-8\">\u201cIn reviewing the denial of a motion to suppress evidence allegedly seized in violation of the Fourth Amendment, we are confined to the record developed at the suppression hearing.\u201d <em>McCracken v. State, </em>429 Md. 507, 515, 56 A.3d 242 (2012). In this case, the record from the motions hearing tells us very little about the circumstances of Petitioner\u2019s arrest. The testimony of the State\u2019s witnesses focused on the events leading up to and including the discovery of the credit cards in Ms. Ray\u2019s wallet. Although both officers mentioned that the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"24\">*24</page-number>vehicle\u2019s occupants were all transported to the police station, the officers did not say when, or even whether, any of the passengers were arrested.</p>\n<p id=\"b54-5\">We know, of course, that Petitioner was arrested at some point and was tried and convicted of charges that arose out of the incident that began with the traffic stop on Interstate 270. But the hearing on the motion to suppress evidence tells us nothing that we would need to know in order to decide: (1) when petitioner was arrested; (2) what the police had reason to suspect at the moment of arrest; (3) whether that suspicion rose to the level of probable cause to believe Petitioner had committed or was committing a crime; and (4) what evidence the police obtained upon Petitioner\u2019s arrest or as the fruits of it. Not one of those facts can be known from the record we have before us. We therefore should not consider Petitioner\u2019s claim that he was unlawfully arrested, much less that he was entitled to suppression of certain evidence as the result. For that reason as well, we offer no comment on the correctness of the Court of Special Appeals\u2019s reasoning and legal conclusion about the merits of Petitioner\u2019s claim of unlawful arrest.</p>\n<p id=\"b54-6\">IV.</p>\n<p id=\"b54-7\">Petitioner has presented in this Court no claim that can be resolved in his favor. By operation of Rule 4-252, he has waived the right to raise on appeal that he was entitled to have the Circuit Court suppress certain evidence on the ground that the evidence was the product of an unlawful arrest. Neither is Petitioner\u2019s claim preserved for appellate review by operation of Rule 8 \u2014 131(a). The claim was not raised or decided in the Circuit Court and the record does not support the proper exercise of appellate court discretion to overlook the lack of preservation of the claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b54-8\">JUDGMENT OF THE COURT OF SPECIAL APPEALS AFFIRMED.

Nonetheless, I dissent because I disagree with the Majority\u2019s failure to vacate the Court of Special Appeals\u2019 holding about the merits of Ray\u2019s Fourth Amendment claim\u2014 a decision that rests on an expanded and worrisome interpretation of <em>Maryland v.

Yet the Majority affirms the Court of Special Appeals, offering \u201cno comment on the correctness of the Court of Special Appeals\u2019 reasoning!.]\u201d <em>Id. </em>This means that the Court of Special Appeals\u2019 holding will be applied by trial courts until the next time this Court decides a case applying <em>Pringle </em>in a similar context. The Court of Special Appeals\u2019 opinion, however, relies on a novel interpretation of <em>Pringle </em>that is inconsistent with its rationale and unsupported by precedent.</p>\n<p id=\"b55-8\">The finding of probable cause to arrest and search in <em>Pringle </em>was predicated on the underlying nature of the contraband and criminal enterprise in question. In that case, officers found $763 in rolled-up bills and five glassine baggies of cocaine in a car with a driver and two passengers. <em>Pringle, </em>540 U.S. at 371-72, 124 S.Ct. at 800. The Court used these facts to conclude that contraband found \u201cindicated the likelihood of drug dealing, an enterprise to which a dealer would be unlikely to admit an innocent person with the potential to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"26\">*26</page-number>furnish evidence against him.\u201d <em>Pringle, </em>540 U.S. at 373, 124 S.Ct. at 801. This implies a two-step analysis for determining whether other car passengers are in a common enterprise with the individual to whom contraband is attributed. <em>See id. </em>The first step is to determine what enterprise the quantity and type of contraband evidences. <em>Id. </em>The second step is to determine if a person engaged in the enterprise would be unlikely to admit an innocent person. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b56-4\">Regarding the first step, the contraband here was a stack of credit cards found in a wallet held in the coat pocket of co-passenger, Mashea Ray. <em>Ray v. State, </em>206 Md.App. 309, 318, 47 A.3d 1113, 1117 (2012) (\u201cOfficer Sheehan testified that, he \u2018saw a whole stack of credit cards inside the wallet that to [him] appeared to be fake credit cards. [He] starting [sic] pulling them out and one by one[, and he would] say the name on the credit card and [] ask [Mashea], who\u2019s this person?\u2019 According to Officer Sheehan, every time that he showed a credit card to Mashea, \u2018she said she didn\u2019t know' who the person was whose name was on the credit card\u201d). The officer on the scene determined that these were counterfeit credit cards. The enterprise suggested, then, is possession of a counterfeit credit card. Md.Code (2002), \u00a7 8-205(b)(3)(ii) of the Criminal Law Article (\u201cA person may not, with the intent to defraud another transfer or possess ... a falsely embossed credit card with knowledge that the credit card was falsely made or falsely embossed\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b56-5\">The second step is to determine whether a person engaged in the enterprise would be unlikely to admit an innocent person to the place of the criminal enterprise. Courts have, based on the nature of the underlying enterprise, found that some criminal acts did not pass the \u201cunlikely to admit an innocent person\u201d test. <em>See Perkins v. U.S., </em>936 A.2d 303, 308 (D.C.2007) (deciding to \u201cnot ... infer a common enterprise between the driver and the passenger in the case at bar; that is, we would not say that one illegally possessing an open container of malt liquor in his car would be unlikely to admit an innocent person as a passenger\u201d); <em>In re T.H., </em>898 A.2d 908, 914 (D.C.2006) (holding that \u201cthe presence of fireworks in a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"27\">*27</page-number>vehicle \u2014 particularly within days of the Fourth of July \u2014 is not so \u2018obviously criminal\u2019 as to make the driver of the SUV \u2018unlikely to admit an innocent person with the potential to furnish evidence against him\u2019 \u201d (citations omitted)).</p>\n<p id=\"b57-4\">Here, Mashea Ray was suspected of the possession of fake credit cards. Although this crime is more serious than the previous two examples, it still does not qualify as a crime that justifies the presumption that such a person would be unlikely to admit an innocent party to her enterprise. <em>Contra Pringle, </em>540 U.S. at 373, 124 S.Ct. at 801. Unlike drugs, which are obviously criminal in their mere appearance, multiple credit cards in a concealed wallet, irrespective of their provenance, are not obviously criminal. Unlike drugs, credit cards are normally kept inside a wallet, and are, thus, concealed. Moreover, possessing or using multiple payment cards is not unusual. <em>See, e.g., </em>Kevin Foster, et al., <em>The 2009 Survey of Consumer Payment Choice, </em>Public Policy Discussion Paper No. 11-1 (Federal Reserve Bank of Boston, Boston, MA), 2011 at 13 (stating that \u201cthe average adopter of payment cards had 1.3 debit cards, 3.7 credit cards and 2.3 prepaid cards\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b57-5\">Even when credit cards are fraudulently used to shop for goods, the only persons involved in the transaction are the fraudster and the store personnel who are defrauded. No shopping companion (or person in the car) needs to be aware of the fraudulent nature of the cards in order to facilitate the fraud. Using or selling illicit drugs, on the other hand, often requires a network of people aware of the criminal enterprise, particularly when the quantity is significant, as were the five glassine baggies in <em>Pringle. See Pringle, </em>540 U.S. at 372, 124 S.Ct. at 800. It is the highly unusual case that one person would engage in dealing a large quantity of drugs without the involvement of those close by. The <em>modus operandi </em>of a typical drug dealer was discussed in a federal case as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AJ\">[The police expert witness] testified that the typical drug buy in the Harlem area involved two to five people. As a result of frequent police sweeps, Harlem drug dealers were becoming so cautious that they employed <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"28\">*28</page-number>people who act as steerers and the steerer\u2019s responsibility is basically to determine whether or not you are actually an addict or a user of heroin and they are also used to screen you to see if there is any possibility of you being a cop looking for a bulge or some indication that would give them that you are not actually an addict. And a lot of the responsibility relies [sic] on them to determine whether or not the drug buy is going to go down or not.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b58-4\"><em>U.S. v. Brown, </em>776 F.2d 397, 400 (2d Cir.1985) (quoting testimony of police expert witness). Hence, the presumption in Pringle makes sense when the kind of contraband is narcotics and the quantity is significant.</p>\n<p id=\"b58-5\">At the time that Bashawn Ray was arrested, the police knew only that Mashea Ray, his co-passenger,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> possessed seemingly fraudulent credit cards. Unlike <em>Pringle, </em>where no one would acknowledge possession of the drugs, here, Mashea Ray picked up \u201cher jacket from the floor that was directly behind her seat\u201d as she exited the car, and explicitly acknowledged the wallet as her own. <em>Compare Pringle, </em>540 U.S. at 372, 124 S.Ct. at 800, <em>with Ray, </em>206 Md.App. at 317, 47 A.3d at 1117. There was no evidence to support an inference that other persons in the car were involved in an enterprise to use the credit cards fraudulently. Thus the second analytical prong of <em>Pringle </em>is not satisfied, and there was no probable cause to arrest Mr. Ray.</p>\n<p id=\"b58-6\">In its ruling, the Court of Special Appeals, in one broad sweep concluded that any criminal act by an automobile occupant would trigger the <em>Pringle </em>rule, simply saying that \u201c[c]riminal statutes govern the possession of both counterfeited credit cards and controlled dangerous substances.\u201d <em>Ray, </em>206 Md.App. at 340, 47 A.3d at 1131. Based on this alone, it concluded that the credit cards in Mashea\u2019s wallet met the <em>Pringle </em>standard of showing that all occupants were likely engaged in an enterprise into which a perpetrator would be unlikely to admit an innocent person. <em>Id. </em>In so doing, the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"29\">*29</page-number>intermediate appellate court announced and applied a different standard for the arrest of persons in cars, one which assumes that <em>all </em>indicia of criminal activity found in a car will be attributed to each and every passenger unless an occupant can prove that the object \u201cbelong[s] to a unique class of contraband whose possession cannot be attributed to more than one person.\u201d <em>Ray, </em>206 Md.App. at 341, 47 A.3d at 1131. To extend the presumption in such a way would be an appreciable, and I submit, unjustified expansion of <em>Pringle, </em>reaching circumstances neither contemplated in the ruling nor consonant with its motivating considerations. Indeed, it renders riding in a car with other people a rather hazardous occupation.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Such a change risks imperiling the protections accorded all persons from unwarranted arrest guaranteed by the Fourth Amendment.</p>\n<p id=\"b59-4\">In sum, the Majority has correctly determined that Mr. Ray\u2019s appeals were not properly preserved. It has erred, I submit, by inexplicably refusing to vacate an improper and worrisome discussion of <em>Pringle. </em>For this reason, I most respectfully dissent.</p>\n<p id=\"b59-5\">Judge GREENE authorizes me to state that he shares the views set forth in this dissenting opinion.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b58-7\">. There was no evidence as to whether Petitioner and Mashea Ray were related.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b59-6\">. For example, Court of Special Appeals\u2019 rule could result in the following scenario. The president of her high school class and first-chair violin is being driven to an orchestra recital by her parent. The parent then picks up a fellow student who deposits his flute case by the violinist's feet. Unbeknownst to the violinist, the flautist has fifty counterfeit dollar bills in his flute case. The parent is then stopped by a traffic officer due to a broken taillight and consents to a search of the vehicle. The officer then receives permission from the flautist to open his case and finds the counterfeit currency. Applying the Court of Special Appeals' rationale, because counterfeit money does not \"belong to a unique class of contraband whose possession cannot be attributed to more than one person,\u201d it would constitute probable cause to arrest the violinist, a seemingly unfair and undesirable result. <em>Ray v. State, 206 </em>Md.App. 309, 341, 47 A.3d 1113, 1131 (2012).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
