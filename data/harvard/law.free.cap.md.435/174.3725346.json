On June 1, 1999, Miller pled guilty in the Circuit Court for Prince George\u2019s County to possession of cocaine with intent to distribute, in violation of Section 286(f)(l)(ii) of Article 27 of the Maryland Code (1957, 1996 Repl. Vol.)<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> and was sentenced to five years\u2019 incarceration. During sentencing, Miller was informed of his right to file an application for leave to appeal his conviction to the Court of Special Appeals, but he did not pursue that path.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Miller finished serving his mandatory five-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"179\">*179</page-number>year sentence and while incarcerated also did not file any petition for post-conviction relief.</p>\n<p id=\"b209-4\">United States Department of Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) initiated deportation proceedings against Miller, because of his 1999 conviction, after he traveled to his native country in 2008 and was detained upon reentry into the United States. In order to forestall his being deported, Miller filed a Petition for a Writ of Error Coram Nobis, pursuant to Maryland Rule 15-1202.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> In that Petition, Miller asserted <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"180\">*180</page-number>\u201cthat his guilty plea was not entered knowingly and intelligently, due to the failure to advise him on the record of the possible immigration consequences attendant to his plea.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b210-5\">On August 21, 2009, Judge Maureen M. Lamasney of the Circuit Court for Prince George\u2019s County conducted a hearing on Miller\u2019s Petition, during which she accepted the transcript of his guilty plea proceeding, which had been made an attachment to Miller\u2019s Petition and showed Miller was not advised on the record of the possibility of adverse immigration consequences. Miller testified during the hearing that he was not aware nor was he advised of the possibility of deportation by his attorney, even though his attorney was aware that he was not a citizen. Judge Lamasney denied the Petition, ruling that a trial court needed only inform a defendant of the \u201cdirect\u201d consequences of a plea, which did not include the possibility of deportation: \u201c[i]t is clear from the record that the plea Court did not inform [Miller] of ... possible immigration consequences.... However, \u2018consequences of the plea\u2019 has been interpreted to mean \u2018direct\u2019 consequences.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b210-6\">Miller appealed to the Court of Special Appeals; while his appeal was pending, the United States Supreme Court decided <em>Padilla v. Kentucky, </em>559 U.S. 356, 360, 130 S.Ct. 1473, 1478, 176 L.Ed.2d 284, 290 (2010), in which the Court held that \u201cconstitutionally competent counsel\u201d was required to inform Padilla \u201cthat his conviction for drug distribution made him subject to automatic deportation.\u201d In so holding, the Court analyzed the two-pronged test set forth in <em>Strickland v. Washington, </em>466 U.S. 668, 104 S.Ct. 2052, 80 L.Ed.2d 674 (1984) and <em>Hill v. Lockhart, </em>474 U.S. 52, 106 S.Ct. 366, 88 L.Ed.2d 203 (1985) (applying <em>Strickland </em>in the context of guilty pleas), by which courts would determine initially wheth<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"181\">*181</page-number>er an attorney\u2019s representation fell below an objective standard of reasonableness considering prevailing professional norms and, if so, whether there is a reasonable probability the result of the proceeding would have been different, but for the errors. <em>Padilla, </em>559 U.S. at 365, 130 S.Ct. at 1484, 176 L.Ed.2d at 294. The Court explained that it had \u201cnever applied a distinction between direct and collateral consequences to define the scope of constitutionally \u2018reasonable professional assistance\u2019 required under <em>Strickland </em>\u201d and that the collateral versus direct distinction was \u201cill-suited to evaluating a <em>Strickland </em>claim concerning the specific risk of deportation\u201d due to its \u201cclose connection to the criminal process.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 366, 130 S.Ct. at 1481-82, 176 L.Ed.2d at 293-94. The Court concluded, therefore, \u201cthat advice regarding deportation is not categorically removed from the ambit of the Sixth Amendment right to counsel [and, therefore] <em>Strickland </em>applied] to Padilla\u2019s claim.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 366, 130 S.Ct. at 1482, 176 L.Ed.2d at 294. The Court held that constitutionally competent counsel is required to \u201cprovide her client with available advice about an issue like deportation and the failure to do so \u2018clearly satisfies the first prong of the <em>Strickland </em>analysis.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>at 371, 130 S.Ct. at 1484, 176 L.Ed.2d at 297, quoting <em>Hill, </em>474 U.S. at 62, 106 S.Ct. 366, 88 L.Ed.2d 203 (White, J., concurring in judgment). The Court then remanded the case for consideration of whether Padilla suffered prejudice because of his counsel\u2019s deficient performance. <em>Id. </em>at 375, 130 S.Ct. at 1487, 176 L.Ed.2d at 299.</p>\n<p id=\"b211-5\">In light of the Supreme Court\u2019s holding, the Court of Special Appeals considered Miller\u2019s claim to be controlled by the determination of whether <em>Padilla </em>applied \u201cto invalidate [Miller\u2019s] guilty plea entered on June 1, 1999[.]\u201d <em>Miller v. State, </em>196 Md.App. 658, 660, 11 A.3d 340, 341 (2010). In determining that <em>Padilla </em>did not retroactively apply, prior to 2010, to vacate Miller\u2019s conviction, the intermediate appellate court determined that <em>\u201cPadilla v. Kentucky </em>announced new law\u201d inapplicable to Miller\u2019s conviction. <em>Id. </em>at 679-80, 11 A.3d at 352. In so doing, the court applied the retroactivity test set forth in <em>Teague v. Lane, </em>489 U.S. 288, 109 S.Ct. 1060, 103 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"182\">*182</page-number>L.Ed.2d 334 (1989), in which the Supreme Court had determined that a \u201cnew rule,\u201d defined as a rule that \u201cbreaks new ground or imposes a new obligation on the States\u201d or a rule where \u201cthe result was not dictated by precedent existing at the time the defendant\u2019s conviction became final,\u201d would not apply retroactively. Miller, 196 Md.App. at 666, 11 A.3d at 344 (emphasis omitted), quoting <em>Teague, </em>489 U.S. at 301, 109 S.Ct. at 1070, 103 L.Ed.2d at 349.</p>\n<p id=\"b212-5\">Miller, thereafter, filed a Petition for Writ of Certiorari in this Court presenting the sole question of whether Padilla\u2019s holding \u201cthat failure to advise a non-citizen client about deportation as a possible consequence of a guilty plea constitutes ineffective representation, [should] be applied retroactively\u201d to cases finalized before <em>Padilla. </em>423 Md. 453, 31 A.3d 921 (2011). This question, however, previously had been queued up in the case of <em>Denisyuk v. State </em>in which we already had granted certiorari to answer whether <em>Padilla </em>applied to Denisyuk\u2019s challenge to his 2006 conviction, which, he averred, should have been vacated because his counsel had been ineffective for having failed to advise him of potential adverse immigration consequences prior to pleading guilty. 415 Md. 38, 997 A.2d 789 (2010). In <em>Denisyuk v. State, </em>422 Md. 462, 466, 473, 30 A.3d 914, 916, 920 (2011), we subsequently determined that <em>Padilla </em>should be applied retroactively to Sixth Amendment claims arising after the effective date of the Illegal Immigration Reform and Immigrant Responsibility Act of 1996, after which deportation for certain crimes became practically inevitable for noncitizens: \u201c[W]e hold that <em>Padilla </em>applies to postconviction claims arising from guilty pleas obtained after the enactment of the Illegal Immigration Reform and Immigrant Responsibility Act of 1996, Pub.L. No. 104-208, 110 Stat. 3009-546 (effective April 1,1997)----\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b212-6\">The retroactivity test relied upon in <em>Denisyuk </em>was derived from <em>State v. Daughtry, </em>419 Md. 35, 18 A.3d 60 (2011), which required a determination \u201cof whether a particular judicial decision ... overrules prior law and declares a new principle of law. If a decision does not ... the decision applies retroactively in the same manner as most court decisions.\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"183\">*183</page-number><em>Id. </em>at 78, 18 A.3d at 86, quoting <em>Houghton v. County Com\u2019rs of Kent Co., </em>307 Md. 216, 220, 513 A.2d 291, 293 (1986). We also noted, \u201c \u2018where a decision has applied settled precedent to new and different factual situations, the decision always applies retroactively[,]\u2019 and it is only \u2018where a new rule ... constitutes a clear break from the past ... \u2019 that the question of prospective only application arises.\u201d <em>Denisyuk, </em>422 Md. at 478, 30 A.3d at 923, quoting <em>Potts v. State, </em>300 Md. 567, 577, 479 A.2d 1335, 1341 (1984), quoting in turn <em>United States v. Johnson, </em>457 U.S. 537, 549, 102 S.Ct. 2579, 73 L.Ed.2d 202 (1982).</p>\n<p id=\"b213-5\">Utilizing this test, we determined <em>Padilla </em>did not overrule prior law and declare a new principle of law, but rather applied settled <em>precedent </em>\u2014 Strickland\u2014to a new and different factual situation, and, therefore, <em>Padilla </em>applied retroactively. <em>Denisyuk, </em>422 Md. at 481-82, 30 A.3d at 925, citing <em>Daughtry, </em>419 Md. at 78, 18 A.3d at 86; <em>Potts, </em>300 Md. at 577, 479 A.2d at 1341. In so doing, we noted that a number of courts had previously addressed the retroactivity of <em>Padilla </em>and although \u201cthe decisions [were] not uniform in holding that <em>Padilla </em>applie[d] retroactively, we [were] persuaded that those\u201d cases that held <em>Padilla </em>applied retroactively \u201crepresented] the better reasoned view,\u201d <em>Denisyuk, </em>422 Md. at 479, 30 A.3d at 923-24, but also recognized that \u201call of these courts used the retroactivity test set forth in <em>Teague v. Lane, </em>489 U.S. 288, 109 S.Ct. 1060, 103 L.Ed.2d 334 (1989).\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 480 n. 8, 30 A.3d at 924 n. 8. We suggested, nevertheless, that were the Supreme Court to determine <em>Padilla </em>did not apply retroactively under <em>Teague, </em>our opinion regarding retroactivity would remain valid because \u201cMaryland has not adopted <em>Teague, </em>nor must it. Thus, even if the Supreme Court ever were to hold that <em>Padilla </em>is not retroactive under <em>Teague, </em>that holding would have no adverse effect on our analysis here.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 480 n. 8, 30 A.3d at 924-25 n. 8, citing <em>Danforth v. Minnesota, </em>552 U.S. 264, 282, 128 S.Ct. 1029, 169 L.Ed.2d 859 (2008).</p>\n<p id=\"b213-6\">We, then, granted Miller\u2019s petition for certiorari, 423 Md. 453, 31 A.3d 921 (2011), and remanded the case to the Court of Special Appeals for reconsideration in light of <em>Denisyuk. </em>423 Md. 474, 32 A.3d 1 (2011). Prior to the Court of Special <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"184\">*184</page-number>Appeals\u2019 decision on remand, however, the Supreme Court granted certiorari in <em>Chaidez v. United States, </em>655 F.3d 684 (7th Cir.2011), to consider whether <em>Padilla </em>had retroactive effect. 566 U.S. -, 132 S.Ct. 2101, 182 L.Ed.2d 867. Thereafter, the Court of Special Appeals once again affirmed the denial of Miller\u2019s Petition for a Writ of Error Coram Nobis, holding that Miller had raised the issue of the voluntariness of his plea in his Petition but not ineffective assistance of counsel, so that <em>Padilla </em>and <em>Denisyuk </em>were not applicable to his case:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b214-7\">[O]ur <em>Miller v. State[, </em>196 Md.App. 658, 11 A.3d 340 (2010) ] deals only with the voluntariness of a guilty plea. <em>Padilla v. Kentucky, </em>for its part, does not deal with and has absolutely nothing to say about the voluntariness of a guilty plea. The Court of Appeals\u2019s opinion in <em>Denisyuk v. State </em>also does not deal with and has absolutely nothing <em>to </em>say about the voluntariness of a guilty plea. Conversely, the retroactive Sixth Amendment relief sanctioned by <em>Denisyuk </em>was never requested by Miller____The petition for coram nobis relief never so much as mentioned the Sixth Amendment, and the subject was not raised at the subsequent hearing. Our opinion in <em>Miller v. State </em>was not predicated on the Sixth Amendment in any way----This is our primary reason for concluding, on reconsideration, that <em>Denisyuk v. State </em>neither compels nor persuades us to reach a different result in <em>Miller v. State. </em>The two cases deal with totally different subjects.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b214-12\"><em>Miller v. State, </em>207 Md.App. 453, 464-65, 53 A.3d 385, 392 (2012).</p>\n<p id=\"b214-14\">In the midst of this whirlwind of judicial activity, we granted certiorari, 429 Md. 528, 56 A.3d 1241 (2012),<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> and prior to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"185\">*185</page-number>oral argument before us, the Supreme Court decided <em>Chaidez v. United States, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 133 S.Ct. 1103, 185 L.Ed.2d 149 (2013), in which the Court held that <em>Padilla </em>did not apply retroactively under <em>Teague </em>because <em>Padilla </em>had announced a \u201cnew rule\u201d of constitutional criminal procedure. The Court acknowledged that \u201cgarden variety\u201d applications of the test in <em>Strickland </em>\u201cdo not produce new rules\u201d but concluded that <em>\u201cPadilla </em>did something more\u201d:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b215-7\">Before deciding if failing to provide [advice regarding the possibility of adverse immigration consequences] \u201cfell below an objective standard of reasonableness,\u201d <em>Padilla </em>considered a threshold question: Was advice about deportation \u201ccategorically removed\u201d from the scope of the Sixth Amendment right to counsel because it involved only a \u201ccollateral consequence\u201d of a conviction, rather than a component of the criminal sentence? In other words, prior to asking <em>how </em>the <em>Strickland </em>test applied (\u201cDid the attorney act unreasonably?\u201d), <em>Padilla </em>asked <em>whether </em>the <em>Strickland </em>test applied (\u201cShould we even evaluate if this attorney acted unreasonably?\u201d) .... [T]hat preliminary question about <em>Strickland\u2019s </em>ambit came to the <em>Padilla </em>Court unsettled \u2014 so that the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"186\">*186</page-number>Court\u2019s answer (\u201cYes, <em>Strickland </em>governs here\u201d) required a new rule.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b216-6\"><em>Chaidez, </em>\u2014 U.S. at -, 133 S.Ct. at 1107-08, 185 L.Ed.2d at 156-57. The Court further noted that prior to <em>Padilla, </em>ten federal appellate courts and thirty state appellate courts to which the issue was presented determined that the Sixth Amendment did not require defense counsel to inform a client that a guilty plea would have adverse immigration consequences, and \u201cif [holding contrary to this weight of authority] does not count as \u2018breaking] new ground\u2019 or \u2018imposing] a new obligation,\u2019 we are hard pressed to know what would.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at -, 133 S.Ct. at 1109-10, 185 L.Ed.2d at 159, quoting <em>Teague, </em>489 U.S. at 301, 109 S.Ct. at 1070, 103 L.Ed.2d at 349.</p>\n<p id=\"b216-10\">The somewhat circuitous path, thus, brings us to the present dilemma: whether <em>Padilla </em>applies to Miller\u2019s 1999 plea colloquy and subsequent conviction given that the Supreme Court held <em>Padilla </em>would not have retroactive effect. We granted certiorari in this case to answer that question, but the State presents us with the preliminary question of whether we can even consider if Miller is entitled to relief because, by failing to file an application for leave to appeal from his guilty plea, Miller waived the right to file his coram nobis petition. Miller, however, contends that waiver does not bar consideration of his arguments before the trial court and on appeal, because, at the time of his guilty plea in 1999 he could not have anticipated that the Supreme Court would decide <em>Padilla.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b216-11\">\u201c[T]he waiver standards embodied in the Post Conviction [Procedure] Act\u201d apply to coram nobis proceedings, \u201c[therefore, the same body of law concerning waiver and final litigation of an issue, which is applicable under the Maryland Post Conviction Procedure Act ... [is] applicable to a coram nobis proceeding challenging a criminal conviction.\u201d <em>Holmes v. State, </em>401 Md. 429, 442, 454-55, 932 A.2d 698, 706, 714 (2007). The issue of waiver in the Post Conviction Procedure Act is governed by Section 7-106(b) of the Criminal Procedure <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"187\">*187</page-number>Article, Maryland Code (2001, 2008 Repl. Yol., 2012 Supp.), which provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b217-4\">(b) <em>Waiver of allegation of error. </em>\u2014 (l)(i) Except as provided in subparagraph (ii) of this paragraph, an allegation of error is waived when a petitioner could have made but intelligently and knowingly failed to make the allegation:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b217-5\">1. before trial;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b217-6\">2. at trial;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b217-7\">3. on direct appeal; whether or not the petitioner took an appeal,</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b217-8\">4. in an application for leave to appeal a conviction based on a guilty plea;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b217-9\">5. in a habeas corpus or coram nobis proceeding began by the petitioner;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b217-10\">6. in a prior petition under this subtitle; or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b217-11\">7. in any other proceeding that petitioner began.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b217-12\">(ii) 1.

During his guilty plea colloquy, Holmes had been informed of his right to file an application for leave to appeal to the Court of Special Appeals but did not do so. Twelve years later, Holmes was convicted of various drug charges and weapons offenses in the United States District Court for the District of Maryland and was classified as a \u201ccareer offender\u201d under the Federal Sentencing Guidelines, in part because of his 1992 conviction. In order to avoid being so classified, Holmes thereafter filed a coram nobis petition, seeking to vacate his 1992 guilty plea, alleging his plea was involuntary. We held that his failure to file an application for leave to appeal after being advised of that right during the guilty plea proceedings raised a \u201crebut-table presumption ... that he waived his right to challenge his conviction through a coram nobis proceeding\u201d <em>id. </em>at 475, 932 A.2d at 725, which could only be rebutted if Holmes could demonstrate \u201cspecial circumstances\u201d to excuse waiver, which he had not done. <em>Id. </em>at 473-75, 932 A.2d at 724-25.</p>\n<p id=\"b218-7\">Miller does not allege \u201cspecial circumstances,\u201d but argues, rather, that he did not waive his ability to argue that his plea was involuntary and his attorney was ineffective, because he could not have foreseen in 1999 that the Supreme Court would have decided <em>Padilla </em>in 2010. The Court of Special Appeals agreed with this argument, noting that \u201c[djuring the 30-day window in which to apply for leave to appeal, between June 1, 1999 and July 1, 1999, [Miller], of course, had no reason to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"189\">*189</page-number>anticipate the <em>Padilla v. Kentucky </em>decision that was eleven years in the future.\u201d <em>Miller, </em>196 Md.App. at 683, 11 A.3d at 354. We disagree because, although <em>Padilla </em>was not omnipresent in 1999, at the time of his conviction Miller could have raised the implications of his having not been informed of the adverse immigration consequences of his plea by the trial court and his attorney.</p>\n<p id=\"b219-5\">In 1996, Congress enacted the Illegal Immigration Reform and Immigrant Responsibility Act of 1996, Pub.L. No. 104-208, 110 Stat. 3009-546 (IIRIRA), effective date April 1, 1997. Prior to 1990, non-citizens convicted of certain crimes could avoid deportation if the sentencing judge made a judicial recommendation against deportation (JRAD), and until IIRIRA, the Attorney General of the United States could exercise his or her discretion to halt deportation.

Congress first circumscribed the JRAD provision in the 1952 Immigration and Nationality Act (INA), and in 1990 Congress entirely eliminated it, 104 Stat. 5050. In 1996, Congress also eliminated the Attorney General\u2019s authority to grant discretionary relief from deportation, 110 Stat. 3009-596, an authority that had been exercised to prevent the deportation of over 10,000 noncitizens during the 5-year period prior to 1996, <em>Immigration &amp; Naturalization Service v. St. Cyr, </em>533 U.S. 289, 296, 121 S.Ct. 2271, 150 L.Ed.2d 347 (2001). Under contemporary law, if a noncitizen has committed a removable offense after the 1996 effective date of these amendments, his removal is practically inevitable but for the possible exercise of limited remnants of equitable discretion vested in the Attorney General to cancel removal for noncitizens convicted of particular classes of offenses.

We shall, nonetheless, exercise our discretion to address Miller\u2019s contentions, because of the unique circumstances of this case: its long and circuitous history; the fact that when we granted Miller\u2019s second petition for certiorari, the Supreme Court had taken certiorari to decide in <em>Chaidez </em>if <em>Padilla </em>had retroactive application; and that before oral argument in the instant case, the Supreme Court in <em>Chaidez </em>held that <em>Padilla </em>did not apply retroactively. As a result, we will enter the fray in order to resolve an issue which begs for resolution after the Supreme Court\u2019s decision in <em>Chaidez, </em>which held, contrary to <em>Denisyuk, </em>that <em>Padilla </em>does not have retroactive effect.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b222-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"192\">*192</page-number>After exhausting state avenues for relief, an individual in custody after conviction on a state charge may file a federal habeas corpus petition in federal court pursuant to Section 2254(a) of Title 28 of the United States Code.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> In order to uphold the principles of federalism and comity between federal and state courts, retroactivity of Supreme Court rulings in federal courts considering a habeas petition is governed by the dictates of <em>Teague v.

The Minnesota Supreme Court concluded that it was bound to apply <em>Teague </em>in determining whether <em>Crawford </em>applied retroactively, and that under <em>Teague, Crawford </em>did not have retroactive effect. Subsequently, in <em>Whorton v.

The Court, nevertheless, considered in <em>Danforth </em>\u201cwhether <em>Teague </em>or any other federal rule of law <em>prohibited] </em>\u201d the Minnesota court from applying <em>Crawford </em>retroactively. <em>Id. </em>at 269, 128 S.Ct. at 1034, 169 L.Ed.2d at 864 (emphasis in original). The Supreme Court traced the history of its own retroactivity jurisprudence leading to <em>Teague </em>and concluded that its standards for retroactivity were intended \u201cto apply only to federal courts considering habeas corpus petitions challenging state-court criminal convictions,\u201d <em>id. </em>at 279, 128 S.Ct. at 1040, 169 L.Ed.2d at 871, therefore, <em>Teague </em>\u201cdoes not in any way limit the authority of a state court, when reviewing its own state criminal convictions, to provide a remedy for a violation that is deemed \u2018nonretroactive\u2019 under Teague.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 282, 128 S.Ct. at 1042, 169 L.Ed.2d at 872.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b224-5\">As we recognized in <em>Denisyuk, </em>422 Md. at 480 n. 8, 30 A.3d at 925 n. 8, we have never expressly adopted <em>Teague, </em>nor do we need to here. Certainly, were we to have adopted <em>Teague </em>as our standard, the resolution of this case would be facile and resolute. In the absence of the stewardship of <em>Teague, </em>though, retroactivity of <em>Padilla </em>really is <em>not </em>the issue, because, as a state court reviewing Miller\u2019s state criminal conviction, we could provide a state remedy for the violations that Miller asserts were one to have existed at that time. In so doing, however, we cannot create a federal remedy denied by the Supreme Court, but must explore whether there is a basis in state law to provide Miller a remedy, beyond that which would be afforded in federal court.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> Our analysis is informed <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"195\">*195</page-number>by two cases decided by the United States Supreme Court, <em>Arizona v.

Evans, </em>514 U.S. 1, 115 S.Ct. 1185, 131 L.Ed.2d 34 (1995), the Arizona Supreme Court upheld exclusion of evidence seized incident to an arrest pursuant to an arrest warrant that had been quashed seventeen days earlier, unbeknownst to the police officer conducting the search. The warrant remained active because of a clerical error in the court clerk\u2019s office, and the state trial court concluded suppression of the evidence was appropriate regardless of whether the police or the clerk\u2019s office was responsible for the clerical error. The United States Supreme Court reversed and held that the good-faith exception to the exclusionary rule applied, even though Evans, the Respondent, had argued that the Court lacked jurisdiction \u201cbecause the Arizona Supreme Court never passed upon the Fourth Amendment issue and instead based its decision on the Arizona good-faith statute ... an adequate and independent state ground,\u201d <em>id. </em>at 6-7, 115 S.Ct. at 1189, 131 L.Ed.2d at 41, or, in the alternative, the Court should remand the case to the state court for clarification of the grounds on which its decision rested. <em>Id. </em>at 7, 115 S.Ct. at 1189, 131 L.Ed.2d at 41.</p>\n<p id=\"b225-8\">The Court exercised jurisdiction, because the Arizona Supreme Court\u2019s holding rested on federal constitutional grounds over which the United States Supreme Court is hegemonic. In reversing the exclusion of the evidence based upon the good-faith exception, the Court explained that although state courts could provide greater protection under their own con<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"196\">*196</page-number>stitutional provisions, they could not contradict the Supreme Court\u2019s interpretation of the United States Constitution:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b226-5\">We believe that <em>Michigan v. Long </em>[, 463 U.S. 1032, 103 S.Ct. 3469, 77 L.Ed.2d 1201 (1983) ] properly serves its purpose and should not be disturbed. Under it, state courts are absolutely free to interpret state constitutional provisions to accord greater protection to individual rights than do similar provisions of the United States Constitution. They also are free to serve as experimental laboratories, in the sense that Justice Brand\u00e9is used that term in his dissenting opinion in <em>New State Ice Co. v. Liebmann, 285 </em>U.S. 262, 311, 52 S.Ct. 371, 386, 76 L.Ed. 747 (1932) (urging that the Court not impose federal constitutional restraints on the efforts of a State to \u201cserve as a laboratory\u201d). Under our decision today, the State of Arizona remains free to seek whatever solutions it chooses to problems of law enforcement posed by the advent of computerization. Indeed, it is freer to do so because it is disabused of its erroneous view of what the United States Constitution requires.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b226-6\">State courts, in appropriate cases, are not merely free to \u2014 they are bound to \u2014 interpret the United States Constitution. In doing so, they are <em>not </em>free from the final authority of this Court. This principle was enunciated in <em>Cohens v. Virginia, </em>19 U.S. (6 Wheat.) 264, 5 L.Ed. 257 (1821).... In <em>Minnesota v. National Tea Co., </em>309 U.S. 551, 60 S.Ct. 676, 84 L.Ed. 920 (1940), we recognized that our authority as final arbiter of the United States Constitution could be eroded by a lack of clarity in state-court decisions.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AY-\"><em>Id. </em>at 8-9, 115 S.Ct. at 1190, 131 L.Ed.2d at 42-43 (emphasis in original).</p>\n<p id=\"b226-9\">In <em>Davis v. United States, </em>564 U.S. -, 131 S.Ct. 2419, 180 L.Ed.2d 285 (2011), the Court addressed retroactivity as a jurisprudential principle and iterated that \u201c[rjetroactive application does not ... determine what \u2018appropriate remedy\u2019 (if any) the defendant should obtain.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at -, 131 S.Ct. at 2431, 180 L.Ed.2d at 298, citing <em>Powell v. Nevada, </em>511 U.S. 79, 84, 114 S.Ct. 1280, 1283, 128 L.Ed.2d 1 (1994). Rather, \u201c[rjemedy is a separate, analytically distinct issue.\u201d <em>Id., </em>citing <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"197\">*197</page-number><em>American Trucking Assn\u2019s, Inc. v.

We also derive that application of retroactivity principles in the absence of an express adoption of <em>Teague </em>does not answer the issue of whether there is a remedy or redress at all. Miller\u2019s allegations of violations, then, can only be redressed were we to find independent state bases for so doing, which we do not.</p>\n<p id=\"b227-6\">We need only to review the recent case of <em>Grandison v. State, </em>425 Md. 34, 38 A.3d 352 (2012), to illustrate these principles. After being sentenced to death for his role in two murders in 1983, Grandison, in 2006, tiled a motion to reopen a closed post-conviction proceeding in which he argued three pieces of evidence were admitted in violation of <em>Crawford v. Washington, </em>541 U.S. 36, 124 S.Ct. 1354, 158 L.Ed.2d 177 (2004) which, he argued, \u201cshould be applied retroactively to cover the happenings at his own trial.\u201d <em>Grandison, </em>425 Md. at 63, 38 A.3d at 369; an argument denied at the hearing before the post-conviction court. Before this Court, Grandison acknowledged that the United States Supreme Court in <em>Whorton v. Bockting, </em>549 U.S. 406, 127 S.Ct. 1173, 167 L.Ed.2d 1 (2007) had held that <em>Crawford </em>did not apply retroactively in federal post conviction proceedings but argued that, \u201cMaryland should exercise its power, recognized in <em>Danforth, </em>to retroactively apply the rule stated in <em>Crawford, </em>under Article 21 of the Maryland Declaration of Rights).]\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 64, 38 A.3d at 370. We refused, noting that the Sixth Amendment and Article 21 of the Maryland Declaration of Rights,<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> had <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"198\">*198</page-number>been construed <em>in pari materia </em>both before and after <em>Crawford </em>and we saw \u201cno reason to modify these precedents or depart from the Supreme Court\u2019s ruling in <em>Whorton </em>that <em>Crawford </em>is procedural and need not be applied retroactively.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 64-65, 38 A.3d at 370. In so ruling, we essentially found Article 21 did not provide an independent state constitutional basis for Grandison\u2019s argument to prohibit the introduction of evidence admitted after his conviction became final.</p>\n<p id=\"b228-5\">The issue before us in the instant case, thus, becomes whether Miller\u2019s claims of involuntariness or ineffective assistance of counsel resulting from his failure to be advised of the adverse immigration consequences of his plea had independent state bases in Maryland in 1999. When queried on this point at oral argument, Miller\u2019s counsel could not identify any such state bases for affording Miller relief, because there are none.</p>\n<p id=\"b228-6\">We had consistently recognized ineffective assistance of counsel claims prior to 1999 as governed by the Sixth Amendment rather than Article 21 and had never \u201coffer[ed] a plain statement that [our] references to federal law were \u2018being used only for the purposes of guidance, and did not themselves compel the result ... reached.\u2019 \u201d <em>Evans, </em>514 U.S. at 10, 115 S.Ct. at 1190-91, 131 L.Ed.2d at 43, quoting <em>Long, </em>463 U.S. at 1041, 103 S.Ct. at 3476, 77 L.Ed.2d at 1214.

Washington, </em>466 U.S. 668, 104 S.Ct. 2052, 80 L.Ed.2d 674 (1984) was decided this Court had never \u201cdistinguished between the right to counsel guaranteed by the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"199\">*199</page-number>Sixth Amendment ... and the right provided by Art. 21 of Maryland Declaration of Rights.\u201d <em>Harris v.

After <em>Strickland </em>was decided, moreover, we flatly stated that, \u201c[tjhere is no distinction between the right to counsel guaranteed by the Sixth Amendment and Art. 21 of the Maryland Declaration of Rights ...,\u201d <em>State v. Tichnell, </em>306 Md. 428, 440, 509 A.2d 1179, 1185 (1986), and had not wavered from that position prior to Miller\u2019s guilty plea. <em>See Perry v.

We, clearly, then, prior to Miller\u2019s guilty plea and conviction in 1999, had not articulated that Article 21 provided an independent state basis for finding counsel deficient based upon a failure to provide advice regarding adverse immigration consequences prior to or during guilty plea proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b229-5\">By 1999, moreover, even after we adopted Rule 4-242(e), which mandated a trial court inform a defendant of the possibility of adverse immigration consequences, we further articulated that the failure to so advise a defendant did \u201cnot itself mandate that the plea be declared invalid.\u201d The Rules Commentary acknowledged that the new Rule 4-242(e) did not overrule <em>Daley v.

By holding that there was no existing precedent as of the date Petitioner\u2019s conviction became final (September 1, 1999) that would have compelled or dictated a legal ruling that the failure to advise a criminal defendant about deportation consequences would constitute ineffective assistance of counsel, did the Court of Special <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"185\">*185</page-number>Appeals overstep its bounds, by disregarding settled precedent, in the form of <em>Denisyuk v. State, </em>where this Court, quite to the contrary, flatly held that the Supreme Court ruling in <em>Padilla v. Kentucky </em>applies retroactively to post conviction challenges of guilty pleas entered into after April 1, 1997?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b215-9\">2. Did the Court of Special Appeals err in holding that Petitioner could not in any event avail himself of this Court\u2019s holding in <em>Denisyuk, </em>because his claim for coram nobis relief was based exclusively on his assertion that his guilty plea was involuntary, and not that his trial counsel was ineffective?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b215-10\">3. Even arguendo if Petitioner did not assert a Sixth Amendment claim in his coram nobis petition, was his guilty plea entered into voluntarily, where he was not advised of certain immigration consequences, that is, placement in deportation proceedings, that would follow as a result of the plea?</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b215-11\">We also granted the State's Conditional Cross-Petition to answer the following question:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b215-12\">1. Did the Court of Special Appeals improperly consider Miller's claim regarding the denial of his petition for a writ of coram nobis on remand where Miller had waived the claim on which he sought relief and where Miller\u2019s claim was without merit in any event?</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b221-7\">.

Essentially, a non-citizen who had not been advised of adverse immigration consequences during a plea colloquy could seek redress in a state court for a violation of the United States Constitution, but could not do so in the United States District Court for the District of Maryland on an identical basis. That cannot be the answer when the United States Supreme Court is the final arbiter of federal law.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"10\">\n<p id=\"b227-7\">.

I agree with the result reached by the Majority opinion, but do not follow its reasoning \u2014 it says it is not applying the <em>Teague </em>standard for retroactivity, but is compelled to follow the result in <em>Chaidez, </em>which was based on the <em>Teague </em>standard. The Dissent points that out and states quite clearly that it believes a different standard set forth in this Court\u2019s <em>Daughtry </em>case should be applied. But I do not grasp the distinction that the Dissent makes between the <em>Daughtry </em>standard and the <em>Teague </em>standard in reference to this case, particularly in that the Dissent relies on Justice Sotomayor\u2019s dissent in <em>Chaidez </em>\u2014 a dissent that applied the <em>Teague </em>standard.</p>\n<p id=\"b230-9\">In the end, I find Justice Kagan\u2019s analysis for the <em>Chaidez </em>majority persuasive and would apply it here, whether one views it an application of the <em>Teague </em>standard or another standard that operates similarly. That brings me to the same place as the Majority.</p>\n<p id=\"b230-10\">BARBERA, C.J., GREENE, J., and BELL, C.J., (ret.) dissent.</p>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-4\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b230-11\">BARBERA, C.J.,</author>\n<p id=\"Agy\">dissenting, which GREENE, J., and BELL, C.J. (ret.), join.</p>\n<p id=\"b230-12\">Respectfully, I dissent. The issue before the Court essentially boils down to a single question: Does the Supreme Court\u2019s decision in <em>Chaidez v. United States, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 133 S.Ct. 1103, 185 L.Ed.2d 149 (2013), compel this Court to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"201\">*201</page-number>overrule its decision in <em>Denisyuk v. State, </em>422 Md. 462, 30 A.3d 914 (2011)? The majority concludes (without explicitly stating so) that the answer to this question is yes, while I, for reasons I shall explain, conclude that the answer is no. As this Court decided in <em>Denisyuk, </em>I would continue to apply retroactively the decision of the Supreme Court in <em>Padilla v. Kentucky, </em>559 U.S. 356, 130 S.Ct. 1473, 176 L.Ed.2d 284 (2010), to postconviction claims arising from guilty pleas obtained in Maryland state courts after April 1,1997.</p>\n<p id=\"b231-4\">As a preliminary matter, I note my agreement with the majority on two points. First, I agree with the majority\u2019s conclusion that the \u201cunique circumstances\u201d of Petitioner\u2019s case, among other factors, counsel in favor of considering his claims, even though Petitioner failed to file timely an application for leave to appeal from his 1999 guilty plea. <em>See </em>Maj. Op. at 191-92, 77 A.3d at 1040. Second, I agree with the majority\u2019s statement that \u201cwe have never expressly adopted <em>Teague [v. Lane, </em>489 U.S. 288, 109 S.Ct. 1060, 103 L.Ed.2d 334 (1989) ], nor do we need to here.\u201d<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Maj. Op. at 194, 77 A.3d at 1042. This statement is central to my conclusion that <em>Denis-yuk </em>was decided correctly and need not be altered in light of <em>Chaidez.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b231-5\">It is from here that I must part ways with my colleagues. The majority concludes that \u201cwe cannot create a federal remedy denied by the Supreme Court,\u201d Maj. Op. at 194, 77 A.3d at 1042, in part because, were the Court to do so, \u201cfederal constitutional law prior to 2010 would have two distinctly different applications in Maryland,\u201d depending on whether a case is filed in federal or state court. Maj. Op. at 194-95 n. 9, 77 A.3d at 1042 n. 9. The majority instead looks to whether there is an independent basis in state law to provide Petitioner with relief and concludes that there is not. <em>See </em>Maj. Op. at 197-98, 77 A.3d at 1043-44.</p>\n<p id=\"b231-6\">I would conclude otherwise. The first point raised by the majority, concerning the differing applications of the law <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"202\">*202</page-number>depending on whether a litigant is in state or federal court, is merely a byproduct of our federal system. As the Supreme Court itself has noted, \u201cthe substantive rights provided by the Federal Constitution define only a minimum. State law may recognize liberty interests more extensive than those independently protected by the Federal Constitution.\u201d <em>Mills v. Rogers, </em>457 U.S. 291, 300, 102 S.Ct. 2442, 73 L.Ed.2d 16 (1982). This principle necessarily means that, at times, a state\u2019s interpretation of the law will differ from that of the Supreme Court. This does not mean that we do not recognize the supremacy of the Supreme Court in interpreting federal law. But our federal system allows for this Court to recognize more expansive rights in matters of state law, even when that state law is influenced by past federal precedents.</p>\n<p id=\"b232-5\">This Court anticipated in <em>Denisyuk </em>that Maryland\u2019s jurisprudence in this area might in the future diverge from Supreme Court precedent. Even if we could not foresee the result exactly, we anticipated the possibility that the Supreme Court might issue a decision similar to <em>Chaidez. </em>Acknowledging this potential, we cited affirmatively the reasoning of our sister courts on the subject and stated the following:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AT9\">Thus, even if the Supreme Court ever were to hold that <em>Padilla </em>is not retroactive under <em>Teague, </em>that holding would have no adverse effect on our analysis here. Indeed, we cite and discuss these cases because we find persuasive, and subscribe to, the analysis these courts gave to the <em>Padilla </em>decision.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b232-6\">422 Md. at 480-81 n. 8, 30 A.3d 914.</p>\n<p id=\"b232-7\">This leads to the second significant point in the majority\u2019s reasoning with which I disagree. The majority presumes that Denisyuk\u2019s holding depended entirely on the federal interpretation of <em>Padilla </em>and concludes, in the wake of <em>Chaidez, </em>that there is no independent state basis to support such a retroactive application. What the majority overlooks is that Denis-yuk applied Maryland\u2019s retroactivity jurisprudence in concluding that Padilla should be applied retroactively. 422 Md. at 482.</p>\n<p id=\"b233-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"203\">*203</page-number>The retroactivity test laid out by this Court in cases, such as <em>State v. Daughtry, </em>419 Md. 35, 78, 18 A.3d 60 (2011) (quoting <em>Houghton v. County Comm\u2019rs of Kent County, </em>307 Md. 216, 220, 513 A.2d 291 (1986)), states that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"ALC\">the question of whether a particular judicial decision should be applied prospectively or retroactively, depends in the first instance on whether or not the decision overrules prior law and declares a new principle of law. If a decision does not ... no question of a \u201cprospective only\u201d application arises; the decision applies retroactively in the same manner as most court decisions.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b233-5\">I note that, under <em>Strickland v. Washington, </em>466 U.S. 668, 688, 104 S.Ct. 2052, 80 L.Ed.2d 674 (1984), the \u201cproper measure of attorney performance remains simply reasonableness under prevailing professional norms.\u201d Prior to <em>Chaidez, </em>the Supreme Court never held that an application of <em>Strickland </em>\u201cresulted in a new rule.\u201d \u2014 U.S. -, 133 S.Ct. 1103, 1114-15 (Sotomayor, J., dissenting). In fact, <em>\u201cPadilla </em>is built squarely on the foundation laid out by <em>Strickland.\u201d Id. </em>at 1115 (Sotomayor, J., dissenting). I believe that the result in <em>Padilla </em>\u201cfollowed naturally from ... changes in immigration law and the accompanying evolution of professional norms.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1116 (Sotomayor, J., dissenting). In <em>Denisyuk, </em>we found instructive the <em>Padilla </em>court\u2019s observation that \u201cprofessional norms\u201d for the previous 15 years \u201chave generally imposed an obligation on counsel to provide advice on the deportation consequences of a client\u2019s plea.\u201d <em>Denisyuk, </em>422 Md. at 481 (quoting <em>Padilla, </em>130 S.Ct. at 1485).</p>\n<p id=\"b233-8\">Under Maryland\u2019s retroactivity jurisprudence, <em>Padilla </em>did not overrule \u201cprior law\u201d and declare \u201ca new principle of law.\u201d Rather, it was an application of <em>Strickland </em>under a different set of facts. Reasonableness under the prevailing professional norms in June 1999, at the time Petitioner entered his plea, would have led a defense attorney to advise a client of potential immigration consequences.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b234-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"204\">*204</page-number>Additional support for the view that professional norms supported informing defendants of the potential immigration consequences of pleas can be found in the requirements of Maryland Rule 4-242(f)<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> and the discussion that led to its creation. Although this rule was not adopted until after Petitioner\u2019s plea in the present case,<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> the minutes of the April 24,1998, meeting of the Court of Appeals Standing Committee on Rules of Practice and Procedure reveal that attorneys at the time were aware of the severe changes that had occurred in the immigration landscape after 1996. One representative from the Hispanic Bar Association voiced concerns that the rule was \u201ctoo innocuous\u201d and might not \u201creflect the magnitude of the problems in light of the 1996 amendments to the immigration law.\u201d The language of the rule ultimately did not declare a plea invalid if a defendant was not informed of immigration consequences, but the discussion during the rules committee meeting indicates that attorneys, in 1998, were aware that attorneys and courts <em>should </em>be routinely providing <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"205\">*205</page-number>this warning.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> The language of the rule was modeled, in part, after language proposed by the American Bar Association. These factors support our assertion in <em>Denisyuk </em>that providing advice about the immigration consequences of a plea was a part of the professional norms expected of attorneys prior to the <em>Padilla </em>decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b235-5\">Our reasoning in <em>Denisyuk </em>was sound and this Court is not required to depart from it, nor should it. Under Maryland\u2019s retroactivity jurisprudence, I would continue to apply the <em>Padilla </em>decision to postconviction claims stemming from guilty pleas that were obtained in our state courts after April 1, 1997.</p>\n<p id=\"b235-6\">Judge GREENE and Chief Judge BELL (ret.) have authorized me to state that they join in the views expressed in this dissenting opinion.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b231-7\">. Indeed, as the Supreme Court has stated, \u201cthe <em>Teague </em>decision ... does not in any way limit the authority of a state court, when reviewing its own state criminal convictions, to provide a remedy for a violation that is deemed 'nonretroactive' under <em>Teague.\u201d Danforth v. Minnesota, 552 </em>U.S. 264, 282, 128 S.Ct. 1029, 169 L.Ed.2d 859 (2008).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b233-9\">. In <em>Denisyuk v. State, </em>we applied <em>Padilla </em>retroactively to \u201cthe time period following the 1996 amendments to federal immigration law that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"204\">*204</page-number>made deportation 'practically inevitable\u2019 for noncitizens convicted of removable offenses.\" 422 Md. 462, 468, 30 A.3d 914 (2011) (quoting <em>Padilla, </em>130 S.Ct. at 1480).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b234-6\">. The rule (previously located at 4-242(e)) states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b234-7\">(f) Collateral consequences of a plea of guilty, conditional plea of guilty, or plea of nolo contendere. Before the court accepts a plea of guilty, a conditional plea of guilty, or a plea of nolo contendere, the court, the State\u2019s Attorney, the attorney for the defendant, or any combination thereof shall advise the defendant (1) that by entering the plea, if the defendant is not a United States citizen, the defendant may face additional consequences of deportation, detention, or ineligibility for citizenship, (2) that by entering a plea to the offenses set out in Code, Criminal Procedure Article, \u00a7 11-701, the defendant shall have to register with the defendant\u2019s supervising authority as defined in Code, Criminal Procedure Article, \u00a7 ll-701(p), and (3) that the defendant should consult with defense counsel if the defendant is represented and needs additional information concerning the potential consequences of the plea. The omission of advice concerning the collateral consequences of a plea does not itself mandate that the plea be declared invalid.</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b234-8\">. We explicitly did not base our holding in <em>Denisyuk </em>on the rule, <em>see </em>422 Md. at 484 n. 9, 30 A.3d 914, but that does not mean that the rule, and the minutes of committee hearings that led to the rule, cannot inform our decision now.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b235-7\">. We summarized this discussion in <em>Denisyuk </em>as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b235-8\">Furthermore, as Petitioner points out, the minutes of the April 24, 1998, meeting of the Court of Appeals Standing Committee on Rules of Practice and Procedure reflect the intention of the drafters of Rule 4-242(e) to permit collateral challenges, based on ineffective assistance of counsel, to a plea that did not include on-the-record advice concerning immigration consequences:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b235-9\">The Vice Chair expressed her disagreement with the fact that if a judge fails to advise the defendant about the consequences of a guilty plea, no remedy exists, even if that defendant suffers dire consequences. Some other states provide that if the advice is not given, the plea can be invalidated. The Chair pointed out that there are two aspects to this. One is that the defendant can get postconviction relief based on inadequate advice of counsel. The Rule says that the guilty plea cannot be attacked, but does not preclude postconviction relief. U.S. citizens may not ask for their pleas to be set aside because the judge did not give the advice about immigration consequences. If a particular defendant is unfairly prejudiced, that defendant\u2019s right to competent defense counsel should cover this situation.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b235-10\">422 Md. at 484 n. 9, 30 A.3d 914.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
