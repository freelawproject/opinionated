McAULIFFE (Retired, Specially Assigned), J.</author>\n<p id=\"b305-13\">This case presents the question of whether a buyer of a property located within a homeowners association, who already owns other lots within the association, is considered a \u201cmember of the public\u201d required to receive mandatory disclosures pursuant to the Maryland Homeowners Association Act (\u201cThe Act\u201d).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> We are also asked to decide the related question of whether a buyer otherwise entitled to those disclosures may be estopped from relying on the protection of the Act if <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"276\">*276</page-number>he declines attempts by the seller to provide the required information, stating that he already has that information.</p>\n<p id=\"b306-4\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b306-5\">William A. Hurwitz (the buyer) entered into a contract on August 6, 2009, with Flora E. and Roger C. Lipitz, as trustees of the revocable property trust of Flora E. and Roger C. Lipitz (the sellers), to purchase a home in the Caves Valley Golf Club Development in Owings Mills, Maryland.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The buyer, who was represented in the sale by Krauss Real Property Brokerage, owned two other houses within the Caves Valley Golf Club Development and resided in one of them. The parties agreed to a sale price of approximately $4 million.</p>\n<p id=\"b306-6\">The written offer submitted by the buyer included two form addenda, the Maryland Homeowners Association Act Notice to Buyer and the Maryland Homeowners Association Act Disclosures to Buyer and Transmittal of Documents. After negotiations between the parties, they agreed to strike those documents from the contract, apparently because each party believed they were not applicable or could be waived. The bottom of the first page of the contract contains a handwritten note, which states \u201cSubject to Caves Valley Club declaration of covenants, easements, charges and liens.\u201d According to the sellers\u2019 complaint, they \u201cmade attempts to provide [the buyer] with information required by the Act,\u201d but \u201cMr. Hurwitz declined such information stating that he already had those materials.\u201d The sellers claim that both parties, although represented by licensed real estate brokers, believed that the Maryland Homeowners Association Act did not apply to the sale.</p>\n<p id=\"b307-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"277\">*277</page-number>Both parties signed the contract on August 6, 2009, and set the date of settlement for November 2, 2009. Based on this agreement, the sellers no longer sought alternative buyers for the property. The sellers contend that prior to the closing date the buyer was given access to the property to \u201ctake measurements and consult with interior designers\u201d; that the sellers also provided Mr. Hurwitz with a demonstration of the \u201celectronic amenities\u201d in the house; and that the buyer \u201crepeatedly conveyed his enthusiasm\u201d about the property, describing the uses to which he might put various rooms in the house and discussing how he might decorate them.</p>\n<p id=\"b307-5\">On November 1, 2009, the day before closing, the buyer\u2019s agent orally informed the sellers that the buyer would not be closing on the property. No reason was given at that time. The buyer\u2019s attorney later contacted the sellers on November 12, 2009, to inform them that, because the buyer had not received the disclosures required under the Maryland Homeowners Association Act, he was canceling the contract. The sellers also received a letter from the buyer, dated November 11, 2009, relaying the same information.</p>\n<p id=\"b307-6\">The sellers filed a complaint in the Circuit Court for Baltimore County on June 10, 2010, alleging breach of contract and seeking specific performance. They filed an amended complaint on November 9, 2010.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> The buyer filed a motion to dismiss the amended complaint on November 19, 2010, and the sellers filed a cross-motion for summary judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b307-7\">The Circuit Court held a hearing on the motions on March 29, 2011. At the hearing, the buyer argued that the sellers were required to provide the disclosures to him under \u00a7 11 B-106(b), and that the failure to provide those disclosures rendered the contract unenforceable and gave the buyer the right to cancel. He further argued that under the statute any attempted waiver of the right to receive the disclosures was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"278\">*278</page-number>void, thereby making any representations by him that he did not need the documents irrelevant.</p>\n<p id=\"b308-4\">During the hearing, the sellers conceded that they had not delivered to the buyer the disclosures specified by the Maryland Homeowners Association Act. The Act requires that notice be given to \u201ca member of the public who intends to occupy or rent the lot for residential purposes.\u201d \u00a7 11B-106(a). The sellers agreed that the buyer qualified as someone who intended to occupy the lot, but disagreed that he was a \u201cmember of the public\u201d under the statute. The sellers maintained that the General Assembly\u2019s intent in requiring disclosures was to ensure that people buying into a homeowners association were aware of the relevant applicable rules and policies. Based on this interpretation, the sellers argued that the General Assembly\u2019s use of the phrase \u201cmember of the public\u201d was designed to differentiate \u201cinsiders,\u201d i.e., those who already own property in a development and have access to the homeowners association policies, from \u201coutsiders,\u201d who are buying into the development for the first time and require protection. Thus, the sellers argued that this buyer, an insider, should not be considered a \u201cmember of the public.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"Ams\">As a fallback argument, the sellers contended that even if the buyer is properly considered a member of the public within the meaning of the Act, and therefore ordinarily entitled to the right to cancel the contract, he was in this case precluded from doing so by application of the doctrine of equitable estoppel because he affirmatively refused to receive the required documents and information proffered to him by the sellers.</p>\n<p id=\"b308-5\">The Circuit Court ruled orally on the motions, stating</p>\n<blockquote id=\"Aua\">Looking at the statute, I find it is clear and unambiguous. Starting with \u00a7 11B-I06(a), it says the contract is not enforceable unless the disclosures are given within 20 days of entering the contract, as provided in B.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b308-6\">Section 11 B-108(a) provides that a person who has not received all of the disclosures required is entitled to cancel the contract.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b309-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"279\">*279</page-number>Section 11 B-108(d) provides that, for the right to cancel, which may not be waived, an attempted waiver is void. Section 11 B-103 provides that the provisions of the Act may not be varied by agreement and again says that the rights may not be waived.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b309-5\">So the statute in two different sections says that the rights may not be waived under the Act.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b309-6\">With respect to the meaning of the term \u201cmembers of the public,\u201d I don\u2019t find that to be ambiguous at all. I think it means members of the public. Members of the public means members of the public.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b309-7\">And, again, applying the rule of statutory construction, to apply the ordinary and plain meaning of the language, I don\u2019t think it is all that complicated.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b309-8\">I find it does include Mr. Hurwitz. He\u2019s a member of the public. I think in this context or my interpretation is it refers to a human being, an individual, as opposed to a corporation.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b309-9\">And with respect to the equitable estoppel argument, I don\u2019t find any facts alleged in this case that would give rise to the application of the equitable estoppel argument. I think it boils down to the fact that the [sellers] don\u2019t like the statute and if somebody exercises their rights, it doesn\u2019t seem fair. That may be, but that\u2019s what the statute says.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AMt\">The Circuit Court granted the buyer\u2019s motion to dismiss and denied the sellers\u2019 motion for summary judgment. The Court of Special Appeals affirmed the judgment of the Circuit Court. <em>Lipitz v. Hurwitz, </em>207 Md.App. 206, 210, 52 A.3d 94 (2012).</p>\n<p id=\"b309-10\">We granted the sellers\u2019 petition for writ of certiorari to answer the following questions: <footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<blockquote id=\"b309-11\">1. Where a consumer protection statute grants to a \u201cmember of the public\u201d a right to cancel a contract to purchase <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"280\">*280</page-number>real property in a homeowners association development if certain information is not furnished to the purchaser, does the purchaser qualify as a \u201cmember of the public\u201d if he has continuously lived in the development for nine years and already possesses all the requisite information?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b310-5\">2. Should a court seek to avoid conclusions regarding statutory construction which are illogical or inconsistent with common sense, particularly where the court acknowledges its result is \u201charsh\u201d?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b310-6\">3. Where a statute grants a purchaser of realty a right of cancellation if he does not receive certain information, does the doctrine of equitable estoppel bar the purchaser from exercising that right if the purchaser not only possessed all the information but also affirmatively rejected the seller\u2019s offers to furnish him any information he requests?</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b310-7\">For reasons we shall explain further, we hold that the buyer was a \u201cmember of the public\u201d for purposes of the statute, but conclude that the Circuit Court erred by granting his motion to dismiss because the sellers have presented a justiciable issue of equitable estoppel.</p>\n<p id=\"b310-8\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b310-9\">The Maryland Homeowners Association Act applies to the sales of properties located within a homeowners association in the state. <em>See </em>\u00a7 11B-102. There are three sections that require sellers to make certain disclosures to buyers. <em>See </em>\u00a7\u00a7 11 B-105, 11B-106, 11B-107. Of particular relevance here is \u00a7 11B-106, which governs the resale of a lot within a development. In pertinent part, subsections (a) and (b) of that section provide as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b310-10\">(a) <em>Contract. </em>\u2014 A contract for the resale of a lot within a development, or for the initial sale of a lot within a development containing 12 or fewer lots, to a member of the public who intends to occupy or rent the lot for residential purposes, is not enforceable by the vendor unless:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b310-11\">(1) The purchaser is given, on or before entering into the contract for the sale of such lot, or within 20 calendar days <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"281\">*281</page-number>of entering into the contract, the disclosures set forth in subsection (b) of this section;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b311-5\">(2) The purchaser is given any changes in mandatory fees and payments exceeding 10 percent of the amount previously stated to exist and any other substantial and material amendment to the disclosures after they become known to the vendor;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b311-6\">(b) <em>Information to be supplied by vendor. </em>\u2014 The vendor shall provide the purchaser the following information in writing:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b311-7\">(1) A statement as to whether the lot is located within a development;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b311-8\">(2) (i) The current monthly fees or assessments imposed by the homeowners association upon the lot;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b311-9\">(ii) The total amount of fees, assessments, and other charges imposed by the homeowners association upon the lot during the prior fiscal year of the homeowners association; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b311-10\">(iii) A statement of whether any of the fees, assessments, or other charges against the lot are delinquent;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b311-11\">(3) The name, address, and telephone number of the management agent of the homeowners association, or other officer or agent authorized by the homeowners association to provide to members of the public, information regarding the homeowners association and the development, or a statement that no agent or officer is presently so authorized by the homeowners association;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b311-12\">(4) A statement as to whether the owner has actual knowledge of:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b311-13\">(i) The existence of any unsatisfied judgments or pending lawsuits against the homeowners association; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b311-14\">(ii) Any pending claims, covenant violations actions, or notices of default against the lot; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b311-16\">(5) A copy of:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b312-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"282\">*282</page-number>(i) The articles of incorporation, the declaration, and all recorded covenants and restrictions of the primary development, and of other related developments to the extent reasonably available, to which the purchaser shall become obligated on becoming an owner of the lot, including a statement that these obligations are enforceable against an owner\u2019s tenants, if applicable; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b312-5\">(ii) The bylaws and rules of the primary development, and of other related developments to the extent reasonably available, to which the purchaser shall become obligated on becoming an owner of the lot, including a statement that these obligations are enforceable against an owner and the owner\u2019s tenants, if applicable.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b312-6\">Section \u00a7 11B-I08(a) provides that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b312-7\">A person who enters into a contract as a purchaser but who has not received all of the disclosures required by \u00a7 11B-105, \u00a7 11B-106, or \u00a7 11B-107 of this title, as applicable, shall, prior to settlement, be entitled to cancel the contract and to the immediate return of deposits made on account of the contract.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b312-8\">The parties do not dispute the potential applicability of \u00a7 11 B-106 to this particular transaction. Rather, the parties disagree whether Mr. Hurwitz, the intended purchaser of the property, was a \u201cmember of the public\u201d under the statute. If he was, then the requirements of \u00a7 11 B-106(a) and (b) would have applied to the sale. The term \u201cmember of the public\u201d is not defined within the statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b312-9\">The sellers argue that this buyer is not a \u201cmember of the public\u201d under the statute because, at the time of the sale, he already lived in the development and possessed or had access to the necessary disclosures. They acknowledge that the Maryland Homeowners Association Act is \u201ca typical consumer protection statute\u201d intended to inform buyers of their responsibilities as members of a homeowners association.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> They <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"283\">*283</page-number>claim, however, that this buyer, as someone who already is aware of the disclosures and has the relevant materials, was not intended to be covered by the statute. The buyer disagrees, arguing that the plain language, context, and legislative history of the Act indicate that disclosures must be made to all individuals who purchase a lot for residential purposes. Moreover, the buyer contends that there is nothing in the Act itself that indicates purchasers such as himself should not be covered by its protections. To reach the sellers\u2019 interpretation, the buyer argues, \u201cthe Court must add language and rewrite the statute to include a new provision not found in the text.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b313-5\">The Court of Special Appeals concluded that nothing in the language of the Act indicated that this buyer should be excluded from its protection. <em>Lipitz, </em>207 Md.App. at 216-17, 52 A.3d 94. \u201c[Petitioners] urge us to make a distinction that simply does not exist in the statute,\u201d the Court stated. <em>Id. </em>at 217, 52 A.3d 94. The Court concluded that the purpose of the phrase \u201ca member of the public\u201d was to draw a distinction between a developer and an individual who intends to live in the home or rent it. <em>Id. </em>at 218, 52 A.3d 94. The Court observed that, in several places throughout the Act, the phrase \u201cwho intends to occupy for residential purposes\u201d was added after \u201ca member of the public\u201d to distinguish sales to individuals from sales to developers. <em>Id. </em>at 219, 52 A.3d 94.</p>\n<p id=\"b313-6\">In determining the meaning of \u201ca member of the public,\u201d we apply established rules of statutory construction. \u201cIn statutory interpretation, our primary goal is always to discern the legislative purpose, the ends to be accomplished, or the evils to be remedied by a particular provision....\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"284\">*284</page-number><em>Walker v. State, </em>432 Md. 587, 615, 69 A.3d 1066 (2013) (quoting <em>Lowery v. State, </em>430 Md. 477, 490, 61 A.3d 794 (2013)). \u201cWe begin our analysis by first looking to the normal, plain meaning of the language of the statute, reading the statute as a whole to ensure that no word, clause, sentence or phrase is rendered surplusage, superfluous, meaningless or nugatory.\u201d <em>Id. </em>If \u201cthe language is subject to more than one interpretation, it is ambiguous, and we endeavor to resolve that ambiguity by looking to the statute\u2019s legislative history, case law, statutory purpose, as well as the structure of the statute.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b314-4\">We begin by examining the plain meaning of the statute. The relevant language is as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b314-5\">A contract for the resale of a lot within a development, or for the initial sale of a lot within a development containing 12 or fewer lots, to <em>a member of the public </em>who intends to occupy or rent the lot for residential purposes, is not enforceable by the vendor unless ...</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b314-6\">\u00a7 11B-I06(a) (emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b314-7\">The phrase \u201ca member of the public\u201d is generally understood as referring to a broadly defined group of people. For instance, Black\u2019s Law Dictionary defines \u201cpublic\u201d as \u201c[t]he people of a nation or community as a whole.\u201d Black\u2019s Law Dictionary 1264 (8th ed.2004). A member of the public, then, would simply be a person who is part of a particular nation or community. The buyer similarly cites Webster\u2019s for a definition of \u201cmember\u201d as \u201cone of the individuals composing a group\u201d and \u201cpublic\u201d as \u201cof, relating to, or affecting all the people or the whole area of a nation or state.\u201d Webster\u2019s Ninth New Collegiate Dictionary 740, 952 (1986). Under this interpretation, a meeting that is \u201copen to members of the public\u201d would be generally understood to be open to anyone in a community who wished to attend.</p>\n<p id=\"b314-8\">One point is clear from examining the plain language of the statute: a plain reading does not lead one to conclude, as the sellers suggest, that the statute draws a distinction between buyers who are already members of the homeowners association and those who are not. If anything, a plain reading of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"285\">*285</page-number>phrase \u201ca member of the public\u201d would lead one to conclude that it is more inclusive, rather than less inclusive. <em>See Bowen v. City of Annapolis, </em>402 Md. 587, 614, 937 A.2d 242 (2007) (concluding that the plain meaning of the phrase \u201cany increase in the pay scale\u201d meant that retired police officers and firefighters were entitled to all of the same salary increases as active duty employees, no matter the source of the increase). A genuine ambiguity exists, however, when one questions whether the phrase \u201ca member of the public\u201d is meant to exclude any person or entity. It is for this reason that we do not rely solely on our understanding of the plain meaning of the statute, but will examine the context of the Act and its legislative history in order to discern the General Assembly\u2019s intent in using this particular phrase.</p>\n<p id=\"b315-5\">The parties ask us to consider other provisions of Title 11B that they claim shed further light on the matter. The sellers note that \u00a7 11B-107(a), which governs the initial sale of a lot that is not intended to be occupied or rented for residential purposes, uses the word \u201cperson,\u201d rather than \u201ca member of the public.\u201d They argue that the use of the word \u201cperson\u201d signifies that the provision applies to \u201ceveryone,\u201d while the use of \u201ca member of the public\u201d signals that some buyers are <em>not </em>members of the public. The sellers describe this distinction as the difference between \u201cinsiders\u201d and \u201coutsiders.\u201d They give the example of a club that is \u201cnot open to the public.\u201d Public does not mean any person, they contend, because the private club is open to <em>some </em>people; thus, the use of \u201cpublic\u201d in that sense means people who are not members of the club. The sellers analogize this example to that of Mr. Hurwitz, arguing that someone who already lives in a homeowners association is not \u201ca member of the public,\u201d but rather a member of the association.</p>\n<p id=\"b315-6\">Although we agree that there is a difference between \u201cperson\u201d and \u201ca member of the public,\u201d it does not necessarily follow that the sellers\u2019 interpretation of that difference is the correct one. Equally plausible is the difference that the Court of Special Appeals highlighted between an individual who intends to live in a development and a developer. <em>Lipitz, </em>207 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"286\">*286</page-number>Md.App. at 218, 52 A.3d 94. For this reason, comparing \u00a7 11B-106 and \u00a7 11B-107 does not lead us to the conclusion advanced by the sellers.</p>\n<p id=\"b316-5\">The buyer points to another section of the Act in support of his position, specifically \u00a7 HB-lll(l). That section, which governs meetings of a homeowners association, states that \u201call meetings of the homeowners association ... shall be open to all members of the homeowners association or their agents.\u201d \u00a7 llB-lll(l). The buyer cites this provision as evidence that the General Assembly used more specific language when it intended to, limiting meetings solely to members of a homeowners association, rather than allowing the meetings to be open to members of the public. Although he is correct that the General Assembly could have explicitly excluded members of a homeowners association from the disclosure requirements of the statute, the absence of this language is hardly dispositive, and more likely results from the absence of any necessity to specifically treat the rather rare occurrence of a homeowner in an association buying another home in the same association.</p>\n<p id=\"b316-6\">The General Assembly originally enacted the Maryland Homeowners Association Act in 1987.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> <em>See </em>Chapter 321 of the Acts of 1987. The Act had its genesis in the work of the Governor\u2019s Commission on Condominiums, Cooperatives, and Homeowners Associations.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> <em>See </em>General Assembly of Mary<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"287\">*287</page-number>land, Senate Judiciary Proceedings Committee, Summary of Committee Report on S.B. 96 (Feb. 17, 1987). The Senate committee report describes the purpose of the bill as requiring \u201cthe vendor of a lot in a development subject to a homeowners association to make certain disclosures to the buyer concerning the existence and authority of the homeowners association.\u201d <em>Id. </em>It further states that \u201c[t]he rights and obligations set forth in the bill may not be varied by agreement or waived.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Nowhere does the committee report discuss the implications for this requirement on buyers who already own homes within an association. An amendment to the bill, adopted in the Senate Judicial Proceedings Committee, added the phrase \u201cwho intends to occupy or rent the lot for residential purposes\u201d after the words \u201ca member of the public.\u201d <em>See </em>General Assembly of Maryland, Senate Judicial Proceedings Committee, Amendments to S.B. 96 (Feb. 17, 1987).</p>\n<p id=\"b317-5\">This change is explained, in part, by a February 5, 1987, letter, included in the bill file, from Roger D. Winston, the former chairman of the Subcommittee on Homeowners Associations for the Governor\u2019s Commission on Condominiums, Cooperatives, and Homeowners Associations, to Douglas Nestor, legal counsel to the House Judiciary Committee. In the letter, Mr. Winston offers several proposed changes to the bill, including adding the phrase \u201cwho intends to occupy or rent the lot for residential purposes\u201d after \u201cmember of the public.\u201d He explains that the language \u201cmember of the public\u201d was used to indicate that the disclosure requirements did <em>not </em>apply to developers. The pertinent part of the letter states</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AB9\">An amendment had been proposed last year, and has been proposed again this year, by Roger Redden, the purpose of which is to exempt from the disclosure requirements of Section 11B-105 the situation where one developer conveys an entire parcel of land to another developer. Last year the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"288\">*288</page-number>Subcommittee did not believe that this change was necessary because the existing introductory language to Section 11B-105 provides that the disclosure requirements set forth therein are only applicable to initial sales to members of the public. The \u201cinitial sale to member of the public\u201d language was derived from the Maryland Condominium Act where such language had been interpreted by the Secretary of State\u2019s office as excluding sales in bulk to other developers. However, Roger Redden expressed the concern that since the phrase \u201cto members of the public\u201d was not defined, it was possible that someone would interpret this as applying to all sales by developers, even sales to other developers. To alleviate this potential problem, I suggest that on Page 4 at Line 33, after the word \u201cpublic\u201d the phrase \u201cwho intends to occupy or rent the lot for residential purposes\u201d be inserted.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b318-5\">Although the letter concerns \u00a7 11B-105, the only difference between the two sections is the type of sale covered. Section 11B-105 covers an initial sale of a lot in a development containing more than 12 lots, whereas \u00a7 11B-106, at issue here, covers a contract for the resale of a lot within a development or the initial sale in a development with 12 or fewer lots. The language \u201cwho intends to occupy or rent the lot for residential purposes\u201d was added to both provisions.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b318-6\">Further evidence of the generally understood meaning of the disclosure requirements of the Act is provided by a 1987 opinion of the Attorney General of Maryland. 72 Md. Op. Atty. Gen. 158. \u201cThe evident intent of the provision is that a buyer be provided the facts that will allow the buyer to make a rational judgment about whether to contract for the particular house. This objective is satisfied so long as the buyer receives the required disclosures at a time when the buyer <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"289\">*289</page-number>still has an opportunity to decide whether to enter a binding contract.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 161. The opinion further states that \u201cthe seller has a duty to obtain and disclose to the buyer, prior to the formation of the contract, all of the information described in [the statute].\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 162.</p>\n<p id=\"b319-4\">The opinion specifically addresses a situation in which the buyer does not acknowledge receipt of the disclosures:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b319-5\">[Section] 11B-106 speaks of the seller\u2019s duty to \u201cgiv[e]\u201d or to \u201cprovide\u201d the buyer with the required information. [Section] 11B-107 is drafted in terms of the buyer\u2019s having \u201creceived\u201d the disclosures. The intent, apparently, is that the seller deliver the disclosures into the buyer\u2019s actual possession. If actual delivery is made, the statutory requirement will have been satisfied even if the buyer refuses to acknowledge receipt. However, a prudent seller ought to have some proof of delivery.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b319-6\"><em>Id. </em>at 163.</p>\n<p id=\"b319-7\">Considering the plain language of \u00a7 11B-106, its legislative history, and the surrounding provisions of the Act, we conclude that Mr. Hurwitz was a buyer who was protected by the Act\u2019s disclosure requirements. There is nothing in the plain language of the statute, or in the legislative history of the Act, that suggests lawmakers intended to exclude a person such as Mr. Hurwitz, a non-developer who already owned other lots in the development. The sellers\u2019 desired construction of the Act would require us to add language to the statute that is not already there, violating one of the cardinal rules of statutory interpretation. <em>See Gardner v. State, </em>420 Md. 1, 9, 20 A.3d 801 (2011) (quoting <em>State v. Johnson, </em>415 Md. 413, 421, 2 A.3d 368 (2010)) (\u201cWe neither add nor delete language so as to reflect an intent not evidenced in the plain and unambiguous language of the statute, and we do not construe a statute with forced or subtle interpretations that limit or extend its application.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b319-8\">The sellers argue that this result violates a separate canon of statutory construction, which requires that a \u201cstatute must be given a reasonable interpretation, not one that is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"290\">*290</page-number>absurd, illogical or incompatible -with common sense.\u201d <em>Walker, </em>432 Md. at 615-16, 69 A.3d 1066 (2013) (quoting <em>Green v. Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, </em>430 Md. 119, 135, 59 A.3d 1001 (2013)). They argue that this buyer, as a member of the homeowners association, would have already received all the necessary disclosures. They claim \u201cit is unreasonable to believe that the General Assembly intended to permit an \u2018insider\u2019 HOA member such as Hurwitz to cancel the contract simply because [the sellers] did not perform the perfunctory act of delivering him documents and information which he already possessed or to which he had ready access.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b320-5\">We conclude that the result reached by the Court of Special Appeals with respect to the meaning of the applicable statutes is not \u201cabsurd, illogical or incompatible with common sense.\u201d The law may be overinclusive, providing disclosures to buyers, such as Mr. Hurwitz, who might already be aware of much of the information contained therein. But that, in itself, is not an absurd result. As the Court of Special Appeals noted, \u201cthere are sound reasons why the Act should require a seller to provide disclosures even to a buyer who is already a member of the HOA.\u201d <em>Lipitz, </em>207 Md.App. at 223, 52 A.3d 94. These could include \u201c(1) if the buyer did not obtain the covenants when purchasing his previous home; (2) if the buyer did not use the previous lot for residential purposes; or (3) if the covenants and disclosures changed since the buyer last bought his previous home.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 224, 52 A.3d 94. The fact that these rationales might not apply in this buyer\u2019s case does not mean that the interpretation is otherwise absurd. \u201cThis policy avoids a situation where a buyer <em>thinks </em>he knows all of the information provided in the disclosures, but does not actually know this information.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 222, 52 A.3d 94. The law does not place the burden on a buyer to retrieve these disclosures, even if they are readily available to him.</p>\n<p id=\"b320-6\">The statute that is applicable here is cast in broad terms with the specific objective of providing meaningful protection to members of the public. We will not dilute that intended effect by adopting an interpretation that would engraft excep<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"291\">*291</page-number>tions not contemplated by a legislature clearly intent on providing expansive protections.</p>\n<p id=\"b321-4\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b321-5\">Our conclusion that Mr. Hurwitz was \u201ca member of the public\u201d who should have received the statutory disclosures does not resolve this case. The sellers assert equitable estoppel as a bar to the buyer\u2019s defense of their breach of contract claim. They allege in their amended complaint that they \u201cmade attempts to provide Mr. Hurwitz with information required by the Act,\u201d and that \u201cMr. Hurwitz declined such information stating that he already had those materials.\u201d Accordingly, the sellers contend that Mr. Hurwitz is estopped from arguing that he had a statutory right to cancel the contract because the disclosure documents were not provided to him. Mr. Hurwitz counters that equitable estoppel \u201ccannot be used to contradict the Act\u2019s express language that its rights cannot be waived, that its provisions cannot be varied by agreement, and that a seller cannot evade its requirements, limitations or prohibitions.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b321-6\">We first must consider whether equitable estoppel is applicable here. This Court has adopted the following definition of equitable estoppel:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b321-7\">Equitable estoppel is the effect of the voluntary conduct of a party whereby he is absolutely precluded both at law and in equity, from asserting rights which might perhaps have otherwise existed, either of property, of contract, or of remedy, as against another person, who has in good faith relied upon such conduct, and has been led thereby to change his position for the worse and who on his part acquires some corresponding right, either of property, of contract, or of remedy.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b321-8\"><em>Hill v. Cross Country Settlements, LLC, </em>402 Md. 281, 309, 936 A.2d 343 (2007) (quoting <em>Cunninghame v. Cunninghame, </em>364 Md. 266, 289, 772 A.2d 1188 (2001)). \u201cEquitable estoppel essentially consists of three elements: \u2018voluntary conduct or representation, reliance, and detriment.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>at 310, 936 A.2d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"292\">*292</page-number>343 (quoting <em>Mona Elec. Co. v. Shelton, </em>377 Md. 320, 334, 833 A.2d 527 (2003)). It is \u201ccognizable at common law either as a defense to a cause of action, or to avoid a defense.\u201d <em>Leonard v. Sav-A-Stop Servs., Inc., </em>289 Md. 204, 212, 424 A.2d 336 (1981) (quoting <em>Bitting v. Home Ins. Co., </em>161 Md. 56, 60, 155 A. 329 (1931)). In this case, the sellers are raising equitable estoppel to avoid a defense asserted by the buyer to their breach of contract claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b322-5\">In support of his argument, the buyer relies on several provisions in the statute. <em>See </em>\u00a7 11B-I08(d) (\u201cThe rights of a purchaser under this section may not be waived in the contract and any attempted waiver is void.\u201d); \u00a7 11B-I06(a) (the contract is \u201cnot enforceable by the vendor\u201d unless disclosure requirements are met); \u00a7 11B-103 (noting \u201cthe provisions of this title may not be varied by agreement, and rights conferred by this title may not be waived\u201d). Although waiver and estoppel may sometimes be used interchangeably, there are differences between these terms. <em>See Travelers Indem. Co. v. Nationwide Constr. Corp., </em>244 Md. 401, 413, 224 A.2d 285 (1966) (quoting <em>Gould v. Transamerican </em>Assoc., 224 Md. 285, 295, 167 A.2d 905 (1961)) (\u201cWaiver is closely inter-related and intertwined with estoppel. The distinction between them most frequently adverted to is that waiver rests upon the intention of the party, while estoppel rests upon a detrimental change of position induced by the acts or conduct of the party es-topped.\u201d); <em>Crane Co. v. Onley, </em>194 Md. 43, 50, 69 A.2d 903 (1949) (quoting <em>Benson v. Borden, </em>174 Md. 202, 219, 198 A. 419 (1938)) (noting that \u201cwaiver does not necessarily imply that one has been misled to his prejudice or into an altered position,\u201d whereas \u201cestoppel always involves this element\u201d). The difference between these doctrines convinces us that the statutory language does not expressly prevent estoppel from being raised.</p>\n<p id=\"b322-6\">A review of our past case law further leads us to conclude that equitable estoppel can be raised as a defense to a claim based on the disclosure requirements of \u00a7 11B-I06(b). On several occasions, we have applied equitable estoppel to cases involving defenses based on statutory requirements. <em>See </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"293\">*293</page-number><em>Cunninghame, </em>364 Md. at 300, 772 A.2d 1188 (describing factors to be considered in order to determine whether a personal representative of an estate can be estopped from asserting a statute of limitations defense on a claim); <em>Crane, </em>194 Md. at 50, 69 A.2d 903 (holding that the supplier to a contractor was estopped from asserting that a homeowner violated the Mechanic\u2019s Lien law by not paying the supplier for materials when the supplier told the homeowner to pay the contractor directly). Accordingly, we conclude that the sellers may assert equitable estoppel to counter the statutory defense raised by Mr. Hurwitz.</p>\n<p id=\"b323-4\">The buyer argues that even if the doctrine of equitable estoppel may be asserted, the sellers \u201ccould not satisfy its elements.\u201d The Court of Special Appeals agreed, concluding that as a matter of law the sellers could not have reasonably relied on the buyer\u2019s representations because the original offer from the buyer recited the requirement that the sellers provide the buyer with the disclosures and they should have been aware of their statutory burden to provide that information. <em>Lipitz, </em>207 Md.App. at 231, 52 A.3d 94.</p>\n<p id=\"b323-5\">We disagree, and we conclude that under the circumstances of this case, it is for the trier of fact to determine whether the buyer is equitably estopped from walking away from this contract. It is on this point that we part ways with our colleagues. We observe that this case was disposed of through the Circuit Court\u2019s granting of a motion to dismiss. \u201cIn reviewing a trial court\u2019s grant of a motion to dismiss, \u2018we accept all well-pled facts in the complaint, and reasonable inferences drawn from them, in a light most favorable to the non-moving party.\u2019 \u201d <em>Kendall v. Howard County, </em>431 Md. 590, 601, 66 A.3d 684 (2013) (quoting <em>Converge Servs. Group, LLC v. Curran, </em>383 Md. 462, 475, 860 A.2d 871 (2004)). \u201cWe then determine whether the trial court was \u2018legally correct in its decision to dismiss.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>at 601-02, 66 A.3d 684 (quoting <em>Washington Suburban Sanitary Comm\u2019n v. Phillips, </em>413 Md. 606, 618, 994 A.2d 411 (2010)).</p>\n<p id=\"b324-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"294\">*294</page-number>The complaint alleges that the buyer struck out a box on the contract that contained the words \u201cHomeowners Association Notice\u201d and wrote next to it, \u201cN.A.\u201d and his initials. The sellers allege that both sides in the sale believed that the Homeowners Association Act did not apply to the transaction. The buyer was given access to the property, including only a week before the settlement date, and \u201crepeatedly conveyed his enthusiasm\u201d to close on the deal. The sellers claim that they \u201cmade attempts to provide Mr. Hurwitz with information required by the Act\u201d and that \u201cMr. Hurwitz declined such information stating that he already had those materials.\u201d The sellers claim that, in reliance on Mr. Hurwitz\u2019s representations, they stopped seeking out potential purchasers of the property, and that they ultimately sold the property for less money than had been offered by Mr. Hurwitz.</p>\n<p id=\"b324-5\">We conclude that the Circuit Court erred by granting a motion to dismiss based on the facts alleged in the complaint. Genuine questions of fact are raised as to when, how often, and in what manner the sellers offered the disclosure documents to the buyer, and if, and in what way, he declined to receive the materials. We are not a fact-finding court and it is not our duty to determine exactly what took place between the parties. We conclude that the sellers have alleged sufficient facts on which to base an equitable estoppel argument and defeat a motion to dismiss.</p>\n<p id=\"b324-6\">JUDGMENT OF THE COURT OF SPECIAL APPEALS REVERSED; CASE REMANDED TO THAT COURT WITH DIRECTIONS TO REMAND THE CASE TO THE CIRCUIT COURT FOR BALTIMORE COUNTY FOR FURTHER PROCEEDINGS CONSISTENT WITH THIS OPINION.

We take note of this and other cases cited by the sellers, but these cases ultimately do not change our conclusion that the statute\u2019s plain meaning and legislative history provide sufficient support for our decision.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b316-7\">. According to documents within the bill file, the Act originally was to be enacted during the 1986 legislative session. During back-and-forth discussions among members of the House and Senate, two additional amendments were added to the bill. The bill, with amendments, passed in the House, but, because of confusion during the last day of session, did not pass in the Senate.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b316-8\">.

The fact that this language <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"287\">*287</page-number>is not repeated in other places raises doubts about whether the authors of the report intended their language to be read in that manner.

Another letter of note, dated February 10, 1987, from the Washington Metropolitan Chapter of the Community Associations Institute, states that the legislation would benefit not only the buyer, but the seller as well.
