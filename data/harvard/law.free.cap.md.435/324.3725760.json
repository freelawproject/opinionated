Hannan, </em>412 Md. 328, 345, 987 A.2d 60, 70 (2010). The issue this case presents is focused on the implementation of that intent.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> We must decide what the General <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"328\">*328</page-number>Assembly intended when it provided for an exception to revocation to be \u201cprovided in the will or decree,\u201d whether the pre-existing will or the subsequent decree must acknowledge, and then disavow, the effect of the subsequent divorce, or whether an inference, drawn from the will and the decree, suffices.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b358-5\">The facts necessary to resolve this case are straight-forward and largely undisputed. Jesse W. Suiters, the decedent, and Annie Lee Suiters, the respondent, were married in 1965. They separated in 1996, executing, on July 29, 1996, a Voluntary Separation Agreement and Property Settlement Agreement (\u201cseparation agreement\u201d). In addition to addressing the property settlement between the parties, the separation agreement addressed the parties\u2019 inheritance rights and provided for the agreement\u2019s future effect on any subsequent divorce proceedings. As to the former, Paragraph 11 provided:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b358-6\">\u201c11. <em>Release of Inheritance Rights. </em>Except as otherwise provided herein, each party waives all right, title, and interest in and to the estate of the other, of every nature <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"329\">*329</page-number>and description, including all right to administer same. Each party likewise waives all right to dower or courtesy, if any, in and to the property now owned by the other or property to be acquired in the future. Notwithstanding the mutual releases set forth in this paragraph, either party to this Agreement may, by his or her Last Will and Testament, give, devise or bequeath any part or all of his or her estate to the other.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b359-5\">Paragraph 17 dealt with the enforceability of the separation agreement. It provided:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b359-6\">\u201c17. <em>Incorporation. </em>With the approval of any court of competent jurisdiction in which any divorce proceedings may now be pending, or which may hereafter be instituted, this Agreement shall be incorporated in any decree of absolute divorce which may be passed by said Court. In the event the Court shall fail or decline to incorporate this Agreement or any provisions thereof in said decree, when and in that event the parties, for themselves and then-respective heirs, personal representatives and assigns, agree that they will, nevertheless, abide by and carry out all of the provisions thereof. It is further agreed that, regardless of whether said Agreement or any party thereof is incorporated in any such decree, the same shall not be merged in said decree; but said Agreement and all terms thereof shall continue to be binding upon the parties.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b359-7\">The parties were divorced by Decree of Absolute Divorce, entered May 25, 2006, in proceedings initiated by the respondent and in which the decedent did not appear. The decree incorporated, but did not merge, the separation agreement.</p>\n<p id=\"b359-8\">Almost three (3) years earlier, on June 18, 2003, the decedent executed his Last Will and Testament. As pertinent to this case, it provided:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b359-9\">\u201cAll the rest, residue and remainder of my estate and property, whether real, personal, or mixed, howsoever acquired and wheresoever situated, including any and all property with respect to which I have a power of appointment or power of disposition, I give, devise, and bequeath <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"330\">*330</page-number>unto Virginia Lee Suiters, if she survives me. In the event that Virginia Lee Suiters does not survive me or in the event that she shall die with me in, or as a result of, a common accident or common disaster, or shall die under circumstances which make it doubtful or uncertain as to whether she or I died first, or which make it difficult or impossible to determine which of us died first, then, in either of such events, I give, devise and bequeath all such residuary property to my sister Mary Ann Nichols, per stirpes and not per capita. If my sister, Mary Ann Nichols has predeceased me, then I give, devise, and bequeath that share equally to my nephews and nieces, Sam Nichols, Elaine Nichols and Nancy Nichols, per stirpes and not per capita.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b360-5\">The respondent had been designated personal representative and also as the decedent\u2019s attorney in fact by a Power of Attorney, executed by the decedent.</p>\n<p id=\"b360-6\">The decedent died shortly after the divorce and his will was admitted to probate. The central issue of those proceedings was the applicability of E <em>&amp; </em>T \u00a7 4-105(4). The Circuit Court for Wicomico County, after a hearing, held that the revocation by divorce provision did apply and that the exceptions did not apply,<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> resulting in the revocation of the provisions relating to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"331\">*331</page-number>the respondent. The Court of Special Appeals, in an unreported opinion, reversed the judgment of the Circuit Court, holding that the revocation of \u00a7 4-105(4) was not triggered because the exceptions it recognizes applied. It reasoned:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"Ah\">\u201cPursuant to the plain meaning of the words, \u201cunless otherwise provided in the ... decree,\u201d we believe that, as long as the decree provides language that shows the intent of the parties to provide for a legacy to a spouse regardless of their marital status, the exception to the revocation of a will by divorce or annulment under Section 4-105(4) has been invoked.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b361-5\">The petitioner filed a petition for writ of certiorari, which this Court granted. <em>Nichols v. Suiters, </em>420 Md. 81, 21 A.3d 1063 (2011). For the reasons that follow, we shall reverse the judgment of the intermediate appellate court.</p>\n<p id=\"b361-6\">The petitioner construes \u00a7 4-105(4) as providing a straightforward, bright-line standard: after the divorce of the testator and his or her spouse, all provisions in the testator\u2019s preexisting will automatically are revoked, in the absence of a provision in that will or in the decree of divorce, stating a contrary intent. Thus, as he sees it, \u201c[t]he intent of the Decedent is not relevant to the application of Section 4-105(4)....\u201d He argues:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b361-7\">\u201cThus, Section 4-105(4) of the Estates and trusts Article of the Maryland Code applies to revoke, as a matter of law, the provisions in the Will that benefit Suiters because the Will was executed prior to the divorce. This is true even though the Will was executed after the Separation Agreement but before the divorce. The only relevant facts to the applica<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"332\">*332</page-number>tion of Section 4-105(4) are the date of the divorce and the date of the execution of the Will. The date of the divorce is subsequent to the date of the execution of the Will, and therefore any provision benefitting Suiters was revoked by operation of law.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b362-5\">The petitioner relies on the pre-1990 version of \u00a7 2-508,<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> the Uniform Probate Code provision relating to the revocation of will provisions by divorce and cases interpreting the Uniform Probate Code provision or provisions patterned after, or similar, to it. <em>See, e.g., Friedman, </em>412 Md. 328, 987 A.2d 60 (2010);<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> <em>McGuire v. McGuire, </em>275 Ark. 432, 631 S.W.2d 12 (1982); <em>Papen v. Papen, </em>216 Va. 879, 224 S.E.2d 153 (1976); <em>Matter of Will of Reilly, </em>201 N.J.Super. 306, 493 A.2d 32 (1985); <em>Estate of Reeves, </em>233 Cal.App.3d 651, 284 Cal.Rptr. 650 (1991); <em>Matter of Estate of Rayman, </em>495 N.W.2d 241 (Minn.App.1993); <em>Matter of Estate of Knospe, </em>165 Misc.2d 45, 626 N.Y.S.2d 701 (N.Y.Sur.1995).</p>\n<p id=\"b362-6\">In any event, the petitioner maintains, citing <em>Gibboney v. Wachovia Bank, N.A., </em>174 N.C.App. 834, 622 S.E.2d 162, 164-65 (2005) and <em>Buchholz v. Storsve, </em>740 N.W.2d 107, 112 (S.D.2007), the exceptions set out in \u00a7 4-105(4) simply do not apply under the facts of this case. This is so, in the case of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"333\">*333</page-number>the will, he submits, because the will, in effect, does no more than merely name the respondent as a beneficiary. It does not \u201cmake reference to the fact that a subsequent divorce will not alter the spouse\u2019s status as a beneficiary under the will.\u201d With regard to the divorce decree, the petitioner argues that, because the separation agreement never became a part of the divorce decree, that exception also does not apply.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b363-5\">The respondent sees the case and the issue entirely differently. Noting that the language of the Maryland statute\u2014 \u201cunless otherwise provided in the will or decree\u201d \u2014 differs from that of the Uniform Probate Code \u2014 \u201cunless the will expressly provides otherwise\u201d<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> \u2014 and the cases on which the petitioner relies \u2014 e.g. \u201cunless otherwise specifically provided in the \u25a0will,\u201d <em>Gibboney, </em>622 S.E.2d at 164 \u2014 she argues that they have different meanings. While the revocation by divorce statute under the Uniform Probate Code may require it, \u201c[tjhere is no requirement under Maryland\u2019s revocation by divorce statute <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"334\">*334</page-number>... that, in order for a spousal legacy to remain effective after divorce, either the Will or the Decree contain \u2018magic words\u2019 providing so in an explicit manner.\u201d To impose such a requirement onto \u00a7 4-105(4), which she characterizes as unambiguous, the respondent submits, would be to add words to it and thereby alter and expand its plain meaning. She concludes that the General Assembly, by \u201cadopting] broader but no less unambiguous statutory language\u201d to that used in the Code provision, intended that the testator\u2019s wishes with regard to his divorced spouse \u201cbe construed from all, the language and provisions of the will and the decree.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b364-5\">The respondent believes, in any event, that both of the exceptions to revocation by divorce apply in this case. She argues that the testator \u201cotherwise provided in\u201d the divorce decree, explaining that the separation agreement, in particular paragraphs 11 and 17, was incorporated, but not merged in the decree, and thereby became a part of it, thus entitling her to benefit under the decedent\u2019s pre-existing will, notwithstanding their subsequent divorce. She continues:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b364-6\">\u201cIn other words, based on the clear intent of Jesse Suiters as expressed unequivocally in the Separation Agreement (specifically, his intent that the terms of the Separation Agreement survive any divorce that may thereafter occur, including its clear validation of the parties\u2019 testamentary bequests to one another, regardless of the status of their marriage) and the incorporation into the Decree of that expressed intent, his bequest to Virginia Suiters was not revoked by operation of law under \u00a7 4-105(4) of the Estates &amp; Trusts Article, when the Decree was entered.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b364-7\">That the will also \u201cotherwise provided\u201d was reflected, the respondent proffers, both in the decedent\u2019s designation of the respondent as his personal representative and in his naming her as his sole beneficiary and in the manner in which he did it. In the former case, in item 1 of the will, the designation was as his \u201cwife,\u201d while in the latter, in item 2 of the will, without characterizing the respondent as his wife, he stated simply the condition that she survive him.</p>\n<p id=\"b365-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"335\">*335</page-number>This is a matter involving statutory construction. Although we recently considered \u00a7 4-105(4), and construed one of its clauses, in <em>Friedman, </em>412 Md. at 345-46, 987 A.2d at 70, we have not had the occasion to construe it in the context of a spousal bequest. At issue in <em>Friedman </em>was the meaning of the term, \u201crelating to the divorced spouse,\u201d upon which the survival of bequests, contained in the decedent\u2019s will, which was made after the marriage but before the divorce, to the relatives of the decedent\u2019s spouse depended. We sustained the construction of the trial court, affirmed by the Court of Special Appeals, that the clause \u201crelated to the divorced spouse.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 344, 987 A.2d at 70. We concluded, in that regard, that \u201cit is permissible for an Orphans\u2019 Court or circuit court to find that a will provision is \u2018relating to\u2019 the former spouse within the meaning of Section 4-105(4) if it considers that the provision was primarily motivated by the marriage or given at the request of the spouse.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 345, 987 A.2d at 70.</p>\n<p id=\"b365-4\">In reaching that decision, we addressed the purpose of \u00a7 4-105(4) and made observations pertinent thereto, which, as we shall see, are instructive to the issue <em>sub judice:</em></p>\n<blockquote id=\"b365-5\">\u201cWe are not persuaded by Friedman\u2019s argument that the Circuit Court erroneously reversed the burden of proving that the gift to his wife\u2019s relatives was conditioned on the continuance of the marriage. We interpret ET Section 4-105(4) to be similar to a burden-shifting law. We conclude that in creating the automatic revocation of will provisions \u2018relating to\u2019 a former spouse, the General Assembly recognized two pertinent features of divorce. First, divorce usually results in a separation of assets that were jointly owned, thus reducing each spouse\u2019s assets available to bequeath to his or her own family. Second, divorce is often acrimonious, with the acrimony spilling over to the former spouse\u2019s family. Also, it is common in writing wills during a marriage that two spouses divide their assets between their respective family members because they have agreed that is fair. Even without acrimony, this viewpoint is likely to change upon divorce. In enacting Section 4-105(4), the Legislature created a remedy to avoid unintended conse<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"336\">*336</page-number>quences for people who neglect to change their wills upon divorce.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b366-5\"><em>Friedman, </em>412 Md. at 345, 987 A.2d at 70. As we shall also see, this is important to our resolution of this case, since prior to 1964 and the inclusion of the revocation by divorce provision at issue here, the statute governing the revocation of wills provided:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b366-6\">\u201cNo will in writing devising lands, tenements or hereditaments, or bequeathing any goods, chattels or personal property of any kind, as heretofore described nor any clause thereof, shall be revocable otherwise than by some other will or codicil in writing, or other writing declaring the same, or by burning, cancelling, tearing or obliterating the same, by the testator himself or in his presence, and by his direction and consent; but all devises and bequests so made shall remain and continue in force until the same be destroyed by burning, cancelling, tearing or obliterating the same by the testator or by his direction, in manner aforesaid, unless the same be altered by some other will or codicil in writing or other writing of the devisor signed as herein-before said in the presence of two or more witness declaring the same,\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b366-7\">Md.Code (1957, 1963 Cumulative Sup.) Art. 93 \u00a7 351, and, by its terms, as indicated, was the exclusive way to revoke a will.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b366-8\">Provisions similar to \u00a7 4-105(4), namely \u00a7 2-508<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> and statutes modeled after, or derived from, it, have been construed with uniformly consistent results. The courts construing <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"337\">*337</page-number>these statutes have concluded that their purpose is to reflect the reality that divorce is a significant and motivating factor in the testamentary decision-making of a testator, <em>Papen, </em>224 S.E.2d at 155 (\u201cIn enacting Code \u00a7 64.1 \u2014 59 the obvious purpose of the General Assembly was to incorporate into statute the presumed intent of a testator that any provision in his will for the benefit of his spouse be terminated in the event of their divorce.\u201d); <em>Matter of Bloomer\u2019s Estate, </em>620 S.W.2d 365, 367 (Mo.1981) (\u201cThe legislature decided that a divorce should wipe the slate clean as to the divorced spouse, without the testator having to go to the time and expense of making a new will. We can be sure that in almost every instance a divorced person does not desire a bequest to the former spouse to remain in effect. The legislature realized this, too, and wrote the statute to accomplish what was perceived to be the desired outcome in most divorces.\u201d); <em>Reilly, </em>493 A.2d at 33-34 (same); <em>Rayman, </em>495 N.W.2d at 243 (\u201cRegardless of the testator\u2019s relationship to the former spouse at the time of the will\u2019s execution, whether it is a friendly relationship years prior to the marriage or a marital relationship, a subsequent divorce is a significant change in circumstances between the testator and the former spouse.\u201d); <em>Reeves, </em>284 Cal.Rptr. at 654 (\u201cThe Legislature changed the law to protect a spouse who neglects to change his or her will following divorce or annulment.\u201d), and to prevent needless litigation and the necessity for complex and fact-based analysis of the decedent\u2019s intent. <em>Knospe, </em>626 N.Y.S.2d at 704. As to the latter, the Supreme Court of Iowa elaborated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b367-5\">\u201cThe clear purpose of [the Iowa revocation by divorce statute] is to provide an automatic revocation of provisions in a will in favor of a spouse after a marriage is dissolved. The legislature obviously recognized that due to the change in the family structure new moral duties and obligations may have evolved subsequent to the execution of the will, and that due to the turmoil of a dissolution an automatic revocation is in the best interest of the testator.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b367-6\"><em>Russell v. Johnston, </em>327 N.W.2d 226, 229 (Iowa 1982). Despite providing for an exception, <em>Knospe </em>characterized the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"338\">*338</page-number>effect of the revocation by divorce statute as \u201ca conclusive presumption, which by its nature is irrebuttable.\u201d 626 N.Y.S.2d at 704.</p>\n<p id=\"b368-5\">From these purposes, these courts concluded that the statutes were \u201cplain and unambiguous.\u201d <em>Davis v. Aringe, </em>292 Ark. 549, 731 S.W.2d 210, 212 (1987) (\u201c[T]o adopt [the residual legatee\u2019s] argument would require us to read language into [the statute] that simply is not there.\u201d); <em>Reilly, </em>493 A.2d at 35 (\u201cOn its face, the statute makes no such distinction.\u201d); <em>Bloomer, </em>620 S.W.2d at 367 (\u201c[W]e find that the language of the statute is plain and unambiguous and, therefore, requires no construction, liberal or otherwise.\u201d). <em>See Reeves, </em>284 Cal.Rptr. at 653-54; <em>In re Marriage of Duke, </em>549 N.E.2d 1096, 1100 (Ind.App.1990). The cases also concluded that, for the revocation by divorce statutes to be applicable, only the factors prescribed in the statute need be established, not the intent of the testator/decedent, <em>see Davis, </em>731 S.W.2d at 212; <em>Reilly, </em>493 A.2d at 36; <em>Reeves, 284 </em>Cal.Rptr. at 654; <em>Duke, </em>549 N.E.2d at 1100, and that the exception became applicable only if the will expressly so provides. <em>See Gibboney, </em>622 S.E.2d at 165 (construing \u201cunless otherwise <em>specifically </em>provided [dissolution of marriage by divorce] revokes <em>all provisions </em>in the will in favor of the testator\u2019s former spouse,\u201d to mean \u201cthat unless the testator expressly indicates in his will that even if he divorces his spouse she would remain a beneficiary, the former spouse is denied any testate disposition\u201d); <em>Buchholz, </em>740 N.W.2d at 112 (\u201cWe hereby interpret the statute to require that the governing instrument contain express terms referring to divorce, specifically stating that the beneficiary will remain as the designated beneficiary despite divorce.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b368-6\">The purpose of \u00a7 4-105(4), that we identified in <em>Friedman </em>is consistent with the purpose of \u00a7 2-508 and the statutes derived from it, as reflected in the cases construing them. That purpose, coupled with the observations we made in <em>Friedman </em>relative to the likely, perhaps, presumed, impact of divorce on testamentary dispositions, mirror the conclusion of the cases, <em>Reeves, </em>284 Cal.Rptr. at 654; <em>Bloomer, </em>620 S.W.2d. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"339\">*339</page-number>at 369, that the Legislature\u2019s intent was to protect a testator who neglects to change his or her will following divorce or annulment, and, thus, are consistent with, and support, the further conclusion that such protection is best achieved by an automatic revocation of the relevant provisions of the testator\u2019s pre-existing will. <em>Russell, </em>327 N.W.2d at 229. Given the identity of the purpose of \u00a7 2-508 of the Uniform Probate Code, and the statutes derived from it, and \u00a7 4-105(4), cases interpreting the former are, we believe, persuasive authority as to the meaning of the latter. <em>See Roach v.

That purpose is, as we explained in <em>Friedman, </em>412 Md. at 345, 987 A.2d at 70, \u201cto avoid unintended consequences for people who neglect to change their wills upon divorce.\u201d It is achieved by prescribing a clear and decisive rule that applies to will provisions that precede the divorce of the parties. Accordingly, we construe \u00a7 4-105(4) consistent with the construction given \u00a7 2-508 and the statutes derived from it by the courts that have considered them. Thus, we reiterate what we said in <em>Friedman, </em>that its effect is the immediate revocation of provisions in the preexisting will relating to the divorced spouse, 412 Md. at 345, 987 A.2d at 70, and we further hold that revocation is effective upon the occurrence of the triggering factor, the subsequent divorce, therein enumerated, unless there is \u201cprovided in\u201d the will or the decree a statement to the contrary, that the decedent intended the bequest even though they were divorced. This is necessary if the legislative purpose of avoiding unintended consequences, is to be realized; anything less would not ensure that the consequence of the divorce was foreseen and intended. That, as here, in the separation agreement, there is a general reference to the right of either spouse to make a bequest to the other in his or her will and a provision calling for the incorporation, but not merger, of the separation agreement into the decree of divorce and, in the will, the reference in the residuary clause to the respondent, without referencing her status, as \u201cwife,\u201d do not suffice as \u201cotherwise provided in the will or decree.\u201d While the collective effect may be to permit an inference as to the testator\u2019s intent, it does not establish that intent or even clearly and unequivocally state it.</p>\n<p id=\"b370-5\">To be sure, \u00a7 4-105(4) differs from the revocation by divorce provision of the Uniform Probate Code and those statutes modeled after it; unlike those statutes, it does not include the word \u201cexpressly,\u201d or similar language, in the exception clause. On that basis, the respondent argues that \u00a7 4-105(4) <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"341\">*341</page-number>must mean that something less is required to avoid the automatic revocation consequence than a clear and direct statement that the divorce did not change the testator\u2019s donative intent toward his or her former spouse. That also is the position of the Court of Special Appeals, which characterizes \u00a7 4-105(4) as materially different from the Uniform Probate Code model. In effect, notwithstanding that Maryland has not adopted the Uniform Probate Code, by accepting the construction given it by the courts that have considered it, the respondent and the intermediate appellate court seek to limit the General Assembly\u2019s legislative options as to the wording of its statutes and, as a result, this Court\u2019s interpretive options. We reject such an approach. While we shall give the revocation by divorce statutes adopted by our sister states the construction placed on them by their courts, <em>Roach, </em>327 Md. at 445, 610 A.2d at 757 (citing <em>Elmendorf v. Taylor, </em>10 Wheat. 152, 23 U.S. 152, 159-160, 6 L.Ed. 289, 292 (1825)), we do not accept that any such construction defines, or is decisive with regard to, the General Assembly\u2019s intent in enacting its revocation by divorce statute. We hold, therefore, given the intent we have identified, and the fact that, despite the difference in wording, our statute is not substantially different, that the difference in the wording of \u00a7 4-105(4) and the statutes modeled after the Uniform Probate Code does not require that they have different meanings.</p>\n<p id=\"b371-4\">\n<em>JUDGMENT OF THE COURT OF SPECIAL APPEALS REVERSED.

Storsve, </em>740 N.W.2d 107, 111 (S.D.2007) (determining that South Dakota Codified Laws Section 29A-2-804 (1995) adopted UPC Section 2-508); 1995 South Dakota Laws, Chapter 167 (adopting the Uniform Probate Code in its entirety).</p>\n<p id=\"b376-6\">In the other cases upon which the majority also relies, the respective state legislatures adopted the language of UPC Section 2-508 in provisions mandating revocation upon divorce. <em>In re Reilly, </em>201 N.J.Super. 306, 493 A.2d 32, 33 (1985), citing <em>In re Bloomer, </em>620 S.W.2d 365 (Mo.Sup.Ct.1981) (noting that New Jersey Statutes Section 3B:3-14 (1977) and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"347\">*347</page-number>Missouri Revised Statutes Section 474.420 (1978) replicated UPC Section 2-508, which requires an express statement); <em>In re Reeves, </em>233 Cal.App.3d 651, 284 Cal.Rptr. 650, 653 (1991) (noting that California Probate Code Section 6122 (1991) is the same in substance as UPC Section 2-508, which requires intent contrary to revocation must be expressly provided); <em>In re Knospe, </em>165 Misc.2d 45, 626 N.Y.S.2d 701, 704 (N.Y.Surr.Ct.1995) (emphasizing that New York Estates, Powers and Trusts Section 5-1.4 (1979) was patterned on UPC Section 2-508 and determining, therefore, that express terms were required); <em>Papen v. Papen, </em>216 Va. 879, 224 S.E.2d 153 (1976) (interpreting Virginia Code Section 64.1-59 (1968, 1973 RepLVol.), which mirrors the language of UPC Section 2-508 with only slight variations in word placement).<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b377-5\">Rather, Section 4-105(4) only requires \u201cunless otherwise provided.\u201d In cases in which we have interpreted similar language in other circumstances, we have interpreted \u201cunless otherwise provided,\u201d as requiring only a manifestation of intent. Clearly, a testator\u2019s intent is a fact-based inquiry especially when the phrase \u201cotherwise provided\u201d is the applicable language. <em>See, e.g., Friedman, </em>412 Md. at 339, 987 A.2d at 67 (providing that a determination of the decedent\u2019s intent is a \u201cfact-based inquiry,\u201d when interpreting whether a particular bequest was \u201crelated to\u201d a former spouse under the broad language of Section 4-105(4)). In our inquiry, we consider the language of the bequest and may also consider \u201cthe situation of the testator\u201d as well as \u201cthe relationships between the testator and his beneficiaries\u201d to devise intent. <em>Id. </em>at 340, 344, 987 A.2d at 67, 70, citing <em>Robinson v. Mercantile Trust Co. of Balt., </em>180 Md. 336, 339, 24 A.2d 299, 300 (1942).</p>\n<p id=\"b377-6\">In <em>Pfeufer v. Cyphers, </em>we considered \u201cotherwise provided\u201d in a bequest as it applied to Section 11-109 of the Estates and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"348\">*348</page-number>Trusts Article, Maryland Code (1974)<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> providing that, \u201c[the federal and state] tax shall be apportioned among all persons interested in the estate ... [e]xcept as otherwise provided in the will, or other controlling instrument----\u201d 397 Md. 643, 650 n. 6, 651, 919 A.2d 641, 645 n. 6, 646 (2007). We discerned that despite the fact that Section 7-203(b)(2) of the Tax-General Article, Maryland Code (1988, 2004 Repl.Vol.) exempted three of the four residuary beneficiaries from paying inheritance tax, the testator had designated that inheritance tax should be paid prior to apportionment, therefore being sufficiently \u201cotherwise provided,\u201d because of \u201cthe supremacy of the intention of the testator or testatrix, as reflected in the language of the will....\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 650-51, 919 A.2d at 646, citing <em>Johnson v. Hall, </em>283 Md. 644, 648, 392 A.2d 1103, 1106 (1978).</p>\n<p id=\"b378-6\">In the present case, Jesse and Virginia Suiters agreed to separate under express terms that permitted either to bequeath property to the other, which Jesse, upon death, exercised in his will to Virginia, without attributing his bequest to \u201cwife.\u201d As a result, I would hold that his bequest was not revoked by operation of law under Section 4-105(4) because he otherwise had provided for Virginia as an individual, rather than as his wife. I would, therefore, have affirmed the Court of Special Appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b378-7\">Judges HARRELL and ELDRIDGE authorize me to state that they join in this dissenting opinion.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b372-10\">. All references to Section 4-105(4) are to Section 4-105(4) of the Estates and Trusts Article, Maryland Code (1974, 2001 Repl.Vol.) in effect at the time of Jesse\u2019s death in 2006, unless otherwise noted.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b375-10\">.

Hannan, </em>we recognized \"that the Henderson Commission was aware of the UPC, or that it considered itself free of any duty to recommend the UPC provisions to the General Assembly.\u201d 412 Md. 328, 348, 987 A.2d 60, 72 (2010).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b377-7\">. The only case that the majority cites in which the Uniform Probate Code may not be implicated is <em>Gibboney v. Wachovia Bank, N.A., </em>in which the testator bequeathed property to his wife without any delineation of her name. This case is clearly inapposite, where Virginia was identified by her name, only, without appellation as wife. 174 N.C.App. 834, 622 S.E.2d 162, 164 (2005).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b378-8\">.
