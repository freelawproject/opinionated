Linda Smalls (\u201cSmalls\u201d) retained Davy to institute an employment discrimination action against her former employer. Bobby McAdams (\u201cMcAdams\u201d), a jeweler doing business as \u2018Watch Tune Up, Inc.\u201d (Watch Tune Up\u201d), retained Davy to represent him and his business as both filed for bankruptcy. Both Smalls and McAdams filed complaints against Davy with the Attorney Grievance Commission of Maryland (\u201cthe Commission\u201d), Petitioner.</p>\n<p id=\"b712-11\">On February 22, 2011, in this Court, the Commission filed a \u201cPetition for Disciplinary or Remedial Action\u201d against Davy, charging her with violating the following Maryland Lawyers\u2019 Rules of Professional Conduct (\u201cMLRPC\u201d): 1.1 (Competence), 1.2 (Scope of Representation and Allocation of Authority Between Client and Lawyer), 1.3 (Diligence), 1.4 (Communication), 1.5 (Fees), 1.15 (Safekeeping Property), 1.16 (Declining or Terminating Representation), and 8.4 (Misconduct). On February 28, 2011, this Court referred the case to the Honorable Beverly J. Woodard (\u201cthe hearing judge\u201d) of the Circuit Court for Prince George\u2019s County (\u201cthe circuit court\u201d). On May 8 and 9, 2012, the hearing judge conducted a hearing. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"683\">*683</page-number>On December 21, 2012, the hearing judge filed, in this Court, an opinion including findings of fact and concluding that, in her representation of Smalls, McAdams, and Watch Tune Up, Davy had violated MLRPC 1.1, 1.2(a), 1.3, 1.4, 1.5(a), 1.5(b), 1.15(c), 1.16(d), 8.4(c), and 8.4(d).</p>\n<p id=\"b713-4\">On September 4, 2013, we heard oral argument. On September 5, 2013, in a per curiam order, we disbarred Davy. <em>See Attorney Grievance Comm\u2019n v. Davy, </em>434 Md. 246, 74 A.3d 727 (2013). We now explain the reasons for Davy\u2019s disbarment.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b713-5\">I. Hearing Judge\u2019s Findings of Fact</p>\n<p id=\"b713-6\">In a comprehensive forty-five page opinion, the hearing judge found the following facts, which we summarize.</p>\n<p id=\"b713-7\">On June 5, 1996, this Court admitted Davy to the Bar of Maryland. On September 8, 2003, with her consent, this Court indefinitely suspended Davy from the Bar of Maryland. <em>See Attorney Grievance Comm\u2019n v. Hamilton, </em>377 Md. 54, 832 A.2d 170 (2003).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> In <em>Hamilton, id., </em>377 Md. 54, 832 A.2d 170, this Court permitted Davy to apply for reinstatement after one year, and ordered that, before applying for reinstatement, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"684\">*684</page-number>Davy both \u201crefund all fees paid to her by [seven] individuals\u201d and \u201cobtain a physical/psychological evaluation demonstrating her fitness to practice law[J\u201d On December 7, 2004, this Court reinstated Davy to the Bar of Maryland. <em>See In re Petition for Reinstatement of Hamilton, </em>384 Md. 156, 862 A.2d 992 (2004).</p>\n<p id=\"b714-4\">In May 2008, Davy became a solo practitioner. At the time of her alleged misconduct, Davy\u2019s office was in Prince George\u2019s County, Maryland.</p>\n<p id=\"b714-5\">A. Davy\u2019s Representation of Smalls</p>\n<p id=\"b714-6\">From 2002 through 2007, Smalls worked as a civil servant in the Office of the Administration of the Executive Office of the President. In 2007, Smalls\u2019s employment with the office ended. As a result, Smalls filed multiple complaints with the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission, which issued Smalls a \u201cright to sue\u201d letter that imposed a deadline of November 6, 2009, for the lawsuit.</p>\n<p id=\"b714-7\">On or about October 20, 2009, Smalls contacted Davy through Davy\u2019s website. On or about October 23, 2009, Davy telephoned and spoke with Smalls, who sought legal advice about the termination of her employment. Smalls told Davy that a lawsuit would need to be filed no later than November 6, 2009. Davy told Smalls that she would represent her for a charge of $200 per hour, and that she would need a retainer of between $2,500 and $3,000.</p>\n<p id=\"b714-8\">On October 26, 2009, Smalls brought a check in the amount of $3,000 to Davy\u2019s office. At that time, Davy told Smalls that she wanted an additional $2,000. Smalls gave Davy the check for $3,000 and agreed to allow $2,000 to be charged to her credit card. Although Davy knew that she had not yet earned $5,000, she never deposited any of Smalls\u2019s payments into a client trust account. Before the hearing judge, Davy stated that she did not deposit Smalls\u2019s payments into a client trust account because, at the time that she began representing Smalls, she had been corresponding with the Commission, pursuant to a conditional diversion agreement, about a prior <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"685\">*685</page-number>complaint concerning the written retainer agreement format that she had been using.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b715-5\">After receiving Smalls\u2019s check and credit card information, Davy told Smalls that she wanted a $20,000 retainer. Smalls requested a payment plan. Davy agreed to let Smalls use a payment plan, but did not tell Smalls when she would have to make payments. Davy did not tell Smalls: (1) how she would use the $5,000 in payments; (2) how much she would charge in total for the representation; or (3) anything about a client trust account. Davy and Smalls agreed to meet again on November 4, 2009, by which date Davy promised to have a complaint ready.</p>\n<p id=\"b715-6\">On November 4, 2009, Davy and Smalls met. Davy did not have the complaint or the written retainer agreement. During the meeting, Davy said something to the effect of: \u201cMamma\u2019s got to eat, so you\u2019re [ ] going to have to pay this kind of money.\u201d Smalls became emotional and started to leave the room, but Davy stopped her and promised that the complaint would be ready within a couple of hours.</p>\n<p id=\"b715-7\">Two days later, on November 6, 2009, at 2:53 a.m., Davy emailed Smalls a copy of the complaint. At 9:25 a.m., Smalls emailed Davy, stating that the complaint was acceptable. At 9:11 p.m., Davy left the complaint in the box for after-hours filings at the United States District Court for the District of Columbia (\u201cthe federal court\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b715-8\">On November 9, 2009, Davy met with Smalls and gave her a written retainer agreement, under which Davy was entitled to a $5,000 retainer, a $250 \u201cnonrefundable consultation fee,\u201d and a $500 \u201cnonrefundable engagement fee.\u201d Before then, Davy had not told Smalls about either of the nonrefundable fees. The written retainer agreement did not: (1) state that its terms were retroactive; (2) refer to the $5,000 that Smalls had <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"686\">*686</page-number>already paid; (3) include details of a payment plan; or (4) state that the retainer would be $20,000. The hearing judge found that, in the written retainer agreement with Smalls, Davy intentionally failed to state that the retainer would be $20,000 because the $20,000 retainer might have discouraged Smalls from hiring Davy. Although the written retainer agreement stated that the retainer would not be deposited into a client trust account, Davy never pointed out the provision or orally informed Smalls about client trust accounts.</p>\n<p id=\"b716-4\">On November 9, 2009, Smalls paid Davy another $5,000. Davy gave Smalls a receipt that reflected a $350 filing fee. Smalls asked Davy for the case number, which Davy promised to provide; Davy, however, made no effort to learn the case number.</p>\n<p id=\"b716-5\">On November 13, 2009, the federal court mailed Davy the check for the $350 filing fee, along with an explanation that the federal court had rejected the complaint for filing, as Davy had failed to renew her membership in the federal court\u2019s bar and to include a civil cover sheet, summons, and disc with the complaint. On November 18, 2009, the United States Postal Service forwarded the mailing to Davy\u2019s address at the time, as Davy no longer lived at the address to which the federal court had sent the mailing.</p>\n<p id=\"b716-6\">On November 23, 2009, Davy e-mailed Smalls, stating that <em>\u201cwe </em>have been working on billing statementsf,]\u201d which she would provide \u201cmomentarily,\u201d and asking when Smalls would replenish her account. Smalls e-mailed Davy, stating that she would make another payment by November 29, 2009, and asking whether a summons had been served in the case. Before the hearing judge, Davy stated that Smalls did not deserve a prompt answer to her question about the summons because Smalls had not made additional payments.</p>\n<p id=\"b716-7\">On November 24, 2009, Davy telephoned the federal court and spoke with three people about the rejection of the complaint. As of that day, if not before, Davy knew that the federal court had rejected the complaint for filing and not issued a summons. Nonetheless, on that day, Davy e-mailed <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"687\">*687</page-number>Smalls, stating: \u201c[W]e will check with the process servers and follow up on their progress and give you a report.\u201d On November 25, 2009, Davy e-mailed Smalls, stating she had followed up with the process server, but that \u201cwe have not yet been able to serve the complaint quite yet because the court still has to issue the summons!.] It normally takes several days for the summons to be issued; I also contacted the court to follow up and we will keep you apprised on the progress.\u201d In her e-mail, Davy did not mention that the federal court had rejected the complaint for filing; instead, Davy wrote that \u201cthe complaint was filed on time!.]\u201d The hearing judge found that Davy intentionally failed to inform Smalls about the federal court\u2019s rejection of the complaint for filing because Davy wanted \u201cto mislead Smalls as to the quality of her representation.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b717-4\">On November 30, 2009, after having been explicitly advised, several days earlier, of the complaint\u2019s rejection, Davy emailed Smalls, stating that, if Smalls wanted the representation to continue, she would need to provide a check or her credit card information.</p>\n<p id=\"b717-5\">On December 1, 2009, Davy e-mailed Smalls, stating that she had filed the complaint and Smalls had yet to pay the $350 filing fee \u2014 even though Smalls had paid the $350 filing fee according to the receipt that Davy had given Smalls on November 9, 2009. On December 2, 2009, Davy e-mailed Smalls a request to replenish the retainer and a billing statement, according to which $350 in costs \u201chad been received.\u201d Ironically, the billing statement included a charge for Davy\u2019s telephone call to the federal court on November 24, 2009 \u2014 the call during which she had been advised of the complaint\u2019s rejection. Davy also charged fees for such administrative acts as preparing billing statements, even though Davy never explained the administrative fees to Smalls, who never consented to the administrative fees.</p>\n<p id=\"b717-6\">On December 2 or 3, 2009, Smalls visited the federal court, and was told that there was no case pending in her name. On December 3, 2009, Smalls e-mailed Davy, stating that she did <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"688\">*688</page-number>not believe that Davy had filed the complaint on November 6, 2009, that Davy had breached their contract, and that, if Davy did not refund the $10,000 that she had paid by December 7, 2009, she would take \u201cappropriate action.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b718-4\">On December 4, 2009, Davy e-mailed Smalls, stating that: (1) she had followed up on Smalls\u2019s claims and discovered a \u201ctechnical error\u201d; (2) she would correct the filing problem at no charge; (3) the federal court had \u201cadvised [Davy] that [Smalls\u2019s] case [would] be perfected as of the date filed\u201d; and (4) she would refund the unearned portion of the retainer as soon as possible.</p>\n<p id=\"b718-5\">On the same day, Davy filed in the federal court a \u201cMotion for Appropriate Relief <em>Nunc Pro Tunc,\u201d </em>in which Davy requested that the federal court \u201crelieve [Smalls] of the impact of the honest technical mistakes of [Davy], and deem the complaint ... filed <em>nunc pro tunc </em>as of the original filing date, November 6, 2009.\u201d The hearing judge found that Davy filed the motion for financial <em>reasons </em>\u2014 i.e., so that Davy could continue to demand payments from Smalls.</p>\n<p id=\"b718-6\">On December 15, 2009, Davy e-mailed Smalls, stating: \u201cI still want to do the case if you want me to, so let me know if you are ready to replenish your account and have us proceed, or not.\u201d On December 21, 2009, Davy e-mailed Smalls, stating that, if Smalls wanted the lawsuit to continue, she would need to \u201ccomply with the retainer agreement or hire another attorney at once.\u201d On that day, Smalls e-mailed Davy, stating that she still wanted a refund of the $10,000 that she had paid, and that she intended to file a complaint against Davy. On December 22, 2009, Davy e-mailed Smalls, stating that, because Smalls no longer wanted the representation to continue, she would withdraw her appearance and do nothing further on Smalls\u2019s behalf.</p>\n<p id=\"b718-7\">On January 6, 2010, Smalls filed a complaint against Davy with the Commission. On or about January 30, 2010, Smalls\u2019s credit card company refunded the $2,000 that Smalls had charged to her credit card. On March 18, 2010, the Commission\u2019s Bar Counsel\u2019s investigator interviewed Davy. On the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"689\">*689</page-number>same day, Davy moved to withdraw her appearance in Smalls\u2019s case, and on March 19, 2010, the federal court granted the motion to withdraw. On August 17, 2010, the federal court granted the \u201cMotion for Appropriate Relief <em>Nunc Pro Tunc.\u201d </em>On December 29, 2010, Davy refunded the remaining $8,000 to Smalls. The hearing judge found that, because Davy did not refund $8,000 to Smalls until December 29, 2010 \u2014 after Smalls had filed a complaint against Davy with the Commission and approximately one year after she had promised to make the refund \u2014 Davy had not been honest in her December 4, 2009, promise to give Smalls a refund.</p>\n<p id=\"b719-4\">Smalls ended up representing herself in her case. On January 14, 2012, the federal court dismissed Smalls\u2019s case because of substantive defects in the complaint drafted by Davy. Specifically, the federal court determined that it lacked subject-matter jurisdiction over all of the claims asserted by Davy on Smalls\u2019s behalf. <em>Smalls v. Emanuel, </em>840 F.Supp.2d 23, 26 (D.D.C.2012).<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Before the hearing judge, Davy stated that it was Smalls\u2019s fault that the federal court dismissed Smalls\u2019s case. According to Davy, Smalls should have amended the complaint.</p>\n<p id=\"b719-5\">B. Davy\u2019s Representation of MlcAdams and Watch Tune Up</p>\n<p id=\"b719-6\">In 2009, McAdams was a jeweler doing business as Watch Tune Up. In the District Court of Maryland, sitting in Prince George\u2019s County, Watch Tune Up was sued to recover unpaid rent. Davy met with McAdams to discuss legal matters <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"690\">*690</page-number>related to McAdams\u2019s and Watch Tune Up\u2019s financial difficulties. On February 16, 2009, Davy and McAdams entered into a written \u201cClient Retainer Agreement,\u201d under which: (1) Davy would represent McAdams in \u201cfiling bankruptcy\u201d (the written retainer agreement did not state whether Davy would handle McAdams\u2019s bankruptcy, Watch Tune Up\u2019s bankruptcy, or both); (2) Davy would receive $220 per hour; and (3) McAdams would pay Davy $1,500 as a \u201cnon-refundable engagement fee[,]\u201d which McAdams paid Davy on or about that day. On March 9, 2009, McAdams paid Davy $3,000.</p>\n<p id=\"b720-4\">On May 7, 2009, McAdams asked Davy for a billing statement. On or about May 11, 2009, Davy and McAdams entered into a second \u201cClient Retainer Agreement,\u201d under which: (1) Davy would represent McAdams in \u201cbusiness bankruptcy and business dissolution\u201d (the written retainer agreement did not delineate the amount to be charged for either service); (2) Davy would receive $220 per hour; and (3) McAdams would pay Davy $7,000 as a \u201cnon-refundable engagement fee.\u201d The second written retainer agreement did not refer to the $3,000 that McAdams had already paid. Neither the first nor second written retainer agreement mentioned a client trust account, and Davy never orally informed McAdams about client trust accounts or non-refundable engagement fees. On May 11, 2009, McAdams paid Davy another $3,000,</p>\n<p id=\"b720-5\">On June 10, 2009, on behalf of Watch Tune Up, Davy filed a \u201cVoluntary Petition for Bankruptcy Protection under Chapter 7.\u201d On June 11, 2009, the bankruptcy court issued a deficiency notice because Davy had not filed certain documents. The bankruptcy court set a deadline of June 25, 2009, to provide the missing documents. On June 25, 2009, Davy filed a \u201cMotion to Enlarge the Time\u201d until July 10, 2009; the bankruptcy court granted the motion. Davy, however, did not provide the missing documents until July 11 and 13, 2009. The documents included a schedule stating that Watch Tune Up owned a condominium. Davy had not researched land records and thus, although she identified Watch Tune Up as the condominium\u2019s owner, as she later acknowledged, she was unsure whether McAdams or Watch Tune Up actually owned <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"691\">*691</page-number>the condominium.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> The schedule listed the condominium\u2019s value as $30,000; however, there was no equity in the condominium, and Davy never had the condominium appraised.</p>\n<p id=\"b721-4\">On July 13, 2009, the bankruptcy court issued a second deficiency notice because the documents that Davy had filed were unsigned. The bankruptcy court set a deadline of July 25, 2009, to provide the signed documents. On July 28, 2009, Davy filed another \u201cMotion to Enlarge Time.\u201d On July 29, 2009, the bankruptcy court issued yet another deficiency notice, which stated that the proposed order submitted with the \u201cMotion to Enlarge Time\u201d was not properly formatted.</p>\n<p id=\"b721-5\">On July 29, 2009, for the first time, Davy gave McAdams a billing statement. Davy charged fees for administrative acts such as preparing billing statements, even though she had not explained the administrative fees to McAdams, who never consented to the fees.</p>\n<p id=\"b721-6\">On August 27, 2009, Davy corrected Watch Tune Up\u2019s bankruptcy filings. On October 8, 2009 \u2014 while Watch Tune Up\u2019s bankruptcy was ongoing \u2014 Davy e-mailed McAdams, stating that she was withdrawing from the representation, and that she would refund $2,000 and return the file to McAdams.</p>\n<p id=\"b721-7\">On December 15, 2009, McAdams filed a complaint against Davy with the Commission. On March 18, 2010, the Commission\u2019s Bar Counsel\u2019s investigator interviewed Davy. On the same day, Davy refunded $2,000 and returned the file to McAdams, and notified the bankruptcy court that she no longer represented McAdams. Davy never: (1) provided a final, accurate accounting for the $7,500 that McAdams had paid; (2) completed Watch Tune Up\u2019s dissolution or bankruptcy (which closed on September 2, 2010); (3) completed the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"692\">*692</page-number>filing process for McAdams\u2019s new business; or (4) filed for bankruptcy on McAdams\u2019s behalf.</p>\n<p id=\"b722-4\">II. Standard of Review</p>\n<p id=\"b722-5\">In an attorney discipline proceeding, this Court reviews for clear error the hearing judge\u2019s findings of fact, and reviews <em>de novo </em>the hearing judge\u2019s conclusions of law. <em>See </em>Md. R. 16-759(b)(l) (\u201cThe Court of Appeals shall review de novo the circuit court judge\u2019s conclusions of law.\u201d); Md. R. 16-759(b)(2)(B) (\u201cThe Court shall give due regard to the opportunity of the hearing judge to assess the credibility of witnesses.\u201d); <em>see also Attorney Grievance Comm\u2019n v. Fader, </em>431 Md. 395, 426-27, 66 A.3d 18, 36-37 (2013).</p>\n<p id=\"b722-6\">III. Discussion</p>\n<p id=\"b722-7\">A. Exceptions</p>\n<p id=\"b722-8\">The Commission filed no exceptions to the hearing judge\u2019s findings of fact and conclusions of law.</p>\n<p id=\"b722-9\">Davy filed a seventy-seven page document in this Court entitled \u201cExceptions, Recommendations, Renewed Motion to Dismiss and Request for Oral Argument.\u201d In the document, Davy incorporated a \u201cMotion to Dismiss,\u201d which is a fifty-five page document that she filed in the circuit court<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> in June <em>2012 </em>\u2014 i.e., after the hearing in the circuit court, but before the hearing judge issued her opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b722-10\">As a threshold matter, we decline to consider the \u201cMotion to Dismiss.\u201d Because Davy filed the \u201cMotion to Dismiss\u201d before the hearing judge issued her opinion, the \u201cMotion to Dismiss\u201d does not address the hearing judge\u2019s findings of fact and conclusions of law, and thus is of no help to us in attempting to divine any issue that Davy takes to the hearing judge\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"693\">*693</page-number>findings of fact and conclusions of law. Thus, we consider only Davy\u2019s exceptions.</p>\n<p id=\"b723-5\">Unfortunately, Davy\u2019s exceptions are of little help to us in discerning the issues she raises as to the hearing judge\u2019s findings of fact and conclusions of law. Davy\u2019s exceptions include sixty pages of tables that contain one row taking issue with nearly every sentence of the hearing judge\u2019s opinion. Each row contains one or both of two apparently copied-and-pasted paragraphs in which Davy generally denies the accompanying sentence\u2019s contents as follows:</p>\n<p id=\"b723-6\">In its Petition for Disciplinary or Remedial Action, Petitioner alleged that Respondent violated Maryland Lawyers\u2019 Rule [sic] of Professional Conduct, hereafter \u201cMRPC,\u201d [sic] 1.1, 1.2, 1.3,1.4,1.5(a) and (b), 1.15(c), 1.16(d), 8.4(c) and (d).</p>\n<p id=\"b723-7\">This finding of fact or conclusion of law is [the Commission's misleading or untrue statement of evidence not plead and at issue or not proven at trial per the Rules.</p>\n<p id=\"b723-8\">[Davy] incorporates by reference facts in her 6.29.12 Motion that were proven.</p>\n<p id=\"b723-9\">This conclusion of law is [the Commission's misstatement or reflects its omission of applicable precedent. [Davy] incorporates by reference herein legal standards in her 6.29.12 Motion which are complete and accurate.</p>\n<p id=\"b723-10\">Inexplicably, Davy even generally denies the findings of fact that are seemingly indisputable, such as the finding that in 2009, McAdams was a jeweler doing business as Watch Tune Up. Simply put, Davy fails to explain how the hearing judge\u2019s findings of fact are clearly erroneous; in no instance does Davy demonstrate that anything in the record contradicts any of the hearing judge\u2019s findings of fact.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> In an attorney discipline proceeding, if no exceptions are filed, this Court <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"694\">*694</page-number>\u201ctreat[s] the findings of fact as established for the purpose of determining appropriate sanctions, if any.\u201d Md. R. 16-759(b)(2)(A). Here, unable to discern any meaningful challenge to the hearing judge\u2019s findings of fact, we overrule the exceptions and conclude that the hearing judge\u2019s findings of fact are established by clear and convincing evidence. <em>See </em>Md. R. 16-759(b)(2)(B).</p>\n<p id=\"b724-4\">Davy\u2019s exceptions are even less clear concerning any issue she raises as to the hearing judge\u2019s conclusions of law. Nonetheless, below, we review the hearing judge\u2019s conclusions of law, and, to the extent that Davy takes exception to the hearing judge\u2019s conclusions of law, we overrule the exceptions.</p>\n<p id=\"b724-5\">B. Contentions that Davy Raises</p>\n<p id=\"b724-6\">Before we review the hearing judge\u2019s conclusions of law, we address \u2014 and specifically reject \u2014 seven contentions, not directly challenging the hearing judge\u2019s findings of fact and conclusions of law, that Davy raised at oral argument and/or in her exceptions.</p>\n<p id=\"b724-7\">First, we reject Davy\u2019s contention that the hearing judge erred in not mentioning in her opinion purported evidence of mitigating factors. We do recommend that, in an opinion in an attorney discipline proceeding, a hearing judge discuss \u2014 and either credit or discredit \u2014 all purported evidence of mitigating factors. Indeed, in his or her opinion, the hearing judge must mention purported evidence of mitigating factors where the hearing judge credits such evidence. <em>See Attorney Grievance Comm\u2019n v. Vanderlinde, </em>364 Md. 376, 384, 773 A.2d 463, 467 (2001) (In an attorney discipline proceeding, the hearing judge \u201cmust make findings in regards to facts that [he or she] believes mitigate in respect to the [lawyer\u2019s] conductf.]\u201d). However, \u201c[a]bsent indications that\u201d the hearing judge did not consider purported evidence of mitigating factors, where a hearing judge omits the purported evidence of mitigating factors from his or her opinion, we may interpret the omission to mean that the hearing judge did not credit the purported evidence of mitigating factors. <em>Attorney Grievance </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"695\">*695</page-number><em>Comm\u2019n v. Kreamer, </em>387 Md. 503, 528, 876 A.2d 79, 94 (2005) (citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b725-4\">Here, there is no indication that the hearing judge failed to consider Davy\u2019s purported evidence of mitigating factors. The hearing judge allowed Davy to testify at length on her own behalf. The hearing judge admitted all seventeen exhibits that Davy offered into evidence. After Davy testified, the hearing judge gave Davy an opportunity to be heard as to mitigating factors, and indicated that she would remain on the bench until Davy completed her presentation of mitigating circumstances.</p>\n<p id=\"b725-5\">Instead of truly offering information regarding mitigating factors, however, Davy, for the most part, again offered her own version of the facts. For example, Davy stated that she did not believe that she had \u201covercharged\u201d Smalls, she \u201chad no idea that [Smalls] expected her to stop\u201d acting on Smalls\u2019s behalf, and she did not tell Smalls that the federal court had rejected the complaint for filing because she \u201cfelt really bad about it and [ ] was embarrassed and [ ] just wanted to fix the problem.\u201d The reason the hearing judge did not mention Davy\u2019s version of the facts is clear-in her findings of fact, the hearing judge determined otherwise.</p>\n<p id=\"b725-6\">Among the purported evidence of mitigating factors, Davy stated that, since her representation of Smalls, McAdams, and Watch Tune Up, she now \u201cescrow[s]\u201d all payments, uses retainer agreements that specify the services to be performed, and no longer charges nonrefundable fees or engagement fees. Essentially, Davy stated that she had changed her ways since her representation of Smalls, McAdams, and Watch Tune Up. Davy did not address, however, why she asked Smalls for additional payments when she knew that the federal court had rejected the complaint for filing, or why she led Smalls to believe that a summons was in the process of being served. The record reflects that Davy offered no mitigating factors relevant to the hearing judge\u2019s critical finding that she deceived Smalls as to the status of Smalls\u2019s case.</p>\n<p id=\"b726-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"696\">*696</page-number>Second, we reject Davy\u2019s contention that the Commission, not the hearing judge, authored the findings of fact and conclusions of law. In an attorney discipline proceeding, a hearing judge</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b726-4\">does not need to meld together his or her own opinion, taking bits and pieces of each party\u2019s proposed findings of facts and conclusions of law, but may adopt one party\u2019s filing in its entirety, as long as it accurately reflects the [hearing] judge\u2019s independent factual findings, proven by clear and convincing evidence at the hearing, and the legal conclusions flowing therefrom.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b726-5\"><em>Attorney Grievance Comm\u2019n v. Joseph, </em>422 Md. 670, 696, 31 A.3d 137, 153 (2011), <em>reconsideration denied, </em>(Nov. 18, 2011), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 132 S.Ct. 1812, 182 L.Ed.2d 620 (2012).</p>\n<p id=\"b726-8\">Third, we reject Davy\u2019s contention that the hearing judge\u2019s opinion improperly included facts that were not contained in the complaint that McAdams filed against Davy with the Commission. Davy provides no Maryland Rule or case \u2014 and we know of none \u2014 under which, in an attorney discipline proceeding, a hearing judge\u2019s opinion cannot include facts that were not contained in the complaint that the client filed against the lawyer with the Commission. In any event, Davy does not meaningfully dispute that McAdams\u2019s complaint \u201cstate[d] facts which, if true, would constitute professional misconduct by\u201d Davy. Md. R. 16-731(a).</p>\n<p id=\"b726-9\">Fourth, we reject Davy\u2019s contention that a conditional diversion agreement between her and the Commission prevents the Commission from charging Davy in this case. Dated in August 2009, the conditional diversion agreement concerns Davy\u2019s representation of a client, other than Smalls, McAdams, or Watch Tune Up, who had filed a complaint against Davy with the Commission. The conditional diversion agreement states: \u201cThis Agreement stays any disciplinary or remedial proceedings related to the above described incident[,]\u201d meaning the conditional diversion agreement relates to the other client. (Emphasis added) (paragraph breaks <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"697\">*697</page-number>omitted). Thus, the conditional diversion agreement does not apply to this case, which relates to Davy\u2019s representation of Smalls, McAdams, and Watch Tune Up.</p>\n<p id=\"b727-4\">Fifth, we reject Davy\u2019s contention that the Commission and the hearing judge engaged in an <em>ex parte </em>communication. Without support anywhere else in the record, Davy alleges that Docket Entry 043 shows that an <em>ex parte </em>communication occurred. Docket Entry 043 states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b727-5\">10/19/2012 Motion for Extension Time, fd JSF 043</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b727-6\">Motion to extend time for filing findings of fact and conclusions of law nunc pro tunc, fd/jsk</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b727-7\">e 10-24-12 (Woodard)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b727-8\">At oral argument, the Commission stated that Docket Entry 043 refers to the Commission\u2019s motion to extend time to file its proposed findings of fact and conclusions of law. According to the Commission, Davy received a copy of the motion to extend time, and the Commission did not communicate directly with the hearing judge about the motion. We are satisfied with the Commission\u2019s explanation of Docket Entry 043.</p>\n<p id=\"b727-9\">Sixth, we reject Davy\u2019s contention that, in this case and others, the Commission has \u201cengag[ed] in corruption!,]\u201d \u201cpatronage!,]\u201d and a conspiracy to discriminate against female African-American lawyers. Other than her own conclusory accusations, Davy offers no proof of these inflammatory contentions.</p>\n<p id=\"b727-10\">Seventh, we reject Davy\u2019s contention that the Commission \u201cattacked her] integrity through a defamatory and libelous published opinion ... <em>In re Davy, </em>25 A.3d 70 (D.C.App.2011)[.]\u201d<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> In her opinion, the hearing judge never referred to <em>Davy, </em>25 A.3d 70. Similarly, in its \u201cPetition for Disciplinary <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"698\">*698</page-number>or Remedial Action\u201d and \u201cRecommendation for Sanction,\u201d the Commission never referred to <em>Davy.</em><footnotemark><em>9</em></footnotemark><em> </em>In any event, in our determination of the appropriate sanction, we do not consider <em>Davy.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b728-4\">C. Violations of MLRPC</p>\n<p id=\"A9L\">MLRPC 1.1 (Competence)</p>\n<p id=\"b728-5\">\u201cA lawyer shall provide competent representation to a client. Competent representation requires the legal knowledge, skill, thoroughness and preparation reasonably necessary for the representation.\u201d MLRPC 1.1.</p>\n<p id=\"b728-6\">In this case, clear and convincing evidence supports the hearing judge\u2019s conclusion that Davy violated MLRPC 1.1 in representing Smalls. It is undisputed that Davy attempted to file the complaint, and the federal court rejected the complaint for filing, as Davy had failed to renew her membership in the federal court\u2019s bar and to include a civil cover sheet, summons, and disc with the complaint. Similarly, it is undisputed that the federal court later dismissed the complaint because of a lack of subject-matter jurisdiction. <em>Smalls, </em>840 F.Supp.2d at 26.</p>\n<p id=\"b728-7\">Likewise, clear and convincing evidence supports the hearing judge\u2019s conclusion that Davy violated MLRPC 1.1 in representing McAdams and Watch Tune Up. After Davy filed for bankruptcy on Watch Tune Up\u2019s behalf, the bankruptcy court sent Davy three deficiency notices regarding the bankruptcy filing. As part of the bankruptcy filing, Davy submitted a schedule that stated that Watch Tune Up owned a condominium. Davy, however, had not researched land records; thus, as she acknowledged, she was unsure whether McAdams or Watch Tune Up owned the condominium. The schedule listed the condominium\u2019s value as $80,000; however, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"699\">*699</page-number>there was no equity in the condominium, and Davy never had the condominium appraised.</p>\n<p id=\"b729-4\">MLRPC 1.2(a) (Allocation of Authority Between Client and Lawyer)</p>\n<p id=\"b729-5\">MLRPC 1.2(a) states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b729-6\">[A] lawyer shall abide by a client\u2019s decisions concerning the objectives of the representation and, when appropriate, shall consult with the client as to the means by which they are to be pursued. A lawyer may take such action on behalf of the client as is impliedly authorized to carry out the representation.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b729-7\">Clear and convincing evidence supports the hearing judge\u2019s conclusion that Davy violated MLRPC 1.2(a) in representing Smalls. After learning that there was no case pending in her name in the federal court, on December 3, 2009, Smalls emailed Davy, stating that she did not believe that Davy had filed the complaint on November 6, 2009, that Davy had breached their contract, and that, if Davy did not refund the $10,000 that she had paid, she would take \u201cappropriate action.\u201d Although Smalls did not expressly state that she was ending the representation, based on Smalls\u2019s e-mail, a reasonable lawyer in Davy\u2019s position would have realized that Smalls had ended the representation. Upon receipt of Smalls\u2019s letter, Davy was not authorized to act further on Smalls\u2019s behalf. Nonetheless, without Smalls\u2019s permission, after having falsely informed Smalls that the federal court had already agreed to accept the complaint as timely filed, Davy filed a corrective motion in the federal court, and requested that Smalls replenish her account. Although Smalls eventually expressly told Davy that she had ended the representation, Davy took three months to move to withdraw her appearance from the case.</p>\n<p id=\"b729-8\">MLRPC 1.3 (Diligence)</p>\n<p id=\"b729-9\">\u201cA lawyer shall act with reasonable diligence and promptness in representing a client.\u201d MLRPC 1.3.</p>\n<p id=\"b729-10\">Clear and convincing evidence supports the hearing judge\u2019s conclusion that Davy violated MLRPC 1.3 in representing <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"700\">*700</page-number>Smalls. On the day that the representation started, Smalls told Davy that she needed to file a complaint within two weeks; however, Davy did not file the complaint until 9:11 p.m. on the day on which it was due. After learning that the complaint had been rejected by the federal court, Davy failed to notify Smalls of the complaint\u2019s rejection or to attempt to correct the deficiency, until after Smalls told Davy that she had learned of the situation and demanded a refund. After Smalls expressly told Davy that that she had ended the representation, Davy took three months to move to withdraw her appearance.</p>\n<p id=\"b730-4\">Clear and convincing evidence supports the hearing judge\u2019s conclusion that Davy violated MLRPC 1.3 in representing McAdams and Watch Tune Up. After entering into the first retainer agreement, Davy took approximately four months to file for bankruptcy on Watch Tune Up\u2019s behalf. Afterward, the bankruptcy court sent Davy three deficiency notices regarding the bankruptcy filing, which she did not completely correct until approximately two months after the date of the original bankruptcy filing.</p>\n<p id=\"b730-5\">MLRPC 1.4 (Communication Generally)</p>\n<p id=\"b730-6\">MLRPC 1.4 provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b730-7\">(a) A lawyer shall:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b730-8\">(2) keep the client reasonably informed about the status of the matter; [and]</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b730-9\">(3) promptly comply with reasonable requests for information[.]</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b730-10\">(b) A lawyer shall explain a matter to the extent reasonably necessary to permit the client to make informed decisions regarding the representation.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b730-11\">Clear and convincing evidence supports the hearing judge\u2019s conclusion that Davy violated MLRPC 1.4 in representing Smalls. After Davy told Smalls that she had filed the com<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"701\">*701</page-number>plaint, Smalls asked Davy for the case number, which Davy promised to provide; however, Davy made no effort to obtain the case number. Critically, prior to Smalls contacting the federal court, Davy never told Smalls that the federal court had rejected the complaint for filing; rather, Davy provided false information about the availability of the summons and demanded additional payment.</p>\n<p id=\"b731-4\">Clear and convincing evidence supports the hearing judge\u2019s conclusion that Davy violated MLRPC 1.4 in representing McAdams and Watch Tune Up. Approximately three months after entering into the first written retainer agreement, McAdams asked Davy for a billing statement. Davy failed to provide a billing statement until nearly three months later.</p>\n<p id=\"b731-5\">MLRPC 1.5(a) (Reasonable Fees)</p>\n<p id=\"b731-6\">MLRPC 1.5(a) states, in relevant part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b731-7\">A lawyer shall not make an agreement for, charge, or collect an unreasonable fee or an unreasonable amount for expenses. The factors to be considered in determining the reasonableness of a fee include the following:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b731-8\">(1) the time and labor required, the novelty and difficulty of the questions involved, and the skill requisite to perform the legal service properly;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b731-9\">(2) the likelihood, if apparent to the client, that the acceptance of the particular employment will preclude other employment of the lawyer;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b731-10\">\u2756 * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b731-11\">(4) the amount involved and the results obtained;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b731-12\">(5) the time limitations imposed by the client or by the circumstances;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b731-13\">(6) the nature and length of the professional relationship with the client; [and]</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b731-14\">(7) the experience, reputation, and ability of the lawyer or lawyers performing the services[.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b731-15\">Although a fee for certain services \u201cmay not be unreasonable on its face,\u201d the fee is unreasonable if the lawyer <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"702\">*702</page-number>\u201cfail[s] to perform the services to any meaningful degree[.]\u201d <em>Attorney Grievance Comm\u2019n v.

Smalls paid Davy a total of $10,000, and Davy merely prepared and delivered a complaint that the federal court rejected for filing. Not only did the federal court reject the complaint for filing, but the federal court also later dismissed the case because of a lack of subject-matter jurisdiction. <em>See Smalls, </em>840 F.Supp.2d at 26. Additionally, Davy charged Smalls a $500 \u201cnonrefundable engagement fee,\u201d even though she did not turn away any potential clients as a result of her representation of Smalls. Under MLRPC 1.5(a), an \u201cengagement fee\u201d is unreasonable where the lawyer \u201cprovides] no benefit to the client in exchange for the fee.\u201d <em>Attorney Grievance Comm\u2019n v.

Although McAdams paid Davy a total of $7,500, Davy never completed Watch Tune Up\u2019s dissolution or bankruptcy, or the filing process for McAdams\u2019s new business, and never filed for bankruptcy on McAdams\u2019s behalf.</p>\n<p id=\"b732-6\">MLRPC 1.5(b) (Communication of Fees)</p>\n<p id=\"b732-7\">MLRPC 1.5(b) states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b732-8\">The scope of the representation and the basis or rate of the fee and expenses for which the client will be responsible shall be communicated to the client, preferably in writing, before or within a reasonable time after commencing the representation^] ...

During their telephone conversation, Davy told Smalls that she would need a retainer of up to $3,000; however, during their first meeting, Davy told Smalls that she would need a retainer of $5,000. After receiving Smalls\u2019s check and credit card information, Davy told Smalls that she would need a retainer of $20,000. The written retainer agreement: (1) was not produced until two weeks after Davy and Smalls first met; (2) stated that the retainer was $5,000, contrary to Davy\u2019s earlier statement that the retainer was $20,000; and (3) contained two fees about which Davy had not told Smalls earlier. Although Davy agreed to let Smalls use a payment plan, Davy never explained the details of the payment plan\u2014 not even when she produced the written retainer agreement.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b733-5\">Clear and convincing evidence supports the hearing judge\u2019s conclusion that Davy violated MLRPC 1.5(b) in representing McAdams and Watch Tune Up. The first written retainer agreement did not state whether Davy would handle McAdams\u2019s bankruptcy, Watch Tune Up\u2019s bankruptcy, or both. The second written retainer agreement did not delineate between the amount to be charged for the \u201cbusiness bankruptcy\u201d and the amount to be charged for the \u201cbusiness dissolution.\u201d Although the first written retainer agreement stated that McAdams would pay Davy $1,500 as a \u201cnonrefundable engagement fee,\u201d the second written retainer <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"704\">*704</page-number>agreement stated that McAdams would pay Davy $7,000 as a \u201cnon-refundable engagement fee.\u201d Davy did not provide billing statements or other accountings to McAdams until after he asked her for a statement of the legal fees that he had paid; Davy promised a statement, but did not provide one to McAdams until approximately five months after McAdams\u2019s first payment.</p>\n<p id=\"b734-4\">In representing Smalls, McAdams, and Watch Tune Up, Davy charged fees for such administrative acts as preparing billing statements, even though Davy never explained the administrative fees to Smalls or McAdams, who never consented to the administrative fees. A lawyer may charge a fee for \u201coverhead costs and expenses\u201d only if the lawyer: (1) explains the fee \u2014 and its method of calculation \u2014 to the client before the representation begins; (2) obtains the client\u2019s consent for the fee; and (3) expressly includes the fee in a written retainer agreement. <em>Attorney Grievance Comm\u2019n v.

Davy did not deposit Smalls\u2019s payments into a client trust account. During their first meeting \u2014 at which Smalls paid Davy $5,000 \u2014 Davy did not orally inform Smalls about <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"705\">*705</page-number>client trust accounts. Although the written retainer agreement stated that the retainer would not be deposited into a client trust account, Davy did not point out this provision or orally inform Smalls about client trust accounts.</p>\n<p id=\"b735-4\">Clear and convincing evidence supports the hearing judge\u2019s conclusion that Davy violated MLRPC 1.15(c) in representing McAdams and Watch Tune Up. Neither the first nor second written retainer agreement mentioned a client trust account, and Davy did not deposit McAdams\u2019s payments into a client trust account.</p>\n<p id=\"b735-5\">MLRPC 1.16(d) (Termination of Representation)</p>\n<p id=\"b735-6\">MLRPC 1.16(d) states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b735-7\">Upon termination of representation, a lawyer shall take steps to the extent reasonably practicable to protect a client\u2019s interests, such as giving reasonable notice to the client, allowing time for employment of other counsel, surrendering papers and property to which the client is entitled and refunding any advance payment of fee or expense that has not been earned or incurred.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b735-8\">Clear and convincing evidence supports the hearing judge\u2019s conclusion that Davy violated MLRPC 1.16(d) in representing Smalls. Davy did not move to withdraw her appearance in Smalls\u2019s case until approximately three months after the representation ended. Davy did not refund the $8,000 to Smalls until approximately a year after the representation ended.</p>\n<p id=\"b735-9\">Clear and convincing evidence supports the hearing judge\u2019s conclusion that Davy violated MLRPC 1.16(d) in representing McAdams and Watch Tune Up. Approximately one month after correcting the bankruptcy filings \u2014 while Watch Tune Up\u2019s bankruptcy was ongoing \u2014 Davy e-mailed McAdams, stating that she was withdrawing from the representation. Davy did not return the file to McAdams for at least three months. As of approximately five months after her withdrawal, Davy had not refunded $2,000 to McAdams as promised or notified the bankruptcy court that she no longer represented McAdams.</p>\n<p id=\"b736-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"706\">*706</page-number>MLRPC 8.4(c) (Dishonesty, Fraud, Deceit or Misrepresentation)</p>\n<p id=\"b736-5\">\u201cIt is professional misconduct for a lawyer to ... engage in conduct involving dishonesty, fraud, deceit or misrepresentation[.]\u201d MLRPC 8.4(c).</p>\n<p id=\"b736-6\">Clear and convincing evidence supports the hearing judge\u2019s conclusion that Davy violated MLRPC 8.4(c) in representing Smalls. Although Davy knew that the federal court had rejected the complaint for filing, she falsely led Smalls to believe that the complaint was successfully filed and asked for additional retainer payments. In addition, although Davy knew that no summons had been issued, she falsely told Smalls that she had followed up with the process server. Even after Smalls told Davy that she had discovered there was no case pending in her name in the federal court, Davy failed to tell Smalls that the federal court had rejected the complaint for filing. Instead, Davy told Smalls that she \u201cfollowed up on [her] claims and [ ] discovered that there was a technical error with the filing[,]\u201d thus falsely implying that she had not known about the federal court\u2019s rejection of the complaint for filing until Smalls told her. Equally troubling, before the federal court granted the \u201cMotion for Appropriate Relief <em>Nunc Pro Tunc,\u201d </em>Davy falsely told Smalls that the federal court had \u201cadvised [her] that [the] case [would] be perfected as of the date filed.\u201d Although Davy had already sent Smalls a statement that included a charge for Davy\u2019s telephone call with the federal court about the complaint, she falsely told Smalls that she would correct the complaint\u2019s problems at no charge.

As discussed above, Davy failed to adequately represent Smalls, McAdams, and Watch Tune Up, and failed to deposit Smalls\u2019s and McAdams\u2019s payments into a client trust account.</p>\n<p id=\"b737-5\">D. Sanction</p>\n<p id=\"b737-6\">Unsurprisingly, at oral argument, Davy urged the Court to indefinitely suspend her with the right to reapply after thirty days \u2014 seeking, potentially, an even lesser sanction than the one-year suspension that she previously received. <em>See Hamilton, </em>377 Md. 54, 832 A.2d 170. In seeking the indefinite suspension, Davy denied an intent to steal and acknowledged that she should have deposited Smalls\u2019s payments into a client trust account. Completely absent from Davy\u2019s presentation, however, was any acknowledgement of her deceit and intentional misleading of Smalls. The Commission sought disbarment.</p>\n<p id=\"b737-7\">In <em>Attorney Grievance Comm\u2019n v. Walker-Turner, </em>428 Md. 214, 233, 51 A.3d 553, 564 (2012), we stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b737-8\">[This Court] evaluate^] the facts and circumstances of each case to ensure that the [lawyer\u2019s sanction is commensurate with the gravity and intent of the misconduct. We have looked often to the [American Bar Association]^ standards for attorney sanctions which pose four rhetorical questions as an analytical template: \u201c(1) What is the nature of the ethical duty violated?; (2) What was the lawyer\u2019s mental state?; (3) What was the extent of the actual or potential <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"708\">*708</page-number>injury caused by the lawyer\u2019s misconduct?; and (4) Are there any aggravating or mitigating [factorjs?\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b738-5\">(Citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b738-6\">As to the nature of the ethical duty breached, in addition to violating nine other MLRPC, Davy violated MLRPC 8.4(c) (Dishonesty, Fraud, Deceit or Misrepresentation); and, as to Davy\u2019s mental state, Davy\u2019s violation of MLRPC 8.4(c) was intentional. In six instances, Davy was intentionally dishonest with Smalls. First, Davy lied to Smalls in stating that she had filed the complaint, whereas Davy knew that the federal court had rejected the complaint for filing. Second, Davy lied to Smalls in stating that she had followed up with the process server, whereas Davy knew that no summons had been issued. Third, Davy lied to Smalls in stating that she had followed up on Smalls\u2019s claims and discovered that there was a \u201ctechnical error\u201d with the filing, whereas Davy already knew that the federal court had rejected the complaint for filing. Fourth, Davy lied to Smalls in stating that the federal court had \u201cadvised [her] that [the] case [would] be perfected as of the date filed[,]\u201d whereas Davy knew that the federal court had not yet granted the \u201cMotion for Appropriate Relief <em>Nunc Pro Tunc.\u201d </em>Fifth, Davy lied to Smalls in stating that she would correct the complaint\u2019s problems at no charge, when Davy had already sent Smalls a statement that included a charge for Davy\u2019s telephone call with the federal court about the complaint. Sixth, Davy was dishonest in her promise to give Smalls a refund, as she did not refund the $8,000 to Smalls until a year later, after Smalls had filed a complaint against her with the Commission.</p>\n<p id=\"b738-7\">Intentionally violating MLRPC 8.4(c) (Dishonesty, Fraud, Deceit or Misrepresentation) is most egregious misconduct. <em>See Attorney Grievance Comm\u2019n v.

Indeed, in multiple cases, this Court has disbarred lawyers who were intentionally dishonest. <em>See, e.g., Attorney Grievance Comm\u2019n v. Pennington, </em>387 Md. 565, 573, 596, 876 A.2d 642, 647, 660 (2005) (This Court disbarred a lawyer who falsely represented to her clients that their case had settled.); <em>Attorney Grievance Comm\u2019n v.

Thus, Davy\u2019s intentional violation of MLRPC 8.4(c) alone suffices to merit disbarment.</p>\n<p id=\"b740-4\">Our conclusion that disbarment is the appropriate sanction is unassailable given the aggravating factors accompanying Davy\u2019s conduct and the absence of any identifiable mitigating factors.</p>\n<p id=\"b740-5\">Aggravating factors include:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b740-6\">(a) prior disciplinary offenses;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b740-7\">(b) dishonest or selfish motive;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b740-8\">(c) pattern of misconduct;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b740-9\">(d) multiple offenses;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b740-10\">(e) bad faith obstruction of the [attorney] disciplinary proceedings by intentionally failing to comply with rules or orders of the [Commission];</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b740-11\">(f) submission of false evidence, false statements, or other deceptive practices during the [attorney] disciplinary process;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b740-12\">(g) refusal to acknowledge wrongful nature of conduct;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b740-13\">(h) vulnerability of the victim;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b740-14\">(i) substantial experience in the practice of law;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b740-15\">(j) indifference to making restitution.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b740-16\"><em>Attorney Grievance Comm\u2019n v. Sperling, </em>432 Md. 471, 495-96, 69 A.3d 478, 492 (2013) (citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b740-17\">Here, there are multiple aggravating factors. First, Davy has a prior disciplinary offense. With her consent, this Court previously has indefinitely suspended Davy from the Bar of Maryland. <em>See Hamilton, </em>377 Md. 54, 832 A.2d 170.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"Auf\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"711\">*711</page-number>Second, Davy has shown a dishonest or selfish motive. Specifically, in her representation of Smalls, Davy showed a motive to demand additional payments and keep payments that she had already received. In the written retainer agreement with Smalls, Davy intentionally failed to state that the retainer would be $20,000 because the $20,000 retainer may have discouraged Smalls from hiring Davy. Davy stated that Smalls did not deserve a prompt answer to her question about the summons because Smalls had not made additional payments. Davy intentionally failed to inform Smalls about the federal court\u2019s rejection of the complaint for filing because she wanted to mislead Smalls as to the quality of her representation. And, even after Smalls ended the representation, Davy continued to act on Smalls\u2019s behalf for financial <em>reasons </em>\u2014 i.e., so that she could continue to demand payments from Smalls.</p>\n<p id=\"b741-5\">Third, Davy has engaged in a pattern of misconduct involving more than one client. In her representation of Smalls and in her representation of McAdams and Watch Tune <em>Up </em>\u2014 ie., in both of two unrelated matters \u2014 Davy violated MLRPC 1.1, 1.3, 1.4,1.5(a), 1.5(b), 1.15(c), 1.16(d), and 8.4(d).</p>\n<p id=\"b741-6\">Fourth, Davy has obviously committed multiple offenses. As discussed above, in her representation of Smalls, McAdams, and Watch Tune Up, Davy collectively violated MLRPC 1.1, 1.2(a), 1.3, 1.4, 1.5(a), 1.5(b), 1.15(c), 1.16(d), 8.4(c), and 8.4(d).</p>\n<p id=\"b741-7\">Fifth, Davy has refused to acknowledge the wrongful nature of her conduct, let alone provide compelling extenuating circumstances for her behavior.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> Davy attributes her egregious <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"712\">*712</page-number>misconduct to \u201cgood faith errors ... that amount to technicalities];.]\u201d Davy blithely asserts that she \u201cserv[ed her clients] effectively and fruitfully with great energy, devotion and dedieation[.]\u201d Although the federal court dismissed Smalls\u2019s case because of substantive defects in the complaint, Davy stated that it was Smalls\u2019s fault that the federal court dismissed the case.</p>\n<p id=\"b742-4\">Sixth, Davy has shown an indifference to making restitution. Davy did not refund any money to Smalls or McAdams until after they had filed complaints against her with the Commission. Indeed, Davy did not refund $8,000 to Smalls until approximately a year after the representation ended. On the day that the Commission\u2019s Bar Counsel\u2019s investigator met with Davy, she moved to withdraw her appearance in Smalls\u2019s case, refunded $2,000 and returned the file to McAdams, and notified the bankruptcy court that she no longer represented McAdams.</p>\n<p id=\"b742-5\">Mitigating factors include:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b742-6\">(a) absence of a prior disciplinary record;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b742-7\">(b) absence of a dishonest or selfish motive;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b742-8\">(c) personal or emotional problems;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b743-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"713\">*713</page-number>(d) timely good faith efforts to make restitution or to rectify consequences of misconduct;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b743-4\">(e) full and free disclosure to [the Commission] or cooperative attitude toward [attorney discipline] proceedings;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b743-5\">(f) inexperience in the practice of law;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b743-6\">(g) character or reputation;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b743-7\">(h) physical disability;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b743-8\">(i) mental disability or chemical dependency including alcoholism or drug abuse when:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b743-9\">(1) there is medical evidence that the [attorney] is affected by a chemical dependency or mental disability;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b743-10\">(2) the chemical dependency or mental disability caused the misconduct;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b743-11\">(3) the [attorney]\u2019s recovery from the chemical dependency or mental disability is demonstrated by a meaningful and sustained period of successful rehabilitation; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b743-12\">(4) the recovery arrested the misconduct and recurrence of that misconduct is unlikely;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b743-13\">(j) delay in [attorney] disciplinary proceedings;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b743-14\">(k) imposition of other penalties or sanctions;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b743-15\"><em>(l </em>[ ]) remorse; [and]</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b743-16\">(m) remoteness of prior offenses.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b743-17\"><em>Attorney Grievance Comm\u2019n v. Coppock, </em>432 Md. 629, 649 n. 18, 69 A.3d 1092, 1103 n. 18 (2013) (citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b743-18\">There are no perceptible mitigating factors.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> Although the hearing judge permitted Davy a lengthy opportunity to present mitigating circumstances and Davy provided explanations for her misconduct, we would not consider Davy\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"714\">*714</page-number>explanations to be mitigating factors, even if the hearing judge had credited Davy\u2019s statements. For example, we reject Davy\u2019s explanation that she did not deposit Smalls\u2019s payments into a client trust account because, at the time that Davy began representing Smalls, she was corresponding with the Commission about a prior complaint regarding the written retainer agreement format that she had been using. \u201c[Ejvery lawyer is presumed to know and abide by the\u201d MLRPC. <em>Pennington, </em>387 Md. at 598, 876 A.2d at 662. Davy alone was responsible for knowing and complying with MLRPC 1.15(c). Davy cannot excuse her violation of MLRPC 1.15(c) by virtue of alleging that \u2014 while monitoring her under a conditional diversion agreement \u2014 the Commission had not yet told her what written retainer agreement format to use.</p>\n<p id=\"b744-4\">In her representation of Smalls, McAdams, and Watch Tune Up, Davy was intentionally deceitful, woefully incompetent, and otherwise in flagrant disregard of several MLRPC. These circumstances \u2014 combined with her failure to turn over a new leaf since her previous suspension and reinstatement\u2014 convince us that the public would be at risk if Davy were to continue to practice law in Maryland. For the above reasons, we entered the September 5, 2013, per curiam order, immediately disbarring Davy and awarding costs against her.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b713-8\">. Where a lawyer\u2019s misconduct is so egregious that there is an urgent need to protect the public from the lawyer\u2019s practice of law, this Court may exercise its discretion to disbar the lawyer immediately after oral argument, and to explain the reasons in a subsequent opinion. <em>See generally Attorney Grievance Comm\u2019n v. Coppock, </em>432 Md. 629, 648, 69 A.3d 1092, 1102 (2013) (\"[T]he ... goal of attorney discipline proceedings is to protect the public.\u201d (Alteration in original) (citation and internal quotation marks omitted)).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b713-9\">. The hearing judge inadvertently stated that Davy's suspension occurred in 2002. At the time of her suspension, Davy was also known as \u201cMichelle Hamilton.\u201d <em>See Hamilton, </em>377 Md. 54, 832 A.2d 170.</p>\n<p id=\"b713-10\">Although the hearing judge did not refer to any case by name, the hearing judge generally referred to the circumstances of <em>Hamilton, id., </em>832 A.2d 170, <em>In re Petition for Reinstatement of Hamilton, </em>384 Md. 156, 862 A.2d 992 (2004), and <em>Smalls v.

Md. R. 16-736(c)(4). Below, in our discussion of mitigating factors, we address the frivolousness of Davy\u2019s contention.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b719-7\">. For example, in Counts I and II of the complaint, Davy alleged race discrimination and retaliation on behalf of Smalls pursuant to 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1981(b). <em>Smalls, </em>840 F.Supp.2d at 29. The Supreme Court, however, has established Title VII as the exclusive judicial remedy for claims of discrimination in the context of federal employment. <em>Id. </em>Count III was dismissed because the Court of Federal Claims has exclusive jurisdiction over contract claims for damages greater than $10,000, and Davy had demanded greater than $10,000 in damages. <em>Id. </em>at 30. Count IV was dismissed because the Civil Service Reform Act precludes claims for breach of implied contract. <em>Id. </em>at 32. Count VII was dismissed because \"[a] claim of civil conspiracy is not an independent tort under D.C. law[.j\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 36.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b721-8\">. Before the hearing judge, the Commission read into the record the following excerpt from Davy\u2019s deposition:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b721-9\">[Watch Tune Up] had a condominium, a business condominium.... I\u2019m not 100 percent certain ... exactly how it was titled.... I think it was titled in [] McAdams\u2019[s] name.... [B]ut [the condominium] was used for his business.... So we did declare [the condominium] as an asset of [Watch Tune Up] in the bankruptcy.</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b722-11\">. In filing a \"Motion to Dismiss\u201d in the circuit court, Davy did not realize that the hearing judge had no authority to dismiss this case. <em>See Attorney Grievance Comm\u2019n v. Braskey, </em>378 Md. 425, 441, 836 A.2d 605, 615 (2003) (In an attorney discipline proceeding, \"the hearing judge ... lacks [the] authority to dismiss the\u201d case. (Citation omitted)).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b723-11\">. Instead of contending that the hearing judge\u2019s findings of fact are clearly erroneous, Davy alleges additional facts that are not supported by the record. For example, Davy alleges that Smalls ended the representation because Smalls found new employment, \u201cnot because [] Davy mistreated [] Smalls.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b723-12\">Davy's other factual allegations are equally misguided. For example, Davy contends that she represented Smalls for such \u201ca short time\u201d that \u201c[t]here was not even sufficient time for [ ] Davy to have perpetrated the deceit\u201d with which the Commission charged Davy. Again, Davy does not explain how the hearing judge's findings of fact \u2014 including the finding that Davy deceived Smalls \u2014 are clearly erroneous.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b727-11\">. In <em>Davy, </em>25 A.3d at 71, the District of Columbia Court of Appeals issued Davy reciprocal discipline; namely, that Court issued \"a one-year suspension with a fitness requirement\u201d based on this Court\u2019s order in <em>Hamilton, </em>377 Md. 54, 832 A.2d 170.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"9\">\n<p id=\"b728-8\">. In its response to the exceptions, the Commission points out that Davy, not the Commission, called this Court\u2019s attention to <em>Davy, </em>25 A.3d 70.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"10\">\n<p id=\"b733-6\">. Instead, Davy simply demanded additional payments on at least six occasions, <em>i.e., </em>Davy\u2019s statement on November 4, 2009, that \"[m]am-ma's got to eat, so you're [] going to have to pay this kind of money!, 1\u201d Davy's request on November 23, 2009, that the account be replenished, the request on November 30, 2009, for Smalls to provide a check, the allegation on December 1, 2009, that Smalls did not pay the filing fee, the request on December 15, 2009, to replenish the account, and finally, Davy\u2019s request on December 21, 2009, that Smalls comply with the retainer agreement.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"11\">\n<p id=\"b739-9\">. At oral argument, Davy relied on <em>Attorney Grievance Comm\u2019n </em>v. <em>Kemp, </em>303 Md. 664, 681, 496 A.2d 672, 680 (1985), in which this Court reprimanded lawyers who charged excessive fees, commingled client funds with personal funds, and failed to keep accurate records. In <em>Kemp, </em>the lawyers\u2019 conduct did not involve intentional dishonesty, fraud, deceit, or misrepresentation; thus, <em>Kemp </em>is not comparable.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"12\">\n<p id=\"b740-18\">. In addition to her prior suspension, before her representation of Smalls \u2014 and during her representation of McAdams and Watch Tune Up \u2014 Davy entered into the conditional diversion agreement that related to her representation of a client who also had filed a complaint against Davy with the Commission. Thus, at the time Davy committed the MLRPC violations as to Smalls, in addition to having been previously <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"711\">*711</page-number>suspended, she was under the supervision o\u00ed the Commission via a conditional diversion agreement.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"13\">\n<p id=\"b741-9\">. Indeed, Davy has consistently belittled the charges and attempted to shift the focus away from her own misconduct. For example, Davy accuses the Commission of discriminating against her on the basis of her race and gender. Davy even accuses the Commission of \u201chandpick[ing]\u201d a female African-American hearing judge to avoid the appearance of discrimination against Davy on the basis of her race and gender. Apparently, Davy did not realize that this Court \u2014 not the Commission \u2014 referred the case to the hearing judge. <em>See </em>Md. R. 16-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"712\">*712</page-number>752(a) (\"[T]he Court of Appeals may enter an order designating a judge of any circuit court to hear the action[.]\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b742-10\">With her completely baseless allegations of discrimination \u2014 including her allegations that the Commission \"engag[ed] in corruption\u201d and \"patronage!,]\u201d and that the hearing judge was \"used as a tool because of her race and gender\u201d- \u2014 -Davy exceeds contending that women and minority attorneys are disproportionately affected by the disciplinary process, and rather levels allegations that the hearing judge and the Commission intentionally engaged in unprincipled behavior. With these allegations, Davy disparages the Maryland Judiciary, demeans the Commission and the attorney discipline process, and most importantly shows that she obstinately refuses to take responsibility for her egregious misconduct.</p>\n<p id=\"b742-11\">To be sure, in an attorney discipline proceeding, a lawyer has every right to deny the facts that the Commission alleges, contend that he or she did not violate the MLRPC, offer evidence at the hearing, and/or file exceptions to the hearing judge\u2019s findings of fact and/or conclusions of law. Here, however, Davy has failed to meaningfully engage in any of these actions.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"14\">\n<p id=\"b743-19\">. In her presentation of mitigating circumstances, Davy specifically advised the hearing judge that she had not been experiencing a mental disability or personal or emotional problems during her representation of Smalls, McAdams, and Watch Tune Up. Before the hearing judge, Davy stated that, at the time of her prior suspension, <em>see Hamilton, </em>377 Md. 54, 832 A.2d 170, she was \"extremely depressed\u201d and had \u201ca nervous breakdown),]\u201d but \u201cthat was a singular event in [her] life).]\u201d (Emphasis added).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
