Daniel Quinn Mahone (hereinafter \u201cMahone\u201d) was admitted to the practice of law in the State of Maryland on June 25,1986. He currently maintains an office located at 9A West Patrick Street, Frederick, Maryland 21701. Mahone has been a solo practitioner since 2010. He is now fifty (50) years old. He had never been arrested prior to February 1, 2010.</p>\n<p id=\"b120-6\">\u201c2. On February 1, 2010, the Honorable Michael R. Pearson was presiding in the case of <em>Mayo v. Taylor </em>(Case No. CADV 10-01823) in the Circuit Court for Prince George\u2019s County. The matter involved a Final Protective Order proceeding with allegations of serious injuries to a two (2) year-old child brought by his paternal grandmother against her own son, the child\u2019s biological father.</p>\n<p id=\"b120-7\">\u201c3. On February 1, 2010, Bailiff Harris, Bailiff Washington, Deputy Sheriff Milam, and Deputy Harville were assigned to Judge Pearson\u2019s courtroom to provide security.</p>\n<p id=\"b120-8\">\u201c4. Respondent entered the courtroom during Final Argument. He did not \u201cbarge\u201d into the courtroom. Respondent represented the child\u2019s mother, who had moved to Maine following the removal of the infant from her care by the Washington County Department of Social Services. Respondent\u2019s client was neither present nor a party to the proceedings. Neither she nor Respondent had received prior notice of the proceedings. Respondent was made aware of the proceeding by telephone message received the morning of February 1, 2010 from the biological father. Respondent <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"91\">*91</page-number>traveled to the Prince George\u2019s County Circuit Court to represent his client\u2019s interests.</p>\n<p id=\"b121-4\">\u201c5. Respondent was dressed in a suit and was not inappropriate in his physical demeanor upon arrival. He was not \u201cdisheveled and winded.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b121-5\">\u201c6. Judge Pearson interrupted Final Argument to allow Respondent to inform the Court as to the reason for his presence and to explain his client\u2019s position. Judge Pearson informed Respondent as to the nature of the proceedings being a Final Protective Order hearing and informed Respondent that if he chose to file motions regarding the Child\u2019s custody, that such would be considered at a later date. Judge Pearson then directed Respondent to be seated.</p>\n<p id=\"b121-6\">\u201c7. In the colloquy with Judge Pearson, Respondent was neither rude nor disrespectful. At no time were Respondent\u2019s words toward Judge Pearson other than professional.</p>\n<p id=\"b121-7\">\u201c8. Following the colloquy between Respondent and Judge Pearson, Respondent did not remain quiet and seated. Judge Pearson\u2019s comment regarding lowering of voice was directed to Respondent. Respondent made verbal attempts to communicate with Taylor during Final Argument. In response, Taylor turned around from counsel\u2019s] table to receive communications from Respondent. Respondent was asked on several occasions by Bailiff Harris, Deputy Harville and Deputy Mi-lam to remain quiet, to lower his voice, and to remain seated. Respondent failed to fully comply with these instructions.</p>\n<p id=\"b121-8\">\u201c9. Judge Pearson was hearing a sensitive, serious case with <em>pro se </em>parties. His focus was to make and explain his Ruling and to keep matters calm between the parties before him. Respondent\u2019s behavior was \u201canimated\u201d before his colloquy with the Court, which behavior became \u201cagitated\u201d thereafter. Mahone did not further attempt to address the Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b121-9\">\u201c10. Respondent, from his seat in the Gallery directly behind the biological father, passed one written note to him in the Well. Respondent ceased doing so when instructed by the bailiff.</p>\n<p id=\"b122-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"92\">*92</page-number>\u201c11. The only record of courtroom proceedings is that of the court reporter, as no audio or visual recording was made.</p>\n<p id=\"b122-4\">\u201c12. Judge Pearson did not specifically direct or address Respondent\u2019s courtroom removal nor any other aspect of Respondent\u2019s courtroom behavior. Judge Pearson did not admonish, correct, or bring to Respondent\u2019s attention any displeasure he may have had with Mahone\u2019s behavior until his February 26, 2010 letter to Bar Counsel.</p>\n<p id=\"b122-5\">\u201c13. Respondent did not commit any criminal behavior in the courtroom.</p>\n<p id=\"b122-6\">\u201c14. Respondent was removed from the courtroom by Deputy Harville after Final Argument has concluded, but before the Ruling was announced. Respondent made several loud statements as he was being escorted from the courtroom regarding his right to remain in the courtroom and regarding his status as an officer of the Court. Deputy Harville did not testify at hearing.</p>\n<p id=\"b122-7\">\u201c15. Once outside the courtroom, Respondent became increasingly loud and upset. He failed to obey the instruction of Deputy Milam to remain calm. He attempted to re-enter the courtroom in disobedience to Milam\u2019s instruction to remain outside the courtroom until the proceeding was concluded. Respondent\u2019s voice tone became increasingly loud. He asserted his claimed right to be inside the courtroom and demanded re-entry. He threatened to sue. The Respondent made slight, unintentional physical contact with Deputy Milam in his effort to regain entry into the courtroom. Respondent\u2019s purpose in seeking re-entry was not to thank Judge Pearson, but rather to speak with Taylor. Respondent\u2019s testimony in that regard is neither credible nor logical.</p>\n<p id=\"b122-8\">\u201c16. Approximately ten (10) people, including at least one (1) child, gathered in the hallway outside the courtroom to observe Respondent\u2019s interactions with Deputy Milam at the door and subsequently at the arrest location further down the hallway.</p>\n<p id=\"b123-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"93\">*93</page-number>\u201c17. Respondent, immediately before walking away from the Courtroom door to go to the office of the Administrative Judge, directed profane language at Milam, calling him an \u201cass\u201d at which point Respondent was informed that he was under arrest. This was the only use of profanity by Respondent during these events.</p>\n<p id=\"b123-4\">\u201c18. Respondent briskly walked away from Milam and did not heed either repeated advice that he was under arrest or requests to stop. Respondent did not stop. Deputy Milam followed Respondent for approximately thirty (30) to forty (40) yards in the courthouse hallway and forcibly effectuated the arrest. Respondent pulled away from Deputy Milam and was forced to the ground. Respondent struggled. Deputy Milam warned Respondent that if Respondent did not stop his resistance that pepper spray would be used, at which point Respondent stopped any resistance and was placed in handcuffs.</p>\n<p id=\"b123-5\">\u201c19. Respondent was arrested and charged with Disorderly Conduct and with Resisting Arrest.</p>\n<p id=\"b123-6\">\u201c20. Following arrest, Respondent initially refused to provide identifying information and was detained in the courthouse lock-up for approximately twenty (20) minutes until he provided his driver\u2019s license.</p>\n<p id=\"b123-7\">\u201c21. Respondent\u2019s contentions concerning use of unnecessary physical force during his arrest and subsequent processing by courtroom personnel or law enforcement agents are exaggerated. He suffered no credible physical injury.</p>\n<p id=\"b123-8\">\u201c22. Respondent called Deputy Harville a \u201cNazi.\u201d Harville was the sole Caucasian involved in relevant events and all remaining court personnel appear to be African-American. Respondent is African-American.</p>\n<p id=\"b123-9\">\u201c23. The Court finds Milam\u2019s hearing testimony to be somewhat embellished concerning Respondent\u2019s behavior, and further finds his Statement of Probable Cause to be the more accurate recitation of events. The Court finds Wimbush\u2019s testimony to be greatly embellished and that of Harris to be confused as to chronology.</p>\n<p id=\"b124-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"94\">*94</page-number>\u201c24. Criminal charges proceeded to the jury trial in <em>State v. Mahone, </em>CJ10-1582 before The Honorable James Lombardi, Associate Judge of the Prince George\u2019s Circuit Court on September 28, 2010. At the close of the State\u2019s case, Disorderly Conduct and Resisting Arrest charges were dismissed on Motion for Judgment of Acquittal.</p>\n<p id=\"b124-4\">\u201c25. Neither Mahone\u2019s client nor either party engaged in proceedings before Judge Pearson on February 1, 2010 were prejudiced by Respondent\u2019s words or behavior, either in the courtroom or thereafter.</p>\n<p id=\"b124-5\">\u201c26. No actions by Judge Pearson or any courtroom personnel were motivated by, or the result of, racial considerations.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b124-6\">From these Findings of Fact, Judge Quirk concluded that the respondent violated MLRPC 8.4(d), but not MLRPC 8.4(b). With regard to the latter, he concluded, \u201c[bjased upon factual determinations made herein by application of the clear and convincing evidence standard, Bar Counsel has failed to adduce proof sufficient to meet its burden of establishing a Rule 8.4(b) violation.\u201d The facts bearing on this issue were those found in paragraphs 16, in which Judge Quirk determined that the respondent\u2019s \u201cinteractions\u201d with the arresting officer was observed by \u201c[approximately ten (10) people including at least one child,\u201d who \u201cgathered\u201d for that purpose, and 18, in which Judge Quirk concluded that the respondent \u201cdid not heed either repeated advice that he was under arrest or requests to stop,\u201d and when the arresting officer forcibly effectuated the arrest, \u201cpulled away\u201d and \u201cstruggled,\u201d of the Findings of Fact. In drawing that conclusion, Judge Quirk noted the finding of the criminal court trial judge that the State had failed to prove its disturbance of the peace charge, brought pursuant to Maryland Code (2002, 2012 RepLVol.) \u00a7 10 \u2014 201(c)(2)\u2014(3) of the Criminal Law Article (\u201cCL\u201d), and that failure required dismissal of the resisting arrest charge, brought pursuant to CL \u00a7 9-408(b)(l) (2004, 2012 Repl.Vol.). Although recognizing that the criminal disposition is not dis-positive, given the different burdens of proof, Judge Quirk <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"95\">*95</page-number>nevertheless found the criminal court decision to be \u201cnot without consideration or relevance.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b125-4\">Turning to the MLRPC 8.4(d) violation, Judge Quirk\u2019s conclusion that the respondent violated that Rule was premised on the behavior in which he found the respondent to have engaged, both within and outside the courtroom, which he described as \u201cwillful and [engaged] in the actual presence of members of the public, both inside and outside the courtroom.\u201d The offending behavior inside the courtroom consisted of the respondent disrupting the proceedings by, in addition to making multiple attempts to speak to his client during final argument, refusing to keep still or lower his voice and remaining standing after being advised to be seated. This behavior, moreover, Judge Quirk determined, was the basis for the respondent\u2019s removal from the courtroom, which he found to be proper, even though it was done without the specific direction of Judge Pearson.</p>\n<p id=\"b125-5\">Judge Quirk described the behavior in which the respondent engaged once outside the courtroom and which he concluded was prejudicial to the administration of justice as becoming \u201cincreasingly angry and upset;\u201d refusing to heed instructions to remain calm; attempting to re-enter the courtroom; engaging in a \u201cdoor handle tugging match\u201d with the arresting officer, despite being admonished not to do so; and using \u201cloud, inappropriate and profane language in the hallway.\u201d Indeed, it was, as a result of this use of profane language and directing it at the arresting officer, calling him an \u201cass,\u201d that the respondent was arrested.</p>\n<p id=\"b125-6\">Following his arrest, Judge Quirk found that the respondent \u201crefused to heed\u201d the advice that he was under arrest or the command to stop and surrender, instead walking away from the officer. When physically accosted, he struggled and did not cease resistance until threatened with the use of pepper spray. In addition, the respondent\u2019s failure to cooperate, refusing, for a time, to provide identification, calling one of the officers a \u201cNazi\u201d and his \u201cattempt[s] to use his position as an attorney to his benefit, repeatedly stating, Tm an officer of the court\u2019 and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"96\">*96</page-number>threatening to sue while refusing to comply with the explicit directives of the Bailiff and Deputies,\u201d were offered as additional factors in the judge\u2019s conclusion that the respondent acted in a manner prejudicial to the administration of justice.</p>\n<p id=\"b126-5\">Judge Quirk also made findings with regard to factors in mitigation and aggravation, including those findings as \u201cIII. <em>Evidence Regarding Remedial and Mitigating Factors.\u201d </em>Having acknowledged the aggravating factor that the respondent \u201chas previously been reprimanded by the Court of Appeals for courtroom conduct, <em>Atty. Griev. Comm\u2019n. v. Mahone, </em>398 Md. 257[, 920 A.2d 458] (2007), having violated Rule 8.4(d),\u201d he noted that the respondent self-reported his arrest to the petitioner. Judge Quirk also found:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b126-6\">\u201cRespondent\u2019s actions were not caused by any dishonest or selfish motive. He acted, in his estimation, as a zealous advocate for his client in hastening to Upper Marlboro to an unknown proceeding at the invitation of his client\u2019s opponent, to hopefully obtain custody of a two year-old child for his client, who had previously lost custody. His verbal interaction with the Judge was courteous. Upon hearing of Judge Pearson\u2019s letter to the Attorney Grievance Commission, Respondent promptly apologized. Judge Pearson accepted.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b126-7\">\u201cThe matter of <em>State v. Daniel Q. Mahone, </em>CJ 10-1582 in the Circuit Court for Prince George\u2019s County went to trial on September 28, 2010 before The Honorable James Lombardi with a jury. All charges were dismissed at the conclusion of the State\u2019s case upon Respondent\u2019s Maryland Rule 4-324 Motion[.]\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b126-8\">The petitioner took no exceptions to the Findings of Fact; however, it excepts to Judge Quirk\u2019s failure to conclude that the respondent violated MLRPC 8.4(b). The petitioner\u2019s complaint is that Judge Quirk\u2019s findings of fact lead inexorably to the conclusion that the respondent violated CL \u00a7 10-201(c)(2) and (3)<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> and CL \u00a7 9-408(b),<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> which are the underlying bases <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"97\">*97</page-number>for the Rule 8.1(b) violation charge. It reasons that Judge Quirk\u2019s statement on p. 28 of the Findings of Fact and Conclusions of Law, that respondent\u2019s behavior, in and out of the courtroom, was willful and in the actual presence of members of the public, although made in support of his conclusion that the respondent violated MLRPC 8.4(d), was nevertheless a factual finding equally applicable to the Rule 8.4(b) charge. That finding, coupled with the court\u2019s findings set out in finding 14, but especially finding 15, describing the respondent\u2019s refusal to \u201cheed\u201d advice and directions he was given by the arresting officer; finding 16, relating to who was present to witness the interaction and arrest of the respondent; and finding 18, pertaining to the respondent\u2019s response to being placed under arrest, sufficed to establish each of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"98\">*98</page-number>criminal charges and, thus, the predicate for the MLRPC violation. The petitioner concedes, as it must, that no finding was made \u201cthat the members of the public were disturbed,\u201d proffering in view of that omission that \u201clogic requires a conclusion of same.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b128-4\">Acknowledging that Judge Quirk recognized that an acquittal in a criminal trial does not preclude a finding that the attorney violated a disciplinary rule, the petitioner nevertheless believes that he erroneously \u201cconsider[ed] the findings and conclusions of the court in Respondent\u2019s criminal trial.\u201d This belief is based, apparently, on Judge Quirk\u2019s statement, when discussing the Rule 8.4(b) violation, that \u201cJudge Lombardi\u2019s decision is not without consideration or relevance in these proceedings.\u201d The petitioner contends that it is proof that Judge Quirk considered and used that decision to conclude that it did not meet its burden of proof and, as important, that Judge Quirk did not comply with the direction given by Maryland Rule 16-757, to make findings of fact and draw conclusions of law based on the evidence presented and not to draw inferences from collateral matters.</p>\n<p id=\"b128-5\">The petitioner recommends that the respondent be suspended from the practice of law for a period of 90 days. As support for this recommendation, it relies on four aggravating factors: the respondent\u2019s prior discipline; his failure to acknowledge the \u201cwrongful nature of his conduct, specifically, \u201cRespondent has not acknowledged that his intentional use of abusive language towards law enforcement officers assigned to maintain order in the courthouse was inappropriate;\u201d<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> his substantial experience in the practice of law; and the illegal conduct in which the respondent engaged<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> and <em>Attorney Grievance Comm\u2019n. v. Alison, </em>317 Md. 523, 565 A.2d 660 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"99\">*99</page-number>(1989), which it offers as a comparable case for purposes of determining the proper sanction.</p>\n<p id=\"b129-4\">Exceptions were filed by the respondent, as well. His exceptions were not limited to the conclusions of law drawn by Judge Quirk, however. The respondent\u2019s first exception is to the absence of a finding or conclusion. He included in his answer to the disciplinary petition, as a kind of \u201caffirmative defense,\u201d a representation that he had apologized to Judge Pearson, who accepted the apology, thereby indicating that he considered the matter resolved. Noting that Judge Quirk did not make a finding on the point, the respondent contends that he is entitled to a favorable disposition of this matter, as he has \u201csustained his burden by proving \u2018a matter of mitigation or extenuation ... by a preponderance of evidence\u2019 as required by Md. Rule 16-757(b).\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b129-5\">The respondent\u2019s second exception is to \u201cthe Court\u2019s Finding that Petitioner has proved the Averments of the Petition by Clear and Convincing Evidence.\u201d As he sees it,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b129-6\">\u201cThe core allegations in the Petition for Disciplinary or Remedial Action pleading misconduct by the Respondent are those contained in paragraphs six (6), seven (7) and eight (8). An examination of the record reveals that the testimony does not present \u2018clear and convincing evidence\u2019 that Respondent committed the actions described in paragraph six (6), seven (7) and eight (8) of the Petition.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b129-7\">By reference to the transcript, the respondent maintains, as to the allegations in paragraph six (6), that the findings are not supported by the record. He is persuaded by the absence of any reference in the transcript to the loudness of the speech or sound, except on one occasion, when Judge Pearson asked someone, presumably the respondent, to \u201ckeep your voice down a little bit.\u201d As the respondent puts it:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b129-8\">\u201cIn response to this allegation, Respondent contends that the transcript of the proceeding before Judge Pearson ... reveals an absence of any loud speech by Respondent. The allegation of \u2018speaking loudly\u2019 is not supported because loud speech would have been recorded by the court\u2019s stenogra<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"100\">*100</page-number>pher. There is absolutely no indication of any content of the loud speech which allegedly occurred before the court.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AUm\">The respondent also contends that the allegations in paragraph six (6) that he was passing notes to his client and was asked not to do so by \u201cbailiffs and sheriffs\u201d is not supported by the record. For support, he relies on his own testimony to the contrary, that he passed one note and was told by the bailiff that anything passed must go through him, and the testimony of the bailiff that he says asked him not to pass the note, which confirmed his testimony.</p>\n<p id=\"b130-4\">In paragraph seven (7) of the disciplinary petition, it is alleged:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b130-5\">\u201cAfter being removed to the hallway, Respondent had an altercation. He yelled insults at a deputy sheriff, using vulgar language and causing a disturbance.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b130-6\">In challenging the adequacy of the evidence to support these allegations, the respondent relies on his assessment of the testimony of the arresting officer, based on his reading of the transcript of the disciplinary proceedings and that of the criminal trial. He concludes that the arresting officer\u2019s testimony was contradictory, primarily as it related to the disturbance aspect of the matter, the gathering of a crowd, the number of people, its composition, etc., and, therefore, not credible. With regard to the allegation that he used vulgar language and caused a disturbance, the respondent avers, without any specificity:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b130-7\">\u201cThere is no credible evidence that any public citizen was disturbed by Respondent. Finally, Respondent has freely admitted that he utilized the term \u2018ass\u2019 to refer to Deputy Milam. However, the definition of ass is utilized to refer to a stupid person and is a term utilized in everyday speech.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b130-8\">To the allegations of paragraph eight (8), pertaining to resisting arrest, the respondent responds:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b130-9\">\u201cAn examination of the Statement of Probable Cause and Deputy Milam\u2019s testimony of the criminal trial reveals that Respondent was arrested because of pure speech. Moreover, the Bar Investigation concluded that Respondent was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"101\">*101</page-number>arrested because of his statement to Deputy Milam that he was an \u2018ass.\u2019 The arrest in total was illegal and the illegal touching of Respondent by Deputy Harville preceded the illegal arrest by Deputy Milam.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b131-4\">The third exception filed by the respondent is to a finding made by the court during its summarization of the testimony of the various witnesses, in Section 1 B of the Findings of Fact and Conclusions of Law, that the respondent was \u201cescorted\u201d from the courtroom \u201cwhile Judge Pearson was hand-writing the Final Protective Order and before the court announced the Oral Ruling.\u201d He argues that he was in the courtroom and heard the entire oral ruling and was removed when he attempted to approach his client. He maintains that the transcript of the proceedings confirms that is so. The exception is also to the accuracy of the use of the word, \u201cescort,\u201d to describe his removal. On the contrary, the respondent, relying on the arresting officer\u2019s testimony, submits that he was \u201cgrabbed\u201d and walked out.</p>\n<p id=\"b131-5\">The gravamen of the respondent\u2019s fourth exception is a challenge to Judge Quirk\u2019s credibility determination with respect to the arresting officer, Deputy Milam. He notes that Judge Quirk had a number of concerns about the arresting officer\u2019s testimony: his reporting of the sequence of events was confused, and his testimony at the disciplinary proceedings differed, \u201cin pertinent part,\u201d from his testimony at the criminal trial and his written Statement of Probable Cause. Having detailed Judge Quirk\u2019s concerns with the arresting officer\u2019s testimony, which the respondent characterizes as \u201cchameleon-like,\u201d the respondent laments:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b131-6\">\u201cRespondent fails to comprehend how the court can reflect upon Deputy Milam\u2019s having testified against Respondent at the criminal trial and having embellished his testimony and yet credit his testimony in this case. Respondent\u2019s freedom was at stake in the criminal trial and Milam clearly has asserted fictitious details throughout the Respondent\u2019s ordeal with the bar charges and the criminal charges. The question looms large how do you credit any testimony of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"102\">*102</page-number>Deputy Milam when clearly Deputy Milam has no hesitancy to make up details.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b132-5\">Similarly, the respondent\u2019s fifth exception challenges the evidentiary value of the hearing testimony provided by both Deputy Wimbush and Bailiff Harris. In Judge Quirk\u2019s evidentiary summation, contained within his Findings of Fact and Conclusions of Law, the hearing judge described Deputy Wimbush\u2019s hearing testimony pertaining to events that occurred outside of the courtroom as \u201cfar less credible and greatly embellished from the version of events recited in his written statement created on the date of the incident.\u201d Additionally, Judge Quirk described Bailiff Harris\u2019 hearing testimony regarding events that occurred outside of the courtroom as \u201cfar more expansive than, but without inconsistency from, his written version of events contemporaneously made.\u201d<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> Accordingly, the respondent contends that the hearing testimony of both Deputy Wimbush and Bailiff Harris demonstrates a lack of clear and convincing evidence presented by the petitioner.</p>\n<p id=\"b132-6\">In his final exception, without explaining why, the respondent excepts to Judge Quirk\u2019s findings in paragraphs 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 20, 21, 22 and 26. The respondent also challenges, without further elaboration, the refusal to admit his Exhibit 6, which he says contained the admission of a party opponent.</p>\n<p id=\"b132-7\">This Court, in the exercise of its original and complete jurisdiction over attorney disciplinary proceedings, <em>Attorney Grievance Comm\u2019n. v.

As we have seen, the elements of disorderly conduct, proscribed by CL \u00a7 10-201(c)(2) and (3), are well settled.

Subsection (c)(3) requires that the defendant willfully fail to obey a reasonable and lawful order of a law enforcement officer, made to prevent a disturbance of the public peace. With regard to the latter we have made clear:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"Ae\">\u201c[t]he gist of the crime of disorderly conduct under Sec. 123 of Art. 27, as it was in the cases of common law predecessor crimes, is the doing or saying, or both, of that which offends, disturbs, incites, or tends to incite, a number of people gathered in the same area.... [I]t is conduct \u2018of such a nature as to affect the peace and quiet of persons who may witness the same and who may be disturbed or provoked to resentment thereby.\u2019 Also, it has been held that failure to obey a policeman\u2019s command to move on when not to do so may endanger the public peace, amounts to disorderly conduct.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b135-4\"><em>Drews v.

As the petitioner recognizes, however, he did not find that the respondent\u2019s conduct disturbed the public peace, or provoked the members of the public, in whose presence it occurred. Nor does it appear, and the record does not support, that the command to desist was for the purpose of preventing a disturbance of the peace and, in any event, the court did not so find. While there may have been sufficient evidence on the basis of which the judge could have found the required element, his decision not to so find is not clearly erroneous; he was not required to do so and we may not, because logic and our own inclination may lead us to that conclusion, substitute what we would have found, were we the fact-finder, for the facts the fact-finder actually found. <em>State v. Stanley, </em>351 Md. 733, 750, 720 A.2d 323, 331 (1998).</p>\n<p id=\"b136-5\">It is well settled that a person has the right to resist an unlawful arrest. <em>See Dennis, </em>342 Md. at 212, 674 A.2d at 936; <em>Barnhard v.

Accordingly, we also overrule the petitioner\u2019s exception to the failure to find that the respondent resisted a lawful arrest.</p>\n<p id=\"b136-6\">We do not perceive the comments made by Judge Quirk about the criminal case and its findings and ruling to be an abdication of his responsibility in this disciplinary matter to make findings of fact, based on the evidence presented in those proceedings, or as an indication that he relied on the findings and the decision rendered in the criminal case to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"107\">*107</page-number>make his decision. Rather, we accept judge Quirk\u2019s characterization, that the ruling \u201cis consistent as to the proponent, herein Bar Counsel, failing to meet [his] burden of proof.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b137-4\">Turning to the respondent\u2019s exceptions, we agree that Judge Quirk did not directly make a finding in response to the respondent\u2019s suggestion that the case was mooted by the complaining party accepting his tendered apology. Nevertheless, that suggestion was answered, albeit during the discussion of the MLRPC 8.4(d) violation and courtroom security, and clearly so:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b137-5\">\u201cJudge Pearson implicitly allowed his bailiff and the deputies to handle the situation created by Respondent. Respondent\u2019s reliance on the fact that Judge Pearson did not reprimand him or directly order him removed from the courtroom as evidence that his behavior was appropriate is without merit. Furthermore, Respondent has been on specific notice that a judge\u2019s decision not to hold a Respondent in contempt or otherwise censure the Respondent is not a defense.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b137-6\">(Citing <em>Mahone, </em>398 Md. at 268, 920 A.2d at 464). The exception is overruled.</p>\n<p id=\"b137-7\">To prevail on his exceptions pertaining to paragraph 6 of the disciplinary petition, the respondent must show, not simply that the transcript of the proceedings does not reflect the conduct about which the petition complains and the hearing court found, but that it irrefutably would have, had the conduct or behavior actually occurred, and that the findings as to the passing of notes and the refusal to desist when advised to do so were clearly erroneous. The evidence of the transcript that the respondent proffers and on which he exclusively relies to refute the finding that he spoke loudly falls woefully short of the mark. To be sure, the transcript does reflect one reference to the volume of speech. That reference, however, was a statement by Judge Pearson, making a \u201crequest\u201d that the respondent keep his voice down just a little bit. Significantly, before that statement, the transcript does not reflect or report that the respondent was speaking loudly. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"108\">*108</page-number>That, and the fact that, as the respondent concedes, the transcript does not otherwise address the volume at which arguments or statements were made during the proceedings demonstrate the weakness of the respondent\u2019s argument. It follows, therefore, that the transcript simply does not prove what the respondent has offered it to prove.</p>\n<p id=\"b138-4\">With regard to the \u201cpassing of notes\u201d and the respondent\u2019s failure to desist, after being asked not to do so by \u201cbailiffs and deputy sheriffs,\u201d the respondent relies on his testimony that he passed but one note and ceased that activity when told by the bailiff to do so, and the testimony of that bailiff, which confirmed his account. In other words, the respondent posits that Judge Quirk got the credibility call wrong. It is well settled, however, that the court was not obliged to credit the respondent\u2019s testimony or that of the bailiff. <em>Attorney Grievance Comm\u2019n. v.

Accordingly, it is overruled.</p>\n<p id=\"b139-4\">The respondent\u2019s exception 3 is to the findings made by Judge Quirk in Section I B of his Findings of Fact. The one to which he specifically excepts is the finding that \u201cwhile Judge Pearson was hand-writing the Final Protective Order, and before the court announced the Oral Ruling, ... Mahone was escorted from the courtroom ...\u201d As we have seen, however, the findings of fact directly pertinent to the Rules violations found in this case were set out in Section II. Inasmuch as the findings in Section I B are, at best, tangential, and adds little, if anything, to the findings that inform the Rule violations found, this exception, too, is overruled.</p>\n<p id=\"b139-5\">Exception 4 concerns the confusion of the sequence of events as reported by the arresting officer and the recognition of that fact by Judge Quirk, while exception 5 seems only to agree with Judge Quirk that the testimony of Deputy Wimbush was embellished during these proceedings and, therefore, was less credible. Both challenge the ultimate credibility determination of the hearing judge. Indeed, with regard to exception 4, the respondent questions openly, \u201chow do you credit any testimony of Deputy Milam when clearly Deputy Milam has no hesitancy to make up details.\u201d We shall not substitute our judgment for the judgment of Judge Quirk, to whom we delegated the credibility determinations. The exceptions are overruled.</p>\n<p id=\"b139-6\">The respondent\u2019s final exception is, as noted, simply a statement that he excepts to Judge Quirk\u2019s findings in certain paragraphs and to the exclusion of certain evidence he offered. That is the extent of the argument offered in support. We shall overrule the exception.</p>\n<p id=\"b139-7\">We turn now to the consideration of the appropriate sanction.

Moreover, the petitioner\u2019s recommendation depends on a finding of criminal conduct, as its reliance on <em>Alison </em>and its stated conclusion \u2014 that the respondent\u2019s actions \u201cwere disrespectful to the court, disruptive to court administration and in violation of the Maryland Criminal Code\u201d\u2014 demonstrate.</p>\n<p id=\"b141-5\"><em>Alison </em>is not this case. First, we have overruled the petitioner\u2019s exceptions. Therefore, there are no violations of the criminal code or unlawful conduct. Second, Judge Quirk\u2019s mitigation finding, that the respondent\u2019s \u201cverbal interaction with the Judge was courteous\u201d and that he apologized upon learning of the complaint by the judge, belies the petitioner\u2019s conclusion that the respondent was disrespectful to the judge. Third, we do not believe that mounting a defense is the same as refusing to acknowledge wrong-doing. Fourth, this is a single incident, although occurring in two places, that had a duration of minutes, rather than years.</p>\n<p id=\"b141-6\">The respondent\u2019s conduct, as found by Judge Quirk, is not to be condoned, however. That he has once before been reprimanded for in-court or court-related improper conduct disqualifies him for that sanction. A 30 day suspension, effective thirty days from the date of this opinion, we believe, is the appropriate sanction, under these circumstances.</p>\n<p id=\"b141-7\">IT IS SO ORDERED; RESPONDENT SHALL PAY ALL COSTS AS TAXED BY THE CLERK OF THIS <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"112\">*112</page-number>COURT, INCLUDING COSTS OF ALL TRANSCRIPTS, PURSUANT TO MARYLAND RULE 16-671(b), FOR WHICH SUM JUDGMENT IS ENTERED IN FAVOR OF THE ATTORNEY GRIEVANCE COMMISSION AGAINST DANIEL QUINN MAHONE.</p>\n<p id=\"b142-5\">Judge HARRELL joins in the judgment only.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b118-12\">.

As a part of his Findings of Fact and Conclusions of Law, Judge Quirk included, as part I, an Evidentiary Summation, in which he rehearsed, in meticulous detail, the testimony, separated by reference to whether it related to what occurred in the courtroom or what occurred outside the courtroom, of each witness who testified. For each witness, Judge Quirk assessed credibility, both as to the testimony as a whole and as to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"90\">*90</page-number>how it compared with the testimony of other witnesses testifying as to the same subject. For example, as to the arresting officer, Judge Quirk found that his \"testimony regarding behavior outside the courtroom to be somewhat embellished as to Mahone\u2019s alleged behavior\u201d and that \"[\u00a1Inconsistencies in criminal trial testimony and hearing testimony herein depict poor behavior far beyond that behavior alleged in the contemporaneously-written Statement Of Probable Cause.\u201d Nevertheless, after summarizing the respondent's post-courtroom testimony, he found, \u201cMahone's testimony as to post-courtroom events to be less credible than that of Milam.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b126-9\">.
