The district court found that the defendants were each ineligible for relief pursuant to Amendment 750 because they were each sentenced as a career offender. On appeal, the defendants, each of whom received sentences below the career offender guideline range, argue that after the Supreme Court\u2019s decision in <em>Freeman v. United States, </em>\u2014 U.S.-, 131 S.Ct. 2685, 180 L.Ed.2d 519 (2011) (plurality opinion), a career offender sentenced below the career offender guideline range is eligible for a sentence reduction pursuant to 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582(c)(2) and Amendment 750. The government counters that the defendants are ineligible for a \u00a7 3582(c)(2) sentence reduction because, as career offenders, their guideline ranges would have been the same if the amended guideline had been in effect at the time of their sentencing. After careful consideration,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> we reject the defendants\u2019 argument and affirm the district court\u2019s denial of their \u00a7 3582(c)(2) motions.</p>\n<p id=\"b592-27\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b592-28\">In <em>United States v. Moore, </em>we held that \u00a7 3582(c)(2) does not authorize a sentence reduction when a retroactively applicable guideline range amendment does not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"571\">*571</page-number>change the guideline range upon which a defendant\u2019s sentence was based. 541 F.3d 1323, 1330 (11th Cir.2008). Thus, even when an amendment reduces the base offense level applicable to a defendant, the amendment does not apply to a defendant sentenced as a career offender because it does not affect the defendant\u2019s guideline range. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b593-5\">After our decision in <em>Moore, </em>a plurality of the Supreme Court in <em>Freeman v. United States </em>decided that defendants who entered into a Federal Rule of Criminal Procedure 11(c)(1)(C) plea agreement are eligible to seek \u00a7 3582(c)(2) relief when the sentence contained in a plea agreement was based on a guideline range that was later subject to a retroactive amendment. 131 S.Ct. at 2690 (plurality opinion). We have explained that <em>Freeman </em>did not disturb our holding in <em>Moore </em>because the Supreme Court\u2019s decision in <em>Freeman </em>did not address \u201cdefendants [who] were assigned a base offense level under one guideline section, but then assigned a total offense level and guideline range under a different guideline section.\u201d <em>Lawson, </em>686 F.3d at 1321. Because <em>Moore </em>\u201cremains binding precedent,\u201d <em>id., </em>we are compelled to reject the defendants\u2019 argument that <em>Freeman </em>should be read to undermine <em>Moore.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b593-6\">We are also compelled to reject the defendants\u2019 argument that <em>Moore </em>does not apply to them because they each received sentences below th\u00e9 career offender guideline range. Because the defendants are career offenders, their guideline range was based on \u00a7 4B1.1 of the United States Sentencing Guidelines. <em>See id. </em>at 1319. That they each received a sentence reduction based on substantial assistance to law enforcement does not alter the fact that their guideline ranges were based on \u00a7 4B1.1. In fact, one of the defendants in <em>Moore </em>also received a sentence reduction based on substantial assistance, and we found that he was ineligible for \u00a7 3582(c)(2) relief because there was no \u201cindication that the court based [his] sentence on the guideline range that would have applied absent the career offender designation\u201d or that the reduction in his sentence lowered his sentencing range. <em>Moore, </em>541 F.3d at 1330. Here, because the defendants\u2019 guideline ranges were based on \u00a7 4B1.1, \u00a7 3582(c)(2) does not authorize a reduction in their sentences. <em>See Lawson, </em>686 F.3d at 1321.</p>\n<p id=\"b593-8\">For these reasons, the decisions of the district court are AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b592-20\">. \"We review <em>de novo </em>a district court\u2019s conclusions about the scope of its legal authority under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582(c)(2).\u201d <em>United States v.
