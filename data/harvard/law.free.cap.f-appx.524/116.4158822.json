Williams appeals the district court\u2019s denial of his 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582(c)(2) motion to reduce his sentence based on amendments to the Sentencing Guidelines for crack cocaine offenses. Because his appeal is foreclosed by <em>United States v. Carter, </em>595 F.3d 575 (5th Cir.2010), we AFFIRM.</p>\n<p id=\"b139-16\">BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b139-17\">In 2006, Williams pleaded guilty to conspiracy to possess with intent to deliver more than 50 grams or more of crack cocaine in violation of 21 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 841(a)(1) and 846. Williams\u2019 guidelines sentencing range was 121 to 151 months of imprisonment, but he was subject to a mandatory minimum term of imprisonment of 240 months for his prior felony drug conviction. Prior to sentencing, the Government filed a \u00a7 3553(e) motion for a sentencing reduction for his substantial assistance to authorities. The district court granted the motion and sentenced Williams to 132 months of imprisonment.</p>\n<p id=\"b139-18\">In 2008, Williams filed a <em>pro se </em>motion for a reduction of sentence under \u00a7 3582(c)(2) based on amendments to the Sentencing Guidelines, which lowered the offense levels for most crack cocaine offenses. The district court denied the motion on the basis that the court had already reduced his sentence below the statutory minimum. On appeal, we affirmed the district court\u2019s judgment, noting that \u201cwhen a defendant is subject to a statutory minimum sentence above the upper end of his guideline range, even if <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"118\">*118</page-number>the district court departs downwardly from that minimum under a statutory exception, 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 8582(c)(2) provides no authority to the district court to later modify the sentence based on amendments to the guideline range.\u201d <em>United States v. Williams, </em>378 Fed.Appx. 488, 489 (5th Cir.2010) (per curiam) (citing <em>United States v. Carter, </em>595 F.3d 575, 581 (5th Cir.2010)).</p>\n<p id=\"b140-4\">In 2010, after the passage of the Fair Sentencing Act (\u201cFSA\u201d), Williams again moved for a sentencing reduction under \u00a7 3553(e). The district court denied the motion, and Williams, through the Federal Public Defender, timely appealed.</p>\n<p id=\"b140-5\">STANDARD OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b140-6\">We review a district court\u2019s decision whether to reduce a sentence under \u00a7 3582(c)(2) for abuse of discretion. <em>United States v. Evans, </em>587 F.3d 667, 672 (5th Cir.2009).</p>\n<p id=\"b140-7\">ANALYSIS</p>\n<p id=\"b140-8\">Section 3582(c)(2) permits the discretionary modification of a defendant\u2019s sentence if he \u201chas been sentenced to a term of imprisonment based on a sentencing range that has subsequently been lowered by the Sentencing Commission\u201d and \u201csuch a reduction is consistent with applicable policy statements issued by the Sentencing Commission.\u201d 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582(c)(2). If a defendant is eligible for a sentence modification under \u00a7 3582(c)(2), the district court weighs the applicable \u00a7 3553(a) factors to decide whether a reduction \u201cis warranted in whole or in part under the particular circumstances of the case.\u201d <em>Dillon v. United States, </em>560 U.S. 817, 130 S.Ct. 2683, 2692, 177 L.Ed.2d 271 (2010).</p>\n<p id=\"b140-9\">Where, as here, a defendant is \u201csubject to a statutory minimum sentence above the upper end of his guidelines range, even if the district court departs downwardly from that minimum under a statutory exception, 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582(c)(2) provides no authority to the district court to later modify the sentence based on amendments to the guideline range.\u201d <em>United States v. Carter, </em>595 F.3d 575, 581 (5th Cir.2010); <em>see also United States v. Anderson, </em>591 F.3d 789, 791 (5th Cir.2009) (holding that a prisoner sentenced as a career offender similarly was ineligible for a sentence reduction under \u00a7 3582(c)(2)). Williams contends that <em>Carter </em>is irreconcilable with <em>Freeman v. United States, </em>\u2014 U.S.-, 131 S.Ct. 2685, 2692-95, 180 L.Ed.2d 519 (2011), a case in which a plurality of the Supreme Court concluded that defendants who enter into plea agreements under Rule 11(c)(1)(C) that specify a particular sentence are eligible for relief under \u00a7 3582(c)(2). But, as we have explained previously, <em>\u201cFreeman </em>did not address, even tangentially, either of the factual scenarios presented in <em>Carter </em>or <em>Anderson </em>and its reasoning does not apply to the situation presented here. <em>United States v. Barber, </em>517 Fed.Appx. 270, 272, No. 12-30141, 2013 WL 1197919, at *2 (5th Cir. Mar. 25, 2013) (affirming district court\u2019s denial of defendant\u2019s motion for sentence reduction on that basis that his sentence was \u201cbased on\u201d a statutory mandatory minimum and not on a sentencing range that subsequently has been lowered).</p>\n<p id=\"b140-13\">CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b140-14\"><em>Carter </em>remains good law after <em>Freeman, </em>and, applied here, renders Williams ineligible for a sentence reduction under \u00a7 3582(c)(2). We AFFIRM.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b139-12\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
