United States, </em>No. 11-CV-0891, 2012 WL 4465237 (Fed.Cl. Sept. 26, 2012). We <em>affirm.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b826-13\">Background</p>\n<p id=\"b826-14\">McKenzie is currently incarcerated in the Federal Correctional Institution in Danbury, Connecticut. In 2011, McKenzie filed three administrative tort claims with the Federal Bureau of Prisons (\u201cBureau\u201d), seeking a total of $26 million in damages. Her first claim alleged a \u201cpublic nuisance,\u201d consisting of \u201cabnormally unsanitary conditions [caused] by being exposed to facets [sic] (five) that gives [sic] off a vile odor through out [her prison housing unit].\u201d She further alleged that the \u201cpublic nuisance has created a private right [by] causpng] a significant harm that is [of] a continuous tortious nature.\u201d McKenzie\u2019s subsequent claims sought damages for \u201c[r]etaliation [t]hrough [t]he [a]buse [o]f [\u0440] rocess [d]ue [t]o [her][p]ending [t]ort [\u0441] laims,\u201d and \u201c[i]ntentional [i]nfliction [o]f [e]motional [distress.\u201d The Bureau denied each of McKenzie\u2019s tort claims, finding that she did not state a claim under the Federal Tort Claims Act (\u201cFTCA\u201d), 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1346(b). The letters denying McKenzie\u2019s claims each stated that she could seek further review by \u201cbringfing] an action against the United States in an appropriate United States District Court.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b826-18\">Instead, McKenzie brought suit in the Claims Court, asserting jurisdiction under the Tucker Act, 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1491. The court dismissed for lack of jurisdiction, finding that it did not have jurisdiction over tort claims and that all of McKenzie\u2019s claims sounded in tort. <em>McKenzie, </em>No. 11-CV-0891 (slip op. at 4).</p>\n<p id=\"b826-19\">McKenzie timely appealed. We have jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1295(a)(3).</p>\n<p id=\"b826-20\">Discussion</p>\n<p id=\"b826-21\">We review the Claims Court\u2019s jurisdictional conclusion de novo. <em>Todd Constr., L.P. v. United States, </em>656 F.3d 1306, 1310 (Fed.Cir.2011).</p>\n<p id=\"b826-22\">The Tucker Act limits the Claims Court\u2019s jurisdiction to \u201ccases not sounding in tort.\u201d 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1491(a)(1); <em>see also Trauma Serv. Grp. v. United States, </em>104 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"638\">*638</page-number>F.3d 1321, 1327 (Fed.Cir.1997). McKenzie\u2019s claims here \u2014 public nuisance, abuse of process, and intentional infliction of emotional distress \u2014 are all textbook examples of causes of action that sound in tort. <em>See Prosser and Keeton on the Law of Torts </em>\u00a7\u00a7 12, 90, 121 (W. Page Keeton gen. ed., 5th ed.1984). Thus, the Claims Court correctly found that McKenzie\u2019s claims fell outside of its Tucker Act jurisdiction.</p>\n<p id=\"b827-4\">McKenzie appears to argue that 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 4042, which requires the Bureau to \u201cprovide suitable quarters [for] all persons charged with or convicted of offenses against the United States,\u201d constitutes a contract between the United States and the Bureau as to which she is a third-party beneficiary. However, a federal agency\u2019s breach of statutory duties is not itself a breach of contract. <em>See Scott Timber Co. v. United States, </em>333 F.3d 1358, 1369 (Fed.Cir.2003). Here, as the Bureau\u2019s letters to McKenzie correctly indicated, the remedy for a breach of the Bureau\u2019s statutory duties is a suit in federal district court under the FTCA. <em>See United States v. Muniz, </em>374 U.S. 150, 164-65, 83 S.Ct. 1850, 10 L.Ed.2d 805 (1963).</p>\n<p id=\"b827-5\">We therefore affirm the Claims Court\u2019s dismissal of McKenzie\u2019s complaint.</p>\n<p id=\"b827-6\">AFFIRMED</p>\n<p id=\"b827-7\">Costs</p>\n<p id=\"b827-8\">No costs.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
