Eugene Costa was injured at a Sam\u2019s Club store when an employee dislodged a box containing a television that then fell on Costa\u2019s leg. Costa complained that Sam\u2019s Club was responsible for the negligence of its employee, and Sam\u2019s Club removed the complaint to the district court based on diversity of citizenship. 28 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1332(a), 1441. Costa died before trial, and the district court granted a motion to substitute Costa\u2019s wife, Eva, as the personal representative of his estate. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"550\">*550</page-number>A jury found Sam\u2019s Club liable for Costa\u2019s injuries. Sam\u2019s Club argues that the district court erred by applying the law of negligence instead of premises liability and by admitting portions of the deposition of Costa\u2019s treating physician about the effect of Costa\u2019s injury on his health. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b572-4\">The undisputed evidence established that Costa was injured while having his television inspected by an employee of Sam\u2019s Club. As the employee attempted to connect the television to an antenna post, the employee dislodged from a shelf a box containing another television. The box fell on Costa\u2019s left leg and caused a hematoma and severe swelling. Costa, who suffered from heart disease, developed acute renal failure associated with the hematoma and his health continued to deteriorate. Costa later died of congestive heart failure.</p>\n<p id=\"b572-5\">This appeal is governed by two standards of review. We review <em>de novo </em>the denial of a motion for a judgment as a matter of law. <em>Chaney v. City of Orlando, </em>483 F.3d 1221, 1227 (11th Cir.2007). We review the denial of a motion for a new trial for abuse of discretion. <em>Lamonica v. Safe Hurricane Shutters, Inc., </em>711 F.3d 1299, 1312 (11th Cir.2013). Under that standard, \u201c[o]ur review of the district court\u2019s decision to admit [expert] testimony is very limited.\u201d <em>Maiz v. Virani, </em>253 F.3d 641, 662 (11th Cir.2001). \u201cOur cases, consistent with Rule 61 of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, hold that a new trial is warranted only where [an] error has caused substantial prejudice to the affected party (or, stated somewhat differently, affected the party\u2019s \u2018substantial rights\u2019 or resulted in \u2018substantial injustice\u2019).\u201d <em>Peat, Inc. v. Vanguard Research, Inc., </em>378 F.3d 1154, 1162 (11th Cir.2004) (internal footnote omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b572-6\">The district court did not err by instructing the jury to apply the law of negligence instead of premises liability. Under Alabama law, which the parties agree applies, \u201cnegligence principles are applicable when the landowner\u2019s active conduct, rather than the condition of the land, causes the injury[.]\u201d <em>Baldwin v. Gartman, </em>604 So.2d 347, 348 (Ala.1992) (citing <em>Orr v. Turney, </em>535 So.2d 150 (Ala.1988)); <em>see also Lilya v. Greater Gulf State Fair, Inc., </em>855 So.2d 1049, 1053 (Ala.2003); <em>Powell v. Piggly Wiggly Ala. Distrib. Co., Inc., </em>60 So.3d 921, 924 (Ala.Civ.App.2010). The undisputed evidence at trial established that Costa\u2019s injury was caused by the active conduct of an employee of Sam\u2019s Club instead of a dangerous condition in the store. When the employee dislodged the box from the shelf, he created a danger to Costa that was \u201cindependent and distinct from the condition of the premises,\u201d <em>see Baldwin, </em>604 So.2d at 349 (quoting <em>Orr, </em>535 So.2d at 154), and made \u201cordinary negligence the standard to be applied,\u201d see <em>id. </em>The district court did not err in refusing to instruct the jury to apply the law of premises liability. <em>See Gowski v. Peake, </em>682 F.3d 1299, 1315 (11th Cir.2012) (\u201cThe purpose of jury instructions is to give the jury a clear and concise statement of the law applicable to the facts of the case.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b572-8\">Sam\u2019s Club argues that the law of negligence does not apply to an invitee like Costa, but we disagree. As the Supreme Court of Alabama explained in <em>Orr, </em>if \u201cthe affirmative conduct of the landowner, rather than the condition of his premises, ... causes the injury,\u201d then \u201cthe justifications for determining liability based upon the classification of the injured party (which, while perhaps anachronistic, are yet viable in Alabama) do not attach.\u201d 535 So.2d at 152. After Orr, Alabama courts have continued to determine the applicable law based on the cause of the injury. In <em>Baldwin, </em>an invitee was injured when he was struck by a slab of concrete knocked off a dolly by the landowner\u2019s son. 604 So.2d at 348, 350. The Supreme Court of Alabama held that the tort claim was governed by <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"551\">*551</page-number>the law of premises liability because the landowner had created a dangerous condition on his land. <em>Id. </em>at 349. But, the court explained, \u201c[h]ad [the landowner] ... bumped the slab and caused it to fall, his conduct, distinct from his status as landowner, could then be said to have caused the injury and could be evaluated by an ordinary negligence standard.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Similarly, in <em>Lilya, </em>when an invitee at a fair sued for injuries caused by a mechanical bull, the Supreme Court of Alabama determined that the issue \u201cwhether the duty owed ... by Gulf State Fair should be extracted from general principles of negligence or of premises liability\u201d turned on \u201cwhether the injury was caused by some affirmative conduct of the landowner or by a condition of the premises.\u201d 855 So.2d at 1053. And recently in <em>Powell, </em>the Court of Civil Appeals applied the law of negligence to determine whether Piggly Wiggly was liable when a warehouse employee struck a visitor with a forklift. 60 So.3d at 924-26. Costa\u2019s status as an invitee did not affect the decision whether to apply the law of negligence.</p>\n<p id=\"b573-5\">The district court also did not abuse its discretion by admitting portions of the video deposition of Dr. Michael O\u2019Dowd to explain Costa\u2019s injury and how the accident affected his health. Under Alabama law, Costa\u2019s estate had to prove that he suffered \u201can injury or damage resulting from the ... conduct\u201d of the Sam\u2019s Club employee. <em>See Cook\u2019s Pest Control, Inc. v. Rebar, </em>28 So.3d 716, 725 (Ala.2009). Dr. O\u2019Dowd, Costa\u2019s cardiologist and treating physician, testified that Costa was \u201calways a little ill\u201d because he suffered from coronary heart disease, the hematoma caused him to \u201cdevelop[ ] acute renal failure\u201d and \u201cdeteriorate,\u201d and \u201ceventually he just died from heart failure.\u201d <em>See </em>Fed.R.Evid. 702(a). Sam\u2019s Club argues that Dr. O\u2019Dowd\u2019s statements that Costa\u2019s health deteriorated more quickly after his injury was unduly prejudicial, under Federal Rule of Evidence 403, but the probative value of those statements outweighed their possible prejudicial effect. Costa\u2019s estate was entitled to recover \u201ccompensatory damages to compensate for [Costa\u2019s] expenses and losses incurred up to ... [his] death,\u201d and could introduce evidence to explain the full extent of Cos-ta\u2019s physical injuries. <em>See King v. Nat\u2019l Spa and Pool Inst., Inc., </em>607 So.2d 1241, 1248 (Ala.1992). And the district court was careful to exclude any evidence that was unduly prejudicial. Before trial, the district court examined Dr. O\u2019Dowd\u2019s testimony and excluded statements suggesting that Costa\u2019s injury caused or contributed to his death. Sam\u2019s Club was not substantially prejudiced by Dr. O\u2019Dowd\u2019s testimony that Costa\u2019s injury was debilitating. <em>See Vanguard Research, </em>378 F.3d at 1162.</p>\n<p id=\"b573-7\">We AFFIRM the judgment in favor of Costa\u2019s estate.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
