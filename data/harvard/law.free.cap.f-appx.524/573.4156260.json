Collins argues that the district court erred in determining it did not have jurisdiction to consider his motion, the government waived its discretion in filing the Rule 35(b) motion when a DEA agent made an oral promise to file the motion for him, and the government is bound by the oral contract created by that DEA agent.</p>\n<p id=\"b595-20\">Under Federal Rule of Criminal Procedure 35(b), the district court may reduce a defendant\u2019s sentence if \u201cthe defendant, after sentencing, provided substantial assistance in investigating or prosecuting another person\u201d and the government files a motion requesting such relief. Fed.R.Crim.P. 35(b). The government has the power, but not the duty, to file a substantial assistance motion. <em>See Wade v. United States, </em>504 U.S. 181, 185, 112 S.Ct. 1840, 1843, 118 L.Ed.2d 524 (1992) (discussing prosecutorial discretion and substantial assistance motions under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(e)) and U.S.S.G. \u00a7 5K1.1; <em>United States v. McNeese, </em>547 F.3d 1307, 1308 (11th Cir.2008) (per curiam) (applying <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"574\">*574</page-number><em>Wade </em>to a Rule 35(b) motion). The government enjoys \u201cvirtually unfettered discretion\u201d in deciding whether to file a Rule 35 motion. <em>Murphy v. United States, </em>634 F.3d 1303, 1313 (11th Cir.2011). The Supreme Court\u2019s decision in <em>Wade </em>\u2014 not principles of contract law \u2014 controls review of governmental discretion in filing sentence reduction motions. <em>United States v. Forney, </em>9 F.3d 1492, 1503 n. 3 (11th Cir.1993).</p>\n<p id=\"b596-4\">The district court may only review the government\u2019s refusal to file if the defendant first makes \u201can allegation <em>and </em>a substantial showing\u201d that the refusal was based upon an unconstitutional motive, such as race or religion. <em>United States v. Dorsey, </em>554 F.3d 958, 961 (11th Cir.2009) (emphasis in original) (internal quotation marks omitted) (citing <em>Forney, </em>9 F.3d at 1502). \u201cA defendant who merely claims to have provided substantial assistance or who makes only generalized allegations of an improper motive is not entitled to a remedy or to even an evidentiary hearing.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b596-5\">Under the All Writs Act, federal courts may issue \u201call writs necessary or appropriate in aid of their respective jurisdictions and agreeable to the usages and principles of law.\u201d 28 U.S.C \u00a7 1651. A district court has original jurisdiction to \u201ccompel an officer or employee of the United States or any agency thereof to perform a duty owed to the plaintiff.\u201d 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1361. Mandamus is a drastic remedy, to be invoked only in extraordinary situations. <em>In re BellSouth Corp., </em>334 F.3d 941, 953 (11th Cir.2003).</p>\n<p id=\"b596-6\">We review a district court\u2019s denial of a motion for a writ of mandamus for abuse of discretion. <em>In re Stewart, </em>641 F.3d 1271, 1275 (11th Cir.2011) (per curiam). A writ of mandamus \u201cis only appropriate when: (1) the plaintiff has a clear right to the relief requested; (2) the defendant has a clear duty to act; and (3) no other adequate remedy is available.\u201d <em>Cash v. Barnhart, </em>327 F.3d 1252, 1258 (11th Cir.2003) (per curiam) (internal quotation marks and alteration omitted). Said differently, a plaintiff must show that \u201che has exhausted all other avenues of relief\u2019 and \u201cthe defendant owes him a clear nondiscre-tionary duty.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(internal quotation marks omitted). The party seeking the writ of mandamus must establish that his or her right to the writ\u2019s issuance is \u201cclear and indisputable.\u201d <em>Will v. United States, </em>389 U.S. 90, 96, 88 S.Ct. 269, 274, 19 L.Ed.2d 305 (1967) (internal quotation marks omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b596-8\">Collins has failed to make the required threshold showing that the government acted with an unconstitutional motive when it refused to file a Rule 35(b) motion on his behalf. Accordingly, the district court did not abuse its discretion in denying Collins\u2019s petition.</p>\n<p id=\"b596-9\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
