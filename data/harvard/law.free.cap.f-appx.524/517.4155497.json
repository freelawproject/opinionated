After review, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b540-18\">I. BACKGROUND FACTS<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b540-19\">In August 2010, plaintiff Oretsky bought a new Maserati Quattroporte vehicle for approximately $110,000 from a dealership. Immediately after purchasing the Maserati, plaintiff Oretsky called Infinity and asked an Infinity agent to obtain the same insurance coverage for the Maserati as for Oretsky\u2019s other vehicles, which were insured under Infinity\u2019s standard automobile policy. The insurance agent faxed Oret-sky the insurance forms and documents, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"519\">*519</page-number>indicating with handwritten arrows the places Oretsky had to sign or initial. Without reading any of the forms or documents, Oretsky signed and initialed them, and faxed them back to the insurance agent. At the agent\u2019s request, Oretsky also emailed Infinity photographs of his Maserati.</p>\n<p id=\"b541-5\">Because Oretsky did not read the policy documents, he did not know that the insurance policy he actually obtained on the Maserati was not a standard auto policy, but a \u201cClassic Collector\u2019s\u201d policy, generally intended for classic or exotic vehicles.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> As described in more detail below, this policy placed certain restrictions on vehicle usage, requiring, among other things, that the car (1) be kept in a locked garage when not in use; (2) not be driven more than 5,000 miles a year; and (3) not be used for backup transportation.</p>\n<p id=\"b541-6\">Believing that his Maserati was covered by a standard auto policy, Oretsky did not comply with all the policy restrictions. For example, he used the car for general purposes, such as golfing, going out to dinner, or \u201ctraveling around town.\u201d For the first year he owned the Maserati, Oret-sky drove approximately 13,000 miles in the car. Although Oretsky usually parked the Maserati in a locked garage attached to his residence, he occasionally would leave the car in the driveway overnight if he had to drive somewhere early in the morning. As Oretsky explained at his deposition, he left the car outside because the Maserati had \u201cspecial mufflers\u201d that made a lot of noise, and he did not want to wake his son sleeping in the house.</p>\n<p id=\"b541-7\">On July 20, 2011, nearly a year after purchasing the Maserati, Oretsky picked up the car after service at the dealership. Upon arriving home, Oretsky parked it in his driveway in front of the garage. Oret-sky intended to drive the Maserati to a restaurant that evening, and he left the keys on a table inside the garage in plain view. Oretsky\u2019s plans later changed, and he decided to stay home for the night. Before going to bed, Oretsky did not park the car inside the garage, and did not bring the keys inside the house. Thus, the car remained parked in the driveway during the night, with the keys still on the table inside the garage.</p>\n<p id=\"b541-10\">Early on the morning of July 21, 2010, Oretsky discovered that his Maserati was stolen and that the keys inside the garage had disappeared. There was no damage to the garage doors, and no other signs of a forcible entry, even though the entrances from the garage to the outside remained locked throughout the night. Upon discovering the theft, Oretsky immediately called the police and filed a police report, but neither the thieves nor the Maserati were found.</p>\n<p id=\"b541-11\">Oretsky also contacted Infinity, seeking reimbursement for the Maserati pursuant to the insurance policy. After investigating the theft and questioning Oretsky, Infinity denied coverage for the Maserati. In its denial letter, Infinity explained that Oretsky violated the terms of the insurance policy by failing to keep the Maserati \u201cinside a fully enclosed garage at the time it was stolen from [his] residence.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b541-12\">II. THE INSURANCE POLICY</p>\n<p id=\"b541-13\">A. Insurance Application</p>\n<p id=\"b541-14\">When Oretsky requested insurance on the Maserati, Infinity\u2019s insurance agent <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"520\">*520</page-number>faxed him a form entitled \u201cApplicant Questionnaire.\u201d This questionnaire contained arrows, handwritten by the agent, pointing to places where Oretsky had to sign or initial.</p>\n<p id=\"b542-4\">One section on the questionnaire, entitled \u201cProgram Requirements,\u201d contained six statements that Oretsky was required to initial. This section provided:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b542-5\">(INITIAL INDICATING THAT YOU WILL COMPLY WITH THESE REQUIREMENTS.)</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b542-7\">1. _Each licensed driver in household has a regularly daily-use vehicle.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b542-9\">3. _Vehicles insured under this policy will be kept in a permanent enclosed and locked garage at all times when not in use.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b542-11\">5. _Vehicles usage will not exceed the mileage plan selected.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b542-13\">6. _Vehicles insured under this policy will not be used for commuting to work or school, business use, daily transportation or as a substitute for another auto.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b542-15\">Oretsky placed his initials on the blanks next to each statement.</p>\n<p id=\"b542-16\">B. Declarations Page</p>\n<p id=\"b542-17\">The declarations page of the policy, titled \u201cDeclarations \u2014 Classic Collectors,\u201d named the Maserati as the insured vehicle and provided for a \u201cmileage plan\u201d of 5,000 miles. The declarations page also listed, by number, various applicable \u201cEndorsements\u201d that were then described in the main body of the policy. These endorsements supplied changes or additions to the general provisions listed in the main body of the policy.</p>\n<p id=\"b542-18\">C. Collectible Vehicle Endorsement</p>\n<p id=\"b542-19\">One of the endorsements listed on the declarations page was the Collectible Vehicle Endorsement (\u201cCV Endorsement\u201d). The CV Endorsement, which also cross-referenced the vehicle listed on the declarations page (the Maserati), changed the general policy provisions in several pertinent ways.</p>\n<p id=\"b542-20\">First, the CV Endorsement redefined the term \u201cyour covered auto\u201d as \u201c[a]ny vehicle shown in the policy Declarations\u201d that \u201calso meet[s] the terms of acceptable vehicle usage as defined in Section F.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b542-21\">The CV Endorsement also changed the definition of \u201cnewly acquired auto\u201d as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b542-22\">K. newly acquired auto means any of the following types of vehicles you become an owner of during the policy period:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b542-23\">1. A collectible vehicle for which no other insurance policy provides coverage. ...</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b542-24\">The CV Endorsement then added the following definitions:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b542-25\">L. Collectible vehicle means an antique, Classic, modified or exotic vehicle.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b542-26\">P. Exotic vehicle means a private passenger vehicle or truck which:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b542-27\">1. Is not mechanically or cosmetically altered from its original condition.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b542-28\">2. Is manufactured as a limited production vehicle.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b542-29\">The CV Endorsement further changed \u201cPart F \u2014 General Provisions\u201d of the main policy by adding the following provision imposing restrictions on usage of \u201cyour covered auto\u201d:</p>\n<p id=\"b542-30\">\u25a0 ACCEPTABLE VEHICLE USAGE</p>\n<p id=\"b543-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"521\">*521</page-number>In consideration of the premiums charged under this policy, you agree that your covered auto:</p>\n<p id=\"b543-5\">1. will be used for exhibitions, club activities, parades, [and] other functions of public interest or an occasional pleasure drive;</p>\n<p id=\"b543-6\">2. will be kept in a completely enclosed, locked, and permanent garaging facility when not in use [hereinafter, the \u201cgarage requirement\u201d];</p>\n<p id=\"b543-7\">3. will not be driven more than the mileage plan selected during the policy period, and;</p>\n<p id=\"b543-8\">4. will not be used for:</p>\n<p id=\"b543-9\">a. backup transportation</p>\n<p id=\"b543-10\">b. commuting (driving to and from school or work);</p>\n<p id=\"b543-11\">c. business or commercial purposes;</p>\n<p id=\"b543-12\">d. any utility use including towing, hauling, or off road use;</p>\n<p id=\"b543-13\">e. participating in, practicing or testing for any racing, speed contest, time trial or track event of any kind.</p>\n<p id=\"b543-14\">Violation of above limitations without prior consent or acknowledgment from the company void[s] all coverage provided under this policy.</p>\n<p id=\"b543-15\">III. PROCEDURAL HISTORY</p>\n<p id=\"b543-16\">A. Complaint and Motions for Summary Judgment</p>\n<p id=\"b543-17\">Oretsky sued Infinity in Florida state court for breach of the insurance contract, and attached the insurance policy to his complaint. Based on diversity jurisdiction, Infinity removed the lawsuit to the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Florida.</p>\n<p id=\"b543-18\">After discovery, Infinity moved for summary judgment. Infinity argued that coverage was rightfully denied because Oret-sky violated three terms of the insurance policy by (1) failing to keep the Maserati in a locked garage when the car was not in use; (2) driving the Maserati more than the allotted 5,000 miles per year; and (3) using the Maserati as his primary means of transportation.</p>\n<p id=\"b543-20\">Oretsky responded to Infinity\u2019s motion and filed his own motion for summary judgment, raising five main arguments as to why Infinity wrongly denied coverage. First, Oretsky contended that the CV Endorsement, which contained the pertinent restrictions on vehicle usage, did not apply to the Maserati because the Maserati was not a \u201ccollectible\u201d vehicle as defined in the policy. Second, Oretsky argued that the garage requirement did not bar coverage because the Maserati was \u201cin use\u201d at the time it was stolen, and, alternatively, the term \u201cnot in use\u201d was ambiguous and should be construed against Infinity. Third, Infinity was not prejudiced by the alleged breach of the garage requirement because the Maserati would have been stolen even if it was parked in the garage, given that the thieves broke into the garage anyway to steal the keys. Fourth, Infinity should be estopped from raising any defense to coverage other than Oret-sky\u2019s alleged violation of the garage requirement, as Infinity did not mention any other grounds for denying coverage in its initial denial letter. Fifth, Oretsky contended that the mileage limitation provision was unenforceable because the policy contained no references to the 5,000 mile limit other than on the declarations page.</p>\n<p id=\"b543-21\">B. District Court\u2019s Order</p>\n<p id=\"b543-22\">The district court granted summary judgment in favor of Infinity. The district court determined that the CV Endorsement unambiguously applied to the Maserati because the insurance policy\u2019s declarations page expressly referenced the CV Endorsement, and the CV Endorsement, in turn, expressly referenced the vehicle <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"522\">*522</page-number>listed on the declarations page, i.e., the Maserati. Thus, the Maserati did not have to be a \u201ccollectible\u201d vehicle for the endorsement to apply. The district court also observed that Oretsky must have known of the restrictions on the use of the Maserati, as those restrictions were listed on the insurance application that he signed and initialed.</p>\n<p id=\"b544-4\">As to the garage requirement, the district court concluded that the term \u201cwhen not in use\u201d was not ambiguous, and that Oretsky\u2019s Maserati was not \u201cin use\u201d when it was stolen, which meant that Oretsky breached the policy by failing to keep the Maserati inside the garage. The district court reasoned that leaving the Maserati parked in the driveway overnight was not merely incidental to the car\u2019s use, and was not a temporary stop.</p>\n<p id=\"b544-5\">Regarding prejudice, the district court determined that Infinity did not need to show prejudice under Florida law because (1) the garage requirement was a condition precedent to coverage, rather than a condition subsequent; and (2) the insurance policy expressly voided coverage if the policy requirements were violated. In any event, the district court concluded, Infinity had shown prejudice because the theft of the Maserati would have been less likely had Oretsky kept it inside the garage.</p>\n<p id=\"b544-6\">The district court further determined that, in addition to violating the garage requirement, Oretsky breached the condition that the Maserati not be used for backup transportation. The district court rejected Oretsky\u2019s argument that Infinity had waived, or should be estopped from using, this defense. The district court explained, <em>inter alia, </em>that Infinity expressly reserved all of its defenses prior to suit, and also raised the backup-transportation defense in its answer to Oretsky\u2019s complaint.</p>\n<p id=\"b544-9\">IV. DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b544-10\">A. Applicability of the Collectible Vehicle Endorsement</p>\n<p id=\"b544-11\">On appeal, Oretsky first argues that the CV Endorsement did not apply to the Maserati because the car was not \u201cexotic\u201d and, thus, did not qualify as a collectible vehicle.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b544-12\">Under Florida law, a \u201cclear and unambiguous\u201d policy provision \u201cshould be enforced according to its terms.\u201d <em>Taurus Holdings, Inc. v. U.S. Fid. &amp; Guar. Co., </em>918 So.2d 528, 532 (Fla.2005) (internal quotation marks omitted). \u201c[Cjourts may not rewrite contracts, add meaning that is not present, or otherwise reach results contrary to the intentions of the parties.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(internal quotation marks omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b544-13\">Here, the CV Endorsement unambiguously applied to the Maserati because the declarations page expressly listed the CV Endorsement by number, and the CV Endorsement cross-referenced to the vehicle listed on the declarations page.</p>\n<p id=\"b544-14\">Moreover, even assuming the Maserati did not fit the definition of a \u201ccollectible vehicle,\u201d nothing in the insurance policy required the covered vehicle to be a col<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"523\">*523</page-number>lectible vehicle. The CV Endorsement defined \u201cyour covered auto\u201d as the vehicle listed on the declarations page, i.e., the Maserati. Neither the CV Endorsement nor any other policy provision required \u201cyour covered auto\u201d to be a collectible vehicle. The CV Endorsement mentioned the term \u201ccollectible vehicle\u201d only with respect to the \u201cnewly acquired auto\u201d provision.</p>\n<p id=\"b545-5\">As his next argument, Oretsky contends that Infinity committed an underwriting error by insuring his Maserati under the Classic Collectors\u2019 policy, and, therefore, Infinity should be estopped from denying coverage. This argument fails in two respects.</p>\n<p id=\"b545-6\">First, under Florida law, \u201cin the absence of ambiguous language, a court may not look to parol evidence in ascertaining the intent of the parties to an insurance contract.\u201d <em>Fireman's Fund Ins. Co. v. Tropical Shipping &amp; Constr. Co., </em>254 F.3d 987, 1003 (11th Cir.2001); <em>see also Essex Ins. Co. v. Zota, </em>466 F.3d 981, 987 (11th Cir.2006) (\u201cThe court may look to parol evidence in interpreting an insurance contract only if there is an ambiguity.\u201d). As discussed above, the CV Endorsement unambiguously applied to the Maserati, and nothing in the insurance policy required the Maserati to be a collectible vehicle. Thus, Infinity\u2019s underwriting guidelines, which were not a part of the insurance contract, are irrelevant in determining the scope of coverage under the policy.</p>\n<p id=\"b545-7\">Second, even if Infinity committed an underwriting mistake in issuing the Classic Collectors policy on the Maserati, Infinity was not estopped from denying coverage. \u201cThe essential elements of estoppel are (1) a representation as to a material fact that is contrary to a later-asserted position, (2) rebanee on that representation, and (3) a change in position detrimental to the party claiming estoppel, caused by the representation and reliance thereon.\u201d <em>Lloyds Underwriters at London v. Keystone Equip. Fin. Corp., </em>25 So.3d 89, 93 (Fla. 4th DCA 2009) (internal quotation marks omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b545-9\">Oretsky cannot show the first element of misrepresentation \u2014 that Infinity misrepresented to Oretsky that the policy it issued for the Maserati did not contain the restrictions set forth in the CV Endorsement. To the contrary, Infinity made it abundantly clear that the CV Endorsement would apply. Infinity asked Oretsky to fill out and sign an application questionnaire listing each of the usage requirements contained in the CV Endorsement, including the garage requirement. To obtain coverage, Oretsky had to place his initials next to each requirement, thereby certifying that he had read the requirement and would comply with it. Thus, Infinity in no way misrepresented what vehicle usage restrictions came with the policy. And Oretsky\u2019s alleged failure to read either the questionnaire or the policy is of no moment. <em>See Baum v. Allstate Ins. Co., </em>496 So.2d 201, 204 (Fla. 4th DCA 1986) (\u201cIt is axiomatic that absent unusual circumstances ... one cannot claim ignorance of the contents of a written instrument which one signs.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b545-10\">B. Garage Requirement</p>\n<p id=\"b545-11\">Oretsky next argues that, even if the CV Endorsement applied, Infinity wrongfully denied coverage because he had complied with the requirement that the Maserati be kept in a garage \u201cwhen not in use.\u201d Oret-sky contends that his Maserati was \u201cin use\u201d when it was stolen because parking the car in the driveway was essentially a temporary stop between outings, rather than a cessation of use. Alternatively, he argues, the term \u201cwhen not in use\u201d is ambiguous and should be construed against Infinity.</p>\n<p id=\"b546-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"524\">*524</page-number>\u201cIn accordance with well-established rules of interpretation, terms utilized in an insurance policy should be given their plain and unambiguous meaning as understood by the \u2018man-on-the-street.\u2019\u201d <em>State Farm Fire &amp; Cas. Co. v. Castillo, </em>829 So.2d 242, 244 (Fla. 3d DCA 2002). \u201cAn ambiguity arises when more than one interpretation may fairly be given to a policy provision.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 245 (internal quotation marks omitted). However, \u201c[a] provision is not ambiguous simply because it is complex or requires analysis.\u201d <em>Garcia v. Fed. Ins. Co., </em>969 So.2d 288, 291 (Fla.2007).</p>\n<p id=\"b546-4\">In this case, the term \u201cwhen not in use\u201d is not ambiguous. Regardless of whether this term may be ambiguous in other contexts, we have little trouble concluding that, under this particular set of facts, Oretsky\u2019s Maserati was not in use when it was stolen. After having the Maserati serviced on July 20, 2011, Oretsky parked the car at his residence, next to the garage where it was usually kept. At the time Oretsky went to bed the evening of July 20, he did not intend to use the Maserati until the next morning. Under any reasonable construction of the term, the Maserati was not \u201cin use\u201d while it was sitting in the driveway d\u00faring the night and while Oretsky slept in the house. Thus, Oretsky violated the policy\u2019s garage requirement by failing to park the Maserati in the garage on the night it was stolen.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b546-5\">C. Prejudice</p>\n<p id=\"b546-6\">Oretsky argues that, even if he violated the garage requirement, Infinity should not have denied coverage because it suffered no prejudice from the violation. Or-etsky asserts that the Maserati would have been stolen even if it had been parked in the garage, given that the thieves broke into the garage and stole the keys.</p>\n<p id=\"b546-9\">To support his argument, Oretsky relies on \u00a7 627.409(2) of the Florida Statutes, also known as the \u201canti-technical statute,\u201d which provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b546-10\">A breach or violation by the insured of any warranty, condition, or provision of any wet marine or transportation insurance policy, contract of insurance, endorsement, or application therefor does not void the policy or contract, or constitute a defense to a loss thereon, unless such breach or violation increased the hazard by any means within the control of the insured.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b546-11\">Fla. Stat. \u00a7 627.409(2). This statute \u201cis designed to prevent the insurer from avoiding coverage on a technical omission playing no part in the loss.\u201d <em>Pickett v. Woods, </em>404 So.2d 1152, 1153 (Fla. 5th DCA 1981). Otherwise, if the insured breached some condition of the policy not pertinent to the loss, \u201cthe insurer would collect a premium but would have no exposure to risk because the policy would no longer be effective.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b546-12\">As an initial matter, \u00a7 627.409(2) likely does not apply to motor vehicle casualty insurance policies. First, by its terms, the statute only applies to \u201cwet marine or transportation\u201d policies, and not to other types of insurance. <em>See </em>Fla. Stat. \u00a7 627409(2); <em>Indep. Fire Ins. Co. v. Paulekas, </em>633 So.2d 1111, 1113 (Fla. 3d DCA 1994) (stating that \u00a7 627.409(2) did not apply to a homeowner\u2019s insurance policy). Second, the term \u201ctransportation,\u201d as used in the statute, generally refers to the transport or shipment of goods in com<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"525\">*525</page-number>merce, not to the use of motor vehicles for personal conveyance. <em>See </em>Fla. Stat. \u00a7 624.607(2) (defining the term \u201cwet marine and transportation insurance\u201d as \u201cthat part of marine insurance which includes,\u201d among other things, \u201c[insurance of personal property and interests therein, in course of exportation from or importation into any country, or in course of transportation coastwise or on inland waters ... by land, water, or air ... in connection with any and all risks or perils of navigation, transit, or transportation\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b547-5\">But even if \u00a7 627.409(2) applied to motor vehicle policies, such as the one in this case, Infinity has shown prejudice from Oretsky\u2019s violation of the garage requirement. Common sense dictates that a car parked in a closed and locked garage is less likely to be stolen than a car parked in an open driveway, and that the garage requirement was designed at least in part to avoid loss through theft.</p>\n<p id=\"b547-6\">Oretsky does not challenge these common-sense conclusions. Rather, he asserts that the Maserati would have been stolen even if it had been parked inside the garage, as the thieves were familiar with Oretsky\u2019s routine, knew that he kept the keys inside the garage, and knew how to access the garage when locked. This assertion is pure speculation and finds no support in the record. <em>See Shiver v. Chertoff, </em>549 F.3d 1342, 1343 (11th Cir.2008) (\u201cSpeculation does not create a <em>genuine </em>issue of fact.\u201d (internal quotation marks omitted)). And indulging Oretsky\u2019s theory would not change the outcome. At a deposition, Oretsky himself testified that he left the Maserati in the driveway because starting the car in the garage could wake his son sleeping in the house. If the thieves were indeed familiar with Oretsky and his Maserati, they certainly would have been more hesitant to steal the car if it had been parked inside the garage, for fear of waking the occupants.</p>\n<p id=\"b547-9\">Furthermore, by its plain terms, \u00a7 627.409(2) does not require a policy -violation to be the sole cause of the loss, but only requires the violation to \u201cincrease[] the hazard by any means within the control of the insured.\u201d <em>See </em>Fla. Stat. \u00a7 627.409(2); <em>see also Eastern Ins. Co. v. Austin, </em>396 So.2d 823, 825 (Fla. 4th DCA 1981) (holding that \u00a7 627.409(2) did not void coverage after a boat wreck where the insured violated the insurance policy by occasionally selling fish caught from the boat, because \u201cthe occasional sale of fish caught on a pleasure fishing trip [had no] relevancy whatsoever\u201d to the hazard encountered by the boat). Here, even if parking the Maserati in the garage ultimately would not have prevented the theft, Oretsky\u2019s failure to do so certainly increased the danger of theft. Thus, \u00a7 627.409(2), if applicable at all, does not prevent Infinity from denying coverage based on the garage requirement.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b547-10\">In light of the foregoing, we affirm the district court\u2019s grant of summary judgment to Infinity.</p>\n<p id=\"b547-11\">AFFIRMED.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b540-10\">.
