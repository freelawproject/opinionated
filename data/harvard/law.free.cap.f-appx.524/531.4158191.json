Mr. Francis argues that 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3583(e)(3), which governs the revocation of supervised release, violates the Fifth and Sixth Amendments under the principles set out in <em>Apprendi v. New Jersey, </em>530 U.S. 466, 120 S.Ct. 2348, 147 L.Ed.2d 435 (2000), <em>Blakely v. Washington, </em>542 U.S. 296, 124 S.Ct. 2531, 159 L.Ed.2d 403 (2004), and <em>Int\u2019l Union, United Mine Workers of Am. v. Bagwell, </em>512 U.S. 821, 114 S.Ct. 2552, 129 L.Ed.2d 642 (1994), because it permits defendants to receive a sentence of imprisonment and a new term of supervised release upon a finding made by a judge, not a jury, and by a preponderance of the evidence, not beyond a reasonable doubt.</p>\n<p id=\"b553-18\">Although we generally review a district court\u2019s revocation of supervised release for an abuse of discretion, we review <em>de novo </em>a constitutional challenge to a statute. <em>See United States v. Cunningham, </em>607 F.3d 1264, 1266 (11th Cir.2010). In relevant part, \u00a7 3583(e)(3) states that a district court may \u201crevoke a term of supervised release, and require the defendant to serve in prison all or part of the term of supervised release ... if the court ... finds by a preponderance of the evidence that the defendant violated a condition of supervised release.\u201d 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3583(e)(3). In <em>Cunningham, </em>we held that \u201c \u00a7 3583(e)(3) does not violate the Fifth or Sixth Amendments because the violation of supervised release need only be proven by a preponderance of the evidence, and there is no right to trial by jury in a supervised release revocation hearing.\u201d <em>Cunningham, </em>607 F.3d at 1268.</p>\n<p id=\"b553-19\">Mr. Francis concedes that our decision in <em>Cunningham </em>forecloses his argument. <em>See </em>Appellant\u2019s Brief at 10 n. 5 (\u201cMr. Francis recognizes that this Court rejected the argument in <em>Cunningham. </em>Thus, Mr. Francis is presenting this issue primarily for <em>en banc </em>or certiorari review.\u201d). We are bound to follow our prior binding precedent unless and until it is overruled by this Court <em>en banc </em>or by the Supreme Court. <em>See United States v. Vega-Castillo, </em>540 F.3d 1235, 1236 (11th Cir.2008). Because <em>Cunningham </em>has not been overruled by our Court <em>en banc </em>or by the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"532\">*532</page-number>Supreme Court, we affirm the district court\u2019s revocation of Mr. Francis\u2019 term of supervised release.</p>\n<p id=\"b554-4\">Affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
