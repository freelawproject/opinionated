(\u201cH20 Hair\u201d), sued H20 Hair and his supervisor, Michael Gaspard, alleging Title VII and Louisiana state law claims based on sexual harassment. The claims were dismissed, and the court granted costs and attorney\u2019s fees to H20 Hair and Gaspard on a finding that the suit was frivolous. Provensal appeals only the award (and not the amount) of the costs and fees. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b997-12\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b997-13\">While working for H20 Hair as a massage therapist, Provensal filed a complaint with the EEOC and, after receiving permission to sue, he filed a district-court complaint in which he vaguely alleged that he had been the victim of discrimination based on his sex and religion. He claimed that Gaspard had demanded personal massages, had exposed himself to Provensal, and had promised to make Provensal a \u201chead therapist\u201d and get him extra money if he gave Gaspard more personal massages. Provensal also alleged, with no particularity or supporting facts, causes of action for failure to create a workplace free of discrimination, slander, defamation, intentional infliction of emotional distress (\u201cIIED\u201d), and other violations of state law. He requested damages of $1 million for emotional distress, economic losses, physical injuries, and \u201closs of civil rights.\u201d He also requested punitive damages and costs.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b997-20\">The court dismissed parts of the complaint, beginning with state-law claims that Provensal conceded did not state a claim upon which relief could be granted. Eventually each claim was dismissed either under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure Rule 12(b)(6) or on a motion for summary judgment. Provensal was not able to present any evidence that he had received a promotion or demotion or any change in his wages while at H20 Hair. In his deposition, he did not explain how Gaspard had harassed him beyond undressing in front of him, as many customers did, and becoming sexually aroused during the massage, which, as Provensal admitted, was reasonable to expect during a thigh massage.</p>\n<p id=\"b997-21\">After dismissing all the claims, the court addressed H20 Hair and Gaspard\u2019s motions for costs and attorney\u2019s fees. The court undertook a careful analysis of reasonable fees and the actual time spent on each issue and included those calculations in the order and reasons. The court re<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"976\">*976</page-number>duced the fees considerably from the amounts initially claimed.</p>\n<p id=\"b998-4\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b998-5\">We review an award of costs and attorney\u2019s fees for abuse of discretion. <em>Jason D.W. by Douglas W. v. Hous. Indep. Sch. Dist., </em>158 F.3d 205, 208 (5th Cir.1998). A court \u201cabuses its discretion when its ruling is based on an erroneous view of the law or a clearly erroneous assessment of the evidence.\u201d <em>United States v. Yanez Sosa, </em>513 F.3d 194, 200 (5th Cir.2008) (quotations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b998-6\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b998-7\">Costs and attorney\u2019s fees may be awarded under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 54 and 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1920 and, in Title VII cases, are explicitly made available and relegated to the discretion of the court. 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 2000e-5. They are awarded differently, however, based on the identity of the prevailing party. A prevailing plaintiff generally ought to recover attorney\u2019s fees. <em>Christiansburg Garment Co. v. EEOC, </em>434 U.S. 412, 417, 98 S.Ct. 694, 54 L.Ed.2d 648 (1978) (applying to Title VII the <em>Piggie Park </em>standard of Title II, under which the default position is that a prevailing plaintiff recovers attorney\u2019s fees). A prevailing defendant, on the other hand, should recover fees only where the \u201ccourt finds that [the plaintiffs] claim was frivolous, unreasonable, or groundless, or that the plaintiff continued to litigate after it clearly became so\u201d or that the plaintiff brought a claim in bad faith. <em>Id. </em>at 422, 98 S.Ct. 694.</p>\n<p id=\"b998-8\">Claims do not need to be \u201cairtight\u201d to avoid being frivolous, and courts must be careful not to use the benefit of perfect hindsight in assessing frivolousness. <em>Id. </em>at 421-22, 98 S.Ct. 694. Factors include \u201cwhether the plaintiff established a prima facie case, whether the defendant offered to settle, and whether the court held a full trial.\u201d <em>Myers v. City of W. Monroe, </em>211 F.3d 289, 292 (5th Cir.2000). These factors are \u201cguideposts,\u201d and frivolousness must be judged on a case-by-case basis. <em>See Doe v. Silsbee Indep. Sch. Dist., </em>440 Fed.Appx. 421, 425 (5th Cir.2011) (per cu-riam). Where a claim is \u201cso lacking in merit\u201d as to render it groundless, it may be classified as frivolous. <em>United States v. Mississippi, </em>921 F.2d 604, 609 (5th Cir.1991).</p>\n<p id=\"b998-10\">The district court, per the magistrate judge serving by consent, correctly applied our standard when determining frivolousness. The court opined that \u201cthe claims for religious discrimination, slander, and defamation had no colorable basis in fact or law, the claims for [IIED] were clearly prescribed <em>[sic </em>], and the federal and state employment claims against <em>Gaspard </em>were patently meritless because Gaspard was not plaintiffs employer.\u201d We consider briefly each of these claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b998-11\">The decision regarding the frivolousness of Provensal\u2019s claims for religious discrimination, slander, and defamation is reasonable. Even in his complaint, Provensal\u2019s claims stand out as ungrounded in law and fact. He did not explain his religion or how he had been discriminated against on that basis. He did not allege a single specific incident of slander or defamation. He failed even to point to any negative statement Gaspard or H20 Hair had made about him. Provensal did not note any of the legal requirements of these claims. Finally, in his response to Gaspard and H20 Hair\u2019s motion to dismiss, Provensal agreed that those three claims <em>should be dismissed. </em>They were meritless from the start, and Provensal is unable to explain even now how they were not frivolous, beyond vague notions of our lenient pleading standards. That does not suffice.</p>\n<p id=\"b999-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"977\">*977</page-number>The determination that the claim for IIED was frivolous was also reasonable. The court concluded that the claim was proscribed under the relevant statute of limitations and was therefore frivolous. Provensal concedes that the claim was time-barred; he even goes as far as to argue that it was so clearly time-barred that H20 Hair and Gaspard\u2019s lawyers <em>should have asked for dismissal </em>earlier\u2014 he maintains that Gaspard\u2019s failure to have the claim dismissed was his counsel\u2019s invidiously inflating the cost of litigation.</p>\n<p id=\"b999-5\">In appropriate cases, we have held that time-barred suits are meritless and properly deemed frivolous. <em>See Pope v. MCI Telecomms. Corp., </em>937 F.2d 258, 267 (5th Cir.1991). The court reasonably determined that the IIED claim was frivolous.</p>\n<p id=\"b999-6\">Finally, the Title VII claims against Gaspard were correctly deemed meritless and frivolous. Title VII does not impose liability on individuals unless they are \u201cemployers.\u201d <em>See, e.g., Grant v. Lone Star Co., </em>21 F.3d 649, 653 (5th Cir.1994). Gaspard was not an employer and therefore could not be sued in his individual capacity under Title. VII. That fact was obvious from the outset. The court again correctly concluded that the claim was frivolous.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> \u2022</p>\n<p id=\"b999-7\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b997-14\"><em> </em>Pursuant to 5TH CIR. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b997-22\">. Provensal amended his complaint after H20 Hair responded with a motion to dismiss or for a more definite statement under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 12(b)(6) and (e). The amended complaint added little detail.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b999-9\">. Even if only a subset of the claims was frivolous, it was still within the discretion of the court to grant costs- and fees on that subset. <em>See Fox v. Vice, </em>- U.S. -, 131 S.Ct. 2205, 2214, 180 L.Ed.2d 45 (2011).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
