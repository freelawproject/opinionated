(repealed July 1, 2011). He filed a lawsuit against several Alabama officials <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"499\">*499</page-number>pursuant to 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983, alleging that, for various reasons, the ACNA could not be constitutionally applied to him. The district court granted the defendants\u2019 motion for summary judgment, and Mr. Spencer, proceeding pro se, now appeals. Exercising plenary review, <em>see, e.g., Sierra Club, Inc. v. Leavitt, </em>488 F.3d 904, 911 (11th Cir.2007), we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b521-5\">We read pro se briefs liberally, <em>see Cofield v. Alabama Public Service Comm\u2019n, </em>936 F.2d 512, 514 n. 2 (11th Cir.1991), but even so it is difficult to figure out what arguments Mr. Spencer is making on appeal. He does not, for example, list any specific issues. Nor does he say why he believes the district court erred. In a prior appeal by Mr. Spencer, we noted the same problems. <em>See Spencer v. King, </em>333 Fed.Appx. 488, 489 (11th Cir.2009) (\u201cAlthough we construe pro se filings liberally, Spencer\u2019s appeal gives us very little to work with.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b521-6\">The one argument we think we can discern from the brief is Mr. Spencer\u2019s contention that the ACNA \u2014 and specifically its residency and registration requirements \u2014 cannot be constitutionally applied to him because of ex post facto and equal protection concerns. The problem for Mr. Spencer is that a challenge to a criminal conviction cannot be brought under \u00a7 1983. <em>See Bradley v. Pryor, </em>305 F.3d 1287, 1289 (11th Cir.2002) (\u201c[Hjabeas Corpus [rather than \u00a7 1983] is the exclusive remedy for a state prisoner who challenges the fact or duration of his confinement and seeks immediate or speedier release.\u201d) (citing <em>Preiser v. Rodriguez, </em>411 U.S. 475, 490, 93 S.Ct. 1827, 36 L.Ed.2d 439 (1973)). And insofar as Mr. Spencer seeks damages for his ACNA convictions, that claim is, as the district court explained, currently barred by <em>Heck v. Humphrey </em>512 U.S. 477, 487, 114 S.Ct. 2364, 129 L.Ed.2d 383 (1994) (damages action under \u00a7 1983 is not cognizable if a judgment in the plaintiffs favor \u201cwould necessarily imply the invalidity of [the] conviction or sentence,\u201d and the conviction and sentence have not been reversed, vacated, or otherwise invalidated.).</p>\n<p id=\"b521-8\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
