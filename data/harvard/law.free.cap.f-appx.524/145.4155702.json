Contesting his sentence, Ramirez contends the district court erred in treating his prior Texas conviction for possession of a deadly weapon in a penal institution as a violent felony, resulting in the statutory-minimum sentence under ACCA. (According to the Pre-sentence Investigation Report, the deadly weapon in the prior offense at issue was a rock in a sock.)</p>\n<p id=\"b168-4\">A district court\u2019s determining a prior offense constitutes a violent felony under ACCA is reviewed <em>de novo, United States v. Fuller, </em>453 F.3d 274, 278 (5th Cir.2006), using a categorical approach under which the elements of the underlying statute for the prior offense, rather than defendant\u2019s underlying conduct, are examined, <em>Sykes v. United States </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 131 S.Ct. 2267, 2272, 180 L.Ed.2d 60 (2011). Ramirez violated Texas Penal Code \u00a7 46.10 by \u201cintentionally, knowingly, or recklessly ... (1) carrying] on or about his person a deadly weapon; or (2) possessing] or concealing] a deadly weapon in the penal institution\u201d.</p>\n<p id=\"b168-7\">ACCA subjects a defendant, convicted under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 922(g), to a mandatory-minimum sentence of 15 years\u2019 imprisonment if he has three prior convictions for a \u201cviolent felony\u201d, defined as a crime that \u201c(i) has as an element the use, attempted use, or threatened use of physical force against the person of another; or (ii) is burglary, arson, or extortion, involves use of explosives, or <em>otherwise involves conduct </em>that presents a serious potential risk of physical injury to another\u201d. 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924(e)(2)(B) (emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b168-8\">Ramirez contends: under <em>Begay v. United States, </em>553 U.S. 137, 128 S.Ct. 1581, 170 L.Ed.2d 490 (2008), the residual, or \u201cotherwise involves\u201d, clause of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924(e)(2)(B)(ii) excludes reckless crimes, and his prior conviction was such an excluded offense. The Supreme Court has addressed when an offense should be classified as a violent felony via that residual clause. <em>Begay, </em>553 U.S. at 143-45, 128 S.Ct. 1581 (cited in <em>United States v. Stoker, </em>706 F.3d 643, 649 (5th Cir.2013) with respect to the residual clause of Sentencing Guideline \u00a7 4B1.2). <em>Begay </em>explains the residual clause applies to offenses \u201csimilar\u201d to ACCA\u2019s enumerated offenses, but specifically to those offenses \u201croughly similar, in kind as well as in degree of risk posed, to the examples themselves\u201d and \u201ctypically involve purposeful, \u2018violent,\u2019 and \u2018aggressive\u2019 conduct\u201d. <em>Begay, </em>553 U.S. at 143-45, 128 S.Ct. 1581. (To the extent the Court\u2019s decision in <em>Sykes </em>may have limited the applicability of the <em>Begay </em>analysis to those offenses involving strict liability or an element of recklessness, the limitation is not applicable here, as the Texas statute at issue may be violated intentionally, knowingly, <em>or </em>recklessly. <em>See Sykes, </em>131 S.Ct. at 2275-76; Tex. Penal Code \u00a7 46.10.)</p>\n<p id=\"b168-10\">In <em>United States v. Marquez, </em>626 F.3d 214, 225 (5th Cir.2010), our court held the New Mexico offense of possession of a deadly weapon by a prisoner constituted a crime of violence under Guideline \u00a7 4B1.2. <em>Marquez </em>\u2019 analysis was closely aligned with the Tenth Circuit\u2019s in <em>United States v. Zuniga, </em>553 F.3d 1330 (10th Cir.2009), which held a violation of Texas Penal Code \u00a7 46.10 was a crime of violence under ACCA. <em>Marquez, </em>626 F.3d at 223 (citing <em>Zuniga, </em>553 F.3d at 1335). <em>Marquez </em>also quoted the conclusion of our <em>pre-Begay </em>decision, <em>United States v. Rodriguez-Jaimes, </em>481 F.3d 283 (5th Cir.2007), that possession of a weapon in a prison setting \u201c\u2018creates a perpetual risk of injury and precludes any legitimate reasons that a non-incarcerated individual could have for <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"147\">*147</page-number>possessing a weapon <em>Marquez, </em>626 F.3d at 222 n. 71 (quoting <em>Rodriguez-Jaimes, </em>481 F.3d at 287).</p>\n<p id=\"b169-6\"><em>Marquez, </em>with its relying on <em>Zuniga </em>and <em>Rodriguez-Jaimes, </em>is controlling here. <em>United States v. Hughes, </em>602 F.3d 669, 673 and n. 1 (5th Cir.2010) (\u201cWe have previously applied our holdings under the residual clause of the ACCA to analyze the definition of crimes of violence under [Guideline] \u00a7 4B1.2, and vice versa.\u201d (internal quotation marks and citation omitted)). In short, Ramirez has shown no error in the court\u2019s determining his conviction for possession of a deadly weapon in a penal institution, in violation of Texas Penal Code \u00a7 46.10, constitutes a violent felony under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924(e).</p>\n<p id=\"b169-8\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b167-17\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
