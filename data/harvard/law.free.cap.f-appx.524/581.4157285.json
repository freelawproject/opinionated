Brown\u2019s guideline range was four to ten months, but the district court determined that a within-range sentence was inadequate to comply with several 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a) factors and sentenced Brown to 24 months. On appeal, Brown contends his sentence was procedurally unreasonable because the district court\u2019s explanation for his sentence was inadequate. Brown also argues that his sentence was substantively unreasonable because it failed to advance the purposes of sentencing and because the district court did not account for his personal characteristics or his rehabilitative needs. After review, we affirm Brown\u2019s sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"APE\">\n<em>Procedural Reasonableness</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b604-8\">When reviewing a sentence, we must first determine that the \u201cdistrict court committed no significant procedural error.\u201d <em>Gall v. United States, </em>552 U.S. 38, 128 S.Ct. 586, 597, 169 L.Ed.2d 445 (2007). A sentence is procedurally reasonable if the district court properly calculated the guideline range, treated the Guidelines as advisory, considered the \u00a7 3553(a) factors, did not select a sentence based on clearly erroneous facts, and adequately explained the chosen sentence. <em>Id. </em>We have never required a sentencing judge to \u201carticulate his findings and reasoning with great detail or in any detail for that matter.\u201d <em>United States v. Irey, </em>612 F.3d 1160, 1195 (11th Cir.2010) <em>(en banc). </em>However, a \u201csentencing judge should set forth enough to satisfy the appellate court that he has considered the parties\u2019 arguments and has a reasoned basis for exercising his own legal decisionmaking authority.\u201d <em>Rita v. United States, </em>551 U.S. 338, 127 S.Ct. 2456, 2469, 168 L.Ed.2d 203 (2007). In <em>Rita, </em>the Supreme Court reasoned that, although the district court had provided a limited explanation of its sentence, the record showed that the court had listened to the evidence and arguments and was aware of the various factors that would justify a lower sentence. <em>Id. </em>at 2469.</p>\n<p id=\"b604-10\">Brown\u2019s sentence was not procedurally unreasonable. The district court articulated the various \u00a7 3553(a) factors that it believed justified the above-guideline range sentence. Moreover, the record indicates that the district court heard sufficient evidence to support its conclusion, including the probation officer\u2019s testimony that Brown had (1) made serious threats to harm others; (2) indicated that he would continue to refuse to cooperate; and (3) proven to be \u201cunsupervisable.\u201d In combination with the evidence presented at Brown\u2019s revocation hearing, the district court\u2019s reference to various \u00a7 3553(a) factors was sufficient to explain Brown\u2019s sentence. <em>See Rita, </em>127 S.Ct. at 2469.</p>\n<p id=\"AZpq\">\n<em>Substantive Reasonableness</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b604-11\">We review the totality of the facts and circumstances to gauge for substantive error. <em>Irey, </em>612 F.3d at 1189-90. The district court must impose \u201ca sentence sufficient, but not greater than necessary, to comply with the purposes\u201d listed in \u00a7 3553(a)(2). <em>Id. </em>at 1196. The weight given to each \u00a7 3553(a) factor is \u201ca matter <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"583\">*583</page-number>committed to the sound discretion of the district court.\u201d <em>United States v. Clay, </em>483 F.3d 739, 743 (11th Cir.2007). We must vacate a sentence if we are \u201cleft with the definite and firm conviction that the district court committed a clear error of judgment in weighing the \u00a7 3553(a) factors by arriving at a sentence that lies outside the range of reasonable sentences dictated by the facts of the case.\u201d <em>United States v. Pugh, </em>515 F.3d 1179, 1191 (11th Cir.2008) (quotations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b605-5\">Brown\u2019s 24-month sentence was substantively reasonable. The district court was within its discretion to weigh the \u00a7 3553(a) factors as it did and to determine that the 24-month sentence was necessary to comply with the purposes of sentencing. <em>See Clay, </em>483 F.3d at 743. There is nothing in the record to leave this Court with the \u201cdefinite and firm conviction\u201d that the 24-month sentence was substantively unreasonable. <em>See Pugh, </em>515 F.3d at 1191. Accordingly, we affirm Brown\u2019s sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b605-6\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
