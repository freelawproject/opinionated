The district court stayed the action in deference to the ongoing probate of the estate in a Florida court. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b569-26\">We review for abuse of discretion a decision to stay an action after weighing the factors identified by the Supreme Court in <em>Colorado River Water Conservation District v. United States, </em>424 U.S. 800, 818-19, 96 S.Ct. 1236, 1247, 47 L.Ed.2d 483 (1976). <em>Moorer v. Demopolis Waterworks and Sewer Bd., </em>374 F.3d 994, 996 (11th <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"548\">*548</page-number>Cir.2004). \u201cWhen employing an abuse of discretion standard, we must affirm unless we ... determine that the district court has made a clear error of judgment, or has applied an incorrect legal standard.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 996-97 (internal quotation marks omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b570-4\">Alexander argues that the decision to stay his federal action conflicts with Mar<em>shall v. Marshall, </em>547 U.S. 293, 126 S.Ct. 1735, 164 L.Ed.2d 480 (2006), but we disagree. Consistent with the holding in <em>Marshall </em>that a federal court is obliged to exercise its jurisdiction to consider matters that do not annul a will, invalidate the administration of an estate, or interfere with property in the custody of the probate court, <em>id. </em>at 311-12, 126 S.Ct. at 1748, the district court ruled that Alexander\u2019s action was not in the nature of a probate proceeding and that it had jurisdiction to entertain Kaplan\u2019s <em>in personam </em>claims against his uncle. The district court did not abdicate its obligation to exercise its jurisdiction. <em>See Colorado River, </em>424 U.S. at 817, 96 S.Ct. at 1246.</p>\n<p id=\"b570-5\">The district court did not abuse its discretion by staying the federal action. The nature of the probate proceedings reveals that parallel federal and state litigation would result in deleterious piecemeal litigation. <em>See Moorer, </em>374 F.3d at 996; <em>Ambrosia Coal and Const. Co. v. Pages Morales, </em>368 F.3d 1320, 1333 (11th Cir.2004). Alexander has an opportunity to object to the decisions that Leon has made in distributing the estate, <em>see </em>Fla. Prob. R. 5.150, 5.345, 5.400, and the resolution of those objections will dispose of or substantially limit Alexander\u2019s claims that Leon breached his fiduciary duties to the estate, <em>see </em>Fla. Stat. \u00a7\u00a7 733.609(1), 733.901(1)-(2). For example, Alexander complains that Leon acted tortuously by settling a wrongful death survivor\u2019s claim for a low amount, but the probate court has approved the settlement and, in so doing, \u201crelieved [Leon] of liability or responsibility for the compromise,\u201d see Fla. Stat. \u00a7 733.708. And the record supports the finding of the district court that a parallel federal action would be wasteful. Alexander already has attempted to excuse his violation of the discovery deadline in the federal action as necessary to accommodate the ongoing probate proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b570-7\">We AFFIRM the stay of the action against Leon Kaplan.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
