For the reasons that follow, the petition is denied in part and dismissed in part.</p>\n<p id=\"b549-9\">I. Facts</p>\n<p id=\"b549-10\">Juarez was admitted to the United States as a nonimmigrant visitor in April 1982, with authorization to remain in the country for 11 days, but he did not leave the country when required. On October 5, 1992, he was convicted in Florida of burglary with assault, armed burglary, aggravated battery, aggravated assault with a deadly weapon, battery, and petty theft\u2014 crimes involving moral turpitude. He was also convicted of petty theft in Florida in January 2001.</p>\n<p id=\"b549-11\">Juarez applied for adjustment to permanent resident status in October 1998 and was interviewed for adjustment status February 12, 2001. Juarez failed to disclose, as required, his October 1992 conviction on both his application for adjustment and during his adjustment status interview. The Immigration and Naturalization Service officer who interviewed Juarez then approved his adjustment status, and Juarez became a lawful permanent resident the same day.</p>\n<p id=\"b549-14\">In September 2011, Juarez returned from a trip abroad and sought entry into the United States at the Miami International Airport. He was refused admission based on his failure to truthfully disclose his prior criminal history. In November 2011, the Department of Homeland Security (\u201cDHS\u201d) charged Juarez as inadmissible based on \u00a7 1182(a)(2)(A)(i)(I), as an alien who has been convicted of a crime involving moral turpitude.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> At the administrative hearing, the IJ found Juarez was in fact convicted of a crime involving moral turpitude, which he failed to disclose during the adjustment status process. The IJ also found that Juarez failed to obtain a waiver for the conviction, and, as a result, Juarez was removable under \u00a7 1182(a)(2)(A)\u00a9\u00ae. The BIA affirmed and added that Juarez was removable under \u00a7 1101(a)(13)(C)(v), the statute regarding admission and exclusion of aliens who have been lawfully admitted as permanent residents, because lawful permanent residents may be deemed applicants for admission if they have, among other things, committed a crime involving moral turpitude. Juarez timely appealed.</p>\n<p id=\"b549-15\">Juarez contends the BIA incorrectly interpreted \u00a7 1101(a)(13)(C)(v) because the language of the statute only applies to a conviction for a qualifying offense under \u00a7 1182(a)(2) that occurs after the alien has become a lawful permanent resident. Accordingly, Juarez asserts the IJ did not have jurisdiction to order him removed, and his previous counsel\u2019s concession that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"528\">*528</page-number>he was removable was a nullity. Juarez also argues he was denied due process because of the IJ\u2019s failure to follow proper procedures.</p>\n<p id=\"b550-4\">II. Jurisdiction</p>\n<p id=\"b550-5\">Before turning to the merits, we first address our jurisdiction to hear this case. \u201cWe are obligated to inquire into our jurisdiction whenever it may be lacking.\u201d <em>Arias v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>482 F.3d 1281, 1283 (11th Cir.2007). Our subject matter jurisdiction is reviewed <em>de novo. Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b550-6\">Under 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(a)(2)(C), \u201cno court shall have jurisdiction to review any final order of removal against an alien who is removable by reason of having committed a criminal offense covered in [8 U.S.C. \u00a7 ] 1182(a)(2).\u201d That statute applies to this case because Juarez\u2019s crime involving moral turpitude is covered by \u00a7 1182(a).</p>\n<p id=\"b550-7\">Despite this jurisdictional bar, we nevertheless retain jurisdiction over constitutional claims or questions of law raised in a petition for review. 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(a)(2)(D); <em>see also Savoury v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>449 F.3d 1307, 1311-12 (11th Cir.2006). However, we have jurisdiction over constitutional claims only when a petitioner alleges \u201cat least a colorable constitutional violation,\u201d which means that \u201cthe alleged violation need not be substantial, but the claim must have some possible validity.\u201d <em>Arias, </em>482 F.3d at 1284 n. 2 (internal quotation marks omitted). Questions of statutory interpretation are legal questions subject to plenary review. <em>Bishop v. Reno, </em>210 F.3d 1295, 1298 (11th Cir.2000).</p>\n<p id=\"b550-8\">In his first claim, Juarez challenges the BIA\u2019s interpretation of 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1101(a)(13)(C)(v) and its rejection of his argument that he was improperly deemed inadmissible under 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1182(a)(2)(A)(i)(I). Because Juarez\u2019s claim essentially raises an issue of statutory interpretation that implicates the IJ\u2019s jurisdiction, we conclude it is a colorable issue that we have jurisdiction to consider. <em>See Arias, </em>482 F.3d at 1284 &amp; n. 2; <em>Bishop, </em>210 F.3d at 1298.</p>\n<p id=\"b550-11\">In his second and third claims, Juarez argues he was denied due process because the IJ failed to obtain all the necessary facts to determine whether he was removable and because the IJ failed to create a meaningful record for review. We do not have jurisdiction to review these claims, however, because both claims lack \u201cat least a colorable constitutional violation.\u201d Arias, 482 F.3d at 1284 &amp; n. 2.</p>\n<p id=\"b550-12\">The record clearly demonstrates that the IJ conducted both an initial hearing and a merits hearing, and Juarez was represented by counsel and had an opportunity to be heard. Additionally, the record contains a full transcript of both hearings, indicating the IJ was not derelict in his duty to create a meaningful record for review.</p>\n<p id=\"b550-13\">Finally, to the extent Juarez contends the IJ should have held a hearing to determine why Juarez was out of the country and for how long, this argument also fails. Those facts have no bearing on the outcome of this case because, as explained below, Juarez was never a lawful permanent resident admissible into the United States, and thus, the purpose and duration of his overseas trip is irrelevant.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b551-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"529\">*529</page-number>We now turn to the merits of Juarez\u2019s first contention.</p>\n<p id=\"b551-5\">III. Removal</p>\n<p id=\"b551-6\">We review only the BIA\u2019s decision, except to the extent it expressly adopted the IJ\u2019s decision. <em>Savoury, </em>449 F.3d at 1312. To the extent the BIA adopted the IJ\u2019s reasoning, we review the IJ\u2019s decision as well. <em>Id. </em>Here, because the BIA expressly adopted and affirmed the IJ\u2019s decision with a few additions, we review the IJ\u2019s decision as supplemented by the BIA. <em>See id. </em>We review <em>de novo </em>the BIA\u2019s legal determinations, including its interpretation of statutes. <em>Poveda, </em>692 at 1172. However, we defer to the BIA\u2019s statutory interpretation \u201cif it is reasonable and does not contradict the clear intent of Congress.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(internal quotation marks omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b551-7\">The IJ found Juarez removable under \u00a7 1182(a)(2)(A)(i)(I), because he had previously committed a crime involving moral turpitude, and he had not obtained a waiver for the conviction. The BIA adopted the IJ\u2019s findings and added that Juarez was also removable under \u00a7 1101(a)(13)(C)(v) because a \u201clawful permanent resident may be deemed an applicant for admission if he or she has committed an offense identified in section [1182](a)(2).\u201d [Admin. R. at 3 (internal quotation marks omitted).] Juarez\u2019s sole argument on appeal is that the language of 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1101(a)(13)(C)(v) requires that a conviction for a qualifying offense under 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1182(a)(2) occur <em>after </em>an alien becomes a lawful permanent resident in order to subject that alien to removal. Thus, he asserts, he is not removable under \u00a7 1101(a)(13)(C)(v).</p>\n<p id=\"b551-8\">We need not reach this argument. Section 1101(a)(13)(C)(v) only applies to lawful permanent residents, and Juarez is not a lawful permanent resident. As we said in <em>Savoury, </em>an alien cannot be a lawful permanent resident when the award of that status is inconsistent with the law. 449 F.3d at 1317. Juarez only obtained permanent resident status by failing to disclose his prior conviction for a crime involving moral turpitude. Otherwise, he would have been ineligible for adjustment of his status, as he did not obtain a waiver for the conviction. <em>See </em>8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1255(a) (requiring an alien to be admissible in order to be eligible for adjustment of status to permanent resident). As such, \u00a7 1101(a)(13)(C)(v) does not apply to Juarez.</p>\n<p id=\"b551-10\">Section 1182(a)(2) applies to <em>any </em>alien seeking admission to the United States who has committed a crime involving moral turpitude. Under the statute, Juarez is inadmissible. Accordingly, his removal is proper.</p>\n<p id=\"b551-11\">PETITION DENIED IN PART, DISMISSED IN PART.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b549-12\">. DHS also initially charged him under 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1182(a)(6)(C)(i), as an alien who seeks to procure, or has procured, admission to the United States, a visa, or other immigration benefit, by fraud or willfully misrepresenting a material fact, and 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1182(a)(7)(A)(i)(I), as an alien who seeks admission without a valid entry document or visa. DHS voluntarily withdrew those charges, and they are not at issue on appeal.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b550-9\">. Additionally, as we recently stated in <em>Poveda v. U.S. Att'y Gen., </em>692 F.3d 1168, 1175 (11th Cir.2012), <em>\u201ca </em>lawful permanent resident who commits certain crimes before departure is considered an applicant for admission upon his return regardless of the length of the trip.\u201d This includes crimes involving moral turpitude. Thus, the duration and purpose of Juarez\u2019s trip would not be relevant even if he was a lawful permanent resident.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
