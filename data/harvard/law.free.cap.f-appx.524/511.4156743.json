Smith further alleged that, as a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"513\">*513</page-number>result of the attack, he suffered pain in \u201chis shoulder and right hand with wrist injury as well; and minor bruises to his eye and a swollen face.\u201d The district court granted summary judgment to Officer Daniels because \u201cthe amount of force at issue ... was <em>de minimis </em>\u201d and \u201cno reasonable jury could find in favor of [Smith].\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b535-5\">\u201cWe review <em>de novo </em>the district court\u2019s grant of summary judgment, applying the same standard as the district court.\u201d <em>Burton v. Tampa Hous. Auth., </em>271 F.3d 1274, 1276 (11th Cir.2001). Summary judgment is appropriate if the pleadings and other evidence demonstrates that \u201cthere is no genuine dispute as to any material fact and the movant is entitled to a judgment as a matter of law\u201d Fed.R.Civ.P. 56(a). \u201cThe moving party bears the initial burden of showing ... that there are no genuine issues of material fact\u201d and, if the moving party discharges its burden, \u201cthe non-moving party must ... go beyond the pleadings ... [to] designate specific facts showing that there is a genuine issue for trial.\u201d <em>Allen v. Bd. of Pub. Educ. for Bibb Cnty., </em>495 F.3d 1306, 1313-14 (11th Cir.2007) (quotation marks omitted). All evidence is viewed, and all reasonable inferences are drawn, in the light most favorable to the nonmoving party. <em>Burton, </em>271 F.3d at 1277.</p>\n<p id=\"b535-6\">When prison officials are accused of using excessive physical force \u201cthe core judicial inquiry is ... whether force was applied in a good-faith effort to maintain or restore discipline, or maliciously and sadistically to cause harm.\u201d <em>Hudson v. McMillian, </em>503 U.S. 1, 7, 112 S.Ct. 995, 999, 117 L.Ed.2d 156 (1992). However, not \u201cevery malevolent touch by a prison guard gives rise to a federal cause of action.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 9, 112 S.Ct. at 1000. \u201cThe Eighth Amendment\u2019s prohibition of \u2018cruel and unusual\u2019 punishments necessarily excludes from constitutional recognition <em>de minimis </em>uses of physical force, provided that the use of force is not of a sort repugnant to the conscience of mankind.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 9-10, 112 S.Ct. at 1000 (quotation marks omitted). Thus, \u201c[a]n inmate who complains of a \u2018push or shove\u2019 that causes no discernible injury almost certainly fails to state a valid excessive force claim.\u201d <em>Wilkins v. Gaddy, </em>559 U.S. 34, 38, 130 S.Ct. 1175, 1178, 175 L.Ed.2d 995 (2010). While a lack of serious injury is relevant to the inquiry, \u201c[i]n-jury and force ... are only imperfectly correlated and it is the latter that ultimately counts.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b535-8\">Taking Smith\u2019s account as true, the attack was no more than a <em>de minimis </em>use of force. First, there was a lack of serious injury. The district court properly concluded that Smith\u2019s only injury was minimal swelling around the left eye. It is undisputed that Smith had \u201cminimal swelling\u201d when treated the day after the incident. Smith alleges that he also suffered facial bruising and a fractured wrist as a result of the incident. However, Officer Daniels has met his burden of showing that there is no genuine dispute about the existence of these injuries (no such injuries were caused by the incident), and Smith has not rebutted that showing by designating specific facts beyond the pleadings. <em>See Allen, </em>495 F.3d at 1313-14. Notes from Smith\u2019s medical examination after the incident stated that there was no \u201cdiscoloration\u201d and did not reference wrist pain. Also, Smith\u2019s medical records show that he made inconsistent statements about when his wrist injury occurred. Finally, while later examinations indicated that Smith had fractured his wrist at some point, the Director of Medical Services for the Florida Department of Corrections explained that it was \u201chighly unlikely, if not near impossible, that the incident as alleged by Mr. Smith ... led to\u201d the type of fracture he suffered. Thus, the record <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"514\">*514</page-number>supports the finding that Smith suffered only the minor injury of facial swelling as a result of the incident.</p>\n<p id=\"b536-4\">Second, the type of force allegedly used by Officer Daniels (twisting Smith\u2019s arm and pressing him against the wall) was \u201cnot of a sort repugnant to the conscience of mankind.\u201d <em>See Hudson, </em>503 U.S. at 10, 112 S.Ct. at 1000 (quotation marks omitted). Instead, it was similar to the \u201cpush or shove\u201d referenced in <em>Wilkins, </em>which \u201calmost certainly fails to state a valid excessive force claim.\u201d <em>Wilkins, </em>130 S.Ct. at 1178 (quotation marks omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b536-5\">Therefore, even taking Smith\u2019s version of the events as true, any use of force was <em>de minimis </em>and the district court did not err in concluding that no genuine issue of material fact existed about whether Officer Daniels used excessive force in violation of the Eighth Amendment.</p>\n<p id=\"b536-6\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b534-10\">. Smith\u2019s complaint also named as a defendant Walter A. McNeil, the former Secretary of the Florida Department of Corrections. The district court dismissed McNeil from this action before ruling on summary judgment. Smith does not challenge McNeil\u2019s dismissal on appeal, so any issues related to the district court\u2019s dismissal of McNeil have been abandoned. <em>Irwin v. Hawk, </em>40 F.3d 347, 347 n. 1 (11th Cir.1994).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b534-11\">. Smith has raised several other arguments in his brief that are not properly before this Court. Although we liberally construe <em>pro se </em>pleadings, we nonetheless require <em>pro se </em>litigants to \"conform to procedural rules.\u201d <em>Albra v. Advan, Inc., </em>490 F.3d 826, 829 (11th Cir.2007) (quotation marks omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b534-12\">First, Smith makes arguments regarding: (1) the denial of his requests to appoint counsel; (2) the denial of his discovery motions; and (3) the release of his medical records. These issues were raised below and, with the exception of one order addressing Smith's request for a temporary restraining order, were resolved by the Magistrate Judge. However, because Smith \"fail[ed] to timely challenge [the] magistrate\u2019s nondispositive orders] before the district court, [he] waived his right to appeal those orders in this Court.\u201d <em>See Smith v. Sch. Bd. of Orange Cnty., </em>487 F.3d 1361, 1365 (11th Cir.2007).</p>\n<p id=\"b534-19\">Second, Smith makes several arguments that were not raised in the district court. For example, he argues that if his wrist injury actually occurred prior to the assault at issue here, then the \"physicians were deliberately indifferent to [his] serious medical needs.\u201d \"It is well established in this circuit that, absent extraordinary circumstances, legal theories and arguments not raised squarely before the district court cannot be broached for the first time on appeal.\u201d <em>Bryant v. Jones, 575 </em>F.3d 1281, 1308 (11th Cir.2009).</p>\n<p id=\"b534-20\">Third, Smith argues against Officer Daniels\u2019s Motion to Tax Costs. Because the district court deferred ruling on Daniels's motion until after this appeal, there is not a final decision on this issue for us to review. <em>See </em>28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
