He also argues that the district court abused its discretion in confirming the arbitration award because Adams\u2019s due process rights were violated during the arbitration proceedings and because the arbitration award violates Florida public policy.</p>\n<p id=\"b576-3\">We reject Adams\u2019s argument regarding diversity jurisdiction as the district court was not required to consider the citizenship of the individual condominium purchasers because they are not members of Bridgepoint and are not named parties in the district court action. We also find no merit to Adams\u2019s argument that subject matter jurisdiction is lacking because Bridgepoint collusively created diversity jurisdiction in violation of 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1359 by having the arbitrator assign to Bridge-point the claims of the individual investors. The arbitrator correctly determined that, pursuant to the parties\u2019 agreement and under Florida law, Bridgepoint had standing to bring claims on behalf of the condominium purchasers, who were named third-party beneficiaries under the agreement. With regard to Bridgepoint\u2019s federal suit to enforce the arbitration award, Bridgepoint sought to vindicate its own rights under the parties\u2019 agreement, which it was statutorily entitled to do. <em>See </em>9 U.S.C. \u00a7 9. Thus, Bridgepoint\u2019s suit to enforce the arbitration award was not the result of collusive conduct.</p>\n<p id=\"b576-7\">Finally, Adams\u2019s remaining and various arguments attacking the validity of the arbitration award are untimely. The arbitrator issued the arbitration award in February 2010 and Adams did not attempt to challenge the substantive validity of the award until near a year later. The Federal Arbitration Act requires that any motion to vacate an award \u201cmust be served upon the adverse party or his attorney within three months after the award is filed or delivered.... \u201d 9 U.S.C. \u00a7 12; <em>see also Booth v. Hume Pub., Inc., </em>902 F.2d 925, 929 n. 4 (11th Cir.1990) (\u201c[A] party\u2019s failure to move to vacate an arbitral award within the three-month limitations period bars him from raising the alleged invalidity of the award as a defense in opposition to a motion to confirm the award.\u201d). Accordingly, we do not consider these remaining arguments.</p>\n<p id=\"b576-8\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b576-4\">. Other entities, which are not part of this appeal, have also been held liable along with Adams, jointly and severally, for the arbitration award.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
