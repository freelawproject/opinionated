While petitioners\u2019 appeal was pending in this Court, the BIA granted a motion to reopen Porras\u2019s removal proceeding for her and her family. Because a final order of removal no longer exists for Porras, we dismiss the petition with prejudice on Por-ras <footnotemark>2</footnotemark> and proceed only on Elejalde.</p>\n<p id=\"b552-8\">Briefly stated, the petition presents two issues:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b552-9\">1. Whether substantial evidence supports the BIA\u2019s affirmance of the IJ\u2019s adverse-credibility findings.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b552-10\">2. Whether substantial evidence supports the BIA\u2019s affirmance of the IJ\u2019s finding that Elejalde had not been subjected to past persecution, and even if the incidents did amount to persecution, fundamental changes in circumstances showed that a clear probability of future persecution no longer exists.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b552-12\">(Elejalde has abandoned her claim for CAT relief.)</p>\n<p id=\"b552-13\">Substantial evidence supports the BIA\u2019s adverse-credibility determination, as the BIA cited convincing, specific inconsistencies and omissions in the petitioners\u2019 testimony and applications; and the BIA addressed Elejalde\u2019s explanations for those inconsistencies and omissions. Furthermore, even if we were to presume Elejalde\u2019s credibility, Elejalde failed to establish past persecution on account of a statutory ground: even though she was subjected to misconduct that could constitute persecution, she did not establish that the misconduct was on account of her political opinion or any other statutorily protected ground for withholding of removal. <em>Cf. Sanchez Jimenez v. U.S. Att\u2019y. Gen., </em>492 F.3d 1223 (11th Cir.2007) (a less ambiguous record on the point of FARC\u2019s responsibility).</p>\n<p id=\"b552-14\">That evidence in the record might support conclusions other than those reached by the BIA is not enough.</p>\n<p id=\"b552-15\">PETITION DISMISSED IN PART AND DENIED IN PART.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b552-11\">. Elejalde's family also are petitioners in this case, and they relied on Elejalde\u2019s application for their claims for withholding of removal and CAT relief and were similarly denied such relief.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b552-17\">. The motion to dismiss the petition with prejudice as to Petitioner Astrid Isabella Elejalde-Porras is GRANTED. Ms. Porras shall bear her own attorney's fees, costs, and expenses.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
