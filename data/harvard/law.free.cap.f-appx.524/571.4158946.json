Mr. Gelves\u2019s only argument for relief is that he had been kidnapped by the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Columbia (FARC) and his family faces ongoing extortion attempts from the FARC. To establish eligibility for asylum, the asylum applicant must establish that he is a person unable or unwilling to return to his country of nationality \u201cbecause of persecution or a well-founded fear of persecution on account of\u2019 any statutorily enumerated protected grounds, which include the refugee\u2019s political opinion. 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1101(a)(42)(A). To demonstrate a sufficient nexus between political opinion and alleged persecution, an alien must show that he has been or will be persecuted \u201cbecause of\u2019 his actual or imputed political opinion. <em>Rodriguez Morales v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>488 F.3d 884, 890 (11th Cir.2007) (quotation and emphasis omitted). Being targeted by a guerilla group for extortion purposes does not, by itself, constitute persecution on account of political opinion. <em>See Rivera v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>487 F.3d 815, 821-23 (11th Cir.2007) (holding that there was no nexus between persecution and political opinion where the FARC demanded a politically active business owner pay the FARC\u2019s \u201cwar tax,\u201d where the FARC targeted the petitioner (1) for extortion based on the petitioner\u2019s ability to pay, (2) harmed the petitioner after refusal to pay the \u201cwar tax,\u201d and (3) never demanded that the petitioner cease political activities).</p>\n<p id=\"b594-11\">Here, the BIA did not err in affirming the IJ\u2019s denial of Mr. Gelves\u2019s application for asylum because substantial evidence supported the BIA\u2019s determination that Mr. Gelves was not persecuted on account of his actual or imputed political opinion.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> That evidence includes that the FARC targeted Mr. Gelves based on his ability to pay extortion demands and not based on his political views; that in kidnapping Mr. Gelves and threatening him and his family, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"573\">*573</page-number>the FARC only sought monetary payoffs; and, that the FARC made no demands regarding Mr. Gelves\u2019s political opinions. Furthermore, the FARC\u2019s threats against Mr. Gelves after his release from captivity did not constitute persecution on account of a statutorily protected ground because the threats were in furtherance of extorting money from Mr. Gelves and his family. Moreover, even though Mr. Gelves claimed that the FARC tried to indoctrinate and recruit him, his refusal to cooperate with the guerillas was insufficient to establish that he was persecuted due to his political opinion. <em>See Rodriguez Morales, </em>488 F.3d at 890. Mr. Gelves has failed to establish any of his political beliefs, imputed or personal, drove the FARC\u2019s persecution of him and his family. Accordingly, because Mr. Gelves did not establish a nexus between past persecution or a well-founded fear of future persecution and his actual or imputed political belief, he has failed to establish his eligibility for asylum.</p>\n<p id=\"b595-5\">PETITION DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b594-8\">. Mr. Gelves is the lead petitioner and has named his wife, Sandra Cecilia Ardila Martinez, and his children, Nicolas Maldonado Ardila and Santalucia Maldonado Ardila, as his derivative beneficiaries.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b594-9\">. The BIA's order also affirmed the IJ\u2019s decision withholding of removal under 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1231(b)(3) and withholding of removal under the United Nations Convention Against Torture (\u201cCAT\u201d), 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 208.16(c). Mr. Gelves raises no argument on appeal that the BIA erred in denying him withholding of removal or CAT relief and therefore he has abandoned these claims. <em>See Sepulveda v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>401 F.3d 1226, 1228 n. 2 (11th Cir.2005) (\u201cWhen an appellant fails to offer argument on an issue, that issue is abandoned.\u201d). We also do not consider Mr. Gelves's argument that his family constitutes a particular social group because he failed to seek relief on this ground before the IJ and thus has failed to exhaust this claim. <em>See </em>8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(d) (stating that a court may only review a final order of removal if the alien has exhausted all administrative remedies available to the alien).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b594-13\">.We must affirm the BIA's decision \u201cif it is supported by reasonable, substantial, and probative evidence on the record considered as a whole.\" <em>Lopez </em>v. <em>U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>504 F.3d 1341, 1344 (11th Cir.2007) (quotation omitted).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
