After careful review, we affirm in part, vacate in part, and remand with instructions to dismiss Searcy\u2019s \u00a7 2241 petition for lack of jurisdiction.</p>\n<p id=\"b578-20\">As relevant to this appeal, Searcy pleaded guilty in September 2003 to one count of using interstate commerce to engage in sexual activity with a minor, in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2422(b), and was sentenced to 180 months\u2019 imprisonment. In 2006, he filed a motion to vacate his sentence under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255. The district court dismissed the petition, finding Searcy\u2019s claims procedurally barred. Searcy filed the instant petition in 2012, arguing that his guilty plea was involuntary because the district court did not adequately inform him of the statutory maximum sentence. A magistrate judge prepared a report and recommendation, which the district court adopted, concluding that Searcy\u2019s petition should be denied because he \u201chas not made a substantial showing of any kind that he was not fully informed of the possible penalties he was facing\u201d by pleading guilty. This is Searcy\u2019s appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b578-21\">Searcy advances a different argument on appeal.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> He argues that habeas relief is appropriate because the district court applied the incorrect statutory maximum sentence.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> \u201cTypically, collateral attacks on the validity of a federal sentence must be brought under \u00a7 2255.\u201d <em>Darby v. Hawk-Sawyer, </em>405 F.3d 942, 944 (11th Cir.2005). <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"557\">*557</page-number>To proceed under \u00a7 2241, Searcy bears the burden of demonstrating that \u201cthe \u00a7 2255 remedy is inadequate or ineffective to test the legality of his detention.\u201d <em>Turner v. Warden Coleman FCI (Medium), </em>709 F.3d 1328, 1333 (11th Cir.2013) (internal quotation marks omitted). This threshold showing is a jurisdictional requirement; where it is absent, federal courts lack authority to consider the merits of a petitioner\u2019s \u00a7 2241 petition. <em>Williams v. Warden, </em>713 F.3d 1332, 1338 (11th Cir.2013).</p>\n<p id=\"b579-5\">Searcy did not argue, either before the district court or on appeal, that \u00a7 2255 was inadequate or ineffective to test the legality of his detention. And on the record before us, we have no reason to conclude it would be. Hence, the district court lacked jurisdiction to consider his \u00a7 2241 petition. <em>See id. </em>We therefore VACATE the district court\u2019s denial of Searcy\u2019s \u00a7 2241 petition and REMAND to the district court with instructions to dismiss the \u00a7 2241 petition.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b579-6\">AFFIRMED IN PART, VACATED IN PART, AND REMANDED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b578-17\">. We typically do not consider claims that are raised for the first time on appeal. <em>Dohrmann v. United States, </em>442 F.3d 1279, 1282 (11th Cir.2006). But here, because the government did not argue that Searcy's argument is forfeited, we decline to treat it as such.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b578-22\">. Searcy also contends that the United States Attorney violated his oath of office. This argument is meritless.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b579-12\">. To the extent Searcy has argued and properly preserved a claim under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1651, we AFFIRM the district court\u2019s denial of this claim because the district court correctly concluded that Searcy\u2019s sentence was not above the statutory maximum sentence for using interstate commerce to engage in sexual activity with a minor.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
