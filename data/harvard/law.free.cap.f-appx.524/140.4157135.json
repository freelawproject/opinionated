Jackson, federal prisoner # 14519-035, appeals the district court\u2019s denial of a sentence reduction pursuant to 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582(c)(2), the Fair Sentencing. Act, and Amendment 750 to the Sentencing Guidelines. Jackson argues that the district court abused its discretion by denying him a \u00a7 3582(c)(2) sentence reduction without conducting a new evaluation of the 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a) sentencing factors. He maintains that the district court\u2019s reliance on its evaluation of the \u00a7 3553(a) factors at the time of sentencing constituted reversible error.</p>\n<p id=\"b163-7\">The Government argues that the district court did not abuse its discretion by not making a new evaluation of the \u00a7 3553(a) factors because Jackson did not present new arguments to the district court that he did not present at sentencing. Alternatively, it maintains that any error was harmless because Jackson did not present evidence or argument that would have changed the district court\u2019s evaluation of the \u00a7 3553(a) factors.</p>\n<p id=\"b163-8\">Jackson asserts that the argument he presented, that failing to reduce his sentence would result in his receiving a higher sentence because he provided substantial assistance, was an argument falling under \u00a7 3553(a)(6), which provides that unwarranted sentence disparities should be avoided. He contends that the mitigation information that he filed the day after the district court\u2019s final ruling constitutes new information affecting the evaluation of the \u00a7 3553(a) factors.</p>\n<p id=\"b163-9\">We review a district court\u2019s decision \u201cwhether to reduce a sentence pursuant to ... \u00a7 3582(c)(2) for abuse of discretion, ... its interpretation of the Guidelines <em>de novo, </em>and its findings of fact for clear error.\u201d <em>United States v. Henderson, </em>636 F.3d 713, 717 (5th Cir.2011) (internal quotation marks and citation omitted). When a court in applying its discretion fails to consider the factors as required by law, it ... abuses its discretion.\u201d <em>United States v. Larry, </em>632 F.3d 933, 936 (5th Cir.2011) (internal quotation marks and citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b163-12\">The district court implicitly ruled that Jackson was eligible for a sentence reduction under \u00a7 3582(c)(2), but it determined that a reduction should not be granted. In denying Jackson a sentence reduction, it stated that Jackson \u201cpreviously received adjustment under a Government motion filed pursuant to 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(e) at which time the Court had determined a total sentence pursuant to 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a) factors. Accordingly, the Court will not reduce the Defendant\u2019s sentence further.\u201d This language shows that the district court abused its discretion by failing to conduct the required contemporaneous review of the \u00a7 3553(a) factors. <em>See Henderson, </em>636 F.3d at 718-19.</p>\n<p id=\"b163-13\">While Jackson did not present any arguments that directly related to the \u00a7 3553(a) factors prior to the ruling of the district court, he did make an argument that failing to reduce his sentence would negate the credit he received for providing substantial assistance. Given that Jackson raised a new argument, that the district court did not conduct a contemporaneous evaluation of the \u00a7 3553(a) factors, and that the district court did not give any indication as to the conclusion it would have made if it had made a contemporaneous evaluation of the \u00a7 3553(a) factors, the Government has not met its burden of showing harmless error by providing \u201csuf<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"142\">*142</page-number>ficient evidence to convince the appellate court that the district court would have imposed the same sentence, absent the error.\u201d <em>United States v. Ibarra-Luna, </em>628 F.3d 712, 718 (5th Cir.2010) (internal quotation marks and citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b164-4\">Accordingly, the ruling of the district court is vacated and this case is remanded to the district court for a reevaluation of Jackson\u2019s request for relief under \u00a7 3582(c)(2). On remand, the district court should review Jackson\u2019s guidelines sentence range because the record shows that the revised guidelines sentence range calculations presented to the district court included an unwarranted three-level base offense level reduction under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2Dl.l(a)(5) in addition to the two-level base offense level reduction provided by Amendment 750.</p>\n<p id=\"b164-5\">VACATED AND REMANDED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b163-10\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
