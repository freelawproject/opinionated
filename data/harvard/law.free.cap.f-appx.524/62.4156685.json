We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b84-24\">Ekmark is a former psychiatry resident at the University of Texas Health Science Center at San Antonio (\u201cUTHSC\u201d). Matthews was the program director for the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"63\">*63</page-number>Psychiatric Residency Program, and Bready oversaw UTHSC\u2019s Graduate Medical Education program. The psychiatry program requirements included providing clinical care at the University Hospital and local Veterans Affairs (\u201cVA\u201d) facilities.</p>\n<p id=\"b85-5\">About September 2008, during Ek-mark\u2019s fourth and final year of the program, an acquaintance and UTHSC employee told Bready that Ekmark had admitted to an inappropriate relationship with a VA hospital patient. As a result, UTHSC suspended Ekmark\u2019s patient-care duties pending an investigation and offered him at least two opportunities to present his account of the situation, but he continued to deny the allegations. UTHSC notified the Texas Medical Board of the suspension, causing the Board to suspend Ekmark\u2019s physician-in-training permit.</p>\n<p id=\"b85-6\">The VA was notified and began an investigation, during which UTHSC placed the matter on hold. About November, the VA\u2019s Administrative Investigation Board sent UTHSC a summary of its conclusion that the allegations were more likely true than not and that, as a result, the VA had revoked Ekmark\u2019s privileges at all VA facilities. Ekmark informed UTHSC that he would appeal the VA\u2019s determination; in the meantime, UTHSC maintained the suspension.</p>\n<p id=\"b85-7\">Although on clinical suspension, Ekmark was paid through the end of the fourth-year contract. Because, however, he could not complete his clinical duties, including his rotations at the VA, he did not receive the psychiatry certification.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> It is undisputed that he requested a formal grievance hearing but never received one.</p>\n<p id=\"b85-8\">Ekmark sued Matthews and Bready, alleging a deprivation of due process and seeking damages and other relief. The district court granted summary judgment, finding that Ekmark had no protected property interest in his certification or ongoing education and was not entitled, under the Fourteenth Amendment, to a formal grievance hearing. The court continued that, even assuming <em>arguendo </em>a property interest in continuing his residency, Ekmark had received the required due-process protections.</p>\n<p id=\"b85-11\">We review <em>de novo </em>a summary judgment, affirming on any basis supported by the record, even if different from the district court\u2019s reasoning. <em>Reed v. Neopost USA, Inc., </em>701 F.3d 434, 438 (5th Cir.2012). Summary judgment is appropriate where there is \u201cno genuine dispute as to any material fact and the movant is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.\u201d FED. R. CIV. P. 56(a).</p>\n<p id=\"b85-12\">\u201cThe Fourteenth Amendment\u2019s procedural protection of property is a safeguard of the security of interests that a person has already acquired in specific benefits.\u201d <em>Bd. of Regents of State Colls. v. Roth, </em>408 U.S. 564, 576, 92 S.Ct. 2701, 33 L.Ed.2d 548 (1972). Even assuming <em>arguendo </em>Ek-mark had any property interest in continuing his residency and achieving certification, he received all the process to which he was entitled under the Fourteenth Amendment. <em>See Davis v. Mann, </em>882 F.2d 967, 973 (5th Cir.1989).</p>\n<p id=\"b85-13\">In the context of due process, medical residents are students rather than employees of the hospital. <em>Shaboon v. Duncan, </em>252 F.3d 722, 729 (5th Cir.2001). \u201cIt is well-known that the primary purpose of a residency program is not employment or a stipend, but the academic training and the academic certification for successful completion of the program.\u201d <em>Davis, </em>882 F.2d at 974. In recognition of the complex student-faculty relationship, students are not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"64\">*64</page-number>entitled to the same due process protections as are employees. <em>Shaboon, </em>252 F.3d at 730.</p>\n<p id=\"b86-4\">We further distinguish between the process required for students facing discipline and academic actions that require \u201cfar less stringent procedural requirements.\u201d <em>Bd. of Curators of Univ. of Mo. v. Horowitz, </em>435 U.S. 78, 86, 98 S.Ct. 948, 55 L.Ed.2d 124 (1978); <em>see also Davis, </em>882 F.2d at 974. Educational institutions \u201cshould not be weighted down with formalized procedural requirements imposed by actors estranged from the academic environment.\u201d <em>Davis, </em>882 F.2d at 974. The physicians and administrators directing residency programs are in the best position to determine which candidates are suited to progress through the program and have satisfactorily completed the requirements for certification. <em>Id. </em>Adverse academic actions against medical residents require only the minimum procedure of notice and not a hearing. <em>Horowitz, </em>435 U.S. at 90, 98 S.Ct. 948; <em>see also Shaboon, </em>252 F.3d at 731.</p>\n<p id=\"b86-5\">Bready and Matthew\u2019s determination that Ekmark was unable to fulfill the clinical residency requirements, and was thus unqualified for certification, was academic in nature. Despite that the underlying disciplinary actions by the VA affected Ek-mark\u2019s capacity to meet the certification prerequisites, his inability to complete the program \u201cfurnished a sound academic basis for [the denial of certification].\u201d <em>Shaboon, </em>252 F.3d at 731.</p>\n<p id=\"b86-6\">Viewing the facts in the light most favorable to Ekmark, he received sufficient process. Matthews notified Ekmark of his suspension and of the hospital\u2019s determination that he would not be able to complete the program if his physician-in-training permit was not renewed. Contrary to Ek-mark\u2019s claims, he was not entitled to a formal hearing. <em>Id. </em>Furthermore, even if a formal hearing was required by UTHSC policy, the UTHSC rules do not establish the constitutional floor of due process. <em>Levitt v. Univ. of Tex. at El Paso, </em>759 F.2d 1224, 1230 (5th Cir.1985).</p>\n<p id=\"b86-8\">The summary judgment is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b84-16\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir.
