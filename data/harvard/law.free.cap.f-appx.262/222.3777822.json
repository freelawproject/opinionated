Caisano-Guapi argues that he should have received a minor-role reduction to his base offense level because his role as a crew member was minor in comparison to both the extent of the drug trafficking scheme and the participation of other members of the conspiracy. Second, Caisano-Guapi argues that the district court imposed an unreasonable sentence because it failed to consider the statutory factors and, instead, imposed a guideline sentence. For the reasons set forth more fully below, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b251-14\">On February 4, 2007, the Coast Guard apprehended a speed boat, commonly referred to as a \u201cgo-fast\u201d boat, that did not display any indication of nationality, in international waters approximately 380 nautical miles southwest of Punta Negra, Peru. Coast Guard officers boarded the go-fast boat and took the crew, identified as lir\u00f3n Benitez-Aprilla, Amin HernandezPerea, Carlos Molano-Valencia, Caisano-Guapi, and Jose Luis Huila-Cortes; and 41 bales of cocaine, weighing a total of 995 kilograms, into custody. From the postMiranda<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> statements of several crew members, the Coast Guard determined that an individual named \u201cNer\u00f3n\u201d met and hired the crew members in Buenaventura, Colombia, and that Hernandez-Perea was the go-fast boat\u2019s captain. At sentencing, Caisano-Guapi stated that he was the go-fast boat\u2019s \u201cmachinist.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b251-15\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b251-16\">We review a district court\u2019s denial of a minor-role reduction for clear error. <em>United States v. De Varon, </em>175 F.3d 930, 937 (11th Cir.1999) <em>(en </em>banc). We cannot find clear error unless we are \u201cleft with a definite and firm conviction that a mistake has been committed.\u201d <em>United States v. Crawford, </em>407 F.3d 1174, 1177 (11th Cir. 2005) (quotation marks omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b251-17\">Section 3B1.2(b) of the United States Sentencing Guidelines provides for a two-level reduction in a defendant\u2019s base offense level if the court determines that he was a minor participant in the offense. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"224\">*224</page-number>U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3B 1.2(b). A minor participant means any participant \u201cwho is less culpable than most other participants, but whose role could not be described as minimal.\u201d U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3B 1.2(b), comment. (n.5); <em>see also De Varon, </em>175 F.3d at 944. The defendant bears the burden of proving by a preponderance of the evidence that he is entitled to a minor-role adjustment. <em>De Varon, </em>175 F.3d at 939. Moreover, a conspiracy can exist in which no participant plays a minor-role. <em>See United States v. Zaccardi, </em>924 F.2d 201, 203 (11th Cir. 1991).</p>\n<p id=\"b252-4\">In determining whether a defendant played a minor role in the offense for which he has been held accountable, the district court first \u201cmust measure the defendant\u2019s role against the relevant conduct attributed to [him] in calculating [his] base offense level.\u201d <em>De Varon, </em>175 F.3d at 944. Second, the district court \u201cmay also measure the defendant\u2019s role against the other participants ... in that relevant conduct.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 945. \u201c[T]he district court may consider only those participants who were involved in the relevant conduct attributed to the defendant. The conduct of participants in any larger criminal conspiracy is irrelevant.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 944.</p>\n<p id=\"b252-5\">With respect to the first prong of the <em>De Var\u00f3n </em>test, Caisano-Guapi failed to show that he played a minor-role in the relevant conduct for which he was held accountable at sentencing. Caisano-Guapi\u2019s base level offense was founded on the transport of 995 kilograms of cocaine. Caisano-Guapi made no objection to the 995 kilograms of cocaine that he possessed on the vessel nor to his participation in the cocaine\u2019s transport. Therefore, the relevant conduct for which he was held accountable was identical to his actual conduct in the offense, and his claim fails under the first prong of <em>De Varan. Id. </em>at 941.</p>\n<p id=\"b252-6\">Indeed, the large amount of cocaine is dispositive. <em>See id. </em>at 943 (\u201c[T]he amount of drugs imported is a material consideration in assessing a defendant\u2019s role in [his] relevant conduct.... [W]e do not foreclose the possibility that [the] amount of drugs may be dispositive.... \u201d). Caisano-Guapi\u2019s argument that the large amount of drugs is indicative of a broader conspiracy is contrary to <em>De Varan, </em>in which we held that the conduct of participants in a broader conspiracy is irrelevant to the determination of a mitigating role reduction. <em>See id. </em>at 944.</p>\n<p id=\"b252-7\">With respect to the second prong <em>of </em>the <em>De Var\u00f3n </em>test, the evidence is insufficient to show that Caisano-Guapi was a minor participant in comparison to other defendants, aside from the boat\u2019s captain. Caisano-Guapi failed to produce any evidence to distinguish himself from his codefendants in the relevant conduct. Furthermore, the record does not contain any additional information that would differentiate Caisano-Guapi from the other crew members of the go-fast boat. Contrary to Caisano-Guapi\u2019s assertion that the individuals who may have played roles likely involved in a large drug smuggling operation are \u201cdiscernable,\u201d the record does not contain any evidence regarding the existence or identity of any such individuals, save Ner\u00f3n who hired the crew. Caisano-Guapi failed to prove by a preponderance of the evidence that he is entitled to a minor-role reduction. For all these reasons, the district court did not clearly err by denying Caisano-Guapi a minor-role reduction.</p>\n<p id=\"b252-8\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b252-9\">We have held that, after the Supreme Court\u2019s decision in <em>United States v. Booker, </em>543 U.S. 220, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005), the sentencing court must not only correctly calculate the guideline imprisonment range, but must <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"225\">*225</page-number>treat that range as advisory and impose a reasonable sentence. <em>United States v. Talley, </em>431 F.3d 784, 786 (11th Cir.2005). Specifically, the district court must impose a sentence that is both procedurally and substantively reasonable. <em>United States v. Hunt, </em>459 F.3d 1180, 1182 n. 3 (11th Cir. 2006); <em>Gall v. United States, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 128 S.Ct. 586, 169 L.Ed.2d 445 (2007).</p>\n<p id=\"b253-7\">The Supreme Court has explained that a sentence may be procedurally unreasonable if the district court improperly calculates the guideline imprisonment range, treats the Guidelines as mandatory, fails to consider the appropriate statutory factors, bases the sentence on clearly erroneous facts, or fails to adequately explain its reasoning. <em>Gall, </em>at 597. The Court also has explained that the substantive reasonableness of a sentence is reviewed under an abuse-of-discretion standard. <em>Id. </em>It has suggested that review for substantive reasonableness under this standard involves inquiring whether the factors in 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a) support the sentence in question. <em>Ga,ll, </em>at 602. Although the Supreme Court has noted that \u201ca sentence, independently calculated by the district court in accordance with <em>Booker, </em>that falls within the properly calculated Guidelines range significantly increases the likelihood that the sentence is a reasonable one[,]\u201d we do not presume reasonable a sentence within the properly calculated Guidelines range. <em>United States v. Campbell, </em>491 F.3d 1306, 1312 (11th Cir.2007).</p>\n<p id=\"b253-8\">Pursuant to <em>\u00a7 </em>3553(a), the sentencing court shall impose a sentence \u201csufficient, but not greater than necessary\u201d to comply with the purposes of sentencing listed in \u00a7 3553(a)(2), namely reflecting the seriousness of the offense, promoting respect for the law, providing just punishment for the offense, deterring criminal conduct, protecting the public from future criminal conduct by the defendant, and providing the defendant with needed educational or vocational training or medical care. <em>See </em>18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a)(2). The statute also instructs the sentencing court to consider certain factors, including the nature and circumstances of the offense, the history and characteristics of the defendant, the guideline imprisonment range, and the need to avoid unwarranted sentencing disparities. <em>See </em>18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a)(1), (4), and (6).</p>\n<p id=\"b253-10\">In considering the \u00a7 3553(a) factors and explaining the reasoning behind its choice of sentence, this Court has held that the district court need not discuss, or state that it has explicitly considered, each factor of \u00a7 3553(a). <em>Talley, </em>431 F.3d at 786. Instead, this Court has held that an explicit acknowledgment that the district court has considered the defendant\u2019s arguments and the \u00a7 3553(a) factors will suffice. <em>United States v. Scott, </em>426 F.3d 1324, 1329-30 (11th Cir.2005); <em>see also Rita v. United States, </em>551 U.S. -, 127 S.Ct. 2456, 2469, 168 L.Ed.2d 203 (2007) (holding that the defendant\u2019s sentence was reasonable when the district court considered the parties\u2019 arguments and provided a reasoned basis for its choice of sentence).</p>\n<p id=\"b253-13\">Here, the district court imposed a procedurally reasonable sentence. <em>See Hunt, </em>459 F.3d at 1182 n. 3; <em>Gall, </em>at 597. The district court correctly calculated the guideline imprisonment range, as discussed above, and considered the statutory factors. <em>See Gall, </em>at 597. Regarding the statutory factors, the district court heard Caisano-Guapi\u2019s request for a downward variance based upon his 4-year-old son\u2019s medical condition and treatment. 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a)(1). The district court explicitly acknowledged that it had considered the \u00a7 3553(a) factors. <em>See Scott, </em>426 F.3d at 1329-30. The district court likewise sufficiently explained its reasoning. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"226\">*226</page-number><em>See Gall, </em>at 597. Specifically, in emphasizing the large quantity of cocaine, it acknowledged the seriousness of the crime and the need for deterrence. 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a)(2).</p>\n<p id=\"b254-4\">The district court also imposed a substantively reasonable sentence. <em>See Hunt, </em>459 F.3d at 1182 n. 3; <em>Gall, </em>at 586. The district court was influenced by the seriousness of the offense and the need to impose a sentence sufficient to deter future drug-smuggling crimes. In its discretion, a sentence at the bottom of the guideline sentencing range accomplished these goals. Therefore, the \u00a7 3553(a) factors supported the district court\u2019s sentence, and the district court did not abuse its discretion. <em>See Gall, </em>at 597, 605. Because the district court considered the appropriate factors and appropriately exercised its discretion, it imposed a reasonable sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b254-5\">In light of the foregoing, Caisano-Guapi\u2019s sentence is</p>\n<p id=\"b254-6\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b251-12\">. <em>Miranda v.
