He asserts that he presented substantial evidence that he is Eritrean, including his birth certificate, accompanied by a map showing that his city of birth is part of Eritrea, and his testimony that, because his father is Eritrean, he is considered Eritrean.</p>\n<p id=\"b1017-11\">We review the decision of the BIA, except to the extent that the BIA expressly adopts the IJ\u2019s decision; insofar as the BIA adopts the IJ\u2019s decision, we review the IJ\u2019s decision as well. <em>Al Najjar v. Ashcroft, </em>257 F.3d 1262, 1284 (11th Cir.2001). Because, in the final order of removal, the BIA denied the appeal for the reasons stated both in that decision, as well as its prior decision, in which it adopted and affirmed the IJ\u2019s decision, we review both the BIA\u2019s and the IJ\u2019s decisions. <em>See id. </em>The BIA\u2019s and IJ\u2019s \u201cfindings of fact are reviewed under the substantial evidence test,\u201d and we must affirm the decision \u201cif it is supported by reasonable, substantial, and probative evidence on the record considered as a whole.\u201d <em>Antipova v. U.S. Attorney Gen., </em>392 F.3d 1259, 1261 (11th Cir.2004) (quotation omitted). \u201cTo reverse the fact findings, we must find that the record not only supports reversal, but compels it.\u201d <em>Mendoza v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>327 F.3d 1283, 1287 (11th Cir.2003). In general, the alien bears the burden to prove that he is eligible for relief. 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1158(b)(l)(B)(i).</p>\n<p id=\"b1017-13\">Because Fssahaye\u2019s birth certificate, as well as representations that he made on immigration-related documents prior to his removal hearing, formed substantial evidence supporting the BIA\u2019s finding that Fssahaye was a citizen of Ethiopia, rather than Eritrea, the record does not compel reversal of the BIA\u2019s decision, and we deny the petition for review.</p>\n<p id=\"b1017-14\">Next, Fssahaye argues that the IJ erred by finding that his testimony that he was beaten and held captive in Eritrea was not credible. Because, as discussed above, the BIA\u2019s finding that Fssahaye was a citizen of Ethiopia, and had not demonstrated that he was persecuted there, was supported by substantial evidence, we could deny the petition without reaching the issue of whether substantial evidence supported the IJ\u2019s adverse credibility finding regarding Fssahaye\u2019s claims of persecution in Eritrea, and its attendant denial of relief. In other words, if Fssahaye was not persecuted in Ethiopia, his home country, the IJ and BIA were entitled to deny his application for relief, regardless of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"990\">*990</page-number>whether he was persecuted in some other country, such as Eritrea. However, because the BIA adopted and affirmed the IJ\u2019s decision, in addition to rendering its own decision, we will address the IJ\u2019s findings.</p>\n<p id=\"b1018-4\">An \u201cextremely detailed adverse credibility determination alone may be sufficient to support the IJ\u2019s [or BIA\u2019s] denial of an asylum seeker\u2019s application.\u201d <em>D-Muhumed v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>388 F.3d 814, 818-19 (11th Cir.2004). Once the IJ has given specific, cogent reasons for its adverse credibility determination, \u201c[t]he burden shifts to the alien to show that the IJ\u2019s credibility decision was not supported by specific, cogent reasons or was not based on substantial evidence.\u201d <em>Chen v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>463 F.3d 1228, 1231 (11th Cir.2006). Pursuant to 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1158(b)(l)(B)(iii), as amended by the REAL ID Act \u00a7 101(a)(3),<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> the IJ or BIA may make an adverse credibility determination based on the \u201ctotality of the circumstances,\u201d and deny a claim based on inconsistencies, inaccuracies and falsehoods contained in the evidence, without regard to whether they go to the \u201cheart\u201d of the claim. <em>Chen, </em>463 F.3d at 1232-33. We have held that an inconsistency between an alien\u2019s statements to the IJ and statements to immigration officers may support an adverse credibility finding. <em>See id. </em>at 1232 (noting, <em>inter alia, </em>inconsistency between statements made at IJ hearing regarding details of religious practice and those made during credible fear interview upon entry to the United States).</p>\n<p id=\"b1018-5\">The IJ\u2019s adverse credibility determination was based on specific, cogent reasons that were supported by the record as a whole, and the record does not compel reversal. The IJ accurately noted that: (1) Fssahaye\u2019s testimony that he came to the United States to seek asylum was inconsistent with his statement to the border patrol agent that he came here to seek employment; (2) in his asylum application, he checked a box stating that he had never been detained or imprisoned in a country other than the United States, which was inconsistent with his testimony that he was imprisoned by Eritrean soldiers; and (3) while he represented to a border patrol agent that he was fluent in English, he indicated before the IJ that he could not speak English well.</p>\n<p id=\"b1018-10\">Having carefully reviewed the record and the parties\u2019 briefs, we discern no reversible error, and deny the petition for review.</p>\n<p id=\"b1018-11\">DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1018-6\">. Because the final order of removal was entered after May 11, 2005, the effective date of the REAL ID Act, Pub.L. No. 109-13, 119 Stat. 231 (2005), Fssahaye\u2019s petition is governed by that act. REAL ID Act \u00a7 106(d) (effective May 11, 2005, for all cases in which the final order \"was issued before, on, or after\u201d the effective date).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
