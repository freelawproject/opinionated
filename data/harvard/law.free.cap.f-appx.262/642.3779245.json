For the following reasons, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b671-8\">I. FACTS AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b671-9\">On March 11, 2004, after he was laid off from his job as a door-to-door salesman for a construction company, Bowie filed Disability Insurance Benefits (\u201cDIB\u201d) and Supplemental Security Income (\u201cSSI\u201d) applications with the Social Security Administration (\u201cSSA\u201d), alleging a disability due to hypertension, blurred vision, Bell\u2019s palsy, stomach problems, and anxiety. He was fifty-seven years old at the time. The Commissioner of Social Security (\u201cthe Commissioner\u201d) rejected Bowie\u2019s application. Bowie sought a hearing, and on August 9, 2005, an administrative law judge (\u201cALJ\u201d) heard testimony from Bowie and a vocational expert. The ALJ ruled that Bowie was not disabled and not entitled to any disability payments. The ALJ found that Bowie retained the following residual functional capacity:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b671-10\">The claimant can lift and/or carry twenty pounds occasionally and ten pounds frequently, stand and/or walk about six hours in an eight hour workday, and sit about six hours in an eight hour workday. The claimant can occasionally climb ladders, ropes, and scaffolds, balance, crouch, crawl, and bend. The claimant</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b671-12\">is limited to unskilled work in a low stress environment.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b671-14\">The ALJ concluded that Bowie\u2019s past work as a door-to-door salesman did not require him to perform any activities precluded by his residual functional capacity. The Appeals Council denied Bowie\u2019s request for administrative review, and the ALJ\u2019s decision became the final decision of the Commissioner.</p>\n<p id=\"b671-15\">On August 22, 2006, Bowie filed this suit in federal district court, seeking judicial review of the Commissioner\u2019s decision. The magistrate judge<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> affirmed the Commissioner\u2019s decision, rejecting Bowie\u2019s application for disability benefits. This timely appeal followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b671-16\">II. JURISDICTION AND STANDARD OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b671-17\">We have jurisdiction to hear this appeal under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291 and 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 405(g). We review the Commissioner\u2019s final decision only to determine \u201c(1) whether the Commissioner applied the proper legal standard; and (2) whether the Commissioner\u2019s decision is supported by substantial evidence.\u201d <em>Waters v. Barnhart, </em>276 F.3d 716, 718 (5th Cir.2002) (citing <em>Estate of Morris v. Shalala, </em>207 F.3d 744, 745 (5th Cir.2000)). \u201cSubstantial evidence\u201d is \u201csuch relevant evidence as a reasonable mind might accept as adequate to support a conclusion.\u201d <em>Richardson v. Perales, </em>402 U.S. 389, 401, 91 S.Ct. 1420, 28 L.Ed.2d 842 (1971) (internal quotation marks omitted). It is more than a scintilla and less than a preponderance. <em>Id. </em>The appeals court \u201ccannot reweigh the evidence, but may only scrutinize the record to determine whether it contains substan<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"644\">*644</page-number>tial evidence to support the Commissioner\u2019s decision.\u201d <em>Leggett v. Chater, </em>67 F.3d 558, 564 (5th Cir.1995).</p>\n<p id=\"b672-4\">III. DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b672-5\">For purposes of DIB and SSI eligibility, a person is disabled if he or she is unable \u201cto engage in any substantial gainful activity by reason of any medically determinable physical or mental impairment which can be expected to result in death or which has lasted or can be expected to last for a continuous period of not less than 12 months.\u201d 42 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 423(d)(1)(A), 1382c(a)(l)(A). In evaluating a claim of disability, the Commissioner follows a five-step sequential analysis: (1) The claimant must not currently be working in any \u201csubstantial gainful activity.\u201d 20 C.F.R. \u00a7 404.1520(b). (2) The claimant must establish that he has a \u201csevere\u201d impairment\u2014\u201cany impairment or combination of impairments which significantly limits [his] physical or mental ability to do basic work activities.... \u201d <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 404.1520(c). (3) To secure a finding of disability without consideration of age, education, and work experience, a claimant must establish that his impairment \u201cmeets or equals\u201d an impairment enumerated in the listing of impairments in the appendix to the regulations.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 404.1520(d). (4) If the impairment does not meet or equal a listed impairment, the claimant must establish that his \u201cresidual functional capacity\u201d <footnotemark>3</footnotemark> prevents him from doing \u201cpast relevant work.\u201d <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 404.1520(e), (f). (5) If the Commissioner makes a threshold showing that the claimant can perform some other relevant work, the claimant must then prove that he cannot in fact perform that work. <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 404.1520(g); <em>see also Muse v. Sullivan, </em>925 F.2d 785, 789 (5th Cir.1991) (per curiam) (applying the five-step process). The claimant has the burden to show the first four factors; if the analysis continues to the fifth step, the Commissioner must carry the burden. <em>Muse, </em>925 F.2d at 789. In this case, the ALJ determined under step four that Bowie\u2019s residual functional capacity did not prevent him from doing his past relevant work.</p>\n<p id=\"b672-10\">In the instant appeal, Bowie argues that (1) the ALJ\u2019s conclusions regarding Bowie\u2019s ability to perform his past relevant work are not supported by substantial evidence, and (2) the ALJ\u2019s findings regarding Bowie\u2019s credibility were not based on the proper legal standard.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b672-11\">First, Bowie argues that the ALJ did not properly consider Bowie\u2019s impairments in determining his ability to do past relevant work. In particular, Bowie claims the ALJ failed to take into account his claim that fatigue and the need to take frequent breaks prevent him from doing his previous work. We find that Bowie\u2019s vague assertions of fatigue are insufficient to show a lack of sufficient evidence underlying the ALJ\u2019s decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b672-12\">As an initial matter, the ALJ did consider Bowie\u2019s fatigue and need to take frequent breaks. In the ALJ\u2019s hypothetical question to the vocational expert, and in his findings, the ALJ took into account that Bowie only could work six hours in an <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"645\">*645</page-number>eight-hour work day. In addition, the medical evidence in the record and Bowie\u2019s own testimony support the ALJ\u2019s finding of residual functional capacity. The ALJ considered Bowie\u2019s medical symptoms and determined that his anxiety, stomach problems, Bell\u2019s palsy, blurred vision, dizziness, and headaches were not \u201csevere.\u201d Bowie testified before the ALJ that he wears glasses for his blurred vision, he no longer has problems with anxiety, he could not remember which side of his face was affected by Bell\u2019s palsy, and he claimed no stomach pain since December 2000. The ALJ found Bowie\u2019s claims of dizziness and headaches inconsistent with his medical record. Although Bowie\u2019s hypertension was a potentially severe condition, the ALJ found that it was controlled adequately by medication and therefore not \u201csevere\u201d under the regulations. <em>See Johnson v. Bowen, </em>864 F.2d 340, 348 (5th Cir.1988) (holding that a condition controlled by medication was not a basis for a finding of disability). Moreover, the record shows that Bowie performed his previous work despite his hypertension. <em>See Fraga v. Bowen, </em>810 F.2d 1296, 1305 &amp; n. 11 (5th Cir.1987) (reasoning that a claimant\u2019s previous ability to work despite hypertension supported the ALJ\u2019s finding of no disability). Therefore, we conclude that the ALJ\u2019s finding of residual functional capacity was supported by substantial evidence.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b673-5\">Regarding the ALJ\u2019s determination of the credibility of Bowie\u2019s testimony, Bowie argues that the ALJ failed to consider the \u201clocation, duration, frequency, and intensity\u201d of his medical symptoms and therefore failed to apply the proper legal standard. Specifically, Bowie claims that the ALJ failed to take proper account of the side effects from his medication. However, the only evidence of side effects appears in vague statements on forms Bowie submitted to the SSA. Bowie did not mention side effects diming his hearing, nor is there a record that he complained of side effects to his doctors. We find that Bowie\u2019s claim of side effects does not undermine the ALJ\u2019s finding of no disability.</p>\n<p id=\"b673-8\">More broadly, the ALJ found Bowie\u2019s claims of disability inconsistent with the evidence as a whole. In evaluating the credibility of Bowie\u2019s subjective claims of disability, the ALJ cited the proper legal standard and recognized his duty to consider all medical symptoms, including medical records and the plaintiffs testimony. <em>See </em>20 C.F.R. \u00a7\u00a7 404.1527, 404.1529, 416.927, 416.929. In this case, the ALJ concluded that Bowie\u2019s claims of pain were not supported by the record: \u201cThe claimant presents himself as being much worse than that which is contained in the record.\u201d In drawing this conclusion, the ALJ properly took into account Bowie\u2019s testimony about his ability to engage in normal daily activities. <em>See </em>20 C.F.R. \u00a7\u00a7 404.1529(c)(3), 416.929(c)(3) (listing \u201cdaily activities\u201d as a factor the Commissioner may consider in evaluating a claimant\u2019s symptoms). For example, the ALJ considered that Bowie lived alone, walked one to one-and-a-half miles daily for exercise, did yard work, washed dishes, did laundry, cooked his own meals, drove, shopped, and visited with his family. <em>See Kraemer v. Sullivan, </em>885 F.2d 206, 208-09 (5th Cir. 1989) (finding that a claimant\u2019s ability to do daily tasks undermined his claim that his hypertension was disabling). The ALJ <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"646\">*646</page-number>also observed that Bowie previously performed his work with the same medical conditions he currently has and that he lost his job due to a layoff unrelated to his medical condition. Therefore, we conclude that by fully considering Bowie\u2019s testimony and medical history, the ALJ applied the proper legal standard in evaluating the credibility of Bowie\u2019s disability claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b674-4\">IV. CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b674-5\">We conclude that the Commissioner\u2019s final decision denying Bowie\u2019s request for disability benefits was supported by substantial evidence and was based on the proper legal standard. Therefore, we affirm the district court\u2019s judgment in favor of the Commissioner.</p>\n<p id=\"b674-6\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b671-11\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
