This court generally lacks jurisdiction to review a final order of removal of an alien, such as Asare, who has been convicted of an aggravated felony. <em>See </em>8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(a)(2)(C). However, the court retains jurisdiction over constitutional claims or questions of law which were raised and exhausted before the BIA. \u00a7 1252(a)(2)(D), (d)(1); <em>Falek v. Gonzales, </em>475 F.3d 285, 289 (5th Cir.2007).</p>\n<p id=\"b623-21\">Asare\u2019s challenge to his underlying state court conviction is unavailing. A final conviction \u201cprovides a valid basis for deportation unless it is overturned in a judicial post-conviction proceeding.\u201d <em>Zinnanti v. INS, </em>651 F.2d 420, 421 (5th Cir.1981). Asare has made no showing that his conviction has been overturned, and he may not collaterally attack the validity of his conviction in immigration proceedings. <em>Brown v. INS, </em>856 F.2d 728, 730-31 (5th Cir.1988); <em>see Taylor v. United States, </em>396 F.3d 1322, 1329 (11th Cir.2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b623-22\">Asare asserts that he was entitled to due process and that aliens who are precluded from offering evidence in support of claims for relief or to rebut charges of criminal conduct are denied due process. Because Asare did not raise this claim before the BIA, we lack jurisdiction to review it. <em>See </em>\u00a7 1252(d)(1); <em>Falek, </em>475 F.3d at 289. Moreover, Asare makes no argument, and makes no citation to the record showing, that he was precluded from offering any evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b623-23\">There is no factual basis for Asare\u2019s claims that the BIA denied a motion to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"596\">*596</page-number>reopen alleging ineffective assistance of counsel, that the BIA erred in its summary denial of his motion to reopen, \u201cwhere the Petitioner merely claimed a right to be heard before that tribunal, regarding an Immigration Judge\u2019s earlier decision that granted his claim for relief from deportation,\u201d or that he was not informed of his obligation to respond to the Government\u2019s brief to the BIA, which sought to overturn the IJ\u2019s decision</p>\n<p id=\"b624-4\">In support of his conclusional claim that his rights were not protected during the immigration proceeding, Asare cites cases which address possible due process violations resulting from the denial of counsel or following the withdrawal of counsel. Neither situation exists in the instant case.</p>\n<p id=\"b624-5\">Asare\u2019s petition for review is DENIED. Respondent\u2019s motion for summary dismissal or, alternatively, extension of time to file a brief is DENIED as moot.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b623-18\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
