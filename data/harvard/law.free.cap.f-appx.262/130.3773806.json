Jiminez argues that the district court erred when it failed to rule on Jiminez\u2019s motion for a downward departure based on over-representation of his criminal history, <em>see </em>United States Sentencing Guidelines \u00a7 4A1.3(b) (Nov.2005), and imposed an unreasonable sentence. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b159-15\">Jiminez first argues that he moved for a downward departure based on over-representation of his criminal history category, <em>see </em>U.S.S.G \u00a7 4A1.3(b), and the district court committed procedural error when it failed to rule on that motion before sentencing Jiminez. The government responds that Jiminez never moved for a downward departure, but instead asked for a variance. We agree with the government.</p>\n<p id=\"b159-16\">Jiminez did not raise any objection about the failure to consider a downward departure. Jiminez filed a pre-sentence \u201cRequest To Be Sentenced Below the Advisory Guideline Range,\u201d and argued, \u201cA review of the factors announced in 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a) mitigate against such a harsh sentence.\u201d Jiminez asked for \u201ca reasonable sentence\u201d below the recommended Guidelines range, but did not ask for a \u201cdeparture\u201d or reference section 4A1.3(b). At sentencing, Jiminez again argued about the characteristics of his criminal history, but did not ask for a \u201cdeparture\u201d or reference section 4A 1.3(b). The district court did not err when it treated Jiminez\u2019s request as an argument for a variance instead of as a motion for a downward departure. To the extent that Jiminez contends that the district court committed plain error, his argument fails because the record establishes that the district court considered the advisory Guidelines and there is nothing in the record to suggest that the district court was ignorant of its authority to grant a downward departure.</p>\n<p id=\"b159-17\">Jiminez next argues that the district court imposed an unreasonable sentence. He contends that the advisory sentencing Guideline for unlawful reentry after deportation with a history of a con<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"132\">*132</page-number>viction for a crime of violence is overly harsh and incommensurate with the statutory goals of the immigration statute. Jiminez argues that because the Guidelines range was greater than necessary to effectuate the purposes of sentencing, <em>see </em>18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a), his sentence was unreasonable.</p>\n<p id=\"b160-4\">We review a sentence for reasonableness, <em>United States v. Talley, </em>431 F.3d 784, 785 (11th Cir.2005), which is \u201ca deferential abuse-of-discretion standard,\u201d <em>Gall v. United States, </em>\u2014 U.S.-,-, 128 S.Ct. 586, 590, 169 L.Ed.2d 445 (2007). We \u201cmust first ensure that the district court committed no significant procedural error, such as failing to calculate (or improperly calculating) the Guidelines range, treating the Guidelines as mandatory, failing to consider the \u00a7 3553(a) factors, selecting a sentence based on clearly erroneous facts, or failing to adequately explain the chosen sentence.\u201d <em>Gall, </em>at 597. We then \u201cconsider the substantive reasonableness of the sentence imposed under an abuse-of-discretion standard.\u201d <em>Id. </em>\u201c[W]hen the district court imposes a sentence within the advisory Guidelines range, we ordinarily will expect that choice to be a reasonable one.\u201d <em>Talley, </em>431 F.3d at 788.</p>\n<p id=\"b160-7\">The district court did not abuse its discretion when it imposed on Jiminez a sentence of 70 months of imprisonment. The transcript of the sentencing hearing establishes that the district court sentenced Jiminez after careful consideration of Jimenzez\u2019s arguments in favor of mitigation, the advisory sentencing Guidelines, and the sentencing factors of section 3553(a). The district court stated that, although Jiminez\u2019s criminal history \u201cdoes indicate not serious offenses,\u201d it also indicated that Jiminez \u201cdoesn\u2019t think the rules apply to him.\u201d Jiminez\u2019s sentence at the low end of</p>\n<p id=\"b160-8\">the advisory guidelines range, was reasonable.</p>\n<p id=\"b160-9\">Jiminez\u2019s sentence is AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
