Barrera-Renteria challenged his eighty-four-month sentence on appeal; we vacated the sentence and remanded to the district court for resentencing in light of <em>United </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"542\">*542</page-number><em>States v. Booker, </em>543 U.S. 220, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005). <em>See United States v. Barreras-Renteria, </em>185 Fed.Appx. 313 (4th Cir.2006) (unpublished). The district court adopted without objection the same sentencing guidelines calculations it adopted at the initial sentencing and sentenced Barrera-Renteria to seventy months\u2019 imprisonment, at the bottom of the guidelines range. Barrera-Renteria again challenges his sentence on appeal, claiming it is unreasonable. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b570-4\">In imposing a sentence after <em>Booker, </em>courts still must calculate the applicable guideline range after making the appropriate findings of fact and then consider the range in conjunction with other relevant factors under the guidelines and \u00a7 3553(a). <em>United States v. Moreland, </em>437 F.3d 424, 432 (4th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>547 U.S. 1142, 126 S.Ct. 2054, 164 L.Ed.2d 804 (2006). We will affirm a <em>post-Booker </em>sentence if it is within the statutorily prescribed range and is reasonable. <em>Id. </em>at 433. A sentence within the proper advisory guidelines range is presumptively reasonable. <em>United States v. Johnson, </em>445 F.3d 339, 341 (4th Cir.2006); <em>see Rita v. United States, </em>\u2014 U.S.-, 127 S.Ct. 2456, 2462-69, 168 L.Ed.2d 203 (2007) (upholding presumption of reasonableness to within-guidelines sentence).</p>\n<p id=\"b570-7\">Barrera-Renteria contends the district court imposed an unreasonable sentence because it did not grant him a variance below the properly calculated sentencing guidelines range. He argued at resentencing his case was distinguishable from many other illegal reentry cases because of his particular history and characteristics and because he did not have an opportunity to take part in the fast-track program available in other districts. Barrera-Renteria\u2019s contention fails. <em>See Johnson, </em>445 F.3d at 345 (stating district court need not \u201crobotically tick through \u00a7 3553(a)\u2019s every subsection\u201d or \u201cexplicitly discuss every \u00a7 3553(a) factor on the record\u201d) (internal quotations and citation omitted); <em>United States v. Perez-Pena, </em>453 F.3d 236, 243-45 (4th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>-U.S.-, 127 S.Ct. 542, 166 L.Ed.2d 401 (2006) (holding sentencing disparities between defendants receiving and defendants not receiving fast-track downward departures \u201cwarranted\u201d as matter of law and do not justify imposition of below-guidelines variance sentence). Resentencing was conceptually simple, the district court considered the arguments presented at the resentencing hearing, and the court was not required to comment more extensively. <em>See Rita, </em>127 S.Ct. at 2469. We conclude the sentence was reasonable.</p>\n<p id=\"b570-11\">Accordingly, we affirm Barrera-Renteria\u2019s sentence. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b570-12\">\n<em>AFFIRMED.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
