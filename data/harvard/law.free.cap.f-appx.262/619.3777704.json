Lin specifically contends that he should be permitted to file a new asylum application pursuant to INA \u00a7 208(a)(2)(D), 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1158(a)(2)(D), which provides an exception to the one-year filing deadline for asylum applications.</p>\n<p id=\"b648-4\">This provision governs asylum applications only and is not applicable to the reopening of removal proceedings. INA \u00a7 208(a)(2)(D), 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1158(a)(2)(D). Rather, 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1003.2(c)(3)(ii) expressly applies to aliens under final orders of removal seeking to apply or reapply for asylum. The BIA did not abuse its discretion in finding that Lin could not avail himself of INA \u00a7 208(a)(2)(D) because the provision does not apply to aliens under final orders of removal. <em>See Alaska Dep\u2019t of Envtl. Conservation v. EPA, </em>540 U.S. 461, 489 &amp; n. 13, 124 S.Ct. 983, 157 L.Ed.2d 967 (2004).</p>\n<p id=\"b648-5\">Because Lin does not assert that the BIA abused its discretion in finding that he did not meet the time and number limitation exceptions outlined in 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1003.2(c)(3)(ii), we decline to consider the issue. <em>See Thuri v. Ashcroft, </em>380 F.3d 788, 793 (5th Cir.2004). Accordingly, Lin\u2019s petition for review is DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b647-32\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir.
