Betanzos-Centeno was sentenced within his properly calculated range under the United States Sentencing Guidelines. Betanzos-Centeno argues that the district court erred in imposing his sentence because it required him to overcome a legal presumption that the guidelines range should apply or that the guidelines range was reasonable. Betanzos-Centeno also argues that the district court erred by sentencing him based on a standard of reasonableness, without proper assessment of the factors set forth in 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a).</p>\n<p id=\"b609-24\">Because Betanzos-Centeno\u2019s instant arguments were not presented before the district court, they must satisfy the standards of plain error review. <em>See United States v. Willingham, </em>497 F.3d 541, 544 (5th Cir.2007); <em>United States v. Hernandez-Martinez, </em>485 F.3d 270, 272-73 (5th Cir.), cert. <em>denied, </em>\u2014 U.S.-, 128 S.Ct. 325, 169 L.Ed.2d 229 (2007). Betanzos-Centeno has not established plain error. In rejecting Betanzos-Centeno\u2019s request for a below-guidelines sentence, the district court did not place any burden on Betanzos-Centeno to overcome a presumption in favor of the guidelines range. His sentence was imposed with sufficient consideration of the \u00a7 3553(a) factors and is not unreasonable. <em>See United States v. Mares, </em>402 F.3d 511, 518-19 (5th Cir. 2005); <em>United States v. Alonzo, </em>435 F.3d 551, 554 (5th Cir.2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b609-27\">Betanzos-Centeno also contends that his sentence is unreasonable because this court\u2019s <em>post-Booker </em>rulings have effectively reinstated the mandatory guidelines regime condemned in <em>Booker. </em>Betanzos-Centeno concedes that this argument is foreclosed under circuit precedent, but seeks to preserve it for further review, citing the Supreme Court\u2019s granting of certiorari in <em>Gall v. United States, </em>\u2014 U.S.-, 127 S.Ct. 2933, 168 L.Ed.2d 261 (2007), and <em>Kimbrough v. United States, </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"582\">*582</page-number>\u2014 U.S.-, 127 S.Ct. 2933, 168 L.Ed.2d 261 (2007). Both <em>Gall </em>and <em>Kimbrough </em>have now been decided, and they do not impact this court\u2019s review of the reasonableness of Betanzos-Centeno\u2019s sentence. <em>See Gall v. United States, </em>\u2014 U.S.-, 128 S.Ct. 586, 590-91, 169 L.Ed.2d 445 (2007); <em>Kimbrough v. United States, </em>\u2014 U.S. \u2014-, 128 S.Ct. 558, 559-62, 169 L.Ed.2d 481 (2007). Betanzos-Centeno\u2019s request that his case be held pending the Supreme Court\u2019s decisions in <em>Gall </em>and <em>Kimbrough </em>is DENIED.</p>\n<p id=\"APR\">The judgment of the district court is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b609-20\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
