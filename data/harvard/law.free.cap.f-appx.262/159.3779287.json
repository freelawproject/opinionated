On appeal, James argues that his sentence must be vacated and remanded for resentencing because the district court failed to consider a downward departure for substantial assistance pursuant to <em>Wade v. United States, </em>504 U.S. 181, 112 S.Ct. 1840, 118 L.Ed.2d 524 (1992). James asserts that the government withheld a U.S.S.G. \u00a7 5K1.1 motion to penalize his failure to sign a plea agreement. He maintains that there is a constitutional and statutory right to plead guilty without a plea agreement. Alternatively, he suggests that there is no rational basis for the government\u2019s policy of only filing \u00a7 5K1.1 motions when defendants enter into plea agreements. Thus, he concludes that the district court should have considered imposing a sentence below the statutory mandatory minimum.</p>\n<p id=\"b188-11\">Generally, whether a district court may depart downward from the Guideline range under \u00a7 5K1.1 in the absence of a motion by the government is a question of law subject to de novo review. <em>United States v. Dorsey, </em>497 F.3d 1221, 1224 (11th Cir.2007). Because James did not allege that the government had an unconstitutional motive before the district court, however, we will review only for plain error. <em>United States v. Ward, </em>486 F.3d 1212, 1221 (11th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>- U.S.-, 128 S.Ct. 398, 169 L.Ed.2d 280 (2007). When reviewing for plain error, we cannot reverse \u201cunless there is: (1) error, (2) that is plain, and (3) that affects substantial rights.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(internal quotation marks omitted). If these conditions are met, we may then exercise our discretion to notice a forfeited error, but only if \u201cthe error seriously affects the fairness, integrity, or public reputation of judicial proceedings.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(internal quotation marks omitted). Furthermore, an error is plain only if it is \u201cclear under current law.\u201d <em>United States v. Chau, </em>426 F.3d 1318, 1322 (11th Cir.2005) (per curiam) (internal quotation marks omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b188-15\">Section 5K1.1 of the Guidelines provides that \u201c[ujpon motion of the government stating that the defendant has provided substantial assistance in the investigation or prosecution of another person who has committed an offense, the court may depart from the guidelines.\u201d U.S.S.G. \u00a7 5K1.1. Section 5K1.1 confers the power, but not the duty, to file a motion where a defendant has provided substantial assistance. <em>Dorsey, </em>497 F.3d at 1224. The district court typically cannot grant a downward de<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"161\">*161</page-number>parture under \u00a7 5K1.1 absent a motion by the government. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b189-5\">Where the government refuses to file a motion based on an unconstitutional motive such as race or religion, however, the district court has authority to review and remedy the prosecutor\u2019s decision. <em>Wade, </em>504 U.S. at 185-86, 112 S.Ct. at 1843-44. We recently clarified, moreover, that \u201crefusing to file a \u00a7 5K1.1 motion in retribution for exercising the Sixth Amendment right to a trial by jury is an unconstitutional motive under <em>Wade.\u201d Dorsey, </em>497 F.3d at 1225. A mere claim that a defendant has provided substantial assistance or a general allegation of an improper motive, however, will not warrant a remedy or even an evidentiary hearing. <em>Wade, </em>504 U.S. at 186, 112 S.Ct. at 1844. Review is only appropriate where the defendant alleges and makes a substantial showing that the prosecution refused to file a \u00a7 5K1.1 motion because of a constitutionally impermissible motive. <em>Dorsey, </em>497 F.3d at 1225.</p>\n<p id=\"b189-6\">Upon review of the record and the parties\u2019 briefs, we discern no reversible error. James essentially argues that in refusing to file a \u00a7 5K1.1 motion, the government unconstitutionally penalized him for exercising his right to plead guilty under the Sixth Amendment. This argument is not clearly resolved by \u201cthe explicit language of a statute or rule.\u201d <em>Chau, </em>426 F.3d at 1322 (internal quotation marks omitted). Nor is it clearly resolved by the language of the Sixth Amendment. Thus, the alleged error committed by the district court can be \u201cplain\u201d only if \u201cprecedent from the Supreme Court or this Court directly resolv[es] it.\u201d <em>Id. </em>James relies on no direct authority for his assertion that the government\u2019s refusal to move for a \u00a7 5K 1.1 motion was based on an unconstitutional motive, and neither <em>Wade </em>nor <em>Dorsey </em>directly resolved the question of whether a district court has the authority to grant a downward departure where the government refuses to file a \u00a7 5K1.1 motion because the defendant did not sign a plea agreement.</p>\n<p id=\"b189-8\">Contrary to James\u2019s argument, moreover, we have not construed <em>Wade </em>broadly enough to permit a court to grant a defendant relief when, absent an unconstitutional motive such as race, religion, or another arbitrary classification, the government\u2019s refusal to move for a reduction is not rationally related to any legitimate government end. <em>See United States v. Nealy, </em>232 F.3d 825, 831 (11th Cir.2000) (limiting review of government\u2019s refusal to file substantial assistance motions to claims of unconstitutional motive); <em>United States v. Forney, </em>9 F.3d 1492, 1503 n. 4 (11th Cir.1993) (limiting review of failure to file substantial assistance motion to unconstitutional motive and acknowledging the proper \u201creluctance to enter into the prosecutorial discretion arena of the executive branch\u201d). Therefore, even if we were to assume that the district court erred in failing to consider a downward departure for substantial assistance, any such error was not \u201cplain\u201d because it was not clear under existing law. <em>See Chau, </em>426 F.3d at 1322. Accordingly, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b189-9\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
