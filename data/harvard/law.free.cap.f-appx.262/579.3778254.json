He argues that the sentence imposed is unreasonable. Specifically, Alaniz contends that the district court failed to give adequate consideration to mitigating factors, failed to articulate adequate reasons under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a) for the sentence imposed, and treated the guidelines as mandatory.</p>\n<p id=\"b607-22\">Because the sentence Alaniz received fell within the correctly calculated guidelines range, it is presumptively reasonable. <em>United States v. Alonzo, </em>435 F.3d 551, 554 (5th Cir.2006). The district court\u2019s proper consideration of the \u00a7 3553(a) factors is inferred. <em>See United States v. Mares, </em>402 F.3d 511, 519 (5th Cir.2005), <em>cert. denied, </em>546 U.S. 828, 126 S.Ct. 43, 163 L.Ed.2d 76 (2005). Alaniz has not overcome the presumption of correctness attached to his sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b607-23\">The district court\u2019s judgment is affirmed. The Government\u2019s motion for summary affirmance or, alternatively, for an extension of time to file an appellate brief is denied.</p>\n<p id=\"b607-24\">AFFIRMED; MOTION DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b607-17\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
