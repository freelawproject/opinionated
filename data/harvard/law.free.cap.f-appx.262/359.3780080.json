The complaint named as defendants the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania, District Attorney John Doe, and Public Defender Dave Siqismonti. In his prayer for relief, White sought: (1) a declaration that the acts described in the complaint were unconstitutional (Compl. at H 36); (2) a \u201cpreliminary and permanent injunction\u201d ordering the Commonwealth to appoint counsel at magistrate hearings, to release him from custody, to direct public defenders to comport with the rules of professional conduct and to \u201cimmediately stop acting in concert and or participating with the Commonwealth agents to deny their clients their civil rights\u201d (Compl. at H 37); and (3) one million dollars in compensatory damages, (Compl. at If 38).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b387-21\">On September 20, 2007, the District Court entered an order dismissing the complaint pursuant to <em>Younger v. Harris, </em>401 U.S. 37, 91 S.Ct. 760, 27 L.Ed.2d 669 (1971), because White\u2019s case was ongoing in the Court of Common Pleas. <em>See </em>28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(e)(2)(B)(I). The present appeal followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b387-22\">We have jurisdiction over this appeal pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291. We will dismiss the appeal pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(e)(2)(B)(I). First, to the extent <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"360\">*360</page-number>that White sought to enjoin his criminal prosecution, the District Court\u2019s abstention was proper. <em>Younger </em>abstention is required where there are continuing state proceedings that: (1) are judicial in nature; (2) implicate important state interests; and (3) afford an adequate opportunity for presentation of the constitutional claims. <em>See Anthony v. Council, </em>316 F.3d 412, 418 (3d Cir.2003). All three predicate requirements were met in this case. White\u2019s criminal trial was pending in state court at the time he filed this action, the state has a long-recognized important interest in enforcing its own criminal laws, and White could have challenged the constitutionality of his arrest, detention, and representation at his criminal trial. Moreover, the extraordinary circumstances envisioned by <em>Younger </em>were not present here. <em>See Port Auth. Police Benev. Ass\u2019n, Inc. v. Port Auth. of N. Y. &amp; N.J. Police Dep't, </em>973 F.2d 169, 176 (3d Cir.1992).</p>\n<p id=\"b388-4\">Furthermore, to the extent that White sought release from custody, his sole federal remedy is a writ of habeas corpus. <em>See Preiser v. Rodriguez, </em>411 U.S. 475, 500, 93 S.Ct. 1827, 36 L.Ed.2d 439 (1973). Finally, to the extent that White was asking the District Court to issue an edict to all Commonwealth public defenders, such a request is clearly not cognizable under Section 1983.</p>\n<p id=\"b388-5\">Accordingly, we will dismiss the appeal under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(e)(2)(B)(I). We will deny White\u2019s motion under Federal Rules of Civil Procedure 15(a) and 19(a) to amend the complaint, as those rules govern the procedure in the United States district courts, not the courts of appeals.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> <em>See </em>Fed.R.Civ.P. 1. We will deny as moot White\u2019s requests to appoint counsel.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b387-18\">. This action was originally initiated by Karl White, Deen Jones and Anthony Cooper. On September 4, 2007, the District Court granted Jones's and Cooper\u2019s requests to withdraw from the case.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b387-23\">. On September 4, 2007, White filed a petition for \"emergency equitable power relief\u201d in which he asked the District Court to grant his request for injunctive relief before his criminal trial took place on December 10, 2007. The District Court did not take action on this petition.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b388-6\">. White also submitted to this Court a \u201cmotion to amend caption\u201d which, despite its title, likewise sought leave to amend the complaint. As noted above, this Court may not consider a motion to amend the complaint pursuant to Federal Rules of Civil Procedure 15. See Fed.R.Civ.P. 1.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
