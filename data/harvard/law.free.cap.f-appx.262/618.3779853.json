Cortez appeals from an order of the district court denying his motion to reconsider the magistrate judge\u2019s pretrial detention order.</p>\n<p id=\"b647-9\">The district court\u2019s decision rests upon its conclusion that Cortez has failed to establish that any condition or combination of conditions will reasonably ensure the safety of the community if Cortez is released. 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3142(e) &amp; (f). Absent an error of law, this court will uphold a district court\u2019s pretrial detention order if it is supported by the proceedings below. <em>United States v. Rueben, </em>974 F.2d 580, 585 (5th Cir.1992). The same standard of review applies to the denial of a motion to reconsider a detention order. <em>United States v. Hare, </em>873 F.2d 796, 798 (5th Cir.1989).</p>\n<p id=\"b647-10\">Analysis of the factors set forth in \u00a7 3142(g) indicates that the district court\u2019s conclusions are supported by the proceedings below. <em>See Rueben, </em>974 F.2d at 586. The pretrial detention order is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b647-11\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
