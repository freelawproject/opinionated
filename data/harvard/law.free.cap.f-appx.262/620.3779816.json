Ruelas contends that he is eligible for an adjustment of status because 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1255(i) exempts the ground of inadmissibility set forth in 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1182(a)(9)(C)(i)(I). This court has previously upheld as reasonable the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"621\">*621</page-number>BIA\u2019s determination that \u00a7 1255(i) does not exempt the ground of inadmissibility set forth in \u00a7 1182(a)(9)(C)(i)(I). <em>Mortera-Cruz v. Gonzales, </em>409 F.3d 246, 256 (5th Cir.2005). To the extent Ruelas argues that <em>Mortera-C/mz </em>was incorrectly decided, one panel of this court may not overrule a prior panel\u2019s decision in the absence of an intervening contrary or superseding decision by this court sitting en banc or by the United States Supreme Court. <em>See United States v. Ruff, </em>984 F.2d 635, 640 (5th Cir.1993).</p>\n<p id=\"b649-5\">Ruelas also contends that he is eligible for an adjustment of status under \u00a7 1255(i) with a Form 1-212 waiver because a Form 1-212 waiver would cure his inadmissibility under \u00a7 1182(a)(9)(C)(i)(I). This court lacks jurisdiction to review the BIA\u2019s discretionary denial of a Form 1-212 waiver. <em>See </em>8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(a)(2)(B).</p>\n<p id=\"b649-6\">Finally, Ruelas contends that the BIA\u2019s interpretation of \u00a7 1182(a)(9)(C)(i)(I) leaves the statute open to a constitutional attack on equal protection grounds. Ruelas does not identify which classes or groups of immigrants are allegedly treated differently by the BIA\u2019s interpretation of \u00a7 1182(a)(9)(C)(i)(I). Further, this court has held that the conduct proscribed by \u00a7 1182(a)(9)(C)(i)(I) is both different from and more culpable than the conduct of an alien who is inadmissible only under \u00a7 1182(a)(6)(A)\u00ae. <em>Mortera-Cruz, </em>409 F.3d at 255-56. Therefore, Ruelas\u2019s conclusional equal protection claim is without merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b649-7\">Accordingly, Ruelas\u2019s petition for review is DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b648-7\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
