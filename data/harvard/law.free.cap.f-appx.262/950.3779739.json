He is presently appealing his convictions to the Florida District Court of Appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b978-15\">Proceeding <em>pro se, </em>Searcy brought this law suit against the circuit judge who presided over his case, and the lawyer he retained privately to defend him, alleging that the judge denied him his federal constitutional rights in handling the case and the lawyer denied him the effective assistance of counsel, in violation of the federal constitution. The district court referred the matter to a magistrate judge, who issued a Report and Recommendation (\u201cR &amp; R\u201d), recommending that the court dismiss the case for failure to state a claim under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(e)(2)(B)(ii). The court adopted the R &amp; R as part of its decision, and dismissed the case. Searcy now appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b978-18\">We find no merit in Searcy\u2019s complaint for the reasons stated in the R <em>&amp; </em>R, and therefore affirm the court\u2019s judgment.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b978-19\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b978-16\">. Searcy challenges the court\u2019s decision denying him leave to amend his complaint to add his wife as a party. The challenge is frivolous.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
