We have reviewed the record and find no reversible error with respect to the court\u2019s denial of Smith\u2019s motions for discovery requests, default judgment, to remit fine and restitution, and to treat his illness. Accordingly, while we grant leave to proceed in forma pauperis on appeal, we affirm for the reasons stated by the district court. <em>United States v. Smith, </em>No. 1:05-cv-00175 (S.D.W. Va. July 25, 2007; Aug. 1, 2007).</p>\n<p id=\"b558-22\">To the extent the district court dismissed the majority of motions filed by Smith as second or successive \u00a7 2255 motions, an appeal may not be taken from the final order in a \u00a7 2255 proceeding unless a circuit justice or judge issues a certificate of appealability. 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2253(c)(1) (2000). A certificate of appealability will not issue absent \u201ca substantial showing of the denial of a constitutional right.\u201d 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2253(c)(2) (2000). A prisoner satisfies this standard by demonstrating that reasonable jurists would find that any assessment of the constitutional claims by the district court is debatable or wrong and that any dispositive procedural ruling by the district court is likewise debatable. <em>Miller-El v. Cockrell, </em>537 U.S. 322, 336-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"531\">*531</page-number>38, 123 S.Ct. 1029, 154 L.Ed.2d 931 (2003); <em>Slack v. McDaniel, </em>529 U.S. 473, 484, 120 S.Ct. 1595, 146 L.Ed.2d 542 (2000); <em>Rose v. Lee, </em>252 F.3d 676, 683-84 (4th Cir.2001). We have independently reviewed the record and conclude that Smith has not made the requisite showing. We therefore deny a certificate of appealability and dismiss as to those portions of the court\u2019s orders.<footnotemark>*</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b559-5\">We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b559-6\">\n<em>AFFIRMED IN PART; DISMISSED IN PART.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b559-18\"> To the extent that in his informal brief Smith seeks relief from this court under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2106 (2000) and Fed.
