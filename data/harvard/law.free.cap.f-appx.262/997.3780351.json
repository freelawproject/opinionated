Wooten argues that the district court erred when it enhanced Wooten\u2019s sentence based on facts that were not alleged in the indictment or found by a jury and the district court imposed an unreasonable sentence. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b1026-8\">Wooten first argues that the district court violated Wooten\u2019s rights under the Fifth and Sixth Amendments to the Constitution when it enhanced Wooten\u2019s sentence based on facts not alleged in the indictment or found by a jury. Wooten\u2019s argument, which was also raised in an earlier appeal of his sentence, is barred by the law-of-the-case doctrine. Under that doctrine \u201can issue decided at one stage of a case is binding at later stages of the same case.\u201d <em>Schiavo ex. rel. Schindler v. Schiavo, </em>403 F.3d 1289, 1291 (11th Cir.2005) (quoting <em>Toole v. Baxter Healthcare Corp., </em>235 F.3d 1307, 1313 (11th Cir.2000)) (internal quotation marks omitted). We concluded in an earlier appeal that, \u201cbecause Wooten admitted the facts used to enhance his sentence by not objecting to the PSI, no constitutional <em>Booker </em>error occurred.\u201d <em>United States v. Wooten, </em>202 Fed.Appx. 429, 434 (11th Cir.2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b1026-10\">Wooten next argues that the district court imposed an unreasonable sentence. Wooten argues that the district court failed to consider the statutory sentencing factors, <em>see </em>18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a), or acknowledge its discretion to vary from the sentencing guidelines. These arguments also fail.</p>\n<p id=\"b1026-11\">We review a sentence for reasonableness, <em>United States v. Talley, </em>431 F.3d 784, 785 (11th Cir.2005), which is \u201ca deferential abuse-of-discretion standard,\u201d <em>Gall v. United States, </em>\u2014 U.S. \u2014\u2014, 128 S.Ct. 586, 591, 169 L.Ed.2d 445 (2007). We \u201cmust first ensure that the district court committed no significant procedural error, such as failing to calculate (or improperly calculating) the Guidelines range, treating the Guidelines as mandatory, failing to consider the \u00a7 3553(a) factors, selecting a sentence based on clearly erroneous facts, or failing to adequately explain the chosen sentence.\u201d Gall, 128 S.Ct. at 597. We then \u201cconsider the substantive reasonableness of the sentence imposed under an abuse-of-discretion standard.\u201d <em>Id. </em>\u201c[WJhen the district court imposes a sentence within the advisory Guidelines range, we ordinarily will expect that choice to be a reasonable one.\u201d <em>Talley, </em>431 F.3d at 788.</p>\n<p id=\"b1026-12\">The district court did not abuse its discretion when it imposed on Wooten a sentence of 720 months of imprisonment. The transcript of the sentencing hearing establishes that the district court sentenced Wooten after careful consideration of Wooten\u2019s arguments in favor of mitigation, the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"999\">*999</page-number>advisory sentencing guidelines, and the sentencing factors of section 3553(a). The district court also referred to the sentencing guidelines as \u201cadvisory.\u201d Wooten\u2019s sentence at the low end of the advisory guidelines range was reasonable.</p>\n<p id=\"b1027-5\">Wooten\u2019s sentence is</p>\n<p id=\"b1027-6\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
