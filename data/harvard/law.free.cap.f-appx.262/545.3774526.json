We further find that we lack jurisdiction to review Kalu\u2019s claim that the Board should have exercised its sua sponte power to reopen his removal proceedings. <em>Ali v. Gonzales, </em>448 F.3d 515, 518 (2d Cir.2006) (collecting cases). Finally, we find no merit to Kalu\u2019s argument that the Board failed to provide a reasoned basis for its decision. We therefore deny the petition for review. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b574-6\">\n<em>PETITION DENIED.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
