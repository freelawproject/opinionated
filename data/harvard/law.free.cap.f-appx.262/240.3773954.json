Ferreiro argues that the district court (1) erred in applying an enhancement under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2B1.1(b)(1) based on the amount of loss caused Medicare, as he was not convicted of filling fraudulent prescriptions for Medicare patients, such that his offense did not cause the government a loss; and (2) imposed an unreasonable sen<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"241\">*241</page-number>tence. For the reasons discussed below, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b269-5\">I. \u00a7 2Bl.l(b)(l) Enhancement</p>\n<p id=\"b269-6\">We normally review the sentencing court\u2019s findings of fact for clear error and application of those facts to the Sentencing Guidelines <em>de novo. United States v. Liss, </em>265 F.3d 1220, 1227 (11th Cir.2001). However, when a defendant raises a sentencing objection for the first time on appeal, as here, we review for plain error. <em>United States v. Dorman, </em>488 F.3d 936, 942 (11th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S.-, 128 S.Ct. 427, 169 L.Ed.2d 299 (2007). Under this standard, the defendant first must show (1) an error, (2) that is plain, and (3) that affected his substantial rights. <em>United States v. Olano, </em>507 U.S. 725, 732, 113 S.Ct. 1770, 1776, 123 L.Ed.2d 508 (1993). If the defendant demonstrates a plain error that affected his substantial rights, we can correct the error, but only if we find that the error seriously affected the fairness, integrity, or public reputation of the judicial proceedings. <em>Id. </em>at 732, 113 S.Ct. at 1776.</p>\n<p id=\"b269-9\">A defendant convicted of violating \u00a7 1320a-7b may be sentenced according to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2B4.1. U.S.S.GApp. A. This section includes a specific offense characteristic enhancement for the \u201cvalue of the bribe\u201d in question. <em>See </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2B4.1(b)(l)(B). Specifically, when the value of the bribe in question exceeds $5,000, \u00a7 2B4.1 directs that the defendant\u2019s base offense level be increased according to a table in U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2B1.1. <em>Id. </em>This table otherwise pertains to the amount of loss involved in a conviction for, <em>inter </em>alia, fraud. <em>See generally </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2bl.1(b)(1). As it pertains to offenses sentenced under \u00a7 2B4.1, however, this table directs that, when a defendant pays a bribe that is more than $1 million but less than $2.5 million, his base offense level be increased by 16. U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2Bl.l(b)(l)(I).</p>\n<p id=\"b269-11\">Here, the district court sentenced Ferreiro under \u00a7 2B4.1. Following \u00a7 2B4.1(b)(l)\u2019s instructions to use the table in \u00a7 2B1.1(b)(1) to enhance the base offense level based on the amount of the bribe in question, it applied a specific offense characteristic enhancement for the $1.2 million in kickbacks that Ferreiro paid, an amount that Ferreiro does not contest. Ferreiro\u2019s argument that the enhancement should not have been applied because his offense conduct did not cause Medicare a loss is without merit, as Ferreiro\u2019s enhancement was not based on causing a loss to Medicare, but rather on paying a kickback, a fact that Ferreiro does not contest.</p>\n<p id=\"b269-12\">To the extent that Ferreiro relies on our suggestion, in <em>United States v. Medina, </em>485 F.3d 1291, 1304 (11th Cir.2007), that a defendant guilty of paying kickbacks should not receive a \u00a7 2B1.1(b)(1) enhancement, Ferreiro is misguided, as, in that case, we only considered the application of the \u00a7 2Bl.l(b)(l) table to a defendant sentenced under a fraud Guideline, and said nothing of the bribe-amount provision in \u00a7 2B4.1. Therefore, the district court did not plainly err, and we affirm as to this issue. <em>See Dorman, </em>488 F.3d at 942.</p>\n<p id=\"b269-13\">II. Reasonableness</p>\n<p id=\"b269-14\">After the Supreme Court\u2019s decision in <em>United States v. Booker, </em>543 U.S. 220, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005), the sentencing court must not only correctly calculate the guideline imprisonment range, but must treat that range as advisory and impose a reasonable sentence. <em>United States v. Talley, </em>431 F.3d 784, 786 (11th Cir.2005). Specifically, the district court must impose a sentence that is both procedurally and substantively reasonable. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"242\">*242</page-number><em>United States v. Hunt, </em>459 F.3d 1180, 1182 n. 3 (11th Cir.2006); <em>Gall v. United States, </em>- U.S. -, 128 S.Ct. 586, 597, 169 L.Ed.2d 445 (2007). The Supreme Court has explained that a sentence may be procedurally unreasonable if the district court improperly calculates the guideline imprisonment range, treats the Guidelines as mandatory, fails to consider the appropriate statutory factors, bases the sentence on clearly erroneous facts, or fails to adequately explain its reasoning. <em>Gall, </em>at 597. The Court also has explained that the substantive reasonableness of a sentence is reviewed under an abuse-of-discretion standard. <em>Id. </em>It has suggested that review for substantive reasonableness under this standard involves inquiring whether the statutory factors support the sentence in question. <em>Id. </em>at 586.</p>\n<p id=\"b270-6\">These statutory factors are found in \u00a7 3553(a). <em>Booker, </em>543 U.S. at 246, 125 S.Ct. at 757. Pursuant to \u00a7 3553(a), the sentencing court shall impose a sentence \u201csufficient, but not greater than necessary\u201d to comply with the purposes of sentencing listed in \u00a7 3553(a)(2), namely reflecting the seriousness of the offense, promoting respect for the law, providing just punishment for the offense, deterring criminal conduct, protecting the public from future criminal conduct by the defendant, and providing the defendant with needed educational or vocational training or medical care. <em>See </em>18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a)(2). The statute also instructs the sentencing court to consider certain factors, including the nature and circumstances of the offense, the history and characteristics of the defendant, the guideline imprisonment range, and the need to avoid unwarranted sentencing disparities. <em>See </em>18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a)(1), (4), and (6).</p>\n<p id=\"b270-7\">In considering the \u00a7 3553(a) factors and explaining the reasoning behind its choice of sentence, the district court need not discuss or state that it has explicitly considered each factor of \u00a7 3553(a). <em>Talley, </em>431 F.3d at 786. Instead, an explicit acknowledgment that the district court has considered the defendant\u2019s arguments and the \u00a7 3553(a) factors will suffice. <em>United States v. Scott, </em>426 F.3d 1324, 1329-30 (11th Cir.2005); <em>see also Rita v. United States, </em>551 U.S.-, 127 S.Ct. 2456, 2469, 168 L.Ed.2d 203 (2007) (holding that the defendant\u2019s sentence was reasonable when the district court considered the parties\u2019 arguments and provided a reasoned basis for its choice of sentence).</p>\n<p id=\"b270-11\">Here, the district court imposed a procedurally reasonable sentence. <em>See Hunt, </em>459 F.3d at 1182 n. 3; <em>Gall, </em>at 597. The district court correctly calculated the guideline imprisonment range, as discussed above. <em>See Gall, </em>at 597. The district court also considered the statutory factors. <em>See id. </em>Indeed, the district court explicitly acknowledged that it had considered the \u00a7 3553(a) factors. <em>See Scott, </em>426 F.3d at 1329-30. The district court likewise more than sufficiently explained its reasoning. <em>See Gall, </em>at 597. Although it was not required to, the district court expressly discussed at length certain of the \u00a7 3553(a) factors. <em>See Scott, </em>426 F.3d at 1329-30. Specifically, the district court acknowledged the nature and characteristics of the defendant, the seriousness of the offense, and the need for deterrence. <em>See </em>18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a)(1), (2).</p>\n<p id=\"b270-12\">The district court also imposed a substantively reasonable sentence. <em>See Hunt, </em>459 F.3d at 1182 n. 3; <em>Gall, </em>at 597. While the district court reasoned that Ferreiro had favorable characteristics, it ultimately was influenced by the seriousness of the offense and the need to impose a sentence sufficient to deter future Medicare-related crimes to exercise its discretion to impose <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"243\">*243</page-number>a sentence at the bottom of the guideline imprisonment range. Therefore, the \u00a7 8553(a) factors supported the district court\u2019s sentence, and the district court did not abuse its discretion. <em>See Gall, </em>at 597, 605. Because the district court considered the appropriate factors and appropriately exercised its discretion, it imposed a reasonable sentence, and we affirm as to this issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b271-6\">SENTENCE AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
