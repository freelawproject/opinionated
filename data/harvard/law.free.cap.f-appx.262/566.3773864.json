We deny her petition for review.</p>\n<p id=\"b594-20\">Yu entered the United States on a K-l nonimmigrant fianc\u00e9 visa. She did not marry the sponsor of that visa, and now seeks adjustment of status under 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1255(i) (2000) based on an approved labor certification. Relying on its interpretation of 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1255(d) (2000), and our decision in <em>Markovski v. Gonzales, </em>486 F.3d 108 (4th Cir.2007), the Board found Yu ineligible for adjustment of status on any basis other than marriage to the K-l sponsor within ninety days of entry. We conclude that the Board correctly applied the cited authority. Therefore, we deny Yu\u2019s petition for review. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b594-21\">\n<em>PETITION DENIED.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
