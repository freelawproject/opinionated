Food Lion challenges the sufficiency of the evidence, the district court\u2019s sparse factual findings when it awarded a victory to Stimson, and the sufficiency of the evidence supporting the damages award. Finding no error, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b565-5\">We directed a limited remand in order for the district court to make findings of fact and conclusions of law in accordance with Rule 52(a) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure. We find the court\u2019s factual findings and conclusions of law in its December 11, 2007 memorandum opinion are sufficient.</p>\n<p id=\"b565-6\">The district court\u2019s factual findings are reviewed for clear error and its conclusions of law de novo. <em>Carter v. Ball, </em>33 F.3d 450, 457 (4th Cir.1994). We find there was sufficient evidence supporting the court\u2019s findings. Based on the court\u2019s findings that the hazard was not open and obvious and Food Lion failed to warn Stimson of the hazard, we find no error in the court\u2019s decision not to address the issue of Stimson\u2019s negligence. We also find no error in the award of damages. The court heard testimony from Stimson\u2019s treating physician regarding the reasonableness and necessity of the medical bills. We also find Stimson\u2019s testimony provided sufficient support for the award of lost wages.</p>\n<p id=\"b565-7\">Accordingly, we affirm the district court\u2019s judgment. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b565-8\">\n<em>AFFIRMED.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
