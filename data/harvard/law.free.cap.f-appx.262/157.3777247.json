No reversible error has been shown; we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b186-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"158\">*158</page-number>Vernon first challenges the district court\u2019s denial of his motion to suppress a notepad seized from his prison cell while he was in pretrial detention. A district court\u2019s denial of a motion to suppress is ordinarily reviewed under a mixed standard. <em>United States v. Garcia-Jaimes, </em>484 F.3d 1311, 1320 (11th Cir.2007), <em>petition for cert. filed, </em>(U.S. June 11, 2007) (06-11863). Therefore, we review the district court\u2019s findings of fact for clear error and its application of law to those facts <em>de novo. Id. </em>But because Vernon did not object to the magistrate judge\u2019s report and recommendation on his motion to suppress, our review of the magistrate\u2019s factual findings is only for plain error. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b186-4\">Here, during a routine inspection of Vernon\u2019s cell, a corrections officer noticed that Vernon had more than the permitted number of notepads. The corrections officer confiscated the excessive notepads. Some of the notepads were blank; but at least one of the seized notepads contained Vernon\u2019s writings.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Vernon asserts that he had a legitimate expectation of privacy in the personal property in his cell during his pretrial detention and that, in considering his motion to suppress, the district court should have balanced his right to privacy against the institutional need for safety and sanitation in seizing the excess notepads.</p>\n<p id=\"b186-8\">The district court did not err in denying Vernon\u2019s motion to suppress the contents of the notepad seized from his cell.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> In <em>Hudson v. Palmer, </em>468 U.S. 517, 104 S.Ct. 3194, 82 L.Ed.2d 393 (1984), the United States Supreme Court explained the scope of a prisoner\u2019s legitimate expectation of privacy in this way:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b186-9\">[W]e hold that society is not prepared to recognize as legitimate any subjective expectation of privacy that a prisoner might have in his prison cell and that, accordingly, the Fourth Amendment proscription against unreasonable searches does not apply within the confines of the prison cell. The recognition of privacy rights for prisoners in their individual cells simply cannot be reconciled with the concept of incarceration and the needs and objectives of penal institutions.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b186-10\"><em>Id. </em>at 3200; <em>see also Padgett v. Donald, </em>401 F.3d 1273, 1278 (11th Cir.2005) (\u201cPrisoners have no Fourth Amendment rights against searches of their prison cells.... \u201d). Vernon had no legitimate expectation of privacy to the contents of the notepads in his cell; and we affirm the denial of Vernon\u2019s motion to suppress evidence seized from his cell.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b186-11\">We next address Vernon\u2019s assertion that the district court deprived him of his Sixth Amendment right to confront a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"159\">*159</page-number>witness at trial. Vernon contends that the district court erred in not permitting Bobbi Steger to testify as a witness.</p>\n<p id=\"b187-5\">At trial outside of the presence of the jury, the district court asked the parties whether they believed that Steger would invoke her Fifth Amendment privilege against self-incrimination if she were called as a witness at Vernon\u2019s trial. Both the government and Vernon agreed that Steger would invoke her Fifth Amendment privilege; but Vernon asserted that invoking the Fifth Amendment at trial would have \u201csome evidentiary value.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b187-6\">Although we review <em>de novo </em>a defendant\u2019s claim that the district court violated his Sixth Amendment confrontation rights, we will reverse the district court only for harmful error. <em>See United States v. Mills, </em>138 F.3d 928, 937, 941 (11th Cir.1998). We see no error in the district court\u2019s refusal to allow Vernon to call a witness who would invoke her Fifth Amendment privilege against self-incrimination at Vernon\u2019s trial. <em>See United States v. Beechum, </em>582 F.2d 898, 908 (5th Cir.1978) <em>(en banc); see also United States v. Bolts, </em>558 F.2d 316, 324 (5th Cir.1977) (explaining that defendant \u201chas no constitutional right to compel [witness] to take the stand and testify when it was known in advance that [witness] intended to assert the fifth amendment privilege\u201d and rejecting defendant\u2019s argument \u201cthat he should have been able to elicit from [witness] on the stand and in the jury\u2019s presence her exercise of privilege\u201d).<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b187-7\">We affirm Vernon\u2019s convictions.</p>\n<p id=\"b187-8\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b186-5\">. A message about taking a life was written on the first page of one of the seized notepads.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b186-6\">. To the extent that Vernon argues that prison officials did not comply with institutional procedures in searching his cell and seizing his notepads, we reject this argument. Vernon cites no authority supporting the claim that prison regulations create a constitutional entitlement under the Fourth Amendment; and Vernon has not specified how prison regulations were violated in this case.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b186-7\">. Vernon relies on <em>Bell v. Wolfish, </em>441 U.S. 520, 99 S.Ct. 1861, 60 L.Ed.2d 447 (1979)\u2014 a <em>pre-Hudson </em>decision\u2014to support his argument that pretrial detainees are protected by the Fourth Amendment against unreasonable searches of their cells and the seizure of personal items. In <em>Bell, </em>the Supreme Court assumed\u2014without deciding\u2014that a pretrial detainee had a diminished expectation of privacy and then concluded that unannounced searches of inmate living areas were still constitutionally permitted. 99 S.Ct. at 1883. Even if we were to assume that Vernon had a diminished expectation of privacy in his cell, the routine search of his cell and the seizure of his excessive notepads were not unreasonable.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b187-10\">. In <em>Bonner v. City of Prichard, </em>661 F.2d 1206, 1209 (11th Cir.1981) <em>(en banc), </em>we adopted as binding precedent all decisions of the former Fifth Circuit handed down before 1 October 1981.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
