Galves contends that the district court erred by imposing a 16-level enhancement under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2L1.2(b)(l)(A)(ii) because his prior Texas conviction for aggravated assault is not a crime of violence under the Sentencing Guidelines. He contends that the Texas crime of aggravated assault has a broader definition than most other definitions of aggravated assault because it may be committed by threatening the victim with a weapon.</p>\n<p id=\"b615-22\">This court has previously held that aggravated assault under Texas Penal Code \u00a7 22.02 (Vernon 2002), which is identical to the 1997 version of the statute at issue in the instant case, is substantially similar to the generic, common sense definition of \u201caggravated assault\u201d under the Guidelines. <em>See United States v. Guillen-Alvarez, </em>489 F.3d 197, 199-201 (5th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>- U.S. -, 128 S.Ct. 418, 169 L.Ed.2d 293 (2007). <em>See also United States v. Rojas-Gutierrez, </em>510 F.3d 545 (5th Cir.2007).</p>\n<p id=\"b615-24\">Accordingly, the judgment of the district court is</p>\n<p id=\"b615-25\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b615-19\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
