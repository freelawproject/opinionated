Petitioner appealed the decision to the Board of Immigration Appeals (\u201cBIA\u201d), and it affirmed. Petitioner now seeks our review of the BIA\u2019s decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b203-24\">Petitioner contends that the IJ abused her discretion when she denied his motion for a continuance because he was statutorily eligible for an adjustment of immigration status, to-wit: (1) he had an approved labor certification, (2) a visa number was immediately available to him; and (3) his 1-140 visa petition was pending because although the Department of Homeland Security (\u201cDHS\u201d) had denied it, he was appealing that denial. Petitioner also contends that the IJ, in denying his motion for a continuance, deprived him of due process of law by not addressing all of his available forms of relief.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b204-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"176\">*176</page-number>I.</p>\n<p id=\"b204-4\">\u201cWe lack jurisdiction to consider a claim raised in a petition for review unless the petitioner has exhausted his administrative remedies with respect thereto.\u201d <em>Amaya-Artunduaga v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>463 F.3d 1247, 1250 (11th Cir.2006); <em>see </em>8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(d)(1) (stating the exhaustion requirement applicable to immigration cases). Although exhaustion may not apply to all due process claims, it applies to claims for which the BIA can provide a remedy. <em>Amaya-Artunduaga, </em>463 F.3d at 1251. Thus, a petitioner must exhaust his \u201cprocedural due process claims, as well as procedural errors argued in due process terms.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b204-5\">Petitioner failed to exhaust his administrative remedies in this case. Although the BIA could have provided him with a remedy for his due process claim, he did not present the claim to the BIA in either his notice of appeal or his brief. In short, we lack jurisdiction to consider petitioner\u2019s due process claim and thus dismiss this part of his petition.</p>\n<p id=\"b204-6\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b204-7\">An IJ \u201cmay grant a motion for continuance for good cause shown.\u201d 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1003.29. \u201cThe grant of a continuance is within the IJ[\u2019s] broad discretion.\u201d <em>Zafar v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>461 F.3d 1357, 1362 (11th Cir.2006). We therefore review an IJ\u2019s decision denying a continuance for abuse of discretion. <em>Haswanee v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>471 F.3d 1212, 1214 (11th Cir. 2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b204-8\">In general, an alien present in the United States may apply to adjust his status to that of an alien lawfully admitted for permanent residence. Immigration and Nationality Act (\u201cINA\u201d) \u00a7 245, 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1255. However, an alien who became illegal by overstaying his visa or by accepting unauthorized employment is generally barred from applying for an adjustment of status. INA \u00a7 245(c), 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1255(c). Despite that bar, an illegal alien who (1) is the beneficiary of an application for a labor certification, under 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1182(a)(5)(A), filed pursuant to Department of Labor (\u201cDOL\u201d) regulations, and (2) is physically present in the United States on December 21, 2000, may apply to the Attorney General for the adjustment of his status to that of an alien lawfully admitted for permanent residence. INA \u00a7 2460(1), 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 12550(1).</p>\n<p id=\"b204-11\">That having been said, \u201c[t]he mere filing of a labor certificate application with the DOL does not make an alien eligible for adjustment of status under \u00a7 1255(i).\u201d <em>Zafar, </em>461 F.3d at 1363 (emphasis in original). Two additional statutory eligibility requirements must be met. <em>Id. </em>Specifically, the Attorney General may adjust an alien\u2019s status if: \u201c(A) the alien is eligible to receive an immigrant visa and is admissible to the United States for permanent residence; and (B) an immigrant visa is immediately available to the alien at the time the application is filed.\u201d INA \u00a7 2450(2), 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 12550(2).</p>\n<p id=\"b204-12\">Any employer may file an 1-140 employment-based visa petition on behalf of an alien. 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 204.5(0(1). The 1-140 petition \u201cmust be accompanied by an individual labor certification from the Department of Labor.\u201d <em>Id. \u00a7 </em>204.5(0(3)\u00ae. If the petition is approved, it will be retained by the immigration service for consideration with an application for permanent residence, and a visa number will be assigned if available. 8 C.F.R. \u00a7\u00a7 204.5(n)(l), 245.1(g). The employer may appeal the denial of an 1-140 petition. 8 C.F.R. \u00a7\u00a7 204.5(n)(2).</p>\n<p id=\"b205-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"177\">*177</page-number>In <em>Merchant v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>461 F.3d 1375, 1379 (11th Cir.2006), we held that an IJ committed an abuse of discretion in denying a continuance where the alien was eligible to receive an employment-based visa and eligible for an adjustment of status, pursuant to \u00a7 1255(i)(2). Specifically, in <em>Merchant, </em>the petitioner satisfied all the statutory prerequisites of \u00a7 1255(i) by showing the timely filing of an application for labor certification, the approval thereof, the filing of an 1-140 petition, and the filing of an 1-485 petition (application for adjustment of status). <em>Id. </em>at 1378-79. Although the petitioner\u2019s 1-140 petition had not yet been approved or denied, the petitioner was still eligible under \u00a7 1255(i). <em>Id. </em>at 1378. We distinguished <em>Merchant </em>from <em>Zafar, </em>where we earlier held that petitioners were <em>not </em>eligible for adjustments of status when they had only filed applications for labor certification with the DOL, which were still pending, and had not filed 1-140 or 1-485 petitions. <em>Id.; see Zafar, </em>461 F.3d at 1363.</p>\n<p id=\"b205-5\">In <em>Haswanee, </em>the petitioner had an approved labor certification and a pending I-140 petition, which had not been approved or denied, but had not filed an 1-485 petition for adjustment of status. <em>Haswanee, </em>471 F.3d at 1217. Relying on the holdings of <em>Zafar </em>and <em>Merchant </em>and the language of \u00a7 1255(i), we determined that an alien was eligible for an adjustment of status, although he had not yet filed an 1^185 petition for adjustment of status. <em>Id. </em>Thus, we held that \u201cthe IJ abused [his] discretion in denying Haswanee\u2019s motion for continuance where he had an approved labor certification and an immediately available visa number, and had a pending visa petition.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1218.</p>\n<p id=\"b205-6\">We find no abuse of discretion in the denial of petitioner\u2019s motion for a continuance because the record does not show that petitioner was eligible for an adjustment of immigration status. He failed to show eligibility because the DHS denied his 1-140 visa petition initially, and he failed to offer any reasons why that initial denial would be overturned.</p>\n<p id=\"b205-8\">In conclusion, the petition for review is DISMISSED, in part; DENIED, in part.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b203-16\">. Although the Government argues that an intervening rejection of petitioner\u2019s 1-140 agency appeal renders this appeal moot, we <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"176\">*176</page-number>conclude otherwise and therefore address petilioner's claims.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
