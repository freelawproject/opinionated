This court reviews a district court\u2019s grant of summary judgment de novo. <em>Higgins v. E.I. DuPont de Nemours &amp; Co., </em>863 F.2d 1162, 1167 (4th Cir.1988). Summary judgment may only be granted when \u201cthere is no genuine issue as to any material fact and ... the moving party is entitled to a judgment as a matter of law.\u201d Fed.R.Civ.P. 56(c). With this standard in mind, we have reviewed the materials before us on appeal and find no reversible error. Accordingly, we affirm for the reasons stated by the district court. <em>See Evans v. Williamsburg Tech. Coll., </em>No. 4:03-cv-03939-TLW, 2007 WL 1068183 (D.S.C. Mar. 29, 2007). We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b523-19\">\n<em>AFFIRMED.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
