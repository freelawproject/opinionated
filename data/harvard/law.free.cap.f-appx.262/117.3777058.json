No reversible error has been shown; we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b145-22\">Pursuant to a plea agreement, Appellant agreed to plead guilty to one count of a 24-count superseding indictment charging Appellant with aiding and abetting the transportation of counterfeited securities, in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 2314 and 2; the government agreed to dismiss the remaining counts. The offense earned a statutory maximum 10-year term of imprisonment. Appellant\u2019s guidelines sentencing range\u2014after the district court granted the government\u2019s request for a substantial assistance downward departure\u2014was 0 to 6 months\u2019 imprisonment; a sentence of 36 months\u2019 probation was imposed, and Appellant was ordered to pay restitution.</p>\n<p id=\"b145-23\">About three months into Appellant\u2019s probation sentence, the United States Probation Office filed a petition for revocation of Appellant\u2019s probation. Based on the probation violations charged\u2014to which Appellant stipulated\u2014the sentencing range recommended under Chapter 7 of the United States Sentencing Guidelines was 8 to 14 months\u2019 imprisonment. The government requested\u2014and the district court imposed^\u2014a 60-month sentence. Appellant <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"118\">*118</page-number>argues that the district court fashioned an excessive and unreasonable sentence in the light of the sentence recommended in the guidelines policy statement.</p>\n<p id=\"b146-4\">We review a district court\u2019s decision to exceed the recommended sentencing range set out in the Chapter 7 guidelines for abuse of discretion.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> <em>See United States v. Silva, </em>443 F.3d 795, 798 (11th Cir.2006). Under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3565, if a probationer violates a condition of probation, the district court may, after considering the factors set out in 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a), revoke the sentence of probation and resentence the defendant under subchapter A.</p>\n<p id=\"b146-5\">Chapter 7 of the guidelines contains policy statements\u2014one of which provides recommended ranges of imprisonment upon revocation of probation, U.S.S.G. \u00a7 7B1.4\u2014that the district court must consider in determining an appropriate sentence. These policy statements are advisory and not binding on the district court. <em>Silva, </em>443 F.3d at 799 (11th Cir.2006). And after probation revocation, the district court also is not restricted by the guidelines range that applied at the time of the initial sentencing hearing. <em>See United States v. Cook, </em>291 F.3d 1297, 1300 (11th Cir.2002). Any sentence may be imposed so long as it does not exceed the statutory maximum. <em>See United States v. Williams, </em>425 F.3d 987, 990 n. 2 (11th Cir.2005) (\u201cThese revocation guidelines [U.S.S.G. \u00a7 7B1.4] are advisory, and the court can use its discretion in sentencing as long as it does not exceed the statutory maximum .... \u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b146-9\">That the district court considered the Chapter 7 policy statements and the section 3553(a) factors in imposing a sentence of 60 months\u2019 imprisonment is clear from the probation revocation hearing. The district court explained that Appellant failed to realize the significance of his criminal conduct and would continue to work the system unless a serious term of imprisonment was imposed. The district court mentioned explicitly the advisory guideline range of 8 to 14 months and found that range to be insufficient and inappropriate under the circumstances of Appellant\u2019s case and his probation violations. The sentence imposed fell within the statutory maximum. On this record, no abuse of discretion has been shown.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b146-10\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b146-6\">. The government argues that plain error review applies because Appellant made no objection to his sentence in the district court. We think Appellant\u2019s arguments for an in-range sentence in the district court preserved this issue for appeal under the abuse of discretion standard.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b146-7\">. We are unpersuaded by Appellant's argument that the district court erred in failing to consider the lesser sentence that would apply had Appellant violated supervised release. Appellant predicates this argument on his observation that had the alternative sentence of imprisonment been imposed initially instead of probation, his most recent violations would be supervised-release violations which, in turn, would be subject to a maximum possible term of three years imprisonment under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3583. Appellant cites no case law\u2014 and we are aware of none\u2014that requires the district court to consider violations of alternative sentences that were never imposed.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
