He argues that the district court erred by imposing a 16-level increase under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2L1.2(b)(l)(A)(ii) based on his prior Texas state conviction for burglary of a habitation. Saenz contends that the definition of \u201chabitation\u201d under Texas law is broader than the generic, contemporary meaning of \u201cdwelling\u201d as used in the enumerated offense of \u201cburglary of a dwelling\u201d in the Sentencing Guidelines. Although he acknowledges this court\u2019s precedent to the contrary, he asserts that this precedent has been overruled by the Supreme Court\u2019s decision in <em>James v. United States, </em>-U.S.-, 127 S.Ct. 1586, 1599-1600, 167 L.Ed.2d 532 (2007). This argument is without merit as <em>James </em>did not involve an enumerated offense. <em>See United States v. Gomez-Guerra, </em>485 F.3d 301, 303 <em>&amp; </em>n. 1 (5th Cir.2007). The district court did not err in determining that Saenz\u2019s prior conviction was a crime of violence. <em>See United States v. Valdez-Maltos, </em>443 F.3d 910, 911 (5th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S.-, 127 S.Ct. 265, 166 L.Ed.2d 205 (2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b618-25\">In light of <em>Apprendi v. New Jersey, </em>530 U.S. 466, 120 S.Ct. 2348, 147 L.Ed.2d 435 (2000), Saenz challenges the constitutionality of 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1326(b)\u2019s treatment of prior felony and aggravated felony convictions as sentencing factors rather than elements of the offense that must be found by <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"591\">*591</page-number>a jury. This court has held that this issue is \u201cfully foreclosed from further debate.\u201d <em>United States v. Pineda-Arrellano, </em>492 F.3d 624, 625 (5th Cir.2007), <em>petition for cert. filed </em>(Aug. 28, 2007) (No. 07-6202).</p>\n<p id=\"b619-5\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b618-17\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir.
