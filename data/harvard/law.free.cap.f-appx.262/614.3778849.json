Berry filed the instant \u201cMotion for Relief pursuant to Fed.R.CivP. 60(b)(4) <em>&amp; </em>(6),\u201d challenging the district court\u2019s order denying his initial motion under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255. Berry has applied to this court for a certificate of appealability (COA) from the district court\u2019s order denying the Rule 60(b) motion. <em>See </em>28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2253(c)(1)(B).</p>\n<p id=\"b643-5\">Berry complained below that his attorney rendered ineffective assistance in advising him about the extent of his exposure at sentencing; that the district court erred at sentencing in adjusting his offense level because of his leadership role and because he obstructed justice; and that the application to him of amended versions of the Guidelines Manual violated the Ex Post Facto Clause. Berry contended that the district court\u2019s order denying the \u00a7 2255 motion was \u201cvoid\u201d because the district court failed to dispose of these issues in that order.</p>\n<p id=\"b643-6\">Because the substantive issues raised in the Rule 60(b) motion challenge the judgment of conviction and sentence, we regard the motion as a \u00a7 2255 motion. <em>See Gonzalez v. Crosby, </em>545 U.S. 524, 530-32 &amp; n. 4, 125 S.Ct. 2641, 162 L.Ed.2d 480 (2005). Berry has not obtained leave of this court to file a successive \u00a7 2255 motion. <em>See </em>28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2244(b)(3)(A); \u00a7 2255. Because \u00a7 2244(b)(3)(A) \u201cacts as a jurisdictional bar to the district court\u2019s asserting jurisdiction over any successive habeas petition until this court has granted the petitioner permission to file one,\u201d the district court was without jurisdiction to consider the action. <em>See United States v. Key, </em>205 F.3d 773, 774 (5th Cir.2000). Accordingly, the appeal does not deserve encouragement to proceed further. <em>See Miller-El v. </em>Cockrell, 537 U.S. 322, 327, 123 S.Ct. 1029, 154 L.Ed.2d 931 (2003). The request for a COA is DENIED.</p>\n<p id=\"b643-7\">Berry has failed to heed our warning in <em>United States v. Berry, </em>51 Fed.Appx. 483(5th Cir.2002) (unpublished), that frivolous filings will result in the imposition of a sanction. Berry shall pay a monetary SANCTION to the clerk of this court in the amount of $100. The clerk of this court and the clerks of all federal district courts within this circuit are directed to refuse to file any pro se pleading from Berry challenging his conviction or sentence unless Berry submits proof of satisfaction of this sanction. If Berry attempts to file in this court any such pleadings, the clerk will docket them for administrative purposes only. Any submissions which do not show proof that the sanction has been paid will neither be addressed nor acknowledged.</p>\n<p id=\"b643-9\">COA DENIED; SANCTION IMPOSED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b642-6\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
