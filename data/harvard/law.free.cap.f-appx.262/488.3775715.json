He argues reopening was warranted to continue his removal until the United States Citizenship and Immigration Services (\u201cUSCIS\u201d) determined his adjustment-of-status application. Because we conclude that the Board did not abuse its discretion in denying Budrys\u2019 motion to reopen, we deny his petition for review.</p>\n<p id=\"b516-24\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b516-25\">Budrys arrived in the United States on or about January 14, 2004. The Immigration and Naturalization Service immediately placed him in removal proceedings because he did not possess a valid entry document. After being paroled into the United States, Budrys sought asylum based on his claim of past persecution and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"489\">*489</page-number>fear of future persecution. On April 11, 2005, Immigration Judge (\u201cIJ\u201d) Garry Malphrus found Budrys removable and denied him asylum. The Board affirmed the IJ\u2019s order in its May 10, 2006 decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b517-5\">On May 26, 2006, Budrys married Maxine Hutson, a United States citizen. The couple sought to adjust Budrys\u2019 status through the USCIS on July 25, 2006, with Budrys filing an 1-485 application and Hutson filing an 1-130 immigrant visa petition on his behalf. On August 7, 2006, Budrys filed a motion with the Board to reopen his removal proceeding and either (a) remand to the IJ to adjudicate his adjustment-of-status application, or (b) hold his removal in abeyance until the USCIS adjudicated his adjustment-of-status application. In response to Budrys\u2019 first argument, the Board declined to remand his case to the IJ because it stated that the IJ did not have jurisdiction to adjudicate an application for adjustment of status by an arriving alien placed in removal proceedings, except under circumstances not present under these facts. See 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1245.2(a)(l)(ii). Regarding his second argument, the Board concluded that reopening was not warranted. Bu-drys now petitions for review of the Board\u2019s order.</p>\n<p id=\"b517-6\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b517-7\">We review the Board\u2019s denial of a motion to reopen for abuse of discretion. <em>Barry v. Gonzales, </em>445 F.3d 741, 744 (4th Cir.2006). We recognize that \u201ca denial under the reopening regulations must be reviewed with extreme deference.\u201d M.A <em>v. U.S. I.N.S., </em>899 F.2d 304, 308 (4th Cir. 1990) (en banc).</p>\n<p id=\"b517-8\">Budrys asserts that the Board <em>abused </em>its discretion because it failed to <em>use </em>its discretion. The relevant portion of the Board\u2019s order stated the following:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b517-13\">Since the respondent is an arriving alien and does not come within the narrow exception which would permit an [IJ] to consider an arriving alien\u2019s application for adjustment of status, reopening is not warranted in this case. The respondent must pursue any application for adjustment of status with the [USCIS] independent of these removal proceedings.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b517-14\"><em>In re Genadijus Budrys, </em>File: A97-391214-Arlington, (BIA Oct. 10, 2006) (citations omitted). Budrys identifies no error of law in the Board\u2019s order. Regarding Budrys\u2019 request to reopen his case and hold his removal in abeyance, the Board determined that reopening was \u201cnot warranted.\u201d This statement indicates that the Board believed it had the authority to reopen Budrys\u2019 case, but in its discretion, declined to use that authority. We believe that the Board acted within its discretion in so doing.<footnotemark>*</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b517-15\">In sum, we find that the Board did not abuse its discretion in denying Budrys\u2019 motion to reopen. Accordingly, we deny the petition for review.</p>\n<p id=\"b517-16\">\n<em>PETITION FOR REVIEW DENIED.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b517-9\"> Budrys also argues that the Board abused its discretion by failing to include an analysis of the factors listed in <em>Matter of Velarde-Pacheco, </em>23 I &amp; N Dec. 253, 256 (BIA 2002). <em>VelardePacheco </em>does not require an explicit listing of such factors in the Board's decision.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
