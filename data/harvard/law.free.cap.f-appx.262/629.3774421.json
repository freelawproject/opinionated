Mayorga argues that the IJ abused his discretion and deprived him of due process in denying his request for a continuance.</p>\n<p id=\"b658-4\">When, as in this case, the BIA affirms the IJ\u2019s decision, relying on reasons set forth in the IJ\u2019s decision, this court reviews both the BIA\u2019s decision and that of the IJ. <em>See Ahmed v. Gonzales, </em>447 F.3d 433, 437 (5th Cir.2006). An IJ has discretion to grant an alien\u2019s motion for a continuance upon a showing of good cause. 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1003.29; <em>Ali v. Gonzales, </em>440 F.3d 678, 680 (2006). Because Mayorga failed to show good cause for the granting of a continuance, we find no abuse of discretion. <em>See Ahmed, </em>447 F.3d at 440; <em>Ali, </em>440 F.3d at 680.</p>\n<p id=\"b658-5\">There is no liberty or property interest in discretionary relief from removal. <em>See Assaad v. Ashcroft, </em>378 F.3d 471, 475 (5th Cir.2004). The IJ\u2019s denial of a continuance so that Mayorga could pursue an adjustment of status did not violate due process. <em>See Ahmed, </em>447 F.3d at 440.</p>\n<p id=\"b658-6\">To the extent that Mayorga argues that the BIA should have remanded under 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1003.1(e)(5) or referred the case to a three-member panel pursuant to \u00a7 1003.1(e)(6), he has not shown that his appeal satisfied the criteria for either a referral to a three-member panel or for a remand. <em>See </em>\u00a7 1003.1(e)(5), (e)(6).</p>\n<p id=\"b658-7\">PETITION FOR REVIEW DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b657-38\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
