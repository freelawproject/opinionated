Specifically, Angulo maintained FPC Pensacola\u2019s lack of legal aid or research materials for non-English speaking inmates prevented him from discovering his trial counsel was ineffective when trial counsel did not raise as a defense the fact that Angulo legally possessed controlled substances in the normal course of his import-export business.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Angulo alleged he was forced to rely on \u201cjailhouse lawyers\u201d to file a 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255 motion, and he did not assert his ineffective assistance claim. He only discovered his ineffective assistance claim after another inmate, who was not at FPC Pensacola when he filed his \u00a7 2255 motion, informed him about the claim. The district court dismissed the complaint <em>sua sponte, </em>pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(e)(2)(B)(ii), for failure to state a claim because it did not identify an actual injury, as required by <em>Lewis v. Casey, </em>518 U.S. 343, 116 S.Ct. 2174, 135 L.Ed.2d 606 (1996).</p>\n<p id=\"b230-4\">We review <em>de novo </em>a \u00a7 1915(e)(2)(B)(ii) <em>sua sponte </em>dismissal for failure to state a claim, viewing the complaint\u2019s allegations as true, <em>Hughes v. Lott, </em>350 F.3d 1157, 1159-60 (11th Cir.2003). An inmate asserting an access claim \u201cmust identify within his complaint, a \u2018nonfrivolous,\u2019 \u2018arguable\u2019 underlying claim,\u201d as \u201can access claim is to provide vindication for a separate and distinct right to seek judicial relief.\u201d <em>Barbour v. Haley, </em>471 F.3d 1222, 1226 (11th Cir.2006), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 127 S.Ct. 2996, 168 L.Ed.2d 707 (2007). A plaintiff can establish actual injury by demonstrating his \u201cefforts to pursue a nonfrivolous claim were frustrated or impeded by a deficiency in the prison library or in the legal assistance program.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1225.</p>\n<p id=\"b230-9\">We need not decide whether FPC Pensacola\u2019s lack of legal aid or research materials for non-English speaking inmates prevented Angulo from discovering his ineffective assistance of counsel claim because his claim is frivolous. Angulo claimed his trial counsel was ineffective because he did not present the defense that Angulo was allowed to legally import a controlled substance since it was done in the normal course of his import-export business. <em>See </em>21 U.S.C. \u00a7 957(b)(1)(B). However, 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 957(b)(1)(b) lists an exemption to those who are required to register to import a controlled substance under 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 957(a). The exemption does not apply to Angulo\u2019s statutes of conviction, 21 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 952(a) and 963. Thus, Angulo\u2019s claim is frivolous and we affirm the district court\u2019s dismissal.</p>\n<p id=\"b230-10\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b230-7\">.
