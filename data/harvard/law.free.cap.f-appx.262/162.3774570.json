We granted a certificate of appealability (COA) on two issues: (1) whether Hiteshaw was required to obtain a COA under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2253 to appeal the dismissal of his habeas petition; and (2) whether the district court erred by characterizing Hiteshaw\u2019s petition as a \u00a7 2254 petition rather than a \u00a7 2241 petition. We review each issue in turn.</p>\n<p id=\"b191-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"163\">*163</page-number>I. <em>Whether Hiteshaw was Required to Obtain a COA</em></p>\n<p id=\"b191-5\">\u201cUnless a circuit justice or judge issues a certificate of appealability, an appeal may not be taken to the court of appeals from the final order in a habeas corpus proceeding in which the detention complained of arises out of process issued by a State court.\u201d 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2258(c)(1)(A). We held a state prisoner who filed a federal habeas petition challenging prison disciplinary actions was required to get a COA to appeal where his claims arose out of a prison disciplinary proceeding. <em>Medberry v. Crosby, </em>351 F.3d 1049, 1063 (11th Cir.2003). In reaching this result, we rejected a narrow reading of the operative statutory phrase, \u201carises out of process issued by a State court,\u201d and stated that a \u201cmore natural reading is that a COA is required when the prisoner\u2019s detention originated in state court process, even if a later decision by an administrative board is the more immediate cause of the prisoner\u2019s continuing detention.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(quotation and alteration omitted). In <em>Medberry, </em>the petitioner was originally detained pursuant to a state court judgment and conviction, and therefore, his detention arose out of process issued by a state court. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b191-6\">Hiteshaw\u2019s detention arises out of a state court pre-trial detention order issued after the court found probable cause to believe that Hiteshaw was a sexually violent predator under the Jimmy Ryce Act. <em>See </em>Fla. Stat. \u00a7 394.915. Our reasoning in <em>Medberry </em>supports that Hiteshaw\u2019s detention arises out of process issued by a state court because the detention arose from a state court detention order. Because we have already granted Hiteshaw a COA on the issue of whether the district court mischaracterized his habeas petition, we proceed to address that issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b191-7\">II. <em>Whether the District Court Mischaracterized Hiteshaw\u2019s Petition</em></p>\n<p id=\"b191-8\">We review <em>de novo </em>questions of law presented in a COA. <em>Medberry, </em>351 F.3d at 1053. In <em>Medberry, </em>we clarified the relationship between habeas petitions brought by state prisoners pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 2241 and 2254. <em>Id. </em>at 1058-62. We stated the writ of habeas corpus is a single post-conviction remedy governed both by \u00a7 2241 and \u00a7 2254, and the difference between the statutes related to the \u201cbreadth of the situations to which they apply.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1059. Habeas petitions brought pursuant to \u00a7 2241 may be granted in five situations, one of which is when the petitioner is \u201cin custody in violation of the Constitution or laws or treaties of the United States.\u201d 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2241(c)(3). \u201cSection 2254, on the other hand, applies to a subset of those to whom \u00a7 2241(c)(3) applies\u2014it applies to \u2018a person in custody <em>pursuant to the judgment of a State court\u2019 </em>who is \u2018in custody in violation of the Constitution or laws or treaties of the United States.\u2019 \u201d <em>Medberry, </em>351 F.3d at 1059 (quoting 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254(a)). Under this reasoning, \u00a7 2254 is limited only to state prisoners in custody pursuant to a state court judgment, while there \u201cremain some state prisoners to whom \u00a7 2254 does not apply.\u201d <em>Medberry, </em>351 F.3d at 1060. We continued:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b191-9\">State pre-trial detention, for example, might violate the Constitution or the laws or treaties of the United States. Yet a person held in such pre-trial detention would not be \u201cin custody pursuant to the judgment of a State court.\u201d Such a prisoner would file an application for a writ of habeas corpus governed by \u00a7 2241 only.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b191-10\">\n<em>Id.</em>\n</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b191-11\">We summarized our holding as follows: In summary, a state prisoner seeking post-conviction relief from a federal <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"164\">*164</page-number>court has but one remedy: an application for a writ of habeas corpus. All applications for writs of habeas corpus are governed by \u00a7 2241, which generally authorizes federal courts to grant the writ\u2014to both federal and state prisoners. Most state prisoners\u2019 applications for writs of habeas corpus are subject also to the additional restrictions of \u00a7 2254. That is, if a state prisoner is \u201cin custody pursuant to the judgment of a State court,\u201d his petition is subject to \u00a7 2254. If, however, a prisoner is in prison pursuant to something other than a judgment of a state court, e.g., a pretrial bond order, then his petition is not subject to \u00a7 2254.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b192-4\"><em>Id. </em>at 1062.</p>\n<p id=\"b192-5\">Hiteshaw is not \u201cin custody pursuant to a judgment of the State court.\u201d 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254(a). Rather, he is being held pursuant to a state court\u2019s pre-trial detention order resulting from the court\u2019s probable cause determination that he is a sexually violent predator under the Jimmy Ryce Act. Hiteshaw is awaiting his civil commitment trial to determine if he is in fact a sexually violent predator. In addition, according to Hiteshaw\u2019s habeas petition, he has completed serving his prison term for violating the conditions of his parole. Therefore, under the reasoning in <em>Medberry, </em>Hiteshaw, as a pre-trial detainee, is not in custody pursuant to any state court judgment, and his habeas petition should have been treated as a \u00a7 2241 petition. Thus, the district court erred by characterizing it as a \u00a7 2254 petition, and we vacate and remand to the district court so that it can analyze the petition as a \u00a7 2241 petition.</p>\n<p id=\"b192-6\">VACATED AND REMANDED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
