Wheeler was granted a certificate of appealability (COA) by the district court on one issue: whether he received ineffective assistance of counsel when his trial counsel made tactical and strategic decisions without conducting a thorough investigation of the law and facts relevant to plausible options. A district court\u2019s findings of fact on requests for habeas corpus relief are reviewed for clear error, its rulings on issues of law, <em>de novo. E.g., Wilder v. Cockrell, </em>274 F.3d 255, 259 (5th Cir.2001).</p>\n<p id=\"b616-20\">Wheeler maintains his counsel provided ineffective assistance by coercing him to plead guilty, despite the lack of an indictment. As this contention is not based on a failure to investigate and was not included in Wheeler\u2019s COA motion to the district court, a COA was not granted on the issue; therefore, we may not consider it. <em>See Whitehead v. Johnson, </em>157 F.3d 384, 388 (5th Cir.1998).</p>\n<p id=\"b616-21\">Wheeler also maintains: his counsel provided ineffective assistance by failing to investigate whether Wheeler\u2019s firearm possession was justified by necessity, and whether the firearm he possessed was a non-working weapon; and, the record lacks a transcript of his plea proceedings. Again, Wheeler\u2019s COA application did not encompass these issues; we may not consider them. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b616-22\">Wheeler also maintains his counsel failed to adequately investigate the State\u2019s proof of Wheeler\u2019s underlying felony conviction. The district court denied this claim, which was raised in Wheeler\u2019s Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 59(e) motion following the denial of his \u00a7 2254 application. \u201cA fundamental prerequisite to federal habeas relief under \u00a7 2254 is the exhaustion of all claims in state court prior to requesting federal collateral relief.\u201d <em>Smith v. Dretke, </em>422 F.3d 269, 275 (5th Cir.2005) (citation omitted). \u201c[WJhere petitioner advances in federal court an argument based on a legal theory distinct from that relied upon in the state court, he fails <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"589\">*589</page-number>to satisfy the exhaustion requirement\u201d. <em>Wilder, </em>274 F.3d at 259 (internal quotation marks and citation omitted). Wheeler did <em>not </em>raise this theory of ineffective assistance of counsel in state court. <em>See id. </em>at 261.</p>\n<p id=\"b617-5\">In any event, Wheeler\u2019s assertion is unavailing, and we may affirm the district court\u2019s denial of habeas relief on the claim. <em>See </em>\u00a7 2254(b)(2); <em>Miller v. Dretke, </em>431 F.3d 241, 245 (5th Cir.2005); <em>Mercadel v. Cain, </em>179 F.3d 271, 276 (5th Cir.1999). Wheeler does not dispute his counsel confirmed the validity of his underlying conviction, and does not assert further investigation would have uncovered information his counsel did not know already. Wheeler also does not maintain he would not have pleaded guilty but for the level of his counsel\u2019s investigation into his underlying conviction. Thus, he has not demonstrated as unreasonable the state habeas court\u2019s holding his counsel was not ineffective. <em>See </em>\u00a7 2254(d); <em>Strickland v. Washington, </em>466 U.S. 668, 688-89, 104 S.Ct. 2052, 80 L.Ed.2d 674 (1984); <em>Hill v. Lockhart, </em>474 U.S. 52, 59, 106 S.Ct. 366, 88 L.Ed.2d 203 (1985).</p>\n<p id=\"b617-6\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b616-18\"> Pursuant to 5th Cut.
