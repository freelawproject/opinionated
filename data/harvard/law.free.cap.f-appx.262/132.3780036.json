Oliver was sentenced to 240 months\u2019 imprisonment. No reversible error has been shown; we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b161-11\">Oliver challenges the district court\u2019s denial of his motion to withdraw his guilty plea. As he argued before the district court, Oliver contends that he did not knowingly and voluntarily plead guilty because his lawyer provided ineffective assistance of counsel. Oliver asserts, among other things, that his lawyer (1) did not discuss the possibility of receiving a mandatory minimum sentence, (2) informed Oliver that he would receive a sentence of less than 20 years\u2019 imprisonment if Oliver cooperated with the government, and (3) did not attend meetings with Oliver and the government to discuss Oliver\u2019s cooperation.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b161-14\">We review a district court\u2019s denial of a motion to withdraw a guilty plea for abuse of discretion. <em>United States v. Buckles, </em>843 F.2d 469, 471 (11th Cir.1988) (\u201cIt is well settled ... that there is no absolute right to withdraw a guilty plea prior to imposition of a sentence. The decision to allow withdrawal is left to the sound discretion of the trial court.\u201d). Therefore, \u201c[t]he district court may be reversed only if its decision is arbitrary or unreasonable.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b161-15\">A defendant has the burden of establishing a \u201cfair and just reason\u201d for withdrawal of his guilty plea. <em>Id. </em>In deciding whether a defendant has met this burden, \u201cthe district court may consider the totality of the circumstances surrounding the plea,\u201d including these factors: \u201c(1) whether close assistance of counsel was available; (2) whether the plea was knowing and voluntary; (3) whether judicial resources would be conserved; and (4) whether the government would be prejudiced if the defendant were allowed to withdraw his plea.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 471-72. \u201cThe timing of the [defendant\u2019s] motion to withdraw also deserves ... consideration.\u201d <em>United States v. Gonzalez-</em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"134\">*134</page-number><em>Mercado, </em>808 F.2d 796, 801 (11th Cir. 1987). And \u201cthere is a strong presumption that the statements made during the [plea] colloquy are true.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 800 n. 8.</p>\n<p id=\"b162-4\">A guilty plea is not knowing and voluntary if the defendant does not receive \u201creasonably effective assistance of counsel in connection with the decision to plead guilty.\u201d <em>McCoy v. Wainwright, </em>804 F.2d 1196, 1198 (11th Cir.1986). To determine whether a defendant has been denied effective assistance of counsel, we consider these things: \u201cFirst, the defendant must show that the counsel\u2019s performance fell below the threshold level of competence. Second, the defendant must show that counsel\u2019s errors due to deficient performance prejudiced his defense such that the reliability of the result is undermined.\u201d <em>Tafero v. Wainwright, </em>796 F.2d 1314, 1319 (11th Cir.1986).</p>\n<p id=\"b162-5\">We see no reversible error in the district court\u2019s denial of Oliver\u2019s motion to withdraw his guilty plea. Under the first part of the <em>Buckles </em>analysis, we conclude that Oliver received close assistance from his lawyer. Oliver\u2019s lawyer testified that he reviewed the plea agreement with Oliver \u201cparagraph by paragraph.\u201d And the record shows that Oliver conferred with his lawyer many times during his plea hearing\u2014which lasted over 1.5 hours and included recesses called by the district court to allow Oliver to confer with his lawyer\u2014 before answering the district court\u2019s questions and eventually pleading guilty.</p>\n<p id=\"b162-6\">We also conclude that Oliver\u2019s guilty plea was knowing and voluntary. At Oliver\u2019s plea hearing, the district court explained to Oliver that he was charged with conspiracy to distribute and possess with intent to distribute more than five kilograms of cocaine and more than 100 kilograms of marijuana and that, if he was not involved with these drug quantities, then he should not plead guilty. Oliver\u2014testifying under oath\u2014responded \u201cyes\u201d when asked by the district court if he helped to distribute more than five kilograms of cocaine. In addition, the district court told Oliver that, subject to limited exceptions described by the district court, he faced a 20-year mandatory minimum sentence, which was also discussed in Oliver\u2019s plea agreement.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> And Oliver\u2019s lawyer testified that, before the plea hearing, he discussed with Oliver that Oliver was facing a 20-year mandatory minimum sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b162-10\">We are also unpersuaded that the remaining <em>Buckles </em>factors support Oliver\u2019s argument. Oliver received a complete plea hearing and an evidentiary hearing on his motion to withdraw his guilty plea; judicial resources are conserved by denying Oliver\u2019s motion. And, as the district court discussed, the government would be prejudiced if Oliver withdrew his motion. Even though Oliver attempted to withdraw his guilty plea before he was sentenced, his codefendants have been sentenced and now have less incentive to cooperate with the government in a case against Oliver. We also note that Oliver moved to withdraw his guilty plea more than three months after pleading guilty. <em>See Buckles, </em>843 F.2d at 474 (explaining that, in determining the prejudice to the government, a court may consider \u201cthe time, money, and effort the government would have to devote to reassembling witnesses and evidence that were allowed to scatter after the acceptance of the guilty plea\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b162-11\">In sum, we conclude that the district court did not abuse its discretion in deny<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"135\">*135</page-number>ing Oliver\u2019s motion to withdraw his guilty plea. We affirm Oliver\u2019s conviction.</p>\n<p id=\"b163-5\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b161-12\">. Oliver also asserts that his lawyer was inexperienced in handling federal drug cases and that Oliver filed objections to his presentence investigation report (\u201cPSI\u201d) because his lawyer did not do so. But Oliver's lawyer testified that, besides other litigation experience, he had represented clients in two federal drug cases before representing Oliver. In addition, the filing of Oliver\u2019s PSI and his objections to it occurred <em>after </em>Oliver had pled guilty in this case. We also note that Oliver told the district court that he was satisfied with his lawyer's representation and that he had no complaints about his representation.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b162-7\">. At his plea hearing, Oliver told the district court that he read his plea agreement \u201cline-by-line and word-by-word.\"</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
