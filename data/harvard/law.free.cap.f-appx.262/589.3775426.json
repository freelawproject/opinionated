Nelson\u2019s sole argument on appeal is that the district court erred in applying U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2A2.2 based on its finding that the boiling water thrown by Nelson onto a corrections officer was a \u201cdangerous weapon\u201d under the Guidelines. Nelson argues that under \u00a7 2A2.2 a \u201cdangerous weapon\u201d refers only <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"590\">*590</page-number>to \u201cinstruments\u201d and not to substances, such as water. Nelson does not refute, however, the district court\u2019s finding that the assault caused serious bodily injuries.</p>\n<p id=\"b618-4\">Nelson has failed to demonstrate any error in the district court\u2019s finding that the hot water, in the manner used and in light of the injuries sustained, was a \u201cdangerous weapon\u201d under \u00a7 2A2.2. Accordingly, the judgment of the district court is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b617-8\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
