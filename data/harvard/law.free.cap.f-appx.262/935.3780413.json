The judgment of the district court was accompanied by a full published opinion, <em>Mahmud v. Ober</em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"936\">*936</page-number><em>man, </em>508 F.Supp.2d 1294 (2007). In his complaint, Mahmud asserted claims which he sought to establish under the <em>Bivens v. Six Unknomi Named Agents of Federal Bureau of Narcotics </em>doctrine, 403 U.S. 388, 397, 91 S.Ct. 1999, 29 L.Ed.2d 619 (1971), based upon the suspension or revocation of the Hazardous Materials Endorsement on his commercial drivers license. Based on the facts of this case, the district court held that a <em>Bivens </em>remedy for damages was not available to Mahmud, and, furthermore, Mahmud had not met his burden of establishing that due process is satisfied by the exercise of personal jurisdiction over defendant-appellee Justin P. Oberman. It granted Oberman\u2019s motion to dismiss for both reasons.</p>\n<p id=\"b964-4\">Having carefully considered the judgment and opinion of the district court, the briefs of the parties, and the record, and finding no reversible error, the judgment is AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
