Tobias consented to a search of the tractor trailer. Younce initially observed what he believed to be drug paraphernalia and later discovered a hidden compartment under the sleeper cab that contained $456,000 in cash and 439 grams of cocaine.</p>\n<p id=\"b1004-4\">Tobias first lied about the money and drugs, but eventually cooperated with the police and told them that Perez-Lopez organized the trip and made all of the arrangements. On November 17, 2004, a federal grand jury indicted Tobias and Perez-Lopez for conspiracy to possess with intent to distribute more than five kilograms of cocaine, in violation of 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 846 and 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2, and possession with intent to distribute cocaine, in violation of 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 841(a)(1) and 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2. Tobias agreed to plead guilty to the conspiracy count, and in exchange for his testimony against Perez-Lopez, the government agreed to drop the remaining count and move for a reduced sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b1004-5\">At Perez-Lopez\u2019s trial, Tobias testified about the terms of his plea agreement. Regarding the drug operation, Tobias testified that he met Perez-Lopez through his cousin, Isador Reyes, about a week before his arrest. Initially he had told the police that he had been introduced by a person named Eddie, but he later admitted that it was actually his cousin, Reyes. During a meeting outside Perez-Lopez\u2019s ranch in Texas, Reyes and Perez-Lopez offered To-bias a job driving a tractor trailer from Texas to Florida. Perez-Lopez explained that Tobias would drive a tractor trailer containing drugs and a legitimate load of limes to Florida\u2014the drugs would be stored in a hidden compartment. When Tobias arrived in Florida, he would contact a person named Burro, at a number provided by Perez-Lopez, to arrange final delivery of the drugs, and once Burro removed the drugs, Tobias would deliver the legitimate load. Perez-Lopez was supposed to pay Tobias for the trip, but no details about payment were given at that meeting.</p>\n<p id=\"b1004-7\">Tobias then testified about the details of his trip from Texas to Florida, his meeting with Burro, who arranged for the removal of the drugs, and his delivery of the load of limes. After all this had occurred, Tobias then waited in Florida for Burro to contact him again, and Burro arranged to have the money obtained by the sale of the drugs loaded into the truck\u2019s hidden compartment. Once the money was loaded, Tobias drove the tractor trailer toward Mississippi, where he was going to pick up a load of chickens. He was stopped by Deputy Younce while he was traveling through Baldwin County, Alabama.</p>\n<p id=\"b1004-8\">Once he decided to cooperate with police, Tobias: (1) told them where he had picked up the money and that he was headed to Perez-Lopez\u2019s ranch in Texas; (2) described the ranch; (3) identified Perez-Lopez in a photo line-up; and (4) provided Perez-Lopez\u2019s contact information. Tobias also agreed to place monitored calls to Perez-Lopez so he could make an excuse for the delay (which was actually caused by his arrest) and the agents could hear that Perez-Lopez knew about the money. In one of the calls, Perez-Lopez told Tobias he could take some of the money in the hidden compartment to pay for repairs on the truck.</p>\n<p id=\"b1004-9\">Before cross-examination, in a conference outside the presence of the jury, counsel for Perez-Lopez told the district court that Tobias had identified \u201cEddie\u201d as Reyes for the first time at trial and this information had not been provided in dis<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"977\">*977</page-number>covery. Counsel had a copy of Tobias\u2019 plea agreement, and its factual recital named Eddie, not Reyes. He requested access to Tobias\u2019 presentence investigation report to determine if, at that point, Tobias had admitted that it was Reyes, not a fictional Eddie, who introduced him to Perez-Lopez, and, if not, to use the PSR for impeachment purposes. The government stated that it could not say with certainty when Tobias admitted the falsehood because the original case agent no longer worked with the sheriffs office, had not documented all the interviews, and the only written report about the interviews was turned over to the defense. The government believed that it had discovered this information before Tobias\u2019 sentence hearing, but it had no documentation to show that. The district court ruled that Perez-Lopez could use the factual recital from Tobias\u2019 plea agreement to impeach him, but he could not use the PSR because it was sealed and Tobias did not sign anything agreeing to its accuracy.</p>\n<p id=\"b1005-5\">On cross-examination, Tobias admitted, among other things, that he originally lied to the agents about the existence of Eddie, but he thought that he had told them the truth about Eddie on the night of his arrest. After further questioning, he stated that he was not sure about the date, but he knew he had told the truth at some point.</p>\n<p id=\"b1005-6\">The government also presented the testimony of a number of other witnesses, including Drug Enforcement Administration agent Michael Lumpkin, who worked in the agency\u2019s Texas office and had been given the information Tobias provided about Perez-Lopez\u2019s ranch. On October 31, 2004, Lumpkin took pictures of a ranch just east of Edinburg, Texas, which agents confirmed was owned by Perez-Lopez and his wife, Lorena Perez. While monitoring the ranch, Lumpkin followed an Expedition, which was registered to Perez-Lopez and his wife, as it left the ranch, was driven through several cities, and then was driven back to the ranch. Lumpkin described the vehicle\u2019s course of action as \u201cheat runs or checking to see if it was being followed by law enforcement.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1005-8\">Perez-Lopez objected to Lumpkin\u2019s testimony about \u201cheat runs\u201d because Lump-kin had not been qualified as an expert witness, and the government had failed to provide notice that he was going to testify about surveillance techniques as an expert witness. The government explained that it was only asking Agent Lumpkin to describe his observations, and the district court overruled Perez Lopez\u2019s objection. Lumpkin then testified that the vehicle pulled into cul-de-sacs and drove around the city without stopping at any particular location before returning to the ranch. On November 12, 2004, the agents executed a search warrant at the ranch, in which they recovered a T-mobile bill for the telephone used by Tobias, Tobias\u2019 marriage license, and Perez-Lopez\u2019s financial records. The search did not yield any drugs or money.</p>\n<p id=\"b1005-9\">The government also called Sharon Murphy, an agent with Immigration and Customs Enforcement, who testified about her involvement in the investigation. She told about the phone records of Tobias and Perez-Lopez. Tobias had a number labeled as \u201cBurro\u201d in his phone, which was called many times between October 25 and October 28, 2004. When the government asked Murphy if she was aware that an investigation had been initiated with regards to Burro, Perez-Lopez objected to the testimony as irrelevant because it concerned an independent investigation of someone other than Perez-Lopez. He <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"978\">*978</page-number>also objected that the question called for inadmissible hearsay in the form of statements by other DEA agents telling Murphy that they were investigating Burro. The district court ruled that the testimony was relevant because Burro was alleged to be a conspirator in the case, and that it was not hearsay as long as Murphy refrained from stating what other agents had told her. Murphy testified that: (1) the agents in Texas, Alabama, and Florida were conducting a coordinated investigation into the drug conspiracy; (2) the agencies initiated an investigation aimed at identifying Burro and others connected to Tobias; and (3) the individual associated with the Burro phone number had been identified, but the investigation was still ongoing. Murphy also testified that at some point in the investigation, Tobias had implicated Reyes as the person who introduced him to Perez-Lopez.</p>\n<p id=\"b1006-4\">At the close of the government\u2019s case, the district court denied Perez-Lopez\u2019s motion for judgment of acquittal. Perez-Lopez recalled Tobias, and then testified on his own behalf. After both sides rested, the court submitted the case to the jury. The jury convicted Perez-Lopez on all counts, and the district court sentenced him to 300 months imprisonment on the conspiracy count and 240 months imprisonment on the possession with intent to distribute count, to be served concurrently.</p>\n<p id=\"b1006-5\">Perez-Lopez timely appealed, and he contends that the district court erred by: (1) allowing Agent Lumpkin to testify about \u201cheat runs\u201d without qualifying the agent as an expert on counter-surveillance and even though the government had failed to provide Perez-Lopez with notice of the expert testimony; (2) admitting testimony about the investigation of Burro because it was irrelevant, inadmissible hearsay, its admission violated his Sixth Amendment Confrontation Clause rights, and it was \u201camorphous bad character evidence;\u201d and (3) declining to order the government to turn over any information concerning when Tobias informed the agents that the individual who introduced him to Perez-Lopez was his cousin, Reyes. Perez-Lopez also contends that, when coupled together, the cumulative effect of the individual errors deprived him of a fair trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b1006-7\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b1006-8\">Perez-Lopez first contends that the district court abused its discretion by admitting Agent Lumpkin\u2019s testimony about \u201cheat runs\u201d because he had not been qualified as an expert in surveillance, and Perez-Lopez had not received advance notice of the expert testimony as required by Federal Rule of Criminal Procedure 16. We review rulings made under Rule 701 of the Federal Rules of Evidence only for an abuse of discretion. <em>United States v. Myers, </em>972 F.2d 1566, 1576-77 (11th Cir.1992).</p>\n<p id=\"b1006-9\">Rule 701 governs the testimony of \u201clay\u201d witnesses. It provides that the testimony of a witness who is not testifying as an expert, \u201cis limited to those opinions or inferences which are (a) rationally based on the perception of the witness, (b) helpful to a clear understanding of the witness\u2019 testimony or the determination of a fact in issue, and (c) not based on scientific, technical, or other specialized knowledge within the scope of Rule 702.\u201d Fed.R.Evid. 701.</p>\n<p id=\"b1006-10\">We have explained that in order to be rationally based on the perception of the witness, the testimony must be \u201cbased on first-hand knowledge or observation.\u201d <em>United States v. Marshall, </em>173 F.3d 1312, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"979\">*979</page-number>1315 (11th Cir.1999). The witness\u2019s perception, however, may be interpreted in light of his experience. <em>See Myers, </em>972 F.2d at 1577 (stating that a police officer could testify that burn marks on the skin were caused by a stun gun where the opinion was based on the officer\u2019s personal perceptions of the marks and his experience on the police force). We have rejected the argument that simply because a police officer testifies to an opinion based in part on his past experiences, his testimony should not be admitted under Rule 701. <em>United States v. Novaton, </em>271 F.3d 968, 1008 (11th Cir.2001).</p>\n<p id=\"b1007-5\">Rule 702 governs the testimony of expert witnesses. <em>See </em>Fed.R.Evid. 702. When the district court admits a witness\u2019s testimony under Rule 702 rather than as a lay opinion under Rule 701, the provisions of Federal Rule of Criminal Procedure 16 apply. According to Rule 16, at the defendant\u2019s request, the government must provide before trial a written summary of expert witness testimony, including \u201cthe witness\u2019s opinions, the bases and reasons for those opinions, and the witness\u2019s qualifications.\u201d Fed.R.Crim.P. 16(a)(1)(G).</p>\n<p id=\"b1007-6\">The district court did not abuse its discretion in admitting Agent Lumpkin\u2019s testimony under Federal Rule of Evidence 701 because his opinion that the vehicle he observed was conducting a \u201cheat run,\u201d or \u201cchecking to see if it was being followed,\u201d was based on his personal observations of the vehicle and his past experience as a DEA agent. Just as the district court in <em>Myers </em>did not abuse its discretion by admitting under Rule 701 an officer\u2019s testimony that the burn marks on a person\u2019s skin were the result of a stun gun based on the officer\u2019s personal observations of the marks and his past experience as a police officer, <em>see Myers, </em>972 F.2d at 1577, the district court here did not abuse its discretion by admitting under Rule 701 Lump-kin\u2019s testimony about \u201cheat runs\u201d based on his personal observations of the Expedition and his past experience as a DEA agent. Because Lumpkin provided a lay opinion, Perez-Lopez\u2019s discovery argument under Federal Rule of Criminal Procedure 16, which only applies to expert testimony, lacks merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b1007-8\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b1007-9\">Perez-Lopez next contends that the district court abused its discretion by allowing Agent Murphy to testify about the investigation of Burro in Florida because, as he argued before the district court, it was irrelevant, inadmissible hearsay. Perez-Lopez also argues for the first time on appeal that the evidence was inadmissible as \u201camorphous bad character evidence\u201d under Federal Rule of Evidence 404(b), and that the admission of this testimony violated his rights under the Sixth Amendment Confrontation Clause.</p>\n<p id=\"b1007-10\">A.</p>\n<p id=\"b1007-11\">We review evidentiary rulings only for an abuse of discretion. <em>United States v. Baker, </em>432 F.3d 1189, 1202 (11th Cir.2005). The district court abuses its discretion when its \u201cdecision rests upon a clearly erroneous finding of fact, an errant conclusion of law, or an improper application of law to fact.\u201d <em>Id. </em>\u201cEven if an abuse of discretion is shown, nonconstitutional evidentiary errors are not grounds <em>for </em>reversal absent a reasonable likelihood that the defendant\u2019s substantial rights were affected.\u201d <em>United States v. Malol, </em>476 F.3d 1283, 1291 (11th Cir.2007) (quotations omitted). Reversal is not warranted \u201cwhere an error had no substantial influ<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"980\">*980</page-number>ence on the outcome, and sufficient evidence uninfected by error supports the verdict.\u201d <em>United States v. Arbolaez, </em>450 F.3d 1283, 1290 (11th Cir.2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b1008-4\">The Federal Rules of Evidence provide that only relevant evidence is admissible. Fed.R.Evid. 402. \u201cRelevant evidence\u201d is \u201cevidence having any tendency to make the existence of any fact that is of consequence to the determination of the action more probable or less probable than it would be without the evidence.\u201d Fed. R.Evid. 401.</p>\n<p id=\"b1008-5\">The district court did not abuse its discretion by concluding that Agent Murphy\u2019s testimony about the investigation of Burro was relevant. The government had already provided evidence that Tobias had delivered drugs to a man named Burro in Florida, that Perez-Lopez had given him a phone number for Burro, and that Tobias had contacted Burro at that number several times between October 25 and October 28, 2004. The fact that the DEA was conducting an ongoing investigation of Burro in Florida was relevant to the scope and existence of the overall conspiracy and corroborated the other evidence presented by the government.</p>\n<p id=\"b1008-6\">The district court also did not abuse its discretion by concluding that Agent Murphy\u2019s testimony was not hearsay. Under Federal Rule of Evidence 801, hearsay is defined as \u201ca statement, other than one made by the declarant while testifying at the trial or hearing, offered in evidence to prove the truth of the matter asserted.\u201d Fed.R.Evid. 801(c). Subject to certain exceptions, hearsay is not admissible at trial. <em>See </em>Fed.R.Evid. 802.</p>\n<p id=\"b1008-7\">Agent Murphy testified that there was a coordinated investigation occurring in Texas, Alabama, and Florida, and that she was aware that Burro had been identified as part of the ongoing investigation into the charged conspiracy. Her testimony did not include any statements from other agents, and it appears to have been based on her personal participation in the coordinated investigation of the conspiracy. A witness\u2019s testimony at trial based on her personal observations, which does not include out-of-court statements, is not hearsay. <em>See </em>Fed.R.Evid. 801(c).</p>\n<p id=\"b1008-9\">B.</p>\n<p id=\"b1008-10\">Perez-Lopez argues for the first time on appeal that admission of the evidence about the investigation of Burro violated his Sixth Amendment Confrontation Clause rights. We review a claim of error raised for the first time on appeal only for plain error. <em>Baker, </em>432 F.3d at 1202-03, 1206. Plain error exists where (1) there is an error; (2) the error is plain or obvious; and (3) the error affects the defendant\u2019s substantial rights. <em>United States v. Olano, </em>507 U.S. 725, 732-34, 113 S.Ct. 1770, 1776-78, 123 L.Ed.2d 508 (1993). When these three factors are met, we may then exercise our discretion and correct the error only if it seriously affects the fairness, integrity, or public reputation of judicial proceedings. <em>Id. </em>at 732, 113 S.Ct. at 1776. Whether the error affected a defendants\u2019s substantial rights hinges on whether the error affected the outcome of the proceeding. <em>Arbolaez, </em>450 F.3d at 1291.</p>\n<p id=\"b1008-11\">\u201cThe Confrontation Clause of the Sixth Amendment guarantees criminal defendants an opportunity to impeach through cross-examination the testimony of adverse witnesses.\u201d <em>United States v. AriasIzquierdo, </em>449 F.3d 1168, 1178 (11th Cir.2006), ce<em>rt. denied., </em>- U.S. -, 127 S.Ct. 1041, 166 L.Ed.2d 752 (2007). The Confrontation Clause forbids the introduc<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"981\">*981</page-number>tion of testimonial hearsay evidence at trial, unless: (1) the declarant is unavailable; and (2) the defendant had a prior opportunity to cross-examine the declarant. <em>Crawford v. Washington, </em>541 U.S. 36, 68, 124 S.Ct. 1354, 1374, 158 L.Ed.2d 177 (2004).</p>\n<p id=\"b1009-5\">There was no error, much less plain error. The district court did not violate Perez-Lopez\u2019s Confrontation Clause l\u2019ights by admitting Agent Murphy\u2019s testimony that Burro, an unindicted co-conspirator, was under investigation because the testimony was based on her personal knowledge and was not hearsay. Moreover, Perez-Lopez was given an opportunity to fully cross-examine Murphy about the investigation during the trial, and therefore his Confrontation Clause rights were not violated.</p>\n<p id=\"b1009-6\">C.</p>\n<p id=\"b1009-7\">Perez-Lopez also argues for the first time on appeal that the evidence about the investigation of Burro constituted improper character evidence, in violation of Federal Rule of Evidence 404(b). As with Perez-Lopez\u2019s Confrontation Clause argument, we also review this argument only for plain error. <em>Baker, </em>432 F.3d at 1202-03, 1206.</p>\n<p id=\"b1009-8\">Rule 404(b) forbids the admission of any evidence of \u201cother crimes, wrongs, or acts ... to prove the character of a person in order to show action in conformity therewith.\u201d Fed.R.Evid. 404(b). However, such evidence \u201cmay ... be admissible for other purposes, such as proof of motive, opportunity, intent, preparation, plan, knowledge, identity, or absence of mistake or accident.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1009-9\">Perez-Lopez\u2019s argument that the testimony was inadmissible character evidence is meritless. As mentioned above, Agent Murphy\u2019s testimony related to an investigation of Burro regarding the underlying crime at issue under the charged conspiracy. There was no reference to any \u201cother crimes, wrongs, or acts\u201d committed by Perez-Lopez, or to his character. <em>See </em>Fed.R.Evid. 404(b). Rule 404(b) does not apply.</p>\n<p id=\"b1009-11\">IV.</p>\n<p id=\"b1009-12\">Perez-Lopez next contends, that the district court erred in declining to order the government to turn over information about when Tobias informed the agents that the individual who introduced him to Perez-Lopez was his cousin, Reyes. Perez-Lopez argues that the information, including Tobias\u2019 presentence investigation report, was necessary for his attack on Tobias\u2019 credibility, which he argues was the central issue of the case.</p>\n<p id=\"b1009-13\">We review <em>de novo </em>whether a violation of <em>Brady v. Maryland, </em>373 U.S. 83, 83 S.Ct. 1194, 10 L.Ed.2d 215 (1963), occurred below. <em>United States v. Schlei, </em>122 F.3d 944, 989 (11th Cir.1997). Upon request, the government has a duty to reveal any \u201cevidence [that] is material either to guilt or to punishment, irrespective of the good faith or bad faith of the prosecution.\u201d <em>Brady, </em>373 U.S. at 87, 83 S.Ct. at 1196-97. This duty covers \u201c[i]mpeachment evidence ... as well as exculpatory evidence.\u201d <em>United States v. Bagley, </em>473 U.S. 667, 676, 105 S.Ct. 3375, 3380, 87 L.Ed.2d 481 (1985). The government violates a defendant\u2019s constitutional right to due process when it suppresses requested evidence that is favorable to the accused and the suppressed evidence is material. <em>United States v. Perez, </em>473 F.3d 1147, 1150 (11th Cir.2006), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014\u2014 U.S.-, 127 S.Ct. 2147, 167 L.Ed.2d 876 (2007).</p>\n<p id=\"b1009-16\">In order to establish constitutional error under <em>Brady, </em>a defendant must show \u201c(1) that the Government possessed evidence favorable to the defendant (including im<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"982\">*982</page-number>peachment evidence); (2) that the defendant did not possess the evidence nor could he have obtained it himself with any reasonable diligence; (3) that the prosecution suppressed the favorable evidence; and (4) that had the evidence been revealed to the defense, there is a reasonable probability that the outcome of the proceedings would have been different.\u201d <em>Id. </em>\u201cWithin the possession, custody, or control of the government does not include possession of a federal court or probation officer.\u201d <em>United States v. Brazel, </em>102 F.3d 1120, 1150 (11th Cir.1997) (citation omitted); <em>see also United States v. Trevino, </em>556 F.2d 1265, 1270-71 (5th Cir.1977) (holding that a PSR generally is not considered to be in the government\u2019s possession for purposes of <em>Brady </em>material).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1010-4\">Perez-Lopez\u2019s argument is without merit because the record shows that documents containing the information he sought either did not exist because of the poor recordkeeping by the original case officer, or, in the case of Tobias\u2019 PSR, the document was not in the possession of the government for the purposes of <em>Brady. </em>Moreover, Perez-Lopez cannot show that there is a reasonable probability that, had the evidence been disclosed, the outcome of the trial would have been different. He presented much the same information through other evidence, including Tobias\u2019 and Agent Murphy\u2019s testimony, and he effectively impeached Tobias using other evidence, such as the factual recitation in his plea agreement. Accordingly, there was no <em>Brady </em>violation here.</p>\n<p id=\"b1010-5\">V.</p>\n<p id=\"b1010-6\">Perez-Lopez finally contends that when coupled together, the cumulative effect of the individual errors deprived him of a fair trial. We address a claim of cumulative error by first considering the validity of each claim individually. <em>United States v. Calderon, </em>127 F.3d 1314, 1333 (11th Cir.1997). We then examine the evidentiary errors in the aggregate and the trial \u201cas a whole to determine whether the appellant was afforded a fundamentally fair trial.\u201d <em>Id. </em>We will reverse if the cumulative effect is prejudicial, even if each individual error was harmless. <em>Baker, </em>432 F.3d at 1203. However, where there is no error or only a single error, there can be no cumulative error. <em>United States v. Waldon, </em>363 F.3d 1103, 1110 (11th Cir.2004).</p>\n<p id=\"b1010-11\">Because the district court did not commit any individual errors, there cannot be any cumulative prejudicial error.</p>\n<p id=\"b1010-12\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1010-7\">.
