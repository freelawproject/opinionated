According to the Bureau of Prisons website, appellant is scheduled to complete his term of imprisonment on January 21, 2008. Because his release is imminent or has occurred, this court cannot usefully grant the only relief to which appellant would have been entitled: re-sentencing.</p>\n<p id=\"b689-23\">Because no effective judicial remedy exists, we must DISMISS this appeal as MOOT.</p>\n<p id=\"b689-24\">DISMISSED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b689-19\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
