Guzman was sentenced to 37 months of imprisonment and a three-year term of supervised release. Guzman gave timely notice of his appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b622-21\">Guzman contends that the district court erred in ruling that his prior New York conviction of third-degree rape was a \u201ccrime of violence\u201d for purposes of U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2L1.2. <em>See </em>N.Y. Penal Law \u00a7 130.25 (McKinney 2004). We review this question de novo. <em>See United States v. Villegas, </em>404 F.3d 355, 359-61 (5th Cir. 2005). We reject Guzman\u2019s argument that the district court did not have competent evidence from which to determine the offense of conviction. <em>See United States v. Neri-Hemandes, </em>504 F.3d 587, 592 (5th Cir.2007).</p>\n<p id=\"b622-22\">Under \u00a7 2L1.2(b)(l)(A)(ii), a defendant\u2019s offense level is increased by 16 levels if, prior to deportation, he was convicted of a \u201ccrime of violence.\u201d The offense of statutory rape is a crime of violence. \u00a7 2L1.2, comment. (n.l(B)(iii)). Guzman was convicted under part 2 of \u00a7 130.25, under which a person is guilty of rape in the third degree when, \u201cbeing twenty-one years old or more, he or she engages in sexual intercourse with another person to whom the actor is not married less than seventeen years old.\u201d \u00a7 130.25-2. This statutory definition is consistent with a \u201ccommon sense\u201d meaning of the offense of statutory rape. <em>See United States v. Izaguirre-Flores, </em>405 F.3d 270, 275 (5th Cir. 2005). The district court did not err in applying \u00a7 2L2.1(b)(l)(A)(ii).</p>\n<p id=\"b622-23\">In light of <em>Apprendi v. New Jersey, </em>530 U.S. 466, 120 S.Ct. 2348, 147 L.Ed.2d 435 (2000), Guzman challenges the constitutionality of 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1326(b)\u2019s treatment of prior felony and aggravated felony convictions as sentencing factors rather than <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"595\">*595</page-number>elements of the offense that must be found by a jury. This court has held that this issue is \u201cfully foreclosed from further debate.\u201d <em>United States v. Pineda-Arrellano, </em>492 F.3d 624, 625 (5th Cir.2007), <em>petition far cert. filed </em>(Aug. 28, 2007) (No. 07-6202).</p>\n<p id=\"b623-5\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b622-19\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
