After the INS served a notice to appear, Chen filed an application for asylum and withholding of removal under the Immigration and Nationality Act, and sought relief under the United Nations Convention Against Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman and Degrading Treatment or Pun<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"985\">*985</page-number>ishment. In his application, Chen alleged that he had been persecuted both because he sued a local Chinese official over payment for the sale of land and because his wife had given birth to a second child in violation of China\u2019s one child family planning policy.</p>\n<p id=\"b1013-5\">In an oral decision, the IJ made an adverse credibility determination. The IJ further concluded that Chen had failed both to prove his identity and to provide sufficient evidence to support a finding that he and his wife had violated China\u2019s family planning policy or would likely be harmed due to any such alleged violation. The IJ, therefore, denied all forms of relief.</p>\n<p id=\"b1013-6\">Chen filed a notice of appeal with the BIA. In his brief, Chen claimed for the first time that his wife, who was still in China, had been forcibly sterilized. Chen also attached new evidence relating both to his wife\u2019s sterilization and his identity for the BIA to consider. However, the BIA affirmed the IJ\u2019s adverse credibility determination, and further concluded that it could not consider the new evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b1013-7\">In December 2006, Chen filed a motion to reopen his removal proceedings based on new evidence that he alleged proved his identity and established that his wife had been forcibly sterilized two months before his removal hearing. The new evidence included, among other things, an x-ray, which listed Chen\u2019s wife as the patient and included a patient identification number and film number, as well as a separate <em>report from </em>a United States physician stating that the x-ray depicted a sterilization. According to Chen, the evidence previously had been unavailable because he had not been aware of his wife\u2019s sterilization before his removal hearing, which Chen\u2019s wife confirmed in a letter that he also submitted as new evidence. Chen submitted a copy of his passport as proof of his identity. The BIA denied Chen\u2019s motion. With regard to the physician\u2019s report, the BIA specifically stated that although it was \u201cthe key evidence to support [Chen\u2019s] request,\u201d the report did not identify \u201cthe name of the patient or even attempt to connect the patient to [Chen].\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1013-10\">Chen petitions for review, arguing that the BIA erred by failing to grant his motion to reopen based on new evidence pertaining to his identity and his wife\u2019s sterilization. According to Chen, the BIA erroneously concluded that the submitted physician\u2019s report did not identify his wife as the patient who had been sterilized.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Chen further claims that the BIA erred by failing to address the relevance of the evidence that he submitted concerning his identity. Finally, Chen attacks the IJ\u2019s adverse credibility determination.</p>\n<p id=\"b1013-11\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b1013-12\">\u201cWe review the BIA\u2019s denial of a motion to reopen for an abuse of discretion.\u201d <em>Abdi v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>430 F.3d 1148, 1149 (11th Cir.2005). \u201cOur review is limited to determining \u2018whether there has been an exercise of administrative discretion <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"986\">*986</page-number>and whether the [manner] of exercise has been arbitrary and capricious.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>(citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b1014-4\">An alien is permitted to file one motion to reopen. 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1229a(c)(6)(A). That motion must be filed within ninety days \u201cof the date of entry of the final administrative order of removal,\u201d <em>id. </em>\u00a7 1229a(c)(7)(C)(I), and must \u201cstate the new facts that will be proven at a hearing to be held if the motion is granted, and shall be supported by affidavits or other evidentiary material.\u201d <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 1229a(c)(7)(B).</p>\n<p id=\"b1014-6\">\u201cA motion to reopen proceedings shall not be granted unless it appears to the Board that evidence sought to be offered is material and was not available and could not have been discovered or presented at the former hearing.\u201d 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1003.2(c)(1). We have recognized that this regulation is \u201cframed negatively\u201d and \u201cdoes not affirmatively require the Board to reopen the proceedings under any particular condition.\u201d <em>Al Najjar, </em>257 F.3d at 1301 (internal quotation marks and citation omitted). Thus, we have said that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1014-7\">At a minimum, there are at least three independent grounds upon which the Board may deny a motion to reopen: 1) failure to establish a prima facie case; 2) failure to introduce evidence that was material and previously unavailable; and 3) a determination that despite the alien\u2019s statutory eligibility for relief, he or she is not entitled to a favorable exercise of discretion.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1014-10\"><em>Id. </em>at 1302; <em>see also INS v. Abudu, </em>485 U.S. 94, 104-05, 108 S.Ct. 904, 912, 99 L.Ed.2d 90 (1988).</p>\n<p id=\"b1014-11\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b1014-12\">As an initial matter, we conclude that we do not have jurisdiction to review the IJ\u2019s adverse credibility determination. A petitioner has only thirty days from the date of the final order of removal within which to file a petition for review. 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(b)(1). The final order of removal in this case was entered on September 5, 2006. Chen did not file a petition for review until over seven months later on April 30, 2007. For that reason, we cannot review the IJ\u2019s adverse credibility determination. <em>See Dakane v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>399 F.3d 1269, 1272 n. 3 (11th Cir.2005) (refusing to consider the merits of the BIA\u2019s final order of removal based on a lack of jurisdiction because the alien filed his petition for review \u201cover four months from the issuance of the final order of removal\u201d). Accordingly, we dismiss Chen\u2019s petition to the extent that it seeks review of the IJ\u2019s credibility finding.</p>\n<p id=\"b1014-13\">With respect to Chen\u2019s petition insofar as it challenges the BIA\u2019s denial of his motion to reopen, we conclude that the BIA abused its discretion.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> In denying Chen\u2019s motion to reopen, the BIA did not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"987\">*987</page-number>make a finding as to whether the newly submitted evidence was previously unavailable. It did, however, analyze the evidence and apparently concluded that it was not material. Specifically, the BIA focused on the physician\u2019s report offered by Chen, calling it \u201cthe key evidence to support [Chen\u2019s] request.\u201d Indeed, the report was the only piece of evidence explicitly addressed in the BIA\u2019s order. However, the BIA concluded that the medical evidence was \u201cindecisive\u201d because the physician\u2019s report did \u201cnot identify the name of the patient or even attempt to connect the patient to [Chen].\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1015-5\">A thorough review of the record reveals that the BIA\u2019s factual determination with respect to the physician\u2019s report is not supported by the record. Although the physician\u2019s report does not explicitly mention Chen\u2019s wife by name, it does contain identification numbers that match the numbers associated with Chen\u2019s wife as provided on the x-ray and in a separate x-ray report. Both the physician\u2019s report and the x-ray report are labeled with the same patient identification number and the same film number. Furthermore, the physician\u2019s report and the x-ray itself also include the same film number. Thus, the physician\u2019s report submitted by Chen did identify the patient as Chen\u2019s wife, even if not explicitly by name.</p>\n<p id=\"b1015-6\">According to the physician\u2019s report, the x-ray of Chen\u2019s wife depicts a sterilization. Chen\u2019s new evidence of his wife\u2019s forced sterilization, if believed, \u201cwould likely change the result in the case.\u201d <em>Ali v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>443 F.3d 804, 813 (11th Cir.2006). Under the INA, \u201c[a] person who has been forced to ... undergo involuntary sterilization ... shall be deemed to have been persecuted on account of political opinion.\u201d 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1101(a)(42)(B). Furthermore, in <em>In re C-Y-Z, </em>21 I. &amp; N. Dec. 915 (BIA 1997), the BIA held that an individual whose spouse has been forcibly sterilized qualifies for asylum. <em>Id. </em>at 919-20. This Court has never rejected the BIA\u2019s position in <em>In re C-Y-Z. See Yang v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>494 F.3d 1311, 1317 (11th Cir.2007) (\u201cBecause Yang concedes that he was not Ling\u2019s legal spouse, we have no occasion to decide whether the BIA\u2019s interpretation of the refugee statute is due <em>Chevron </em>deference.\u201d). Accordingly, evidence of the forced sterilization of Chen\u2019s wife is significant in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b1015-8\">Moreover, although the BIA suggested that the other evidence submitted by Chen was irrelevant, it is unclear how, without discounting the credibility of that evidence, the BIA could make such a determination in light of Chen\u2019s new allegations. For example, Chen\u2019s additional evidence also included a letter from his wife confirming her forced sterilization, which, if believed, lends substantial support to Chen\u2019s allegations of persecution.</p>\n<p id=\"b1015-9\">Although there also appears to be some question concerning Chen\u2019s identity, the BIA did not rely on previous doubts about Chen\u2019s identity in denying his motion to reopen. While Chen did submit a passport as new evidence with his motion, it does not appear to have been previously unavailable, because Chen acknowledged at his initial removal hearing that he had a passport even though it was not in the record. However, the BIA\u2019s order denying Chen\u2019s motion to reopen did not rely on or even discuss the issue of Chen\u2019s identity. Instead, the BIA relied on an erroneous evaluation of what it deemed \u201cthe key evidence\u201d regarding the forced sterilization of Chen\u2019s wife.</p>\n<p id=\"b1015-10\">We express no opinion as to how this case should ultimately be resolved. Nota<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"988\">*988</page-number>bly, the BIA\u2019s order denying Chen\u2019s motion to reopen did not even make a conclusive finding as to whether Chen\u2019s new evidence was previously unavailable. However, in light of the BIA\u2019s clear factual error, we vacate and remand Chen\u2019s petition in part so that the BIA may reassess the new evidence submitted by Chen in conjunction with his motion to reopen. That reassessment may include whether the evidence was previously unavailable.</p>\n<p id=\"b1016-4\">PETITION DISMISSED IN PART, VACATED AND REMANDED IN PART.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1013-8\">. Chen has requested that we consider a revised version of the physician's letter, explicitly naming Chen\u2019s wife, that he attached to his brief. Because that letter is not part of the administrative record, however, it is not properly before this Court. <em>See </em>8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(b)(4)(A) (\"[T]he court of appeals shall decide the petition only on the administrative record on which the order of removal is based.\u201d); <em>Al Najjar v. Ashcroft, </em>257 F.3d 1262, 1278 (11th Cir.2001) (holding that we \"cannot engage in fact-finding on appeal, nor may we weigh evidence that was not previously considered below\u201d).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b1014-8\">. The government contends that summary disposition of this case is appropriate because Chen waived his issues on appeal by failing to cite to the record or provide sufficient citations to relevant authorities in his brief. Our review of Chen's brief reveals that it does cite some legal authority and presents arguments in support of the issues raised on appeal. Accordingly, Chen has not waived his issues on appeal and summary disposition of the case is not appropriate. <em>See Greenbriar, Ltd. </em>v. <em>City of Alabaster, </em>881 F.2d 1570, 1573 n. 6 (11th Cir.1989) (deeming issues waived where the appellant fails to argue the issues on appeal); <em>Groendyke Transport, Inc. v. Davis, </em>406 F.2d 1158, 1161-62 (5th Cir.1969) (stating that summary disposition is proper where \"the position of one of the parties is clearly right as a matter of law so that there can be no substantial question as to the outcome of the case\").</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
