Watson for use of a firearm during and in relation to a drug trafficking crime, in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924(c)(1)(A), was based on his trade of drugs to an undercover agent in exchange for a handgun. When he pleaded guilty, Watson reserved the right to challenge on appeal the sufficiency of the factual basis to support his conviction under the statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b641-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"613\">*613</page-number>We followed our precedent in rejecting Watson\u2019s insistence that an act like his\u2014 obtaining a firearm in exchange for drugs\u2014is distinguishable from our precedent sustaining convictions when the defendant receives drugs or other consideration in exchange for a firearm that he possessed and gives up in the exchange transaction.</p>\n<p id=\"b641-5\">The Supreme Court of the United States granted <em>certiorari, </em>and <em>sub nom Watson v.
