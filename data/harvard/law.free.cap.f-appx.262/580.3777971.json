He argues that the district court erred in treating his Texas aggravated assault conviction as a crime of violence (COV) that warranted the 16-level enhancement of U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2L1.2(b)(l)(A)(ii) (2005). He also contends that the district court erred in imposing a sentence that exceeded the two year statutory maximum found in \u00a7 1326.</p>\n<p id=\"b608-20\">In <em>United States v. Guillen-Alvarez, </em>489 F.3d 197, 198-201 (5th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>- U.S. -, 128 S.Ct. 418, 169 L.Ed.2d 293 (2007), this court held that the Texas aggravated assault statute, Texas Penal Code \u00a7 22.02 (Vernon 2000), is substantially similar to the definition of aggravated assault under the Model Penal Code and therefore qualifies as the enumerated offense of aggravated assault under the Guidelines. The statutory language at issue in <em>Guillen-Alvarez </em>is identical to the language at issue in this case. Jove argues that <em>United States v. Dominguez-Ochoa, </em>386 F.3d 639, 642-43 (5th Cir.2004), in which this court held that criminally negligent homicide under Texas law was not the equivalent of the generic offense of manslaughter and therefore was not a COV, conflicts with <em>Guillen-Alvarez </em>and should control his case. However, <em>Dominguez-Ochoa </em>is not dispositive of the issue that is before this court. <em>Guillen-Alvarez </em>sets forth controlling authority and resolves the arguments that Jove presents to this court. Jove\u2019s Texas conviction for aggravated assault thus qualifies as the enumerated offense of aggravated assault under the Guidelines. <em>See Guillen-Alvarez, </em>489 F.3d at 198-201.</p>\n<p id=\"b608-22\">In light of <em>Apprendi v. New Jersey, </em>530 U.S. 466, 120 S.Ct. 2348, 147 L.Ed.2d 435 (2000), Jove challenges the constitutionality of \u00a7 1326(b)\u2019s treatment of prior felony and aggravated felony convictions as sentencing factors rather than elements of the offense that must be found by a jury. This court has held that this issue is \u201cfully foreclosed from further debate.\u201d <em>United States v. Pineda-Arrellano, </em>492 F.3d 624, 625 (5th Cir.2007), <em>petition for cert. filed </em>(Aug. 28, 2007) (No. 07-6202).</p>\n<p id=\"b609-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"581\">*581</page-number>For the foregoing reasons, the district court\u2019s judgment is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b608-17\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5tii Cir.
