He now appeals his sentence, contending that the district court erred in enhancing his offense level on the ground that he committed the offense while on supervised release.</p>\n<p id=\"b208-6\">The Guidelines sentence range the court found called for a prison term of 15-21 months. That range was inapplicable, however, because the mandatory minimum sentence the court was required to impose exceeded the sentence range. See U.S.S.G. \u00a7 5Gl.l(b) Therefore, even if we were to agree with appellant\u2014that the court erred in enhancing his offense level\u2014the error was harmless.</p>\n<p id=\"b208-7\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
