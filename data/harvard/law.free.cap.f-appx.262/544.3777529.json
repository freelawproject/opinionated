Lewis first challenges the finding that he is removable for falsely claiming United States citizenship, and asserts that the Board erred in finding that he never contested this ground of removability on appeal. Our review discloses that Lewis in fact failed to exhaust administrative remedies with respect to this claim by raising it on appeal to the Board of Immigration Appeals. As such, we lack jurisdiction to review this unexhausted claim. See 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(d)(1) (2000). Next, Lewis asserts that his right to due process was violated when the Immigration Judge precluded the presentation of evidence of rehabilitation at the 2005 hearings concerning Lewis\u2019s attempt to adjust his status. We find that Lewis cannot succeed with this due process claim because he fails to show the requisite prejudice resulting from the alleged error. See <em>Rusu v. INS, </em>296 F.3d 316, 320-21 (4th Cir.2002).</p>\n<p id=\"b573-10\">Accordingly, we dismiss in part and deny in part the petition for review. We deny Lewis\u2019s motion to reconsider the denial of his motion to remand. Finally, we dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b573-12\">\n<em>PETITION DISMISSED IN PART; DENIED IN PART</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
