Rangel was sen-fenced to 37 months of imprisonment and to a three-year term of supervised release. He argues on appeal the district court erred in denying his motion to suppress the marijuana because the border patrol agents lacked reasonable suspicion to conduct an investigatory stop of his vehicle. He also argues that the district court erred in finding that he gave the agents consent to search the trunk of his vehicle.</p>\n<p id=\"b619-25\">Under the totality of the circumstances and in consideration of the factors set forth in <em>United States v. Brignoni-Ponce, </em>422 U.S. 873, 884-85, 95 S.Ct. 2574, 45 L.Ed.2d 607 (1975), especially the proximity to the border, the sensor alert, and the characteristics of the vehicle, the border patrol agents\u2019 stop of Rangel\u2019s vehicle was based on reasonable suspicion. <em>See id., United States v. Jacquinot, </em>258 F.3d 423, 427 (5th Cir.2001). Additionally, based on the district court\u2019s credibility determination and because there are sufficient factors to support consent, there is no clear error regarding the district court\u2019s determination that Rangel gave the agents consent to search the trunk of his vehicle. <em>See United States v. Estrada, </em>459 F.3d 627, 633-34 (5th Cir.2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b619-26\">Accordingly, Rangel\u2019s conviction and sentence are AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b619-21\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
