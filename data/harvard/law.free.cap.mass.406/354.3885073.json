Warner argues that (1) the Commissioner lacked jurisdiction to interpret the settlement agreement to which he was a party or to adjudicate his own claim that the agreement had been violated; (2) the settlement agreement does not apply to Warner\u2019s operation in Massachusetts; (3) even if it does apply, Warner has not breached the agreement; and (4) any breach of the agreement by Fireman\u2019s Fund Insurance Companies <footnotemark>3</footnotemark> does not warrant revocation of Warner\u2019s license. We agree with Warner that the Commissioner\u2019s expertise does not extend to the interpretation of the agreement. We therefore remand the case to the single justice with an instruction that she transfer the case to Superior Court for resolution of the factual disputes and consideration of the legal issues.</p>\n<p id=\"b373-5\">We summarize the undisputed facts. On July 1, 1987, claiming it could no longer profit from the sale of insurance in Massachusetts and without giving any prior notice, representatives of Fireman\u2019s Fund informed the Commissioner <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"356\">*356</page-number>and Commonwealth Automobile Reinsurers (CAR),<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> that Fireman\u2019s Fund had deliberately allowed its licenses to expire, and that Fireman\u2019s Fund considered itself to be no longer licensed to write insurance in Massachusetts. Fireman\u2019s Fund representatives also informed CAR that Fireman\u2019s Fund no longer considered itself a member of, or servicing carrier for CAR.</p>\n<p id=\"b374-4\">The Division of Insurance (division) advised Fireman\u2019s Fund that it could not unilaterally abandon the Massachusetts market on less than one day\u2019s notice and renewed Fireman\u2019s Fund licenses for the following policy year. On July 3, 1987, the division filed suit in Superior Court and obtained an order temporarily restraining Fireman\u2019s Fund from surrendering its insurance licenses and terminating its insurance .business in Massachusetts without first fulfilling its responsibilities as an insurer and a CAR servicing carrier, as required by statute and CAR\u2019s Rules of Operation. On July 10, 1987, the restraining order was continued by stipulation until further order of the court.</p>\n<p id=\"b374-5\">Between July 3 and November 13, 1987, the division, CAR, and Fireman\u2019s Fund engaged in settlement negotiations. Initially, Fireman\u2019s Fund proposed either (1) to settle its obligation to CAR by paying $25,000,000 and withdrawing completely from the Massachusetts insurance market; or (2) to pay CAR $75,000,000 and withdraw only from, the automobile insurance market. Negotiations quickly focused on the first proposal.</p>\n<p id=\"b375-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"357\">*357</page-number>On October 14, 1987, with negotiations at an impasse, Fireman\u2019s Fund filed suit in Superior Court challenging the Commissioner\u2019s power unilaterally to renew its licenses, and claiming that it was no longer a member of CAR and owed no financial obligation to CAR.</p>\n<p id=\"b375-5\">On November 13, 1987, the seven companies constituting Fireman\u2019s Fund, CAR, and the Commissioner signed an agreement to settle the two lawsuits. Stipulations of dismissal with prejudice were simultaneously executed and filed in the Superior Court. The court entered judgments of dismissal in both cases.</p>\n<p id=\"b375-6\">Immediately prior to the agreement\u2019s execution, the Commissioner met privately with Joseph Brown, vice chairman of Fireman\u2019s Fund, who testified at the administrative proceeding that he assured the Commissioner that Fireman\u2019s Fund would not try to maintain the business it was leaving behind. Brown testified that he \u201ccommented to [the Commissioner] that at some point in the future we intended to once again be represented in . . . Massachusetts to be able to write the commercial business\u201d but not personal automobile insurance. According to Brown, the Commissioner responded, \u201cWhen that time comes, we will have to talk about it.\u201d The administrative record shows that Brown did not question the Commissioner about his response or seek a clarification as to the Commissioner\u2019s understanding of the agreement.</p>\n<p id=\"b375-7\">In a second meeting attended by representatives of all of the parties, the Commissioner indicated that, at the earlier meeting, Brown had promised to seek approval before returning to Massachusetts. According to testimony in the record, Brown did not dispute this account.</p>\n<p id=\"b375-8\">Paragraph one of the settlement agreement provides that, \u201c[a]s of the date of this Agreement, Fireman\u2019s Fund will no longer be licensed to issue or to sell insurance policies of any kind in the Commonwealth and shall not issue or sell insurance policies without a license.\u201d Paragraph four required Fireman\u2019s Fund to pay $45,000,000 to CAR in complete satisfaction of its obligations and liabilities to CAR for policy years 1987 and 1988.</p>\n<p id=\"b376-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"358\">*358</page-number>The settlement agreement contains mutual clauses, releasing the parties from all claims that were or could have been raised prior to the agreement. The agreement includes an integration clause stating that it \u201crepresents the full and entire agreement between the parties, superseding any other prior or contemporaneous written or oral agreements or understandings . . . .\u201d The agreement expressly states that the Commissioner retains full statutory and regulatory authority over Fireman\u2019s Fund\u2019s reinsurance and surplus lines, which were unaffected by the agreement.</p>\n<p id=\"b376-5\">Following execution of the settlement agreement, Fireman\u2019s Fund \u201cdismantled its entire operation in Massachusetts by severing relationships with its 375 agents, terminating some 600 employees, . . . allow [ing] all of the policies written in Massachusetts to expire,\u201d and paying $45,000,000 to CAR, as required by the settlement agreement. On September 29, 1988, National Surety Corporation (NSC), a wholly-owned subsidiary of Fireman\u2019s Fund and a party to the settlement agreement, purchased Warner, an Illinois insurance corporation licensed in Massachusetts to write most insurance, but not motor vehicle insurance. At that time, Warner had no business, no employees, and no policyholders in Massachusetts.</p>\n<p id=\"b376-6\">On October 12, 1988, the division commenced an administrative action pursuant to G. L. c. 30A, c. 175, \u00a7\u00a7 5 and 22H, c. 176D, and 801 Code Mass. Regs. \u00a7 1.01 (6) (d), ordering Warner to show cause why the Commissioner should not revoke Warner\u2019s license to write insurance in the Commonwealth for alleged violations of the insurance statutes. The division was allowed t\u00f3 amend its order to show cause to add Fireman\u2019s Fund.</p>\n<p id=\"b376-7\">After an evidentiary hearing, the Commissioner issued a decision revoking Warner\u2019s license. The Commissioner ruled that the plain language of the settlement agreement (1) required Fireman\u2019s Fund to completely withdraw from the Massachusetts market; (2) prohibited Fireman\u2019s Fund from directly benefiting from the transaction of insurance business in Massachusetts, \u201csuch benefit being the ability to profit di<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"359\">*359</page-number>rectly from the sale of insurance in Massachusetts\u201d; and (3) obligated Fireman\u2019s Fund to receive the approval of the Commissioner before returning to the Commonwealth. He ruled that the agreement\u2019s meaning also could be \u201cdetermined from the evidence pertaining to events surrounding the negotiation and execution of the settlement agreement.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b377-5\">The Commissioner ruled that Fireman\u2019s Fund exercises pervasive control over Warner\u2019s operation, and that any insurance sold by Warner inures to the direct benefit of Fireman\u2019s Fund, and that \u201cFireman\u2019s Fund is effectively issuing and selling insurance policies in Massachusetts in a manner which violates the Settlement Agreement.\u201d He concluded that, because the Commissioner had not given approval for Fireman\u2019s Fund\u2019s acquisition and operation of Warner, this constituted a breach of the settlement agreement, as well as the covenant of good faith and fair dealing implied in the agreement by law. Finally, he concluded that this breach of the settlement agreement constituted a violation of G. L. c. 175, \u00a7\u00a7 5 and 22H, requiring revocation of Warner\u2019s license to write insurance in the Commonwealth.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b377-6\">On June 30, 1989, pursuant to G. L. c. 175, \u00a7 5, Warner commenced the present action for review of the Commissioner\u2019s decision by a single justice of this court.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> On July 18, the single justice stayed revocation of Warner\u2019s license pending determination of the case and reserved and reported the case without decision to the full court.</p>\n<p id=\"b377-7\">Relying on Federal cases, Warner asserts that jurisdiction to interpret the settlement agreement and adjudicate the breach of contract claim lay in the Superior Court and not in the Commissioner\u2019s own administrative proceeding, because <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"360\">*360</page-number>that court retained inherent \u201cauthority over the underlying claim and [had] discretion to reopen the claim or to adjudicate and enforce its settlement remedy\u201d pursuant to . Mass. R. Civ. P. 60 (b) (6), 365 Mass. 828, 829 (1974). See, e.g., <em>Dankese </em>v. <em>Defense Logistics Agency, </em>693 F.2d 13, 16 (1st Cir. 1982); <em>Aro Corp. </em>v. <em>Allied Witan Co., </em>531 F.2d 1368, 1371 (6th Cir.), cert, denied, 429 U.S. 862 (1976); <em>Kelly </em>v. <em>Green, </em>334 F.2d 434, 436-437 (3d Cir. 1964). But see <em>Fairfax Countywide Citizens Ass\u2019n </em>v. <em>County of Fairfax, </em>571 F.2d 1299, 1306 (4th Cir.), cert, denied, 439 U.S. 1047 (1978), finding \u201cno independent basis for asserting jurisdiction over the contract dispute.\u201d Warner\u2019s reliance on these cases is unnecessary. The Massachusetts Superior Court is a court of general jurisdiction. It exercises original jurisdiction over all civil actions, except those of which other courts have exclusive jurisdiction, G. L. c. 212, \u00a7 4, and shares general equity jurisdiction with this court pursuant to G. L. c. 214, \u00a7 1. The Superior Court has jurisdiction over a contract dispute and, therefore, resort to the same jurisdictional principles employed by Federal decisions is not required. Cf. <em>Fairfax Countywide Citizens Ass\u2019n, supra </em>at 1304. In sum, the Superior Court is the appropriate forum to interpret and adjudicate a complaint alleging breach of contract.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b378-5\">The insurance statutes do not give the Commissioner authority to make a binding interpretation of a contract to which he is a party or to determine conclusively whether the other party has violated that contract. Cf. <em>Nelson </em>v. <em>Blue Shield of Mass., Inc., </em>377 Mass. 746, 753 (1979) (finding <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"361\">*361</page-number>authority to interpret a contract between two private parties where contract claim \u201camount [s] to an attack on the entire, system by which Blue Shield compensates participating physicians,\u201d a matter \u201cpeculiarly within the [Commissioner\u2019s] specialized field\u201d). General contract questions are not \u201cwithin the specialized expertise of the Commissioner. Indeed, . . . they lie within the specialized expertise of courts, straightforward breach of contract claims being part of a court\u2019s daily routine.\u201d <em>Lapierre </em>v. <em>Maryland Casualty Co., </em>14 Mass. App. Ct. 248, 250 (1982).</p>\n<p id=\"b379-5\">The Superior Court also has authority to make binding declarations of legal relations under contracts, including the determination of any question of construction or validity of a contract, see G. L. c. 231 A, \u00a7\u00a7 1 and 2; <em>School Comm. of Cambridge </em>v. <em>Superintendent of Schools of Cambridge, </em>320 Mass. 516, 520 (1946), or to order specific performance. See, e.g., <em>Sanford </em>v. <em>Boston Edison Co., </em>316 Mass. 631, 634 (1944).</p>\n<p id=\"b379-6\">We shall leave to the Superior Court, in the first instance, the determination whether Fireman\u2019s Fund violated the settlement agreement when it purchased Warner. If there was no violation, the revocation of Warner\u2019s license was not proper. If there was a violation, the Superior Court judge might conclude that the proper remedy for that violation is that Fireman\u2019s Fund must sell Warner or that the Commissioner\u2019s revocation of Warner\u2019s license was appropriate. The interests of any third parties may be relevant in selecting a remedy. If revocation was appropriate, the Commissioner has ample statutory authority to enforce the remedy. See G. L. c. 175, \u00a7\u00a7 5 and 22H, and G. L. c 176D.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> See also <em>Gordon </em>v. <em>Hardware Mut. Casualty Co., </em>361 Mass. 582, 584-586 (1972). In deciding whether Fireman\u2019s Fund violated the settlement agreement, the judge will have to determine whether any obligation on Fireman\u2019s Fund not to re<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"362\">*362</page-number>turn to Massachusetts by purchase of Warner, or some other licensed insurer not writing motor vehicle liability insurance, should be inferred.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> Fireman\u2019s Fund made no explicit undertaking in the settlement agreement not to return to Massachusetts. The conversations between Joseph Brown of Fireman\u2019s Fund and the Commissioner may not be relevant to the issue of an implied agreement not to return as of right. Perhaps evidence of the conversations is not admissible because the agreement states that it \u201crepresents the full and entire agreement between the parties, superseding any other prior or contemporaneous written or oral agreements or understandings\u201d (with an exception that seems irrelevant). The conversations may, in any event, have simply left the issue unresolved, with neither Fireman\u2019s Fund nor the Commissioner accepting the position of the other. On the other hand, there may have been a mutual understanding concerning Fireman\u2019s Fund\u2019s return to Massachusetts inherent in the settlement agreement because of Fireman\u2019s Fund\u2019s departure from the Commonwealth pursuant to that agreement.</p>\n<p id=\"b380-4\">The Commissioner\u2019s decision is set aside and the case is remanded to the single justice there to be transferred to the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"363\">*363</page-number>Superior Court for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b381-5\">\n<em>So ordered.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b372-16\"> The term \u201cCommissioner\u201d refers to the Commissioner of the Division of Insurance, acting through any of his personnel, including the first deputy commissioner. During the underlying administrative proceeding, the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"355\">*355</page-number>Commissioner\u2019s post became vacant. Acting- pursuant to G. L. c. 268A, \u00a7 6, the Governor assigned all nonministerial responsibilities of the Commissioner to the first deputy until such time as a new Commissioner was sworn in. The first deputy conducted the administrative hearing and issued the decision revoking Warner\u2019s license. The first deputy has been named as a party because Warner\u2019s appeal to the Commissioner under G. L. c. 26, \u00a7 7, was denied on the ground that the first deputy had been assigned the duties of the Commissioner, and that the decision was effectively that of the Commissioner. The parties agree that, for the purposes of this appeal, the decision is a final decision of the Commissioner.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b373-8\"> Fireman\u2019s Fund Insurance Companies licensed to write commercial insurance in Massachusetts prior to November 13, 1987, were Fireman\u2019s Fund Insurance Company (FFIC) and six of its wholly-owned subsidiaries: the American Insurance Company, Associated Indemnity Corporation, National Surety Corporation (NSC), American Automobile Insurance Company, Interstate Indemnity Company, and Chicago Insurance Company. Collectively, all seven are referred to as \u201cFireman\u2019s Fund.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b373-9\">In addition, one insurer under common ownership with Fireman\u2019s Fund was authorized to engage in the reinsurance business under G. L. c. 175, \u00a7 20 (1988 ed.), and another wrote surplus lines as provided by G. L. c. 175, \u00a7 168.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b374-6\"> CAR is the statutory mechanism which guarantees the availability of motor vehicle insurance coverage to high risk applicants who are unable to obtain coverage in the voluntary market. See G. L. c. 175, \u00a7 113H (1988 ed.), and Plan and Rules of Operation of CAR. All insurance companies writing motor vehicle insurance in Massachusetts are members of CAR and approximately twenty companies, representing approximately 90% of the motor vehicle insurance market are appointed by CAR as servicing carriers. A servicing carrier must issue motor vehicle insurance to virtually all applicants and then may cede undesirable high risk policies to CAR, where premiums, losses, and expenses are shared by all CAR members. American Insurance Company, a subsidiary of FFIC and party to the settlement agreement, served as a servicing carrier in 1984.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b377-8\"> The Commissioner found it unnecessary to decide whether Warner engaged in unfair or deceptive acts or practices under G. L. c. 176D, \u00a7\u00a7 6 and 7, because the same remedy for violation of those sections \u2014 revocation of Warner\u2019s license \u2014 was warranted by Warner\u2019s violation of G. L. c. 175, \u00a7\u00a7 5 and 22H.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b377-13\"> Pursuant to G. L. c. 30A, \u00a7 14, Fireman\u2019s Fund has appealed the decision to the Superior Court. See Fireman\u2019s Fund Ins. Co. vs. Commissioner of Ins., Superior Court, Suffolk Co., CA No. 89-4342 (1989).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b378-6\"> Warner argues that the settlement agreement is,a consent decree or \u201cconsent arrangement\u201d and must be strictly construed on the terms within the four corners of the document. We do not agree. Nothing in the record suggests that the trial court adjudicating the 1987 action incorporated the settlement agreement into its judgment of dismissal or any other order. See, e.g., <em>Loring v. Morse, </em>332 Mass. 57 (1954). Cf. <em>Moore </em>v. <em>Moore, </em>389 Mass. 21 (1983). Thus, the settlement agreement is a private contract \u201cdistinct from the claim giving rise to the original litigation,\u201d <em>Fairfax Countywide Citizens Ass\u2019n, supra </em>at 1305. Cf. <em>Peters </em>v. <em>Wallach, </em>366 Mass. 622, 628 (1975) (unexecuted settlement agreement enforceable as a contract), and its construction is governed by general contract law.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b379-7\"> Generally, the Commissioner has the authority to conduct adjudicatory hearings and to order the revocation or suspension of licenses issued by the Division of Insurance. See G. L. c. 175, \u00a7\u00a7 5 and 22H, and G. L. c. 176D, \u00a7\u00a7 6 and 7.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"9\">\n<p id=\"b380-5\"> \u201cThe agreement is to be read \u2018in a manner to give effect to the chief design to be accomplished by the instrument,\u2019 and [courts] are to look \u2018through the form to the substance and purpose of the agreement\u2019 and to mould the decree \u2018in accordance with what the parties may fairly be presumed to have intended.

The Superior Court\u2019s function is to give the contract a construction that is reasonable, equitable, and expresses the intent of the parties. <em>Glick </em>v. <em>Greenleaf, </em>383 Mass. 290, 296 (1981); <em>Kerrigan </em>v. <em>Boston, </em>361 Mass. 24, 33 (1972); <em>Martino </em>v. <em>First Nat\u2019l Bank of Boston, </em>361 Mass. 325, 332 (1972); <em>Maxwell-Davis, Inc. </em>v. <em>Hooper, </em>317 Mass. 149, 152 (1944); <em>Clark </em>v. <em>State St. Trust Co., </em>270 Mass. 140, 153 (1930).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"10\">\n<p id=\"b381-6\"> The stay issued by the single justice of this court is extended for twenty-one days after the date of the issuance of the rescript herein to give Warner an opportunity to seek a stay from the Superior Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b381-7\">In the Superior Court, a determination should be by the judge whether this matter should be joined with the complaint by Fireman\u2019s Fund Ins.
