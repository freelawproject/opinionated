At the conclusion of the prosecution\u2019s evidence, the trial judge granted the defendant\u2019s motion for a required finding of not guilty as to so much of the indictment as charged murder in the first degree. The judge allowed the jury to consider whether the defendant should be convicted of murder in the second degree or manslaughter. The jury were unable to agree upon a verdict, and a mistrial was declared. When the Commonwealth announced its intention to seek an immediate retrial, the defendant moved to dismiss the indictment on the ground that the prosecution\u2019s evidence at the trial was legally insufficient to warrant his conviction of murder in the second degree or manslaughter. The judge <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"175\">*175</page-number>denied the motion to dismiss. He also denied a motion filed by the defendant to stay further proceedings in the Superior Court pending appellate review of his claim that double jeopardy principles barred retrial.</p>\n<p id=\"b193-5\">The defendant next sought relief before a single justice of this court by means of a petition under G. L. c. 211, \u00a7 3 (1988 ed.). The petition asked that proceedings below be stayed temporarily and that the Superior Court be directed to enter findings of not guilty on any charges that the defendant would face at retrial. The petition was not accompanied by a trial transcript which was, and still is, unavailable. However, in support of the petition, the defendant filed an extensive memorandum of law which contained a recital of the evidence presented by the Commonwealth in its case against him and which argued the merits of his petition on the double jeopardy claim. The single justice denied the petition without a hearing. The defendant has appealed.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b193-6\">A criminal defendant who raises a double jeopardy claim of substantial merit is entitled to review of the claim before he is retried. <em>Costarelli </em>v. Commonwealth, 374 Mass. 677, 680 (1978). The request for review is initiated by a petition to a single justice pursuant to the provisions of G. L. c. 211, \u00a7 3. <em>Id. Fadden </em>v. Commonwealth, 376 Mass. 604, 606 (1978). Utilization of that procedure applies to a properly preserved double jeopardy claim that involves contentions by the defendant that the Commonwealth\u2019s evidence was legally insufficient to warrant his conviction at trial, and, as a consequence, that his retrial is prohibited.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"176\">*176</page-number><em>Ginnetti, </em>400 Mass. 181, 182-183 (1987); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Chatfield-Taylor, </em>399 Mass. 1, 2-3 (1987); <em>Berry </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>393 Mass. 793, 794 (1985). The defendant correctly points out that his protection against double jeopardy in these circumstances is a guaranty against twice being placed on trial for the same offense. See <em>Berry </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, supra </em>at 798; <em>Costarelli </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, supra.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b194-5\">The defendant now asserts that he is not seeking review in this appeal of the merits of his double jeopardy claim. Instead, he argues that, given the importance of his right to be. protected against double jeopardy, meaningful review of the claim only can be had on a complete trial transcript. As that transcript will not be prepared in the foreseeable future,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> he <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"177\">*177</page-number>insists that a stay of the proceedings in the Superior Court is mandated. We do not agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b195-5\">The question before us is whether the single justice acted properly in denying the defendant\u2019s petition. The answer to that question depends on whether the record furnished the single justice with a basis to make an intelligent decision whether the Commonwealth had presented sufficient evidence to warrant submission of the case to the jury. If the record indicates that the Commonwealth did present sufficient evidence, the defendant\u2019s double jeopardy claim would necessarily lack merit, and the single justice\u2019s order would be correct.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b195-6\">We conclude that the extensive statement of the Commonwealth\u2019s evidence set forth in the memorandum of law presented to the single justice by the defendant, containing, as it does, the defendant\u2019s own acknowledgement of the prosecution\u2019s evidence against him, furnished a sufficient basis for the single justice to decide the petition.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> According to that statement the Commonwealth\u2019s evidence was as follows.</p>\n<p id=\"b196-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"178\">*178</page-number>The victim died, according to expert medical testimony, of \u201cblunt force trauma,\u201d intentionally inflicted by either a man or a woman. On the day of the incident, according to the defendant\u2019s statement to the police, the defendant had sole custody of the child from 2 p.m. until 11:30 p.m., when the child\u2019s mother returned home from work. He stated that he fed the child a bottle of milk at around 6 p.m. He further stated that he and the child\u2019s mother discovered the child dead at 7:05 the following morning. Later that day, an autopsy disclosed twenty-five milliliters of white liquid in the child\u2019s stomach. According to expert medical testimony, a living child\u2019s stomach would absorb liquid within two to four hours after ingestion, but death would stop the absorption process.</p>\n<p id=\"b196-5\">A medical expert testified that, to a reasonable degree of medical certainty, the victim died between 8:30 p.m. and 4:30 a.m. Within that range, based on the victim\u2019s body temperature and the state of rigor mortis, the expert stated that 12:30 a.m. was the most likely time of death. Based on cell organization activity at the site of the injury, the expert also stated that the period between injury and death was no more than two or three hours.</p>\n<p id=\"b196-6\">The defendant argued in the Superior Court that the Commonwealth\u2019s evidence failed to distinguish adequately between the fatal injury occurring prior to 11:30 p.m. (when he had sole custody of the victim), or after 11:30 p.m. (when the victim\u2019s mother was home). In his view, the identity of the person responsible for the trauma that caused death was left to conjecture.</p>\n<p id=\"b196-7\">We conclude that a reasonable juror could have found that the victim died within four hours of her last feeding and, further, that the last feeding was the last stated feeding, the feeding at 6 p.m. So finding, that juror could further reasona<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"179\">*179</page-number>bly conclude that the victim died before 11:30 p.m. and, a fortiori, that she was fatally injured sometime before that hour. That conclusion puts the time of death well within the range established by the expert testimony, and, at the same time, would rule out as a practical matter the victim\u2019s mother as the agent of harm. We conclude also that, based on the testimony that the fatal injury was intentionally inflicted, a reasonable juror could find the requisite malice to warrant the defendant\u2019s conviction of murder in the second degree. Similarly, on the stated evidence, the question of involuntary manslaughter was also properly reserved for the jury to decide. We are satisfied that the single justice responded to the claim as precisely put before him by the defendant and had an appropriate factual basis to resolve that claim.</p>\n<p id=\"A7C\">\n<em>Order of the single justice affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b193-7\"> Subsequently, the defendant filed a second petition with the full court seeking a stay of the retrial. That petition was referred to another single justice who denied the petition by an order which reads as follows:</p>\n<p id=\"b193-8\">\u201cAfter hearing, and in light of the court\u2019s review of the evidence described by counsel, it appearing that the jury -would be warranted in returning a guilty verdict, the request for a stay of the trial is denied.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b193-9\">The defendant does not challenge this order.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b193-10\"> The review contemplated in these circumstances is review in the first instance by the single justice, who may either decide the merits of the defendant\u2019s claim or reserve and report the claim to the full court. The <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"176\">*176</page-number>decision involves a question of law. If the single justice concludes that the Commonwealth\u2019s evidence was insufficient to warrant submission of the charge against the defendant to the jury, he should direct the entry of an order dismissing .the indictment. The Commonwealth would have the right to appeal to the full court from an order dismissing the indictment. See Mass. R. Grim. P. 15 (b) (1), 378 Mass. 882 (1979); Mass. R. A. P. 1 (c) and 15 (c), 365 Mass. 844, 859 (1974). The defendant also would have the right to appeal an adverse determination by the single justice to the full court. After the single justice\u2019s decision, the defendant may request the single justice to stay proceedings in the trial court so he can pursue an appeal to the full court. If the single justice denies a stay, the defendant then could seek a stay from the full court. If the requests for a stay are not sought, or are rejected, the case would proceed to a second trial. If the defendant is convicted at the second trial, he, of course, would have the right to appellate review of the question whether a required finding of not guilty should have been entered on the Commonwealth\u2019s evidence at the first trial.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b194-8\"> At the time the single justice acted, no order to expedite preparation of the trial transcript had entered. Subsequent to the denial of the petition, the defendant\u2019s counsel moved for expedited preparation of the transcript and an order did enter in the Superior Court ordering that the transcript' be expedited \u201cto [the] extent physically possible.\u201d This qualification appears to take into account a communication by the court reporter to the associate executive secretary to the Administrative Justice of the Superior Court in which the reporter stated that it was \u201cphysically impossible\u201d to honor a request for expedition of the trial transcript because he had \u201cappeals currently pending on my desk of cases not yet transcribed dating back to April, 1988, all defendants serving time and awaiting transcripts.\u201d The defendant in this case has been admitted to bail.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b195-7\"> As a general matter, examination of a double jeopardy claim of the sort involved in this case is probably best accomplished on a transcript of the pertinent trial evidence. Despite an order for expedition of the trial transcript, it may not-be able to be prepared in time to accompany a petition under G. L. c. 211, \u00a7 3. See note 3, <em>supra. </em>In such cases, counsel can direct their attention to presenting an adequate substitute for the trial transcript, such as an agreement as to the material evidence or a statement of the evidence framed in accordance with Mass. R. A. P. 8 (c), as amended, 378 Mass. 932 (1979).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b195-8\"> The defendant\u2019s counsel assiduously insists that the merits of the double jeopardy claim should not be considered. However, once it is determined that an adequate factual record was presented to the single justice on which to examine the defendant\u2019s double jeopardy claim, then our review of the single justice\u2019s denial of the defendant\u2019s petition requires that we reach the merits of that claim on the basis of that record. The defendant\u2019s argument seeking to defer a ruling until the trial transcript is prepared appears to represent a new argument that was not made to the single justice who considered the petition. From all that appears in the materials placed before the single justice, the defendant was content on having the issue decided on the statement of the evidence submitted by him and the arguments in his memorandum of law, and he requested only a <em>temporary </em>stay of the trial proceedings presumably until the single justice had the opportunity to consider the petition further. The posture of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"178\">*178</page-number>petition left it open for the single justice to decide it on the papers. \u201cAn issue not fairly raised [in the lower court] will not be considered for the first time on appeal.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Dockham, </em>405 Mass. 618, 632-633 (1989), quoting <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Marchionda, </em>385 Mass. 238, 242 (1982).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
