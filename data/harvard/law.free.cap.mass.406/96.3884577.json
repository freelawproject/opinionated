Otherwise, there was no suggestiveness.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 363. He also found that no suggestiveness affected the identification procedures and ruled \u201cthat the Commonwealth had proved \u2018to a point beyond reasonable doubt\u2019 that the identifying witnesses were relying \u2018upon their view of the defendant on the night of the shooting.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>On remand, without further hearing, the judge found that \u201cthe identifying witnesses had the opportunity to view the defendant for a considerable period of time\u201d and that, although the defendant\u2019s glasses had become \u201ca major issue,\u201d the identification of the defendant as Davis\u2019s assailant \u201cwas primarily an eyeball identification and was not <em>wholly dependent </em>on a photographic array nor on a composite sketch\u201d (emphasis supplied).</p>\n<p id=\"b115-6\">The defendant appeals from the further findings claiming that (1) the original photographic identifications were impermissibly suggestive because both witnesses already had described the suspect as a man wearing glasses, the defendant\u2019s photograph was the only one showing a man with glasses, in a thirteen-photograph array, and both witnesses relied on the defendant\u2019s glasses in identifying him as the suspect; and (2) <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"98\">*98</page-number>the subsequent lineup and courtroom identifications should have been suppressed because the Commonwealth failed to prove by clear and convincing evidence that the subsequent identifications were based on a source independent of the suggestive array. We conclude that, based on the judge\u2019s findings, there must be a new trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b116-5\">1. <em>Suggestiveness of the photographic array. </em>\u201cPhotographic identification procedures are constitutionally invalid if the procedures were \u2018so impermissibly suggestive as to give rise to a very substantial likelihood of irreparable misidentification.\u2019 \u201d <em>Thornley I, supra </em>at 364, quoting <em>Simmons, supra </em>at 384. A motion to suppress identification is governed by a two-part analysis as set forth in <em>Botelho, supra </em>at 866-868.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The burden rests initially on the defendant to show, by a preponderance of the evidence, that considering the totality of the circumstances attending it,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> the identification was so im<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"99\">*99</page-number>permissibly or unnecessarily suggestive and conducive to irreparable misidentification as to deprive the defendant of his due process rights. <em>Botelho, supra </em>at 366-368. <em>Simmons, supra </em>at 384. If the defendant makes this showing, then there may be a \u201cper se\u201d exclusion of that identification and the prosecution may not offer the identification in evidence. <em>Botelho, supra </em>at 366. Cf. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Melvin, </em>399 Mass. 201, 207 n.10 (1987); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Mobley, </em>369 Mass. 892, 894-895 (1976).</p>\n<p id=\"b117-5\">If the defendant sustains his burden, then, in order to introduce any subsequent identifications at trial, the Commonwealth must establish by clear and convincing evidence that the later identifications were not the product of the suggestive identification and were based on a source <em>independent </em>of the initial suggestive identification. <em>Botelho, supra </em>at 866-868.</p>\n<p id=\"b117-6\">In addition to his finding that \u201cthe eyeglasses of the defendant had become a major issue in this case,\u201d the judge also found that \u201cthe identifying witnesses did not spend much time in looking at photographs, but immediately picked out [the defendant\u2019s] photograph.\u201d* <footnotemark>4</footnotemark> The findings that (1) the defendant\u2019s picture was the only one in the array with glasses; (2) the glasses were a \u201cmajor issue\u201d; and (3) the witnesses relied on the glasses in selecting the defendant\u2019s picture, warrant the conclusion that the witnesses identified <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"100\">*100</page-number>the defendant because the defendant\u2019s photograph showed him wearing glasses.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b118-5\">\u201c[W]e disapprove of an array of photographs which distinguishes one suspect from all the others on the basis of some physical characteristic.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Melvin, </em>399 Mass. 201, 207 n.10 (1987). <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Clark, </em>378 Mass. 392, 400 (1979), quoting <em>United States </em>v. <em>Magnotti, </em>454 F.2d 1140, 1142 (2d Cir. 1972) (photograph in an array may not \u201csingle out any distinguishing personal characteristics of defendant not possessed by the men in the other photographs\u201d). Cf. <em>Simmons, supra </em>at 383 (even the best arrays involve \u201csome danger [of] an incorrect identification\u201d and this danger is increased where \u201cthe photograph of a single . . . individual... is in some way emphasized\u201d). Nevertheless, identifications based on a suggestive array where only one subject is pictured with a distinctive feature are admissible if \u201cit is clear that the [witness] did <em>not </em>select the photograph on that basis\u201d (emphasis added). <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Melvin, supra </em>at 207 n.10.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> A witness\u2019s unequivocal testimony that he was <em>not </em>relying on a distinctive feature will considerably neutralize any suggestiveness in a photographic array. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Mobley, </em>369 Mass. 892, 896 (1976). The instant case is distinguishable from <em>Mobley </em>and <em>Melvin </em>in that here, both witnesses unequivocally and explicitly said that the glasses were the significant factor that they relied on in their selection of the defendant\u2019s photograph. Thus, the suggestiveness in this case was not \u201cconsiderably neutralized.\u201d <em>Mobley, supra </em>at 896. Because the witnesses selected the defendant\u2019s photograph on the basis of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"101\">*101</page-number>glasses, we conclude that the array was \u201cimpermissibly\u201d suggestive.</p>\n<p id=\"b119-5\">After a defendant proves that an initial identification was impermissibly suggestive, the Commonwealth bears the burden to prove, by clear and convincing evidence, that any subsequent identifications are based on an independent source. <em>Botelho, supra </em>at 867-868. As we noted in <em>Thornley I, supra </em>at 364, application of this test requires consideration of the five factors set forth in <em>Simmons </em>and <em>Wade. </em>The judge found that the \u201cidentification of the defendant was primarily an eyeball identification and was <em>not wholly dependent </em>on [the] photographic array\u201d (emphasis added). A finding that the lineup and courtroom identifications were \u201cnot wholly dependent\u201d on the suggestive array falls short of a determination that the identifications have an independent source. The judge\u2019s original finding that \u201cthe identifying witnesses were relying \u2018upon their view of the defendant on the night of the shooting\u2019 \u201d does not aid the Commonwealth because the judge did not conclude that the witnesses were relying solely on their view of the defendant during the crime without regard to the photographic array. Indeed, this judge\u2019s determination that the identification of the defendant was not <em>wholly dependent </em>on the photographic array suggests otherwise. Because the Commonwealth did not convince the judge that the lineup and courtroom identification were based on a source independent of the suggestive photographic identification, it was error to admit that testimony.</p>\n<p id=\"b119-6\">2. <em>Harmless error. </em>We next consider whether the constitutional errors in the present case were harmless beyond a reasonable doubt. <em>Chapman </em>v. <em>California, </em>386 U.S. 18, 24 (1967). <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Kelleher, </em>395 Mass. 821, 827 (1985). <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Garcia, </em>379 Mass. 422, 441 (1980). Whether an error is harmless depends on a host of factors, <em>Delaware </em>v. <em>Van Arsdall, </em>475 U.S. 673, 684 (1986), including whether the \u201cerroneously admitted evidence was \u2018merely cumulative\u2019 of evidence properly before the jury,\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Sinnott, </em>399 Mass. 863, 872 n.8 (1987). The essential question is whether the error had or might have <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"102\">*102</page-number>had an effect on the jury and whether the error contributed to or might have contributed to the verdict. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Marini, </em>375 Mass. 510, 520 (1978).</p>\n<p id=\"b120-5\">Applying the foregoing standard, we have no doubt that the errors here were not harmless to the defendant. The sole issue at trial was whether the defendant was mistakenly identified as the assailant. \u201cThe reasonable doubt standard is most crucial in cases where central facts (such as identity . . .) are at issue, and credibility plays a key role.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Garcia, supra </em>at 441. The evidence erroneously admitted went to the central issue in this case \u2014 the question of identification \u2014 and not to a collateral issue. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Marini, supra </em>at 521.</p>\n<p id=\"b120-6\">The Commonwealth\u2019s case consisted of evidence regarding the original description, the \u201cIdentikit\u201d composite sketch, the photographic array, the lineup, courtroom identifications, and testimony about the night in question. In an eyewitness identification case such as this, where the bulk of the trial was consumed by testimony regarding the improperly admitted identifications, we are unable to conclude that these identifications were \u201cmerely cumulative.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b120-7\">Accordingly, the judgments are reversed, the verdicts are set aside, and the case is remanded for a new trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b120-8\">\n<em>So ordered.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b115-7\"> The facts are set forth in <em>Thornley I, supra </em>at 356-358.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b116-6\"> The Commonwealth urges us to adopt <em>Manson </em>v. <em>Brathwaite, </em>432 U.S. 98 (1977), which allows the use of an out-of-court identification even where suggestive procedures have been employed, provided certain indicia of reliability exist to ensure that the identification is correct. <em>Id. </em>at 109-114. The parties and the judge tried the case on the basis that <em>Botelho, supra </em>at 865-870, was the applicable law. \u201cIn these circumstances we shall not disregard the theory of law on which the parties proceeded at trial.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Thompson, </em>382 Mass. 379, 382 (1981), and cases cited.</p>\n<p id=\"b116-7\">We note that the Commonwealth concedes that \u201c[ajpart from questions on burden of proof and quality of evidence, the <em>Brathwaite </em>focus on reliability factors and the likelihood of misidentification does not appear to be substantially different from the <em>Botelho </em>focus on whether there was an \u2018independent source\u2019 for the subsequent identification.\u201d The Commonwealth asks us to conclude that the opportunity to view during the crime was the independent source for identification. The judge did not make that finding of fact. Although the judge could have made such a finding, he did not do so. \u201c[T]he responsibility of weighing credibility and finding fact is reposed in the trial court.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Haas, </em>373 Mass. 545, 550 (1977). \u201c[It] is inappropriate to ask us to reverse a judge\u2019s findings involving credibility, since he saw the witnesses and we did not.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Murphy, </em>362 Mass. 542, 550-551 (1972) (Hennessey, J., concurring).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b116-8\"> At that point, the judge examines only the totality of the circumstances of the particular confrontation or identification itself and does not consider \u201cthe witness\u2019s entire connection with the case to determine whether the confrontation, although . . . unnecessarily suggestive, was nevertheless reliable, and therefore usable. . . <em>Botelho, supra </em>at 867. Here, for example, that the three witnesses had ample opportunity to view the two men at the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"99\">*99</page-number>bar on the night in question has no bearing on the suggestiveness of the photographic array. See <em>id. </em>Rather, such evidence, external to the array, enters into the second stage of analysis, if reached, i.e., \u201cwhether the witness\u2019s ability to identify had an independent source.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at n.5.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b117-10\"> That the glasses were \u201ca major issue\u201d is confirmed by the descriptions the witnesses gave immediately following the incident. Both described the suspect as wearing glasses. The glasses worn by the defendant in the photographic identification had metal frames resembling the glasses described by the witnesses. In addition, as we observed in <em>Thornley I, </em>the composite sketch pictured the man\u2019s glasses as a \u201cprominent feature\u201d of his appearance. <em>Thornley I, supra </em>at 364. Further, both Davis and McCarthy said that they relied on the glasses as probably the most significant factor in making their selection of the defendant\u2019s photograph.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b118-6\"> This conclusion is supported by McCarthy\u2019s testimony that, in making his selection, he \u201cpicked the one with glasses.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b118-7\"> See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Melvin, supra </em>at 207 (involving array in which the victim specifically testified that the distinguishing feature \u2014 an arm sling \u2014 played \u201cno part\u201d in his selection of defendant\u2019s photograph, which was based \u201csolely on his [original] observations\u201d of the suspect). <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Mobley, </em>369 Mass. 892, 894-895 (1976) (involving an array in which the defendant\u2019s photo was the only one showing a ski hat, where the victim testified that he was <em>not </em>looking for a hat, did not focus on it, and could not even remember which photo had the hat).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
