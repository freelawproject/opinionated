L. c. 209C,</p>\n<p id=\"b716-19\">\u00a7 5 (a) (1988 ed.). The statute bars a putative father from filing a paternity action under G. L. c. 209C, if the mother was married to another man at the time of the child\u2019s birth. See <em>C.C. </em>v. <em>A.B., ante </em>679 (1990).</p>\n<p id=\"b716-21\">The plaintiff filed two complaints against the defendant to establish his paternity and to obtain orders relative to CUS<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"699\">*699</page-number>tody, visitation, and child support. The plaintiff asserts that he is the father of two minor children born to the defendant while she was married to another man. The defendant moved to dismiss the complaints on the grounds that the plaintiff lacked standing under G. L. c. 209C, \u00a7 5 <em>(a), </em>and because he failed to join a necessary party.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The plaintiff responded asserting that G. L. c. 209C, \u00a7 5 <em>(a), </em>violates the due process and equal protection clauses of the United States Constitution. The judge denied the defendant\u2019s motion to dismiss for failure to name a necessary party. Rather than rule on the issue of the plaintiff\u2019s standing, the judge made subsidiary and ultimate findings of fact, then reserved and reported the cases to the Appeals Court pursuant to G. L. c. 215, \u00a7 13 (1988 ed.). We granted the defendant\u2019s application for direct appellate review.</p>\n<p id=\"b717-5\">The plaintiff concedes that he lacks standing to bring the actions under the statute, but urges that, as applied to him, such a result is violative of the United States Constitution. The plaintiff\u2019s argument is premised on the assumption that \u00a7 5 <em>(a) </em>bars him from seeking an adjudication of paternity pursuant to the Probate Court\u2019s equity jurisdiction. As we explained in <em>C.C. </em>v. <em>A.B., supra </em>at 682, G. L. c. 209C, \u00a7 5 <em>(a), </em>does not bar the \u00a1plaintiff from commencing a common law action for an adjudication of paternity pursuant to the Probate Court\u2019s equity jurisdiction.</p>\n<p id=\"b717-6\">Pursuant to our holding today in <em>C.C. </em>v. <em>A.B., supra </em>at 682, the plaintiff\u2019s common law right to seek an adjudication of paternity in equity is substantially equivalent to the statutory action available to others. Because the plaintiff has this substantially equivalent common law right available to him, we find it unnecessary to address the constitutionality of the statute. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Paasche, </em>391 Mass. 18, 21 (1984).</p>\n<p id=\"b717-7\">The defendant\u2019s motion to dismiss for lack of standing under G. L. c. 209C should be denied and the cases should <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"700\">*700</page-number>proceed pursuant to the Probate Court\u2019s equity jurisdiction.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> The cases are remanded to the Probate Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b718-5\">\n<em>So ordered.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b717-8\"> The defendant asserted that, pursuant to Mass. R. Dom. Rel. P. 19 (1989), the husband should have been named as a party.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b718-7\"> In this case, many facts which bear on whether a \u201csubstantial relationship\u201d exists between the plaintiff and the children remain unknown. See <em>C.C. </em>v. <em>A.B., supra </em>at 689-690 (first step in inquiry is whether there is substantial relationship between putative father and child). If a complaint is filed requesting an adjudication of paternity pursuant to the court\u2019s equity jurisdiction, the complaint must allege facts which bear on whether the plaintiff has a right to an adjudication of paternity. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b718-8\">Due to the insufficiency of the factual record, it would be inappropriate to address, at this time, the putative father\u2019s argument that the statute violates the constitutional rights of the children.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-3\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b718-6\">O\u2019Connor, J.</author>\n<p id=\"Aq6J\">(dissenting in part, with whom Lynch, J., joins). Two children are involved in this case. One was born while the mother was married to a man other than the plaintiff. The other was born two years later, and 258 days after the mother\u2019s divorce became final. Because \u201c[t]he family unit accorded traditional respect in our society\u201d does not \u201cinclude the relationship established between a married woman, her lover and their child,\u201d <em>Michael H. </em>v. <em>Gerald D., </em>109 S. Ct. 2333, 2342 n.3 (1989), the plaintiff does not have a liberty interest that constitutionally entitles him to an adjudication of paternity. The court does not suggest otherwise, but instead concludes as a matter of policy, consistent with its decision in <em>C.C. </em>v. <em>A.B., ante </em>679 (1990), that \u201cthe cases should proceed pursuant to the Probate Court\u2019s equity jurisdiction.\u201d <em>Ante </em>at 699-700. As I stated in my dissenting opinion in <em>C.C. </em>v. <em>A.B., supra, </em>I believe that the Legislature has stated the Commonwealth\u2019s policy to be that, in the circumstances of this case, a putative father lacks standing to obtain an adjudication of paternity. This court is not free to declare conflicting policy, and therefore I do not share the view that the plaintiff should be permitted to proceed further.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
