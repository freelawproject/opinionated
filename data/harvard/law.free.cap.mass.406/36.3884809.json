The MBTA sought to vacate an arbitrator\u2019s award under G. L. c. 150C, \u00a7 11 (3) (1988 ed.), asserting that the arbitrator exceeded his power in granting the award. The union counterclaimed seeking to enforce the arbitrator\u2019s award. The union also sought monetary damages and injunctive relief under 42 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1981 and 1983 (1982), against the MBTA on behalf of certain of its individual members, asserting that the MBTA\u2019s use of an affirmative action plan had violated these individuals\u2019 civil rights. Both parties moved for summary judgment. The judge granted summary judgment for the MBTA on both its claim and the union\u2019s civil rights counterclaims and ordered that the arbitrator\u2019s award be vacated. We transferred the union\u2019s appeal to this court on our own motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b55-5\">The facts are undisputed and may be summarized as follows. The MBTA \u201cmoney room\u201d is a facility designed to collect and count MBTA fare receipts and then prepare them for deposit. In 1984, police and investigators from the Attorney General\u2019s office discovered that some money room employees were stealing from the MBTA money room. These employees were arrested, convicted of larceny of MBTA property, and discharged. This event created several job vacancies in the money room.</p>\n<p id=\"b55-6\">After contracting the money room work out to private companies for a time, the MBTA approached the union about restaffing the money room. The MBTA wished to use an affirmative action plan in filling the vacancies. The union objected, stating that its collective bargaining agreement required the MBTA to fill the vacancies pursuant to a strict seniority system. The MBTA, nevertheless, filled the vacancies pursuant to its affirmative action plan.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b56-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"38\">*38</page-number>In implementing its affirmative action plan, the MBTA divided the applicant pool into three lists. One list included only females. A second list included only minority males. The third list consisted of only nonminority males. The MBTA then tested several of the most senior employees within each list to determine which employees from each list were qualifed to work in the money room. A number of employees within each list passed the test. The MBTA then filled eight of the sixteen vacancies in the money room with the eight most senior qualified employees from the nonminority male list and filled the other eight positions with four from the female list and four from the male minority list.</p>\n<p id=\"b56-5\">In October of 1985, the union presented its case as a grievance before an arbitrator asserting that its collective bargaining agreement with the MBTA required that the MBTA fill the vacancies according to strict seniority and that the MBTA\u2019s application of affirmative action principles violated this agreement. The MBTA objected to the arbitrator\u2019s authority to hear the union\u2019s grievance on the ground that its decision to fill the money room vacancies was an exercise of its \u201cinherent management right\u201d pursuant to G. L. c. 161 A, \u00a7 19 (1988 ed.) and, thus, beyond the scope of arbitration. The arbitrator ruled in favor of the union and ordered the MBTA to assign eight money room positions to the most senior qualified applicants pursuant to strict seniority. The arbitrator further directed that the MBTA pay these eight employees for all benefits lost, including back pay.</p>\n<p id=\"b56-6\">In granting the MBTA\u2019s motion for summary judgment, the judge ruled as a matter of law that (1) the decision to assign employees to the money room was an exercise of its \u201cinherent management right,\u201d pursuant to G. L. c. 161 A, \u00a7 19, and, thus, beyond the scope of arbitration; and (2) the MBTA\u2019s implementation of its affirmative action plan did not violate the union members\u2019 civil rights because the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"39\">*39</page-number>MBTA implemented the plan to meet a compelling State interest and the plan was narrowly tailored to meet that interest. Accordingly, the judge ordered that the arbitrator\u2019s award be vacated and dismissed the union\u2019s counterclaims.</p>\n<p id=\"b57-5\">On appeal, the union first asserts that the judge erred in ordering that the arbitration award be vacated. Specifically, the union argues that the arbitrator had the power to decide which sections of the collective bargaining agreement may be enforced in light of the MBTA\u2019s \u201cinherent management right\u201d under G. L. c. 161 A, \u00a7 19. The union asserts that the arbitrator properly concluded that the MBTA\u2019s decision to make the assignments in accordance with its affirmative action plan was not a matter of \u201cinherent management right\u201d under the statute. The union asserts that the judge erred in not deferring to the arbitrator\u2019s interpretation of \u201cinherent management right\u201d under the statute. Secondly, the union asserts that the judge erred in granting summary judgment in favor of the MBTA on the union\u2019s counterclaims. The union argues that the preferential assignments violated the senior white male applicants\u2019 constitutional rights in violation of 42 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1981 and 1983 (1982). We affirm the judge\u2019s grant of summary judgment in favor of the MBTA.</p>\n<p id=\"b57-6\">1. <em>The arbitration </em>award. We hold that the arbitrator exceeded his authority in making an award which purported to regulate a matter within the MBTA\u2019s \u201cinherent management right\u201d under G. L. c. 161A, \u00a7 19. \u201cAn arbitrator exceeds his authority when his award requires conduct by a public employer beyond that to which the public employer may bind itself or allow itself to be bound.\u201d <em>Local 589, Amalgamated Transit Union </em>v. <em>Massachusetts Bay Transp. Auth., </em>392 Mass. 407, 411 (1984). <em>Watertown Firefighters, Local 1347 </em>v. <em>Watertown, </em>376 Mass. 706, 715 (1978). Under G. L. c. 161 A, \u00a7 19, the MBTA may not legally enter into a collective bargaining agreement which would require it to apply a strict seniority system in filling the vacancies.</p>\n<p id=\"b57-7\">The MBTA contends that the arbitrator exceeded his authority in making the award because the award conflicts with the MBTA\u2019s exercise of its \u201cinherent management right\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"40\">*40</page-number>under G. L. c. 161 A, \u00a7 19. In arguing that the arbitrator exceeded the scope of his authority, the MBTA makes a jurisdictional challenge. See <em>Local 589, Amalgamated Transit Union, supra </em>at 410. This court may review whether the arbitrator exceeded his authority in making an award which would require the MBTA to fill the vacancies pursuant to the collective bargaining agreement. See <em>id. </em>at 410-411 (scope of arbitrator\u2019s authority always open to judicial review). Further, in determining whether the arbitrator exceeded the scope of his authority, we are not bound by the arbitrator\u2019s interpretation of G. L. c. 161 A, \u00a7 19. See <em>id. </em>at 411 (court, upon review, need not defer to arbitrator\u2019s interpretation of relevant statutes).</p>\n<p id=\"b58-4\">General Laws, c. 161 A, \u00a7 19, provides that \u201cthe directors of the MBTA shall have no authority to bargain collectively and shall have no authority to enter into collective bargaining agreements with respect to matters of \u201cinherent management right.\u201d The statute defines \u201cinherent management right\u201d as including the right <em>\u201cto direct, appoint, employ; assign and promote officers, agents and employees and to determine the standards </em>therefor.\u201d G. L. c. 161A, \u00a7 19 (z). Further, G. L. c. 161A, \u00a7 19F (8) (1988 ed.), precludes the arbitrator from considering material not subject to the collective bargaining process under G. L. c. 161 A, \u00a7 19. Thus, the MBTA\u2019s right to \u201cappoint,\u201d \u201cemploy,\u201d and \u201cassign,\u201d personnel and \u201cto determine the standards therefor,\u201d is not susceptible to collective bargaining. See <em>Local 589, Amalgamated Transit Union, supra. </em>The parties do not argue, nor do we conclude, that the Legislature intended the terms \u201cassign,\u201d \u201cemploy,\u201d or \u201cappoint\u201d to be technical terms. We therefore construe these terms according to their ordinary meaning. <em>Id. </em>at 415. To \u201cassign\u201d ordinarily means \u201cto appoint to a post or duty.\u201d Webster\u2019s Third New Int\u2019l Dictionary 132 (1961). To \u201cappoint\u201d means \u201cto assign, designate, or set apart by authority.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 105. To \u201cemploy\u201d means \u201cto use or engage the services of\u2019 or \u201cto provide with a job.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 743. We hold that the MBTA\u2019s decision to fill the vacancies in the money room was an exercise of its \u201cinherent management <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"41\">*41</page-number>right\u201d to \u201cassign,\u201d \u201cemploy,\u201d or \u201cappoint\u201d employees and to \u201cdetermine the standards therefor.\u201d Accordingly, the arbitrator\u2019s award is void to the extent that it purports to regulate the MBTA\u2019s exercise of its \u201cinherent management right\u201d under G. L. c. 161A, \u00a7 19. See <em>id. </em>at 411.</p>\n<p id=\"b59-5\">We affirm the judge\u2019s entry of summary judgment on the MBTA\u2019s claim that the arbitrator exceeded his authority under G. L. c. 150C, \u00a7 11 (3).</p>\n<p id=\"b59-6\">2. <em>The union\u2019s constitutional claims. </em>The union claims that senior qualified nonminority male employees were passed over for the money room vacancies because of their race or gender in violation of their constitutional rights under the equal protection clause of the Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The union sought both monetary damages and injunctive relief on behalf of these individual members. The Superior Court judge ruled that the affirmative action plan met the requirements of the Fourteenth Amendment. We need not reach this constitutional question. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Paasche, </em>391 Mass. 18, 21 (1984) (constitutional questions not decided unless necessary). We hold that, because the monetary claims are peculiar to the individual union members, the union lacks standing to raise their claims for monetary relief. See <em>United Auto, Aerospace &amp; Agricultural Workers </em>v. <em>Brock, 477 </em>U.S. 274, 287 (1986); <em>Worth </em>v. <em>Seldin, </em>422 U.S. 490, 515-516 (1975). Further, the union\u2019s claim for injunctive relief is moot because the MBTA stopped implementing the affirmative action plan in June, 1987, due to the reduction in racial and gender imbalance within the MBTA\u2019s workforce resulting from its affirmative action program. See <em>Finance Comm\u2019n of Boston </em>v. <em>Mayor of Boston, </em>370 Mass. 693, 696 (1976); <em>Spear </em>v. <em>Boston, </em>345 Mass. 744, 746 (1963).</p>\n<p id=\"b60-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"42\">*42</page-number>Accordingly, we affirm the Superior Court judge\u2019s dismissal of the union\u2019s claims. See <em>Breault </em>v. <em>Chairman of the Bd. of Fire Comm\u2019rs of Springfield, </em>401 Mass. 26, 34 (1987), cert, denied sub nom. <em>Forastiere </em>v. <em>Breault, </em>485 U.S. 906 (1988) (upholding judgment on different grounds from those on which judge relied).</p>\n<p id=\"b60-4\">\n<em>Judgment affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b55-7\"> After the vacancies occurred, the MBTA\u2019s director of equal employment opportunity and affirmative action conducted a utilization analysis of the work force in the money room. The analysis revealed a severe underutilization of minorities and women in the money room. The director found that only two of the money room\u2019s fifty-seven employees were members of minorities and only one was female. At the same time, 33% of the MBTA <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"38\">*38</page-number>employees in service maintenance positions (within which the money room positions were classified) were members of minorities and 12% were female. Further, 22% of the MBTA\u2019s over-all workforce were members of minorities and 11 % were female.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b59-7\"> The union brought its constitutional couterclaims pursuant to 42 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1981 and 1983 (1982). Although the union\u2019s brief is unclear and does not fully brief the issue, we assume, as did the Superior Court, that the claims are based on the equal protection clause of the Fourteenth Amendment.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
