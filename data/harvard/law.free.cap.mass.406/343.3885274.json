R. Crim. P. 15 (a) (2), 378 Mass. 882 (1979), from the order of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"344\">*344</page-number>a District Court judge suppressing evidence obtained during a drunk-driving roadblock stop of the defendant\u2019s automobile. The judge ruled that, in extending the roadblock beyond 2 A.M., the State police deviated from the specific plan which was in operation for this roadblock. In doing so, the judge concluded, the police violated the defendant\u2019s rights under the Fourth and Fourteenth Amendments to the United States Constitution, and art. 14 of the Massachusetts Declaration of Rights. We transferred the case here on our own motion and now affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b362-5\">On the night of June 12 and June 13, 1987, the State police planned and executed a roadblock, for detecting drunk drivers along a stretch of Route 18 in Abington. The defendant, Sandra M. Anderson, was arrested at the Abington roadblock at 2:15 a.m. \u2014 fifteen minutes after the termination of the roadblock authorized by State police troop commander Charles F. Henderson\u2019s plan. The various State police guidelines<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> under which the roadblock was being conducted gave officers on the scene no discretion to alter any of the details of the operations.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Under the procedure, sole authority for extending a roadblock beyond a two-hour duration was in the hands of the troop commander.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> However, the judge found that Lieutenant Edward H. Begin, the supervisor in charge on the scene, extended the roadblock from 2 a.m. to 2:30 a.m.</p>\n<p id=\"b362-6\">The motion judge concluded that by extending the roadblock hours the officer at the scene varied from the specific <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"345\">*345</page-number>plan for the roadblock in question and in so doing abridged the standards for a permissible roadblock we articulated in <em>Commonwealth </em>v. McGeoghegan, 389 Mass. 137 (1983).</p>\n<p id=\"b363-5\">1. <em>Consistency of the rulings. </em>The Commonwealth contends that the judge\u2019s findings did not warrant his conclusion that the roadblock guidelines were not followed. We do not agree. The guidelines provided that a roadblock not exceed two hours in duration unless the troop commander orders otherwise. The guidelines also provided that the procedure to be followed must be in writing and disseminated in advance. We conclude, therefore, that if the troop commander wishes to extend the duration of the roadblock, the guidelines require that he do so in writing and in advance. Even if we were to interpret the guidelines as permitting oral changes in duration on orders of the troop commander, our decision would not change. There was no evidence that the troop commander ordered the hours extended.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b363-6\">It is clear, therefore, that the judge\u2019s ruling that the police failed to comply with the established procedure is unassailable. We turn now to the effect of this failure on the constitutionality of the defendant\u2019s seizure.</p>\n<p id=\"b363-7\">2. <em>Constitutional standards. </em>It is beyond dispute, as the Commonwealth acknowledges, that the stopping of Anderson\u2019s automobile at a roadblock for a driver sobriety check is a \u201cseizure,\u201d under both the Fourth and Fourteenth \"Amendments to the United States Constitution, and art. 14 of the Massachusetts Declaration of Rights. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"346\">*346</page-number><em>Shields, </em>402 Mass. 162, 164 (1988). <em>Delaware </em>v. <em>Prouse, </em>440 U.S. 648, 653 (1979). In order to pass muster under both constitutional provisions, such a seizure must be \u201creasonable.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b364-5\">Decisions of this court and of the Supreme Court establish that, in deciding whether a seizure is \u201creasonable,\u201d we balance the public interest against the individual\u2019s right to personal security free from arbitrary interference by law enforcement officials. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Trumble, </em>396 Mass. 81, 86 (1985). <em>United States </em>v. <em>Brignoni-Ponce, </em>422 U.S. 873, 878 (1975). That balance in most cases takes its meaning from the warrant clause. \u201cIt is a cardinal principle that \u2018searches conducted outside the judicial process, without prior approval by judge or magistrate, are per se unreasonable under the Fourth Amendment \u2014 subject only to a few specifically established and well-delineated exceptions.\u2019 \u201d <em>United States </em>v. <em>Ross, </em>456 U.S. 798, 825 (1982), quoting <em>Katz </em>v. <em>United States, </em>389 U.S. 347, 351 (1967). Even in the \u201cexceptional\u201d cases where a neutral and detached magistrate has not made a finding of probable cause, <em>Delaware </em>v. <em>Prouse, supra </em>at 654 n.ll, search or seizure by the police must usually be based on the existence of facts which would allow for such a determination in order to be \u201creasonable.\u201d <em>California </em>v. <em>Carney, 471 </em>U.S. 386, 394 (1985) (while warrant was not necessary to search motor home under the \u201cautomobile exception,\u201d to meet reasonableness standard, \u201cthe search otherwise [must be such] as the magistrate could authorize\u201d). Even in cases where \u201cnecessarily swift action predicated upon the on-the-spot observations of the officer on the beat\u201d has been held to make the warrant exception and probable cause standard too exacting for practical purposes, the police have been required to \u201cpoint to specific and articulable facts\u201d in order to render a search or seizure \u201creasonable\u201d by the Fourth Amendment standards. <em>Terry </em>v. <em>Ohio, </em>392 U.S. 1, 20-21 (1968).</p>\n<p id=\"b364-6\">If \u201c[t]his demand for specificity in the information upon which police action is predicated is the central teaching of . . . Fourth Amendment jurisprudence,\u201d <em>id. </em>at 21 n.18, then <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"347\">*347</page-number>the further exception from usual Fourth Amendment demands that has been made to accommodate fixed roadblocks for detection of illegal aliens, <em>United States </em>v. <em>Martinez-Fuerte, </em>428 U.S. 543 (1976), and drunk drivers, <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>McGeoghegan, </em>389 Mass. 137 (1983), is rather exceptional and very limited. This court has carved a \u201csui generis\u201d exception for the enforcement of G. L. c. 90, \u00a7 24. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Shields, supra </em>at 167. The court has done so on the grounds that a \u201creasonable\u201d roadblock involves a \u201cminimal\u201d State intrusion upon the reduced privacy of drivers, one that is in any case outweighed by the strong public interest in reducing the carnage caused by drunk drivers. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Trumble, supra </em>at 86.</p>\n<p id=\"b365-5\">In order to assure that a roadblock seizure of a citizen without even individualized suspicion is \u201creasonable\u201d under the Fourth Amendment and art. 14 of the Declaration of Rights, the court has demanded that the roadblock meet standard, neutral guidelines, and be conducted pursuant to a plan devised in advance by law enforcement supervisory personnel. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>McGeoghegan, supra </em>at 143-144. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Amaral, </em>398 Mass. 98, 99-100 (1986).<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> This requirement is meant not only to assure the public\u2019s safety and to minimize the intimidation and surprise a driver may feel upon being asked to stop for no suspicious behavior on his or her part. More importantly, it also aims to remove the invasion of the driver\u2019s reasonable expectation of privacy from \u201cthe discretion of the official in the field.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Shields, supra </em>at 165, quoting <em>Camara </em>v. <em>Municipal Court of San Francisco, </em>387 U.S. 523, 532 (1967).</p>\n<p id=\"b365-6\"><em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Trumble, supra, </em>involved the very same Department of Public Safety and State police regulatory system under which the Abington roadblock of June 12 and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"348\">*348</page-number>June 13, 1987, was planned to operate. These guidelines, the judge concluded, were \u201centirely responsive\u201d to the \u201csubstitute\u201d standard for constitutional \u201creasonableness\u201d in the unique roadblock seizure context that we had articulated in <em>McGeoghegan. Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Trumble, supra </em>at 91. Having found \u201cnothing\u201d in the statement of agreed facts of how that particular roadblock was carried out \u201cto indicate that the guidelines were not carefully followed,\u201d <em>id., </em>the court ruled the roadblock seizure to be \u201creasonable.\u201d Since <em>Trumble, </em>the constitutionality of such roadblocks under the Fourth and Fourteenth Amendments and under the adequate and independent State constitutional ground of arts. 12 and 14 has been measured by the officers\u2019 compliance with these guidelines. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Shields, supra </em>at 164-165 (\u201cwhere the Commonwealth shows a roadblock employed to enforce c. 90, \u00a7 24, was operated in accordance with the established guidelines, the accompanying seizures, although not conducted on the basis of individualized suspicion, are reasonable under the Fourth Amendment and art. 14\u201d); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Amaral, supra </em>at 100 (\u201croadblocks stand or fall based on some set of neutral criteria governing the officers in the field,\u201d quoting <em>State </em>v. <em>Jones, </em>483 So. 2d 433, 438 [Fla. 1986], in which that court required a written set of uniform guidelines be followed to render a roadblock stop constitutional).</p>\n<p id=\"b366-5\">Once the Department of Public Safety and the State police have adopted such standard, written guidelines for the conduct of roadblocks, which have been accepted as a sufficient substitute for the usual Fourth Amendment \u201creasonableness\u201d demands, it follows that the Commonwealth must carefully comply with them. In order that the privacy interests of the motoring public under the Fourth Amendment and art. 14 be given fair weight in the unique balance that has been struck in favor of roadblock stops without individualized suspicion, it is imperative that the Commonwealth follow its own rules for meeting what the court has recognized as a sui generis interpretation of the reasonableness requirement. We note <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"349\">*349</page-number>that the roadblock guidelines purport to hold law enforcement officers to a standard of strict compliance.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b367-5\">The Commonwealth argues here that our constitutional standard for a \u201creasonable\u201d roadblock seizure is one of \u201csubstantial compliance,\u201d<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> allowing for reasonable deviations by police in conducting a given roadblock for any number of practical factors that might arise on a given evening. It contends therefore that the motion judge erred in holding that the extension of the Abington roadblock beyond the time limit delineated in the written plan rendered the roadblock seizure of the defendant unreasonable. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b367-6\">Adherence to a neutrally devised, preplanned blueprint in order to eliminate arbitrariness and discretion has been this court\u2019s principal prerequisite for abandoning the requirement of individualized suspicion in roadblock stops. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Shields, </em>supra at 165. In <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Amaral, supra </em>at 100, we noted with approval the position of other courts that control over the discretion of officers in the field is the key constitutional requirement. <em>People </em>v. <em>Bartley, </em>109 Ill. 2d 273, 289 (1985), cert, denied sub nom. <em>Bartley </em>v. <em>Illinois, </em>475 U.S. 1068 (1986). In <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Trumble, supra </em>at 90, it was stressed that the officers at the scene were instructed that no deviation from the procedures set forth in the guidelines would be permitted. In <em>Common</em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"350\">*350</page-number><em>wealth </em>v. <em>McGeoghegan, supra </em>at 143, we stated that, in a constitutionally reasonable roadblock, \u201cassurance must be given that the procedure is being conducted pursuant to a plan devised by law enforcement supervisory personnel.\u201d To allow the Commonwealth to do anything short of complying in full with its own guidelines would inject an element of discretion into the roadblock procedures and thus undercut the very foundation upon which the roadblock seizure is constitutionally justified.</p>\n<p id=\"b368-5\">This court has also specifically pointed to the importance of the requirement that the \u201croadblock be planned in advance by supervisory personnel [and such] plans must include \u2018date, location, <em>time, duration, </em>and set patterns of cars to be stopped\u2019 \u201d (emphasis added). <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Trumble, supra </em>at 89. As we have noted, the department\u2019s own procedure requires that the plans be in writing and disseminated prior to implementation. See section 5 of the procedure. We conclude, therefore, that the Commonwealth must adhere to the requirements of its own guidelines for establishing the duration of a roadblock in order that the possibility of arbitrariness and discretion of the officers in the field be eliminated.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b368-6\">Finally, we are not convinced it is accurate to describe the seizure of this defendant fifteen minutes after a roadblock was supposed to have ended as having \u201csubstantially complied\u201d with the Commonwealth\u2019s roadblock guidelines. The very fact that the Commonwealth can assume, for argument\u2019s sake, that the extension of the roadblock was unauthorized, and then dismiss as insubstantial this deviation from its own guidelines underscores further the need for a standard more meaningful than \u201csubstantial compliance\u201d to protect constitutional rights.</p>\n<p id=\"b368-7\">The Commonwealth argues that, even if the continuation of the Abington roadblock past 2 a.m. had been unautho<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"351\">*351</page-number>rized, the motion judge\u2019s findings that all other aspects of guidelines were adhered to means the police substantially complied with their written orders. The fact of the matter is that, but for the order to extend the roadblock, Sandra Anderson could not have been lawfully seized without probable cause as she drove along Route 18 at 2:15 a.m. The \u201cinsubstantial\u201d deviation of a fifteen to thirty minute extension in duration was actually the difference between <em>a </em>roadblock \u2014 and the sui generis departure from the limits on the Commonwealth\u2019s ability to intrude on a driver\u2019s privacy it represents \u2014 and <em>no </em>roadblock. If such a deviation was unauthorized, then we have a case not of \u201csubstantial compliance\u201d with official guidelines and constitutional demands, but of no compliance at all.</p>\n<p id=\"b369-5\">Since the Commonwealth\u2019s guidelines regulating roadblocks have been held to supply the \u201creasonableness\u201d in these seizures that lack the usual probable cause or individualized suspicion requirements which ordinarily safeguard citizens from arbitrary government intrusion, we believe the fairest course is to require the Commonwealth to follow its own rules.</p>\n<p id=\"b369-6\">The judge\u2019s allowance of the defendant\u2019s motion to suppress is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b369-7\">\n<em>So ordered.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b362-7\"> The Commonwealth\u2019s \u201cguidelines\u201d governing drunk-driving roadblocks consist of the Department of Public Safety\u2019s Drunk Driving Roadblock Enforcement Procedure and Policy; the State police troop commander\u2019s written plan for each particular roadblock, and the written duty assignment sheets delegating specific tasks to each officer participating in the roadblock. We refer to them collectively as guidelines.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b362-8\"> With respect to the other main aspects of the roadblock\u2019s execution \u2014 lighting, notice to the public, which cars and how many were stopped prior to 2 a.m., care for the safety of the public and manner of addressing drivers at each stop \u2014 the judge found this standard was met.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b362-9\"> Section 10(c)(2) of the procedure states: \u201cDuration of the roadblock will not exceed two hours unless the troop commander orders otherwise.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b363-8\"> The only evidence offered by the Commonwealth on the issue whether Lieutenant Begin, the officer in charge, was authorized to extend the duration of the roadblock from 2 a.m. to 2:30 a.m. was the oral testimony of the lieutenant himself. Over the course of his testimony the officer gave three different accounts of how the order to continue the Abington roadblock past 2 a.m. came to be given. He testified first, that he had discretion to order roadblocks to continue beyond the end time stated in the written plans, and that he regularly ordered such deviations from plans; second, that the troop commander contacted him by telephone before the start of this roadblock and authorized him to extend the roadblock as circumstances warranted; and finally, that the troop commander himself in that phone call authorized an extension of the roadblock to 2:30 a.m.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b365-7\"> In the circumstances of an inventory search, where there is some probable cause or articulable suspicion for the original State law enforcement intrusion upon a citizen\u2019s privacy, the court has required written, standard police policies and procedures for \u201creasonableness,\u201d and has held a search in violation of those standard policies to abridge at least art. 14. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Bishop, </em>402 Mass. 449 (1988).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b367-7\"> The written State police duty assignment sheets distributed prior to the execution of a roadblock to the officers who will be participating state that \u201ccompliance with the following orders for each post will be strictly observed.\u201d In particular, part of the duties of the officer in charge of the detail is to insure \u201cthat strict compliance with written Policy and Procedure, and the Guidelines established by the Commissioner of Public Safety be adhered to.\u201d Initial point officers in charge are required to \u201cinsure that strict compliance with written Policy, Procedure and Guidelines is maintained.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b367-8\"> The Commonwealth draws this language from the wording of the certified questions posed to us in <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Trumble, supra </em>at 83, where we were asked whether the roadblock at issue was \u201cexecuted in substantial compliance with the guidelines promulgated by the Secretary of Public Safety.\u201d As we have already observed, <em>supra, </em>in <em>Trumble </em>there was no departure at all from (and hence, strict compliance with) the guidelines for executing roadblocks.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b368-8\"> Since this case was argued, the Appeals Court decided <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Cameron, </em>27 Mass.

To the extent that the views in <em>Cameron </em>are inconsistent with those expressed here, we decline to follow them.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"concurrence\">\n<author id=\"b369-8\">Liacos, C.J.</author>\n<p id=\"A8g\">(concurring). I write separately to reiterate my concern that this court, when faced with a challenge to an automobile roadblock, has allowed itself to be drawn away from the consideration of basic constitutional principles regarding search and seizure law. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Shields, </em>402 Mass. 162, 169 (1988) (Liacos, J., dissenting). Rather than assess whether a roadblock seizure is permissible according to the traditional considerations of probable cause or reasonable and articulable suspicion, this court has chosen to engage in a balancing of the public interest involved in a drunk-driving roadblock against an individual\u2019s right to be</p>\n<p id=\"b370-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"352\">*352</page-number>free from arbitrary interference with his personal security. <em>Id. </em>at 172. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Trumble, </em>396 Mass. 81, 86 (1985). In the process, this court has lost sight of the \u201cfundamental principles of the jurisprudence of search and seizure law under both Federal and State Constitutions,\u201d <em>Shields, supra </em>at 169, thereby putting at risk an individual\u2019s right to be free from unreasonable searches and seizures. It is my opinion that we should refocus the roadblock debate and base our decisions as to the reasonableness of roadblock seizures on the existence of probable cause and reasonable or articulable suspicion. However, for the purposes of the present case, I accept, as I must, the court\u2019s current analysis of roadblock seizures.</p>\n<p id=\"b370-5\">I am gratified by the court\u2019s insistence on strict adherence by the law enforcement authorities to a roadblock plan devised in advance of the roadblock. This standard of compliance will provide some minimal protection to an individual\u2019s right to personal security, while the reasonable substantial compliance standard urged by the dissent would increase greatly the risk of unreasonable seizures by individual police officers in the field. Indeed, under the reasonable substantial compliance standard as envisaged by the dissent, police officers at the scene could choose to continue a roadblock indefinitely, regardless of the duration set down in the roadblock plan, so long as the extended roadblock was operated in the same manner as it had been for the period of time authorized by the plan. Such a standard goes too far in subjecting a motorist\u2019s right of personal security to the discretion of the official in the field. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Shields, supra </em>at 165. Accordingly, I concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-3\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b370-6\">Nolan, J.</author>\n<p id=\"Agd\">(dissenting). I dissent. In reaching its result, the court elevates form to a triumphant height, leaving substance to stare upward in utter disbelief. The substantive issue is not whether the police strictly complied with the guidelines they devised, but whether the deviation from the guidelines was of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"353\">*353</page-number>such a nature or degree that the roadblock, as implemented, was \u201cunreasonable.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b371-5\">The deviation in this case was \u201cde minimis.\u201d It is difficult to understand how the State trooper\u2019s failure to obtain permission from the troop commander to extend the roadblock a half hour somehow violated the defendant\u2019s right to be free from unreasonable searches and seizures. The roadblock was in effect pursuant to a devised plan that was not arbitrary and which assured motorists\u2019 safety and convenience. The fact that the roadblock lasted longer than authorized does not somehow change the nature of the roadblock. In this case, the State police established a roadblock in which they: (1) did not arbitrarily stop cars; (2) observed the public safety at all times; (3) performed in such a manner that the stops were brief, and took only seconds; and (4) ensured that no motorist was inconvenienced during the roadblock. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>McGeoghegan, </em>389 Mass. 137, 143 (1983). Further, the State police devised a plan which enabled them to carry out the roadblock in the reasonable manner outlined above. The State police substantially complied with this plan except that the roadblock was in place a half hour longer than the plan authorized. The roadblock in place at 2:15 a.m., when the defendant\u2019s vehicle was stopped, however, was the same roadblock that had been in place at 2 a.m. There is no evidence that the State police treated motorists stopped at 2:15 a.m. any differently than they had treated motorists stopped at 2 a.m. Nevertheless, those intoxicated motorists who drove by the roadblock after 2 a.m. are shielded from prosecution simply by their late arrival. The court\u2019s application of strict compliance in this case is superficial and woodenly technical. Unlike Cinderella\u2019s coach, the roadblock did not turn into a pumpkin at 2 a.m. The nature of the roadblock and the plan under which it was implemented remained the same and the drunk drivers who were driving at 2:15 a.m. were as blameworthy as those who were driving fifteen minutes earlier. They should be held just as responsible.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
