In arriving at the additional assessment, the Commissioner used the \u201cunitary business\u201d approach. The taxpayer paid the additional assessment on August 11, 1983. On December 11, 1984, this court decided in <em>Polaroid Corp. </em>v. <em>Commissioner of Revenue, </em>393 Mass. 490 (1984), that the unitary business approach as it had been implemented by the Commissioner was unlawful. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"467\">*467</page-number>Seven months later, on July 23, 1985, after the time allowed by G. L. c. 62C, \u00a7 37, to apply to the Commissioner for an abatement had expired, the taxpayer filed such an application. In its application, the taxpayer challenged the unitary method the Commissioner had employed in assessing the taxpayer\u2019s 1980 excise. The Commissioner denied the application as untimely. The taxpayer then appealed to the Appellate Tax Board (board).</p>\n<p id=\"b485-5\">The board recognized that the taxpayer had not filed an application for abatement within the time limits prescribed by G. L. c. 62C, \u00a7 37. Nonetheless, the board concluded that the payment of the assessed tax was an \u201coverpayment\u201d within the meaning of G. L. c. 62C, \u00a7 36, which, under that section, the taxpayer was entitled to have refunded without an abatement application and regardless of the passage of time. Furthermore, the board concluded, the Commissioner has \u201cinherent power\u201d to refund taxes assessed unlawfully, regardless of whether a timely abatement application has been filed. The Commissioner appealed to the Appeals Court. We transferred the case here on our own initiative, and now reverse the board\u2019s decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b485-6\">General Laws c. 62C, \u00a7 37, provides with respect to abatement proceedings that \u201c[a]ny person aggrieved by the assessment of a tax . . . may apply in writing to the commissioner, on a form approved by him, for an abatement thereof\u2019 within prescribed time limits. Section 39 then provides that \u201c[a]ny person aggrieved by the refusal of the commissioner to abate a tax, in whole or in part, may appeal therefrom . . . by filing a petition with the clerk of the appellate tax board. If, on hearing, the board . . . finds that the person making the appeal was entitled to an abatement, it shall make such abatement as it sees fit.\u201d Pursuant to \u00a7 41, \u201c[t]he remedies provided by section thirty-seven to forty, inclusive, shall be exclusive, whether or not the tax is wholly illegal.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b485-7\">\u201cSince the remedy by abatement is created by statute the [board] has no jurisdiction to entertain proceedings for relief by abatement begun at a later time or prosecuted in a different manner than is prescribed by the statute.\u201d- <em>Assessors of </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"468\">*468</page-number><em>Boston </em>v. <em>Suffolk Law School, </em>295 Mass. 489, 492 (1936). <em>Commissioner of Revenue </em>v. <em>Pat\u2019s Super Market, Inc., </em>387 Mass. 309, 311 (1982). By the terms of \u00a7 39, the board had jurisdiction to \u201cmake such abatement as it [saw] fit,\u201d only if the board were to find that the taxpayer \u201cwas entitled to an abatement\u201d from the Commissioner. Because the taxpayer failed to file a timely abatement application, the taxpayer was not entitled to an abatement from the Commissioner. Therefore, the board lacked jurisdiction to grant an abatement.</p>\n<p id=\"b486-5\">The fact is that the board did not purport to grant an abatement. Rather, the board reasoned that, even though it was conducting a \u00a7 39 review and the taxpayer had failed to file a timely abatement application, it could grant relief to the taxpayer from the Commissioner\u2019s failure to grant a refund under \u00a7 36, which does not require the filing of an application within a prescribed period. We do not agree with the board\u2019s reasoning.</p>\n<p id=\"b486-6\">Section 36 provides in significant part as follows: \u201cIf, on the verification of a return or otherwise, the commissioner determines that an overpayment of the full amount of any tax, and interest and penalties thereon, due with respect to such return has been made by the taxpayer, the amount of such overpayment may, in his discretion, be deducted from any unpaid amounts of any other taxes due from the taxpayer. The balance of such overpayment shall be refunded to the taxpayer . . . .\u201d Nothing in \u00a7 36 suggests that the Commissioner\u2019s failure to refund under that section is subject to review by the board. Furthermore, nothing in \u00a7 39 or elsewhere in c. 62C, or in c. 5 8A, \u00a7 6 (jurisdiction of Appellate Tax Board), grants that authority. Section 39 is the source of the board\u2019s authority to \u201cmake such abatement as it sees fit\u201d to any appellant \u201centitled to an abatement,\u201d but it is silent with respect to the board\u2019s jurisdiction to correct perceived errors under \u00a7 36. We hold that the board exceeded its juris<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"469\">*469</page-number>diction in determining that the taxpayer was entitled to a refund of an overpayment under \u00a7 36.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b487-5\">The board\u2019s decision was predicated not only on G. L. c. 62C, \u00a7 36, but also on its reasoning that \u201c[t]he Commissioner has the inherent power to refund or abate an illegally assessed tax even if an Application for Abatement is not timely filed.\u201d We need not consider whether the Commissioner has such power because, even if he had it, he did not exercise it. The existence of such an unexercised power in the Commissioner would not justify the board\u2019s determination that a refund or abatement was required.</p>\n<p id=\"b487-6\">Finally, we address the taxpayer\u2019s argument based on principles of estoppel. After this court decided <em>Polaroid Corp. </em>v. <em>Commissioner of Revenue, supra, </em>the Commissioner publicly announced that he intended to grant refunds expeditiously to taxpayers who had been assessed taxes based on the unitary business approach. The gist of the taxpayer\u2019s argument on appeal is that the Commissioner\u2019s public statements \u201cinduced [the taxpayer] to proceed informally\u201d rather than to follow statutorily required procedures. We reject that argument. Nothing in the record demonstrates that the Commissioner publicly suggested that taxpayers could obtain refunds without filing abatement applications. In fact, the record contains the board\u2019s finding that the Department of Revenue had informed the taxpayer in a letter dated February 22, 1985, four months before the c. 62C, \u00a7 37, abatement application deadline, that it had not yet received \u201cclaims for abatement relative to the unitary assessments for tax years 1980 and 1981,\u201d and that it \u201cwould appreciate your expeditious filing of those abatements.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b488-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"470\">*470</page-number>The board\u2019s decision is reversed, and the case is remanded to the board for dismissal of the appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b488-5\">\n<em>So ordered.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b487-7\"> Parenthetically, we observe, without deciding, that, even if the board were to have jurisdiction to review \u00a7 36 decisions of the Commissioner, the taxpayer in this case would probably not be able to establish an overpayment without showing that it had paid more than it was assessed. In this case, the taxpayer was assessed $177,316 plus interest, and it paid that amount. Therefore, there seems to have been no overpayment in the \u00a7 36 sense.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
