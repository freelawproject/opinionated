L. c. 90, \u00a7 24, as amended through St. 1984, c. 189, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"858\">*858</page-number>\u00a7 65, and was sentenced as a first offender pursuant to G. L. c. 90, \u00a7 24D, as appearing in St. 1982, c. 373, \u00a7 16. On November 13, 1987, the plaintiff was again convicted of O.U.I. after a District Court trial. Although the complaint has not been reproduced in the record appendix, the parties seem to assume, as do we, that the complaint described the alleged offense as a second offense. The plaintiff (defendant in the criminal case) appealed to a jury of six and pleaded guilty \u201cto as much of [the] complaint [as] allege [d] 1st offense.\u201d The judge then accepted the plea and proceeded as if the plaintiff had just been convicted of O.U.I. for the first time. He sentenced the plaintiff to one year of probation, ordered completion of an alcohol rehabilitation program, and ordered suspension of the plaintiff\u2019s license for ninety days.</p>\n<p id=\"b876-5\">When the ninety-day suspension expired, the plaintiff sought to retrieve his license from the registrar of motor vehicles. The registrar refused, relying on G. L. c. 90, \u00a7 24 (1988 ed.), which provides for a two-year license revocation for those who have been convicted twice of O.U.I. within a six-year period. The plaintiff appealed to the defendant Board of Appeal on Motor Vehicle Liability Policies and Bonds (board), and a hearing was held. The board affirmed the registrar\u2019s decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b876-6\">The plaintiff obtained judicial review in the Superior Court under G. L. c. 30A, \u00a7 14 (1988 ed.). Both parties filed motions for summary judgment. A judge denied the plaintiff\u2019s motion, allowed the board\u2019s motion, and ordered that the plaintiff\u2019s complaint be dismissed. The plaintiff appealed. We transferred the appeal from the Appeals Court to this court on our own initiative. We now affirm the judgment below.</p>\n<p id=\"b876-7\">General Laws c. 90, \u00a7 24 (1) <em>(a) </em>(1), provides mandatory minimum sentences for O.U.I. Under \u00a7 24 (1) (b), a conviction under \u00a7 24 (1) (a) (1), except for certain first offenders, results in the automatic revocation of the defendant\u2019s driver\u2019s license. The length of the revocation period is mandated by \u00a7 24 (1) (c) (l)-(3 <em>Vi) </em>and depends on the number of the defendant\u2019s prior offenses. The revocation period for a second <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"859\">*859</page-number>offender is two years. G. L. c. 90, \u00a7 24 (1) (c) (2) (1988 ed.). There is one exception to these mandatory license revocation procedures, namely the provision in c. 90, \u00a7 24D, relative to first offenders. That section provides: \u201cAny person convicted of or charged with [O.U.I.], may, if he consents, be placed on probation for not more than two years and shall, as a condition of probation, be assigned to a driver alcohol education program as provided herein and, if deemed necessary by the court, to an alcohol treatment or rehabilitation program or to both, and the person\u2019s license or right to operate shall be suspended for a period of no less than forty-five nor more than ninety days .... <em>The provisions of this section shall not apply to any person convicted or assigned to an alcohol education or rehabilitation program because of a like offense by a court of the commonwealth within a period of six years preceding the date of the commission of the offense with which he is charged . </em>. .\u201d (emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b877-5\">By virtue of the last quoted sentence, \u00a7 24D does not apply to this case because the plaintiff had been convicted of a \u201clike offense\u201d within six years.</p>\n<p id=\"b877-6\">Instead, c. 90, \u00a7 24 (1) (c) (2), applies. It provides: \u201cWhere the license or the right to operate of a person has been revoked under paragraph <em>(b) </em>[as here] and such person has been previously convicted of ... a like violation within a period of six years preceding the date of the commission of the offense for which such person has been convicted [as here], the registrar shall not restore the license or reinstate the right to operate of such person unless the prosecution of such person has terminated in favor of the defendant, until two years after the date of the conviction . . . .\u201d The board\u2019s conclusion that the registrar properly refused to restore the plaintiff\u2019s license at the expiration of the ninety-day suspension period ordered by the judge was correct.</p>\n<p id=\"b877-7\">The plaintiff argues that, under \u00a7 24 (1) (c) (2), the appropriate revocation period was not two years because the Commonwealth\u2019s O.U.I. case against him had \u201cterminated in [his] favor,\u201d that is, the judge\u2019s acceptance of his plea of guilty \u201cto as much of [the] complaint [as] allege [d] 1st of<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"860\">*860</page-number>fense\u201d established that the offense for which he was convicted was a first offense. Thus, says the plaintiff, the provisions of \u00a7 24D, including suspension of license for forty-five to ninety days, were available to him. We disagree. A \u201ccomplaint [of O.U.I.] should set forth any former conviction that may be relied on to justify greater punishment on conviction . . . [but] [a] prior offense is not part of the crime charged; it relates only to punishment. ... A defendant, if convicted of a charge, will be entitled to a separate trial on the issue whether he had been convicted of a prior, like offense. G. L. c. 278, \u00a7 11 A.\u201d (Citations omitted.) <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Murphy, </em>389 Mass. 316, 320-321 (1983). By accepting the guilty plea, the judge did not pass on the question whether the offense was a first or second offense.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The registrar, then, was free to conclude that the most recent conviction was for a second, like offense within a six-year period.</p>\n<p id=\"b878-5\">The plaintiff argues that, even if the judge was in error in ordering suspension of the plaintiffs license for only ninety days, \u201cthe Registrar is not empowered to change the sentence.\u201d The short answer to that argument is that, in carrying out his statutory duty, the registrar has not purported to change the sentence. The sentence remains intact. The two-year revocation is in effect pursuant to statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b878-6\">Finally, the plaintiff argues that the existence of a plea agreement calling for a ninety-day license suspension required the registrar to restore the plaintiffs license after the expiration of that period. It is entirely clear that no agreement between the prosecutor and the plaintiff could require the registrar to ignore his statutory duty. See <em>Dunbrack </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>398 Mass. 502, 505 (1986). Of course, if the plaintiff wishes to challenge the validity of the guilty plea <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"861\">*861</page-number>as predicated on an unfulfilled agreement, he is free to move for a new trial. <em>Id. </em>at 504.</p>\n<p id=\"b879-4\">\n<em>Judgment affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b878-7\">We intend no suggestion concerning whether, if the prior offense were indeed an element of the crime charged, the acceptance of a plea of guilty \u201cto as much of [the] complaint [as] allege [d] 1st offense\u201d would establish that the O.U.I. offense was a first offense.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
