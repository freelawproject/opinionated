(Adams-Russell), authorizing it to construct and operate a cable television system in the town. That license, which took the form of a bilaterally negotiated contract, contains a rate freeze provision providing as follows: \u201cThe Licensee [Adams-Russell] agrees that it will not change the schedule of monthly rates for all cable and pay TV services for at least twenty-four (24) months after the cable system is initially fully constructed and energized.\u201d<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b623-6\">The event underlying the town\u2019s complaint in this case occurred in August, 1985, when Adams-Russell announced a rate increase on its \u201cSupercable\u201d service, effective on September 1, 1985.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> It is undisputed that Adams-Russell had not, and in fact still has not, completed construction of the cable system in accordance with the requirements set forth in the license.</p>\n<p id=\"b623-7\">In August, 1985, the town and its board of selectmen filed a two-count complaint against Adams-Russell in the Superior Court. Count one alleged that Adams-Russell had violated the rate freeze provision in the license agreement by raising its rates prematurely. Count two alleged that this rate increase also constituted an unfair or deceptive business practice in violation of G. L. c. 93A, \u00a7 11 (1988 ed.).</p>\n<p id=\"b623-8\">On November 17, 1986, a judge sitting in the Superior Court allowed the town\u2019s motion for summary judgment on count 1, but deferred any ruling on the proper remedy under that count or on liability under count 2. Adams-Russell appealed. In <em>Norwood </em>v. <em>Adams-Russell Co., </em>401 Mass. 677 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"606\">*606</page-number>(1988) <em>(Norwood I), </em>we affirmed the grant of partial summary judgment for the town. In reaching this decision, we rejected Adams-RusselPs argument that the Cable Communications Policy Act of 1984, 47 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 521-559 (Supp. Ill 1984) (Cable Act), preempted the rate freeze provision to the extent of rendering Adams-Russell\u2019s September 1, 1985, rate increase legal. The pertinent part of the Cable Act permits a franchising authority, such as the town, to regulate the rates for \u201cbasic cable service,\u201d but only until December 29, 1986. See 47 U.S.C. \u00a7 543(c)(1).<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Any other type of rate regulation is prohibited. See 47 U.S.C. \u00a7 543(a). We concluded that Adams-Russell\u2019s Supercable tier constituted \u201cbasic cable service,\u201d and thus could be regulated by the town, pursuant to \u00a7 543(c)(1) of the Cable Act, until December 29, 1986. See <em>Norwood </em>/, <em>supra </em>at 684. Since the proposed rate increase occurred before that date, and violated the terms of the license agreement, we affirmed the Superior Court\u2019s judgment and remanded the case to that court for \u201cfurther proceedings consistent with this opinion.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 686.</p>\n<p id=\"b624-5\">On remand, the town moved for an appropriate remedy under count 1 and for summary judgment on count 2 (c. 93A claim). Furthermore, the town moved to amend both counts of its complaint to account for a second rate increase effective July 1, 1988. Adams-Russell sought to confine recovery under count 1 to damages incurred prior to December 29, 1986,<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> filed a cross motion for summary judgment on count 2, and opposed the motion to amend the complaint.</p>\n<p id=\"b624-6\">On November 17, 1988, a judge in the Superior Court agreed with Adams-Russell\u2019s position. The judge concluded that the case was an appropriate one for summary judgment, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"607\">*607</page-number>but that the town\u2019s remedy under count 1 was limited to losses incurred prior to December 29, 1986. Accordingly, the judge determined that Adams-Russell was required to refund the rate increases charged between September 1, 1985, and December 29, 1986, and denied the town\u2019s motion to amend its complaint to include the July 1, 1988, rate increase. The judge also decided that the town could not maintain its action under G. L. c. 93A, \u00a7 11, and thus granted summary judgment for Adams-Russell on count 2 of the complaint. The town has appealed from the judgment entered pursuant to the judge\u2019s memorandum. We granted the town\u2019s motion for direct appellate review, and now affirm the judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b625-5\">1. <em>Preemption and the contract claim. </em>We first take up the issue of whether the Cable Act preempts the town\u2019s ability to enforce the rate freeze provision in the contract beyond December 29, 1986. In determining whether the rate freeze provision of the franchise agreement between the town and Adams-Russell is preempted by the Cable Act, we inquire whether Congress intended such preemption to occur. See <em>Cablevision of Boston Ltd. Partnership </em>v. <em>Flynn, </em>710 F. Supp. 23, 26 (D. Mass. 1989), affd per curiam, 889 F.2d 337 (1st Cir. 1989); <em>New York </em>v. <em>FCC, </em>814 F.2d 720, 724 (D.C. Cir. 1987), affd, 486 U.S. 57 (1988). Our inquiry on this point is resolved by the plain language of the statute: \u201cExcept as provided in section 557 of this title . . . any provision of any franchise granted by [a franchising] authority, which is inconsistent with this chapter shall be deemed to be preempted and superseded.\u201d 47 U.S.C. \u00a7 556(c).<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> Section 557 in turn provides that provisions of licenses which predated the enactment of the Cable Act shall remain in effect \u201csubject to the express provisions of this subchapter.\u201d 47 U.S.C. \u00a7 557(a). The Cable Act preempts only those franchise provisions which are inconsistent with its terms, and has been so interpreted by other courts which have addressed this issue. See <em>Cablevision of Boston Ltd. Partner</em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"608\">*608</page-number><em>ship </em>v. <em>Flynn, supra </em>at 28. See also <em>Housatonic Cable Vision </em>v. <em>Department of Pub. Util., </em>622 F. Supp. 798, 806 (D. Conn. 1985); <em>Dubuque </em>v. <em>Group W Cable, Inc., </em>No. C 85-1046 (N.D. Iowa June 18, 1986). The rate freeze provision will conflict with the Cable Act, and thus be preempted thereby, only if the provision \u201cstands as an obstacle to the accomplishment and execution of the full purposes and objectives of Congress.\u201d <em>Jones </em>v. <em>Rath Packing Co., </em>430 U.S. 519, 526 (1977).</p>\n<p id=\"b626-4\">Adams-Russell contends that the rate freeze provision conflicts, within the meaning of the <em>Jones </em>decision, <em>supra, </em>with \u00a7 543 of the Cable Act. That section provides, in pertinent part, that \u201c[a]ny franchising authority may regulate the rates for the provision of cable service . . . but only to the extent provided under this section.\u201d 47 U.S.C. \u00a7 543(a). Thus, a franchising authority may not regulate rates unless an express exception is provided for in \u00a7 543 of the Cable Act. See <em>Dubuque </em>v. <em>Group W Cable, Inc., supra. </em>Section 543 provides for two such exceptions; a franchising authority: (1) may \u201cregulate rates for the provision of basic cable service in circumstances in which a cable system is not subject to effective competition,\u201d \u00a7 543(b); and (2) may enforce franchise provisions regulating basic cable service which antedate the enactment of the Cable Act for a two-year period following that enactment, \u00a7 543(c)(1).<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b626-5\">Adams-Russell argues that the town cannot avail itself of the first exception because the town\u2019s cable system is subject to effective competition. Furthermore, argues Adams-Russell, while the second provision does permit the town to enforce the rate freeze, that permission extends only until the expiration of the two-year grandfather clause period \u2014 which ended on December 29, 1986. Thus, Adams-Russell contends that any attempt to enforce that provision beyond December <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"609\">*609</page-number>29, 1986, conflicts with the Cable Act and consequently is preempted.</p>\n<p id=\"b627-5\">The town, on the other hand, maintains that to enforce the rate freeze provision is not to \u201cregulate rates\u201d within the meaning of the Cable Act, and thus is not covered by the Act\u2019s preemption provisions. In support of this position, the town relies on the facts that the rate freeze provision (1) was enacted through bilateral contract negotiations rather than as a unilateral ordinance; (2) is time limited rather than permanent; and (3) was initially proposed by Adams-Russell rather than by the town. The town apparently concedes, as it must, that, if the rate freeze provision constitutes \u201cregulation,\u201d it cannot be enforced beyond December 29, 1986.</p>\n<p id=\"b627-6\">While clearly prohibiting certain rate regulation by franchising authorities, the Cable Act does not define the term \u201cregulation.\u201d We therefore must examine the Act\u2019s legislative history to determine what meaning Congress attached to that term. A convenient starting point in this analysis is the problem that prompted the Cable Act\u2019s enactment: \u201cFaced with stiff competition for franchises, some cable operators simply overpromised and oversold in the franchise process.\u201d H.R. Rep. No. 934, 98th Cong., 2d Sess. 21, reprinted in 1984 U.S. Code Cong. &amp; Admin. News 4655, 4658. As a result of this overreaching, recognized Congress, \u201c[t]he past two to four years have shown that, in many instances, the terms of the urban franchises may be beyond the point of economic viability. ... In major cities across the country, cable operators have soon after the grant of a franchise turned to the city with requests to reduce channel capacity from that bid in the franchising process, cut back on the services provided, reduce public access facilities, increase rates and slow down the timetable for construction.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 4658-4659. The resolution of this problem in the franchising process is expressly identified as a \u201csignificant purpose\u201d for passing the Cable Act. <em>Id. </em>at 4659.</p>\n<p id=\"b627-7\">The specific solution legislated in the Cable Act is deregulation. With the discrete exceptions noted above, cable rates are to be determined by the forces of marketplace compet\u00ed<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"610\">*610</page-number>tian rather than by municipal fiat, bilateral contract, or any other nonmarket mechanism. See <em>id. </em>at 4662 (\u201cThe [House Energy and Commerce] Committee believes that the availability of competing sources of programming in a given market will keep the rates for basic cable services reasonable in that market without the need for regulation. A franchising authority should be granted authority to regulate rates for basic cable service only in circumstances in which a cable system is not subject to effective competition\u201d); S. Rep. No. 67, 98th Cong., 1st Sess. 23 (\u201cThe [Senate Committee on Commerce, Science, and Transportation] firmly believes in encouraging competition and in not imposing any regulation where marketplace forces are better able to insure innovation, diversity, and efficiency. ... [I] t is the intent of this committee that [telecommunications] services, when offered over a cable system, shall be free of any governmental regulation or restriction\u201d). This congressional intent is clearly reflected in the Cable Act itself. After the two-year grandfather period has elapsed, the sole basis upon which franchising authorities may regulate basic cable service is the absence of effective competition in the marketplace. See 47 U.S.C. \u00a7 543; <em>Westwood </em>v. <em>Adams-Russell Co., </em>24 Mass. App. Ct. 914, 916 (1987).</p>\n<p id=\"b628-5\">The interpretation of the term \u201cregulation\u201d proposed by the town is in direct conflict with the unambiguous, pro-competitive intent manifested in the Cable Act. The town\u2019s attempt to enforce its rate freeze provision beyond December 29, 1986, has the pronounced effect of perpetuating the problem Congress set out to resolve in the Cable Act \u2014 the setting of rates through the often economically unviable franchise process. Were we to adopt the town\u2019s position, we would be insulating the basic cable rates in that town from market competition, and for a potentially indefinite term.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> Such an interpretation would run directly counter to both <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"611\">*611</page-number>congressional intent and the express language of the Cable Act.</p>\n<p id=\"b629-5\">Our conclusion on this point is reinforced by the complete absence in either the language or the legislative history of the Cable Act of evidence which supports the town\u2019s attempt to remove its bilaterally negotiated rate freeze provision from the Act\u2019s proscription of \u201cregulation.\u201d On the contrary, the language of the Cable Act indicates that Congress fully intended the Cable Act\u2019s reach to extend to rate regulation taking the form of a contract. The Act defines the term \u201cfranchise\u201d as \u201can initial authorization . . . issued by a franchising authority, whether such authorization is designated as a franchise, permit, license, resolution, <em>contract, </em>certificate, agreement, or otherwise, which authorizes the construction or operation of a cable system\u201d 47 U.S.C. \u00a7 522(8) (emphasis added). Congress thus was clearly aware that rate regulations in cable television franchises sometimes take the form of contractual provisions. Yet nowhere did Congress indicate that the effects of such rate regulations were any less pernicious simply because they were drafted as terms of a contract rather than as local ordinances, or any other type of unilaterally imposed regulation. Having reviewed the terms of the Cable Act, as well as its legislative history, we are convinced that Congress did not intend to draw any distinction between the various technical forms a rate regulation might take. In fact, ascribing to Congress any such intent would be simultaneously to ascribe to it an intent to permit the circumvention of the Cable Act itself. As the Supreme Court of Vermont has astutely noted, a franchising authority \u201ccannot avoid the Act\u2019s clear prohibitions of regulation by arguing that it achieved rate control only through \u2018proprietary\u2019 means. Otherwise, governmental subdivisions could use threats of market competition to obtain de facto rate regulation through contractual settlements, thus avoiding the dictates of the Act.\u201d<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> <em>Burlington </em>v. <em>Mountain Cable Co., </em>559 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"612\">*612</page-number>A.2d 153, 156 n.4 (Vt. 1988), cert, denied, 109 S. Ct. 3245 (1989).</p>\n<p id=\"b630-5\">We conclude that the rate freeze provision contained in the franchise contract between Norwood and Adams-Russell is a \u201cregulation\u201d within the meaning of \u00a7 543 of the Cable Act.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> The fact that the freeze takes the form of a bilateral, time-limited contract provision rather than of a unilateral, permanent ordinance is irrelevant. Both types of restrictions frustrate the purposes of the Cable Act equally, and are <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"613\">*613</page-number>therefore equally preempted thereby.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> The town may not enforce the rate freeze provision after December 29, 1986.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b631-5\">2. <em>The G. L. c. 93A claim. </em>We assume, without deciding, that the town in these circumstances has standing to sue under G. L. c. 93A, \u00a7 11. The foregoing discussion makes <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"614\">*614</page-number>clear that Adams-Russell has committed no violation of G.

That amendment, proposed by Senator Lloyd Bentsen, read as follows: \u201cNotwithstanding any other provision of this Act, the provisions of this Act shall not be applicable to any franchise in effect on the date immediately preceding the date of the enactment of this Act.\u201d 129 Cong. Rec. S8275 (daily ed. June 13, 1983). Two aspects of this proposed amendment firmly convince us that the town\u2019s position cannot be correct. First, Senator Bentsen expressly stated that contractual rate freeze provisions \u2014 precisely what the town seeks to enforce here \u2014 could not be enforced absent the amendment. See <em>id. </em>at S8276 (statement of Sen. Bentsen) (\u201cThe city of Fort Worth, for example, negotiated a contract which called for the regulation of the first three tiers of service. <em>S.66, if enacted in its present form, would allow the cable company which wired Fort Worth the next day to raise the rates for the second two tiers of service. </em>I repeat: that is just not right.\u201d) (Emphasis added.) The Senator further noted that \u201cS.66, in spite of many other good provisions, in this situation <em>represents a Congressional nullification of contractual obligations and </em>commitments\u201d <em>id. </em>(emphasis added). Second, the proposed amendment was emphatically rejected. Senator Robert Packwood argued that \u201cthis amendment does one thing, [i]t guts the agreement in the bill between the National League of Cities and the cable television industry.\" 129 Cong. Rec. S8295-S8296 (daily ed. June 14, 1983). Senator Barry Goldwater\u2019s objection was similarly vehement: \u201cIf this amendment is taken, there is no need for a cable bill. ... It would frustrate the principal goal of establishing a uniform policy for cable.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at S8296. The amendment was subsequently defeated in the Senate by a vote of seventy-nine to nineteen. See <em>id. </em>Any hope the town might have had of prevailing on this issue died with the Bentsen amendment.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"10\">\n<p id=\"b630-7\"> In view of our rejection of the town\u2019s theory on the basis of the Act\u2019s legislative history, we are not persuaded by the town\u2019s arguments premised on secondary sources, such as the state of cable television regulation and decisions of the Federal Communications Commission at the time of the Act\u2019s enactment.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"11\">\n<p id=\"b631-6\"> This conclusion is consistent with that reached by the Supreme Court of Vermont in <em>Burlington </em>v. <em>Mountain Cable Co., </em>599 A.2d 153, 155 (Vt. 1988) (enforcement of contractual rate freeze provision \u201cwould offend one of the essential purposes of the [Cable] Act\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b631-7\">The town has brought to our attention the decision of the United States Court of Appeals for the First Circuit in <em>Nashoba Communications Ltd. Partnership No. 7 </em>v. <em>Danvers, </em>893 F.2d 435 (1st Cir. 1990) and argues that the decision supports its position in the case. We do not agree. First, the court in <em>Danvers </em>decided only a narrow threshold jurisdictional issue, whether the District Court had Federal question jurisdiction to grant a declaratory judgment that Danvers\u2019 threatened State court action to enforce a rate freeze was preempted by the Cable Act. In deciding that such jurisdiction was absent, the First Circuit expressly recognized that State courts can decide Federal statutory questions of preemption. The First Circuit also recognized that the preemption issue in the case before it was an anticipatory defense to a State court contract action, and the First Circuit, accordingly, did not purport to pass on the merits of the defense. Thus, the language in <em>Danvers </em>on whether enforcement of a franchise is \u201cregulation\u201d is dictum which is irrelevant to this case. Second, we are particularly persuaded by the fate of the proposed Bentsen amendment, <em>supra </em>at note 9, that Congress indeed considered contractual rate freeze provisions, such as the one at issue in this case, to constitute \u201cregulation\u201d prohibited by the Cable Act in all but certain statutorily specified situations not applicable here.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"12\">\n<p id=\"b631-8\"> This conclusion was implicit in <em>Norwood I, supra </em>at 684, in the dispute between these two parties. We noted in that case that \u201cthe validity of Adams-Russell\u2019s claim that Congress had preempted the regulation of rates depends on whether Adams-Russell\u2019s \u2018Supercable\u2019 tier constitutes \u2018basic cable service, including multiple tiers of basic cable service.\u2019 \u201d This passage illustrates that the answer to the question whether Adams-Russell\u2019s Supercable tier constituted \u201cbasic cable service\u201d within the meaning of the Cable Act would be dispositive of the preemption issue. In other words, if Supercable constitutes \u201cbasic cable service,\u201d the franchise provision purporting to freeze Supercable rates is preempted by the Cable Act and therefore must constitute \u201cregulation.\u201d This point is further evinced by our conclusion that \u201c[u]nder the grandfather clause of the Cable Act, the town was able to regulate the rates for the Supercable tier until December 29, 1986 . . . .\u201d <em>Id. </em>Not only did we expressly refer to the town\u2019s ability to \u201cregulate the rates,\u201d but we also based this statement on the authority conferred in the grandfather clause, 47 U.S.C. \u00a7 543(c)(1), which is entirely inapposite unless rate regulation is involved.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"13\">\n<p id=\"b632-5\"> Section 552(c) of the Cable Act, which deals with consumer protection laws, provides as follows: \u201cNothing in this subchapter shall be construed to prohibit any State or any franchising authority from enacting or enforcing any consumer protection law, <em>to the extent not inconsistent with this sub-chapter\u201d </em>(emphasis added). The meaning of the italicized language is clearly indicated in the legislative history discussing that section of the Cable Act. \u201cA state or franchising authority may not, for instance, regulate the rates for cable service in violation of [\u00a7 543], and attempt to justify such regulation as a \u2018consumer protection\u2019 measure.\u201d H.R.
