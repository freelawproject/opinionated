See G. L. c. 90, \u00a7 24 (1) (a) (1) (1988 ed.).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"636\">*636</page-number>The operation of \u201ca motor vehicle while under the influence of intoxicating liquor\u201d is punishable as a crime only if it occurs \u201cupon any way or in any place to which the public has a right of access, or upon any way or in any place to which members of the public have access as invitees or licensees.\u201d G. L. c. 90, \u00a7 24 (1) (a) (1). The complaint charged the defendant with operating \u201cunder the influence of intoxicating liquor, upon a certain public way, or place to which the public has a right of access as invitees or licensees, to wit, West Junior High [School in Brockton].\u201d The defendant drove his truck on the baseball field at West Junior High School. At trial, the parties agreed and the jurors were instructed that the baseball field was not, as a matter of law, a public way.</p>\n<p id=\"b654-5\">The defendant claims that the judge erred in denying his pretrial motion to dismiss and his motion for a required finding of not guilty,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> which renewed the claim made in the pretrial motion that there was no evidence he operated a motor vehicle on a, \u201cplace to which members of the public have access as invitees or licensees.\u201d<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> See G. L. c. 90, \u00a7 24 (1) (a) (l).<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> We transferred the case to this court on our own <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"637\">*637</page-number>motion. We read G. L. c. 90, \u00a7 24 (1) (a) (1), as reaching only those places to which members of the public have a right of access by motor vehicle or access as invitees or licensees by motor vehicle. Cf. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Endicott, </em>17 Mass. App. Ct. 1025, 1026 (1984) (Brown, J., concurring) (G. L. c. 90, \u00a7 24 [G], \u201creaches incidents occasioned <em>by motor vehicles </em>on this particular beach property\u201d [emphasis supplied]). Because the baseball field was not a place to which the public has a right of access by motor vehicle, we conclude that there was insufficient evidence to warrant submission of the case to the jury. We reverse the judgment, set aside the verdict, and remand the case for entry of a judgment of acquittal.</p>\n<p id=\"b655-4\">In reviewing the sufficiency of the evidence, we consider \u201cwhether the Commonwealth produced enough evidence, taken in the light most favorable to the Commonwealth, to satisfy any rational trier of fact beyond a reasonable doubt, that each element of the crime was present.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Hilton, </em>398 Mass. 63, 64 (1986). <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Latimore, </em>378 Mass. 671, 677-678 (1979). We summarize the pertinent portions of the evidence presented to the jury.</p>\n<p id=\"b655-5\">On the evening of July 7, 1986, the defendant and a female companion, now his wife, purchased a six-pack of beer. She drove the defendant\u2019s pick-up truck to Brockton\u2019s West Junior High School where she parked the truck on the grass in centerfield of the school\u2019s baseball field. The couple consumed several bottles of beer. At approximately 11 p.m., while making a routine patrol through the school parking lot, Officer James Snyder of the Brockton police department observed the defendant\u2019s truck parked on the field. Officer Snyder drove onto the field via a dirt and gravel path which connects the parking lot with the field. The defendant was sitting in the truck\u2019s driver\u2019s seat. After a brief conversation, Officer Snyder told them to leave the area. The officer then drove away. As the defendant began to drive from the baseball field, he made a sharp turn on the damp grass, which caused the truck to roll over, landing on the driver\u2019s side.</p>\n<p id=\"b656-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"638\">*638</page-number>At approximately 11:10 p.m., Brockton police officer Michael Dadak observed the defendant\u2019s overturned truck on the field, with the defendant still behind the steering wheel. The defendant climbed out of the truck, carrying a brown paper bag, which he tossed away from the truck. Officer Dadak retrieved the bag and found that it contained beer bottles. The defendant admitted to Officer Dadak that he had driven the truck on the grass field. The defendant submitted to two field sobriety tests which, in Officer Dadak\u2019s opinion, he failed. The defendant was arrested for violation of G. L. c. 90, \u00a7 24 (1) (a) (1), as well as other charges not before us. See note 1, <em>supra.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b656-5\">Chapter 90, \u00a7\u00a7 1 through 34Q, generally regulates motor vehicles and the operation of motor vehicles in the Commonwealth. \u201cThe original statute providing for punishment for operating a motor vehicle \u2018while under the influence of intoxicating liquor\u2019 . . . \u2018was passed for the protection of travellers upon highways,\u2019 \u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Connolly, </em>394 Mass. 169, 172 (1985), quoting <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Clarke, </em>254 Mass. 566, 568 (1926), \u201cand was not intended to make criminal the use of a motor vehicle in all places within the Commonwealth.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Clancy, </em>261 Mass. 345, 348 (1927). Therefore, our prior cases assume, without discussion, that the term \u201caccess,\u201d as it appears in \u00a7 24, requires inquiry whether the public has access, <em>by a motor vehicle, </em>to a particular way or place. See, e.g., <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Callahan, </em>405 Mass. 200, 202 (1989); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Paccia, </em>338 Mass. 4, 5 (1958). See also <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Hart, </em>26 Mass. App. Ct. 235 (1988); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Hazelton, </em>11 Mass. App. Ct. 899 (1980).</p>\n<p id=\"b656-6\">The baseball field is owned and maintained by the city of Brockton. During the summer, members of the public can use the field for baseball and softball games if they first obtain a permit from the city parks department. Members of the public are invited to attend these games and to park their cars in the school parking lot. Seating is provided at the field for spectators.</p>\n<p id=\"b657-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"639\">*639</page-number>The right of the public to walk, sit, or play on the grass in centerfield of this ballpark cannot reasonably be construed to include an invitation or license to operate a motor vehicle therein. \u201cIt is the status of the way, not the status of the driver, which the statute defines . . . , i.e., it is sufficient if the physical circumstances of the way are such that members of the public may reasonably conclude that it is open for travel to invitees or licensees.\u201d <em>Hart, supra </em>at 237-238. The record does not reveal any of the usual \u201cindicia of accessibility to the public,\u201d such as street lights, paving, curbing, abutting houses or businesses, crossroads, traffic, street signs, or hydrants. <em>Hart, supra </em>at 237-238, and cases cited. Thus, there is no basis for a determination that the baseball field was open for travel in an automobile.</p>\n<p id=\"b657-5\">On the contrary, the record indicates that the baseball field was not a public way or a way to which the public had a right of access as invitees or licensees. Surrounded on three sides by a golf course, the baseball field was located at the rear of the school parking lot, northwest of the school building itself. The jury could have found that, in order to enter the ballfield by motor vehicle, an operator would have to drive over a berm (curb) on the edge of the parking lot. The grass area of the field was connected to the parking lot via two separate entrances. One entrance was paved, but was blocked by a barrier that prevented entry to the field by a motor vehicle. The other was not blocked by any gate or chain, but was unpaved and intended only for use by city equipment servicing the field. Two \u201cno trespassing\u201d signs were posted on the school building, \u201c[a] couple of hundred feet\u201d from the baseball field. One read, \u201c[N]o trespassing of unauthorized personnel,<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> including motor vehicles, per order of Brockton School Department.\u201d The other sign said, \u201c[N]o cars beyond this point.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b658-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"640\">*640</page-number>The facts do not disclose any basis for a member of the public to assume reasonably he or she could properly drive a motor vehicle onto the baseball field. Because there was no evidence the defendant drove the pick-up truck on a public way, a way to which the public had a right of access, or a way to which the public had a right of access as invitees or licensees, the defendant\u2019s motion for a required finding of not guilty should have been allowed.</p>\n<p id=\"b658-4\">The judgment is reversed and the verdict set aside. The case is remanded for entry of a judgment of acquittal.</p>\n<p id=\"b658-5\">\n<em>So ordered.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b653-15\"> The defendant was convicted of operating a motor vehicle without a license in his possession. See G. L. c. 90, \u00a7 11 (1988 ed.). On appeal, the defendant neither raises nor argues any issue relating to that conviction. Therefore, any error in that conviction is deemed waived. See Mass. R. A. P. 16 (a) (4), as amended, 367 Mass. 921 (1975); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Cundriff, </em>382 Mass. 137, 150-151 n.22 (1980), cert, denied, 451 U.S. 973 (1981).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b654-6\"> At the close of the Commonwealth\u2019s case, the defendant moved for a required finding of not guilty on all complaints. See Mass. R. Crim. P. 25, as amended, 389 Mass. 1107 (1983). The judge denied the motion. At the conclusion of all the evidence, the defendant renewed this motion. The judge reserved a ruling on the motion and sent the case to the jury.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b654-7\"> Although the complaint did not include the language \u201cin any place to which the public has a right of access,\u201d G. L. c. 90, \u00a7 24 (1) (a) (1), and the offense must be proved as charged, see <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Ancillo, </em>350 Mass. 427, 430 (1966), we base our decision on whether the baseball field was a \u201cplace to which members of the public have access as invitees or licensees\u201d as well as \u201ca place to which the public has a right of access\u201d within the meaning of G. L. c. 90, \u00a7 24 (1) (a) (1).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b654-8\"> 0n appeal, the Commonwealth argues that the baseball field is a public way. We do not consider this argument separately because \u201c[tjhe theory of law on which by assent a case is tried cannot be disregarded when the case comes before an appellate court for review . . . .\u201d <em>Santa Maria </em>v. <em>Trotto, </em>297 Mass. 442, 447 (1937). See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. Fernette, 398 Mass. 658 (1986); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Thompson, </em>382 Mass. 379, 382 (1981). A police officer from Brockton stated that members of the public \u201ccan\u2019t drive on the field.\u201d We add that other facts relied on in this record by the Commonwealth do not support its new contention. See <em>infra </em>at 638-640.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b657-6\"> Any \u201cunauthorized personnel,\u201d including the defendant, who drove a motor vehicle on the field, even though it was public property, would have been a trespasser. See G. L. c. 266, \u00a7 120 (1986 ed.); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Egleson, </em>355 Mass. 259, 262-263, appeal dismissed, 395 U.S. 336 (1969).
