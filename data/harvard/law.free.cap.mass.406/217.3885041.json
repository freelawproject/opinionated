The department granted the certificate and the plaintiffs sought review under G. L. c. 25, \u00a7 5 (1988 ed.),<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> in the Supreme Judicial Court for Suffolk County. The plaintiffs claim that the department\u2019s decision in favor of T-Com was arbitrary and capricious, unsupported by substantial evidence, and therefore an abuse of its discretion, and that its denial of their request to reopen the hearings violated the department\u2019s own regulations. At the request of the parties, a single justice reserved and reported the matter to the full court without decision. We affirm the decisions of the department.</p>\n<p id=\"b236-10\">The following facts are from the department\u2019s opinion.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Two years prior to these proceedings, T-Com entered the radio paging business in Michigan. In an effort to expand out of State, the company applied to the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) for paging licenses in thirty-eight <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"219\">*219</page-number>markets nationwide. It had already secured the necessary licenses and construction permits in a number of these markets, including Springfield, when it filed with the department its application for a certificate of public convenience and necessity under G. L. c. 159, \u00a7 12B (1988 ed.). T-Com is a wholly owned subsidiary of C C &amp; S Systems, Inc., a Michigan corporation that is a holding company for a number of independent telephone companies operating in Michigan and Ohio.</p>\n<p id=\"ACy\">In June, 1985, three months after the department closed hearings in the T-Com case, and after the parties had submitted and exchanged both briefs and reply briefs, the plaintiffs moved to reopen hearings. Zachs and Airphone argued that T-Com had violated c. 159, \u00a7 12B, by proceeding, in April, 1985, after the close of hearings, with construction of its proposed Springfield radio paging facility before the department had rendered a decision on whether to grant it a certificate of public convenience and necessity. T-Com acknowledged that it had indeed begun construction. But the department found that T-Com began construction only days before its FCC construction permit \u2014 on which it had already once applied for and been granted an extension \u2014 was to expire. It also found that T-Com had not begun operations out of the facility; that it had no intention to do so until a certificate was granted; and that it would dismantle the facility in the event of a denial. On that basis, the department declined to reopen the hearings.</p>\n<p id=\"ArE\">The department then decided that T-Com had demonstrated the requisite \u201cfinancial, managerial and technical ability for certification and that the public convenience and necessity will be served by the proposed Springfield operation,\u201d and granted T-Com\u2019s application.</p>\n<p id=\"AeA8\">Our review of both of the department\u2019s decisions is governed by standards set forth in G. L. c. 30A, \u00a7 14 (7) (1988 ed.). We will uphold the department\u2019s actions unless the plaintiffs can demonstrate that they are flawed by an error of law, lack support by substantial evidence, are arbitrary or ca<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"220\">*220</page-number>pricious, or suffer from one of the other defects spelled out in \u00a7 14 (7).</p>\n<p id=\"b238-5\">1. <em>The decision to grant the certificate of public convenience and necessity. </em>In determining whether a certificate should be granted, the department looks at the applicant\u2019s managerial, financial, and technical ability to provide quality service to the public, as well as the public need for the service. 220 Code Mass. Regs. \u00a7\u00a7 35.05(2), 35.15 (1986). The plaintiffs challenge the issuance of a certificate of public convenience and necessity on three grounds: (a) the department lacked substantial evidence to make the finding of public convenience and necessity; (b) the department\u2019s equating of the standard of \u201cpublic convenience \u25a0 and necessity\u201d with \u201cpublic interest\u201d was arbitrary and capricious; and (c) the department both lacked substantial evidence and was arbitrary and capricious in deciding T-Com had the managerial, financial, and technical wherewithal to operate a mobile radio utility system in Springfield. These arguments fail for the reasons discussed below.</p>\n<p id=\"b238-6\">a. <em>Lack of evidence for finding of public convenience and necessity. </em>General Laws c. 30A, \u00a7 1 (6), defines \u201c[substantial evidence\u201d as \u201csuch evidence as a reasonable mind might accept as adequate to support a conclusion.\u201d In assessing whether \u201csubstantial evidence\u201d existed for the department\u2019s finding on public convenience and necessity, the court is required by c. 30A, \u00a7 14 (7), to \u201cgive due weight to the experience, technical competence, and specialized knowledge of the agency, as well as to the discretionary authority conferred upon it.\u201d We conclude the department had substantial evidence on this issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b238-7\">At the outset, we reject the plaintiffs\u2019 contention that there was <em>no </em>evidence in this record to merit a finding of public convenience and necessity. T-Com introduced evidence of the specific services it planned to offer Springfield area customers, the public need for these services, as well as the public demand for more options in radio paging services as a whole. The plaintiffs, who vigorously cross-examined the T-Com witnesses on other issues, did not challenge these assertions <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"221\">*221</page-number>nor did they offer testimony to contradict the T-Com evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b239-5\">However, the department did rely on a finding of the benefits of increased competition in the radio paging market it had made in a prior decision. <em>MCI Airsignal, Inc., </em>D.P.U. No. 1563 (1985). In <em>T-Com, Inc., </em>D.P.U. No. 84-104 (1985), the department cited its general policy that competition tended to result in lower prices, more diverse services, and greater choices for the consuming public. It then stressed its specific findings in <em>MCI Airsignal </em>regarding the existing level of competition in the radio paging market and the further benefits expected to enure to the public from opening that market to still greater competition. The plaintiffs argue that, because there was no examination of the competition issue during the T-Com hearings,<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> the department was precluded from going outside the record to findings made on that issue in <em>MCI </em>Airsignal.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> We do not agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b239-6\">The department\u2019s findings on the advantages to the public of increased competition fall into the category of nonadjudicative, policy-making judgments, rather than party-specific fact finding. See 3 K.C. Davis, Administrative Law \u00a7 15.3, at 142-145 (1980). Administrative agencies may establish policy through either adjudicatory proceedings or rulemaking. <em>Commonwealth Elec. Co. </em>v. <em>Department of Pub. Utils., </em>397 Mass. 361, 369 (1986). <em>Arthurs </em>v. <em>Board of Registration in Medicine, </em>383 Mass. 299, 312-313 (1981). <em>NLRB </em>v. <em>Seven-</em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"222\">*222</page-number><em>Up Bottling Co., </em>344 U.S. 344, 349 (1953). The choice of which process to utilize belongs to the agency. <em>Arthurs </em>v. <em>Board of Registration in Medicine, supra </em>at 313. Policies announced in such adjudicatory proceedings may then serve as precedents in future cases. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b240-5\">In <em>MCI Airsignal, </em>the department heard conflicting testimony, challenged by rigorous cross-examination, on the issue of the competitive state of the radio paging market and the potential benefits and disadvantages of increasing competition by certifying another entrant to that market. In two 1984 cases, it had also taken extensive testimony on competition in the telecommunications field in general, including the impact of the recent Federal policy shift in favor of deregulation.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> The department was entitled in the <em>T-Com </em>case to use the cumulative experiences gleaned in these proceedings, together with its expertise in the field to make a nonadjudicative fact finding without a full-blown relitigation of the issue on the <em>T-Com </em>record.</p>\n<p id=\"b240-6\">Since, in <em>MCI Airsignal </em>and in other recent decisions, the department has made public its policy favoring heightened competition, the plaintiff\u2019s were on notice of the department\u2019s policy on this question.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> G. L. c. 66, \u00a7 6 (1988 ed.). If they wished to challenge the department\u2019s position, they had the burden of introducing evidence to establish its invalidity. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"223\">*223</page-number>Neither Zachs nor Airphone did so. The department\u2019s decision on public convenience and necessity cannot, therefore, be assailed as lacking a basis in substantial evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b241-5\">b. <em>The equating of \u201cpublic interest\u201d with \u201cpublic convenience and </em>necessity.\u201d The plaintiffs contend that the department supported its decision in favor of T-Com by a finding of \u201cpublic interest,\u201d rather than \u201cpublic convenience and necessity,\u201d and thus caused the decision to be \u201carbitrary and capricious.\u201d G. L. c. 30A, \u00a7 14 (7) (g).</p>\n<p id=\"b241-6\">The department found that \u201cthere is a public need for the service proposed by T-Com,\u201d and concluded that \u201cthe public convenience and necessity will be served by the proposed Springfield operation.\u201d The plaintiffs, however, ignore these passages, and focus exclusively on the department\u2019s findings that it was \u201creasonable to expect that the public would both be protected by and benefit from more vigorous competition in the paging industry,\u201d and that \u201cthe public interest will be served by further competition in the paging industry.\u201d These statements, they argue, reveal that the department arbitrarily invoked a different standard from \u201cpublic convenience and necessity\u201d \u2014 namely, \u201cpublic interest.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b241-7\">The court has stated that the \u201cpublic convenience and necessity\u201d standard allows the department to exercise wide discretion to take into account a broad range of factors in making the determination whether it has been met. <em>Almeida Bus Lines, Inc. </em>v. <em>Department of Pub. Utils., </em>348 Mass. 331, 344 (1965). <em>Holyoke St. Ry. </em>v. <em>Department of Pub. Utils., </em>347 Mass. 440, 450 (1964). <em>Newton </em>v. <em>Department of Pub. Utils., </em>339 Mass. 535, 547 (1959) (all of which discussed the propriety of using the value of competition as a basis for making a \u201cpublic convenience and necessity\u201d finding).</p>\n<p id=\"b241-8\">The common theme running through our cases in this regard is that, since the mission of the agency is to regulate in the public interest, this is the overriding meaning of the term \u201cpublic convenience and necessity.\u201d Courts have frequently used the phrase \u201cpublic interest\u201d in discussing challenges to findings of \u201cpublic convenience and necessity.\u201d <em>Holyoke St. Ry. </em>v. <em>Department of Pub. Utils., supra </em>at 445, 450. <em>Newton </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"224\">*224</page-number>v. <em>Department of Pub. Utils., supra </em>at 546. See <em>Burlington Truck Lines </em>v. <em>United States, </em>371 U.S. 156, 167 (1962).</p>\n<p id=\"b242-5\">Moreover, the phrase \u201cpublic convenience and necessity\u201d is a term of art that stands for the general notion of \u201cpublic interest.\u201d See Jones, Origins of the Certificate of Public Convenience and Necessity: Developments in the States, 79 Colum. L. Rev. 426, 427 (1979) (tracing the history of the use of the term). Other courts have agreed that the phrase is \u201csimply a conclusory symbol\u201d for public benefit, good, or interest. <em>Professional Mobile Home Transp. </em>v. <em>Railroad Comm\u2019n of Tex., </em>733 S.W.2d 892, 894-895 n.l (Tex. Ct. App. 1987). See <em>Chesapeake &amp; Ohio Ry. </em>v. <em>United States, </em>283 U.S. 35, 42 (1931). We conclude, therefore, that it was not error for the department to use the concept of \u201cpublic interest\u201d in determining that T-Com\u2019s application satisfied the \u201cpublic convenience and necessity\u201d test.</p>\n<p id=\"b242-6\">c. <em>The findings of managerial, financial, and technical ability. </em>Finally, the plaintiffs assert that the department both lacked substantial evidence and was arbitrary and capricious in concluding T-Com has the managerial, financial, and technical capability to operate its proposed mobile radio paging facility in Springfield. We do not agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b242-7\">On each of these prerequisites the department had before it T-Com\u2019s testimony and financial records. Thus, it had \u201csuch evidence as a reasonable mind might accept as adequate to support a conclusion\u201d \u2014 the statutory definition of substantial evidence. G. L. c. 30A, \u00a7 1 (6). That T-Com\u2019s evidence regarding these issues was subjected to strenuous cross-examination by the plaintiffs does not advance their cause. The weight of the evidence is for the department to decide. \u201cA court may not displace an administrative board\u2019s choice between two fairly conflicting views, even though the court would justifiably have made a different choice had the matter been before it de nova.\u201d <em>Southern Worcester County Regional Vocational School Dist. </em>v. <em>Labor Relations Comm\u2019n, </em>386 Mass. 414, 420 (1982), quoting <em>Universal Camera Corp. </em>v. <em>NLRB, </em>340 U.S. 474, 488 (1951). This principle extends to credibility determinations and inferences <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"225\">*225</page-number>the department was entitled to draw from all the evidence. <em>Pyramid Co. of Hadley </em>v. <em>Architectural Barriers Bd., </em>403 Mass. 126, 130 (1988).</p>\n<p id=\"b243-5\">On the managerial and technical qualifications issues, the department had before it evidence of T-Com\u2019s prior and continuing operation of similar radio paging facilities, detailed plans to establish and supervise the Springfield facility, experience with technical maintenance and the like. It rejected the assertion that, because T-Com\u2019s headquarters Were in Michigan and technical maintenance would be provided by a local contractor, the company failed to prove it had the technical capability to provide proper service to Springfield area customers. We give \u201cdue weight to the experience, technical competence and specialized knowledge of the agency,\u201d and therefore conclude that the judgments of the department are neither unsupported by substantial evidence nor arbitrary and capricious. <em>Seagram Distillers Co. </em>v. <em>Alcoholic Beverages Control Comm\u2019n, </em>401 Mass. 713, 721 (1988), quoting G. L. c. 30A, \u00a7 14 (7).</p>\n<p id=\"b243-6\">Similarly, on the question of T-Com\u2019s financial ability, it was within the department\u2019s discretion to give greater weight to T-Com\u2019s substantially increased recent net income than its over-all deficit position, stemming from the company\u2019s transition in business focus from data processing services to radio paging. Given T-Com\u2019s testimony that its parent corporation had committed itself to providing T-Com with whatever financial assistance it might need to make the Springfield project a success, it was not unreasonable for the department to find that T-Com had sufficient financial means to operate the Springfield facility. Neither the fact that the parent corporation\u2019s commitment was not in writing, nor the conclusion in a prior case that net income alone might not be an appropriate financial indicator on which to base a decision, compels a contrary result, nor renders the department\u2019s decision arbitrary and capricious.</p>\n<p id=\"b243-7\">Finally, the plaintiffs claim that the department\u2019s findings on financial ability are based on two evidentiary errors. Even if the department\u2019s finding that T-Com had a revolving line <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"226\">*226</page-number>of credit from its bank was unsupported by the evidence as alleged, there was other substantial evidence on which the department could make a finding of financial fitness. An error of this magnitude is not enough to undermine the decision. See <em>Trustees of Clark Univ. </em>v. <em>Department of Pub. Utils., </em>372 Mass. 331, 335 (1977). Secondly, the plaintiffs claim that the board improperly relied on a T-Com financial report that included the data of the company\u2019s 1984 increase in net income. They contend that this financial report which was not listed in the certificate of the record was not properly in evidence and should not have been relied upon by the department in deciding the issue of T-Com\u2019s financial qualifications. However, the presiding officer requested this evidence and directed T-Com to supply it in its reply brief.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> The plaintiffs made no timely objection, although they had the opportunity to do so. That in addition there may have been an error in the certification of the record to this court is an insufficient basis on which to attack the department\u2019s decision.</p>\n<p id=\"A4k\">2. <em>The decision not to reopen the hearings. </em>The plaintiffs argue that G. L. c. 159, \u00a7 12B, prohibits beginning construetion of a mobile radio telephone facility without a certificate of public convenience and necessity,<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> and that c. 159, \u00a7 10, charges the department with \u201cenforc[ing] this chapter.\u201d Since they discovered, subsequent to the close of hearings, that T-Com had begun such construction prior to the department\u2019s issuance of a certificate, the plaintiffs contend they demonstrated \u201cgood cause,\u201d requiring the department to reopen hearings under its own regulations, 220 Code Mass. Regs. \u00a7 1.11 (8) (1986).<footnotemark>11</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b245-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"227\">*227</page-number>In general, administrative agencies have broad discretion over procedural aspects of matters before them. <em>New Boston Garden Corp. </em>v. <em>Assessors of Boston, </em>24 Mass. App. Ct. 122, 125 (1987). The decision whether to reopen hearings is one such procedural matter on which we have accorded agencies a great deal of flexibility. <em>Brookline </em>v. <em>Commissioner of the Dep\u2019t of Envt\u2019l Quality Eng\u2019g, </em>387 Mass. 372, 385 (1982). In this case, this principle is additionally embodied in the department\u2019s regulation governing the reopening of hearings. 220 Code Mass. Regs \u00a7 1.11(8), clearly gives the department the discretion to do so in circumstances of merit (\u201cexcept upon . . . showing of good cause\u201d). Therefore, we will not disturb the department\u2019s decision not to reopen hearings without the demonstration of error of law or abuse of discretion.</p>\n<p id=\"b245-5\">The plaintiffs assert that beginning construction of the radio paging facility before the issuance of a certificate of public convenience and necessity is per se \u201cgood cause,\u201d since it is a clear violation of a statutory requirement. They contend that the use of imperative language in c. 159, \u00a7 12B (\u201c[n]o person . . . shall begin ... the construction . . . without a certificate\u201d) leaves the department no discretion at all in enforcement, and must, perforce, constitute \u201cgood cause\u201d to reopen hearings when the violation occurs after they have closed. We do not construe the statute in this manner.</p>\n<p id=\"b245-6\">The department\u2019s powers are shaped by the statute as a whole. <em>Greater Boston Real Estate Bd. </em>v. <em>Board of Registration of Real Estate Brokers &amp; Salesmen, </em>405 Mass. 360, 363 (1989). The Legislature has delegated to the department the power to enforce c. 159. See G. L. c. 159, \u00a7 10. While the plaintiffs are correct that the Legislature has used the imperative voice in \u00a7 12B, in proscribing construction of facilities by such operators prior to receiving certificates of public convenience and necessity, the Legislature has also re<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"228\">*228</page-number>mained conspicuously silent as to the consequences of a violation of this requirement. See <em>Brennan </em>v. <em>The Governor, </em>405 Mass. 390, 395 (1989). Since the Legislature is presumed to understand and to intend all the consequences of its own actions, <em>id., </em>and since it has left enforcement of c. 159 and the issuance of certificates of public convenience and necessity to the department, it follows that the department has the authority to determine what the consequences of an unauthorized construction will be in a given case. \u201c[Djetails of legislative policy, not spelfled] out in the statute, may appropriately be determined, at least in the first instance, by an agency charged with administration of the statute.\u201d <em>Cleary </em>v. <em>Cardullo\u2019s, Inc., </em>347 Mass. 337, 344 (1964). We have held this discretion to be especially broad \u201cwhen [the] agency is concerned with . . . setting enforcement policy.\u201d <em>Boston Preservation Alliance Inc. </em>v. <em>Secretary of Envt\u2019l Affairs, </em>396 Mass. 489, 498 (1986).</p>\n<p id=\"b246-5\">Here the department judged T-Com\u2019s violation on the basis of its effects on the public interest and concluded that T-Com\u2019s violation in this situation was not one that would render the company unfit for a certificate of public convenience and necessity \u2014 a subject explored at great length through five hearings. That being the case, the department ruled that the appellants had not met the minimum standard of \u201cgood cause\u201d required to reopen the hearings. That decision was within the reasonable exercise of the department\u2019s discretion.</p>\n<p id=\"b246-6\">Finally, the plaintiffs\u2019 argument, that the department\u2019s decision not to reopen the hearings lacks subsidiary findings, fails even a cursory examination, since our discussion indicates that the department provided us with a \u201cstatement of reasons that allow us to determine the propriety of the order.\u201d <em>Costello </em>v. <em>Department of Pub. Utils., </em>391 Mass. 527, 534 (1984).<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> The department has given us a reasoned deci<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"229\">*229</page-number>sion describing why the rehearing was denied, <em>Brookline </em>v. <em>Commissioner of the Dep\u2019t of Envt\u2019l Quality Eng\u2019g, supra </em>at 385. We see no basis to disturb the department\u2019s discretionary judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"A6f\">The decisions of the department in relation to T-Com\u2019s application for a certificate of public convenience and necessity are affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"A1A\">\n<em>So ordered.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b236-11\"> General Laws c. 25, \u00a7 5, states in pertinent part: \u201cAn appeal as to matters of law from any final decision, order or ruling of the [Department of Public Utilities] may be taken to the supreme judicial court by an aggrieved party in interest . . . .\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b236-12\"><em> T-Com, Inc., </em>D.P.U.

See <em>United States </em>v. <em>Utah Constr. &amp; Mining Co., </em>384 U.S. 394, 421-422 (1966); Restatement (Second) of Judgments \u00a7 83 (1982). Because issue preclusion has not been relied on in this case, we do not decide the challenged use of the <em>MCI Airsignal </em>findings with respect to Zachs on that basis. Mass. R. A. P. 16 (a) (4), as amended, 367 Mass. 921 (1975).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b240-7\"> See <em>First Phone, Inc., </em>D.P.U.
