This determination of the tax factor was made pursuant to the statutory procedure governing the administration of local property taxes. G. L. c. 40, \u00a7 56 (1988 ed.) (\u201cthe city council ... in each city . . . shall annually first determine the percentages of the local tax levy to be borne by each class of real property . . . and personal property for the next fiscal year\u201d). The plaintiffs, a group of Gloucester residents, challenged the September 27 vote by a referendum petition bearing the signatures of the requisite number of Gloucester registered voters. The Gloucester registrar of voters certified the signatures on October 21, 1988. On November 3, 1988, the city council decided, on the advice of legal counsel, that the vote of September 27 was not subject to referendum. The city council also voted not to rescind the earlier vote.</p>\n<p id=\"b356-6\">The plaintiffs commenced an action in the Superior Court on February 2, 1989, seeking declaratory and other relief to the effect that the September 27 vote constituted a \u201cmeasure\u201d subject to referendum under \u00a7 9-3 of the Gloucester city charter and the provisions of G. L. c. 43, \u00a7 42 (1988 ed.). The parties prepared a statement of agreed facts (the essential parts of which are set forth above), and a judge in the Superior Court reported the case to the Appeals Court. We granted the plaintiffs\u2019 application for direct appellate review. We conclude that the issue presented has become moot. However, because the issue is important, and might recur, we exercise our discretion to express our views on the issue.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b357-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"339\">*339</page-number>1. The tax bills for fiscal year 1989 have been sent out and the taxes collected by the city. The current fiscal year\u2019s tax classification vote has been taken by the city council, and it has not been made the subject of challenge by referendum petition. There appears to be no present controversy before the court. See <em>Brown </em>v. <em>City Council of Cambridge, </em>289 Mass. 333, 334 (1935).</p>\n<p id=\"b357-5\">However, the question raised is one of public importance not only to Gloucester but also to other municipalities. There is a likelihood that the controversy could recur by a challenge to a future vote setting the tax factor. In view of the time needed to complete preparation of the case in the trial court, there is a good chance that the question, once raised, could evade judicial review. We conclude that the uncertainty presented by the issue should be settled and, therefore, we shall state our views despite the mootness of the case. See <em>Karchmar </em>v. <em>Worcester, </em>364 Mass. 124, 136 (1973).</p>\n<p id=\"b357-6\">2. Section 42 of c. 43 of the General Laws provides that \u201cthe final passage of any measure\u201d (except a revenue loan order) by a city council or a school committee may be presented for voter approval in a referendum petition.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> For purposes of this case, we assume that the plaintiffs have essentially complied with the requirements of the statutory procedure for preparing a referendum petition notwithstanding some discrepancies in the form of their documents. See <em>Lafleur </em>v. <em>Chicopee, </em>352 Mass. 746, 753 (1967). Thus, if the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"340\">*340</page-number>September 27 vote constituted \u201cthe final passage of any measure,\u201d the plaintiffs would have been entitled to have their referendum petition placed on the ballot for consideration by the voters of Gloucester.</p>\n<p id=\"b358-5\">The term \u201cmeasure\u201d is defined as \u201can ordinance, resolution, order or vote passed by a city council.\u201d G. L. c. 43, \u00a7 37 (1988 ed.).<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> In construing the term in previous cases, we have considered instructive the distinction between legislative and executive acts, reasoning that only the former constitute \u201cmeasure[s]\u201d subject to referendum petition. See, e.g., <em>Gould </em>v. <em>City Council of Newburyport, </em>392 Mass. 302 (1984); <em>Moore </em>v. <em>School Comm. of Newton, </em>375 Mass. 443 (1978); <em>Fantini </em>v. <em>School Comm. of Cambridge, </em>362 Mass. 320 (1972); <em>Gorman </em>v. <em>Peabody, </em>312 Mass. 560 (1942); <em>Dooling v. City Council of Fitchburg, </em>242 Mass. 599 (1922). See also 5 E. McQuillin, Municipal Corporations \u00a7 16.55, at 265 (3d ed. rev. 1989) (noting that the referendum power is generally restricted to legislative acts).</p>\n<p id=\"b358-6\">In applying the legislative-executive test, we have noted that the crucial inquiry is \u201cwhether the proposition is one to make new law or to execute law' already in existence.\u201d <em>Moore </em>v. <em>School Comm. of Newton, supra </em>at 447, quoting 5 E. McQuillin, <em>supra </em>at \u00a7 16.55, at 266. See <em>Dooling </em>v. <em>City Council of Fitchburg, supra </em>at 601-602 (defining a legislative act as \u201cthe laying down of a rule, a principle or a law by which the conduct of a public officer may be guided\u201d). We are satisfied that the September 27 vote setting the tax factor was an executive act.</p>\n<p id=\"b358-7\">The authority to establish the residential tax factor under G. L. c. 40, \u00a7 56, has been conferred by the Legislature on boards of selectmen in towns and on city councils, \u201ctogether with the . . . approval\u201d of mayors, in cities. The board of selectmen, in many municipalities, constitutes the chief executive office of a town, and the board\u2019s vote is not subject under the statute to the approval of the town meeting. Thus, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"341\">*341</page-number>in many of the Commonwealth\u2019s municipalities, the decision as to the tax factor is made solely by the executive body. Prior to 1982, in cities, the primary determination of the tax factor was made by the board of assessors or by the mayor subject to approval by the city council. This decision was clearly an executive act. Since 1982, the tax factor in cities is determined by the city council with the mayor\u2019s approval. The primary authority in the area, which has also been considered executive in nature, was thus transferred from the assessors or mayor to the city council. We doubt that the Legislature would want the tax factor decision considered as different in substance depending on whether the decision is made in a town or a city.</p>\n<p id=\"b359-5\">The statutory process also makes it clear that several municipal officers and boards, as well as State officers, are intimately involved in the complex process of setting the tax rate. The board of assessors is required to furnish information to the Commissioner of Revenue so that he can: (a) certify that the board is assessing property at full and fair cash value; and (b) determine a minimum residential tax factor pursuant to G. L. c. 58, \u00a7 1A (1988 ed.). The board of assessors must also provide information to the board of selectmen or to the city council and mayor, as well as to the general public, so that an intelligent decision can be made on the residential tax factor and the percentage of the levy to be borne by each class of property. See G. L. c. 40, \u00a7 56. The Commissioner of Revenue then must give final approval to the tax rate, which, once approved and returned to the assessors, cannot be changed. See G. L. c. 59, \u00a7 23 (1988 ed.). This process suggests that the various officials involved are engaged in implementation of the laws which establish the intricate process for the administration of the local property tax. Thus, the September 27 vote of the city council of Gloucester served to execute the existing tax laws. Due to its primarily executive character, the setting of the tax factor does not constitute a \u201cmeasure,\u201d and is not subject to the referendum petition process.</p>\n<p id=\"b360-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"342\">*342</page-number>Our conclusion rests on one other consideration. We have held that prudential concerns of efficient government warrant placing certain limitations on the definition of \u201cmeasure.\u201d \u201cIn ascertaining the intent of the Legislature with respect to the scope and nature of the referendum powers that it has conferred, it is appropriate and important to consider what the consequences of applying [them] to a particular act of legislation would be, and, if it is found that the exercise of those powers tends to destroy the efficacy of other governmental mandates, the court ought not to place such an interpretation upon the grant of the referendum powers as to bring about any such result.\u201d <em>Gilet </em>v. <em>City Clerk of Lowell, </em>306 Mass. 170, 175-176 (1940). <em>See Dooling v. City Council of Fitchburg, supra </em>at 602; 5 E. McQuillin, <em>supra </em>at \u00a7 16.55, at 265-266.</p>\n<p id=\"b360-5\">Considerable financial difficulty could follow from a decision that a city\u2019s tax factor could be made subject to referendum petition. If the tax factor were placed on a referendum and defeated by the voters, the city would be unable to send out its tax bills and thus would be unable to collect revenue. Furthermore, this confused state of affairs could persist for an extended period of time in view of the fact that the referendum could only invalidate the particular tax factor chosen without enacting a new tax factor in its place. The city council, following a referendum defeat, would have to adopt a new tax factor, which in turn might also be subjected to a referendum challenge. The potentially indefinite delay in collecting vital tax revenues could result in extreme fiscal distress for the city and considerable unnecessary borrowing to meet municipal needs. We cannot conceive that the Legislature intended such an impractical result.</p>\n<p id=\"b360-6\">3.
