The provision in question reads as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b307-9\">\u201cThe limit of liability stated in the declarations as applicable to \u2018each claim\u2019 is the limit of the company\u2019s liability for loss resulting from any one claim or suit or all claims or suits because of injury to or death of any one person.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b307-10\">Specifically, we must decide whether the patient\u2019s claim for malpractice, and any claim for the loss of the patient\u2019s consortium brought by a spouse or child, constitute a single \u201cclaim\u201d or separate \u201cclaims\u201d for purposes of the limitation. The answer to this question determines whether the malpractice plaintiff and the consortium plaintiff or plaintiffs each may recover up to the policy\u2019s stated limit for \u201ceach claim\u201d or whether their aggregate recovery is confined to a single amount. We conclude that the malpractice and consortium claims are distinct and separate claims, each of which is subject to separate \u201cper claim\u201d limits of recovery under the terms of the JUA policy.</p>\n<p id=\"b307-11\">The facts have been agreed on and may be summarized as follows.</p>\n<p id=\"b307-12\"><em>The Pinheiro case. </em>Edward Pinheiro was treated by a physician in 1976. Pinheiro subsequently sued the physician for negligence, claiming damages for pain and suffering, loss of income, and medical expenses. Additionally, Pinheiro\u2019s wife, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"290\">*290</page-number>Maria, and his daughter, Suzanne, brought claims for loss of consortium. At the time he treated Pinheiro, the physician was insured under a 1975 JUA policy which included a liability limit of $100,000 for \u201ceach claim\u201d and an \u201cannual aggregate\u201d limit of $300,000. JUA has conditionally settled the claims brought by the Pinheiros, and will pay Maria and Suzanne an agreed-on amount if it is judicially determined that their consortium claims are separate claims under the applicable policy.</p>\n<p id=\"b308-4\"><em>The O\u2019Connor case. </em>In 1978, Edward J. O\u2019Connor was treated by a physician. He died the following year, and his widow, as administratrix and individually, sued the physician for negligence, wrongful death, and loss of consortium. A jury returned a verdict for the plaintiff on all claims. The physician was insured under a 1977 JUA policy. The insurer has paid the per claim limit of the policy toward the judgment and has submitted the question of its liability on the remaining unpaid amount, which pertains to the consortium claim, for judicial determination. With these facts established, a judge of the Superior Court reported the coverage question to the Appeals Court. We granted an application for direct appellate review.</p>\n<p id=\"b308-5\">1. The JUA\u2019s position that the plain language of the limitation precludes a ruling that a consortium claim is a separate \u201cclaim\u201d is principally based on two portions of the limitation: (1) the language which concerns a loss resulting from claims \u201cbecause of injury to or death of any one person,\u201d and (2) the language which applies to a loss resulting \u201cfrom all claims or suits.\u201d We discuss each in turn.</p>\n<p id=\"b308-6\">\n<em>\u201cinjury to or death of any one person'\u2019'</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b308-7\">The JUA argues that \u201c[i]n the context of a medical malpractice policy, this . . . phrase [\u2018injury to or death of any one person\u2019] is not ambiguous and refers to- the primary injury, which will ordinarily be a physical injury to or death of the physician\u2019s patient.\u201d Although the JUA acknowledges, as it must, that the term \u201cinjury,\u201d as used in its policy, encom<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"291\">*291</page-number>passes injuries other than bodily injuries,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> the JUA\u2019s brief consistently argues that their policy should be construed in the context of the \u201ctypical malpractice situation in which the patient suffers physical injury or death.\u201d In attempting to analogize the policy\u2019s language to that of an automobile insurance policy we construed in <em>Liberty Mut. Ins. Co. </em>v. <em>Commissioner of Ins., </em>395 Mass. 765 (1985), the JUA argues that, in the <em>Liberty Mut. </em>context, \u201cthe phrase \u2018injury to one person\u2019 is <em>not </em>ambiguous, any more than the language of the JUA policy is ambiguous. In context, they both clearly refer to physical injury\u201d (emphasis in original). This interpretation of the words \u201cinjury\u201d and \u201cperson\u201d would prevent a consortium plaintiff\u2019s suit from constituting a separate \u201cclaim\u201d because the consortium plaintiff suffered no physical injury and was not a patient of the insured physician. The only independent \u201cclaim\u201d would belong to the bodily-injured patient \u2014 the malpractice plaintiff. Based on this analysis, JUA concludes that the consortium plaintiff\u2019s right to recover under the policy is essentially derivative \u2014 that it arises \u201cbecause of\u2019 the injury to the patient \u2014 and thus must be consolidated with the malpractice plaintiff\u2019s action for purposes of limiting JUA\u2019s liability for \u201ceach claim.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b309-5\">The obvious difficulty with this interpretation is that the provision purports to cover claims resulting from an \u201cinjury <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"292\">*292</page-number>to . . . <em>any one </em>person\u201d (emphasis added). Thus the provision, by its express language, recognizes that there may be more than one person who suffers an \u201cinjury\u201d because of a single act of malpractice. To be sure, the provision encompasses the claim or claims made by the patient.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> But it also encompasses the claim or claims of any other person who is harmed as the result of the malpractice. It is settled that a consortium plaintiff suffers an injury which is separate and distinct from the loss incurred by the injured spouse or patient.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> The limitation straightforwardly promises to pay up to the policy limit for a single claim or multiple claims stemming from the \u201cinjury\u201d incurred by each \u201cperson\u201d as a result of the malpractice. Although the JUA would like to have the limitation read to substitute the word \u201cpatient\u201d for \u201cperson,\u201d or to insert the word \u201cbodily,\u201d or the word \u201cphysical,\u201d before the word \u201cinjury,\u201d the clause must be construed as written. See <em>Barnstable County Mut. Fire Ins. Co. </em>v. <em>Lally, </em>374 Mass. 602, 605-606 (1978); <em>Ober </em>v. <em>National Casualty Co., </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"293\">*293</page-number>318 Mass. 27, 30 (1945). We conclude that use of the words \u201cinjury to . . . any one person\u201d in the JUA limitation, fairly and reasonably construed, see <em>Cody </em>v. <em>Connecticut Gen. Life Ins. Co., </em>387 Mass. 142, 146 (1982), provides that each consortium plaintiff has a separate claim for limitation of liability purposes.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b311-4\"><em>\u201call claims or </em>suits\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b311-5\">JUA also relies on the \u201call claims or suits\u201d language in the limitation as requiring a conclusion in its favor. The use of the plural in this phrase, contends JUA, means that all causes of action brought as a result of a single instance of malpractice constitute only one \u201cclaim\u201d for limitation of liability purposes regardless of how many individual plaintiffs are involved.</p>\n<p id=\"b311-6\">The JUA\u2019s interpretation of this language is reasonable, but it is not the only reasonable interpretation. The language also could be interpreted as stating that \u201call claims or suits\u201d brought <em>by one person </em>will be treated as a single \u201cclaim\u201d for limitation of liability purposes. This interpretation also draws support from the policy language itself. The policy applies an \u201ceach claim\u201d limit to \u201call claims or suits because of injury to . . . <em>any one </em>person\u201d (emphasis added). Because a malpractice plaintiff and a consortium plaintiff are separate \u201cperson [s],\u201d it is reasonable to read the policy as applying a separate \u201ceach claim\u201d limit to (1) \u201call claims or suits because of injury to [the malpractice plaintiff],\u201d and (2) \u201call claims or suits because of injury to [the consortium plaintiff].\u201d Under this interpretation, the \u201call claims or suits\u201d language would serve to preclude an individual plaintiff from alleging several theories of recovery and maintaining that each theory consti<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"294\">*294</page-number>tut\u00e9d a separate \u201cclaim\u201d under the policy language.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> The JUA\u2019s contrary interpretation of its limitation clause as \u201cestablish [ing] the maximum loss to which the JUA may be exposed from any single act of malpractice by an insured physician,\u201d effectively ignores this point and the limiting phrase \u201cany one person.\u201d In agreeing with that interpretation, the dissenting opinion does likewise.</p>\n<p id=\"b312-5\">Because the \u201call claims or suits\u201d language is susceptible of at least two reasonable interpretations, JUA is faced with the long-standing rule that, in construing unclear language in an insurance policy, the insured must be favored over the insurer.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> See <em>Morin </em>v. <em>Massachusetts Blue Cross, Inc., </em>365 Mass. 379, 384 (1974); <em>Transamerica Ins. Co. </em>v. <em>Norfolk &amp; Dedham Mut. Fire Ins. Co., </em>361 Mass. 144, 147 (1972); <em>King </em>v. <em>Prudential Ins. Co., </em>359 Mass. 46, 50 (1971); <em>Palmer </em>v. <em>Pawtucket Mut. Ins. Co., </em>352 Mass. 304, 306 (1967). For obvious reasons, we adhere closely to this rule in cases like these, where an insurer is attempting severely to restrict coverage under its policy. See <em>Morin </em>v. <em>Massachusetts Blue Cross, Inc., supra </em>at 389-390. We conclude that the \u201call claims or suits\u201d language in the limitation means <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"295\">*295</page-number>that no matter how many claims \u201cany one person\u201d has because of an \u201cinjury\u201d resulting from a physician\u2019s malpractice, the insurer will pay damages (loss) to that particular person only up to the maximum amount stated in the declarations.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b313-5\">2. A few other points that have been argued should be dealt with in the interest of completeness.</p>\n<p id=\"b313-6\">a. Our conclusion follows the holding in <em>Bilodeau </em>v. <em>Lumbermens Mut. Casualty Co., </em>392 Mass. 537, 545 (1984). The <em>Bilodeau </em>decision led to a change in the limitation language in automobile liability insurance policies, and JUA maintains that its limitation is a reasonable replica of the change.</p>\n<p id=\"b313-7\">In <em>Bilodeau, </em>we were called on to determine whether a loss of consortium claimant was entitled to a separate \u201cper person\u201d limit of recovery under the provision of the standard Massachusetts automobile liability insurance policy noted below.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> We reasoned in <em>Bilodeau </em>that, \u201cfor purposes of applying the limitation of liability \u2018for injuries to any one person as a result of any one accident,\u2019 the loss of consortium claimant must be considered a separate \u2018person\u2019 from the bodily-injured \u2018person.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>at 543. Thus, we concluded that the consortium plaintiff was entitled to a separate \u201cper person\u201d limit of recovery under the policy at issue in <em>Bilodeau.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b313-8\">In 1985, the year following the <em>Bilodeau </em>decision, the Commissioner of Insurance modified the language of the standard automobile insurance policy to remove the separate \u201cper person\u201d limit for loss of consortium plaintiffs.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> The <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"296\">*296</page-number>Commissioner effectively changed the <em>Bilodeau </em>result by modifying the \u201cper person\u201d liability language.</p>\n<p id=\"b314-5\">We disagree with JUA\u2019s contention that its policy is more similar to the <em>post-Bilodeau </em>version than to its <em>pre-Bilodeau </em>counterpart. First, with respect to the number of claimants swept within a single policy limit, the JUA policy differs from both versions of the automobile liability insurance policy by speaking in terms of \u201cclaims or suits\u201d rather than numbers of people. As we have discussed above, \u201cclaims or suits\u201d in the JUA policy reasonably could be read to refer to multiple \u201cclaims\u201d by a single plaintiff or to all \u201cclaims\u201d by all plaintiffs. Second, with respect to the nature of losses covered, the JUA policy (losses because of \u201cinjury\u201d) is closer to the <em>pre-Bilodeau </em>policy (losses because of \u201cany one accident\u201d) than to the <em>post-Bilodeau </em>version (losses because of \u201cbodily injury\u201d). Like the term \u201caccident,\u201d the term \u201cinjury\u201d is a broad, general concept, and, as has been discussed, is readily .differentiated from the more specific notion of \u201cbodily injury.\u201d For these reasons, if an analogy is to be drawn at all, the analogy would be between the JUA limitation and the limitation in the <em>pre-Bilodeau </em>automobile liability policy.</p>\n<p id=\"b314-6\">b. JUA also attaches significance to the fact that its policy defines the limit of liability for a \u201closs\u201d in the singular. Relying on the Appeals Court decision in <em>Doyon </em>v. <em>Travelers Indent. Co., </em>22 Mass. App. Ct. 336, 339 (1986), JUA argues that its use of the word \u201closs\u201d indicates that recovery under its policy, no matter how many claims there may be, is limited to a single indivisible amount. The <em>Doyon </em>decision, however, was concerned with the liability limits under the wrongful death statute, G. L. c. 229, \u00a7 2 (1988 ed.), which contains very clear and specific language, see <em>id. </em>at 338, drawing the consortium claims within the limits of a single recovery on a death claim. Further, the <em>Doyon </em>court notes, <em>supra </em>at 337, that its application of the wrongful death stat<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"297\">*297</page-number>ute to the consortium claim before it is based on the fact that there was no separate claim in the case for conscious pain and suffering on the part of the only person physically injured. Here, we have claims brought by the patients suffering the primary injury as well as separate claims brought by persons incurring a loss of consortium. Our facts have relevance to the reasoning contained in <em>Bilodeau, </em>not to the reasoning in <em>Doyon.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b315-5\">c. In light of the conclusions we have reached above, the out-of-State cases JUA relies on do not require separate discussion.</p>\n<p id=\"b315-6\">3. A judgment is to enter in the Superior Court declaring that, under the JUA policy provision at issue in each case, the consortium claims constitute separate claims, each of which is subject to separate per claim limits of recovery. The judgment is also to include any damages appropriately due and unpaid.</p>\n<p id=\"b315-7\">\n<em>So ordered.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b309-6\"> As a settled general principle, the term \u201cpersonal injury\u201d is not synonymous with \u201cbodily injury.\u201d See <em>Allstate Ins. Co. </em>v. <em>Diamant, </em>401 Mass. 654, 658 (1988); <em>Malone </em>v. Costa, 151 Fla. 144 (1942); <em>Nuzzi </em>v. <em>United States Casualty Co., </em>121 N.J.L. 249 (1938). Consistent with this difference, the JUA policy uses the term \u201cinjury\u201d in some of its provisions and the term \u201cbodily injury\u201d in others, and separately defines \u201cbodily injuries\" as \u201cbodily injury, sickness or disease sustained by any person . . . including death.\u201d Within this framework, the JUA policy, in addition to insuring against claims arising out of \u201cthe rendering of or failure to render professional services,\u201d also covers other potential losses, such as those arising out of \u201cservice by the individual <em>insured </em>as a member of a formal accreditation or similar professional board or committee of a hospital or professional society\u201d (emphasis in original). The policy, therefore, is clearly designed to cover losses which involve nonbodily injuries, including claims which could be brought by plaintiffs who are not patients of the insured physician.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b310-5\"> This point is enforced by the reference to \u201cdeath\u201d in the phrase under consideration.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b310-7\"> We recognized in <em>Diaz </em>v. <em>Eli Lilly &amp; Co., </em>364 Mass. 153, 160 (1973), that a consortium plaintiff suffers a distinct injury, which may include the \u201closs of companionship and affection, of sexual enjoyment, and of prospects of [parent] hood.\u201d See <em>Mendoza </em>v. <em>B.L.H. Electronics, </em>403 Mass. 437, 438 (1988); <em>Feliciano </em>v. <em>Rosemar Silver Co., </em>401 Mass. 141, 142 (1987); <em>Olsen </em>v. <em>Bell Tel. Laboratories, Inc., </em>388 Mass. 171, 176-177 (1983). The recognition in <em>Diaz </em>of the consortium plaintiffs injury as a substantial loss, with the clear indication that the loss is separate from that incurred by the bodily-injured plaintiff, antedated the issuance of JUA\u2019s policies in these cases. As we have noted previously, \u201c[o]ur prior cases indicate that a claim for loss of consortium is independent of the damage claim of the injured spouse.\u201d <em>Feltch </em>v. <em>General Rental Co., </em>383 Mass. 603, 607 (1981). See <em>Agis </em>v. <em>Howard Johnson Co., </em>371 Mass. 140, 146 (1976) (\u201cthe underlying purpose of [the loss of consortium action] is to compensate for the loss of companionship, affection and sexual enjoyment of one\u2019s spouse\u201d); <em>Erickson </em>v. <em>Buckley, </em>230 Mass. 467, 470-471 (1918) (wife\u2019s right to recover for personal injuries is \u201cindependent\u201d of husband\u2019s right to recover for loss of wife\u2019s services and society); <em>Duffee </em>v. <em>Boston Elevated Ry., </em>191 Mass. 563, 564 (1906) (both personal injury plaintiff and consortium plaintiff are \u201cenforcing an independent right\u201d). JUA was on sufficient notice of the legal rule that a consortium plaintiff suffers an injury which is distinct from that suffered by a malpractice plaintiff.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b311-7\"> JUA\u2019s reliance on <em>Dunn </em>v. <em>Travelers Ins. Co., </em>6 Mass. App. Ct. 910 (1978), does not help its case. The policy at issue in <em>Dunn </em>used the term \u201cbodily injury.\u201d See <em>id. </em>at 911. It follows from our analysis above that, if JUA likewise had employed the term \u201cbodily injury\u201d rather than \u201cinjury,\u201d our result in this case might be different. While JUA might have intended to limit its liability as did the insurer in <em>Dunn, </em>the language it chose did not accomplish the objective.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b312-6\"> The malpractice plaintiff, for example, could seek recovery under theories of negligence, breach of contract, and even intentional tort, arguing that each item constituted a separate \u201cclaim\u201d and was thus subject to a separate limit of recovery.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b312-7\"> JUA also argues that this rule of construction is inapplicable due to the \u201cdecisive role of the Commissioner of Insurance in establishing the coverage of the JUA\u2019s policy and the rates for that coverage.\u201d In support of this contention, JUA refers to our decision in <em>Bilodeau </em>v. <em>Lumbermens Mut. Casualty Co., </em>392 Mass. 537 (1984). The reliance on <em>Bilodeau </em>is misplaced. That case reiterated the settled rule that ambiguities will not automatically be resolved against an insurer when \u201cthe language of the standard policy is prescribed by statute and controlled by the Division of Insurance.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 541. While JUA\u2019s policy is subject to statutory regulation, such regulation does not include prescribed policy language. See St. 1975, c. 362, \u00a7 6. JUA was free to choose the language of its policy, subject only to final approval by the Commissioner. Given this relatively uncurtailed choice, there is no reason not to hold JUA to the policy language it has selected. If the JUA now wishes to change the language to correct the problem, it is free to do so. See <em>Bilodeau </em>v. <em>Lumbermens Mut. Casualty Co., supra </em>at 545 n.9.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"9\">\n<p id=\"b313-9\"> The JUA\u2019s argument that a \u201cdoctor would hardly think that the limits of coverage she purchased would depend on whether the patient she was treating was married or whether he had one, two, three or six children,\u201d is beside the point.

There being two reasonable interpretations, says the court, the one least favorable to JUA is the right one. I do not agree that the relevant language reasonably can be construed in any way other than the way in which the JUA construes it. Therefore, I conclude that the rule that ambiguities in policy language must be resolved against the insurer does not apply. There is no ambiguity. The policy says what the JUA says it says.</p>\n<p id=\"b316-6\">Sound analysis must begin with the proposition that the JUA had a purpose in inserting the language of liability limitation. No one could reasonably conclude that ineffective, meaningless language was intended. It is apparent that the JUA intended to deal with situations in which one act of malpractice might give rise to more than one claim for damages. The JUA confronted the question whether, in such a situation, its liability as to each claim generated by an injury to a patient would be limited to the amount stated in the policy as the JUA\u2019s maximum exposure, or, instead, the stated amount of maximum exposure would apply to the sum of all the claims, considered collectively, generated by the patient\u2019s injury.</p>\n<p id=\"b316-7\">As a practical matter, the question that the provision was obviously designed to answer could arise only when a patient with a spouse or children, or both, is injured by a physician\u2019s malpractice, with the result that the patient has a personal injury claim and family members have separate claims for loss of consortium. The function of the provision is to make clear that those several claims are to be treated as one for the purpose of construing the JUA\u2019s liability cap.</p>\n<p id=\"b316-8\">The court fails to suggest any other scenario in which, in the absence of such a provision, a realistic question might arise with respect to the JUA\u2019s maximum exposure. Certainly, neither the patient nor a family member can have more than one claim or cause of action for the injury or loss <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"299\">*299</page-number>he or she asserts. \u201c[D]amages resulting from a single tort. . . are, when suffered by one person, the subject of only one suit as against the wrongdoer.\u201d <em>Dearden </em>v. <em>Hey, </em>304 Mass. 659, 663 (1939). <em>Parrell </em>v. <em>Keenan, </em>389 Mass. 809, 816 n.10 (1983). <em>Cousineau </em>v. <em>Laramee, </em>388 Mass. 859, 860-861 (1983).</p>\n<p id=\"b317-5\">Although causes of action may be grounded on distinct theories of recovery, they cannot be split. For example, we held in <em>Forman </em>v. <em>Wolfson, </em>327 Mass. 341, 343, cert, denied, 342 U.S. 888 (1951), that, following a judgment for the defendant in a tort action alleging negligent malpractice, a subsequent action against the same defendant to recover for the same injury based on breach of contract will not lie. See also <em>Willett </em>v. <em>Webster, </em>337 Mass. 98, 102 (1958), quoting <em>Mackintosh </em>v. <em>Chambers, </em>285 Mass. 594, 596 (1934), as follows: \u201cThe statement of a different form of liability is not a different cause of action, provided it grows out of the same transaction, act, or agreement, and seeks redress for the same wrong.\u201d The court errs, then, when it states that the provision in question may reasonably be interpreted as \u201cserving] to preclude an individual plaintiff from alleging several theories of recovery and maintaining that each theory constituted a separate \u2018claim\u2019 under the policy language.\u201d <em>Ante </em>at 293-294. The language, if interpreted as the court interprets it, says nothing that would not be true if the language were omitted. Interpreted in that way, it is meaningless.</p>\n<p id=\"b317-6\">Construed as the JUA would construe it, the limitation of liability provision supplies the answer to an important question that would be open in its absence, and does so by language that is consistent with common usage. The court\u2019s construction, however, is strained, and results in the provision being bereft of meaning. Thus, the provision reasonably can be construed in only one way. It is not ambiguous. No tie-breaking rule of construction is called for. The JUA\u2019s proffered construction is correct.</p>\n<p id=\"b317-7\">The two cases that are before the court are here as a result of a Superior Court judge\u2019s report of the coverage question <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"300\">*300</page-number>discussed in the court\u2019s and my separate opinions. I would direct the entry of a judgment declaring that the limit of liability in the JUA policy applies to all damages arising out of an incident of malpractice which injures a patient, regardless of the number of claims for damages, or the number of theories in support thereof, including damages for loss of consortium, that are brought, and that the JUA does not owe the plaintiffs in either case any further amounts.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
