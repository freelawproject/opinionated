She died almost three months later as a result of her injuries. The plaintiffs claimed, among other things, that Dr. David Honeyman, Karen\u2019s psychiatrist, was grossly neg<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"45\">*45</page-number>ligent when he took Karen off round-the-clock, one-on-one observation and ordered that a staff member check on her every fifteen minutes.</p>\n<p id=\"b63-5\">A jury found Honeyman grossly negligent, found the Commonwealth liable for negligence, and found Honeyman and the Commonwealth liable for Karen\u2019s conscious pain and suffering and for violation of Karen\u2019s Federal civil rights. The jury awarded damages of $1.7 million, including $190,000 in punitive damages against Honeyman.</p>\n<p id=\"b63-6\">The trial judge, after considering motions for amending the judgment, new trial and judgment notwithstanding the verdict, entered a judgment<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> of $100,000 against the Commonwealth on the negligence claim. The judge ruled there was insufficient evidence to find Honeyman grossly negligent, and entered judgment notwithstanding the verdict in favor of Honeyman and the Commonwealth on the claims that they violated Karen\u2019s Federal civil rights and that Karen suffered conscious pain before her death.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> The judge left undisturbed the jury\u2019s finding, made in response to a special question, that Honeyman was a public employee. Both plaintiffs and defendants appealed to the Appeals Court. We granted Honeyman\u2019s petition for direct appellate review. We affirm the judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b63-7\">When acting on the defendants\u2019 motions for judgment notwithstanding the verdict, the judge\u2019s task, \u201ctaking into account all the evidence in its aspect most favorable to the plaintiff, [is] to determine whether, without weighing the credibility of the witnesses or otherwise considering the weight of the evidence, the jury reasonably could return a verdict for the plaintiff.\u201d <em>Tosti </em>v. <em>Ayik, </em>394 Mass. 482, 494 (1985), quoting <em>Rubel </em>v. <em>Hayden, Harding &amp; Buchanan, </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"46\">*46</page-number><em>Inc., </em>15 Mass. App. Ct. 252, 254 (1983). The court will consider whether \u201canywhere in the evidence, from whatever source derived, any combination of circumstances could be found from which a reasonable inference could be drawn\u201d in favor of the non-moving party. <em>Poirier </em>v. <em>Plymouth, </em>374 Mass. 206, 212 (1978), quoting <em>Raunela </em>v. <em>Hertz Corp., </em>361 Mass. 341, 343 (1972). The inferences to be drawn from the evidence must be based on probabilities rather than possibilities and cannot be the result of mere speculation and conjecture. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b64-5\">1. <em>Application of the Massachusetts Tort Claims Act. </em>In analyzing whether the defendant Honeyman is immune from personal liability under G. L. c. 258, commonly referred to as the Massachusetts Tort Claims Act, we must determine whether Honeyman was a public employee. Section 2 of chapter 258 extends immunity from personal liability to public employees who are acting within the scope of their duties. If a defendant is a public employee and his conduct constitutes simple or ordinary negligence, \u00a7 2 of chapter 258 clearly applies and the Commonwealth, as a public employer, is liable for the harm and the employee is not liable. The question whether G. L. c. 258 immunizes an employee from gross negligence as well as ordinary negligence has not been answered by our cases to date. Two sections of c. 258 come under review in resolving this issue. Section 2 renders the public employer but not the public employee liable \u201cfor injury or loss of property or personal injury or death caused by the negligent or wrongful act or omission.\u201d Section 10, which provides for exemptions from operation of \u00a7 <em>2, </em>among others, states in pertinent part that a public employee shall <em>not </em>be immune from \u201cany claim arising out of an intentional tort . . .\u201d It is silent as to gross negligence and hence, we conclude that a public employee <em>is </em>immune from a claim arising out of gross negligence because such a claim qualifies as a \u201cnegligent or wrongful act or omission\u201d under \u00a7 2. Accordingly, it is not material whether Honeyman\u2019s conduct constituted gross negligence or merely ordinary negligence for purposes of G. L. c. 258.</p>\n<p id=\"b65-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"47\">*47</page-number>On the issue of Honeyman\u2019s employment status, we agree with the trial judge that there was sufficient evidence to support the jury\u2019s verdict on a special question that Honeyman was a public employee. Honeyman joined the University of Massachusetts Medical School staff in 1980 as a psychiatrist, lecturer and assistant professor of psychiatry. His assignment included providing psychiatric services at the hospital, under a contract between his employer, the University of Massachusetts, and the State Department of Mental Health.</p>\n<p id=\"b65-5\">The plaintiffs contend that the University of Massachusetts Medical School is an independent body politic and not a public employer as defined by G. L. c. 258, \u00a7 l.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> The plaintiffs argue that if the University of Massachusetts is not a public employer, Honeyman is not a public employee.</p>\n<p id=\"b65-6\">To be deemed an \u201cindependent body politic,\u201d the university \u201cmust constitute an entity in itself and must have an existence apart and distinct from that of the Commonwealth.\u201d <em>Opinion of the Justices, </em>334 Mass. 721, 734 (1956). An examination of G. L. c. 75 makes clear that the university is an agency of the Commonwealth and thus is a public employer. Section 8 of c. 75 gives the State Comptroller authority to regulate the university\u2019s annual appropriations. The purchasing power of the university\u2019s board of trustees is limited by G. L. c. 75, \u00a7 13. Employees of the university are designated Commonwealth employees in \u00a7 14. The sale and lease of land by the trustees of the university are made in the name of the Commonwealth and are regulated by statute, G. L. c. 75, \u00a7\u00a7 25, 26 and 27.</p>\n<p id=\"b65-7\">Although the Legislature has empowered the trustees of the University of Massachusetts to establish a group practice at the medical center and to collect fees for medical services (St. 1974, c. 733, \u00a7\u00a7 1-7), the medical center is still primarily dependent on the Commonwealth, G. L. c. 75, \u00a7 8, and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"48\">*48</page-number>accountable to it in financial affairs. G. L. c. 75, \u00a7 10. The medical school has no authority to issue bonds. It cannot sue or be sued in its own name. All of these factors indicate that the university is an agency of the State, and not a separate entity.</p>\n<p id=\"b66-5\">The fact that the University of Massachusetts is a public employer does not automatically establish that all its employees are public employees. <em>Smith </em>v. <em>Steinberg, </em>395 Mass. 666, 668 (1985). The test for determining whether an individual is a public employee is the same as that used to establish \u201cwhether an agent is a servant for whose negligent acts a principal may be liable under the common law doctrine of respondeat superior.\u201d <em>Kelley </em>v. <em>Rossi, </em>395 Mass. 659, 661 (1985). While physicians exercise independent judgment, a physician can still be deemed a servant where the principal controls the details of the physician\u2019s activities. See <em>id. </em>at 662.</p>\n<p id=\"b66-6\">There was sufficient evidence from which the jury could conclude that Honeyman\u2019s employer controlled the details of his activities. Honeyman\u2019s superiors regulated his hours. He had no say as to the ward in which he would work or the patients that he would treat, unlike the physician in <em>Smith </em>v. <em>Steinberg, supra </em>at 669. Honeyman did not have any private patients and his income was not based on the number of patients he treated. The judge correctly left the jury\u2019s finding undisturbed.</p>\n<p id=\"b66-7\">Because Honeyman was a public employee, the Commonwealth is liable for his negligent conduct under G. L. c. 258, \u00a7 2, and the plaintiffs\u2019 claim for common law negligence against Honeyman (Count VI) fails. If we agree with the trial judge that the evidence supported a finding that Honeyman was negligent, we need not examine the plaintiffs\u2019 additional basis for charging liability against the Commonwealth.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> Accordingly, we need look only at Honeyman\u2019s treatment of Karen.</p>\n<p id=\"b67-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"49\">*49</page-number>2. <em>Negligence. </em>The trial judge ruled that the evidence supported a finding of negligence but did not support the jury\u2019s finding of gross negligence. We agree with the trial judge\u2019s conclusion. The defendants contest the judge\u2019s denial of a motion for judgment notwithstanding the verdict on the finding of negligence. The plaintiffs challenge the judge\u2019s denial of their motion to amend his judgment, which asked that jury\u2019s finding of gross negligence be reinstated.</p>\n<p id=\"b67-5\">The defendants contend that Honeyman was not negligent in his treatment of Karen. The Commonwealth, as a public employer, is liable under G. L. c. 258, \u00a7 2, if the jury reasonably found that there was a duty owed to Karen, that there was a breach of such duty by Honeyman, that injury resulted from the breach and that a causal connection existed between the breach and the injury. <em>Dinsky </em>v. <em>Framingham, </em>386 Mass. 801, 804 (1982).</p>\n<p id=\"b67-6\">The standard of care required of a psychiatrist is consistent with that of a medical practitioner. <em>Stepakoff </em>v. <em>Kantar, </em>393 Mass. 836, 840 (1985). The psychiatrist must exercise the same degree of skill and care as is exercised by the average qualified practitioner in that specialty, taking into account the advances in that profession and the resources available to the physician. <em>Id. </em>at 840.</p>\n<p id=\"b67-7\">Karen was diagnosed as schizophrenic at age seventeen, when she was admitted to a state mental hospital for the first time. Over the next three years she displayed a pattern of relatively calm behavior followed by periods of violence against herself and others. When she became extremely disruptive and self-destructive, she would be admitted to the hospital, which was the most restrictive mental health facility available in her area.</p>\n<p id=\"b67-8\">Her fifth and final admission to the hospital began on Thanksgiving Day in 1980, after she attempted to harm herself by digging a fork into her wrist while on a home visit. A <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"50\">*50</page-number>week earlier, she had slashed her wrist with a piece of broken glass. The staff at the adolescent mental health center where she had been living concluded they could not risk taking care of Karen when she was \u201csuicidally active.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b68-5\">During this final hospital admission, Karen continued her pattern of erratic behavior. Upon her arrival, the admitting doctor ordered one-on-one observation of Karen to prevent her from commiting suicide. The following day, November 28, 1980, after Karen told Honeyman she did not intend to kill herself, he reduced the precautions to staff checks every fifteen minutes. Later that day, she took the flip top from a can of soda and cut her neck superficially. She was returned to one-on-one observation by another member of the staff.</p>\n<p id=\"b68-6\">On December 2, 1980, Honeyman again reduced the level of observation to fifteen-minute checks for Karen, noting that Karen had stated she did not intend to harm herself. She bolted from the ward later that day just as the door was unlocked. Security employees returned her to the ward and the staff ordered one-on-one observation for Karen.</p>\n<p id=\"b68-7\">For the next two weeks she remained in one-on-one observation status. During this period of time, Karen made several attempts to harm herself by punching windows, banging her head on the bed and trying to cut or choke herself. She was also abusive to the staff, both orally and physically. When she became difficult to control, the staff put her in wrist-and-ankle restraints until she calmed down. This happened on five occasions between December 3 and 14, 1980.</p>\n<p id=\"b68-8\">The afternoon of December 16, Karen\u2019s boy friend visited her and then informed a hospital staff member that Karen claimed to have attempted suicide that day. Whether or not Karen actually had attempted suicide, the jury reasonably could infer that Honeyman was on notice that she again might attempt suicide. <em>Poirier </em>v. <em>Plymouth, supra.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b68-9\">On the morning of December 17, Karen attended the Hill Program for adolescents. She returned to the hospital in the afternoon, where she presented herself, unasked, at a staff meeting attended by Honeyman. Although she seemed anxious and distressed, she was sent away. Within a half hour, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"51\">*51</page-number>she hanged herself. Sometime after Karen was found hanging, Honeyman inserted a notation into her medical records, which he dated December 16, stating, \u201cNo intent for self harm. No recent incidents. Future oriented.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b69-5\">Honeyman testified that he changed Karen\u2019s status on December 16, the day before she hanged herself, from one-on-one observation to fifteen-minute checks. He said he based his decision on the fact that Karen\u2019s behavior had been relatively stable since December 8, which he stated was the last time that she was restrained for concerns about dangerousness.</p>\n<p id=\"b69-6\">Although Karen had twice tried to choke herself using a candy cane and a cigarette on December 11, Honeyman testified that he did not consider them to be true suicide attempts. He also cited her promise not to harm herself and her willingness to enter treatment at a program for adolescents as indications that the less restrictive status was appropriate.</p>\n<p id=\"b69-7\">The plaintiffs\u2019 expert, Dr. Michael Nelson, testified that Karen\u2019s behavior, as described in the records, was out of control throughout her stay at the hospital. He stated that he would not consider Karen to be stabilized unless she had two or three weeks of consistent, safe behavior, during which she harmed neither herself nor others. Nelson testified that because Karen\u2019s behavior was out of control, the fifteen-minute checks, which Honeyman ordered, were not sufficient to manage her condition. He stated that, in his opinion, the death was preventable if Karen had been kept on the close scrutiny of one-on-one observation. A juror could, then, have inferred from Dr. Nelson\u2019s testimony that Honeyman\u2019s negligence in failing to keep Karen on one-on-one observation was the proximate cause of her death.</p>\n<p id=\"b69-8\">The judge relied upon Dr. Nelson\u2019s testimony in concluding that the jury could find that Honeyman was negligent. We think that Nelson\u2019s testimony, fairly read, when considered with the other evidence in the plaintiffs\u2019 favor concerning Karen\u2019s behavior and condition, warranted a finding that Honeyman deviated from accepted medical practice expected <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"52\">*52</page-number>of a psychiatrist in these circumstances by removing Karen from one-on-one observation.</p>\n<p id=\"b70-5\">3. <em>Civil rights. </em>The plaintiffs challenge the trial judge\u2019s entry of judgment notwithstanding the verdict on their claim that Honeyman and the Commonwealth violated Karen\u2019s civil rights. To establish a claim based on 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983,<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> a plaintiff must show that the conduct complained of was committed by a person acting under color of State law and that the conduct deprived a person of rights, privileges or immunities secured by the Constitution or laws of the United States. <em>Miga </em>v. <em>Holyoke, </em>398 Mass. 343, 349 (1986). <em>Parratt </em>v. <em>Taylor, </em>451 U.S. 527, 535 (1981), overruled on other grounds, <em>Daniels </em>v. <em>Williams, </em>474 U.S. 327 (1986). The plaintiffs primarily asserted Karen\u2019s rights under the Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution as the basis for their claim. <em>Youngberg </em>v. <em>Romeo, </em>457 U.S. 307, 324 (1982) (involuntarily committed patient in state institution has constitutionally protected interest in reasonable care and safety).</p>\n<p id=\"b70-6\">As the trial judge correctly ruled, the Commonwealth is not a \u201cperson\u201d under \u00a7 1983. <em>Woodbridge </em>v. <em>Worcester State Hosp., </em>384 Mass. 38, 44 n.7 (1981), and cases cited. Since the day on which the case was argued, the United States Supreme Court has decided that neither a State nor a State official acting in his official capacity is a person under 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983. See <em>Will </em>v. <em>Michigan Dep\u2019t of State Police, </em>109 S.Ct. 2304 (1989). In addition, the Commonwealth did not waive its immunity under the Eleventh Amendment to the United States Constitution by the passage of the Massachusetts Tort Claims Act, G. L. c. 258. <em>Irwin </em>v. <em>Commis</em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"53\">*53</page-number><em>sioner of the Dep\u2019t of Youth Servs., </em>388 Mass. 810, 821 (1983).</p>\n<p id=\"b71-5\">\u201c[T]he Due Process Clause is simply not implicated by a <em>negligent </em>act of an official causing unintended loss or injury to life, liberty or property\u201d (emphasis in original). <em>Appleton </em>v. <em>Hudson, </em>397 Mass. 812, 818-819 (1986), quoting <em>Daniels </em>v. <em>Williams, </em>474 U.S. 327, 328 (1986). The plaintiffs argue that simple negligence is enough to state a claim for violation of Federal civil rights when a special relationship exists between the defendant and the victim. The special relationship here is that of physician and patient. The United States Supreme Court has already examined claims in that context and found simple negligence to be an inadequate basis for a claim that constitutional rights have been infringed. <em>Estelle </em>v. <em>Gamble, </em>429 U.S. 97, 105-106 (1976). The conduct must amount to \u201cdeliberate indifference.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 104. Generally, Federal courts have held that even gross negligence falls short of \u201cdeliberate indifference.\u201d <em>Shockley </em>v. <em>Jones, </em>823 F.2d 1068, 1072 (7th Cir. 1987).</p>\n<p id=\"b71-6\">On appeal, the plaintiffs argue that Karen\u2019s right under the Fourth Amendment to the United States Constitution to be secure against unreasonable seizure of her person was violated because she was involuntarily committed to the hospital. The plaintiffs made very brief mention during the trial that they were asserting rights under the Fourth, Fifth and Fourteenth Amendments. They concede that the issue was not specifically presented to the jury. While their pleading listed the Fourth Amendment as one source of Karen\u2019s constitutional rights, there was no reference to Karen\u2019s being unconstitutionally \u201cseized\u201d in their motion for directed verdict, their request for jury instructions or their special jury questions. Some evidence about the nature of Karen\u2019s commitment was introduced, but because the seizure issue was not argued at trial, we shall not consider it on appeal. <em>Leardi </em>v. <em>Brown, </em>394 Mass. 151, 155 (1985).</p>\n<p id=\"b71-7\">4. <em>New trial. </em>The defendants charge that the trial judge made several errors in his instructions to the jury and in his evidentiary rulings. We have examined each claim of error <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"54\">*54</page-number>and conclude the judge did not abuse his discretion and properly denied the motions for a new trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b72-5\">First, it was not prejudicial error to send every issue to the jury. Judicial economy is promoted when a trial judge, in a case in which it is a close question whether the standard for directed verdict is met, allows a matter to go to the jury. <em>Smith </em>v. <em>Ariens Co., </em>375 Mass. 620, 627 (1978).<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> The defendants contend the jury was confused by the number of issues, as evidenced by the fact it took seven days of deliberations to reach a verdict. The length of time the jury deliberated is not enough to show confusion. The jurors in this case were assisted by special questions<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> and their answers to those questions were not internally inconsistent.</p>\n<p id=\"b72-6\">The defendants also claim that the judge improperly instructed the jury on the inferences they could draw. In both instances, the inferences were reasonable<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> *****16and were qualified by statements that the jurors were not required to draw those inferences. The instructions were fair. <em>Pfeiffer </em>v. <em>Salas, </em>360 Mass. 93, 100 (1971).</p>\n<p id=\"b72-7\">The judge committed no error in admitting the testimony of the plaintiffs\u2019 expert, Dr. Nelson, and in admitting hearsay <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"55\">*55</page-number>testimony offered by the decedent\u2019s boy friend. The Commonwealth argues that Dr. Nelson\u2019s opinion lacked a foundation because it was based solely on a review of medical records. Dr. Nelson qualified his opinion, however, by stating that he was commenting only on the treatment as documented in the medical records. In this case, the source of the expert\u2019s opinion goes to its weight, not its admissibility. See <em>Bernier </em>v. <em>Boston Edison Co., </em>380 Mass. 372, 381 (1980).</p>\n<p id=\"b73-5\">The Commonwealth also challenges the admission of testimony that on December 16, 1980, Karen\u2019s boy friend informed an unnamed ward attendant who let him out of the locked ward that Karen told him she had just tried to choke herself with a towel. This statement was admitted to show that hospital staff had been alerted to the possibility Karen was suicidal, and not to show that Karen actually tried to harm herself. See <em>Seelig </em>v. <em>Harvard Coop. Soc\u2019y, </em>355 Mass. 532, 540 (1969).</p>\n<p id=\"b73-6\">Finally, there is no merit in the defendants\u2019 claim that the judge erred in allowing the plaintiffs\u2019 motion for a directed verdict on the issue of Karen\u2019s comparative negligence. Mentally ill people who are capable of forming an intent and who actually do intend an act that causes damage will be held liable for that damage. <em>McGuire </em>v. <em>Almy, </em>297 Mass. 323, 328 (1937). It follows that a mentally ill person can be comparatively negligent in some circumstances. See <em>id. </em>This court has not before examined the question of comparative negligence arising out of conduct for which a person has been hospitalized or committed. We join a number of courts in holding there can be no comparative negligence where the defendant\u2019s duty of care includes preventing the self-abusive or self-destructive acts that caused the plaintiff\u2019s injury. <em>Cowan </em>v. <em>Doering, </em>111 N.J. 451, 462 (1988), and cases cited. Clearly, the duty of care that the defendants owed to an institutionalized patient such as Karen McNamara included taking reasonable steps to prevent her suicide when it was a known or foreseeable risk. To allow the defense of comparative negligence in these circumstances would render meaningless the duty of the hospital to act reasonably in pro<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"56\">*56</page-number>tecting the patient against self-harm. <em>Cowan, supra </em>at 467. Accordingly, the Superior Court judge did <em>not err </em>in allowing motions for directed verdict as to Karen\u2019s alleged comparative negligence.</p>\n<p id=\"b74-5\">\n<em>Judgment affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b63-8\"> This was the trial judge\u2019s second entry of judgment.

This court need not pass upon questions or issues not argued in the brief. Mass.

The primary question in this case is whether the evidence was sufficient to warrant a finding that negligence on the part of the defendant Honeyman caused or contributed to cause the suicide of Karen McNamara. The court has concluded that the testimony of the plaintiffs\u2019 expert, Dr. Michael Nelson, \u201cfairly read, when considered with the other evidence in the plaintiffs\u2019 favor concerning Karen\u2019s behavior and condition, warranted a finding that Honeyman deviated from accepted medical practice expected of a psychiatrist. . . by removing Karen from one-on-one observation,\u201d and that that deviation \u201cwas the proximate cause of her death.\u201d <em>Ante </em>at 51. I do not agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b74-7\">The court characterizes Karen\u2019s conduct on several occasions as \u201cself-destructive,\u201d and informs us that, at least twice, members of the hospital staff placed her on one-on-one observation. She was on one-on-one observation from December 2, 1980, until Honeyman removed her from that status on December 16. It is not entirely clear what importance the court attaches to that evidence, or to the further evidence that, on December 16, Karen\u2019s boy friend informed a hospital staff member (not shown to have been Honeyman or to have passed the information along to Honeyman) that Karen had claimed to have attempted suicide that day. Also, it is unclear what significance the court attributes to the evidence that, shortly before her death, .Karen presented herself to a staff meeting attended by Honeyman and, \u201c [although she <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"57\">*57</page-number>seemed anxious and distressed, she was sent away.\u201d<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> In any event, that evidence does not pass the test for sufficiency set out in <em>Brune </em>v. <em>Belinkoff, </em>354 Mass. 102, 109 (1968) and its progeny. See <em>Stepakoff </em>v. <em>Kantar, </em>393 Mass. 836, 840 (1985). Surely, the recited evidence, unsupplemented by adequate expert testimony, would not have warranted the jury in finding that Honeyman, in removing Karen from one-on-one observation, or in failing to predict and prevent Karen\u2019s suicide, failed to exercise the degree of skill and care customarily exercised by the average qualified psychiatrist in the circumstances.</p>\n<p id=\"b75-5\">The court\u2019s expressed conclusion that Nelson\u2019s testimony in conjunction with other evidence supports the finding of negligence implies, if it does not explicitly state, the court\u2019s recognition that Nelson\u2019s testimony was critical. Therefore, fair appellate review demands careful analysis of Nelson\u2019s testimony, a type of analysis, I suggest, that is not present in the court\u2019s opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b75-6\">Nowhere in his testimony did Nelson even suggest that, in Honeyman\u2019s treatment and supervision of Karen, and aside from record-keeping, Honeyman deviated from accepted medical practice. Nelson did not testify, either explicitly or implicitly, that Honeyman had failed to treat Karen with the skill and care that would have been exercised by an average competent psychiatrist. Rather, as is demonstrated by the following excerpt from the record, Nelson focused on what he perceived to be Honeyman\u2019s faulty record-keeping. He testified that \u201cgood medical practice\u201d requires documentation of many kinds of information including information about the level of patient supervision required from time to time and about the reasons for changing the intensity of supervision whenever changes are deemed appropriate. He also testified that Honeyman\u2019s documentation fell below the stan<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"58\">*58</page-number>dard of \u201cgood medical practice,\u201d and that the reason good documentation is required is that the patient receives care from a variety of people working at different times of the day, and close, accurate communication between them is essential. Nelson testified on direct examination as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b76-5\">Q. \u201cIn your opinion, did Dr. Honeyman\u2019s treatment of Karen McNamara, <em>as documented, </em>comport with good medical practice?\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b76-6\">A. <em>\u201cAs documented, </em>no.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b76-7\">Q. \u201cWhat is your basis for that opinion?\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b76-8\">A. \u201cExamination of the record.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b76-9\">Q. \u201cWhat in the record led you to conclude that his treatment of Karen McNamara, <em>as documented, </em>did not comport with good medical practice?\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b76-10\">A. \u201cThere was no admission history by Dr. Honeyman. Review of her previous record. There was no treatment plan. There was no regular review of the treatment plan. There was no consistent pattern of recorded observations in the progress notes. There was no recorded discussions by the staff concerning Dr. Honeyman\u2019s decisions to change observational status. There was no assessment documented according to the rationale in many cases from one status to another. There was no documentation of the steps that should have been established prior to Karen McNamara\u2019s discharge to the Hill Program and there was no documentation of her status on return.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b76-11\">Q. \u201cNow, do you also have an opinion, sir, as to whether Dr. Honeyman\u2019s failure to comport with good medical practice contributed to Karen McNamara\u2019s death?\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b76-12\">A. \u201cYes.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b76-13\">Q. \u201cWhat is that opinion?\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b76-14\">A. \u201cHis failure to comport to good medical practice, <em>as documented, </em>did contribute to her death.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b76-15\">Nelson also was asked, \u201cDo you have an opinion as to the extent of Dr. Honeyman\u2019s deviation from good medical practice?\u201d Nelson answered, <em>\u201cAs </em>documented'?\u201d The plaintiffs\u2019 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"59\">*59</page-number>counsel said, <em>\u201cAs </em>documented.\u201d Nelson answered, \u201cSignificant.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b77-6\">On cross-examination, the following questions were asked and answers given:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b77-7\">Q. \u201cIf it were a fact, whether it was documented or not in the record, that the team meetings that were held three times a week during Karen\u2019s admission, if it were a fact that her behavior and condition and treatment and plans for her treatment in the future were discussed at those team meetings, would that tend to change that opinion about Dr. Honeyman\u2019s treatment?\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b77-8\">A. \u201cThat would tend to change my opinion, with a proviso.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b77-9\">Q. \u201cWith a proviso?\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b77-10\">A. \u201cYes, That proviso is that documentation is part of good medical practice.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b77-11\">Plaintiffs\u2019 counsel carefully inquired of Nelson about Honeyman\u2019s treatment of Karen \u201cas documented,\u201d and Nelson\u2019s answers were expressly limited in the same way. Indeed, when, on one occasion, counsel asked whether Nelson had an opinion about whether \u201cDr. Honeyman\u2019s failure to comport with good medical practice contributed to Karen\u2019s death,\u201d Nelson answered, \u201cyes,\u201d and, when asked for that opinion, his answer was that Honeyman\u2019s \u201cfailure to comport to good medical practice, <em>as documented, </em>did contribute to her death\u201d (emphasis added). Nelson supplied the limitation that had been omitted from the question. As the court acknowledges in its \u201cNew trial\u201d discussion, <em>ante </em>at 55, \u201cDr. Nelson qualified his opinion ... by stating that he was commenting only on the treatment as documented in the medical records.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b77-12\">One point must be made crystal clear. Nothing in Nelson\u2019s testimony remotely suggests that there was information in the hospital records that demonstrated Honeyman\u2019s negligence. Rather, Nelson\u2019s testimony can only reasonably be understood to mean that, if the treatment and supervision actually given were limited to what was contained in the records, and one were to conclude that Honeyman had failed <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"60\">*60</page-number>to take an admission history, had failed to review prior records, had failed to establish a treatment plan, had failed to regularly observe the patient, and had had no discussion with the staff, because those events were not documented, then his performance did not comport with good medical practice. Such testimony does not help the plaintiffs because there was no evidence that Honeyman\u2019s performance was limited to whatever was recorded in the hospital charts. Surely, the jury would not have been warranted in inferring from Honeyman\u2019s recording failures that he had not established a treatment plan or done other undocumented things. Even if Honeyman\u2019s testimony as to all he had done were disbelieved by the jury, the jury could only have speculated as to whether Honeyman had failed with respect to treatment or had failed with respect to record-keeping only. Neither the court nor anyone else suggests, nor could fairly suggest, that the jury would have been warranted in finding that Honeyman\u2019s negligent record-keeping had anything to do with Karen McNamara\u2019s suicide.</p>\n<p id=\"b78-5\">The court\u2019s reasoning, as set forth in its opinion, with respect to the question of the sufficiency of the evidence to establish Honeyman\u2019s negligence, is brief. The court notes, <em>ante </em>at 51, Nelson\u2019s testimony that, \u201cas described in the records,\u201d Karen\u2019s behavior was out of control throughout her hospital stay, that Nelson would not consider her stabilized in the absence of two or three weeks of consistent safe behavior, that fifteen-minute checks were \u201cnot sufficient to manage her condition,\u201d and that Karen\u2019s death was \u201cpreventable\u201d if Karen had been kept on one-on-one observation. The court concludes, <em>ante </em>at 51, without reference to any other expert testimony, that \u201c[a] juror could, then, have inferred from Dr. Nelson\u2019s testimony that Honeyman\u2019s negligence in failing to keep Karen on one-on-one observation was the proximate cause of her death.\u201d Certainly, it is true that the jury properly could have found that, had Karen been kept on one-on-one observation status, the suicide probably would not have occurred. The critical flaw, however, in the plaintiffs\u2019 case and in the court\u2019s determination, is that Nelson did not tes<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"61\">*61</page-number>tify that Honeyman\u2019s decision to remove Karen from one-on-one observation fell below the standard set by the average competent psychiatrist. See <em>Stepakoff </em>v. <em>Kantar, </em>393 Mass. 836, 840 (1985); <em>Brune </em>v. <em>Belinkoff, </em>354 Mass. 102, 109 (1968). Nelson focused, not on negligence in treatment, but on causation only. Surely, the unhappy fact that, as things turned out, fifteen-minute checks \u201cwere not sufficient to manage [Karen\u2019s] condition,\u201d that is, to keep her from committing suicide, does not permit the conclusion that Honeyman\u2019s management of Karen was less than ought to be expected of an average competent psychiatrist. Surely, also, the jury could not reasonably have interpreted Nelson\u2019s testimony as measuring Honeyman\u2019s conduct against the <em>Brune </em>v. <em>Belinkoff </em>standard.</p>\n<p id=\"b79-5\">The evidence was insufficient to warrant a finding of Honeyman\u2019s negligence except, perhaps, with respect to record-keeping. The evidence was insufficient to show any causal connection between faulty record-keeping and Karen McNamara\u2019s death. No other adequate evidence of negligence attributable to the defendant hospital is demonstrated in the court\u2019s opinion, and I am unaware of any. No other ground for recovery against either defendant has been established. Therefore, I would reverse the judgment and order judgment for the defendants.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b75-7\"> The testimony by a treatment team member named Walsh was that, while the team was engaged in a meeting at the east end of a nurse\u2019s station, Karen came to the door, and that someone opened the door and asked her to wait. The record is bereft of evidence that Honeyman saw Karen or was made aware of her presence.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
