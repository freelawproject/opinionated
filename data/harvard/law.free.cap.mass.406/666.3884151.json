The settlement required the plaintiffs to dismiss their claims <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"667\">*667</page-number>in exchange for $584,000. The money was placed in an interest-bearing account for the benefit of the plaintiffs to be held by Coggins\u2019s counsel.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b685-5\">Thereafter, the plaintiffs filed a motion for fees and costs to be assessed against the defendants, as a matter of law, claiming as grounds that \u201c[pjlaintiffs derivative count for waste of corporate assets brought against the individual defendants was reinstated. <em>Coggins </em>at 540. . . . Well-established Massachusetts law supports the assessment of plaintiff shareholders\u2019 attorneys\u2019 fees and expenses against the defendants in a successful derivative action.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b685-6\">After hearing, the judge denied the plaintiffs\u2019 application for fees and expenses to be assessed against the defendants. The Superior Court judge concluded that \u201c[a] fair reading of <em>[Coggins </em>/] leaves this Court with the firm and definite conclusion that the higher court ordered the derivative claim \u2018reinstated,\u2019 [397 Mass.] at 540, solely to permit a reconstructive calculation of the rescissory damages, and not as a calculation of corporate damages.\u201d<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> The judge approved the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"668\">*668</page-number>settlement of the class action and ordered the defendants to pay $584,000 into the settlement fund. The judge dismissed all claims on the merits and with prejudice, except the plaintiffs\u2019 claim for payment by the defendants of attorneys\u2019 fees and expenses, which remained open for further determination.</p>\n<p id=\"b686-4\">The plaintiffs\u2019 counsel then filed a petition for an award of attorneys\u2019 fees and expenses totalling' $380,000 to be paid from the class recovery of $584,000. Counsel reserved their right to petition for the full value of their fees and expenses, asserted to be $816,500, if the order denying an award from the defendants were reversed on appeal. After another hearing, the judge issued an order awarding the plaintiffs\u2019 counsel $220,550 for fees and expenses and ordering the remaining amount of the settlement fund, including accumulated interest, to be paid pro rata to members of the plaintiff class.</p>\n<p id=\"b686-5\">The judge entered a judgment (1) approving settlement of the class action; (2) denying the plaintiffs\u2019 application for fees and expenses to be assessed against the defendants, as ordered on February 3, 1987; and (3) ordering disbursement of the settlement fund. The plaintiffs appealed from the judgment. We granted the plaintiffs\u2019 application for direct appellate review. On appeal, the plaintiffs argue that it was error to deny their application for the assessment of fees and expenses against the defendants<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> because they prevailed on a derivative claim. We conclude there is no error in the judge\u2019s ruling.</p>\n<p id=\"b687-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"669\">*669</page-number>Attorneys\u2019 fees may be awarded, in the judge\u2019s discretion, to a party who has successfully brought a derivative action on behalf of a corporation, see <em>Dynan </em>v. Fritz, 400 Mass. 230, 249 (1987); <em>Wilson </em>v. <em>Jennings, </em>344 Mass. 608, 621 (1962); <em>Shaw </em>v. <em>Harding, </em>306 Mass. 441, 450 (1940); <em>Sagalyn </em>v. <em>Meekins, Packard &amp; Wheat Inc., </em>290 Mass. 434, 440 (1935), but, \u201cno recovery may be had for counsel fees in the very action to redress a plaintiff\u2019s wrong,\u201d <em>Donaldson </em>v. <em>Boston Herald-Traveler Corp., </em>347 Mass. 274, 280 (1964).</p>\n<p id=\"b687-5\">Where a party \u201chas, at his or her own expense, been successful in creating, preserving or enlarging a fund in which other parties have a rightful share,\u201d a court may order the payment of attorneys\u2019 fees and expenses out of the fund as part of a damages award. <em>Pearson </em>v. <em>Board of Health of Chicopee, </em>402 Mass. 797, 801 n.3 (1988). See <em>Bournewood Hosp., Inc. </em>v. <em>Massachusetts Comm\u2019n Against Discrimination, </em>371 Mass. 303, 308-313 (1976); <em>Commissioner of Ins. </em>v. <em>Massachusetts Accident Co., </em>318 Mass. 238, 242 (1945). Such \u201can allowance is discretionary and not a matter of strict right.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 243. We conclude that there was no error in the judge\u2019s exercise of his discretion in ordering payment of the plaintiffs\u2019 attorneys\u2019 fees and expenses out of the settlement fund, the only fund \u00e1ctually existing in this case.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b687-6\">The plaintiffs claim that the judge erred by not making such an award from a much larger, albeit fictional and nonexistent, \u201ccommon fund.\u201d They assert that \u201c[a]s a result of this Court\u2019s reinstatement of the plaintiffs\u2019 derivative count and ruling [in <em>Coggins I\\ </em>awarding damages as if rescission had occurred, a recovery for the corporation became inevitable\u201d; that they prevailed on the derivative count and thus are <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"670\">*670</page-number>entitled to an award of fees and expenses from the defendants; and that \u201c[t]he award . . . should be assessed against the fund which would have been recovered by the corporation had rescission actually occurred.\u201d<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b688-5\">The plaintiffs repeatedly characterize the result in <em>Coggins I </em>as a \u201csuccessful\u201d derivative action and claim that they have \u201cprevailed\u201d on their derivative count. This argument assumes the very issue that is the subject of the instant dispute \u2014 whether <em>Coggins I </em>reinstated the derivative count as a \u201clive\u201d issue or reinstated it for the limited purpose of calculating rescissory damages to be awarded to the plaintiffs as the prevailing parties of their class action claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b688-6\">The plaintiffs did <em>not </em>bring a successful derivative action, but were granted recovery based on their personal class action and awarded damages directly. Cf. <em>Sugarman </em>v. Sugarman, 797 F.2d 3, 15 (1st Cir. 1986). The derivative count was reinstated only to determine the amount of the class recovery. Reinstatement of the derivative claim and the award of rescissory damages \u201cas if rescission had occurred\u201d does not automatically result in an \u201cinevitable\u201d derivative recovery by the corporation.</p>\n<p id=\"b688-7\">The complaint in <em>Coggins I </em>further supports the judge\u2019s ruling. The complaint contained two counts. Count one was a class action alleging that the individual defendants caused the merger, which in turn constituted a breach of the fiduciary duty they owed to Coggins and the Coggins class. Count two was a derivative action alleging waste of corporate assets. By way of remedy, the complaint requested (1) that the merger be rescinded; (2) that the individual defendants be ordered to account to the corporation for all of the wasted assets described in the derivative claim; and (3) that the defendants be ordered to pay the plaintiffs\u2019 attorneys\u2019 fees and expenses. The analysis in <em>Coggins I </em>is directed exclusively at the allegations contained in the class action claim and at the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"671\">*671</page-number>proper method for determining the class\u2019s remedy. The language in <em>Coggins I, </em>see note 4, <em>supra, </em>suggests that we reversed the dismissal of the derivative count not for the purpose of ordering a derivative recovery to the corporation, but for the limited purpose of calculating the present value of the Patriots in order to determine the aliquot share of the present assets due each share of stock held by members of the Cog-gins class as rescissory damages for prevailing in their class action. Nothing in <em>Coggins I </em>addressed the allegations in the derivative claim<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> or ordered the individual defendants to make an accounting to the corporation.</p>\n<p id=\"b689-5\">At trial, the Superior Court judge found for the plaintiffs on the class action claim. In determining the remedy, he ordered rescissory damages and dismissed the derivative claim, concluding that \u201c[s]ince the Old Patriots will not be resuscitated, there is no occasion to further consider the [derivative] claim .... Since that claim attacks various expenses incurred in connection with the merger, and since the merger expenses are for the purpose of an appraisal of the stock for the calculation of rescissory damages, not chargeable against the net assets of the corporation, those expenses will not in any way diminish the plaintiffs\u2019 recovery.\u201d A second Superior Court judge concluded that the derivative claim was dismissed in the context of ordering rescissory damages to the plaintiffs as the prevailing parties on their class action claim. Consistent with that conclusion, he determined that the derivative claim was \u201creinstated\u201d for the same limited purpose of determining the <em>class </em>recovery.</p>\n<p id=\"b689-6\">The plaintiffs also argue that \u201c[t]he fact that the corporation did not obtain an identifiable monetary recovery as a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"672\">*672</page-number>result of the passage of time is inconsequential because this court [in <em>Coggins </em>/] unambiguously stated that such passage of time should be ignored in assessing rescissory damages.\u201d Even if <em>Coggins I </em>did reinstate the derivative count as a live issue, we cannot say that the judge abused his discretion in declining to award fees from the hypothetical, nonexistent \u201ccommon fund\u201d that the plaintiffs \u201cidentify.\u201d The judge\u2019s decision was in accordance with the law of this Commonwealth. Attorneys\u2019 fees and costs \u201cought to be payable only out of the proceeds of the suit received by the corporation [from the defendant] .... [I] f no funds [are] due to the corporation, no allowance should be made for fees or disbursements of counsel.\u201d <em>Shaw, supra </em>at 450-451.</p>\n<p id=\"b690-5\">\n<em>Judgment affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b685-7\"> Throughout this opinion, the terms \u201cCoggins class,\u201d \u201cplaintiff class,\u201d and \u201cplaintiffs\u201d are used interchangeably.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b685-9\"> In <em>Coggins </em>/, we said that, although \u201cthe normally appropriate remedy for an impermissible freeze-out merger is rescission,\u201d in the circumstances of this case, rescission would be inequitable and the plaintiffs\u2019 remedy should be an assessment of damages. <em>Id. </em>at 535-536. We continued by stating that \u201c[w]e do not think it appropriate, however, to award damages based on a 1976 appraisal value .... Rescissory damages must be determined based on the present value of the Patriots, that is, what the stockholders would have if the merger were rescinded .... Each share of the Coggins class is to receive, as rescissory damages, its aliquot share of the present assets.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 536-537. We concluded by noting that \u201c[t]he trial judge dismissed the plaintiffs\u2019 [derivative] claims against the individual defendants based on waste of corporate assets. The remedy we order is intended to give the plaintiffs what they would have if the merger were undone and the corporation were put back together again .... We reverse the dismissal of the [derivative] claim for waste of corporate assets and remand this question to the trial court. The present value of the Patriots, as determined on remand, should include the amount wrongfully removed or diverted from the corporate coffers by the individual defendants.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 537. \u201c[W]e remand[ed] for a determination of the present value of the nonvoting stock, as though the merger were rescinded. The claim for waste of corporate assets ... is reinstated.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 540.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b686-6\"> The plaintiffs also argue that, \u201c[i]f this court orders the defendants to reimburse [the] plaintiffs for their attorneys\u2019 fees and expenses ... it would be appropriate for the [c]curt similarly to review several [alleged] errors of law made by the trial judge in ruling on [the] plaintiffs\u2019 application for attorneys\u2019 fees.\u201d Specifically, the plaintiffs claim error in the judge\u2019s refusal to apply current hourly rates for hours worked in the past; his disallowance of separate charges for work performed by summer associates and paralegals; and his exclusion of charges for computer-assisted legal research and word processing. Because we do not order the defendants to pay the plaintiffs\u2019 counsel fees and expenses, we do not reach this question.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b687-7\"> The settlement fund was ordered disbursed as follows:</p>\n<p id=\"b687-8\">Members of the plaintiff class, pro rata: $363,450.00</p>\n<p id=\"b687-9\">(amounts to $158.64 per share of stock)</p>\n<p id=\"b687-10\">Nutter, McClennen &amp; Fish for counsel fees: 191,280.00</p>\n<p id=\"b687-11\">Glass &amp; Brooks for counsel fees: 8,720.00</p>\n<p id=\"b687-12\">Nutter, McClennen &amp; Fish for allowed expenses: 20,550.00</p>\n<p id=\"b687-13\">$584,000.00</p>\n<p id=\"b687-14\">Accumulated interest was ordered to be paid to the members of the plaintiff class, pro rata.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b688-8\"> The plaintiffs define this fictional \u201ccommon fund\u201d as \u201cfunds wrongfully removed from the Patriots and specifically ordered quantified in any damages trial, even if never actually paid to the corporation.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b689-7\"> The derivative claim alleged that the individual defendants violated provisions in the articles of organization or charter restricting the transfer of stock; wasted corporate assets causing the enactment of St. 1976, c. 327; caused the corporation to expend considerable sums of money in connection with the proxy solicitation; wasted corporate assets in causing the merger; and converted a valuable asset belonging to the Old Patriots by allowing the New Patriots to use the corporate name \u201cNew England Patriots Football Club, Inc.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
