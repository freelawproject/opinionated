A jury awarded the plaintiff $500,000 for wrongful death and $50,000 for conscious suffering. A judgment was entered in the sum of $550,000 \u201cwith interest thereon from July 30, 1981 [the date the action was commenced], as provided by law, with costs.\u201d This court affirmed the judgment on appeal. <em>Sharpe </em>v. <em>Peter Pan Bus Lines, Inc., </em>401 Mass. 788 (1988). The issue in the present appeal is what is the appropriate rate of prejudgment and postjudgment interest.</p>\n<p id=\"b81-5\">The plaintiff obtained an execution for $1,060,680.77 based on prejudgment and postjudgment interest on the $550,000 verdicts at an annual rate of 12%. The defendants moved for correction of an alleged clerical error in the calculation of interest, asserting that the correct rate of prejudgment and postjudgment interest was 6%. A judge of the Superior Court allowed the defendants\u2019 motion and ordered that the entire interest be computed at 6%. The plaintiff appealed, and we allowed his application for direct appellate review. We affirm the decision below.</p>\n<p id=\"b81-6\">Before its revision by St. 1988, c. 223, \u00a7 1,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> G. L. c. 229, \u00a7 11 (1986 ed.), provided that \u201c[i]n any civil action in which a verdict is given or a finding made for pecuniary damages for the death, with or without conscious suffering, of any person . . . there shall be added by the clerk of the court to the amount of the damages interest thereon from the date of the commencement of the action . ...\u201d In <em>MacCuish </em>v. <em>Volkswagenwerk A.G., </em>22 Mass. App. Ct. 380, 399-400 (1986), a wrongful death action, the Appeals Court affirmed the judgment of the Superior Court with two relatively minor modifications, one of which had to do with the computation of prejudgment interest. The trial judge had denied a motion to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"64\">*64</page-number>correct judgment brought after the clerk had computed the interest at a 12% rate. The Appeals Court ruled the denial of the motion was error, reasoning that G. L. c. 229, \u00a7 11, was controlling, and that, since \u00a7 11 did not specify a rate of interest, G. L. c. 107, \u00a7 3 (1988 ed.), providing for interest at 6%, applied. The Appeals Court remanded the case to the Superior Court for recomputation of the interest at the rate of 6%. We granted the defendants\u2019 application for further appellate review, and then unanimously approved the Appeals Court\u2019s opinion and order modifying the Superior Court judgment to reflect interest at 6 %. As modified, we affirmed the judgment by an evenly divided court (three to three). <em>MacCuish </em>v. <em>Volkswagenwerk A.G., </em>400 Mass. 1003 (1987). See <em>Perkins School for the Blind </em>v. <em>Rate Setting Comm\u2019n, </em>383 Mass. 825, 835-836 (1981); <em>Turcotte </em>v. <em>DeWitt, </em>333 Mass. 389, 391-392 (1955).</p>\n<p id=\"b82-5\">Our view has not changed since our decision in <em>MacCuish. </em>The plaintiff argues that G. L. c. 231, \u00a7 6B (1988 ed.), governs the computation of prejudgment interest in wrongful death actions regardless whether the damages were assessed before the effective date of St. 1988, c. 223, \u00a7 1 (see note 3, <em>supra). </em>We do not agree. Section 6B provides for a 12% prejudgment interest rate on verdicts for \u201cpecuniary damages for personal injuries to the plaintiff or for consequential damages, or for damage to property.\u201d Ignoring G. L. c. 229, \u00a7 11, the plaintiff contends that damages for wrongful death are within the meaning of the words, \u201cpecuniary damages for personal injuries,\u201d in \u00a7 6B. Chapter 229, \u00a7 11, cannot properly be ignored. Furthermore, as we have previously observed, it is apparent from numerous statutes that \u201cordinarily the Legislature does not intend that the word \u2018injury\u2019 should include death.\u201d <em>Grass </em>v. <em>Catamount Dev. Corp., </em>390 Mass. 551, 554 (1983). Nothing in the language or history of G. L. c. 231, \u00a7 6B, suggests that \u00a7 6B is an exception to that rule. The Legislature has provided for prejudgment interest in wrongful death actions in G. L. c. 229, \u00a711, and for pr\u00e9<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"65\">*65</page-number>judgment interest in personal injury actions in G. L. c. 231, \u00a7 6B.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b83-5\">The plaintiff next argues that, even if he is not entitled to prejudgment interest computed at an annual rate of 12 % on the wrongful death, he is entitled to interest at that rate on the damages awarded for conscious suffering. Conscious suffering, he argues, is surely \u201cpersonal injur [y]\u201d within the meaning of G. L. c. 231, \u00a7 6B. The plaintiff\u2019s argument, however, fails to address the legislative scheme set out in G. L. c. 229. Chapter 229, \u00a7 6, provides that, in an action for wrongful death, damages may also be recovered for conscious suffering. Section 11 of the same chapter provides that \u201c[i]n any civil action ... for pecuniary damages for the death, with or without conscious suffering, of any person,\u201d prejudgment interest shall be added. The instant action is a civil action for pecuniary damages for death with conscious suffering. It clearly falls within G. L. c. 229, \u00a7 11, and therefore, as discussed above, the proper rate of interest is 6% as provided in G. L. c. 107, \u00a7 3.</p>\n<p id=\"b83-6\">We turn to the question of postjudgment interest. Postjudgment interest is governed by G. L. c. 235, \u00a7 8 (1988 ed.). Section 8 provides that \u201c[ejvery judgment for the payment of money shall bear interest from the day of its entry at the same rate per annum as provided for prejudgment interest in such award, report, verdict or finding.\u201d In this case, that rate is 6%. In support of his contention that he is entitled to postjudgment interest at a 12% rate, the plaintiff asserts that, since c. 235, \u00a7 8, does not provide a specific interest rate, the provisions of c. 231, \u00a7 6H, apply. Section 6H <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"66\">*66</page-number>provides that \u201c[i]n any action in which damages are awarded, <em>but in which interest on said damages is not otherwise provided by law, </em>there shall be added ... to the amount of damages interest thereon at the rate provided by section six B . . .\u201d (emphasis added). Section 6H does not help the plaintiff. Even if \u00a7 6H should be interpreted to apply to postjudgment interest, which is far from clear, \u00a7 6H, by its terms, applies only to actions in which interest on damages \u201cis not otherwise provided.\u201d This is not such an action. Furthermore, \u00a7 6H was inserted in c. 231 by St. 1983, c. 652, \u00a7 1, and applies only to actions commenced after March 19, 1984. This action was commenced in 1981.</p>\n<p id=\"b84-6\">The decision in the Superior Court awarding prejudgment and postjudgment interest at the rate of 6% is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"pA34\"><em>_So </em>ordered._</p>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b81-7\"> As appearing in St. 1988, c. 223, \u00a7 1, G. L. c. 229, \u00a7 11, provides that the clerk should include interest \u201cat the same rate . . . per annum as provided in section six B of chapter two hundred and thirty-one.\u201d The amendment, however, does not apply to this case because, by its terms, it applies only to actions \u201cin which damages are assessed on or after the effective date\u201d of the amendment. St. 1988, c. 223, \u00a7 2. Damages were assessed in this case in July, 1986.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b83-7\"> The plaintiff also asserts that G. L. c. 231, \u00a7 6B, controls because a wrongful death action is designed to compensate the deceased\u2019s next of kin for damage to property within the meaning of \u00a7 6B. The alleged property damage is the next of kin\u2019s loss of the \u201creasonably expected net income, services, protection, care, assistance, society, companionship, comfort, guidance, counsel and advice of the decedent. . [G. L.] c. 229, \u00a7 2.\u201d Even if the plaintiff\u2019s assertion, unsupported by reasoning or citation of authority, be deemed an \u201cargument\u201d within the meaning of Mass. R. A. P. 16 (a) (4), as amended, 367 Mass. 921 (1975), it is without merit and we reject it.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
