The commissioner had denied the bank\u2019s application for an abatement of its Massachusetts excise tax for 1983.</p>\n<p id=\"b213-14\">We summarize the stipulated facts presented to the board. In 1983, the bank was subject to an excise tax imposed on banking associations pursuant to G. L. c. 63, \u00a7\u00a7 1 and 2 (1984 ed.). Under the terms of c. 63, each banking association must pay to the Commonwealth an excise tax equal to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"196\">*196</page-number>12.54% of the bank\u2019s net income.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> General Laws c. 63, \u00a7 1, defines net income as \u201cthe gross income from all sources, without exclusion, for the taxable year, <em>less the deductions, but not credits, allowable under the provisions of the Federal Internal Revenue </em>Code\u201d (emphasis added). Accordingly, the Massachusetts excise tax return for 1983 (form 63 BTC) calculates a bank\u2019s excise tax from the sum of the net income reported by the bank on line 28 of its United States corporation income tax return for 1983 (Federal form 1120), and any State and municipal bond interest not subject to Federal taxation.</p>\n<p id=\"b214-5\">Prior to 1982, the Federal Internal Revenue Code (Code), allowed banks to deduct interest (interest) paid on indebtedness incurred in order to purchase or carry obligations, even though these obligations, such as State and municipal bonds, produced income which was exempt from Federal tax (interest income).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Congress became concerned that banks were receiving a double tax benefit, in that they were allowed to deduct interest payments which produced tax-free income. In 1982, Congress passed the Tax Equity and Fiscal Responsibility Act which reduced by 15 % any deductions relating to a \u201cfinancial institution preference item,\u201d which was defined to include interest \u201cexempt from taxes.\u201d<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> 26 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7291 (a)(3), 291 (e)(l)(B)(i) (1982).</p>\n<p id=\"b215-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"197\">*197</page-number>On September 15, 1984, the bank filed its Massachusetts excise tax return for the taxable year ending December 31, 1983, and paid the tax due. The bank\u2019s return reported the net income from line 28 of the bank\u2019s United States corporation income tax return, which reflected the 15% reduction. The bank filed an application for abatement with the Department of Revenue on April 16, 1985, claiming an overpayment of $82,155.56 on its 1983 excise tax.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> The commissioner denied the bank\u2019s application on February 19, 1986, holding that, because G. L. c. 63, \u00a7 1, calculates net income according to deductions \u201callowable under the provisions of the [Code],\u201d and 15% of the interest deduction is disallowed by the Code, the 15% disallowance must be applied for Massachusetts tax purposes. The bank then filed a timely appeal with the board. The board rejected the bank\u2019s claim. The bank filed a notice of appeal to the Appeals Court. We transferred the appeal to this court. We affirm the board\u2019s decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b215-5\">The sole issue before us is whether 15% of the bank\u2019s interest was properly disallowed as a deduction not \u201callowable under the provisions of the [Code].\u201d The bank states that, while the Federal disallowance looked to tax exempt income, the bank\u2019s interest income was not tax exempt because it was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"198\">*198</page-number>subject to the Massachusetts excise tax. The bank argues that, because the interest income was taxable, the deduction for interest paid to generate this interest income did not qualify as a \u201cfinancial institution preference item\u201d under the Code and was not subject to the 15% disallowance. Therefore, the bank claims that it was entitled to the full deduction of the cost of its interest as a deduction \u201callowable under the provisions of the [Code].\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b216-5\">The Constitution of the Commonwealth authorizes the imposition of an excise tax on the value of the privilege of transacting business within the Commonwealth. Part II, c. 1, \u00a7 1, art. 4. See <em>Opinion of the Justices, </em>393 Mass. 1209, 1217 (1984). The Legislature has been given broad discretion to fashion an appropriate excise tax, limited only by the State constitutional requirement that the excise levied be \u201creasonable.\u201d <em>Connecticut Mut. Life Ins. Co. </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>133 Mass. 161, 163 (1882). See <em>Andover Sav. Bank </em>v. <em>Commissioner of Revenue, </em>387 Mass. 229, 233-235 (1982).</p>\n<p id=\"b216-6\">Under the provisions of the Code, 15% of the bank\u2019s interest deduction was disallowed because the interest was paid to generate income \u201cexempt from taxes.\u201d Clearly, this Code language refers to an exemption from Federal taxes. However, the bank argues that, when this statutory language is applied to the determination of the Massachusetts bank excise tax, it must be read to refer to income exempt from Federal <em>and </em>Massachusetts taxes. General Laws c. 63, \u00a7 1, refers specifically to deductions \u201callowable under the provisions of the [Code].\u201d No language in c. 63 suggests that these provisions should be modified so as to refer to both Federal and Massachusetts taxes. Had the Legislature chosen to include such a modification in the calculation of the bank excise tax, it could have made its intention clear. <em>Industrial Fin. Corp. </em>v. <em>State Tax Comm\u2019n, </em>367 Mass. 360, 364 (1975). We decline to modify the plain meaning of G. L. c. 63, \u00a7 1. <em>Id. </em>at 364. The bank has failed to meet its burden of pointing to a particular statutory provision which requires that the full in<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"199\">*199</page-number>terest deduction be allowed. <em>Commissioner of Corps. &amp; Taxation </em>v. <em>Adams, </em>316 Mass. 484, 487 (1944).</p>\n<p id=\"b217-5\">The bank argues further that the plain meaning of the statutory language produces an unreasonable result in that the bank is forced to pay a greater tax on taxable interest income due to a disallowance provision concerned with nontaxable interest income. This argument fails to appreciate that Massachusetts has not imposed an income tax on the bank in this case, but rather an excise tax which includes net income in its calculations.</p>\n<p id=\"b217-6\">By utilizing provisions of the Federal code to calculate net income for the purposes of the bank\u2019s excise tax, the Legislature has set out \u201ca workable measure, a yardstick to calculate the value of the privilege of doing business in Massachusetts.\u201d <em>Commissioner of Revenue </em>v. <em>Massachusetts Mut. Life Ins. Co., </em>384 Mass. 607, 612 (1981). Such a measure need not reflect with absolute precision the value of doing business in the Commonwealth; \u201cfair approximations\u201d are sufficient. <em>Springfield Ins. Co. </em>v. <em>State Tax Comm\u2019n, </em>342 Mass. 505 (1961). Items which may not properly be considered for the purposes of an income tax can be considered in the calculation of an excise tax if they can reasonably be determined to be an addition to the value of doing business in the Commonwealth. <em>Commissioner of Revenue </em>v. <em>Massachusetts Mut. Life Ins. Co., supra </em>at 612, 613. Indeed, items can be considered in the valuation of the privilege of doing business in the Commonwealth even though the Commonwealth could not have taxed these items directly. <em>Springfield Ins. Co. </em>v. <em>State Tax Comm\u2019n, supra </em>at 513. Here, the Legislature chose to look to the Code and its concomitant 15% interest deduction disallowance for assistance in determining an appropriate excise tax. We cannot say that the Legislature\u2019s decision was unreasonable in relation to the value of the bank\u2019s privilege to conduct business in the Commonwealth. See <em>Andover Sav. Bank, supra </em>at 235.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b218-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"200\">*200</page-number>We discern no error of law in the board\u2019s decision.
