Claimant\u2019s alleged misconduct bore no relationship to his job performance, which was concededly satisfactory throughout the period of his employment. II. The determination that failure to reveal an arrest record constitutes <em>\u201c </em>misconduct \u201d within the meaning of subdivision 3 of section 593 of the Labor Law violates claimant\u2019s right to due process guaranteed by the Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution. <em>(Allgeyer </em>v. <em>Louisiana, </em>165 U.

The determination that failure to reveal an arrest record constitutes \u201c misconduct \u201d within the meaning of subdivision 3 of section 593 of the Labor Law deprives claimant of the equal protection of the laws guaranteed by the Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution. <em>(Royster Guano Co. </em>v. <em>Virginia, </em>253 U.

Because of this falsification, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"380\">*380</page-number>he was discharged. Upon applying for unemployment benefits, it was determined that claimant had been discharged because of misconduct in connection with his employment, and was, thus, ineligible for benefits. (Labor Law, \u00a7 593, subd. 3.)</p>\n<p id=\"b432-5\">The language of subdivision 3 of section 593 of the Labor Law is quite specific that a claimant shall be disqualified from receiving benefits where he has \u201c lost his last employment * * * through misconduct in connection with his employment \u201d. There can be little doubt that the intended meaning of the term \u201c misconduct \u201d, as used in this section, includes a willful, false statement as to a material fact on an application for employment. Certainly the employer, such as the stockbroker in this case, had a legitimate concern in knowing of a prospective employee\u2019s background, including any brushes with the law, in order to intelligently pass on his character and integrity, as well as his fitness for the position he seeks. It should be perfectly obvious that an audit clerk for a stockbroker, handling hundreds of valuable securities daily, should be trustworthy. How else can such an employer evaluate a prospective employee\u2019s trustworthiness without checking his prior conduct. Furthermore, as a member of the New York Stock Exchange, claimant\u2019s employer was required to maintain personnel records of its employees, including records of arrests (Code Fed. Reg., tit. 17, \u00a7 240.17a-3, subd. [a], par. [12], cl. [i] [1971]) and to verify those records (New York Stock Exch. Rules, rule 345.19; see <em>Thom </em>v. <em>New York Stock Exch., </em>306 F. Supp. 1002, affd. <em>sub nom. Miller </em>v. <em>New York Stock Exch., </em>425 F. 2d 1074, cert. den. 398 U. S. 905). It was also imperative for the employer to inquire as to any prior arrests when it considered claimant for employment, as the duties of an audit clerk required that he be bonded.</p>\n<p id=\"b432-7\">While it is true that the mere fact that a person has been arrested proves very little <em>(Schware </em>v. <em>Board of Bar Examiners, </em>353 U. S. 232, 241), the answer to the question concerning prior arrests determines the necessity for further inquiry and investigation.</p>\n<p id=\"b432-8\">In sum, the employer\u2019s interest required that claimant reveal the record of his arrest in this instance on his employment application in order that proper evaluation of his integrity and fitness for the position applied for could be made. Failure to do so <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"381\">*381</page-number>constituted misconduct within the purview of the Unemployment Insurance Law and thereby disqualified claimant from receiving unemployment benefits.</p>\n<p id=\"b433-4\">The order of the Appellate Division should be affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b433-5\">Chief Judge Bbeitel and Judges Gabeielli, Jones, Wachtleb, Babin and Stevens concur.</p>\n<p id=\"b433-6\">Order affirmed, without costs.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
