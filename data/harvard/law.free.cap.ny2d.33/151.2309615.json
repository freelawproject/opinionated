In the course of the accident, plaintiff apparently came into contact with a metal luggage rack or \u201c parcel grid \u201d which was affixed to the top of his motorcycle\u2019s gas tank about three inches above and two and three-quarter inches in front of the saddle. Contact with the grid \u2014 which followed immediately the initial impact between the cycle and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"154\">*154</page-number>the automobile \u2014 allegedly caused severe pelvic and genital injuries, including a resultant sterility.</p>\n<p id=\"b206-4\">In addition to the suit against the owner and operator of the automobile involved in the collision, plaintiff commenced this action against the appellants, The Triumph Corporation and Birmingham Small Arms, Ltd., r\u00e9spectively the distributor and manufacturer of his Triumph- motorcycle, contending that the placement of the parcel grid constituted a negligent defect in the design of the motorcycle which, though it admittedly did not cause the accident, aggravated, enhanced and contributed to his injuries. On three causes of action, damages are sought for negligence, breach of warranty \u00e1nd <em>\u201c </em>strict liability in tort.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b206-5\">Special Term reluctantly granted defendants\u2019 motion for summary judgment on constraint of <em>Edgar </em>v. <em>Nachman </em>(37 A D 2d 86, mot. for lv. to app. den. 29 N Y 2d 483) and <em>Campo </em>v. <em>Scofield </em>(301 N. Y. 468), noting that it is \u201c difficult to discern why automotive vehicle design defect cases should not be determined by the application of traditional rules of [tort] law \u2019 \u2019 which would place upon the manufacturer \u201c an obligation to manufacture and design the vehicle in a manner that affords <em>reasonable protection </em>under the circumstances against injuries to operators and passengers using it for the purpose for which it was intended \u201d (citing Restatement, 2d, Torts, \u00a7\u00a7 395, 398; <em>Larsen </em>v. <em>General Motors Corp., </em>391 F. 2d 495;, Harper and James, Law of Torts, Supplement to Vol. 2, pp. 213-214). Under constraint of precedent the court upheld the New York rule, which, it concluded, <em>\u201c </em>limits the liability of the car manufacturer to unsafe design characteristics which are the cause of the accident in which the injuries are sustained and immunizes the manufacturers from any liability for design defects which only aggravate the damages \u201d (citing <em>Edgar, </em>supra; <em>Campo, supra). \u201c </em>[I]t is the teaching of <em>Edgar </em>\u201d, Special Term continued, <em>\u201c </em>that the liability of the' manufacturer does not extend to injuries sustained as a consequence of <em>\u2018 </em>the second collision \u2019 [i.e., that between the user of the vehicle and the vehicle itself, which occurs as a result of the initial impact] * * * In the instant case * * * the head-on collision of the moving vehicles was obviously the direct cause of the injuries as well as the accident and the \u2018 second collision rule \u2019 mandates dismissal \u201d, Moreover, the court felt that, as in <em>Edgar </em>v. <em>Nachman </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"155\">*155</page-number><em>(supra), </em>the design defect in this case was <em>not \u201c </em>latent or concealed.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b207-5\">The Appellate Division, by a 3-2 vote, reversed Special Term\u2019s order and denied the defendants\u2019 motion for summary judgment. Both the majority and the dissent rejected the \u201c second collision rule \u201d as a bar to the action. Citing <em>Larsen </em>v. <em>General Motors Corp. </em>(391 F. 2d 495, <em>supra), </em>the entire court concluded that injuries resulting from a latent defect in design which, to the reasonably prudent manufacturer, creates a foreseeable risk of harm should be actionable notwithstanding the fact that the defect may not have been a causative factor of the initial accident. The general foreseeability of the inevitable automobile accident led the majority to adopt the position of the <em>Larsen </em>court which held: <em>\u201c </em>Where the manufacturer\u2019s negligence in design causes an unreasonable risk to be imposed upon the user of its products, the manufacturer should be liable for the injury caused by its failure to exercise reasonable care in the design. These injuries are readily foreseeable as an incident to the normal and expected use of an automobile. WThile automobiles are not made for the purpose of colliding with each other, a frequent and inevitable contingency of normal automobile use will result in collisions and injury-producing impacts. No rational basis exists for limiting recovery to situations where the defect in design or manufacture was the causative factor of the accident, as the accident and the resulting injury, usually caused by the so-called \u2018 second collision \u2019 of the passenger with the interior part of the automobile, all are foreseeable. WThere the injuries or enhanced injuries are due to the manufacturer\u2019s failure to use reasonable care to avoid subjecting the user of its products to an unreasonable risk of injury, general negligence principles should be applicable.\u201d (391 F. 2d, at p. 502.)</p>\n<p id=\"b207-6\">The disagreement at the Appellate Division related to the nature of the defect in this case. The majority opinion, per Presiding Justice Goldman\", expressed the view that the parcel grid constituted a latent defect, concluding that although the grid itself was patent or obvious, the inherent danger in such a design was not. The dissenters, Justices Del Vecohio and Wither, would have affirmed the order granting summary judgment to the defendants based upon a finding that the danger from the negligently placed parcel grid was \u201c open, patent and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"156\">*156</page-number>known to plaintiff Moreover, the dissent would find the failure of the complaint to specifically allege <em>\u201c </em>a latent or hidden defect or concealed danger \u201d to he fatal to the cause of action (citing <em>Inman </em>v. <em>Binghamton Housing Auth., </em>3 N Y 2d 137). The nonfinal order denying the defendants\u2019 motion for summary judgment was appealed to this court by permission of the Appellate Division upon the following certified question: <em>\u201c </em>Was the order of this court entered February 23,1973 properly made? \u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b208-5\">The certified question should be answered in the affirmative and the order of the Appellate Division should be affirmed. We add, however, that the question as to whether the design defect was latent or patent is a factual one for the jury which, under the circumstances here present, should not have been resolved as a matter of law by the Appellate Division.</p>\n<p id=\"b208-6\">The threshold issue on this appeal concerns the liability of a manufacturer of motor vehicles for defects in design which do not cause accidents but do enhance or aggravate injuries. (See Ann. Product Liability \u2014 Defect Enhancing Injury, 42 ALE 3d 560.) Appellants contend that <em>Campo </em>v. <em>Scofield </em>(301 N. Y. 468, <em>supra) </em>is dispositive, mandating a determination that a latent design defect which is not causative of the accident gives rise to no liability for injuries resulting from <em>\u201c </em>the second collision.\u201d We do not agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b208-7\">In <em>Campo </em>v. <em>Scofield (supra), </em>we essentially reaffirmed the principle laid down in <em>MacPherson </em>v. <em>Buick Motor Co. </em>(217 N. Y. 382) that a manufacturer is under a duty to construct a product which is free of latent or hidden defects. Expressing the converse in <em>Campo, </em>Judge Fuld, writing for a unanimous court, stated: \u201c If a manufacturer does everything necessary to make the machine function properly for the purpose for which it is designed, if the machine is without any latent defect, and if its functioning creates no danger or peril that is not known to the user, then the manufacturer has satisfied the law\u2019s demands * * * [T]he manufacturer is under no duty to render a machine or other article \u2018 more \u2019 safe \u2014 as long as the danger to be avoided is obvious and patent to all \u201d (301 N. Y, at p. 472; see, also, <em>Inman </em>v. <em>Binghamton Housing Auth., </em>3 N Y 2d 137, 145, <em>supra). </em>Clearly left intact by <em>Campo, </em>then, is the obligation of the manufacturer to market a product which, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"157\">*157</page-number>in the normal course of its intended functioning, is free of any latent dangers.</p>\n<p id=\"b209-5\">In <em>Edgar </em>v. <em>Nachman </em>(37 A D 2d 86, mot. for lv. to app. den. 29 N Y 2d 483, <em>supra), </em>the Appellate Division, Third Department, first adopted the \u201c second collision rule.\u201d There, the gas cap on the front-end gas tank of a 1963 Volkswagen was alleged to be defectively designed, causing the cap to fly off on impact. As a result of the defective design the gasoline ignited and the occupant of the Volkswagen was fatally burned. Relying on <em>Campo </em>v. <em>Scofield (supra), </em>the court concluded that injuries resulting from a design defect which did not cause the accident but merely aggravated or enhanced the injuries were not actionable.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> In citing <em>Campo </em>for such a broad proposition, the <em>Edgar </em>court necessarily rested on one of two alternative rationales: either it considered the danger of all \u201c second collision \u201d injuries to be patent or obvious, no matter what the cause; or it considered the very involvement in a collision to be outside the \u201c intended use \u201d of the vehicle so that the injuries resulting therefrom \u2014 \u201c second collision\u201d injuries \u2014 are not due to a breach of duty. While the latter alternative finds some support in other jurisdictions (see, e.g., <em>Evans </em>v. <em>General Motors Corp., </em>359 F. 2d 822; but see <em>Larsen </em>v. <em>General Motors Corp., </em>391 F. 2d 495, <em>supra), </em>we find neither rationale tenable.</p>\n<p id=\"b209-6\">As was stated in <em>Campo, </em>a manufacturer is under no duty to design a product which is accident-proof. There is no liability on the part of a manufacturer for injuries resulting from dangers which are patent or obvious. Thus, the operator of a motor vehicle assumes the dangers which inhere in its operation, including the probability of many <em>\u201c </em>second collision \u201d injuries. The extent of that assumption, however, should be no greater than those <em>\u201c </em>second collision \u201d injuries which would result from an impact in a reasonably designed and constructed vehicle. While a vehicle need not be made <em>\u2018</em><footnotemark><em>1</em></footnotemark><em> </em>crash-worthy \u2019 \u2019, the manufacturer should not be permitted to argue that a user of its product assumes dangers from unknown or latent defects, either in construction or design, which the manufacturer can reasonably foresee will cause injury on impact. The standards for <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"158\">*158</page-number>imposing liability f.or such unreasonably dangerous design defects are, thus, general negligence principles (see <em>Larsen </em>v. <em>General Motors Corp., </em>supra; Restatement, 2d, Torts, \u00a7 395; Noel, Manufacturer\u2019s Negligence of Design or Directions for Use of. a Product, 71 Yale L. J. 816, 818).</p>\n<p id=\"b210-5\">The argument posited by the U. S. Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit in <em>Evans </em>v. <em>General Motors Corp. </em>(359 F. 2d 822, <em>supra) </em>\u2014 that a collision is not within the <em>11 </em>intended use \u201d of a motor vehicle \u2014 was, in our opinion, properly refuted by the Eighth Circuit in <em>Larsen </em>v. <em>General Motors Corp. </em>(supra; see, also, <em>Grundmanis </em>v. <em>British Motor Corp., </em>308 F. Supp. 303 [Wis.]; <em>Dyson </em>v. <em>General Motors Corp., </em>298 F. Supp. 1064 [Pa.]; <em>Cronin </em>v. <em>J. B. E. Olson Corp., </em>8 Cal. 3d 121; <em>Badoreh </em>v. <em>General Motors Corp., </em>90 Cal. Rptr. 305; <em>Mieher </em>v. <em>Brown, </em>3 Ill. App. 3d 802, revd. on other grounds 54 Ill. 2d 539). As the <em>Larsen </em>court stated: \u201c The intended' use and purpose of an automobile is to travel on the streets and highways, which travel more often than not is in close proximity to other vehicles and at speeds that carry the possibility, probability, and potential of injury-producing impacts. The realities of the intended and actual use are well known to the manufacturer and to the public and these realities should be squarely faced by the manufacturer and the courts. We perceive of no sound reason, either in logic or experience, nor any command in precedent, why the manufacturer should not he held to a reasonable duty of care in the design of its vehicle consonant with the state of the art to minimize the effect of accidents. The manufacturers are not insurers but should be held to a standard of reasonable care in design to provide a reasonably safe vehicle in which to travel \u201d (391 F. 2d 502-503).</p>\n<p id=\"b210-6\">The extension of liability proposed herein \u2014 that of the manufacturer for unreasonably dangerous (latent) design defects which enhance or aggravate injuries \u2014 was presaged by, and is consonant with, our recent holding in <em>Codling </em>v. <em>Paglia </em>(32 N Y 2d 330). As was pointed out in <em>Codling, </em>liability for defective products has, over the years, been increasingly shifted to the responsible manufacturer in order \u201c to avoid injustice and for the protection of the public \u201d (32 NY 2d, at p. 338). Today, more than ever before, it is the manufacturer who is solely in a nosition to prevent injuries from latent defects. Thus in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"159\">*159</page-number><em>Codling, </em>it was noted that <em>\u201c \u2018 </em>[manufacturers of articles which may be a source of danger to several people if not properly manufactured should not be immune from liability for breach of implied warranty, a tortious wrong, to persons injured by a defectively manufactured article, where the manufacturer could reasonably contemplate .injury to such persons by reason of the defect \u2019 \u201d (32 N Y 2d, at p. 340). There, the manufacturer of a defective product was held to be liable, <em>\u201c </em>under a doctrine of strict products liability,\u201d if the defect \u201c was a substantial factor in bringing about [the] injury or damages; provided: (1) that at the time of the occurrence the product is being used * * * for the purpose and in the manner normally intended, (2) that if the person injured or damaged is himself the user of the product he would not by the exercise of reasonable care have both discovered the defect and perceived its danger, and (3) that by the exercise of reasonable care the person injured or damaged would not otherwise have averted his injuries or damages \u201d (32 NY 2d, at p. 342). Neither sound policy nor reason can be found to justify a distinction between the liability of the manufacturer whose defective item causes the initial accident and that of the manufacturer whose defective product aggravates or enhances the injuries after an intervening impact. Assuming that in each case the defect is \u201c a substantial factor in bringing about [the] injury or damages \u201d, what possible justification is there for disallowing a claim against the manufacturer whose defective product results in injury after a foreseeable intervening cause? It is well settled that foreseeable intervening cause will not relieve a wrongdoer of liability in other situations (41 N. Y. Jur., Negligence, \u00a7 38; 2 Harper and James, Law of Torts, \u00a7 20.5). We can perceive no reason why a manufacturer of motor vehicles should be held to a lesser degree of liability. Accordingly, we reject the <em>\u2018 \u2018 </em>second collision rule \u201d in favor of traditional rules of negligence and warranty.</p>\n<p id=\"b211-4\">As mentioned above, we qualify our affirmance with a notation that the issue as to the latency or potency of the dangers from the design defect \u2014 if the jury determines there was a design defect \u2014 presents a question of fact which should not have been resolved by the Appellate Division on appeal from the motion for summary judgment. As Chief Judge CabdOzo stated in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"160\">*160</page-number><em>Palsgraf </em>v. <em>Long Is. R. R. Co. </em>(248 N. Y. 339, 345), \u201c The range of reasonable apprehension is at times a question for the court, and at times, if varying inferences are possible, a question for the jury.\u201d Here the duty and, thus, the liability of the manufacturer turn upon the perception of the reasonable user of the motorcycle as to the dangers which inhere in the placement of the parcel grid on top of the gas tank. That is a question of fact which should be submitted, with the other issues, for jury consideration.</p>\n<p id=\"AXV\">Finally, we conclude, as did the Appellate Division majority, that the failure of the complaint to specify that the defect complained of was \u201c latent \u201d should not, under the liberal provisions of CPLR 3026, be considered fatal. <em>Inman </em>v. <em>Binghamton Housing Auth. </em>(3 N Y 2d 137, <em>supra) </em>which held otherwise, was a pre-CPLR case.</p>\n<p id=\"b212-5\">Accordingly, the order appealed from should be affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b205-6\">. The underlying motion on this appeal being addressed to the pleadings, plaintiff\u2019s factual allegations are, for purposes of the appeal, deemed true (see <em>Tobin </em>v. <em>Grossman, </em>24 N Y 2d 609, 612).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b209-7\">.

I am in entire agreement with the rest of the court as to the liability of a manufacturer for design defects which, while not the cause of an accident, do aggravate the damages sustained, under theories both of negligence and strict products liability. On the record in this case, however, I would conclude, as a matter of law, that plaintiff user of the motorcycle by the exercise of reasonable care would have both discovered the defective design of the metal luggage rack (perilously positioned as it was, directly in front of him and between his legs as he rode) and as well inescapably have perceived the danger incident to its design and location.</p>\n<p id=\"b212-7\">I would, therefore, reverse the order of the Appellate Division and reinstate the order of Special Term granting defendants\u2019 motion and dismissing the complaint.</p>\n<p id=\"b212-8\">Chief Judge Fuld and Judges Breitel, Gabrielli and Wachtler concur with Judge Burke ; Judge Jones dissents and votes to reverse in a separate opinion in which Judge Jasen concurs.</p>\n<p id=\"b212-9\">Order affirmed, without costs.
