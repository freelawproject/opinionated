New York obscenity law is constitutionally vague by virtue of its failure as written or authoritatively construed to specifically define the proscribed sexual conduct which could be the subject of proscription. <em>(Miller </em>v. <em>California, </em>413 U. S. 15; <em>Paris Adult Theatre I </em>v. <em>Slaton, </em>413 U. S. 49.) II. While the Supreme Court has held that national community standards, being unascertainable and hence constitutionally vague, cannot form the basis for an obscenity prosecution, it has left to each State the determination of the scope of the community, the standards of which are used to test expression for purposes of obscenity prosecutions. <em>(Meltzer </em>v. <em>Koenigsberg, </em>302 N. Y. 523 ; <em>Lawrence Constr. Corp. </em>v. <em>State of .New York, </em>293 N. Y. 634;. <em>Saltser &amp; Weinsier, Inc. </em>v. <em>McGoldrick, </em>295 N. Y. 499; <em>People ex rel.

Appellants\u2019 judgments of conviction must be reversed because: they were never charged with soliciting deviate sexual conduct through the newspaper; the trial court\u2019s adding of a fourth test of obscenity to the statutory definition was unauthorized, and the mere running of a personal ad in a newspaper seeking sexual association with another does not constitute criminal solicitation, nor does it render the publication obscene. <em>(Russell </em>v. <em>United States, </em>369 U. S. 749; <em>People </em>v. <em>McGuire, </em>5 N Y 2d 523; <em>People </em>v. <em>Fiedler, </em>31 N Y 2d 176; <em>United States </em>v. <em>Pinkus, </em>333 F.

The newspaper <em>Screw </em>is constitutionally protected and is not obscene as a matter of law. <em>(Jacobellis </em>v. <em>Ohio, </em>378 U. S. 184; <em>United States </em>v. <em>Head, </em>317 F. Supp. 1138; <em>Matter of Panarella </em>v. <em>Birenbaum, </em>32 N Y 2d 108.) III. Article 235 of the Penal Law is unconstitutional because its standard for measuring obscenity differs substantially from the constitutional test established by this court. <em>(People </em>v. <em>Richmond County News, </em>9 N Y 2d 578; <em>Roth </em>v. <em>United States, </em>354 U. S. 476; <em>Manual Enterprises </em>v. <em>Day, </em>370 U.

We have treated with the <em>Heller </em>case previously, deciding that the film \u201c Blue Movie \u201d was obscene within section 235.00 of the Penal Law, the statute which defines the meaning of obscenity <em>(People </em>v. <em>Heller, </em>29 N Y 2d 319). We also decided in that case that it was proper for a judicial officer authorized to issue warrants, who had viewed the film and found it obscene, to issue a valid warrant for the film\u2019s seizure as evidence in a prosecution against the exhibitor, without first conducting an adversary hearing on the issue of probable obscenity.</p>\n<p id=\"b370-6\"><em>Heller </em>was taken to the United States Supreme Court, and during its pendency that court handed down together five obscenity cases in which a revised obscenity test was adopted by a majority of five Justices <em>(Miller </em>v. <em>California, </em>413 U. S. 15; <em>Paris Adult Theatre I </em>v. <em>Slaton, </em>413 U. S. 49; <em>United States </em>v. <em>12 200-Ft. Reels of Film, </em>413 U. S. 123; <em>United States </em>v. <em>Orito, </em>413 U. S. 139; <em>Kaplan </em>v. <em>California, </em>413 U. S. 115).</p>\n<p id=\"b370-7\">Shortly following the decisions in those cases the <em>Heller </em>decision was handed down. Five Justices affirmed our determination of the procedural matter concerning the seizure of the film, but vacated our affirmance of defendant\u2019s conviction on instructions to reconsider the substantive issues in light of the lead cases, <em>Miller </em>and <em>Paris Adult Theatre I, </em>already referred to, redefining the limits of obscenity prosecutions <em>(Heller </em>v. <em>New York, </em>413 U. S. 483). Four Justices considered section 235.00 \u201c unconstitutionally overbroad \u201d and therefore invalid on its face (p. 495; and see Justice Douglas\u2019s separate dissent at 413 U. S., p. 494).</p>\n<p id=\"b370-8\">The <em>Buckley </em>case is in this court for the first time. Defendants were convicted by a three-Judge Criminal Court panel for publishing and disseminating a tabloid type newspaper determined to be obscene entitled <em>Screw </em>(65 Misc 2d 917). Defendants, publishers and editors of the tabloid, were found guilty on each of six counts and were fiped $250 or 30 days imprison<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"319\">*319</page-number>ment on each count. Appellate Term for the First Department unanimously affirmed without opinion (72 Misc 2d 549) and leave to appeal to this court was granted. During the pendency of the <em>Buckley </em>case in this court the Supreme Court decided the afore-mentioned cases headed by <em>Miller, </em>and thus the merits of the prosecution against the <em>Buckley </em>defendants will also be considered in light of the <em>Miller </em>redefinition.</p>\n<p id=\"b371-5\">Our primary task is to determine the constitutionality of section 235.00 of the Penal Law in terms of whether it comports with the <em>Miller </em>decision and is sufficiently definite to satisfy the \u201c void-for-vagueness \u201d test. The question whether obscenity is within the protection of the First Amendment to the United States Constitution, or whether it should or should not be so protected, is not in this case. The Supreme Court and this court have regularly and consistently held traffic in obscene materials to lie beyond the limits of First Amendment coverage <em>(Miller </em>v. <em>California, </em>413 U. S. 15, supra; <em>Kois </em>v. <em>Wisconsin, </em>408 U. S. 229; <em>United States </em>v. <em>Reidel, </em>402 U. S. 351; <em>Roth </em>v. <em>United States, </em>354 U. S. 476; <em>People </em>v. <em>Heller, </em>29 N Y 2d 319, supra; <em>People </em>v. <em>G. I. Distrs., </em>20 N Y 2d 104, cert. den. 389 U. S. 905; <em>People </em>v. <em>Richmond County News, </em>9 N Y 2d 578). As Chief Justice Burger said in the <em>Paris Adult Theatre I </em>case: \u201c The States, of course, may follow such a \u2018 laissez faire \u2019 policy and drop all controls on commercialized obscenity, if that is what they prefer, just as they can ignore consumer protection in the marketplace, but nothing in the Constitution <em>compels </em>the States to do so with regard to matters falling within state jurisdiction. \u2019 \u2019 (413 U. S., at p. 64; emphasis as in original.) The fact is that the people of the State of New York, through their elected representatives, have chosen to curb the commercial promotion and sale of obscene material, a perfectly vadid exercise.</p>\n<p id=\"b371-6\">The second question is whether the published materi\u00e1l falls within the statutory ban, a point already decided against the defendant by this court in <em>Heller </em>(29 N Y 2d 319, <em>supra).</em></p>\n<p id=\"b371-7\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b371-8\">It is necessary at this point to undertake an analysis of Chief Justice Burger\u2019s thesis as set forth primarily in the <em>Miller </em>and <em>Paris Adult Theatre I </em>cases. The Chief Justice first reviewed <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"320\">*320</page-number>the key decisions leading to the established test for obscenity <em>(Roth </em>v. <em>United States, 354 </em>U. S. 476, <em>supra; Memoirs </em>v. <em>Massachusetts, </em>383 U. S. 413), that test being whether \u201c (a) the dominant theme of the material taken as a whole appeals to a prurient interest in sex; (b), the material is patently offensive because it affronts contemporary community standards relating to the description or representation of sexual matters; and (c) the material is utterly without redeeming social value.\u201d (set forth in the <em>Memoirs </em>case, 383 U. S., at p. 418).</p>\n<p id=\"ALm\">The third element of the test thus laid down in <em>Memoirs </em>represented a tightening of the <em>Roth </em>requirements in that the material had to be \u201c 1 unqualifiedly worthless \u2019 \u201d before it could be labeled obscene (383 U. S., at p. 419), thus putting a burden on the prosecutor to prove the absence of any social value, a burden, said Chief Justice. Burger in <em>Miller, \u2018 \u2018 </em>virtually impossible to discharge under our criminal standards of proof \u201d (413 U. S., at p. 22). Since no adherents to the \u201c utterly without redeeming social value \u201d element of the <em>Roth-Memoirs </em>test remain on that court, that element was simply abandon\u00e9d in <em>Miller </em>and a new test was formulated, to wit: <em>\u20181 </em>The basic guidelines for the trier of fact must be: (a) whether \u2018 the average person, applying contemporary community standards\u2019 would find that the work, taken as a whole, appeals to the prurient interest * * * (b) whether the work depicts or describes, in a patently offensive way, sexual conduct specifically defined by the applicable state law; and (c) whether the work, taken as a whole, lacks serious literary, artistic, political, or scientific value.\u201d<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> (413 TJ. S., at p, 24).</p>\n<p id=\"b372-6\">Comparing this new test to the old test we find element \u20181 (a) \u201d substantially the same, i.e., the dominant theme must appeal to the prurient interest. The insertion of the average man into this element, and his application of contemporary community standards, does not represent any significant practical departure from the previous test, a point later discussed.</p>\n<p id=\"b373-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"321\">*321</page-number>Element \u201c (b) \u201d for the new test presents no practical change whatsoever. That the offensive sexual material should foe specifically defined by State statute in order iofoe prosecutable could Well have been a point left unstated since adequate definition is essential to any criminal statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b373-6\">Element \u201c(c)\u201d of the new test does effect a change, of course. In place of the \u201c utterly without redeeming social value \u201d test, the court has substituted much looser criteria. Now, the prosecutor need not prove the material \u201c unqualifiedly worthless \u201d. It will be sufficient to show that because of the predominant emphasis on the subject matter described in elements \u201c (a) \u201d and \u201c (b) \u201d, the-material, whether purportedly literary, artistic, political, or scientific, cannot be taken seriously as falling into any of those categories. To put am assessment of this test another way, the effectuation of a pretense as a serious work will not save the material from being found obscene if, in fact, it is dominated by patently offensive sexual material clearly geared for a market made up of those who Would have no use for it other than to satisfy their lewd, lascivious or morbid desires and cravings.</p>\n<p id=\"b373-7\">Chief Justice Bubgeb goes on in <em>Miller </em>to state that s</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b373-8\">\u201c If a state law that regulates obscene material is thus limited [in accord with the new test above recounted], as written or construed, the First Amendment values applicable to the States through the Fourteenth Amendment are adequately protected by the ultimate power of appellate courts to conduct an independent review of constitutional claim k when necessary. * * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b373-9\">\u201c We emphasize that it is not our function to propose regulatory schemes for the States. That must await their concrete legislative efforts. It is possible, however, to give a few plain examples of what a state statute could define for regulation under part (b) of the standard announced in this opinion, <em>supra:</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b373-10\"><em>' </em>\u201c (a) Patently offensive representations or descriptions of ultimate sexual acts, normal or perverted, actual or simulated.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b373-11\">\u201c (b) Patently offensive representations or descriptions of masturbation, excretory functions, and lewd exhibition of tie genitals.\u201d (413 U. S., at p. 25.)</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b374-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"322\">*322</page-number>In footnote 6 to his opinion (p. 24) the Chief Justice points to the Oregon and Hawaii legislation as examples of adequately detailed statutes, but then states: \u201cWe do not hold, as Mb. Justice Bbennan intimates, that all States other than Oregon must now enact new obscenity statutes. Other existing state statutes, as construed heretofore or hereafter, may well be adequate.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b374-4\">The final highlight in the <em>Miller </em>opinion concerns the contemporary community standards yardstick incorporated into the \u201c (a) \u201d element of the revised obscenity test. The necessity for a national standard as to what is patently offensive was abjured in favor of the application of \u201c community \u201d standards. We take pains to here declare that in determining whether any material is patently offensive or obscene, the community standard to be applied is a \u201c state \u201d standard. The connotation of the term \u201c community \u201d appears to have brought about a great deal of hand wringing by concerned libertarians who have tended to interpret the term as meaning local or provincial so as to open the door to censorship by local authorities or even constables who would be free to form their own notions as to what constituted patently offensive material. A fair reading of Chief Justice Burgee's opinion, however, does not lead to any such conclusion. In the <em>Miller </em>case both the prosecutor and the defense assumed that the \u201ccommunity standards\u201d applicable to the factual determination of whether or not the subject material was patently offensive were those of the State of California. This State standard w\u00e1s specifically approved in the <em>Miller </em>opinion (413 U. S., at p. 32)<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> and, when taken <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"323\">*323</page-number>together with the statement quoted <em>supra, </em>that assuming the State law complies with the new test constitutional rights are adequately protected by the safeguards of appellate review (413 ti. S., at p. 25), it becomes clear that the obscenity statute in any given State will be applied with, uniformity Statewide . through the construction given it by the appellate courts. \u201c Local \u201d law enforcement officers would no more be justified in seizing material that could not reasonably be construed as being hard core than they are, or would be in arresting a man for assault when only harsh words were spoken. And, as in the spurious assault case, an unreasonable obscenity arrest would quickly be recognized as such by the prosecutor or Judge in the application of the State standard. Probable cause is still the touchstone of valid prosecution. Of course, in close cases where convictions ensue, the corrective apparatus in the appellate route is just as available as it is in any other type of case. Finally, and as a practical matter later to be discussed, patently offensive sexual material subject to seizure has become so elemental in content as to be readily discerned when seen by an observer with the statutory definition in mind, as construed by this court.</p>\n<p id=\"b375-5\">The opinion in <em>Miller </em>is concluded as follows: \u201c In sum we (a) reaffirm the <em>Roth </em>holding that obscene material is not protected by the First Amendment; (b) hold that such material . can be regulated by the States, subject to the specific safeguards enunciated above, , without a showing that the material is <em>1 utterly </em>without redeeming social value <em>\u2019; </em>and (c) hold that obscenity is to be determined by applying \u2018 contemporary community standards,\u2019 * * * not \u2018 national standards.\u2019 \u201d (413 TJ. S., at pp. 36-37; emphasis as in original).</p>\n<p id=\"b375-6\">The thrust of Chief Justice Bttbgeb\u2019s opinion in the <em>Paris Adult Theatre I </em>case was to dispel the notion that pornography limited in availability to consenting adults only, should benefit from the protection of the First Amendment. It was also held that the prosecutor need not produce \u201c expert \u201d evidence .that the material is obscene when the material itself is placed in. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"324\">*324</page-number>evidence since, quite obviously, it speaks for itself under the <em>x\u2018 </em>average person \u201c community standard \u201d requirements set forth in <em>Miller.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b376-5\">n</p>\n<p id=\"b376-6\">What we obviously now have in the statute is a codification of the <em>Both-Memoirs </em>criteria enacted in 1967.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b376-7\">Prior to the June, 1973 decisions headed by <em>Miller </em>this statutory scheme, or, more particularly section 235.00, the definitions portion with which we are primarily concerned, had consistently been held valid. A sampling of the cases includes <em>Milky Way Prods, </em>v. <em>Leary </em>(305 F. Supp. 288 [S. D. N. Y., 1970]) in which a three-Judge court, primarily concerned with whether there should be an adversary hearing before an arrest for obscenity, stated: \u201c The attack upon \u00a7 235 as void for vagueness is frivolous. Ro<em>th </em>v. <em>United States </em>sustained the bare word * obscene \u2019 against a similar assault. See 354 U. S. at 491-492, 77 S. Ct. 1304. New York\u2019s detailed definition renders its statute more <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"325\">*325</page-number>clearly impregnable \u201d (305 F. Supp., at p. 295). The, <em>Milky Way </em>decision was affirmed by the Supreme Court without opinion (397 U. S. 98).</p>\n<p id=\"b377-4\">In <em>Overstock Book Co. </em>v. <em>Barry </em>(305 F. Supp. 842 [E. D. N. Y., 1969]) the court discussed section 235.00 and specifically held that it was not void for vagueness and, \u2018 \u2018 if anything, is somewhat more narrowly circumscribed than what the Constitution requires \u201d (305 F. Supp., at p. 849),. This case was affirmed, the Court of Appeals reiterating the holding that section 235.00 was clearly in line with <em>Both </em>and therefore valid (436 F. 2d 1289, 1293 [2d Cir., 1970]).</p>\n<p id=\"b377-5\">Finally, in <em>Astro Cinema Corp. </em>v. Mackell (305 F. Supp. 863, 865 [\u00c9. D, N. Y., 1969], modified on procedural grounds 422 F. 2d 293) the court stated: \u201c Here * * ' * the substantive statute is as assuredly valid as a statute can be when it must be drafted in the light of the First Amendment. [Citations.] \u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b377-6\">Prior to June, 1973, then, no convincing argument had been made out against the validity of section 235.00 and one Federal decision after another had specifically declared the .statute\u2019s constitutionality. If anything has occurred to change this state of affairs, it would have to be found in the decisions headed by <em>Miller.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b377-7\">Since June, 1973, the Federal courts in New York have declined to entertain the question of the statute\u2019s validity pending our decision in <em>Heller </em>(e.g., <em>United Artists Corp. </em>v. <em>Proskin </em>363 F. Supp. 406).<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b378-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"326\">*326</page-number>in</p>\n<p id=\"b378-5\">The California statute treated in <em>Miller </em>contains the <em>Roth? Memoirs </em>criteria and for all intents and purposes is the same as our own (see n. 1 in the <em>Miller </em>decision, 413 U. S., at p. 16). Chief Justice Btjbgeb wrote: <em>\u201c </em>The case we now review was tried on the theory that the California Penal Code \u00a7 311 approximately incorporates the three-stage <em>Memoirs </em>test, supra. But now the <em>Memoirs </em>test has been abandoned as unworkable by its author and no Member of the Court today supports the. <em>Memoirs </em>formulation.\u201d (413 U. S., at p. 23).</p>\n<p id=\"b378-6\">It is obvious that this was not a holding, however, that the California Statute was invalid. Had it been, our task in the instant case would have been <em>pro forma. </em>Bather, the case was sent back, as was the instant case, for evaluation in light of the whole <em>Miller </em>rationale. The Chief Justice made the obvious effort to point out that existing State statutes, presumably including California\u2019s, <em>\u201c </em>as construed heretofore or hereafter \u201d (413 U. S., at p. 24, n. 6) could stand as valid. This effort is obvious because not once, but at least four times in the <em>Miller </em>opinion alone, reference was made to construction of the statute whatever form the statute (might take.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b378-7\">We now, then, pass to the next question \u2014 whether our statute can be construed so as to effectuate the <em>Miller </em>requirements which sets up the \u201c average person \u201d as the theoretical individual whose sensibilities need be offended. We look to the \u201c ordinary adult \u201d. In either case the tests are concerned with the average man who has, of course, been a useful figure in our legal history, especially in the law of negligence, but also in the law of evidence where he is present, but unobtrusive. <em>Miller </em>holds that, the average man must apply contemporary community standards and, as we have already declared, this means a State standard which is definable by the State\u2019s appellate courts. Our obscenity statutes have always been subject to such a uni<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"327\">*327</page-number>formly administered standard. Our State courts have always . been guided by our interpretation of the obscenity statutes, as with our interpretation of any criminal statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b379-4\">Next, we are of the opinion that subdivision 1 of section 235.00 sufficiently describes the conduct sought to be prohibited so as to satisfy the, void-for-vagueness test. It takes no dictionary reference to understand what the words \u201cnudity \u201d, \u201c sex\u201d, \u201c excretion \u201d, \u201c sadism \u201d or \u201c masochism \u201d mean. The last three terms, which are descriptive of certain kinds of conduct Whether portrayed live, printed or photographically, can be considered <em>malum in se </em>in terms of <em>commercial exploitation. </em>It is ludicrous and preposterous to suppose that a person dealing in such material would not underst\u00e1nd the prohibitions here. The terms \u201c nudity \u201d and \u201c sex \u201d are only <em>malum prohibitum, </em>of course, since each, to varying extents, could be commercially exploited for valid artistic, scientific, or literary ends. But surely, applying the sense of subdivision 1 of section 235.00 as a whole, there can be no doubt as to the narrow area sought to be prohibited. \"When sex and nudity, and the other sorts of prohibited conduct for that matter, are exploited substantially beyond customary limits of candor and would, as the average man views it, be the predominant element in the material so as to appeal, again predominantly, to lascivious cravings, then there can be no doubt as to what is prohibited. <em>What we are talking about is hard core </em>pornography, We have applied the hard core pornography test with consistency both under former section 1141 of the Penal Law and under the current statute <em>(People </em>v. <em>Kirkpatrick, </em>32 N Y 2d 17; <em>People </em>v. <em>Fritch, </em>13 N Y 2d 119; <em>People </em>v. <em>Richmond County News, </em>9 N Y 2d 578, <em>supra). </em>This court and the lower courts have ever been careful strictly to define the sort of material or conduct prohibited (see, e.g., <em>People </em>v. <em>Bookcase, Inc., </em>14 N Y 2d 409 [reversal of conviction for selling materials to minors]; <em>People </em>v. <em>Wendling, </em>258 N. Y. 451 [portrayal of characters in a play as coarse and vulgar, who employ coarse and vulgar language, not obscene]; <em>People </em>v. <em>Stabile, </em>58 Misc 2d 905 [photographs of nudes, with no indication of sexual activity, did not amount to hard core pornography]). The fact of an occasional close case (see, <em>e.g., People </em>v. <em>Carlos, </em>24 N Y 2d 865) serves as no basis for a declaration <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"328\">*328</page-number>that the penal statute, under which it is decided, is invalid. Hard core pornography consists of \u201c Patently offensive representations or descriptions of ultimate sexual acts, normal or perverted, actual or simulated [and/or] Patently offensive representation or descriptions of masturbation, excretory functions, and lewd exhibition of the genitals \u201d (413 U. S., at p. 25).</p>\n<p id=\"A7u\">Our task on this void-for-vagueness aspect is considerably eased since we only recently gave full consideration to a due process attack on subdivision 6 of section 240.35 of the Penal Law, the loitering statute <em>(People </em>v. <em>Berck, </em>32 N Y 2d 567). A majority of us decided that the statute was invalid for the reasons . (1) that \u201c there are no commonly understood set of suspicious circumstances of which all citizens are aware and to which applicability of the statute is restricted \u201d (32 N Y 2d, at p. 570), and (2) that it also <em>\u201c </em>places virtually unfettered discretion in the hands of the police and thereby encourages arbitrary and discriminatory enforcement * * * Thus, whether or not a suspect is hauled off to jail for suspicious loitering depends, for all intents and purposes, upon the whim of the policeman \u201d (32 N Y 2d, at p. 571). Neither of those objections can successfully be directed against section 235.00, which is easily interpreted as pertaining to hard core pornography and the average man, whether he be the smut peddler or the policeman, knows, it when he sees it <em>(Jacobellis </em>v. <em>Ohio, </em>378 U. S. 184,197). And, as interpreted, that statute has been given and will be given.only that narrow application. One surely can describe forbidden conduct by words which admit of varying, constructions depending on context, and then afix definite meanings to those words by construing them only in the light of the conduct sought to be prohibited. In other words, while the terms \u201c sex \u201d and <em>\u201c </em>nudity \u201d are not inherently pornographic and would not necessarily be pornographically dealt with, even if exploited commercially, the exploitation would be considered pornographic if its predominant appeal went to the prurient interest and it exceeded the customary limits of descriptive candor. This includes, and has been limited to, offensive depictions of ultimate sexual acts, masturbation, excretory functions-, lewd genital exhibition, i.e., exactly that sort of thing described in the <em>Miller </em>opinion (413 U. S., at p. 25).</p>\n<p id=\"b381-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"329\">*329</page-number>There is, therefore, no merit to the argument that the person dealing in such materials cannot know what is prohibited, or that what appeals to the prurient interest can be just, anything the policeman says it is; this latter aspect being especially clear in light of the State contemporary standard which we have announced.</p>\n<p id=\"b381-5\">There is no need, then, for a protracted discussion on the void-for-vagueness doctrine. In addition to the treatment of this doctrine in <em>Berck </em>(32 N Y 2d 567, <em>supra) </em>see also the pronouncements\u2019 by the Supreme Court on the same point in <em>Papachristou </em>v. <em>City of Jacksonville </em>(405 U. S. 156); <em>Colten </em>v. <em>Kentucky </em>(407 U. S. 104); <em>United States </em>v. <em>Petrillo </em>(332 U. S. 1); and Chief Justice Burger\u2019s adoption in <em>Miller </em>of this language from the case of <em>Roth </em>v. <em>United States </em>(354 U. S., at pp. 491-492, <em>supra): \u201c 1 </em>Many decisions have recognized that these terms of obscenity statutes are not precise. * * * This Court, however, has consistently held that lack of precision is not itself offensive to the requirements of due process. \u201c. . . [T]he Constitution does not require impossible standards all that is required is that the language \u201c conveys sufficiently definite warnings as to the proscribed conduct when measured by common understanding and practices ...\u201d [citation] * * * \u201c * * * That there may be marginal cases in which it is difficult to determine the side of the line on which a particular fact situation falls is no sufficient reason to hold the language too ambiguous to define a criminal offense \u201d \u2019 \u201d. (413 U. S., at pp. 27-28, n. 10.)<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b381-6\">And, of course, we recall the pronouncement of the three-Judge Federal court in <em>Milky Way Prods, </em>v. <em>Leary </em>(305 F. Supp. 288, 295 [S. D. N. Y., 1970], affd. 397 U. S. 98, <em>supra) </em>that \u201cNew York\u2019s detailed definition renders its statute more <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"330\">*330</page-number>clearly impregnable [than the less detailed standard dealt with in <em>Roth].\u201d</em></p>\n<p id=\"b382-4\">The third aspect of the <em>Miller </em>test does not detain us long. The rejection of the \u201c utterly without redeeming social value \u201d test in favor of a .broader test based on lack of serious literary, artistic, political or scientific val\u00fae, can hardly inure to the benefit of those dealing in the subject materials in terms either of due process denial or First Amendment infringement. In other words, since our statute remains more narrowly defined . than\" those limits now set forth in <em>Miller, </em>defendants cannot be heard to complain. This third element is. merely another way of -emphasizing the point that the material must be wholly designed for a prurient interest market. In assessing this third element we are mindful that the material must be hard core pornography as stated in elements \u201c (a) \u201d and \u201c (b) \u201d and as construed by this court, which construction coincides with the examples given in <em>Miller. </em>Fdr. this reason alone any argument that the 'decision in <em>Miller </em>to drop the \u201c utterly without \u201d test wrecks section 235.00, is without any merit whatsoever. Not only is there no holding in <em>Miller </em>that a State may not utilise stricter standards than those allowed, but the presence of the \u201c utterly without \u201d element causes no alteration of the rest of the statute so that, taken as . a whole, it cannot be said to conform, as construed, to the <em>Miller </em>requirements insofar as those requirements set the limits of First Amendment protection.</p>\n<p id=\"b382-5\">Two out-of-State decisions to which our attention has been drawn incorporate a different view regarding the abandonment of the \u201c utterly without \u201d test. Thus, it is stated in <em>United States </em>v. <em>Lang </em>(Dist. Ct., Central Dist. Calif., July 18, 1973): \u201c The new test simply requires that the prosecution show, <em>inter alla, </em>that <em>1 </em>the work, taken as a whole, lacks <em>serious </em>literary, artistic, political, or scientific value.\u2019 [Citation.] In short, the Court\u2019s new test substantially changes the law of obscenity, and as a general proposition now makes it easier to convict the defendants. Therefore, to prosecute defendants under the judicially devised <em>Miller </em>definition of obscenity and to instruct the jury on it would, without fig leaves, be the functional equivalent of an <em>ex post facto </em>application of the law. This the due process clause forbids. <em>Boule </em>v. <em>City of Columbia, </em>378 U. S. 347 (1964).\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"331\">*331</page-number>(See, also, <em>State </em>v. <em>Wedelstedt, </em>Dist. Ct. Linn County, Iowa, Aug. 13, 1973.) .</p>\n<p id=\"b383-4\">Since, however, we do not construe section 235.00 to the permissible limits now allowed in <em>Miller </em>there can be no ex post facto application of the looser <em>Miller </em>criterion. The scope of the statute is no broader than it was before June, 1973, and remains a bit narrower than the allowable limits insofar as the third element is concerned, after June, 1973. Our statute, in effect, <em>more than complies </em>with the <em>Miller </em>limits as written and construed. It is well to here point out that it is within the province of the Legislature to determine whether the less stringent test of obscenity laid down in that case should now become the ultimate formula to be applied in New York.</p>\n<p id=\"b383-5\">It is true that a few State obscenity statutes have been held invalid in light of <em>Miller. </em>For example, in one California case the statute, which is much like ours, was voided <em>(People </em>v. <em>Bloom, </em>Superior Court, Los Angeles County, July 6, 1973) while in a later California case the statute was construed to meet the <em>Miller </em>criteria <em>(People </em>v. <em>Eushat, </em>Court of Appeals, Second List., Aug. 8, 1973). Other cases decided since <em>Miller, </em>brought to our attention by counsel, hold the various local statutes invalid. We might agree that expediency dictates a short memo-random to the effect that any attempt to preserve section 235.00 would constitute judicial legislation. This was apparently thought the better course in some of the <em>post-Miller </em>decisions since State Legislatures, perhaps including our own, will be quick to draft new statutes incorporating the <em>Miller </em>tests. However, we do have these two cases before us and possibly more in process under the current statute. We are not convinced it would be intellectually honest to follow the path of expediency when there is the venerable presumption of validity <em>(People </em>v. <em>Scott, </em>26 N Y 2d 286, 291; <em>People </em>v. <em>Kaiser, </em>21 N Y 2d 86, 103; <em>People </em>v. <em>Epton, </em>19 N Y 2d 496, 505; <em>Wiggins </em>v. <em>Town of Somers, </em>4 N Y 2d 215, 218) and when the statute can be construed to comport with the <em>Miller </em>rationale.</p>\n<p id=\"b383-6\">In sum, our obscenity statute is sufficiently specific and well \u2022within the ambit of the lines laid down in <em>Miller. </em>' Very simply put, it prohibits commercial exploitation of hard core pornography, a term, employing a State standard we have employed <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"332\">*332</page-number>and continue to employ, which does not go beyond those examples set forth in <em>Miller </em>and which, in fact, contemplates material of no redeeming value whatsoever.</p>\n<p id=\"b384-5\">IV</p>\n<p id=\"b384-6\">Nothing seems to have altered the content of <em>\u201c </em>Blue Movie \u201d since a year ago when it was found obscene by a majority of this court (29 N Y 2d 319). The short of it is that if <em>\u201c </em>Blue Movie \u2019\u2022\u2019 was obscene before June, 1973 under section 235.00, then, under the rationale we have outlined, it can be no less so now. Despite all the rhetoric, the practical tests for obscenity insofar as this court has always applied them, have undergone no change in light of the <em>Miller </em>decision. Unless the Legislature amends the statute,, as it is free to do, our tests will continue to be what they have been. The question in each case is \u2014 is. this i hard core pornography in the sense it emphasizes to a predominant extent sex acts of whatever sort between or among people, or lewd exhibition of genitalia? The question may be difficult to answer in instances where the material contains an abundance of pornography, but can also be considered as making a <em>valid </em>statement of some sort. If such content is really present then the work would not be utterly lacking in value, or, as under the <em>Miller </em>test, if such content is <em>seriously </em>present then, taken as a whole, it could not be banned.</p>\n<p id=\"b384-7\">The \u201c utterly lacking \u201d test was abandoned in <em>Miller </em>because of the difficulty in proving such an extreme. The clever pornographer need only infuse some social or political content into the work to escape successful prosecution. However, this court, as it must have when the <em>Heller </em>case was here before, has applied the \u201c utterly without \u2019\u2019.test within the realm of reason. Thus, we found \u201c Blue Movie \u201d obscene even though the pornographic activities depicted were interspersed with some political and social dialogue. We cut through the form, as it were, to the substance and the substance of the film was and remains hard core pornography. The pretense at redeeming value has been discounted when, it clearly is injected as a safeguard to protect a work the focus of which is toward the prurient interest market.</p>\n<p id=\"b384-8\">There is no community standard problem in <em>Heller. </em>The movie was specifically found to be hard core pornography and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"333\">*333</page-number>Presiding Judge Bixgel stated: \u201c Hard core pornography is obscene by any standard \u201d. Our affirmance of the <em>Heller </em>conviction should be reinstated.</p>\n<p id=\"b385-5\">The magazine <em>Screw </em>is also clearly obscene by any standard. The issues in evidence are crammed with photographs of naked men and women engaging in homosexual and heterosexual acts, in many instances with genitals prominantly and lewedly displayed. Drawings and cartoons, are also explicit, exaggerating sexual activity to preposterous degrees. Book and movie reviews are confined only to those works which deal with sex, the worth of a movie being measured by the degree of male erection it is likely to induce. The -advertising is no less egregious. The issues contain display ads for what used to be called stag films; sex paraphernalia such as dildoes are prominantly illustrated in detail; and personal ads soliciting male and female participation in sex acts of every conceivable sort ar,e written quite unambiguously. Many of the articles are totally sex oriented and are written in the most graphic terms. The use of all the most abominable dirty words is prevalent both in headlines and text. Indeed, it is hard to conceive of how a publication could reach any further lows in attempts to appeal to prurient interest.</p>\n<p id=\"b385-6\">The <em>Per Curiam </em>opinion of the Criminal Court Judges was primarily concerned with the <em>u </em>utterly without \u20195 test (65 Mise 2d 917). The court noted that these issues do contain a \u201c sprinkling \u201d of nonobscene articles, but concluded that, taken as a whole, the magazine remained without value. The crucial factor, in addition to the depictions, and articles conceded by the defendant Goldstein as an affrontery to existing community standards, is the inclusion of the advertisements just noted. The net effect was capsulized as follows:</p>\n<p id=\"b385-7\">\u201c Such advertising, together with that soliciting the purchase of the aforesaid sex articles and devices certainly go substantially beyond <em>\u2018 </em>the present critical point in the compromise between candor and shame at which the community may have arrived here and now \u2019 [citation], and degenerates to illegality the entire, publication, coloring also with the brush of obscenity even that sprinkling of articles which contain some social value.</p>\n<p id=\"b386-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"334\">*334</page-number>\u201c The fact that some of the articles in <em>Screw </em>are not obscene and may be legally innocuous does not necessarily mean that the publication has social value or importance. As Judge Friendly reminds us, truly pornographic material cannot be rescued by the inclusion of a few verses of the Psalms. <em>(United States </em>v. <em>A Motion Picture Film [I Am </em>Curious-Yellow], 404 F. 2d 196, 201.) \u201d (65 Misc 2d, at pp. 921, 922.)</p>\n<p id=\"b386-4\">This, of course, is the point made previously in respect to \u201c Blue Movie \u201d. The attempt to inject element^ of ordinary material will be considered a pretense when the material is otherwise predominantly hard core pornography, patently designed for the prurient interest market.</p>\n<p id=\"b386-5\">The courts below employed standards entirely in accord with applicable State standards, i.e;, the. question was simply whether this material is predominantly hard core. It assuredly is and Can hardly be treated differently from that material considered obscene by this court in <em>People </em>v. <em>Kirkpatrick </em>(32 N Y 2d 17, <em>supra).</em></p>\n<p id=\"b386-6\">In each case, the order of the Appellate Term should be affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b372-7\">.

As the Court made clear in <em>Mishkin </em>v. <em>New York, </em>383 U.

I cannot agree, however, that as drafted or as interpreted by our court section 235.00 meets the Supreme Court\u2019s additional mandate of specific definition of the proscribed sexual conduct.</p>\n<p id=\"b387-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"335\">*335</page-number>The Supreme Court has declared that the required specificity of conduct may be found either in the explicit language of the statute as written or in authoritative construction of the statute. By authoritative construction I assume is intended, in our case, actual interpretation by decisions in our court, and possibly by interpretations of the lower courts of our State left undisturbed on application for review by us. I am not unmindful, either, of the implied warmth of the Supreme Court\u2019s invitation to us so to construe our statute as to meet its mandate <em>(Miller </em>v. <em>California, </em>413 U. S., at p. 25; <em>Heller </em>v. <em>New York, </em>413 U. S. 483, 494).</p>\n<p id=\"b387-5\">All acknowledge, T take it, that section 235.00 as presently drafted, without more, does not on its face meet the Supreme Court test for specificity of sexual conduct. The issue turns rather on whether the statute has been or now can reasonably be so construed as to supply the requisite particularity.</p>\n<p id=\"b387-6\">Initially I must assume that the call for specificity now laid down by the Supreme Court, with reference to obscenity is distinct from and quite beyond that predictablity generally required to hurdle the more familiar void-for-vagueness obstacle to constitutionality. The treatment of the subject in the Supreme Court,-the care and length of its articulation in the <em>Miller </em>opinion, lends no support to a conclusion that this is indeed nothing more than a fresh restatement of a time-honored rubric and that it could as well have been left unstated. I cannot, therefore, agree with the majority, that \u201c Element \u2018(b)\u2019 of the new test presents no practical change whatsoever \u201d.</p>\n<p id=\"b387-7\">Thus understood, in my view our statute has not been nor can it now be so construed as to meet this extra demand how imposed by the Supreme Court.<footnotemark>*</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b387-8\">The court in <em>Miller </em>held that: \u2018 \u2018 Under the holdings announced today, no one will be subject to prosecution for the sale or exposure of obscene materials unless these materials depicit or describe patently offensive \u2018 hard core \u2019 sexual conduct <em>specifically defined </em>by the regulating state law, as written or-construed. We are satisfied that these <em>specific prerequisites </em>will providmiair notice to a dealer in such materials that his <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"336\">*336</page-number>public and commercial activities may bring prosecution.\u201d (413 U. S., at p. 27; emphasis supplied.) The requirement of specificity expressed in the quoted language \u2014 that State statutes proscribing obscenity must specifically define the conduct to be regulated so as to give fair notice to purveyors of erotic material that their activities may invite prosecution \u2014 Could not have been stated in clearer, more unambiguous terms.</p>\n<p id=\"b388-5\">If there otherwise were doubt, the court also gave nonlimiting but illustrative examples of acceptable definitions:</p>\n<p id=\"b388-6\">\u201c (a) Patently offensive representations or descriptions of ultimate sexual acts, normal or perverted, actual or simulated.</p>\n<p id=\"b388-7\"><em>\u201c </em>(b) Patently offensive representation or descriptions of masturbation, excretory functions, and lewd exhibition of the genitals.\u201d (413 U. S., at p. 25.)</p>\n<p id=\"b388-8\">This example, too, draws attention both to the delineation of the acts and to the manner of their representation.</p>\n<p id=\"b388-9\">The majority of our court, in concluding today that we have so construed our statute as to provide the required overlay of specificity, relies principally on the concept of hard core pornography and states categorically that \u201c [w]e have applied the hard core pornography test with consistency both under former section 1141 of the Penal Law and under the current statute \u201d. I have two difficulties with reliance on this assertion, each in my view fatal to the conclusion reached by the majority.</p>\n<p id=\"b388-10\">In the first place, examination of the cases in our court refutes the statement. I find no reference, for instance, to any \u2018 \u2018 hardcore pornography \u201d test in the opinion in <em>People </em>v. <em>Kirkpatrick </em>(32 N Y 2d 17). In the opinion of our court in <em>Heller, </em>itself, (29 N Y 2d 319) we held there was a violation of the statute, but again entirely without reference to any \u201c hard-core \u201d test; in fact the result was based rather on the conclusion of the majority there that the film, <em>\u201c </em>Blue Movie\u201d, was \u201c simple pornography unrelieved by any merit \u201d (p. 321). Again in <em>People </em>v. <em>Fritch </em>(13 N Y 2d 119) while \u201c hard-core pornography \u201d was used as one of <em>\u201c </em>three of the established legal standards \u201d (p. 123) on which statutory violation was based, the holding of the court was subsequently overruled (see <em>Larkin </em>v. <em>Putnam\u2019s Sons, </em>14 N Y 2d 399, 404). My review of the cases <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"337\">*337</page-number>suggests that, rather than being followed consistently, after its announcement in <em>People </em>v. <em>Richmond County News </em>(9 N Y 2d 578), the hard core pornography test was used once as an alternative ground and with mixed results, in <em>Fritch, </em>and that it has since been entirely ignored in our court.</p>\n<p id=\"b389-5\">In the second place, even if the hard core pornography test announced in <em>Richmond County News {supra) </em>had been regularly followed, that test did not include a specific description of the sexual conduct or acts which would meet the new Supreme Court requirement. The hard core test itself, as the language of the opinion in <em>Richmond County News </em>demonstrates, focused on characterization of the acts rather than on their definition or description. Thus \u2014 \u2018\u2018 the test of the obscene, of the pornographic, is not in the tendency or appeal of the material, but rather in its content objectively appraised. * * * It focuses predominantly upon what is sexually morbid, grossly perverse and bizarre * * *. Recognizable \u2018 by the insult it offers, invariably, to sex, and to the human spirit \u2019 * * * it is to be differentiated from the bawdy and the ribald. Depicting dirt for dirt\u2019s sake, the obscene is the vile, rather than the coarse, the blow to sense, not merely to sensibility. It smacks, at- times, of fantasy and unreality, of sexual perversion and sickness \u201d (9 N Y 2d, at p. 587). The conclusion in <em>Richmond County News </em>was that the magazine then under scrutiny <em>\u201c </em>contains nothing which smacks of sick and blatantly perverse sexuality.\u201d <em>(Id.)</em></p>\n<p id=\"b389-7\">Evidently this test has no concern for the specific definition of sexual acts or conduct. Rather its focus is on the characterization, the quality of the acts performed. As Judge Scileppi wrote in the only other application of the hard core pornography test, in <em>Fritch, </em>the material \u201c must be viewed in juxtaposition to time, place and circumstance \u201d (13 N Y 2d, at p. 123).</p>\n<p id=\"b389-8\">In this sense the hard core pornography test is parallel to the requirement of the Supreme Court that, quite aside from the necessity for specific definition of the conduct, proscription may attach only if the act is depicted or described \u201c in a patently offensive way I note that the dual aspect of the requirement is unmistakably set forth in the Supreme Court\u2019s opinion in <em>Miller: \u201c </em>unless these materials depict or describe <em>patently </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"338\">*338</page-number><em>offensive \u2018 hard core </em>\u2019 sexual conduct <em>specifically defined </em>by the regulating state law, as written or construed \u201d (413 TL S., at p. 27; emphasis added). There are thus two facets to this branch of the test\u2014 (a) hard core and (b) specific definition. It must be evident that hard core (or depiction <em>\u201c </em>in a patently offensive way \u201d, in the diction of the Supreme Court [p. 24]) is a characterization which may or may not be applied to many sexual acts. The conclusion that the representation of the act is hard core depends, not on the act itself, but on the setting and the way in which the act is done, the overtones, the nuances, the message conveyed.</p>\n<p id=\"b390-5\">In my view, then, our court can only accurately be said to have gently laid the hard core pornography test aside. Even if there be no agreement with my reading of the cases in this respect, however, I nonetheless reach the conclusion that that test itself could only be equated to the requirement that the display be \u201c patently offensive \u201d. I do not find in the hard core test, or otherwise in the opinion of the majority in this case, that there had been any substitute by judicial construction of section 235.00 for the catalogue of sexual acts found acceptable by the Supreme Court in the statutes of Oregon and Hawaii. Nor do I find any equivalent of that court\u2019s more general illustrative list of defined sexual conduct \u2014 \u201c ultimate sexual acts \u201d, \u201c masturbation, excretory functions and lewd exhibition of the genitals \u201d.</p>\n<p id=\"b390-8\">Accordingly, I would hold section 235.00, both as written and as construed by our court, insufficient to meet the new and distinct specific-definition-of-conduct test laid down by the Supreme Court. Thus, in my view, it is unconstitutional. That being so, the convictions in both the cases now before us should be reversed and the complaints dismissed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b387-9\">1 note that four Justices in the Supreme Court without more would have held our statute unconstitutional.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-3\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b390-9\">Wachtler, J.</author>\n<p id=\"Ayx\">(dissenting). Under its decision in <em>Miller </em>v. <em>California </em>(413 U. S. 15) the United States Supreme Court gives this court two choices. We can declare our existing obscenity statute unconstitutional, reverse the judgments of conviction now before us, and await corrective action by the Legislature \u2014 or we can accept the Supreme Court\u2019s invitation to authoritatively construe the standards of <em>Miller </em>into our present statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b391-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"339\">*339</page-number>With the law concerning obscenity already a hodgepodge, the course of prudence dictates that we declare the existing statute constitutionally inadequate and leave the legislative function to the Legislature. Our alternative is to fashion the Emperor\u2019s new clothes, only to await the inevitable day we are asked to judge if the wardrobe fits. Since, in the end, the only real test of obscenity is the subjective perception of a majority of this court, the prospect of passing upon a home-made statute hardly seems becoming or appropriate.</p>\n<p id=\"b391-4\">In the obscenity field it is particularly important to have a statute which defines proscribed conduct with exacting preci- . sion. In order to perceive clearly the need for this statutory specificity, it is first necessary to examine the vagueness problem that is endemic with all obscenity prosecutions.</p>\n<p id=\"b391-5\">A robber, from a reading of our statutes, knows when he has committed a robbery. From the statutes he knows that if he intends to forcibly steal property from a person without that person\u2019s consent he has violated the law. He has perfect notice as to what the elements of the crime are (see, generally, Penal Law, \u00a7\u00a7 160.00-160.15). On the other hand, someone selling a book containing very explicit sex scenes has no such notice. He cannot know what is patently offensive or what offends the community by merely reading the statute. I do not think any court in the land would allow a statute to stand which states that it shall be illegal forcibly to steal property from a person in a manner which is patently offensive and is considered particularly deviant by community standards. The \u201c robber \u201d would have no way of knowing which robberies were circumscribed and which were allowed. Yet that is precisely what we have done with our obscenity law. I know of no way of ascertaining the community standard before a decision is rendered. Is a man to be convicted of displaying obscene material even though he successfully gouged the standards of New York City where the material was displayed because our court ultimately decided that the more stringent standards of Elmira were more reflective of State-wide standards?</p>\n<p id=\"b391-6\">It is now well settled that obscene material does not fall within the protection of the First Amendment of the United States Constitution <em>(Both </em>v. <em>United States, </em>354 U. S. 476, 486; <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"340\">*340</page-number><em>Miller, </em>at p. 23). Still, the effect of any vague or overbroad obscenity prohibition <em>ipso facto </em>encroaches on the First Amendment. Certainly, when the potential harm to society is great and the need for action compelling, we must at times allow the courts and Legislatures to run the risk of infringing or at least chilling the right to free speech. But I can see little justification for doing so where the activity being proscribed has only a speculatively harmful effect on society,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> and even that ineffable harm can be adequately circumscribed by the process of civil injunction.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> If there is to be a criminal statute without a pro<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"341\">*341</page-number>vision for civil injunction, there is absolutely no justification for not making/the statute as specific as possible.</p>\n<p id=\"b393-5\">A specifically defined obscenity statute will at least give a defendant notice that he is nearing the borders of permissible conduct. Such minimal notice is essential since the \u201c community standards\u201d and \u201cpatently offensive \u2019 \u2019<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> elements of the crime are so vague. Our statute, as authoritatively construed by our court clearly lacks the specificity necessary to give a defendant any adequate notice of proscribed conduct.</p>\n<p id=\"b393-6\">T am in total agreement with the legal axiom that whenever possible a court- should construe a legislative enactment in a way that would make it comply with the Constitution. But what we would have to do in this case goes far beyond construction. In order to make our statute constitutional, we would be doing more than construing it, we would be rewriting it. If a court were permitted to provide detailed provisions of a statute, then there would uever be a need to declare any statute unconstitutional for being too vague or overbroad. The judicial officer could merely assume a legislative role and rewrite the defective law. Although we often go .quite far to construe a statute in order to make it comply with the Constitution, the line should be drawn when judicial, construction becomes transmogrified into legislative creation.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b393-7\">Accepting the Supreme Court\u2019s invitation to rewrite our State obscenity statute is particularly unwise and unjust since the rewriting will be done piecemeal.- Obscenity cases lend themselves only to a case by case application (see <em>Mishkin </em>v. <em>New York, </em>383 U. S. 502, 516 [Black, J., dissenting]). It appears our court will add a new provision to the State obscenity law as each case arises depicting a heretofore unlitigated <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"342\">*342</page-number>(in this court) sexual display. Every individual unfortunate enough to be prosecuted under an as of yet unwritten (i.e., an act not previously \u201c construed \u201d by this court) portion of the State obscenity statute will be adjudged a criminal even though \u201che could not reasonably understand\u201d the activity \u201cto be proscribed \u201d <em>(United States </em>v. <em>Harriss, </em>347 U. S. 612, 617 [Warren, Ch. J.]).</p>\n<p id=\"b394-4\">The constitutional mandate \u00f3f giving every individual notice, of what conduct is criminally prohibited (see <em>Lanzetta </em>v. <em>New Jersey, </em>306 U. S. 451) will be violated every time an individual is arrested before we \u201c authoritatively construe \u201d that portion of the statute which applies to him. Such action smacks of judicial ex post facto legislation.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> (See <em>United States </em>v. Hanson, 9th Cir., No. 73-2603; <em>United States </em>v. <em>Long, </em>C. D. Calif., No. 10712-HP-CD.)</p>\n<p id=\"b394-5\">It is clear from a reading of today\u2019s decision that the obscenity field will remain a bothersome and burdensome one for the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"343\">*343</page-number>courts. It is bothersome enough that the courts, of necessity, must enter this morass as part of its judicial function. I think this court has compounded that burden and complexity by deciding today to also enter the field in a legislative capacity. Accordingly I dissent from the majority decision insofar as it holds our State criminal obscenity statute to be constitutional.</p>\n<p id=\"b395-5\">Judges Bubke, Bbeitel and Jasen concur with Judge Gabbielli; Judge Jones dissents and votes to reverse in an opinion in which Chief Judge Fuld and Judge Wachtleb concur; Judge Wachtleb dissents in a separate opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b395-6\">In <em>People </em>v. Heller: Upon reargument: Order affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b395-7\">In <em>People </em>v. <em>Buckley </em>and Goldstem: Order affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b392-4\">. The Supreme Court has asserted that obscenity is harmful to the \u201c quality of life\u201d and the \u201ctotal community environment\u201d <em>(Paris Adult Theatre I </em>v. <em>Slaton, </em>413 U. S. 49, 58). These conclusions like the alleged link between obscenity and antisocial behavior <em>(Paris, </em>at p. 61) are what the Supreme Court refers to as \u201c improvable assumptions \u201d that have been acted upon by civilized societies since the beginning of time <em>(Paris, </em>at p. 60, n. 11). In other words, it is just common sense that obscenity is harmful to society (see <em>Redlich </em>v. <em>Capri Cinema, </em>43 A D 2d 27). It is common sense to me that the majority of people within any given State, myself included, would find almost all of the material coming before this court in connection with obscenity prosecutions to be offensive and lacking in any value. But it is not a matter of common sense to me that the the majority who finds such material offensive will be harmed in any material way if it allows the minority which finds such material to have some value to partake of it. Indeed, allowing the minority of competent adults to read and view material found offensive to the majority would appear to me to be the hallmark of a truly free -society. Moreover, it is not a matter of common sense to me that a man should have to risk being put in jail for violating an undiscernible standard in order to gain some speculative protections for society as a whole.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b392-5\">. It is almost impossible to distinguish between protected and unprotected speech in the obscenity field (see <em>Paris Adult Theatre I </em>v. <em>Slaton, </em>413 U. S. 49, 73 [Brenetau, J., dissenting]). That does not necessarily mean that a State cannot outlaw obscenity. However, a criminal prosecution should be commenced only after a person has violated a civil injunction prohibiting the display of the material in question (see <em>Miller, </em>413 U. S., at p. 37 [Douglas J., dissenting]). The civil injunction would rid the community of the vexatious material as well as provide the possessor of the material with definite notice that his activity is in violation of a criminal statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b392-6\">\u2022 It should be noted that, although the majority of the Supreme Court did not think the civil injunction process to be constitutionally mandated, they appeared to agree strongly that the civil injunction process was the most certain method of combatting obscenity while at the same time making sure that an individual\u2019s constitutional rights remain inviolate <em>(Paris, </em>at p. 55, n. 4).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b393-8\">. A mere violation of the specifically worded provision of a statute (e.g., showing the genital area) is not a per se violation of part (b) of the <em>Miller </em>formula (413 U. S., at p. 25). The transgression of the statutory provisions must be \u201c patently offensive \u201d.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b393-9\">. Another reason why I think we should leave the rewriting of an obscenity statute to the Legislature is to allow it to define what community is encompassed by the-term \u201c community standards \u201d in part (b) of the <em>Miller </em>formulation (413 U. S., at p. 25). The majority of our court today has defined community in terms of the entire State. I think that question should be decided by the Legislature after hearings have been held on the matter.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b394-6\">. The majority protests that it is not laying down such a law because the defendants were convicted under a standard carrying a heavier burden of proof \u25a0 for the prosecutor than the one recently annunciated by the Supreme Court in <em>Miller. </em>It is true that part (c) of the <em>Miller </em>test is not as Remanding on the prosecutor as the \u201cutterly without.redeeming social value\u201d test of <em>Memoirs </em>v. <em>Massachusetts </em>(383 U. S. 413, 418). However part (b) of the <em>Miller </em>standard, mandating specificity of definition in State statutes, is more demanding of the prosecutor than was the ease under <em>Memoirs. </em>And even assuming <em>arguendo </em>that specificity has now been added to our statute by the majority decision in this case, it has come after the fact of the defendants\u2019 convictions. Moreover, in all future cases as this court adds specificity to the vague State statute, the creation of a valid law (i.e., by making it specific enough to be constitutional) will unarguably come after the defendant in question has-been convicted.</p>\n<p id=\"b394-7\">Actually, our present statute still contains the \u201cutterly without redeeming social value\u201d- test (Penal Law, \u00a7 235.00, subd. 1, par. [c]). The majority today asserts that under that test \u201c The clever pornographer need only infuse some social or political content into the work to escape successful prosecution \u201d. Yet, the majority then implicitly concedes that this court has, in effect, neglected the \"utterly without\u201d test in favor of the \u201cserious value taken as a whole\u201d <em>Miller </em>test for some time before <em>MiUer </em>came down. Such action may have shown great prescience as well as pragmatism on the part -of this court, but until the Legislature changes its <em>Memoirs </em>test to a <em>Miller </em>test, a disregard of the \"utterly without \u201d criteria amounts to judicial nullification of a duly passed and unarguably constitutional legislative act. This is then but another reason why the Legislature and not this court should refashion the criminal obscenity statute.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
