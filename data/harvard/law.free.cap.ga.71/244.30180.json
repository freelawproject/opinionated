M., justice court, said district being situated in the city of Augusta. Thomas pleaded to the jurisdiction of the court, alleging that, although he resided within the limits of the city of Augusta as they existed in 1834, he did not reside in the 398th district, G. M. This was admitted byplaintiff. The justice overruled the plea, and gave judgment for the plaintiff. Defendant appealed to the superior court; and at the April Term, 1883, the case was submitted to the presiding judge without a jury. He rendered judgment for the plaintiff, and defendant excepted.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b243-5\">J. S. &amp; W. T.

The act provides that \u201c each of the justices of the peace for the six hundredth, three hundred and ninety-eighth, one hundred and twentieth and one hundred and twenty-second districts, in the county of Richmond, shall extend over the whole corporate limits of the city of Augusta.\u201d It is conceded by counsel for plaintiff in error that, if the act of 1834 has been repealed, it is by virtue of an act approved July 21, 1879, entitled \u201cAn act to carry into effect paragraph 2, section seven, article six of the constitution, and to fix and prescribe the jurisdiction of justices of the peace and notaries public in this state, and to require them to hold their courts monthly at fixed times and places.\u201d Sec. 1st of the act provides that the jurisdiction shall extend in civil cases arising <em>ex </em>eontraetu, and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"246\">*246</page-number>in cases of injuries and damages to personal property, when the principal sum does not exceed one hundred dollars; and they shall hold their respective courts monthly, at fixed times and places.</p>\n<p id=\"b244-5\">These are the main provisions contained in the act of 1879. It is not in conflict with the act of 1834, before quoted. That act merely gives the j ustices of certain districts in Richmond county jurisdiction over the whole corporate limits of the city of Augusta, while the act of 1879 confines the jurisdiction of all justices of the peace and notaries public and <em>ex-officio </em>justices of the peace, in all civil cases arising <em>ex </em>contractu, and on injuries and damages to personal property, where the principal sum does not exceed one hundred dollars; and provides that their courts shall be held monthly, at fixed times and places. It will be perceived that the justices in Richmond county are, by the terms of the act of 18v9, limited as to the amount and subject matter of their jurisdiction, and are required to hold their courts monthly, and at fixed times and places, but the territorial extent of their jurisdiction is not limited or curtailed by the act of 1879. It remains the same as fixed by the act of 1834 in this respect.</p>\n<p id=\"b244-6\">Judgment affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b243-9\">Acts 1831, p. 89.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
