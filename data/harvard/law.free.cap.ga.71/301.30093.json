By the terms of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"304\">*304</page-number>contract, the Dade Coal Company was to have three hundred long term men, and to be kept up to that number*, and the other two companies were to divide the remainder into two equal parts, and they were to be kept equal during the period of the lease.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b302-5\">\u201c At the date of the passage of said act, the convicts were held underleases, which had been made in pursuance of the act of 1874.

After April 1, 1876, the McAfee convicts were turned over to it, under that clause in the act of 1876 which gave it two hundred and fifty convicts without charge <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"305\">*305</page-number>for three years.

On information and belief, it is stated that the Marietta <em>&amp; </em>North Georgia Railroad is indebted to the state $62,898.00, for which the state has a first lien on its property; that it also owes a large amount to one West, and others, and could not pay damages if recovered against it; neither could Nelms, and as to this case, both are insolvent. Nelms well knows, from the records in his office, that the railroad has received more convicts than it is entitled to under the act of 18v6; but he and the railroad company have combined to deprive complainants of the labor of 250 convicts, without any color of right.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"39\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b306-11\">\u2018\u2018Complainants further state, upon information and be<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"309\">*309</page-number>lief, that the said railroad company has kept the convicts furnished to it since April 1,1876, at work on said railroad but a small portion of the time; but has kept them most of the time on other works in which said railroad company had no interest whatever, and nas perverted the use of said convicts from the work of grading said railroad, for which purpose said convicts were furnished by the state, which wrongful conduct of said railroad company has all the time been well known to the said Nelms. But that the said Nelms, with such knowledge, has continued to deliver convicts, as charged in said bill, well knowing that their labor would iu a great measure be misapplied as aforesaid.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"40\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b307-5\">\u201cDiscovery is hereby waived, and complainants pray that the convicts now in possession of said railroad company be placed in possession of complainants.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"41\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b307-6\">This amendment was also sworn to by Lockett.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"42\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b307-7\">Nelms filed his separate answer, in brief, as follows:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"43\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b307-8\">He is a mere executive officer, and lias no pecuniary benefit or interest of any kind in the matters set forth in the bill; admits that the railroad company has been, up to tbe time of filing said bill, receiving convicts from nim as principal keeper of the penitentiary, and that, as appears from the books in his office, said railroad company has received in all as many convicts as would in the aggregate be equal to one man for nine hundred and forty-six years, yet he denies that it is now, or ever was, his purpose or intention to deliver to that company, after the first day of April, 1879, any more convicts than such a number as would give said company two hundred and fifty for three years.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"44\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b307-9\">\u201c When this defendant came into office as principal \u25a0keeper of the penitentiary, it was his understanding, and he found from the books and records of his office, and from information of James M.

The books and records of this defendant\u2019s office showed that there were 616 convicts on the 1st of April, 1874, and that number was made the basis of leasing under the act of 1874, both of the right to receive and the obligation to take all incoming convicts, by the several lessees, up to April 1st, 1879.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"45\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b308-5\">\u201c The lessees under the act of 1874, and the number of convicts originally taken by each lessee, are as follows: The Dade Coal Mine Company, 1001 J.

Amongst these changes, the North Eastern Railroad Company had surrendered its convicts, and the same had been released to Thomas Alexander, and the said Marietta <em>&amp; </em>North Georgia Railroad Company had possession of the convicts that had been nominally leased to Wallis, Haley <em>&amp; </em>Co., and their successors, and these convicts were working out the five years\u2019 lease under the act of 1874.

They claimed a distributive share of convicts under the act of 1874, the only change being that according to an agreement between themselves, the Dade coal mine company <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"311\">*311</page-number>was to have 300 convicts, and was to be kept up to that number until the 1st of April, 1879. Those rights and obligations were recognized and acted upon by each and every one of the lessees, with the exception of the said Marietta &amp; North Georgia Railroad Company, which claimed as its proportion more than had been assigned to it. When the administrators of Thomas Alexander surrendered the convicts held by said Alexander individually, numbering about 71, said convicts were claimed by William Phillips, president of the Marietta &amp; North Georgia Railroad Company, for said company; and W.

Denies that any of the convicts in its possession on April 1st,' 1879, should be charged against it as part of the two hundred and fifty allowed it by the act of 1S76; and denies that it has received that number.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"57\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b311-6\">. \u201c By the proviso to the second clause of the first section of the act of 1876, it is provided that if any railroad company had at that time any lease of convicts, and was working them at that time on its road, and its lease should expire before the leasing contemplated by the act of 1876 should be made, then said company might re-lease said convicts and as many more as it might desire, until its road was entirely completed.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"58\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b311-7\">\u201cAt the time of the passage of said act, this defendant was the lessee of 100 convicts under the act of 1871, under a lease to expire 1st of April, 1876, and was working them on its road, and had, under such lease, all the rights of the other lessees as to new convicts that might be sentenced.\u201d That this lease was in the name of J. M. McAfee <em>&amp; </em>Co., who were only trustees for the company, and were so known and recognised by the legislature and governor At the date of the passage of the act of February 28, 1876, and of the lease act of 1876, this was the only railroad working convicts on its road. Just before April 1, 1876, this defendant called the attention of the governor to the lease act of 1876, and the act of Eebrir ruary 28,1876, and the governor determined that this defendant had a right to retain the convicts it had whose terms expired on April 1, 1876, and to be consideren a lessee, under the proviso in the second clause of the first <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"314\">*314</page-number>section of the lease act. (See acts 1876, pages 40 <em>et seq.) </em>The president of the railroad (Mr. Phillips) then demanded the convicts and a re-lease, to which the governor agreed. As the company did not have to pay hire for the re-leased convicts, no bond was taken or required, nor was any formal contract or lease signed; it was notified to the principal keeper of the penitentiary, and all parties acted on the basis of it.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"59\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b312-5\">That when the Alexander convicts, numbering about 70? were surrendered, W. D. Grant, of Company No. 2, insisted that the quoia of the railroad was only 50, and it received them as lessee under the act of 1874, by reason of the proviso in the act of 1876; and so were all the convicts received by it up to April 1, 1879, as was known to complainants. So far from believing that the convicts received by the railroad from April 1, 1876, to April 1,1879, were a part of the 250 to which they were entitled for three years, under the act of 1876, members of companies Nos. 2 and 3 had made affidavits that when they contracted with the governor they believed the railroad was not entitled to 250 at all, but that after April 1, 1879, the three companies would receive them all.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"60\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b312-6\">\u201cAfter the contracts of lease with the complainants and Penitentiary Company No. 1 and the governor were signed, it was found impossible to organize the companies, and Company No. 2, by reason of the fact that none of said lessees under the act of 1874 were willing to surrender any convicts, and each claimed its right to have its quota of new convicts, so that there were no convicts for Penitentiary Company No. 2 to take or to get until 1st of April, 1879.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"61\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b312-7\">\u201c In the winter of 1876-7, say about 21st December, 1876, four convicts were assigned to defendant\u2014newly sentenced convicts, to which none but lessees under the act of 1874 were entitled, which this defendant certainly was only entitled, as lessee under the act of 1874, and the proviso to the 2d clause of the act of 1876. Governor Brown, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"315\">*315</page-number>Lockett, Low, Grant and other members of the said several companies, including complainants, induced the defendant to surrender to the state the said four convicts that the said companies might organize \u201d This was done, and they entered into some sort of contract among themselves, not material here.

M. McAfee &amp; Oo., and the other to make good the application filed with the governor 1st of April, 1876, for 250 convicts for three years.

Reiterates that, under the act of 1876, it was entitled to 250 convicts from April 1,1879; that being an incorporated railroad and having about 100 convicts at work on its road, it was entitled to a re-lease of them or so many more as it needed on the line of its road until completed. It has now 156, of whom 130 are able to do railroad work. Admits the passage of the resolution, of 1883, and states that a bond has been prepared thereunder by the governor, which it has forwarded to Kinsey, its president, who lives in Cincinnati, Ohio; but denies that the resolution is violative of any valid contract; and asserts that it was passed with the formality of an act.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"73\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b314-10\">A demurrer to the bill was also filed.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"74\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"A79j\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"317\">*317</page-number>The application for inj unci ion came on to be heard before Hon. <em>W. </em>R.

The primary object was to bid for the work to be done in grading the Marietta &amp; North Georgia Eailroad.

The contracts of lease were to be made under the provisions of the act of 1876, and those provisions were, at one time and another during the pendency of the negotiations, very fully discussed between the gentlemen named and deponent: The rights of the Marietta <em>&amp; </em>North Georgia Railroad Company under the act were referred to more than once between us, and deponent distinctly remembers that the interest of the company was spoken of very lightly, it being the opinion expressed that the company would not be able to take care of the convicts which the law gave it, and that the convicts would very soon have to be distributed among the other lessees. In all these negotiations, it was understood by me that the lessees would take the. convicts subject to the provisions of the law under which the lease was to be made, and that the rights of said railroad company were secured by the provisions. The term of the lease was to be for twenty years, and the right of said company to 250 convicts was to be, under the law, for a period of three years, or until certain work had been done on the railroad. It was my understanding, and I thought the understanding of the gentlemen with whom I negotiated, that their companies were to take all the convicts under their contract after the railroad company\u2019s term expired, but that the law fixed the term of the railroad company, and that in any event the company was to have the convicts.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"116\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b321-5\">\u201c My recollection is that the convicts which the said railroad company had on its road in the early part of 1876, after the expiration of the lease, say April 1,1876, were permitted to remain in the hands of the company under a provision of the law which allowed an incorporated company to take a new lease of its convicts. General Phillips, for his company, contended that he ought not to give a bond. I required a bond to be given. This contention caused considerable delay, but at last the bond was given. Deponent\u2019s recollection is that the three years\u2019 term of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"324\">*324</page-number>the railroad company was not to commence until April 1, 1879, when the twenty year term of the lessees was to commence. My recollection further is that no rental was charged the railroad company, because the legislature had indicated very clearly by its legislation that nothing was to be charged the company.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"117\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b322-6\">\u201c In the absence of the record I cannot speak positively, but the best of my recollection is that the convicts turned over to the said railroad company were let upon the same terms as those which remained with the company at the expiration of the lease on April 1,1879.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"118\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b322-7\">This affidavit was made November 26, 1879.

Affiant further says, refreshed as his memory has been by reading said bond5 he is now clear that he, as governor, caused to be delivered no convicts to said company after first of April, 1876, ex. cept as part of the 250 it was entitled to under the act of 1876.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"119\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b323-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"325\">*325</page-number>Affidavit of P.

Phillips, <em>President.\u201d</em></summary>\n<summary data-order=\"126\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b324-6\">Testimony of William Phillips (offered by defendants), in brief, as follows: In 1874, Wallis, Haley &amp; Company organized for the purpose of building the Marietta &amp; North Georgia Railroad. They obtained a lease of 100 convicts for two years, at $11.00 per capita, per annum. The railroad company was re-organized,and contracted' with Wallis, Haley &amp; Company to do the work at stipulated prices. Hie railroad was (o pay in cash a sufficient amount to defray actual expenses, and' the balance in stock.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"127\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b324-7\">\u201c The railroad company at that ti me did not have the means to pay these expenses, nor means to purchase tools and furnish necessary supplies to support the convicts, and for this reason Wallis, Haley &amp; Co. sought and obtained a contract on the Fair Grounds at Oglethorpe Park, Atlanta, and there worked the hands for a short time. When subscriptions to the capital stoek as was deemed sufficient had been paid in, Wallis, Haley &amp; Co. brought the hands to Marietta, and commenced work on the grade, under the contract mentioned, but I do not remember that the advances made by Wallis, Haley, and Reid, and perhaps Hammett, were ever refunded to this day. H. B. Wallis was first in charge of the convicts, superintending the work, and until some three to five miles were graded, and then C. B. Howard, another member of the company, took charge and controlled the hands, and worked them until the grade was about completed to Little River, in Cherokee county. The railroad company failing to supply sufficient means to maintain the convicts and do the work, and for perhaps other reasons also, the company of Wallis, Haley &amp; Co. divided; and O. B. Howard and his party <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"327\">*327</page-number>took one-half of the convicts and one-half of the property, as was agreed upon among themselves, and started them to Flint River to work them on a cotton farm. I notified the governor, and Governor Smith canceled the lease to Wallis, Haley &amp; Go. On the division alluded to, about one-lialf the old members of Wallis, Haley &amp; Go. united with others and organized a company known as Field, McAfee, Tate <em>&amp; </em>Co., and took possession of the convicts left on the road. When Governor Smith canceled the lease of Wallis, Haley <em>&amp;. Go. </em>he re-leased all the convicts held by Wallis, Haley &amp; Co. to Field, McAfee, Tate &amp; Co. for the remainder of their term ; that is until the 1st of April, 1876. The Marietta &amp; North Georgia Railroad Company renewed, or rather made the same contract with Field, McAfee, Tate &amp; Co., as with Wallis, Haley &amp; Co. Additional subscriptions to the capital stock were obtained, hut not sufficient to pay the expenses of working the convicts until the grade was completed to Canton. The individual members of the contracting company made advances to support the convicts, and have not as yet been settled with as contracted by the railroad company. When the grade reached Canton, Field, McAfee, Tate &amp; Co. surrendered the convicts under their lease, and then another company was organized, known as <em>J. </em>M. McAfee <em>&amp;Co. </em>This company was composed of J. M. McAfee, H. M. Hammond, (Hammett?) C. D. Phillips, W. H. Haskins and myself. We applied for the convicts held or surrendered by Field, McAfee, Tate &amp; Co., and governor Smith re-leased to us on the same terms, and for the remainder of the original term of Wallis, Haley &amp; Co., until the 1st of April, 1876. Additional subscriptions were obtained, and J. M: McAfee <em>&amp; Go. </em>worked the convicts under the same' contract with the railroad company as had been made with Wallis, Haley &amp; Co., and with Field, McAfee, Tate &amp; Co., except that there was no contract in writing with J. M. McAfee &amp; Co. and the Marietta &amp; North Georgia Railroad Company.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"128\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b325-5\">\u201cThe subscription was small, and not sufficient to sup<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"328\">*328</page-number>port the convicts for only a few months. During this time the convicts were worked in extending the grade into Marietta, as Wallis, Haley <em>&amp; Go. </em>had commenced outside of the city limits. They were also worked in sub-grading to prevent some washes and in getting out cross-ties and timber, as we then hoped to get iron, and a part were worked by W. A. Haskins in the Franklin gold mine. When the subscription gave out and we could get no more, we worked a part on the mill-dam and canal, W. P. Anderson had a part under him; a part in building fish pond for Maj. Winn. I worked a part on my farm, and for a few days in building a fish pond on home lot; a portion worked for Mr. R. 0. Kerr, and for E. A. Withers. I don\u2019t now remember anybody else for whom the convicts held by J. M. McAfee &amp; Co. worked. At the then prices of labor and prices of provisions during the winter months of 1875 and 1876, the convicts were a burden on J. M. McAfee <em>&amp; </em>Co^ and were worked about from place to place wherever one could get employment and make enough to support them, hoping that in some way we would be enabled to raise the means to put them regularly on the road. I have no means of knowing positively where the convicts held by J. M. McAfee &amp; Oo. were at work on the 25th day of February, 1876, nor what particular work they were doing, nor do I remember the exact number we then held; but my best recollection is, that J. M. McAfee <em>&amp; </em>Oo. had from eighty to one hundred convicts; that a portion were in camp near Marietta, and the others working in different squads for different people. These convicts were not leased to the Marietta &amp; North Georgia Railroad Company, but to J. M. McAfee &amp; Co., who held them for and in the interest of the Marietta &amp; North Georgia Railroad as is stated in preamble to act of 1876 (I think page 1); and we held them not for individual profit, but for the purpose and with the hope, of making some arrangement to have them worked on the Marietta &amp; North Georgia Railroad* We lost and suffered pecuniarily out of our own pockets, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"329\">*329</page-number>and have never\u2019been refunded. We held these convicts until about the 1st of June, 1876, when having, as president of the railroad company, made an arrangement with the citizens of Eannin county to commence at the state line and grade through their county south of the Gilmer line, about the 1st of June, 1876, Geo. M. Manning and M. McKinney carried the convicts held by J. M. McAfee A Co. to Eannin, and commenced work on the grade at the state line; except probably five convicts who were then working for J. M. McAfee, and some two or three left with W. A. Haskins on account of the severe illness of one who required care. My recollection is that, as they went up, a squad was left at the White Path gold mines, and worked in the mines by H. Van Wyck &amp; Go. This squad remained at the White Path gold mines until, as I remember, in September, 1876, when they were carried to Fannin and added .to the force on the grade.\" Impossible to give exact dates from memory. On or about April 1,1876, applied in writing for convicts granted the railroad under lease act of 1876. Wa3 impressed that meeting of directors had been held before April 1, and that witness, R. F. Maddox, and J. M. McAfee were appointed to make the application. On refreshing his memory, finds meeting was held May 10, 1876, and that parties named were then \u00a3 appointed to contract with the governor for the conviccs allotted to the road, give necessary bond ; etc. Application by witness was made on April 1, 1876; presumes it must have been made under his general powers as president. \u201c When I made the application, Governor Smith expressed a desire to do whatever he could as executive to advance the interests of the road; but said that the convicts were disposed of by former leases under act of 1874, until the expiration of the five years\u2019 lease or rental, April 1st, 1879. The application was left with Governor Smith, and was filed in the executive department, and I suppose is now there.\u201d Is informed that on Feb. 25,1876, no other railroad in the state was working convicts; does not know it of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"330\">*330</page-number>his own knowledge. \u201c <em>J. </em>M. McAfee &amp; Co.\u2019held the convicts, working them, as stated in the answer tc the second interrogatory, until I had arranged to put them to work in Fannin county, as stated in answer to second interrogatory.\u201d Acted upon his convictions as to right of road to 250 convicts, and arranged to work the force in Gilmer and Fannin counties, and a partial arrangement to work a part on Ducktown branch, and tried to arrange for Pickens county to work remainder.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"129\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b328-5\">When Stevens convicts were surrendered, claimed them for road. Alexander, president of company No. 3, denied this right, as he claimed that all had been leased by companies Nos. 1, 2, and 3. The governor awarded them to the railroad, and they were carried to Gilmer county, some forty in number, as witness recollects.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"130\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b328-6\">\u201c These convicts were worked by the citizens of Gilmer until they graded some five miles, or perhaps more.

Alexander endeavored to prevent a bond being given; and witness insisted it was unnecessary, as an incorporated railroad stood upon a different footing from lessees of convicts; the governor required a bond. \u201c My best recollection is that two bonds were made during this controversy, but I only remember with certainty to delivering one to Gov. Smith, and that one is the bond with the blank number of convicts. * * * My then convictions (were), that we were entitled to 250 convicts, and as many more as we needed. I remember no disagreement with Gov. Smith as to the law or the rights of the company, except that he required a bond, which I insisted was not required by the act, and that I insisted on the full <em>quota., </em>250 convicts, and Gov. Smith said we could only get our <em>pro rata </em>until the expiration of the leases under act of 1874.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"132\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b328-8\">The administrator of Alexander surrendered, as witness <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"331\">*331</page-number>understood, about seventy convicts; witness demanded them for the railroad, but was informed that <em>W. </em>D. Grant objected, on the ground that the road had no right to convicts until April 1,1879. Witness got about 50 of these convicts; heard that Gov. Brown received about 20. Lochrane, the attorney of Lockett\u2019s company, knows witness\u2019 claim; treated with him as attorney. About December, 1876, Penitentiary Co. No. 2, desired to organize, but could not do so, because none of the lessees would surrender any convicts to them. Lockett and Lowe urged witness to surrender some convicts to enable them to organize. Refused to surrender any from the road, but desired to aid them, if possible, without injury to the railroad. After consulting with McAfee, Hammett and Maddox, and the use of much persuasion with the last named, it was agreed that four convicts under sentence in the jail of Eulton county should be assigned to the railroad, and witness, as its president, should make a formal surrender of them to the state.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"133\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b329-5\">\u201c It was proposed to give me a written obligation, supplemented by personal pledges, that the transaction should not in any way affect the rights of the Marietta and North Georgia Railroad Company,' and Judge Lochrane, representing Lockett, knew well our claim. There was a meeting of the stockholders of the different companies, and I submitted the written agreement, a copy of which is on record in book of minutes. I cannot state positively all who were present, but Senator Joseph E. Brown, Colonel Thomas Alexander, Judge John L. Hopkins, Judge O. A Lochrane, B. G. Lockett, W. B. Lowe, and W. D. Grant, Avere of the number. I asked Governor Brown, as a friend of the enterprise, to read the paper, and as a lawyer and friend to give me his opinion as to Avhether the rights of our company, would be jeopardized; and he did so, and stated that, in his opinion, I would run no risk. I then handed the paper to Judge Hopkins, who read it and said it was a recognition of our rights. All concurred in this <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"332\">*332</page-number>opinion, and when the paper was signed, I walked over to the jail, and saw some prisoners whom I supposed to be convicts and who were pointed out to me as convicts, and then made a written surrender of these convicts, and sent it to the governor. J udge Lochrane was acting for Penitentiary Company No. 2, in having us make the surrender, and it was with him we treated and had our discussions principally. Senator Brown represented Penitentiary Company No. 1; J udge Hopkins, as I understood, represented Penitentiary Company No. 3 ; Judge Lochrane represented company No. 2. I do not know where the original agreement is.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"134\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b330-5\">\u201cOn the 1st April, 1879, or a short time before, my recollection is that I made a written demand for two hundred and fifty convicts for three years from 1st April, 1879. * * * Governor Colquitt ruled or decided that the Marietta <em>&amp; </em>North Georgia Railroad Company had had as many as one hundred convicts from April, 1876, to April, 1879, and that our company was entitled to one hundred and fifty from 1st April, 1879, to 1st April, 1882, making two hundred and fifty convicts for three years. I don\u2019t know what became of the writing.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"135\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b330-7\">Reiterates the account already given of the application by witness for convicts, and the making of the bond attached to the bill, and says: \u201c I wanted, and asked for, the two hundred and fifty convicts, and had arranged to work them, as I then thought; and my proposition as to working them had been indorsed by the directors at Elijay. Gov Smith said that he could not give us our <em>quota, </em>as claimed, until the expiration of leases under act of 1874; and the fact that he held the bond without any specified number I regarded as holding to cover and make good the \u2018 obligation\u2019 required by the governor under the statutes, .when we should get our <em>quota. </em>I do not say that Gov. Smith said he would hold the bond for this special purpose ; all that I recollect that he did say was that the convicts were leased under act of 1874, and that he could not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"333\">*333</page-number>give us the two hundred and fifty convicts until the expiration of the lease of 1874. But his refusal to insert the number of convicts asked was to me a denial of two hundred and fifty until 1st April, 1879, and that he allowed us to hold the convicts we then held. As stated before, my impression is that the Marietta <em>&amp; </em>North Georgia Railroad Company did execute another bond. I can recall no fact fixing exact time, place, or stipulations of said bond. My recollection is that it was signed by Maddox and Hammett, as treasurer of the securities, and my belief is, about the same time as the bond.\u201d The penitentiary committee of the legislature had a bond before them,- with other papers; saw the bond in the office of the principal keeper; recollection is that senator Holcombe took it or had it; does not remember contents; did not read it, and can recall no fact which would enable witness to say whether the original of the bond copied above was before the committee or not. Wallis, Haley &amp; Co., Field, McAfee, Tate &amp; Co., and J. M. McAfee &amp; Co., each gave bond. The bond signed by witness as president, R. F. Maddox, J. M. McAfee and W. A. Haskins as securities, is the first bond witness knows positively to have been given by the railroad company for convicts. It is cheaper to work a large force of convicts than a small one; chief engineer, bookkeeper and other managers, except guards, would be the same for 250 as for 150; the -company never had 250 at any one time within witness\u2019s knowledge; impossible to state relative value of 83 convicts for nine years and .250 for three years; more economical to work the 250 for three years.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"136\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b331-5\">\u201c The failure to get the 250 convicts caused want of confidence in the enterprise and a doubt as to its ever being completed, and delayed the work when it might have been done. With ample means to properly feed, guard, care for and work 250 convicts, it is much cheaper than to work a less number for a longer time to make equal the days\u2019 work of two squads. But from the first organization of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"334\">*334</page-number>the company until I left the road, there were times when I had to support them on a credit, by hard begging; and the greater the number, the greater the difficulty in supporting them. On the other hand, there were times when we could have hired out to better advantage one-half and worked the other half on the road, and greatly facilitated the enterprise, if we had had the full 250 convicts. On the whole, the convicts, with comparatively little help, have built the road thus far, for they have produced largely the values which will make the road.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"137\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b332-5\">Is not employed in this case, and has no agreement concerning it; did all he could as vice-president of railroad company until he <em>u </em>became virtually disconnected with the company.\u201d As I remember, on 1st April, 1870, the railroad company had no means to support the convicts, and J. M. McAfee <em>&amp; </em>Oo. held them and worked them, as stated in answer to direct interrogatory.\u201d Witness believed that \u25a0 J. M. McAfee &amp; Oo. had a written contract with the railroad, but finds none; but they were \u201c treated as having worked under similar contracts with the two preceding \u25a0 companies.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"138\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b332-8\">\u201c I believed that J. M. McAfee &amp; Oo. had a contract in writing with the Marietta <em>&amp; </em>North Georgia Railroad Company similar to that of Wallis, Haley <em>&amp; </em>Oo., Field, McAfee, Tate &amp; Oo., but by reference to the book of minutes I find none; but that J. M. McAfee &amp; Oo. were afterwards treated . as having worked under similar contracts with the two preceding companies. I have inquired of the secretary, H. M. Hammett, and he has no such paper in his office. I \u25a0\u25a0attempted to get original, but find that the contract was only by common consent of such of the stockholders as took any interest in the matter, and not in writing. The fact is that the railroad was about deserted by everybody except J. M. McAfee &amp; Oo., and there was nobody to contract with nor treat with, except as we met the stockholders individually. Ool. W. A. Haskins subscribed $500.00 to support convicts we worked on the road, and became one <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"335\">*335</page-number><em>of the </em>company of J. M. McAfee <em>&amp; </em>Go; went into the company upon the condition that he should have a given number of convicts to work in his gold mine, the old Franklin mine in Cherokee county. This fact had escaped my memory until I was investigating the facts to answer your question.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"139\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b333-5\">u I have answered this question in my answer to direct interrogatory. I stated where they worked, but now remember, in addition, that a squad was worked for digging out cellar for Dr. A. Reynolds in Marietta. I have\u2019no means of knowing or ascertaining how many, or how long, the convicts leased to J. M. McAfee &amp; Co. worked on the railroad. Tiie Haskins squad of some twenty-five were carried from Canton to the Franklin gold mine, and remained there until they were carried to the upper counties in June, 1878. The remainder worked on the Marietta &amp; North Georgia Railroad until our subscriptions gave out, and until, speaking for myself, I could not support them longer, and if anybody else could, they would not; and we were forced to hire and work them as wo could, to support them, or surrender them to the state. \u2022 I did not manage, hire, or work the convicts during this time, except when nobody else would, and it was a necessity to hold them, but was often trying to arrange to put them back on the road, and hence I can\u2019t answer your question'with exactness. * *</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"140\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b333-6\">I have no books or record of any sort, and therefore answer from memory. My recollection is, about eighty <em>io </em>one hundred convicts were carried from Fannin to the Cherokee Iron Company (Mr. A. G. West, president). This force was increased from the jails.' I did not keep the books showing the number and names, and cannot give names or number of tlie convicts worked for the Cherokee Iron Company. * <em>* </em>When Maddox <em>&amp; </em>Co. turned over the road in April or May, 1879,1 hired a part of the force worked by them on tbe road to the Cherokee Iron Company, to support another squad in working on the road. Sometime in 1880 I removed fifty convicts'from the Cher<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"336\">*336</page-number>okee Iron. Company to the Macon <em>&amp; </em>Brunswick Rrailroad, and left, as I remember (not certain), about sixty convicts with the Cherokee Iron Company. This squad, less the discharges, remained with the Cherokee Iron Company until, as I remember, the summer of 1881, when they were turned over to the Georgia Railroad, Eager and his assistants on the Marietta &amp; North Georgia Railroad. I remember that in 1880, W. R. Power, book-keeper for the Marietta &amp; North Georgia Railroad Company, reported over ten thousand dollars paid to the company from the proceeds of this labor (which report is of file in the executive department), and expended on the road. The first convicts worked fo\u201d the Cherokee Iron Company at forty cents per cord cutting coal wood; seventy-five cents per day for able-bodied men in ore bank. The Marietta &amp; North Georgia Railroad Company were at all the expense of caring for them, and guarding, etc. There was quite a large squad, when received from Fannin, disabled, and requiring medical treatment. In December, after they went from the Cherokee Iron Company, as I remember, N. A. Eaves took charge and worked them under another contract, which I cannot state with accuracy, but the books will show. Then Maddox <em>&amp; </em>Co. worked them for the Cherokee Iron Compan y. I cannot give their contract without the books. The last hiring by me, as president, to the Cherokee Iron Company was, as I remember, for about thirty-five or forty of the best hands. The Cherokee Iron Company agreed to pay $12.60 per month, and $7.60 for the remainder. For several convicts nothing was paid. Under this low contract, the Cherokee Iron Company was' to pa.y all expenses of every kind.

I have no means of telling how many convicts were delivered to said company since April, 1871. My recollection is that J. M. McAfee <em>&amp; </em>Co. secured 104, turned over by Field, McAfee, Tate <em>&amp; </em>Co., and I think G. M. Manning and McKinney carried about seventy or eighty of this number to Fannin county, to be worked on the road in June, 1876. That the Haskins squad was added to this number, but that a part stopped at White Path gold mines, and were afterwards carried to Fannin county. I remember no increase of the force received by J. M. McAfee &amp; Co. from Field, McAfee, Tate &amp; Co. from the jails, but I think there was. Some were discharged before they went to Fannin. In July, 1876, I think, forty of the Stevens hands were received and turned over to Gilmer county. Quite a number were discharged, and some pardoned, while in Gilmer and Fannin. About one hundred were carried to Cedartown. Then the force was considerably increased from the jails, but the number I cannot tell, not even an approximate. Next was about fifty from Broomhead in 1878. The remainder has been from the jails. All that JDr. Thomas Raines, surgeon, adjudged able-bodied, long-termed, were taken from the company April 1st, 1879, and place supplied b,y short-term men. After this, the force was increased from the jails until 1882, as I remember the company had over two hundred. I have not, and cannot give names or number, or term of service. I have not the custody or control of any book or paper containing the information asked.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"143\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b335-7\">\u201c As already stated, I cannot tell where and how each <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"338\">*338</page-number>convict has been employed or worked. Wallis, Haley &amp; Co. worked altogether on the Marietta &amp; North Georgia Railroad, after removal to Marietta, and so did Field, McAfee &lt;fe Co., except squad sent to Haskins, until forced to hire them out, as hereinbefore stated, to support them. The Stevens hands worked in Gilmer on the grading for several months, and were surrendered to the company, and I sent them to Fannin, as before stated. From June, 1876, to summer of 1877, the J. M. McAfee &amp; Co. hands worked in Fannin on the road; the citizens of Gilmer and Fannin refusing to support them longer, they, with the Stevens hands, were employed in cutting wood. Of this force about one hundred went to Oedartown, and a part worked for the Cherokee Iron Company, and a part for Macon &amp; Brunswick Railroad until 1881. But a part of this time the force was less, and at others more. When the road was put in repair from Marietta to Canton in 1880, a force was turned over to me by Maddox <em>&amp; </em>Co. I had no means to support them, and worked a squad of forty or fifty on street leading from depot into Canton; they worked there two or three weeks. The road and convicts were turned over to me by Maddox &amp; Co. without a dollar to support them. I had to work them as best I could to support themselves, until I could make arrangements to put them to work again on the railroad, put on the grade north of Canton, supported by convicts worked for Cherokee Iron Company and for Macon <em>&amp; </em>Brunswick Railroad, and by proceeds of operation of the railroad; I have already stated work done by J. M. McAfee &amp; Co. for different parties. A squad of about twenty worked for J. M.

Nelms, principal keeper of the penitentiary, of Eulton county; in which bill complainants alleged that, under the act approved February 25th, 1876, the governor was authorized to lease out the convicts of the state for the term of twenty years: that on the 21st of June, 1876, the governor, in pursuance of said act, entered into a contract with the Dade Coal Company and complainants, by which he did lease the said convicts to said three companies for the term of twenty years, from April 1st, 1879; that by the provisions of said act, before the lessees of said convicts were entitled to any of said convicts, two hundred and fifty of them should be assigned to the Marietta &amp; North Georgia Railroad Company for the space of three years. That the governor, in pursuance of said act, did assign said railroad company the number to which it was entitled, and that since that time said company was claiming more of said convicts; and that said Nelms, well knowing that said company had received all it was entitled to under said act, was assigning to it more convicts, and threatened to continue to assign convicts to it. All this, they allege, was contrary to law, and in disregard of the rights of complainants.</p>\n<p id=\"b343-6\">To this bill an answer was filed by Nelms and the railroad company, in which they insisted that the railroad company had not received the number of convicts allowed under the act of 1876. They also insisted that the superior court of Eulton county had no jurisdiction of said case.</p>\n<p id=\"b343-7\">A hearing was had before Hon. George Hillyer, Judge of the Atlanta circuit; his decision was brought to this court for review. (See case reported in 67 <em>Ga. Rep., </em>page 565.) This court then held that the superior court of Eul<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"346\">*346</page-number>ton county had jurisdiction of said case. Nelms, as principal keeper of the penitentiary, was enjoined from turning over the convicts, as prayed for. It was provided that the injunction might be dissolved by giving bond. It appears, from the record in the case, that bond was given by the railroad company. It further appears that on the 16th of October, 1883, complainants amended their bill, repeating the charges in the original bill and amendments, and further alleged that the contracts made by the state of Georgia with Georgia Penitentiary Companies One, Two, and Three, were still of force. That complainants had complied with their part of said contracts. They further allege that, since the date of said contracts, the Marietta <em>&amp; </em>North Georgia Railroad Company has received largely more than two hundred and fifty convicts for three years. Complainants charge, that on the 26th day of September, 1883, the legislature of Georgia passed the following resolution :</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b344-5\"><em>\u201cResolved </em>by the Senate, the House concurring, that the governor be, and he is hereby instructed to direct the keeper of the penitentiary to turn over to the Marietta &amp; North Georgia Railroad Company two hundred and fifty able bodied convicts, to be worked for the benefit of said railroad company for the full space of three years, or until the main line of said railroad is completed to the North Carolina line, and the Duck Town branch is completed to the Tennessee line, and the Dahlonega branch is finished to its intersection with the Gainesville and Dahlonega Railroad.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b344-6\"><em>\u201cResolved, further, </em>that no more women convicts, nor old and infirm convicts be furnished said company.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b344-7\">Complainants further allege that the convicts mentioned are part of those included in their contract, and for which they pay hire.</p>\n<p id=\"b344-8\">They insist that said resolution impairs the obligation of the contracts they have made with the state, and is, therefore, null and void. They charge that John W. Nelms, principal keeper of the penitentiary, will deliver the convicts to the defendants, unless restrained, and enjoined by the courts. They claim that their damages are irrepara<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"347\">*347</page-number>ble; and, therefore, pray that an injunction issue, restaaining Nelms from delivering, and the railroad company from receiving, the convicts.</p>\n<p id=\"b345-5\">To this bill, as amended, defendants filed a demurrer and answer, by. which they insist that said resolution does not impair the obligation of any contract; and they also claim, that there are no such corporations as Georgia Peniten \u2022 tiary Companies Nos. 2 and 3.</p>\n<p id=\"b345-6\">A hearing was had before Hon. <em>W. </em>R. Hammond, judge of the Atlanta circuit. Much testimony was introduced, and after considering the case, Judge Hammond held that most of the questions made in the bill, as amended, had been decided by this court, in the case reported in 65 <em>Ga., </em>Rep., page 70. He held that so much of the resolution of 1883 as provided that \u201cno mor women convicts, nor old and infirm convicts be furnished to the railroad company,\u201d was null and void; and John W. Nelms was restrained by injunction from carrying into effect this part of said resolution. He refused to grant an injunction, restraining Nelms, as principal keeper, from delivering convicts under the resolution (except as before stated), holding that the other questions made had already been decided by this court.</p>\n<p id=\"b345-7\">To this ruling and decision of Judge Hammond both complainants and defendants sued out bills of exceptions, and said decision is now here for review. Pending the argument here, defendants in error withdrew their bill of exceptions.</p>\n<p id=\"b345-8\"><bracketnum>1.</bracketnum> The act of the legislature of this state, passed in 1876,. authorizing the governor to lease the convicts of the state to certain penitentiary companies, is constitutional and valid.

Each company shall pay the amount of annual hire fixed by such adjustment promptly on the last day of each year.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b347-5\">\u201cAnd the said three companies, each acting for itself as a separate and distinct company, and each assuming its own proportion of the obligations above mentioned, and no more, having accepted the foregoing modifications of their respective bids suggested by the governor; it is agreed by said companies, each one acting separately for itself, and by James M. Smith, governor of 'said state, that the said convicts be leased to said three companies above named, in the proportion as to the number of convicts and upon the terms herein-before specified; each company to give bond, with approved security, for its own part of the obligation devolved upon it by the acceptance of the bid, modified as aforesaid, in the following sums, to-wit:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b347-6\">\u201c The Georgia Penitentiary Company No. 1, composed of the Dade Coal Company, in the sum of twenty-five thousand dollars.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b347-7\">\u201cThe Georgia Penitentiary Company No. 2, composed of B.

D. Grant, W. W. Simpson, John W. Murphey and William H. Howell, the sum of thirty-seven thousand dollars, each of said bonds to have proper conditions for the management, control and safe keeping of said convicts according to law and to the rules and regulations prescribed for the government of the penitentiary, and in view of the fact that existing contracts of lease may be canceled before the first day of April, 1879, (the time when all the present leases expire) it is further agreed that in all such cases the lessees under this contract shall take possession of all convicts which may thus fall upon the hands of the state, and shall hold, manage and control the same according to the provisions of this contract, and of their bonds given under the same, and shall be respectively bound to pay for said convicts until the first day of April, 1879, at the rate of eleven dollars per <em>capita </em>per annum.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b347-9\">This contract of lease was signed by the governor and by the officers of the penitentiary companies named. And in pursuance with said contract bonds were given, and on the 22d day of June, 1876, an executive order was made by the governor, accepting the bonds and contracts j and by said order the companies were declared' to be corporations, and the names of the officers of said companies were entered on the minutes of the executive department.</p>\n<p id=\"b348-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"350\">*350</page-number>Under <em>the </em>contracts thus made by the lessees, should they fail at the end of any year, to pay the amount agreed upon for the hire of the convicts, by an act passed in 1876, the comptroller general could issue an, execution for said amount not paid. Under the contract, as herein set forth, Penitentiary Companies Nos. 1, 2 and 3 contend that they are entitled to the services of all the convicts (except 250 <em>to </em>Marietta &lt;fc North Georgia Railroad for .three years,) for a period of twenty years from April 1,1879, the date at which leases under the act of 1871 expired. Defendants insist that the Marietta <em>&amp; </em>North Georgia Railroad Company was an incorporated railroad company working convicts when the act of 1876 was passed, and as such, insist that they are entitled not only to 250 for three years, but are entitled to a re-lease of convicts under the act of 1876, in preference to the rights of complainants. And defendants further insist that the state of Georgia, notwithstanding lease contracts have been entered into by it, has the right to withdraw from such contracts at its pleasure.</p>\n<p id=\"b348-5\">The constitution of the United States provides that no state shall pass any law impairing the obligation of contracts (See Sec. 9, Const.). This court holds that the inhibition in the constitution that prevents a state from passing a law impairing the obligations of contracts, applies to contracts made by the state, as well as to contracts made between citizens of the state.</p>\n<p id=\"b348-6\">Cooley on Constitutional Limitations very pertinently submits the following inquiry: \u201cIs a grant from a state excluded from the operation of the provision ? Is the clause to be considered as inhibiting the state from impairing the obligations of contracts between two <em>individuals; </em>but has excluded from that inhibition contracts made with the state itself? The words themselves contain no such distinction \u2022 they are general, and are applicable to contracts of every description.\u201d Story, in his Commentaries on the Constitution of the United States, insists that a grant by the state, as well as executed contracts, comes within the prohibition of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"351\">*351</page-number>that clause which prohibits a state from passing laws which impair the obligations of contracts, and this he holds, would be true, whether the contract be made by direct legislative act, or by an agent of the state in pursuance of law. We hold that the obligation of a contract made by the state with one of its citizens cannot be impaired by legislative act any more than if the contract was made between two of the citizens of the state; that contracts made by the state with a citizen of the state come within the inhibition of the constitution of the United States upon the subject of a state\u2019s violating the obligations of contracts by legislative act. A state being sovereign in the eye of the law, is presumed to be the embodiment of all the wisdom, honor, justice and virtue of its citizens; and how could this great commonwealth lay claim to such a high standard of excellence, if she should break her contracts with impunity? If there be reason and justice in the rule that the obligations of contracts between citizens should not be impaired by legislative act, when the state is a party to the contract, is it not a stronger reason why the rule should be maintained and upheld ?</p>\n<p id=\"b349-5\">Contracts are the springs of trade, commerce and business ; they determine the confidence of man in the conduct of his fellow; the virtue of the citizen, as well as national life, can rest on no safer foundation than the faithful fulfillment of contracts. That contracts are to be maintained in a republican form of government, is a rule that is fundamental.</p>\n<p id=\"b349-6\">We find that the state, through its chief executive, has leased its convicts for twenty years, and is to receive $25,000 per annum. Whether the contract thus made was proper, or whether now one more remunerative to the state could be made, are considerations by which this court cannot afford to be influenced; it is the mission of the courts to enforce, and not to make, contracts. The state can change its penitentiary systemcan change its modes of punishm\u00e9nt, may reduce felonies to misdemeanors or make, pros'<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"352\">*352</page-number>pectively, misdemeanors felonies, but as long as the state continues its present system and modes of punishment, contracts made, in having the sam\u00e9 enforced, are binding on the state. If this were not so, with what claim of right or degree of propriety could the state insist that the lessees should perform their part of the contracts, as hereinbefore set forth ?</p>\n<p id=\"b350-5\"><bracketnum>3.</bracketnum> The legislature, in 1883, passed a joint resolution instructing the principal keeper of the penitentiary to turn over to the Marietta &amp; North Georgia Railroad Company two hundred and fifty able bodied convicts, to be worked for the benefit of the company, until the line of said road, together with certain branch roads, shall have been completed. And complainants, by their amended bill, allege that, in pursuance with the resolution, Nelms, as principal keeper of the penitentiary, unless enjoined, will deliver the convicts therein mentioned to the railroad company.</p>\n<p id=\"b350-6\">This resolution upon its face purports to be, and is, a new grant by the state to the railroad company. It was passed at a time when, by contract between the governor of the state and the penitentiary companies, the labor of all the convicts, for twenty years, had been leased for the sum of twenty-five thousand dollars per annum. This resolution, if carried into effect, will withdraw from the penitentiary companies the labor of two hundred and fifty convicts, which they would be entitled to under their contracts made with the state; and there is no offer or tender of compensation by the state.</p>\n<p id=\"b350-7\">This court holds that the resolution is unconstitutional and void, as it violates the obligations of contracts entered into by the state in leasing its convicts. <em>We </em>fully appreciate the rule th it the courts should not hold an act of the legislature unconstitutional, unless its unconstitutionality is clear and manifest, but in view of that provision of the constitution of the United States which prohibits a state from passing laws which impair the obligations of contracts, as well as provisions of our own state constitution which <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"353\">*353</page-number>provides that private property shall not he taken for public use without just compensation, and that no grant of special privilege or immunity shall be revoked, except in such manner as to work no injustice; and again, that legislative acts in violation of the constitution of the state, or of the constitution of the United States, are void, and the j udiciary shall so declare them ; under these constitutional provisions, we feel constrained to hold said resolution null and void.</p>\n<p id=\"b351-5\">The resolution of 1883 does not reserve the police power of the state over the convicts, and while the state may contract away the labor of the convicts, it has no power to part with the police regulations over the convicts; for this reason the resolution is void, and should not be enforced. We deem it scarcely necessary to say further, that, by legislative act to take the property of A. and give it to B. is not only a violation of constitutional law, but a violation of the broadest principles of justice and right. It will be remembered that neither in the resolution, evidence, or argument of counsel has it been shown that it is necessary for the protection of the lives, comfort or safe keeping of the convicts, or for the protection of society, that said resolution should be enforced, but the same, without more, directs the principal keeper of the penitentiary to turn over two hundred and fifty convicts to the railroad, the labor of whom, by contract, had been disposed of to the penitentiary companies. We therefore hold that Nelms, as principal keeper of the penitentiary, be enjoined from delivering to the railroad company any convicts under said resolution, and that the railroad be enjoined from receiving any under said resolution.</p>\n<p id=\"b351-6\"><bracketnum>4.</bracketnum> Under the act of 1876, the Marietta <em>&amp; </em>North Georgia Railroad Company was entitled to the service of two hundred and fifty convicts for three years, and after said railroad company has had the service of said convicts for three years, the companies known as penitentiary companies are entitled to the same, unless the railroad company <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"354\">*354</page-number>can bring itself within the proviso of the act of 1876 by showing that, as an incorporated railroad company, by authority of the state, when the act of 1876 was passed, it was working the convicts of the state, and that it made application for a re-lease of convicts, as required by law, before the state leased the convicts to the penitentiary companies. This question of fact, we hold, should be submitted to, and passed upon by, a jury; that the same should be established by competent legal evidence, not the vague recollection or supposition of witnesses, but evidence showing that the officers of the railroad company applied for and received and worked the convicts of the state as an incorporated railroad company.</p>\n<p id=\"b352-5\">Should the railroad company establish the fact that it has a superior right to convicts to that of the penitentiary companies, then such a decree should' be framed as would authorize the railroad company to have such number of convicts, and for such length of time, .and for the purpose as set forth in the proviso to the act of 1876. But, on the contrary, should the railroad company fail to establish any right to convicts, other than the two hundred and fifty for three years in that event, we hold that a court of equity has the power to. decree that the convicts held now by the railroad company be delivered up, so that the same can be turned over to the penitentiary companies.</p>\n<p id=\"b352-6\">In looking through the evidence contained in the record in this case, we hold that the injunction granted in this case should be so modified as to enjoin the principal keener, Nelms, from delivering, and the railroad company from receiving, any more convicts, until the right of the railroad company to receive more shall have been established by law; and as this direction will require the principal keeper, Nelms, to turn over convicts which will hereafter be received by him, we direct that the Penitentiary Companies Nos. 2 and 3 file with the clerk of Fulton superior cour bond, with good security, conditioned to pay the railroad company any damages which it may sustain on ac<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"355\">*355</page-number>count of the service of convicts turned over to the penitentiary companies which should have been received by the railroad company.</p>\n<p id=\"b353-5\">We find that this is the fifth (fourth ?) time this subject-matter of litigation, first in one form and then in another, has been before this court for consideration. It is the desire of this court, and doubtless is of all parties to the case, that the rights of complainants and defendants should be finally adjudicated and settled. We therefore direct that complainants, on the trial of the case, have leave to so amend their bill as to have any claim for damages which they have already sustained, or which they may hereafter sustain, on account of the loss of service of convicts received by the railroad company to which it was not entitled, submitted to the court and jury, and the same adjudicated, on the trial of this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b353-6\"><bracketnum>5.</bracketnum> Under the contracts between the state and the penitentiary lessees, the lessees have a vested right to the labor of the convicts so leased, and the legislature has no power, under the constitution and laws of this state, and of the United States, to deprive the lessees of this right to the labor of the convicts thus leased.</p>\n<p id=\"b353-7\">In a bill brought by complainants against defendants in Cobb superior court, and which case was brought to this court for review, this court then held tnat it was competent for the state to relieve itself of the burden incident to the feeding, clothing, guarding and other expenses of the convicts, by an arrangement with any person to take charge of them and to confine them during their terms of sentences against them. See 65 Ga., page 504. The decision, as then: rendered, in effect, decided the question that the lessees had a vested right in the labor of the convicts, the state reserving the police power over the convicts. If the lessees have a vested right in the labor of the convicts, then that right cannot be taken away without tendering just compensation. We hold that the labor of the convicts, as contracted for, was not a mere expectancy, but was such a property right as to support a valid contract.</p>\n<p id=\"b354-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"356\">*356</page-number><bracketnum>6.</bracketnum> The police power of the state over the convicts leased to the penitentiary companies is reserved and secured by the contracts of lease to the state, so that the state has entire control of the moral and physical condition of the convicts, and can make all needful and necessary regulations as regards the safe keeping, feeding, clothing and medical treatment of the convicts.</p>\n<p id=\"b354-5\">The state, in the exercise of its sovereign rights for the protection of society in the enforcement of the judgments and sentences of the courts, as well as for the humane treatment of its convicts, should reserve to itself the police power over its convicts. This right was reserved by the acts of 1874 and 1876, and the same was made a condition in the lease contracts, as therein stated.</p>\n<p id=\"b354-6\"><bracketnum>7.</bracketnum> Under the act of 1876, persons leasing convicts are called corporations in the manner and for the purpose as specified in the act.</p>\n<p id=\"b354-7\">Defendants insist that complainants are not corporations. We hold that the state has the right to create an agency .of one or many persons, to aid the state in the enforcement of the criminal laws of the state, by having the convicts of the state guarded and kept at labor in accordance with the judgments of the courts, by which the convicts are required to be imprisoned and worked. The fact, that such an association of persons is loosely called corporations, does not render invalid contracts made by the state with such persons ; and the state having in this manner, and for the benefit of the state, contracted with such persons, calling or denominating them corporations, would not authorize the state to take advantage of that fact; and the railroad company claiming rights subordinate to the rights of the state, can take no advantage of the same.</p>\n<p id=\"b354-8\">Judgment reversed.</p>\n<p id=\"b354-9\">Cited for plaintiffs in error: Lease contracts, 65 Ga., 68.
