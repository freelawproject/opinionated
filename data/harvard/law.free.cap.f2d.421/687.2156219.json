Judge Tyler had exercised great care in taking the plea; Falu admitted that there was a factual basis for this and specifically declared that he was not sick. Four weeks, during which he received no narcotic or addicting drugs, elapsed between plea and sentence, before Judge Cooper, at which Falu declined to exercise his right of allocution. On both occasions he was represented by highly experienced and capable counsel.</p>\n<p id=\"b773-19\">Affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
