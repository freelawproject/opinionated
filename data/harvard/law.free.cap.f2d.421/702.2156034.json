Celebrezze, 367 F.2d 382 (4 Cir., 1966). The District Court\u2019s denial of Fred H. Carter\u2019s suit was vacated and remanded for reconsideration because of subsequent amendments to Sections 216 (i) and 223 of the Social Security Act. 42 U.S.C.A. \u00a7\u00a7 416(i) (1) (A) and 423(c) (2) (A) (Supp.1965). On its return to him the District Judge adjudicated the cause under these changes in the law. He again sustained the Secretary\u2019s refusal of benefits to Carter as having substantial support in the evidence. Carter v. Finch, 308 F.Supp. 954 (SDW.Va.1969).</p>\n<p id=\"b788-15\">On reexamination of the record we cannot say the District Judge was in error, and on his opinion we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"arc-dedup-1\">Affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
