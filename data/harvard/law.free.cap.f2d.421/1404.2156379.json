The District Judge did not grant petitioner a hearing but did have before him the record .of the state trial proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b1491-10\">At his state trial, petitioner was represented by employed counsel and now says that his counsel, who was eighty-three years old, was incompetent. His conviction was affirmed by the Ohio Court of Appeals and his application for appeal to the Ohio Supreme Court was denied.</p>\n<p id=\"b1491-11\">In addition to his claim of incompetency of counsel, petitioner alleges in his petition in District Court that pretrial publicity prevented a fair trial; that some of the witnesses used against him were state prisoners who were entertained by police while in attendance at the trial; and that the state trial judge prejudiced the jury against him by interposing his own objections and by interrupting counsel on many occasions.</p>\n<p id=\"b1491-12\">Based upon our examination of the record, we are of opinion that petitioner\u2019s claims are without merit and that he has not been deprived of any constitutional right,</p>\n<p id=\"anj-dedup-0\">The judgment is affirmed,</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
