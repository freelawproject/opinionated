The interference was declared between Bollmann\u2019s application serial No. 271,795, filed April 9, 1963, for \u201cHeavy Diesel Locomotive,\u201d and Kademann\u2019s application serial No. 267,114, filed March 22, 1963, for \u201cLocomotive.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1459-13\">Bollmann became senior party through the granting by the primary examiner of his motion to shift the burden of proof, based upon his earlier-filed Swiss application. Kademann\u2019s sole contention, both here and below, is that Bollmann has no right to make the count. The examiner found, and the board held, that Bollmann could make the count. We agree, and we affirm the board\u2019s decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b1459-14\">The count is as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1459-15\">1. A locomotive comprising trucks and a bridge girder connecting said trucks and having an engine mounted thereon, a power take-off on each end of the engine, a first pair of drive shafts each connecting one of the power take-offs with a <em>transmission carried by the locomotive, </em>and a second pair of drive shafts each connecting one transmission with a distributor gear on a truck whereby power from the engine is transmitted to the trucks to drive said locomotive, the second pair of drive shafts being connected to sides of the transmissions which face in the same direction. (Emphasis ours.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1459-16\">The issue with respect to Bollmann\u2019s right to make the count concerns the emphasized limitation that each transmission be carried by the locomotive. Boll-mann\u2019s specification and drawing show the transmissions mounted on the trucks. Kademann\u2019s disclosure and drawing show them mounted on the bridge girder connecting the trucks.</p>\n<p id=\"b1459-17\">Kademann contends that the meaning of \u201ccarried by the locomotive\u201d is ambiguous and hence should be construed to mean \u201ccarried by the locomotive frame,\u201d as stated in Kademann\u2019s disclosure, since the count originated in Kademann\u2019s application. He cites this court\u2019s decision in McCutchen v. Oliver, 367 F.2d 609, 54 CCPA 756 (1966), in support of this position. Kademann also contends that Bollmann disclaimed the subject matter of the count. He bases this contention on Bollmann\u2019s remarks, made during the course of prosecution, that the limitation in certain of Bollmann\u2019s claims that \u201ca separate hydraulic drive unit is supported in each of the two recited trucks\u201d was \u201cof capital importance.\u201d Kademann also bases his contention of disclaimer on the fact that, until the interference was declared, Bollmann had not asserted any claim as broad as the count here in issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b1460-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1374\">*1374</page-number>Kademann's contention of ambiguity of the count limitation in issue is unsound. Whatever \u201clocomotive\u201d may mean in other contexts, as used by both Kademann and Bollmann it clearly includes the trucks. The count first appeared as claim 1 in Kademann\u2019s application, and, as set forth above, it recites \u201cA locomotive comprising trucks and a bridge girder * * Further, claim 5 of Kademann\u2019s application reads: \u201c5. A <em>locomotive </em>according to claim 1 <em>in which the trucks </em>face in the same direction.\u201d Clearly Kademann considered the trucks to be part of the locomotive, and we see no such ambiguity as was present in <em>McCutchen, </em>supra.</p>\n<p id=\"b1460-4\"> Kademann\u2019s contention of disclaimer by Bollmann is also unsound. Bollmann\u2019s remarks, mentioned above, were with regard to the claims then present in his application. We know of no authority for holding that the failure to present broader claims prior to suggestion thereof by the examiner is any evidence of disclaimer.</p>\n<p id=\"b1460-5\">The decision of the board is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b1460-6\">Affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
