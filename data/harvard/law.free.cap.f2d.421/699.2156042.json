The latter he had not done until <em>after </em>the sale of the television set.</p>\n<p id=\"b785-23\">The Government offered, outside the hearing of the jury, to introduce evidence that the day the appellant failed to return the auto to its owner, a television set belonging to the car owner was also missing. A statement made by appellant to F.B.I. agents, after a full <em>Miranda </em>type warning, and a waiver signed by appellant, was offered in evidence (Ex. 6) which referred to the taking of the television set. Objection was made and sustained (R.T. 38), with the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"700\">*700</page-number>proviso that if the appellant \u201cpresents any evidence that would bear on his intent in taking the car, then this would be material and would be admissible.\u201d (R.T. 38, lines 20-22.)</p>\n<p id=\"b786-4\">Thereafter, Exhibit 6 was offered in evidence, and received after defense counsel stated, \u201cno objection.\u201d (R.T. 55.) The notes made by the witness Bag-ley from which Exhibit 6 was made were likewise offered in evidence (Ex. 7) and received when defense counsel stated \u201cno objection\u201d (R.T. 56). The witness Bagley was then asked about the defendant\u2019s taking of the automobile without the owner\u2019s permission, but no questions were asked by the Government concerning the television set. The prosecution rested, and the defendant testified as the sole witness in his own defense. He was asked by his own counsel:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b786-5\">\u201cQ. Did you intend to steal Mrs. Taylor\u2019s ear?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b786-7\">\u201cA. No.\u201d (R.T. 73.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b786-8\">On cross-examination defendant was asked whether he had told Mr. Bagley \u201che had taken her [Mrs. Taylor\u2019s] television set and sold it in Jacksonville, Florida,\u201d so that he could finance the trip West. No <em>objection </em>was interposed (R.T. 76).</p>\n<p id=\"b786-9\">On rebuttal, and without objection, Mrs. Taylor testified it was her television set, not the defendant\u2019s, and that it was gone the day after her car was taken. Mr. Bagley then testified on rebuttal, without objection, as to the defendant\u2019s statement to him about his taking and selling the television set to finance his trip West (R.T. 81).</p>\n<p id=\"b786-10\">The evidence thus admitted in rebuttal, without objection, was admitted only after the defendant had testified on his own behalf he had no intent to steal the automobile. Any objection to the testimony was waived when no objection was made, on any ground, by defense counsel.</p>\n<p id=\"b786-11\">We affirm the conviction.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
