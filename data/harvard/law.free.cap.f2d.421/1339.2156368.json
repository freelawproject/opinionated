The Court, although not ruling out the possibility that freedom of choice might still be an ingredient, ordered the filing of a new plan by the Board calling for immediate desegregation of every school for the 1969-70 school year. The record overwhelmingly demonstrates that freedom of choice as operating was not acceptable. The Board\u2019s appeal therefore must fail. But under the circumstances of this case neither this order nor any plan <footnotemark>2</footnotemark> heretofore filed or approved under it may stand in the face of supervening changes in the law. Thorpe v. Housing Authority of City of Durham, 1969, 393 U.S. 268, 80 S.Ct. 518, 21 L.Ed.2d 474; Bell v.

Jackson Municipal Separate School System (and consolidated cases en banc), 5 Cir., 419 F.2d 1211 (Dec. 1, 1969), mandate that \u201ceffective immediately * * * school districts * * * may no longer operate a dual school system based on race or color,\u201d and that they must \u201cbegin immediately to operate as unitary school systems within which no person is to be effectively excluded from any school because of race or color.\u201d As this Court said in Singleton, \u201cthe tenor of the decision in Alexander v. Holmes County is to shift the burden from the standpoint of time for converting to unitary school systems. The shift is from a status of litigation to one of unitary operation pending litigation.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1426-13\">The mandate in this cause shall issue forthwith.

Under the stringent requirements of Alexander v. Holmes County Board of Education, 1969, 396 U.S. 19, 90 S.Ct. 29, 24 L.Ed.2d 19, which this Court has carried out in United States v. Hinds County School Board, 5 Cir., 1969, 417 F.2d 852 this Court has judicially determined that the ordinary procedures for appellate review in school segregation cases have to be suitably adapted to assure that each system, whose case is before us, \u201cbegin immediately to operate as unitary school systems\u201d. F.R.A.P. Rule 2.
