This case has been held in abeyance awaiting decision by the Supreme Court of the <em>Minor </em>case cited below. That Court determined in Minor v. United States, 396 U.S. 87, 90 S.Ct. 284, 24 L.Ed.2d 283 (decided December 8, 1969), that the statutory obligation to sell only in pursuance of an official order form did not violate the Fifth Amendment privilege against self-incrimination.</p>\n<p id=\"b1477-15\">The petitioner\u2019s only other contention is that he was denied due process because there was a four month delay between the commission of the crime and the time of arrest. The contention is without merit. United States v. Grayson, 5 Cir. 1969, 416 F.2d 1073. Accordingly the denial of the petitioner\u2019s petition for habeas corpus is affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
