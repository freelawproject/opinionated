All such motions were denied.</p>\n<p id=\"b871-4\">In our judgment, the charges must be dismissed on authority of Haynes v. United States, 390 U.S. 85, 88 S.Ct. 722, 19 L.Ed.2d 923 (1968), Marchetti v. United States, 390 U.S. 39, 88 S.Ct. 697, 19 L.Ed.2d 889 (1968) and Benner v. United States, 417 F.2d 421 (9th Cir. 1969).</p>\n<p id=\"b871-5\"><em>Haynes </em>did not involve \u00a7 5814. It struck down a conviction -under \u00a7 5851 for possession of a firearm which had not been registered as required by \u00a7 5841. Since such registration would have compelled Haynes to provide self-incriminating information, it was held that the enforcement of \u00a7 5851 against the petitioner, given his timely assertion of the privilege, was not constitutionally permissible. 390 U.S. at 100, 88 S.Ct. 722.</p>\n<p id=\"b871-6\">The Government seeks to distinguish the present case upon the ground that \u00a7 5814 does not require the transferee of a firearm to incriminate himself since the section\u2019s requirements all antedate transfer and thus would occur <em>prior </em>to the commission of any state crime. All the would-be transferee need do to avoid incriminating himself, says the Government, is refrain from committing the crime.</p>\n<p id=\"b871-7\">A similar argument was considered and rejected in Marchetti v. United States, <em>supra. </em>Discussing an earlier case. Lewis v. United States, 348 U.S. 419, 75 S.Ct. 415, 99 L.Ed. 475 (1955), the Court stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b871-11\">\u201cThe Court held in <em>Lems </em>that the registration and occupational tax requirements do not infringe the constitutional privilege because they do not compel self-incrimination, but merely impose on the gambler the initial choice of whether he wishes at the cost of his constitutional privilege, to commence wagering activities. The Court reasoned that even if the required disclosures might prove incriminating, the gambler need not register or pay the occupational tax if only he elects to cease, or never to begin, gambling. There is, the Court said, \u2018no constitutional right to gamble.\u2019 348 U.S. at 423, 75 S.Ct. at 418.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b871-12\">We find this reasoning no longer persuasive. The question is not whether petitioner holds a \u2018right\u2019 to violate state laws, but whether, having done so, he may be compelled to give evidence against himself.\u201d 390 U.S. at 51, 88 S.Ct. at 704.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b871-13\">The Court rejected the reasoning of <em>Lems </em>that the privilege is inapplicable to prospective acts:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b871-14\">\u201cThe central standard for the privilege\u2019s application has been whether the claimant is confronted by substantial and \u2018real,\u2019 and not merely trifling or imaginary, hazards of incrimination. * * * We see no reason to suppose that the force of the constitutional prohibition is diminished merely because confession of a guilty purpose precedes the act which it is subsequently employed to evidence.\u201d 390 U.S. at 53-54, 88 S.Ct. at 705.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b871-15\">That the hazard of incrimination presented in the instant case was not trifling or imaginary seems apparent. Ad<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"786\">*786</page-number>mittedly, transfer under the Act is not prohibited; it is simply taxed. See Leary v. United States, 395 U.S. 6, 20, 22, 89 S.Ct. 1532, 23 L.Ed.2d 57 (1969).<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Nor is possession made illegal <em>per se. </em>But possession of a machine gun is, as we have noted, made criminal under the laws of the State of Washington.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b872-4\">While the Government is not required under the Act to make its records available to state law enforcement agencies, as was the case with the marihuana tax <em>(Leary) </em>and gambling occupation tax <em>(Marchetti), </em>there was, nevertheless, nothing in the Act as it read at the time of the offense to assure \u201cthe necessary confidentiality or immunity to overcome the privilege.\u201d See the opinion of Justice Brennan [concurring] in Grosso v. United States, 390 U.S. at 72-73, 88 S.Ct. at 716. Without such assurance it is difficult to believe that the Government\u2019s laudable concern with the \u201cgangster-type element\u201d <footnotemark>6</footnotemark> would not result in Federal co-operation with state agencies. In fact, the record indicates that it was in part the high level of co-operation between state and Federal officials that resulted in this conviction.</p>\n<p id=\"b872-12\">Under similar circumstances this court recently held that the requirement of a prospective declaration of intent to violate state laws respecting firearms is subject to the Fifth Amendment privilege. Benner v. United States, <em>supra. </em>Benner was convicted under 26 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 5851 and 5821 (declaration of intent to manufacture a firearm). In Oregon it was illegal for a convicted felon to be in possession of a concealable weapon.</p>\n<p id=\"b873-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"787\">*787</page-number>This court held that if Benner had been a convicted felon at the time of his manufacture of the firearm, that conviction was to be set aside as a violation of his Fifth Amendment rights.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> 417 F.2d at 425-426.</p>\n<p id=\"b873-4\">Applying the <em>Benner </em>rationale, we conclude that the effect of the \u00a7 5814 declaration requirements read in light of Washington law is to require the self-incrimination prohibited under the Fifth Amendment. Accord: United States v. Miller, 406 F.2d 1100, 1106 (4th Cir. 1969).</p>\n<p id=\"b873-5\">Accordingly, the judgment is reversed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b870-12\">. \u201cIt shall be unlawful for any person to receive or possess any firearm which has at any time been transferred in violation of section [s] * * * 5814.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b870-14\">. <em>\u201c(a) General requirements. </em>\u2014 It shall be unlawful for any person to transfer a firearm except in pursuance of a written order from the person seeking to obtain such article, on an application form issued in blank in duplicate for that purpose by the Secretary or his delegate.

In Minor v. United States, 396 U.S. 87, 90 S.Ct. 284, 24 L.Ed.2d 283 (1969), the Supreme Court, dealing with sellers of marihuana, explicitly distinguishes the earlier line of cases concerning buyers or transferees:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b872-7\">\u201cThe vice of the statute in that case [Leary] \u2014 as in Marchetti v. United States, 390 U.S. 39, 88 S.Ct. 697, 19 L.Ed.2d 889, Grosso v. United States, 390 U.S. 62, 88 S.Ct. 709, 19 L.Ed.2d 906 and Haynes v. United States, 390 U.S. 85, 88 S.Ct. 722, 19 L.Ed.2d 923-stemmed from the dilemma which confronted the buyer. The statute purported to make all purchases of marihuana legal from the buyer\u2019s viewpoint at his option; all he had to do to avoid the federal penalty was to secure the form and pay the tax. But to exercise that option and avoid the federal penalty, he was forced to incriminate himself under other laws.\u201d 396 U.S. at 92, 90 S.Ct. at 286-287.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b872-8\">And <em>Minor </em>also approved the prospective self-incrimination language used in <em>Mar-chetti, </em>390 U.S. at 51-52, 88 S.Ct. at 704, 705, Footnote 4.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b872-9\">. In this respect, Varitimos v. United States, 404 F.2d 1030 (1st Cir. 1968), cert. denied, 395 U.S. 976, 89 S.Ct. 2126, 23 L.Ed.2d 765 (1969), is distinguishable. That court distinguished <em>Marchetti, </em>noting that under Massachusetts law there was no prohibition \u201cagainst possession of a firearm lawfully acquired under the National Firearms Act,\u201d 404 F.2d at 1034.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b872-13\">. As the Court in <em>Ilaynes </em>noted :</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b872-14\">\u201cThe Act\u2019s requirements are applicable only to shotguns with barrels less than 18 inches long; rifles with barrels less than 16 inches long; other weapons, made from a rifle or shotgun, with an overall length of less than 26 inches; machine guns and other automatic firearms ; mufflers and silencers; and other firearms, except pistols and revolvers, \u2018if such weapon is capable of being concealed on the person * * *.\u2019 26 U.S.C. \u00a7 5848(1) ; Treas.Reg. \u00a7 179.20, 26 C.F.R. \u00a7 179.20. These limitations were apparently intended to guarantee that only weapons used principally by persons engaged in unlawful activities would be subjected to taxation.\u201d 390 U.S. at 87, 88 S.Ct. at 725.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b872-16\">In a footnote, the Court further comments :</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b872-17\">\u201c * * * It is pertinent to note that the Committee on Ways and Means of the House of Representatives, while reporting in 1959 on certain proposed amendments to the Act, stated that the \u2018primary purpose of [the Firearms Act] was to make it more difficult for the gangster element to obtain certain types of weapons. The type of weapon with which these provisions are concerned are the types it was thought would be used primarily by the gangster type element.\u2019 H.R.Rep.No.914, 86tli Cong., 1st Sess., 2.\u201d 390 U.S. at 87-88, 88 S.Ct. at 725.</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b873-23\">.
