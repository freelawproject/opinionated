Petitions for determination that an individual is a member of a Communist-action organization apparently cannot be brought until the organization in question has been determined by the Board to be a Communist-action organization. <em>See </em>\u00a7 13(a).</p>\n</footnote>\n<opinion data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b1229-20\">BAZELON, Chief Judge:</author>\n<p id=\"b1229-21\">These are petitions under \u00a7 14(a) of the Subversive Activities Control Act<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> to set aside orders of the Subversive Activities Control Board determining that each of the several petitioners is \u201ca member of the Communist Party of the United States of America, a Communist-action organization.\u201d The fact of membership is not at issue.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Instead, petitioners attack the Board\u2019s construction, and the constitutionality, of the Act. The Board erred, they argue, in taking official notice of its prior determination that the Communist Party is a Communist-action organization, and in not allowing petitioners to demand a rede-termination of the status of the Party in the proceedings against them. Additionally, they claim that the Act is constitutionally defective in allowing public disclosure of an individual\u2019s membership to be made without a finding that the individual concerned shares in any illegal purposes of the organization to which he belongs. We find this second argument persuasive.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1230-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1144\">*1144</page-number>I.</p>\n<p id=\"b1230-4\">Under the Act, when the Attorney-General has \u201creason to believe * * * that any individual is a member of an organization which has been determined by final order of the Board to be a Communist-action organization,\u201d he is to file a petition with the Board seeking a determination \u201cthat such individual is a member of such Communist-action organization.\u201d \u00a7 13(a). After hearing, the Board is to make a written report including its findings of fact. If it determines that the \u201cindividual is a member of a Communist-action organization,\u201d it shall issue and serve him with an order \u201cdetermining such individual to be a member of a Communist-action organization.\u201d \u00a7 13(g) (2) <footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Petitioners argue that the difference in language between the two subsections is critical: that is, they would read \u00a7 13(a) as instructing the Attorney General to institute proceedings before the Board whenever it comes to his attention that an individual belongs to any organization \u201cwhich <em>has been determined, by final order of the Board </em>to be a Communist-action organization.\u201d But \u00a7 13(g) (2) requires the Board to determine that the \u201cindividual <em>is </em>a member of a Communist-action organization,\u201d and this language is said to imply that, during the course of the hearings on a petition to determine an individual\u2019s membership, the Board must not only find that the individual is a member of a named organization, but must also redetermine that the organization is in fact a Communist-action organization.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Support for this construction is sought in \u00a7 13(b) and (i), which provide for redetermination, not more than once each calendar year, of the status of individuals and organizations against which Board orders are outstanding. Petitioners would read these subsections to allow an individual to reopen the status of an organization of which he is a member in a \u00a7 13(b) petition for redetermination. Therefore, they argue, \u00a7 13(g) should be read in the same way, and an individual should be allowed to litigate the status of an organization of which he is alleged to be a member during the course of the initial proceedings against him.</p>\n<p id=\"b1230-10\">On its face, \u00a7 13(b) does not compel the construction sought by petitioners. It provides, in pertinent part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1230-11\">Any organization as to which there is in effect a final order of the Board determining it to be a Communist-action or Communist-front organization, and <em>any individual as to whom there is in effect a final order of the Board </em>determining such individual to be a member of a Communist-action organization <em>may, not more often than once in each calendar year, file </em>with the Board and serve upon the Attorney General <em>a petition for a determination that such organization no longer is a Communist-action or Communist-front organization, or that such individual no longer is a member of a Communist-action organization, as the case may be.</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1230-12\">(emphasis added). This language is not entirely free from ambiguity, but it seems to imply that an individual, in a \u00a7 13(b) proceeding, may contest only the fact of his membership in a named organization against which an order is already outstanding.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> The limitation of petitions to one per calendar year is at least an indication that Congress intended that no particular issue should be <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1145\">*1145</page-number>relitigated more than once each year.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> Allowing individual members of an organization to reopen the complex question whether the organization to which they belong is a Communist-action organization would be to open the door to substantial delaying tactics without providing a corresponding benefit to&gt; anyone.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> Absent any support in the legislative history for petitioners\u2019 construction of \u00a7 13(b),<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> we cannot conclude that it was intended to allow individuals to contest the status of the organizations to which they belong.</p>\n<p id=\"b1231-5\"> Deprived of any support from \u00a7 13(b), petitioners\u2019 construction of \u00a7 13(g) must likewise fail. That construction would require us to read identical statutory language<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> in substantially different ways without any apparent support for such a different construction in the legislative history.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> It would raise a serious risk of ineon-sistent adjudications; that is, of opposite determinations of the same question (whether a given organization is a Communist-action organization) in proceedings against different individuals.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> That \u00a7 13(a) allows individual proceedings to be consolidated is no assurance that they would be. The Board did not err in holding that petitioners may not challenge the status of the Communist Party in the instant proceeding.</p>\n<p id=\"b1231-16\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b1231-17\">We must therefore face the constitutional question. Petitioners argue that \u00a7 13(g) (2) of the Act<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> is invalid because it provides for public disclosure of the fact of their membership in the Communist Party whether or not they intend to further any of the Party\u2019s illegal, as well as its legal and constitutionally protected aims.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> The Board\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1146\">*1146</page-number>primary response to this argument is that it is foreclosed by the Supreme Court\u2019s decision in Communist Party v. Subversive Activities Control Board, 367 U.S. 1, 81 S.Ct. 1357, 6 L.Ed.2d 625 (1961).<footnotemark>15</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1232-4\">The Supreme Court in the <em>Communist Party </em>case was presented with the question whether the First Amendment prohibited the requirement, set forth in \u00a7 7 of the original Act,<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> that organizations found to be dominated by a foreign power and intending the illegal overthrow of existing government could be required to file registration statements including the names and addresses of their members.<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> Individual members of the Communist Party were not parties to the action, but the Court allowed the Party standing to</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1232-5\">assert those rights of its members, such as anonymity, which are allegedly infringed by the very act of <em>its filing a registration statement, </em>and which could not be otherwise asserted than by raising them here.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1232-6\">367 U.S. at 81, 81 S.Ct. at 1402.</p>\n<p id=\"b1232-7\">The Court examined the structure of the Act, and found that the registration and disclosure requirements of \u00a7 7 did not attach <em>\u201cto </em>the incident of speech, but to the incidents of foreign domination and of operation to advance the objectives of the world Communist movement.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 90, 81 S.Ct. at 1407. Since regulation was premised on constitutionally unprotected conduct, the Court was required to balance \u201cthe value to the public of the ends which the regulation may achieve\u201d against \u201cthe impediments which particular governmental regulation causes to entire freedom of individual action.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 91, 81 S.Ct. at 1407; see United States v. O\u2019Brien, 391 U.S. 367, 377, 88 S.Ct. 1673, 20 L.Ed.2d 672 (1968). Although the Court did not consider the incidental infringement of First Amendment rights to be insubstantial, <em>see </em>367 U.S. at 102, 81 S.Ct. 1357, it concluded that the importance of the government\u2019s interest in disclosing the names of those who desired to further the illegal aims of Communist-action organizations justified the requirement that such organizations make public their membership lists. <em>Id. </em>at 102-103, 81 S.Ct. 1357.</p>\n<p id=\"b1232-14\">The present case, however, stands on an entirely different footing. Of course, in both cases the class of persons upon whom disclosure ultimately operates is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1147\">*1147</page-number>the same \u2014 all members of the organization, whether innocent or guilty. But \u00a7 7 of the original Act on its face dealt directly with organizations at least some of whose members shared in the illicit, constitutionally unprotected aims of the organization. <em>See id. </em>at 23-27, 42-55. Of course it would hardly have been practicable to require the organizations themselves to distinguish in their membership lists between innocent and guilty members. Therefore, the disclosure provisions were viewed as attaching to the incidents of foreign domination and illicit purpose, characteristics of the organization and of some but not all of its members. Innocent members were unavoidably caught up in a net designed to disclose the guilty. But \u00a7 13(g) (2) operates directly on individuals; consequently, the \u201coperative fact[s] upon which [the statute] depends,\u201d United States v. Robel, 389 U.S. 258, 263, 88 S.Ct. 419, 423, 19 L.Ed.2d 508 (1967), must be facts characteristic of the individual upon whom the statute operates. Under \u00a7 13(g) (2), disclosure attaches to mere membership in a Communist-action organization, whether or not the member whose affiliation is to be publicized has engaged in, or has any intent to further, the illicit ends of the organization. If mere membership, to which disclosure attaches, is constitutionally protected, the balancing test is inapplicaable. <em>Communist Party, supra, </em>367 U.S. at 90, 81 S.Ct. 1357.<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> Consequently, the question for decision is simply whether the statute infringes protected rights. De Jonge v. Oregon, 299 U.S. 353, 364-365, 57 S.Ct. 255, 81 L.Ed. 278 (1937).</p>\n<p id=\"b1233-9\">It seems clear to us that mere membership in the Communist Party is protected by the First Amendment. For it is \u201cnow beyond dispute,\u201d Bates v. City of Little Rock, 361 U.S. 516, 523, 80 S.Ct. 412, 4 L.Ed.2d 480 (1961), that \u201can individual\u2019s right of association * * * is protected by the provisions of the First Amendment.\u201d United States v. Robel, 389 U.S. 258, 263, 88 S.Ct. 419, 423 (1967). When a \u201cquasi-political part [y] or other group * * * may embrace both legal and illegal aims,\u201d Scales v. United States, 367 U.S. 203, 229, 81 S.Ct. 1469, 1486, 6 L.Ed.2d 782 (1961), affiliation with and membership in that group are constitutionally protected except for those who join \u201cwith the \u2018specific intent\u2019 to further illegal action.\u201d Elfbrandt v. Russell, 384 U.S. 11, 17, 86 S.Ct. 1238, 1241, 16 L.Ed.2d 321; <em>see </em>Noto v. United States, 367 U.S. 290, 299-300, 81 S.Ct. 1517, 6 L.Ed.2d 836 (1961). \u201cAssuming that some members of the Communist Party * * * had illegal aims and engaged in illegal activities, it cannot automatically be inferred that all members shared their evil purposes or participated in their illegal conduct.\u201d Schware v. Board of Bar Examiners, 353 U.S. 232, 246, 77 S.Ct. 752, 760, 1 L.Ed.2d 796, 64 A.L.R. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1148\">*1148</page-number>2d 288 (1957). For \u201cmen in adhering to a political party or other organization notoriously do not subscribe un-qualifiedly to all of its platforms or asserted principles.\u201d Schneiderman v. United States, 320 U.S. 118, 136, 63 S.Ct. 1333, 1342, 87 L.Ed. 1796 (1943).<footnotemark>19</footnotemark> Therefore the fact that some members of the Communist Party may be engaged in activity not protected by the First Amendment does not mean that the protected activity of other members may be infringed. If rights are abused, \u201clegislative intervention can find constitutional justification only by dealing with the abuse. The rights themselves must not be curtailed.\u201d De Jonge v. Oregon, <em>supra, </em>299 U.S. at 364-365, 57 S.Ct. at 260.</p>\n<p id=\"b1234-4\">Since the disclosure provisions of \u00a7 13(g) (2) attach solely to constitutionally protected rights, the only remaining question is whether they operate to discourage or penalize the exercise of those rights. We believe that they do. \u201cInviolability of privacy in group association may in many circumstances be indispensable to preservation of freedom of association, particularly where a group espouses dissident beliefs.\u201d NAACP v. Alabama ex rel. Patterson, 357 U.S. 449, 462, 78 S.Ct. 1163, 1172, 2 L.Ed.2d 1488 (1958). In the present situation, we cannot assume that disclosure of an individual\u2019s membership in the Communist Party will not operate as a substantial burden upon the exercise of his right of free association.<footnotemark>20</footnotemark> Therefore, the disclosure provisions of \u00a7 13(g) (2) must fall as contrary to the First Amendment. United States v. Robel, su<em>pra; </em>De Jonge v. Oregon, <em>supra.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1234-8\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b1234-9\">We would be led to the same conclusion under the balancing test as enunciated in the <em>Communist Party </em>case.<footnotemark>21</footnotemark> The Court in that case sustained the disclosure provisions of \u00a7 7 of the original Act, which like the present statute made no distinction between innocent and guilty members. But disclosure in that ease was sought from the Party, not from individuals,<footnotemark>22</footnotemark> and consequently there was available no practicable, less intrusive alternative to disclosure of the names of all members: to ask the Party itself to distinguish between those of its members who did and who did not share its illegal <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1149\">*1149</page-number>aims would be to ask the impossible. But proceedings under \u00a7 13(g) (2) are on a case-by-case basis, rendering it feasible to distinguish in each case between protected and unprotected membership. Scales v. United States, 367 U.S. 203, 81 S.Ct. 1469, 6 L.Ed.2d 782 (1961). Therefore, in weighing the public interest in disclosure, we must weigh a different quantity: since innocent members may easily be separated from guilty ones, the public interest in exposure of the guilty cannot be used to justify exposure of the innocent. See Keyishian v. Board of Regents, 385 U.S. 589, 606-607, 87 S.Ct. 675, 17 L.Ed.2d 629 (1967); Shelton v. Tucker, 364 U.S. 479, 488, 81 S.Ct. 247, 5 L.Ed.2d 231 (1960). Since the First Amendment precludes the government from claiming an interest in public disclosure of the associations of innocent members of Communist-action organizations,<footnotemark>23</footnotemark> Elfbrandt v. Russell, 384 U.S. 11, 17, 86 S.Ct. 1238, 16 L.Ed.2d 321 (1966), the governmental interest to be weighed in this case is nil.<footnotemark>24</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1235-6\">Since \u00a7 13(g) (2) of the Subversive Activities Control Act is contrary to the First Amendment, the orders issued in these cases cannot stand. The cases must be remanded to the Subversive Activities Control Board with instructions to dismiss the petitions.</p>\n<p id=\"b1235-7\">It is so ordered.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1229-14\">.

Robel, 389 U.S. 258, 268 n. 20, 88 S.Ct. 419, 426 (1967), where the Supreme Court explicitly rejected any attempt at \u201cbalancing\u201d in dealing with \u00a7 5 of the Act:</p>\n<p id=\"b1233-6\">It has been suggested that this case should be decided by \u201cbalancing\u201d the governmental interests expressed in \u00a7 5 (a) (1) (D) against the First Amendment rights asserted by the appellee. This we decline to do. We recognize that both interests are substantial, but we deem it inappropriate for this Court to label one as being more important or substantial than the other. * * *</p>\n<p id=\"b1233-7\">Petitioners suggest that this footnote implies that the approval of \u201cbalancing\u201d in <em>Communist Party, see </em>367 U.S. at 91, 81 S.Ct. 1357, has since been withdrawn. But the Court once again resorted to a balancing test in United States v. O\u2019Brien, 391 U.S. 367, 377, 88 S.Ct. 1673, 20 L.Ed.2d 672 (1968). It appears, then, that balancing may be appropriate when a statute is directed at constitutionally unprotected conduct, and infringes upon protected conduct only as an unavoidable side effect of an otherwise unexceptionable purpose. But where, as in <em>Hotel, </em>\u201cthe operative fact upon which [the statute] depends is the exercise of [a right] protected by the provisions of the First Amendment,\u201d 389 U.S. at 263, 88 S.Ct. at 423, the First Amendment precludes a resort to \u201cbalancing.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"19\">\n<p id=\"b1234-5\">. The Board relies upon Adler v. Board of Education, 342 U.S. 485, 494-495, 72 S.Ct. 380, 96 L.Ed. 517, 27 A.L.R.2d 472 (1952), for the contrary proposition. But the Supreme Court in Keyishian v. Board of Regents, 385 U.S. 589, 595, 87 S.Ct. 675, 679, 17 L.Ed.2d 629 (1967) pointed out that \u201cpertinent constitutional doctrines have since rejected the premises\u201d of that decision.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"20\">\n<p id=\"b1234-6\">. There is no direct evidence in the record in this case as to the degree of harassment that one named as a member of the Communist Party may suffer as a result. But although it is true that the Supreme Court has in some cases relied solely on record evidence to establish such a possibility, <em>e. g., </em>Shelton v. Tucker, 364 U.S. 479, 486 n. 7, 81 S.Ct. 247, 5 L.Ed.2d 231 (1960), Bates v. Little Rock, 361 U.S. 516, 520-522, 80 S.Ct. 412, 4 L.Ed.2d 430 (1960), NAACP v. Alabama, 357 U.S. 449, 462, 78 S.Ct. 1163 (1958), it was willing to state in <em>Communist Party </em>that \u201cthe public opprobrium and obloquy which may attach to an individual listed with the Attorney General as a member of a Communist-action organization is no less considerable than that * * * in <em>N.A.A.C.P. </em>and <em>Bates.\u201d </em>367 U.S. at 102, 81 S.Ct. at 1413. And in American Communications Ass\u2019n v. Douds, 339 U.S. 382, 402, 70 S.Ct. 674, 686, 94 L.Ed. 925 (1950), the Court noted:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1234-13\">Under some circumstances, indirect \u201cdiscouragements\u201d undoubtedly have the same coercive effect * * * as imprisonment * * *. A requirement that adherents of particular religious faiths or political parties wear identifying arm-bands, for example, is obviously of this nature.</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"21\">\n<p id=\"b1234-15\">. \u201cAgainst the impediments which particular governmental regulation causes to entire freedom of individual action, there must be weighed the value to the public of the ends which the regulation may achieve. 367 U.S. at 91, 81 S.Ct. at 1407.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"22\">\n<p id=\"b1234-16\">. This difference was used in <em>Communist Party </em>to distinguish Shelton v. Tucker, 364 U.S. 479, 81 S.Ct. 247, 5 L.Ed.2d 231 (1960). <em>See </em>367 U.S. at 92-93, 81 S.Ct. 1357.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"23\">\n<p id=\"b1235-8\">. AVe are not dealing here with a legislative investigation the primary purpose of which is to inform Congress with respect to matters properly within its concern. In such cases, some disclosure to the public may be justified as a necessary incident of disclosure to Congress. <em>Cf. </em>Watkins v. United States, 354 U.S. 178, 187, 77 S.Ct. 1173, 1 L.Ed.2d 1273 (1967) ; United States v. Rumely, 345 U.S. 41, 56-58, 73 S.Ct. 543, 97 L.Ed. 770 (1953) (concurring opinion).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"24\">\n<p id=\"b1235-9\">. In tlie <em>Communist Party </em>case, the Court sustained the disclosure provisions of \u00a7 7 of the original Act because</p>\n<p id=\"ast-dedup-0\">the mask of anonymity which [the] organization\u2019s members wear serves * * * [to enable] them to cover over a foreign-directed conspiracy, infiltrate into other groups, and enlist the support of persons who would not, if the truth were revealed, lend their support.</p>\n<p id=\"b1235-25\">367 U.S. at 102-103, 81 S.Ct. at 1414. In other words, the government\u2019s interest in disclosure was considered to be its interest in disclosure of the names of guilty members of the Party, <em>i. e., </em>those who shared the purposes found by the Court not to be constitutionally protected. But, as pointed out above, there was in that case no practicable way of distinguishing between innocent and guilty members, and a refusal to consider the public interest in disclosure of the guilty members would have meant that the interest could not have been protected at all. <em>See </em>367 U.S. at 88-89, 81 S.Ct. 1357.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
