The charters were extended beyond the original periods through the summer of 1963. However, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1184\">*1184</page-number>the charterer stopped regular payments in the fall of 1962 and the vessels were withdrawn in the late spring and early summer of 1963.</p>\n<p id=\"b1270-4\">On April 9, 1964, the shipowner commenced suit against the charterer for the earned but unpaid charter hire and for certain cash expenditures. The total amount claimed was $663,789.71, and a demand was made for pre-judgment interest on that figure. The shipowner did not claim damages based upon the unexpired terms of the charters.</p>\n<p id=\"b1270-5\">Although the charterers\u2019 answer was a general denial, in a pre-trial order dated June 1966, it admitted liability, disputing only the amount.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> In that same pre-trial order, the shipowner renewed its demand for interest.</p>\n<p id=\"b1270-6\">On April 16, 1969, at a pre-trial conference before Judge Edelstein, the charterer's counsel stated that he had authority to consent to a judgment. However, the shipowner had submitted amended figures for the unpaid hire<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> which reflected certain clerical adjustments in the initial computations and charterer\u2019s counsel requested a short adjournment so that his client, who was in Europe, could verify these amended figures. This request was granted.</p>\n<p id=\"b1270-7\">On June 3, 1969,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> the charterer\u2019s counsel informed the court that he was authorized to consent to judgment in the amount of $627,576.11.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Shipowner\u2019s counsel again raised the question of interest on the amount awarded. The court requested memoranda and held a further conference before reserving decision on this point. When the final judgment was rendered on July 2, 1969, interest was not awarded and no reasons were given for its denial.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> We agree with the shipowner that interest should have been awarded and therefore reverse and remand to the court below for the computation of interest.</p>\n<p id=\"b1270-17\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b1270-18\">The charterer argues that the figure consented to was the product of a negotiated settlement which included the question of interest. The record belies this contention. The liability was liquidated and the minor adjustments were merely clerical corrections. At no time did' the shipowner\u2019s counsel agree to relinquish the demand for interest.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> In fact, he vigorously renewed the demand even after the charterer\u2019s counsel indicated that he had authority to consent to the judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b1270-19\">The charterer also suggests that since the question of awarding interest was within the discretion of the trial judge, it should not be disturbed on ap<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1185\">*1185</page-number>peal. The general rule is that an admiralty court has discretion to award or deny pre-judgment interest. E. g., Lek-as &amp; Drivas Inc. v. Goulandris, 306 F.2d 426, 429 (2d Cir.1962); O\u2019Donnell Transportation Co. v. City of New York, 215 F.2d 92, 95 (2d Cir.1954). However, this discretion is not unlimited:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1271-5\">\u201c * * * allowance of interest is the general rule and * * * disallowance is supportable only in the face of \u2018exceptional circumstances.\u2019 See The Wright, 2 Cir., 1940, 109 F.2d 699, 702. But it is equally clear that the rationale underlying the award of interest is the desire to make whole the injured party, see The President Madison, 9 Cir., 1937, 91 F.2d 835, 846, and the presence or absence of \u2018exceptional circumstances\u2019 must always be determined in the light of that purpose.\u201d <em>Id.</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1271-6\">This general rule in favor of allowing interest is much stronger where, as in the instant case, the damages are liquidated and are based upon a breach of contract. Cf. Gardner v. The Calvert, 253 F.2d 395, 402 (3d Cir.), cert. denied sub nom. Sound Steamship Lines Inc. v. Gardner, 356 U.S. 960, 78 S.Ct. 997, 2 L.Ed.2d 1067 (1958) ;<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> 5 Corbin, Contracts \u00a7 1046 (1964); 3 Benedict, Admiralty \u00a7 419 p. 191 (Knauth ed. 1940). And interest must be awarded if the shipowner is to be made whole, since it was unjustifiably deprived of the use of the money.</p>\n<p id=\"b1271-11\">Thus unless there were \u201cexceptional circumstances\u201d<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> e.g., O\u2019Donnell Transportation Co. v. City of New York, <em>supra, </em>215 F.2d at 95, interest should have been awarded. In the record below and the arguments before this court we find no suggestion of any such \u201cexceptional circumstances.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1271-12\">Accordingly, the decision as to interest is reversed and the case remand\u00e9d for the award of interest.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1270-8\">. Charterer\u2019s contentions were summarized as follows in the pre-trial order:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1270-9\">\u201c[Respondent does not agree to the extent of the damages as contended herein by libillant (sic). Libillant does not show items which should be credited to the respondent in the sense of mitigating libillents damages.\u201d</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b1270-10\">. The amended hire figures provided for a total reduction of $36,213.60 from the figure originally pleaded.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b1270-11\">. On May 22, 1969 a conference was held at which time charterer\u2019s counsel informed the court that the figures had not been verified. At a conference held on June 2, 1969 charterer\u2019s counsel\u2019s associate advised the court that he was authorized to consent to the amended hire figures. However, he had no authority to consent to the cash expenditures originally pleaded, and Judge Edelstein requested that charterer\u2019s counsel appear the next day.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b1270-20\">. This figure represents the original amount pleaded minus the amended hire figures.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b1270-21\">. Judge Edelstein merely crossed out the provisions relating to interest in the proposed judgment submitted by the shipowner and signed the document.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b1270-22\">. This fact was recognized by the charterer\u2019s counsel, Mr. Poles, at the hearing of June 17, 1969 when he said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1270-23\">\u201cMr. Poles: Mr. Rohrer, [the shipowner\u2019s counsel] I think I can cut your argument short here. At no time did I mention that you had waived any interest nor in my memorandum is there any information that you did waive interest. If you reached that conclusion, that was merely a conclusion of your own \u2014 maybe by an overabundance of caution or whatever it is. I say here and now that I at no time indicated that you waived any interest.</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b1271-7\">. The charterer suggests that the following language from <em>The Calvert </em>supports its position:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1271-8\">\u201cThe libelant urges, however, that the principle above referred to [that the trial court has discretion to award or deny interest] applies only to collision cases and not to cases in which damages are awarded for breach of contract. We do not agree. Where damages are unliquidated and can only be established by litigation the application of the rule is a matter of discretion for the court dependent upon the circumstances of the case.\u201d 253 F.2d at 402.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1271-9\">This language is entirely consistent with our decision since the damages in this case were liquidated and litigation was not required for their establishment.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b1271-17\">. Such \u201cexceptional circumstances\u201d include delaying tactics on the part of the plaintiff, the continued use of damaged vessels, the absence of repairs, O\u2019Donnell Transportation Co. v. City of New York, <em>supra </em>at 95; appealing from an order which was plainly unappealable, Petition of Wills Lines Inc., 251 F.2d 306, 310 (2d Cir.), cert. denied sub nom. Wills Lines, Inc. v. Tankport Terminals, Inc., 356 U.S. 939, 78 S.Ct. 782, 2 L.Ed.2d 814 (1958); and the fact that damages were caused by joint fault, The Wright, 109 F.2d 699, 702 (2d Cir. 1940).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b1271-13\">WATERMAN, Circuit Judge</author>\n<p id=\"An1yK\">(dissenting).</p>\n<p id=\"b1271-14\">I, too, would remand to the district court. Unlike my brothers, however, who mandate that the court below award pre-judgment interest and add the computed amount to the district court judgment order, I would remand for an enlargement of the record.</p>\n<p id=\"b1271-15\">From the record before us certain un-controvertible facts appear. At pre-trial conferences in the presence of the judge the defendant made an offer to dispose of the case for a sum certain which the plaintiff accepted. It was agreed that this sum would be incorporated into a consent judgment order. The plaintiff claimed there should also be an award of pre-judgment interest in addition to the offered and accepted sum. The defendant claimed the offered and accepted sum had the effect of an accord and that no prejudgment interest should be awarded. The experienced trial judge asked for and received memoranda on the point, and thereafter in colloquy <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1186\">*1186</page-number>with counsel explained defendant\u2019s position as he understood it:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1272-4\">The Court: I think what [defense counsel] is trying to say is that any matter which is disposed of amicably, as it were, a disposition in lieu of trial \u2014 it is really not important or significant what characterization you place upon that kind of a disposition \u2014generally speaking, by and large, unless the agreement and disposition includes interest and/or costs, as a rule both of those items are eliminated.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1272-5\">He then followed this summary with his own observation:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1272-6\">\u201cThat is generally the way these matters are handled.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1272-7\">Soon after this colloquy plaintiff submitted a judgment order which set forth in separate paragraphs the agreed-upon breakdown of consented-to sums with respect to each of the three vessels. The preamble to these paragraphs contained the language \u201c* * * and the Court further having considered the arguments of counsel with respect to the awarding of interest * * Each of the three paragraphs ended with the language \u201c* * * with interest thereon at the rate of - per cent per an-num from_to the date of this Judgment amounting to the sum of $_; * * The judge struck from the submitted judgment order this latter language at each of the three places it occurred, and, two weeks after he had stated \u201cThat is generally the way these matters are handled,\u201d he filed the order so submitted to him and so modified by him.</p>\n<p id=\"b1272-12\">On the basis of these uncontrovertible facts it would seem that when it prepared its judgment order plaintiff had decided that, upon the facts and circumstances of this case, plaintiff would leave to the discretion of the admiralty judge not only the rate of interest to be ordered but the date or dates from which it was to be computed; and, indeed, whether any pre-judgment interest at all was to be allowed.</p>\n<p id=\"b1272-13\">Even when the exercise of judicial discretion in the content of judgment orders filed in causes arising within the court\u2019s admiralty jurisdiction is properly circumscribed by the rules of the substantive law, if libelant and respondent should by their conduct demonstrate beyond a peradventure of doubt a willingness to accept discretionary judicial action, I would think it arbitrary of an appellate court to override that willingness upon less than a full record.</p>\n<p id=\"b1272-14\">Therefore, I would remand to the court below with instructions to enlarge this record by filing a written opinion in which the rationale of the denial of pre-judgment interest will be set forth.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
