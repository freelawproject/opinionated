We affirm.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b236-22\">Appellant, acting without counsel, was convicted on his plea of guilty of violating 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2113(a), entering a bank with intent to commit a felony. He was sentenced in the United States District Court for the Northern District of Mississippi, Delta Division, to fifteen years imprisonment.</p>\n<p id=\"b236-23\">Shortly after his conviction, appellant filed a motion to vacate sentence under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255 in the trial court, contending that he was not guilty of the crime charged but was guilty only of larceny under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2113(b), which carries a maximum sentence of 10 years. The district court denied relief. This Court affirmed on appeal. Smith v. United States, 5th Cir. 1969, 273 F.2d 337.</p>\n<p id=\"b236-24\">Appellant has filed his petition for habeas corpus in the Northern District of Georgia, Atlanta Division, the district wherein he is presently incarcerated. In this petition he challenges the validity of his plea of guilty, an issue not previously presented to the sentencing court. Without looking into the merits of appellant\u2019s allegations, the court below denied the petition stating that the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"151\">*151</page-number>exclusive remedy for appellant is a motion to vacate sentence filed in the sentencing court pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255.</p>\n<p id=\"b237-4\">\u201cHabeas corpus may not be resorted to unless it is made to appear that a motion under \u00a7 2255 \u2018is inadequate or ineffective to test the legality of his detention,\u2019 28 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 2255.\u201d Birchfield v.

Appellant has failed to show that a \u00a7 2255 motion would be ineffective or inadequate in this case. The judgment below is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b237-5\">Affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b236-15\">.
