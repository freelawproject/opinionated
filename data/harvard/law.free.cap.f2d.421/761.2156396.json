Before trial, the defendants stipulated that the 1066 cases of Nestle\u2019s chocolate mentioned in the indictment had indeed been the subject of an interstate theft, thus essentially reducing the issue at trial to the nature of their knowledge of the chocolate\u2019s origin.</p>\n<p id=\"b847-25\">The Government\u2019s first witness, a retail merchant from whom the goods were finally recovered, testified that he had purchased the chocolate from the appellant in the middle of March 1968, after being approached by him in late February of the same year. He stated that the appellant explained his willingness to sell the chocolate at less than regular wholesale price by remarking that it had come from a bankrupt vending machine company in New York. The chocolate was delivered by the appellant in a truck he borrowed from the witness for that purpose. The Government presented several other merchants who testified to contacts with the appellant or persons who, further testimony established, were acting at the appellant\u2019s behest during which an offer was made to sell choeo-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"762\">*762</page-number>late at below wholesale price in exchange for cash or a certified check.</p>\n<p id=\"b848-4\">Two agents of the Federal Bureau of Investigation also testified. One stated that he interviewed the appellant and was told by him that, while registered at a motel in New York, he had been approached by a man offering to sell some Nestle\u2019s chocolate. This individual, the appellant explained, took the appellant to a warehouse in Brooklyn where he was allowed to examine the goods. The sale was allegedly consummated on a second trip to New York. Testimony was then introduced to show that appellant\u2019s name did not appear on the motel registers where he claimed to have stayed on the dates involved and that there was no warehouse at the Brooklyn location.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> A second agent testified to a meeting he had with the appellant and defendant Cerminara during which he pretended to be a prospective buyer for the chocolate. He related a conversation he had had with Cerminara shortly after the appellant left them in which Cerminara said, \u201cI am a fool for taking part in the handling of this hot chocolate.\u201d <footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b848-5\">At the conclusion of the Government\u2019s case, appellant\u2019s counsel stated to the court that he intended to put on no evidence. The defendant Cerminara then took the stand in his own behalf in an effort to explain his conversation with the second agent. He testified that he made his remarks after receiving a telephone call from a friend, who told him to avoid having anything to do with the chocolate since it was stolen, which conversation he repeated to the appellant out of hearing of the agent. Cerminara went on to relate that he had originally been approached by the appellant\u2019s uncle with a proposition to help the appellant sell the chocolate and that after he relayed to appellant the telephone message which he had received, the appellant denied that the goods were stolen but left Cerminara and the agent immediately and did not return, even though promising to do so.</p>\n<p id=\"b848-9\">After the Government had cross-examined Cerminara, the following colloquy took place:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b848-10\">\u201c[Government counsel]: No further questions.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b848-11\">\u201cThe Court: Anything more ?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b848-12\">\u201c[Appellant\u2019s counsel]: I have just one question, your Honor.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b848-13\">\u201cThe Court: How do you examine? When you examine him, you make him your witness. You weren\u2019t going to offer any testimony. He is not subject to cross-examination by you. If you wish to ask him questions on that basis, all right.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b848-15\">\u201c [Appellant\u2019s counsel]: That is all right, your Honor. I will forego the question.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b848-16\">On this appeal it is alleged that the failure of the trial judge to permit defense counsel to cross-examine a codefendant was prejudicial error. We agree and reverse for this reason.</p>\n<p id=\"b848-17\">Neither the appellant nor the Government has been able to indicate with certainty what it was that prompted the above ruling by the trial court. The court may have been thinking of the practice in some courts to require counsel for a co-defendant to cross-examine <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"763\">*763</page-number>before the Government does. For whatever reason the ruling was made, however, it is clear that it interfered with one of appellant\u2019s most basic procedural rights \u2014 the right to cross-examine the witnesses against him. See United States v. Fontana, 231 F.2d 807 (3rd Cir. 1956); cf. United States ex rel. Gerch-man v. Maroney, 355 F.2d 302, 308 (3rd Cir. 1966). In Bruton v. United States, 391 U.S. 123, 88 S.Ct. 1620, 20 L.Ed.2d 476 (1968),<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> the Court held that since a defendant had a right to cross-examine a co-defendant, it was reversible error to admit evidence of a co-defendant\u2019s confession where that co-defendant did not take the stand and subject himself to such cross-examination. As the Supreme Court indicated in Brookhart v. Janis, 384 U.S. 1, 3, 86 S.Ct. 1245, 1246, 16 L.Ed.2d 314 (1966):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b849-5\">\u201cIn this Court respondent admits that:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"ATq\">\u201c\u2018[I]f there was here a denial of cross-examination without waiver, it would be constitutional error of the first magnitude and no amount of showing of want of prejudice would cure it.\u2019</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b849-6\">\u201cThis concession is properly made.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b849-7\">We cannot agree with the Government\u2019s contention that the last above-quoted remark by appellant\u2019s counsel constituted a waiver of the right to cross-examine or acquiescence in the ruling of the trial court. Rather, the record supports the conclusion that counsel for appellant decided to forego the question rather than make the co-defendant Cerminara his witness as the court would have required.</p>\n<p id=\"b849-8\">Because of the foregoing, it is not necessary for us to decide whether the failure of the trial judge to give a requested charge stating that the appellant had a constitutional right not to take the stand to testify, see Griffin v. California, 380 U.S. 609, 85 S.Ct. 1229, 14 L.Ed.2d 106 (1965), is such plain error, see F.R.Crim.P. 52(b), as to require reversal despite the failure of appellant\u2019s counsel to call it to the court\u2019s attention at the end of its charge, see F.R.Crim. P. 30.</p>\n<p id=\"b849-14\">The judgment and commitment of the District Court will be reversed and the case remanded for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b847-27\">. 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 659 (1964).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b848-6\">. Although there was other evidence of appellant\u2019s guilty knowledge, such as the failure of appellant to get a receipt for the amounts be paid for the chocolate, the storage of the goods in appellant\u2019s home garage, the refusal of the sellers acting for appellant to give his name until a sale had been consummated, etc., the evidence against appellant on this issue, independent of Cerminara\u2019s testimony, was not \u201coverwhelming.\u201d Cf. Harrington v. California, 395 U.S. 250, 89 S.Ct. 1726, 23 L.Ed.2d 284 (1969).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b848-18\">. Also, Cerminara told Zambrano when he first introduced the second agent to him at the beginning of this conversation, that \u201cMike [the agent] is O. K. I have determined this through good people.\u201d As pointed out below, appellant never had an opportunity, through cross-examination of Cerminara, to make clear to the jury his version of such statements, his denial of their accuracy, and/or his absence when the statements were made.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b849-9\">. In Roberts v. Russell, 392 U.S. 293, 294, 88 S.Ct. 1921, 1922, 20 L.Ed.2d 1100 (1968), the Court said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b849-11\">\u201cThe retroactivity of the holding in <em>Bruton </em>is therefore required; the error \u2018went to the basis of fair hearing and trial because the procedural apparatus never assured the [petitioner] a fair determination\u2019 of his guilt or innocence.\u201d</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
