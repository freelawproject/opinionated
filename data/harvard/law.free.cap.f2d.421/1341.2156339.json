We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b1427-26\">Appellant\u2019s first contention is that the evidence was insufficient to support his conviction. He relies upon Julian v. United States, 391 F.2d 279 (9th <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1342\">*1342</page-number>Cir. 1969). We think, however, that <em>Julian </em>is distinguishable on its facts, and that the evidence of appellant\u2019s possession of the stolen car was sufficient.</p>\n<p id=\"b1428-4\">Appellant\u2019s second contention is that the evidence that the automobile was stolen should have been suppressed as the \u201cfruit\u201d of post-arrest questioning conducted by the police without giving appellant the requisite <em>Miranda </em>warnings. <em>See </em>Miranda v. Arizona, 384 U.S. 436, 478-479, 86 S.Ct. 1602, 16 L.Ed.2d 694, 10 A.L.R.3d 974 (1966). Appellant admits in his reply brief, however, that other evidence which was not suppressed at trial and which appellant does not contend was unlawfully obtained \u201cprompted * * * (the police officer) to call Budget Rent-A-Car and learn that the car was stolen.\u201d Thus \u201cthe exclusionary rule has no application because the Government learned of the evidence \u2018from an independent source,\u2019 Silverthorne Lumber Co. v. United States, 251 U.S. 385, 392, 40 S.Ct. 182, 183, 64 L.Ed. 319.\u201d Wong Sun v. United States, 371 U.S. 471, 487, 83 S.Ct. 407, 417, 9 L.Ed.2d 441 (1963).</p>\n<p id=\"b1428-5\">Affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"concurrence\">\n<author id=\"b1428-6\">CHAMBERS, Circuit Judge</author>\n<p id=\"A_B\">(concurring).</p>\n<p id=\"b1428-7\">I would go further than the majority.</p>\n<p id=\"b1428-8\">Appellant argues \u201cfruit of poisoned tree\u201d because of an absence of a Miranda warning midway in the investigation.</p>\n<p id=\"b1428-9\">At the very beginning, the circumstances of the investigation showed something very \u201cfishy\u201d about appellant\u2019s occupancy of the stolen automobile.</p>\n<p id=\"b1428-10\">I take judicial notice of the existence of the National Automobile Theft Bureau, with offices in principal cities of the United States and Mexico, with 24 hour a day service. The F.B.I., police and sheriffs constantly query them. To assume that the Las Vegas police would be so incompetent that they would not query the Bureau is to flout reality. While I agree with the majority that appellant shakes himself out of the poisoned tree, yet we ought to say the point is no.t valid in any way in a situation such as we have here.</p>\n<p id=\"b1428-12\">If, in the course of the investigation, something rolls out (without a precedent Miranda warning) that enables the officers to take a short cut to something they would have doubtless found out anyway, we should not worry about the poisoned tree and its fruit.</p>\n<p id=\"b1428-13\">Miranda was written to protect one\u2019s right to silence when one\u2019s talking really hurts. Its purpose was not ritualistic.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
