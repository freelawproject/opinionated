We affirm the action of the District Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b711-26\">On March 3, 1965, the Appellate Division, following an investigation into appellants\u2019 negligence law practice, disbarred Landon Zuckerman and suspend<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"626\">*626</page-number>ed Sam Haber from the practice of law for five years. (In the Matter of Zuckerman and Haber, 23 A.D.2d 825, 259 N.Y.S.2d 963 (2d Dep\u2019t), motions for leave to appeal denied, 16 N.Y.2d 483 (1965).) Thereafter, on February 13, 1967, the United States Supreme Court granted appellants\u2019 petition for a writ of certiorari, vacated the Appellate Division\u2019s order and remanded the case for \u201creconsideration in light of Spevack v. Klein, 385 U.S. 511, 87 S.Ct. 625, [17 L.Ed.2d 574] (1967).\u201d Zuckerman, et al. v. Greason, 386 U.S. 15, 87 S.Ct. 847, 17 L.Ed.2d 696 (1967). Without further notice to appellants, the Appellate Division, on March 20, 1967, dismissed one of the charges against Zuckerman on the authority of Spevack v. Klein, <em>supra, </em>and reduced his penalty to a five-year suspension. All other charges were sustained. (27 A.D.2d 848, 280 N.Y.S.2d 904 (2d Dep\u2019t 1967).) The New York Court of Appeals reversed, on the ground that appellants were denied due process in not being afforded an opportunity to be heard following the Supreme Court remand. (19 N.Y.2d 977, 978, 281 N.Y.S.2d 523, 228 N.E.2d 693 (1967).) On July 10, 1967, the Appellate Division, after affording appellants a hearing, suspended Haber and Zuckerman from the practice of law for five years. (28 A.D.2d 907, 282 N.Y.S.2d 951 (2d Dep\u2019t 1967).) This order was affirmed by the New York Court of Appeals (20 N.Y.2d 430, 285 N.Y.S.2d 1, 231 N.E.2d 718 (1967)) and certiorari was denied by the United States Supreme Court (Zuckerman, et al. v. Greason, 390 U.S. 925, 88 S.Ct. 856, 19 L.Ed.2d 985 (1968)).</p>\n<p id=\"b712-8\">The appellants then brought this action (which they denominate a class action) asking for a judgment annulling the action taken against them by the defendant and declaring appellants \u201cduly licensed to practice law in the State of New York.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b712-9\">For a number of reasons there are grave doubts as to the jurisdiction of this court to proceed in such a ease under \u00a7 1983. See, e. g., Theard v. United States, 354 U.S. 278, 77 S.Ct. 1274, 1 L.Ed.2d 1342 (1957). However it is unnecessary for us to go into these problems since it is quite clear that the Appellate Division is not a \u201cperson\u201d within the meaning of 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983. In Monroe v. Pape, 365 U.S. 167 (1961), at 187-192, 81 S.Ct. 473, 5 L.Ed.2d 492, it was held that a municipal corporation was not a \u201cperson\u201d within the intended meaning of that word in section 1983. Since a municipal corporation is but a political subdivision of a state, it has been held that the state itself is also not subject to suit under section 1983. Williford v. California, 352 F.2d 474, 476 (9th Cir. 1965).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> It follows that the Appellate Division, as a part of the judicial arm of the State of New York, must also not be a \u201cperson\u201d within the purview of the section of the Civil Rights Act.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b712-10\">Affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b712-4\">. In Clark v. Washington, 366 F.2d 678, 681 (9th Cir. 1966) it was held that a bar association is an agency of the state and therefore not a \u201cperson\u201d within the meaning of Section 1983.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b712-6\">. In addition it has been held that 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983 does not affect the established common law rule that a judge is immune from a suit arising out of the exercise of his judicial powers. See Pierson v. Ray, 386 U.S. 547, 554, 87 S.Ct. 1213, 18 L.Ed.2d 288 (1967) ; Jobson v. Henne, 355 F.2d 129, 133 (2d Cir. 1966) ; Serrano v. California, 361 F.2d 474 (9th Cir. 1966) (per curiam).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
