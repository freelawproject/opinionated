While the Appellant has no other motion pending before the Court, he alleges that he is preparing a motion for a writ of habeas corpus pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255.</p>\n<p id=\"b1387-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1301\">*1301</page-number>The Appellant has been convicted of bank robbery and violation of the Dyer Act and sentenced to two terms of five years, and one of fifteen years to run concurrently. At trial, Appellant was represented by personally retained counsel who, after the conviction, filed a motion for a new trial which was duly heard and overruled. Appellant\u2019s counsel then perfected an appeal to this Court. After the appeal was perfected, Appellant then moved for appointment of Court appointed counsel, which was granted to him. This Court in a full opinion affirmed Appellant\u2019s conviction in United States v. Smith, 393 F.2d 687 (6th Cir. 1968). On that appeal, Appellant\u2019s court appointed lawyer filed a brief for Appellant which included twenty-three pages of trial transcript and a supplemental brief for Appellant which included ten additional pages of transcript. It is clear, therefore, from the records on file with this Court that Appellant\u2019s appointed counsel must have had access to a transcript of the prior proceedings against the Appellant. Upon oral argument of the instant case, counsel for the Appellant, conceded that in Appellant\u2019s prior action, court appointed counsel did have access to the Government\u2019s transcript of all the prior proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b1387-4\">Subsequent to this Court\u2019s affirmation of Appellant\u2019s conviction, the Appellant has filed three separate motions for a trial transcript in order to prepare for future litigation. The prior two motions have been denied because there was no matter pending before any court to provide a basis for issuing such a transcript at the Government\u2019s expense.</p>\n<p id=\"b1387-5\">In the instant action this Court must determine whether Appellant is entitled to a trial transcript at the Government\u2019s expense, solely for the purpose of preparing a motion pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255.</p>\n<p id=\"b1387-6\">In general, indigents are not accorded a right to a free transcript. The basis of this rule being to prevent the wasting of court time on frivolous appeals. It is assumed that, absent special circumstances, a man in custody can recall sufficiently the circumstances of a non-frivolous error to frame an appropriate motion to vacate sentence. Lucas v. United States, 423 F.2d 683 (6th Cir. 1970). Dorsey v. United States, 333 F.2d 1015 (6th Cir. 1964); Ketcherside v. United States, 317 F.2d 807 (6th Cir. 1963). <em>See, </em>Gardner v. California, 395 U.S. 925, 89 S.Ct. 1780, 23 L.Ed.2d 242 (1969) (concerning \u201cspecial circumstances\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b1387-8\">In the light of the United States Supreme Court\u2019s disposition of Wade v. Wilson, 396 U.S. 282, 90 S.Ct. 501, 24 L.Ed.2d 470 (decided January 13, 1970) and Title 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 753(f), we remand to the District Court for proceedings consistent therewith. <em>See </em>Lucas v. United States, 423 F.2d 683 (6th Cir. 1970). We do not reach the merits of what may be construed as collaterally alleged errors in Appellant\u2019s \u201cMotion for a copy of the Records\u201d in view of our disposition of this matter.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
