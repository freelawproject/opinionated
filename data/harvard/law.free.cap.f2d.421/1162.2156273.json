Subsequently Shea refused to apply for a duplicate card and then returned an unsolicited duplicate which the board sent him on its own initiative in June 1967. Finally, on July 19, 1967, the local board declared Shea delinquent pursuant to 32 C.F.R. \u00a7 1642.4 (1969) for \u201cfailure to retain a Registration Certificate and Notice of Classification as prescribed by Selective Service Regulations.\u201d At the same time, the board reclassified Shea from his III-A (fatherhood) classification to I-A and sent him a notice of his new classification.</p>\n<p id=\"b1249-12\">Appellant took advantage of his right to a personal appearance before the board, but did not perfect an appeal when the board reaffirmed his I-A delinquency classification. After appellant\u2019s time to take an appeal had expired, the board issued an accelerated induction order, as provided in the delinquency regulations. 32 C.F.R. \u00a7 1642.13 (1969). The day before he was to report for induction, Shea filed the complaint in the present case in the District Court seeking a declaratory judgment that his induction was illegal and an injunction prohibiting his induction.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1249-13\">The District Court dismissed appellant\u2019s complaint for lack of subject matter jurisdiction<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> on the basis of Section 10(b) (3) of the Military Selective Service Act of 1967, as amended, 50 U.S.C. App. \u00a7 460(b) (3) (Supp. IV 1965-1968), and Shea appealed. We have withheld decision pending the Supreme Court\u2019s decisions in Oestereich v. Selec<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1164\">*1164</page-number>tive Service System Local Board No. 11, 393 U.S. 233, 89 S.Ct. 414, 21 L.Ed.2d 402 (1968), and Gutknecht v. United States, 396 U.S. 295, 90 S.Ct. 506, 24 L.Ed.2d 532 (1970). On the basis of the Supreme Court\u2019s decisions in these cases and in Breen v. Selective Service Local Board No. 16, 396 U.S. 460, 90 S.Ct. 661, 24 L.Ed.2d 653 (1970), we think it clear that the District Court\u2019s dismissal must be reversed.</p>\n<p id=\"b1250-4\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b1250-5\">We believe that <em>Gutknecht </em>and <em>Oestereich </em>read together establish that pre-induction judicial review lies whenever the Selective Service System has reclassified a registrant or issued an induction order pursuant to the delinquency regulations struck down in <em>Gutknecht. </em>The Oestereich<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> holding may be divided into two parts: (1) the use of the delinquency regulations to deprive a registrant of a statutory \u201cexemption\u201d to which he was otherwise entitled was unauthorized by the statute; and (2) Section 10(b) (3) does not preclude pre-induction judicial review of such \u201cblatantly lawless\u201d conduct by a local board.</p>\n<p id=\"b1250-6\">Gutknecht<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> explicitly took the first half of the <em>Oestereich </em>holding and broadened it to invalidate the entire delinquency procedure as unauthorized by the statute. In reversing Gutknecht\u2019s conviction of failure to report for induction,<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> the Court explicitly noted that in Gutknecht\u2019s case</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1250-11\">\u201cno \u2018exemption,\u2019 no \u2018deferment,\u2019 no \u2018classification\u2019 in the statutory sense is involved. \u2018Delinquency\u2019 was used here not to change a classification but to accelerate petitioner\u2019s induction * * * ; and it was that difference which led the Court of Appeals to conclude that what we said in <em>Ostereich </em>was not controlling here.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1250-12\">396 U.S. at 304, 90 S.Ct. 506. The Court, however, held that the reasoning in the first part of <em>Oestereich </em>nonetheless controlled Gutknecht\u2019s case. In short, the Court said that <em>any </em>delinquency induction is as \u201cblatantly lawless\u201d as the induction enjoined in <em>Oestereich, </em>without regard to whether a registrant is entitled to an exemption or a deferment. Since it was the \u201cblatantly lawless\u201d character of Oes-tereich\u2019s induction which led the Court to read Section 10(b) (3) to permit pre-induction judicial review in that case, we think the exception to Section 10(b) (3) established by <em>Oestereich </em>must be held, in the light of <em>Gutknecht, </em>to permit pre-induction judicial review <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1165\">*1165</page-number>of 'any induction order issued under the invalid delinquency regulations.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1251-5\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b1251-6\">We think appellant Shea is also entitled to pre-induction judicial review on the basis of the Supreme Court\u2019s decision in <em>Breen</em><footnotemark><em>7</em></footnotemark><em> </em>There the Court extended pre-induction judicial relief to a registrant entitled by statute to a student \u201cdeferment\u201d; the Court could find no significant difference between the statutory \u201cexemption\u201d in <em>Oestereich </em>and the statutory \u201cdeferment\u201d in <em>Breen:</em></p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1251-7\">\u201cWe are consequently unable to distinguish this case from <em>Oestereich. </em>In both situations a draft registrant who was <em>required by the relevant law not to be inducted </em>was in fact ordered to report for military service. # * * &gt;&gt;</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1251-8\">396 U.S. at 467, 90 S.Ct. 661. (Emphasis added.) The Court in <em>Breen </em>particularly noted that the \u201cGovernment has never contested Breen\u2019s factual allegations concerning his student status, nor has it argued that he is not qualified for such a deferment for any reason except the alleged \u2018delinquency.\u2019 \u201d 396 U.S. at 463-464, 90 S.Ct. at 666.</p>\n<p id=\"b1251-10\">In the present case, appellant Shea is unequivocally entitled to a fatherhood deferment by presidential regulations issued pursuant to statutory authorization.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> In other words, he is a registrant who is \u201crequired by the relevant law not to be inducted.\u201d 396 U.S. at 467, 90 S.Ct. at 666. As in <em>Breen, </em>the Government does not contest his qualifications for this deferment, other than his alleged delinquency. In these respects, Shea\u2019s ease is on all fours with <em>Breen. </em>The only difference is that Shea\u2019s unequivocal entitlement to a fatherhood deferment derives from presidential regulations rather than from the statute itself.</p>\n<p id=\"b1251-12\">We cannot believe there is either practical or legal significance in this distinction. We think that Mr. Justice Harlan\u2019s concurrence in <em>Breen </em>succinctly states the <em>ratio decidendi </em>of both that decision ond <em>Oestereich:</em></p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1251-13\">\u201cThe Court\u2019s opinion here, as in Oestereich v. [Selective Service System Local Board No. 11], 393 U.S. 233, 89 S.Ct. 414, 21 L.Ed.2d 402 (1968), appears to make the availability of pre-induction review turn on the lawfulness of the draft board\u2019s action, or to put it another way, on the certainty with which the reviewing court can determine that the registrant would prevail on the merits if there were such judicial review of his classification. * * * \u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1251-14\">396 U.S. at 468, 90 S.Ct. at 666. This reading of the Court\u2019s holding is consistent with the congressional purpose in enacting Section 10(b) (3) to prevent litigious delay in the process of raising an army. Preinduction review will always lie where there is no possibility of such delay, <em>e. g. </em>where the facts are uncontested, no discretion is involved, and the applicable \u201claw\u201d is clear. But whether that \u201claw\u201d involves statute, court de-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1166\">*1166</page-number>cisi\u00f3n or regulation is as irrelevant as whether it involves an \u201cexemption\u201d or a \u201cdeferment.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1252-4\">The judgment of the District Court is reversed and the case is remanded for proceedings consistent with this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b1252-5\">It is so ordered.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1249-10\">. Appellant also applied for a temporary restraining order to stop his induction, but the District Court denied his application. Subsequently, appellant reported to the induction station, but refused to submit to induction. He promptly amended his complaint to request additional relief in the form of an injunction prohibiting the Attorney General from prosecuting him.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b1249-14\">. Our recent decision in Nestor v. Hershey, U.S.App.D.C., No. 23,314, decided December 16, 1969), establishes that venue was proper in the District of Columbia, Slip opinion at 28-32. <em>See </em>Local Board Memorandum No. 85, issued October 24, 1967.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b1250-7\">. In <em>Oestereich </em>the registrant was a divinity student. Section 6(g) of the Military Selective Service Act of 1967, 50 U.S.C. App. \u00a7 456(g) (1964), \u201cexempts\u201d such students from training and service under the Act. Nonetheless, when Oestereich turned his draft card in as a protest against American involvement in the Vietnam war, his local board reclassified him from Class IV \u2014 D (exempt divinity student) to Class I-A (available for service) under the Selective Service System\u2019s delinquency regulations. After exhausting his administrative remedies, he brought suit to restrain his induction. The Supreme Court held that \u00a7 10(b) (3) did not bar pre-induction judicial review because there was no statutory authority to use the delinquency regulations to deprive a registrant of his statutory exemption. 393 U.S. at 237-238, 89 S.Ct. 414.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b1250-14\">. The registrant in <em>Gutknecht </em>was classified I-A as available for induction at the time he turned in his draft card in protest against the Vietnam war. His draft board declared him delinquent, thereby moving him ahead of all other I-A registrants in the order of call. He was then ordered to report for induction under the accelerated induction procedures of the delinquency regulations. When he refused to submit to induction, he was prosecuted and convicted. The Supreme Court reversed his conviction, holding that the delinquency procedure under which he was inducted was without statutory authorization and that his induction order was consequently void.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b1250-15\">. Since <em>Gutknecht </em>involved a criminal prosecution, the Court did not pass on the availability of pre-induction judicial review.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b1251-15\">. This conclusion was reached by the Third Circuit in a well reasoned opinion before the Supreme Court\u2019s decision in <em>(7ut-laieclit. </em>Bucher v. Selective Service System, 406 F.2d 494 (1970). In the present ease we are guided by that decision as well as the authority of <em>Gut-hnecht.</em></p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b1251-16\">. The registrant in <em>Breen </em>was a college student who, under \u00a7 6(h) (1) of the Act, was entitled to a II-S student \u201cdeferment.\u201d When Breen protested American participation in the Vietnam war by turning in his draft card, his draft board declared him delinquent and reclassified him from II-S to I-A. Breen then sought an injunction prohibiting his induction. The Supreme Court held, on the authority of <em>Oestereieh, </em>that his suit was not barred by \u00a7 10(b) (3).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b1251-19\">. 50 U.S.C.
