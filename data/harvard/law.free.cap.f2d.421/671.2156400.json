A jury found him guilty whereupon he was sentenced as a habitual criminal under the New Mexico Code. The Supreme Court of New Mexico affirmed the conviction and sentence. State v. Garcia, 76 N.M. 171, 413 P.2d 210 (1966).</p>\n<p id=\"b757-20\">Garcia then petitioned for relief under the state postconviction rule 93, \u00a7 21-1-1(93) New Mex.Stat.Ann. (1953). The trial court denied the petition and the Supreme Court of New Mexico affirmed. State v. Garcia, 79 N.M. 575, 446 P.2d 442 (1968). This procedure exhausted state remedies.</p>\n<p id=\"b757-21\">The issues tendered to the federal district court in the \u00a7 2254 motion were:</p>\n<p id=\"b757-22\">(1) Was Garcia's arrest illegal on the ground that it was effected without probable cause?</p>\n<p id=\"b757-23\">(2) Was a package of marijuana erroneously admitted at the trial on the ground that it constituted a fruit of the unlawful action of the arresting officer?</p>\n<p id=\"b757-24\">The lower court reviewed the transcripts of both state court proceedings together with the above cited decisions of the state supreme court and denied the relief petitioned for under \u00a7 2254.</p>\n<p id=\"b757-25\">On direct appeal of the conviction the New Mexico Supreme Court considered as one of the issues presented to it, whether the package of marijuana should be suppressed as the fruit of an illegal search because the arrest was made without probable cause. The court recites the facts adduced at the trial in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"672\">*672</page-number>detail. Garda, <em>supra, </em>413 P.2d at 211, 212.</p>\n<p id=\"b758-5\">The pertinent facts elicited and relied upon by Garcia disclose that local officers received a tip from an unidentified informer that a marijuana transaction was being negotiated at a bus terminal in Santa Fe, New Mexico. While this information was being given, an automobile passed by and the informer identified the occupants as the persons he overheard negotiating the marijuana transaction. The officers separated in two automobiles and proceeded to follow the identified automobile. A surveillance of the actions of Garcia and his associate disclosed a brief stop and entrance of Garcia into an apartment in the city. When Garcia returned to the automobile the surveillance continued until the officers stopped the car. Before alighting from the police car the officers saw Garcia throw a package out of the car onto the ground. One officer retrieved the package which contained the marijuana evidence introduced at the trial. Almost simultaneously Garcia was arrested by the other officers.</p>\n<p id=\"b758-6\">In answering the claim of error charged on direct appeal, the court quoted from a Tenth Circuit case: \u201c \u2018As the evidence was obtained prior to and independent of arrest, the arguments of counsel as to the legality of the arrest merit no consideration.\u2019 \u201d Garcia, <em>supra, </em>413 P.2d at 213.</p>\n<p id=\"b758-7\">In the state post-conviction proceeding the single point urged was: \u201c \u2018Defendant\u2019s conviction was obtained as the result of evidence secured through an illegal detention and arrest of defendant without probable cause and without obtaining in advance a warrant for defendant\u2019s arrest or a search warrant, although ample opportunity and time existed for police officers to obtain such warrants.\u2019 \u201d Garcia, <em>supra, </em>446 P.2d at 442.</p>\n<p id=\"b758-8\">In its decision reviewing the denial of post-conviction relief the Supreme Court of New Mexico reiterated the facts set forth in its prior opinion. The court then said: \u201cAt the hearing, the testimony with regard to the evidence being secured through an illegal arrest and detention was a renewal and rehash of the evidence previously considered and disposed of adversely to appellant.\u201d Garcia, <em>supra, </em>446 P.2d at 443.</p>\n<p id=\"b758-10\">The federal district court in denying the relief which generated this appeal presumed the factual determination twice made by the highest court of the state was correct in accordance with the language of \u00a7 2254(d) as amended November 2, 1966. It also examined the complete transcripts of both previous state hearings to determine the sufficiency of the evidence to support the state court's determination. The trial court, satisfied that the state hearing evidenced that Garcia\u2019s constitutional rights had been adequately considered and protected, denied the relief.</p>\n<p id=\"b758-11\">We examined the state transcripts and the opinions of the New Mexico Supreme Court and agree with the trial court\u2019s determination.</p>\n<p id=\"b758-12\">\u201c[I]n absence of an applicable federal statute the law of the state where an arrest without warrant takes place determines its validity.\u201d United States v. Di Re, 332 U.S. 581, 589, 68 S.Ct. 222, 226, 92 L.Ed. 210 (1948). The New Mexico Supreme Court has made the determination construing its state\u2019s law. The trial court found, and we agree, that the determination of the Supreme Court of New Mexico settled the question.</p>\n<p id=\"b758-14\">We recognize an effort to torture the facts presumed to be correct under \u00a7 2254(d) in an effort to fit them under a rule inapplicable to those facts. Garcia urges Henry v. United States, 361 U.S. 98, 80 S.Ct. 168, 4 L.Ed.2d 134 (1959) controls the issue here presented. The majority stated in that case, \u201cThe prosecution conceded below, and adheres to the concession here, that the arrest took place when the federal agents stopped the car.\u201d Henry, <em>supra, </em>at 103, 80 S.Ct. at 171. The dissent filed in <em>Henry </em>says: \u201cWhile the Government, unnecessarily it seems to me, conceded that the arrest was made at the time the car was stopped, this Court is not bound by the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"673\">*673</page-number>Government\u2019s mistakes.\u201d Henry, <em>supra, </em>at 104-105, 80 S.Ct. at 172.</p>\n<p id=\"b759-4\">In this case there was no concession regarding the time of arrest. The Supreme Court of New Mexico, examining the record of the trial court, determined on the facts that the arrest came after the voluntary disposal of the questioned evidence by Garcia and therefore was not connected with the arrest. The court\u2019s determination does not torture the record.</p>\n<p id=\"b759-5\">\u201cIt has long been settled that objects falling in the plain view of an officer who has a right to be in the position to have that view are subject to seizure and may be introduced in evidence.\u201d Harris v. United States, 390 U.S. 234, 236, 88 S.Ct. 992, 993, 19 L.Ed.2d 1067 (1968). <em>See </em>Jackson v. United States, 112 U.S.App.D.C. 191, 301 F.2d 515 (1962), cert. denied, 369 U.S. 859, 82 S.Ct. 947, 8 L.Ed.2d 17 (1962).</p>\n<p id=\"b759-6\">We therefore affirm the court below and hold relief was properly denied.</p>\n<p id=\"b759-7\">Affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
