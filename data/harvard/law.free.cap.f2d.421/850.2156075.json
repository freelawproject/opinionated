The district judge, after full trial, found the latter date. On review, we find no factual or legal error. We affirm on the opinion of the district judge. Lundy Packing Company v. United States, 302 F.Supp. 182 (E.D. N.C.1969).</p>\n<p id=\"b937-13\">Affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b937-14\"> While benefits to employees were denominated \u201csick benefits,\u201d they were paid not only for sickness but also in the event of retirement, death or termination of employment. As a consequence, the \u201csick pay plan\u201d was treated by IRS and the district court as being, in part, a deferred compensation plan so that the deductibility of amounts accrued thereunder was governed by \u00a7 404 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1954, rather than \u00a7 162.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
