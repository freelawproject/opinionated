He also alleges that the confession was introduced into evidence without a judicial determination first being made as to its voluntariness, that evidence was seized during an illegal search, that his requests for counsel made prior to giving his confession were denied, that he was not advised of his rights, and that he was forced to participate in a line-up before the victim.</p>\n<p id=\"b271-11\">The record before the district court included a copy of the transcript of the evidentiary hearing held in the state trial court pursuant to Rule 11.07, Vernon\u2019s Ann.Texas Code of Criminal Procedure. The court below found ample evidence to support the findings and conclusions of the state court that the confession and plea of guilty were freely and voluntarily given and were not the result of threats, promises, or coercion. The state court also found that the confession was not introduced into evidence at the trial. A reading of the transcript reveals no clear error in these findings. 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254. The confession and plea of guilty being found to be voluntarily made, the remaining allegations of the appellant need not be considered, for by pleading guilty a defendant waives all prior non-jurisdictional defects in the proceedings against him.

Pursuant to Rule 18 of the Rules of this Court, we have concluded on the merits that this case is of such character as not to justify oral argument and have directed the clerk to place the case on the Summary Calendar and to notify the parties in writing.
