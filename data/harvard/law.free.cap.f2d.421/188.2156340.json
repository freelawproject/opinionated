We also conclude that no previous proceedings foreclose this issue, and that when respondent entered into its new contract with District 50 on April 17, 1967, covering all of the operations with the normal exclusions, this violated the principle recognized by both parties as the Midwest Piping rule. Midwest Piping &amp; Supply Co., 63 NLRB 1060 (1945).</p>\n<p id=\"b275-19\">Upon carrying out the Board\u2019s order, the employees of the units in question will have full opportunity to choose their bargaining agent. This, in essence, is what is contemplated by the act. We conclude that the record in this ease warrants the entering of the Board\u2019s order.</p>\n<p id=\"b275-20\">The Board\u2019s order will be enforced.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b275-12\">. * * * When an employer is faced with conflicting claims of rival unions and a serious question exists as to which union represents a majority of employees, the employer must adhere to a policy of strict neutrality. The employer must withhold recognition of either union, until the rivalry is settled at the polls in a Board-conducted, secret election. N.L.R.B. v. Signal Oil <em>&amp; </em>Gas Co. (5th Cir., 1962) 303 F.2d 785, 786-787.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
