Employer Bay appeals, complaining of the trial court\u2019s charge to the jury.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1485-10\">Appellant objects first to a charge <footnotemark>2</footnotemark> given on the decreased purchasing power of the dollar. This Court has held permissible a charge to the jury that it can consider the <em>present </em>purchasing power of the dollar <em>(See </em>New Amsterdam Casualty Co. v. Soileau, 5th Cir. 1948, 167 F.2d 767, 6 A.L.R.2d 128, cert. denied, 335 U.S. 822, 69 S.Ct. 45, 93 L.Ed. 376), but appellant urges here that the court erred because it allowed the jury to engage in speculation concerning future dollar values. The objection is without merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b1485-11\">Tfie second complaint appellant makes is to the court\u2019s refusal to give a charge instructing the jury that any award for damages would not be subject to payment ,of federal or state income taxes. We believe the refusal was proper. Prudential Insurance Company of America v. Wilkerson, 5th Cir. 1964, 327 F.2d 997; Payne v. Baltimore and Ohio Railroad Company, 6th Cir. 1962, 309 F.2d 546, cert. denied, 374 U.S. 827, 83 S.Ct. 1865, 10 L.Ed.2d 1051; Cunningham v. Rederiet Vindeggen A/S, 2nd Cir. 1964, 333 F.2d 308.</p>\n<p id=\"b1485-13\">Affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1485-21\">. Pursuant to Rule 18 of the Rules of this Court, we have concluded on the merits that this case is of such character as not to justify oral argument and have directed the clerk to place the case on the Summary Calendar and to notify the parties in writing. <em>See </em>Murphy v. Houma Well Service, 5th Cir. 1969, 409 F.2d 804, Part I; and Huth v. Southern Pacific Company, 5th Cir. 1969, 417 F.2d 526, Part. I.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b1485-30\">. \u201cIt is now well recognized that the decreased purchasing power of the dollar, due to rise in living expenses, is a proper element for consideration in determining the amount of award in a tort action. Courts take judicial notice of that fact.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
