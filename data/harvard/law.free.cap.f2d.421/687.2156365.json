Breaux commenced this action in the United States District Court for the Western District of Louisiana to obtain judicial review of a determination by the Secretary of H.E.W. that he is not entitled under the Social Security Act either to a period of disability or disability insurance benefits. The district court affirmed the Secretary\u2019s decision and Breaux here contends that the court erred in finding that the Secretary\u2019s determination was based on substantial evidence. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b774-19\">Under \u00a7 205(g) of the Social Security Act, the Secretary\u2019s finding of facts is conclusive if supported by \u201csubstantial evidence.\u201d<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> This term is defined by the Supreme Court in NLRB v. Columbian Enameling and Stamping Company, as follows:</p>\n<p id=\"b774-20\">Substantial evidence is more than a scintilla, and must do more than create a suspicion of the existence of the fact to be established. \u201cIt means such relevant evidence as a reasonable mind might accept as adequate to support a conclusion,\u201d Consolidated Edison Co. v. National Labor Relations Board, supra [305 U.S. 197, 229], 59 S.Ct. [206] 217 [83 L.Ed. 126], and it must be enough to justify, if the trial were to a jury, a refusal to direct a verdict when the conclusion sought to be <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"689\">*689</page-number>drawn from it is one of fact for the jury, [citations omitted] <footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b775-5\">In the instant case, the evidence relating to Breaux\u2019s physical condition consists of medical records and testimony by Dr. Norman P. Morin, an orthopedic surgeon. Breaux contends that the records are hearsay, that the doctor\u2019s testimony is hearsay upon hearsay since he had not examined appellant, and that, according to the principle announced in Cohen v. Perales,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> uncorroborated hearsay evidence can not be considered \u201csubstantial evidence.\u201d While the original decision in <em>Cohen </em>may have provided some support, even though slight, for the principle relied on by appellant, this court\u2019s opinion on petition for rehearing clearly undermines such an inference:</p>\n<p id=\"b775-6\">Our opinion holds, and we reaffirm, that mere uncorroborated hearsay evidence as to the physical condition of a claimant, standing alone and without more, in a social security disability case tried before a hearing examiner, as in our case, is not substantial evidence that will support a decision of the examiner adverse to the claimant, if the claimant objects to the hearsay evidence, and if the hearsay evidence is directly contradicted by the testimony of live medical witnesses and by the claimant who testifies in person before the examiner, as was done in the case at bar. This is especially true if the claimant requests that the absent medical witnesses of the HEW who authored the hearsay evidence, be subpoenaed to testify at the hearing and the examiner fails or refuses to summon them.</p>\n<p id=\"b775-13\">When these conditions are not present, there is nothing to prevent an examiner from basing his decision, which is adverse to the claimant, on hearsay medical evidence, if such evidence has sufficient probative force to support his decision.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b775-14\">Moreover, <em>Cohen </em>is distinguishable from the case presently before us in that no physician testified in behalf of Breaux, and appellant did not request that absent medical witnesses be subpoenaed. Indeed, other than his own testimony, appellant must also rely upon hearsay evidence to prove his disability. In the circumstances, we are of the opinion that the Secretary\u2019s conclusion was supported by substantial evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b775-15\">Appellant also contends that the Secretary\u2019s finding that he is able to engage in substantial gainful work is not supported by substantial evidence. There is clearly evidence that appellant has suffered only a 20% disability and is quite capable of engaging in light work such as janitor in a school or bank, watchman, or the delivery of light objects. Breaux insists that it was necessary for the Secretary to have a vocational expert testify that light work existed in the national economy.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> We think it was quite proper for the Secretary to take administrative notice of this fact.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> If the nature of Breaux\u2019s disability limited the scope of light work which he could perform, his argument would be much more persuasive. However, he is perfectly capable of engaging in an infinite variety of jobs which can be classified as light work and it was not necessary for the Secretary to pro-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"690\">*690</page-number>duee evidence of the obvious fact that light work exists in the national economy.
