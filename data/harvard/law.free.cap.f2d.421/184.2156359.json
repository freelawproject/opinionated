From our examination of the record, we have concluded that the testimony of the accomplice was not uncorroborated. But even were that testimony uncorroborated, it would be sufficient to sustain the conviction. (E. g., Lannom v. United States (9th Cir. 1968) 401 F.2d 504; Grant v. United States (9th Cir. 1967) 371 F.2d 400). His remaining contentions, each of which is related to his primary contention, likewise fail.</p>\n<p id=\"b270-19\">The judgment is affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
