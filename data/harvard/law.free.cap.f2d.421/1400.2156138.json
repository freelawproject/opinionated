On this record we think the Judge was entitled to conclude that there was no genuine issue of fact regarding the failure of the employee to exhaust his remedies under the Railway Labor Act including the ultimate submission of this minor grievance to the Railway Labor Board of Adjustment. The result is that the judgment must be affirmed. But we stress that this is on the present record only and this is without prejudice to whatever rights the employee might have before the Railway Labor Board of Adjustment and this affirmance is in no sense to constitute res judicata, collateral estoppel or the like.</p>\n<p id=\"b1487-18\">Affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
