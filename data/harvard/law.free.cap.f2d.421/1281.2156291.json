He brought suit asserting his employer\u2019s liability based upon both negligence under the Jones Act, 46 U.S.C. \u00a7 688, and unseaworthiness of the vessel.</p>\n<p id=\"b1368-9\">The case was tried before a jury. At the close of all the evidence, the district court denied Mascola\u2019s motion for a directed verdict but granted a like motion by the employer. On this appeal Masc\u00f3la contends that either his case presented sufficient evidence to reach the jury or that the evidence required a directed verdict in his favor. We reverse the trial court\u2019s verdict and remand for a jury determination of liability.</p>\n<p id=\"b1368-11\">The appellant testified that when he was standing the mid-watch, from midnight to 4 a. m., the second mate, who was in the wheelhouse and in charge of the watch, ordered him to get fresh coffee for the next watch. Masc\u00f3la claims that the command which sent him out onto the deck on this errand,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> despite his objections, was an improvident order under the circumstances.</p>\n<p id=\"b1368-12\">The <em>Point Loma, </em>a T-2 tanker en route from Port Arthur, Texas, to St. Peters-burg, Florida, was encountering a northerly wind measured at Force 6 on the Beaufort Scale (25-31 miles per hour) at the time of this incident. Its log entry for 2 a. m. recorded that the temperature was between 72 and 63 degrees, the weather was mostly clear, and that the vessel was encountering \u201cstrong, choppy, northerly seas.\u201d Masc\u00f3la testified that the \u201cstrong\u201d seas included waves of 15-20 feet, reaching the deck on which the accident occurred. He also noted that the loaded tanker was listing and had been equipped with emergency lifelines because it was taking on seas during what he described as the \u201crough\u201d weather.</p>\n<p id=\"b1368-13\">The errand required the appellant to make his way from the vessel\u2019s forward house down to a catwalk above the main deck, along this walkway to the after house, and then up to the second or boat deck level and the entrance to the after house, which the district court found was about 20 feet above water level. Throughout this trip, it was necessary for Masc\u00f3la to maintain his hold upon the ship\u2019s railings while carrying both the coffee box and a flashlight. He accomplished this by holding to the railing at all times with one hand and carrying both the cumbersome box, which he described as a \u201cmonstrous thing\u201d measuring eighteen inches square by eight <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1283\">*1283</page-number>inches deep and weighing about eight pounds, and the flashlight in the other.</p>\n<p id=\"b1369-5\">Masc\u00f3la reached the after house without incident and secured fresh coffee; but as he began the return trip with his burden, preceded by another seaman whom he had asked to light his way, he fell on the boat deck, in the lee of the after house. He testified:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1369-6\">\u201cWell, as I was proceeding to go forward on the boat deck, Charlie Estene, my watch partner was giving me the light and at that precise moment the ship took on a heavy swell or seas, whatever you want to call it, but it took on a lot of water. At that particular time there was no light for my footing to see where I was going. The deck was wet and I lost my footing and I slipped and the coffee box landed under my back and I fell on top of it.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1369-7\">The district court directed a verdict of non-liability because it found that the seas were \u201cnot that excessive\u201d and that any water on the deck was \u201cnot an unreasonable condition to find aboard a vessel of this kind or indeed practically any kind that I can think of.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1369-8\">While a wet deck in itself does not furnish a basis for finding a ship unseaworthy, the order in question required an errand under circumstances which also included the darkness of the mid-watch, a breeze which was not insignificant, the necessity of carrying the loaded coffee box while depending upon a flashlight not directed where the appellant needed it most, and a possible alternative course of action which might not have been disclosed to Masc\u00f3la. There was evidence from which reasonable men might find the order improvident, and an evaluation of possible employer negligence in giving an order under circumstances involving such a set of interlocking variables is precisely the task of a jury in cases such as this. See Gerald v. United States Lines Co., 368 F.2d 343; 22 A.L.R.3d 619 (2 Cir. 1966); cf. Waldron v. Moore-McCormack Lines, Inc., 386 U.S. 724, 87 S.Ct. 1410, 18 L.Ed.2d 482 (1967). As the Supreme Court has often asserted, the jury \u201cplays a preeminent role in these Jones Act cases.\u201d Ferguson v. Moore-McCormack Lines, Inc., 352 U.S. 521, 523, 77 S.Ct. 457, 458, 1 L.Ed.2d 511 (1957).</p>\n<p id=\"b1369-10\">On the other hand, the evidence was certainly not so conclusive of negligence as to entitle Masc\u00f3la to a directed verdict in his favor.</p>\n<p id=\"b1369-11\">Reversed and remanded.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1368-10\">. Masc\u00f3la, who was the only witness at trial, testified that the officer gave him a direct order, and that the mate did not suggest that he might comply with it by obtaining coffee from the officers\u2019 quarters nearby. While the trial court expressed doubt that the evidence established beyond question that an explicit order had been given, it necessarily assumed the credibility of the appellant\u2019s testimony in regard to both these points when passing upon the employer\u2019s motion for a directed verdict.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
