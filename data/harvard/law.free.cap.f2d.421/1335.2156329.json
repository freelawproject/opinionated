This organizational activity took place in the employer\u2019s Orlando, Florida manufacturing plant where the company manufactures men\u2019s trousers.</p>\n<p id=\"b1423-5\">The 8(a) (1) violations were threats of economic reprisals against union adherence and threats of plant shut downs if the union was successful in its organization attempts, etc. The \u00a7 8(a) (3) violation was the discriminatory discharge of one of the female workers in the plant. As is usually the case, the employer claims the discharge was for cause. A slightly different twist is added to the usual 8(a) (3) violation, however, since the alleged discriminatee admittedly had been engaged in a loud vocal dispute with her employer and discharged apparently for cause shortly before the discharge at issue. The employee was, however, rehired and there is substantial evidence supporting the Board\u2019s conclusion that the second discharge was discriminatory.</p>\n<p id=\"b1423-6\"> As to both the \u00a7 8(a) (1) and \u00a7 8(a) (3) violations, the Board\u2019s findings were based upon acceptable credibility choices that are for the Board and not for this Court. NLRB v. Finesilver Mfg. Co., 5 Cir., 1968, 400 F.2d 644; NLRB v. Great Atlantic and Pacific Tea Co., 5 Cir., 1969, 406 F.2d 1173.</p>\n<p id=\"b1423-7\">It therefore follows without question that the Board\u2019s cease and desist order should be enforced insofar as it pertains to \u00a7 8(a) (1) coercive conduct and the reinstatement of the discriminatee with backpay.</p>\n<p id=\"b1423-11\">The Board was not, however, justified in expanding the hearing examiner\u2019s recommended order to provide that the employer should cease from \u201cin any other manner, interfering with, restraining, or coercing employees in the exercise of the rights granted in \u00a7 '7 of the act.\u201d It would be quite sufficient to retain the words used by the hearing examiner both in the order and notice\u2014 \u201cin any like or related manner\u201d- \u2014 for the too broad term \u2014 \u201cin any other manner\u201d \u2014used by the Board.</p>\n<p id=\"b1423-12\">Such broad orders will be enforced by this Court only when there has been a showing of a \u201cproclivity\u201d to violate the act. While remedy is ordinarily for the Board, NLRB v. Gissel Packing Co., 1969, 395 U.S. 575, 610, 89 S.Ct. 1918, 1938, 23 L.Ed.2d 547, 576, we scrutinize orders in the light of the record. \u201cTo limit and protect its contempt jurisdiction, this Court has not allowed orders so broad as to go beyond the class of violations involved in the case in the absence of a strong showing that the company has a proclivity to disregard the Act in its entirety.\u201d NLRB v. Great Atlantic and Pacific Tea Co., <em>supra, </em>at 406 F.2d 1175; J. P. Stevens &amp; Co. v. NLRB, 5 Cir., 1969, 417 F.2d 533 [Oct. 3, 1969].</p>\n<p id=\"b1423-13\">Here there is no adequate showing of such prior conduct. Although the violations here may be considered extensive, a representation election was held, the Union won, and in due course a collective bargaining agreement has been entered into between the employer and the Union. Thus we believe that the proper course is to limit the breadth of the order to conduct like or related to the violations found by the Board.</p>\n<p id=\"b1423-14\">Enforced as modified.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1423-8\">. Pursuant to Rule 18 of the Rules of this Court, we have concluded on the merits that this case is of such character as not to justify oral argument and have directed the clerk to place the case on the Summary Calendar and to notify the parties in writing.
