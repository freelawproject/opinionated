Upon a careful reading of the record, we conclude that the judgment must be af<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"179\">*179</page-number>firmed.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The testimony of fourteen witnesses appearing on behalf of the prosecution establishes that Reynolds, brandishing a gasoline company credit card stamped with the name of another, engaged in a criminal fraud or swindle during the course of his cross-country travels.</p>\n<p id=\"b265-4\">Affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b264-14\">. Section 1341 reads as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b264-15\">\u201cWhoever, having devised or intending to devise any scheme or artifice to defraud, or for obtaining money or property by means of false or fraudulent pretenses, representations, or promises, or to sell, dispose of, loan, exchange, alter, give away, distribute, supply, or furnish or procure for unlawful use any counterfeit or spurious coin, obligation, security, or other article, or anything represented to be or intimated or held out to be such counterfeit or spurious article, for the purpose of executing such scheme or artifice or attempting so to do, places in any post office or authorized depository for mail matter, any matter or thing whatever to be sent or delivered by the Post Office Department, or takes or receives therefrom, any such matter or thing, or knowingly causes to be delivered by mail according to the direction thereon, or at the place at which it is directed to be delivered by the person to whom it is addressed, any such matter or thing, shall be fined not more than $1,000 or imprisoned not more than five years, or both.\u201d</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b265-15\">. We have concluded on the merits that this case is of the character that does not justify oral argument. Therefore, we have directed the Clerk to place the case on the Summary Calendar and to notify the parties of this action in writing. 5 Cir.R. 18; <em>see </em>Huth v.
