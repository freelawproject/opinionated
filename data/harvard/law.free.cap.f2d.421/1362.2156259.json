Coleman is confined in the Chil-licothe Correctional Institution at Chil-licothe, Ohio, serving three concurrent life sentences for Breaking and Entering in violation of Section 2907.09, Ohio Re<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1363\">*1363</page-number>vised Code, and three concurrent sentences of Grand Larceny, running consecutively to the life sentences, in violation of Section 2907.20, Ohio Revised Code.</p>\n<p id=\"b1449-4\">This is appellant\u2019s fifth case<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> on the dockets of this court.</p>\n<p id=\"b1449-5\">In his brief on appeal now before the Court appellant poses nine questions. Six of these questions relate to evidence, three of which involve the search of his wife\u2019s automobile. This search was held valid in 387 F.2d 134. By two of the questions appellant alleges that the trial judge erred in his instructions to the jury. In the last question, appellant claims that he is entitled to immediate release from state custody by reason of the violation of his constitutional rights as enumerated in the above questions.</p>\n<p id=\"b1449-8\">The appellant\u2019s petition sounds more in the nature of an appeal on the merits of the conviction to the state appellate court than it does in habeas corpus.</p>\n<p id=\"b1449-9\">Over and over the appellant says that the constitutional questions herein were raised and created by our Court by its rulings of December 21, 1967 and March 25, 1968, 387 F.2d 134. Just how we created a denial of appellant\u2019s constitutional rights in his trial in the state court in 1961 is not quite clear.</p>\n<p id=\"b1449-10\">Upon consideration, it is ordered that the judgment of the District Court be and it is hereby affirmed upon the opinion of Judge Lambros, reported at 308 F.Supp. 752.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1449-6\">.
