Judge Elliott entered judgment for the defendants based upon succinct findings of fact and conclusions of law reported in 159 U.S.P.Q. 363.</p>\n<p id=\"b366-29\">Certificate of registration dated September 6, 1960, Class G. No. 26299 is to a 12\" x 12\" architectural metal casting unit intended for use in combination or singly for a decorative screen or room divider to \u201cfinish up\u201d a space. The judgment was based upon five different grounds which we have rearranged for convenience of discussion: (1) that the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"281\">*281</page-number>architectural unit does not possess the minimal degree of creativity required of a work of art; (2) that plaintiff offered no evidence of initial publication with copyright notice; (3) that there was no evidence that all copies of the unit manufactured by the defendant bore the copyright notice; (4) that the notation \u201cTFC Co. \u00a9\u201d on the unit is not adequate notice of copyright; (5) that the photographic representations of the unit in defendant Moultrie\u2019s catalog did not constitute copyright infringement but were within the doctrine of \u201cfair use.\u201d We do not agree with the district court on any one of the five grounds, nor on its further finding as to (6) whether the changes which defendants made in its revised design suffice to avoid infringing plaintiff\u2019s copyright. Answering that question in the negative, we reverse and remand for a determination of damages and entry of judgment enjoining further infringement and awarding damages to the plaintiff.</p>\n<p id=\"b367-4\">(1) <em>Creativity.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b367-5\">The filigree pattern of the unit was formed entirely of intercepting straight lines and arc lines, but was original with the artist employed by plaintiff. It proved to be acceptable to architects, contractors and decorators and commercially successful. In 1962 the defendants came into possession of a copy of the unit on which the copyright notice had been obscured by paint. Using that unit as a mold the defendants made a pattern from the design and marketed the same. They also made a catalog and an advertising mat of the design and distributed them by mail and through their sales representative.</p>\n<p id=\"b367-6\">Defendants\u2019 use of the design first came to the attention of plaintiff\u2019s president in a news release in the Flower &amp; Garden Magazine of September 1962. He telephoned to defendant Smith, the president of the defendant Moultrie, \u201ctelling him that this was ours, and he [Smith] intimated that they would do nothing further, and that this would be dropped.\u201d The defendants redesigned their unit by adding four intercepting straight lines in the form of a diamond to the filigree pattern, and made no further sales of a unit identical with plaintiffs. The defendants, however, continued to distribute the catalog and some 2 years later, August 24, 1964, plaintiff\u2019s counsel wrote a letter demanding the termination of the production of the design and payment of damages. Mr. Smith replied on August 26, stating that the design was being withdrawn from the new catalog which would be released in January or February of 1965, and that if any orders were received for the product they would be forwarded on to the plaintiff. The defendants, however, continued to use the old catalog until sometime in 1966 and the price list on the item until January 1, 1968. In the new catalog there were contained photographic representations of the design.</p>\n<p id=\"b367-9\">\u201cIn order to be acceptable as a work of art, the work must embody some creative authorship in its delineation or form.\u201d Rules and Regulations of the Copyright Office, 17 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 207 Rule 202.10(b); 37 C.F.R. \u00a7 202.10(b). \u201cIn order to be copyrightable, a work must contain at least a certain minimum amount of authorship in the form of original literary, artistic, or musical expression.\u201d Copyright Office Cir. 32. The circular lists as \u201ccommon examples of uncopyrightable works\u201d: \u201ctime cards, report forms, graph paper, account books, diaries, checks, score cards, address books, order forms, vouchers, and the like.\u201d On the other hand, lack of artistic merit is no bar to copyright. Rushton v. Vitale, 2 Cir. 1955, 218 F.2d 434, 435. Compare 18 C.J.S. Copyright and Literary Property \u00a7 26, p. 169.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"Aca\">\u201cAll that is needed to satisfy both the Constitution and the statute is that the \u2018author\u2019 contributed something more than a \u2018merely trivial\u2019 variation, something recognizably \u2018his own.\u2019 Originality in this context \u2018means little more than a prohibition of actual copying.\u2019 No matter how poor artistically the \u2018author\u2019s\u2019 addition, it is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"282\">*282</page-number>enough if it be his own. [Bleistein v. Donaldson Lithographing Co., 188 U. S. 239, 250, 23 S.Ct. 298, 47 L.Ed. 460].\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b368-4\">Alfred Bell &amp; Co. v. Catalda Fine Arts, 2 Cir. 1951, 191 F.2d 99, 102-103.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> That the filigree pattern on plaintiff\u2019s unit was designed by his artist is conceded. The defendants displayed a persistent desire to reproduce or capitalize on the unit. The language of Justice Holmes in Bleistein v. Donaldson Lithographing Co., <em>supra, </em>is pertinent:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b368-5\"><em>\u201cIt </em>would <em>be </em>a dangerous undertaking for persons trained only to the law to constitute themselves final judges of the worth of pictorial illustrations, outside of the narrowest and most obvious limits. At the one extreme some works of genius would be sure to miss appreciation. Their very novelty would make them repulsive until the public had learned the new language in which their author spoke. It may be more than doubted, for instance, whether the etchings of Goya or the paintings of Manet would have been sure of protection when seen for the first time. At the other end, copyright would be denied to pictures which appealed to a public less educated than the judge. Yet if they command the interest of any public, they have a commercial value, \u2014 it would be bold to say that they have not an aesthetic and educational value, \u2014 and the taste of any public is not to be treated with contempt. It is an ultimate fact for the moment, whatever may be our hopes for a change. That these pictures had their worth and their success is sufficiently shown by the desire to reproduce them without regard to the plaintiffs\u2019 rights.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b368-13\">188 U.S. at 251, 252, 23 S.Ct. at 300.</p>\n<p id=\"A1S\">We hold that plaintiff\u2019s architectural unit possessed at least the minimal degree of creativity required for copyright.</p>\n<p id=\"b368-15\">(2) <em>Initial Copyright Notice.</em></p>\n<p id=\"ATr\">Initial publication with copyright notice is a prerequisite to a valid copyright. 17 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 10. A rule requires the Copyright Office to reject an application for copyright registration when the copyright notice does not meet the requirements of the law. Sec. 202.-2(b) of the Regulations of the Copyright Office; 17 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 207, Rule 202.2(b); 37 C.F.R. \u00a7 202.2(b). The certificate of registration \u201cshall be admitted in any court as prima facie evidence of the facts stated therein.\u201d 17 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 209. The pertinent certificate of registration shows \u201c6(a) Date of Publication: 1st April, 1960.\u201d Despite some authority to the contrary,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> the better rule and that sustained by the weight of authority is that the certificate of registration is prima facie evidence of the validity of the copyright, including the fact that the initial publication was with copyright notice.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"ABV\">(3) <em>Subsequent Copyright Notices.</em></p>\n<p id=\"AMv\">The plaintiff did not have the <em>heavy </em>burden of proving that <em>all </em>publications were with copyright notice; instead, the burden rested on the defend<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"283\">*283</page-number>ants to establish invalidation of the copyright.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b369-4\">(4) <em>Adequacy of Notice of Copyright.</em></p>\n<p id=\"A-p\">The district court held that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AGs\">\u201cThe notation TFC Co. \u00a9 which appeared on the copy of Plaintiff\u2019s work which was made of record is not adequate notice of copyright as required by the copyright law since TFC Co. is not the Plaintiff\u2019s name nor the name by which Plaintiff is known in the industry and the Plaintiff\u2019s full name does not appear elsewhere on the work.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b369-5\">We do not agree with the district court\u2019s literal application of 17 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 19 to the facts of this case. The Certificate of Registration of the copyright listed the name of the claimant as \u201cTennessee Fabricating Company d/b/a TFC Co.\u201d Abe Sauer, plaintiff\u2019s president, testified without contradiction:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b369-6\">\u201cQ. Does Tennessee Fabricating Company do business as TFC Company?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b369-7\">\u201cA. It does. That is our trade-mark and standard name registered with the Federal Government as a trademark.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b369-8\">All of plaintiff\u2019s advertising in evidence bore the abbreviation. We agree with the holding of then Chief District Judge Dyer in Key West Hand Print Fabrics, Inc. v. Serbin, Inc., S.D.Fla.1966, 269 F.Supp. 605, 611, that \u201cindeed, it is not necessary that the owner\u2019s true name be used at all so long as a name with which it is identified is . used and no innocent persons are misled.\u201d Affirmed per curiam, Serbin, Inc. v. Key West Hand Print Fabrics, Inc., 5 Cir. 1967, 381 F.2d 735. <em>See also </em>Dan Kasoff, Inc. v. Gresco Jewelry Co., S.D.N. Y.1962, 204 F.Supp. 694, aff\u2019d 308 F.2d 806 (2 Cir. 1962); Doran v. Sunset House Distributing Co., S.D.Calif.1961, 197 F.Supp. 940, aff\u2019d 304 F.2d 251 (9 Cir. 1962); Nimmer on Copyright \u00a7 314; 18 Am.Jur.2d Copyright and Literary Property, \u00a7 62; 18 C.J.S. Copyright and Literary Property \u00a7 71, p. 195, notes 76 and 79.</p>\n<p id=\"A8R\">(5) <em>Fair Use.</em></p>\n<p id=\"AZ8\"> The district court held:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AQI\">\u201cThe photographic representations which appeared in Defendants\u2019 catalog did not constitute copyright infringement and were within the doctrine of fair use for the purpose of advertising the subject architectural units.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b369-18\">The concept of \u201cfair use\u201d is admirably explained by John Schulman in an article in the Iowa Law Review:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b369-19\">\u201cThe doctrine of \u2018fair use,\u2019 as a balance wheel and safety valve for the copyright system, was promulgated more than one hundred thirty years ago, as a judicial rule of public policy.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> * * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"Aey\">\u201cThe authorities are in agreement that the line of demarcation between \u2018fair use\u2019 and copyright infringement cannot be determined by resort to any arbitrary rules or fixed criteria. In each situation, the decision depends on an examination of a variety factors which include:<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b369-23\">\u201c1. The nature and purpose of the respective works;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b369-24\">\u201c2. The quantity and importance of the portions taken;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b370-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"284\">*284</page-number>\u201c3. The relation of the portions used to the respective works of which they are a part;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b370-4\">\u201c4. The impact of the use of these portions upon the demand for the copyrighted publication.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b370-5\">\u201cThis flexibility in the concept necessarily flows from the fact that the \u2018fair use\u2019 privilege is predicated upon good faith and fair dealing. It serves the purpose of maintaining a proper balance between the exclusive rights secured to authors under the Copyright Statute, and the correlative right of the public to benefit from those contributions to literature, science, and the arts for which protection is provided for authors and other creators. * * *\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b370-6\">53 Iowa Law Review 832, 833.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b370-7\">The topic of \u201cfair use\u201d is fully and ably discussed by Judge Leonard Moore in Rosemont Enterprises, Inc. v. Random House, Inc., 2 Cir. 1966, 366 F.2d 306-310, cert. denied, 385 U.S. 1009, 87 S.Ct. 714, 17 L.Ed.2d 546 (1967). <em>See also </em>18 Am.Jur.2d Copyright and Literary Property \u00a7 109; 18 C.J.S. Copyright and Literary Property \u00a7 94(4). All of the authorities agree that to constitute \u201cfair use\u201d the permitted use must be for some legitimate, fair and reasonable purpose. The defendants\u2019 sole purpose was to appropriate the plaintiff\u2019s design either outright or by frivolous variation. The doctrine of fair use has no application to the conduct of the defendants.</p>\n<p id=\"b370-8\">(6) <em>Defendants\u2019 Redesigned Unit.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b370-9\"> The district court found that the defendants complied with plaintiff\u2019s request to cease to manufacture its unit \u201cand redesigned its unit by adding additional intercepting straight lines to the filigree pattern.\u201d The defendants concede, as they must, that the starting point for their \u201credesign\u201d was the plaintiff\u2019s work. Infringement is not confined to exact reproduction but includes colorable alterations made to disguise the piracy. Gross v. Seligman, 2 Cir. 1914, 212 F. 930; 18 C.J.S. Copyright and Literary Property \u00a7 94 c, p. 217. We have no doubt that defendant\u2019s \u201credesign\u201d infringed plaintiff's copyright.</p>\n<p id=\"AYY\">For the reasons stated, the judgment is reversed and the cause remanded for a determination of damages <footnotemark>5</footnotemark> and entry of a judgment enjoining further infringement and awarding damages.</p>\n<p id=\"AJt\">Reversed and remanded.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b368-6\">. <em>See also </em>Day-Brite Lighting, Ine., v.
