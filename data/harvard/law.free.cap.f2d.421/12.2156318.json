Thomas and Jack Arnold Welfeld, attorneys for the receiver and trustee, and Robert B. Chatz and Car-mell and Charone, among the attorneys for the debtor and bankrupt, alone appeal from the order of the district court of March 19, 1969. No appearance or briefs were filed by any appellee. We heard oral argument on behalf of appellants. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b101-7\">In seeking a reversal of the order of the district court on the merits of the controversy concerning the final allowance of attorneys\u2019 fees to appellants, the main thrust of the argument appears to be that the district court applied improper standards of review in remanding the matter to the referee with instructions to reduce the allowances made by him.</p>\n<p id=\"b101-8\">Appellants charge that the district court improperly substituted its judgment for that of the referee without making a finding that the referee\u2019s action was clearly erroneous<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> and constituted an abuse of his allowable discretion. Further, that the district court erred in its reduction order by relying primarily upon statistical averages of administrative expenses.</p>\n<p id=\"b101-9\">At the outset, we note the concise statement of the district judge in his first memorandum order: \u201cAfter a review of the entire file and study of the claims submitted, I consider the allow-anee of $44,510.00 for commissions and fees excessive.\u201d It is plain beyond dispute that the district court concluded the findings of the referee were \u201cclearly erroneous.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b101-14\">Immediately following the foregoing statement, Judge Decker continued: \u201cAlthough I agree that it is unfair to impose an arbitrary ceiling on fees and commissions to be applied in all cases it would appear to me that in an estate of this size, it would be unusual to allocate more than 8% of the total assets to the payment of attorneys\u2019 fees and commissions.\u201d Appellants find this to be offensive to the general postulate that statistical averages offer no proper basis for the conclusion a court may reach in a particular case. See Jacob-owitz v. Double Seven Corporation, 9 Cir., 378 F.2d 405, 408 (1967). However, that is not what the district judge said or intended, nor did the court in <em>Jacob owitz </em>stop there. It concluded: \u201cAttorneys\u2019 fees, like other expenses of administration, vary widely, depending upon the circumstances and must be considered and determined on a case by case basis.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b101-15\">Appellants made the same argument on bankruptcy statistics to the district court as they make to us. In its March 19, 1969 memorandum the district court said: \u201cIn oral argument, counsel apparently misunderstood this court\u2019s earlier reference to the national statistics on the cost of bankruptcies. Since average bankruptcy expenses in the northern district of Illinois are large, the February 10, 1969 memorandum opinion implied that district courts should be par- \u2022 ticularly alert for cases in which the costs are excessive. But, the evaluation of the fees in an individual case should never be influenced by such statistics.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b101-16\">It further appears the district court relied upon the factors found applicable <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"16\">*16</page-number><em>in Jacobowitz, </em>378 F.2d at 408, and followed the economical spirit of the Bankruptcy Act as expressed in 3 Collier on Bankruptcy \u00a7 62.12 [5], p. 1495.</p>\n<p id=\"b102-4\">In addition, the district court stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"Acl\">\u201cWhile the estate required extensive service, the fees initially recommended were based on an excessive per hour charge; similarly, the parties\u2019 enumeration of hours worked was quite generous.\u201d <footnotemark>4</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b102-5\">In passing, we observe that on the settlement as finally approved by the district court the general creditors with claims totalling about $716,000.00 will receive nothing, priority claims will not be paid in full and tax claimants will receive about 14% on their claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b102-6\">Our review of this matter leaves us with the firm conviction that the district court properly applied correct legal standards in reaching its final conclusions and did not err in entering the orders under consideration.</p>\n<p id=\"b102-7\">Finally, for the first time on this appeal, appellants ask us to hold: \u201cThat Rule 25(f) of the Bankruptcy Rules of the United States District Court for the Northern District of Illinois, Eastern Division, be declared to be in conflict with the Bankruptcy Act and the General Orders in Bankruptcy, and that said Rule is, accordingly, invalid.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b102-8\">This matter was not presented to the district court for its consideration. It comes too late to ask or even expect such drastic action on this appeal. We shall not consider it here.</p>\n<p id=\"b102-9\">The order of the district court entered on March 19, 1969, is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"AJP\">Affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b102-10\">APPENDIX</p>\n<p id=\"b102-11\">Rule 25(f), Bankruptcy Rules of the United States District Court for the Northern District of Illinois, provides:</p>\n<p id=\"ar-dedup-0\">(f) Following any hearing on applications for allowances, the referee shall prepare an order on the applications.</p>\n<p id=\"b102-14\">(1) If (a) the total assets realized in the case do not exceed $500 in the case of a non-business petition, or $1,000 in the ease of a commercial or business petition or (b) the total costs of administration do not exceed 25% of the total proceeds realized or $25,-000, whichever is less, the order of the referee shall be effective upon entry, subject only to review pursuant to a petition for review as provided in Section 39(c) of the Bankruptcy Act and Rule 26 hereof.</p>\n<p id=\"b102-15\">(2) All other orders allowing compensation shall be subject to review by and become effective only upon the express approval of a judge of this court. The referee shall file a copy of such orders with the clerk who shall treat the order in the same manner as a Petition for Review and assign it to a judge.</p>\n<p id=\"b102-16\">(a) To facilitate the consideration of the order by the court, the referee shall append a report, setting forth the following information:</p>\n<p id=\"b102-17\">(1) the amount of total proceeds realized; (2) the total costs of administration if the referee\u2019s order becomes effective; (3) the percentage of total proceeds which will be consumed by costs of administration; (4) the amount necessary to pay a dividend to general creditors of 1% ; (5) the amount of proceeds which will remain after payment of these allowances and any other deductions; (6) the amounts and percentages of any prior dividends; (7) the amounts sought by or heretofore paid to the receiver, the trustee and their attorneys; (8) the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"17\">*17</page-number>amounts of compensation previously paid to other persons for services rendered the estate; and (9) any other information which he believes will be of assistance to the court, (b) The referee shall also indicate the reasons for recommending approval of any such order and shall specifically justify any (1) allowance of attorneys fees in excess of 40% of the total costs of administration; (2) allowance to an attorney for a receiver or trustee of more than twice the allowance of his client; or (3) allowance to a receiver or trustee in excess of 90% of the amount allowable under the percentage computation in the Act and which results in a receiver\u2019s fee exceeding 2% or a trustee's fee exceeding 4% of the total costs of administration.</p>\n<p id=\"b103-5\">(e) The automatic briefing provisions of Rule 26E shall not apply to the review of such orders unless ordered by the judge assigned to the matter.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b98-16\">.

The district court in a footnote said: \u201cTo illustrate, the Keferee suggested that the attorneys for the trustee and the receiver be paid about $50 per hour for the full 470 hours requested; but twenty of those hours were attributable to \u2018estimated unrecorded time for conferences, correspondence, telephone calls, meetings with eoun-sel, * * * [and] time required to attend Final Meeting and close estate * * *.\u2019 These lawyers will now receive in excess of $35 per hour for each hour they sought compensation, including the preceding twenty hours.\u201d It appears that other attorneys will receive a lower hourly rate.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
