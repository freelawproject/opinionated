On December 17, 1968, as part of a mass roundup of those indictees, agents of the Los Angeles County Sheriff\u2019s office and the United States District Director of Customs, acting under an arrest warrant issued out of the Southern District Court, at about 6:30 A.M., arrested Freedman at his home in Los Angeles. His house was then searched and the arresting officers seized $13,000 in cash along with note papers and books, all belonging to Freedman.</p>\n<p id=\"b1380-15\">On April 16, 1969, Freedman filed a civil action in the Central District of California against the United States (as well as the Commissioner of Customs, the Sheriff of Los Angeles County, the County of Los Angeles, and the State of California) for the return of the money, note papers and books, under the authority of \u201cRule 41 of the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1380-16\">On April 22, 1969, Freedman also filed in the same district a \u201cMotion to Quash Search Warrant (If Any), To Suppress and Return Items Seized\u201d, purportedly under \u201cRule 41\u201d, F.R.Crim.P. This motion was given the same civil number as the prior complaint (Civil No. 69-715-EC). The motion concerned the same <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1295\">*1295</page-number>$13,000, address books and note papers set forth in that complaint.</p>\n<p id=\"b1381-5\">Thereafter, on April 30, all defendants filed motions to dismiss all the proceedings under Civil No. 69-715-EC, without prejudice to Freedman\u2019s renewing the same in the Southern District.</p>\n<p id=\"b1381-6\">Freedman\u2019s complaint and all motions were briefed by all parties, and without any evidence being adduced \u2014 so far as the record discloses \u2014 on May 6, 1969, the trial court heard argument, and on May 8, relying on United States v. Lester, 21 F.R.D. 30 (D.C.S.D.N.Y.) 1967 and United States v. Spinar, No. 21114-Misc. (C.D.Cal.1969), in the purported exercise of its discretion, deferred the ruling upon Freedman\u2019s motion to the District Court for the Southern District of California, where the indictment against Freedman was then pending. It also ordered the complaint \u201cdismissed without prejudice to plaintiff renewing his motion in the United States District Court for the Southern District of California.\u201d This appeal followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b1381-7\">Presumably, this court has jurisdiction to hear this appeal because Freedman\u2019s \u201ccomplaint\u201d would appear to be solely for the return of property \u2014 property which, per se, has no perceivable relation to the indictment under which Freedman was arrested. <em>Cf. </em>DiBella v. United States, 369 U.S. 121, 131-133, 82 S.Ct. 654, 7 L.Ed.2d 614 (1962).</p>\n<p id=\"b1381-8\">Although Freedman\u2019s stated \u201cissues on appeal\u201d were four in number, only three of which had any possible application to Freedman\u2019s complaint and motion filed in the Central District, the only real issue, as this court sees it, is whether or not there was an abuse of discretion on the part of the District Court in the Central District of California in deferring action on Freedman\u2019s complaint and motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b1381-9\">We say this because on a Rule 41(e) .motion, unquestionably, it is within the discretion of a judge to defer such a motion for subsequent action thereon by the court in the district where the trial is to be had, but a basis must appear in the record supporting such exercise of the first court\u2019s discretionary power.</p>\n<p id=\"b1381-11\">Unfortunately for all parties however, there is nothing in the record before this court either in the pleadings or the affidavits \u2014 there is no record of any testimony being taken at all \u2014 from which this court can determine if there was anything before the Central District Court to show any connection whatsoever between the seized $13,000, note books and documents, and the crime of conspiracy to smuggle, sell and conceal narcotic drugs in violation of U.S.C. \u00a7 174 as charged in the indictment filed in the Southern District of California.</p>\n<p id=\"b1381-12\">This court, therefore, is unable to reach any conclusion on either the question of its jurisdiction to hear this appeal or upon the basic issue of abuse or nonabuse of discretion on the part of the Central District Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b1381-13\">This case is remanded for further procedure in conformance with this opinion, with the suggestion that unless the record in fact already fills the present void, the order of dismissal be set aside and the necessary evidentiary hearings be held.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
