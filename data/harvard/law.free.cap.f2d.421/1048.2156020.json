Robbins Co., Inc. (Robbins, Inc.) is a Pennsylvania general construction corporation, wholly owned by John A. Robbins (Robbins) and his wife. In 1958 Robbins, Inc. formed Jardel Co., Inc. (Jardel), the appellant in this action, as a wholly owned Delaware subsidiary with principal offices in Pennsylvania. Robbins has at all times been the president and controlling figure in both corporations.</p>\n<p id=\"b1135-29\">In 1962 Jardel began the development of Price\u2019s Corner Shopping Center on land it owned in Delaware. Jardel hired Robbins, Inc. as general contractor under a contract that prevented Robbins, Inc., <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1050\">*1050</page-number>and apparently its subcontractors, from securing a lien against Jardel\u2019s property, thus protecting the mortgagee\u2019s interest. Robbins, Inc. in turn subcontracted the plumbing, heating and air-conditioning work to Hirsch, Arkin, Pinehurst, Inc. (Hirsch), a Pennsylvania corporation and appellee in this action. Hirsch agreed to payment on a time and material basis, plus fixed fee.</p>\n<p id=\"b1136-4\">When Hirsch completed its portion of the construction in the fall of 1963, it was still owed approximately $70,000. by Robbins, Inc. Robbins, Inc. refused to pay, demanding that Hirsch rectify certain errors in the construction. Hirsch made several attempts to correct the problems, but, feeling that it could not satisfy Robbins, finally instituted negotiations for a settlement. As a result of these negotiations, on January 7, 1964, Hirsch agreed to accept $36,000. in full payment of Robbins, Inc.\u2019s obligation to it, in return for which Robbins, Inc. released Hirsch of all liability arising or to arise out of its Price\u2019s Corner contract. Jardel was not a party to the release, nor did it participate as a corporation in the negotiations.</p>\n<p id=\"b1136-5\">On July 9, 1965, a substantial portion of one of the buildings in Price\u2019s Corner Shopping Center collapsed. The tenant, Sears, Roebuck and Co., demanded that Jardel rebuild the destroyed portion of the building, which Jardel did as required by the lease. In addition, Sears sued Jardel for $150,000., alleging that its loss of supplies, payroll and other expenses, equipment and profits was due to Jardel\u2019s breach of the construction provisions of the contract under which Sears had agreed to rent the building, as well as to Jar del\u2019s breach of its duty of maintenance and to negligence.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Jardel then sued Hirsch in a third-party action, alleging that \u201cHirsch breached its agreement with the contractor and was negligent\u201d in failing to meet the Sears\u2019 specifications which had been incorporated into Hirsch\u2019s contract with Robbins, Inc. Judgment was asked against Hirsch to cover any judgment that Sears might recover against Jardel.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"AV6K\">Hirsch filed an answer generally denying the allegations of the third-party complaint. After interrogatories were answered, it amended its answer to plead the release between it and Robbins, Inc. as an affirmative defense against Jar-del\u2019s claim \u201cbecause of the relationship between [Jardel] and [Robbins, Inc.]\u201d.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> After depositions were taken, Hirsch moved for summary judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"afo-dedup-0\">The District Court granted the motion, holding<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> that (a) the general release was valid to bar Jardel\u2019s claim if the release bound Jardel as well as Robbins, Inc., and (b) the release bound Jardel because \u201cjustice\u201d required the disregard of the corporate distinction between Jar-del and its parent, Robbins, Inc. The appellant, Jardel, challenges both these findings.</p>\n<p id=\"AWq\">It is undisputed that the parties negotiating the release did not specifically mention or consider the leaking pipe causing the collapse of the Sears' building, nor can it be disputed, for the purposes of a motion for summary judgment, that the pipe was not installed in accordance with the contract or that this <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1051\">*1051</page-number>breach was the cause of the building\u2019s collapse.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Because of these facts, Jardel argues that the release would not be binding even against Robbins, Inc.; it argues that there can never be an enforceable accord and satisfaction to claims that neither party discussed or knew existed at the time of settlement.</p>\n<p id=\"b1137-4\">We do not believe that the law of Pennsylvania <footnotemark>6</footnotemark> goes this far. A general release, by its terms discharging a party of \u201call manner of actions and causes of action, suits, debts, dues, accounts, bonds, covenants, contracts, agreements, judgments, claims and demands whatsoever in law or equity arising or to arise from a contract between the parties,\u201d <footnotemark>7</footnotemark> will ordinarily be enforced absent a showing that the parties did not intend what they wrote:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1137-5\">\u201cIt is well settled that where the terms of a release and the facts and circumstances existing at the time of its execution indicate the parties had in mind a general settlement of accounts, the release will be given effect according to its terms. * * * \u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AAa\">Brill's Estate, 337 Pa. 525, 528, 12 A.2d 50, 52 (1940); <em>see </em>Cockcroft v. Metropolitan Life Ins. Co., 125 Pa.Super. 293, 299, 189 A. 687, 689 (1937) (dictum).</p>\n<p id=\"alj-dedup-0\">The facts leading to the release were related in depositions by two of the three principals of Hirsch, and their statements have not been refuted by Jardel. After completing the plumbing, heating and air-conditioning work at the Price\u2019s Corner project, Hirsch demanded payment from Robbins, Inc. It was met with a series of alleged defects that Hirsch corrected, while denying that the defects were its responsibility. Hirsch again demanded payment, and again it was met with a different list of defects that, once again, it corrected. Finally, upon once again demanding payment and once again being met with a different list of defects, Hirsch asked to negotiate a settlement. Hirsch\u2019s purpose in these negotiations was clear \u2014 it wished to terminate its relationship with the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1052\">*1052</page-number>Robbins organization completely.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> The negotiations took place at the office of Robbins, Inc.\u2019s (and Jardel\u2019s) attorney in Philadelphia; both parties were represented by counsel. Although it does not appear that the principals of Hirsch were directly involved, both Robbins and Mr. Anglin<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> were present for Robbins, Inc. The principals of Hirsch deposed that it was told to their attorney that if Hirsch signed the release, \u201cat no future time would we even hear the name John A. Robbins.\u201d And it was on this basis that they accepted:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1138-4\">\u201cWe wanted to make sure we would not be responsible for anything else when we signed this and accepted the final payment; that we would not be responsible for anything else. ******</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1138-14\">\"[0]ur attorney came out and said, \u2018Will you accept this? This is what they offer.\u2019</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1138-15\">\u201cWe said, \u2018We will accept it on the condition that we are released of all possible claims that come out of it [the Price\u2019s Corner project],\u2019 and he went back in and apparently, obviously they agreed on it and this is what came out of it.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1138-16\">The release, as signed by Robbins and attested to by the secretary of Robbins, Inc., stated that Robbins, Inc. released all its claims against Hirsch in exchange for $34,000.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1138-17\">Jardel now seeks to challenge the release by the allegation that Hirsch \u201cfailed to disclose\u201d the defects of the piping.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> Even if it were true that Hirsch knew of the alleged defects,<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1053\">*1053</page-number>this fact would not defeat the validity of the general release. Under Pennsylvania law, the only question open to challenge is whether the parties intended the release to be honored according to its terms.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> There is ample evidence in the record supporting the conclusion that the parties intended so to honor the release, and there is no evidence to the contrary. Since it was Jardel\u2019s burden to refute the explicit language of the instrument and the corroborating testimony of the Hirsch principals, and since it made no attempt to do so, summary judgment on this issue, against Jardel, was proper. See, <em>e. g., </em>First Nat\u2019l. Bank of Arizona v. Cities Serv. Co., 391 U.S. 253, 289-290, 88 S.Ct. 1575, 20 L.Ed.2d 569 (1968); Doff v. Brunswick Corp., 372 F.2d 801, 805 (9th Cir. 1966), cert. den. 389 U.S. 820, 88 S.Ct. 39, 19 L.Ed.2d 71 (1967); Londeen v. Cordner, 356 F.2d 169, 170 (8th Cir. 1966).</p>\n<p id=\"b1139-5\">Having correctly found the release to cover the claim involved here as to Robbins, Inc., the District Court held the release binding upon Jardel by disregarding the separate entities of the two corporations. While finding that \u201csome efforts are made at the management level to maintain separate entities,\u201d<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> the court held that disregarding the parent-subsidiary structure in this case<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> was \u201cnecessary to do justice and prevent a serious inequity which would otherwise follow.\u201d Jardel argues that the corporate entities should not be disregarded, and that since Jardel was not a party to the release, the release should not bar its present action.</p>\n<p id=\"b1139-12\">Courts of Pennsylvania and Delaware <footnotemark>16</footnotemark> do not easily pierce the corporate veil. In both states the corporate entity is disregarded only in the rarest of cases:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1139-13\">\u201cThe corporate entity or personality will be disregarded only when the entity is used to defeat public convenience, justify wrong, protect fraud or defend crime.\u201d Sams v. Redevelopment Auth., 431 Pa. 240, 244, 244 A.2d 779, 781 (1968).</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1139-14\">\u201c[The corporate entity may be disregarded] only in the interest of justice, when such matters as fraud, contravention of law or contract, public wrong, or equitable considerations among members of the corporation require it, are involved.\u201d Pauley Petroleum, Inc. v. Continental Oil Co., 239 A.2d 629, 633 (Del.1968).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1139-15\">We need not pass on the District Court\u2019s conclusion in this case that the corporate distinction between Jardel and Robbins, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1054\">*1054</page-number>Inc. should be disregarded,<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> since we believe the District Court order must be affirmed for another reason.</p>\n<p id=\"b1140-4\">Even if the corporate veil of Jardel were not disregarded, it cannot entirely separate itself, for the purpose of this suit, from the activities of Robbins, Inc. Jardel\u2019s claim against Hirsch is based upon Hirsch\u2019s duties arising out of Robbins, Inc.\u2019s subcontract with it. In its third-party complaint, Jardel alleged the contract as the basis for its suit: \u201cDefendant is informed and believes and thereon alleges that Hirsch breached its agreement with the contractor [Robbins, Inc.] * * But just as Jardel did not sign the release, so too it was not a signatory to the underlying Robbins, Inc.-Hirsch contract.</p>\n<p id=\"b1140-6\">Because the contract explicitly contemplated the provision of services by Hirsch to Jardel,<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> Jardel has rights under the contract as a third-party creditor. beneficiary. See, <em>e. g., </em>Van Cor, Inc. v. American Cas. Co., 417 Pa. 408, 413, 208 A.2d 267, 269 (1965). Professor Williston defines a third-party creditor beneficiary contract as one in which:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1140-7\">\u201c \u2018no purpose to make a gift appears from the terms of the promise in view of the accompanying circumstances and performance of the promise will satisfy an actual or supposed or asserted duty of the promisee to the beneficiary * * *.\u2019</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1140-16\">\u201cThe promisee\u2019s object in the contract to discharge his debt must always be primarily, and generally solely, to secure his own advantage. He wishes to be relieved from liability, and he exacts a promise to pay the third person only because that is a way of relieving himself.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1140-17\">2 S. Williston, Law of Contracts, \u00a7 361, at 863 (3rd Ed., 1959) [quoting Restatement of Contracts \u00a7 131(1) (b) (1932)] (footnotes omitted).<footnotemark>19</footnotemark> As general contractor, Robbins, Inc. had a duty to provide Jardel with certain specified services; it chose to fulfill part of that duty by subcontracting with Hirsch, Hirsch thereby promising to complete the plumbing, heating and air-conditioning work. Because courts have \u201cinstinctively recogniz[ed] the creditor\u2019s [Jardel\u2019s] interest in such a promise,\u201d Williston, <em>supra, </em>\u00a7 361, at 864-65, the third-party creditor beneficiary can sue the promisor (in this case, Hirsch) directly.<footnotemark>20</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1141-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1055\">*1055</page-number> Once a third-party beneficiary contract has been made however, the beneficiary\u2019s rights are not unlimited.<footnotemark>21</footnotemark> In this case, the terms of \u00a7 143 of the Restatement of Contracts require the conclusion that the release satisfied the promisor\u2019s obligation to the creditor beneficiary (Jardel) as well as to the promisee (Robbins, Inc.):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1141-5\">\u201cA discharge of the promisor by the promisee in a contract or a variation thereof by them is effective against a creditor beneficiary if,</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1141-15\">(a) the creditor beneficiary does not bring suit upon the promise or otherwise materially change his position in reliance thereon before he knows of the discharge or variation, and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1141-16\">(b) the promisee\u2019s action is not a fraud on creditors.\u201d<footnotemark>22</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1141-17\">Professor Williston has adopted the Restatement rule, distinguishing the creditor beneficiary situation from that of the donee beneficiary,<footnotemark>23</footnotemark> reasoning that the creditor beneficiary\u2019s right \u201cis pure<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1056\">*1056</page-number>ly derivative.\u201d Williston, <em>supra, </em>\u00a7 397, at 1074.<footnotemark>24</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1142-4\">This is the rule that Pennsylvania would adopt. Not only do Pennsylvania courts rely upon the Restatement and Professor Williston in establishing the law of third-party beneficiary contracts, <em>e. g., </em>Williams v. Paxson Coal Co., 346 Pa. 468, 470, 471, 472, 31 A.2d 69, 70, 71 (1943),<footnotemark>25</footnotemark> but they apparently have adopted \u00a7 143. In Clardy v. Barco Construction Co., 205 Pa.Super. 218, 224-225, 208 A.2d 793, 796 (1965), the court found that a release did not bar the third-party creditor beneficiary\u2019s claim by reason of \u00a7 143, because the creditor had relied on the contract in completing his duties. In Miller v. Travelers Insurance Co., 143 Pa.Super. 270, 17 A.2d 907 (1941), the court adopted the rule of \u00a7 143, although it actually cited \u00a7 140 <footnotemark>26</footnotemark> as authority. Plaintiff\u2019s husband contracted with his employer to have deductions taken from his wages to support a group life insurance policy that the employer took out with the defendant insurance company. After giving notice to the employees, the employer cancelled the policy. Upon her husband\u2019s death, the plaintiff sued the insurance company as a third-party beneficiary, arguing that the contract between the employer and the insurance company could not have been cancelled without her husband\u2019s consent. The court held:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1142-14\">\u201cThe insured employee or his beneficiary have no greater rights than are provided in the policy, certainly no vested right which would prevent cancellation by mutual agreement between the insurer and the employer, especially where reasonable notice of cancellation is given to the employee. A third party beneficiary in an ordinary contract is subject to the limitation of its terms as he has no greater rights under it than are provided in the contract itself: Restatement of the Law, Contracts, \u00a7 140 * * * \u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1142-16\"><em>Id. </em>at 273, 17 A.2d at <em>908.</em><footnotemark><em>27</em></footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"A0A\">Application of \u00a7 143 to this case bars not only the recovery by Jardel under a contractual theory, but its suit in negligence as well. Under \u00a7 143 the release was also a \u201cvariation,\u201d expressly precluding \u201call, and all manner of, actions and causes of action\u201d arising from the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1057\">*1057</page-number>contract between Robbins and Hirsch. Pennsylvania courts have uniformly honored such contractual provisions where they are entered into by \u201cfree bargaining agents,\u201d Galligan v. Arovitch, 421 Pa. 301, 304, 219 A.2d 463, 465 (1966), holding them to bar recovery in tort as well as contract. <em>E. g., </em>Cannon v. Bresch, 307 Pa. 31, 160 A. 595 (1932), cited with approval, Galligan v. Arovitch, <em>supra; </em>Dohm v. Ponderosa Riding Stables, 41 Pa.Dist. &amp; Co.R.2d 307 (C.P.York 1966); see Mayo v. McCloskey &amp; Co., 200 F.Supp. 7 (E.D.Pa.1961); Shafer v. Reo Motors, 108 F.Supp. 659 (W.D.Pa.1952), aff\u2019d 205 F.2d 685 (3rd Cir. 1953); Charles Lachman Co. v. Hercules Powder Co., 79 F.Supp. 206 (E.D.Pa.1948).</p>\n<p id=\"b1143-5\">Applying the above-stated rule to Jardel would not work an \u201cinjustice,\u201d as Jardel has argued.<footnotemark>28</footnotemark> Should Jardel not have an actionable claim against Hirsch, it can still sue the general contractor, Robbins, Inc., whose obligation to Jardel remained unchanged by the subcontract or the release. See, <em>e. g., </em>National Fire Ins. Co. of Hartford v. Westgate Constr. Co., 227 F.Supp. 835 (D.Del.1964). Indeed, Jardel\u2019s separate existence was justified in part by the necessity of keeping its assets apart from those of its parent, and thus suit against its parent would be more than a futile gesture in this instance.<footnotemark>29</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1143-12\">Accordingly, we hold that Jardel is bound by the release, since the record does not show any material change of position by it in reliance on the promise prior to the variation of the contract by the release.<footnotemark>30</footnotemark> See Morstain v. Kircher, 190 Minn. 78, 250 N.W. 727, 728 (1933),<footnotemark>31</footnotemark> where the court said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1143-13\">\u201c * * * [The plaintiff] paid no consideration for defendant\u2019s agreement to pay the mortgage debt, nor had she in reliance on the assumption contract placed herself in a position from which she could not retreat without loss, [citing \u00a7 143] * * * \u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1143-15\">For the foregoing reasons, the District Court order of December 9, 1968, will be affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1136-6\">. Sears alleged that the collapse was caused by the breaking of a water pipe leading from the building to an outside service island. Specifically, Sears claimed that Jardel, in constructing the building, failed to use thick pipe, soft rather than hard pipe, and \u201csleeving\u201d where the pipe passed through the building\u2019s foundation, all of which were required by contract. Another allegation of breach is not relevant here.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b1136-7\">. Jardel later moved to amend its complaint to include a prayer for $73,000., the cost to Jardel of repairing the building. After ruling that judgment would be entered for Hirsch, the District Court said, \u201c * * * the Court need not consider Jardel\u2019s motion * *</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b1136-14\">. In support of its motion to amend, Hirsch declared that it had learned that Jardel was a wholly-owned subsidiary of Robbins, Inc. only after Jardel\u2019s answers to the interrogatories.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b1136-15\">. The District Court opinion is not reported.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b1137-6\">. Hirsch, in its answer, denied that the pipe was not in conformity with the contract specifications and that any fault on its part caused the collapse.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b1137-7\">. Under Klaxon Co. v. Stentor Mfg. Co., 313 U.S. 487, 61 S.Ct. 1020, 85 L.Ed. 1477 (1941), the conflict of laws principles of the forum state, Delaware, must he applied to this action. Delaware follows a strict jurisdiction selection test, looking to the law of the place of contracting to determine the validity and construction of a contract. Lams v. F. H. Smith Co., 6 W.W.Harr. 477, 483, 36 Del. 477, 483, 178 A. 651, 653, 105 A.L.R. 646 (Super.Ct.1935) ; Pauley Petroleum, Inc. v. Continental Oil Co., 231 A.2d 450, 457 (Del.Ch.1967) ; Harris v. New York Life Ins. Co., 27 Del.Ch. 170, 177, 33 A.2d 154, 157 (1943), followed in Wilmington Trust Co. v. Pennsylvania Co., 40 Del.Ch. 1, 7, 172 A.2d 63, 66 (Del.1961). Also see, e. g., William Whitman Co. v. Universal Oil Prod. Co., 125 F.Supp. 137, 146 (D.Del.1954) ; Restatement of Conflict of Laws, \u00a7 332(f) (1934). In the instant case, the Jardel-Robbins, Inc. contract, the Robbins, Inc.-Hirsch contract, and the release were all executed in Pennsylvania. The Robbins, Inc.-Hirsch contract specifically provided that Pennsylvania law would govern its interpretation. The release made no provision as to applicable law.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b1137-17\">. The release, in pertinent part, provided: \u201cJOHN A.

In its brief before this court, Jardel also argued that it was the intention of the parties to release Hirsch only of those claims specifically enumerated in the list presented by Robbins to Hirsch immediately before the negotiations. We find nothing in the record to support this contention. In fact, the only mention of the list came from Hirsch\u2019s principals, who asserted that at no time did they consider the list a relevant factor:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1138-19\">\u201cQ. Was it your intention that this release would release you only from those claims [contained in the list] or from all claims in contact with the job?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1138-20\">\u201cA. [by Hershmah] At the moment I couldn\u2019t tell you what the claims were. They were very unimportant as far as we were concerned. As I say, we considered them a smoke screen to stop us from what was directly due us. The release was to get us out of the job completely one hundred per cent. It had nothing to do with the claim as far as we were concerned because the claims were unjust to start off with.\u201d</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"12\">\n<p id=\"b1138-21\">. Hirsch argues that the mere \u201caverment\u201d by Robbins in his affidavit of these facts does not create a \u201cgenuine\u201d issue of fact as contemplated by Rule 56(e) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure. Because of our disposition of the underlying dispute, we need not reach this issue.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"13\">\n<p id=\"b1139-6\">. Jardel has cited many cases to support the general proposition that a mistake by one of the parties to a release, such as \u201cto amount to a complete difference between what he supposed he was receiving or giving up and what was in fact received or given up.\u201d 1 C.J.S. Accord and Satisfaction \u00a7 3(e), at p. 471 (1936), makes the release unenforceable. In this case, however, the only evidence is that the parties bargained for and received a general release, covering all claims having arisen or \u201cto arise,\u201d which Robbins, Inc. \u201cever had, now has, or which * * * [it] hereafter can, shall or may have.\u201d By its own terms, therefore, the release covered claims unknown to the parties at the time of execution.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"14\">\n<p id=\"b1139-10\">.

Paxson Coal Co., 346 Pa. 468, 31 A.2d 69 (1943), a promisor agreed to look only to the dividends of three named shareholders for enforcement of a demand note given him in exchange for the transfer of property to the corporation. After the named shareholders sold their entire interest in the corporation, the promisor sued the corporation to enforce the note. The corporation argued that it was obligated to satisfy the note only if it should declare dividends to the original shareholders. Treating the corporation under its new owners as a donee beneficiary and the original shareholders as promisees to the agreement, the court held that because the promisees had made enforcement of the agreement impossible by removing their names from the shareholder list, there was a failure of consideration by the promisees, and thus the corporation, as third-party beneficiary, could not enforce the agreement.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"22\">\n<p id=\"b1141-13\">.

Later, in consideration of a horse worth $200 given him by B, A releases B from his contract. O, after learning of the release, cannot enforce a right against B. * * * \u201d</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"23\">\n<p id=\"b1141-19\">. The distinction between a creditor and donee beneficiary, restricting the right of the promisor in the donee situation to be released, is based on the theory that only the donee beneficiary (and not the promisee) has so substantial an interest in the contract that he can enforce it. See, <em>e. g., </em>Tasin v. Bastress, 284 Pa. 47, 57, 130 A. 417, 421 (1925). Professor Corbin, however, argues that the creditor beneficiary\u2019s rights are similar to those of the donee beneficiary, since the creditor beneficiary is \u201cgiven\u201d the right to look not only to the promisee for enforcement of his contract, for which he had originally bargained, but also to the promisor. \u201cIt seems best, therefore, that the discharge by the promisee should be operative as against the beneficiary only in ease he learns of the discharge before he has assented to the contract or has acted in reliance upon it.\u201d Corbin, <em>supra, </em>note 19, \u00a7 815, at 260; see, <em>e. g., </em>Hughes v.

In a supplemental brief to this court, Jardel claims that it paid Robbins, Inc. in reliance on the Robbins, Inc.-Hirsch contract, so that Robbins, Inc. could pay Hirsch. Such an allegation, if proved, might well be a defense to a claim by Hirsch against Jardel for payments owed to Hirsch by Robbins, Inc. Cf. Clardy v. Barco Constr.
