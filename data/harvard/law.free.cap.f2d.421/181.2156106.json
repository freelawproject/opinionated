Castle, 409 F.2d 1347 (9th Cir. 1969). Both involved rectal searches by customs inspectors. In both, the inspectors learned from reliable informants that the defendant was smuggling in heroin concealed in his rectal cavity. In both, a strip search of the defendant confirmed the informants\u2019 testimony. In both, the body cavity search was conducted by approved medical techniques, in a hospital, with as little pain and as little invasion of human dignity as is possible, given the nature of the search involved. The search was conducted on October 24, 1968.</p>\n<p id=\"b267-23\">We have concluded that under our precedents there was the necessary \u201cclear indication\u201d to justify the search, that the search was properly conducted, and that the conviction must be affirmed. Henderson v. United States, 390 F.2d 805 (9th Cir. 1967); Rivas v. United States, 368 F.2d 703 (9th Cir. 1966); cf. Blackford v. United States, 247 F.2d 745 (9th Cir. 1962).</p>\n<p id=\"b267-24\">Affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
