App. \u00a7 462.</p>\n<p id=\"b783-28\">Powell\u2019s claim to conscientious objector status was considered by his local board and rejected. He was classified 1-A, eligible for military service, and advised of that fact. He was also advised by his local board of his right to appeal his classification, but he failed to avail himself of that right. The District Court held that since Powell did not exhaust the administrative remedies available to him, he could not challenge the board\u2019s classification in the courts. The precise question was under consideration by our <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"698\">*698</page-number>court, en banc, at the time of oral argument of the case at hand. We have now resolved it, and our disposition is fatal to Powell\u2019s appeal. Lockhart v. United States, 420 F.2d 1143 (9th Cir. Dec. 18, 1969) (en banc).</p>\n<p id=\"b784-4\">Affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
