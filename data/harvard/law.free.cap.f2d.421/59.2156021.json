At the lineup appellant, who at that time wore his hair straightened, or \u201cprocessed,\u201d was placed together with five other men, all of whom wore their hair unstraight-ened, or \u201cnatural.\u201d Two witnesses to the robbery, who had previously told police that the culprit had processed hair, identified appellant at the lineup. One of these witnesses testified at the trial to the identification made at the lineup. The other witness made an in-court identification of the defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b146-11\">Appellant argues that the lineup to which he was subjected was so unnecessarily suggestive as to deprive him of due process of law. Stovall v. Denno, 388 U.S. 293, 87 S.Ct. 1967, 18 L.Ed.2d 1199 (1967); <em>cf. </em>People v. Caruso, 68 Cal.2d 183, 65 Cal.Rptr. 336, 436 P.2d 336 (1968). He urges that the trial court erred in admitting testimony as to the identification of defendant at the lineup, and again in permitting an in-court identification of the defendant without determining whether the in-court identification had an origin independent of the illegal lineup. Gilbert v. California, 388 U.S. 263, 87 S.Ct. 1951, 18 L.Ed.2d 1178 (1967). These contentions may well be sound. Foster v. California, 394 U.S. 440 (1969); <em>cf. </em>United States v. Wade, 388 U.S. 218, 232-233, 87 S.Ct. 1926, 18 L.Ed.2d 1149 (1967).</p>\n<p id=\"b146-13\">But in this case we need not reach such questions. We believe that the other evidence against appellant was \u201coverwhelming,\u201d Harrington v. California, 395 U.S. 250, 254, 89 S.Ct. 1726, 23 L.Ed.2d 284 (1969), and we are able to say that the improper identifications were \u201charmless beyond a reasonable doubt,\u201d Chapman v. California, 386 U.S. 18, 24, 87 S.Ct. 824, 17 L.Ed.2d 705 (1967).</p>\n<p id=\"b146-14\">The other evidence included not only an untainted in-court identification and appellant\u2019s own confession, which was properly admitted. It also comprised marked money taken from the credit union, and items stolen from credit union employees, all of which were found on appellant\u2019s person when he was arrested a few blocks away and about half an hour after the robbery. Our result here agrees with those reached by this and other circuits on similar facts. Parker v. United States, 404 F.2d 1193 (9th Cir. 1968) ; Ruona v. United States, 403 F.2d 215 (9th Cir. 1968); Solomon v. United States, 133 U.S.App.D.C. 103, 408 F.2d 1306 (1969); United States v. Satterfield, 410 F.2d 1351 (7th Cir. 1969) .</p>\n<p id=\"b146-17\">Affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
