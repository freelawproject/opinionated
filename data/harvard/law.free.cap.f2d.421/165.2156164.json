E. Grace for the years 1963, 1964 and 1965. Mr. Grace sought re-determination only as to deficiencies arising from the Commissioner\u2019s determination that he (the taxpay<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"166\">*166</page-number>er) was not entitled to compute his tax liability at the rates prescribed for a head of a household. The sole issue for determination by the Tax Court (and by us on appeal) is whether all the requirements of Section 1(b) (2) (A) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1954<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> were satisfied so as to qualify the petitioner-appellant as a \u201chead of a household\u201d during the three years involved. We agree with the Tax Court for reasons well explicated by its decision<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> that the Code provision was not satisfied and affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b252-4\">During the years in question the taxpayer and his wife were divorced. Under the divorce decree, Mrs. Grace had sole custody of a minor child (subject to Grace\u2019s visitation privileges) and the exclusive \u201cuse and benefit\u201d of the family residence until the minor\u2019s 18th birthday, unless she remarried before that time. The taxpayer spent substantial sums on the upkeep of the home and was required to make substantial monthly payments for the upkeep of the child. He was forbidden access to the home. His only other contact with the home was legal title and a vague intent to return to it in the future. He maintained his abode elsewhere in Dallas, the city where all resided.</p>\n<p id=\"b252-5\">The statute and the pertinent regulations<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> were correctly applied by the Commissioner.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> The inequities which the taxpayer strenuously insists result from the language and interpretation of the Code and regulations are matters for the Congress.</p>\n<p id=\"b252-6\">Affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b252-7\">. 26 U.S.C., 1964 Ed., Sec. 1.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b252-8\">. 51.67 P-H T.C., decided January 29, 1969, Docket No. 2302-67.
