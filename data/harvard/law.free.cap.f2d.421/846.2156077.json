Their estimate was that they donated 20% of their gross income. Appellants urge any disclosures of the beneficiaries would interfere with their First and Fifth Amendment rights.</p>\n<p id=\"b932-22\">The Commissioner rejected the taxpayers\u2019 estimates, but allowed them the 10% deduction from .their adjusted gross income. (Sec. 170(a) (1), Int.Rev.Code and Treas.Regs. \u00a7 1.170-l(a) (2))</p>\n<p id=\"b932-23\">The disclosure required is an <em>indirect </em>burden on the exercise of religion, and does not make unlawful the practice of the religion itself. Braunfeld v. Brown, 366 U.S. 599, 607, 81 S.Ct. 1144, 6 L.Ed.2d 563 (1961). Hence the requirement of disclosure is constitutional, and the regulations are reasonable. Lingenfelder v. Commissioner, 38 T.C. 44</p>\n<p id=\"b932-24\">We affirm the decision of the Tax Court.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
