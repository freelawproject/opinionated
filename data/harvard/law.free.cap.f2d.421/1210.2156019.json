C. Monday Tea Company\u2019s (the \u201cCompany\u201d) failure to pay to the Government social security and income taxes withheld from its employees.</p>\n<p id=\"b1299-7\">The Company was organized in 1918 and sold groceries to housewives through door-to-door truck route salesmen. During the latter half of 1958 and thereafter, Robert Monday was president and John Monday was vice president and secretary of the Company, which had 55 employees. John Monday signed and participated in the preparation of the Company\u2019s tax returns.</p>\n<p id=\"b1299-8\">In 1956, the financial condition of the Company began to deteriorate. By 1960, its annual gross income was half the average of the previous five years. It could acquire merchandise for resale from its suppliers only on a C.O.D. basis. During the third and fourth quarters of 1960, the Company paid wages to its officers and employees and deducted federal income and social security taxes from the wages. It failed, however, to pay the Government the withheld taxes of $6,619.53 on October 31, 1960, and $5,764.48 on January 31, 1961, the respective due dates for the quarterly payments. In November or December 1960, it belatedly filed its return for withheld taxes for the third quarter of 1960, and it also failed to file its return for the fourth quarter of 1960 until March 1961. Nevertheless, during those quarters, the Company continued to pay business creditors for antecedent debts and for merchandise purchased C.O.D.</p>\n<p id=\"b1299-15\">In March 1961, Robert Monday borrowed $4,500 from his sister in response to the Internal Revenue Service\u2019s March 1961 demand for payment of withheld social security and income tax moneys of the Company\u2019s employees. John Monday testified that this sum was to cover the withheld taxes for the first quarter of 1961, but Robert Monday testified he thought the payment of $4,500 satisfied all withholding arrearages and made the Company current. In fact, after the $4,500 payment the Company was still delinquent as to the last two quarters of 1960.</p>\n<p id=\"b1299-16\">In May 1961, the Company went into receivership, and it was adjudicated bankrupt in July 1961. In the bankruptcy proceedings, the Government filed claims for various classes of taxes for 1960 and 1961, including the amounts here in issue. These claims were allowed in the sum of $22,494.53, and in September 1963, the Government realized $10,978.25 on them. Although the bankruptcy referee directed that this amount be applied to the most recent claims of the Government, the Government applied $3,167.57 to the Company\u2019s withholding liability for the second quarter of 1960 and only applied $435.84 to the third quarter of 1960, thus leaving unsatisfied most of the Government\u2019s claim for the third and fourth quarters 1960 withholding taxes. The bankruptcy referee also assigned to the Government $7,400 of the Company\u2019s accounts receivable, but the trial did not disclose whether any of these were collected by the Government.</p>\n<p id=\"b1299-17\">In March 1964, the Internal Revenue Service assessed a 100% penalty in the amount of $12,384.01<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> against Robert Monday pursuant to Section 6672 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1954.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> This <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1214\">*1214</page-number>assessment was based on the Company\u2019s failure to pay to the Government the federal income and social security taxes withheld from the wages of its employees during the third and fourth quarters of 1960. In March 1966, Robert Monday paid $1,112 of this assessment under protest. In May 1966, he filed this suit in the district court seeking to recover that amount plus interest and seeking a declaration that the penalty assessment against him was null and void. The Government counterclaimed for $10,836.17, the balance of the assessment, plus interest. The Government also filed a third-party complaint against John Monday seeking to recover $11,948.17, plus interest, pursuant to a November 1964 assessment against him under Section 6672 of the Internal Revenue Code.</p>\n<p id=\"b1300-4\">At the close of the trial, the jury found that Robert and John Monday were under a duty to collect and pay the withheld taxes to the Government for the two quarters in question, pursuant to Sections 6671(b) and 6672 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1954, but that they did not willfully fail to pay the taxes. Therefore, judgment was entered for the Mondays. The district court subsequently denied the Government\u2019s motion for judgment notwithstanding the verdict or for a new trial (294 F. Supp. 1384) and this appeal followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b1300-5\">\n<em>Sufficiency of Evidence to Support Jury\u2019s Finding that Robert Monday Had a Duty to Collect and Pay These Taxes to the Government</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b1300-6\">Under Section 7501 of the Internal Revenue Code, the amount of the withheld income and social security taxes deducted from the Company\u2019s employees\u2019 wages in the third and fourth quarters of 1960 was \u201cto be a special fund in trust for the United States.\u201d See In the Matter of Halo Metal Products, Inc. [United States v. Randall], 419 F.2d 1068 (7th Cir.1969). The \u201cperson\u201d liable for withheld taxes under Section 6672 of the Code includes an \u201cofficer or employee of a corporation, * * * who as such officer, * * * is under a duty\u201d to see that the funds are remitted to the Government. 26 U.S.C. \u00a7 6671(b). The jury specially found that both Robert and John Monday had a duty to collect and pay the Government taxes deducted in the third and fourth quarters of 1960. Robert Monday contends that as to him, this finding cannot be sustained. Our examination of the record reveals sufficient support for the special verdict.</p>\n<p id=\"b1300-9\">Corporate office does not, <em>per se, </em>impose the duty to collect, account for and pay over the withheld taxes. On the other hand, an officer may have such a duty even though he is not the disbursing officer. Cf. Bloom v. United States, 272 F.2d 215 (9th Cir.1959), certiorari denied, 363 U.S. 803, 80 S.Ct. 1236, 4 L.Ed.2d 1146. The existence of the same duty and concomitant liability in another official likewise has no effect on the taxpayer\u2019s responsibility. Datlof v. United States, 252 F.Supp. 11, 33 (E.D.Pa.1966), affirmed, 370 F.2d 655 (3d Cir.1966), certiorari denied, 387 U.S. 906, 87 S.Ct. 1688, 18 L.Ed.2d 624. Liability attaches to those with power and responsibility within the corporate structure for seeing that the taxes withheld from various sources are remitted to the Government Scott v. United States, 354 F.2d 292, 296, 173 Ct.Cl. 650 (1965); see also Gefen v. United States, 400 F.2d 476, 482 (5th Cir.1968), certiorari denied, 393 U.S. 1119, 89 S.Ct. 990, 22 L.Ed.2d 123. This duty is generally found in high corporate officials <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1215\">*1215</page-number>charged with general control over corporate business affairs who participate in decisions concerning payment of creditors and disbursal of funds. Cf., e. <em>g., </em>Bloom v. United States, 272 F.2d 215 (9th Cir.1959), certiorari denied, 363 U. S. 803, 80 S.Ct. 1236, 4 L.Ed.2d 1146; Hewitt v. United States, 377 F.2d 921, 924 (5th Cir.1967); Scott v. United States, 354 F.2d 292, 173 Ct.Cl. 650 (1965); Newsome v. United States, 301 F.Supp. 757 (S.D.Texas 1968); see generally, 8A Mertens, Law of Federal Income Taxation, \u00a7 47A.25a, pp. 126-128 (1964).</p>\n<p id=\"b1301-5\">Under the corporate by-laws, Robert Monday\u2019s duties as president included \u201cgeneral supervision of the affairs of the corporation.\u201d Through his own stock ownership and through a voting trust, he controlled the Company. He and his brother signed most of the corporate checks, and both of them conferred from time to time as to what creditors should be paid. They sought payment from Robert, not John. Robert Monday had signed corporate checks payable to the Government with respect to prior withholding taxes. In John\u2019s absence, Robert performed John\u2019s duties. Robert also admitted having read a report prepared by the Company\u2019s certified public accountant informing him of the then overdue taxes. Regardless of the purchasing and promotional activities of Robert, there was ample evidence to sustain the jury\u2019s conclusion on this point. Cf. Kelly v. Lethert, 362 F.2d 629, 634 (8th Cir.1966).</p>\n<p id=\"b1301-6\">\n<em>Correctness of Willfulness Instruction</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b1301-7\">Over the objection of the Government, the district court gave the following instruction as to the meaning of the word \u201cwillful\u201d in Section 6672 (note 3 <em>su</em>pra):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1301-8\">\u201cYou are instructed that for the plaintiff\u2019s and/or third-party defendant\u2019s failure to pay over the taxes withheld to have been willful it is not necessary that there have been present any intent to defraud or to deprive the United States of taxes, nor is it necessary that bad motives or wicked design be shown.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1301-11\">\u201cThe term \u2018willful\u2019 means a voluntary, conscious and intentional act, done <em>without reasonable cause, </em>to prefer other creditors of the corporation over the government.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1301-12\">\u201cMere negligence, that is, failure to exercise ordinary care, in respect to collecting, truthfully accounting for or paying over the taxes is not enough to establish willfulness.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1301-13\">\u201cA \u2018willful\u2019 act may also be described as one done intentionally, knowingly, and purposely, <em>without justifiable excuse, </em>as distinguished from an act done carelessly, thoughtlessly, heedlessly, or inadvertently.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1301-14\">\u201cA \u2018willful\u2019 act differs essentially from a \u2018negligent\u2019 act. The former, that is \u2018willful,\u2019 is positive; and the latter, that is \u2018negligence,\u2019 is negative.\u201d (Emphasis supplied.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1301-15\">The Government asserts that it was improper for the district court to permit the jury to excuse acts done with \u201creasonable cause\u201d or \u201cjustifiable excuse.\u201d We agree that it was improper to include these terms in the instruction.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1301-16\">The precise content to be given the concept of \u201cwillfulness\u201d varies according to the legal context in which it appears. In criminal statutes, \u201cwillfulness\u201d generally requires bad purpose or the absence of any justifiable excuse. United States v. Murdock, 290 U.S. 389, 394, 54 S.Ct. 223, 78 L.Ed. 381. In civil actions, however, these elements need not be present. Rather, willful conduct denotes intentional, knowing and voluntary acts. It may also indicate a reckless disregard for obvious or known risks.</p>\n<p id=\"b1302-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1216\">*1216</page-number>Despite its denomination as a \u201cpenalty\u201d assessment, the statutory liability imposed by Section 6672 is essentially civil in nature. Cash v. Campbell, 346 F.2d 670, 673 (5th Cir.1965). Its basic purpose is the protection of governmental revenue. Botta v. Scanlon, 314 F.2d 392, 393 (2d Cir.1963); Spivak v. United States, 370 F.2d 612, 616 (2d Cir.1967), certiorari denied, 387 U.S. 908, 87 S.Ct. 1690, 18 L.Ed.2d 625. It provides a remedy to prevent the unnecessary loss of tax funds by permitting the \u201ctaxing authority to reach those responsible for the corporation\u2019s failure to pay the taxes which are owing.\u201d United States v. Graham, 309 F.2d 210, 212 (9th Cir.1962); White v. United States, 372 F.2d 513, 516, 178 Ct.Cl. 765 (1967). In light of this purpose, we agree with those courts which have defined willful action under Section 6672 as referring to voluntary, conscious and intentional \u2014as opposed to accidental \u2014 decisions not to remit funds properly withheld to the Government. Spivak v. United States, 370 F.2d 612, 615 (2d Cir.1967), certiorari denied, 387 U.S. 908, 87 S.Ct. 1690, 18 L.Ed.2d 625; Cross v. United States, 311 F.2d 90, 94 (4th Cir.1962); Hewitt v. United States, 377 F.2d 921, 924, 22 A.L.R.3d 1 (5th Cir.1967) ; Flan v. United States, 326 F.2d 356, 358 (7th Cir.1964); Bloom v. United States, 272 F.2d 215, 223 (9th Cir.1959), certiorari denied, 363 U.S. 803, 80 S.Ct. 1236, 4 L.Ed.2d 1146; Scott v. United States, 354 F.2d 292, 295, 173 Ct.Cl. 650 (1965). Liability does not depend upon the presence of bad motive or the specific intent to defraud the Government or deprive it of revenue. White v. United States, 372 F.2d 513, 521, 178 Ct.Cl. 765 (1967).</p>\n<p id=\"b1302-4\">The standard of willfulness should not be construed to include lack of \u201creasonable cause\u201d or \u201cjustifiable excuse.\u201d These concepts tend to evoke notions of evil motive or bad purpose which properly play no part in the civil definition of willfulness. Cf. Bloom v. United States, 272 F.2d 215, 223-224 (9th Cir.1959), certiorari denied, 363 U. S. 803, 80 S.Ct. 1236, 4 L.Ed.2d 1146; accord, Flan v. United States, 326 F.2d 356, 358 (7th Cir.1964); White v. United States, 372 F.2d 513, 178 Ct.Cl. 765 (1967). In addition, \u201creasonable cause\u201d and \u201cjustifiable excuse\u201d invite consideration of such misleading and improper factors as the financial condition of the business or the demands of creditors. Cf. United States v. Hill, 368 F.2d 617, 621 (5th Cir.1966); United States v. Strebler, 313 F.2d 402, 404 (8th Cir. 1963); Frazier v. United States, 304 F.2d 528, 529-530 (5th Cir.1962). The defenses countenanced by the district court\u2019s use of \u201creasonable cause\u201d and \u201cjustifiable excuse\u201d are inconsistent with the purposes of Congress to protect the sources of revenue by permitting recovery from those individuals charged with the responsibility of transferring withheld funds to the Government.,</p>\n<p id=\"b1302-6\">We therefore hold that the instruction on \u201creasonable cause\u201d and \u201cjustifiable excuse\u201d was an impermissible addition to the jury\u2019s instructions. The district court should have adopted the following part of the Government\u2019s proferred instruction on willfulness:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1302-7\">\u201cYou are instructed that for the plaintiff\u2019s and/or third-party defendant\u2019s failure to pay over the taxes withheld to have been willful it is not necessary that there have been present any intent to defraud or to deprive the United States of taxes; nor is it necessary that bad motives or wicked design be shown.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1302-8\">\u201cAn act is willful if it is voluntary, conscious, and intentional. If you find that plaintiff and/or third-party defendant knowingly used available funds to prefer other creditors over the United States then you must find that he acted willfully.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1302-9\">Despite the erroneous instruction given, we must still consider whether there is sufficient evidence against John and Robert Monday to require a directed verdict in favor of the Government against either brother rather than a new trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b1303-4\">\n<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1217\">*1217</page-number>\n<em>Evidence of John Monday\u2019s Willfulness</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b1303-5\">John Monday was the vice president and secretary and a director of the Company. It is uncontested that he was in charge of corporate tax matters. Before their due dates, he and the Company\u2019s bookkeeper prepared the quarterly returns in issue, and John Monday signed them as vice president. Each was filed belatedly and without payment although appropriate checks had evidently been prepared. In his testimony, he stated that during the third and fourth quarters of 1960, he knew these withholding taxes were due and owing and nevertheless wrote checks to other creditors and suppliers of the corporation instead of paying the United States out of otherwise available funds. This preference of others over the Government was clearly an intentional act requiring a verdict in favor of the Government against John Monday since a contrary verdict could never stand.</p>\n<p id=\"b1303-6\">\n<em>Evidence of Robert Monday\u2019s Willfulness</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b1303-7\">Deane Nichol, the certified public accountant employed by the Company in the fall of 1960, testified that he pointed out to Robert in November 1960 that the Company had not paid taxes withheld from its employees and told him of the possible penalties. Robert admitted that he read Deane Nichol\u2019s report which reflected the delinquent taxes. Robert conferred with his brother John as to what creditors should be paid and signed cheeks covering previous trust tax payments to the Government. Robert knew the Company withheld taxes and was supposed to forward them to the Government. He performed John\u2019s functions when John was absent. Since John admitted the $4,500 March 1961 payment was only for the first quarter of 1961, the jury could disbelieve Robert\u2019s statement that he thought it covered the delinquent quarters as well. On the other hand, Robert testified that he did not know of the tax arrearage until March 1961. Because of conflicts in the evidence, there must be a remand with respect to Robert, so that a properly instructed jury can resolve the question of his willfulness.</p>\n<p id=\"b1303-11\">\n<em>Meetings with the Internal Revenue Service</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b1303-12\">The chief defense presented by the Monday brothers revolves around their meetings with Edward Pietrzak, collection department supervisor of the Internal Revenue Service in Milwaukee, Wisconsin. The court below felt that the content of these meetings was relevant to the determination of willfulness. In addition, plaintiff Robert W. Monday contends that as a result of these meetings, the government is estopped to seek recovery from the Company\u2019s officers under Section 6672. We disagree with both propositions.</p>\n<p id=\"b1303-13\">The evidence of the meetings was directed to the establishment of a \u201creasonable cause\u201d or \u201cjustifiable excuse\u201d for the parties\u2019 failure to perform their duties with respect to the withholding taxes.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> It was intended to negate any inference of bad faith or improper motivation by establishing reasonable reliance upon the representation that the moneys need not be collected and remitted. Since, as seen, the Mondays are foreclosed from relying upon \u201creasonable cause\u201d or \u201cjustifiable excuse\u201d as an element of willfulness under this Section, they may find no solace in the meetings in this respect.</p>\n<p id=\"b1303-14\">Nor does the testimony of the content of the meetings support any claim that the Government should be estopped because of the statements made by Pie-trzak. The first meeting of the Government\u2019s agent and the Company\u2019s representatives took place on November 30, 1960. Since this meeting occurred one month after the due date for the third quarter taxes, it furnished no excuse for the previous failure to collect and remit <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1218\">*1218</page-number>the funds. Neither at that time nor at the subsequent meeting in March 1961, did Pietrzak give the Company or its individual officers any indication that they were relieved of their responsibilities under the various Sections of the Code. At the November meeting, moreover, Pietrzak specifically instructed the Company to keep current, thus precluding any claim that its subsequent failure to remit the fourth quarter taxes resulted from reliance upon his authorization of continued business. In any event, the corporate and individual liabilities under Section 6672 are separate and distinct. Cf. Datlof v. United States, 370 F.2d 655, 656 (3d Cir.1966), certiorari denied, 387 U.S. 906, 87 S.Ct. 1688, 18 L.Ed.2d 624. The taxpayers have failed to disclose any.action by the Government upon which they could reasonably have relied as the grounds for their failure to collect and remit any of the taxes withheld from their employees. Cf. Spivak v. United States, 370 F.2d 612, 615 (2d Cir.1967), certiorari denied, 387 U.S. 908, 87 S.Ct. 1690, 18 L.Ed.2d 625.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1304-4\">\n<em>Bankruptcy Proceedings</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b1304-5\">Finally, the Mondays argue that the assessments against\u201d them are improper because the Internal Revenue Service did not apply the $10,978.24 bankruptcy proceeds to the Government\u2019s most recent tax claims, as directed by the bankruptcy referee. As the testimony shows, the Internal Revenue Service deliberately ignored the bankruptcy referee\u2019s direction and applied these proceeds to earlier periods for the \u201cbest benefit of the government,\u201d thus preserving the claims against Robert and John Monday individually for the quarters in question under Section 6672.</p>\n<p id=\"b1304-9\">As previously noted, the personal liability imposed upon the individual taxpayer by Section 6672 is separate and distinct from that imposed upon the employer under Section 3403 of the Code. Datlof v. United States, 370 F.2d 655, 656 (3d Cir.1966), certiorari denied, 387 U.S. 906, 87 S.Ct. 1688, 18 L.Ed.2d 624. It is not dependent upon rules governing the liability of the employer. Cf. Rosenberg v. United States, 327 F.2d 362 (2d Cir.1964); Kelly v. Lethert, 362 F.2d 629 (8th Cir.1966). In Spivak v. United States, 370 F.2d 612 (2d Cir.1967), certiorari denied, 387 U.S. 908, 87 S.Ct. 1690, 18 L.Ed.2d 625, the court rejected a similar contention that the government\u2019s compromise of its claim for taxes against a bankrupt corporation which expressly provided that the government would assert no further claim against the corporation for withholding taxes, should bar the subsequent recovery from responsible officers under Section 6672.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> Here too, the separate nature of the tax liabilities imposed upon the Mondays precludes their assertion of any satisfaction of the Company\u2019s liability for withholding taxes as a satisfaction of their individual liability under Section 6672.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1305-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1219\">*1219</page-number>For the foregoing reasons, the judgment of the district court is reversed with instructions to enter judgment for the United States against John A. Monday and to grant a new trial to Robert Monday to determine, upon proper instructions to the jury, the question of his willfulness.</p>\n<p id=\"b1305-5\">Reversed and remanded.</p>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b1299-12\">.

In addition, the Government argued that even if some \u201creasonable cause\u201d instruction were proper, the district court erroneously failed to explain its meaning and thereby permitted the jury to conclude that the financial straits of the corporation constituted such a reasonable cause.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b1303-8\">.

Because Pietrzak did not forgive the delinquent taxes and insisted that the Company henceforth keep current, there is no need to enter the troubled arena of when the doctrine of estoppel is applicable to the Government.

In <em>Spivak </em>the compromise of the bankrupt corporation\u2019s debt specifically provided that it should not prejudice further proceedings against corporate officers for penalties such as that created by Section 6672. While the referee\u2019s order in this case cannot satisfy or remove the officers\u2019 liability, it might nevertheless bar action against the Mondays were they to show that an administrative practice existed, such as referred to in <em>Spivak, </em>that the Government would not press its claim against the responsible officers where the corporate obligation has been met. Cf. 370 F.2d at 615. Since the parties have not argued this question and there is no evidence at this time of any such administrative practice, we do not express any opinion on this point.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b1304-11\">. For this reason, absent any showing of an administrative practice mentioned in note 7, <em>supra, </em>the district court need not consider the question of the propriety of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1219\">*1219</page-number>the Commissioner\u2019s computations of the amount of taxpayers\u2019 liability insofar as the Government may have collected any of the $7,400 of accounts receivable assigned to the Government by the bankruptcy referee.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
