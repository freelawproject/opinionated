For that matter, the actions of the judge, when viewed in the light of a courtroom atmosphere, were well within the bounds of judicial propriety.</p>\n<p id=\"b268-22\">Affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b268-30\">. 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2113(a) (b).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
