See Murphy v. Houma Well Service, 5 Cir., 1969, 409 F.2d 804, Part I; and Huth v. Southern Pacific Company, 5 Cir., 1969, 417 F.2d 526, Part I.</p>\n<p id=\"b256-14\">James P. Caswell sued the Manhattan Fire and Marine Insurance Company for a libel allegedly resulting from the publication of a report by the National Board of Fire Underwriters, now the American Insurance Association.</p>\n<p id=\"b256-15\">This is the second appeal of this case, see Caswell v. Manhattan Fire &amp; Marine Insurance Company, 5 Cir., 1968, 399 F.2d 417. The pertinent facts are there set forth.</p>\n<p id=\"b256-17\">The case was tried on its merits on May 7, 1969. The Court directed a verdict for the defendant. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b256-18\">We are compelled to agree with the District Court that there was no evidence from which a jury might have found that Manhattan, or its agents, caused or were responsible for the publication of the allegedly libelous report.</p>\n<p id=\"b256-19\">Additionally, we are convinced that the reports were privileged when judged by the standards discussed in our prior opinion, 399 F.2d 421, 422.</p>\n<p id=\"b256-20\">Therefore the judgment of the District Court is</p>\n<p id=\"b256-21\">Affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
