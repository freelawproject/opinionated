Appellee was incarcerated pursuant to a sentence imposed by the state court after entry of a plea of guilty to second-degree (nighttime) burglary. The premise of the trial court\u2019s order was a finding that appellee had not voluntarily entered his plea with an understanding of the nature of the charge. <em>See </em>Berryhill v. Page, 10 Cir., 349 F.2d 984. Appellant contends that in so doing the trial court erroneously applied the standard of Fed.R.Crim.P. 11 retroactively to state court procedures. From our examination of the record and the trial court\u2019s memorandum decision, 307 F.Supp. 936, we conclude that the contention is without merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b1482-9\">Under the penal code of Utah applicable at the time appellee entered his plea (1961), second-degree (nighttime) burglary was punishable by an indeterminate sentence of one to twenty years; third-degree (daytime) burglary carried an indeterminate sentence of from six months to three years. Utah Code Ann. \u00a7\u00a7 76-9-4, -6 (1953). Nighttime was defined as the \u201cperiod of time between sunset and sunrise.\u201d Utah Code Ann. \u00a7 76-9-7 (1953). As appears from the colloquy between the sentencing court and appellee, appearing without counsel,. a clear explanation of the difference between these two offenses was essential to an understanding of the exact nature of the charge because of the peculiar circumstances there revealed. The appellee indicated that the offense occurred at about 5:30 a.m., in the \u201cearly morning\u201d when the \u201csun was just coming up.\u201d The full significance of these statements is considered at length in the trial court\u2019s opinion together with other aspects of the case. We affirm, essentially for the reasons stated in that opinion.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
