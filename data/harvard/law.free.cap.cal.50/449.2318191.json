The larceny charged was stealing a picture by Bosenthal called \u201cElaine.\u201d Two of the persons indicted for the offense were examined, and one of them, Wallace, testified that he and defendant agreed to take part in the burglary and larceny, and waited on the corner of the street to see if the police came along, and to notify the others who had raised the window and gone into the building to get the picture. Police-officers Marsh and Williams testified that they passed Snow <em>&amp; </em>May\u2019s picture-gallery about 12 o\u2019clock at night, and saw two men standing there, and one of them, Williams, identified the defendant as being one of the persons.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b463-14\">The defendant was convicted, and appealed.</summary>\n<p data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b463-15\"><em>C.

It is sufficient if it tends to connect the defendant with the commission of the offense.</p>\n<p id=\"b464-8\">There was certainly evidence tending to show that the building was entered and the larceny committed in the night-time, and some evidence tending to connect the defendant with the commission of the crime.</p>\n<p id=\"b464-9\">The counsel for defendant asked the court to give the jury <em>eighty-one </em>specific instructions, many of which were refused.

The instructions given seem to have fairly and fully explained the law applicable to the questions actually tried, and which the jury were called upon to determine.</p>\n<p id=\"b464-10\">Judgment and order affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
