The said defendant appeared by his attorneys. A jury of twelve persons was regularly impaneled and sworn to try said cause. Witnesses on the part of the defendant were sworn and examined.

It is not claimed that it is, except by inference sought to be drawn from the recitals which precede the judgment as entered by the clerk. These, so far as supposed to be material, are as follows: \u201cThis cause came on regularly for trial. The said defendant appeared by his attorneys.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b469-14\">There being no affirmative recital that <em>the plaintiff </em>appeared at the trial, it is now claimed that the fact that he did <em>not </em>appear is thereby made manifest.</p>\n<p id=\"b469-15\">But this position cannot be maintained. If <em>cdl </em>the recitals by which the judgment is preceded had been omitted from the record, such\" omission would not have affected the validity of the judgment in any respect.</p>\n<p id=\"b469-16\">Judgment affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
