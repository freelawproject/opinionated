ISTo evidence whatever, other than the recitals found in the deeds, was given or offered for the purpose of showing that the Petaluma Water Company was a corporation, or had any corporate existence. These recitals, found only in the deeds through which the plaintiff claimed, were not admis<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"505\">*505</page-number>sible as evidence as against the defendant to establish the corporate existence of the Petaluma Company.
