The plaintiff, on the 23d of June, asked the court to make findings of fact in the case. The defendant objected, and asked for judgment on the findings. The court, on the next day, made findings, in which it found that the taking was necessary for a public use, and rendered judgment condemning a part of the land sought in the complaint.
