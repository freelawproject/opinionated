The latter company was the successor in interest of the Central Pacific, of the lands granted to the latter company between the Bay of San Francisco and Sacramento. The plaintiffs introduced in evidence a patent from the United States to the Western Pacific Company, dated May 31, 1870, embracing the demanded premises, and then deraigned title from the latter company. Defendant introduced evidence tending to show that her husband, Abel Fairchild, entered on the land as a pre-emptor, in 1883, and died in 1865, and that she was his heir, and continued to live on the land after his death. She then proved that she filed her declaratory statement on the 4th day of October, 1870, and that the United States issued a patent to the \u201cheirs of Abel Fairchild\u201d on the 16th day of April, 1872.

The act being within the scope of the Commissioner\u2019s powers as a subordinate officer, it will be assumed that the withdrawal was made by direction of the Secretary of the Interior, and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"363\">*363</page-number>the withdrawal is itself a recognition of the fact that the map was filed in the office of the Secretary.
