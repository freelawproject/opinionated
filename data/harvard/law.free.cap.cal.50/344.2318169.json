Various reasons were assigned to show why the board had no power to make the second submission, or to issue the bonds on the second vote. An answer was filed. The plaintiff obtained a preliminary injunction on the pleadings and on affidavits. The defendant appealed from the order granting the preliminary injunction.</summary>\n<p data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b359-5\"><em>H. H. Haight and C. B.
