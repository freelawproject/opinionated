It now ap- ' pears, however, that by reason of an existing stipulation of the Attorney-General, extending the time, the prisoners\u2019 counsel was not actually in default when the cause was decided. Counsel is guilty of an irregularity in withholding such a stipulation from the file, thereby unnecessarily increasing our labors, as well as delaying the ultimate determination of the cause. Under the circumstances, however, and owing to the importance of the case to the prisoners, we will set aside the judgment and restore the cause to the calendar for argument at the January term.</p>\n<p id=\"b483-7\">So ordered.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
