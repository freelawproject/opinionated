The words in italics were afterwards interpolated, by being written on the margin of the indictment, opposite the first words of lines, being the same words they precede:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b461-13\">\u201cH. H. Granice is accused by the grand jury of the county of Merced, State of California, of the <em>crime </em>of murder, a felony committed as follows: The said H. H. Gran-ice, on or about the 7th day of December, eighteen hundred and seventy-four, at the town of Merced, in the county of Merced, in the State of California, then and there being, did, then and there, with a pistol loaded with powder and leaden ball, <em>maliciously, </em>feloniously, and unlawfully shoot and kill <em>and murder one </em>Edward Madden, a human being, etc.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b461-14\">The defendant pleaded not guilty. On the trial, after the prosecution had rested, the' defendant moved to strike out those portions of the indictment which had been interpolated, and, in support of his motion, offered to prove the fact of the interpolations. The counsel for the prosecution opposed the motion, because, as he stated, he had informed the defendant\u2019s counsel of the interpolation before he had pleaded, and had offered to make an affidavit to that effect. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"448\">*448</page-number>The court refused to hear evidence of the interpolation, and denied the motion. The defendant was convicted of murder in the first degree, and sentenced to imprisonment for life. The defendant appealed.</summary>\n<p data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b462-6\"><em>D.

Objection to such proof was made by the prosecution, on the ground that the defendant\u2019s attorney had been informed by one of the attorneys for the prosecution, before the defendant pleaded to the indictment, \u201cthat the indictment had been tampered with after it had been found by the grand jury;\u201d and \u201cthat there were plenty of witnesses to prove that it had been tampered -with.\u201d The court refused to permit the defendant to make the proof. It is the duty of either party to bring to the attention of the court any alteration of the record of a pending proceeding, promptly, and at the earliest opportunity at which it can be done, after the alteration has come to his knowledge. In this case, that duty was as incumbent on the prosecution as on the defendant. Although the defendant did not promptly move in the matter, he is not thereby precluded from showing that alterations have been made in the indictment. The indictment, as it stood before the alleged alterations were made, only <em>charged the </em>defendant with the crime ofmanslaughter, but, as altered, it charged him with the crime of murder. The court, under that indictment, had no jurisdiction to try him for any crime other than such as was charged in the indictment when it was filed by the grand jury. Consent on the part of the defendant, whether given directly or inferred <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"449\">*449</page-number>from his acts or omissions, cannot confer jurisdiction upon the court to try the defendant for any other crime than such as is charged in the indictment, as found and returned by the grand jury.</p>\n<p id=\"b463-6\">Judgment and order reversed, and cause remanded for a new trial.
