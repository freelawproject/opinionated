S. Brooks. That on the 10th day of May, 1871, defendant Hamilton made and delivered to the plaintiff and defendant Woods, a deed, whereby he bargained, sold, and conveyed to the plaintiff and said Woods, an undivided two-thirds of the rancho; that on the 27th day of May, 1871, Morales and her husband executed a conveyance of the rancho, in which, at the plaintiff\u2019s request, defendant Hamilton was the sole grantee; that on the 29th of May, 1871, defendant Hamilton' proposed that the title to the whole rancho should be vested in him and the plaintiff, an undivided- one-half each, and that they then join in signing an agreement with defendant Woods, and that Hamilton then proposed that the deed he had made on the 10th of May should be delivered up to him, and it was so delivered, and a deed was drawn up from the plaintiff and Woods to Hamilton, but it was not delivered because the agreement with Woods was not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"424\">*424</page-number>signed; that the deed to Hamilton, of the 10th of May, had not been recorded, and Hamilton having thus obtained possession of it, executed and delivered to defendant Bryant a deed of the whole rancho, without any consideration, and that Bryant had notice of all the facts; that Hamilton then refused to recognize the plaintiff as having any interest in the land, and he and Bryant claimed to be the owners thereof, and had made some agreement in relation thereto with the other defendants; that Woods had conveyed to one Hamil, and Hamil to the plaintiff, the undivided one-third of Woods; that by the acts of the defendants in ignoring the rights of the plaintiff, and setting up title adverse to him, they had forfeited all right to retain the benefits and advantages which they' were to reap from their contract, and the plaintiff had a right to rescind, and had rescinded the same, and offered to return to Hamilton the money he paid. There was a prayer that the defendants unite in a conveyance to the plaintiff. There was a trial, and the court rendered judgment for the defendants. The plaintiff appealed from the judgment and from an order denying a new trial.</summary>\n<p data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b438-6\"><em>Daingerfield &amp; Olney, </em>for the Appellant.</p>\n<p data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b438-7\"><em>Sharp &amp; Lloyd, </em>for the Respondents.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b438-8\">By the Court ;</author>\n<p id=\"b438-9\">The purpose of the complaint is to obtain a decree that the title, which the defendant Hamilton originally obtained by the deed of Anna Morales and her husband, be conveyed to and vested in the plaintiff.</p>\n<p id=\"b438-10\">1. As to an undivided two-thirds of the premises claimed under the deed of May 10, 1871, it is apparent that no ground for equitable relief is disclosed in the complaint, because it is there alleged that the defendant Hamilton, on that day, delivered to the plaintiff a deed \u201cwhereby he bar- ' gained, sold, and conveyed to the plaintiff * * * one undivided two-thirds of the said rancho. \u201d The operation of such a deed would be to vest in the plaintiff all the in<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"425\">*425</page-number>terest which the defendant Hamilton, the grantor therein, subsequently acquired by the deed of Anna Morales, delivered to him on the 27th day of May, 1871, and the plaintiff, in this aspect of the case, does not need the aid of a court of equity, but may recover the premises in an action of ejectment.</p>\n<p id=\"b439-6\">2. Nor do we discover any ground stated in the complaint upon which the plaintiff can maintain his claim, that the defendant Hamilton should convey to him the other undivided one-third of the premises. Assuming the fact to be as the plaintiff states it, that the defendant Hamilton has ignored the supposed rights of the plaintiff, and set up an adverse title to the whole of the premises, and conceding, too, that so long as the rights of Hamilton rested in executory agreement merely, those rights might have been lost by his repudiation of the contract under which they are alleged to have been held, it is plain that when, as here, the title of Hamilton to the undivided third is a legal title, vested in him by proper deed, such acts done on his part against the plaintiff would not entitle the latter to divest him of the title, or demand that it be surrendered to the plaintiff.</p>\n<p id=\"b439-7\">Judgment and order affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
