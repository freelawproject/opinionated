It is admitted that the original articles of association forming a railroad company are to be filed with the Secretary of State, and that a certified copy of such original articles is made evidence by statute. (Act 1861, p. 607.) But, it is urged, inasmuch as by section forty of the statute last referred to, it is provided \u201c when the consolidation and amalgamation (of two railroad companies) are completed, a copy of the new articles of association shall be filed in the office of the Secretary of State;\u201d that a certified copy of the copy filed with that officer is no evidence. We are clear, however, on reading the whole statute, that it was intended that the articles of the newly formed company filed with the Secretary of State should constitute an original, and that certified copies thereof should be received as evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b363-6\">The Commissioner of the General Land Office, and the Secretary of the Interior, had power to set aside the action of the local land office. <em>(Hestres </em>v. <em>Brennan, </em>ante, p. 211.)</p>\n<p id=\"b363-7\">Judgment and order affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
