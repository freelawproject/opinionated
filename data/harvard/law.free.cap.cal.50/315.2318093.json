That the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"316\">*316</page-number>plaintiffs continued prospecting, at different times, till about November, 1873, when they ceased work, and did not again occupy the claim or cabin, although their tools remained in the cabin. The defendants, in May, 1874, entered upon and claimed a portion of the ground upon which the plaintiffs had prospected, and also repaired and occupied the plaintiffs\u2019 cabin. Prior to the entry of the defendants, the plaintiffs had not marked off or designated by boundaries the ground claimed by them. The plaintiffs, in October, 1874, caused a survey to be made of about six hundred acres, including the ground claimed by the defendants. The land was public land.' More than five days before the commencement of this action, the plaintiffs served on the defendants a written demand for the surrender of the tract described in the complaint, but the defendants failed to comply with the demand. The action was commenced on the 5th day of November, 1874. When the plaintiffs rested, the defendants moved the court for a non-suit, on the following grounds:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b330-6\">1. That there is no evidence showing that the plaintiffs, or any of them, were in the actual, peaceable or exclusive possession of any of the land mentioned and described in the complaint, at the time defendants entered thereon.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b330-7\">2. There is no evidence tending to show any forcible or unlawful entry, or any forcible or unlawful detainer.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b330-8\">The court denied the motion, and the defendants excepted.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b330-9\">The plaintiffs obtained a verdict and judgment.
