The bark was engaged in navigating the high seas, and San Francisco was her home port, and the defendant was a part owner, and the supplies were furnished at the home port. The above facts were alleged in the complaint; and it was also alleged that the captain was authorized by the owners to make the purchases, and that after each purchase a bill of the same was rendered to the ship\u2019s husband, who was also an owner, and was allowed by him, and charged by him to the vessel.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b250-12\">When the cause was called for trial the defendant moved to dismiss the action because the court had no jurisdiction, exclusive jurisdiction of such actions being vested in the Court of Admiralty.

That Glidden &amp; Coleman, on the 27th of March, 1869, gave the plaintiff three notes for the sum of two thousand one hundred and seventy-three dollars each, which were credited by the plaintiff to Glidden <em>&amp; </em>Coleman as bills receivable.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b251-5\">That all the goods mentioned in plaintiff\u2019s complaint and in the bill

That the plaintiff and Glidden, before the commencement of the action, had a full settlement of the claim sued on, and Glidden and the bark were released from all liability. That the defendant did not order the supplies, and gave the captain no authority to buy them, and did not know that they were purchased on the credit of the bark. That Glidden &amp; Coleman handled the bark in their lumber business, and used it on their own account. The court gave \"the jury the following instructions :</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b252-7\">\u201cFirst. That a plaintiff in a cause of this character has made out a <em>prima facie </em>case against a defending owner of a vessel when he proves that, upon the request of the captain, he furnished articles for the use of a vessel such as came under the general appellation of ship\u2019s stores and provisions, that the defendant was at the time an owner in the vessel, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"239\">*239</page-number>that the alleged captain was in fact captain, and the-value of the goods, although such goods and supplies are furnished at the home port of a vessel.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b253-6\">\u201cSecond. If the vessel had a managing owner, a ship\u2019s husband, and the captain purchases supplies at a home port of a vessel, with the knowledge and consent of the ship\u2019s husband, all the owners are <em>prima facie </em>liable. \u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b253-7\">The following are the second, fifth and sixth instructions referred to in the opinion which were asked by the defendant and refused by the court:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b253-8\">\u201cSecond. If the jury find that credit at the time the supplies were ordered was given to the ship\u2019s husband ordering them, this defendant is not liable for the goods furnished, and the verdict should be in his favor.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b253-9\">\u201cFifth. If the jury believe from the .evidence that the plaintiff rendered an account for the articles named in the complaint to Glidden <em>&amp; </em>Coleman, and afterwards took Glidden <em>&amp; </em>Coleman\u2019s note for the same, and plaintiff also proved said account against Glidden or Glidden &amp; Coleman, in bankruptcy, this would tend to prove that credit was given to Glidden or Glidden <em>&amp; </em>Coleman, and in such case plaintiff cannot recover against defendant in this case.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"21\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b253-10\">\" Sixth. When a party owing a debt or debts gives several notes in payment of a gross sum of money, owing by him, the original amount will only revive upon a failure to pay all the notes; the payment of one of the notes by the maker will prevent the original debt from reviving.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"22\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b253-11\">The plaintiff had a verdict of the jury, and judgment was rendered in his favor. The defendant appealed from the judgment, and from an order denying a new trial.</summary>\n<p data-order=\"23\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b253-12\"><em>Howe &amp; Rosenbaum, </em>for the Appellant.</p>\n<p data-order=\"24\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b253-13\">This is clearly a case in admiralty, and the District Court had no jurisdiction. (Conklin\u2019s Admiralty, 54; <em>Crawford </em>v. \u201c<em>Caroline </em>Reid,\u201d 42 Cal. 469.) The ninth section of the Judiciary Act secures to suitors a common law remedy, where the common law is competent to give it. Had the plaintiff in this case declared in assumpsit for goods sold and delivered, and sustained the same by proof that the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"240\">*240</page-number>defendant had bought said articles himself, or by an agent appointed by him, according to some rule known to the common law, this action in a common law court could be' maintained.</p>\n<p data-order=\"25\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b254-6\">The first instruction given by the court at the request of plaintiff is not law. The master of a vessel has no right to bind the vessel or owner in a home port, unless the owner is absent and cannot be communicated with. (Story on Agency, Sec. 119; 3 Kent\u2019s Com. 169; Abbott on Shipping, 140; <em>Stern </em>v. <em>Doe, </em>12 Gray, 482.)</p>\n<p data-order=\"26\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b254-7\">The ship\u2019s husband, being the general agent of the other owners, binds his principals, etc., but a creditor may waive their liability, and trust to him alone. (Parsons on Shipping and Admiralty, 112.)</p>\n<p data-order=\"27\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b254-8\"><em>E. W. McGraw, </em>for the Respondent.</p>\n<p data-order=\"28\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b254-9\">The District Court had jurisdiction. This is a suit in assumpsit\u2014a common law remedy\u2014and the court has jurisdiction to administer a common law remedy even when the contract is maritime. <em>(Bohannon </em>v. <em>Hammond, </em>42 Cal. 227.)</p>\n<p data-order=\"29\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b254-10\">The first instruction given is correct. The captain <em>prima facie </em>has authority in a home port to purchase necessaries for a vessel, and is <em>prima facie </em>agent of the owners for that purpose. The presumption of agency is a common law presumption, and has not been departed from by the common law courts. Appellant\u2019s counsel suppose that the relation between captain and owners is the offspring of the maritime law. They are mistaken. It is the offspring of the civil law, and transplanted therefrom into both common law and admiralty jurisprudence. <em>(The Rebecca, </em>Ware\u2019s Rep. 195; <em>Hussey </em>v. <em>Christie, </em>5 East, 212; <em>Rich </em>v. <em>Cox, </em>Cowper\u2019s Rep. 636; <em>Abbott </em>v. <em>B. &amp; R. S. P. Co., </em>1 Md. Ch. 546; <em>Provost </em>v. <em>Patchin, </em>9 N. Y. 235; <em>Flanders </em>v. <em>Merritt, </em>3 Barb. 201; <em>Winsor </em>v. <em>Maddock, </em>64 Penn. St. 231; <em>Sampson </em>v. <em>Noble, </em>14 La. Ann. 347.)</p>\n<p data-order=\"30\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b254-11\">That in England a limitation of the power of the captain to bind the owner in a home port was at one time held to exist, is unquestionable, though most of the authorities cited by counsel are in our favor.</p>\n<p data-order=\"31\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b255-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"241\">*241</page-number>Appellant\u2019s second instruction was properly refused. The ship\u2019s husband was a part owner, and we gave credit to all the owners. If we had given exclusive credit to the ship\u2019s husband, with a full knowledge of the ownership of the defendant, then he might have been discharged. (1 Parsons on Maritime Law, 91.)</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"32\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b255-6\">By the Court, McKinstry, J.:</author>\n<p id=\"b255-7\">The District Court had jurisdiction. The action is to recover the value of goods, wares and merchandise sold and delivered, and the plaintiff is pursuing his \u201ccommon-law remedy.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b255-8\">The master\u2019s power is presumed, in the absence of evidence to the contrary, to extend to making contracts \"for supplies in the home port, which shall bind the owners. <em>(Provost </em>v. <em>Patchin, </em>9 N. Y. 239, and cases there cited.) Whatever the doctrine of the maritime law, by the analogies of the common law, the duties and relations of the master furnish presumptive evidence of his authority to purchase supplies. The first instruction was not erroneous.</p>\n<p id=\"b255-9\">Nor was the second instruction given erroneous. It was simply to the effect that if the purchases were made by the captain with the knowledge and consent of the ship\u2019s husband, the owners were <em>prima facie </em>liable. The juTy were not told that the owners were liable if it affirmatively appeared that the supplies were furnished on the exclusive credit of the ship\u2019s husband, or master, nor can such an inference be properly drawn from the language employed by the court below.</p>\n<p id=\"b255-10\">The second instruction asked by defendant was properly refused, as the hypothesis suggested by it is not that exclusive credit was given to the ship\u2019s husband; and again, there seems not to have been any evidence that the goods were \u201cordered\u201d by the ship\u2019s husband.</p>\n<p id=\"b255-11\">The fifth instruction offered by defendant was to the effect, that if there was evidence tending to prove a fact alleged by defendant to constitute a defense, the verdict should be in his favor; or if otherwise construed it is obnoxious to the objection that it does not proceed on the idea of an ex-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"242\">*242</page-number>elusive credit to the ship\u2019s husband. It was not error to refuse it.</p>\n<p id=\"b256-5\">The sixth instruction, as offered, does not appear to be sustained by reason or authority.</p>\n<p id=\"b256-6\">It was not error to refuse the seventh instruction as asked by defendant. It assumes that if the notes were accepted in payment, they were accepted in payment of the whole account sued on; while, as appears from the evidence, a portion of the articles mentioned in the account were furnished after the notes were given. If, therefore, the notes were received in payment for the goods previously sold, the defendant would not necessarily be entitled to a verdict.</p>\n<p id=\"b256-7\">Judgment and order affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b256-8\">Neither Mr. Chief Justice Wallace nor Mr. Justice Niles expressed an opinion.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
