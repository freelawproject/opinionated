As such, lie had in his hands money belonging to the heirs.

The subjects of <em>\u00e1ppeat </em>from the <em>Probate Court </em>to this Court, are enumerated in section 969 of the Code of Civil Procedure. An order entered in the Probate Court refusing to quash an execution is not one of these, and the appeal attempted here, therefore, cannot be supported.</p>\n<p id=\"b308-10\">Appeal dismissed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
