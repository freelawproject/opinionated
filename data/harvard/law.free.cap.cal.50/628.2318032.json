He sued the defendant for a libel contained in a card published by the defendant in the Eed Bluff Sentinel, published at Eed Bluff. The card contained, among other things, the following:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b642-13\">\" Speaking about lying, did you ever lie to Mr. Howard that caused him to sell his home and his business, and come here to engage in business with you ? You deceitful creature! Get a man here because he has money, and then attempt to rob him as you did. Borrowed his money to use for a short time, but when called upon for it, put him off from time to time, and then make a homestead of your house; and by not paying him and doing as you agreed, have compelled him to import and sell a few guns for a reasonable profit. That hit your corns, and no doubt he will ever be a thorn in your ribs as long as he remains in Eed Bluff.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b642-14\">During the trial the plaintiff, who was a-witness in his own behalf, was asked on cross-examination if he had ever <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"629\">*629</page-number>written letters to W. F. Howard, impeaching the character of defendant\u2019s wife. He answered that he did not think he had.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b643-6\">The defendant introduced in evidence the deposition of Howard, taken at Saratoga Springs, New York. The plaintiff\u2019s counsel, Mr. Pendegast, in offering rebutting testimony, said: \u201cI offer this series of letters, written by W. F. Howard from Saratoga Springs, and addressed to GL O. Leonard, marked \u2018Exhibits One, Two, Three, and Four.\u2019 The first is dated December 10, 1872; the second, January <em>24, </em>1873; the third, February 12, 1873; and the fourth, February 17, 1873.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b643-7\">Mr. Braynard. \u201cFor what purpose do you offer the letters?\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b643-8\">Mr. Pendegast. \u201cThis purpose: there is a charge in this card, on which this suit was brought, of robbery\u2014an attempt to rob this man Howard\u2014on the part of Leonard, and there is an attempt to support that charge by the testimony of Howard himself, and, perhaps, somewhat by the testimony of Kingsley. I offer these letters to show that the very man who Kingsley claims was robbed, after the time of the alleged robbery, and for a series of months, wrote in friendly correspondence to Leonard, the alleged robber, pressing him to engage in business enterprises with him; offering to advance him money, and speaking of and to him in the kindest of terms.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b643-9\">Mr. Braynard. \u201cWe object that it is the declaration of a third party as to business transactions; upon which business transactions the individual whose letters are at this time produced was interrogated in the deposition that has been offered in evidence; and if the gentleman wished to question him relative to these business transactions which ho narrates in the deposition, he had an ample opportunity of putting his cross-questions at the time. They seek now to introduce the declarations of a third party,.without having given us any opportunity whatever of cross-examination. We object, further, that the letters sought to be introduced are inadmissible, if the object of the introduction is to discredit the witness Howard, the parties having made him their own witness.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b644-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"630\">*630</page-number>Mr. Pendegast. \u201cThis is not the object, by any means; we do not intend it as matter of impeachment. \u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b644-6\">The Judge. \u201cThe objection will be overruled.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b644-7\">Defendant excepted.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b644-8\">Mr. Pendegast read the letters.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b644-9\">The plaintiff had the verdict of-a jury and judgment in his favor.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b644-10\">The defendant appealed.</summary>\n<p data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b644-11\"><em>Creed Haymond, P. B. Nagle and C. P. Braynard, </em>for the Appellant.</p>\n<p data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b644-12\"><em>W. W. Pendegast, </em>for the Respondent.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b644-13\">By the Court:</author>\n<p id=\"b644-14\">The letters from Howard, put in evidence by the plaintiff against the objection of the defendant, were improperly admitted. Howard was not a party to the action, but had been examined as a witness in the cause on behalf of the defendant, and his deposition had been put\"in evidence. If the plaintiff desired to use the letters as evidence, he should have called the attention of the Avitness to them, and have afforded the defendant an opportunity to cross-examine him in respect to them. He might have shown by the testimony of Howard the circumstances under which the letters were written, and possibly have so explained the transaction as to render them harmless for any purpose. Standing alone and unexplained, the letters were not admissible for any purpose. They are not before us, nor do their contents appear in the record, except in so far as they may be inferred from the statement of counsel, at the time they Avere offered; and it is urged in argument, that in the absence of the letters, it cannot bo presumed that they were injurious to the defendant\u2019s case, even though they were improperly admitted in evidence. But the rule long recognized and acted upon by this Court is, that when the appellant has shown error in the admission of evidence, the error will be presumed to have been injurious to the adverse party, unless the contrary clearly and affirmatively appears. If the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"631\">*631</page-number>production of the letters would have shown that they could not have damaged the defendant, the respondent should have had them incorporated into the record.</p>\n<p id=\"b645-6\">Judgment and order reversed, and cause remanded for a new trial.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
