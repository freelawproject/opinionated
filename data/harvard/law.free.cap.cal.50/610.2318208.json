Soon after the date of the lease, the defendant purchased the lot on the south side of the leased premises and erected a brick building thereon, by which he closed up several windows in the south wall of the Brooklyn Hotel. There was a covenant in the lease that the lessees should peaceably and quietly have, hold and enjoy the demised premises for the term. This was an action to recover damages for a violation of the covenant. The plaintiffs recovered judgment and the defendant appealed.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b624-12\">The other facts are stated in the opinion.</summary>\n<p data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b624-13\"><em>Creed Haymond, Ed.

The judgment was for three hundred and ten dollars damages, and there is nothing in the record to show that for the trespass admitted in pleading it should have been for a less sum. Irrespective, therefore, of the question principally argued at bar, we think that the judgment rendered below cannot, in this condition of the record, be disturbed by us.</p>\n<p id=\"b625-9\">Judgment affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"concurrence\">\n<author id=\"b625-10\">Crockett, J., concurring:</author>\n<p id=\"b625-11\">I concur in the judgment, on the ground that the defendant is estopped by the covenants in the lease from obstructing the windows in the hotel.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
