On the trial, the plaintiff testified that his brother-in-law bought the lot in controversy, and allowed him to live on it and take care of it for him, and that he had no lease and paid, no rent.\u2019 The counsel for the defendant moved for a non-suit, because the plaintiff had no right to maintain the action. The motion was denied. The case came up on a bill of exceptions, settled July 26, 1875. The plaintiff had judgment for three hundred dollars. The bill of exceptions states the testimony as to the plaintiff\u2019s occupancy, and the motion for a nonsuit, and then proceeds: \u201cUpon the trial of said cause there was no testimony offered by the plaintiff of any damage having been sustained by the plaintiff except that which might result to the plaintiff by being forcibly ejected from the premises. The court gave plaintiff damages in the sum of one hundred dollars, which was trebled, and this decision of the court is assigned as error.\u201d There was no specification that the proof did not justify the damages.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b522-11\">The defendant appealed.</summary>\n<p data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b522-12\"><em>George W. Tyler, </em>for the Appellant.</p>\n<p data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b522-13\">It clearly appears from Jones\u2019s evidence that the plaintiff was not the owner of the real estate sued for, nor did he <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"509\">*509</page-number>occupy the same as a tenant. He merely occupied the land as the agent or servant of another, and therefore cannot maintain the suit for possession in his own name. <em>(Minturn </em>v. <em>Burr, </em>16 Cal. 107; <em>Morgan </em>v. <em>Higgins, </em>37 Cal. 59.) The testimony did. not warrant the damages.</p>\n<p data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b523-6\"><em>Howe &amp; Rosenbaum, </em>for the Respondent.</p>\n<p data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b523-7\">The bill of exceptions does not specify the particulars in which the evidence is alleged to be insufficient, as required by section 648, Code of Civil Procedure.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b523-8\">By the Court:</author>\n<p id=\"b523-9\">The motion for nonsuit was properly denied. The plaintiff\u2019s proof shows that at the time of the forcible entry complained of the plaintiff was in the actual and peaceable possession of the premises in controversy, not merely as the servant of another, but as a tenant at will; and had therefore such a possession as would enable him to maintain the action in his own name. If the proof did not warrant the amount of damages awarded to the plaintiff, the defendant should either have moved for a new trial on that ground or have specified in his bill of exceptions in what particulars the evidence did not justify the decision in this respect, and have brought up the evidence on this point. But the defendant has done neither.</p>\n<p id=\"b523-10\">Judgment affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
