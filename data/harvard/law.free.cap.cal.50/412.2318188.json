Schmeidell, trustee,\u201d and delivered it to him, but no change was made on the books of the company, nor did Levy inform the company of his purchase. On the 7th day of April, 1873, Levy lost the certificate. On the 8th day of April, 1873, he notified the corporation of his loss, and having indemnified it, on the 19th of May following, the company gave him a new certificate, a copy of the old one. On the 7th of April, 1873, the plaintiff, who was also a stock broker, purchased, in the usual course of business, twenty shares of the stock of said corporation, and H. Morrison, who sold the same, delivered him the certificate which Levy had lost. Sherwood paid value, and did not know of Levy\u2019s loss. On the 2d day of July, 1873, Sherwood, still ignorant that the certificate was not good, and of Levy\u2019s loss, presented it to the corporation and demanded a new certificate to be issued to him. The company refused. By the custom of brokers in San Francisco, certificates drawn as this was, and indorsed, pass from hand to hand, by mere delivery, without any transfer on the books of the company. This was an application for a writ of mandate to compel the corporation to issue a new certificate to the plaintiff. The court below refused to issue the writ, and the plaintiff appealed.</summary>\n<p data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b427-5\"><em>J. W.

(2 Parsons on Contracts, 52, 53, 55; <em>The Commercial Bank of Buffalo </em>v. <em>Kortright, </em>22 Wend. 348; <em>Smith </em>v. <em>Wright, </em>1 Caine\u2019s Rep. 43; <em>Hinton </em>v. <em>Locke, </em>5 Hill, 437; <em>Outwater </em>v. <em>Nelson, </em>20 Barb. 29.)</p>\n<p data-order=\"23\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b428-5\"><em>Crane &amp; Boyd, </em>for the Respondent.</p>\n<p data-order=\"24\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b428-6\">Assuming that the capital stock of the company was divided into 60,000 shares, this particular certificate represented totW undivided parts of the assets and business of the corporation, and nothing more. <em>(Harris </em>v. <em>S. F. R. R. Co., </em>41 Cal 408; <em>Atkins </em>v. <em>Gamble, </em>42 Cal. 99.)</p>\n<p data-order=\"25\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b428-7\">But it did not represent shares which could be segregated from the other shares by any particular earmark. In other words, one share was as good as another. <em>(Hardenberg </em>v. <em>Bacon, </em>33 Cal. 384; <em>Hawley </em>v. <em>Brummagim, </em>33 Cal. 394; <em>Brewster </em>v. <em>Sime, </em>42 Cal. 139; Angell on Corporations, Secs. 564, 565.)</p>\n<p data-order=\"26\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b428-8\">A certificate of stock is neither a negotiable nor a <em>quasi </em>negotiable instrument. (Civil Code, Sec. 3087; <em>Mechanics\u2019 Bank </em>v. <em>N. Y. &amp; N. H. R. R. Co., </em>13 N. Y. 623, 627, 628, 629; 34 N. Y. 72; <em>Farmers\u2019 Bank </em>v. <em>Butcher Bank, </em>14 N.

Law Reg., June, 1873.)</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"27\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b428-9\">By the Court :</author>\n<p id=\"b428-10\">In <em>Atkins </em>v. <em>Gamble </em>(42 Cal. 99), we held that certificates of stock in a corporation are not negotiable securities in a commercial sense; but are mere muniments and evidences of the holder\u2019s title to a given share in the property and franchises of the corporation of which he is a member. We do not think it necessary to again go over the reasoning, or <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"415\">*415</page-number>engage in a review of the authorities by which the conclusion is maintained. Mr. Parsons, in a note to the sixth edition of his work on Contracts (vol. 1, p. 290), after a somewhat extended citation of the authorities upon the general subject, says:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b429-6\">\u201cThe result would seem to be that all corporation bonds and government stocks, which pass by delivery, or indorsement with delivery, are negotiable; but that certificates of stock in a corporation are not.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b429-7\">The question underwent an exhaustive consideration by the Court of Appeals of the State of New York, in the year 1856, in <em>Mechanics\u2019 Bank </em>v. <em>N. Y. and N. H. R. R. Co. </em>(3 Kernan, 599), and the opinion of the court, delivered by Justice Comstock, contains a masterly exposition of the principles of law and a citation and comparison of the judicial decisions applicable to the question.</p>\n<p id=\"b429-8\">We are of opinion that upon the agreed facts of the case, the judgment of the court below was correctly entered in favor of the defendants Judgment affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
