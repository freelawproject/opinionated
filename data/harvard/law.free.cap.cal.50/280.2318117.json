Y. Smith. The plaintiff sought to condemn a block of the land for depot purposes, and a right of way forty feet wide across the remainder of the tract. \u2022 On the trial, the defendant Smith was permitted, against the objection of the plaintiff, to prove that the railroad across his land would be raised by an embankment of earth three or four feet high, and which would be a disadvantage to the remainder of the land, and that the railroad cut off the front of a part of his land from the county road, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"281\">*281</page-number>which would injure its sale in small tracts for homestead purposes, and that the manner in which the railroad track cut the land left it in bad shape. The answer had not set up these facts but claimed damages generally. The court assessed the value of the depot lot and belt for the track at $2075, and the damages to the remainder of the land, by the construction of the road, at $1200, and adjudged the benefits to be $2, and rendered judgment for $3273. The plaintiff appealed. The proceeding was commenced under the provisions of Title VII, Part III, of the Code of Civil Procedure.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b295-5\">The other facts are stated in the opinion.</summary>\n<p data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b295-6\"><em>E.

Smith, Jr., </em>for the Respondent.</p>\n<p data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b295-9\">The damages termed special by the appellant are not special, for section 1248 of the Code of Civil Procedure requires the court to assess such damages.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b295-10\">By the Court, Crockett, J.:</author>\n<p id=\"b295-11\">1. There was a substantial conflict in the evidence as to the value of the land taken, and as to the damage and benefits to the remainder of the tract. In such cases we uniformly refuse to disturb the verdict or decision, on the ground that it was not justified by the evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b295-12\">2. There were no formal, separate findings of fact; but the judgment of the court determined the value of the land proposed to be taken, and the benefits and damage to the remainder of the tract, stating the several sums in dollars and cents generally, without specifying that the said valuations were made on a gold coin basis. It then proceeds to render judgment for the aggregate of the several sums found to be due, and orders judgment to be made payable in gold coin. The proceeding was commenced after the Codes took <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"282\">*282</page-number>effect; and under the rule established by the Code of Civil Procedure, no findings of fact are implied in support of the judgment. On the contrary, when the facts are found it must appear affirmatively that they support the judgment. It is not necessary to decide whether it was competent for the court to ascertain the value in gold coin as contradistinguished from legal tender notes, and to render a judgment payable only in gold coin. Though the court finds generally the value of the land taken and the damages to the remainder of the tract, it does not appear that these estimates were made on a gold coin basis. That fact not appearing, it was error to render a judgment for gold coin, even though it be conceded that such a judgment would otherwise have been authorized.</p>\n<p id=\"b296-4\">3. The point made by the appellant, that the court erred in admitting proof of special damage, not alleged in the answer, is untenable. There was no proof of special damage in the proper sense of that term.</p>\n<p id=\"b296-5\">4. \"We discover no error in the rulings of the court in respect to the admission or exclusion of evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b296-6\">Order and judgment affirmed, except as to that portion of the judgment which requires payment in gold coin; and in that particular the cause is remanded, with an order to the court below to modify the judgment in accordance with this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b296-7\">Mr. Justice Rhodes did not express an opinion.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
