Benjamin F. Fortson died in Corsicana, Texas, on January 22, 1883. His wife, Mollie P., survived him, and remained a widow until December 14, 1884, on which day she married H. A.

Huffman for $75 cash, which deed was duly acknowledged November 3, 1879, and duly recorded in Tarrant County, November 6, 1879. Upon the trial of this cause this deed 'was proved as at common law. M. G. Ellis and W. A. Huffman paid to Benjamin F. Fortson the $75 for the lot, and received the deed of Fortson, as attorney in fact for his wife, believing the same to be a valid and binding conveyance in fee simple, and relying upon the power of attorney as authorizing him to sell the lot and to bind his wife by his conveyance of the same.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b359-7\">\u201c6.

Neither M. G. Ellis, nor W. A. Huffman, nor defendant Sarah B. Brown, nor any other defendant in this suit, knew before it was filed that the plaintiff, Mollie P. Halbert, intended to dispute the validity of the power of attorney to her then husband, Benjamin F. Fortson, or the deed of conveyance which Benjamin F. Fortson executed under said power, or that plaintiffs, or either of them, intended for any reason to claim said lot.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b359-11\">\u201c9. Up to the time of the execution of the deed by W. A. Huffman to the defendant Sarah B. Brown, the lot in controversy had never been occupied, and was uninclosed, and had no improvements upon it. Said deed was executed on the day of its date, November 4,1881. Immediately thereafter, and during the year 1881, defendant Sarah B. Brown began to improve said lot. She inclosed it and built a house and made other improvements thereon, and as soon as the house was completed, she moved into it and took actual, open, and adverse possession of the lot, to wit, -on the last day of December, 1881; she has ever since that time had actual and adverse possession thereof, and has <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"338\">*338</page-number>been using and enjoying it, and has constantly claimed to own it under the deed of W. A. Huffman. Her possession was continuous, and was not interrupted by any adverse suit to recover said lot until the filing of this suit, on September 10, 1890. She has paid all State and county taxes levied on the lot for the years 1882, 1883, 1884, 1885, 1886, and 1887; she has also paid the city taxes thereon for the years from 1881 to 1888, both inclusive, but she did not pay the county or State taxes for 1881 or 1888, but W. A. Huffman, her vendor, paid said taxes for 1881. County and State taxes were levied upon the lot for the years 1888 and 1889, but neither Sarah B. Brown nor any other defendant, nor any person through whom any one or more of the defendants claim titles to said lot, paid any part of the said taxes for 1888 or 1889. Heither the county nor State taxes for 1888 and 1889 have ever been paid. The State and county taxes paid by Sarah B. Brown for the years 1882,1883,1884,1885,1886, and 1887, and the city taxes for the years 1881 to 1888, inclusive, paid by her, amount in the aggregate to the sum of $223.50. After the filing of this suit, Sarah B. Brown paid the taxes levied on the lot for the year 1890, amounting to the sum of $40.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b360-3\">\u201c10. Defendant Sarah B. Brown had adverse possession in good faith of the lot in controversy for more than one year next before the commencement of this suit, and made permanent and valuable improvements thereon during the time she had possession, of the aggregate value of $1500. The value of such improvements at the time of the trial of this cause and the amount to which the value of the lot is actually increased thereby is $1500. The value of the lot without the improvements so made is $2000, and the value of the lot and the improvements is $3500.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b360-4\">The conclusions of law are as follows:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b360-5\">\u201c1.

That the power of attorney from plaintiff, then Mollie P. Fort-son, and her husband Benjamin F. Fortson, to said Benjamin F. Fort-son, was and is void, and not binding upon plaintiff, and the deed executed under said power of attorney by Benjamin F. Fortson, conveying the lot in controversy, was and is without authority, and does not divest said plaintiff of the title to said lot.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"23\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b360-8\">\u201c4. Said power of attorney and deed do not constitute a contract for the conveyance of the lot, and the circumstances shown do not estop the plaintiff, Mollie P. Halbert, from claiming the lot.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"24\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b360-9\">\u201c5.

From the 1st day of July, 1873, to the 22nd day of January, 1883, the plaintiff Mollie P. Halbert was under the disability of coverture, and until the removal of that disability, on January 22, 1883, the possession of the defendant Sarah B. Brown, which was begun during the period of coverture, could not set in motion the statute of limitation of five years.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"26\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b361-5\"><em>\u201c7. </em>After the removal of said disability, the adverse possession of the defendant Sarah B. Brown, who claimed under a duly registered deed conveying to her the land in controversy, and who paid all the taxes upon the land in controversy for each of the years 1883, 1884, 1885, 1886, and 1887, set in motion against the plaintiff, Mollie P. Halbert, the statute of limitation of five years; and although said period of five years did not expire until January 22,1888, and said defendant did not pay any of the taxes levied upon the lot for the year 1888, inasmuch as said taxes were not due or payable on January 23,1888, and the levy thereof by law not being required to be made until later, when the five years\u2019 period expired, said defendant\u2019s limitation title accrued then without the payment of the taxes for the year 1888, and became and is complete, and the defendant Sarah B. Brown is entitled to judgment -under her plea of limitation of five years, and by virtue of the five years\u2019 statute of limitation, title to said lot vested in defendant Sarah B. Brown on January 23, 1888.\u201d</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"27\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b361-6\"><em>Williams &amp; Butts, </em>for appellants.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"28\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AyU\">\u2014 The court erred in holding that the plea of five years\u2019 statute of limitation can be maintained and its sufficiency supported by the evidence of proof of payment of taxes for less than five years; whereas the law is, that the possession and payment of taxes necessary to support such plea must be for the same period of time, and that this period can not be less than five years.
