The Port Worth Company, appellant, was held liable, together with the North Side Company, as lessor of the latter, and the jury, by permission of appellee, were instructed to return a verdict in favor of the Texas &amp; Pacific Company:</p>\n<p id=\"b634-7\">In the year 1874 the Port Worth Street Railway Company was chartered and duly organized under the laws of Texas. Thereafter, on July 15th of that year, the following ordinance was duly adopted by the city council of the city of Port Worth:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b634-8\">\u201cSection 1.

Be it ordained by the city council of Fort Worth, that all the rights, privileges, and franchises heretofore granted to the Fort Worth Street Railway Company, by an ordinance passed on the 15th day of July, 1874, and entitled an ordinance granting certain privileges to the Fort Worth Street Railway Company, so- far as the same grants the right to construct and operate not more than two (2) lines of street railway along Main street and its extensions, provided no wire shall be less than twenty-five feet from the ground across the Texas <em>&amp; </em>Pacific Railway tracks, and further, that the said company be required to conform to grade from Fifteenth to Front streets, as heretofore ordered, be and the same is hereby in all respects confirmed for the use of the Fort Worth Street Railway Company and the lessee of its rights and privileges and franchises; and be it further ordained, that any track laid or to be laid by said company shall be on a grade given by the city engineer.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b638-5\">\u201cSec. 2. It is understood that the Fort Worth Street Railway Company and its said lessee shall in all respects obey and conform its actions to the ordinances of the city of Fort Worth regulating street railroads, now in force or hereafter to be in force, and that the maximum rate of fare shall never exceed 5 cents per passenger; and be it further ordained, that at the crossing of the Texas <em>&amp; </em>Pacific Railway' Company\u2019s tracks the street car company shall put in a safe and suitable crossing, and said street railway company shall use all reasonable precaution to insure safety to passengers by maintaining a watchman, or by having conductors, if they are used, to precede all cars with a red flag by day or red light at night; and be it further provided, that any other street railway company may use the tracks across said Texas <em>&amp; </em>Pacific Railway Company\u2019s tracks, by paying their pro rata of costs of construction of said crossing.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b638-6\">\u201cSec. 3. This ordinance to take effect and be in force from and after its passage.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b638-7\">After the North Side Company became lessee as above provided, it laid a double track in place of the single one previously used by the Fort Worth Company (but over the protest of the president of the latter company), and continued till long after the date of the accident to operate under the lease a line of street railway over said double track from the public square, along Main street, to the Texas <em>&amp; </em>Pacific or Union Depot.</p>\n<p id=\"b638-8\">Between the foot, of Main street and the Union Depot is the Texas <em>&amp; </em>Pacific reservation, the property of the Texas <em>&amp; </em>Pacific Railway Company, over which the street car line ran, including the place of collision. Here there was no regularly established street of the city, but the way of public travel was alongside or over the street car track at the point of collision, and there had not hitherto been any other way of travel from the city to the Union Depot.</p>\n<p id=\"b639-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"617\">*617</page-number>As a result of the collision, the wife of appellee received painful injuries about the head, neck, and shoulders. After describing the collision, her bodily injuries, and consequent suffering, she testified: \u201cI was so frightened when I was first hurt, both at the collision, and then my child was badly hurt.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b639-5\">The amount of the recovery, $1125, was not excessive.</p>\n<p id=\"b639-6\"><em>Conclusions of Law. </em>\u2014 1. The petition charged that the car upon which the injured wife was a passenger, as well as that of the Texas &amp; Pacific Company, was so carelessly run and operated that the collision resulted, giving time, place, and in part the circumstances, though not the details of the accident. It was clearly good on general demurrer, and quite as specific as the exception relied on as a special exception to test its sufficiency, to wit, that the acts of negligence were not \u201csufficiently specified.\u201d Railway v. Granger, 85 Texas, 574.</p>\n<p id=\"b639-7\">2. The definition of negligence complained of in second assignment was substantially correct, but if otherwise, this feature of the charge would not require the judgment to be reversed, because the negligence of the Forth Side Company was too well established to admit of any but an affirmative finding on that issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b639-8\">3. There was no plea over against the Texas and Pacific Company, and no case made against it; hence no error in instructing a verdict in its favor.</p>\n<p id=\"b639-9\">4. The objection to the charge, that it authorized a recovery for the mental suffering of plaintiff below, the husband, has been obviated by a correction of the record. Thus corrected, it instructed the jury to assess the damages \u201cat such sum as would be a fair and reasonable compensation for such physical injuries and suffering as plaintiff\u2019s wife sustained from the collision, and for such mental suffering as they might believe from the evidence plaintiff\u2019s wife sustained by reason of the collision.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b639-10\">As a general statement of the measure of recovery, the charge was correct. If appellant desired a more definite statement, it should have requested it. Besides, the opinion of the Supreme Court in the Trott case, 86 Texas, 412, is not believed to be applicable to the case of a female passenger, who is both bruised and frightened in a railway collision. Railway v. Corley, 29 S. W. Rep., 231. See also Yoakum v. Kroeger (Fourth District), 27 S. W. Rep., 953.</p>\n<p id=\"b639-11\">The charge expressly directed the jury not to consider the matter of the child\u2019s injuries in assessing the damages.</p>\n<p id=\"b639-12\">5. The foregoing conclusions dispose of all the assignments of error except the fourth, fifth, and seventh, raising the most important question at issue \u2014 whether liability of the Fort Worth Street Railway Company was a necessary result of that of the \u00a1North Side Railway Company.</p>\n<p id=\"b639-13\">That a company chartered to construct and operate an ordinary railroad can not by a lease to another company, without permission of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"618\">*618</page-number>Legislature, absolve itself from the obligations which its charter, the law, and the nature of its business place it under to the public, is too well settled, both in and out of this State, to require the citation of authority. Whether such lease by legislative permission, in the absence of a provision to that effect, will absolve it, does not seem to be so well settled; but the negative of the proposition is sustained by very high authority, and seems to have received the sanction of our Supreme Court. In Railway v. Morris &amp; Crawford, 68 Texas, 59, Justice Gaines used this language: \u201cNor will a lease duly authorized by law release the company from a failure to discharge its charter obligations, unless the law giving the power contains a provision to that effect. \u2019 \u2019 The following cases support this view with cogent reasoning: Harmen v. Railway, 28 S. C., 401 (13 Am. St. Rep., 638); Braslin v. Horse Railway, 145 Mass., 64; Abbott v. Horse Railway, 80 N. Y., 27 (36 Am. Rep., 572).</p>\n<p id=\"b640-6\">The remaining question is, do these rules have application to companies chartered, whether by general or special law, to operate street car lines in cities and towns? And this question, we think, both on reason and authority, should be answered in the affirmative.</p>\n<p id=\"b640-7\">The principle underlying the adjudications on this subject is well stated by Justice Miller, in Thomas v. Railway, 101 United States, 71, to be, \u201cthat where a corporation, like a railroad company, has granted to it by charter a franchise intended in large measure to be exercised for the public good, the due performance of those functions being the consideration of the public grant, any contract which disables the corporation from performing those functions, which undertakes, without the consent of the State, to transfer to others the rights and powers conferred by the charter, and to relieve the grantees of the burden which it imposes, is a violation of the contract with the State, and is void as against public policy.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b640-8\">The two cases cited above from Massachusetts and New York, as does also that of Rickets v. Railway (85 Alabama, 601), 5 Southern Reporter, 353 (and doubtless others), apply this principle to street car companies. See also Street Railway Law (Booth), sections 425 and 426. At section 12, the author of the work last cited says: \u201cThe grout of the right to maintain in the public highway permanent tracks not necessary to its use in the ordinary mode of travel, and to propel cars thereon, and to demand toll, is in derogation of common right; hence its source can be found only in the sovereign power of the State,\u201d etc. Mr. Elliott likewise lays it down, that roads or streets can not be occupied by street railway tracks without legislative sanction, but that it is not necessary that the authority be conferred by direct grant. Like other powers over the streets, it may be delegated to municipal corporations, but such use of the streets can be licensed only for public purposes. Elliott on Roads and Streets, 562-565.</p>\n<p id=\"b640-9\">While our statutes undoubtedly confer on such bodies very extensive powers over the streets, it is not entirely clear that the power to absolve <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"619\">*619</page-number>from charter obligations has been conferred. But, as already seen, we need not decide this question, because the ordinance quoted above, if construed as permitting the lease (which may be doubted \u2014 see Thomas v. Railway, supra, for legislative enactment of similar import construed not to grant such permission), did not purport to do more. The provision in the lease itself of indemnity to the lessor by the lessee company indicates that, except as between the companies, the obligation to the public originally assumed by the Fort Worth Company was understood to still rest on it, and it should not be inferred that the city council interpreted it more favorably to the lessor than was done by the parties themselves. A similar provision was so interpreted in both the Abbott and Braslin cases, supra.</p>\n<p id=\"b641-5\">In deriving the handsome revenue of $500 per month for the valuable franchise conferred upon it by the State, whether directly or indirectly, the Fort Worth Company, in order to escape the consequent obligation to render to the public a suitable return for the valuable privilege thus enjoyed, should have clearly shown not only that the city council was empowered to so release it, but that it had in fact done so. This, we think, it has failed to do.</p>\n<p id=\"b641-6\">The further contention is urged, that because the place of the collision was not on Main street, but on land owned by the Texas &amp; Pacific Company, between Main street and the depot, the foregoing principles are inapplicable; but to this we can not agree. In granting to the Fort Worth Company valuable rights and privileges on Main street, the condition or obligation was imposed of operating for public convenience a street car line between the public square and the Texas &amp; Pacific depot. The place of the accident was in the city, and on the appointed journey, and was thus a part of the entire line operated in transporting passengers to and from the depot.
