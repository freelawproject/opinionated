Armentrout,</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b143-7\">\u201cA. B. Fraser.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b143-8\">A few days after the execution of this mortgage, appellant sued out a writ of attachment against the firm of Armentrout, Fraser <em>&amp; </em>Chew, and had the same levied upon their stock of goods in the city of Vernon. At that time, the trustee named in the mortgage had not attempted to take possession of the interest of Armentrout &amp; Fraser in this stock. The goods were sold under this attachment, and the proceeds paid into court. .</p>\n<p id=\"b143-9\">Appellees reconvened for damages for the wrongful suing out of this attachment, and were given judgment for the value of the goods, from which was deducted the amount of their indebtedness to appellant.</p>\n<p id=\"b143-10\">The attachment was sued out upon the ground that appellees \u201chave disposed of their property in whole, with intent to defraud their creditors.\u201d Appellant sought to sustain this allegation by proving the execution of the mortgage aforesaid, no other fraudulent disposition of any property of the firm being attempted to be shown.</p>\n<p id=\"b143-11\"><em>Opinion. </em>\u2014 As the instrument copied in our conclusions of fact was only a mortgage, the court below did not err in holding that appellees could maintain a suit for the conversion of the mortgaged property. 1 Sedg. on Dam., sec. 81. The trustee in the mortgage had not taken possession of the mortgaged goods, nor was it attempted to be shown that any part of this property had been applied to the mortgaged debt, and that thereby appellees had not been damaged to the extent of its full value. The case of Boby v. Meyer, 84 Texas, 386, which holds that the assignee in a deed of assignment is the proper person to maintain an action for the conversion of the assigned goods, does not apply to such a case.</p>\n<p id=\"b143-12\">Neither did the court err in sustaining the exceptions to appellant\u2019s answer, in which it sought to justify the attachment upon the ground of the validity of this mortgage, as creating a lien upon the interest of Armentrout &amp; Fraser in the goods of Armentrout, Fraser &amp; Chew. If this mortgage was such an one as these parties had a right to make, and therefore created a valid lien upon their interest in the firm prop<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"122\">*122</page-number>erty, it could not be a fraudulent disposition, within the meaning of our attachment statute; and appellant\u2019s exceptions were all based upon the ground of its validity.</p>\n<p id=\"b144-4\">Again, if this mortgage was invalid, or even fraudulent, it would not constitute a defense in this case, because the attachment was sued out against Armentrout, Fraser <em>&amp; </em>Chew, and was executed by taking actual possession of their property There was no pretense that Chew was guilty of any fraud, and it was not sought to justify the attachment as against him. If appellant desired to sue out an attachment against Armentrout &amp; Fraser on account of their fraud, it had a right to do so; but in such case, the levy upon their interest in the property of Armentrout, Fraser &amp; Chew should have been made by giving notice to Chew, in compliance with article 2295 of our Revised Statutes, instead of by taking actual possession.</p>\n<p id=\"b144-5\">It will be noted, that the mortgage in question is distinctly restricted to the individual interests of Armentrout and Fraser in these goods, and does not purport to be the act of Armentrout, Fraser <em>&amp; </em>Chew, so as to raise the question of the liability of a partnership to attachment for the act of one of its members in making a fraudulent transfer of its property.</p>\n<p id=\"b144-6\">In this case, appellees were only given judgment for the difference between the value of the goods and the amount of appellant\u2019s debt, and this we think they were entitled to recover, by reason of the illegal manner in which the attachment was sued out and levied, even though it were justified against some of the members of the firm.</p>\n<p id=\"b144-7\">If appellant desired to raise the question as to whether or not Chew should be restricted to this individual damage, upon the ground that there were no partnership debts to be paid out of the recovery, and that Armentrout and Fraser should not be benefited as individuals, if they were guilty of fraud, it should have presented the issue in proper pleading. We fail to find in the pleading in this case any charge of fraud in the execution of this mortgage, or any data upon which to restrict a recovery to the individual damage of Chew, appellant\u2019s defense, as developed by its pleading, seemingly being based upon the idea that the trustee alone could maintain the suit as to Armentrout <em>&amp; </em>Fraser\u2019s interest, which we have held untenable.</p>\n<p id=\"b144-8\">We think the court did not commit reversible error in overruling appellant\u2019s exception to appellees\u2019 answer, for want of a sufficient description of the goods for the illegal levy upon which they sought a recovery.</p>\n<p id=\"b144-9\">It will be borne in mind that this was a plea in reconvention in the suit in which the attachment was sued out.</p>\n<p id=\"b144-10\">The description referred to is as follows: \u201cSaid agent, A. W. Bell, caused the sheriff of this county, J. T. Conn, to levy said writ of attachment on plaintiffs\u2019 stock of goods, which stock of goods were then and there worth the sum of $3500, the same being the market value thereof at said time and place, but the said sheriff, J. T. Conn, in his <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"123\">*123</page-number>inventory now attached to the said writ and on file in this cause inventoried said goods at the sum of $2787, which was and is far less than said goods were then and there worth in the Vernon market, as aforesaid. Said affidavit, bond, writ of attachment, levy and return, and inventory of said goods, etc., are all on file among the papers in this case, and are here referred to for a more definite description thereof, and made a part of this plea in reconvention. \u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b145-4\">The exception which was overruled was as follows: \u201cPlaintiff excepts to said amended answer, because no itemized list, or other sufficient description, of the goods charged to have been seized by plaintiff\u2019s order is set out in or attached to said answer, nor does said answer contain sufficient averments to enable plaintiff to determine what goods it is charged with causing to be seized under attachment/\u2019</p>\n<p id=\"b145-5\">It will be noted, that this exception does not complain of the manner in which the sheriff\u2019s inventory was made an exhibit to the answer, nor does it specifically object to the failure to affix a separate value to each item of the goods, the only objection being to the failure to sufficiently identify the goods themselves which were taken under the writ.</p>\n<p id=\"b145-6\">If the sheriff\u2019s inventory sought to be made a part of this answer is to be treated as an exhibit thereto, we think there can be no serious question as to the sufficiency of the description of the goods contained therein. We have been pointed to no defect in this inventory, and we have failed to discover any substantial one. At any rate, the sheriff was acting at the instance of appellant in levying this attachment, and it was his duty to make a properly itemized list of the goods taken by him, and it was appellant\u2019s duty to see that this was done; and if there was a failure in this respect, it ill becomes it to complain thereof.</p>\n<p id=\"b145-7\">We have concluded, that in the absence of a special exception calling in question the manner of making this inventory or exhibit it should be treated as a part of the answer (Peveler v. Peveler, 54 Texas, 53); and that, when so treated, the description of the property must be held to be sufficient, within the requirements of the decision of our Supreme Court in Schneider v. Ferguson, 77 Texas, 572.</p>\n<p id=\"b145-8\">The record does not furnish sufficient data to authorize us to review the action of the court below in overruling, at a former term, appellant\u2019s motion to retax the costs attending the execution of the writ of attachment. In order to enable us to pass upon this motion, the evidence upon which the court acted in overruling it should be brought to our attention by bill of exceptions or otherwise. We can not, from this record, say what services were rendered by Sevier, styled in the bill of costs an auctioneer, for which the sheriff paid him the $50 complained of, and we can not therefore affirm that the court erred in allowing this item.</p>\n<p id=\"b145-9\">Appellant\u2019s seventh and eighth assignments, calling in question the admission of certain evidence given by the witness Chew, are not accompanied with either propositions or statements thereunder from the record, and will therefore not be considered. .</p>\n<p id=\"b146-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"124\">*124</page-number>Appellant\u2019s eleventh assignment, which complains of the action of the court in failing to charge the jury not to allow anything for the goods claimed by the Owensboro Wagon Company, can not be sustained, (1) because a failure to charge is ordinarily not reversible error, in the absence of a requested instruction upon the issue, and (2) because we think the charge given the jury upon the subject of goods held upon commission was sufficient,\" in view of the evidence introduced.</p>\n<p id=\"b146-5\">As we find no reversible error presented for our consideration, the judgment of the court below will be affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b146-6\">\n<em>Affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b146-7\">Delivered December 5, 1894.</p>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"21\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"rehearing\">\n<p id=\"b146-8\">ON MOTION EOR REHEARING.</p>\n<author id=\"b146-9\">HEAD, Associate Justice.</author>\n<p id=\"AsZ\">\u2014Appellant asks us to grant it a rehearing herein, because it is claimed that the evidence shows the jury must have taken into consideration about $800 worth of goods which were turned over to the Owensboro Wagon Company, for which no recovery could properly be had.</p>\n<p id=\"b146-10\">It may be. that a careful examination of the statement of facts would show this to have been the case, and that error was therein committed to the prejudice of appellant; but we are of opinion that this question can not be considered by us, in the absence of an assignment of error properly presenting it, and also, because it was not called to the attention of the trial court in the motion for new trial.
