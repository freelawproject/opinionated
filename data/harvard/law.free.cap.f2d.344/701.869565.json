Loan, a railroad fireman, brought an action against his employer, Southern Railway Co., under the Federal Employers\u2019 Liability Act. He alleged in his complaint that the defendant negligently caused him to slip and fall by leaving metal rods on a step leading to the cab of an engine in which he was working. The case was heard by a jury and a verdict was rendered for the defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b755-27\">The charge to the jury was adequate and there was sufficient evidence offered to support its verdict. The testimony of Loan\u2019s ex-wife, even if privileged, was merely cumulative. Independent witnesses abundantly established the facts testified to by the wife. The error of receiving her testimony, if it was error, was not in our opinion sufficient in the entire context of the trial to warrant reversal.</p>\n<p id=\"b755-28\">Affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
