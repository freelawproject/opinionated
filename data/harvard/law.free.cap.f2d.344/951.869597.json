Although the University of Tampa is not a state or city institution in the usual sense, its establishment was largely made possible by the use of a surplus city building and the use of other city land leased for the University purposes. Under Derrington v. Plummer, 5 Cir., 240 F.2d 922, and Hampton v. City of Jacksonville, 5 Cir., 304 F.2d 320, the City\u2019s involvement in the establishment and maintenance was of such a nature as to require a holding that \u201cstate\u201d action under the Fourteenth Amendment was involved in the denial of appellants\u2019 rights.</p>\n<p id=\"b1005-21\">However, during the appeal the University\u2019s governing body has withdrawn racial barriers, and we are informed that some Negro students have been enrolled. Thus, no injunctive order seems to be required to vindicate appellants\u2019 constitutional rights.</p>\n<p id=\"b1005-22\">The judgment is reversed and the case is remanded to the trial court to retain jurisdiction for a reasonable time to permit it to determine that the appellees have commenced to, and will continue to, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"952\">*952</page-number>operate the University in such manner as will not discriminate against the appellants and the class for which they sued. Reversed and remanded.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
