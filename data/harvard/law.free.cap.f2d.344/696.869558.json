Delk, a personal holding company, challenged the Commissioner\u2019s interpretation of the statutory direction in 26 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 545 (b) (5) for computing how much tax was \u201cattributable\u201d to Delk\u2019s capital gains for the years in question. In a carefully considered opinion, Delk Investment Corp. v. United States, D.C.E.D.Mo., 1964, 228 F. Supp. 545, Judge Regan held as did the Commissioner and denied recovery. We would be able to affirm on the basis of Judge Regan\u2019s opinion alone. Nevertheless, in the only other reported case involving the identical question, the Second Circuit in Litchfield Securities Corp. v. United States, 2 Cir., 1963, 325 F.2d 667, certiorari denied, 377 U.S. 931, 84 S.Ct. 1333, 12 L.Ed.2d 295, held as did the District Court here. The policy of this court with regard to uniformity in tax holdings has been stated by us in C. I. R. v. Moran, 8 Cir., 1956, 236 F.2d 595, 596:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b751-15\">\u201c * * * This court has repeatedly held, particularly in tax matters, that the decision of another Court of Appeals should be followed unless demonstrably erroneous or there appear cogent reasons for its rejection. Birmingham v. Geer, 8 Cir., 1950, 185 F.2d 82, 85, cer-tiorari denied 1951, 340 U.S. 951, 71 S.Ct. 571, 95 L.Ed. 686.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b751-17\">As we are in complete accord with Judge Regan\u2019s opinion and with Litchfield, this case is affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
