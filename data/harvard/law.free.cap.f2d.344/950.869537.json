The injunction against denying \u201cadmission to the Defendant Hospital on the basis of race\u201d is limited to forbidding those discriminatory terms or conditions of admission.</p>\n<p id=\"b1004-18\">(2) While the court found that the defendants by their answer admit that they maintain racially segregated dining rooms and toilet facilities for Negro student nurses and employees, its order of injunction does not at this time forbid that practice, but jurisdiction of the action is retained for such further orders as may be required. We do not therefore pass upon the standing of the plaintiff patients to represent the student nurses and employees, or to enjoin the practice so enforced.</p>\n<p id=\"b1004-19\">(3) The retention of jurisdiction by the district court for further orders is broad enough to allow any modification of plans or policies which may be shown by evidence to be required by. .actual experience or sound medical reasons.</p>\n<p id=\"b1004-20\">As so construed, the judgment of the district court is</p>\n<p id=\"b1004-21\">Affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
