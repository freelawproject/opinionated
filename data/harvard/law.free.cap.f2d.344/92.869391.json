He was first tried in April 1961. The trial court set aside the judgment and ordered a new trial. White was again tried and convicted in September 1961. The judgment was affirmed. United States v. White, 304 F.2d 158 (4th Cir. 1962). The sentence imposed was vacated upon a motion under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255. This appeal is from White\u2019s third trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b147-6\">We find no merit in White\u2019s assertion that the trial court failed to comply with 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3500 (Jencks act) The Government produced for inspection the statement made by its witness. No other notes or memorandum made by the witness were available to the United States Attorney. Inquiry made by him to the witness\u2019 supervisors at the direction of the District Court proved fruitless.</p>\n<p id=\"b147-7\">The record of the September 1961 trial showed that the notes used by the witness in preparing his statement were delivered to White\u2019s attorney who used them for cross-examination. White was furnished the transcript of the previous trial in which his attorney used the notes. No intention to suppress evidence was shown. Under these circumstances the Court was not required to strike the witness\u2019 testimony or grant a mistrial. Cf. Killian v. United States, 368 U.S. 231, 82 S.Ct. 302, <em>7 </em>L.Ed.2d 256 (1961); United States v. Greco, 298 F.2d 247 (2nd Cir. 1962); cert. denied 369 U.S. 820, 82 S.Ct. 831, 7 L.Ed.2d 785 (1962).</p>\n<p id=\"b147-8\">At the Court\u2019s direction the Government furnished White the address of a paid informer. We find no error in the Court\u2019s refusal to require the Government to produce and offer the informer as a witness. The evidence does not disclose that the defendant was entrapped or that the informer participated in any undertaking to entrap the defendant. The basis is lacking for the application of the principles expressed in United States V. Ramsey, 220 F.Supp. 86 (E.D.Tenn. 1963), upon which the defendant relies.</p>\n<p id=\"b147-10\">White sought the appointment of counsel to represent him. The District Judge after hearing testimony found that White had adequate resources to provide his own counsel. White then sought leave to proceed in forma pauperis on appeal to this Court from the refusal of the District Judge to appoint counsel for him. Upon consideration of his petition and the Memorandum Opinion of the District Judge, this Court concluded that White has not shown himself to be a pauper or in need of the assistance of appointed counsel. White has shown no additional facts warranting a change in the conclusion previously reached by the District Court and by this Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b147-11\">The judgment is</p>\n<p id=\"b147-12\">Affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
