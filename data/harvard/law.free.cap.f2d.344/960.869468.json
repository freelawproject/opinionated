At the second trial the court concluded that the issue on negligence was for the jury. The latter decided in favor of the plaintiff.</p>\n<p id=\"b1015-18\">Both the merits and damages were argued carefully and precisely on behalf of appellant. The testimony tending to show the proximate fault of the railroad was sparse but under it the court was justified in its conclusion that it presented a factual issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b1015-19\">Appellant argues strongly that the son\u2019s testimony regarding the family services of the father was hearsay. We do not think that the trial judge erred in holding that it was based on first-hand knowledge.</p>\n<p id=\"b1015-20\">The judgment of the district court will be affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
