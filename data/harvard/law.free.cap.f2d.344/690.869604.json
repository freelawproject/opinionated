These affidavits certify that appellee is and has been complying with the Civil <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"692\">*692</page-number>Rights Act of 1964 since immediately after its enactment, and in accordance therewith is and has been serving negro customers without regard to race or color at its cafeteria at 1720 West End Avenue, Nashville, Tennessee.</p>\n<p id=\"b746-4\">Under date of July 10, 1964, the district court remanded the case to the state court by an order which is quoted in the margin.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b746-5\"> We are satisfied that the issues involved on this appeal became moot upon the enactment of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 and the compliance by appellee with that statute, and that the appeal therefore should be dismissed.

Wilbur, 6 Cir., 166 F.2d 884, 885:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b746-7\">\u201c \u2022\u00bb * * js settled that if the question presented by an appeal has become moot the appeal will be dismissed by the appellate court without a ruling on the merits.

The motion to vacate the order of the district court is denied. The appeal is dismissed by the court on its own motion, upon the ground of mootness.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b745-9\">. \u201cOn June 21, 1963, some of the defendants-appellants sought service in plaintiffappellee\u2019s cafeteria and were refused same because of their race. Thereafter, some of the defendants-appellants continued, on several occasions, to seek service, and engaged in activities, such as picketing, to protest the racially discriminatory denials of service by plaintiff-appellee.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b745-10\">\u201cOn April 27, 1964, a protest demonstration was held in and about plaintiff-appellee\u2019s cafeteria by some of the defendants-appellants.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b745-11\">\u201cOn April 28, 1964, plaintiff-appellee filed a bill of complaint against defendants-appellants in the Chancery Court of Davidson County, seeking injunctive relief against these protest demonstrations. A temporary injunction was thereafter issued.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b745-13\">\u201cOn June 1, 1964, defendants-appellants removed the proceeding against them from the Chancery Court of Davidson County to the United States District Court for the Middle District of Tennessee.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b745-20\">\u201cOn July 2, 1964, the Civil Rights Act of 1964, 78 Stat. 241, became law.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b745-21\">\u201cOn July 10, 1964, the Order of the United States District Court for the Middle District of Tennessee, herein appealed from, remanding the cause to the Chancery Court of Davidson County, was entered.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b745-22\">\u201cDefendants-Appellants believe that plaintiff-appellee is presently complying with the Civil Rights Act of 1964, and that plaintiff-appellee\u2019s practices of racial discrimination and segregation have ceased (see attached affidavits). Therefore, defendants-appellants believe that their controversy with plaintiff-appellee, which underlies the Order appealed from herein, has ended, and suggest to this Court that the cause has become moot.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b745-23\">\u201cFor this reason, defendants-appellants move this Court to vacate the judgment below and to dismiss the instant appeal on the ground of mootness.\u201d</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b746-8\">. \u201cIn tlxis action some of the defendants in the state court have filed a petition of removal to this court pursuant to 28 U.S.C.A., Sec. 1446, invoking as the basis of their right of removal 28 U.S. C.A., Sec. 1441 (the general removal statute), and 28 U.S.O.A., Sec. 1443 (a special removal statute applicable in civil rights cases).</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b746-11\">\u201cThe plaintiff has filed a motion to remand the action to the state court on various grounds. First, that the petition for removal was not timely filed; second, that the action is not removable under the removal statutes invoked by the defendants seeking to remove; and third, that all of the defendants in the state court do not join in the petition for removal.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b746-14\">\u201cAfter carefully considering the oral arguments and briefs of the respective parties, the Court is of the opinion that the removal statutes invoked require that all defendants join in the petition for removal unless there exists a separate and independent claim or cause of action, or unless the defendants not joining in the petition are merely nominal or formal parties. Neither exception applies in the instant case. No separate and independent claim or cause of action is set forth in the petition; and the record clearly reflects that a number of defendants served with process and who cannot be classified as nominal parties failed to join in the petition. It is well settled that defendants who have been \u2018both joined and served must join in the petition.\u2019 1A Moore\u2019s Federal Practice, Sec. 0.168, page 1172.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b746-22\">\u201cThe Court can see no basis for holding that the civil rights removal statute relied upon does not require that all defendants join in the removal petition simply because it refers to \u2018the defendant\u2019 rather than to \u2018the defendant or the defendants\u2019 as in the case of the general removal statute. Indeed, it would seem that a stronger case could be made under the wording of the general removal statute in support of the defendants\u2019 position than under the civil rights statute, yet the courts have uniformly held, with the exceptions noted, that all defendants must join in the petition for removal under the general statute. The two statutes should be construed as being in pari' materia.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b746-23\">\u201cIt is, therefore, ordered and adjudged that this action, be, and the same is hereby, remanded to the Chancery Court of Davidson County, Tennessee, Part II.\u201d</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
