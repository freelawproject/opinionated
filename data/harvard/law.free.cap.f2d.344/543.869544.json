The District Court granted leave to appeal in forma pauperis and admitted appellant to bail pending appeal with bond at ipSjOOO.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Appellant alleges that neither he nor his family can provide the premium for a bond in excess of $600. We remanded the record in this case to the District Court.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b598-6\">\u201cwith the request that [it] advise as to the considerations and reasons which led [it]: (1) to seem to find that appellant was a fit subject to be released on bail pending appeal and (2) notwithstanding to set bail in the amount of $3,000.00 in order to \u2018insure the presence of the defendant,\u2019 Rule 46(c), Fed.R.Crim.P., when it appeared from the record that appellant was unable to furnish bail in that amount.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b598-7\">The District Court replied as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AC5c\">\u201cWhen the issue of bail pending appeal was presented to the Court, the initial consideration, in view of appellant\u2019s uncontroverted declaration of indigency, was whether he was a fit subject for release on his own recognizance. While this Court favors release on personal bond whenever it may be justified, the relevant factors in this case precluded such disposition in the Court\u2019s judgment.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b598-8\">\u201cThe most significant considerations which generated the Court\u2019s decision to deny personal bond were the defendant\u2019s unemployment at the time of arrest and his general history of unemployment; the defendant\u2019s lack of substantial family ties in the community (he is unmarried); the defendant\u2019s prior criminal and juvenile records, which include a number of acts of violence and a failure to discharge the responsibilities and take advantage of the opportunities of probationary supervision of the Juvenile Court; the fact that this nineteen-year old faced a substantial period of confinement, albeit at the Youth Center; the fact that, in the Court\u2019s opinion, the evidence weighed very heavily against the defendant; and finally, the absence of any other substantial ties with the local community to counterbalance these negative factors.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b598-10\">\u201cHaving determined that this defendant could not justifiably be released on his personal bond pending appeal, the question then became whether to deny bail altogether, or to set bond in such an amount that <em>if it could be raised, </em>the Court could feel reasonably assured, in the circumstances, that defendant\u2019s presence would, be insured. The Court then believed, and continue to believe upon reconsideration at this time, that bail in the amount of $3,000, if it could be raised by this indigent defendant, would be sufficient to warrant his release pending appeal. Although it may appear inconsistent to set a monetary bond for an indigent, it has been the Court\u2019s experience that indigent defendants are often in the community on bond, having obtained the means therefor from family or friends.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b598-11\">The fact that others in the community have come to a defendant\u2019s aid seems to the Court to create a new tie or contact with the community which <em>tends </em>to insure the presence of the defendant. The defendant\u2019s obligation is then not only to the Court but to those who financed his bond. In this case, if <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"545\">*545</page-number>this new tie to the community could be created, and added to the fact that the defendant has always lived in the District and has never been known to \u2018jump bail,\u2019 plus the always present prospect of apprehension, this would be enough, in the Court\u2019s judgment, to justify his release pending appeal with reasonable assurance that he would respond when necessary.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b599-5\">\u201cIt seems more just to leave open the possibility of release by setting some bond which, if raised, should satisfy the Court and the community that it will serve a purpose, than to take the alternative of denying bond altogether, particularly where the issue of fitness for bond pending appeal is as close a question as it is in this case.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b599-6\">If appellant\u2019s family or friends were able to provide the $8,000 bail without a bondsman, then it may be that Hinton would have an \u201cobligation\u201d to them not to flee. But if, as is more likely, the bail must be furnished by a bondsman, his premium is not refundable whether appellant appears or flees. Hence Hinton\u2019s family or friends would not be affected if he flees. They would be affected, for example, if they were required to post collateral with the bondsman.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> 3 But the court did not inquire whether collateral would be required<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> so that \u201ca new tie to the community would be created\u201d by Hinton\u2019s sense of \u201cobligation * * * to those who financed his bond.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b599-7\">Moreover, it seems to me that a stronger tie than a sense of obligation to those who paid for his bond might be created if the court attempted to impress Hinton\u2019s family or friends with the importance of their representations of trust that Hinton would appear and their willingness to assist in insuring that he will.</p>\n<p id=\"b599-11\">I would hold this motion in abeyance, and remand the record to the District Court for further inquiry and findings of fact, as required by this opinion, to aid our determination of whether bail was \u201cset at a figure higher than an amount reasonably calculated to\u201d insure appellant\u2019s presence. Stack v. Boyle, 342 U.S. 1, 5, 72 S.Ct. 1, 96 L.Ed. 3 (1951). In lieu of such inquiry, the District Court could, if it chose, reconsider its previous determination setting bail at $3,000.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b598-12\">.
