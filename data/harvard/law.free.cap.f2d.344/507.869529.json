He was arrested, charged with the crimes and spent some time in jail before being released when the mistake was discovered. Appellees in their newspapers of wide circulation published accounts of his clearance, giving his name, address and other identifying information, with some details of the resumption of his family life after his ordeal. He sued appellees for damages, claiming that such publications invaded his right of privacy. Appellees\u2019 motions <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"508\">*508</page-number>to dismiss were granted and the complaint was dismissed.</p>\n<p id=\"b562-4\">We think the facts as set forth in the complaint, admitted for purposes of the motion to dismiss, failed to state a cause of action. We therefore affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b562-5\">The publications contain no criticism whatever of appellant. There was not the slightest adverse reflection upon him or suggestion of defamation or ridicule of him. His identification as the victim of the mistake, by including his name and otherwise placing him in his environment did not give rise to a recoverable wrong. The principal events were already in the public domain, and were of news interest. The identifying details were incidental to the story and were not an enlargement which carried the publications beyond legitimate bounds. Elmhurst v. Pearson, 80 U.S.App.D.C. 372, 153 F.2d 467 (1946).</p>\n<p id=\"b562-6\">Affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
