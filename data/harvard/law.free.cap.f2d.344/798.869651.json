BROWN, Circuit Judge:</author>\n<p id=\"b854-11\">In this appeal by Honea from his conviction and sentence of three years plus a fine of $1,000 under an indictment charging a violation of 18 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 912,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> *we reach only one issue \u2014 the sufficiency of the indictment to charge the offense. Answering in the negative, the case must be reversed and we need go no further.</p>\n<p id=\"b854-20\">The indictment was worded:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"ANn\">\u201c * * * on or about March 15, 1961, * * * Forrest Etheridge Honea, hereinafter called defendant, which said defendant was not then and there an officer or employee acting under authority of the United States of America, did unlawfully, knowingly, and feloniously, falsely assume to be an employee under the authority of the United States of America, to wit, an employee of the Central Intelligence Agency, an agency of the United States of America, and in such pretended character, and with full knowledge that the same was false, the said defendant did obtain money, to wit, the sum of $4,000 in cash, from Nellie Oriene May Dunn.\u201d <footnotemark>2</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"pAI0\">By a timely pretrial motion to dismiss, F.R.Crim.P. 12(b)(2), Honea urged that the indictment was \u201cfatally defective\u201d because it failed \u201cto allege that the defendant did the acts with intent to defraud either the United States or any person.\u201d The motion was denied.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b854-24\">At the trial, the evidence revealed that over a period of about two months, Honea, an adventurous rogue, had, under an assumed name and identity first as a retired Colonel which was later embellished by his claim of being a CIA agent, courted and married a young widow, Mrs. Dunn, who among her other attractions had $4,000 from the sale of the equity in her home and $20,000 from her recently deceased husband\u2019s life insurance. Being given to sudden and unexplained sorties about the country which seemed to upset Mrs. Dunn and her married couple friends who took quite an interest in this <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"801\">*801</page-number>whirlwind courtship, Honea, when confronted with his apparent inattentiveness toward his intended, made up the bit about being a CIA agent. The yam had nothing to do with money. Then came the marriage \u2014 a result in which a CIA\u2019s status was not a catalyst. After the marriage she voluntarily let him have $4,000 on the occasion specified in the indictment and cosigned his note for $10,-000 on another (not alleged) \u2014 in each instance the money being advanced to assist Honea in some purported CIA venture. During this same period of time Honea splendidly provisioned Mrs. Dunn, housing her in fine hotels, and lavishly wining, dining, and gifting her \u2014 including a new Pontiac. At Honea\u2019s arrest, he returned to her a substantial portion of the money taken from her.</p>\n<p id=\"b855-5\">The question before the Court really has two parts: (a) is intent to defraud an essential element for an offense under the part [2] of \u00a7 912, and (b) if so, is this indictment fatally defective for failure to include such an allegation.</p>\n<p id=\"b855-6\">Our attention is immediately directed to the fact that in its present re-codified form \u00a7 912 does not in express words require an intent to defraud, and that words to that effect were deleted from the former version of the statute <footnotemark>4</footnotemark> in the 1948 Revision of the Criminal Code. Thus the answer to (a) depends on a painstaking examination of the available resources to determine the intent of the Revisers and, by imputation, Congress, in eliminating this language.</p>\n<p id=\"b855-11\">We know as a general matter that, with few exceptions, the 1948 revision was not intended to effect substantive changes in federal criminal law.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b855-12\">With particular reference to \u00a7 912, note 1, supra, the Revisor\u2019s Note shows that former \u00a7 123 was merged into it, thereby eliminating the separate offense and different punishment for false impersonation of a revenue officer. As appears from a comparison of former \u00a7 76 with \u00a7 912 (see notes 4 and 1, supra), much unneeded verbiage was commendably excised from the statute. And then the Revisers make the key and cryptic statement that \u201cThe words \u2018with the intent to defraud the United States or any <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"802\">*802</page-number>person\u2019, contained in section 76 of Title 18, U.S.C., 1940 ed., were omitted as meaningless in view of United States v. Lapowich [Lepowitch] [1943, 318 U.S. 702], 63 S.Ct. 914, [87 L.Ed. 1091].\u201d The citation is obviously to Lepowitch and apparently refers to the following statement in that opinion:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b856-4\">\u201cWe hold that the words \u2018intent to defraud\u2019 in the context of this statute, do not require more than the defendants have, by artifice and deceit, sought to cause the deceived person to follow some course he would not have pursued but for the deceitful conduct.\u201d <footnotemark>6</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b856-5\">While we may have some doubt that this really renders the fraudulent intent requirement \u201cmeaningless,\u201d as the Revisers expressed it, their reaction to that effect is an understandable one.</p>\n<p id=\"b856-6\">Perhaps of greater concern is what kind of legislative response to Lepowitch, if any, was intended by the deletion of the words \u201cintent to defraud\u201d. In view of the general purpose of the revision and the absence of a more definitive statement as to this particular section, the most unlikely meaning to assign is that the Revisers intended to overrule Lepowitch by re-legislation or to modify the substance of the provision. The Revisers\u2019 rather terse explanation suggests that their intent was \u2014 as is frequently done in codification-revision efforts of this kind \u2014 to make the statutory wording conform to authoritative judicial construction, and to carry forward, by a simplified and streamlined wording of the statute, the Lepowitch statement of what facts would make out a violation of the offense involved in that case.</p>\n<p id=\"b856-7\">With this construction, it is important to analyze carefully the Lepowitch case. As we have previously noted, \u00a7 912 as well as its predecessor contains two separate offenses (as bracketed in note 1, supra), [1] false impersonation and acting as such, and [2] false impersonation and demanding or obtaining property. Our case is under [2], Lepowitch under</p>\n<p id=\"b856-8\">as the Supreme Court so carefully pointed out. In Lepowitch the defendants were charged with impersonating FBI officers and with an attempt to elicit information from an individual in such capacity. The trial court sustained a demurrer to the indictment, raising the legal question whether the facts asserted came within the statute, an issue of statutory construction. Although the indictment contained a second count based on part [2] of \u00a7 76- \u2014 obtaining a valuable thing \u2014 the Government did not ask for review of this aspect of the trial Judge\u2019s ruling. 318 U.S. at 703, n. 2, 63 S.Ct. 914.</p>\n<p id=\"b856-9\"> Since it is the classic posture of courts to hear argument and having heard to answer responsively, we are assisted by noting from the Lawyer's Edition summary of argument the way the Lepowitch appeal was put to the Supreme Court by the lawyers. The defendants\u2019 position was that intent to defraud meant intent to deprive another of money or property (a \u201cvaluable thing\u201d) \u2014 thus lumping together parts [1] and [2] of the statute. It followed from this that there could be no conviction for obtaining, by deceitful false impersonation, information or papers having no value to the giver. This construction would have effectively knocked out one of the vital interests which the statute seeks to protect, namely, the dignity, prestige and importance of federal office. See United States v. Barnow, 1915, 239 U.S. 74, 78, 36 S.Ct. 19, 60 L.Ed. 155. Thus it was important for the Government to distinguish the two offenses, and to make it clear that the first kind of offense \u2014 [1] acting as a federal officer \u2014 could be committed without an intent to wrongfully deprive another of his property.</p>\n<p id=\"b856-10\">In reversing the District Court, the Supreme Court agreed with the Government and made it clear that its definitional statement that intent to defraud means intent to change the course of conduct was applicable only to the type [1] offense.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b857-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"803\">*803</page-number>\u201cThe first [1] clause of this statute, the only one under consideration here, defines one offense; the second [2] clause defines another. While <em>more </em>than mere deceitful attempt to affect the course of action of another is required under the second [2] clause of the statute, which speaks of an intent to obtain a Valuable thing\u2019, the very absence of these words of limitation in the first [1] portion of the act persuade us that under it, a person may be defrauded although he parts with something of no measurable value at all [such as information].\u201d 318 U.S. at 704-705, 63 S.Ct. at 916. (Emphasis supplied.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b857-6\">Viewed in this light, it is obvious that the Supreme Court was not concerned with the quality or intensity of the evil which characterized the false impersonator\u2019s intent, but rather with the object upon which that intent was focused, i. e., whether the intent had to be to obtain a thing of value, or whether an intent to change the course of someone\u2019s conduct would do. Thus the Supreme Court put no gloss on the fraudulent intent requirement where the prosecution is against one who [2] \u201cdemands or obtains\u201d the property of another.</p>\n<p id=\"b857-7\">In \u00a7 76 the introductory words \u201cintent to defraud\u201d applied to both offenses [1] and [2] (see note 4, supra). In the quest for simplification, the Revisers apparently felt that the statute could be restructured by omitting the words which, indeed, were \u201cmeaningless\u201d where the test for [1] \u201cacts as such\u201d would be acting with intent to change the course of another\u2019s conduct. This left the offense [2] subject to Court interpretation as to the precise nature of the intent required. And as to that, what the Supreme Court hinted, and what was clearly required in the statute at that time, we now hold. An intent to defraud or an intent to wrongfully deprive another of property is an essential element for a prosecution under the part. [2] of \u00a7 912.</p>\n<p id=\"b857-8\">To hold otherwise would be to attribute to Congress an intent to greatly expand the scope of the statute so as to include and subject to serious penalty (3 years and/or $1,000) a broad range of possible conduct which, while blameworthy, would not ordinarily be regarded as having the major governmental significance of actions violating part [1]. For example, an ex-Marine, FBI man, PX clerk, Revenue Officer, or law clerk desires to cash a check for which there are funds in the bank, but not being known to the cashier, he flashes his expired Government ID card. Literally, he has \u201cfalsely assum[ed]\u201d to be a federal \u201cofficer or employee\u201d, and \u201cin such pretended character\u201d has \u201cobtain[ed] * * * money * * Certainly Congress could conclude that this should be a federal crime. But we do not believe that Congress in its preoccupation with offense [1] intended purposefully to eliminate the fraudulent intent element as to offense [2] and thereby wreak a change of major significance, both in the moral qualities of the substantive offense and in the punishment. The law frequently has read into a statute this very requirement of fraudulent intent. See Walker v. United States, 5 Cir., 1965, 342 F.2d 22 [Feb. 25, 1965]; White v. Levine, 10 Cir., 1930, 40 F.2d 502, 503. How much more is it justified when it was once formally a part of the statute and its omission occurred in a structural recodification.</p>\n<p id=\"b857-10\">As to whether the absence of an allegation that Honea did the acts in question with intent to defraud makes, this indictment insufficient, our problem is much easier. This Court has recently stated in Walker v. United States, supra:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b857-11\">\u201cIt is elementary that an indictment must set forth the elements of the offense to be charged, and if it does not a conviction based thereon cannot stand.\u201d 342 F.2d at 26.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b857-12\">See also Russell v. United States, 1962, 369 U.S. 749, 763-764, 82 S.Ct. 1038, 8 L.Ed.2d 240; 4 Barron, Federal Practice and Procedure \u00a7 1913 and 1964 Supp. \u00a7 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"804\">*804</page-number>1913 (Wright ed.). \u201cAn indictment or information in the language of the statute [as here] ordinarily is sufficient, except where the words of the statute do not contain all of the essential elements of the offense; but if the statute omits an essential element, the indictment must supply it with certainty.\u201d Babb v. United States, 5 Cir., 218 F.2d 538, 539. One of the laudable reforms of the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure was to eliminate the necessity for much of the cumbersome claptrap which typically encased the common law indictment. See F.R.Cr. P. 7. Yet \u201cthe substantial safeguards to those charged with serious crimes cannot be eradicated under the guise of technical departures from the rules.\u201d Smith v. United States, 1959, 360 U.S. 1, 9, 79 S. Ct. 991, 997, 3 L.Ed.2d 1041. It is often said that an indictment must (a) apprise the defendant of what he will have to meet and (b) protect him from double jeopardy. This indictment is sufficient as to (b), but, as in Russell, insufficient as to (a).</p>\n<p id=\"b858-4\">This has unusual importance in this case because the evidence on Honea\u2019s fraudulent intent \u2014 certainly with regard to the specified instance where he obtained $4,000 from his wife \u2014 if viewed apart from the subsequent uncharged incident,<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> would not have been enough to sustain the conviction. By his jury instructions (see note 3, supra), the trial Judge obviously realized the necessity of this element under the statute. Of course, this did not cure the defect. We could not say with any assurance that the Grand Jury would have returned a true bill had this vital element been brought home to them.</p>\n<p id=\"b858-5\">And finally we note that the Supreme Court approved form for an indictment under \u00a7 912, Form 9, F.R.Cr.P. Appendix of Forms, contains an \u201cintent to defraud\u201d allegation. While not determinative, this indication of what good criminal pleading requires is strong evidence of what the criminal law requires.</p>\n<p id=\"b858-10\">Consequently, the indictment is fatally defective, the conviction thereunder must be set aside, and the indictment must be dismissed.</p>\n<p id=\"b858-11\">Reversed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b854-26\">. The indictment obviously was intended to \u2014 and certainly does no more than\u2014 charge Honea with committing offense [2] under \u00a7 912. See note 1, supra.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b854-27\">. Nevertheless, the Judge charged the jury, as requested by Honea\u2019s counsel, that intent to defraud was a necessary element of the offense.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b854-12\">. \u201cWhoever falsely assumes or pretends to be an officer or employee acting under the authority of the United States or any department, agency or officer thereof, and [1] acts as such, or [2] in such pretended character demands or obtains any money, paper, document, or thing of value, shall be fined not more than $1,000 or imprisoned not more than three years, or both.\u201d Brackets ([1] and [2]) are inserted to facilitate classification and discussion of the two separate kinds of offenses under 5 912.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b855-7\">.
