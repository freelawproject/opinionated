The District Court for the Eastern District of Washington, Northern Division, held the patent to be valid but not infringed. Appellees challenge the first holding. Appellant appeals from the second.</p>\n<p id=\"b68-9\">The device in question is for the forming of concrete pipe in place for use in irrigation and drainage systems. By means of the device pipe is formed by the following method: A ditch is dug, conforming to the outer dimensions of the pipe. Concrete is fed into the ditch around an inner core or form which is removed after the concrete has set. This method, in general, is not new in the art. What is new is the fact that the device permits a continuous operation. New pipe is continuously poured while the already formed pipe, is still hardening. Thus it is not necessary to permit one section of the pipe to harden before passing on to the pouring of a new section. Also, the top, bottom and sides of the pipe are formed simultaneously. This is accomplished by pouring concrete through a hopper around a conduit through which overlapping sections of the inner core are continuously fed, with the entire device resting on the bed of the ditch and steadily advancing along the ditch by means of a powered winch.</p>\n<p id=\"b68-16\">The District Court has found that although it is a combination of old elements, this patent is valid \u201cbecause it has a new modus operandi which produces an improved result in a more facile, economic and efficient way.\u201d This finding is not clearly erroneous. We conclude that the District Court was not in error in ruling appellant\u2019s patent to be valid, and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"15\">*15</page-number>direct our attention to the question infringement. of</p>\n<p id=\"b69-3\">The accused device adopts appellant\u2019s method, which, the record makes clear, was a decided advance, enthusiastically embraced by the public.</p>\n<p id=\"b69-4\">There is, however, one difference in the details of the competing devices around which the issues here revolve. This relates to the inner form or core, which is fed through the conduit. In the patented device the core is in two pieces. The upper portion is fed through the conduit in overlapping sections and remains stationary, supporting the upper portion of the pipe until the concrete has hardened. It stays behind (as the device moves forward along the ditch) and is removed later. The lower .portion .of.-the inner core is attached to the-device-and moves with it, leaving exposed the lower portion of the pipe.</p>\n<p id=\"b69-5\">In the method adopted by the accused device a one-piece, full-circle inner core is fed through the conduit in overlapping sections and in its entirety remains behind, stationary in the pipe, until the concrete has set.</p>\n<p id=\"b69-6\">Upon the appeal the sole question is presented by appellant\u2019s contention that appellees\u2019 one-piece inner core is the mechanical equivalent of appellant\u2019s two-piece core. The District Court has ruled that it was not.</p>\n<p id=\"b69-7\"> In this we feel that the District Court has erred. Both cores accomplish precisely the same function of providing the inner form for the pipe. Both, in the words of appellant\u2019s Claim 1, are composed of \u201ca plurality of sections releasably secured together * * * and extending through the barrier [i. e., fed through what we have termed the \u201cconduit\u201d] in slidable, sealing engagement therewith.\u201d Thus both permit of a continuous operation by virtue of their composition and the manner in which they are introduced into the ditch. A substantial body of law recognizes that infringement is not avoided by making into one part that which has been shown as two.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b69-9\">Appellees contend that the cores accomplish an important secondary purpose, and do so in different ways, and that this prevents the doctrine of equivalents from applying. Appellees refer to the manner in which the bottom of the pipe is formed. The problem here is that of assuring that the concrete has fully reached and compacted below the inner core. The patented device accomplishes this by a removable vibrator and tampers. Also, however, it is apparent that the movable lower inner core does, in its motion over the concrete, accomplish a compacting, spreading and trowelling of the bottom of the pipe against the underlying ditch. This trowelling action is absent in the accused device, which operates by means of mechanically activated \u201cconsolidating rings\u201d upon which appel-lees have secured a patent. Appellees also point out that each form of inner core has its advantages over the other.</p>\n<p id=\"b69-10\">But it is not the form of inner core (whether one or two pieces \u2014 whether wholly stationary until setting has occurred or only partially stationary) which accomplishes any different result. The function of the core is simply to serve as a form around which the concrete is compacted or consolidated. That which accomplishes a different result is the means chosen in collaboration with the inner core for compacting or consolidating the concrete forming the bottom of the pipe. That appellees may have found <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"16\">*16</page-number>and patented an improved method of compacting concrete around the core does not preclude their one-piece core from being the mechanical equivalent of appellant\u2019s two-piece core.</p>\n<p id=\"b70-4\">Nor does the fact that each core has its advantages over the other per se prevent application of the doctrine of equivalents in every case. Whenever equivalents present themselves a choice is presented and every choice presumably is governed by the chooser\u2019s view as to what is preferable or advantageous. Here the respective advantages were not of such dimensions as to amount to the accomplishment of different results.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b70-5\">Appellees\u2019 contentions would have the effect of limiting the scope of appellant\u2019s invention to the manner chosen for compacting the concrete. The claimed combination encompasses a far greater area of novelty and invention than that.</p>\n<p id=\"b70-6\">Appellees contend that file-wrapper estoppel precludes appellant from asserting the doctrine of equivalents as to the form of inner core and limits appellant\u2019s claim to the precise inner core specified. The District Court so held. In this respect, too, we feel that the District Court was in error.</p>\n<p id=\"b70-12\">The application for the Tunsen (appellant\u2019s) patent originally included broad method claims<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> 5and apparatus claims<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> which were rejected by the Patent Office as being so broad as to encompass prior art. Specifically, the examiner at this point was concerned with a prior Ran-some patent which disclosed a method of in-place pouring of concrete pipe. The Ransome method was not continuous. The bottom was poured first and then the top, or cap. One section had to set before the apparatus could be moved on to a new section. Tunsen\u2019s original claims were stated so broadly as to encompass this intermittent method.</p>\n<p id=\"b70-13\">Certain of these claims were then withdrawn by Tunsen. One of the original claims was amended to specify <em>simultaneous </em>motion of the upper outer form and lower inner form. It is the remarks of Tunsen in support of this amendment upon which appellees principally rely in their contentions of estoppel.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b70-14\">The examiner was not persuaded. In the next action which he took <em>all </em>claims were rejected for lack of invention over other Ransome patents. Tunsen started all over again, confining his claims to apparatus claims. One statement made <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"17\">*17</page-number>by Tunsen in his remarks in support of these claims is singled out by appellees: \u201cAll of the claims bring out the idea of a barrier moving along a ditch and carrying an outer form and part of the inner form, the other part of the inner form being temporarily left in place in the formed conduit. The stationary parts of the inner form slidably extend through the barrier and over the movable parts of the inner form carried by the barrier.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b71-5\">In specific relation to Ransome, however, the remarks state:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b71-6\">\u201cRansome * * * [shows] an apparatus for first forming the bottom of the conduit, and then subsequently forming the sides and then subsequently forming the top. It is true that Ransome \u2014 517,808 does show the idea of temporarily leaving part of the inner form in the conduit, but that is the extent of the similarity to applicant\u2019s invention. Ransome \u2014 517,808 cannot form the top, bottom and sides of a conduit simultaneously, but must form them in sequence and as a result of this the apparatus is complicated and expensive. Applicant\u2019s construction is first much simpler and less expensive than Ransome\u2019s, and besides it permits the simultaneous formation of the top, bottom and sides of the conduit to obtain a sounder conduit in that, for instance, dirt cannot fall on exposed partially formed side walls as is the case in Ransome.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b71-9\">Clearly, the provision for a movable lower inner form was not included for the purpose of escaping Ransome, nor relied upon at this point as differentiation. Indeed, Tunsen felt called upon to justify the fact that Ransome also left \u201cpart of the inner form\u201d in the pipe. What Tun-sen did rely upon was the fact that Ran-some did not permit the simultaneous pouring of a complete pipe.</p>\n<p id=\"b71-10\">The examiner still was not persuaded. All claims again were rejected \u201cas unpat-entable over Ransome * * * in view of Boyle and Carr.\u201d Further, the examiner stated, \u201cApplicant states that Ransome cannot form the top, bottom and sides of the conduit simultaneously, but he fails to state why and he fails to point out any statement in the Ransome patent indicating that the parts of the conduit must be formed in sequence.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b71-11\">In response to this action Tunsen adhered to his claims (subject to certain minor amendments to meet the examiner\u2019s further charge of indefiniteness and \u201cinformality\u201d). In his remarks<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> he emphasized and reiterated that the ad-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"18\">*18</page-number>vanee over Ransome, Boyle and Carr was in \u201ccontinuously forming a complete pipe\u201d and pointed out how the cited prior art failed to accomplish this result.</p>\n<p id=\"b72-4\">The claims in issue were then allowed.</p>\n<p id=\"b72-5\">From these facts it is apparent that the narrowing and redefinition of his claims by Tunsen in order to escape cited prior art did not relate to a movable lower inner form. This movable portion had been claimed from the outset. (See original Claim 8, footnote 5, supra.) The redefinition was for the purpose of limiting the claimed apparatus to one which would continuously form a complete pipe. In our judgment the doctrine of file-wrapper estoppel is not applicable upon these facts. International Mfg. Co. v. Landon, 336 F.2d 723, 727 (9 Cir. 1964); cf., M. O. S. Corp. v. John I. Haas Co. Inc., 332 F.2d 910 (9 Cir. 1964).</p>\n<p id=\"b72-6\">We conclude that the doctrine of equivalents applies to the facts of this case and that appellees\u2019 device is in infringement of appellant\u2019s valid patent.</p>\n<p id=\"b72-7\">Judgment reversed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b68-10\"> Tunsen patent No. 2,731,698 issued January 24, 1956.

The two-piece core had the advantages of trowelling the bottom portion of pipe and of leaving it briefly exposed to view so that the condition of its formation was continuously unfolded as the device moved forward along the ditch. The one-piece core provided continuing inner support and cover for the bottom of the pipe until it had set, which was of advantage in case the ditch was wet or exposed to water.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b70-8\">. Original Claim 1 read:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b70-9\">\u201cThe method of producing a conduit, which comprises forming a ditch with a bottom conforming to the shape of the finished conduit, placing an inner form in said ditch spaced from said bottom, depositing cementitious material around said inner form and upon said bottom, and removing said inner form after said cementitious material has become form sustaining.\u201d</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b70-10\">.

Clearly such an operation is not possible with the Ransome disclosure. In order for such an operation to take place, the core must also be moving, yet Ransome clearly requires the core to remain stationary while the invert and cap sufficiently harden to be form-sustaining. Further, it should be noted that Ransome requires that the core be collapsed before moving it forward, thereby allowing free movement of the core out of the hardened conduit. Claims 9 and 10 have been amended to include means for simultaneously moving said outer form and lower section of the inner form. Such means are not suggested by Ransome.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b71-7\">. \u201cClaims 22 to 26 and 29 to 31 were rejected as being unpatentable over Ran-some 517,808 in view of Boyle and Carr. Inasmuch as none of these patents provides apparatus capable of producing a complete pipe in a continuous fashion, it is believed that their combination would likewise fail to provide such an apparatus. In the case of the Ransome patent, there is insufficient disclosure regarding the form structure to ascertain just how the appartus operates. This particular patent is devoted to the formation of a helical reinforcing material. By reference to an earlier patent to the same inventor, 353,500, the manner of molding the pipe itself becomes clear. In this earlier patent it appears that the concrete is laid up by hand or otherwise 1 formed on the sides of the ditch to a shape approximating that of the mold and to a length equal to or shorter than the mold. There is no disclosure of the underlying thought in these Ransome patents of continuously forming a complete pipe nor of apparatus capable of doing so. Similarly, there are two pieces of apparatus in the Carr patent sequentially employed to form the lower portion of the pipe and then the upper portion. There is no apparatus in this patent that would possibly produce a complete pipe continuously. Similarly, in Boyle the operation is necessarily intermittent since there is no way to move an outer mold relative to an inner mold nor to add sections to an inner mold as is contemplated in the present application.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b71-13\">\u201cIt is quite probable that by removing the informalities to which the Examiner in the last Official Action, the grounds of rejection predicated upon these patents will have been overcome.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b71-14\">\u201cUpon careful consideration of the claims as now presented, it is believed that the Examiner will be justified in passing the application for issue. Such action is requested at an early date.\u201d</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
