MILLER, Circuit Judge, dissents.</p>\n<p id=\"b216-6\">Memorandum Opinion</p>\n<author id=\"b216-7\">BAZELON, Chief Judge.</author>\n<p id=\"b216-8\">The Government moves for leave to file a supplemental memorandum -submitted, in part, in answer to a question from the bench regarding a policeman\u2019s apparently false testimony at a preliminary hearing before the United States Commissioner. The suggestion of falsity arose from a reading of the Commissioner\u2019s summary of the hearing contained in the \u201cRecord of Proceedings\u201d (Admin. Off. Form 100) filed with the District Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b216-9\">The Government now seeks to demonstrate the absence of any perjury by submitting an exhibit consisting of (1) what is asserted to be a photographically reproduced copy of the Commissioner\u2019s handwritten notes, containing much material not included in the filed \u201cRecord,\u201d and (2) a typewritten interpretation and elaboration of the notes. Neither part is signed nor sworn to, nor is it indicated whether any matter, such as the typewritten heading on the notes, was added after the hearing.</p>\n<p id=\"b216-10\">Rule 5(c), FED.R.CRIM.P., requires that \u201c[a]fter concluding the proceeding the commissioner shall transmit forthwith to the clerk of the district court <em>all papers </em>in the proceeding * * (Emphasis supplied.) The Manual for United States Commissioners<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> p. 23, states: \u201cImmediately thereafter^ the commissioner is required to transmit to the clerk of court <em>his file on, the .case, </em>including * * * his completed transcript which consists of verbatim copies * <em>* * </em>of all his successive docket entries in the case * * . .(Emphasis supplied). The Manual also, states: \u201cIn the absence of a stenographer it is well for the commissioner to take such notes of the testimony and evidence and make such minutes of the proceeding as may be essential for the purpose of an adequate record.\u201d (p. 10.)</p>\n<p id=\"b216-15\"> Thus it is clear that the Commissioner has a responsibility to keep a detailed account of the proceedings before him, and to file that account with the clerk. The defendant, his then counsel or his later acquired counsel, or a court asked to consider a charged defect in the Commissioner\u2019s proceedings, should be able to judge from the record filed whether the proceedings were regu<em>lar </em>\u2014 i. <em>e., </em>what warnings were given, what requests were made, what rulings were issued, what waivers were entered \u2014and should be able to determine what the substance of the evidence on both sides was. In fairness to all parties, especially when the Government is represented by counsel and the defendant is not, as much information as possible should be recorded, and all that information should be contained in the typed \u201crecord\u201d form, unless the Commissioner\u2019s notes themselves are filed.</p>\n<p id=\"b216-16\">In the present case, for instance, a lawyer entering the case shortly after the preliminary hearing might have concluded from the \u201crecord\u201d that his client was being held pursuant to a finding of probable cause based on testimony by a witness who was perjuring himself or <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"163\">*163</page-number>who could have had no knowledge of the matters to which he was testifying. He might thus have sought habeas corpus to test the detention, or mandamus to re-open the Commissioner\u2019s proceedings. The District Court, the United States Attorney, and the United States Commissioner would have been put to the trouble of dealing with the matter until the true facts could be ascertained. Of course, this would all have been prevented from the beginning had the Commissioner\u2019s \u201crecord\u201d included in full the contents of his notes of the testimony upon direct examination and upon cross-examination.</p>\n<p id=\"b217-5\">On the other hand, had such an attorney inspected the Form 100 to determine whether the proceedings were regular, he would <em>not </em>have seen that, in fact, before the defendants \u2014 as the form shows\u2014 \u201crequested a hearing now,\u201d they also\u2014 according to the notes \u2014 had \u201cTalked about Dwyers [attorneys named Dwyer?]\u201d (bracketed words are from the elaboration), and about \u201cLegal Aid,\u201d and \u201cthen asked purpose of hearing.\u201d Had this information appeared on the Form 100, the attorney would have been obligated to ascertain, by asking the defendants to amplify these specific references, whether they had intelligently waived their right to counsel.</p>\n<p id=\"b217-6\">If the material in the notes had been included on the Form 100 filed in the District Court, it would be properly before us in the record. In order for us to accept the lodged exhibit now, however, it must be properly authenticated. Thus we will not allow the supplemental memorandum to be filed without an affidavit showing that the photocopy is a true copy of the Commissioner\u2019s contemporaneous notes, with any subsequent additions specified, and that the interpretation of the notes is confirmed by the Commissioner.</p>\n<p id=\"b217-7\">WILBUR K. MILLER, Circuit Judge, dissents. He would affirm.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b216-11\">.
