Rule 52(a), Fed.R.Crim.P. I should like, however, to add a comment.</p>\n<p id=\"b596-27\">For some time now I have been curious and concerned about evidence offered by the Government, appearing again and again in criminal case records, showing that the defendant, at the lineup or other confrontation with the complaining witness, had, while in the presence and custody of the police, \u201cspontaneously and voluntarily\u201d apologized for his misdeed. The word \u201capologize\u201d would not ordinarily be expected to be in the vocabularies of most of the poorly educated defendants. And even if it were, it seemed more than passing strange, to me at least, that this phenomenon of contrition should assert itself so soon after the offensive act.</p>\n<p id=\"b596-28\">I began a search to solve this mystery. My efforts were first rewarded by my discovery of the case styled Fredricksen v. United States, 105 U.S.App.D.C. 262, 266 F.2d 463 (1959), in which a statement made by the accused at the lineup was ruled admissible over a Mallory<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> objection. This court held that a violation of Rule 5(a), Fed.R.Crim.P., did not preclude the admission of the statement because it was made \u201cspontaneously\u201d and not as a result of interrogation, suggestion or instigation of the police.</p>\n<p id=\"b596-29\">Since our ruling in <em>Fredricksen, </em>and particularly in the more recent past, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"543\">*543</page-number>\u201cspontaneous\u201d \u00e1pologi\u00e9s by defendants have been offered by the Government and received in evidence in criminal cases<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> with Unusual frequency \u2014 usually supported by testimony that the apologies' were not suggested or inspired by the police.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> 3 Thus my discovery of <em>Fredrick-sen </em>and the raft of apology cases which followed it deepened, rather than solved, the apology mystery.</p>\n<p id=\"b597-5\">But like all good mystery stories, this one apparently was just becoming most inscrutable immediately before solution. For the solution may have been provided by the present case. The record here shows that all the defendants,<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> on confrontation immediately after their arrest, \u201capologized\u201d to the victims of the robbery. At least six times the jury was told in detail about these apologies. And the police all testified that the apologies were neither suggested nor inspired by them.</p>\n<p id=\"b597-6\">But one of the victims of the robbery testified as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b597-7\">\u201cBy Me. French :</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b597-8\">\u201cQ All right. Now, did the police officers do anything to encourage these defendants to go up to you and apologize?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b597-9\">\u201cA They asked \u2014 the policeman asked them, \u2018Do you want to say anything to the people?\u2019 And they kept quiet. They said, \u2018Don\u2019t you want to say anything?\u2019 So, he says, \u2018Well, I apologize.\u2019</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b597-12\">\u201cThe Court: Who said that?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b597-13\">\u201cThe Witness : All three of them said the same thing.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b597-18\">This testimony is particularly interesting since each of the defendants w\u00e1s brought before the victims of the robbery separately. Yet each of them remembered to apologize.</p>\n<p id=\"b597-19\">In view of the above, it appears to me that the time is ripe for some soul searching in the prosecutor\u2019s office before it offers any more \u201cspontaneous\u201d apologies in evidence.</p>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b597-14\">. Apologies under circumstances similar to those in this case were involved in several recent cases in this court. See Ford and Kimble v. United States, Nos. 17,-835-6 (appeal pending); Copeland v. United States, 120 U.S.App.D.C. -, 343 F.2d 287 (Nos. 18496-7, decided December 31, 1964); Ricks v. United States, 118 U.S.App.D.C. 216, 334 F.2d 964 (1964). In addition, apologies appear in the transcripts of the trials in the following appeals pending in this court: O\u2019Hanlon v. United States, No. 18,325; Engram v. United States, Misc. No. 2340. See also United States v. Walker, D.D.C., Criminal No. 1078-63 (verdict of acquittal returned March 21, 1964); Fuller v. District of Columbia, D.C.C.A., No. 3542, decided November 20, 1964.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b597-33\">. The defendants, of course, have not always agreed that their apologies, if made at all, were spontaneous and self-inspired.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b597-34\">.
