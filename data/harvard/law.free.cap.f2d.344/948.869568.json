He brought this habeas corpus proceeding in the United States District Court for the District of New Mexico, alleging that his state sentence is void because he was not represented by counsel at a preliminary hearing before a New Mexico magistrate. He was represented by counsel thereafter. He pleaded not guilty in the state district court and was convicted by a jury. The question raised has been settled in cases presenting the identical question. Gallegos v. Cox, 10 Cir., 341 F.2d 107; Downing v. New Mexico Supreme Court, 10 Cir., 339 F.2d 435; Lark and Stewart v. Cox, 10 Cir., 344 F.2d 947. Romero\u2019s contention that he was denied a constitutional right at the preliminary hearing because he was required to plead to the charge without an attorney is without merit. No facts are alleged which show any prejudice because of this plea. Gallegos v. Cox, supra. Pointer v. State of Texas, 85 S.Ct. 1065, is not to the contrary.</p>\n<p id=\"b1002-21\">Affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
