On February 6, 1964, appellant filed a motion to vacate the voluntary dismissal on the ground that he was induced by mistake to consent thereto. The District Court denied the motion, and appellant here alleges that it abused its discretion in so doing.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b248-26\">ing prejudice arising from a possible conflict of interest deriving from Laughlin\u2019s dual status.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b249-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"195\">*195</page-number> Since appellant\u2019s motion alleges mistake as the basis for relief, the one-year limitation under Rule 60(b) (1), Fed.R.Civ.P., is applicable. Here the motion was filed more than three years after the dismissal of his action. Appellant\u2019s argument that the dismissal may also be vacated under Rule 60(b) (6), Fed.R.Civ.P., which permits the setting aside of final judgments for \u201cany other reason justifying relief from the operation of the judgment,\u201d is without merit. There is no showing here of the extraordinary circumstances required for relief under Rule 60(b) (6). See Ackermann v. United States, 340 U.S. 193, 202, 71 S.Ct. 209, 95 L.Ed. 207 (1950).</p>\n<p id=\"b249-5\">Affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b248-28\">. 60 Stat. 927, 50 U.S.C.App. \u00a7 34(f).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
