The Tax Court rested its decision in this case on Henry C. Beck Builders, Inc. v. Commissioner, 41 T.C. 616 (1964), a decision by the full court (five members dissenting) in which the material facts and the arguments made by the parties were identical to those in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b178-11\">We have considered-the-able and exhaustive briefs of the parties and the arguments before this court; we find ourselves in agreement with the decision of the Tax Court for the reasons set forth in the opinion for the majority in the Beck case. Therefore the decision of the Tax Court is</p>\n<p id=\"Akn\">Affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b178-10\">. 1964 P-H T.C. Memo.
