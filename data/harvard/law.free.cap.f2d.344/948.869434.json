Its brief in support of its petition for enforcement reviews the evidence and authorities in support of its order.</p>\n<p id=\"b1003-15\">Respondent\u2019s brief makes no response on the merits, and relies solely on the contention that the unfair labor practice complaint involved in the case occurred more than six months prior to the filing of the charge with the Board, by reason of which, under Section 10(b) of the Act, Section 160(b), Title 29, United States Code, the Board was barred from issuing the complaint. In support of this contention, the alleged unfair labor practice is analyzed and discussed at some length.</p>\n<p id=\"b1003-16\">The Board, in response, points out that this objection was not raised before the Board and that under Section 10 (e) of the Act, Section 160(e), Title 29, United States Code, shall not be considered by the Court. We agree with this contention of the Board. N. L. R. B. v. Ochoa Fertilizer Corp., 368 U.S. 318, 322, 82 S.Ct. 344, 7 L.Ed.2d 312; N. L. R. B. v. Globe-Wernicke Systems Co., etc., 336 F.2d 589, C.A. 6th.</p>\n<p id=\"b1003-17\">Since respondent\u2019s brief failed to challenge the Board\u2019s order on the merits, that issue is considered as having been abandoned and will not be considered by the Court on this review.

Commissioner of Internal Revenue, 262 F.2d 134, 139, C.A. 6th, cert. denied, 359 U.S. 991, 79 S.Ct. 1120, 3 L.Ed.2d 979; Viles v. Commissioner of Internal Revenue, 233 F.2d 376, 379, C.A. 6th.</p>\n<p id=\"b1003-18\">Decree of enforcement will be entered.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
