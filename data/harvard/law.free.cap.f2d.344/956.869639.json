We cannot find that, on an issue depending so heavily on credibility and demeanor determinations, the findings were clearly erroneous.</p>\n<p id=\"b1010-21\">The trial court did not err in dismissing the third count of the complaint.</p>\n<p id=\"b1010-22\">The judgment is affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
