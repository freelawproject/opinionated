Count (1) charged Leo Stern with violating 29 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 186(a). He pleaded guilty and testified against his co-defendants. Count (2) charged Gard with violating \u00a7 186(b), and count (3) charged Kanuka with violating \u00a7 186(b) and also 18 U.S. C.A. \u00a7 2 (aiding and abetting Gard). Specifically, Gard and Kanuka, who were agents and representatives of Local 810, Steel, Metals, Alloys &amp; Hardware Fabricators and Warehousemen, International Brotherhood of Teamsters, were convicted for demanding and agreeing to receive $1500 from Stern, as president of Art Metalcrafts, Inc., the employer of workers represented by Local 810. The appellants were sentenced to six months imprisonment but execution of the sentence was suspended and each appellant was placed on probation for three years. Each was also fined $1500.</p>\n<p id=\"b175-26\">Both appellants argue that there is no substantial evidence to sup<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"122\">*122</page-number>port the judgments. Stern\u2019s testimony, at trial and before the grand jury, is full of contradictory statements, but what part of the testimony of a witness is to be believed, is for the trier of the facts to determine and his determination will not be upset on appeal except under extraordinary circumstances. United States v. Johnson, 327 U.S. 106, 111-112, 66 S.Ct. 464, 90 L.Ed. 562; United States v. Stromberg, 2 Cir., 268 F.2d 256, 266-267, cert. den. Lessa v. United States, 361 U.S. 863, 80 S.Ct. 119, 4 L.Ed.2d 102. No extraordinary circumstances appear in the case at bar. Indeed there is evidence which corroborates Stern\u2019s testimony, particularly the testimony of his secretary, Miss Stafford, and of Harold Piesman, Metalcrafts\u2019 vice-president.</p>\n<p id=\"b176-4\">The indictment charged in count (1) that on or about April 5, 1961 Stern, an employer, unlawfully paid and agreed to pay $1500 to Gard and Kanuka, business agents of Local 810. Counts (2) and (3) (Charged the union representatives respectively with agreeing to accept and accepting the $1500. The evidence proved that the money was not paid them un-til several months after the agreement was made late in March 1961.</p>\n<p id=\"b176-5\">Judge Tyler made findings of fact and conclusions of law in a memorandum \u25a0opinion not yet published. He found that the union representatives and Stern made an unlawful agreement to obtain a favorable collective bargaining contract for Metalcrafts on or about April 5, 1961, but held that the dates of the various payments \u201care so far removed from the indictment pleaded date as to work an impermissible variance respecting the \u25a0charges of \u2018receiving\u2019 and \u2018accepting\u2019 by \u2022the two defendants in question.\u201d How-ever, proof of such payments or receipt and acceptance of the cash was permitted Iby the court \u201cto throw light upon the ^relevant and permissible charges of \u2018re.quests,\u2019 \u2018demands\u2019 and \u2018agreements to \u2022receive and accept\u2019 by Gard and Kanuka.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b176-6\">The appellants contend that the admission of such proof requires re-</p>\n<p id=\"b176-7\">versal of the judgments of conviction. We disagree. In United States v. Agueci, 2 Cir., 310 F.2d 817, cert. den. Guippone v. United States, 372 U.S. 959, 83 S.Ct. 1013, 10 L.Ed.2d 11, we held that \u201cThe material inquiry is not the existence but the prejudicial effect of the variance.\u201d The evidence of the actual receipt of money was admitted solely to prove the existence of the agreement made on or about April 5, 1961. For that purpose the evidence was relevant. See United States v. Rabinowich, 238 U.S. 78, 35 S.Ct. 682, 59 L.Ed. 1211; United States v. Annunziato, 2 Cir., 293 F.2d 373, 379, cert. den. 368 U.S. 919, 82 S.Ct. 240, 7 L.Ed.2d 134. Nor can there be any claim of prejudicial surprise by the proof of post-April 5 events; the appellants were granted a continuance but thereafter introduced no evidence to rebut the government\u2019s proof that the payments were made pursuant to the agreement.</p>\n<p id=\"b176-8\">Similarly, we reject the contention that the trial judge committed reversible error in admitting certain post-agreement statements made by Stern when Gard and Kanuka were not present. These statements to Piesman and Miss Stafford were clearly admissible because so closely tied to furtherance of the unlawful agreement. See United States v. Annunziato, supra; cf. United States v. Marchisio, 344 F.2d 653 (2 Cir. April 9, 1965). Thus, Piesman\u2019s approval was required as a fellow officer and it was necessary to inform Miss Stafford not only to eliminate suspicions but because she was charged with handling many of the details.</p>\n<p id=\"b176-9\">Appellants urge as another ground for reversal admission of testimony of Miss Stafford as to telephone conversations she overheard between Stern and appellant Gard. There was testimony that Stern gave his consent to her listening. Hence 47 U.S.C. \u00a7 605 has no application.</p>\n<p id=\"b176-10\">With respect to other contentions of appellants it will suffice to say that we think them so lacking in merit as to deserve no discussion.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
