The Commission found that Tager wilfully violated the anti-fraud and anti-manipulative provisions of \u00a7 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933, 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 77q(a), of \u00a7\u00a7 10(b) and 15(c) (1) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, 15 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 78j(b), 78o(c) (1), and Rules 10b-5, 10b-6 and 15cl-2 thereunder (17 C.F.R. \u00a7\u00a7 240.10b-5, 240.10b-6, 140.15cl-2). Tager argues that his violations of the Securities Acts were not \u201cwillful\u201d as required by statute, and that the sanctions imposed by the Commission exceed the legally permissible limit. We resolve these issues against Tager and affirm the order of the Commission.</p>\n<p id=\"b61-10\">The evidence before the hearing examiner was substantially uncontroverted. In August 1960, Tager (doing business as Tager Company) agreed to underwrite the sale of 68,000 shares of Diversified Capital Corporation. The shares were to sell at $4 each, with Tager retaining 60 cents commission and an expense allowance of 20 cents for each share sold. After a short period of generally unsuccessful efforts by Tager to sell the stock, Diversified\u2019s president suggested that bid and asked quotations by other brokers and dealers appear in the sheets published by the National Quotations Bureau.</p>\n<p id=\"b61-12\">Tager approached Darius Incorporated and Englander &amp; Co., Inc., and persuaded them to insert quotations in the sheets at prices set by Tager. Tager also promised that he would attempt to find buyers and sellers for Darius. From September 15 through October 4, 1960, one or both firms inserted prices of 3% bid and <em>4y2 </em>asked; from October 5 to November 4, 4 to 4%; from November 5 to November 14, 3% to 4% or 4%. Two customers were recommended to Darius by Tager during this period. When Tager was advised by his attorney that his arrangement with Darius and Englander \u201cwas not right,\u201d he conveyed this information to the firms. Englander ceased entering prices for Diversified in the sheets on October 17,1960; Darius ceased on November 14, 1960.</p>\n<p id=\"b61-13\">Shortly after terminating its price quotations for Diversified stock, Eng-lander purchased 100 shares of Diversified from Darius, which had acquired them as a result of its bids. About a month later, Tager\u2019s wife, on Tager\u2019s suggestion, purchased these shares from Englander. Tager testified that Eng-lander did not know what to do with the stock \u201cso I said that I would take it from him.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b61-14\">The total trading in Diversified involving Darius and Englander amounted to 406 shares. Englander bought and sold 100 shares and Darius bought and sold 306 shares, all at around $4 per share. Darius made a $15 profit; Englander made none.</p>\n<p id=\"b61-15\">In December 1960 Tager withdrew as underwriter, having ceased to sell Diversified stock in November. As underwrit<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"8\">*8</page-number>er Tager sold 11,647 shares of Diversified to 81 investors, for a total of $46,588, out of which he retained $9,318. From September 15 through November 14, 1960, when quotations were being entered by Darius and Englander, Tager sold 7,062 shares to 48 investors, for a total of $28,248, out of which he retained $5,650.</p>\n<p id=\"b62-4\">Tager admitted' that he told some investors that there was a market in the stock during the period when Darius and Englander were placing quotations and that he never disclosed that a market was being made at his request.</p>\n<p id=\"b62-5\">The Commission found that Tager had unlawfully stimulated the insertion of quotations which led to a false appearance of market activity in Diversified, which he was then underwriting, had failed to disclose this fact to his customers, and had unlawfully purchased 100 shares of Diversified during the period when he acted as underwriter. Ta-ger does not challenge these conclusions, but argues that revocation of his broker-dealer registration was inappropriate as his actions were not willful.</p>\n<p id=\"b62-6\">One of the grounds for revocation of a broker-dealer registration, and the only one applicable here, \u00a7 15(b) (1) (2) (D) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 78o(b) (1) (2) (D), is that the broker or dealer \u201chas willfully violated any provisions of the Securities Act of 1933, or of this chapter, or of any rule or regulation thereunder.\u201d Tager maintains that \u201cto show willfulness, the Commission would have to show that Tager had an understanding that such activities were manipulative.\u201d We find this argument wholly lacking in merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b62-7\"> It has been uniformly held that \u201cwillfully\u201d in this context means intentionally committing the act which constitutes the violation. There is no requirement that the actor also be aware that he is violating one of the Rules or Acts. Gilligan, Will &amp; Co. v. SEC, 267 F.2d 461, 468 (2 Cir.), cert. denied, 361 U.S. 896, 80 S.Ct. 200, 4 L.Ed.2d 152 (1959); Hughes v. SEC, 85 U.S.App.D.C. 56, 174 F.2d 969, 977 (1949); 2 Loss, Securities Regulation 1310 n. 88 and cases cited therein. We have recently held that a finding of actual knowledge is not necessary for finding criminal liability under \u00a7 24 of the Securities Act, 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 77x, for \u201cwillful\u201d violations of \u00a7\u00a7 5(a) and (c) and 17(a), 15 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 77e(a), (e), and 77q(a). United States v. Benjamin, 328 F.2d 854, 863 (2 Cir.), cert. denied, 377 U.S. 953, 84 S.Ct. 1631, 12 L.Ed.2d 497 (1964). As Professor Loss reminds us, \u201cIt is conceivable, therefore, that \u2018willfully\u2019 means something less in \u00a7 15(b) than it does in the penal provisions of the SEC acts.\u201d 2 Loss, op. cit. supra at 1309. It is inconceivable that it means something more. Tager\u2019s acts met the requirement of willfulness as found in 15(b).</p>\n<p id=\"b62-9\">Finally, Tager attacks the appropriateness of the sanctions imposed by the Commission in revoking his broker-dealer registration and expelling him from membership in the NASD. Such steps may be taken only if the revocation is \u201cin the public interest.\u201d \u00a7 \u00a7 15(b), 15A(b) (4) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, 15 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 78o(b), 78o-3(b) (4).</p>\n<p id=\"b62-10\">Tager urges in mitigation that he had never been involved in a questionable transaction previously; that he cooperated with the Commission in this and in other investigations; that no showing was made of public losses as a result of his activities (cf. Otis &amp; Co., 35 S.E.C. 650, 657-58 (1954)); and that this was his first underwriting. While these factors might have warranted a lighter sanction, they did not require one.</p>\n<p id=\"b62-11\">Registration of broker-dealers is a means of protecting the public (cf. Pierce v. SEC, 239 F.2d 160, 163-164 (9 Cir. 1956)), and the determination of the sanctions necessary to protect the public rests primarily within the competence of the Commission. \u201c[W]here Congress has entrusted an administrative agency with the responsibility of selecting the means of achieving the statutory policy \u2018the relation of remedy to policy is peculiarly a matter for administrative competence.\u2019 \u201d American Power and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"9\">*9</page-number>Light Co. v. SEC, 329 U.S. 90, 112, 67 S.Ct. 133, 146, 91 L.Ed. 103 (1946). See also Moog Industries, Inc. v. FTC, 355 U.S. 411, 413, 78 S.Ct. 377, 2 L.Ed. 2d 370 (1958); Phelps Dodge Corp. v. NLRB, 313 U.S. 177, 194, 561 S.Ct. 845, 85 L.Ed. 1271 (1941). The Commission must have a very large measure of discretion in determining what sanctions to impose at a particular time in particular cases. Failing a gross abuse of discretion, the courts should not attempt to substitute their untutored views as to what sanctions will best accord with the regulatory powers of the Commission. We find no abuse of the Commission\u2019s powers and discretion in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b63-4\">Tager is not aided by the fact that the only cases which the Commission cites in support of the imposition of this extreme sanction involved situations of greater harm to the public. (See, Theodore A. Landau, 40 S.E.C. 1119 (1962); R. L. Emacio &amp; Co., 35 S.E.C. 191 (1953); Floyd A. Allen &amp; Co., 35 S.E.C. 176 (1953); Adams &amp; Co., 33 S.E.C. 444 (1952).) Cf. F. C. C. v. WOKO, 329 U.S. 223, 227-228, 67 S.Ct. 213, 91 L.Ed. 204 (1946); Shawmut Ass\u2019n v. SEC, 146 F.2d 791, 796-797 (1 Cir. 1945); 2 Davis, Administrative Law \u00a7 17.07 n. 15 and cases cited therein. The injury inflicted on the public, the market price inflation accomplished through the rigging, and the amount of profit realized by the broker are not immutable guides to an appropriate sanction as these factors are largely dependent upon market conditions and chance.</p>\n<p id=\"b63-5\">As harsh as the sanction here might seem, it does not necessarily mean that Tager will be permanently barred from participation in the securities business. Under \u00a7 15(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 78o(b), the registration of a broker or dealer is subject to the same \u201cpublic interest\u201d requirement as is his revocation discussed above. Further, \u00a7 15A(b) (4) of the same Act, 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 78o-3(b) (4), indicates that a broker whose registration has been revoked may be restored to membership in the NASD if the Commission finds it in the public interest to do so. Moreover, the Commission advises us that there are \u201cprocedures whereby persons whose registrations have been revoked or whose membership's in the NASD have been suspended might in appropriate cases continue in the securities business under proper supervision.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b63-8\">Affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
