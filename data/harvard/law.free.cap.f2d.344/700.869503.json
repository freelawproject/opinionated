The appellant first came in contact with the law in this transaction when he was stopped in the act of speeding and reckless driving by a city policeman in Columbus, Georgia. The complaint here is of the admission in evidence of the appellant\u2019s response to a question about his identity and a request to see his driver\u2019s license. The question and request were of the routine nature that have come to be expected when an automobile driver is stopped in connection with a traffic violation, whether he <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"701\">*701</page-number>gets a ticket or not. At the time of the arrest and the conversation complained of, the officer neither knew nor had reason to believe that the automobile was stolen. We have carefully considered the record and have come to the conclusion that the evidence was admissible under the circumstances of this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b755-5\">No reversible error appears, and the judgment is affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
