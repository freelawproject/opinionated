A method of treating filters for cigarettes, which filters are of the type that remove tar and nicotine from cigarette tobacco smoke comprising adding several drops of tincture of tobacco flavored to taste to a filter in order to restore to the tobacco smoke the flavor removed as a result of the removal of tar and nicotine.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b774-5\">The board, affirming the examiner, held that the following disclosure of Davidson \u201canticipates\u201d the claims or \u201crenders them obvious to persons of ordinary skill in the art\u201d:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b774-6\">\u201cIn Fig. 1 is shown a cigarette having the usual wrapper 15 and tobacco filler 16 and also having at one end within the wrapper 15 a <em>filter </em>plug or mouthpiece insert 17. ******</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b774-7\">\u201cPreferably the paper or other material constituting the above described <em>fillers </em>is so constituted or treated as to be fire resistant or self-extinguishing, and is suitably sized. In addition, the material may be treated by coating or, in the case of soft sized paper, saturating the same with an infusion made from tobacco, tobacco stems, cocoa, cinnamon, menthol or other flavoring materials.\u201d [Emphasis supplied.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b774-8\">The sole distinction which appellant urges is that the \u201cmouthpieces\u201d of Davidson are fillers rather than filters, in part evidenced by the above italicized discrepancy in the reference. It is further urged that the \u201cmouthpieces\u201d cannot function as filters since the folds of the paper material are such that there are, in appellant\u2019s words, \u201cuninterrupted longitudinal air passages therethrough,\u201d i. e., no smoke-laden air is drawn <em>through </em>paper such that it would act as a filter. Thus appellant urges, Davidson is not an anticipation in the sense of a full disclosure.</p>\n<p id=\"b774-10\">While elsewhere in Davidson the paper used to form the mouthpieces is referred to as \u201cpaper filer\u201d and \u201cfiller\u201d any doubts we have that the mouthpiece is indeed a filter are resolved by Davidson\u2019s claim 11:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"A_T\">\u201c11. A method of making filter plug mouthpieces for cigarettes, which comprises forming a smoke filter having multitudinous generally longitudinal passages by laterally loosely compressing together, through pressure applied radially inward into substantially cylindrical form, fibrous cellulose material, and simultaneously moving said material in the axial direction of the cylinder so formed.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b774-11\">The axial passages in the Davidson filter do not prevent it from functioning as a filter, and appellant discloses no particular filter structure such that any distinction as to novelty within the meaning of 35 U.S.C. \u00a7 102 can be urged.</p>\n<p id=\"b774-12\">The decision of the board is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"A_7A\">Affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b774-13\">SMITH, J., concurs in the result.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
