The plaintiff holds by assignment full title to the policy of insurance upon which the action is brought. The motion papers disclose nothing but the fact that a claim has been made by a third party to the policy of insurance. Not a single circumstance is mentioned to indicate that that \u2022claim has the slightest foundation. We have frequently held that something must be stated in the affidavits, upon applications of this \u2022character, to throw a real doubt upon the right of the plaintiff to -recover. Stevenson v. Insurance Co., 10 App. Div. 233, 41 N. Y. Supp. 964; Burritt v. Publishing Co., 19 App. Div. 609, 46 N. Y. Supp. 295; Roberts v. Vanhorne, 21 App. Div. 369, 47 N. Y. Supp. 448; Golden v. Insurance Co., 35 App. Div. 569, 55 N. Y. Supp. 143; Wells v. Bank, 40 App. Div. 498, 58 N. Y. Supp. 125; Steiner v. Institution, 60 App. Div. 232, 70 N. Y. Supp. 223. There is nothing in the motion papers from .which it can be reasonably inferred that a doubt based upon facts exists as to who is justly entitled to recover upon the policy of insurance upon which this action is brought.</p>\n<p id=\"b468-18\">The order must be reversed, with $10 costs and disbursements, \u2022and the motion for an interpleader denied, with $10 costs, but with \u25a0liberty to the defendant to renew the motion upon proper papers. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
