The negotiations for the sale were made on behalf of the defendant by her husband, acting\" as her authorized agent. There is no dispute about the main facts,, viz., that the. plaintiff was duly employed; that he found a customer (a Mr. Mathews) who was able and willing to buy and to pay for the property, in cash, the price ($11,750) which the defendant demanded), and that the parties met at the plaintiff\u2019s office for the purpose of executing a contract, but failed to do so because of a requirement on the-defendant\u2019s part that the contract should contain a provision permitting her to pay a small forfeiture in lieu of the delivery of the-deed, should she so elect. While the parties differ as to some matters not material to the determination of the case, in the view I take-it seems clear that, upon the evidence of the defendant\u2019s husband,. the plaintiff is entitled to recover. The negotiations contemplated a. sale. Nothing else appears to have been considered or discussed prior to the time when the purchaser was procured by the plaintiff, and the-parties met to consummate the transaction. The defendant\u2019s husband did, indeed, testify that he told the plaintiff that there would be restrictions ; but this the plaintiff denied, asserting that the restrictions-were never spoken of until the' purchaser and the agent met at his-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"557\">*557</page-number>\u25a0office. Taking the version of the transaction, however, as given by the defendant\u2019s husband, it is evident that* there was no suggestion or disclosure of the condition which finally avoided the sale. He testified in reference to his preliminary conversations with the plaintiff \u25a0that he said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b577-5\">\u201cI will not sell any of that property to anybody without restrictions. \u2022I must know what they are going to build. We are not running the risk -of any flats, or anything of that kind. We would rather not sell the property. It must be restricted, and there are other tilings that must be agreed upon.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b577-6\">When the parties met, the proposed restrictions were discussed, and apparently agreed upon; but the fact was then disclosed, for the .first time, that the defendant could not and would not agree absolutely to a sale of the property, because there were mortgages upon it in excess of the selling price, and she did not know that she could procure releases. Her husband testified as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b577-7\">\u201cNow, I said, when Mr. Mathews arrived: \u2018There are complications in regard to this that have got to be talked over. There is a mortgage of $16,500 covering this and adjoining property, and there is a second mortgage of $6,000 covering this property adjoining, back interest back taxes, etc., that have got to be cleared up, and I don\u2019t know that I can get a release from these mortgages, which might be hard. I don\u2019t wish to sign a contract unless I cover myself or my wife, and I will put it in the paper so.\u2019 \u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b577-8\">He further testified:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b577-9\">\u201cI couldn\u2019t sign any contract for Mrs. Oarpenter, and told him so, distinctly, without there was a forfeit in these on account of my not being able to get these releases.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b577-10\">And again:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b577-11\">\u201cQ. * * * I understand you to say that there were quite a number of mortgages on this property, and you didn\u2019t know whether you could get a release, etc. A. Yes, sir. Q. And that was the only reason why you couldn\u2019t make a contract, and give title free and clear? A. Yes, sir. Q. That is so? A. Yes, sir.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b577-12\">The case presented is, therefore, one where the owner of real estate, who is both unable and unwilling to contract for its sale, employs a broker to effect its sale, and the latter finds a customer at the stipulated price. Under such circumstances, the owner cannot escape lia'bility because the purchaser refuses to accept an option, instead of an absolute contract of sale. Had the purchaser refused to buy unconditionally, the broker employed to sell could not recover his commissions, and the converse must be true where the fault is wholly that of the vendor. See Condit v. Cowdrey, 123 N. Y. 463, 25 N. E. 946, and Id., 139 N. Y. 273, 34 N. E. 781. The duty of the 'broker is complete when he finds a purchaser able and willing to purchase upon the seller\u2019s terms, wholly irrespective of whether or not a written contract is finally executed. Barnard v. Monnot, *42 N. Y. 203; Brady v. Foster (Sup.) 75 N. Y. Supp. 994. If the defendant was only willing to sell conditionally, or to give an option upon the property, good faith required that she should have so notified the \u2022plaintiff. When, instead of this, she employed him to effect a sale, she rendered herself liable to the payment of his commissions on the procuring of a purchaser. In Mooney v. Elder, 56 N. Y. 238, it was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"558\">*558</page-number>held that plaintiff was entitled to his commission upon the production' of a purchaser ready and willing to purchase upon defendant\u2019s terms,, although defendant was unable or refused to consummate the contract. The fact that the parties herein agreed that the commissions \u2022 should not be payable until the deed was delivered is not material. By refusing to contract to give a deed, the defendant prevented the sale from being completed, and his liability at once attached. As was said by Judge Finch in Sibbald v. Iron Co., 83 N. Y. 378, 383, 38 Am. Rep. 441:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b578-5\">\u201cIf the efforts of the broker are rendered a failure by the fault of the employer; if capriciously he changes his mind after the purchaser, ready and willing, and consenting to the prescribed terms, is produced; or if the latter declines to complete the contract because of some defect of title in the ownership of the seller, some unremoved incumbrance, some defect which is the fault of the latter,-\u2014then the broker does not lose his com- \u2022 missions. And that upon the familiar principle that no one can avail himself of the nonperformance of a condition precedent, who has himself occasioned its nonperformance.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b578-6\">The judgment should be reversed.</p>\n<p id=\"b578-7\">Judgment of the municipal court reversed, and new trial ordered; costs to \u2022 abide the event. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
