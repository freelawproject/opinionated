The defendant Oppenheim alone appears and answers, and pleads that the transaction was not in the ordinary course of their firm\u2019s business, and that the indorsement was not that of his firm. He also denies the receipt of notice of dishonor. The evidence adduced upon the trial is to the effect that the proceeds-of the notes in suit, when discounted, were entered upon the defendants\u2019 books and passed to their credit, and were therefore as much under the control of one as of the other of the defendants. Tfie doctrine of ratification by accepting benefits may very well be-applied to the circumstances of this case. The defendants offered no evidence upon the trial, and there was nothing calling for a submission to the jury. Under the circumstances, the direction for a verdict was proper, and will not be disturbed.
