Melledy v. Shea (decided herewith) 76 N: <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"684\">*684</page-number>Y. Supp. 682, with the one exception that the relator herein resides in\u00a1 the borough of Manhattan, instead of the borough of the Bronx. This-exception, however, clearly distinguishes this case from that. In theMelledy Case we held that the civil service commission had no power to subdivide existing localities into districts, but that it did have power to certify separate lists to such localities as had been created by legislative act. The city of New York has been divided by the legislature into boroughs. The bridge department of the city extends to all of the boroughs, and therefore the civil service commission had the-power, under section 17, c. 370, Laws 1899, to certify separate lists-of applicants for appointments to each borough. This the commission did, and the relator\u2019s name appeared upon the list certified for' the borough of Manhattan, where he resided. By his application he seeks to be appointed, not in the borough of Manhattan, but in the borough of the Bronx, and his complaint is that his name was not certified to the latter borough; but, as indicated in the Melledy Case,, he .could not insist\u2014the commission having determined otherwise\u2014 upon having his name certified to that borough, inasmuch as he did not reside therein, and for that reason his application for a peremptory writ of mandamus compelling the commissioners to certify his name for appointment in that borough was properly denied.</p>\n<p id=\"b704-5\">The order appealed from must therefore be affirmed, with $10 costs, and disbursements. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
