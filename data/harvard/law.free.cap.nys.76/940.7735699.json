The witness producing the letter testified that the writer wanted to-save time by printing from the original type, and that in an interview it was agreed that the contract be modified, and that type work be-charged for at the rate of electrotype plates; but, when the letter was shown witness, he could not explain what was meant by \u201cmetal plates.\u201d <em>Eeld, </em>that evidence of the writer of the letter offered by defendant to-explain the use of the words was improperly rejected, since, assuming the letter to be a modification of the contract, if the words \u201cmetal plates\u201d had a definite meaning, which needed no explanation, they were-made ambiguous by extrinsic circumstances.</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b960-8\">3.

To meet this contention, and also to support charges for plates in the bill in suit, the plaintiff undertook' to show that by consent of the parties a charge was to be made for these plates when original type was used, for the purpose of saving time in preparing the publication; and, to prove this modification, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"941\">*941</page-number>\u25a0 of the original agreement, plaintiff\u2019s witness Blanchard testified to the receipt of a letter from one Crotty; his testimony being, \u201cThat .is the letter that I say altered the contract.\u201d So far as bearing upon the question of the substitution of type for electrotyping, this letter reads: \u201cWe suppose you are doing your very best on Toilettes. Do you think it necessary to electro those last four pages ? It would save time to print from metal plates.\u201d Testifying generally to the purport of the letter, Blanchard stated that Mr. Crotty \u201cwanted to know if I could not save time by printing from the original type\u201d; but when the letter was placed before the witness he testified, \u201cI do \u2022not know what \u2018metal plates\u2019 referred to.\u201d These words, however, were the only words used to denote a substitution of something for \u2022the electrotyping; and, to explain his conclusion that the words .meant original type, the witness Blanchard testified that on receipt of the letter he had an interview with Crotty, as the result of which, he states, it was agreed that the type work should be charged for at the rates applicable to electrotyping. Thereafter the defendant called Mr. Crotty, and sought to prove by him what he meant by the use of the words \u201cmetal plates\u201d in his letter; but the testimony \u2022was excluded at the plaintiff\u2019s instance, under exception. We think \u2022that this ruling was erroneous. Not only is it apparent that the writing failed to express the full agreement upon which the plaintiff \u2022relied, but, treated as a contract, the necessity of its explanation for the discovery of the meaning of the words \u201cmetal plates\u201d was made \u25a0to arise by the testimony of the party to whom this letter was addressed. If, on their face, these words had any definite meaning, \u25a0certainly their ambiguity was disclosed by extrinsic circumstances (Tilden v. Tilden, 8 App. Div. 99, 104, 40 N. Y. Supp. 403); and we have no doubt that Crotty\u2019s explanation of what he referred to by the words used was admissible, and not within the rule which \u2022prohibits the alteration of written contracts by paroi evidence. Neff v. Klepfer, 16 Misc. Rep. 49, 51, 37 N. Y. Supp. 654. The fact that Blanchard\u2019s testimony as to this asserted modification of the earlier agreement was brought out by defendant\u2019s counsel on cross-examinatian does not affect the question. Plaintiff\u2019s case in chief was sought to be made out by Blanchard\u2019s evidence in support, generally, of the correctness of the bill produced, and this matter of the modified contract followed in the course of the witness\u2019 explanation of an apparent charge for plates excessive of the actual number in the March edition. The assertion of this contract on the plaintiff\u2019s part was relevant to the issues tendered by the counterclaim, and, whether brought out on cross-examination or not, the defendant\u2019s right to present the whole contract to the court was unaffected.</p>\n<p id=\"b961-6\">The direction of a verdict for the plaintiff, the fact having been left \u25a0to the court to decide, was supported by the evidence, and, so far as the counterclaim was for nondelivery of plates charged for, there is proof that by the agreement the plates were to be delivered to the defendant when it wanted them; hence a demand was necessary, and there was credible evidence that all plates demanded had been delivered. No substantial ground for an appeal appears to be presented by the exceptions argued, other than the one which we have <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"942\">*942</page-number>discussed; but the error pointed out was clearly prejudicial, and there should be a new trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b962-4\">Judgment reversed, and new trial ordered, with costs to appellant to abide event. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
