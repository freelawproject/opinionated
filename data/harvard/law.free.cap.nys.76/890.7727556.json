It appeared that, in the action in the superior court brought by Raynor agajnst the parties in this action, separate answers were interposed, in which the partnership between them was denied by each of them. The verified answer of Cunningham (the plaintiff here) denied not only the partnership, but also that they were jointly interested in and about the work which \u201cplaintiff [Raynor] was engaged in performing,\u201d and affirmatively alleged that he (Cunningham) had a contract for excavating said premises, and that Ray-nor was employed by him. Upon the issue created by the denial of the partnership of the parties, the defendant Troian was relieved from all liability in the Raynor case. Cunningham now comes into court, confessedly admitting perjury in the Raynor case, and asserts a partnership with the defendant. Aside from the reason that the preponderance of evidence is against the plaintiff, it scarcely needs more than a comprehension of the facts to show why the court will not sanction a judgment based upon the vital issue of partnership, where the plaintiff unequivocally testified in another action that no partnership existed. Our disposition of the case here is not to be construed as holding t-hat the court below had jurisdiction to try the alleged cause of action set forth. In the' view of the case that we take, it becomes unnecessary to consider this question.</p>\n<p id=\"b911-5\">Judgment reversed, and new trial ordered, with costs to appellant to abide event. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
