The complaint does not show whether the agreement was \u25a0oral or in writing, and the order requires the plaintiff to state whether -or not it was m writing, and, if so, to set forth its substance. This, or\u25a0dinarily, falls more particularly within the province of a bill of particulars; but inasmuch as it may be desired to plead the statute of -frauds if the agreement 'be not in writing, this part of the order is eminently proper, and must be sustained. It is alleged generally in the complaint that at the time the decedent made the proposal which was subsequently accepted and became the contract, the trustees were considering a sale of the church property, were in favor \u25a0of removing or consolidating as therein alleged, and would have consummated such removal or consolidation but for such agreement. The order requires the plaintiff to state whether any formal action had been taken in the premises by the board of trustees, and to specify in detail what is meant by the allegation that the removal or consolidation would have been consummated but for said agreement. We think there is no impropriety in requiring the plaintiff to make its complaint more definite and certain in these particulars. The complaint set forth briefly and in general terms the deep interest of dece<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"286\">*286</page-number>dent and her ancestors in this church which led her to desire its continuance on the existing site, and moved her to make the offer which became embodied in the contract in question. These allegations have been stricken out as irrelevant. This part of the order is erroneous. The allegations could not possibly have prejudiced the-defendant, and therefore he is not aggrieved thereby. Tradesmen\u2019s Nat. Bank v. United States Trust Co., 49 App. Div. 362, 366, 63 N. Y. Supp. 526; Park &amp; Sons Co. v. National Wholesale Druggists\u2019 Ass\u2019n, 30 App. Div. 508, 52 N. Y. Supp. 475. Then again, this being' a suit in equity, the pleader is allowed greater latitude in setting forth, the facts constituting his cause of action than in an action at law. Park &amp; Sons Co. v. National Wholesale Druggists\u2019 Ass\u2019n, supra; Bogardus v. Railway Co., 62 App. Div. 377, 70 N. Y. Supp. 1094; Town of Essex v. New York &amp; C. R. Co., 8 Hun, 361; Younger v. Duffie, 26 Hun, 442, 444. If the making of the agreement be controverted, or its validity be contested, it would be competent to show these facts as bearing on the probability as to whether it was made, and also on the sufficiency of the consideration. They are part of\" the history of the case, and constituted the sole inducement for the-contract, and are properly pleaded in equity.</p>\n<p id=\"b306-4\">The order should be modified by striking out that part of the order-appealed from which strikes out allegations as irrelevant and redundant, and, as so modified, affirmed, without costs. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
