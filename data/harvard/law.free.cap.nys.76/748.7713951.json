One of the covenants of the lease provided that the lessee \u201cwill not assign this lease, nor let or underlet the whole or any part of the said premises, * * * without the written consent\u201d of the landlord, \u201cunder the penalty of forfeiture and damages.\u201d Tauter was made a party defendant because-of the covenants in the lease, but no personal judgment was asked against him. In his answer, among other things, he alleges that he-did not consent to the assignment or the mortgage of the lease, and\u2019 then avers that by the assignments the lease became forfeited. Tw this separate defense the plaintiff demurred, but the demurrer was-overruled, and from the interlocutory judgment thus entered this appeal is taken.</p>\n<p id=\"b769-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"749\">*749</page-number>The single question presented is whether a violation of a covenant \u25a0in a lease not to assign works a forfeiture of the lease without further \u2022action on the part of the landlord. The authorities, as we read them, are to the effect that an assignment without the consent of the landlord renders the lease not void, but voidable. If the landlord chooses to avail himself of the breach, he can do so by re-entry or by enjoining the tenant from assigning, or he can recover damages for breach \u2022of the covenant. As said in Chautauqua Assembly v. Alling, 46 Hun, 584:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b769-6\">\u201cThe several assignments of the interests of the lessees are not absolutely void; they are voidable only, at the election of the lessor or its assigns. They pass title subject to the consequences of the breach. If the lessor or its assignee chooses to avail itself of the breach, it can only do so by re-entering as provided by the lease, or by pursuing such other legal remedy as the \u2022right of re-entry confers.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b769-7\">See, also, Kramer v. Amberg, 53 Hun, 427, 6 N. Y. Supp. 303.</p>\n<p id=\"b769-8\">In the answer of the landlord there is no allegation of re-entry \u2022or of any proceeding taken or any election-to avail of the breach, and no counterclaim is pleaded or damage claimed. We think, therefore, that this defense is insufficient in law, and that the demurrer \u2022should have been sustained.</p>\n<p id=\"b769-9\">The interlocutory judgment must accordingly be reversed, with costs, and the demurrer sustained, with costs, but with leave to the defendant to answer over upon payment of the costs. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
