The record does not disclose such gross negligence or \u25a0unfaithfulness in the discharge of duties as to warrant punishment of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"62\">*62</page-number>this character. The negligence charged relates to her failure to obtain possession of a note which had passed from the possession of the deceased in her lifetime into the hands of the maker of the note.. This question of how to proceed under the circumstances, or whether to involve the estate in litigation over the matter at all, was not so clear as to make it gross, culpable negligence not to bring an action. The-surrogate has charged her with the principal and interest of this note, and the estate has lost nothing by reason of her hesitancy in entering; upon litigation. The estate has been so saved thp peril of such an. action, and all question as to the responsibility of the maker of the note. Under such circumstances we can see at most only a mistake in. judgment on the part of the administratrix. She should be allowed the usual commissions.</p>\n<p id=\"b82-5\">The surrogate also omitted to credit as paid on the note $65, which, the maker of the note paid to Miss Button. There is no dispute about this payment. This was made apparently at the request of the deceased, and should be allowed as a payment on the note, and the amount charged to the administratrix on account of this note should be-reduced by that sum and interest from the date of death of the intestate.</p>\n<p id=\"b82-6\">The decree is modified by the allowance of commissions and the said payment of $65 and interest, and, as so modified, affirmed, with costs to appellant from the estate. The surrogate of Washington county is directed to so modify the decree of record in the surrogate\u2019s court,, and, after allowance of costs of the appeal, the commissions, and said payment, to reapportion the amount to be distributed in conformity with such modification.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
