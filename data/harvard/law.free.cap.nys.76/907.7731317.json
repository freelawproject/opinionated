The plaintiff seeks to recover the sum of $160, being the amount of four months\u2019 rent voluntarily paid by him to the defendants for the occupancy of a soda-water stand in front of defendants\u2019 premises \u201coutside of the house line and within the stoop line.\u201d The theory of plaintiff\u2019s claim is that a city ordinance passed in 1899 prohibits a licensee of the city, to whom the privilege of maintaining a stand is given, from \u201cpaying rent or Other compensation to the owner or occupant of the premises where such stand shall be located.\u201d Judgment was rendered in favor of the plaintiff for the full amount claimed.</p>\n<p id=\"b927-18\">Aside from other considerations that might be urged for reversing the judgment, it will be sufficient here to base a reversal upon either of the following grounds: First. There is no proof of the partnership of d\u2019efendants. Second. It affirmatively appears that no permit or license for a stand was ever issued to the plaintiff. Third. If a permit or license had been granted, and assuming that the payment and collection of rent were unlawful acts, then would the parties stand in pari delicto before the court, and no- recovery be permitted. Knowlton v. Spring Co., 57 N. Y. 518. Fourth. There is no proof of the existence of the ordinance in question, and judicial notice of it can.<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"908\">*908</page-number>not be taken. Porter v. Waring, 69 N.
