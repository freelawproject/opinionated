There is an allegation in the complaint that at the time of the accident the \u201cstoker\u201d was not defective or out of repair. The defendants moved for a bill of particulars showing in what respect the machinery and appliances were unsafe, and in what respect the work was negligently conducted and the place unsafe. The application was accompanied by an affidavit on the defendants\u2019 part to the effect that no defect in the place or machinery was known to or discoverable by them, and was opposed by an affidavit of the plaintiff to the effect that the accident occurred while he was working at the \u201cstoker,\u201d and that he knew nothing about its construction or the method of operating it. There is no statement that the injury complained of was occasioned by the \u201cstoker.\u201d The defendants were clearly entitled to the particulars herein referred to, and the motion should have been granted.
