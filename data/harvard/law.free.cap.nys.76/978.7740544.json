In the absence of provision for rent in advance, it became payable at the close of each month. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"979\">*979</page-number>The plaintiff claims to recover for the monthly installments becoming due August i and September i, 1900, while the answer, denying that defendant failed to pay the rent from the 1st day, and that there is due the rent from the 1st day of August, demands that the complaint, as regards that item, be dismissed.</p>\n<p id=\"b999-5\">The only witness testifying at the trial (the plaintiff himself) said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b999-6\">\u201cI haven\u2019t here any memorandum as to the amounts paid by Mr. Shaw diming the term of this lease. My bookkeeper has it. * * * I cannot say how many payments were paid. I cannot state as to what the payment made on July 31st is for. I don\u2019t know what that payment was for. I presume it was for rent, etc. I know he left owing two months\u2019 rent. This is all I can recall now. But my books will show. I haven\u2019t got them here. I was not asked to bring them.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b999-7\">Under full and proper proof, it is possible that plaintiff might recover all that he has demanded, but the testimony adduced did not sustain the complaint. The court was right in proceeding with the trial, as no good reason, required by the rule, was shown for postponement; but we think the grounds upon which the judgment stands are insufficient to maintain it in its entirety.</p>\n<p id=\"b999-8\">The judgment and order appealed from should be modified by reducing the amount of recovery by the sum of $116.66, besides the costs and disbursements of this appeal, which must be allowed to the appellant, and, as so modified, affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b999-9\">O\u2019DWYER, J.</author>\n<p id=\"AsC\">(dissenting). I cannot agree with Justice HASCAUL. The action was commenced July 17, 1901,\u2014over nine months after the term created by the lease had expired,\u2014and the evidence abundantly shows that the defendant was owing two months\u2019 rent when the term expired. There is no doubt about that fact, and, although the complaint may incorrectly state the exact due date of the month\u2019s rent, that mistake does not present reversible error. On the other hand, justice requires that the pleading be amended to conform to the proof, and the judgment and order appealed from affirmed, with costs.</p>\n<p id=\"b999-10\">Reargument ordered.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
