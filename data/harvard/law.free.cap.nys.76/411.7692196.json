The plaintiff testified that he signaled the motorman to- stop; that the motorman put his hand to the brake, whereupon the car came almost to a standstill, or, as the plaintiff expressed it, \u201cwas moving at a snail\u2019s pace\u201d; that the plaintiff had one foot on the step of the rear platform of the car, when the speed was suddenly accelerated, and he was thrown to the \u25a0ground and injured. There were witnesses for the defendant who Hatly contradicted the plaintiff. Under McDonald v. Railway Co., 167 N. Y. 66, 60 N. E. 282, it was the duty of the court to submit the case to the jury, which was done, and they found a verdict for the defendant. From the judgment entered upon the verdict, this appeal is taken.</p>\n<p id=\"b431-15\">Although many grounds of error are assigned by the appellant, it is unnecessary to consider any of them but one, and that is suffi- \u25a0 cient to reverse this judgment. This accident happened upon a street railway, and the court charged the jury as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b431-16\">\u201cThe usual invitation to us to get aboard of a public vehicle is that it \u2022stops, and, in all ordinary cases, to get aboard of a moving public vehicle is imprudent. This case turns upon this: Did the plaintiff act as would a reasonably prudent person, and did the motorman of the car act as would .\u25a0a prudent person at that time?\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b431-17\">To this an exception was taken. That in this instruction to the jury the court uses the word \u201cimprudent,\u201d instead of \u201cnegligent,\u201d In connection with the accident, does not relieve it from the criticism tihat it states a proposition of law plainly applicable in cases of sur<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"412\">*412</page-number>face railroads operated by steam, as in Soloman v. Railroad Co., 103 N. Y. 437, 9 N. E. 430, 57 Am. Rep. 760, and Mearns v. Railroad Co., 163 N. Y. 108, 57 N. E. 292, but which does not apply to cases of street railways in cities. The trial judge .stated, as matter of law, that in all ordinary cases to get aboard or attempt tO' get aboard of a moving public vehicle is \u201cimprudent,\u201d which was used as a synonym or substituted and equivalent word for \u201cneglect.\u201d This seems to be apparent from the fact that the court refused to charge that it is not always negligence, as matter of law, for a person to get upon a street car while it is in motion, so that, even if the plaintiff boarded or attempted to board the car while in motion, the jury might still find in his favor. In Eppendorf v. Railroad Co., 69 N. Y. 195, 25 Am. Rep. 171, it is said that ordinarily it is perfectly safe to get upon a street car moving slowly, and thousands of people do it every day with perfect safety, and it cannot be said,, as matter of law, that it is always negligent for- a person to get upon a street car while in motion. Substantially the same remark is made in Moylan v. Railroad Co., 128 N. Y. 583, 27 N. E. 977,. and in Kimber v. Railway Co., 69 App. Div. 353, 74 N. Y. Supp. 966. In those cases the court seems to give effect to that which is patent to the observation of every one in a large city,\u2014that persons frequently enter upon a street car while it is moving slowly.. The act may be a negligent one or an imprudent one, but it is not necessarily so, in contemplation of law. In this case the trial judge, started with a proposition which was controlling of the whole case,, which was stated as a rule of law, and which, when it was proved, that the plaintiff entered upon a moving car, fixed in the minds of-the jury that that act, in and of itself, was what the law declared' to be imprudent, and, for the purposes of this case, a negligent, act. When the case was thus sent to the jury, at the very outset, of the judge\u2019s remarks the controlling proposition was erroneously stated, and must have affected the minds of the jurors. This was-an error, for which the judgment and order should be reversed, and a new trial ordered, with, costs to appellant to abide the event. Alh concur except INGRAHAM, J., who dissents.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
