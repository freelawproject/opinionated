The decedent was a boy nearly -eight years of age. The evidence tended to show that on the 3d day of July, 1901, shortly after 5 o\u2019clock in the afternoon, the boy was standing \u00f3n the easterly sidewalk of Bleeclcer street, near the curb, about opposite the line between Nos. 285 and 287, facing the buildings on the easterly side of the street; that the defendant\u2019s newspaper delivery wagon was being driven northerly on Bleecker street, the horse going on a gallop at the speed of from 10 to 12 miles an hour, and with the right hind wheel in the easterly gutter; that the hub of the front wheel struck the boy\u2019s leg, and he was thrown under the rear wheel, which passed over him, inflicting injuries from which he died. It is strenuously urged by the appellant that the testimony of plaintiff\u2019s witnesses is improbable, and that it was physically impossible for the accident to happen as they narrate it. We think otherwise. The plaintiff produced four disinterested eyewitnesses, who testify to the rapid rate of speed at which the defendant\u2019s wagon was traveling, and, while they differ somewhat as to the precise location of the boy with reference to the curb, they all agree that they saw him struck by the hub of the front wheel, and, although their recollections may not be reliable as to just the manner in which he got under the rear wheel, it is improbable that they could be mistaken about the fact that they saw the hind wheel pass over his body almost instantly after he was struck by the hub of the forward wheel. Consid<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"757\">*757</page-number>ering the position of the boy upon the sidewalk and the high rate of speed at which the defendant\u2019s delivery wagon approached, we think the questions as to whether the defendant was negligent and whether the boy was free ffom negligence were properly submitted to the jury, and that their verdict is amply sustained by the evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b777-3\">In the body of the charge the court said to the jury on the subject of damages:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b777-4\">\u201cYou may also consider the probability whether this son, after he became of age, would not have been led by natural affection to give his father the benefit of his services, earnings, or support in some degree, and whether, by the loss of the son in infancy, the father has lost any probable benefit by way of the use of property which the son, had he lived, might have accumulated.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AMck\">To this part of the charge the defendant\u2019s counsel duly excepted. We think it did not constitute prejudicial error. The jury had a right to consider not only the probability of the son\u2019s living, earning money, accumulating property, and contributing to the needs of his father, but also the possibility of his father surviving him, and inheriting his property. Johnson v. Railroad Co., 80 Hun, 306, 30 N. Y. Supp. 318; Benson v. Corbin, 145 N. Y. 351, 40 N. E. 11. In the light of these decisions, the only theory upon which it could be contended that the charge is erroneous is that it gave the impression to the jury that the father would be entitled as matter of law to the use of the son\u2019s property; but we think that no such inference would be drawn therefrom by the jury.</p>\n<p id=\"b777-6\">The appellant\u2019s first, fourth, eighth, and eleventh requests to charge embraced correct propositions of law, but we think they were sufficiently covered by the court in the main charge, and it was not error to refuse to repeat them.</p>\n<p id=\"b777-7\">The only other question which requires consideration is as to whether the verdict, which was for $5,250, is excessive. The evidence showed that the boy, who was within nine days of being eight years of age, was health)', strong, handsome, bright, and studious; and had been attending school for about two years. The father, who is entitled to the recovery, was the proprietor of a saloon; but there is-no evidence as to his age or health. In the case of Schaffer v. Transfer Co., 29 App. Div. 459, 51 N. Y. Supp. 1092, this court reduced a verdict of $6,000 for the death of a boy 8years of age to $3,000. The grounds of that decision are equally applicable here, and it is unnecessary to recite them. For the reasons there assigned, we think this verdict should be reduced to $3,000. If the boy, had he lived, would have earned and contributed $3,000 to his father, it may well be that he would have contributed much more; but where the verdicts rest so much upon speculation the courts must exercise the power to set them aside when they appear to be excessive, and, of course, the plaintiff may take a new trial if he prefers.</p>\n<p id=\"b777-8\">The judgment, therefore, should be reversed, and a new trial granted, with costs to appellant to abide the event, unless the plaintiff stipulates to reduce the verdict to $3,000, in which case the judgment should be affirmed as so modified, without costs. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
