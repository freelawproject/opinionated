But the submission did not agree as to the location of such wall, though the location was given in the statement of plaintiff\u2019s claim as one which would fix the situation as 408 feet west of the street. The submission also declared that the grantee in such deed and his successors, to plaintiff, had been in the actual possession of such property ever since 1875. <em>'Held, </em>that the submission did not show title in plaintiff either by deed or adverse possession.</headnotes>\n<summary data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b578-12\">Submission of controversy between Annie Kelly, plaintiff, and Mary E.

The submission indicates that the land intended to be sold is situated 408 feet and 4 inches west of Court street. _ The record title of the plaintiff is defective, in that the deed which is her source of title describes the property as 480 feet and 4 inches west of Court street. We are asked by the plaintiff to hold that the_ latter description was a clerical error, but the parties, in their submission, have not agreed upon any fact sufficient to warrant this conclusion. The deed upon which the plaintiff\u2019s title depends was made on March 11, 1875, by Jeremiah Shea and Bridget, his wife, to Michael Kelly. After the erroneous description, making the situation of the property 480 feet and 4 inches west of Court street, instead of 408 feet and 4 inches, this deed conveys \u201cthe right of the party of the first part, his heirs and assigns, to insert beams in the wall of the house adjoining the hereby described premises on the easterly side thereof, as said right is given in and by a deed made by Grace ICoegh and Edward Koegh to Gustavus A. Smith.\u201d It is argued that this clause creates an ambiguity in the description, and the reference to the party wall as a monument must control. In stating the contention of the plaintiff, the location of that party wall is set out in the submission; and it is said that this location would make the party wall 408 feet and 4 inches west of Court street, which is the proper description of the premises. It is not permissible, however, for us to consid\u00e9r this question of location, inasmuch as the situation of the party wall is not agreed upon anywhere in the submission. The only statement in reference to it is contained in that part of the instrument which sets out the plaintiff\u2019s claim. The submission declares that Michael Kelly, the grantee in the Shea deed, \u201chas been in possession of such property from March 11, 1875, up to the time of his death, September 20, 1897, and that his heirs, who are also his devisees, have been in actual possession since that time; his wife having died previously.\u201d Upon this statement it is contended that the plaintiff has made out a good title by adverse possession. It is to be observed, however, that the submission does not declare the possession to have been undisturbed, and, even if it did, such allegation would not suffice. \u201cTo establish title by adverse possession, it must be shown that the person holding the possession did so in open hostility to the rights of the true owner.\u201d Heller v. Cohen, 154 N. Y. 299, 311, 48 N. E. 527, 530.</p>\n<p id=\"b579-5\">Upon the facts stated in this submission, the defendant is entitled to judgment.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
