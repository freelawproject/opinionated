J.</author>\n<p id=\"AX\">An alternative writ of mandate issued challenging the propriety of respondent court\u2019s failure to grant petitioners\u2019 motion to suppress contraband evidence alleged to be the fruit of an unreasonable seizure and search (Pen. Code, \u00a7 1538.5, subd. (a)), in proceedings wherein petitioners are charged with offering marijuana for sale and possession of marijuana for sale (Health &amp; Saf. Code, \u00a7 \u00a7 11531, 11530.5).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> We conclude that the seizure and subsequent search herein concerned were constitutionally permissible. We therefore discharge the alternative writ.</p>\n<p id=\"b32-10\">For some months prior to his election to cooperate with Orange County authorities as an undercover operative seeking to deal in narcotics, Joe Del Sesto had frequented various commercial establishments patronized by narcotics traffickers. Acting in his undercover capacity he entered into preliminary negotiations with petitioners Guidi, Lefort and Neilson and thereafter went to an apartment in Long Beach in order to inspect hashish proffered by such petitioners in exchange for an agreed purchase price of $7,500.</p>\n<p id=\"b32-11\">The door of the apartment opened into a living room which was partially separated from the adjacent kitchen by a counter or bar six to eight feet long and three and a half feet high. A hall led to two bedrooms and a bathroom at the rear of the apartment. Upon his entrance Del Sesto went <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"5\">*5</page-number>through the hall to the bathroom but was unable to observe the occupants of either bedroom as the doors to those rooms were closed. Having returned to the living room Del Sesto observed petitioner O\u2019Connor withdraw 20 bricks of hashish, wrapped in pairs in separate plastic \u201cbaggies,\u201d from a brown grocery bag.</p>\n<p id=\"b33-5\">Del Sesto left the apartment to get the purchase money. Petitioners Lefort and Neilson, who had left with Del Sesto, were arrested on the street as they returned with Del Sesto to the apartment. Del Sesto told the officers that two other suspects were in the apartment and that the hashish was in a shopping bag on the floor of the living room. Del Sesto also said he had not been able to see if other occupants of the apartment were within the bedrooms.</p>\n<p id=\"b33-6\">Petitioner O\u2019Connor responded to a police officer\u2019s knock and was arrested at the door of the apartment. Moving inside with weapon drawn and accompanied by two fellow officers, Officer Holt arrested petitioner Guidi in the living room. Both O\u2019Connor and Guidi were handcuffed immediately. During this time Holt heard sounds coming from the rear of the apartment. He crossed the room to the kitchen. Behind the counter Holt saw a shopping bag with the opening squared shut. For the first time the officer became aware that the distinctive odor of hashish permeated the room and seemed to come directly from the vicinity of the bag. Seizing the bag he found the 10 \u201cbaggies\u201d of hashish within. Holt then searched the bedrooms of the apartment, first for occupants and then more thoroughly to the point of rifling through drawers and opening shoeboxes. A small child was found in one bedroom and the tenant of the apartment in the other. The officers possessed neither search nor arrest warrants.</p>\n<p id=\"b33-7\">Essential to the maintenance of Fourth Amendment rights is the concept that a police intrusion into an area of private control should wherever feasible be made contingent on a <em>judicial </em>finding of probable cause embodied in a warrant. Nowhere has the warrant requirement been applied more stringently than in relation to searches of residences. The United States Supreme Court has repeatedly emphasized that probable cause alone, no matter how compelling, will not justify a search within a residence absent a warrant. (See <em>Vale </em>v. <em>Louisiana </em>(1970) 399 U.S. 30, 34 [26 L.Ed. 2d 409, 413, 90 S.Ct. 1969]; <em>Chapman </em>v. <em>United States </em>(1961) 365 U.S. 610, 613 [5 L.Ed.2d 828, 831, 81 S.Ct. 776].) The Fourth and Fourteenth Amendments mandate the exclusion of evidence seized in the course of an unreasonable search <em>(Mapp </em>v. <em>Ohio </em>(1961) 367 U.S. 643 [6 L.Ed.2d 1081, 81 S.Ct. 1684, 84 A.L.R.2d 933]), and warrantless residential searches have been judicially deemed \u201cper se unreasonable\u201d save where recognized exceptions apply. <em>(Katz </em>v. <em>United States </em>(1967) 389 U.S. 347, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"6\">*6</page-number>357 [19 L.Ed.2d 576, 585, 88 S.Ct. 507]; <em>People </em>v. <em>Edwards </em>(1969) 71 Cal.2d 1096, 1105 [80 Cal.Rptr. 633, 458 P.2d 713]; see also <em>United States </em>v. <em>Rabinowitz </em>(1950) 339 U.S. 56, 68 et seq. [94 L.Ed. 653, 661 et seq., 70 S.Ct. 430] (dissenting opinion by Frankfurter, J.).)</p>\n<p id=\"b34-4\">Petitioners contend that the search of the bag of hashish in the kitchen falls within none of these exceptions to the presumptive invalidity of a warrantless search. The People argue that the odor emanating from the bag put the contraband inside it within the \u201cplain smell\u201d of Officer Holt, and urge that we treat \u201cplain smell\u201d as the legal equivalent of \u201cplain view,\u201d<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> thus invoking or creating, with respect to items possessing unique or distinctive odors, a rule similar to the long-standing concept that contraband seen in plain view may be seized without a warrant.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b34-5\">Although it received only cursory attention from the parties in this case, we believe a substantial Fourth Amendment issue must be resolved preliminarily to our discussion of the seizure of the bag and the search thereof.  It is elementary that the legality of the seizure of an object falling within the plain view of an officer is dependent upon that officer\u2019s right to be in the position from which he gained his view of the seized object. <em>(Harris </em>v. <em>United States </em>(1968) 390 U.S. 234 [19 L.Ed.2d 1067, 88 S.Ct. 992].) Thus we must first determine whether Holt had a right to cross the living room and survey the kitchen before we can consider whether his plain view of the bag and his \u201cplain smell\u201d of the hashish within gave him legal ground to seize the bag and inspect its contents.</p>\n<p id=\"b34-6\">One of the recognized exceptions to the rule that warrantless searches of residences are per se unreasonable is the search incident to an arrest within a residence. Indeed, this exception once threatened to eclipse the rule. The Supreme Court in <em>Chimel </em>v. <em>California </em>(1969) 395 U.S. 752 [23 L.Ed.2d 685, 89 S.Ct. 2034] sought to delimit narrowly the scope of permissible warrantless searches incident to arrest and thereby reaffirm that the warrant requirement was essential to the vitality of the Fourth Amendment.</p>\n<p id=\"b34-7\">The <em>Chimel </em>court noted two rationales in justification of warrantless searches incident to arrest: the security of the arresting officers and the preservation of evidence. Yet for fear that through \u201curiconfined analysis, Fourth Amendment protection in this area would approach the evaporation <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"7\">*7</page-number>point\u201d <em>(id., </em>at p. 765 [23 L.Ed.2d at p. 695]), the court insisted that the dual rationales for searches incident to arrest be oriented solely to the threat posed by the arrestee and limited the search for either weapons or evidence to the arrestee\u2019s person and the area within his immediate control.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b35-5\">Petitioners invoke <em>Chimel </em>as authority for suppressing the seized hashish. Given the fact that both of the petitioners present in the apartment were handcuffed immediately upon arrest and were in any case never less than eight feet in front of the kitchen counter behind which the hashish was found, it is unquestionable that Officer Holt\u2019s survey of the kitchen cannot be validated as a search incident to arrest. The kitchen and any evidence or weapons it might have harbored were clearly beyond the reach of the arrestees. In any case, Holt was not even arguably attempting to comply with the <em>Chimel </em>limitation on warrantless searches. As previously mentioned, the arresting officers in clear derogation of petitioners\u2019 rights proceeded after the discovery of the hashish to search the entire apartment.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b35-6\">Although Officer Holt\u2019s search cannot be justified under <em>Chimel, </em>that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"8\">*8</page-number>case concerned only one of the several exceptions to the rule that warrant-less residential searches are inherently unreasonable. Thus our conclusion that Holt\u2019s positioning himself so as to gain a view of the kitchen was beyond his power to search incident to arrest is not necessarily dispositive of the legality of such action apart from the general exploratory search which followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b36-4\"><em>Chimel </em>was not the first case to recognize that measures reasonably tailored to assuring the security of arresting officers ought not to be inhibited by the warrant requirement. Earlier <em>Terry </em>v. <em>Ohio </em>(1968) 392 U.S. 1, 20 [20 L.Ed.2d 889, 905, 88 S.Ct. 1868] had declared that \u201cadvance judicial approval of searches and seizures through the warrant procedure\u201d is inherently impractical in the context of \u201cnecessarily swift action predicated upon the on-the-spot observations of the officer on the beat. ...\u201d <em>Terry </em>thus effected a fundamental revision of Fourth Amendment analysis by reclassifying searches and seizures into two distinct categories.</p>\n<p id=\"b36-5\">The first of these categories is \u201cpolice conduct subject to the Warrant Clause of the Fourth Amendment, . . .\u201d Such searches and seizures are justifiable only upon \u201cprobable cause,\u201d the sufficiency of which must normally be tested in advance by application to a magistrate for a warrant. <em>(Terry </em>v. <em>Ohio, supra, </em>392 U.S. at p. 20 [20 L.Ed.2d at p. 905].)</p>\n<p id=\"b36-6\">The second category of searches and seizures outlined in <em>Terry </em>is composed of those intrusions which cannot practicably be made contingent on advance judicial approval. Such conduct \u201cmust be tested by the Fourth Amendment\u2019s general proscription against unreasonable searches and seizures.\u201d <em>(Ibid.)</em><footnotemark><em>6</em></footnotemark><em> </em>In assessing reasonableness, \u201cthere is \u2018no ready test . . . other than by balancing the need to search [or seize] against the invasion which the search [or seizure] entails.\u2019 \u201d (Brackets in original.) <em>(Id., </em>at p. 21 [20 L.Ed.2d at p. 905].) This balancing test is essentially a dual inquiry: \u201cwhether the officer\u2019s action was justified at its inception, and whether it was reasonably related in scope to the circumstances which justified the interference in the first place.\u201d <em>(Id., </em>at p. 20.)</p>\n<p id=\"b36-7\">In <em>People </em>v. <em>Block </em>(1971) 6 Cal.3d 239 [103 Cal.Rptr. 281, 499 P.2d 961] we recognized that <em>Chimel </em>and <em>Terry </em>must be read together in assessing the authority of police to search for possible additional suspects when making an arrest. <em>Chimel </em>concerned on its facts a solely evidentiary search \u2014the quintessence of the sort of search <em>Terry </em>held subject to the warrant procedure. Moreover, <em>Chimel </em>concerned the arrest of just one man whom the police knew to be alone in his house with his wife. Thus there were not present in <em>Chimel </em>the reasonable grounds for self-protective measures to which <em>Terry </em>accorded constitutional recognition in its category of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"9\">*9</page-number>searches and seizures not subject to the warrant requirement. We concluded in <em>Block </em>that while <em>Chimel </em>limited exploratory searches for evidence incident to arrest, <em>Terry </em>independently authorized cursory searches for additional suspects incident to arrest or at any other time the police have reasonable grounds for fearing for their security in the discharge of their duties.</p>\n<p id=\"b37-5\">We were aware in <em>Block </em>that suspect searches incident to arrest could potentially become as serious a threat to Fourth Amendment freedoms as were the evidentiary searches incident to arrest condemned in <em>Chimel. </em>Thus we questioned \u201cthe propriety of conducting in every case a general exploratory search for \u2018possible suspects\u2019 . . . .\u201d <em>(People </em>v. <em>Block, supra, </em>6 Cal.3d at p. 243.)  In holding the limitations of <em>Chimel </em>inapplicable to a search for additional suspects incident to a residential narcotics arrest, we sought in <em>Block </em>to forestall abuse of this power to search without a warrant by adopting the substance of the rule propounded in <em>Terry. </em>\u201cAs a general rule, the reasonableness of an officer\u2019s conduct is dependent upon the existence of facts available to him at the moment of the search or seizure which would warrant a man of reasonable caution in the belief that the action taken was appropriate. And in determining whether the officer acted reasonably, due weight must be given not to his unparticularized suspicions or \u2018hunches,\u2019 but to the reasonable inferences which he is entitled to draw from the facts in the light of his experience; in other words, he must be able to point to specific and articulable facts from which he concluded that his action was necessary.\u201d <em>(People </em>v. <em>Block, supra, </em>6 Cal.3d at p. 244; citations omitted.)</p>\n<p id=\"b37-7\">Applying the foregoing standard to the facts of the case before us we conclude that Officer Holt\u2019s excursion into the kitchen was an appropriate action for a man of reasonable caution to take. Holt knew that the traffickers with whom petitioners Guidi and O\u2019Connor were involved included at least two other persons, they being the already-arrested petitioners Lefort and Neilson; that petitioners Guidi and O\u2019Connor and any accomplices who might be present were in possession of 10 pounds of hashish; that the hashish had a $7,500 wholesale value which the officer knew had potential street value in excess of $40,000; that Del Sesto had not looked into any room other than the living room and bathroom; and that upon entering the apartment the officer had heard sounds coming from elsewhere than the open areas. The counter between the kitchen and the living area was high enough and long enough to shelter a lurking accomplice. The value of the contraband reasonably believed present by Holt was surely not so de minimis as to make remote the possibility of violent and desperate efforts to resist the arrests and defend the contraband. Accordingly, the officer\u2019s movement which positioned him to glance into the kitchen area <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"10\">*10</page-number>was justified as a cursory search for additional suspects necessary in these circumstances to allay a reasonable fear for his and his fellow officers\u2019 personal safety.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> Holt thus infringed no constitutional mandate in positioning himself where he could view the brown shopping bag containing the hashish.</p>\n<p id=\"b38-4\">We now address ourselves to the central issue: the question of the inadmissibility of the hashish on the ground that although the view of the brown paper bag was constitutionally obtained, the viewing of the interior of the bag resulting in the disclosure of the hashish was constitutionally impermissible. We proceed to focus our attention on the seizure of the bag itself, which seizure necessarily preceded any examination of the contents of the bag. We have already held that in the case before us the bag was seen in plain sight during a lawful cursory search for additional suspects. We further conclude that the bag itself was evidence of the criminal transactions witnessed by Del Sesto; that the description of the bag by Del Sesto corroborated by the odor emanating therefrom furnished probable cause for Officer Holt to seize the bag; that his seizure of the bag was constitutionally reasonable; and that the search of the bag subsequent to its seizure was therefore likewise reasonable.</p>\n<p id=\"b38-5\">We believe <em>People </em>v. <em>Roberts </em>(1956) 47 Cal.2d 374 [303 P.2d 721], <em>People </em>v. <em>Gilbert </em>(1965) 63 Cal.2d 690 [47 Cal.Rptr. 909, 408 P.2d 365] (revd. on other grounds),<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> and <em>Warden </em>v. <em>Hayden </em>(1967) 387 U.S. 294 [18 L.Ed.2d 782, 87 S.Ct. 1642], set forth the law which properly controls our disposition of this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b39-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"11\">*11</page-number><em>Roberts </em>concerned the conduct of police officers who in the course of a burglary inspection knocked on the door of a suspect\u2019s apartment. Their knocks elicited no response but they heard from within what sounded like the moans or groans of a person in distress. At their request the manager admitted them to the apartment where they conducted a cursory search for the person they thought had made the sounds. They found no one, but in the course of their two or three minutes\u2019 occupancy of the apartment one of the officers noticed a new radio of the type stolen in the burglary they had been investigating. The officer picked up the radio, turned it over, and recorded the serial number it bore on its base. On the basis of this information the officer later confirmed that the radio was indeed stolen property. This court held that since the initial search of the apartment was suitably circumscribed to serve the exigency which prompted it, both the discovery and inspection of the radio were proper.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b39-5\"><em>Roberts </em>was decided prior to <em>Warden </em>v. <em>Hayden, supra, </em>387 U.S. 294. Thus <em>Roberts </em>properly observed that the United States Supreme Court had theretofore drawn \u201ca sharp distinction between the seizure of property which is stolen or contraband and property which is inoffending of itself and merely evidentiary.\u201d <em>(People </em>v. <em>Roberts, supra, </em>47 Cal.2d at p. 379.) The validation by <em>Roberts </em>of the seizure of property found in plain sight during a cursory search of a dwelling for occupants was accordingly limited to the seizure of contraband or possibly stolen property.</p>\n<p id=\"b39-6\">Several years after <em>Roberts, </em>however, we held that the \u201cmere evidence\u201d rule had been fashioned by the United States Supreme Court solely as a federal procedural rule. <em>(People </em>v. <em>Thayer </em>(1965) 63 Cal.2d 635 [47 Cal.Rptr. 780, 408 P.2d 108], cert. den. 384 U.S. 908 [16 L.Ed.2d 361, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"12\">*12</page-number>86 S.Ct. 1342].) Accordingly we declared that \u201cthe mere evidence rule is not a constitutional standard and has no application in California.\u201d <em>(Id., </em>at p. 642.)</p>\n<p id=\"b40-4\">The expansive effect of <em>Thayer </em>on <em>Roberts </em>was implicit in our decision in <em>People </em>v. <em>Gilbert, supra, </em>63 Cal.2d 690, where we read <em>Roberts </em>as permitting the plain view seizure of \u201csuspicious objects,\u201d without confining such seizures to stolen property or contraband.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> In <em>Gilbert </em>eyewitnesses to a bank robbery saw stolen currency and coins being placed in a brown Alpha Beta Market shopping bag. During the subsequent investigation officers entered a suspect\u2019s apartment without a warrant. In the course of their search of the apartment for the suspect, held valid despite the lack of a warrant because it was made under exigent circumstances and was appropriately circumscribed, the officers saw a shopping bag imprinted with the name of the Alpha Beta Market within which they found rolls of coins from the robbed bank. All members of this court agreed with <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"13\">*13</page-number>Chief Justice Traynor that such evidence was admissible because \u201cWhile the officers were looking through the apartment for their suspect they could properly examine suspicious objects in plain sight. <em>(People </em>v. <em>Roberts, </em>47 Cal.2d 374, 378-380. . . .)\u201d <em>(People </em>V. <em>Gilbert, supra, </em>63 Cal.2d at p. 707.)<footnotemark>11</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b41-5\">Less than two years after <em>Thayer </em>and <em>Gilbert </em>were decided, the United States Supreme Court held in <em>Warden </em>v. <em>Hayden, supra, </em>387 U.S. 294, 300-310 [18 L.Ed.2d 782, 788-794], that the mere evidence rule was a \u201cFourth Amendment ruling\u201d <em>(id., </em>at p. 303 [18 L.Ed.2d at pp. 789-790]), not a procedural rule solely for federal courts. But citing <em>Thayer </em>as the leading case setting forth judicial opposition to the mere evidence rule <em>(Warden </em>v. <em>Hayden, supra, </em>387 U.S. at p. 300, fn. 6 [18 L.Ed.2d at p. 788]), <em>Warden </em>promptly labelled the mere evidence rule \u201cwholly irrational\u201d <em>(id., </em>at p. 302 [18 L.Ed.2d at p. 789]), and attributed its perpetuation \u201cmore to chance than considered judgment.\u201d <em>(Id., </em>at p. 308 [18 L.Ed.2d at p. 792].) Concluding that \u201cthere is no viable reason to distinguish intrusions to secure \u2018mere evidence\u2019 from intrusions to secure fruits, instrumentalities, or contraband\u201d <em>(id., </em>at p. 310 [18 L.Ed.2d at p. 794]), <em>Warden </em>upheld the admissibility of items of clothing found in the search without <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"14\">*14</page-number>a warrant of a house for a fugitive. The clothing had been introduced at the trial of a resident of the searched house to prove that he was the armed robber whom eyewitnesses had seen fleeing into the house where the clothing was found.</p>\n<p id=\"b42-4\">Reviewing <em>Roberts, Thayer, </em>and <em>Gilbert </em>in the light of <em>Warden, </em>we conclude therefrom that the police may effect plain view seizures of evidence found in the course of properly circumscribed cursory searches for suspects, free of former constitutional restrictions of such seizures to contraband or stolen property.</p>\n<p id=\"b42-5\">In the instant case, the officers entering the apartment were possessed of substantially contemporaneous information describing the container of contraband as a paper shop'ping bag.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> In the course of a lawful inspection of the premises he had entered, Officer Holt saw in plain sight a bag conforming to that described as bearing the hashish previously offered for sale to Del Sesto.</p>\n<p id=\"b42-6\">In a prosecution for offering drugs for sale, a bag found in the possession of the accused which matched an earlier description of the bag bearing the proffered drugs would itself be, even absent its contraband contents, relevant evidence of the presumably disputed fact that the accused had as alleged offered the drugs for sale. (Evid. Code, \u00a7 210.)<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> Thus under <em>Warden </em>v. <em>Hayden, supra, </em>287 U.S. 294, such a container could have itself been received at trial and was subject to seizure as evidence of a crime. We have previously distinguished an object which was merely a container concealing items of evidentiary value, and a seized object which itself was evidence of a crime and additionally contained within it other <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"15\">*15</page-number>items of evidentiary value. <em>(People </em>v. <em>Teale </em>(1969) 70 Cal.2d 497, 511 [75 Cal.Rptr. 172, 450 P.2d 564].)<footnotemark>14</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b43-5\">Intrinsic to the concept of \u201cplain view\u201d seizures is the proposition that such seizures, unlike searches, are not presumptively invalid whenever effected without the authority of a warrant.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> Nevertheless, such seizures must still comport with the ultimate Fourth Amendment requirement of reasonableness.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> We hold that in the particular circumstances of the case <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"16\">*16</page-number>before us, the seizure of the bag as evidence of the offense of offering hashish for sale was constitutionally reasonable. Here the bag had been described in advance to the arresting officers; when seen in plain view in the kitchen, the way in which the bag was neatly folded discounted its use as a mere trash bag.<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> (Cf. <em>People </em>v. <em>Krivda </em>(1971) 5 Cal.3d 357 [96 Cal.Rptr. 62, 486 P.2d 1262], judgment vacated and cause remanded <em>sub nom. California </em>v. <em>Krivda </em>(1972) 409 U.S. 33 [34 L.Ed.2d 45, 93 S.Ct. 32], opn. reiterated (1973) 8 Cal.3d 623 [105 Cal.Rptr. 521, 504 P.2d 457]; <em>People </em>v. <em>Edwards </em>(1969) 71 Cal.2d 1096 [80 Cal.Rptr. 633, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"17\">*17</page-number>458 P.2d 713].) These factors alone would not suffice as reasonable justification for the seizure, but Officer Holt also detected an odor of hashish which was strongest near the bag. The reasonableness of the seizure must be judged with due consideration to the total circumstances.<footnotemark>18</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b45-5\">Two additional elements must be weighed in the balance in the determination of the reasonableness of the seizure by Officer Holt. First, the bag was highly portable and second, as described to Holt, the contents of the bag consisted solely of the proffered hashish and nothing else. As will be discussed below, the power to seize carries with it the power to \u201csearch\u201d the seized item. Thus too liberal a rule of reasonableness for warrantless evidentiary seizures could quickly erode the general requirement of warrants as prerequisites to searches. Where contraband is believed to be hidden among several items within a container, such as a suitcase or a dresser drawer, seizure of the container may well be more difficult to justify. The type of container which may reasonably be seized as evidence <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"18\">*18</page-number>of a transaction involving narcotics is a container which reasonably appears to hold contraband and little else. Moreover, the less portable a container, the less subject it should be to warrantless seizure as evidence merely by virtue of its role as a container of contraband.</p>\n<p id=\"b46-4\">The above standards render clearly justifiable some types of plain view seizures of evidence \u2014 such as the seizure of a marijuana \u201cjoint\u201d even though the cigarette paper completely obscures the contraband itself from view. It is equally clear that the seizure of other literal containers of contraband would be insupportable\u2014such as the \u201cseizure\u201d of a suspect\u2019s entire house. We deem under the totality of circumstances heretofore described that Officer Holt could reasonably conclude that the bag matched the description and location of the bag containing the hashish baggies, gave the appearance of utilization for such storage, emanated a strong smell of hashish and was removable, and that its invasion constituted a minimum infringement of privacy. The seizure was thus constitutionally reasonable.</p>\n<p id=\"b46-5\">We have already noted in the context of Officer Holt\u2019s entry into the kitchen that when dealing with a seizure and search not subject to the warrant procedure \u201cour inquiry is a dual one\u2014whether the officer\u2019s action was justified at its inception, and whether it was reasonably related in scope to the circumstances which justified the interference in the first place.\u201d <em>(Terry </em>v. <em>Ohio, supra, </em>392 U.S. at pp. 19-20 [20 L.Ed.2d at p. 905].) Having determined that the seizure of the bag was reasonable, we turn now to the search of the bag after its seizure. Since the bag was seized as evidence, a search of its interior was \u201creasonably related in scope to the circumstances which justified the interference in the first place.\u201d Only by so searching the bag could Officer Holt confirm or discount his initial, constitutionally reasonable conclusion that it had evidentiary value.

Here the possibility of a violent defense of the valuable shipment of drugs offered for sale was an element in the totality of circumstances permitting a cursory search for additional suspects to be made in the apartment despite the lack of a warrant.

In addition, it is entirely reasonable for the arresting officer to search for and seize any evidence on the arrestee\u2019s person in order to prevent its concealment or destruction. And the area into which an arrestee might reach in order to grab a weapon or evidentiary items must, of course, be governed by a like rule. A gun on a table or in a drawer in front of one who is arrested can be as dangerous to the arresting officer as one concealed in the clothing of the person arrested.

The trial court found on substantial evidence that the entry was lawful for the purpose of rendering aid, hence the officers were justified in entering each room of the apartment to look for someone in distress. The radio was in plain sight and it fitted the general description of property known by the officers to be stolen. Under the circumstances, there appears to be no reason in law or common sense why one of the officers could not pick up the radio and examine it for the purpose of dispelling or confirming his suspicions. The fact that abuses sometimes occur during the course of criminal investigations should not give a sinister coloration to procedures which are basically reasonable.\u201d <em>(People </em>v. <em>Roberts, supra, </em>47 Cal.2d at pp. 378-380.)</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"10\">\n<p id=\"b40-5\">The term \u201ccontraband\u201d is one of common legal usage but imprecise legal meaning. Black\u2019s Law Dictionary defines it as: \u201cAgainst law or treaty; prohibited.\u201d (4th ed. (1957) at p. 393.) The term has been consciously defined in isolated cases as meaning property which is unlawfully possessed. (See <em>United States </em>v. <em>Old Dominion Warehouse, Inc. </em>(2d Cir. 1926) 10 F.2d 736, 738; <em>State </em>v. <em>Butler </em>(1929) 148 S.C. 495 [146 S.E. 418, 419].) Most cases merely use the term without defining it; this tacitly tautological usage is reflected in the Supreme Court\u2019s declaration that \u201ccontraband is indeed property in which the Government holds a superior [property] interest, but only because the Government decides to vest such an interest in itself. And while there may be limits to what may be declared contraband, the concept is hardly more than a form through which the Government seeks to prevent and deter crime.\u201d <em>(Warden v. Hayden, supra, </em>387 U.S. at p. 306, fn. 11 [18 L.Ed.2d at p. 792]; cf. <em>A day </em>v. <em>Superior Court </em>(1961) 55 Cal.2d 789, 800 [13 Cal.Rptr. 415, 362 P.2d 47].)</p>\n<p id=\"b40-6\">Proper usage would appear to convey the sense of property which can <em>only </em>be unlawfully possessed, as opposed to stolen property, which can be lawfully possessed by its rightful owner. The distinction between stolen property and contraband is particularly important in regard to plain view seizures. Generally contraband items bear indicia of unlawfulness on their face, while only knowledge of the unique characteristics of a particular chattel or of the circumstances surrounding its possession can establish that any given item of property has been stolen from another. Stolen property, unlike true contraband, does not advertise its own unlawfulness. As may be seen in our examination of the <em>Roberts </em>and <em>Gilbert </em>cases, positive identification of stolen property, as opposed to contraband, generally requires preliminary inspection of the item thought to have been stolen in order to establish, by going beyond the limits of what is \u201cin plain sight,\u201d whether or not the item is in fact stolen. Even though such \u201cinspections\u201d or \u201cexaminations\u201d take place within a residence without benefit of warrants, they have not been invalidated as \u201cper se\u201d unreasonable warrantless searches. This result has apparently been reached by treating the examination as an incident of the power to effect a plain view seizure even of a merely suspicious item, i.e., an item which an officer has probable cause to believe has been stolen, but which he must in fact \u201csearch\u201d in order to confirm is stolen. This rationale is consistent with the legal posture of plain view seizures and searches of items thus seized. Such seizures and searches incident thereto do not fall under the warrant procedure, and hence are governed by the objective standard of reasonableness, rather than probable cause to believe an offense has been or is being committed. (See fn. 16, <em>infra.)</em></p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"11\">\n<p id=\"b41-6\">As noted above, <em>People </em>v. <em>Gilbert </em>was \u201creversed on other grounds.\u201d On certiorari from our affirmance of Gilbert\u2019s convictions for robbery and murder, the United States Supreme Court held that Gilbert had been denied his Sixth Amendment right to counsel at a lineup at which he had been identified by several witnesses who subsequently testified against him at trial. <em>(Gilbert </em>v. <em>California </em>(1967) 388 U.S. 263 [18 L.Ed.2d 1178, 87 S.Ct. 1951].) The court accordingly vacated Gilbert\u2019s convictions and remanded the cause to us for determination of whether the witnesses had a source for their in-court identifications of Gilbert independent of and untainted by the prior illegal lineup. Having recalled our remittitur of the cause to the trial court, we then vacated our judgment affirming Gilbert\u2019s convictions, reversed the trial court\u2019s judgments of conviction and remanded the cause for retrial.</p>\n<p id=\"b41-7\">Although we thus vacated our judgment, we regard our statements of law made in <em>People </em>v. <em>Gilbert, supra, </em>63 Cal.2d 690, as remaining the law of this jurisdiction save insofar as specifically disapproved by this court or the United States Supreme Court. The search and seizure portions of <em>People </em>v. <em>Gilbert, supra, </em>have not been disapproved. Indeed, in <em>Gilbert </em>v. <em>California, supra, </em>388 U.S.' at page 269 [18 L.Ed.2d at page 1184], the Supreme Court vacated certiorari on this issue as improvidently granted. The court explained this action in an appendix: \u201cAssuming that the warrant-less entry into the apartment was justified by the need immediately to search for the suspect, the issue remains whether the subsequent search was reasonably supported by those same exigent circumstances. If the [evidence] were come upon in the course of a search for the suspect, the answer might be different from that where it is come upon, even though in plain view, in the course of a general, indiscriminate search of closets, dressers, etc., after it is known that the occupant is absent. Still different considerations may be presented where officers, pursuing the suspect, find that he is absent from the apartment but conduct a limited search for suspicious objects in plain view which might aid in the pursuit. The problem with the record in the present case is that it could reasonably support any of these factual conclusions upon which our constitutional analysis should rest . . . .\u201d <em>(Gilbert </em>v. <em>California, supra, </em>388 U.S. at pp. 274-275 [18 L.Ed.2d at p. 1187].)</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"12\">\n<p id=\"b42-7\">Officer Holt testified that the container was described to him as a paper shopping bag, without the color being given.

We have already indicated that the bag seized in this case was itself evidence independent of its contents.

By citing <em>Teale </em>as precedent for our decision in the instant case, we manifestly still adhere to the result reached in <em>Teale. </em>Nevertheless, we deem it proper to note that we have since <em>Teale </em>departed from the rationale expressed therein for upholding the inspection in that case of an object lawfully seized as evidence. In <em>Mozzetti </em>v. <em>Superior Court </em>(1971) 4 Cal.3d 699, 703-706 [94 Cal. Rptr. 412, 484 P.2d 84], we observed that <em>Terry </em>v. <em>Ohio, supra, </em>392 U.S. 1, 18, fn. 15 [20 L.Ed.2d p. 904], proscribed \u201coverly technical\u201d definitions of \u201csearch.\u201d Thus <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"19\">*19</page-number>the inspection of the vehicle in <em>Teale </em>was justifiable not because it fell outside the Fourth Amendment, but because that inspection, although a \u201csearch,\u201d was consistent with the reasonableness required by the Fourth Amendment. (See fn. 16, <em>supra.) </em>The seizure of the vehicle was premised on the reasonable supposition that it had been the site of a homicide. The only way to verify this supposition was to subject the vehicle to thorough examination by a criminalist.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"concurrence\">\n<author id=\"b47-8\">MOSK, J.</author>\n<p id=\"AB\">I concur in the judgment and in the scholarly analysis by the Chief Justice. However I have considerable difficulty with the rationale of footnote 18.</p>\n<p id=\"b47-9\">It is comforting that <em>People </em>v. <em>Marshall </em>(1968) 69 Cal.2d 51 [69 Cal. Rptr. 585, 442 P.2d 665] \u201cis no longer to be followed,\u201d but unfortunately the footnote in which that conclusion is reached also contains some confusing equivocation. In short, I agree with the People that this case is controlled by <em>Marshall </em>factually and legally; therefore the result reached here calls for a forthright overruling of <em>Marshall.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b47-10\">In the instant case we conclude that the officer\u2019s movement was justified as a warrantless search and that he \u201cthus infringed no constitutional mandate\u201d <em>(ante, </em>p. 10). In <em>Marshall </em>even the majority conceded that the officers were properly inside the premises. (69 Cal.2d at p. 56.) In this case the officer saw only \u201ca shopping bag with the opening squared shut\u201d; in <em>Marshall </em>the contraband was not in plain sight because it was contained <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"20\">*20</page-number>in \u201ca closed brown paper bag\u201d <em>(id. </em>at p. 56). In this case the \u201cdistinctive odor of hashish . . . seemed to come directly from the vicinity of the bag\u201d <em>(ante, </em>p. 5); in <em>Marshall </em>the odor came from the \u201cclosed brown paper bag\u201d (69 Cal.2d at p. 55).</p>\n<p id=\"b48-4\">All the majority of the sharply divided court permitted in <em>Marshall </em>was that \u201cofficers may rely on their sense of smell to <em>confirm </em>their observation of <em>already visible </em>contraband\u201d (italics added; 69 Cal.2d at p. 59). It was that unreasonable restriction which I decried in my dissent <em>(id. </em>at p. 63). I insisted then, and continue to believe, that the sense of smell, and indeed all the senses, may be employed, not merely in confirmation of what is already visible, but in equal weight with the sense of sight in the determination of probable cause to search and seize. For illustrations that demonstrate the impracticality of limiting valid discovery of evidence to that which is seen, or to the use of other senses merely in corroboration of what is already known or visible, see my dissent in <em>Marshall </em>(at p. 66).</p>\n<p id=\"b48-5\">For the reasons stated and in reliance upon the authorities cited in my dissent therein, I would expressly overrule <em>Marshall </em>more forthrightly than my colleagues do in footnote 18 of their opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b48-6\">McComb, J., Burke, J., and Clark, J., concurred.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
