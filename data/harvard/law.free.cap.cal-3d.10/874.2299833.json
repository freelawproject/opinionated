Skinner, M.D., and from a judgment entered on a jury verdict in favor of all the then remaining defendants. We discuss the appeals separately.</p>\n<p id=\"b877-8\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b877-9\">\n<em>Appeal from Judgment of Nonsuit</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b877-10\">Viewing the evidence under the well-settled rules governing nonsuits,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> we set forth the following pertinent facts.</p>\n<p id=\"b877-11\">In November 1961, shortly after moving from Oregon and enrolling in the Oakland public schools, plaintiff Mary Katherine Whitfield, then 10 years old, was examined by Dr. Philip Chamberlain, the school pediatrician. He found her to be an extremely thin, cachectic<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> child who appeared to have been neglected for Several months.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Disturbed by Mary\u2019s condition, he had her admitted to Children\u2019s Hospital of the East Bay, where she remained until December 1, 1961.</p>\n<p id=\"b878-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"878\">*878</page-number>On the day following her admission, Dr. Carrell A. Peterson, a radiologist at the hospital<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> X-rayed Mary to determine whether there was a tumor. After studying the X-ray films of Mary\u2019s skull, he concluded that they showed neither a tumor nor any other kind of abnormality. Indeed all tests conducted at the hospital failed to demonstrate any organic cause for Mary\u2019s extreme malnutrition. The staff at Children\u2019s Hospital finally diagnosed Mary\u2019s condition as anorexia nervosa, a psychiatric condition.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b878-4\">Mary was then sent home with the understanding that she would continue to receive treatment at the hospital as an outpatient on a long-term basis. This program included prescription of vitamin and hormone pills and continued consultation with defendant Dr. Kent A. Zimmerman, the staff psychiatrist. A concomitant of this program was intensive care at home. The hospital staff expressed concern that Mary\u2019s mother, Peggy Whitfield Chandler, would not provide the requisite home care for a number of reasons pertaining to her behavior and her attitude toward Mary\u2019s condition. Mary failed to keep many appointments and by February 1962 had stopped coming to the hospital altogether.</p>\n<p id=\"b878-5\">About eight months later Dr. Joel Levine discovered Mary late at night in the locked and unlighted outpatient clinic of the Presbyterian Medical Center. He treated her for a monkey bite. On her return two days later he attempted to ascertain the cause of her emaciated condition. Unable to discover any organic cause, he referred her to the hospital\u2019s psychiatric clinic for treatment in accordance with a diagnosis of anorexia nervosa. However, Mary\u2019s mother refused to cooperate.</p>\n<p id=\"b878-6\">Nearly a year later, Mary visited defendant Dr. Clifford L. Feiler for an earache and a respiratory condition. He also was concerned about Mary\u2019s condition and urged her mother to have Mary tested exhaustively. Her mother continued to be uncooperative. Three months later, on September 19, 1963, Mrs. Chandler took Mary to defendant Dr. David Johnson, a pediatrician, for a physical check-up, because she thought Mary had leukemia. Dr. Johnson concluded that Mary did not have leukemia, but noting among other things her emaciated condition, recommended a series of tests. His recommendations were not accepted.</p>\n<p id=\"b878-7\">On October 2, 1963, Mary was admitted to Contra Costa County Hospital (County Hospital) for a diagnostic work-up. She was examined by Dr. Skinner, who initially concluded Mary might be suffering from leukemia, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"879\">*879</page-number>metabolic disorder or brain tumor. In his initial examination, Dr. Skinner ruled out both leukemia and thyroid disease as a cause of the metabolic disorder. On October 3, Mary was examined by Dr. Hart, a pediatrician, who ordered a psychiatric consultation on the basis of the examination, further confirmed by information from Children\u2019s Hospital that her condition had been diagnosed there as anorexia nervosa.</p>\n<p id=\"b879-5\">On October 4, Mary was examined by Dr. Cramer, a psychiatric consultant to the County Hospital. Based upon his examination of Mary, Dr. Cramer felt that organic brain disease\u2014specifically craniopharyngioma\u2014 was the most likely possibility, and suggested that a series of tests be conducted including a skull X-ray, electroencephalogram, \u201cpsychological,\u201d a neurological examination and a visual fields test. Dr. Cramer was led to suspect craniopharyngioma because he had run across an almost identical case during his residency. Unfortunately, none of the other staff members appreciated the significance of his diagnosis and most of the tests were not performed. Dr. Hart thought Dr. Cramer\u2019s suggestion of craniopharyngioma an unusually specific diagnosis, but \u201c[m]y interpretation was that he was really rather winging it.\u201d Neither Dr. Hart nor Dr. Skinner had ever witnessed or treated a case of craniopharyngioma; both thought there was- a possibility of brain tumor.</p>\n<p id=\"b879-6\">While she was in the hospital, Mary was very unhappy, given to repeated crying spells and unable to gain weight. Because of this, condition she was discharged from the hospital on October 11, 1963. On that date, Dr. Skinner wrote the following note on Mary\u2019s chart. \u201cAll consultations are in now. No definite diagnosis. Dr. Colony suggests arachnodactaly. Will discharge to Pediatrics Clinic for followup.\u201d On October 15, 1963, Dr. Lee of the County Hospital telephoned Dr. Johnson and informed him that \u201cHe and the staff at Contra Costa Hospital have come to the same conclusion independently that the primary problem is psychiatric anorexia nervosa and that there is no evidence in the studies performed to indicate organic disease. . . . [Mother] has of her own accord continued to tell people that Mary has leukemia.\u201d On the same day Dr. Lee noted that he had told Mary\u2019s mother that Mary has no sign of leukemia or any malignant disease. Dr. Lee did not mention that the staff doctors considered the diagnosis incomplete, that there was an impression that a brain tumor was possible, or that tests to determine the existence of this tumor had not yet been completed. Upon Mary\u2019s discharge from County Hospital, notwithstanding the conclusion of the staff,<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> her chart contained the following notation entered by Dr. Skinner: \u201cFinal diagnosis: anorexia nervosa.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b880-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"880\">*880</page-number>Eleven days later, on October 22, 1963, Mary was readmitted to Children\u2019s Hospital. Dr. Sheaff, the admitting doctor, made a report as set forth in the margin.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> However, the hospital made no contact with any of the doctors or hospitals who had examined Mary since her discharge from Children\u2019s Hospital two years earlier. Dr. Browning, who was in charge of Mary\u2019s case during this period of hospitalization, concluded that the original diagnosis of anorexia nervosa had been and was still correct. Upon Mary\u2019s discharge on October 31, 1963, Dr. Browning and Mrs. Simonds, a social worker, tried hard to convince Mrs. Chandler that Mary\u2019s real problem was psychiatric and that she needed long-term treatment on an outpatient basis.</p>\n<p id=\"b880-4\">Within a month, on November 25, 1963, Mary commenced treatment with defendant Dr. Arthur Roth, a pediatrician with a psychotherapeutic background. Dr. Roth neither saw, nor indeed requested, any of the medical or hospital records chronicling Mary\u2019s long history. Instead he telephoned Dr. Browning at Children\u2019s Hospital and Dr. Johnson, and obtained their summarized version of the medical history, namely that there was neither leukemia nor any organic disease and that the diagnosis was anorexia nervosa. Dr. Roth concurred in this diagnosis and accordingly provided Mary psychotherapeutic treatment. His treatment had quite startling success: by May 1, 1964, Mary\u2019s weight increased from 50 to 69 pounds.</p>\n<p id=\"b880-5\">However, during April, May, and increasingly in June 1964, Mary\u2019s concomitant symptoms of headache, vomiting and eye trouble, recurred and intensified. Dr. Roth, concerned about Mary\u2019s headache and eye problems, sent her to Dr. Allington, an ophthalmologist. When Dr. Roth learned on June 22, <em>1964, </em>that Mary was seeing double, he wrote Mrs. Chandler informing her that Dr. Allington had not completed his examination of Mary\u2019s eyes and prescribed some pills for the vomiting. Two days later Mrs. Chandler informed him that Mary was suffering from a stiff neck and backache as well as continued vomiting. Believing that she needed immediate attention, Dr. Roth sent Mary to Highland Hospital. There, defendant Dr. Rich<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"881\">*881</page-number>ard L. Wacht, after taking a spinal tap concluded that Mary was not acutely ill and discharged her. Mrs. Chandler became incensed.</p>\n<p id=\"b881-5\">Two or three days later, Mary came under the care of another pediatrician, defendant Dr. Stanley Fischer, who sent her to Providence Hospital for a skull X-ray. On July 3, 1964, Dr. Bunche examined that X-ray and concluded that Mary had a craniopharyngioma, a type of brain tumor. On July 7, 1964, Mary was admitted for the third time, to Children\u2019s Hospital where the diagnosis of a craniopharyngioma was confirmed. On July 10, Dr. Wyand surgically removed the tumor.</p>\n<p id=\"b881-6\">Although her post-operative recovery was at first normal, suddenly on July 22, she suffered a stroke. As a result she became totally paralyzed in both legs and in her right arm. She could use her left hand and arm but was unable to feed herself or change her position in bed. She could barely speak and communicated poorly through gestures. She required permanent hospitalization. There was evidence at the time of trial that she had a life expectancy of 20 years.</p>\n<p id=\"b881-7\">Mrs. Chandler believing that there may have been some malpractice on the part of one or more of the various doctors and hospitals, attempted to obtain counsel for the purpose of securing redress for Mary. Unsuccessful at first, on February 9, 1965, she finally retained attorney Harry Gonick.</p>\n<p id=\"b881-8\">On March 24, 1965, plaintiffs, represented by Mr. Gonick brought the instant action asserting liability against the various doctors and hospitals who had examined or treated Mary, except defendant County of Contra Costa as operator of the County Hospital but including nevertheless defendant Dr. Skinner. The complaint set forth two separately stated causes of action: the first by Mary by Mrs. Chandler as guardian ad litem for general and special damages and the second by Mrs. Chandler, individually, for past and future medical and hospital expenses.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b881-9\">On June 16, 1965, plaintiffs filed a first amended complaint as of course. On October 19, 1965, pursuant to discovery proceedings plaintiffs obtained Mary\u2019s records at the County Hospital and discovered for the first time that Dr. Cramer had tentatively diagnosed a craniopharyngioma and had recommended a series of tests in order to determine whether there was a craniopharyngioma, that those tests had not been performed, that Dr. Skinner also had thought a brain tumor possible, that none of this had been revealed to Mrs. Chandler, and that the County Hospital had positively represented the absence of any organic disease.</p>\n<p id=\"b882-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"882\">*882</page-number>On November 19, 1965, plaintiffs presented to defendant County their claim in the sum of $1,020,000. (Gov. Code, \u00a7\u00a7 911.2, 915.) It was denied four days later. They did not apply to the County for leave to file a late claim. (Gov. Code, \u00a7 911.4.) On January 28, 1966, plaintiffs filed a second amended complaint adding the County as a defendant, asserting particular charges of liability against certain defendants<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> and reiterating their original position as to the remaining defendants that they had been joined so that it could be determined to what, if any extent, any or all of them were liable. (See fn. 8, <em>ante.)</em></p>\n<p id=\"b882-4\">The first cause of action by Mary alleged that the facts asserting liability against the County and its employees \u201cwere concealed from and not discovered by the plaintiffs until after October 19, 1965, when the records of Contra Costa County Hospital were made available to plaintiffs\u2019 attorneys under a subpoena duces tecum. That, by virtue of such concealment, plaintiffs\u2019 causes of action did not come into existence until such discovery, under Section 901 of the Government Code; that within 100 days after the accrual of said causes of action, to wit: On November 19, 1965, a claim was duly presented to the County of Contra Costa, in accordance with the applicable provisions of the Government Code, and said claim was thereafter denied on November 23, 1965.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b882-5\">The second cause of action, by Mrs. Chandler individually, incorporated by reference the above and other allegations, alleged that the facts asserting liability against the County and Dr. Skinner were concealed and not discovered by this plaintiff until after October 19, 1965, when the medical records at the County Hospital were made available, and further alleged that the facts constituting her cause of action against the defendant radiologists were concealed from her by them and not discovered until November 19, 1965, after a reexamination of X-rays taken at Children\u2019s Hospital in 1961, and further that as to the remaining defendants she did not discover the facts constituting her cause of action until July 5, 1964,<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> \u201cwhen the said ill effects of their negligence and lack of skill manifested themselves.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b883-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"883\">*883</page-number>At the commencement of the trial on February 24, 1969, plaintiff Peggy Whitfield Chandler dismissed the second cause of action brought by her individually and thereafter the case proceeded to trial with Mary Whitfield as the sole plaintiff. At. the conclusion of said plaintiff\u2019s case in chief, the County and Dr. Skinner moved for a nonsuit on the ground that Mary had failed to present a timely claim against the County. The court granted their motion and entered judgment accordingly. As previously noted, Mary has appealed from such judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b883-5\">The question confronting us on this appeal is whether, under the rules governing nonsuit, there is sufficient evidence in the record to support a finding that plaintiff\u2019s claim against defendant County was timely filed. We begin with the basic requirement of the California Tort Claims Act that a claim against a public entity for damages for personal injuries must be presented to it in writing not later than the 100th day after the accrual of the cause of action on which the claim is based. (Gov. Code, \u00a7 911.2.)<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> Presentation and rejection of such a claim are conditions precedent to the commencement of suit against the public entity on the cause of action for which the claim is required. (\u00a7 945.4.)<footnotemark>12</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b883-6\">These claims provisions apply to minors. <em>(Artukovich </em>v. <em>Astendorf </em>(1942) 21 Cal.2d 329 [131 P.2d 831]; <em>Wozniak </em>v. <em>Peninsula Hospital </em>(1969) 1 Cal.App.3d 716, 723 [82 Cal.Rptr. 84]; see <em>Williams </em>v. <em>Los Angeles Metropolitan Transit Authority </em>(1968) 68 Cal.2d 599 [68 Cal.Rptr. 297, 440 P.2d 4971; <em>Tammen </em>v. <em>County of San Diego </em>(1967) 66 Cal.2d 468, 479-480 [58 Cal.Rptr. 249, 426 P.2d 753].) Indeed they apply with greater liberality to minors, since under the provisions of sec<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"884\">*884</page-number>tion 911.4<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> and section 911.6,<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> an application for leave to present a late claim made by a claimant who has been a minor throughout the entire 100-day claim presentation period <em>must </em>be granted by the board.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> <em>(Tammen </em>v. <em>County of San Diego, supra, </em>66 Cal.2d 468, 479-480; <em>Hom </em>v. <em>Chico Unified Sch. Dist. </em>(1967) 254 Cal.App.2d 335, 338-339 [61 Cal.Rptr. 920].)<footnotemark>16</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b884-4\">It is necessary, therefore, first to consider what is meant by the phrase \u201caccrual of the cause of action on which the claim is based\u201d which event by virtue of the provisions of section 911.2 starts the running of the 100-day claim presentation period and, secondly, to determine whether Mary presented her claim within such period.</p>\n<p id=\"b884-5\">Section 901 provides that for the purpose of computing the above time limit prescribed by section 911.2 \u201cthe date of the accrual of a cause of ac<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"885\">*885</page-number>tion to which a claim relates is the date upon which the cause of action would be deemed to have accrued within the meaning of the statute of limitations which would be applicable thereto if there were no requirement that <em>a </em>claim be presented to and be acted upon by the public entity before an action could be commenced thereon.\u201d Thus in the case at bench the date of accrual for the purpose of starting the claim presentation period \u201cis the same as for the statute of limitations which would otherwise be applicable. [Citation.]\u201d <em>(Wozniak </em>v. <em>Peninsula Hospital, supra, </em>1 Cal. App.3d at p. 722.)  As the court in <em>Wozniak </em>also made clear, \u201cIn a suit for malpractice the statute of limitations commences to run. when the plaintiff discovers the injury <em>and its negligent cause </em>or through the exercise of reasonable diligence should have discovered it.\u201d <em>(Id.) </em>(Italics added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b885-6\">Where the plaintiff is a minor, it is not the knowledge or lack thereof of the minor, but the knowledge or lack thereof of the minor\u2019s parents which determines the time of accrual of the cause of action. <em>(Wozniak. </em>v. <em>Peninsula Hospital, supra, </em>1 Cal.App.3d 716, 723; <em>Myers </em>v. <em>Stevenson </em>(1954) 125 Cal.App.2d 399, 403 [270 P.2d 885].)  Therefore Mary\u2019s cause of action for damages for medical malpractice against the County accrued when Mary\u2019s mother, Mrs. Chandler, discovered, or through the exercise of reasonable diligence should have discovered Mary\u2019s injury and its negligent cause. It was then required that not later than the 100th day after such date of accrual, a claim relating to such cause of action be presented to the County by Mary or on her behalf. Since her claim was presented on November 19, 1965, her cause of action must not have accrued earlier than August 11, 1965. Our task, then, is to ascertain whether under the familiar rules governing nonsuits there is any evidence in the record showing, or from which it can be reasonably inferred, that Mary\u2019s cause of action accrued subsequent to August 11, 1965.</p>\n<p id=\"b885-7\">We begin by considering at length the case of <em>Wozniak </em>v. <em>Peninsula Hospital, supra, </em>1 Cal.App.3d 716, not-merely because it is germane to the question before us but particularly because it is so close on its facts and in its application of relevant principles as to constitute highly persuasive authority.</p>\n<p id=\"b885-8\">In <em>Wozniak, </em>Christine Wozniak, a two-year-old minor, otherwise in good health, was operated on to correct a crossed eye and during the operation <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"886\">*886</page-number>suffered a cardiac arrest, causing extensive brain and nerve damage. She was discharged from the hospital three months later, but continued to receive independent treatment for the damage to her legs. Six months after the operation, a nurse engaged to give therapy treatments informed the Wozniaks that Christine\u2019s legs might not have been in such condition if the hospital had given her passive physical therapy sooner. Fourteen months after the operation the Wozniaks, consulting an attorney about the hospital bill, were then informed that they might have a claim for negligence. One month later, and about 15 months after the operation, they filed a claim pursuant to section 911.2.</p>\n<p id=\"b886-4\">Observing that in determining whether the parents exercised reasonable diligence in discovering the negligence of the hospital, \u201ctheir action should be liberally interpreted with a view to protecting [Christine\u2019s] rights as a minor\u201d <em>(Wozniak </em>v. <em>Peninsula Hospital, supra, </em>1 Cal.App.3d at p. 723), the court concluded that there had been no unreasonable delay on their part as a matter of law and reversed a summary judgment in favor of the hospital. \u201cThe question of when there has been a belated discovery of the cause of action, especially in malpractice cases, is essentially a question of fact. The facts and circumstances of the medical treatment rendered a patient are within the exclusive knowledge of the hospital and the attending physicians. It is difficult to understand how an injured person could discover the cause of the injury until he has obtained that information.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 725.)</p>\n<p id=\"b886-5\">The <em>Wozniak </em>court reasoned that while the parents were aware of their child\u2019s abnormal physical and mental condition after the operation, they had no specific information that the condition was due either to the operation itself or to lack of hospital care. Accordingly, the court held that whether the parents should have believed the condition to be a result of negligence was a question of fact. While reasonable persons might have been alerted by the nurse-therapist\u2019s statement, it was also reasonable for the parents to have given it no credence. Finally, the court concluded that since a trier of fact would be warranted in finding that the parents relied on their doctors to keep them informed, it could not be said as a matter of law that the 11-month period after the child\u2019s discharge from the hospital was an unreasonable delay in making inquiry as to the cause of injury.</p>\n<p id=\"b886-6\">The facts in the case at bench, viewed in the light of the same guiding principles, fall well within the factual boundaries just described. The County argues that the cause of action accrued as to the County and Dr. Skinner in July 1964 when Mary\u2019s mother discovered that Mary in fact had a craniopharyngioma. At that time, according to the County\u2019s theory, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"887\">*887</page-number>Mary\u2019s mother knew that all the previous doctors and hospitals had misdiagnosed Mary\u2019s condition, since they had unanimously concluded that she suffered from anorexia nervosa and that she therefore knew the alleged negligence, namely failure to diagnose a brain tumor.<footnotemark>17</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b887-5\">Plaintiff, on the other hand, argues that although her mother knew of the diagnosis of a craniopharyngioma in July 1964 at Children\u2019s Hospital, of the subsequent operation and of the tragic post-operative events and although she felt that Mary\u2019s condition after the operation was not normal, she did not know whether the condition was negligently caused. The record reflects that in October 1963, Mrs. Chandler was informed by the County Hospital that Mary was then suffering not from an organic disease but from a psychiatric disorder called anorexia nervosa; in July 1964, nine months later, she knew that there <em>was </em>an organic disease, namely craniopharyngioma. However, she did not know whether the craniopharyngioma was detectable nine months earlier; whether, if detectable, the County was negligent in not detecting its existence; or whether, the County did detect its possible existence and then negligently failed to pursue the diagnosis; or whether the County did detect its existence and decided not to reveal its presence; or indeed, whether the failure to detect the tumor contributed to the tragic side effects of its removal.</p>\n<p id=\"b887-6\">At this point Mrs. Chandler\u2019s position was analogous to that of the Wozniaks\u2019 following Christine\u2019s operation\u2014the Wozniaks knew that a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"888\">*888</page-number>cardiac arrest followed by severe damage was an abnormal reaction to the crossed-eye operation, but did not know what caused this result, or if it had been caused by the negligence of the hospital. Additionally the <em>Wozniak </em>court concluded that the mere statement of the nurse-therapist was insufficient to alert the parents as to the possible negligence of the hospital.</p>\n<p id=\"b888-4\">Defendants contend that <em>Wozniak </em>is distinguishable from the instant case because Mrs. Chandler acted out her suspicion that Mary had been wronged by contacting attorneys to file a malpractice action and by writing a letter to a newspaper chronicling Mary\u2019s sad medical history. All that these actions indicate is that Mrs. Chandler\u2019s suspicion of some wrong was sufficiently strong to impel her to seek redress. The first two attorneys whom she contacted refused to accept employment. The letter was not published. In no way did these efforts increase her knowledge of facts constituting the negligent cause of the injury. Indeed, even when Mrs. Chandler retained Mr. Gonick in February 1965, although of course aware of Mary\u2019s condition, she had not yet discovered its negligent cause. The evidence does not ineluctably lead to the sole conclusion that she had such knowledge; on the contrary, not until the examination of the medical records on October 19, 1965, did she discover the negligent cause of plaintiff\u2019s injury.</p>\n<p id=\"b888-5\">This does not end our inquiry. We must determine whether on the present record it can be inferred that Mrs. Chandler exercised reasonable diligence in discovering the negligent cause of the injury. Or to put it another way, we must decide whether it can be said <em>as a matter of law </em>that Mrs. Chandler \u201cthrough the exercise of reasonable diligence should have discovered it.\u201d <em>(Wozniak </em>v. <em>Peninsula Hospital, supra, </em>1 Cal.App.3d at p. 722.)</p>\n<p id=\"b888-6\">Mr. Gonick in his testimony concerning the extent of Mrs. Chandler\u2019s knowledge of the injury sustained by her daughter revealed that he had found her as confused and difficult as had the doctors in the case<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> and that he had been unable either from the information conveyed to him by Mrs. Chandler or from his own investigations made from February 9, 1965 to March 24, 1965, to assemble sufficient proof of the claimed malpractice. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"889\">*889</page-number>As a result, according to his testimony, he filed an admittedly exploratory complaint alleging negligence on the part of almost all the doctors and hospitals that treated Mary, but conceding lack of knowledge as to which defendants were negligent and in what ways. Unfortunately, the record before us does not reveal why the County had not been included among such named defendants. Finally on October 19, 1965, Mr. Gonick examined the subpoenaed hospital records and discovered the facts allegedly constituting the negligent cause of the injury which could be brought home t\u00f3 the County and Dr. Skinner. At that time it was discovered that Dr. Cramer had diagnosed and had recommended a series of tests for a possible craniopharyngioma, that most of the tests were not performed, that none of these events had been disclosed to Mrs. Chandler, and that on the contrary the County and its employees had represented to her that there were no signs of organic disease.</p>\n<p id=\"b889-5\">We conclude that Mrs. Chandler was reasonably diligent in pursuing her suspicion of possible negligence on the part of the various doctors and hospitals, including the County and Dr. Skinner.<footnotemark>19</footnotemark> Indeed, it is difficult to conceive what more she could have done. She contacted two attorneys and wrote a long letter to a newspaper within three months of the final diagnosis and operation. All these efforts proved unavailing. Nevertheless she persisted, and finally persuaded Mr. Gonick to explore the matter. There is no evidence whatsoever that the latter was not reasonably diligent in pursuing discovery or that the examination of the hospital records on October 19, 1965, was unreasonably delayed.</p>\n<p id=\"b889-6\">Since it appears from the evidence considered in the light of the applicable rules (see fn. 1; ante) that plaintiff\u2019s cause of action accrued within 100 days prior to the presentation of her claim to defendant County on November 19, 1965, it was error to grant said defendants\u2019 motion for a nonsuit. Accordingly, we reverse the judgment of nonsuit.<footnotemark>20</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b890-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"890\">*890</page-number>II</p>\n<p id=\"b890-4\">\n<em>Appeal from the Judgment on the Verdict</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b890-5\">We now take up plaintiff\u2019s appeal from the judgment entered on the verdict in favor of the remaining defendants. Making no attack on the sufficiency of the evidence to support the verdict she contends (1) that one of the attorneys for defendants committed prejudicial misconduct; and (2) that the court erred in admitting certain evidence. We find no merit in any of the points raised. We therefore affirm that judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b890-6\">At the outset of trial, Mr. Craddick, one of the defense attorneys, informed other counsel and the court that his wife was expecting their first baby any day and that he had promised her he would be present with her when the time came. It was agreed, in chambers, that should this happy event occur during the course of trial, the court would recess on that day. Mr. Gonick, attorney for plaintiff, requested that the jury not be informed as to the reason for Mr. Craddick\u2019s absence as he did not wish that \u201cundue emphasis should be placed on the fact that [Craddick\u2019s] wife was expecting a child.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b890-7\">The Craddick baby was born early in the morning of March 11, 1969. Court was adjourned that day and the trial postponed one day; through inadvertence, however, the jury was not informed in advance of the continuance. Upon their arrival at court the jurors were advised that the trial had been continued due to Mr. Craddick\u2019s absence but in accordance with the agreement, were not told the reason.</p>\n<p id=\"b890-8\">On the same morning, Mr. Heafey, one of the defense counsel, upon entering the courthouse observed Mr. Gonick and his wife conversing with Mrs. Chretien, one of the jurors. Mr. Heafey demanded an explanation and according to Heafey, Mr. Gonick responded as follows: \u201cWell, the juror is all upset at Craddick, that she was over there telling me that it wasn\u2019t fair to not pay her for that day, and that she had to get back\u2014that she wasn\u2019t told that she did not have to come down here, and then be sent back home without getting paid, and that she was very upset.\u201d Mr. Gonick reported the substance of this conversation to the trial judge.</p>\n<p id=\"b890-9\">On the following morning before the trial resumed, Mr. Craddick returned to the courtroom with cigars and candy. Neither the judge nor the jury were yet present. Mr. Craddick distributed the candy and cigars to counsel, including Mr. Gonick, and to the court attaches. Upon being in<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"891\">*891</page-number>formed of the jury\u2019s resentment at his unexplained absence, Mr. Craddick wrote a note, \u201cIt\u2019s a boy\u201d on a card and asked the bailiff to take the note along with two cigars and a box of candy to the jury in the jury room. Plaintiff contends that Mr. Gonick was at that time unaware of the gift and message to the jury.</p>\n<p id=\"b891-5\">Upon resumption of the trial, the judge made reference to the birth of the Craddick baby but was apparently unaware of the distribution of candy and cigars to the jurors.<footnotemark>21</footnotemark> Although Mr. Gonick later learned of the incident and initially forebore from entering any objection, he subsequently changed his mind and moved for a mistrial.<footnotemark>22</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b891-6\">Observing that it was customary to give cigars and candy in celebration of a birth, the court denied the motion. It denied a similar motion one week later. The incident was also made a basis of plaintiff\u2019s motion for a new trial which was also denied.</p>\n<p id=\"b891-7\">As the main reason for reversing the judgment on the verdict, plaintiff now contends that the above-mentioned conduct of Mr. Craddick constituted prejudicial conduct as a matter of law. Relying upon a number of decisions both in California and other jurisdictions dealing with \u201cgifts\u201d to jurors, she argues that conduct like that now under examination requires automatic reversal.</p>\n<p id=\"b891-8\">We pointed out in <em>Horn </em>v. <em>Atchison T. &amp; S. F. Ry. Co. </em>(1964) 61 Cal.2d 602, 610 [39 Cal.Rptr. 721, 394 P.2d 561], that \u201cGenerally a claim of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"892\">*892</page-number>misconduct is entitled to no consideration on appeal unless the record shows a timely and proper objection and a request that the jury be admonished. ... In the absence of a timely objection the offended party is deemed to have waived the claim of error through his participation in the atmosphere which produced the claim of prejudice.\u201d (See 4 Witkin, Cal. Procedure (2d ed. 1971) p. 2982 et seq., pointing out the necessity of assigning the allegedly objectionable conduct as misconduct and asking that the jury be instructed to disregard it. \u201cIf this is not done the error is waived unless the misconduct was of so aggravated a character that it could not be cured by any instruction.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 2983.))</p>\n<p id=\"b892-4\">In the instant case we make two observations. First, there is no question but that Mr. Craddick\u2019s conduct was improper and constituted misconduct. However innocent in purpose, it was at least an act of bad judgment. But, to come to the second point, plaintiff\u2019s counsel made no attempt to assign his opponent\u2019s behavior as misconduct. Indeed he appears to have been willing to overlook the incident in return for concessions in respect to the production of evidence. Quite apart from indicating that plaintiff\u2019s counsel probably regarded the incident as of little significance, this state of affairs certainly emphasizes his failure to object. We therefore conclude that plaintiff has waived the misconduct unless, as previously pointed out, it was of such an egregious nature that it could not have been cured by a corrective instruction to the jury.</p>\n<p id=\"b892-5\">In <em>Horn </em>we quoted the language of this court in <em>Tingley </em>v. <em>Times-Mirror Co. </em>(1907) 151 Cal. 1, 23 [89 P. 1097]: \u201cIt is only in extreme cases that the court, when acting promptly and speaking clearly and directly on the subject, cannot, by instructing the jury to disregard such matters, correct the impropriety of the act of counsel and remove any effect his conduct or remarks would otherwise have.\u201d <em>(Horn </em>v. <em>Atchison, T. &amp; S. F. Ry Co., supra, </em>61 Cal.2d 602, 610.) Only misconduct so prejudicial that an admonishment would be ineffective excuses the failure to request such admonishment. <em>(Hoffman </em>v. <em>Brandt </em>(1966) 65 Cal.2d 549 [55 Cal.Rptr. 417, 421 P.2d 425].)</p>\n<p id=\"b892-6\">Conduct such as that involved in this case strikes close to the heart of the jury\u2019s integrity. We believe that such integrity must be held sacrosanct and provided with the sternest protection from the slightest whisper of importuning on the part of counsel. As we have said, although Mr. Craddick\u2019s conduct may have resulted only from bad judgment, we are of the opinion that it was improper. Nevertheless under the circumstances of the case, we are satisfied that any effect it might have had on the jury could have been entirely removed by an admonishing instruction. We should give <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"893\">*893</page-number>weight to the trial judge\u2019s appraisal of the incident; the implication of his remarks is that what has been deemed a customary gesture in everyday life, was unthinkingly and unfortunately brought into the courtroom where it had no place. As such, it is highly unlikely that it was regarded as anything but such a custom, which incidentally had been extended to everyone in the courtroom. It was not done secretly, but in open court, in the presence of opposing counsel, under the assumption that opposing counsel knew what was happening. The trial judge concluded there was no prejudicial effect. Counsel himself appeared to regard it with minimal concern. These circumstances make it clear that at most plaintiff was entitled to an admonishing instruction.</p>\n<p id=\"b893-5\">Plaintiff next contends that the opinions of 54 physicians, none of whom testified in court, offered to prove that there was nothing on the 1961 X-rays to suggest the existence of a craniopharyngioma, were hearsay and that it was prejudicially erroneous to admit this testimony. We agree this testimony was hearsay and that it was erroneously admitted. However, we have concluded that the admission of this testimony was harmless error.</p>\n<p id=\"b893-6\">It will be recalled from the factual narrative earlier in this opinion that on November 18, 1961, skull X-rays were taken of Mary at Children\u2019s Hospital, because the public school pediatrician thought that Mary\u2019s cachectic condition might be due to a brain tumor. The radiologist at Children\u2019s Hospital, Dr. Peterson, examined the X-ray and concluded that there was no sign of abnormality, no calcification, no erosion, no tumor.</p>\n<p id=\"b893-7\">Mary\u2019s condition persisted, but no new skull X-rays were taken until July 3, 1964. At that time a brain tumor, a craniopharyngioma, was diagnosed. Plaintiff contended that the radiologists at Children\u2019s Hospital negligently failed to detect the existence of the tumor when they examined the X-ray in 1961.</p>\n<p id=\"b893-8\">Defendant radiologists called three doctors to give their opinion whether . the 1961 X-rays showed the claimed tumor and whether a radiologist, applying the prevailing standard of medical practice, should have discerned the abnormality. Dr. Thomas Newton, a radiological expert, testified that in his opinion the X-rays were normal. He further testified that in his opinion a report by a radiologist that the X-rays showed no abnormality would conform to the standard of practice in the applicable area at the applicable time. Dr. Newton then testified over objection that in the presence of defense counsel he had called in four other supposedly neurological and radiological experts at his place of employment, showed them the 1961 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"894\">*894</page-number>X-rays, described Mary\u2019s symptoms as of 1961 and asked them whether they detected any abnormality in the X-rays.<footnotemark>23</footnotemark> Dr. Newton then testified that none of the four doctors detected any abnormality.</p>\n<p id=\"b894-4\">Dr. Lawrence Arnstein, a neurosurgeon with substantial experience relating to craniopharyngiomas, testified that he examined the 1961 X-rays and that it was his opinion that the X-rays showed no abnormal calcification. He then testified over objection that he presented the X-ray films at \u201cgrand rounds at Stanford\u201d to the students, resident staff and faculty doctors, about 50 in number.<footnotemark>24</footnotemark> He related Mary\u2019s symptoms as of 1961 to the group and asked whether any one then present could see any abnormality in the films.</p>\n<p id=\"b894-5\">The objection was overruled and Dr. Arnstein testified that everyone present was competing to detect any kind of possible abnormality and that he regarded the fact that no one reported seeing any abnormality as significant. Moreover, he then showed them the 1964 X-ray films showing the abnormality and asked them whether by seeing the films together could they now find something abnormal in the 1961 film.</p>\n<p id=\"b894-6\">Dr. Arnstein then testified over plaintiff\u2019s objection on the ground of hearsay that \u201cthere continued to be no one, even knowing what the child subsequently developed, no one felt the film taken in 1961 demonstrated any significant pathology.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b894-7\">It is obvious that the testimony concerning the opinion of the other doctors who were not present in court, and who had not been qualified as experts was hearsay. \u201c \u2018The reason for this is obvious. The opportunity of cross-examining the other doctors as to the basis for their opinion, etc., is denied the party as to whom the testimony is adverse.\u2019 \u201d <em>(Lynch Meats of Oakland, Inc. </em>v. <em>City of Oakland </em>(1961) 196 Cal.App.2d 104, 112 [16 Cal.Rptr. 302]; <em>Frampton </em>v. <em>Hartzell </em>(1960) 179 Cal.App.2d 771, 773 [4 Cal.Rptr. 427].)</p>\n<p id=\"b894-8\">Defendants contend, however, that the testimony concerning the opinions</p>\n<p id=\"b895-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"895\">*895</page-number>of the other doctors was admissible to show the basis of the testifying doctor\u2019s opinion under the doctrine of limited admissibility as applied in <em>Kelley </em>v. <em>Bailey </em>(1961) 189 Cal.App.2d 728, 737-738 [11 Cal.Rptr. 448].<footnotemark>25</footnotemark> This rule has no application to the case at bench for two reasons. First, the opinions of the out-of-court doctors in this case were not used by either testifying doctor in the course of treatment or diagnosis of plaintiff. They were consulted as experts and then called as witnesses to offer expert opinion evidence. It is clear that doctors can testify as to the basis of their opinion (see Witkin, Cal. Evidence (2d ed. 1966) \u00a7 410, pp. 368-369), but this is not intended to be a channel by which testifying doctors can place the opinion of innumerable out-of-court doctors before the jury.<footnotemark>26</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b895-5\">Second, it is eminently clear that the testimony concerning the out-of-court doctors\u2019 opinion on the crucial issue in the case was offered solely for the improper hearsay purpose, namely as \u201cindependent proof of the facts.\u201d <em>(Kelley </em>v. <em>Bailey, supra, </em>189 Cal.App.2d at p. 738.) When Mr. Gonick objected to Dr. Newton\u2019s testifying as to the opinion of the other four doctors as hearsay, defense counsel Mr. Craddick quipped: \u201cI don\u2019t have to call every doctor in the area.\u201d The record discloses that the testimony of Doctors Newton and Amstein as to the views of the 54 doctors they respectively consulted was actually offered to establish the opinion of such latter doctors that the 1961 X-ray films showed no abnormality. This testimony was clearly hearsay.</p>\n<p id=\"b895-6\">While we do not deem the possible effect of this testimony either inconsequential or negligible, we have concluded that its admission was not prejudicial. The properly admissible testimony to the effect that the 1961 X-rays <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"896\">*896</page-number>showed no abnormality so completely overshadowed the testimony to the contrary that the additional improper accumulation of the hearsay evidence in our view had no prejudicial effect. After an examination of the entire cause, including the evidence, it does not appear to us to be reasonably probable that a result more favorable to plaintiff in respect to this appeal would have been reached in the absence of the above error. We cannot say that there has been a miscarriage of justice. <em>(People </em>v. <em>Watson </em>(1956) 46 Cal.2d 818, 836 [299 P.2d 243].)</p>\n<p id=\"b896-4\">Finally, plaintiff asserts that the court committed error in making four rulings which errors, she claims, taken individually had a significant impact on her case, and taken in combination had a \u201cdestructive cumulative effect.\u201d<footnotemark>27</footnotemark> We have carefully considered plaintiff\u2019s contentions and are satisfied that they are entirely without merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b896-5\">The judgment of nonsuit is reversed. The judgment entered on the verdict in favor of the remaining defendants is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b896-6\">The prevailing party or parties on each appeal shall recover costs on appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b896-7\">Wright, C.

I don\u2019t mean specifically just with respect to the facts that happen, but she was confused, she was paranoiac, people were bugging her telephone, the Department of Social Welfare had somebody out, cops out watching her\u2014\u201d \u201cNo. I don\u2019t know just what she complained about, but I know she was flashing around, trying to get something done, and I know that when I filed the action that I didn\u2019t myself\u2014couldn\u2019t generate any facts sufficient to make a cause of action against anybody, and I was using it [the complaint] as a means, as my notes indicate, of discovery to see if we couldn\u2019t discover something.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"19\">\n<p id=\"b889-7\">Defendants assert that <em>Hirschman </em>v. <em>Saxon </em>(1966) 246 Cal.App.2d 589 [54 Cal.Rptr. 767] and <em>DeVault </em>v. <em>Logan </em>(1963 ) 223 Cal.App.2d 802 [36 Cal.Rptr. 145] support their claim that Mrs. Chandler was not reasonably diligent in discovering the negligent cause and should guide this court rather than <em>Wozniak. </em>However, both <em>Hirschman </em>and <em>DeVault </em>are inapposite. Neither case involves a minor or the determination of the accrual of a medical malpractice action in the context of the claims statutes. In both cases the plaintiff, despite a suspicion of negligence by doctors involved in their treatment, failed to take any action for a year. In the case at bench, Mrs. Chandler contacted an attorney within a month of becoming suspicious that there might be negligence involved.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"20\">\n<p id=\"b889-8\">In view of our disposition of the case, it is unnecessary to consider plaintiff\u2019s contention that the claims statutes are unconstitutional, both on their face and as applied to minors. However, we note that no arguments or authority have been brought to our attention which would suggest that our decision in <em>Tammen </em>v. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"890\">*890</page-number><em>County of San Diego, supra, </em>66 Cal.2d 468, 481, upholding the constitutionality of the claims statute, is no longer valid.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"21\">\n<p id=\"b891-9\">The record reflects the following: \u201cThe Court: Good morning, ladies and gentlemen of the jury. I, of course, have a pleasant announcement to make on behalf of Mrs. Craddick. She gave birth to a seven pound boy yesterday morning. Mr. Craddick is to be congratulated.</p>\n<p id=\"b891-10\">\u201cMr. Gonick: He is passing out cigars, too, your Honor.</p>\n<p id=\"b891-11\">\u201cThe Court: He has added to the population explosion. One other announcement I would like also to make. There was a bit of confusion in trying to advise the jury that we wouldn\u2019t be in session yesterday, and I shall make an order to the effect that all jurors will receive their compensation as though they were here.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"22\">\n<p id=\"b891-12\">On the following day the full incident was reported in a local newspaper. Sometime that day, Mr. Gonick discovered that the cigars and candy had been given to the jury. He made no objection either then or the next morning at the start of the proceedings. He at no time asked that the jury be admonished. Instead the next day, following an adverse evidentiary ruling, Mr. Gonick moved for a mistrial. He admitted in open court that he had intended to overlook the gift to the jury, largely because Mr. Craddick had indicated he in turn would not object to the admission of certain evidence offered by Gonick and would not require the latter to produce a certain witness. Nevertheless, Mr. Craddick objected to the admission of certain evidence. Mr. Gonick decided to move for a mistrial, stating: \u201cThe thing is this. If they are going to take this attitude I don\u2019t feel so inclined to waive this Jury proposition.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"23\">\n<p id=\"b894-9\">\u201cQ. And will you tell us whether any of the four doctors that you called into your office on that occasion and to whom you presented those films detected any abnormality in any of the films on display?\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b894-10\">Mr. Gonick objected that the answer would be hearsay.</p>\n<p id=\"b894-11\">\u201cMr. Craddick: It\u2019s admissible. I don\u2019t have to call every doctor in the area.</p>\n<p id=\"b894-12\">\u201cThe Court: Objection overruled . . . .\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"24\">\n<p id=\"b894-13\">\u201cQ. As a result of such presentation, was your opinion with respect to the interpretation of those films influenced or strengthened or weakened in any respect?</p>\n<p id=\"b894-14\">\u201cA. I think my opinion was strengthened because nobody else saw anything abnormal in those films either.</p>\n<p id=\"b894-15\">\u201cQ.

Defendant\u2019s witness, Dr. Fillerup, after diagnosing a moderate whiplash syndrome in plaintiff, sent him to Dr. Meyers who made a report to Dr. Fillerup which he used in his own studies of plaintiff\u2019s case; he also consulted with Dr. Meyers and thereby strengthened his own opinion of plaintiff\u2019s condition. Portions of this report were read to the jury .... There was no error in this. Such a report stands on a parity with a patient\u2019s history of an accident and ensuing injuries given to his physician. <em>It is admissible not as independent proof of the facts but as a part of the information upon which the physician based his diagnosis and treatment, if any. </em>[Citations.] Upon request the jurors should be told and doubtless would have been told that that evidence was received and was to be considered for this narrow and limited purpose. . . . Counsel made no such request at bar and the judge had no obligation to instruct <em>sua sponte.\u201d </em>(Italics added.) (Accord, <em>Springer </em>v. <em>Reimers </em>(1970) 4 Cal.
