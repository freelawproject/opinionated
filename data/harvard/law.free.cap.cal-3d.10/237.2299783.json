In the course of the case in defense, petitioner unexpectedly called as a witness the prosecutor Mr. Brian, a deputy district attorney.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> The judge thereupon admon<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"241\">*241</page-number>ished and excused the jury and the following proceedings were had in open court, outside the presence of the jury.</p>\n<p id=\"b269-5\">We shall set forth in some detail the subsequent events so that the alleged contempt can be viewed in its proper setting.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> After the jury was excused, an argument ensued in open court, at the start of which the prosecutor requested that the judge order petitioner to make an offer of what he expected to prove by calling the prosecutor as a witness. The pertinent portions of the record are set forth below.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b269-6\">Asserting that he had the right to call the prosecutor or any other witness, petitioner continued as follows: \u201cI don\u2019t believe the District Attorney stands in any stead or difference from any other witness, and if I want to call him as a witness I have a right to call him as a witness. Objections can be interposed question by question.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b270-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"242\">*242</page-number>\u201cThe Court: I don\u2019t believe so, in view of his status in the case. You have an obligation\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b270-4\">\u201cMr. Buckley: The Court should let me finish my position so that the record is clear.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b270-5\">\u201cThe Court: I thought you had finished. I didn\u2019t know you went on forever.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b270-6\">\u201cMr. Buckley: The Court\u2019s persistent interruptions\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b270-7\">\u201cThe Court: Don\u2019t characterize my conduct as persistent interruptions or I\u2019ll cite you for contempt. Get on with your argument.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b270-8\">\u201cMr. Buckley: I lost my train of thought because of the Court\u2019s interruption.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b270-9\">Petitioner then reiterated his position that he was not required to make an offer of proof and the prosecutor renewed his objection. The following then occurred.</p>\n<p id=\"b270-10\">\u201cMr. Brian: And I renew my objection. There\u2019s been no showing whatever that I have anything to offer in the case, and I\u2019ve learned by sad experience not to talk to Mr. Buckley in person, and I refuse to do it unless there\u2019s a witness present. [H] I have nothing to offer this case. I\u2019m the prosecutor, and I refuse to take the stand. It\u2019s one of his cheap tricks.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b270-11\">\u201cThe Court: I\u2019m not interested in your characterization.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b270-12\">\u201cMr. Brian: I withdraw my characterization.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b270-13\">\u201cMr. Buckley: Would the Court ask the District Attorney to apologize.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b270-14\">\u201cThe Court: Did you apologize for calling him stupid?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b270-15\">\u201cMr. Buckley: Did I call him stupid?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b270-16\">\u201cThe Court: Yes, you did.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b270-17\">After a further exchange, the judge sustained the prosecutor\u2019s objection to being called as a defense witness. Petitioner continued to argue to the court. \u201cMr. Buckley: I don\u2019t call witnesses that won\u2019t offer relevant testimony, and this witness will offer relevant and material testimony.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b270-18\">\u201cThe Court: You\u2019ll have to first tell me what that is.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b270-19\">\u201cMr. Buckley: I think the Court and the prosecution bear a heavy burden.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b271-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"243\">*243</page-number>\u201cThe Court; Stop telling me about my burden. Either comply with the order or sit down.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b271-5\">\u201cMr. Buckley: What is the order?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b271-6\">\u201cThe Court: The order is unless you tell me the relevant information I\u2019m not going to permit you to call him.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b271-7\">\u201cMr. Buckley: Is that going to be so with every witness?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b271-8\">\u201cThe Court: No, that only applies to the District Attorney.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b271-9\">A lengthy exchange between petitioner and the court then ensued, during which petitioner argued that he was entitled to interrogate the prosecutor about oral statements made to him by defendants, since such statements would have been discoverable anyhow had they been reduced to writing. When asked by the court for authority supporting such a position, petitioner continued: \u201cMr. Buckley: I call upon the Court\u2019s experience as a judge that everything isn\u2019t written down in law books, that new questions arise every day that aren\u2019t in the cases.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b271-10\">\u201cThe Court: You don\u2019t have authority for it, is that it? It\u2019s denied.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b271-11\">\u201cMr. Buckley: The District Attorney\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b271-12\">\u201cThe Court: I don\u2019t want to hear the argument. It\u2019s denied.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b271-13\">\u201cMr. Buckley: The District Attorney has none to the contrary. It\u2019s consistent with all other\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b271-14\">\u201cThe Court: I\u2019ve heard enough argument on it.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b271-15\">\u201cMr. Buckley: I\u2019ll cite to the Court <em>In Re Ferguson, </em>5 Cal.3d 525, which talks about the obligation of the District Attorney to turn over to the defense, even without request, all information of a substantial and material nature; says nothing about whether it is written or not. In fact, the Court says there is no need for the defense to make a written notice that will just clog the Court\u2019s file with unnecessary paperwork. H] That\u2019s my case. I rely on that. H] I\u2019ll move the Court for a mistrial.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b271-16\">\u201cThe Court: Denied.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b271-17\">\u201cMr. Buckley: <em>This Court obviously doesn\u2019t want to apply the law.</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b271-18\">\u201cThe Court: Stop insulting me and sit down. Hi] Don\u2019t tell me I don\u2019t want to apply the law. It\u2019s grossly insulting and this time I\u2019m going to cite you for contempt. For grossly contemptuous behavior in impugning to this Court a willful desire not to apply the law. It is highly insulting, highly un<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"244\">*244</page-number>true, and you\u2019re punished with five days in the Orange County jail and a fine of five hundred dollars, the sentence to take effect upon the conclusion of this trial. It will be stayed until the verdict is rendered in this case.\u201d<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> (Italics added.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b272-4\">At the start of the proceedings on the following morning, petitioner in open court and outside the presence of the jury apologized to the court for being late. In the ensuing colloquy between petitioner and the court, during which petitioner remarked that \u201cthis Court has questions about my credibility,\u201d petitioner apologized to the court for \u201cthe comment I made yesterday.\u201d<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> The record discloses, however, that the judge upon further reflection chose to regard the proffered apology as having \u201cpoured salt on the wound.\u201d<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b272-5\">During the afternoon session that day, petitioner in open court and out of the presence of the jury addressed the judge on the subject of his prior apology and the court\u2019s subsequent observation that the apology \u201conly magnified the nature of the contempt.\u201d His inquiry as to why the judge had rejected the apology was met by the judge\u2019s response that he \u201cnever accepted it or rejected it\u201d but had considered that the apology \u201conly magnified the insult, because the accusation was a charge on the integrity of this court. The accusation was, I knew the law, and didn\u2019t obey it. So merely stating I knew the law, merely emphasized the fact that I had no integrity.\u201d<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"245\">*245</page-number>Declining to exonerate petitioner for his allegedly contemptuous remark, the judge made and filed a written order adjudicating petitioner in contempt, which we set forth in relevant part in the margin.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> Petitioner was taken into custody but was later released. This proceeding in habeas corpus followed.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b274-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"246\">*246</page-number>Petitioner directs a three-pronged attack on the order adjudicating him in contempt. His contentions may be summarized as follows: (1) That the order is insufficient on its face to support the jurisdiction of the trial court and is not supported by the record; (2) that under the circumstances of the case, the trial judge was required, as a matter of due process, to refer the charge of the alleged contempt to another judge for adjudication; and (3) that California procedure in contempt matters, insofar as it fails to provide for a stay or an appeal as a matter of right, denies a contemner the equal protection of the laws.</p>\n<p id=\"b274-4\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b274-5\">Preliminarily we make some observations as to the order under review. Fairly read, it indicates that petitioner was found to be in contempt only for a single act of misconduct\u2014his statement in open court that \u201cThis Court obviously doesn\u2019t want to apply the law.\u201d (See fn. 10, <em>ante, </em>and text accompanying fn. 6.)<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> Nowhere does the order state that petitioner made this statement in a loud, boisterous, insolent or rude manner. It does recite, however, that the statement \u201ctended to interrupt the due course of the trial then in progress,\u201d language almost identical with that found in subdivision 1 of section 1209 of the Code of Civil Procedure.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> We additionally observe that there are attached to, and made a part of the order, transcripts of the full portion of the colloquy between petitioner and the court (see fn. 10, <em>ante, </em>1st par.) as well as of petitioner\u2019s apology <em>(id., </em>4th par.).</p>\n<p id=\"b274-6\">These preliminary matters out of the way, we turn to petitioner\u2019s first contention. Essentially his point is this: That the order of contempt rests</p>\n<p id=\"b275-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"247\">*247</page-number>on a single remark of nine words alleged to be contemptuous; that such statement was not found to have been made in a loud, boisterous or offensive manner; that although found to have tended to interrupt the due course of the trial, such finding is totally unsupported by the record; and that, as a result, petitioner\u2019s statement did not constitute contempt.</p>\n<p id=\"b275-5\">In reviewing an adjudication of contempt, \u201cthe sole question before us is one of jurisdiction of the trial court to render the judgment under review, and in such a case the review of the evidence is limited to determining whether there was any substantial evidence to sustain the jurisdiction of the trial court.\u201d <em>(The Times-Mirror Co. </em>v. <em>Superior Court </em>(1940) 15 Cal.2d 99, 115 [98 P.2d 1029], revd. other grounds (1941) 314 U.S. 252 [86 L.Ed. 192, 62 S.Ct. 190, 159 A.L.R. 1346]; <em>Bridges </em>v. <em>Superior Court </em>(1939) 14 Cal.2d 464, 484 [94 P.2d 983], revd. other grounds (1941) 314 U.S. 252 [86 L.Ed. 192, 62 S.Ct. 190, 159 A.L.R. 1346].) More recently we said that \u201cthe responsibility of the reviewing court is merely to ascretain whether there was sufficient evidence before the trial court to sustain the judgment and order. The power to weigh the evidence rests with the trial court.\u201d <em>(In re Ciraolo </em>(1969) 70 Cal.2d 389, 394 [74 Cal.Rptr. 865, 450 P.2d 241], citing <em>Arthur </em>v. <em>Superior Court </em>(1965) 62 Cal.2d 404, 409-410 [42 Cal.Rptr. 441, 398 P.2d 777], and <em>Bridges </em>v. <em>Superior Court, supra, </em>14 Cal.2d at p. 485.)</p>\n<p id=\"b275-6\">The requirements of the order adjudicating contempt have been given expression in numerous opinions. In <em>Arthur </em>v. <em>Superior Court, supra, </em>62 Cal.2d at page 407, we observed: \u201cSection 1211 of the Code of Civil Procedure establishes the procedure that is to be followed in adjudging persons in contempt of court. Contempt committed in the immediate view and presence of the court, known as direct contempt, may be treated summarily. All that is required is that an order be made reciting the facts, adjudging the person guilty and prescribing the punishment.\u201d We have emphasized, however, that such an order is valid only if it recites facts with sufficient particularity to demonstrate on its face that petitioner\u2019s conduct-constituted a legal contempt, <em>(Chula </em>v. <em>Superior Court, supra, </em>57 Cal.2d at p. 203; <em>Raiden </em>v. <em>Superior Court </em>(1949) 34 Cal.2d 83, 86 [206 P.2d 1081]; <em>Gallagher </em>v. <em>Municipal Court </em>(1948) 31 Cal.2d 784, 795 [192 P.2d 905].)</p>\n<p id=\"b275-7\">It is well established that a court has inherent power to punish for contempt of court <em>(In re McKinney </em>(1968) 70 Cal.2d 8, 10-11 [73 Cal. Rptr. 580, 447 P.2d 972] and cases there cited). As this court declared many years ago in a case repeatedly cited with approval, this inherent power \u201cis a necessary incident to the execution of the powers conferred</p>\n<p id=\"b276-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"248\">*248</page-number>upon the court, and is necessary to maintain its dignity, if not its very existence.\u201d <em>(In re Shortridge </em>(1893) 99 Cal. 526, 532 [34 P. 227].)</p>\n<p id=\"b276-4\">Thus it is the settled law of this state that an attorney commits a direct contempt when he impugns the integrity of the court by statements made in open court either , orally or in writing. <em>(In re Ciraolo, supra, </em>70 Cal.2d 389, 394-395 (false accusation in affidavit); <em>Hume </em>v. <em>Superior Court </em>(1941) 17 Cal.2d 506, 513-514 [110 P.2d 669] (false charge of collusion of judge with Attorney General); <em>Blodgett </em>v. <em>Superior Court </em>(1930) 210 Cal. 1,16 [290 P. 293, 72 A.L.R. 482] (false charge of corruption in legal memorandum); <em>Matter of Shay </em>(1911) 160 Cal. 399, 407-408 [117 P. 442] (letter imputing improper conduct to Supreme Court justices); <em>Lamberson </em>v. <em>Superior Court </em>(1907) 151 Cal. 458, 462-464 [91 P. 100] (affidavit to disqualify judge charging corrupt and improper motives); <em>In re Grossman </em>(1972) 24 Cal.App.3d 624, 634-640 [101 Cal.Rptr. 176] (false accusations against judge); <em>Gillen </em>v. <em>Municipal Court </em>(1940) 37 Cal.App.2d 428, 429, 431 [99 P.2d 555] (oral statement that opposing counsel won before he started); <em>Hallinan </em>v. <em>Superior Court </em>(1938) 27 Cal.App.2d 433, 438-439 [81 P.2d 254] (affidavit charging dishonesty of presiding judge); <em>In re Friday </em>(1934) 138 Cal.App. 660, 663 [32 P.2d 1117] (objections to court\u2019s rulings falsely charging trial judge with improper conduct); <em>Ex parte Ewell </em>(1925) 71 Cal.App. 744, 747-748 [236 P. 205] (letter attacking judge); <em>Matter of Application of Lapique </em>(1915) 26 Cal.App. 258 [146 P. 690] (affidavit in support of motion for change of venue imputing lack of integrity in judge). See 4 Witkin, Cal. Procedure (2d ed. 1971), pp. 2973-2974.)<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> Insolence to the judge in the form of insulting words or conduct in court has traditionally been recognized in the common law as constituting grounds for contempt. (Oswald on Contempt (1911) pp. 51-54.)  As we recently said in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"249\">*249</page-number><em>Ciraolo, supra, </em>quoting from <em>Friday, supra, </em>and <em>Lamberson, supra, </em>\u201c 'The judge of a court is well within his rights in protecting his own reputation from groundless attacks upon his judicial integrity and it is his bounden duty to protect the integrity of his court.\u2019 <em>(In re Friday, supra, </em>138 Cal.App. 660, 663; see also <em>Daily </em>v. <em>Superior Court, supra, 4 </em>Cal.App.2d 127, 133 [40 P.2d 936].) \u2018However willing he may be to forego the private injury, the obligation is upon him by his oath to maintain the respect due to the court over which he presides.\u2019 \u201d <em>(In re Ciraolo, supra, </em>at pp. 394-395.)<footnotemark>15</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b277-5\">Nevertheless we have warned that the judge\u2019s ultimate weapon of the summary contempt power \u201cmust be exercised with great caution, lest it stifle the freedom of thought and speech so necessary to a fair trial under our adversary system. That system is built upon the belief that truth will best be served if defense counsel is given the maximum possible leeway to urge in a respectful but nonetheless determined manner, the questions, objections, or argument he deems necessary to the defendant\u2019s case: \u2018He has a right to press a legitimate argument and to protest an erroneous ruling.\u2019 [Citation.] Indeed, so essential is this \u2018fundamental interest of the public in maintaining an independent bar\u2019 . . . that \u2018a mere mistaken act by counsel cannot render him in contempt of court. Even if a legal proposition is untenable, counsel may properly urge it in good faith; he may do so even though he may not expect to be successful, provided of course, that he does not resort to deceit or to wilful obstruction of the orderly processes.\u2019 \u201d <em>(Smith </em>v. <em>Superior Court </em>(1968) 68 Cal.2d 547, 560 [68 Cal.Rptr. 1, 440 P.2d 65], quoting <em>Gallagher </em>v. <em>Municipal Court, supra, </em>31 Cal.2d 784, 788, 795, 796.) When, however, aggressive advocacy gives way to insolence and disrespect towards the court and particularly when it degenerates into \u201cimpertinent, scandalous, insulting or contemptuous language reflecting on the integrity of the court\u201d <em>(Hume </em>v. <em>Superior Court, supra, </em>17 Cal.2d at p. 513) it is the trial judge\u2019s \u201cbounden duty to protect the integrity of his <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"250\">*250</page-number>court.\u201d <em>(In re Friday, supra, </em>138 Cal.App. at p. 663; see <em>Lamberson </em>v. <em>Superior Court, supra, </em>151 Cal. at pp. 461-462.)</p>\n<p id=\"b278-4\">Applying the foregoing authorities to the matter before us, we think it is manifest that petitioner\u2019s statement constituted an attack on the integrity of the court. The offending language\u2014\u201c[t]his Court obviously doesn\u2019t want to apply the law\u201d\u2014fairly read, means, as indeed the trial judge took it to mean, that the judge knew the law but deliberately chose to ignore it. In essence the statement does not constitute a mere accusation of bias, that is, a mere \u201ccondition of mind\u201d <em>(Estate of Friedman </em>(1918) 178 Cal. 27, 39 [172 P. 140]) or merely a \u201c \u2018leaning of the mind; propensity or prepossession toward an object or view, not leaving the mind indifferent\u2019 \u201d <em>(Evans </em>v. <em>Superior Court </em>(1930) 107 Cal.App. 372, 380 [290 P. 662] quoting from Webster\u2019s New Internat. Dict.)</p>\n<p id=\"b278-5\">In our view the statement goes beyond one reflecting a mere mental outlook or predilection and makes a charge of deliberate judicial dishonesty.  We are of the opinion that the record does not support such an accusation against the judge and that the statement was insolent, offensive, insulting, and impunged the integrity of the court. We conclude that the statement was contemptuous on its face.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> Since the contempt order is not based on \u201cwords wholly innocuous\u201d <em>(Gallagher </em>v. <em>Municipal Court, supra, </em>31 Cal.2d at p. 796) or on \u201clanguage of which is in itself not insolent, contemptuous or disorderly\u201d <em>(In re Hallinan, supra, </em>71 Cal.2d at p. 1181) the judge was not required first to warn petitioner before taking disciplinary action against him. <em>(Gallagher, supra, </em>at p. 797; <em>In re Hallinan, supra, </em>at p. 1183.)</p>\n<p id=\"b278-6\">Petitioner contends, however, that reversal of the order before us is compelled by the recent decision of the United States Supreme Court in <em>In re Little </em>(1972) 404 U.S. 553 [30 L.Ed.2d 708, 92 S.Ct. 659]. There the contemner-petitioner, a layman, attempted to act as his own attorney in a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"251\">*251</page-number>state criminal trial, when his retained counsel was unable to appear and the petitioner was unable to obtain a continuance. In his summation (the opinion not indicating whether trial was to the court or to a jury) the petitioner made statements that the court was biased and had prejudged the case, and that the petitioner was a political prisoner. The court adjudged him in contempt after concluding that his conduct and words were contemptuous and \u201c \u2018reflected on the integrity of the Court and tended to subvert and prevent justice.\u2019 \u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 554 [30 L.Ed.2d at p. 710].) Habeas corpus relief was denied by an intermediate appellate state court which upheld the adjudication in a judgment that tracked \u201cthe statutory language in reciting that petitioner\u2019s statements \u2018directly tended to interrupt its proceedings and to impair the respect due the [trial court\u2019s] authority.\u2019 \u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 554 [30 L.Ed.2d at p. 710].)<footnotemark>17</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b279-5\">In what appears to be a narrow holding, the United States Supreme Court in a per curiam opinion reversed the judgment. \u201cWe hold that <em>in the context of this case </em>petitioner\u2019s statements in summation did not constitute criminal contempt. The court\u2019s denial of the continuance forced petitioner to argue his own cause. He was therefore clearly entitled to as much latitude in conducting his defense as we have held is enjoyed by counsel vigorously espousing a client\u2019s cause. <em>In re McConnell </em>(1962) 370 U.S. 230. There is no indication, and the State does not argue, that petitioner\u2019s statements were uttered in a boisterous tone or in any wise actually disrupted the court proceeding. Therefore, \u2018The vehemence of the language used is not alone the measure of the power to punish for contempt. The fires which it kindles must constitute an imminent, not merely a likely, threat to the administration of justice. The danger must not be remote or even probable; it must immediately imperil .... [T]he law of contempt is not made for the protection of judges who may be sensitive to the winds of public opinion. Judges are supposed to be men of fortitude, able to thrive in a hardy climate.\u2019 <em>Craig </em>v. <em>Harney, </em>331 U.S. 367, 376 (1947). \u2018Trial courts . . . must be on guard against confusing offenses to their sensibilities with obstruction to the administration of justice.\u2019 <em>(Brown </em>v. <em>United States, </em>356 U.S. 148, 153 (1958).\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 555 [30 L.Ed.2d at pp. 710-711]; italics added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b280-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"252\">*252</page-number>We have some diffculty in attempting to determine whether the United States Supreme Court\u2019s decision in <em>Little </em>compels, as petitioner contends, a reversal of the contempt order here. Initially, it may be noted, the court chose to limit its holding to \u201cthe context of this case,\u201d emphasizing the special circumstances with which it was faced: the contemner was a layman, inexperienced in the rules of courtroom decorum, who was attempting to defend himself in a criminal trial after his counsel had failed to appear. It is not surprising that such a person would make improper remarks in his final argument without realizing that he was subjecting himself to the extraordinary power of summary contempt. Secondly, although the high court\u2019s opinion gives the gist of the petitioner\u2019s remarks, it does not quote the words actually used, so that we cannot discern their offensive or innocuous character on their face.</p>\n<p id=\"b280-4\">Our reading of <em>Little </em>is further complicated by our inability to detect the specific constitutional infirmity dictating the high court\u2019s result. The court merely concluded that reversal of the conviction was required by its earlier holding in <em>Holt </em>v. <em>Virginia </em>(1965) 381 U.S. 131 [14 L.Ed.2d 290, 85 S.Ct. 1375].<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> In <em>Holt, </em>the defendant attorneys had charged that their summary adjudication of contempt violated the due process clause of the Fourteenth Amendment. The United States Supreme Court agreed, holding that due process requires the states to allow attorneys to file proper motions that are necessary to ensure a fair trial, an essential element of due process.<footnotemark>19</footnotemark> It is important to note, however, that in <em>Holt </em>\u201cthe words used in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"253\">*253</page-number>the motions were <em>plain English, in no way offensive in themselves, and wholly appropriate to charge bias </em>in the community and bias of the presiding judge.\u201d <em>(Holt </em>v. <em>Virginia, supra, </em>381 U.S. at p. 137 [14 L.Ed.2d at p. 294]; italics added.)<footnotemark>20</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b281-5\">We read <em>Holt </em>as merely affirming, upon constitutional grounds of due process, the settled rule that an attorney may not be summarily adjudged in contempt for aggressive but respectful advocacy. This rule and its limitations are eloquently set forth in <em>Sacher </em>v. <em>United States </em>(1952) 343 U.S. 1 [96 L.Ed. 717, 72 S.Ct. 451], in upholding the summary conviction of an attorney for direct contempt committed while representing the defendant in a criminal case.<footnotemark>21</footnotemark> (See also <em>Fisher </em>v. <em>Pace </em>(1949) 336 U.S. 155, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"254\">*254</page-number>163 [93 L.Ed. 569, 574, 69 S.Ct. 425]; <em>United States </em>v. <em>Schiffer </em>(6th Cir. 1965) 351 F.2d 91, 94; <em>Raiden </em>v. <em>Superior Court, supra, </em>34 Cal.2d at p. 86; <em>Gallagher </em>v. <em>Municipal Court, supra, </em>31 Cal.2d at pp. 796-797; 4 Witkin, Cal. Procedure (2d ed. 1971), pp. 2970-2973.) We do not think that <em>Little, </em>the holding of which was carefully limited to the particular facts of that case, was intended to broaden this time-honored rule in order to protect insulting and disrespectful argument that serves no purpose other than to vent an attorney\u2019s anger.<footnotemark>22</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b282-4\">Unlike the attorneys\u2019 affidavit in <em>Holt, </em>petitioner Buckley\u2019s remark was not \u201cplain English, in no way offensive in [itself], and wholly appropriate to charge bias . . . .\u201d <em>(Holt v. Virginia, supra, </em>381 U.S. at p. 137 [14 L.Ed.2d at p. 294].) Rather, the remark \u201cThis court obviously doesn\u2019t <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"255\">*255</page-number>want to apply the law\u201d was contemptuous on its face, had no basis in fact, and was not made in furtherance of any legitimate motion to disqualify the judge. It merely served to emphasize petitioner\u2019s displeasure with the court\u2019s refusal to rule in his favor. \u201cBut if the ruling is adverse, it is not counsel\u2019s right to resist it or to insult the judge\u2014his right is only respectfully to preserve his point for appeal.\u201d <em>(Sacher </em>v. <em>United States, supra, </em>343 U.S. at p. 9 [96 L.Ed. at p. 723].)</p>\n<p id=\"b283-5\">We hold here that when petitioner\u2019s argument turned from advocacy to insult, the trial court was acting properly in holding him in contempt. We are of the opinion that <em>Little </em>does not derogate from the settled California rule set forth by us, <em>supra </em>(see text accompanying fn. 14, <em>ante) </em>that an attorney commits a direct contempt when he impugns the integrity of the court by statements in open court. Indeed, in our view, <em>Little </em>not only rests on a different principle but is also distinguishable on its facts. We have endeavored to evaluate petitioner\u2019s language in the perspective of the trial, mindful of the fact that he is an advocate pressing his claim, according him \u201c[f]ull enjoyment of that right, with due allowance for the heat of controversy\u201d <em>(Sacher </em>v. <em>United States, supra, </em>343 U.S. at p. 9 [96 L.Ed. at p. 723]), and sensitive to the hazard that in vindicating the dignity and authority of the court, the judge\u2019s contempt power must not become \u201can instrument of tyranny.\u201d <em>(Fisher </em>v. <em>Pace, supra, </em>336 U.S. at p. 163 [93 L.Ed. at p. 574]; Douglas, dissenting.) In the light of all these circumstances, we cannot say that petitioner\u2019s conduct was as a matter of law not contemptuous.</p>\n<p id=\"b283-6\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b283-7\">We now turn to petitioner\u2019s argument that the trial judge was required, as a matter of due process, to refer the matter of adjudication of the alleged contempt to another judge. Petitioner relies upon <em>Mayberry </em>v. <em>Pennsylvania </em>(1971) 400 U.S. 455 [27 L.Ed.2d 532, 91 S.Ct. 499], for the proposition that a defendant in criminal contempt proceedings should be given a public trial before a judge other than the one reviled by the contemner.</p>\n<p id=\"b283-8\">In <em>Mayberry, </em>the Supreme Court overturned adjudications of contempt made in a state proceeding. Three defendants, none of them a lawyer, represented themselves in a criminal trial before a jury. At the end of the trial, the judge held them in contempt for numerous remarks made in court and directed at the judge. The Supreme Court vacated the judgment, and remanded the case to be considered by a judge other than the one at whom the remarks were directed.</p>\n<p id=\"b284-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"256\">*256</page-number>The court in <em>Mayberry </em>focused on two factors that compelled reversal. First, it pointed out that the judge had waited until the end of trial to adjudge the defendants in contempt.<footnotemark>23</footnotemark> Second, and most important, the court did not prohibit judges from sitting in judgment on contemptuous behavior that occurs before them; rather, it held that due process requires a new and impartial judge only where there is evidence that the trial judge \u201chas become so \u2018personally embroiled\u2019 with a lawyer in the trial as to make the judge unfit to sit in judgment on the contempt charge.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 465 [27 L.Ed.2d at p. 540].)<footnotemark>24</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b284-4\">In the case at bench, unlike <em>Mayberry, </em>the trial court did not wait to adjudge petitioner in contempt, but immediately cited him and soon thereafter signed the order of commitment.  More importantly, from our review of the instant record, we cannot say that the judge was so personally embroiled with petitioner that he was unfit to sit in judgment on the contempt charge. The attack here did not consist of \u201cfighting words\u201d which the court found in <em>Mayberry </em>carried such a potential for bias as to require disqualification. Petitioner\u2019s conduct, even though disrespectful, did not rise to the level of personal vilification which by itself would give evidence of the trial court\u2019s probable personal embroilment.<footnotemark>25</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b284-5\">Nor do statements made by the judge indicate that he was unfit to sit in judgment. (Contrast <em>Offutt v. United States </em>(1954) 348 U.S. 11, 16-17 [99 L.Ed. 11, 17-18, 75 S.Ct. 11].) For example, the judge\u2019s remark, cited by petitioner, that \u201cI didn\u2019t know you went on forever,\u201d made after an inter<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"257\">*257</page-number>ruption of petitioner\u2019s argument, may demonstrate impatience but certainly not personal embroilment. Similarly, the judge\u2019s remarks that \u201cI cannot attribute [the delay on petitioner\u2019s part] to anything except the cunning, shrewd and deliberate attempt to thwart me,\u201d appear to represent an accurate picture of petitioner\u2019s conduct, rather than an example of bias.</p>\n<p id=\"b285-5\">More difficult, however, is the disposition of petitioner\u2019s assertion that the judge demonstrated his personal involvement by totally misconstruing petitioner\u2019s attempt to apologize. As previously noted, the day after petitioner was cited for contempt, he apologized to the judge for the remarks in question. (See. fn. 7, <em>ante.) </em>The judge, upon reflection, construed this apology as a further affront to his integrity, since it implied that he knew the law and wilfully disobeyed it. (See fn. 8, <em>ante.)</em></p>\n<p id=\"b285-6\">We have held that in instances of direct contempt an apology to the judge should be given serious consideration. <em>(People </em>v. <em>Turner </em>(1850) 1 Cal. 152, 153.)<footnotemark>26</footnotemark> The effect to be given to such a mitigating factor lies exclusively in the sound discretion of the trial judge. <em>(Lyons </em>v. <em>Superior Court, supra, </em>43 Cal.2d at p. 763; <em>City of Vernon </em>v. <em>Superior Court </em>(1952) 38 Cal.2d 509, 520 [241 P.2d 243]; <em>In re Friday, supra, </em>138 Cal.App. at p. 664.)</p>\n<p id=\"b285-7\">While the trial judge appears to have seriously considered petitioner\u2019s apology, it is arguable that he misinterpreted it.<footnotemark>27</footnotemark> Even if he did, we think that this is insufficient to establish that the judge was personally embroiled with petitioner. A useful comparison may be made with <em>Offutt </em>v. <em>United States, supra, </em>348 U.S. 11, in which the Supreme Court reversed a contempt adjudication made by a federal judge. Among other things, the judge made the following statements in discharging the jury at the end of the case: \u201c T also realize that you had a difficult and a disagreeable task</p>\n<p id=\"b286-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"258\">*258</page-number>in this case. You have been compelled to sit through a disgraceful and disreputable performance on the part of a lawyer who is unworthy of being a member of the profession; and I, as a member of the legal profession, blush that we should have such a specimen in our midst.\u2019 \u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 17, fn. 3 [99 L.Ed. at p. 17].) The Supreme Court concluded: \u201cThe record discloses not a rare flare-up, not a show of evanescent irritation\u2014a modicum of quick temper that must be allowed even judges. The record is persuasive that instead of representing the impersonal authority of law, the trial judge permitted himself to become personally embroiled with the petitioner. There was an intermittently continuous wrangle on an unedifying level between the two. For one reason or another the judge failed to impose his moral authority upon the proceedings. His behavior precluded that atmosphere of austerity which should especially dominate a criminal trial and which is indispensable for an appropriate sense of responsibility on the part of court, counsel and jury.\u201d <em>(Id.)</em></p>\n<p id=\"b286-4\">The record in this case fails to disclose any such vitriolic attack as that which the court directed against the attorney in <em>Offutt. </em> Nor is there any evidence that the judge abrogated his duty to impose his moral authority upon the proceedings. To the contrary, the record discloses considerable patience and control on the part of a judge faced with repeated impertinences of counsel. We conclude from the record before us that the trial judge was not required, as a matter of due process, to refer the matter of adjudication of the alleged contempt to another judge. (Cf. <em>Ungar </em>v. <em>Sarafite </em>(1964) 376 U.S. 575, 588 [11 L.Ed.2d 921, 930, 84 S.Ct. 841].)</p>\n<p id=\"b286-5\">III</p>\n<p id=\"b286-6\">Finally, petitioner contends that he has been denied the equal protection of the laws because California statutes do not provide for an appeal from, or for a stay of, an order adjudicating a person in contempt of court. The point of his argument is this: He assumes that \u201c[t]he conviction ... at issue ... is a misdemeanor\u201d (citing Pen. Code, \u00a7 166, subd. 1), but asserts that the court below \u201cnecessarily proceeded under the provisions of C.C.P. \u00a7 1209.\u201d  Asserting that the right of appeal, if provided by the state, \u201cmust be fairly and equally available to all,\u201d petitioner argues that equal protection is denied him, since \u201c[e]very convicted misdemeanant, except one convicted of contempt\u201d obtains review by appeal. The contention is devoid of merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b286-8\">Petitioner was not convicted of violating Penal Code section 166 or any other section of the Penal Code. He was adjudged in direct contempt of court and his summary adjudication of contempt was proper under Code <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"259\">*259</page-number>of Civil Procedure section 1211.<footnotemark>28</footnotemark>\n                   Although an order made in a contempt proceeding is not appealable (\u00a7 1222; <em>John Breuner Co. </em>v. <em>Bryant, supra, </em>36 Cal.2d at p. 878; <em>In re Circosta, supra, </em>219 Cal.App.2d at p. 785), it may be reviewed by certiorari or, where appropriate, by habeas corpus <em>(John Breuner Co., supra; Circosta, supra), </em> We have already outlined earlier in this opinion our scope of review and emphasized our responsibility to examine the record to the end of determining whether there is substantial evidence to support the judgment. These procedures afford petitioner the safeguard of a review of the proceedings below; he is not discriminated against merely because a conviction of criminal contempt under Penal Code section 166 may be reviewed by the usual appellate process. . '</p>\n<p id=\"b287-6\">The order to show cause is discharged and the petition for the writ is denied.</p>\n<p id=\"b287-7\">Wright, C.

An examination of <em>Craig </em>and <em>Brown </em>supports this conclusion. In <em>Craig, </em>the Supreme Court reversed an adjudication of constructive contempt against several newspapermen for articles attacking a judicial ruling. The decision is based upon the traditionally zealous protection of freedom of the press under the First Amendment. Unlike a newspaper, a courtroom is not a proper forum for free-wheeling exchange of ideas. An attorney\u2019s freedom of speech in this setting must be tempered to insure that courts of law accomplish that for which they were created\u2014dispensing justice in a reasonable, efficient and fair manner. In short, we fail to see how the rule of <em>Craig </em>applies to a case involving direct contempt by an attorney.</p>\n<p id=\"b282-8\">Nor does the test employed in <em>Brown </em>apply to this case. <em>Brown </em>dealt with the power of a <em>federal </em>court to punish for direct contempt. The federal contempt power is defined by a federal statute passed in 1831 which has long been held to limit the power of federal courts to summarily punish for contemptuous conduct. This statute, 18 United States Code, section 401, states in relevant part: \u201cA court of the United States shall have power to punish by fine or imprisonment, at its discretion, such contempt of its authority, and none other, as\u2014[11] (1) Misbehavior of any person in its presence or so near thereto as to <em>obstruct the administration of justice.\u201d </em>(Italics added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b282-9\"><em>Brown </em>merely restates the federal statutory rule, which \u201cdoes not, however, reflect the constitutional limits of the states\u2019 contempt powers.\u201d <em>(Weiss </em>v. <em>Burr </em>(9th Cir. 1973) 484 F.2d 973, 982, fn. 13.)</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"23\">\n<p id=\"b284-6\">\u201cWhere, however, he does not act the instant the contempt is committed, but waits until the end of the trial, on balance, it is generally wise where the marks of the unseemly conduct have left personal stings to ask a fellow judge to take his place.\u201d <em>(Mayberry </em>v. <em>Pennsylvania, supra, </em>400 U.S. at pp. 463-464 [27 L.Ed.2d at p. 539].)</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"24\">\n<p id=\"b284-7\">\u201cIt is, of course, not every attack on a judge that disqualifies him from sitting.

Undoubtedly his patience was worn thin by what he believed, perhaps correctly, were the exasperating and dilatory tactics of petitioner attorney. As any judge with trial court experience realizes, there inevitably arises that one case in a thousand when the tensions of the argument and the over-zealousness of counsel cause righteous anger to overcome normal tolerance and serenity.</p>\n<p id=\"b287-9\">If at that moment of humanly understandable rage the judge lashes out in response, the resultant contempt citation not infrequently fails to survive appellate review. That is the circumstance in the instant case. Analyzing the colloquy involved here, I would characterize it precisely as Justice Oliver Wendell Holmes, in his dissent, reacted to the newspaper articles involved in <em>Toledo Newspaper Co. </em>V. <em>United States </em>(1918) 247 U.S. 402 [62 L.Ed. 1186, 38 S.Ct. 560]; \u201cI confess that I cannot find in all this or in the evidence in the case anything that would have affected a mind of reasonable fortitude, and still less can I find there anything that obstructed <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"260\">*260</page-number>the administration of justice in any sense that I possibly can give to those words.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b288-4\">In the span of nearly a quarter of a century between 1948 and 1972 there have been innumerable cases involving contempt citations, most of them factually distinguishable, some affirming trial court rulings, some reversing. Of all the cases which can be cited, however, I find the most relevant and persuasive to have been decided in those two years.</p>\n<p id=\"b288-5\">Justice Traynor wrote the decision for this court in <em>Gallagher </em>v. <em>Municipal Court </em>(1948) 31 Cal.2d 784 [192 P.2d 905]. In that case three jurors complained to the trial judge that a Mrs. Hill approached them in the corridor of the courthouse during the course of a trial. The judge undertook to examine into this alleged interference with jurors and placed one after another on the stand in order to obtain the facts. Attorney Leo Gallagher appeared and indicated he represented Mrs. Hill. When his attempt to cross-examine the jurors was refused because the court indicated he had no \u201cplace in here\u201d during a mere investigation, Gallagher demanded: \u201cYou want a fair investigation, don\u2019t you?\u201d He repeated a second time: \u201cBut you want a fair investigation?\u201d A third time he said: \u201cI know that, but you want a fair investigation?\u201d He reiterated once more: \u201cDon\u2019t you want a fair investigation of this?\u201d And finally, he undertook to interrogate the court, asking whether his client was under arrest and demanding: \u201cWill you kindly answer that question, Judge, whether she is under arrest at this time? Won\u2019t you hear my argument?\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b288-6\">The trial court found that the statements had been made in a \u201cloud, insolent, aggressive, belligerent, boisterous, harsh, offensive and contemptuous tone of voice and with a sneering and contemptuous expression on his face and a threatening demeanor toward said court and the judge thereof and in disobedience of the lawful orders of the court, and in a disorderly and insolent manner toward the judge of said court.\u201d The court further found that the conduct \u201cdid interrupt the due course of said trial and did obstruct the administration of justice and interfere with the orderly proceedings of the court.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b288-7\">Despite the foregoing fulsome finding, much more pejorative in description than that in the instant order, this court found that there was \u201cnothing contemptuous in petitioner\u2019s words and nothing in the record to show that his conduct tended to interrupt the due course of the examination,\u201d and that petitioner was merely an attorney who had been \u201cregularly and faithfully representing the interests of his client.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b289-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"261\">*261</page-number>In his opinion in <em>Gallagher </em>Justice Traynor pointed out: \u201cAnother consideration is the fundamental interest of the public in maintaining an independent bar. Attorneys must be given a substantial freedom of expression in representing their clients. \u2018An advocate is at liberty, when addressing the Court in regular course, to combat and contest strongly any adverse views of the Judge or Judges expressed on the case during its argument, to object to and protest against any course which the Judge may take and which the advocate thinks irregular or detrimental to the interests of his client, and to caution juries against any interference by the Judge with their functions, or with the advocate when addressing them, or against any strong view adverse to his client expressed by the presiding Judge upon the facts of a case before the verdict of the jury thereon. An advocate ought to be allowed freedom and latitude both in speech and in the conduct of his client\u2019s case.\u2019 (Oswald, Contempt of Court (3d ed.), pp. 56-57. See, <em>People </em>v. <em>Rongetti, </em>344 111. 107, 122 [176 N.E. 292].) The public interest in an independent bar would be subverted if judges were allowed to punish attorneys summarily for contempt on purely subjective reactions to their conduct \"or statements.</p>\n<p id=\"b289-5\">\u201cAn attorney has the duty to protect the interests of his client. He has a right to press legitimate argument and to protest an erroneous ruling. . . . The heat of courtroom debate, particularly where liberty is concerned, often gives rise to persistence on the part of counsel.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at pp. 795-796, 797.) To the same effect is <em>Raiden </em>v. <em>Superior Court </em>(1949) 34 Cal.2d 83 [206 P.2d 1081], in which a contempt citation was annulled where the attorney asserted the trial judge\u2019s order \u201cdefeated the ends of justice.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b289-6\">Gallagher\u2019s persistent inquiries about a fair investigation undeniably implied that the court was conducting an unfair investigation; yet he was exonerated. His comment was remarkably comparable to petitioner\u2019s statement in the instant case that \u201cThis court obviously doesn\u2019t want to apply the law,\u201d a similar implication that the court was conducting an unfair trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b289-7\">In 1972 the United States Supreme Court decided <em>In re Little, </em>404 U.S. 553 [30 L.Ed.2d 708, 92 S.Ct. 659]. While the precise words are not given in the text of the opinion, the Supreme Court found \u201cPetitioner made statements that the court was biased and had prejudged the case.\u201d The trial court\u2019s order recited that the court felt \u201c \u2018[T]hese remarks were very disrespectful and tended to subvert and prevent justice . . . that they reflected on the integrity of the Court and tended to subvert and prevent justice.\u2019 \u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 554 [30 L.Ed.2d at p. 710].)</p>\n<p id=\"b290-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"262\">*262</page-number>The high court found that the petitioner, acting in pro. per. as his own counsel, was entitled to latitude in conducting his defense and in vigorously espousing his cause. The court cited <em>Craig </em>v. <em>Harney </em>(1947) 331 U.S. 367, 376 [91 L.Ed. 1546, 1552, 67 S.Ct. 1249], that the \u201claw of contempt is not made for the protection of judges who may be sensitive .... Judges are supposed to be men of fortitude, able to thrive in a hardy climate.\u201d The court also recalled the words of caution in <em>Brown </em>v. <em>United States </em>(1958) 356 U.S. 148, 153 [2 L.Ed.2d 589, 596, 78 S.Ct. 622, 72 A.L.R.2d 818], that trial courts \u201cmust be on guard against confusing offenses to their sensibilities with obstruction to the administration of justice.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b290-4\">The allegations of Little that his trial court was biased and had prejudged the case are far more damning of the judge and the judicial process than the remark of this petitioner that the court did not want to apply the law.</p>\n<p id=\"b290-5\">The majority make the heroic declaration that petitioner\u2019s statement about the court not wanting to apply the law \u201cwas contemptuous on its face\u201d <em>(ante, </em>pp. 250 and 254-255). I must respectfully disagree. There are, on occasions, perfectly valid reasons for a court to decline \u201cto apply the law.\u201d The judge may believe \u201cthe law\u201d has in effect been overruled, that it is anachronistic and no longer relevant or enforceable, that it violates contemporary constitutional principles, that it is oppressive or discriminatory in application. I do not suggest this petitioner had such reservations in mind. Nevertheless I do not believe we can, <em>ipse dixit, </em>declare petitioner\u2019s bare words to be opprobrious, demeaning or contemptuous per se. In short, there are many tolerable interpretations of those precise words.</p>\n<p id=\"b290-6\">Since the words are not actionable per se, the fundamental question here is whether the petitioner was, by virtue of that utterance and in the context in which it was said, guilty of disrupting or obstructing the judicial process. I do not believe he was.</p>\n<p id=\"b290-7\">First, the colloquy occurred outside the presence of the jury. Thus it could have no influence upon the trier of fact, and did not affect the course of justice in the fact-finding process.</p>\n<p id=\"b290-8\">Second, the demand of petitioner to pursue discovery through the person of the prosecutor, though perhaps overly dramatic, was not wholly untenable in the light of this court\u2019s decision in <em>In re Ferguson </em>(1971) 5 Cal.3d 525 [96 Cal.Rptr. 594, 487 P.2d 1234]. He was entitled to argue the point earnestly.</p>\n<p id=\"b290-9\">Third, nothing in the record before us reflects any unusual tone of voice, or boisterous or menacing conduct by the petitioner. In this respect the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"263\">*263</page-number>order of the trial court is less supportable than that which we reversed in <em>Gallagher.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b291-5\">Fourth, while the trial court stated in the contempt order that the statement \u201ctended to interrupt the due course of the trial then in progress\u201d the court fails to describe how a mere one-sentence <em>statement, </em>in the context of a discussion, albeit heated, over a point of law, and as distinguished from <em>conduct, </em>could in fact interrupt the proceedings. The entire episode was concluded in a matter of seconds, and it did not in actuality interrupt, disturb, delay, or in any manner affect the trial or its result.</p>\n<p id=\"b291-6\">Finally, I find it impossible to interpret petitioner\u2019s apology, rendered after overnight contemplation, as confirming or aggravating the purported contempt. I fail to discern anything in the words of counsel other than a modest effort to express contrition for having offended the- court. For the trial judge to perceive in the attempted apology an exacerbation of the original offense suggests, as of that time, an Unfortunate departure from judicial objectivity.</p>\n<p id=\"b291-7\">The apology issue was referred to in the most celebrated contempt case in California history, involving Stephen J. Field, found in the very first volume of California Reports <em>(People </em>v. <em>Turner </em>(1850) 1 Cal 152). Justice Bennett, one of the original three justices of the Supreme Court, wrote (at p. 153): \u201cThe power thus vested in a court is necessarily of an arbitrary nature, and should be used with great prudence and caution. A judge should bear in mind that he is engaged, not so much in vindicating his own character, as in promoting the respect due to the administration of the laws; and this consideration should induce him to receive as satisfactory any reasonable apology for an offender\u2019s conduct.\u201d (See Mosk, <em>Direct Contempt </em>(1956) 31 State Bar J. 510, 523.)</p>\n<p id=\"b291-8\">There is no doubt that a trial court must deal with both obstruction and disruption of a trial by therapeutic use of the contempt power. Where nothing more than disrespect or discourtesy is involved, however, the dangers of abuse of the contempt power generally outweigh the benefits of using that weapon. The readiness of some judges to find contempt in conduct susceptible of various interpretations, and the capacity of others to provoke an unseemly response by their own imperious behavior on the bench, suggest the dangers of abuse. It must be emphasized that mere personal insult or irritating conduct should not be confused with legally contemptuous behavior. The nature of the trial as constructive human effort to reach a just result must be preserved and enhanced, and no person, whatever his role, should create by his conduct an atmosphere that makes <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"264\">*264</page-number>this impossible. But personal discourtesy, even insult, is on a relatively trivial plane in the whole scheme of things, and a certain amount should be tolerated when it falls short of actually interfering with the proceedings of the trial. (Note, <em>Contempt of Court </em>(1971) 56 Cornell L.Rev. 183, 208.)</p>\n<p id=\"b292-4\">Some opinions speak of contempt in terms of lessening the dignity of the court. (See, e.g., <em>People </em>v. <em>Gholson </em>(1952) 412 HI. 294 [106 N.E.2d 333, 335].) On that subject Professor Max Radin said: \u201cJudicial dignity is an important element of our system and serves a real legal function.\u201d But, he added, \u201cIt is, however, not a legal duty to be well mannered and it may even be said that it would be unconstitutional to make it one. . . . [T]here is no reason why the dignity of the court should take such dimensions or assume such a character that it demands awe or veneration.\u201d (Radin, <em>Freedom of Speech and Contempt of Court </em>(1942) 36 Ill.L.Rev. 599, 610.)</p>\n<p id=\"b292-5\">I would issue the writ.</p>\n<p id=\"b292-6\">Tobriner, J., concurred.</p>\n<p id=\"b292-7\">Petitioner\u2019s application for a rehearing was denied November 28, 1973. Tobriner, J., and Mosk, J., were of the opinion that the application should be granted.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
