Although we have held this day in <em>Green </em>v. <em>Superior Court, ante, </em>p. 616 [111 Cal.Rptr. 704, 517 P.2d 1168], that a warranty of habitability is implied by law in residential leases in California, and that a landlord\u2019s breach of such a warranty is available as a defense in an unlawful detainer action, the record in the instant case does not support petitioner\u2019s claim that the municipal court erred in its treatment <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"643\">*643</page-number>of these issues. Accordingly, we have determined that the requested writ must be denied.</p>\n<p id=\"b643-5\">On September 25, 1972, petitioner\u2019s landlord, Jeff McGaskey, commenced an unlawful detainer action in the San Francisco Municipal Court based upon petitioner\u2019s failure to pay $160 rent for the month of September. In her answer, the tenant admitted that she had refused to pay rent for that month, but she defended her refusal on the ground that the landlord had failed to maintain the premises in a habitable state. In support of this contention, petitioner attached to her answer copies of official city inspection reports detailing some 40 separate violations of the city\u2019s housing code, as well as a certified copy of a \u201cNotice of Condemnation\u201d declaring the premises in question \u201cunsafe\u201d and a \u201cpublic nuisance.\u201d Both the inspection reports and the condemnation notice were rather dated, however, the former being from May 1971, and the latter from November 1971.</p>\n<p id=\"b643-6\">At trial, defendant landlord objected to the admission of any evidence relating to the alleged uninhabitability of the premises, but the trial court, apparently relying upon the Court of Appeal opinion in <em>Hinson </em>v. <em>Delis </em>(1972) 26 Cal.App.3d 62 [102 Cal.Rptr. 661], overruled these objections and permitted the tenant to present evidence on the uninhabitability issue. Thereafter, the landlord apparently controverted at least some of the tenant\u2019s testimony. At the conclusion of the presentation of this evidence, the trial court ruled in favor of, the landlord in his claim for possession of the premises.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b643-7\">Petitioner now claims that the trial court\u2019s determination necessarily rests upon an erroneous legal conclusion that a breach of warranty of habitability is not a defense in an unlawful detainer action. In response, however, the landlord points out that the trial court\u2019s ruling could equally reflect the court\u2019s determination that, as a factual matter, the tenant had failed to demonstrate a breach of warranty. Under established principles, of course, a lower court judgment is presumed correct, and when a lower court has made no specific findings of fact, it is presumed that the court made such implied findings as will support the judgment. (See, e.g., <em>Walling </em>v. <em>Kimball </em>(1941) 17 Cal.2d 364, 373 [110 P.2d 58]; cf. <em>Minton </em>v. <em>Cavaney </em>(1961) 56 Cal.2d 576, 579, fn. 1 [15 Cal.Rptr. 641, 364 P.2d 473]. See generally 6 Witkin, Cal. Procedure (2d ed. 1971) Appeal, \u00a7 235, pp. 4225-4226.)</p>\n<p id=\"b644-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"644\">*644</page-number>In the instant case the trial court made no explicit findings of fact,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> and thus, as the landlord suggests, on the present state of the record we must presume that the court\u2019s decision rests on a factual determination that no breach of warranty occurred, rather than on an erroneous legal determination that the breach of a warranty of habitability could not be raised in an unlawful detainer action. Moreover, such a presumption is not at all unreasonable in this case, for the trial court did permit the tenant to introduce evidence on the breach of warranty issue, despite the landlord\u2019s objection.</p>\n<p id=\"b644-4\">Thus, the present record does not demonstrate any grounds for disturbing the judgment of the municipal court. Accordingly, the requested - writ must be denied.</p>\n<p id=\"b644-5\">The alternative writ of prohibition is discharged and the petition for a peremptory writ is denied.</p>\n<p id=\"b644-6\">Wright, C. J., McComb, J., Mosk, J., Burke, J., Sullivan, J., and Clark, J., concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b643-8\">The landlord\u2019s complaint had requested both possession and money damages for back rent. At the conclusion of the trial, however, the landlord waived any claim for back rent.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b644-7\">The tenant made a timely request that the municipal court issue written findings of fact and conclusions of law, but the court declined, holding that such written findings were not required under section 632 of the Code of Civil Procedure, which provides that \u201c[i]n municipal courts . . . the court shall not be required to make any written findings and conclusions in any case in which the amount of the demand . . ., or the value of the property in controversy, does not exceed one thousand dollars ($1,000).\u201d The tenant contends that although only $160 rent was at issue, findings were required because \u201cthe value of the property in controversy\u201d\u2014assertedly the value of the apartment itself\u2014exceeded $1,000. The tenant, however, has no claim of ownership of the apartment in question; the \u201cproperty in controversy\u201d in this case is at most the unexpired term of the tenant\u2019s lease. Since the tenant enjoyed only a month-to-month tenancy, it is clear that the value of such \u201cproperty\u201d does not exceed $1,000. Thus, the court\u2019s refusal to make written findings is supported by section 632.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
