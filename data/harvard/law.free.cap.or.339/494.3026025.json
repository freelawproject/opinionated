Petitioners are electors who timely submitted written comments to the Secretary of State concerning the content of the Attorney General\u2019s draft ballot title and who therefore are entitled to seek review of the resulting certified ballot title in this court. <em>See </em>ORS 250.085(2) (stating that requirement). We review the Attorney General\u2019s certified ballot title to determine whether it substantially complies with the requirements of ORS 250.035(2)(a) to (d). ORS 250.085(5). For the reasons that follow, we conclude that it does not. Accordingly, we refer the ballot title to the Attorney General for modification.</p>\n<p id=\"b540-5\">The proposed measure is set out in its entirety in the Appendix. For purposes of introduction, the following summary suffices. The proposed measure begins as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b540-6\">\u201cBe it Enacted by the People of the State of Oregon:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b540-7\">\u201c1[.] This Act shall be known as The Peoples\u2019 Court Act[.]</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b540-8\">\u201c2 [.] The seven judges of the Supreme Court of Oregon shall be elected from districts within the state. Six judges shall be elected from each of six geographic districts,[<footnotemark>1</footnotemark>] and one judge shall be elected in a statewide district. The judge elected statewide shall be the Chief Justice of the Supreme Court.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b540-9\">The proposed measure goes on in eight additional numbered paragraphs to provide, <em>inter alia, </em>how the six geographic districts will be formed (viz., by combining certain Oregon Senate districts), how the judges will be elected from those <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"497\">*497</page-number>districts, and how incumbent members of the court fit into the proposed system. The proposed measure also provides that the Chief Justice will be elected in the state at large and will have administrative authority over the state Judicial Department.</p>\n<p id=\"b541-4\">We do not think it useful to set out the Attorney General\u2019s certified ballot title in its entirety. Instead, we limit our recitation of the ballot title to those parts that are at issue. The Attorney General\u2019s caption for the Initiative Petition 41 states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b541-5\">\u201cAMENDS CONSTITUTION: REQUIRES ELECTION OF SIX OREGON SUPREME COURT JUDGES BY GEOGRAPHIC DISTRICTS; CHIEF JUSTICE ELECTED STATEWIDE\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b541-7\">The Attorney General\u2019s summary for the proposed measure also begins with the phrase \u201cAmends Constitution.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b541-8\">Both petitioners challenge the caption and the summary in the Attorney General\u2019s certified ballot title on the same ground. They assert that the Attorney General\u2019s caption and summary should not begin with the words, \u201cAmends Constitution,\u201d because the proposed measure is, in fact, a proposed statute and not a proposed constitutional amendment.</p>\n<p id=\"b541-9\">Ordinarily, a caption for the ballot title for a proposed initiative measure consists of \u201cnot more than 15 words that reasonably identifly] the subject matter of the state measure.\u201d ORS 250.035(2)(a). However, when the proposed initiative measure would amend the constitution,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b541-10\">\u201c[t]he caption of an initiative or referendum amendment to the constitution <em>shall </em>begin with the phrase, \u2018Amends Constitution,\u2019 which shall not be counted for purposes of the 15-word limitation.\u201d<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b542-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"498\">*498</page-number><em>Id. </em>(emphasis added). Thus, as a part of his statutory obligation to prepare ballot titles, the Attorney General is required to determine in each case involving a proposed initiative measure whether that measure would amend the state constitution and, if it would, to include the phrase \u201cAmends Constitution\u201d in the caption. The question in this case is whether the Attorney General properly chose to label the proposed initiative measure as such a constitutional amendment.</p>\n<p id=\"b542-4\">We have little difficulty in concluding that the Attorney General erred. We begin with the text of Initiative Petition 41 itself. We note that nothing in that proposed measure states, suggests, or even fairly may be said to imply that the measure is intended to be a constitutional amendment, either by changing existing wording in the Oregon Constitution or by adding new wording or provisions to it.</p>\n<p id=\"b542-6\">In contrast to what the proposed initiative measure does not say, what it does say is telling. As noted, the proposed measure twice characterizes itself in its first paragraph as an \u201cAct\u201d: \u201cThis <em>Act </em>shall be known as The Peoples\u2019 Court Aei[.]\u201d (Emphasis added.) Similarly, the fourth paragraph of the proposed initiative measure states that \u201c[t]his <em>Act </em>shall not have the effect of shortening the term of any incumbent judge,\u201d the ninth paragraph offers the assurance that \u201c[t]his <em>Act </em>is intended to bring the Supreme Court of Oregon closer to the people,\u201d and the tenth paragraph provides that \u201c[t]his <em>Act </em>takes effect upon Passage [and] * * * [c] ertain parts of the <em>Act </em>are operative on delayed dates as specified in the <em>Act.\u201d </em>(Emphasis added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b542-7\">The proposed measure\u2019s repeated self-characterization is important, because the term \u201cact\u201d has a special and well-recognized meaning in the area of lawmaking: An \u201cact\u201d ordinarily is a legislatively passed statute. <em>Webster\u2019s Third New Int\u2019l Dictionary </em>20 (unabridged ed 2002) defines an \u201cact\u201d as</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b542-8\">\u201cthe formal product of a legislative body: the formally declared will of a legislature the final requirement of which is usufally] the signature of the proper executive officer: STATUTE &lt;an ~ of Congress&gt; * *</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b543-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"499\">*499</page-number>Thus, taking the proposed initiative measure at its word, the most reasonable reading of it is that it is intended to be a statute, not a constitutional amendment.</p>\n<p id=\"b543-4\">In addition to the foregoing, context within chapter 250 of the Oregon Revised Statutes confirms that the legislature recognizes that the meaning of \u201cact\u201d on which we rely is apt in cases involving proposed initiative measures. ORS 250.005(3), one of the provisions in chapter 250 setting out definitions, provides that, for purposes of an initiative, the term \u201cmeasure\u201d includes:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b543-5\">\u201c(a) A proposed law.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b543-6\">\u201c(b) An Act or part of an Act of the legislative assembly.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b543-7\">\u201c(c) A revision of or amendment to the Oregon Constitution.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b543-9\">That is, \u201cActs\u201d are different than constitutional amendments.</p>\n<p id=\"b543-10\">In response, the Attorney General relies on the Secretary of State\u2019s form (a form denominated \u201cSEL 310\u201d) that the sponsors of Initiative Petition 41 filed with the Secretary of State respecting the proposed measure. That form offered the sponsors two boxes, one labeled \u201cstatutory\u2019 and the other labeled \u201cconstitutional.\u201d The sponsors checked the box labeled \u201cconstitutional.\u201d Such a choice, the Attorney General asserts, designates the measure as a \u201cconstitutional amendment,\u201d and \u201cthe Attorney General must adhere to that designation.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b543-11\">We cannot accept that explanation, which would make the Attorney General the prisoner of a choice \u2014 perhaps informed, perhaps not, perhaps even intentionally duplicitous \u2014 by a measure\u2019s sponsor to check one or another box on a form. As our earlier recitation of the pertinent statutory tasks assigned to the Attorney General shows, that officer is charged by legislation with drafting a ballot title that properly labels a proposed initiative measure. No piece of paper, indeed no rule, created by the Secretary of State can relieve or excuse the Attorney General from that statutory obligation.</p>\n<p id=\"b544-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"500\">*500</page-number>The Attorney General, relying on various older opinions of this court,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> argues that he is not permitted, in the ballot title process, to \u201cinterpret\u201d the \u201cpractical effect\u201d of a proposed initiative measure. That argument is not well taken. The statutory framework in which the Attorney General performs the ballot title preparation function may deny the Attorney General the right to speculate as to a proposed initiative measure\u2019s meaning, where two or more reasonable interpretations are possible. But the statutory standards in ORS 250.035(2)(a) (requiring Attorney General to prepare caption \u201cthat reasonably identifies the subject matter\u201d of the proposed measure); (2)(6) (requiring a \u201csimple and understandable statement ** * * that describes the result if the state measure is approved\u201d); (2)(c) (requiring a \u201csimple and understandable statement * * * that describes the result if the state measure is rejected\u201d); and (2)(d) (requiring a statement \u201csummarizing the state measure and its major effect\u201d) all require a degree of interpretive effort by the Attorney General. <em>See, e.g., Kain / Waller v. Myers, </em>337 Or 36, 93 P3d 62 (2004) (interpreting ORS 250.035(2)(a) and (b), and illustrating proposition). The Attorney General should not in the future rely on apparently contrary statements from our older decisions. Instead, the Attorney General must recognize that his or her statutory obligation includes a certain amount of basic interpretation including, in this case, an independent assessment of what the proposed initiative measure in this case <em>is </em>\u2014 statutory enactment or constitutional amendment. He or she must make that identification in order to inform potential signers of the initiative petition as to what the \u201cpractical effect\u201d of the proposed measure will be if it is adopted.</p>\n<p id=\"b544-4\">The noted textual and contextual points all lead inevitably in the same direction. The lack of any mention of the Oregon Constitution in Initiative Petition 41, the proposed measure\u2019s self-characterization as an \u201cAct,\u201d the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"501\">*501</page-number>ordinary meaning of that term, and the specific legislative recognition in ORS chapter 250 of the meaning of \u201cAct\u201d as something different from a constitutional amendment establish that Initiative Petition 41 is a proposed statute, not a proposed constitutional amendment. The Attorney General\u2019s contrary arguments are unavailing.</p>\n<p id=\"b545-4\">We hold that the caption and the summary of the Attorney General\u2019s certified ballot title fail to meet the requirement of ORS 250.085(5) that they substantially comply with the requirements set out in ORS 250.035(2)(a) and (d). The ballot title must be referred to the Attorney General for modification. <em>See </em>ORS 250.085(8) (authorizing such disposition).</p>\n<p id=\"b545-5\">One other issue requires mention. Petitioner Tauman asserts that the Attorney General\u2019s \u201cno\u201d result statement also fails to meet the standard of ORS 250.085(5) because it incorrectly indicates that current Oregon law contains no residency requirement for members of the Oregon Supreme Court. <em>See </em>ORS 250.035(2)(c) (setting out standards for \u201cno\u201d result statement). The Attorney General concedes that his \u201cno\u201d result statement is deficient in that respect, and we agree. By statute, members of the Oregon Supreme Court must have resided in the state for at least three years before assuming office. ORS 2.020(1). The Attorney General\u2019s certified ballot title, therefore, is referred to the Attorney General for modification on that ground as well.</p>\n<p id=\"b545-6\">Ballot title referred to Attorney General for modification.</p>\n<p id=\"b546-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"502\">*502</page-number>APPENDIX PROPOSED MEASURE</p>\n<p id=\"b546-5\">Be It Enacted by the People of the State of Oregon:</p>\n<p id=\"b546-6\">1 This Act shall be know[n] as the Peoples\u2019 Court Act</p>\n<p id=\"b546-7\">2 The seven judges of the Supreme Court of Oregon shall be elected from districts within the state. Six judges shall be elected from each of six geographic districts, and one judge shall be elected in a statewide district. The judge elected statewide shall be the Chief Justice of the Supreme Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b546-8\">3 The seven existing positions on the Supreme Court of Oregon shall be assigned to the following geographic districts, consisting of the following State Senate districts:</p>\n<p id=\"b546-9\">Court Position Senate Districts</p>\n<p id=\"AhN\">1 I, 2,3,4,5</p>\n<p id=\"A-A\">2 6,7,8,9,10</p>\n<p id=\"AG\">3 II, 12,13,14,15</p>\n<p id=\"AJ-\">4 16,17,18,19,20</p>\n<p id=\"AX\">5 21,22,23,24,25</p>\n<p id=\"Asc\">6 26,27,28,29,30</p>\n<p id=\"Ad6\">7 entire state</p>\n<p id=\"b546-17\">4 Any judge who is in office or is a judge-elect as of January 1, 2007 shall remain assigned to the court position to which the judge was elected until the conclusion of the term for which the judge was elected. This Act shall not have the effect of shortening the term of any incumbent judge.</p>\n<p id=\"b546-18\">5 Any candidate for election as judge of the Supreme Court of Oregon must reside in the geographic district assigned to the respective position at the time of filing for election to the position.</p>\n<p id=\"b546-19\">6 Any judge of the Supreme Court of Oregon must reside in the geographic district assigned to the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"503\">*503</page-number>judge\u2019s position throughout the judge\u2019s term of office. This residency requirement does not apply for the immediate term of any judge who is already in office, or is a judge-elect, as of January 1, 2007.</p>\n<p id=\"b547-4\">7 Current law relating to selection of the Chief Justice of the Supreme Court of Oregon shall remain in effect until such time as position number 7 on the Supreme Court is next filled by election. The next regular election to fill position number 7 shall be for the statewide district and the judge who takes office upon such election shall be Chief Justice upon taking office.</p>\n<p id=\"b547-5\">8 At any time that the Chief Justice position is vacant, the other members of the Supreme Court may elect, from among the judges of the Supreme Court, an Acting Chief Justice, who shall so serve until the Chief Justice is duly selected by interim appointment by the governor of by election.</p>\n<p id=\"b547-6\">9 This Act is intended to bring the Supreme Court of Oregon closer to the people by having each of six judges elected by geographic district, and by having the Chief Justice of the Supreme Court directly elected by all the people. The Chief Justice shall have equal authority to decide cases with each of the six other judges, but shall exercise the power, inherent in the office of Chief Justice, to manage the administrative affairs and organization of the Judicial Department. Powers held by the Chief Justice of the Supreme Court of Oregon as of November 1, 2006 shall remain with any Chief Justice elected under this Act. Such powers may not be diminished except by vote of the Legislative Assembly or by vote of the people.</p>\n<p id=\"b547-7\">10 This Act takes effect upon Passage. Certain parts of the Act are operative on delayed dates as specified in the Act.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b540-10\"> We recognize the unfortunate imprecision inherent in the phrase, \u201c[s]ix judges shall be elected from each of six geographic districts\u201d: Read literally, the wording calls for the election of a total of <em>36 </em>Supreme Court judges (six \u201cfrom each\u201d of six specified geographic districts). However, the overall context in which the phrase appears makes it clear that the sponsors of the proposed measure do not intend to expand the size of the court from seven to 37. What is intended is that <em>one </em>judge shall be elected \u201cfrom each\u201d of the six specified geographic districts.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b541-11\"> There is no similar statutory requirement respecting the content of the Attorney General\u2019s summary, which is described in ORS 250.035(2)(d) simply as a \u201cconcise and impartial statement of not more than 125 words summarizing the state measure and its major effect.\u201d Neither is there a similar statutory exemption from the word limit for the use of the phrase \u201cAmends Constitution.\u201d However, it is difficult to imagine a summary of a state measure proposing to amend the constitution that would be adequate without including that information in some form.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b544-5\"> The Attorney General cites <em>Kouns v.
