A. D.</author>\n<p id=\"b648-12\">Plaintiff, Edward J. Trainor, a police officer employed by the Town of Dover, sued defendant Francisco Santana for damages for injuries sustained as a result of defendant\u2019s alleged negligence in the operation of his motor vehicle. The essential facts which gave rise to the suit may be briefly summarized. At about 2:50 in the morning of January 4,1976 plaintiff, while in a patrol car on routine patrol in the performance of his duties, observed defendant\u2019s car \u201ctravelling at a fast speed.\u201d After chasing the car for about five blocks he noticed it came to a stop \u201calongside the road.\u201d Plaintiff approached defendant\u2019s vehicle and directed his flashlight on the occupants, defendant and another man, who he claimed \u201cwere lying in the car hiding.\u201d Then, finding the car door unlocked, he opened it, asked defendant for his driver\u2019s license, registration and insurance identifica<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"621\">*621</page-number>tion card and \u201cadvised him he was under arrest.\u201d Plaintiff testified that defendant \u201cshouted, \u2018No license\u2019, and ... at the same time, grabbed the door and started the car in one movement.\u201d As defendant slammed the door, both of plaintiff\u2019s arms became momentarily pinned inside the car. After managing to free himself he \u201cstepped out away [from the car] toward the center of the road.\u201d The wheels on defendant\u2019s car kept spinning on the icy road, then regained traction and the car \u201ccame at\u201d plaintiff who \u201ctried to jump from the path of it, but because of the icy conditions . . . was unable to clear the car entirely.\u201d Plaintiff said that the front left fender of the car hit him in his knees and above his knees, that he was \u201cspun around and . bounced back off the left rear quarter panel.\u201d At that point plaintiff drew his service revolver and shot at the left rear tire of defendant\u2019s car. Defendant fled, but was apprehended a short while later. Plaintiff sought damages for the injuries which he sustained, and his wife, plaintiff Jacquelyn Trainor, sued for damages for loss of her husband\u2019s services and consortium.</p>\n<p id=\"b649-6\">Defendant denied that his car struck plaintiff at any time. Testifying through an interpreter, he said that he first became aware that a police officer was in the area when he was parking and saw a police car come up the street and park behind his car. When the police \u201copened the [car] door and confronted [him], . . the car began to slip.\u201d He tried to stop his car because he remembered that the police car was parked to the rear of his car. He \u201crealized [his car] was slipping back and [he] gave it gas.\u201d It \u201cbegan to skid on the ice.\u201d He then heard gunshots, \u201cpulled away and went into a hidden driveway, private driveway.\u201d He then ran into his house where he was arrested.</p>\n<p id=\"b649-8\">At the close of the evidence in the jury trial defendant moved for judgment, urging the application of <em>Krauth v. Geller, </em>31 <em>N.J. </em>270 (1960). The trial judge denied the motion and the case was submitted to the jury. The jurors returned a verdict in favor of plaintiffs, finding defendant 90% negligent and plaintiff Edward J. Trainor 10% negligent. They fixed Edward Trainor\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"622\">*622</page-number>damages at $70,000 and his wife\u2019s at $5,000. Based on the jury\u2019s findings, judgment was ordered entered: (1) in favor of Edward J. Trainor for $63,000 plus prejudgment interest of $10,052, and (2) in favor of Jacquelyn Trainor for $4,500 plus prejudgment interest of $742. Defendant\u2019s motion for a new trial was denied. This appeal from the judgment followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b650-4\">Defendant does not contend on this appeal that the jury verdict is against the weight of the evidence. In urging us to reverse the judgments entered against him he maintains that it was \u201cprejudicial error\u201d for the trial judge to fail to grant his motion for judgment \u201cbased on the <em>Krauth </em>rule or to charge the jury in accordance with the rule as [he had] requested.\u201d He contends that \u201ca policeman, as well as a fireman, should be precluded from recovering damages for injuries sustained in the line of duty as the proximate result of another\u2019s negligence where such injuries arise out of a foreseeable risk of his occupation.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b650-5\">We find no merit whatever in the appeal. Defendant can take no comfort from the court\u2019s holding in <em>Krauth </em>that an owner or occupier of lands is not liable to a paid fireman for negligence with respect to the creation of a fire. 31 <em>N.J. </em>at 273. As the court explained,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b650-6\">. it is the fireman\u2019s business to deal with that very hazard and hence, perhaps by analogy to the contractor engaged as an expert to remedy dangerous situations, he cannot complain of negligence in the creation of the very occasion for his engagement. In terms of duty, it may be said there is none owed the fireman to exercise care so as not to require the special services for which he is trained and paid. .</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b650-7\">Although there is virtual unanimity with respect to non-liability for negligence as to the creation of fire, there is appreciable authority which would impose liability upon the land occupier for negligence with respect to conditions creating undue risks of injury beyond those inevitably involved in fire fighting. [at 273-274]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b650-8\">The <em>Krauth </em>rule has generally been confined to landowner or land occupier situations. <em>Accord, Jackson v. Velveray Corp., </em>82 <em>N.J.Super. </em>469, 475 (App.Div.1964), where it was held that this \u201crule of nonliability extends not only to negligence in creating <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"623\">*623</page-number>or starting the fire but also includes negligence related to the spread of the fire, such as ordinary negligence in housekeeping which tends to promote the spread of a fire after its inception from other causes.\u201d It has more recently been made applicable to (a) one who comes upon the land at the owner\u2019s or occupier\u2019s request for a limited purpose, e. <em>g., </em>to repair an oil burner, and (b) volunteer firemen as well as full-time firemen. <em>Ferraro v. Demetrakis, </em>167 <em>N.J.Super. </em>429 (App.Div.1979), certif. den. 81 <em>N.J. </em>290 (1979). However, we discern no sound basis for its extension, as urged by defendant, to cloak a motorist with immunity from suit for his negligent acts whenever his victim is an unsuspecting police officer engaged in the performance of his police duties. Defendant\u2019s erratic striking of Trainor with his car, with the resulting injury, was obviously not a foreseeable risk of the officer\u2019s exercise of his police function at the time. Beyond this, the immunity sought by defendant would be neither fair nor just. <em>Krauth, supra, </em>31 <em>N.J. </em>at 273.</p>\n<p id=\"b651-5\">Defendant calls attention to the recent case of <em>Berko v. Freda, </em>172 <em>N.J.Super. </em>436 (Law Div.1980). There, as the opening paragraph of the opinion discloses, defendant Freda left his keys in his car and the car was stolen. Plaintiff, a police officer, \u201chaving received a report by radio, saw the car and gave chase.\u201d He contended \u201cthat his police car was intentionally rammed three times and that the thief, after the cars were stopped, intentionally stepped on the accelerator while he had his arm in the open door.\u201d He, Officer Berko, \u201cwas dragged and injured.\u201d 172 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 437. Among other things, the trial judge deemed the <em>Krauth </em>rule applicable and granted defendant Freda\u2019s motion for summary judgment. We disapprove of that disposition. See the majority opinion of the Supreme Court in <em>Hill v. Yaskin, 75 N.J. </em>139 (1977).</p>\n<p id=\"b651-6\">Defendant\u2019s motion for judgment was properly denied, as was his request that the jury be instructed in accordance with the <em>Krauth </em>rule.</p>\n<p id=\"b651-7\">The judgment under review is affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
