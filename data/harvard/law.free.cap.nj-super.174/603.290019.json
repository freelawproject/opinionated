J. A. D.</author>\n<p id=\"b632-14\">The sole issue involved in this appeal concerns the time when a teacher becomes sufficiently \u201cat work\u201d that a subsequent accident might be said to have resulted from the performance of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"605\">*605</page-number>his or her regular or assigned duties within the contemplation of <em>N.J.S.A. </em>18A:66--39(c).</p>\n<p id=\"b633-4\">The resolution of factual disagreements is not one of our problems in this appeal, for the essential facts are not in dispute. For instance, it is not contested that a fall on the school property at a time when Margaret May Carlson, the applicant in the agency and appellant here, was required by her teaching duties to be in the school, directly caused Carlson to become \u201cstatutorily permanently and totally disabled\u201d and that that fall was a \u201ctraumatic event\u201d as that term is used in the statute in question. A single question remains from the substantially agreed facts and it is essentially a legal one: Do the time and place of the occurrence mandate exclusion from statutory coverage because the event did not occur \u201cduring and as a result of the performance of [Carlson\u2019s] regular or assigned duties\u201d? The administrative law judge answered this inquiry in the affirmative. The Board of Trustees of the Teachers\u2019 Pension and Annuity Fund (Board) adopted his findings of fact and conclusions of law and \u201caffirmed the denial of Accidental Disability retirement for Margaret May Carlson.\u201d We reverse.</p>\n<p id=\"b633-5\">Carlson was employed as a teacher in the Roseland school system and was enrolled in the Teachers\u2019 Pension and Annuity Fund. Her employment required that she arrive at the school premises not later than 8:35 a. m. This requirement was imposed to insure ready availability for service when the bell rang at 8:55 a. m. to signal \u201cthe commencement of the school day,\u201d as the State puts it in its counterstatement of facts. Uncontroverted testimony demonstrates that the 20-minute (or more) period between arrival and the bell marking the commencement of school time was freely available to the teacher for whatever use he or she wanted to make of it. It is clear, and wholly credible, that the activities during this time are as varied as the natures and inclinations of the many teachers. Congregation in \u201cthe teachers\u2019 room\u201d\u2014a room reserved for the \u201crest and relaxation\u201d of the teachers; \u201cthere\u2019s a lavatory there and everything\u201d \u2014was apparently a common event although a myriad of activities resulted. The testimony on cross-examination of a colleague of Carlson is graphic:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b634-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"606\">*606</page-number>Q What do teachers do in the teacher\u2019s room?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b634-4\">A On the day in question?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b634-5\">MR. MOORE [Attorney for the Board]: Generally.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b634-6\">THE COURT: At that early hour?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b634-7\">MR. MOORE: Between 8:35 and 8:55 when they\u2019re there?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b634-8\">A While they\u2019re there, different teachers do different things. Some work on their papers, some talk, some read a book, some have a cup of tea or glass or [sic] water or juice.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b634-9\">Q Read newspapers?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b634-10\">A Depends on the individual and what he has to do that day.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b634-11\">Q And socialize?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b634-12\">A Some, right.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b634-13\">Q There\u2019s nothing in particular you\u2019re required to do by the school during that 20 minute period?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b634-14\">A Not that I\u2019m aware of other than make sure that you\u2019re ready for your class.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b634-15\">Q At 8:55?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b634-16\">A Right.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b634-17\">But when that bell rang at 8:55 teacher choice disappeared. The school day commenced. Contractually imposed teacher duties began.</p>\n<p id=\"b634-18\">On the day in question a fairly unique and atypically communal activity engaged the attention of the teachers. A \u201clittle get together,\u201d characterized in the findings in the agency as \u201can informal get-together,\u201d was held in the teachers\u2019 room to welcome back the newly married principal and sixth grade teacher. Most of the teachers attended; one had baked a cake. The affair was quite modest: no beverages were served. Then the 8:55 bell rang signaling the commencement of the school day and imposing upon Carlson the requirement that she immediately repair to the school door to escort her pupils to the classroom. The administrative law judge describes in his findings what then happened:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b634-19\">. At this point, Petitioner, who was in the vicinity of the door of the teacher\u2019s room, walked from the door toward a couch on the other side of the room, <em>in order to get her pocketbook and proceed to the playground to pick up her class of students and lead them to her </em>classroom. As she proceeded to walk from the door, without warning, suddenly and unexpectedly her feet went out from under her and she fell heavily to the floor on her back. [Emphasis supplied]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b634-20\">As is implicitly acknowledged in the findings of the administrative law judge, there was no competent evidence as to what caused Carlson to fall.</p>\n<p id=\"b635-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"607\">*607</page-number>The question which troubled that judge was \u201cwhether the traumatic event occurred <em>during and as a result of </em>the performance of her regular and assigned duties.\u201d That inquiry is, of course, not only relevant but under the facts of this case dispositive. Relying exclusively on two unreported Appellate Division determinations, he concluded that the traumatic event fell short of satisfying cither the \u201cduring\u201d test or the \u201cas a result of\u201d test.</p>\n<p id=\"b635-4\">We are well aware that workers\u2019 compensation principles do not govern claims under the accidental disability retirement provisions of the teachers\u2019 pension and annuity fund. <em>Russo v. Teachers\u2019 Pension and Annuity Fund, </em>62 <em>N.J. </em>142 (1973). We are equally aware that \u201cliberality\u201d in the distribution of such benefits contravenes legislative intent respecting administration of these funds. <em>Cattani v. Board of Trustees, </em>69 <em>N.J. </em>578, 583 (1976). Accordingly, in deference to both the Legislature and our court of last resort we bring to this appeal a studied, conservative view of both the statute and the facts. Nevertheless, we are of the opinion that Carlson qualifies for accidental disability retirement and the denial of that relief in the agency was error.</p>\n<p id=\"b635-5\">We need not consider in this case the infinitely more difficult proposition respecting the obligation of teachers from the time of their mandated presence on the premises\u2014in this case, 8:35\u2014until the ringing of the bell signaling the commencement of the school day, such as that of supervision of early arrivals or room preparation. <em>See Titus </em>v. <em>Lindherg, </em>49 <em>N.J. </em>66 (1967). For in the case before us the event did not happen until after the 8:55 bell had rung and at a time when the teachers were <em>required </em>to perform certain functions. One of these required functions was for Carlson to go from where she was to the school door and playground to meet her charges. It is this which she was doing when she became totally disabled. We are persuaded that the injury resulting from the doing of something required to be done by the employment contract, here the movement of the teacher from where she is on the school <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"608\">*608</page-number>premises to where she is compelled to go to meet those she has been directed to meet, at the time when that act is required to be done, is an injury sustained during and as a result of the performance of regular or assigned duties.</p>\n<p id=\"b636-4\">It appears to have been the view of the administrative law judge that anything done at any time prior to contact between teacher and the pupils she was required to shepherd was only preparatory to that which he considered \u201cactual performance.\u201d While such a view has the virtue of an objective standard, it ignores the very practical consideration that Carlson obviously was not expected to stand in the schoolyard door from 8:35 until 8:55. No one can doubt that she was expected to perform this required union with her pupils by going from here to there and that necessary maneuver was as much a requirement of the job as was the actual liaison.</p>\n<p id=\"b636-5\">The unreported cases on which the administrative law judge relied are distinguishable. In one the claimant was injured five minutes before his work shift began. In the other the claimant, an employee of the Division of Motor Vehicles, was on his way home from work. We held that even in those circumstances the event occurred \u201cduring\u201d the performance of assigned duties because he had certain \u201cincidental enforcement\u201d duties to be performed when coming to or going from work. But he was not engaged in doing anything related to these incidental enforcement duties when his vehicle was struck' by another. Also distinguishable are <em>Boston Retirem. Bd. v. Contributory Retirem. Appeal Bd., </em>340 <em>Mass. </em>109, 162 N.E.2d 821 (Sup.Jud.Ct.1959), and <em>Boston Retirem. Bd. v. Contributory Retirem. Appeal Bd., </em>340 <em>Mass. </em>112, 162 N.E.2d 824 (Sup.Jud.Ct.1959). In the former the claimant was on her way home to lunch and in the latter the claimant was returning to her work from lunch. We need look no further than New Jersey to find ease law exempting \u201cgoing and coming\u201d injuries from statutory benefits of this nature. <em>O\u2019Keefe v. Board of Trustees, </em>131 <em>N.J.L. </em>502 (Sup.Ct.1944), aff\u2019d o. b. 132 <em>N.J.L. </em>416 (E. &amp; A.1945). Carlson\u2019s movement toward the required connection with her students can hardly be characterized as a \u201cgoing and coming\u201d matter.</p>\n<p id=\"b637-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"609\">*609</page-number>Reversed and remanded for the calculation and payment of appropriate benefits.</p>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b637-5\">LANE, J. A. D.</author>\n<p id=\"AJp\">(dissenting).</p>\n<p id=\"b637-6\">The majority reverses the final administrative determination of the Board of Trustees of the Teachers\u2019 Pension and Annuity Fund on the ground that the accident occurred after the bell rang summoning the teachers to proceed to the playground to pick up their classes of students and lead them to the classrooms. I do not agree that petitioner\u2019s teaching duties began before she picked up her class at the playground. In my opinion there was sufficient credible evidence in the record to support the findings of fact by the administrative law judge whose decision was accepted by the Board of Trustees of the Teachers\u2019 Pension and Annuity Fund. I agree with his legal conclusions. I would, therefore, affirm the denial of petitioner\u2019s application for accidental disability retirement.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
