J. A. D.</author>\n<p id=\"b370-11\">This is an appeal from a judgment of the Law Division declaring the provisions of <em>N.J.S.A. </em>17:22-6.6a and 17B:22-8(c) unconstitutional as violative of the Equal Protection and Due Process Clauses of the Federal and State Constitutions. The provisions were enacted by L.1975, c. 364, and became effective on March 3, 1976. <em>N.J.S.A. </em>17:22-6.6a reads:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b370-12\">No insurance agent\u2019s, broker\u2019s or solicitor\u2019s license shall be issued or renewed to any banking institution or savings and loan association which regularly accepts deposit from New Jersey residents not regularly employed by said lending institutions or its affiliates or bank holding company, finance company, except any finance company affiliated with an insurance company, mortgage loan company, credit union or any other institution whose principal business is the lending of money, nor any parent company, subsidiary, affiliate, service corporation or member bank thereof, except that this section shall not apply with respect to credit life insurance, credit accident and health insurance, group mortgage cancellation life insurance or group mortgage accident and Health insurance.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b370-13\">The Commissioner of Insurance is authorized to promulgate regulations to effectuate the purpose of this section, which will assist in maintaining the separation between lending institutions and the insurance business and to minimize the possibilities of unfair competitive practices by lending institutions or their related companies.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b371-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"343\">*343</page-number>Similar language was adopted as part of the Life and Health Insurance Code at <em>N.J.S.A. </em>17B:22 8(c).</p>\n<p id=\"b371-5\">Because the statute prohibited the Commissioner from renewing the insurance license of any agent or broker who was affiliated with a financial institution and because of the difficulty in discerning such an affiliation, questionnaires were prepared and sent with the applications for renewal<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> of property-casualty brokers in New Jersey. Some 18,000 renewal applications and questionnaires were returned to the Department in September and October 1977.

As evident in <em>N.J.S.A. </em>17:22-6.6a and 17B:22-8(c), the Legislature, in enacting the law, specifically intended (1) to maintain the separation between lending institutions and the insurance business, and (2) to minimize the possibilities of unfair competitive practices by lending institutions or their related companies. The Legislature recognized the grave potential for abuse of a lending institution\u2019s power over a borrower which could lead to coercion of the borrower in the placement of insurance on the property which is the subject matter of the loan. For example, the approval of a mortgage application might be premised on an expensive homeowner\u2019s policy or an automobile loan might be approved only if the applicant obtains insurance through a broker or agent who is affiliated with the financial institution. The converse of this is also applicable in that insurance agents and brokers have been known to steer their insureds to a premium finance company in which they have an interest rather than informing their insureds that certain insurance carriers offer deferred payment plans.</p>\n<p id=\"b374-6\">This legislative purpose was found by the trial judge to be a reasonable, indeed important, legislative objective. Nevertheless, the trial judge determined that it was not substantial enough to support the statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b374-7\">While the authority of the Legislature in enacting laws must be exercised in conformity with the Due Process and Equal Protection Clauses of the State and Federal Constitutions, the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"347\">*347</page-number>power of judicial review is generally a limited one. The court may only determine whether the legislation is reasonable. Thus, if any state of facts may be reasonably conceived to justify the legislation, the court must sustain it. <em>McGowan v. Maryland, </em>366 <em>U.S. </em>420, 81 <em>S.Ct. </em>1101, 6 <em>L.Ed.2d </em>393 (1961). The court may not substitute its own policy judgment for that of the Legislature.</p>\n<p id=\"b375-4\">We agree with Judge Schoch in his conclusion that the legislation challenged here is constitutionally invalid because of the absence of a logical basis for the exclusions made by the Legislature in the body of the statute. One exclusion enables lending institutions engaged in the business of providing credit life insurance, credit accident and health insurance, group mortgage cancellation life insurance and group mortgage accident and health insurance to apply for and renew requisite insurance agent, broker or solicitor licenses. Lending institutions engaged in the business of providing any other type of insurance, whether directly or through an affiliate, are expressly denied the privilege of being issued or renewing any insurance agent, broker or solicitor licenses. A second exemption provides that finance companies affiliated with insurance companies are not subjected to the statutory prohibition, and are free to obtain and renew licenses to engage in all types of insurance business. All finance companies not affiliated with insurance companies are prohibited from engaging in the insurance business, both directly and through affiliates.</p>\n<p id=\"b375-5\">The essence of the Equal Protection Clause under the Fourteenth Amendment of the Federal Constitution, as well as the sometimes even more demanding equal protection guarantees implied in our State Constitution, is that persons situated alike shall be treated alike. Both the state and federal guarantees seek to insure equality of right by forbidding arbitrary discrimination between persons similarly situated. <em>Robinson </em>v. <em>Cahill, </em>62 <em>N.J. </em>473 (1973), <em>cert. </em>den. 414 <em>U.S. </em>976, 94 <em>S.Ct. </em>292, 38 L.Ed.2d 219 (1973), <em>Schmidt v. Newark Bd. of Adj., </em>9 <em>N.J. </em>405 (1952). These equal protection guarantees do not require the State to treat all persons identically. <em>Shepard v. Woodland Tp. </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"348\">*348</page-number><em>Comm. and Planning Bd., </em>71 <em>N.J. </em>230 (1976). It is, of course, recognized that the Legislature has some leeway in making classification, that mathematical precision is not required, and that policy decisions as to the need for and wisdom of the legislation are properly left to that body and not to the courts. However, equal protection does mandate that differences in treatment not be arbitrary or invidious; that those distinctions which are made be justified by an appropriate state interest, and that they bear a real and substantial relationship to furthering governmental ends.</p>\n<p id=\"b376-4\">In equal protection analysis, \u201ccourts must reach and determine the question whether the classifications drawn in a statute are reasonable in light of its purpose.\u201d <em>McLaughlin v. Florida, </em>379 <em>U.S. </em>184, 191, 85 <em>S.Ct. </em>283, 288, 13 L.Ed.2d 222 (1964). In determining whether a classification is reasonably related to the basic objective of the legislation or to some relevant consideration of public policy, we must consider the facts and circumstances behind the law, the interests which the State claims to be protecting, and the interests of those who are disadvantaged by the classification. This determination as to the reasonableness of the classification must be made even when no suspect classifications have been drawn and no fundamental interests have been infringed. See, for example, <em>Group Health Ins. of N.J. v. Howell, </em>43 <em>N.J. </em>104 (1964).</p>\n<p id=\"b376-5\">A statutory classification is constitutionally objectionable where it is either under or overinclusive, and either event will serve to void the statute on equal protection grounds. <em>Rinaldi v. Yeager, </em>384 <em>U.S. </em>305, 86 <em>S.Ct. </em>1497, 16 L.Ed.2d 577 (1966).</p>\n<p id=\"b376-6\">The inequality resulting from an underinclusive classification in a regulatory enactment resides in the burdening of some persons in a manner that furthers a public purpose, while others who are similarly situated are not subjected to that same burden. As was stated in <em>Washington National Ins. Co. v. Board of Review, </em>1 <em>N.J. </em>545 (1949):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b377-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"349\">*349</page-number>* * * The equal protection of the laws means that no person or class of persons shall be denied the protection of the laws enjoyed by other persons or classes of persons under similar conditions and circumstances, in their lives, liberty, and property, and in the pursuit of happiness, both as respects privileges conferred and burdens imposed. * * * [at 553]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b377-5\">Judge Schoch correctly concluded that the Legislature, without rational justification, chose to exempt some persons from a classification to which they logically and fairly belong. Such statutory underinclusiveness was appropriately found to be so arbitrary as to deny equal protection.</p>\n<p id=\"b377-6\">The State proffers several theories to explain the Legislature\u2019s purpose in exempting certain types of insurance and certain types of insurance business/lending institution relationships from the scope of the statutory prohibition. Judge Schoch considered and rejected each suggested legislative purpose, finding therein no reasonable basis for the recognition of separate classes, and no rational relationship between the Legislature\u2019s disparate treatment of the classes and the object sought to be achieved by the legislation.</p>\n<p id=\"b377-7\">The State suggests that credit insurance is different from other types of insurance since it is \u201cnormal or incidental to the business of lending money\u201d and \u201cintrinsically related to the lending of money.\u201d The State argues that the Legislature could rationally conclude that because credit insurance protects the investment of a lending institution, that lending institution must be allowed to obtain or place credit insurance for consumers through affiliated insurance agencies.</p>\n<p id=\"b377-8\">We find no rational distinction between the situation where a lending institution seeking to protect its investment places credit insurance for its consumers through an affiliate insurance agency, and where a lending institution seeking the payment of premiums from its consumers places other types of insurance through an affiliate insurance agency. In each instance the incentive on the part of the lending institution in placing insurance through its affiliate is economic. If anything, the potential for coercion of a consumer by a lending institution may be greater with respect to credit insurance than for other forms of insurance. Not only does the lending institution stand <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"350\">*350</page-number>to gain protection for its investment; it also benefits by referring a customer to its affiliate insurance agency where a premium will be extracted to secure the desired investment protection. In short, the relationship between credit insurance and lending institutions urged as a ground for differential treatment by the State is not relevant to the evil addressed by the statute\u2014the anti-competitive practice of \u201ctying in\u201d insurance sales and lending.</p>\n<p id=\"b378-4\">The argued justification for the exemption relating to finance companies affiliated with insurance companies also fails to account for the differential treatment worked by the statute. The State suggests that because many insurance companies are part of large holding companies which may include finance companies, the Legislature could reasonably conclude that the relationship between insurance companies and finance companies is necessarily so attenuated that the problem of consumer coercion will not occur. This was characterized as a \u201cbigger is better\u201d theory by Judge Schoch and was rejected as the purported rational basis for sustaining that exemption.</p>\n<p id=\"b378-5\">The State\u2019s position that insurance companies in the money lending business present a lower risk for coercion than those types of association between lending institutions and their affiliated insurance agents or brokers is simply not supported by the record.</p>\n<p id=\"b378-6\">The second basis alleged by the State to support the exemption is the fact that many insurance companies engage in premium financing activities, and that some <em>of </em>these insurance companies choose to do this financing through subsidiary or affiliated finance companies. Certainly such a situation is fraught with the same potential for consumer coercion that the Legislature perceived in other areas where lending institutions were connected with the insurance business. A consumer applying for insurance will be conveniently (and perhaps coercively) steered by the company to its affiliated insurance premium finance company. The finance charge for this service plus the desire to make the purchase of insurance economically feasible is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"351\">*351</page-number>ample incentive for the insurance company to act in such a fashion. Despite this danger, the State suggests that the exception was designed to \u201callow the insurance companies to continue this aspect of their business for the benefit of the policyholders.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b379-4\">The State\u2019s position, plainly put, is that in the name of customer convenience, the danger of coercive practices is to be endured. There is nothing to show that the insurance company customers\u2019 needs would not be adequately met by the many licensed insurance premium financing companies operating in the State. <em>N.J.S.A. </em>17:16D-1 <em>et seq. </em>Under the circumstances, it is difficult to see how the insurance company customer would be seriously disadvantaged by including within the prohibition against writing insurance finance companies affiliated with insurance companies.</p>\n<p id=\"b379-5\">In view of our conclusions herein, we deem it unnecessary to deal with Judge Schoch\u2019s second finding that \u201cthis statute is violative of * * * the due process clauses of the Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution and to the New Jersey Constitution.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b379-7\">Affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b371-9\"> All insurance licenses are renewed for two year terms which is why the brokers\u2019 licenses were in effect since the adoption of <em>N.J.S.A. </em>17:22-6.6a and 17B:22-8(c).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
