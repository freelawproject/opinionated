Execution was thereafter levied upon monies allegedly owing to defendant from Travelers Insurance Company (Travelers) in the form of PIP medical expense benefits and income continuation benefits owing under its No-Fault <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"3\">*3</page-number>insurance policy. <em>N.J.S.A. </em>39:6A-4(a), (b). The precise nature of this appeal cannot be succinctly stated since we have not been furnished with a copy of the order under review and the procedural history is altogether unclear. However, we gather from the trial judge\u2019s letter opinion of January 18, 1979 that the subject for review consists of the trial judge\u2019s determination that the \u201cexecution levied herein [be] vacated and all proceedings in aid thereof quashed\u201d on the ground that the insurance benefits are exempt from the claims of creditors.</p>\n<p id=\"b31-5\">Conceding the absence of any specific statutory basis for his ruling, the trial judge nevertheless concluded that the benevolent overall legislative policy expressed by the New Jersey Automobile Reparation Reform Act, <em>N.J.S.A. </em>39:6A 1 et seq., requires that such monies be treated as secured from the claims of creditors. We disagree and reverse.</p>\n<p id=\"b31-6\">Under <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2A: 17-57 and 58 a judgment creditor is free to levy upon the \u201crights and credits\u201d of a judgment debtor except for such property \u201cas is reserved or exempt by law.\u201d It appears from the record herein that defendant is an absconding debtor. Also relevant is <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2A:17-50 which allows execution against \u201cthe . . . debts ... of the judgment debtor.\u201d The general rule is that exemptions from execution \u201care mere creatures of statute or constitutional enactment\u201d and do not exist at common law. <em>General Motors Accept. Corp. v. Falcone, </em>130 <em>N.J.Super. </em>517, 520 (Cty.Ct.1974); see 35 <em>C.J.S. Exemptions </em>\u00a7 1; 31 <em>Am.Jur.2d, Exemptions, </em>\u00a7 2. Furthermore, statutes in aid of judgment should be liberally construed in favor of the creditor. <em>Mechanics Finance Co. v. Austin, </em>8 <em>N.J. </em>577, 582 (1952).</p>\n<p id=\"b31-8\">As the trial judge in his letter opinion of January 18, 1979 correctly noted, other enactments expressing comparable legislative policies, such as those providing for disability health insurance, workers\u2019 compensation, unemployment compensation and temporary disability payments, expressly exempt such benefits <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"4\">*4</page-number>from execution by judgment creditors. He incorrectly concluded, however, that \u201c[n]o reason in logic or policy emerges which dictates a different result in the case of PIP benefits.\u201d The reason which he overlooked is that this statute, unlike the others, has no such provision for the exemption of PIP benefits. The Legislature\u2019s omission of words of unmistakable meaning which it used in other enactments compels the conclusion that the omission was intentional. <em>See Keenan v. Essex Cty. Bd. of Chosen Freeholders, </em>101 <em>N.J.Super. </em>495, 505-507 (Law Div.1968), aff\u2019d 106 <em>N.J.Super. </em>312 (App.Div.1969). On this principle, in <em>Passaic Nat\u2019l Bank, etc., Co. </em>v. <em>Eelman, </em>116 <em>N.J.L. </em>279 (Sup.Ct.1936), the court reasoned that since an exemption from execution and garnishment is \u201cordinarily derived from statute,\u201d it was \u201creasonable to assume that its omission from the pension statute in question was significant and purposeful.\u201d Id. at 286, 183 A. at 681. We therefore conclude that the trial judge erred in vacating plaintiff\u2019s writ of execution upon monies owing by Travelers to defendant Pratt under its No-Fault policy.</p>\n<p id=\"b32-5\">Plaintiff\u2019s application for counsel fees pursuant to <em>R. </em>4:42-9(a)(6) is denied. The claim here asserted is not made \u201cupon a liability or indemnity policy of insurance.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b32-6\">Reversed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
