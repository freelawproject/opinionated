YOUNG, JR., DEFENDANT.</parties>\n<court data-order=\"1\" data-type=\"court\" id=\"b517-8\">Superior Court of New Jersey Resentencing Panel</court>\n<decisiondate data-order=\"2\" data-type=\"decisiondate\" id=\"b517-9\">Decided February 20, 1980.</decisiondate>\n<p data-order=\"3\" data-type=\"judges\" id=\"b518-7\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"490\">*490</page-number>Before Judges COLEMAN, MARZULLI and YANOFF.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b518-8\"><em>Susan H. Fessler, </em>Assistant Deputy Public Defender, for defendant <em>(Stanley C. Van Ness, </em>Public Defender, attorney).</attorneys>\n<attorneys data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b518-9\"><em>Bradford M. Bury, </em>Assistant Prosecutor, for plaintiff <em>(John H.

For this he received a sentence of 2V2 to 3 years concurrent to a sentence imposed for violation of probation.</p>\n<p id=\"b518-13\"><em>State v. Reed </em>points out that forgeries in most cases involve obtaining money by false pretenses and thus convictions for forgery are congruent to thefts by deception under <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:20-4. In <em>Reed </em>the amount involved exceeded $500, and the crime was one of the third degree. <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:20-2 b(2)(a). In this case, however, if the congruent offense is controlled by Chapter 2C, the crime is one of the fourth degree because the amount exceeds $200, but is less than $500 <em>(N.J.S.A. </em>2C:20-2 b(3)), for which the maximum punishment is 18 months <em>(N.J. S.A. </em>2C:43-6). If Chapter 21 of the Code dealing with \u201cForgery <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"491\">*491</page-number>and Fraudulent Practices\u201d be considered applicable, since the forged instrument was a check the crime is not elevated beyond the fourth degree <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:21 1 b; <em>State v. Reed, supra.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b519-5\">Because the sentence imposed upon defendant exceeds the maximum possible under the Code, he is entitled to be considered for resentencing <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:11 d(2). A date will be fixed for that purpose.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
