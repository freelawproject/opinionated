In the present case, not to consider the abandonment and termination of the contract in determining the date of \u201clast labor performed,\u201d would be to reach such a result. It would also leave this subcontractor, and subcontractors in a similar position, largely at the mercy of owners and general contractors. [at 594]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b645-15\">We disagree and reverse.</p>\n<p id=\"b645-16\">Contrary to the trial judge\u2019s assumption that the call for strict construction of the mechanic\u2019s liens statutes might, in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"618\">*618</page-number>many cases, be softened by the facts of a particular case, the language of our cases commands otherwise. Thus, in <em>Friedman v. Stein, </em>4 <em>N.J. </em>34 (1950), it was stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b646-4\">The mechanic\u2019s and the materialman\u2019s liens had their genesis in the civil law. They are unknown to the common law; and they have had no recognition in equity except as prescribed by statute. [Citations omitted]. Thus it is that these liens are exclusively statutory in origin; and, being in derogation of the common law, the provisions of the statute giving rise to the lien are to be strictly construed, while the provisions for the enforcement of the lien thereby created are to be liberally construed to effectuate the remedial statutory policy of providing priority of payment of the price or value of work performed and materials furnished in the erection or reparation of a building or other structure and this wise the security of the land and buildings for the payment of that which has made for an assumed enhancement of the value of the property. [Citations omitted].</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b646-5\">The claim for labor and materials is a property right which does not ripen into an enforceable lien on the land and building until there has been substantial compliance with all the statutory conditions prerequisite. This is a familiar rule of construction. It is fundamental that the lien does not materialize until all the statutory requisites are met. This by legislative ordinance. [Citations omitted]. The statutory lien is separate and distinct from the underlying debt; the lien affords a cumulative remedy for the enforcement of the debt. [Citation omitted]. The claimant\u2019s status is that of a general creditor until those things are done which give him the security of the statutory lien. Until then, the lien is inchoate merely. [at 40-41]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b646-6\">Nor does the holding of the former Court of Errors and Appeals in <em>Derrickson v. Edwards, </em>29 <em>N.J.L. </em>468 (E. &amp; A. 1861), support the action taken by the trial judge. The language in <em>Derrickson </em>relied on by the trial judge:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b646-7\">First, that the contract is an entirety, and that, in the contemplation of the statute, the work and materials cannot be considered as furnished until the whole contract was completed. Neither the language of the act, nor any intention which can be collected from it, requires a mechanic working under a contract to file lien claims from week to week, as his work progresses. [29 <em>N.J.L. </em>at 470-471]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b646-8\">does not support the conclusion he reached in denying judgment below. Putting aside the fact that <em>Derrickson </em>was decided under a statute which has long since been amended, a fair reading of <em>Derrickson </em>indicates that the contract referred to by Judge Ogden was the contract between the defendants in error (Edwards) and Derrickson, and not the general contract for the construction of the entire project. There, the lien claim was found to have been filed in a timely manner since the last work <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"619\">*619</page-number>under the contract in question had been performed within the period established for the filing of a claim under the statute\u201412 months. Here, the claim of plaintiff was filed well beyond the statutory four-month period and, therefore, cannot be maintained.</p>\n<p id=\"b647-4\">We can find no basis for support of the trial judge\u2019s holding in <em>Malcolm Price, Inc. v. Sloane, </em>308 A.2d 779 (D.C.App.1973), aff\u2019d on remand 339 A.2d 43 (D.C.App.1975). The District of Columbia opinion involves the construction of sections (\u00a7\u00a7 38 102 and 115) of the District of Columbia Code 1967. The District legislation is not similar to ours, and, accordingly, we do not find the <em>Malcolm Price </em>case apposite.</p>\n<p id=\"b647-5\">Where a subcontractor performs work on a job over a period of time, the statutory period for filing a mechanic\u2019s lien claim does not begin to run until the work under that subcontract has been completed or the materials furnished. It is not necessary for a subcontractor to file a separate claim each time he performs work on or delivers material to the job. <em>See Rigberg v. Narduc Development Corp., </em>47 <em>N.J.Super. </em>588, 592 (Ch.Div., 1957). This principle does not support the conclusion that a subcontractor\u2019s time for filing a claim is extended until the entire job is completed under the master contract.</p>\n<p id=\"b647-6\">The judgment of the Law Division is reversed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
