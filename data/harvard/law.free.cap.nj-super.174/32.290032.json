J. A. D.</author>\n<p id=\"b62-11\">This appeal concerns relative rights among an assigned risk insured, his apparently absconding insurance agent or broker and the firm of that individual, the organization that financed that insurance, the insurance company, a passenger in the insured's car, the driver of another car involved in an accident with the insured, and the Unsatisfied Claim and Judgment Fund. The matter is complex both procedurally and substantively. Its presentation to us is not without omissions and in some cases requires assumptions. To add to the burden inherent in the convoluted and intricate problem, important determinations in at least one of the trial courts involved arrive here without any findings by the trial judge in his grant and denial of a number of vital summary judgment motions. The ultimate irony resides in our conviction that a legal proposition neither argued nor considered below is sufficiently vital, both in the sense of its importance as a public question and with respect to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"35\">*35</page-number>essential justice in this case, that we must not ignore it. Pursuant to the authority of <em>R. </em>2:10-2 and consistent with its policy pronouncement, we reverse.</p>\n<p id=\"b63-5\">In June 1973 Lee D. Brown (Brown), an assigned risk under the Motor Vehicle Security-Responsibility Law (N.J.S.A. 39:6-23 <em>et seq.), </em>obtained auto liability insurance from Lumbermens Mutual Casualty Company (Lumbermens) through Walter Shaw Insurance Agency, a business operated by Walter Shaw as an insurance broker or agent (Shaw). This insurance policy became effective on June 1,1973 and was to terminate one year later on June 1, 1974. Unable to pay the full amount of the insurance premium ($137), Shaw arranged for Brown to execute a premium finance agreement with Arista Factors, Inc. (Arista). This agreement required Brown to make payments to Arista of $16.38 a month for eight months commencing on July 4, 1973. Brown testified that he also gave Shaw an initial deposit of $40 when he executed the agreement. The finance agreement authorized Arista to pay Lumbermens the full premium due.</p>\n<p id=\"b63-6\">This contract further provided that the event of default by Brown in the payment of any installment when due</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b63-7\">. shall render the whole unpaid balance of principal hereof immediately due and payable, without notice and if default continues for ten (10) days thereafter, shall constitute an election by the undersigned insured to cancel said policy. It is agreed that, in such event the undersigned insured will promptly return the policy and the payee is hereby authorized to notify the insurance company of such cancellation and to collect and receive from such company all return or unearned premium for application as above mentioned. It is also agreed that the undersigned insured will pay a $5.00 cancellation fee.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b63-8\">To effectuate the foregoing, said insurance company is hereby authorized and directed:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b63-9\">(a) To pay any return premium to said payee which may become due under the policy other than from cancellation; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b63-10\">(b) To pay any unearned premium to said payee which may become due on account of cancellation of said policy at any time by the undersigned insured, the payee or the insurance company; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b64-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"36\">*36</page-number>(c) To include the name of the said payee as payee with the undersigned insured in any check or draft issued on account of any loss, which may be or become payable to the undersigned insured, but only in the event it reduces or voids the unearned premium of the policy, and subject however to all mortgagee interest, if any.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b64-5\">Another and different result said to eventuate upon ten-day default in payment appeared elsewhere in the agreement:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b64-6\">Failure to pay an installment within 10 days of due date will result in late charges of a charge equal to a minimum of $1.00 or 5% of such installment or $5.00 which ever is less.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b64-7\">Although the agreement recited Brown\u2019s promise to pay to the order of Arista at its place of business and contained an express disavowal of any agency in Shaw, Brown\u2019s testimony that Shaw told him he was \u201cto make the payments to him until my payment book came and my insurance policy\u201d is unrefuted.</p>\n<p id=\"b64-8\">After receiving the premium finance agreement and the July 4, 1973 payment \u201con or about August 4, 1973,\u201d Arista processed the agreement and \u201cmailed the entire premium for [the] policy to [Lumbermens].\u201d There is evidence that Arista did not receive Brown\u2019s payment due on August 4. Accordingly, on August 9 Arista mailed a \u201clate notice letter\u201d to Brown which stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b64-9\">Please note that to date, we have not received payment on the above listed loan. We would not like to cancel your insurance and therefore, ask you to please forward your check within five (5) days, so that it will not be necessary for us to take any further steps to collect this loan.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b64-10\">Kindly give this your prompt attention. Thank you.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b64-11\">Brown, who claims that he had paid Shaw the August 4 payment, took the letter to Shaw. In Brown\u2019s presence Shaw dialed a number on the telephone and talked to someone apparently from Arista. After Shaw hung up he informed Brown <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"37\">*37</page-number>\u201cthat there had been a mistake\u201d and \u201cthat [Brown\u2019s] insurance was all right and [that he] could continue driving.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b65-4\">On August 14 Arista had still not received the August payment from either Brown or Shaw. On that date Arista sent a \u201ccancellation notice\u201d to Brown which stated in pertinent part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b65-5\">Date of Notice August 14, 1973</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"Am\">Effective Date of Cancellation</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"Ar\">August 28, 1973 At 12:01 A.M.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AzX\">Standard Time</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b65-6\">TO THE NAMED INSURED:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b65-7\">You are hereby notified that your policies listed above are cancelled effective as of the date shown above subject to policy terms and conditions. These policies are cancelled by us in accordance with the authority which you have given us in consideration of our financing the premiums.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b65-8\">IMPORTANT:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b65-9\">IF AN AUTOMOBILE POLICY IS INVOLVED:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b65-10\">PROOF OF FINANCIAL SECURITY IS REQUIRED TO BE MAINTAINED CONTINUOUSLY THROUGHOUT THE REGISTRATION PERIOD AND FAILURE TO MAINTAIN SUCH PROOF OF FINANCIAL SECURITY REQUIRES REVOCATION OF THE REGISTRATION OF THE MOTOR VEHICLE, UNLESS THE REGISTRATION CERTIFICATE AND NUMBER PLATES OF SUCH VEHICLE HAVE BEEN SURRENDERED TO THE COMMISSIONER PRIOR TO THE TIME AT WHICH THE TERMINATION BECOMES EFFECTIVE.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b65-11\">Brown went back to Shaw. He showed him the notice. Shaw told him \u201cthe same thing he told me the first time. He told me sometimes the finance company and the service company get mixed up and he said that the policy was all right. He had called the finance company and I could continue driving.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"AP\">It is apparent that Arista exercised its power of attorney and directed Lumbermens to cancel Brown\u2019s insurance policy. It seems that this was done by forwarding to Lumbermens a copy of the \u201ccancellation notice\u201d containing the following preface:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AmY\">The following is a certified true copy of a Notice of Cancellation which was sent to your insured cancelling the policy listed below and complies with the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"38\">*38</page-number>notice requirement of Section 13 of New Jersey\u2019s Insurance Premium Finance Company Act. All return premiums are to be calculated as of the effective date of cancellation indicated. Kindly send your remittance for the gross return premium at your earliest convenience, to our office.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b66-4\">We pause to observe that Arista also thus assured Lumbermens that it had complied with \u00a7 13 (obviously <em>N.J.S.A. </em>17:16D-13) of \u201cNew Jersey's Insurance Premium Finance Company Act.\u201d Lumbermens complied, cancelled the policy and returned the premium.</p>\n<p id=\"b66-5\">Four days after the purported effective date of the cancellation Brown was driving his car when it was involved in an accident with a motor vehicle being operated by Oscar Johnson (Johnson). Brown and a passenger in his car, Dorothy Jackson (Jackson), were injured. After his release from the hospital Brown took his hospital bills to Shaw and reported the accident. Shaw said nothing to Brown with regard to the fact that his insurance policy had been cancelled.</p>\n<p id=\"b66-6\">Brown alleged that \u201croughly a month later\u201d he called Lumbermens to see what was holding up his claim. He testified that he was told by a Mr. Jung that his policy was \u201cokay\u201d and that Lumbermens was waiting to hear from Oscar Johnson\u2019s insurance company before settling his claim. Brown continued to make his regular monthly insurance payments to Shaw through December 1973, and in that month Shaw gave Brown a written statement \u201csaying my policy was good as far as [Shaw\u2019s] office is concerned.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b66-7\">Apparently Brown finally called Lumbermens again and this time was told that his insurance policy had been cancelled. Thereafter Lumbermens refused to reimburse Brown for his claim and refused to defend him in this lawsuit which followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b66-8\">[The court here reviewed the complicated procedural history of the case]</p>\n<p id=\"b66-9\">From the outset of this litigation, and at all times since, the question put in issue by Brown\u2019s reply brief [the propriety of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"39\">*39</page-number>the Arista cancellation], previously raised or not, was in our judgment among the most important considerations implicit in the matter. While the different counsel Brown has had\u2014appellate counsel did not argue the motions or try the case\u2014should have seen and raised the issue, and the employment of a reply brief to assert new arguments is improper, <em>State v. Smith, </em>55 <em>N.J. </em>476, 488 (1970),<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Brown is wholly right in his averment that issues of public policy permeate the proposition. Beyond this, our concern for the proper disbursement of public funds might easily have moved us to undertake the question even had it been raised by no one. Finally, the fundamental rights of Brown, who achieved only an 11th grade education, may be deeply involved in this battle with an absconding insurance broker or agent, a sophisticated high risk money lender and an established successful insurance company. In such case, \u201csubstantial justice may require that the scope of inquiry be not thus restricted\u201d to matters raised below. <em>Spiegle v. Seaman, </em>160 <em>N.J.Super. </em>471, 481 (App.Div.1978). While ordinarily matters not raised below will not be reviewed on appeal, <em>Nieder v. Royal Indem. Ins. Co., </em>62 <em>N.J. </em>229, 234 (1973), general public importance alone will warrant a departure from that rule. <em>Deerfield Estates, Inc. </em>v. <em>East Brunswick Tp., </em>60 <em>N.J. </em>115 (1972).</p>\n<p id=\"b67-5\">We are entirely satisfied that the matter is of considerable general public importance. In the first place, legislation affecting automobile insurance has always been considered remedial, to be construed to effect the broadest protection of auto accident victims and to limit exclusions by strict construction against the insurer. <em>Motor Club of America v. Phillips, </em>66 <em>N.J. </em>277, 293 (1974); <em>Fellippello v. Allstate Ins. Co., </em>172 <em>N.J.Super. </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"40\">*40</page-number>249, 261-262 (App.Div.1979). This clear and consistent pronouncement of public policy in the State is soundly derived from legislative action determining that policy. Consistent with this, we have no doubt at all that the Insurance Premium Finance Company Act, <em>N.J.S.A. </em>17:16D-1 <em>et seq. </em>in general and here <em>N.J.S.A. </em>17:16D-13 in particular, ought to be adjudged to require exact and careful compliance and to be strictly enforced. This is no more than a matter of attention to the public policy of New Jersey and a matter of general public importance.</p>\n<p id=\"b68-5\">The significance of the presence of Fund monies in the case highlights our concern. Judge Seidman, then sitting in the Law Division, aptly described our mission in this regard in <em>Feliciano </em>v. <em>Oglesby, </em>102 <em>N.J.Super. </em>378 (Law Div.1968):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b68-6\">The [Unsatisfied Claim and Judgment] Fund is held in trust for the stated purposes and for the costs of administration. <em>Wormack v. Howard, </em>33 <em>N.J. </em>139, 143 (1960). The public interest demands that the Fund be administered in a fashion to assure that only those persons legitimately entitled to participate in its benefits are paid therefrom. This is a duty imposed by public policy and owed to the contributors as well as to the general public. <em>Douglas v. Harris </em>[35 <em>N.J. 270, supra. </em>The judiciary of this State is the guardian of the trust moneys represented by the statutory Fund. <em>Szczesny v. Vasquez, 71 N.J.Super. </em>347, 358 (App.Div.1962). [At 391]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b68-7\">Accordingly, we have determined to review the issue despite the fact that it was not raised except at the very last minute and then improperly. That review persuades us that Arista did not comply with <em>N.J.S.A. </em>17:16D-13.</p>\n<p id=\"b68-8\">Brown was never advised of the \u201cintent of the premium finance company to cancel the insurance contract\u201d or of his right to cure the default within the minimum ten-day period of the required written notice of intent to cancel. <em>N.J.S.A. </em>17:16D-13(b). He was told instead that Arista \u201cwould not like to cancel your insurance\u201d and that if the policy was cancelled it could not. be reinstated. He was dunned for \u201cyour check within five (5) <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"41\">*41</page-number>days, so that it will not be necessary for us to take any further steps to collect this loan,\u201d and a \u201clate charge\u201d was imposed. But he was never advised of an intent to cancel. The next advice he received, which was also sent to the insurance company, was that \u201cyour policies [s/c] listed above are cancelled\u201d on the \u201cEffective Date of Cancellation\u201d fourteen days later. This document bore a title in solid capital letters: CANCELLATION NOTICE.</p>\n<p id=\"b69-4\">Thus Arista clearly did not comply with the statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b69-5\">For reasons set forth above, we believe consideration of this failure to comply is essential to a proper and just determination of the rights among the parties contested in the matters on appeal. Because the issue was not raised the judges below did not consider that dereliction. Public policy and essential justice require that this now be done.</p>\n<p id=\"b69-6\">All motion orders and judgments below in the matters on appeal are vacated.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The matters are consolidated and remanded to the trial court for further proceedings consistent with this opinion. We do not retain jurisdiction. No costs.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b67-6\"> Beyond the impropriety of presentation of a new issue in a reply brief, counsel also disregarded the requirement of <em>R. </em>2:6-2(a)(l) declaring it to be \u201cmandatory that any point not presented below be so indicated by including in parenthesis a statement to that effect in the point heading.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b69-7\"> This is not intended to disturb the judgment in the Jackson negligence action.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
