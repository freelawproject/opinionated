A. D.</author>\n<p id=\"b322-7\">Plaintiff Aetna Insurance Co. (Aetna) appeals from the trial court\u2019s decision in this declaratory judgment action that Aetna must afford defendant Alvin Weiss a defense and coverage under a homeowner\u2019s insurance policy issued by Aetna to defendant against liability on the part of defendant's deceased daughter (also an insured) for personal injury to a passenger caused by deceased\u2019s operation of a moped which was involved in an accident with a truck. Aetna here argues, as it did in the trial court, that it is free of obligation to defendant by reason of the exclusion from coverage expressed in the policy for bodily injury arising out of the operation or use of \u201cany motor vehicle owned or operated by or rented or loaned to any insured.\u201d The trial judge concluded that the moped is not a motor vehicle within the meaning of the policy and ordered Aetna to defend the personal injury action and to provide coverage against liability. Defendant-cross-appellant St. Paul Insurance Company which issued its excess coverage policy to Weiss agrees that its obligations are governed by the construction to be accorded the Aetna policy.</p>\n<p id=\"b322-8\">\u201cMotor vehicle\u201d is defined by the policy only as \u201ca land motor vehicle.\u201d Excluded from this definition is a \u201crecreational motor vehicle.\u201d The term \u201crecreational motor vehicle\u201d is defined as</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b322-9\">(1) A golf cart or snowmobile or (2) if not subject to motor vehicle registration, any other land motor vehicle designed for recreational off-road use.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b322-11\">It is apparent that the policy definition of \u201cmotor vehicle\u201d is unserviceable since it fails to specify the meaning of \u201cmotor vehicle.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b322-12\">The moped operated by defendant\u2019s decedent is essentially a bicycle in form, which can be operated either by muscular force exerted on its pedals, or by a small motor, or both in combina<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"295\">*295</page-number>tion. Its wheels are 17 inches in diameter and its 49.9 cubic centimeter motor, rated at 1.5 horsepower, delivers less power than a lawnmower engine. It can be operated at a maximum speed of 25 miles an hour. These specifications conform to those of a \u201cmotorized bicycle\u201d which was defined at the time of the accident, and still is, under <em>NJ.S.A. </em>39:1-1 as</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b323-5\">A pedal bicycle having a helper motor characterized in that either the maximum piston displacement is less than 50 c.c. or said motor is rated at no more than 1.5 brake or horsepower and said bicycle is capable of a maximum of speed of no more than 25 miles per hour on a flat surface.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b323-6\">A motorized bicycle is expressly excluded from the definition of \u201cmotorcycle\u201d and also from the definition of \u201cmotor vehicle,\u201d which includes</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b323-7\">All vehicles propelled otherwise than by muscular power <em>excepting </em>such vehicles as run only upon rails or tracks and <em>motorized bicycles. </em>[Emphasis supplied].</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b323-8\">In concluding, as we do, that the moped operated by defendant\u2019s decedent on the day of the accident was not a motor vehicle within the meaning of the policy exclusion, we do not overlook <em>Laino </em>v. <em>Nationwide Mut. Fire Ins. Co., </em>169 <em>N.J.Super. </em>65 (App.Div.1979). There, in a similar case and under materially comparable policy language, the court concluded that a \u201cminibike\u201d was a motor vehicle for purposes of the policy exclusion. Although no physical description of the vehicle is furnished in that opinion, the language thereof leaves no doubt that the court distinguished it from a \u201cmotorized bicycle,\u201d and the holding could only have rested upon a finding that it answered the description of a motorcycle, as defined in the statute, and was thus a motor vehicle.</p>\n<p id=\"b323-9\">Nor have we disregarded <em>State v. Lyons, </em>152 <em>N.J.Super. </em>533 (Cty.Ct.1977), aff\u2019d 159 <em>N.J.Super. </em>100 (App.Div.1978). That decision is carefully limited to the proposition that the policy of the drunken driving statute, <em>N.J.S.A. </em>39:4-50, is as applicable to the operators of motorized bicycles as to operators of motor vehicles. It held only that the \u201coperation of a moped upon a public road is subject to the same standards of conduct and care as is the operation of a motor vehicle,\u201d 152 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 537, and that this policy should \u201cprevail over a narrowly definitional analysis of the phrase \u2018motor vehicle\u2019 which appears in <em>N.J.S.A. </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"296\">*296</page-number>39:4-50.\u201d 152 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 539. It refrained from holding that a moped is a motor vehicle.</p>\n<p id=\"b324-4\">It is a basic rule in the interpretation of insurance policies that if the controlling language of a policy will support two meanings, one favorable to the insured and the other favorable to the insurer, a court will apply the interpretation favoring coverage. <em>Butler v. Bonner &amp; Barnewell, Inc., </em>56 <em>N.J. </em>567 (1970); <em>Ohio Cas. Ins. Co. v. Flanagin, </em>44 <em>N.J. </em>504, 513-514 (1965); <em>Mazzilli v. Accident &amp; Cas. Ins. Co. of Winterthur, </em>35 <em>N.J. </em>1, 7 (1961); <em>American Legion Hosp. v. St. Paul Fire Ins. Co., </em>106 <em>N.J.Super. </em>393, 397 (App.Div.1969). If there is any doubt, uncertainty or ambiguity in the phraseology of a policy, or if the phraseology is susceptible to two meanings, the construction favoring coverage must be adopted. <em>Kook v. American Sur. Co. of N. Y., </em>88 <em>N.J.Super. </em>43, 52 (App.Div.1965). Further, strict interpretation is applied to clauses of exclusion in insurance policies which are designed to limit the protection afforded. <em>Mazzilli, supra, </em>35 <em>N.J. </em>at 8; <em>Butler, supra, </em>56 <em>N.J. </em>at 576. Exclusionary language in a policy must be plain and clear. <em>Gerhardt v. Continental Ins. Cos., </em>48 <em>N.J. </em>291, 296 (1966). One of the factors which courts must consider in construing language of a policy is whether the use by the insurer of alternative or more precise language would have \u201cput the matter beyond reasonable question.\u201d <em>Mazzilli, supra, </em>35 <em>N.J. </em>at 7; <em>American Legion Hosp., supra, </em>106 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 397. As stated in <em>Mazzil</em>li:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b324-5\">Insurance contracts are unipartite in character. They are prepared by the company\u2019s experts, men learned in the law of insurance who serve its interest in exercising their draftsmanship art. The result of their effort is given to the insured in the printed form upon the payment of his premium. [35 <em>N.J. </em>at 7-8.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b324-6\">Furthermore, it is the burden of the insurer to demonstrate that coverage does not exist because of the exclusions within the policy. <em>Burd v. Sussex Mut. Ins. Co., </em>56 <em>N.J. </em>383, 399 (1970). Plaintiff must show that the insured\u2019s interpretation of the exclusionary clause is entirely unreasonable. <em>Hanover Ins. Group v. Cameron, </em>122 <em>N.J.Super. </em>51, 59 (Ch.Div.1973). It has not done so.</p>\n<p id=\"b324-7\">Affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
