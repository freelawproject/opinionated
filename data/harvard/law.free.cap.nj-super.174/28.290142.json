They also sought, among other things, judgment directing the borough \u201cto take immediate steps to inaugurate an alternate system.\u201d After a nonjury trial, the trial judge filed his opinion which is reported at 162 <em>N.J.Super. </em>248 (Law Div.1978). This was followed by an order directing the entry of judgment in favor of defendant borough \u201cdismissing the complaint of the plaintiff without prejudice and without costs in accordance with filed Opinion.\u201d Defendant appeals \u201cfrom the Judgment and Opinion . . .\u201d However, in the \u201cPreliminary Statement\u201d in its brief submitted on the appeal it defines the scope of the review which it seeks. Thus, it explains:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b57-11\">Although the Notice of Appeal appears to be an appeal from the entire judgment and opinion, the appellant seeks only review of those portions of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"30\">*30</page-number>opinion of the Honorable Kevin M. O\u2019Halloran which determined 1) that there was actual injury to the health or comfort of ordinary people to an unreasonable extent, 2) that the nuisance, if it exists at all, is a private nuisance or it is a public nuisance with a special injury to plaintiffs, and such other factual determinations which the Borough of Demarest considers erroneous under all of the circumstances and which will be delineated in the legal argument below. The Borough of Demarest contends that the ultimate \u201cbottom line\u201d judgment of dismissing the Complaint because of a failure of proof was correct; however, because of the peculiar nature of the judgment, to wit; a dismissal without prejudice, the <em>res judicata </em>effect of the erroneous factual determinations must be corrected on appeal. It is the Borough of Demarest\u2019s position that it is the peculiar nature of an emergency signalling device which separates and distinguishes this type of case from virtually all other types of nuisance cases. Not only were the proofs insufficient as a matter of <em>fact </em>to sustain a finding that the plaintiffs had suffered actual injury, but that as a matter of <em>law, </em>the standard should have been greater than that imposed by Judge O\u2019Halloran.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b58-5\">In a subsequent letter memorandum, counsel for the borough states in part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b58-6\">The Borough of Demarest takes the position that the judgment should have been a dismissal with prejudice an[d] without the accompanying gratuitous remarks in the Opinion that the \u201cplaintiffs should not have to suffer forever.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b58-7\">The defendant-appellant recognizes that it ultimately was the successful party in the Court below. It also is aware that the only issue before the Court on this appeal is whether Judge O\u2019Halloran\u2019s determinations which led him to the conclusion that a judgment of dismissal without prejudice would be appropriate, were erroneous. Nevertheless, because of the potential for future prejudice and harm to the Borough of Demarest by the potential for future litigation, it would be unjust to deny the defendant-appellant from relief because it may have been construed as the \u201csuccessful\u201d party in the Court below.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b58-8\">Counsel suggests that since the borough seeks review of Judge O\u2019Halloran\u2019s \u201cwithout prejudice\u201d determination, it \u201cis an aggrieved party within the meaning of <em>Howard Savings Inst. </em>v. <em>Peep, </em>34 <em>N.J. </em>494, 499 (1961).\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b58-9\">We find no merit in counsel\u2019s suggestion or in the borough\u2019s appeal. In <em>Christiansen v. Christiansen, </em>46 <em>N.J.Super. </em>101 (App.Div.1957), certif. den. 25 <em>N.J. </em>56 (1957), this court pointed out that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b58-10\">A dismissal without prejudice is comparable to a nonsuit under the former practice at law. It adjudicates nothing. Another action may be instituted and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"31\">*31</page-number>the same facts urged, either alone or in company with others as the basis of a claim for relief. [At 109]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b59-5\">Beyond this, the trial judge having ruled in its favor, the borough was not an aggrieved party entitled to appeal from the judgment. It had no \u201cpersonal or pecuniary interest or property right adversely affected by the judgment in question.\u201d <em>Howard Savings Inst. v. Peep, supra, </em>34 <em>N.J. </em>at 499. <em>See, also, Camarco </em>v. <em>Orange, </em>61 <em>N.J. </em>463, 467 (1972). The borough \u201crecognizes that it ultimately was the successful party\u201d in the trial court. In essence, it seeks a review \u201conly\u201d of \u201cportions of the opinion\u201d of the trial judge. However, it is well settled that appeals \u201care taken from judgments and not from opinions.\u201d <em>Hughes v. Eisner, </em>8 <em>N.J. </em>228, 229 (1951); <em>Glaser v. Downes, </em>126 <em>N.J.Super. </em>10, 16 (App.Div.1973), certif. den. 64 <em>N.J. </em>513 (1974); <em>Credit Bureau Collection Agency v. Lind, </em>71 <em>N.J.Super. </em>326, 328 (App.Div.1961).</p>\n<p id=\"b59-6\">The appeal is dismissed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
