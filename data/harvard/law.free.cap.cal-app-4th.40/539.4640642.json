Dvorak for libel and invasion of privacy based upon the contents of a campaign flyer published by a political organization to which Dvorak contributed money. The flyer accused Matson, a candidate for election to the city council, of having \u201chundreds of dollars of unpaid fines and citations\u201d issued by the police department. Matson also challenges the court\u2019s award of attorney fees to Dvorak in accordance with Code of Civil Procedure section 425.16, subdivision (c). (Further section references are to the Code of Civil Procedure unless otherwise specified.)</p>\n<p id=\"b226-5\">As we shall explain in the published portion of this opinion, the trial court correctly applied section 425.16 to this lawsuit because it arises from an act in furtherance of the right of free speech. The cause of action for libel was properly stricken because Matson made no showing that Dvorak had a responsible role in the publication. One whose only contribution to a political campaign is financial, and who otherwise is not involved in the preparation, review or publication of campaign literature, cannot be subject to liability in a defamation action for statements contained in the publication even if it is established that the statements are false and were published with malice. The cause of action for invasion of privacy was properly stricken because, regardless of whether a record of unpaid fines is a private or public fact, the claim that a candidate for public office has refused or neglected to pay fines is a legitimate issue of public concern.</p>\n<p id=\"b226-6\">In the unpublished parts of our opinion, we discard Dvorak\u2019s assertion that Matson failed adequately to perfect his right to appeal from the trial court\u2019s orders, and reject Matson\u2019s challenge to the attorney fee award. Accordingly, we shall affirm the judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b227-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"543\">*543</page-number>Facts and Procedural Background</p>\n<p id=\"b227-5\">In 1992, Paul Matson and David Tobiassen were members of the Nevada City Council and rival candidates for the Nevada County Board of Supervisors in the general election held on November 3, 1992. To some extent, Matson was characterized in the contest as a \u201cpro-environment, anti-development\u201d candidate, while Tobiassen was characterized as \u201cpro-development.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b227-6\">Five days before the election, an unspecified number of Nevada County voters received in the mail a campaign flyer urging them to \u201cJust Say No to Paul Matson!\u201d The flyer states it is \u201cpaid for by Concerned Citizens for Responsible Leadership,\u201d and contains this text: \u201cPaul Matson doesn\u2019t want to obey the law . . . FID ... He just wants to be your Supervisor!\u201d \u201cSome politicians think they\u2019re better than the rest of us! HD According to city records, Nevada City Councilman Paul Matson has hundreds of dollars of unpaid fines and citations stacking up in city hall. Not just current violations, but dating back into the mid 1980\u2019s!\u201d The accompanying illustration shows a stack of eight purported citations marked \u201cPolice Department FID Notice of Violation FJD **Delinquent**\u201d on each of which is Matson\u2019s name. One such document, dated June 1987, bears the notation \u201c$315 Bail FID Mail to: Nevada City Police\u201d; no date or bail amount is visible on the other documents depicted.</p>\n<p id=\"b227-7\">Matson lost the November 1992 election. A year later, he sued David Tobiassen, Concerned Citizens for Responsible Leadership, and various individuals and entities Matson later alleged to be members and contributors of Concerned Citizens for Responsible Leadership: Eugene J. Dvorak, Dean Deniz, Amaral Family Trust, Jack A. Erickson, The Erickson Group, Ltd., and Wildwood West Real Estate. The complaint seeks damages for libel, invasion of privacy, and violation of the California Political Reform Act. It alleges the campaign flyer (1) \u201cfalsely stat[es] that plaintiff was a scofflaw and a person who habitually flaunted his violations of the law\u201d; (2) was prepared with information that defendants unlawfully obtained from \u201cconfidential records concerning plaintiff in the possession of the Nevada City Police Department\u201d; and (3) unlawfully concealed that Concerned Citizens for Responsible Leadership was a \u201csponsored committee\u201d organized to support the rival candidacy of defendant Tobiassen.</p>\n<p id=\"b227-8\">Defendants other than Dvorak moved to strike the libel and invasion of privacy claims (the first and second causes of action, respectively) on the ground there is no probability Matson will prevail on these claims. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"544\">*544</page-number>(\u00a7 425.16.)<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Among other things, they asserted that Matson\u2019s cause of action for libel fails to contain essential factual allegations which would support an inference that the campaign flyer was published with actual malice <em>(New York Times Co. </em>v. <em>Sullivan </em>(1964) 376 U.S. 254, 279-280 [11 L.Ed.2d 686, 706-707, 84 S.Ct. 710]), and the invasion of privacy cause of action is untenable because the citations referred to in the flier are not \u201cprivate facts\u201d and are matters of legitimate public concern in that Matson was a political candidate <em>(Diaz </em>v. <em>Oakland Tribune, Inc. </em>(1983) 139 Cal.App.3d 118, 126 [188 Cal.Rptr. 762]).</p>\n<p id=\"b228-4\">Following these successful motions, Dvorak moved to strike the complaint pursuant to section 425.16. In addition to incorporating the memoranda of points and authorities filed by other defendants and also arguing that the libel cause of action is unlikely to prevail because the statements attributed to him are substantially true or merely are an assertion of opinion, Dvorak averred that he (1) does not know Matson or Tobiassen, (2) did not prepare or read the allegedly libelous campaign flyer, and (3) is not a member of defendant Concerned Citizens for Responsible Leadership, knows no one who is, and has \u201cno knowledge of who sponsored the Concerned Citizens for Responsible Leadership, or who it was formed to support.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b228-5\">Matson opposed Dvorak\u2019s motion with evidence that Tobiassen\u2019s campaign \u201cwas supported by many people involved in Nevada County real estate development projects, including . . . Dvorak,\u201d and that Tobiassen used false pretenses to obtain from the police department a list of overdue parking citations, which he knew to be inaccurate and which included 20 overdue parking citations issued to Matson. According to Matson, Tobiassen then \u201cprovided the information he obtained regarding Matson to Dean Deniz and the other individual defendants. It is unknown whether he apprised them of his knowledge concerning the unreliable nature of this information.\u201d Matson also submitted copies of campaign disclosure forms filed by Concerned Citizens for Responsible Leadership, which show that Dvorak contributed <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"545\">*545</page-number>$999 to the organization and that virtually all sums collected by Concerned Citizens for Responsible Leadership were spent on the allegedly libelous mailing.</p>\n<p id=\"b229-5\">In July 1994, the court granted Dvorak\u2019s motion to strike the libel and invasion of privacy claims based on section 425.16, finding \u201cplaintiff did not meet his burden of proof to establish a probability that he will prevail on his claim as to these causes of action.\u201d The order says nothing about whether Matson was permitted to amend these two causes of action.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b229-6\">Dvorak then sought attorney fees and costs pursuant section 425.16, subdivision (c), which states in pertinent part that a defendant who prevails on a motion to strike under section 425.16, subdivision (b) \u201cshall be entitled to recover his or her attorney\u2019s fees and costs.\u201d The court subsequently awarded Dvorak costs and $2,200 in attorney fees.</p>\n<p id=\"b229-7\">While Dvorak\u2019s motion for attorney fees was pending, Matson amended his complaint. The amended complaint restates the libel and invasion of privacy causes of action, again names Dvorak as a defendant in those theories of recovery, and adds an allegation that Dvorak was not \u201cmerely [a] contributor[]'to Concerned Citizens for Responsible Leadership\u201d but was a \u201cknowing participante in the formation and improper actions of Concerned Citizens for Responsible Leadership.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b229-8\">Dvorak (together with defendants Amaral Family Trust, Jack A. Erickson, The Erickson Group, Ltd., and Wildwood West Real Estate) renewed the motion to strike the libel and invasion privacy causes of action from the amended complaint (as contrary to section 425.16 and made without leave of court), moved for judgment on the pleadings as to all causes of action, and requested sanctions.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b229-9\">Matson responded by filing a \u201cstipulation\u201d\u2014to which he and defendant Amaral Family Trust alone are parties\u2014stating Matson \u201cagrees that in light of the Court\u2019s previous rulings, the first two causes of action of the First Amended Complaint for Damages (Libel) do not apply to and are not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"546\">*546</page-number>brought against defendants Amaral Family Trust, Eugene J. Dvorak, Jack A. Erickson, The Erickson Group, Limited, and Wildwood West Real Estate</p>\n<p id=\"b230-4\">In his opposition to the second motion to strike and for judgment on the pleadings, Matson volunteered to \u201cdismiss those defendants who truly are \u2018mere contributors\u2019 to Concerned Citizens [for Responsible Leadership],\u2019\u2019 complaining that he had been hampered in his efforts to depose each of the defendants so as to ascertain which were \u201cmere contributors.\u201d Matson nonetheless refused to abandon his opposition to Dvorak\u2019s motion; Matson stated he \u201cis not at this time willing to credit [Dvorak\u2019s] deposition testimony in which he claimed that he had no involvement in Nevada County politics; that he barely knew [defendant] Dean Deniz; that he did not contribute $999 to Concerned Citizens; and that he does not know why Deniz listed him as a contributor in that amount.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b230-5\">On November 14, 1994, the court granted defendants\u2019 motions. In a document entitled \u201cJudgment and Order,\u201d the court found that \u201c[pjlaintiff again renamed defendants in the first two causes of action for libel and invasion of privacy, causes of action that were clearly stricken by the Court as to the moving defendants\u201d; ordered that \u201cthe motions to strike/demurrers and motion for judgment on the pleading as to the third cause of action against all moving defendants are granted and/or sustained without leave to amend\u201d; and denied defendants\u2019 requests for sanctions.</p>\n<p id=\"b230-6\">Dvorak then brought a motion to recover his attorney fees and costs in connection with making the second motion to strike the libel and invasion of privacy causes of action, seeking an award of $3,317.63. (\u00a7425.16, subd. (c).) Matson opposed the motion on the ground that, prior to the hearing on Dvorak\u2019s second series of motions, \u201cthere was some confusion among the parties as to whether the plaintiff had attempted to reassert his first and second causes of action against the moving defendants in this first amended complaint\u201d; to resolve the issue, he had filed a stipulation that the first and second causes of action in the amended complaint do not apply to Dvorak, among others; consequently, the November 1994 order striking the libel and invasion of privacy claims \u201cwas not granted under section 425.16\u201d and no attorney fees under that section may be awarded.</p>\n<p id=\"b230-7\">In December 1994, the court entered an \u201cOrder and Judgment: Re Costs and Attorney Fees (Second),\u201d in which it awarded Dvorak $800 in attorney fees in connection with bringing his second motion to strike, in light of the \u201cduplicate nature of the second motion, . . . [and] the fact that a stipulation had been entered which eliminated the contributors as parties to the first and second causes of action . . . .\u201d This appeal followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b231-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"547\">*547</page-number>Discussion</p>\n<p id=\"b231-5\">I<footnotemark>*</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b231-6\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b231-7\">Turning to Matson\u2019s contentions on appeal, we first examine whether the trial court erred in permitting a special motion to strike under section 425.16.</p>\n<p id=\"b231-8\">Matson contends this lawsuit \u201cis not a SLAPP\u201d because to so characterize it is inconsistent with the \u201chistory of section 425.16\u201d and is \u201cnot what the Legislature had in mind.\" In support of this argument, Matson relies upon the following dicta from <em>Dixon </em>v. <em>Superior Court, supra, </em>30 Cal.App.4th 733: \u201cThe <em>typical </em>SLAPP suit involves citizens opposed to a particular real estate development. The group opposed to the project, usually a local neighborhood, protests by distributing flyers, writing letters to local newspapers, and speaking at planning commission or city council meetings. The developer responds by filing a SLAPP suit against the citizen group alleging defamation or various business torts. . . . SLAPP plaintiffs do not intend to win their suits; rather, they are filed solely for delay and distraction . . . , and to punish activists by imposing litigation costs on them for exercising their constitutional right to speak and petition the government for redress of grievances.\u201d <em>(Id., </em>at p. 741, citations and fn. omitted.)</p>\n<p id=\"b231-9\">While the foregoing discussion provides useful background regarding SLAPP suits, we are governed by familiar rules of statutory interpretation in evaluating whether section 425.16 can be applied to this action.  Our primary duty is to ascertain the intent of the Legislature by looking to the words of the statute and giving them their ordinary meaning. <em>(People </em>v. <em>Broussard </em>(1993) 5 Cal.4th 1067, 1071 [22 Cal.Rptr. 278, 856 P.2d 1134].) When statutory language is clear and unambiguous, there is no need for interpretation, and we must apply the statute as written. <em>(People </em>v. <em>Overstreet </em>(1986) 42 Cal.3d 891, 895 [231 Cal.Rptr. 213, 726 P.2d 1288].)</p>\n<p id=\"b231-10\">Section 425.16, subdivision (b) states in part: \u201cA cause of action against a person arising from any act of that person in furtherance of the person\u2019s right of petition or free speech under the United States or California Constitution in connection with a public issue shall be subject to a special motion to strike, unless the court determines that the plaintiff has established that there is a probability that the plaintiff will prevail on the claim.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b232-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"548\">*548</page-number>In ruling that Matson had not established a probability of success on his claims, the trial court impliedly found Dvorak had satisfied the threshold requirement of showing the claims arose from an act in furtherance of his right of free speech. The record supports the trial court\u2019s determination on this threshold issue. The right to speak on political matters is the quintessential subject of our constitutional protections of the right of free speech. \u201cPublic discussion about the qualifications of those who hold or who wish to hold positions of public trust presents the strongest possible case for applications of the safeguards afforded by the First Amendment.\u201d <em>(Aisenson </em>v. <em>American Broadcasting Co. </em>(1990) 220 Cal.App.3d 146, 154 [269 Cal.Rptr. 379].) It is axiomatic that the qualifications of a declared candidate for public office is a public issue. (See, e.g., <em>Kapellas </em>v. <em>Kojman </em>(1969) 1 Cal.3d 20, 36 [81 Cal.Rptr. 360, 459 P.2d 912] [\u201c. . . government officials and candidates for such office have almost always been considered the paradigm case of \u2018public figures\u2019 who should be subjected to the most thorough scrutiny\u201d]; <em>McCoy </em>v. <em>Hearst Corp. </em>(1986) 42 Cal.3d 835, 859 [231 Cal.Rptr. 518, 727 P.2d 711] [\u201c[t]he public possesses an \u2018independent interest\u2019 in the qualifications and performance of its public officials\u201d].) Accordingly, the campaign mailer at issue was plainly published in furtherance of the author\u2019s \u201c \u2018right ... of free speech under the United States or California Constitution in connection with a public issue,\u2019 \u201d and thus brings an action arising from its publication within the purview of section 425.16. <em>(Wilcox </em>v. <em>Superior Court, supra, </em>27 Cal.App.4th at pp. 819-820.)</p>\n<p id=\"b232-4\">Once the party moving to strike a complaint pursuant to subdivision (b) of section 425.16 has made a prima facie showing that the lawsuit arises from an act by the defendant in furtherance of his right of petition or free speech under the United States or California Constitution in connection with a public issue, the plaintiff must establish a \u201cprobability\u201d that he will prevail on the merits of the complaint. (\u00a7 425.16, subd. (b).) To establish such a probability, a plaintiff must demonstrate that the complaint is both legally sufficient and supported by a sufficient prima facie showing of facts to sustain a favorable judgment if the evidence submitted by the plaintiff is credited. <em>(Wilcox </em>v. <em>Superior Court, supra, </em>27 Cal.App.4th at pp. 823-825.) Whether he has done so is a question of law, which we determine de novo. <em>(Ibid.; Hung </em>v. <em>Wang </em>(1992) 8 Cal.App.4th 908, 931 [11 Cal.Rptr.2d 113]; <em>Aquino </em>v. <em>Superior Court </em>(1993) 21 Cal.App.4th 847, 850 [26 Cal.Rptr.2d 477].)</p>\n<p id=\"b232-5\">Matson asserts that he has established \u201ca legally sufficient, prima facie claim of libel\u201d in which \u201cDvorak\u2019s involvement is established.\u201d In addressing this contention, we turn first to the question whether Matson made a sufficient showing that Dvorak was involved in the publication at issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b233-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"549\">*549</page-number>The general rule for defamation is that only one \u201cwho takes a <em>responsible </em>part in the publication is liable for the defamation.\u201d <em>(Osmond </em>v. <em>EWAP, Inc. </em>(1984) 153 Cal.App.3d 842, 852 [200 Cal.Rptr. 674], italics in original; <em>Jones </em>v. <em>Calder </em>(1982) 138 Cal.App.3d 128, 134 [187 Cal.Rptr. 825].) For example, the business manager of a foreign newspaper was not liable where there was no evidence that he had control over the editorial staff and it was undisputed that he had no knowledge of the preparation or content of the subject articles until after publication <em>(Sakuma </em>v. <em>Zellerbach Paper Co. </em>(1938) 25 Cal.App.2d 309, 321-322 [77 P.2d 313]); and the distributor of allegedly libelous materials cannot be held liable unless it is shown that he either knew of its libelous content or knew of facts which imposed a duty to investigate. <em>(Osmond </em>v. <em>EWAP, Inc., supra, </em>at p. 855.)</p>\n<p id=\"b233-5\">Matson contends \u201cDvorak\u2019s involvement [in publication of the flyer] is established\u201d because \u201cthe financial disclosure form filed by Concerned Citizens for Responsible Leadership reflects that Dvorak contributed $999 or 28 percent of the $3,546 raised by the group.\u201d We disagree that Dvorak\u2019s mere contribution of money to Concerned Citizens for Responsible Leadership is sufficient to establish that he played a \u201cresponsible part\u201d <em>(Osmond </em>v. <em>EWAP, Inc., supra, </em>153 Cal.App.3d at p. 852) in the alleged libel. Matson does not allege that Dvorak participated in preparing the mailing, knew of its contents in advance of publication, knew that the charges made in the campaign mailer were false, or held any position in the organization from which his oversight of campaign literature can be inferred. To the contrary, in opposition to the motion to strike, Matson says only of Dvorak that he \u201csupported\u201d Tobiassen\u2019s candidacy, made a cash contribution, and was \u201cprovided\u201d by Tobiassen with inaccurate information concerning the status of Matson\u2019s parking citations. Matson admits \u201cit is unknown\u201d whether Tobiassen apprised Dvorak of the unreliability of that information upon which the campaign mailer was based. Because the evidence submitted by Matson, if taken as true, does not indicate that Dvorak had a responsible part in the publication of the alleged libel, the court did not err in ruling that Matson has failed to demonstrate a probability of prevailing on his libel claim against Dvorak. One whose only contribution to a political campaign is financial, and who is not involved in the preparation, review or publication of campaign literature, cannot be subjected to liability in a defamation action for statements contained in that literature, just as one whose only involvement in the publication of a libelous magazine article is ownership of shares in the publishing company cannot be held personally liable for the defamatory article.</p>\n<p id=\"b233-6\">In light of this conclusion, we need not address Dvorak\u2019s contention that Matson fails to show a probability he can satisfy the constitutional requirement of establishing the campaign flier was published with malice. <em>(Philadelphia Newspapers, Inc. </em>v. <em>Hepps </em>(1986) 475 U.S. 767, 776 [89 L.Ed.2d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"550\">*550</page-number>783, 793, 106 S.Ct. 1558]; <em>New York Times Co. </em>v. <em>Sullivan, supra, </em>376 U.S. at pp. 279-280 [11 L.Ed.2d at p. 706] [the constitutional guarantees of the First and Fourteenth Amendments \u201cprohibit[] a public official from recovering damages for a defamatory falsehood relating to his official conduct unless he proves that the statement was made with \u2018actual malice\u2019\u2014that is, with the knowledge that it was false or with reckless disregard of whether it was false or not\u201d].) It is well settled that courts will not decide constitutional questions when the issue can be decided on another ground. <em>(Palermo </em>v. <em>Stockton Theatres, Inc. </em>(1948) 32 Cal.2d 53, 66 [195 P.2d 1]; <em>Reed </em>v. <em>City and County of San Francisco </em>(1992) 10 Cal.App.4th 572, 575 [12 Cal.Rptr.2d 647].) Having resolved the issue on another ground, we also need not address Dvorak\u2019s argument that Matson fails to show a probability he can establish the alleged defamatory statements are false.</p>\n<p id=\"b234-4\">As to the invasion of privacy cause of action, the trial court correctly found Matson has not shown a probability that he will prevail against Dvorak based upon the public disclosure of information related to unpaid parking citations.</p>\n<p id=\"b234-5\">\u201cAs discerned from the decisions of our courts, the public disclosure tort contains the following elements: (1) public disclosure (2) of a private fact (3) which would be offensive and objectionable to the reasonable person and (4) which is not of legitimate public concern.\u201d <em>(Diaz </em>v. <em>Oakland Tribune, Inc., supra, </em>139 Cal.App.3d at p. 126.) Not only does Matson offer no evidence that Dvorak acted to disclose the alleged fact of Matson\u2019s outstanding traffic citations, but whether a candidate for public office has refused or neglected to pay fines against him is a legitimate issue of public concern. \u201cIn choosing those who are to govern them, the public must, of course, be afforded the opportunity of learning about any facet of a candidate\u2019s life that may relate to his fitness for office.\u201d <em>(Kapellas </em>v. <em>Kofman, supra, </em>1 Cal.3d at pp. 36-37 [sustaining demurrer on invasion of privacy claim by candidate\u2019s children following publication of information about their trouble with police]; see <em>Briscoe </em>v. <em>Reader\u2019s Digest Association, Inc. </em>(1971) 4 Cal.3d 529, 535 fn. 5 [93 Cal.Rptr. 866, 483 P.2d 34], [\u201c[a]lmost any truthful commentary on public officials or public affairs, no matter how serious the invasion of privacy, will be privileged\u201d]; <em>Stryker </em>v. <em>Republic Pictures Corp. </em>(1951) 108 Cal.App.2d 191, 194 [238 P.2d 670] [a \u201cpolitician[,] running for public office, in effect[,] offers his public and private life for perusal so far as it affects his bid for office\u201d].)</p>\n<p id=\"b234-8\">Because Matson is unable to establish that the subject of the campaign flyer is not of legitimate public concern, the trial court correctly found he is unlikely to prevail on his invasion of privacy claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b235-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"551\">*551</page-number>This conclusion makes it unnecessary for us to address the contention that Matson fails to show a probability he will prevail on the invasion of privacy claim because, as Dvorak asserts, the Matson\u2019s unpaid citations are a matter of public record and, hence, not a \u201cprivate fact.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b235-5\">II<footnotemark>*</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b235-6\">Disposition</p>\n<p id=\"b235-7\">The judgment is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b235-8\">Sims, Acting P.
