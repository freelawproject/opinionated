The sole issue in this certified appeal is whether the Appellate Court properly determined that the trial court\u2019s order was not a final judgment and, therefore, that it lacked jurisdiction over the appeal. We conclude that the Appellate Court properly dismissed the appeal, and, accordingly, we affirm the judgment of that court.</p>\n<p id=\"b46-10\">The record reveals the following undisputed facts and procedural history. In September, 2006, the state charged the defendant by information with possession of child pornography in the third degree in violation of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"29\">*29</page-number>General Statutes \u00a7 53a-196f.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Thereafter, in February, 2007, the defendant filed a motion requesting that the state be ordered to provide him with copies of all of the alleged pornographic materials seized from his home that formed the basis of his prosecution. The defendant claimed that such disclosure was necessary to allow his forensic experts to evaluate the evidence and to prepare a defense. At the hearing on the motion in April, 2007, the trial court questioned the defendant about whether such disclosure was prohibited by statute. The defendant acknowledged that there is a federal law that bars the disclosure of copies of child pornography to a federal criminal defendant; see 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3509 (m);<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> but argued that this law did not apply in a state criminal prosecution. Additionally, although he recognized that legislation patterned after the federal law <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"30\">*30</page-number>had been proposed and was pending in the General Assembly; see House Bill No. 7269, 2007 Sess. (H.B. 7269); the defendant argued that this bill, even if it were to be enacted into law, would not take effect until October, 2007. In response, the state argued that the court should view the federal law as persuasive authority and expressed the belief that the distribution of copies of child pornography to the defendant unnecessarily risked repeating the victimization of the children depicted in the alleged pornographic material.</p>\n<p id=\"b48-6\">The court took the matter under advisement and, thereafter, by order dated June 18, 2007, granted, with certain restrictions, the defendant\u2019s motion for disclosure, ordering the state to provide the defendant with copies of the alleged child pornography within forty-five days of its order (June 18 order). Those restrictions included that defense counsel be responsible for keeping and safeguarding the duplicated material, that the material be \u201csecured and inaccessible to anyone besides defense counsel,\u201d and that defense counsel \u201cmay allow experts to review said materials only in accordance with this order.\u201d<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b49-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"31\">*31</page-number>On or about June 22, 2007, the state moved for reconsideration of the June 18 order on the basis of the fact that H.B. 7269 had passed in the House of Representatives and the Senate on June 5 and 6, 2007, respectively, and currently was awaiting the governor\u2019s signature. The court held a hearing on the motion for reconsideration on July 23, 2007, by which time, as the state noted to the court, H.B. 7269 had been signed into law by the governor as part of No. 07-246 of the 2007 Public Acts<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> (P.A. 07-246), and was scheduled to take effect on Octo<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"32\">*32</page-number>ber 1, 2007. See General Statutes \u00a7 2-32 (\u201c[a]ll public acts, except when otherwise therein specified, shall take effect on the first day of October following the session of the General Assembly at which they are passed\u201d). Public Act 07-246, which ultimately was codified at General Statutes \u00a7 54-86m, provided in relevant part that \u201cany property or material that constitutes child pornography shall remain in the care, custody and control of the state\u201d and that \u201ca court shall deny any request by the defendant to copy, photograph, duplicate or otherwise reproduce any property or material that constitutes child pornography so long as the attorney for the state makes the property or material reasonably available to the defendant. . . .\u201d See footnote 4 of this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b50-6\">On the basis of the passage of P.A. 07-246, the state argued that \u201cit would be illegal\u201d for it to duplicate the alleged child pornography and provide it to defense counsel. The state reiterated its argument that the distribution of duplicated pornographic material to the defendant \u201cindirectly victimizfed] the victims again\u201d and was inconsistent with the state\u2019s policy not to \u201cturn over contraband to defendants ... or their experts . . . .\u201d The state further argued that, despite the best of intentions and motives of all concerned, the duplication and disclosure of the material posed a risk of unauthorized dissemination. The state urged that this risk could be avoided, while at the same time adequately securing the defendant\u2019s right to prepare a defense, by allowing the defendant and his expert full access to the material as it remained in the care, custody and control of the <em>state. </em>The defendant responded that compliance with the order was not unlawful because: (1) the June 18 order had been issued prior to the October 1, 2007 effective date of P.A. 07-246; and (2) the forty-five day deadline set by the court for compliance with its order, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"33\">*33</page-number>August 2, 2007, also would predate the effective date of the public act.</p>\n<p id=\"b51-6\">At the conclusion of the hearing, the court orally denied the state\u2019s motion for reconsideration, ruling that its June 18 order adequately protected against the risk of unauthorized redistribution of the duplicated material. Regarding P.A. 07-246, the court essentially agreed with the defendant\u2019s view that it was not applicable because this provision had been pending, but not enacted, at the time that the disclosure order was issued, and because the court\u2019s order called for disclosure to occur before the public act\u2019s effective date of October 1, 2007.</p>\n<p id=\"b51-7\">On July 30, 2007, the state sought permission to appeal from the trial court\u2019s June 18 order, as well as from the court\u2019s denial of its motion to reconsider that order in light of the passage of the public act. At a hearing on the matter, the defendant asserted that he had no objection to the state\u2019s motion, and the court thereafter granted the state permission to appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b51-8\">On June 4, 2008, the Appellate Court summoned the parties to appear before a motions calendar session of the court to explain why the state\u2019s appeal should not be dismissed for lack of a final judgment. Over the state\u2019s objection, the Appellate Court dismissed the state\u2019s appeal. Thereafter, this court granted the state\u2019s petition for certification, limited to the following issue: \u201cDid the Appellate Court properly dismiss the appeal of the [state] for lack of a final judgment?\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Fielding, </em>288 Conn. 916, 954 A.2d 186 (2008).</p>\n<p id=\"b51-9\">On appeal, the state claims that the Appellate Court improperly dismissed its appeal because the June 18 order is an appealable interlocutory order under <em>State </em>v. <em>Curcio, </em>191 Conn. 27, 31, 463 A.2d 566 (1983). In the alternative, the state asserts that its appeal should be <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"34\">*34</page-number>addressed pursuant to General Statutes \u00a7 52-265a<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> because this case involves a matter of substantial public interest. The defendant agrees that applying the trial court\u2019s order would destroy the state\u2019s claimed right under \u00a7 54-56m to maintain exclusive control over the materials. The defendant also approves the exercise of this court\u2019s jurisdiction pursuant to \u00a7 52-265a.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> We conclude that the discovery order in the present case is not a final judgment and, therefore, is not appealable <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"35\">*35</page-number>under General Statutes \u00a7 52-263. Because we also are not persuaded that we should treat the state\u2019s petition as a public interest appeal,<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> we affirm the judgment of dismissal.</p>\n<p id=\"b53-6\">\u201cWe begin by noting that the parties\u2019 agreement on the existence of a final judgment does not confer jurisdiction on this court. The lack of a final judgment implicates the subject matter jurisdiction of an appellate court to hear an appeal. . . . The appellate courts have a duty to dismiss, even on [their] own initiative, any appeal that [they lack] jurisdiction to hear. . . . Neither the parties nor the trial court . . . can confer jurisdiction upon [an appellate] court. . . . The right of appeal is accorded only if the conditions fixed by statute and the rules of court for taking and prosecuting the appeal are met.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"36\">*36</page-number><em>Brown &amp; Brown, Inc. </em>v. <em>Blumenthal, </em>288 Conn. 646, 654, 954 A.2d 816 (2008). \u201cIt is equally axiomatic that, except insofar as the legislature has specifically provided for an interlocutory appeal or other form of interlocutory appellate review . . . appellate jurisdiction is limited to final judgments of the trial court.

Ed. 2d 817 (1981) (colorable double jeopardy claim immediately appealable).\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Ayala, </em>222 Conn. 331, 339, 610 A.2d 1162 (1992).</p>\n<p id=\"b55-6\">We have recognized, however, in both criminal and civil cases, that certain otherwise interlocutory orders may be final judgments for appeal purposes, and \u201cthe courts may deem interlocutory orders or rulings to have the attributes of a final judgment if they fit within either of the two prongs of the test set forth in <em>State </em>v. <em>Curcio, </em>[supra, 191 Conn. 31].\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) BNY <em>Western Trust v. Roman, </em>295 Conn. 194, 202, 990 A.2d 853 (2010); see <em>State </em>v. <em>Jenkins, </em>288 Conn. 610, 618, 954 A.2d 806 (2008). Under <em>Curcio, </em>interlocutory orders are immediately appealable if the order or ruling (1) terminates a separate and distinct proceeding, or (2) so concludes the rights of the parties that further proceedings cannot affect them. <em>State </em>v. <em>Curcio, </em>supra, 31.</p>\n<p id=\"b55-9\">The state relies on the second prong of <em>Curcio. </em>\u201cThe second prong of the <em>Curcio </em>test focuses on the nature of the right involved. It requires the parties seeking to appeal to establish that the trial court\u2019s order threatens the preservation of a right already secured to them and that that right will be irretrievably lost and the [parties] irreparably harmed unless they may immediately appeal. . . . One must make at least a colorable claim that some recognized statutory or constitutional right is at risk.\u201d (Citation omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Chadha </em>v. <em>Charlotte Hungerford Hospital, </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"38\">*38</page-number>272 Conn. 776, 785-86, 865 A.2d 1163 (2005). Moreover, \u201cwhen a statute vests the trial court with discretion to determine if a particular [party] is to be accorded a certain status, the [party] may not invoke the rights that attend the status as a basis for claiming that the court\u2019s decision not to confer that status deprives the [party] of protections to which [it] is entitled. . . . The right itself must exist independently of the order from which the appeal is taken.\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Longo, </em>supra, 192 Conn. 92-93. \u201cUnless the appeal is authorized under the <em>Cur-do </em>criteria, absence of a final judgment is a jurisdictional defect that [necessarily] results in a dismissal of the appeal.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Malcolm, </em>257 Conn. 653, 667, 778 A.2d 134 (2001). We disagree that the June 18 order of disclosure satisfies this criteria.</p>\n<p id=\"b56-6\">Generally, \u201corders relating to discovery do not constitute a final judgment and are not appealable both because their initial determination does not so conclude the rights of the appealing party that further proceedings cannot affect those rights; <em>Chrysler Credit Corporation </em>v. <em>Fairfield Chrysler-Plymouth, Inc., </em>180 Conn. 223, 226, 429 A.2d 478 (1980); <em>State </em>v. <em>Kemp, </em>124 Conn. 639, 646-47, 1 A.2d 761 (1938); see also <em>State </em>v. <em>Asherman, </em>180 Conn. 141, 143, 429 A.2d 810 (1980); <em>E. J. Hansen Elevator, Inc. </em>v. <em>Stoll, </em>167 Conn. 623, 627, 356 A.2d 893 (1975); <em>Guerin </em>v. <em>Norton, </em>167 Conn. 282, 283, 355 A.2d 255 (1974); <em>Prevedini </em>v. <em>Mobil Oil Corporation, </em>164 Conn. 287, 291-93, 320 A.2d 797 (1973); and because . . . their import is fully apprehended only after trial is concluded.\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Grotton, </em>supra, 180 Conn. 292. Even when faced with an appeal from a trial court order to produce files protected by the attorney-client privilege within an insurance coverage dispute, this court found that the appellant insurer had failed to meet the second prong of <em>Curcio. </em>See <em>Melia </em>v. <em>Hartford Fire Ins. Co., </em>202 Conn. 252, 258, 520 A.2d 605 (1987) <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"39\">*39</page-number>(\u201c [o]ur concern for the efficient operation of the judicial system, which is the practical consideration behind the policy against piecemeal litigation inherent in the final judgment rule, has induced us to dismiss appeals where statutorily created rights of privacy, no less significant than the right of confidentiality for attorney-client communications, have been at stake\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b57-6\">Moreover, this court has rejected the rationale advanced by the state in this case that <em>Curdo </em>must be deemed to be satisfied simply because, once the materials at issue in this case are disclosed, the proverbial horse is out of the bam. \u201cIt is a given that, once disclosed through discovery, information cannot be retrieved. If that fact alone were sufficient to permit an immediate appeal of an order to comply with a discovery request or an order denying a protective order, every reluctant witness could delay trial court proceedings by taking an interlocutory appeal. That is not our law.\u201d <em>Presidential Capital Corp. </em>v. <em>Reale, </em>240 Conn. 623, 629-30, 692 A.2d 794 (1997). In an analogous content, we have recognized that privacy interests protected by the attorney-client privilege cannot be completely restored once they have been invaded by a disclosure order; <em>Melia </em>v. <em>Hartford Fire Ins. Co., </em>supra, 202 Conn. 257; and, even when \u201cthose accused of crimes have claimed entitlement to treatment as juveniles or youthful offenders, we have recognized that our decree after a successful appeal from a conviction cannot restore the protection the legislature intended against publicity and other consequences attending an adult criminal proceeding. <em>[In re Juvenile Appeal (85-AB), </em>supra, 195 Conn. 311]; <em>State </em>v. <em>Longo, </em>[supra, 192 Conn. 91]. We have concluded, nevertheless, that the harm caused by delay in the disposition of criminal cases likely to result from allowing interlocutory appeals where trial courts have denied youthful offender or juvenile treatment far outweighs the need to provide <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"40\">*40</page-number>additional appellate remedies to implement the legislative purpose more effectively.\u201d <em>Melia </em>v. <em>Hartford Fire Ins. Co., </em>supra, 258.</p>\n<p id=\"b58-6\">We explained in <em>State </em>v. <em>Alvarez, </em>257 Conn. 782, 796, 778 A.2d 938 (2001), that we have \u201cbeen disinclined ... to extend the privilege of an interlocutory appeal in criminal cases beyond the double jeopardy circumstance. This reluctance stems principally from our concern that to allow such appeals would greatly delay the orderly progress of criminal prosecutions in the trial court .... [T]he opportunity to appeal in such a situation might well serve the purpose of parties who desire for their own ends to postpone the final determination of the issues. ... It has been widely recognized that strict adherence to the final judgment rule is necessary in criminal cases because the delays and disruptions attendant upon intermediate appeal are especially inimical to the effective and fair administration of the criminal law.\u201d (Citation omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.)</p>\n<p id=\"b58-7\">Despite this settled law, the state contends that its appeal satisfies the second prong of <em>Curcio </em>\u201cbecause the June 18 order so concludes the discovery rights of the parties as they relate to the material constituting child pornography that, except for an interlocutory appeal, further proceedings cannot affect them.\u201d Integral to its claim that \u00a7 54-86m provides it with a statutory privilege to retain exclusive care, custody and control of material constituting child pornography, so long as it makes such material reasonably available to the defendant, is the state\u2019s contention that \u00a7 54-86m controls this case, regardless of its effective date of October 1, 2007. Specifically, the state contends that \u00a7 54-86m controls because either: (1) actual compliance with the discovery order will not take place until after the statute has taken effect; or (2) even if the controlling date is the one on which the order entered, June 18, 2007, the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"41\">*41</page-number>statute is procedural and therefore applies retroactively to existing discovery orders that were still pending on the date it became effective. See <em>State </em>v. <em>Skakel, </em>276 Conn. 633, 680-81, 888 A.2d 985 (The court noted the presumption that \u201cprocedural or remedial statutes are intended to apply retroactively absent a clear expression of legislative intent to the contrary .... While there is no precise definition of either [substantive or procedural law], it is generally agreed that a substantive law creates, defines and regulates rights while a procedural law prescribes the methods of enforcing such rights or obtaining redress.\u201d [Citations omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.]), cert. denied, 549 U.S. 1030, 127 S. Ct. 578, 166 L. Ed. 2d 428 (2006). The state posits that \u201c[t]he . . . practical value of this statutory privilege would be destroyed if not vindicated before trial \u201d<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b59-7\">There is one fundamental problem with the state\u2019s claim. As we previously have stated in this opinion, for an appellate court to have jurisdiction over the interlocutoiy ruling at issue, the state must show that the decision threatens to abrogate, or threatens the preservation of, a right that it <em>already </em>holds. \u201c[T]he claimed right . . . must exist independently of the order from which the appeal is taken.\u201d (Citation omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Hartford Accident &amp; Indemnity Co. </em>v. <em>Ace American Reinsurance Co., </em>279 Conn. 220, 231, 901 A.2d 1164 (2006). The finality of the judgment cannot depend on the appellant\u2019s ability to prevail on the merits of its appeal. See <em>Rosado </em>v. <em>Bridgeport Roman Catholic Diocesan Corp., </em>276 Conn. 168, 194, 884 A.2d 981 (2005) (\u201cwe must always <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"42\">*42</page-number>determine the threshold question of whether the appeal is taken from a final judgment <em>before considering the merits of the claim\u201d </em>[emphasis added; internal quotation marks omitted]); <em>State </em>v. <em>O\u2019Connell, </em>36 Conn. App. 135, 136, 648 A.2d 168 (1994) (\u201c[a]bsent a final judgment, we cannot reach the merits of the appeal\u201d), cert. denied, 231 Conn. 943, 653 A.2d 824 (1994). The state\u2019s right to maintain exclusive custody over the materials subject to the court\u2019s order and its claim that that order causes the state to violate the statute\u2019s mandate, however, depend entirely on the state prevailing on the claim that it raises in this appeal, namely, that \u00a7 54-86m applies to the present case. Therefore, the state\u2019s right to possess exclusively the subject materials and preserve them from being reproduced does not exist independently of \u00a7 54-86m. Rather, the state\u2019s claim of a \u201cright already secured\u201d; <em>BNY Western Trust </em>v. <em>Roman, </em>supra, 295 Conn. 203; that it asserts is being threatened by the trial court\u2019s decision in the present case is predicated on a statute whose claimed application is disputed and is at the heart of the current controversy. This court squarely has rejected a purported secured right on the basis of the same logic that the state now advances. See <em>Massachusetts Mutual Life Ins. Co. </em>v. <em>Blumenthal, </em>281 Conn. 805, 813, 917 A.2d 951 (2007) (\u201cThe plaintiff asserts that it has the right, pursuant to [General Statutes] \u00a7 35-42 [c] [of the Connecticut Antitrust Act], to have the investigative reports remain confidential. The defendant had determined, however, that the reports were not exempt from disclosure pursuant to [General Statutes] \u00a7 1-210 [a] of the [Freedom of Information Act]. Thus, the question of whether the plaintiff was entitled to have the reports remain confidential was the subject of the present action, the very issue that the plaintiff sought to have the court determine. The plaintiff has not, therefore, satisfied its appellate burden of showing that the right to confidentiality in the reports <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"43\">*43</page-number>is one that it already has.\u201d). Accordingly, we cannot conclude that the trial court\u2019s order threatened the preservation of a right <em>already secured </em>by the state and that exists independently of the order rejecting the statute\u2019s application from which the appeal has been taken.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b61-6\">The judgment of the Appellate Court is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b61-7\">In this opinion the other justices concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b47-6\"> General Statutes \u00a7 53a-196f (a) provides: \u201cA person is guilty of possessing child pornography in the third degree when such person knowingly possesses fewer than twenty visual depictions of child pornography.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b47-7\"> Title 18 of the United States Code, \u00a7 3509 (m) provides: \u201cProhibition on Reproduction of Child Pornography.\u2014</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b47-8\">\u201c(1) In any criminal proceeding, any property or material that constitutes child pornography (as defined by section 2256 of this title) shall remain in the care, custody, and control of either the Government or the court.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b47-9\">\u201c(2) (A) Notwithstanding Rule 16 of the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure, a court shall deny, in any criminal proceeding, any request by the defendant to copy, photograph, duplicate, or otherwise reproduce any property or material that constitutes child pornography (as defined by section 2256 of this title), so long as the Government makes the property or material reasonably available to the defendant.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b47-10\">\u201c(B) For the purposes of subparagraph (A), property or material shall be deemed to be reasonably available to the defendant if the Government provides ample opportunity for inspection, viewing, and examination at a Government facility of the property or material by the defendant, his or her attorney, and any individual the defendant may seek to qualify to furnish expert testimony at trial.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b47-11\">This provision was \u00a7 504 of a federal act entitled the Adam Walsh Child Protection and Safety Act of 2006, Pub.

Specifically, the defendant had filed an appeal from the June 18 order challenging some of the restrictions that the trial court had placed on disclosure; see footnote 3 of this opinion; which the Appellate Court also dismissed pursuant to a motion by the state. In his brief to this court, the defendant has requested reinstatement of that appeal and maintains that this court has jurisdiction to consider both the state\u2019s appeal as well as his own. Because the defendant did not seek certification to appeal from the Appellate Court\u2019s dismissal of his appeal and resolution of his claim is not intertwined with the state\u2019s certified issue, we decline to consider this issue. See <em>Weems </em>v. <em>Citigroup, Inc., </em>289 Conn. 769, 783 n.15, 961 A.2d 349 (2008) (declining to address issue outside scope of certified question); <em>State </em>v. <em>Nguyen, </em>253 Conn. 639, 648-49 n.6, 756 A.2d 833 (2000) (addressing issues not raised in certified appeal when issues integral to resolution of certified issue).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b53-7\"> The state asserts that, if this court determines that the trial court\u2019s ruling is not immediately appealable under <em>State </em>v. <em>Curcio, </em>supra, 191 Conn. 27, we may treat its petition for certification to appeal as a late petition for review under \u00a7 52-265a. It asserts that the trial court\u2019s order involves a matter of substantial public interest, namely, the proper balance between the state\u2019s ability to retain exclusive care, custody and control over contraband and the defendant\u2019s constitutional rights to present a defense and to confront his accusers. For the following reasons, the chief justice disagrees that the issues raised in this appeal meet the requirement of \u00a7 52-265a.</p>\n<p id=\"b53-8\">\u201cSection 52-265a allows the chief justice to certify a direct appeal to the Supreme Court from an interlocutory order of the Superior Court on an issue of law that involves a matter of substantial public interest and in which delay may work a substantial injustice.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Kemah, </em>289 Conn. 411, 414 n.2, 957 A.2d 852 (2008). Although the state frames the public interest broadly, the specific issue in the present case potentially will affect only the parties in the present case. Specifically, the state\u2019s appeal depends on whether \u00a7 54-86m applies retroactively to the June 18 order because that order and its deadline for the state\u2019s disclosure predate the statute\u2019s effective date. Because the statute now is in effect, however, there is no compelling need for the court to weigh in on the merits of that issue. Additionally, it appears that the protections put in place by the trial court in the present case sufficiently ensure that the materials at issue will be protected in accordance with the state\u2019s valid concerns. See footnote 3 of this opinion. Accordingly, this case does not present the substantial public interest at which \u00a7 52-265a is directed.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b54-7\"> General Statutes \u00a7 52-263 provides: \u201cUpon the trial of all matters of fact in any cause or action in the Superior Court, whether to the court or jury, or before any judge thereof when the jurisdiction of any action or proceeding is vested in him, if either party is aggrieved by the decision of the court or judge upon any question or questions of law arising in the trial, including the denial of a motion to set aside a verdict, he may appeal to the court having jurisdiction from the final judgment of the court or of such judge, or from the decision of the court granting a motion to set aside a verdict, except in small claims cases, which shall not be appealable, and appeals as provided in sections 8-8 and 8-9.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"9\">\n<p id=\"b59-8\"> Although the state also points to the policies underlying the federal act on which \u00a7 54-86m was <em>modeled; see </em>footnote 2 of this opinion; the risk that compliance with the order will repeat the victimization of children, and the fact that child pornography is contraband, the state does not contend that those considerations, although not insignificant, give rise to <em>a right </em>already secured to it.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"10\">\n<p id=\"AL5\"> We recognize that the state may not have an opportunity to vindicate its interests should the defendant be acquitted, but, as we have stated repeatedly herein, the second prong of <em>Gurdo </em>requires that the trial court\u2019s order threaten the preservation of a <em>right </em>already secured and only then do we examine whether that <em>right </em>will be irretrievably lost and the party irreparably harmed unless it may immediately appeal. Because we have concluded that no such right is at issue, a lost opportunity to litigate the claim is not sufficient to overcome the policy against piecemeal litigation inherent in the final judgment rule.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
