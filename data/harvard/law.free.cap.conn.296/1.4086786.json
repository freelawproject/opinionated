The plaintiff, Nilsa Rodriguez, claims that the trial court improperly granted the summary judgment motion of the defendant Daimler Chrysler Financial Service America Trust (Daimler Chrysler) because the Amendment does not preempt General Statutes \u00a7 14-154a<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> under the circumstances of this case. The plaintiff also claims that the Amendment is an unconstitutional exercise of Congressional power under the commerce clause of the United States constitution. See U.S. Const., art. I, \u00a7 8, cl. 3. Daimler Chrysler responds that the trial court properly granted its summary judgment motion because the Amendment is constitutional and a lessor\u2019s failure to insure a vehicle in accordance with \u00a7 14-154a (b) (1) does not trigger the Amendment\u2019s savings clause, which excludes from preemption state laws imposing liability on lessors for, inter alia, failure to meet \u201cfinancial responsibility or liability insurance requirements . . . .\u201d49 U.S.C. \u00a7 30106 (b) (2) (2006).<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> We agree with Daimler Chrysler <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"5\">*5</page-number>that the Amendment preempts \u00a7 14-154a under the facts of this case and that the Amendment is constitutional. Accordingly, we affirm the judgment of the trial court.</p>\n<p id=\"b23-6\">The following undisputed facts<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> and procedural history are relevant to our resolution of this appeal. On July 9,2006, the plaintiff was involved in a motor vehicle accident in which a vehicle operated by the named defendant, Mark J. Testa, struck her vehicle. Testa\u2019s company, Bright Lighting, Inc., had leased the vehicle from Daimler Chrysler for a term of thirty-nine months, but the vehicle was not insured by Daimler Chrysler at the time of the accident.</p>\n<p id=\"b23-7\">Thereafter, the plaintiff commenced this action against Testa, Daimler Chrysler and three other defendants.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> In her amended complaint, the plaintiff alleged in part that Daimler Chrysler, as owner and lessor of the vehicle, was liable for Testa\u2019s negligent operation of the vehicle under the theory of vicarious liability set forth in \u00a7 14-154a. Daimler Chrysler filed a motion for summary judgment, arguing that the state law was preempted by the Graves Amendment, and the trial court granted the motion. Relying in part on <em>Farmers Texas County Mutual </em>v. <em>Hertz Corp., </em>282 Conn. 535, 543-44 n.9, 923 A.2d 673 (2007), and <em>Moncrease </em>v. <em>Chase Manhattan Auto Finance Corp., </em>98 Conn. App. 665, 668 n.1, 911 A.2d 315 (2006), the court concluded that \u201c[t]he law on the question of the effect of [the Amendment] is well settled. Connecticut can no longer impose vicarious liability on the owner of a rented or leased vehicle.\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"6\">*6</page-number>(Internal quotation marks omitted.) The court further concluded that the Amendment was constitutional, as there was \u201ca clear, self-evident relation between interstate commerce and the leasing of motor vehicles.\u201d The court thus determined that, because there was no genuine issue of material fact and the plaintiff did not allege negligence or criminal wrongdoing on the part of Daimler Chrysler to bring her claim outside the scope of the Amendment; see 49 U.S.C. \u00a7 30106 (a) (2) (2006); Daimler Chrysler had met its burden of establishing that it was entitled to judgment as a matter of law.</p>\n<p id=\"b24-6\">On January 9, 2009, the plaintiff filed a motion for articulation of the trial court\u2019s ruling. In its response, the court explained that examples of negligence or criminal wrongdoing that would establish Daimler Chrysler\u2019s liability under state law would be the leasing of a vehicle \u201cwith bald tires, faulty brakes, a sticky gas pedal or any other known mechanical [defect]\u201d that was \u201cthe proximate cause of the accident.\u201d The court further explained that, because \u201cleased vehicles may be driven across state lines,\u201d Congress has authority under the commerce clause of the United States constitution to adopt laws regulating such vehicles. This appeal followed.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b24-7\">We begin with the applicable standard of review. \u201cPractice Book \u00a7 17-49 provides that summary judgment shall be rendered forthwith if the pleadings, affidavits and any other proof submitted show that there is no genuine issue as to any material fact and that the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law. In deciding a motion for summary judgment, the trial court must view the evidence in the light most favorable to the nonmoving party. . . . The party moving for <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"7\">*7</page-number>summary judgment has the burden of showing the absence of any genuine issue of material fact and that the party is, therefore, entitled to judgment as a matter of law. . . . Our review of the trial court\u2019s decision to grant [Daimler Chrysler\u2019s] motion for summary judgment is plenary.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Bellemare </em>v. <em>Wachovia Mortgage </em>Corp., 284 Conn. 193, 198-99, 931 A.2d 916 (2007). Issues of statutory construction and constitutional interpretation are also matters of law subject to our plenary review. See, e.g., <em>Honulik </em>v. <em>Greenwich, </em>293 Conn. 641, 668, 980 A.2d 845 (2009) <em>(Katz, J., </em>dissenting) (constitutional interpretation); <em>Fairchild Heights, Inc. </em>v. <em>Amaro, </em>293 Conn. 1, 8, 976 A.2d 668 (2009) (statutory construction).</p>\n<p id=\"b25-6\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b25-7\">The plaintiff first claims that the trial court improperly granted Daimler Chrysler\u2019s summary judgment motion because the Graves Amendment does not preempt her state law claim. The plaintiff contends that the two cases on which the trial court relied did not address the preemptive scope of the Amendment in relation to Connecticut law. She also contends that the trial court improperly construed the Amendment\u2019s savings clause, which excludes from preemption those state laws that impose liability on motor vehicle lessors for failure to comply with state financial responsibility or liability insurance requirements. The plaintiff claims that \u00a7 14-154a (b) (1) is such a law because it provides that a long-term lessor<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> that obtains bodily injury liability insurance of not less than $100,000 per person and $300,000 per occurrence may avoid vicarious liability for the lessee\u2019s negligent conduct, thus encouraging such lessors to provide the specified coverage for their vehicles. Daimler Chrysler replies that the trial court <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"8\">*8</page-number>properly granted its summary judgment motion because \u00a7 14-154a is not the type of financial responsibility or liability insurance law that qualifies for exemption from preemption under the savings clause. We agree with Daimler Chrysler.</p>\n<p id=\"b26-6\">\u201cThe question of preemption is one of federal law, arising under the supremacy clause of the United States constitution.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Hackett </em>v. <em>J.L.G. Properties, LLC, </em>285 Conn. 498, 504, 940 A.2d 769 (2008). The supremacy clause of the United States constitution provides in relevant part: \u201cThis Constitution, and the Laws of the United States which shall be made in Pursuance thereof . . . shall be the supreme Law of the Land; and the Judges in every State shall be bound thereby, any Thing in the Constitution or Laws of any State to the Contrary notwithstanding.\u201d U.S. Const., art. VI, cl. 2. \u201c[S]tate law is pre-empted under the [sjupremacy [cjlause ... in three circumstances. First, Congress can define explicitly the extent to which its enactments pre-empt state law. . . . Preemption fundamentally is a question of congressional intent . . . and when Congress has made its intent known through explicit statutory language, the courts\u2019 task is an easy one.</p>\n<p id=\"b26-7\">\u201cSecond, in the absence of explicit statutory language, state law is pre-empted where it regulates conduct in a field that Congress intended the [fjederal [gjovefnment to occupy exclusively. Such an intent may be inferred from a scheme of federal regulation . . . so pervasive as to make reasonable the inference that Congress left no room for the [sjtates to supplement it, or where an [a]ct of Congress touch[es] a field in which the federal interest is so dominant that the federal system will be assumed to preclude enforcement of state laws on the same subject. . . . Where . . . the field which Congress is said to have pre-empted includes areas that have been traditionally occupied by <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"9\">*9</page-number>the [s]tates, congressional intent to supersede state laws must be clear and manifest. . . .</p>\n<p id=\"b27-6\">\u201cFinally, state law is pre-empted to the extent that it actually conflicts with federal law. Thus, the [c]ourt has found pre-emption where it is impossible for a private party to comply with both state and federal requirements ... or where state law stands as an obstacle to the accomplishment and execution of the full purposes and objectives of Congress.\u201d (Citations omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>English </em>v. <em>General Electric Co., </em>496 U.S. 72, 78-79, 110 S. Ct. 2270, 110 L. Ed. 2d 65 (1990); see also <em>Hackett </em>v. <em>J.L.G. Properties, LLC, </em>supra, 285 Conn. 504.</p>\n<p id=\"b27-7\">The Graves Amendment was enacted by Congress on August 10, 2005,<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> as part of a comprehensive transportation bill entitled the Safe, Accountable, Flexible, Efficient Transportation Equity Act: A Legacy for Users (act), Pub. L. No. 109-59, 119 Stat. 1144 (2005). \u201cThe [a]ct deals generally with motor vehicle safety, primarily providing billions of dollars in funding allocations for transportation projects.\u201d <em>Meyer </em>v. <em>Nwokedi, </em>777 N. W.2d 218, 222 (Minn. 2010). The Amendment was included in the act as a tort reform measure intended to bar recovery against car rental and leasing companies on the basis of vicarious liability. See, e.g., <em>Garcia </em>v. <em>Vanguard Car Rental USA, Inc., </em>540 F.3d 1242, 1244 (11th Cir. 2008), cert. denied, 555 U.S. 1174, 129 S. Ct. 1369, 173 L. Ed. 2d 591 (2009); <em>Green </em>v. <em>Toyota Motor CreditCorp, </em>605 F. Sup. 2d 430, 434 (E.D.N.Y. 2009). The Amendment contains a preemption clause and two savings provisions. The preemption clause in subsection <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"10\">*10</page-number>(a) provides in relevant part: \u201cAn owner of a motor vehicle that rents or leases the vehicle to a person . . . shall not be liable under the law of any State ... by reason of being the owner of the vehicle . . . for harm to persons or property that results or arises out of the use, operation, or possession of the vehicle during the period of the rental or lease, if\u2014</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b28-6\">\u201c(1) the owner ... is engaged in the trade or business of renting or leasing motor vehicles; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b28-7\">\u201c(2) there is no negligence or criminal wrongdoing on the part of the owner . . . .\u201d 49 U.S.C. \u00a7 30106 (a) (2006).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b28-8\">The savings provisions in subsection (b) provide in relevant part: \u201cNothing in this section supersedes the law of any State ...</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b28-9\">\u201c(1) imposing financial responsibility or insurance standards on the owner of a motor vehicle for the privilege of registering and operating a motor vehicle; or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b28-10\">\u201c(2) imposing liability on business entities engaged in the trade or business of renting or leasing motor vehicles for failure to meet the financial responsibility or liability insurance requirements under State law.\u201d 49 U.S.C. \u00a7 30106 (b) (2006).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b28-11\">The parties do not dispute that Daimler Chrysler is engaged in the trade or business of leasing motor vehicles, is the owner of the vehicle involved in the accident, is not subject to allegations of negligence or criminal wrongdoing, and that the leased vehicle was uninsured. Rather, they dispute whether Daimler Chrysler is vicariously hable under \u00a7 14-154a because it constitutes the type of \u201cfinancial responsibility or liability insurance [requirement]\u201d that the savings clause was intended to exclude from preemption. Thus, our first task is to determine the meaning of the phrase \u201cfinancial respon<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"11\">*11</page-number>sibility or liability insurance requirements,\u201d as that phrase is used in the savings clause.</p>\n<p id=\"b29-6\">\u201cWith respect to the construction and application of federal statutes, principles of comity and consistency require us to follow the plain meaning rule . . . because that is the rule of construction utilized by the United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit. . . . Moreover, it is well settled that [t]he decisions of the Second Circuit Court of Appeals carry particularly persuasive weight in the interpretation of federal statutes by Connecticut state courts. . . . Accordingly, our analysis of the pertinent federal [provision] begins with the plain meaning of the statute. <em>United States </em>v. <em>Ripa, </em>323 F.3d 73, 81 (2d Cir. 2003); [see also] <em>In re Caldor Corp., </em>303 F.3d 161, 167-68 (2d Cir. 2002) ([a]s long as the statutory scheme is coherent and consistent, there generally is no need for a court to inquire beyond the plain language of the statute . . .). If the meaning of the text is not plain, however, we must look to the statute as a whole and construct an interpretation that comports with its primary purpose and does not lead to anomalous or unreasonable results.\u201d (Citation omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Dark-Eyes </em>v. <em>Commissioner of Revenue Services, </em>276 Conn. 559, 571, 887 A.2d 848, cert. denied, 549 U.S. 815, 127 S. Ct. 347, 166 L. Ed. 2d 26 (2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b29-8\">Because there is no Second Circuit decision interpreting the savings clause, we tmn to <em>Garcia </em>v. <em>Vanguard Car Rental USA, Inc., </em>supra, 540 F.3d 1242, an Eleventh Circuit decision, for guidance. In that case, the court examined the language in the savings clause, the terms of which are not defined elsewhere in the act, and concluded that Congress had \u201cused the term \u2018financial responsibility law[s]\u2019 to denote state laws which impose insurance-like requirements on owners or operators of motor vehicles . . . but permit them to carry, in lieu of liability insurance per se, its financial equivalent, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"12\">*12</page-number>such as a bond or self-insurance.\u201d Id., 1247. The court reasoned, under the principle of noscitur a sociis,<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> that the statutory context strongly implied that financial responsibility is closely linked to insurance requirements because both savings provisions, namely, 49 U.S.C. \u00a7 30106 (b) (1), which exempts from preemption laws \u201cimposing financial responsibility or insurance standards,\u201d and 49 U.S.C. \u00a7 30106 (b) (2), which exempts from preemption laws penalizing the \u201cfailure to meet the financial responsibility or liability insurance requirements under State law,\u201d strongly imply that \u201cfinancial responsibility is closely linked to insurance requirements.\u201d <em>Garcia </em>v. <em>Vanguard Car Rental USA, Inc., </em>supra, 1247. The court further observed that \u201cthe most common legal usage of the term \u2018financial responsibility\u2019 is [in reference] to state laws which require either liability insurance or a functionally equivalent financial arrangement. . . . Likewise, Black\u2019s Law Dictionary defines financial responsibility only to include requirements that motorists have proof of \u2018insurance or other financial accountability.\u2019 \u201d <em>Garcia </em>v. <em>Vanguard Car Rental USA, Inc., </em>supra, 1247-48, quoting Black\u2019s Law Dictionary (8th Ed. 2004). The court also noted that an insurance treatise on which the plaintiffs in that case relied not only suggested a meaning similar to that in Black\u2019s Law Dictionary, but indicated that \u201cfinancial responsibility\u201d laws \u201cmay be used to refer to statutes which suspend a motorist\u2019s license or vehicle registration if [the motorist] fail[s] to satisfy a judgment resulting from an accident.\u201d <em>Garcia </em>v. <em>Vanguard Car Rental USA, Inc., </em>supra, 1248, citing 7AG. Couch, Insurance (3d Ed. Rev. 2005) \u00a7 109:34, p. 109-46. The court thus concluded that \u201cthe import of the Graves Amendment is clear. States may require insurance or its equivalent as a condition of licensing or registration, or may <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"13\">*13</page-number>impose such a requirement after an accident or unpaid judgment. 49 U.S.C. \u00a7 30106 (b) (1) [2006], They may suspend the license and registration of, or otherwise penalize, a car owner who fails to meet the requirement, or who fails to pay a judgment resulting from a collision.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> 49 U.S.C. \u00a7 30106 (b) (2) [2006]. They simply may not impose such judgments against rental car [or leasing] companies based on the negligence of their lessees. 49 U.S.C. \u00a7 30106 (a) [2006].\u201d <em>Garcia </em>v. <em>Vanguard Car Rental USA, Inc., </em>supra, 1249.</p>\n<p id=\"b31-6\">To our knowledge, no other federal court has considered the meaning of the term \u201cfinancial responsibility\u201d laws, as that term is used in the savings clause. Courts in at least two other states have done so, however, and have relied on <em>Garcia </em>in concluding that \u201cfinancial responsibility\u201d laws are laws that impose insurance like requirements on the owners of motor vehicles. <em>Meyer </em>v. <em>Nwokedi, </em>supra, 777 N.W.2d 224 (adopting <em>Garcia </em>analysis and adding that \u201cthe phrase \u2018financial responsibility\u2019 appears to modify the word \u2018requirements]\u2019 in the . . . savings clause, thereby supporting the conclusion that \u2018financial responsibility\u2019 refers to insurance-like requirements\u201d); see also <em>West v. Enterprise Leasing Co., </em>997 So. 2d 1196, 1197-98 (Fla. App. 2008) (adopting <em>Garcia </em>analysis); <em>Vargas </em>v. <em>Enterprise Leasing Co., </em>993 So. 2d 614, 621 (Fla. App. 2008) (concluding that term <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"14\">*14</page-number>\u201cfinancial responsibility,\u201d as used in Amendment\u2019s savings clause, \u201cdenotefs] a minimum level of compulsory [automobile] insurance [coverage] or its equivalent\u201d). We agree with the well reasoned analysis in <em>Garcia </em>and with that court\u2019s conclusion that the \u201cfinancial responsibility or liability insurance requirements\u201d to which the savings clause refers consist of insurance like requirements imposed on business entities engaged in the trade or business of renting or leasing motor vehicles. See <em>Garcia </em>v. <em>Vanguard Car Rental USA, Inc., </em>supra, 540 F.3d 1247. Accordingly, we likewise conclude that the savings clause preserves those state statutes that impose liability on a lessor for failure to satisfy such requirements.</p>\n<p id=\"b32-6\">Our next task is to determine what kind of state insurance like requirements satisfies the definition of a financial responsibility law and thus falls within the scope of the savings clause. Two recent cases from other jurisdictions are instructive on this issue. In <em>Garcia, </em>the plaintiffs had argued that the disputed Florida law was a financial responsibility law that fell within the savings clause because the law \u201cinducefd]\u201d car rental companies to ensure that their lessees were adequately insured. Id., 1248. The court initially observed that the Florida statute<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> accomplished its purpose of reducing <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"15\">*15</page-number>a lessor\u2019s exposure to liability if the lessee complied with certain requirements for liability insurance. Id. The court, however, rejected the plaintiffs\u2019 argument, explaining that \u201cnot every inducement to lease only to the insured thereby becomes a financial responsibility law. . . . [Financial responsibility laws are <em>legal requirements, </em>not mere financial inducements imposed by law. Moreover, the inducement [that the plaintiffs relied] upon is . . . premised upon the very vicarious liability [that] the . . . Graves Amendment seeks to eliminate.\u201d (Emphasis added.) Id.</p>\n<p id=\"b33-6\">Even more recently, in <em>Meyer </em>v. <em>Nwokedi, </em>supra, 777 N.W.2d 218, the Supreme Court of Minnesota considered whether a Minnesota statute<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> fell within the savings clause because the statute limited liability for car rental companies that had obtained insurance coverage in excess of the minimum amount required of all vehicle owners under state law. Id., 223-24. Like the court in <em>Garcia, </em>the Minnesota court determined that the state law did not impose liability for failure to meet insurance like requirements or liability insurance requirements for two reasons. Id., 225-26. First, the legislature used \u201c \u2018if . . . then . . .\u2019 language\u201d providing that, \u201cif\u2019 the owner has a certain amount of coverage, \u201cthen\u201d the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"16\">*16</page-number>owner will not be vicariously liable beyond a certain limit. Id., 225. In other words, nothing in the statute <em>requires </em>rental vehicle owners to maintain insurance in the designated amount. See id. Second, the last portion of the statute provides that nothing in the statute changes the obligation of rental vehicle owners to comply with the requirements of compulsory insurance, which would be rendered superfluous if the first portion of the statute was construed to be a requirement. Id. The court thus read the Minnesota statute as \u201callowing insurers to provide extra coverage regardless of <em>any </em>provisions that impose minimum coverage requirements.\u201d (Emphasis in original.) Id., 226.</p>\n<p id=\"b34-6\">The Connecticut statute at issue in the present case provides in relevant part: \u201cAny person renting or leasing to another any motor vehicle owned by him shall be hable for any damage to any person or property caused by the operation of such motor vehicle while so rented or leased, to the same extent as the operator would have been liable if he had also been the owner.\u201d General Statutes \u00a7 14-154a (a). Such an owner may be shielded from vicarious liability under \u00a7 14-154a (b) (1), however, \u201cif the total lease term is for one year or more and if, at the time damages are incurred, the leased vehicle is insured for bodily injury liability in amounts of not less than one hundred thousand dollars per person and three hundred thousand dohaxs per occurrence . . . .\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b34-7\">The plaintiff claims that \u00a7 14-154a falls within the savings clause because the statute imposes liability on long-term lessors that fail to carry the bodily injury insurance coverage specified by the statute at the time of the accident. Daimler Chrysler disagrees on the ground that the statute does not create an affirmative duty to obtain such coverage. We find the analyses in <em>Garcia </em>and <em>Meyer </em>persuasive and conclude for similar reasons that the state provision in the present case does <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"17\">*17</page-number>not fall within the savings clause<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> because the statute uses the same conditional language used in the Florida and Minnesota statutes. See footnotes 12 and 13 of this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b35-6\">The Connecticut statute specifically provides in subsection (b) (1) that, \u201cif\u2019 the leased or rented vehicle is insured for a certain amount, the provisions of subsection (a) subjecting the owner to vicarious liability will not apply. See General Statutes \u00a7 14-154a (b) (1). This is the same kind of inducement language that was found in <em>Garcia </em>to fall short of the legal requirement necessary to come within the savings clause. \u201cA policy is a voluntary policy . . . when, in fact, the procurement of the policy is not required by [law].\u201d 7A G. Couch, supra, \u00a7 109:70, p. 109-101. The interpretation that the plaintiff advances would require the court to \u201csuppl[y] language that the legislature did not use, such as \u2018shall have\u2019 or \u2018requirement.\u2019 \u201d <em>Meyer </em>v. <em>Nwokedi, </em>supra, 777 N.W.2d 225. \u201cWhen statutory language is clear and unambiguous we must presume that it meant what it said.\u201d <em>Trankovich </em>v. <em>Frenish, Inc., </em>47 Conn. App. 628, 631, 706 A.2d 998 (1998). \u201cIt is well settled that a statute must be applied as its words direct.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>All Brand Importers, Inc. </em>v. <em>Dept. of Liquor Control, </em>213 Conn. 184, 194, 567 A.2d 1156 (1989). Accordingly, lack of the word \u201cshall\u201d and use of the word \u201cif\u2019 in subsection (b) (1) renders that provision conditional rather than mandatory.</p>\n<p id=\"b36-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"18\">*18</page-number>To the extent the plaintiff claims that \u00a7 14-154a is an integral part of Connecticut\u2019s comprehensive motor vehicle law imposing on owners a responsibility for maintaining insurance on their vehicles because subsection (b) (1) purportedly <em>requires </em>lessors to obtain the insurance coverage specified in the statute to avoid vicarious liability, the plaintiff misunderstands that the conditional language in that provision does not impose a legal requirement because it does not <em>mandate </em>that lessors procure such coverage as a prerequisite to conducting business. It merely gives them the <em>option </em>to do so. Thus, a lessor is not in violation of the law if it chooses not to obtain the specified coverage. The difference between the legal effect of the if-then language in subsection (b) (1) and the mandatory language in other portions of the statutory scheme is striking when the statute is compared with statutory provisions that do impose insurance requirements on the owners or operators of motor vehicles. See, e.g., General Statutes \u00a7 14-112 (a) (\u201c[t]o entitle any person to receive or retain a motor vehicle operator\u2019s license or a certificate of registration of any motor vehicle . . . the commissioner <em>shall require </em>from such person proof of financial responsibility to satisfy any claim for damages by reason of personal injury to, or the death of, any one person, of twenty thousand dollars, or by reason of personal injury to, or the death of, more than one person on account of any accident, of at least forty thousand dollars, and for damage to property of at least ten thousand dollars\u201d [emphasis added]); General Statutes \u00a7 38a-371 (a) (1) (\u201c[t]he owner of a private passenger motor vehicle required to be registered in this state <em>shall provide and continuously maintain </em>throughout the registration period security in accordance with sections 38a-334 to 38a-343, inclusive\u201d [emphasis added]).</p>\n<p id=\"b36-6\">The plaintiff, citing <em>Universal Underwriters Ins. Co. </em>v. <em>Paradis, </em>50 Conn. Sup. 486, 500, 940 A.2d 918 (2006), <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"19\">*19</page-number>affd, 285 Conn. 342, 940 A.2d 730 (2008), also claims that the Graves Amendment preserves the state vicarious liability law embodied in \u00a7 14-154a because the financial responsibility laws to which the savings clause refers include laws that require the procurement of insurance policies in the \u201cminimum amounts specified by statute.\u201d According to the plaintiff, these policies must be different from those required for the registration and operation of motor vehicles because the qualifying language in the savings provision of 49 U.S.C. \u00a7 30106 (b) (1), which refers to laws \u201cimposing financial responsibility or insurance standards . . . for the privilege of registering and operating a motor vehicle,\u201d is absent from the savings provision of 49 U.S.C. \u00a7 30106 (b) (2), which does not refer to laws concerning the registration or operation of motor vehicles but to laws imposing liability \u201cfor failure to meet the financial responsibility or liability insurance requirements under State law.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b37-6\">This argument fails for several reasons. First, as we previously discussed, \u00a7 14-154a (b) (1) does not impose an insurance requirement on the owners of rented or leased vehicles but presents them with an option to choose additional coverage if they seek to avoid vicarious liability. Second, for owners seeking to avoid vicarious liability, the optional coverage provision in subsection (b) (1) of the state statute imposes a minimum level of coverage in excess of that required for the registration and operation of motor vehicles in Connecticut. See General Statutes \u00a7 14-112 (a).<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> Third, as <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"20\">*20</page-number>the court in <em>Garcia </em>explained, the savings provision of 49 U.S.C. \u00a7 30106 (b) (1) excludes from preemption state laws that \u201cmay require insurance or its equivalent as a condition of licensing or registration, or may impose such a requirement after an accident or unpaid judgment\u201d; <em>Garcia </em>v. <em>Vanguard Car Rental USA, Inc., </em>supra, 540 F.3d 1249; whereas the savings provision of 49 U.S.C. \u00a7 30106 (b) (2) preserves state laws that <em>\u201csuspend the license and registration of, or otherwise penalize, a car owner who fails to meet the requirement, or who fails to pay a judgment </em>resulting from a collision.\u201d (Emphasis added.) <em>Garcia </em>v. <em>Vanguard Car Rental USA, Inc., </em>supra, 1249. Because \u00a7 14-154a (b) (1), unlike \u00a7 14-112 (a),<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> does none of those things, it cannot be deemed to be preserved.</p>\n<p id=\"b38-6\">Fourth, and perhaps most significantly, the plaintiffs inteipretation of \u00a7 14-154a ignores the effect of the Graves Amendment on the statute\u2019s underlying purpose. As we previously noted, subsection (a) of the state statute imposes vicarious liability on the owners of leased or rented vehicles for the negligent acts of their lessees or renters, whereas subsection (b) (1) <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"21\">*21</page-number>shields certain lessors from vicarious liability if they obtain the designated coverage. The inducement in subsection (b) (1) is predicated on the vicarious liability imposed by subsection (a) because a failure to exercise the option of obtaining additional coverage would continue to expose the lessor to vicarious liability. Thus, the plaintiffs interpretation of \u00a7 14-154a would render the Amendment meaningless because it would <em>maintain </em>the potential for vicarious liability that Congress intended to preempt under the Amendment. The court in <em>Garcia </em>noted as much when it explained, with respect to the Florida statute, that, \u201c[i]f [it had] construe [d] the Graves Amendment\u2019s savings clause as [the plaintiffs suggested], it would render the preemption clause a nullity. Every vicarious liability suit would be rescued because it could result in a judgment in favor of an accident victim, even though the judgment is premised on the very vicarious liability the Amendment seeks to eliminate. The exception would swallow the rule.\u201d <em>Garcia </em>v. <em>Vanguard Car Rental USA, Inc., </em>supra, 540 F.3d 1248. Accordingly, we conclude that the Graves Amendment preempts \u00a7 14-154a because the state statute does not impose liability on lessors for their failure to meet the type of insurance like requirements contemplated under the savings clause.</p>\n<p id=\"b39-6\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b39-7\">The plaintiff claims in the alternative that the Graves Amendment is unconstitutional because it regulates state imposed liability for harm irrespective of whether the intrastate activity is directed at the channels or instrumentalities of interstate commerce. She claims that liability is not commerce or any other sort of economic enterprise and that the link between vicarious liability and its purported effect on interstate commerce is attenuated at best. Daimler Chrysler responds that the Amendment is a valid exercise of Congressional <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"22\">*22</page-number>power under the commerce clause. We agree with Daimler Chrysler.</p>\n<p id=\"b40-6\">The constitution of the United States, article one, \u00a7 8, provides in relevant part: \u201cThe Congress shall have Power ... To regulate Commerce . . . among the Several States . . . .\u201d The United States Supreme Court has identified \u201cthree broad categories of activity that Congress may regulate under its commerce power. . . . First, Congress may regulate the use of the channels of interstate commerce. . . . Second, Congress is empowered to regulate and protect the instrumentalities of interstate commerce, or persons or things in interstate commerce, even though the threat may come only from intrastate activities. . . . Finally, Congress\u2019 commerce authority includes the power to regulate those activities having a substantial relation to interstate commerce . . . i.e., those activities that substantially affect interstate commerce . . . .\u201d (Citations omitted.) <em>United States </em>v. <em>Lopez, </em>514 U.S. 549, 558-59, 115 S. Ct. 1624, 131 L. Ed. 2d 626 (1995).</p>\n<p id=\"b40-7\">Neither the United States Supreme Court nor the Second Circuit has ruled on the constitutionality of the Graves Amendment. Numerous other federal courts have done so, however, and all but one district court have found it to be a proper exercise of the commerce power granted to Congress by the United States constitution. See, e.g., <em>Garcia </em>v. <em>Vanguard Car Rental USA, Inc., </em>supra, 540 F.3d 1253; <em>Kersey </em>v. <em>Hirano, </em>Docket No. WDQ-08-1041, 2009 WL 2151845, *2 (D. Md. July 15, 2009); <em>Green </em>v. <em>Toyota Motor CreditCorp, </em>supra, 605 F. Sup. 2d 435; <em>Stampolis </em>v. <em>Provident Auto Leasing Co., </em>586 F. Sup. 2d 88, 94 (E.D.N.Y. 2008); <em>Flagler </em>v. <em>Budget Rent A Car System, Inc., </em>538 F. Sup. 2d 557, 559 (E.D.N.Y. 2008); <em>Berkan </em>v. <em>Penske Truck Leasing Canada, Inc., </em>535 F. Sup. 2d 341, 345 (W.D.N.Y. 2008); <em>Jasman </em>v. <em>DTG Operations, Inc., </em>533 F. Sup. 2d 753, 757 (W.D. Mich. 2008); <em>Dupuis </em>v. <em>Vanguard Car Rental </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"23\">*23</page-number><em>USA, Inc., </em>510 F. Sup. 2d 980, 985 (M.D. Fla. 2007); <em>Seymour </em>v. <em>Penske Truck Leasing Co., L.P., </em>Docket No. 407CV015, 2007 WL 2212609, *2 (S.D. Ga. July 30, 2007). Contra <em>Vanguard Car Rental USA, Inc. </em>v. <em>Huchon, </em>532 F. Sup. 2d 1371, 1382 (S.D. Fla. 2007) (Graves Amendment is unconstitutional); <em>Vanguard Car Rental USA, Inc. </em>v. <em>Drouin, </em>521 F. Sup. 2d 1343, 1351 (S.D. Fla. 2007) (same).</p>\n<p id=\"b41-6\">These courts generally have concluded that the Graves Amendment fits within the second category of activity that Congress may regulate under its commerce power because car rental companies are \u201cinstrumentalities of, and things in, interstate commerce\u201d and \u201cshould not be subjected to state by state regulatory regimes that can dramatically burden their operations even if only on an intrastate basis.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Green v. Toyota Motor CreditCorp, </em>supra, 605 F. Sup. 2d 435; see also <em>Stampolis </em>v. <em>Provident Auto Leasing Co., </em>supra, 586 F. Sup. 2d 95; <em>Flagler </em>v. <em>Budget Rent A Car System, Inc., </em>supra, 538 F. Sup. 2d 559-60. They also have concluded that the Amendment fits within the third category because \u201cvicarious liability laws may, in the aggregate, adversely affect the motor vehicle leasing market.\u201d <em>Green </em>v. <em>Toyota Motor CreditCorp, </em>supra, 435; see also <em>Stampolis </em>v. <em>Provident Auto Leasing Co., </em>supra, 104; <em>Flagler </em>v. <em>Budget Rent A Car System, Inc., </em>supra, 560. This is because leasing companies may cease doing business in states with vicarious liability laws or may increase the cost of leasing cars to consumers in those and other states. <em>Green </em>v. <em>Toyota Motor CreditCorp, </em>supra, 435-36. Accordingly, we join the overwhelming majority of federal courts that have considered the question and concluded that the Amendment is constitutional.</p>\n<p id=\"b41-7\">Insofar as the plaintiff claims that liability is not commerce and that the Graves Amendment seeks to regulate state tort law rather than the rental car market, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"24\">*24</page-number>her claim has no merit. As the court in <em>Garcia </em>noted when the plaintiffs made a similar claim, this is \u201ca distinction without a difference\u201d because the state tort law preempted by the Amendment regulates the rental car market, and the effect of the Amendment is to deregulate that market. <em>Garcia v. Vanguard Car Rental USA, Inc., </em>supra, 540 F.3d 1252. The court in <em>Garcia </em>further explained: \u201c[I]t has long been understood that the commerce power includes not only the ability to regulate interstate markets, but the ability to facilitate interstate commerce by removing intrastate burdens and obstructions to it. . . . On this theory, the Graves Amendment protects the rental car market by deregulating it, eliminating state-imposed laws and lawsuits Congress reasonably believed to be a burden on an economic activity with substantial effects on commerce. . . . Congress may foster and protect the entire market for rental cars because, in the aggregate, that market substantially affects interstate commerce. [As] long as the underlying economic activity the federal statute aims to protect is within the commerce power, we will not second guess [Congress\u2019] decision that preemption is an appropriate means to achieve proper ends. Rather, Congress may choose any means reasonably adapted to the attainment of the suited end, even though they [involve] control of intrastate activities.\u201d (Citations omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.) Id., 1252-53.</p>\n<p id=\"b42-6\">The plaintiff suggests that we should follow the substantial effects analysis in <em>New York </em>v. <em>Beretta U.S.A. Corp., </em>524 F.3d 384, 393-95 (2d Cir. 2008) <em>(Beretta), </em>cert. denied, 556 U.S. 1104, 129 S. Ct. 1579, 173 L. Ed. 2d 675 (2009), instead of adopting the reasoning of <em>Garcia. </em>In <em>Beretta, </em>the Second Circuit considered the constitutionality of a federal law<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> that preempted a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"25\">*25</page-number>New York law affecting the interstate firearms industry by precluding civil actions against members of the industry for unlawful acts committed by third parties. Id., 389, 393. The plaintiff in the present case claims that, in its analysis of that issue, the Second Circuit did not determine whether the federal law directly regulated firearms as a \u201c \u2018thing\u2019 \u201d in interstate commerce, as the court in <em>Garcia </em>did with respect to the car rental industry, but focused instead on whether tort litigation relating to the firearms industry substantially affected interstate commerce. We disagree. The court in <em>Beretta, </em>like the court in <em>Garcia, </em>analyzed the issue in question pursuant to the third category of activity that Congress may regulate under its commerce power, namely, the power to regulate activities \u201chaving a substantial relation to interstate commerce . . . .\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) Id., 393; see id., 395. Moreover, like the court in <em>Garcia, </em>the court in <em>Beretta </em>did not view the regulated activity as tort litigation per se but as the firearms industry. See id., 394. The court specifically explained that, \u201c[w]hen enacting the [federal law], Congress explicitly found that the third-party suits that the [federal law] bars are a direct threat <em>to the firearms industry, </em>whose interstate character is not questioned. Furthermore, the [federal law] only reaches suits that have an explicit connection with or effect on interstate commerce.\u201d (Emphasis added; internal quotation marks omitted.) Id. The court thus concluded that there was no showing that Congress had exceeded its authority when \u201cthere [could] be no question of the interstate character of the industry in question and [when] Congress rationally perceived a substantial effect <em>on the </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"26\">*26</page-number><em>industry </em>of the litigation that the [federal law sought] to curtail.\u201d (Emphasis added.) Id., 395. Just as the regulated activity in <em>Garcia </em>was the rental car industry rather than the Florida state law concerning vicarious liability, the regulated activity in <em>Beretta </em>was the firearms industry rather than New York state law concerning tort litigation. Accordingly, the plaintiffs unsupported claim must fail.</p>\n<p id=\"b44-4\">We thus conclude that, because the Graves Amendment preempts state law and is a valid exercise of Congressional authority under the commerce clause of the United States constitution, the trial court properly granted Daimler Chrysler\u2019s summary judgment motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b44-5\">The judgment is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b44-6\">In this opinion the other justices concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b21-11\"> Title 49 of the United States Code, \u00a7 30106, provides in relevant part: \u201c(a) In General. \u2014 An owner of a motor vehicle that rents or leases the vehicle to a person (or an affiliate of the owner) shall not be liable under the law of any State or political subdivision thereof, by reason of being the owner of the vehicle (or an affiliate of the owner), for harm to persons or property that results or arises out of the use, operation, or possession of the vehicle during the period of the rental or lease, if\u2014</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b21-12\">\u201c(1) the owner (or an affiliate of the owner) is engaged in the trade or business of renting or leasing motor vehicles; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b21-13\">\u201c(2) there is no negligence or criminal wrongdoing on the part of the owner (or an affiliate of the owner).</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b21-14\">\u201c(b) Financial Responsibility Laws. \u2014 Nothing in this section supersedes the law of any State or political subdivision thereof\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b21-15\">\u201c(1) imposing financial responsibility or insurance standards on the owner of a motor vehicle for the privilege of registering and operating a motor vehicle; or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"A6j\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"4\">*4</page-number>\u201c(2) imposing liability on business entities engaged in the trade or business of renting or leasing motor vehicles for failure to meet the financial responsibility or liability insurance requirements under State law. . .</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b22-7\"> We hereinafter refer to 49 U.S.C. \u00a7 30106 as the Graves Amendment or the Amendment.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b22-8\"> General Statutes \u00a7 14-154a provides in relevant part: \u201c(a) Any person renting or leasing to another any motor vehicle owned by him shall be liable for any damage to any person or property caused by the operation of such motor vehicle while so rented or leased, to the same extent as the operator would have been liable if he had also been the owner.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b22-9\">\u201c(b) The provisions of subsection (a) of this section shall not apply to:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b22-10\">\u201c(1) Any person, with respect to the person\u2019s lease to another of a private passenger motor vehicle, if the total lease term is for one year or more and if, at the time damages are incurred, the leased vehicle is insured for bodily injury liability in amounts of not less than one hundred thousand dollars per person and three hundred thousand dollars per occurrence . . . .\u201d</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b22-11\"> The Amendment\u2019s savings clause appears in 49 U.S.C. \u00a7 30106 (b) and consists of two provisions, one in subdivision (1) and the other in subdivision (2).

General Statutes \u00a7 14-112 (a) provides in relevant part that, \u201c[i]f any person fails to furnish . . . proof [of the required insurance], the commissioner [of motor vehicles] shall, until such proof is furnished, suspend or revoke the license of such person to operate a motor vehicle or refuse to return any license which has been suspended or revoked in accordance with the provisions of section 14-111 or suspend or revoke the registration of any such motor vehicle or vehicles or refuse thereafter to register any motor vehicle owned by such person or refuse to register any motor vehicle transferred by him if it does not appear to the commissioner\u2019s satisfaction that such transfer is a bona fide sale, or, if such person is not a resident of this state, withdraw from such person the privilege of operating any motor vehicle in this state and the privilege of operation within this state of any motor vehicle owned by him. . . .\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"17\">\n<p id=\"b42-7\"> The federal law, which became effective on October 26, 2005, is the Protection of Lawful Commerce in Arms Act, 15 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 7901 through 7903, which provides in relevant part that any \u201cqualified civil liability action that is pending on October 26, 2005, shall be immediately dismissed by the court in which the action was brought or is currently pending.\u201d 15 U.S.C. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"25\">*25</page-number>\u00a7 7902 (b) (2006).
