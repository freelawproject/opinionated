The named defendant, the town of Redding (defen<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"355\">*355</page-number>dant),<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> appeals<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> from the decision of the compensation review board (board), reversing the decision of the workers\u2019 compensation commissioner for the seventh district (commissioner), that had, in accordance with the defendant\u2019s request, deemed the parties\u2019 agreement providing benefits to the plaintiff, Brian Jones, under the heart and hypertension act, General Statutes \u00a7 7-433c,<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> void ab initio because of a mistaken assumption regarding the plaintiffs employment status, and also transformed that agreement into one for benefits under <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"356\">*356</page-number>the Workers\u2019 Compensation Act, General Statutes \u00a7 31-275 et seq., contained in chapter 568 of the General Statutes (chapter 568). On appeal, the defendant claims that the board improperly concluded that the commission lacked continuing jurisdiction over the agreement because: (1) the plaintiffs failure to challenge the commissioner\u2019s decision deprived the board of jurisdiction to consider that aspect of the decision; and (2) given that the agreement was void ab initio for lack of subject matter jurisdiction since the plaintiff never qualified for benefits under \u00a7 7-433c, the defendant properly had sought to void the agreement by filing a motion for modification. We disagree with the defendant and, therefore, affirm the board\u2019s decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b374-6\">The record reveals the following undisputed facts and procedural histoiy. The defendant hired the plaintiff as apolice officer in August, 1985. Pursuant to \u00a7 7-433c, the plaintiff passed a preemployment physical examination that did not reveal any evidence of hypertension or heart disease. In June, 2002, the plaintiffs personal physician diagnosed him with hypertension, and on July 19, 2002, the plaintiff filed a notice of claim against the defendant. On March 13, 2003, the plaintiff and the defendant entered into an agreement stipulating that the parties were subject to the provisions of \u00a7 7-433c and establishing the plaintiffs average weekly wage and weekly compensation rate. On March 20, 2003, the plaintiffs treating cardiologist, Joseph Robert Anthony, concluded that the plaintiff had sustained a 35 percent impairment of the heart. The defendant\u2019s independent medical examiner, Ronald Raymond, determined, however, that the plaintiff had sustained a 30 percent impairment of the heart, and the parties thereafter reached a compromised rating of 32.5 percent impairment. In accordance with this rating, the parties entered into a supplemental voluntary agreement on November 19, 2003, wherein the plaintiff was awarded 169 weeks of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"357\">*357</page-number>permanent partial disability benefits retroactive to and commencing on March 20, 2003.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b375-6\">In March, 2003, when the parties entered into the original agreement, they had assumed that the defendant\u2019s police department was a \u201cpaid municipal police department,\u201d as that term is utilized in \u00a7 7-433c (a); see footnote 4 of this opinion; thereby conferring jurisdiction on the commission to approve the agreement, which it did, pursuant to General Statutes \u00a7 31-296 (a).<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> On December 8, 2003, however, the board issued a decision in the case <em>Genesky </em>v. <em>East Lyme, </em>No. 4600, CRB-8-02-12 (December 8, 2003), aff d, 275 Conn. 246, 881 A.2d 114 (2005),<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> concluding that the East Lyme <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"358\">*358</page-number>police department was not organized in accordance with General Statutes \u00a7 7-274,<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> and that, therefore, \u00a7 7-433c did not apply to the parties therein. Thereafter, the defendant determined that the organization of its police department was virtually identical to that of the East Lyme police department, and on January 30, 2004, decided to cease payments to the plaintiff and move, pursuant to \u00a7 31-315, to modify the agreement that had been entered into by the parties. The defendant sought a revocation of the agreement for lack of subject matter jurisdiction on the ground that it was not subject to \u00a7 7-433c because \u201c[t]here is no elected or appointed board of police commissioners or any of the other mechanisms for organizing and maintaining a police force as articulated in [\u00a7 7-274].\u201d Specifically, the defendant contended that, because <em>Genesky </em>was a \u201cclarification of the scope of [\u00a7] 7-433c,\u201d it represented a \u201cchanged [condition] of fact,\u201d which necessitated a modification of the award, pursuant to \u00a7 31-315.</p>\n<p id=\"b376-6\">The commissioner held this matter in abeyance until the outcome of the appeal to this court in <em>Genesky, </em>which had affirmed the board\u2019s decision; see footnote 7 of this opinion; after which the matter was presented to the commissioner at a formal hearing on August 17, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"359\">*359</page-number>2006, upon a stipulation of facts entered into the record. On or about April 11, 2007, the commissioner issued her decision on the defendant\u2019s motion to modify the agreement, reaching four legal conclusions, namely, that: (1) the commission retained continuing jurisdiction over the matter pursuant to \u00a7 31-315; (2) because of the incorrect assumption that the defendant\u2019s police department was a municipal police department organized under \u00a7 7-274 and that the plaintiff was, therefore, a \u201cregular member of a paid municipal police department\u201d under \u00a7 7-433c (a), the original and supplemental agreements were void ab initio at the time they were presented to the respective presiding trial commissioners; (3) because General Statutes \u00a7 31-294c (a)<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> does not require that a claimant recite, in the notice of claim, the specific statutory basis for the claim, under <em>Salmeri </em>v. <em>Dept. of Public </em>Safety, 70 Conn. App. 321, 326-34, 798 A.2d 481, cert. denied, 261 Conn. 919, 806 A.2d 1055 (2002),<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> the defendant had received adequate notice of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"360\">*360</page-number>the plaintiffs heart and hypertension claim simply by virtue of the plaintiffs filing of the notice of claim, and because \u201cthe parties\u2019 stipulated agreements support the assertion that neither party was in disagreement as to the compensability of the claim or the amount of compensation due thereunder,\u201d the claim should be administered as though it had been brought pursuant to chapter 568; and (4) consequently, the defendant improperly had terminated the plaintiffs benefits in violation of General Statutes \u00a7 31-296 (b)<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> and, therefore, further proceedings were needed to determine the amount of benefits, including interest and attorney\u2019s fees, currently due and payable to the plaintiff.</p>\n<p id=\"b378-6\">The defendant then appealed from the commissioner\u2019s decision to the board, which reversed the decision, concluding that the commission did not have continuing jurisdiction over the agreement, under \u00a7 31-315. The board first determined that its decision in <em>Genesky </em>did not represent a clarification of the scope of \u00a7 7-433c, as claimed by the defendant, but, rather, that the scope <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"361\">*361</page-number>of the statute previously had been subject to judicial review by the Appellate Session of the Superior Court in <em>Zimmer </em>v. <em>Essex, </em>38 Conn. Sup. 419, 449 A.2d 1053 (1982). The board also noted that, even if the defendant was correct that <em>Genesky </em>was a clarification of the scope of \u00a7 7-433c, opening the agreement was improper because there were no changed conditions of fact, and the equitable considerations contemplated by \u00a7 31-315 that permit a trier of fact to extend relief did not apply to mistakes of law in the present case. Further, the board concluded that, because \u00a7 31-315 did not apply, the commissioner did not have the authority to void the agreement for lack of jurisdiction when there was no evidence \u201cthat the [defendant] [was] prevented from contesting the issue of subject matter jurisdiction by fraud, accident, mistake, surprise or improper management of the opposite party.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) Thus, the board noted that, at the time the original and supplemental agreements were presented to the respective presiding commissioners, although the parties erroneously had assumed that \u00a7 7-433c applied, \u201cgiven the stipulated facts as presented at the time of signing, the decisions of the respective . . . commissioners to approve the [agreements] were eminently reasonable.\u201d<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> Accordingly, the board reversed the decision of the commissioner and remanded the matter for additional proceedings.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> This appeal followed.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b380-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"362\">*362</page-number>On appeal, the defendant first claims that the board did not have jurisdiction to review the commissioner\u2019s first two conclusions \u2014 namely, that the commission had continuing jurisdiction over the agreement and that such agreement was void ab initio \u2014 because the plaintiff had failed to file an appeal or a cross appeal. The defendant also claims that it properly had challenged the agreement by filing a motion to modify because the issue of subject matter jurisdiction may be raised at any time.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> We address each of the defendant\u2019s claims in turn.</p>\n<p id=\"b380-6\">\u201cAs a threshold matter, we set forth the standard of review applicable to workers\u2019 compensation appeals. The principles that govern our standard of review in workers\u2019 compensation appeals are well established. The conclusions drawn by [the commissioner] from the facts found must stand unless they result from an <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"363\">*363</page-number>incorrect application of the law to the subordinate facts or from an inference illegally or unreasonably drawn from them. ... It is well established that [although not dispositive, we accord great weight to the construction given to the workers\u2019 compensation statutes by the commissioner and [the] board.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Marandino </em>v. <em>Prometheus Pharmacy, </em>294 Conn. 564, 572, 986 A.2d 1023 (2010). \u201c[W]e do not afford deference to an agency\u2019s interpretation of a statute when . . . the construction of a statute previously has not been subjected to \u2018judicial scrutiny\u2019 or to \u2018a governmental agency\u2019s time-tested interpretation ....\u2019\u201d <em>Donahue </em>v. <em>Veridiem, Inc., </em>291 Conn. 537, 547, 970 A.2d 630 (2009).</p>\n<p id=\"b381-6\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b381-7\">The defendant first contends that, under Practice Book \u00a7 61-8,<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> upon its appeal challenging the commissioner\u2019s third and fourth conclusions \u2014 namely, that it was proper to transform the agreement for heart and hypertension benefits into one for workers\u2019 compensation benefits, pursuant to chapter 568, and awarding to the plaintiff benefits owed \u2014 the plaintiff was required to file a cross appeal for the board to have jurisdiction to review the commissioner\u2019s first and second conclusions, namely, that the commission had continuing jurisdiction over the agreement and that it was void ab initio. Because the plaintiff failed to file a cross appeal, the defendant claims that the board lacked jurisdiction to review the commissioner\u2019s first two conclusions, which were not challenged in the defendant\u2019s appeal. Moreover, the defendant emphasizes that the first two con<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"364\">*364</page-number>elusions were \u201centirely separate in law and in fact\u201d from the two conclusions it did not challenge, stating that \u201c[t]he first two [conclusions] addressed the issues that had been presented and briefed by the parties, based on a stipulation of facts [while] [t]he latter two [conclusions] were an excursion by the [commissioner], embarked on by her sui generis, and neither advocated nor briefed by the parties, nor addressed in the record.\u201d In response, the plaintiff contends that the board properly reviewed the commissioner\u2019s decision, despite the fact that he had not filed an appeal or cross appeal, because: (1) the plaintiff was not aggrieved by the commissioner\u2019s decision under \u00a7 61-8; (2) the matter was interlocutory in that there was no actual relief granted to either party; and (3) even if an appeal or a cross appeal would have been preferable, the plain error doctrine applied, thus giving the board authority to review the entirety of the commissioner\u2019s decision. We agree with the plaintiff that he was not aggrieved by the commissioner\u2019s decision and, therefore, could not properly have filed an appeal or cross appeal to obtain review of the entirety of the commissioner\u2019s decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b382-6\">We begin our analysis of the defendant\u2019s claim by setting forth the applicable standard of review. Although in cases involving disputed facts we have stated that the issue of whether a party is aggrieved is a question of fact subject to the clearly erroneous standard of review; see, e.g., <em>Mystic Marinelife Aquarium, Inc. </em>v. <em>Gill, </em>175 Conn. 483, 496, 400 A.2d 726 (1978); in the present case, because the matter was based on a stipulation of facts, only the legal conclusion of aggrievement is at issue. Accordingly, the issue of whether the plaintiff was aggrieved under Practice Book \u00a7 61-8 is a question of law, subject to plenary review. See, e.g., <em>AvalonBay Communities, Inc. </em>v. <em>Orange, </em>256 Conn. 557, 565, 775 A.2d 284 (2001).</p>\n<p id=\"b383-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"365\">*365</page-number>In workers\u2019 compensation cases, the procedure for appealing from the decision of a commissioner is the same as that followed in appealing from a decision of the Superior Court to this court. See General Statutes \u00a7 31-301 (e). In appeals from the Superior Court, if an appellee is aggrieved by the decision from which the appellant appealed, the appellee may file a cross appeal within ten days of the filing of the appeal. Practice Book \u00a7 61-8. \u201cTo be aggrieved, a party must have a specific personal and legal interest in the subject matter of the litigation and, further, that interest must be specially and injuriously affected by the decision at issue. . . . Given the latter requirement, [a]s a general rule, a party that prevails ... is not aggrieved. . . . Moreover, [a] party cannot be aggrieved by a decision that grants the very relief sought. . . . Such a party cannot establish that a specific personal and legal interest has been specially and injuriously affected by the decision. . . . Nevertheless, we have recognized that [a] prevailing party . . . can be aggrieved ... if the relief awarded to that party falls short of the relief sought.\u201d (Citations omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>T.D., </em>286 Conn. 353, 358-59, 944 A.2d 288 (2008).</p>\n<p id=\"b383-6\">In the present case, the commissioner determined that, although \u00a7 7-433c did not apply to the plaintiffs claim for benefits, chapter 568 did apply and, accordingly, the commissioner ordered the parties to proceed with the administration of the plaintiffs benefits under that chapter. The commissioner also ordered the defendant to pay to the plaintiff benefits owed to him as a result of the defendant\u2019s unilateral termination of such benefits. Thus, the plaintiff prevailed, and was placed in the same or better position than he was previously as a result of the decision. As we have stated, when a party receives all the relief he has sought, \u201c[he] cannot establish that a specific personal and legal interest has been specially and injuriously affected by the decision.\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"366\">*366</page-number>Id., 359. Accordingly, the plaintiff was not aggrieved and, thus, could not have filed a cross appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b384-6\">The defendant contends, however, that the plaintiff was aggrieved by a portion of the commissioner\u2019s decision, namely, her conclusion that the agreement was void ab initio. Viewing the commissioner\u2019s decision in its totality, this conclusion does not alter the fact that the plaintiff was not \u201cspecially and injuriously affected by the decision\u201d; id.; as, again, he was placed in the same or better position than he was in previously. See <em>Seymour </em>v. <em>Seymour, </em>262 Conn. 107, 115, 809 A.2d 1114 (2002) (\u201c[i]n contrast, as noted previously, where, as in this case, a litigant asks to be given either one form of relief or another, the litigant is not aggrieved if the trial court orders, in its entirety, one of the forms of relief requested\u201d). Furthermore, \u201ca litigant has no right to appeal a judgment in his or her favor merely for the purpose of having the judgment based on a different legal ground than that relied upon by the trial court, or to settle an abstract question of law.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>T.D., </em>supra, 286 Conn. 359, quoting 5 Am. Jur. 2d 39, Appellate Review \u00a7 243 (2007). Additionally, \u201c [a]s a general proposition, a party who has fully prevailed in the court below is not entitled to appeal from the judgment solely for the purpose of attacking as erroneous the reasons of the court or its conclusions of law.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>T.D., </em>supra, 359, quoting annot., 69 A.L.R.2d 724, \u00a7 10 [b] (1960). We conclude, therefore, that the plaintiffs inability to appeal because he was not aggrieved under Practice Book \u00a7 61-8, could not deprive the board of jurisdiction to review the commissioner\u2019s two conclusions that were not specifically challenged in the defendant\u2019s appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b384-7\">The defendant contends, nevertheless, that the commissioner\u2019s first two conclusions \u201cwere entirely separate in law and in fact\u201d from the second two <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"367\">*367</page-number>conclusions. We disagree. As recognized by the board in its ruling on the defendant\u2019s motion for articulation, the commissioner\u2019s four conclusions were \u201cinextricably linked\u201d and not logically capable of being unbundled from each other, especially in light of the commissioner\u2019s use of the word \u201cfurther\u201d in conclusions three and four, which refer back to conclusions one and two.</p>\n<p id=\"b385-6\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b385-7\">We next address the principal issue in this appeal, namely, the defendant\u2019s claim that the agreement was void for lack of subject matter jurisdiction because the plaintiff never qualified for benefits under \u00a7 7-433c and, therefore, that the board improperly determined that the defendant\u2019s motion to open and modify under \u00a7 31-315 was not a proper vehicle by which to raise the question of subject matter jurisdiction. The defendant contends that our case law establishes that this issue can be raised at any time, and must be resolved whenever it is raised. Specifically, the defendant contends that the board improperly concluded that the defendant was required to raise the issue of subject matter jurisdiction at the first opportunity presented, namely, when the agreement was first formed, and that, because the defendant had failed to do so, the agreement could not be opened under \u00a7 31-315. The defendant also contends that the issue of subject matter jurisdiction falls squarely within the scope of \u00a7 31-315. In response, the plaintiff contends that the board properly reversed the commissioner\u2019s decision to open and modify the agreement because: (1) the defendant had a previous opportunity to litigate any question of subject matter jurisdiction; and (2) \u00a7 31-315 did not provide a basis for opening the agreement in the present case. We disagree with the defendant and conclude that the board properly reversed the commissioner\u2019s decision opening and modifying the agreement.</p>\n<p id=\"b386-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"368\">*368</page-number>We begin our analysis of the defendant\u2019s claim by setting forth the applicable standard of review. Whether \u00a7 31-315 permits a commissioner to open an agreement for a mistake of law that is subject matter jurisdictional in nature is a question of law over which our review is plenary.<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> See, e.g., <em>State </em>v. <em>Stenner, </em>281 Conn. 742, 761-62, 917 A.2d 28, cert. denied, 552 U.S. 883, 128 S. Ct. 290, 169 L. Ed. 2d 139 (2007).</p>\n<p id=\"b386-6\">\u201cAlthough the commission may modify awards under certain circumstances, its power to do so is strictly limited by statute.\u201d <em>Marone </em>v. <em>Waterbury, </em>244 Conn. 1, 15, 707 A.2d 725 (1998). \u201cAlthough strict finality is strongly favored, there are certain situations that demand a flexible approach allowing for modifications. . . .</p>\n<p id=\"b386-7\">\u201cSection 31-315 allows the commission to modify an award in three situations. First, modification is permitted where the incapacity of an injured employee has increased, decreased or ceased, or . . . the measure of dependence on account of which the compensation is paid has changed .... Second, the award may be modified when changed conditions of fact have arisen which necessitate a change of [the award]. . . . Third, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"369\">*369</page-number>[t]he commissioner shall also have the same power to open and modify an award as any court of the state has to open and modify a judgment of such court. This provision extends the commission\u2019s power to open and modify judgments to cases of accident; <em>Hayden </em>v. <em>Wallace &amp; Sons Mfg. Co., </em>100 Conn. 180, 188, 123 A. 9 (1923); to mistakes of fact; <em>Fair </em>v. <em>Hartford Rubber Works Co., </em>95 Conn. 350, 355, 111 A. 193 (1920); and to fraud; <em>Grabowski </em>v. <em>Miskell, </em>97 Conn. 76, 84, 115 A. 691 (1921); <em>but not to mistakes of law. Kalinick </em>v. <em>Collins Co., </em>[116 Conn. 1, 4-5, 163 A. 460 (1932)].\u201d (Citations omitted; emphasis added; internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Marone </em>v. <em>Waterbury, </em>supra, 244 Conn. 15-17.</p>\n<p id=\"b387-6\">In the present case, the first two grounds pursuant to which the commissioner has the authority to modify an agreement clearly are inapplicable. Moreover, our review of the record does not reveal any accident, mistake of fact or fraud that would satisfy the third ground for opening an agreement. Rather, we agree with the board that the parties\u2019 failure to recognize that \u00a7 7-433c did not apply to them was a mistake of law, which, based as it is on decisional law, is not within the scope of \u00a7 31-315. See <em>Hayden </em>v. <em>Wallace &amp; Sons Mfg. Co., </em>supra, 100 Conn. 186 (\u201cequity will not interfere to grant a new trial in an action at law . . . unless the judgment was obtained through fraud, accident or mistake, <em>unconnected with any negligence or inattention on the part of the judgment debtor\u201d </em>[emphasis added]); <em>O\u2019Neil </em>v. <em>Honeywell, Inc., </em>66 Conn.

Our decision in <em>Hayden </em>v. <em>Wallace &amp; Sons Mfg. Co., </em>supra, 100 Conn. 180, is controlling. In <em>Hayden, </em>this court decided an issue pertaining to the jurisdiction of the commission over a voluntary agreement and supplemental award (agreement) due to a mistaken assumption by the parties. Id., 184. The specific question in <em>Hayden </em>was whether the agreement could be opened under General Statutes (1918 Rev.) \u00a7 5355,<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> the predecessor to \u00a7 31-315, when the employer had determined, one year after the parties had entered into the agreement, that the claimants were independent contractors, not its employees, at the time they incurred their injuries, and thus not eligible for workers\u2019 compensation benefits. Id. In denying the employer\u2019s motion to open and modify the agreement, this court noted that, because of the \u201c \u2018negligence or inattention\u2019 \u201d of the employer, \u201c \u2018[e]quity will not . . . relieve against a judgment rendered ....\u2019\u201d Id., 186. Thus, the court concluded that \u00a7 5355 did not apply to the circumstances, as the agreement had not been \u201cobtained through fraud, accident or mistake, unconnected with any negligence or inattention on the part of the [employer] . . . .\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) Id. Similarly, in the present case, the defendant failed to recognize, whether through \u201cnegligence or inattentifyeness],\u201d that its law enforcement arrangements were not structured according to \u00a7 7-274 and that, therefore, the plaintiffs compensation claim should have been brought under chapter 568, not \u00a7 7-433c. Accordingly, under <em>Hayden, </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"371\">*371</page-number>we conclude that it was proper for the board to, in effect, \u201c[estop] [the defendant] from abandoning the position it had deliberately taken . . . .\u201d <em>Castro </em>v. <em>Viera, 207 </em>Conn. 420, 432 n.6, 541 A.2d 1216 (1988); see also <em>Connecticut Pharmaceutical Assn., Inc. </em>v. <em>Milano, </em>191 Conn. 555, 560, 468 A.2d 1230 (1983) (\u201ca party cannot belatedly contest subject matter jurisdiction when he was fully aware of the consequences of the [decree] and had the opportunity to fully litigate the question of jurisdiction in the original action, but, by stipulation, agreed without reservation to the terms of the orders which he now challenges\u201d [internal quotation marks omitted]).</p>\n<p id=\"b389-6\">The defendant contends, however, that <em>Castro </em>v. <em>Viera, </em>supra, 207 Conn. 420, makes clear that a challenge to subject matter jurisdiction can be made at any time, and that <em>Hayden </em>was decided, not on jurisdictional grounds, but on equitable principles alone, and thus does not preclude the defendant from challenging the agreement based on subject matter jurisdiction. We disagree because <em>Castro </em>is distinguishable. Although we agree that <em>Castro </em>reaffirms the well established principle that questions regarding subject matter jurisdiction can be raised at any time during the original proceedings and direct appeals from that proceeding; see, e.g., <em>Kozlowski </em>v. <em>Commissioner of Transportation, </em>274 Conn. 497, 502, 876 A.2d 1148 (2005); that principle does not alter the persuasive value of <em>Hayden </em>in informing our decision in the present case. <em>Castro, </em>unlike <em>Hayden, </em>dealt with the employer-employee relationship in the context of a motion to preclude during the original proceedings before the commissioner, not a motion to open a previously approved agreement, and, therefore, the applicability of \u00a7 31-315 was not at issue. <em>Castro </em>v. <em>Viera, </em>supra, 422. In fact, in <em>Castro, </em>we noted that <em>Hayden </em>was distinct, stating that we were \u201cnot now reading] . . . <em>Hayden </em>as inconsistent with <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"372\">*372</page-number>or controlling our disposition of the appeal now before us.\u201d Id., 432 n.6. Furthermore, in <em>Castro, </em>we noted that, in <em>Hayden, </em>\u201c[w]e . . . indicated] that the employer\u2019s failure to ascertain the facts showing its nonliability was due to its own negligence, that it was estopped from abandoning the position it had deliberately taken and that the commissioner could not do so under the statute.\u201d Id.</p>\n<p id=\"b390-6\">We similarly disagree with the defendant\u2019s reading of <em>Hayden </em>as not relevant to the issue of subject matter jurisdiction. In fact, <em>Hayden </em>dealt squarely with the very heart of subject matter jurisdiction in workers\u2019 compensation cases, namely, the employer-employee relationship. See <em>Castro </em>v. <em>Viera, </em>supra, 207 Conn. 433 (\u201cThe entire statutory scheme of the Workers\u2019 Compensation Act is directed toward those who are in the employer-employee relationship as those terms are defined in the act and discussed in our cases. That relationship is threshold to the rights and benefits under the act .... This requisite relationship was a jurisdictional fact to be proven in this case . . . .\u201d [Internal quotation marks omitted.]). In denying the employer\u2019s motion to open the agreement based upon what was, in effect, a challenge to the commission\u2019s jurisdiction over the agreement, this court in <em>Hayden </em>reviewed the claim under the appropriate statutory framework, \u00a7 5355, and invoked equitable principles to reach its conclusion that, in the case of a mistake of law whereby the party seeking modification of an agreement has acted either negligently or inattentively, an agreement cannot be opened.</p>\n<p id=\"b390-7\">We also find persuasive our more recent decision in <em>Marone </em>v. <em>Waterbury, </em>supra, 244 Conn. 1, wherein this court considered whether a claimant was entitled to retroactive modification of benefits under General Stat<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"373\">*373</page-number>utes \u00a7\u00a7 7-433c and 7-433b (b),<footnotemark>19</footnotemark> following this court\u2019s decision in <em>Szudora </em>v. <em>Fairfield, </em>214 Conn. 552, 559, 573 A.2d 1 (1990), which had expanded the definition of maximum cumulative \u201c \u2018weekly compensation\u2019 \u201d available under \u00a7 7-433b (b) to include overtime payments. Subsequently, the plaintiff sought retroactive recalculation of his award in accordance with <em>Szudora. Marone </em>v. <em>Waterbury, </em>supra, 4. In upholding denial of the plaintiffs motion to modify the award, this court relied on <em>Kalinick </em>v. <em>Collins Co., </em>supra, 116 Conn. I,<footnotemark>20</footnotemark> <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"374\">*374</page-number>concluding that, although \u00a7 31-315 provides limited circumstances in which an award may be modified, it \u201cdoes not authorize modifications based on a new interpretation of law such as that contained in <em>Szudora.\u201d Marone </em>v. <em>Waterbury, </em>supra, 15. This court also noted that \u201callowing retroactive recalculations of awards in nonpending cases . . . would plunge the workers\u2019 compensation system into a state of paralytic uncertainty. Employers and insurers, as well as injured employees, would find it difficult, if not impossible, to plan for the future if judgments could be opened and retroactively modified on the basis of unanticipated changes in the law.\u201d Id., 18-19.</p>\n<p id=\"b392-6\">This court, therefore, previously has concluded that even an unanticipated change in law does not warrant opening an award under \u00a7 31-315. In the present case, the issue was not an unanticipated change in law but, rather, a mistake of law, whereby the parties, either through \u201c \u2018negligence or inattention\u2019 <em>Hayden </em>v. <em>Wallace &amp; Sons Mfg. Co., </em>supra, 100 Conn. 186; had made an erroneous assumption regarding the appropriate statutory context for the plaintiffs award of benefits. Indeed, at the time of the agreement, even prior to the release of <em>Genesky </em>v. <em>East Lyme, </em>supra, 275 Conn. 246, several of the board\u2019s decisions relied on the interpretation of \u00a7\u00a7 7-433c and 7-274 set forth by the Appellate Session of the Superior Court in <em>Zimmer </em>v. <em>Essex, </em>supra, 38 Conn. Sup. 419. See, e.g., <em>Crossway </em>v. <em>Newington, </em>No. 978, CRD-6-90-2 (June 28, 1991); <em>Zimmer </em>v. <em>Meriden, </em>No. 253, CRB-6-83 (February 5,1986); <em>Gallucci </em>v. <em>Waterbury, </em>No. 313, CRD-5-84 (July 24,1984); <em>Watson </em>v. <em>Bristol, </em>No. 315, CRD-6-84 (July 24, 1984); see also <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"375\">*375</page-number><em>Genesky </em>v. <em>East Lyme, </em>supra, 250 n.6 (\u201c[a]lthough . . . [we do] not rely on <em>Zimmer </em>as precedent . . . the court in <em>Zimmer </em>interpreted \u00a7\u00a7 7-433c and 7-274 under facts similar to those of the present case\u201d). In fact, the defendant concedes on appeal that its position was premised not on the fact that <em>Genesky </em>clarified the scope of \u00a7 7-433c but, rather, \u201cthat the issue of subject matter jurisdiction can be raised at any time, and must be resolved whenever it is raised . . . .\u201d Accordingly, we agree with the board that the parties\u2019 assumptions regarding the applicability of \u00a7 7-433c to the original and supplemental agreements was, \u201cin retrospect inaccurate,\u201d but also that, \u201cgiven the stipulated facts as presented at the time of signing, the decisions of the respective trial commissioners to approve the [agreements] were eminently reasonable.\u201d On the basis of our review of the record, we conclude, therefore, that the board properly determined that \u00a7 31-315 did not permit the opening of the agreement.</p>\n<p id=\"b393-6\">The decision of the compensation review board is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b393-7\">In this opinion the other justices concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b372-11\"> General Statutes \u00a7 31-315 provides in relevant part: \u201cAny award of, or voluntary agreement concerning, compensation made under the provisions of this chapter . . . shall be subject to modification in accordance with the procedure for original determinations, upon the request of either party . . . whenever it appears to the compensation commissioner, after notice and hearing thereon, that the incapacity of an injured employee has increased, decreased or ceased, or that the measure of dependence on account of which the compensation is paid has changed, or that changed conditions of fact have arisen which necessitate a change of such agreement, award or transfer in order properly to carry out the spirit of this chapter.

Wausau has filed a brief in this appeal, joining the defendant in contending that the workers\u2019 compensation commissioner lacked the authority to transform the award into one for benefits under the Workers\u2019 Compensation Act, General Statutes \u00a7 31-275 et seq., and that, in doing so, she violated its due process rights because she made that finding without giving the parties prior notice or an opportunity to be heard on the issue.
