(Wachovia), had held a mortgage.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The state claims that the trial court improperly concluded that it lacked subject matter jurisdiction over the applications for those attachments because the applications had not complied with the requirements of General Statutes \u00a7 52-278e (a).<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Specifically, the state claims that the trial court improperly concluded that the applications for the prejudgment attachments were invalid because they had not been accompanied by affidavits from a \u201ccompetent affiant\u201d as required under \u00a7 52-278e (a). We agree with the state, and, accordingly, we reverse the decision of the trial court.</p>\n<p id=\"b578-5\">The record reflects the following undisputed facts. This appeal arises from an enforcement action brought <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"561\">*561</page-number>by the state, at the request of the commissioner of consumer protection, pursuant to General Statutes \u00a7 42-110m (a)<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> of the Connecticut Unfair Trade Practices Act (CUTPA), General Statutes \u00a7 42-110a et seq., against Hawk-Hoffman, Sunrise Herbal Remedies, Inc. (Sunrise), and Sage Advice, Inc. (Sage). In that action, the state alleged that Hawk-Hoffman was the principal of Sunrise and Sage, and that, in that capacity, she had directed, controlled and participated in various unfair or deceptive acts in violation of General Statutes \u00a7 42-110b (a) in connection with the sale of herbal products.</p>\n<p id=\"b579-5\">Subsequent to filing the CUTPA action, the state filed an ex parte application for a prejudgment remedy pursuant to \u00a7 52-278e (a). Specifically, the state sought an attachment of a parcel of Hawk-Hoffman\u2019s real property located adjacent to 35 Codfish Hill Road in Bethel, in order to secure at least $1,391,000, representing $91,000 in restitution and $1,300,000 in civil penalties on the basis of 260 alleged wilful violations of CUTPA. The application was accompanied by an affidavit signed by Assistant Attorney General Matthew F. Fitzsimmons, in which he averred, inter alia, that the state had received 260 consumer complaints or inquiries about the business practices of Hawk-Hoffman, Sunrise and Sage, reporting an average consumer loss of approxi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"562\">*562</page-number>mately $362. The affidavit also stated that, prior to the commencement of the action, the state had served Hawk-Hoffman with a civil investigative demand, and that, after receiving the demand and discussing her responses with the state, Hawk-Hoffman had dissolved Sunrise and transferred her interest in 35 Codfish Hill Road in Bethel by quitclaim deed to Hoffman, her husband. The trial court, <em>Miller, J., </em>granted the ex parte application.</p>\n<p id=\"b580-5\">The state in a separate action also filed a complaint against the defendants alleging fraudulent conveyance in connection with the transfer of the 35 Codfish Hill Road property, and an application for an ex parte prejudgment remedy seeking an attachment on that property. This application was accompanied by an affidavit from Fitzsimmons setting forth details of the underlying CUTPA action and the alleged fraudulent transfer. The trial court, <em>Wiese, J., </em>granted that ex parte application as well.</p>\n<p id=\"b580-6\">Prior to the attachments, the Bethel properties had been encumbered by two mortgages; Wachovia held the first mortgage and IndyMac Bank held the second mortgage. Following the execution and recording of the state\u2019s attachments, the defendants executed a third mortgage with Wachovia on the Bethel properties.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> After Wachovia and IndyMac Bank instituted foreclosure actions against the properties, an agreement was reached among the state, the defendants and Wachovia, according to which the properties would be sold, the proceeds of the sale would be used to pay off the mortgages on the property entered before the state\u2019s attach<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"563\">*563</page-number>ments and Wachovia would be permitted to intervene as an interested party in the proceedings relating to those attachments. In accordance with the parties\u2019 agreement, the balance of the proceeds was placed in an escrow account and the trial court ordered the substitution of the state\u2019s attachments on the property with attachments on the contents of the escrow account.</p>\n<p id=\"b581-5\">Thereafter, in accordance with \u00a7 52-278e (d),<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> the defendants and Wachovia moved to dissolve the attachments on the ground that the applications were fatally defective and, therefore, that the court lacked subject matter jurisdiction over the attachments. Specifically, they contended that the affidavits were not supported by personal knowledge and, therefore, had not been filed by a competent affiant, as required by \u00a7 52-278e (a). The state thereafter filed a \u201csubstitute affidavit in support of the application for an ex parte [prejudgment remedy]\u201d from Patrick M. Ahlquist, an investigator in the office of the attorney general, to which the defendants objected as unauthorized under, and in contravention of, the prejudgment remedy scheme.</p>\n<p id=\"b581-6\">The court scheduled a consolidated evidentiary hearing to consider the jurisdictional issue. At the hearing, Fitzsimmons testified that he had acquired personal knowledge of the facts recited in the two affidavits by, inter alia: (1) reading the state\u2019s civil investigative <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"564\">*564</page-number>demand and Hawk-Hoffman\u2019s responses thereto; (2) attending a meeting with Hawk-Hoffman and her attorney; (3) reviewing the complaint file, including all documents submitted with the complaints; (4) reviewing the Bethel land records for the Codfish Hill properties at the Bethel town clerk\u2019s office; and (5) reviewing the secretary of the state\u2019s records for Sunrise.</p>\n<p id=\"b582-5\">The trial court treated Fitzsimmons\u2019 affidavits as the operative ones in the proceedings and, therefore, did not address the objections to Ahlquist\u2019s substitute affidavit. In considering Fitzsimmons\u2019 affidavits, the trial court first reasoned that there is a distinction under ornease law between properly executed affidavits lacking sufficient facts and invalid affidavits, and concluded that the latter was an improper basis for the court\u2019s jurisdiction to grant a prejudgment attachment. The trial court concluded that the affidavits were invalid because Fitzsimmons was not a competent affiant, as required by the statute.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> See General Statutes \u00a7 52-278e (a). Specifically, the trial court noted: \u201c[I]t is clear that evidence has not been introduced sufficient to support a finding that Fitzsimmons had personal knowledge of the matters in the affidavits regarding the consumer complaints. Before making out the affidavits, Fitzsimmons basically reviewed the consumer complaint files.\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"565\">*565</page-number>The trial court then concluded that \u201cFitzsimmons\u2019 review of the consumer complaint files did not make him a competent affiant of the essential facts. . . . Fitzsimmons lacked personal knowledge of the essential facts supporting the prejudgment attachments. He did not possess the requisite legal qualifications to provide the affidavits in question.\u201d<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> Therefore, the trial court determined that it did not have jurisdiction over the state\u2019s applications for the ex parte prejudgment attachments, and accordingly granted the motions to dissolve the attachments. This appeal followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b583-5\">The state claims that the trial court improperly concluded that it did not have subject matter jurisdiction over the applications for the ex parte prejudgment attachments because Fitzsimmons had personal knowledge of the relevant matters, and the mere fact that the affidavits may have contained some hearsay relating to the consumer complaints did not render the affidavits invalid. The state further contends that, even if that hearsay is deemed improper support for the applications, because the state had met the threshold requirement for a proper affidavit, it was entitled to present further evidence to demonstrate probable cause at a hearing pursuant to \u00a7 52-278e (e).<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> In response, the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"566\">*566</page-number>defendants and Wachovia claim that the trial court properly concluded that Fitzsimmons was not a competent affiant.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> Wachovia further contends that the interpretation of \u00a7 52-278e (a) advanced by the state would violate due process because it would allow ex parte prejudgment attachments to be imposed on the basis of conclusory allegations and hearsay, rather than facts. We agree with the state that Fitzsimmons was a competent affiant and, therefore, that the trial court must conduct a hearing to determine whether there is probable cause to maintain the attachments. We further conclude that Wachovia\u2019s due process claim is inadequately briefed.</p>\n<p id=\"b585-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"567\">*567</page-number>I</p>\n<p id=\"b585-5\">We first turn to the question of whether the trial court properly determined that it lacked subject matter jurisdiction over the applications for a prejudgment attachment because Fitzsimmons\u2019 affidavits were invalid. That determination was predicated on the court\u2019s conclusion that Fitzsimmons did not have personal knowledge of the facts in the affidavits and, therefore, was not a \u201ccompetent affiant\u201d under \u00a7 52-278e (a). We conclude that the trial court\u2019s conclusion was premised on an incorrect interpretation of that term.</p>\n<p id=\"b585-6\">\u201cWe have long held that because [a] determination regarding a trial court\u2019s subject matter jurisdiction is a question of law, our review is plenary.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> . . . Subject matter jurisdiction involves the authority of the court to adjudicate the type of controversy presented by the action before it. . . . [A] court lacks discretion to consider the merits of a case over which it is without jurisdiction . . . .\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Sastrom </em>v. <em>Psychiatric Security Review Board, </em>291 Conn. 307, 314-15, 968 A.2d 396 (2009).</p>\n<p id=\"b585-7\">\u201cWhen construing a statute, [o]ur fundamental objective is to ascertain and give effect to the apparent intent of the legislature. ...

[W]e are mindful of the legislature\u2019s directive that, [i]n the construction of the statutes, words and phrases shall be construed according to the commonly approved usage of the language; and technical words and phrases, and such as have acquired a peculiar and appropriate meaning in the law, shall be construed and understood accordingly.

Benistar Property Exchange Trust Co., </em>268 Conn. 264, 270, 842 A.2d 1113 (2004).</p>\n<p id=\"b587-5\">Before turning to the specific meaning of \u201ccompetent affiant,\u201d we note the following background for proper context. Section 52-278e (a) sets forth two requirements that must be satisfied before a court can allow the issuance of an ex parte prejudgment remedy. See footnote 3 of this opinion. The requirement at issue in this appeal is \u201cthe filing of an affidavit sworn to by the plaintiff or any competent affiant setting forth a statement of facts sufficient to show that there is probable cause that a judgment in the amount of the prejudgment remedy sought, or in an amount greater than the amount of the prejudgment remedy sought . . . will be rendered in the matter in favor of the plaintiff . . . .\u201d General Statutes \u00a7 52-278e (a). A defendant against whom an ex parte prejudgment remedy has been issued may move to dissolve or modify the attachment by following the procedures set forth in \u00a7 52-278e (d). See footnote 6 of this opinion. Upon such a motion, the trial court \u201cshall proceed to hold a hearing .... If the court determines at such hearing requested by the defendant that there is probable cause that judgment will be rendered in the matter in favor of the plaintiff and, if the plaintiff has relied on a ground set forth in subsection (a) of this section, that there is probable cause to believe such ground exists, the prejudgment remedy granted shall remain in effect. If the court determines there is no probable cause to believe that a judgment will be rendered in the matter in favor of the plaintiff or, if a ground set forth in subsection (a) of this section was relied on, to believe such ground exists, the prejudgment remedy shall be dissolved. . . .\u201d General Statutes \u00a7 52-278e (e); see also <em>Glanz </em>v. <em>Testa, </em>200 Conn. 406, 409, 511 A.2d 341 (1986) (\u201cthe [ex parte prejudgment <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"570\">*570</page-number>remedy] statute guarantees the defendant the opportunity for an immediate post-seizure hearing at which the prejudgment remedy will be dissolved unless the court determines that there is probable cause to sustain the validity of the plaintiffs claim\u201d [internal quotation marks omitted]).<footnotemark>13</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b588-5\">Our case law has addressed two deficiencies that may occur under this scheme: the filing of an application for ex parte attachment with an affidavit that is insufficient, in and of itself, to establish probable cause; and the filing of an application without any supporting affidavit. When an affidavit is merely insufficient to establish probable cause, a plaintiff may introduce additional evidence to buttress the initial affidavit at the probable cause hearing held pursuant to \u00a7 52-278e (e). <em>Glanz </em>v. <em>Testa, </em>supra, 200 Conn. 408-409; see also <em>Doe </em>v. <em>Rapoport, </em>80 Conn. App. 111, 117, 833 A.2d 926 (2003); <em>Lengyel &amp; Lengyel Builders, Inc. </em>v. <em>Hill, </em>1 Conn. App. 349, 350, 471 A.2d 975 (1984). When a plaintiff provides <em>no affidavit </em>with an application for a prejudgment remedy, however, the plaintiff is not entitled to provide support for the initial application at a probable cause hearing. <em>Lauf v. James, </em>33 Conn. App. 223, 228-29, 635 A.2d 300 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"571\">*571</page-number>(1993) (relying on parties\u2019 concession that affidavit was so defective that application should be treated as unsupported by <em>any </em>affidavit and precluding additional evidence); see also <em>Davila </em>v. <em>Secure Pharmacy Plus, </em>329 F. Sup. 2d 311, 313 (D. Conn. 2004) (\u201c[The] [p]laintiff has not submitted an affidavit with either motion, let alone an affidavit that sets forth facts sufficient to demonstrate that there is probable cause that a judgment will enter in favor of [the] [p]laintiff .... Instead, [the] [p]laintiff simply states that there is probable cause that a judgment will be rendered in his favor. [The] [p]laintiff has thus failed to comply with . . . General Statutes \u00a7 52-278c [a] [2].\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b589-5\">The trial court\u2019s determination that it did not have subject matter jurisdiction over the attachments rested upon two conclusions: (1) that Fitzsimmons lacked personal knowledge of the facts relevant to the CUTPA complaints, which rendered the affidavit invalid; and (2) that pursuant to <em>Lauf, </em>a plaintiff may not bolster the application when that application under \u00a7 52-278e (a) is accompanied by an <em>invalid </em>affidavit. We do not address the trial court\u2019s second conclusion because we conclude that it improperly determined that Fitzsimmons was not a competent affiant.</p>\n<p id=\"b589-6\">\u201cCompetent affiant\u201d is a legal term of art, and, because there is no legislative indication to the contrary, the term is presumed to carry its legal meaning in the context of the statute. See <em>State </em>v. <em>Dupigney, </em>supra, 295 Conn. 58-59. An \u201caffidavit\u201d is defined as \u201c[a] voluntary declaration of facts written down and sworn to by a declarant before an officer authorized to administer oaths\u201d and an \u201caffiant\u201d is \u201c[o]ne who makes an affidavit.\u201d Black\u2019s Law Dictionary (9th Ed. 2009). \u201cGenerally, affidavits must be made on the affiant\u2019s personal knowledge of the facts alleged in the petition. The affidavit must in some way show that the affiant is personally familiar with the facts so that he could personally <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"572\">*572</page-number>testify as a witness.\u201d 3 Am. Jur. 2d 397, Affidavits \u00a7 14 (2002). Black\u2019s Law Dictionary (9th Ed. 2009) defines \u201ccompetence\u201d as \u201c[a] basic or minimal ability to do something; qualification, esp. to testify.\u201d See also <em>Blue Cross &amp; Blue Shield of Connecticut, Inc. </em>v. <em>Mike, </em>184 Conn. 352, 354, 439 A.2d 1026 (1981) (\u201cThe word \u2018competent\u2019 has a number of meanings. One of the definitions is \u2018legally qualified\u2019; Webster, Third New International Dictionary; or stated another way \u2018possessing the requisite . . . legal qualifications.\u2019 Black\u2019s Law Dictionary [5th Ed. 1979].\u201d). These sources indicate that competence denotes a threshold level of basic capacity and ability.</p>\n<p id=\"b590-5\">In determining the competence of a witness, it is well established that \u201c[a] person who has no personal knowledge concerning facts about which he or she is asked to testify is not competent to testify about these facts.\u201d C. Tait &amp; E. Prescott, Connecticut Evidence (4th Ed. 2008) \u00a7 6.4, p. 301; see also 1 C. McCormick, Evidence (6th Ed. 2006) \u00a7 10, p. 47 (\u201c[T]he law prefers that a witness testify to facts, based on personal knowledge, rather than opinions inferred from such facts. One of the earliest and most pervasive manifestations of the common law insistence is the rule requiring that a \"witness testifying about a fact which can be perceived by the senses must have had an opportunity to observe, and must have actually observed the fact.\u201d). \u201cA distinction should be drawn [however] between a witness who has no personal knowledge and one who has only hearsay knowledge. A person who has no personal knowledge about the subject matter of his or her testimony, i.e., the person is guessing or speculating, is an incompetent \"witness as to that matter. A witness who is testifying to information that is not admissible in evidence, such as inadmissible hearsay or privileged evidence, is a competent witness as to that matter because he or she has some personal information, but <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"573\">*573</page-number>the evidence is inadmissible because the evidence is incompetent.\u201d C. Tait &amp; E. Prescott, supra, \u00a7 6.4, p. 301.</p>\n<p id=\"b591-5\">These sources indicate that the touchstone of competence is personal knowledge. \u201cPersonal knowledge\u201d is variously described as knowledge acquired firsthand or from observation. See Black\u2019s Law Dictionary (9th Ed. 2009); 1 C. McCormick, supra, \u00a7 10, p. 47. Black\u2019s Law Dictionary (9th Ed. 2009) defines \u201cpersonal knowledge\u201d as \u201c[knowledge gained through firsthand observation or experience, as distinguished from a belief based on what someone else has said.\u201d See also Ballentine\u2019s Law Dictionary (3d Ed. 1969) (\u201c[Personal knowledge\u201d is defined as: \u201cOne\u2019s own knowledge. With more accuracy, knowledge derived from the exercise of one\u2019s own senses. ... A person\u2019s direct knowledge of anything, as distinguished from that which he learns by hearsay.\u201d [Citation omitted.]). Accordingly, the rule that a witness must testify from personal knowledge requires \u201cthat a witness testifying about a fact which can be perceived by the senses must have had an opportunity to observe, and must have actually observed that fact.\u201d 1 C. McCormick, supra, \u00a7 10, p. 47. As the Second Circuit Court of Appeals has explained: \u201cWhen A testifies that B told him of an event, A usually has personal knowledge only of <em>B\u2019s report. </em>It is B who has personal knowledge of the <em>event.\" </em>(Emphasis added.) <em>United States </em>v. <em>Stratton, </em>779 F.2d 820, 829 (2d Cir. 1985), cert5 denied, 476 U.S. 1162, 106 S. Ct. 2285, 90 L. Ed. 2d 726 (1986).</p>\n<p id=\"b591-6\">Determining whether an affiant has personal knowledge requires close examination of the averments set forth in the affidavit, and the character of such averments will depend significantly upon the nature of the underlying action. In the present case, the underlying action was a CUTPA enforcement action initiated by the attorney general on behalf of the commissioner of consumer protection pursuant to \u00a7 42-110m (a). See footnote 4 of this opinion. Accordingly, the affidavits at issue set forth the alleged CUTPA violations as repre<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"574\">*574</page-number>sented in the consumer complaints and inquiries that spurred the action.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> Fitzsimmons testified that he had <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"575\">*575</page-number>derived personal knowledge of the existence, nature and content of the complaints and inquiries from personally reviewing the complaints and the state\u2019s investigative file. From this, the trial court concluded that Fitzsimmons was not competent because he had not observed or experienced the transactions and interactions detailed in those complaints. It is clear, however, that although he lacked personal knowledge to aver to the <em>truth </em>of the allegations underlying the complaints, Fitzsimmons nonetheless was competent to represent the <em>nature and extent </em>of those complaints. See, e.g., <em>Gorman </em>v. <em>Wolpoff Abramson, LLC, </em>584 F.3d 1147, 1164 (9th Cir. 2009) (party had personal knowledge of contents of credit reports derived from reviewing reports); <em>Bryant </em>v. <em>Farmers Ins. Exchange, </em>432 F.3d 1114, 1123 (10th Cir. 2005) (\u201c[The plaintiff] states in her declaration that she reviewed all of the records of audits performed in 2000 and 2001, and she also states that the audits were prepared in a format familiar to her. Thus, insofar as her declaration repeats the reported results of those audits as she reviewed them, it cannot be said that she lacked personal knowledge of those reports.\u201d); <em>In re Japanese Electronic Products, </em>723 F.2d 238, 290 (3d Cir. 1983) (Diary entries describing statements made at a board meeting satisfied the personal knowledge requirement because the diarist regularly attended meetings and \u201c[t]he diaries are offered as business <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"576\">*576</page-number>records reflecting what went on at the . . . meetings. Undoubtedly what was said by others in attendance was hearsay as to the truth of what they said about events elsewhere. But the significance of the diaries is as a record of what transpired at the meeting.\u201d), rev\u2019d on other grounds sub nom. <em>Matsushita Electronics Industrial Co. </em>v. <em>Zenith Radio Corp., </em>475 U.S. 574, 106 S. Ct. 1348, 89 L. Ed. 2d 538 (1986).</p>\n<p id=\"b594-5\">We conclude, therefore, that the trial court improperly determined that Fitzsimmons was not a competent affiant because he lacked personal knowledge of the facts to which he had attested. Accordingly, the trial court improperly concluded that it lacked subject matter jurisdiction over the applications for the prejudgment remedy on that basis.</p>\n<p id=\"b594-6\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b594-7\">Wachovia contends that this interpretation of the competent affiant requirement violates its constitutional right to due process because it allows a court to issue an ex parte property taking on the basis of hearsay and conclusory allegations and opinions, rather than on facts within the personal knowledge of the affiant. We conclude that Wachovia\u2019s claim is inadequately briefed.</p>\n<p id=\"b594-8\">The two federal court decisions cited by Wachovia as support for this claim involved <em>as applied </em>challenges to procedural aspects of the statute that were unrelated to the probable cause requirement of the statute at issue in the present case. See <em>Connecticut </em>v. <em>Doehr, </em>501 U.S. 1, 18, 111 S. Ct. 2105, 115 L. Ed. 2d 1 (1991) (holding that earlier version of \u00a7 52-278e, as applied to intentional tort case, had violated due process by authorizing attachment without either prior notice or hearing or showing of extraordinary circumstances); <em>Shaumyan v. O\u2019Neill, </em>987 F.2d 122, 127-29 (2d Cir. 1993) (concluding that absence of both predeprivation hearing and require<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"577\">*577</page-number>ment that plaintiff post security bond was not unconstitutional as applied to contract dispute). Significantly, in each of those cases, the court had applied the three part procedural due process test set forth in <em>Mathews </em>v. <em>Eldridge, </em>424 U.S. 319, 334-35, 96 S. Ct. 893, 47 L. Ed. 2d 18 (1976), to the particular facts of the case.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> See <em>Connecticut </em>v. <em>Doehr, </em>supra, 11-12, 18; <em>Shaumyan </em>v. <em>O\u2019Neill, </em>supra, 126-28. This court has applied that same rubric. See <em>Sassone </em>v. <em>Lepore, </em>226 Conn. 773, 782, 629 A.2d 357 (1993) (\u201c[j]ust as the requirements of procedural due process are fact-bound, as a general matter, so they are fact-bound with respect to the requirements for a constitutionally acceptable order of attachment\u201d); id., 780-81 (\u201cThe issue that we must address is whether, if atrial court were to find probable cause to order a prejudgment remedy in light of these alleged facts, such an order would violate the defendants\u2019 rights to procedural due process. <em>Connecticut </em>v. <em>Doehr, </em>[supra, 11] . . . instructs us to address this issue by using the tripartite test of <em>Mathews </em>v. <em>Eldridge </em>[supra, 334-35].\u201d); <em>Calfee </em>v. <em>Usman, </em>224 Conn. 29, 36, 616 A.2d 250 (1992) (discussing defendant\u2019s claim for prejudgment remedy under three part <em>Mathews </em>test). Wachovia has provided no analysis of the <em>Mathews </em>factors. Instead, in its brief, Wachovia merely presents a laundry list of superficial factual similarities between the present case and <em>Doehr </em>or characterizations of the allegations in Fitzsimmons\u2019 affidavits that it contends render the initial prejudgment remedy unconstitutional <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"578\">*578</page-number>as applied to those facts.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> We conclude, therefore, that Wachovia\u2019s due process claim is inadequately briefed and is deemed to have been waived. See <em>Bridgeport Hospital v. Commission on Human Rights &amp; Opportunities, </em>232 Conn. 91, 115, 653 A.2d 782 (1995).</p>\n<p id=\"b596-5\">We also note that, to the extent that Wachovia\u2019s due process claim relies upon the characterization of the affidavits as conclusory or \u201crife with hearsay,\u201d any such claim, whatever its merit, is without factual basis. The trial court strictly limited its analysis to whether Fitzsimmons was a competent affiant under \u00a7 52-278e (a). Accordingly, the issue on appeal is similarly conscribed: whether Fitzsimmons satisfied the <em>competent affiant </em>requirement in \u00a7 52-278e (a) such that the trial court properly could exercise jurisdiction over the applications for prejudgment remedy. We conclude that he did because he had derived personal knowledge of the existence, nature and content of the complaints and inquiries from personally reviewing the complaints and the state\u2019s investigative file. The trial court made no probable cause determination, and therefore, had no occasion to consider the nature of the averments in the affidavit and whether they provided proper support for <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"579\">*579</page-number>the probable cause requirement of the statute; nor does this court do so.<footnotemark>17</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b597-5\">The decision is reversed and the case is remanded for further proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b597-6\">In this opinion the other justices concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b578-6\"> We note that, although one of the complaints in these consolidated cases also named Sunrise Herbal Remedies, Inc., and Sage Advice, Inc., as defendants, those companies were not parties in the attachment proceedings at issue. Therefore, in this opinion we refer to Hawk-Hoffman and Hoffman as the defendants.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b578-7\"> The state appealed from the decision of the trial court to the Appellate Court, and we thereafter granted Wachovia\u2019s motion to transfer the appeal to this court pursuant to General Statutes \u00a7 51-199 (c) and Practice Book \u00a7 65-2.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b578-8\"> General Statutes \u00a7 52-278e (a) provides: \u201cThe court or a judge of the court may allow the prejudgment remedy to be issued by an attorney without hearing as provided in sections 52-278c and 52-278d upon the filing of an affidavit sworn to by the plaintiff or any competent affiant setting forth a statement of facts sufficient to show that there is probable cause that a judgment in the amount of the prejudgment remedy sought, or in an amount greater than the amount of the prejudgment remedy sought, taking into account any known defenses, counterclaims or set-offs, will be rendered in the matter in favor of the plaintiff and that there is reasonable likelihood that the defendant (1) has hidden or will hide himself so that process cannot be served on him or (2) is about to remove himself or his property from this state or (3) is about to fraudulently dispose of or has fraudulently disposed of any of his property with intent to hinder, delay or defraud his creditors or (4) has fraudulently hidden or withheld money, property or effects which should be liable to the satisfaction of his debts.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b579-6\"> General Statutes \u00a7 42-110m (a) provides: \u201cWhenever the commissioner has reason to believe that any person has been engaged or is engaged in an alleged violation of any provision of this chapter said commissioner may proceed as provided in sections 42-110d and 42-110e or may request the Attorney General to apply in the name of the state of Connecticut to the Superior Court for an order temporarily or permanently restraining and enjoining the continuance of such act or acts or for an order directing restitution and the appointment of a receiver in appropriate instances, or both.

In such action the commissioner shall be responsible for all necessary investigative support.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b580-7\"> Although there is nothing in the record expressly indicating whether the mortgage encumbered the 35 Codfish Hill Road property, the adjacent property or both, we presume that it encompassed both properties because the state\u2019s attachments on both properties were substituted with an attachment on an escrow account containing the balance of the proceeds of the sale from both properties.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b581-7\"> General Statutes \u00a7 52-278e (d) provides: \u201cA defendant may move to dissolve or modify a prejudgment remedy allowed pursuant to this section by any proper motion or by return to the Superior Court of a signed claim form that indicates, by the checking of a box on the claim form, whether the claim is an assertion of a defense, counterclaim, set-off or exemption, an assertion that any judgment that may be rendered is adequately secured by insurance, an assertion that the amount of the prejudgment remedy is unreasonably high, a request that the plaintiff be required to post a bond to secure the defendant against any damages that may result from the prejudgment remedy, or a request that the defendant be allowed to substitute a bond for the prejudgment remedy.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b582-6\"> We note that, in its memorandum of decision, the trial court incorrectly relied upon General Statutes \u00a7 52-278c, which governs prejudgment remedies imposed <em>after </em>a hearing, rather than \u00a7 52-278e, under which the <em>ex parte </em>prejudgment remedies originally had been imposed. This distinction is not material in the present case, however, because the provision of \u00a7 52-278c on which the trial court had relied is identical to the competent affiant section of \u00a7 52-278e (a), which is the only portion of that statute that the defendants had relied on as the basis for their motions. See General Statutes \u00a7 52-278c (a) (2) (\u201c[a]n affidavit sworn to by the plaintiff or any competent affiant setting forth a statement of facts sufficient to show that there is probable cause that a judgment in the amount of the prejudgment remedy sought, or in an amount greater than the amount of the prejudgment remedy sought, taking into account any known defenses, counterclaims or set-offs, will be rendered in the matter in favor of the plaintiff\u2019).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b583-6\"> We note that the trial court addressed Fitzsimmons\u2019 personal knowledge as to the alleged CUTPA violations, and did not address his knowledge as it related to the alleged fraudulent conveyance. Accordingly, we limit our analysis to his competence as to the alleged CUTPA violations.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"9\">\n<p id=\"b583-7\"> General Statutes \u00a7 52-278e (e) provides: \u201cThe court shall proceed to hold a hearing and determine any motion made under subsection (d) of this section not later than seven business days after its filing. If the court determines at such hearing requested by the defendant that there is probable cause that judgment will be rendered in the matter in favor of the plaintiff and, if the plaintiff has relied on a ground set forth in subsection (a) of this section, that there is probable cause to believe such ground exists, the prejudgment remedy granted shall remain in effect. If the court determines there is no probable cause to believe that a judgment will be rendered in the matter in favor of the plaintiff or, if a ground set forth in subsection (a) of this section was relied on, to believe such ground exists, the prejudgment remedy shall be dissolved. An order shall be issued by the court setting forth the action it has taken.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"10\">\n<p id=\"b584-5\"> Wachovia has asserted additional claims that we do not decide on the merits. Specifically, Wachovia contends that the substitution of Ahlquist\u2019s affidavit for Fitzsimmons\u2019 affidavits deprived the trial court of subject matter jurisdiction because, by filing the substitute affidavit, the state effectively withdrew the initial affidavits and thus rendered the attachment invalid. There are two problems with this claim. First, Wachovia provides no case law support for the proposition that the mere filing of a substitute affidavit withdraws an initial affidavit, irrespective of the filing party\u2019s intent or the validity of the original affidavit. The cases cited by Wachovia address entirely different issues. Second, it is unclear whether the state intended to withdraw the initial affidavit or the trial court viewed the state\u2019s action as such an attempt. Indeed, because the trial court limited its decision to Fitzsimmons\u2019 affidavits and any discrepancies or additions between those affidavits and Ahlquist\u2019s affidavit can be attributed to the ongoing nature of the CUTPA investigation, the trial court reasonably may have viewed the \u201csubstitute\u201d affidavit as functionally a supplemental affidavit.</p>\n<p id=\"b584-6\">Wachovia also claims that, even if the court had subject matter jurisdiction, Fitzsimmons\u2019 affidavits were insufficient to establish probable cause on the date that the attachments were issued and, therefore, Wachovia\u2019s interest in the property is superior to that of the state. This claim is not ripe for our review because the trial court did not reach the issue of whether the state, if the affidavits had been proper, had established probable cause sufficient to maintain the attachments on the defendants\u2019 property. Consistent with this opinion, we leave that claim to be raised in the trial court on remand, and, therefore, we decline to review it at this juncture. See <em>State </em>v. <em>Kemah, </em>289 Conn. 411, 436, 957 A.2d 852 (2008) (claim presupposing trial court decision on remand not ripe for review); <em>Esposito </em>v. <em>Specyalski, </em>268 Conn. 336, 346, 844 A.2d 211 (2004) (to satisfy ripeness requirement of justiciability, \u201cwe must be satisfied that the case before the court does not present a hypothetical injury or a claim contingent upon some event that has not and indeed may never transpire\u201d [internal quotation marks omitted]).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"11\">\n<p id=\"b585-8\"> The defendants and Wachovia claim that the trial court\u2019s conclusion that Fitzsimmons had no personal knowledge of the facts regarding the consumer complaints is a factual determination entitled to deference. We disagree. When, as in the present case, a trial court\u2019s finding that an affiant or witness lacks personal knowledge rests upon a suspect application of law, we employ plenary review. See, e.g., <em>State </em>v. <em>William C., </em>267 Conn. 686, 703 n.18, 841 A.2d 1144 (2004) (\u201c[I]nsofar as the trial court\u2019s exclusion of the [department of children and families\u2019] records was based upon its conclusion that the defendant had failed to demonstrate the unavailability of a witness with personal knowledge of the creation of the record or the events contained within the record, the trial court was incorrect as a matter of law. For the purposes of the business records exception to the hearsay rule, the availability of a witness with such personal knowledge is immaterial.\u201d).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"12\">\n<p id=\"b586-6\"> General Statutes \u00a7 l-2z directs us to consider \u201cthe text of the statute itself and its relationship to other statutes. If, after examining such text and considering such relationship, the meaning of such text is plain and unambiguous and does not yield absurd or unworkable results, extratextual evidence of the meaning of the statute shall not be considered.\u201d In the present case, the parties do not contend that the pertinent term has a plain meaning, but, instead, draw heavily from extratextual sources concerning prejudgment remedies, generally, and \u00a7 52-278e (a), specifically. Accordingly, we do not limit our analysis to the plain language of the statute.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"13\">\n<p id=\"b588-6\"> We note that <em>Glanz </em>involved a previous version of \u00a7 52-278e, which the United States Supreme Court declared violative of due process, as applied, in <em>Connecticut </em>v. <em>Doehr, </em>501 U.S. 1, 18, 111 S. Ct. 2105, 115 L. Ed. 2d 1 (1991), because the statute did not \u201cat least requir[e] a showing of some exigent circumstance\u201d in the absence of affording a preattachment hearing. The legislature thereafter amended the statute several times. See Public Acts 1990, No. 90-149, \u00a7 3; Public Acts 1991, No. 91-315, \u00a7\u00a7 1, 5; Public Acts 1993, No. 93-431, \u00a7\u00a7 3, 10. Significantly, for our purposes, however, the requirement that a plaintiff or \u201ccompetent affiant\u201d attest to probable cause to support the attachment has been part of the statute since it was first adopted in 1973, that aspect of the statute was not at issue in <em>Doehr, </em>this court has not overruled <em>Glanz, </em>and none of the parties suggests that we do so now. We therefore continue to apply the holding of <em>Glanz </em>as it relates to the proper procedures by which a plaintiff may demonstrate probable cause to support its application for an attachment. We address the defendants\u2019 due process claim as it relates to our construction of that provision of the statute in part H of this opinion.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"14\">\n<p id=\"b592-5\"> The affidavit in support of the attachment in the CUTPA action provides in relevant part: \u201c3.
