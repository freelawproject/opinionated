See footnotes 13,15 and 19 of this opinion. It is without question that a defense attorney must furnish zealous advocacy and preserve client confidences, but, at the same time, fulfill his or her duty to the court. In addition, procedures that may be prescribed to address the problem of client perjury have the potential to deprive a defendant of his right to effective assistance of counsel and his rights to due process and a fair trial, which include his right to testify in his own defense. Despite the important issues implicated in this case, however, we cannot address them in any considered way because the state of the record and the specific facts of the present case circumscribe the scope of our review. For that reason, we also need not recite at any length the overwhelming evidence relating to the brutal assault and robbery of a fast-food deliveryman upon which the jury reasonably relied to convict the defendant of assault in the first degree in violation of General Stat<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"401\">*401</page-number>utes \u00a7 53a-59 (a) (1), robbery in the first degree in violation of General Statutes \u00a7\u00a7 53a-8 (a) and 53a-134 (a) (1), and conspiracy to commit robbery in the first degree in violation of General Statutes \u00a7\u00a7 53a-48 (a) and 53a-134 (a) (1). On the basis of this record, therefore, we affirm the trial court\u2019s judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b419-6\">The record discloses the following undisputed facts and procedural history, which must be set forth in some detail to explain the limits of our ability to address the issues raised on appeal. On February 8, 2006, Attorney Robert Berke was appointed as a special public defender to represent the defendant in connection with the aforementioned charges. Trial before a jury began on August 14, 2007, with <em>Hadden, J., </em>presiding. On August 20, after the state had presented its case-in-chief, Berke made the following statement to alert the court to a potential ethical issue: \u201cI\u2019d just like to place the court on notice, I think that tomorrow I would likely . . . ask the court to allow my client to testify in the narrative. And the Rules of Professional Conduct require me to make that request. I\u2019m not confident that conclusion has been reached by myself or my client that he will testify but in the event that he does I just want to tell the court I intend to do that.\u201d The state responded that, \u201cif this scenario does take place . . . there can be no reference to the defendant\u2019s testimony in closing argument on behalf of counsel.\u201d The trial court; decided to wait until the following day to address the issue, at which time another judge, <em>Alexander, J., </em>presided over the matter.</p>\n<p id=\"b419-7\">After meeting with Berke and Patrick Griffin, a senior assistant state\u2019s attorney, in chambers, Judge Alexander held a hearing, at which the defendant also was present. At that hearing, Berke moved to withdraw as counsel, citing \u201cethical responsibilities that I have to the administration of justice and to the courts and system in pursuing certain facts that cannot be placed before the Judge <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"402\">*402</page-number>by me as a commissioner of the Superior Court.\u201d Berke noted that this issue applied only if the defendant took the stand to testify and he stated that \u201c[tjhere are other defense witnesses that these issues do not have any impact on.\u201d In the alternative, should the court deny his motion to withdraw, Berke asked that the defendant be permitted to testify in the narrative form, rather than the usual question and answer form. Berke confirmed that he was relying on rule 3.3 (a) (3) of the Rules of Professional Conduct, which provides that a \u201clawyer shall not knowingly . . . [o]ffer evidence that the lawyer knows to be false.\u201d<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Berke declined to \u201c[give] the court a lot of detail . . . [because he had] an obligation to [his] client not to do that.\u201d On the basis of Berke\u2019s representations, the court denied his request to withdraw, but granted his request to have the defendant testify in the narrative should he decide to testify.</p>\n<p id=\"b420-6\">Judge Alexander then conducted the following canvass of the defendant on this issue:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b420-7\">\u201cThe Court: ... All right. With respect to this, Mr. Chambers, I have to go over some things with you if you do choose to testify. Obviously, you have a right not to testify in a criminal trial and it\u2019s not held against you. Do you understand that, yes or no?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b420-8\">\u201c[The Defendant]: Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b420-9\">\u201cThe Court: With respect to this, the court in fact gives a particular instruction that tells juries . . . not to, in fact, use that against you. ... So, basically, it becomes as in any criminal case, the state\u2019s responsibility to show that you\u2019re guilty beyond a reasonable doubt. You understand that?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b421-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"403\">*403</page-number>\u201c[The Defendant]: Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b421-6\">\u201cThe Court: Okay. Now, if your lawyer, in fact, is not required to question you, do you understand that the jury is going to have a much different impression of your testimony?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b421-7\">\u201c[The Defendant]: Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b421-8\">\u201cThe Court: Okay. So, obviously, everyone else has been questioned, back and forth by the lawyers, all that\u2019s going to happen in this case is that he is going to say, tell the jury what happened, and you\u2019re just going to go. Okay?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b421-9\">\u201c[The Defendant]: I understand.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b421-10\">\u201cThe Court: And you\u2019re going to be giving up any claim that this was ineffective counsel because the court is not allowing him to question you. Do you understand that?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b421-11\">\u201c[The Defendant]: Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b421-12\">\u201cThe Court: And you\u2019re making the decision over your right to remain silent. To, in fact, give up that right and go before the jury. Okay?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b421-13\">\u201c[The Defendant]: Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b421-14\">\u201cThe Court: Now, with respect to this, that also means that he is not going to be able to help you with the cross-examination, unless it is a \u2014 basically a rule of evidence, such that potentially is going to require . . . no answer. In other words, if Mr. Griffin brings up something that could be self-incrimination in another case, you would have the right to stand up and object. But, otherwise, if it has to do with the facts of this case, or with your credibility, or with your prior criminal history, there\u2019s going to be no lawyer representing you during that cross-examination. Do you understand that?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b421-15\">\u201c[The Defendant]: Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b422-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"404\">*404</page-number>\u201cThe Court: Okay. And what I\u2019m referring to, Mr. Berke, because I know you look quizzical, obviously, Mr. Griffin couldn\u2019t go into areas of unsolved crimes. So, that\u2019s what I\u2019m suggesting. I\u2019m not suggesting he would, but as his attorney you would obviously have, I think, that right and obligation to prevent [the defendant] from incrimination on other matters. But do you understand that once Mr. Griffin starts going, you\u2019re going to have to answer all of [the] questions?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b422-6\">\u201c[The Defendant]: Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b422-7\">\u201cThe Court: And you can\u2019t stop, and you\u2019re not going to have a lawyer to say \u2018objection.\u2019</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b422-8\">\u201c[The Defendant]: I understand.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b422-9\">\u201cThe Court: And, so you\u2019re going to be in a much different position than any other witness.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b422-10\">\u201c[The Defendant]: I understand.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b422-11\">* * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b422-12\">\u201cThe Court: . . . But the rule that will be followed, so you\u2019re clear ... is the following: You take the stand. You take it at your own risk. You are not going to have this counsel represent you. You\u2019re just going to have to do a narrative with nobody stopping; you\u2019re just going to talk. If there\u2019s objectionable things that come out, the state\u2019s going to object; the court\u2019s going to stop you. The court will redirect you as to what areas you can talk about. You\u2019re going to be limited as to whether or not any objections are made on your behalf. You\u2019re going to be questioned about your testimony in your motion to suppress. You\u2019re going to be questioned about your statements, both written and oral. You\u2019re going to be questioned about your letters. It\u2019s not going to be limited to what you say. Do you understand all of that?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b422-13\">\u201c[The Defendant]: Yes.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b423-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"405\">*405</page-number>Berke then raised the question of how the defendant\u2019s testimony could be presented to the jury in closing argument. Berke proposed that, although he ethically could not discuss the defendant\u2019s testimony, the defendant should be allowed to present such argument on his own behalf. Judge Alexander decided that it was premature to rule definitively on this issue, noting that \u201cthat may be something actually Judge Hadden can rule on once the testimony is in . . . .\u201d Nonetheless, Judge Alexander conducted the following extensive canvass of the defendant regarding closing argument:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b423-6\">\u201cThe Court: . . . Now, with respect to this, again, the court is going to save \u2014 because there is a jury waiting \u2014 for another day whether or not this [testimony] will be argued. But do you understand that there is the potential for the court to rule that the only thing that will be given is your testimony; that the court will instruct that the jury should consider all of the testimony; that your lawyer is under no obligation based on his ethical obligations to argue that to the jury. Do you understand that?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b423-7\">\u201c[The Defendant]: Yeah.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b423-8\">\u201cThe Court: And if the court, in fact, rules that it\u2019s not going to be argued in your closing argument, then all you have done is put in facts, but there wouldn\u2019t have been an argument about those facts. Do you understand that?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b423-9\">\u201c[The Defendant]: Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b423-10\">\u201cThe Court: Okay. Now, if the court does decide to allow you to make a comment on that, do you understand, again, that you\u2019d be very restricted on the comments? You\u2019d be limited to exactly what you said, in essence. And you wouldn\u2019t be allowed to testily any further. Do you understand that?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b423-11\">\u201c[The Defendant]: Not quite.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b424-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"406\">*406</page-number>\u201cThe Court: Okay. Because if you go outside of what you said, outside of permissible argument about what the facts are that you said, then you\u2019re denying the state\u2019s right to cross-examine you, and the court\u2019s going to stop you.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b424-6\">\u201c[The Defendant]: Okay.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b424-7\">\u201cThe Court: [A]nd you\u2019re going to be told that you can\u2019t argue that, and they\u2019re going to be told to disregard that. And, again, you know, that\u2019s something you have to weigh when the jury\u2019s watching you, what they think about a court stopping you in your tracks and saying you can\u2019t say that and the jury can\u2019t consider that. Do you see what I\u2019m saying?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b424-8\">\u201cSo, do you understand that there is a lot of dangers, obviously, to you, that you will have given up certain rights to say that it shouldn\u2019t have happened that way if you voluntarily put yourself in that situation. Do you understand that?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b424-9\">\u201c[The Defendant]: Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b424-10\">\u201cThe Court: So, you can\u2019t claim it was an error later if you did it of your own free will \u2014 or you do this of your own free will. Do you understand that?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b424-11\">\u201c[The Defendant]: Yes.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b424-12\">Finally, Judge Alexander conducted a general canvass on the defendant\u2019s decision to testify during which the defendant confirmed that he had had sufficient time to discuss this decision with Berke, that he had made the decision to testify \u201cof [his] own free will,\u201d and that he understood that he had a right not to testify.</p>\n<p id=\"b424-13\">Following this proceeding, the case was returned to Judge Hadden for presentation of the defendant\u2019s casein-chief. Berke called two witnesses, and then called the defendant to testify. Before the defendant began his testimony, the trial court gave a preliminary instrac<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"407\">*407</page-number>tion to the jury explaining the narrative form of testimony and cautioning the jury not to treat the defendant\u2019s testimony differently merely because it was being presented in this form.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Following that instruction, Berke asked the defendant one question \u2014 \u201cCould you tell this jury what happened on January 16, [2006] and after that?\u201d \u2014 and the defendant responded in the narrative for a period of time approximating eight pages of transcription. During his testimony, the defendant blamed the robbery and assault on his two coconspirators, claiming that they had confessed to stealing a car and committing a robbery. The defendant claimed to have had no involvement in the incident, and further claimed that he had been \u201cforced into giving [and] signing a statement [to the police].\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b425-6\">On cross-examination, the defendant admitted to committing perjury several times throughout the case, and even acknowledged that he had \u201cperjured [himself]\u201d during his trial testimony.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark>\n<footnotemark>6</footnotemark>The defendant also <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"408\">*408</page-number>acknowledged that, for the jury to acquit him, they \u201cwould have had to believe perjured testimony.\u201d<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b426-6\">Following the defendant\u2019s testimony, Berke rested for the defense. Berke then once again moved to withdraw as counsel, claiming that he would be restricted in his closing argument.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> Ultimately, Judge Hadden denied Berke\u2019s motion to withdraw, but ruled that both the defendant, limited to his own testimony, and Berke, limited to the remainder of the evidence, could present closing argument. Specifically, Judge Hadden stated: \u201cI understand the position of counsel is that the ethical code prohibits him from participating in the testimony of the defendant in that it is counsel\u2019s belief that such testimony was perjury. Let me also indicate that I do believe that it is inappropriate for counsel to then comment directly on the contents of the defendant\u2019s testimony, in light of those facts. However, to allow counsel to withdraw, I believe, at this stage of the proceedings, would be prejudicial to [the defendant]; also, it would be impossible to appoint any additional counsel to represent [the defendant] since that new counsel would obviously face exactly the same ethical problem that Attorney Berke faces. I do believe that Attorney Berke will have the opportunity to appropriately give a summation on all of the other aspects of this case and all of the other evidence that was presented. And in light of the circumstances, you now have time to prepare, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"409\">*409</page-number>and you can so advise [the defendant] that if he wishes to . . . directly argue his testimony to the jury, I\u2019ll give him the opportunity to do that. I would expect counsel to explain to him what argument is. He will have eveiy opportunity to present such argument as he feels is necessary. You, Attorney Berke, can make any comment regarding the rest of the case. The total argument by counsel and by [the defendant], if he chooses to participate, will be one hour.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b427-6\">Before closing arguments were to commence, Judge Hadden asked whether the defendant intended to participate in final arguments. Berke explained that he and the defendant would make that decision after the state\u2019s closing argument. At that point, the court reminded the defendant of his right to \u201cparticipate in the argument,\u201d but noted that, \u201cshould [he] choose to address the jury, it is . . . not the time for additional testimony\u201d and that he must \u201csimply summarize . . . the evidence.\u201d After the state concluded its closing argument, the following discussion occurred relating to the decision of the defense to waive closing argument:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b427-7\">\u201cMr. Berke: Your Honor, on behalf of [the defendant] I\u2019m waiving my right to closing argument.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b427-8\">\u201cThe Court: All right. Mr. Chambers, do you understand that your attorney has waived the right to final argument?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b427-9\">\u201cThe Defendant: Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b427-10\">\u201cThe Court: Do you agree with that decision?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b427-11\">\u201cThe Defendant: Yes, I do.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b427-12\">Thereafter, the trial court charged the jury. The next day, the jury returned a guilty verdict on all counts. The trial court thereafter rendered judgment and sen-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"410\">*410</page-number>fenced the defendant in accordance with the verdict.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> This appeal followed. See footnote 1 of this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b428-6\">On appeal, the defendant claims that he was denied his rights to due process and a fair trial for several reasons. First, he claims that he improperly was excluded from proceedings that were critical to the trial court\u2019s acceptance of Berke\u2019s request to have the defendant testify in the narrative upon Berke\u2019s invocation of rule 3.3 of the Rules of Professional Conduct, specifically, the discussion in chambers with Judge Alexander. Second, he claims that, prior to accepting that invocation of rule 3.3, the trial court improperly failed to conduct an evidentiary hearing on the record to determine that Berke\u2019s \u201cknowledge\u201d that the defendant intended to offer false testimony satisfied the requirements of that rule. Lastly, the defendant claims that, even accepting as true that Berke had met the requirements of rule 3.3 (a) (3), the trial court\u2019s rulings on the procedures to be employed in this case \u2014 that the defendant had to testify in a narrative form, that Berke could not make all pertinent objections on the defendant\u2019s behalf during the state\u2019s cross-examination and that Berke\u2019s closing arguments had to be circumscribed \u2014 were constitutionally excessive. Because neither the defendant nor Berke raised the issue of the defendant\u2019s alleged absence from critical proceedings or any issue regarding what procedure is due before a trial court may accept counsel\u2019s invocation of rule 3.3 and restrict a defendant\u2019s right to testify, the defendant seeks review of those claims under both <em>State </em>v. <em>Golding, </em>213 Conn. 233, 567 A.2d 823 (1989),<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> and this court\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"411\">*411</page-number>supervisory authority. We conclude that the defendant\u2019s first claim is not supported by an adequate record, that his second claim fails on the merits under the particular circumstances of the present case and that his third claim fails in part because it is not supported by the facts in the record and in part because it was waived.</p>\n<p id=\"b429-6\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b429-7\">We begin with the defendant\u2019s claim that he improperly was excluded from the in-chambers meeting with Judge Alexander that preceded the hearing at which the judge canvassed the defendant and rendered her rulings regarding the ethical dilemma raised by Berke\u2019s conclusion that the defendant intended to commit perjury if he testified. The defendant contends that this meeting was a critical stage of his prosecution at which he was entitled to be present. Although the state addresses the merits of the claim, it first argues that this claim is not reviewable because the defendant has failed to provide this court with an adequate record. We agree with the state that the record is inadequate for us to review the claim on direct appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b429-8\">It is well settled that a criminal defendant has a constitutional right to be present at all critical stages of his or her prosecution. <em>Rushen </em>v. <em>Spain, </em>464 U.S. 114, 117, 104 S. Ct. 453, 78 L. Ed. 2d 267 (1983) (\u201cthe right to personal presence at all critical stages of the trial and the right to counsel are fundamental rights of each criminal defendant\u201d). Indeed, \u201c[a] defendant\u2019s right to be present ... is scarcely less important to the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"412\">*412</page-number>accused than the right of trial itself.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Simino, </em>200 Conn. 113, 127, 509 A.2d 1039 (1986). \u201cAlthough the constitutional right to be present is rooted to a large extent in the confrontation clause of the sixth amendment, courts have recognized that this right is protected by the due process clause in situations when the defendant is not actually confronting witnesses or evidence against him. <em>Snyder </em>v. <em>Massachusetts, </em>291 U.S. 97, 105-106, 108, 54 S. Ct. 330, 78 L. Ed. 674 (1934); see <em>State </em>v. <em>Jarzbek, </em>204 Conn. 683, 691-92, 529 A.2d 1245 (1987) (recognizing that right to be present similarly is guaranteed by article first, \u00a7 8, of our state constitution), cert. denied, 484 U.S. 1061,108 S. Ct. 1017, 98 L. Ed. 2d 982 (1988). In judging whether a particular segment of a criminal proceeding constitutes a critical stage of a defendant\u2019s prosecution, courts have evaluated the extent to which a fair and just hearing would be thwarted by [the defendant\u2019s] absence or whether his presence has a relation, reasonably substantial, to the fulness of his opportunity to defend against the charge. <em>Kentucky </em>v. <em>Stincer, </em>482 U.S. 730, 745, 107 S. Ct. 2658, 96 L. Ed. 2d 631 (1987).\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Lopez, </em>271 Conn. 724, 732, 859 A.2d 898 (2004).</p>\n<p id=\"b430-6\">The defendant claims that there were discussions conducted in chambers regarding the ethical dilemma raised by Berke and that this meeting constituted a critical stage of his prosecution. As we recently have acknowledged, although \u201can in camera inquiry regarding a potential conflict of interest may constitute a critical stage of a prosecution ... it does not follow that all in-chambers discussions constitute a critical stage of the prosecution. . . . Applying the test set forth in <em>Lopez </em>to determine whether a particular in camera proceeding qualifies as a critical stage of the prosecution is a necessarily fact intensive inquiry. Thus, it is imperative that the record reveal the scope of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"413\">*413</page-number>discussion that transpired.\u201d (Citations omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Bonner, </em>290 Conn. 468, 492, 964 A.2d 73 (2009).</p>\n<p id=\"b431-6\">In the present case, the only evidence <em>in the record </em>regarding what transpired in chambers consists of two passing references by Judge Alexander indicating merely that there had been such a meeting.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> Therefore, as in <em>Bonner, </em>we find that the record is deficient in this regard. \u201c[Ajpart from a few oblique references, the record does not reveal, in any useful detail, the scope of the discussions that transpired. Thus, we are left to speculate as to whether the [in camera] conversation^] consisted of the court and counsel conducting an extensive discussion as to [the defendant\u2019s intent to commit perjury] at one end of the spectrum or, at the opposite end, a brief comment to the court that there was a matter that needed to be placed on the record, or . . . dialogue that fell somewhere in between. As a result, we cannot determine the extent to which a fair and just hearing would have been thwarted by the defendant\u2019s absence or whether his presence has a reasonably substantial relation to the fullness of his opportunity to defend against the criminal charges.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.)

His counsel did not request a hearing on this matter in the trial court to create a record for appellate review. Nor did he move for an articulation or rectification of the record. See <em>Bingham </em>v. <em>Dept. of Public Works, </em>286 Conn. 698, 704 n.5, 945 A.2d 927 (2008) (motion for articulation or rectification is proper \u201cwhere the trial court has failed to state the basis of a decision ... to clarify the legal basis of a ruling ... or to ask the trial judge to rule on an overlooked matter\u201d [internal quotation marks omitted]). We will not speculate about the constitutional significance of the in-chambers discussions or reverse the defendant\u2019s conviction on the basis of that speculation. Accordingly, irrespective of whether review is sought under <em>Golding </em>or pursuant to our supervisory authority, we conclude that the record is inadequate for us to review the defendant\u2019s constitutional challenge to his absence from that proceeding.</p>\n<p id=\"b432-7\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b432-8\">The defendant next claims that, prior to accepting Berke\u2019s invocation of rule 3.3 (a) (3), Judge Alexander improperly failed to conduct any inquiry on the record to determine whether Berke\u2019s \u201cknowledge\u201d of the defendant\u2019s intent to commit perjury met the require<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"415\">*415</page-number>ments of that rule. See footnote 2 of this opinion. Essentially, the defendant asks this court to adopt a standard for trial courts to apply when determining whether an attorney <em>knows </em>that his client intends to offer false evidence. The defendant contends that, although other courts have applied various standards, this court should adopt a \u201cmiddle ground\u201d standard, under which the trial court must find that the attorney has clear and convincing evidence that his client is going to testify falsely. He further contends that Judge Alexander could not deem this standard satisfied upon Berke\u2019s \u201cbare assertion\u201d of rule 3.3 (a) (3), but, rather, was required to conduct an evidentiary hearing to determine whether Berke\u2019s knowledge met the clear and convincing standard before limiting the defendant\u2019s testimony to the narrative form.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b433-6\">The state responds that it is unnecessary for this court to adopt a standard because our Rules of Professional <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"416\">*416</page-number>Conduct already provide for one \u2014 namely, actual knowledge. The state further maintains that it is unnecessary for this court to evaluate whether Berke\u2019s invocation of rule 3.3 (a) (3) was a sufficient basis to establish actual knowledge that the defendant intended to testify falsely because the defendant not only failed to raise this claim at trial or to challenge Berke\u2019s representations that the defendant intended to perjure himself, but also later acknowledged that he had committed perjury during his trial testimony. Therefore, the state asserts that the defendant cannot challenge that the knowledge requirement of rule 3.3 (a) (3) was satisfied. We agree in part with the state.</p>\n<p id=\"b434-6\">We agree with the state that our Rules of Professional Conduct require \u201cactual knowledge\u201d and not a mere \u201creasonable belief\u2019 by the attorney that his client intends to commit perjury.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> See Rules of Professional <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"417\">*417</page-number>Conduct 3.3, commentary; Rules of Professional Conduct 1.0 (g);<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> see also <em>United States ex rel. Wilcox </em>v. <em>Johnson, </em>555 F.2d 115, 122 (3d Cir. 1977) (reaching conclusion that federal counterpart requires \u201cactual knowledge\u201d); <em>United States </em>v. <em>Del Carpio-Cotrina, </em>733 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"418\">*418</page-number>F. Sup. 95, 99 (S.D. Fla. 1990) (same). We disagree with the state\u2019s implicit contention, however, that the fact that the Rules of Professional Conduct impose an actual knowledge standard also necessarily resolves the question of the nature of proof and the procedures by which a trial court determines whether that standard has been met. Indeed, <em>how </em>to implement the obligations imposed by rule 3.3 (a) (3) when the question of perjured testimony by a defendant arises presents a separate and distinct issue. See <em>State </em>v. <em>McDowell, </em>266 Wis. 2d 599, 635-40, 669 N.W.2d 204 (App. 2003), affd, 272 Wis. 2d 488, 681 N.W.2d 500, cert. denied, 543 U.S. 938, 125 S. Ct. 327,160 L. Ed. 2d 246 (2004). Nonetheless, we agree with the state that the defendant cannot prevail on his claim in light of Berke\u2019s uncontested representations and the defendant\u2019s conduct in response to Berke\u2019s invocation of rule 3.3 (a) (3). Therefore, we need not consider the thorny questions of whether, under other circumstances, an evidentiary hearing would be required and the nature of proof necessary to meet the actual knowledge standard of rule 3.3 (a) (3).<footnotemark>15</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b437-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"419\">*419</page-number>We first note that, \u201c[i]t long has been the practice that a trial court may rely upon certain representations made to it by attorneys, who are officers of the court and bound to make truthful statements of fact or law to the court.

Therefore, we examine his representations in the context of the competing interests at stake, namely, his duty to represent his client zealously while also adhering to his duty of fidelity to the court. See <em>Nix </em>v. <em>Whiteside, 475 </em>U.S. 157, 168, 106 S. Ct. 988, 89 L. Ed. 2d 123 (1986) (\u201c[The Rules of Professional Conduct] confirm that the legal profession has accepted that an attorney\u2019s ethical duty to advance the interests of his client is limited by an <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"421\">*421</page-number>equally solemn duty to comply with the law and standards of professional conduct; it specifically ensures that the client may not use false evidence. This special duty of an attorney to prevent and disclose frauds upon the court derives from the recognition that perjury is as much a crime as tampering with witnesses or jurors by way of promises and threats, and undermines the administration of justice.\u201d). In our view, Berke made the minimum disclosure necessary to alert the court to the problem, while declining to offer further specificity in order to maintain the defendant\u2019s confidences and to allow for his continued zealous advocacy at trial. Accordingly, we conclude that the trial court reasonably relied on his representations. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Mitchell, </em>438 Mass. 535, 552, 781 N.E.2d 1237 (stating that, in \u201cevaluating the [perjury] situation, the judge will have to rely on the representations of counsel, which of necessity will be cryptic, because counsel is the one who must make the disclosure while maintaining client confidences and allowing for continued zealous advocacy at trial\u201d), cert. denied, 539 U.S. 907, 123 S.

For example, the defendant did not contest Berke\u2019s explanation to Judge Alexander, made in the defendant\u2019s presence, that \u201cethical responsibilities [precluded Berke from] pursuing certain facts\u201d at trial, a dilemma that Berke noted applied only to the defendant\u2019s testimony. The defendant also answered in the affirmative Judge Alexander\u2019s questions as to whether he understood that, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"422\">*422</page-number>should he decide to testify in the narrative, Berke was under \u201cno obligation based on his ethical obligations to argue [the defendant\u2019s testimony] to the jury\u201d and that the defendant \u201cvoluntarily put [him]self in this situation.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b440-6\">The defendant does not claim that he did not understand the import of these statements.<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> Indeed, in the presence of the defendant, Judge Hadden clearly stated that \u201cthe position of counsel is that the ethical code prohibits him from participating in the testimony of the defendant in that it is counsel\u2019s belief that such testimony was perjury.\u201d The defendant never objected to this statement, asked for clarification or requested a hearing on this matter.</p>\n<p id=\"b440-7\">Therefore, the defendant\u2019s failure to contest the factual representations, which gave rise to the ethical dilemma, demonstrates his obvious acquiescence to Berke\u2019s statements and supports Judge Alexander\u2019s reliance on their accuracy and veracity as they pertained to the defendant\u2019s intent to perjure himself.<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> Under these circumstances, there was no need for the trial court to delve further into the basis for that determination. <footnotemark>19</footnotemark> See <em>United States </em>v. Henkel, 799 F.2d 369, 370 (7th <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"423\">*423</page-number>Cir. 1986) (defendant\u2019s failure to contradict counsel\u2019s representations, or court\u2019s assessment of ethical dilemma, confirms that counsel knew his client intended to commit perjury), cert. denied, 479 U.S. 1101, 107 S. Ct. 1327, 94 L. Ed. 2d 178 (1987).</p>\n<p id=\"b441-6\">Ill</p>\n<p id=\"b441-7\">Finally, we consider the defendant\u2019s claim that, accepting as true that the trial court properly determined that the requirements of rule 3.3 (a) (3) had been met, the trial court\u2019s rulings on the procedures to be employed in the present case were \u201cconstitutionally excessive.\u201d First, the defendant asserts that it was improper to preclude Berke from objecting during the state\u2019s cross-examination of the defendant. Second, he claims that Berke should have been permitted to address the nonperjurious portions of the defendant\u2019s testimony during closing argument. We conclude that the first claim is factually inaccurate, while the second claim was waived.</p>\n<p id=\"b441-8\">The record reveals the following additional undisputed facts relating to the first of these claims. During the canvass of the defendant on the consequences of the perjury issue, Judge Alexander explained that Berke \u201cis not going to be able to help you with the cross-examination, <em>unless it is a </em>\u2014 basically <em>a rule of evidence, such that potentially is going to require no </em>answer.\u201d (Emphasis added.) Judge Alexander later specified that there would be no objections to the facts of the case, the defendant\u2019s credibility or his criminal history. She therefore noted that the defendant was \u201cgoing to be <em>limited </em>as to whether or not any objections are made on your behalf.\u201d (Emphasis added.) During <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"424\">*424</page-number>the defendant\u2019s cross-examination and redirect, Berke either objected or responded to objections several times on the defendant\u2019s behalf. In one instance, Berke asked that the defendant be allowed to finish his response to a question. Berke later objected to a question on the ground that the state had failed to lay a foundation for the admission of a prior inconsistent statement. Berke also responded to the state\u2019s hearsay objection to certain testimony by the defendant, claiming that the testimony was not being offered for its truth. Judge Hadden did not admonish Berke for interposing any of these objections.</p>\n<p id=\"b442-6\">From the foregoing, therefore, it is clear that Berke was not prohibited from making objections during the defendant\u2019s cross-examination. Indeed, these facts and Judge Alexander\u2019s direction to Berke make it clear that Berke was limited only to the extent that he could not object to the facts relating to the defendant\u2019s perjurious testimony or to matters relating to his credibility. This procedure, however, was within the court\u2019s sound discretion considering the ethical constraints on Berke not to aid in the presentation of perjurious evidence. See L. Perrin, \u201cThe Perplexing Problem of Client Perjury,\u201d 76FordhamL. Rev. 1707,1737 (2007) (noting that, under narrative approach, attorney may object to matters of form, but not to evidence related to false testimony).</p>\n<p id=\"b442-7\">With regard to the defendant\u2019s contention that the trial court improperly prohibited Berke from making a closing argument regarding the nonperjurious portions of the defendant\u2019s testimony, we conclude that the defendant waived this claim. As we previously have noted, when Berke first raised the question about closing argument, he proposed that, although he ethically could not discuss the defendant\u2019s testimony at closing argument, the defendant should be allowed to present such argument on his own behalf. Judge Alexander determined that it was premature to rule definitively on this issue, noting that, \u201cth[is] may be something <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"425\">*425</page-number>[that] Judge Hadden can rule on once the testimony is in . . . .\u201d Nonetheless, Judge Alexander gave the following direction regarding closing argument: \u201cAttorney Berke will have the opportunity to appropriately give a summation on all of the other aspects of this case and all of the other evidence that was presented. And . . . you can so advise [the defendant] that if he wishes to . . . directly argue his testimony to the jury, I\u2019ll give him the opportunity to do that. I would expect counsel to explain to him what argument is. He will have every opportunity to present such argument as he feels is necessary. You, Attorney Berke, can make any comment regarding the rest of the case. The total argument by counsel and by [the defendant], if he chooses to participate, will be one hour.\u201d Following the defendant\u2019s testimony, and after the defense rested, Berke moved to withdraw as counsel on the ground that he would be restricted in his closing argument for the defendant. As part of his decision denying Berke\u2019s motion, Judge Hadden ruled that both the defendant, limited to his own testimony, and Berke, limited to the remainder of the evidence, could present closing argument. Neither Berke nor the defendant ever claimed that Berke should be permitted to argue portions of the defendant\u2019s testimony that were nonperjurious. Thereafter, Berke informed Judge Hadden that he had decided to waive closing argument. Judge Hadden expressly inquired whether the defendant understood and agreed with that decision, to which the defendant twice responded in the affirmative. Therefore, the defendant\u2019s claim that Berke should have been allowed to argue portions of the defendant\u2019s testimony was waived. Accordingly, we do not consider this claim on the merits.<footnotemark>20</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b443-6\">The judgment is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b443-7\">In this opinion the other justices concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b417-13\"> The defendant, Robert Chambers, appealed from the judgment of the trial court to the Appellate Court, and we transferred the appeal to this court pursuant to General Statutes \u00a7 51-199 (c) and Practice Book \u00a7 65-1.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b418-7\"> Rule 3.3 (a) of the Rules of Professional Conduct provides in relevant part: \u201cA lawyer shall not knowingly ...

These standards include: \u201cgood cause to believe,\u201d \u201cknowledge beyond a reasonable doubt,\u201d \u201ca firm factual basis,\u201d and \u201ca good faith determination\u201d that a client intends to testify falsely; <em>State </em>v. <em>Hischke, </em>639 N.W.2d 6, 7-8 (Iowa 2002); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Mitchell, </em>438 Mass. 535, 545-46, 781 N.E.2d 1237, cert. denied, 539 U.S. 907, 123 S. Ct. 2253, 156 L. Ed. 2d 118 (2003); as well as \u201ccompelling support\u201d for concluding that the client will commit perjury, and \u201cactual knowledge\u201d for such a conclusion. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Mitchell, </em>supra, 545-46; see also E. Kimball, commentary, \u201cWhen Does A Lawyer \u2018Know\u2019 Her Client Will Commit Perjury?,\u201d 2 Geo. J. Legal Ethics 579, 581 (1988-1989) (arguing that rule 3.3 should be interpreted to mean that lawyer \u201cis subject to sanction [for using false evidence] when she [1] subjectively has thought about the possibility of falsify, and [2] has no reasonable doubt that the proposed testimony would be false\u201d); N. Lefstein, \u201cClient Perjury in Criminal Cases: Still in Search of An Answer,\u201d 1 Geo. J. Legal Ethics 521, 528 (1987-1988) (\u201ccounsel should not judge the client\u2019s testimony as false unless there is absolutely no doubt about the matter\u201d); C. Rieger, \u201cClient Perjury: A Proposed Resolution of the Constitutional and Ethical Issues,\u201d 70 Minn. L. Rev. 121, 149 (1985-1986) (arguing that counsel should not judge client\u2019s testimony as false unless there is no doubt about matter). Although we need not in the present case elaborate to any extent about the meaning of actual knowledge, the pertinent rules and commentary; see footnotes 2 and 14 of this opinion; make it clear that an attorney, before invoking the rule, must act in good faith and have a firm basis in objective fact. Conjecture or <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"417\">*417</page-number>speculation that the defendant intends to testily falsely would not be enough. Nor would mere inconsistencies in the evidence or in the defendant\u2019s version of events translate to actual knowledge, even though they may raise concerns in counsel\u2019s mind.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"14\">\n<p id=\"b435-7\"> The commentary to rule 3.3 (a) (3) of the Rules of Professional Conduct provides: \u201cSubsection (a) (3) requires that the lawyer refuse to offer evidence that the lawyer knows to be false, regardless of the client\u2019s wishes. This duty is premised on the lawyer\u2019s obligation as an officer of the court to prevent the trier of fact from being misled by false evidence. A lawyer does not violate this Rule if the lawyer offers the evidence for the purpose of establishing its falsity.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b435-8\">\u201cIf a lawyer knows that the client intends to testify falsely or wants the lawyer to introduce false evidence, the lawyer should seek to persuade the client that the evidence should not be offered. If the persuasion is ineffective and the lawyer continues to represent the client, the lawyer must refuse to offer the false evidence. If only a portion of a witness\u2019 testimony will be false, the lawyer may call the witness to testify but may not elicit or otherwise permit the witness to present the testimony that the lawyer knows is false.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b435-9\">\u201cThe duties stated in subsections (a) and (b) apply to all lawyers, including defense counsel in criminal cases. In some jurisdictions, however, courts have required counsel to present the accused as a witness or to give a narrative statement if the accused so desires, even if counsel knows that the testimony or statement will be false. The obligation of the advocate under the Rules of Professional Conduct is subordinate to such requirements.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b435-10\"><em>\u201cThe prohibition against offering false evidence only applies if the lawyer knows that the evidence is false. A lawyer\u2019s reasonable belief that evidence is false does not preclude its presentation to the trier of fact. A lawyer\u2019s knowledge that evidence is false, however, can be inferredfrom the circumstances. </em>See [Rules of Professional Conduct] 1.0 (g). Thus, although a lawyer should resolve doubts about the veracity of testimony or other evidence in favor of the client, the lawyer cannot ignore an obvious falsehood.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b435-11\">\u201cBecause of the special protections historically provided criminal defendants, however, <em>this Rule does not permit a lawyer to refuse to offer the testimony of such a client where the lawyer reasonably believes but does not know that the testimony will be false. Unless the lawyer knows the testimony will be false, the lawyer must honor the client\u2019s decision to testify.\" </em>(Emphasis added.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b435-12\">Rule 1.0 (g) of the Rules of Professional Conduct provides: \u201c \u2018Knowingly,\u2019 \u2018known,\u2019 or \u2018knows\u2019 denotes actual knowledge of the fact in question. A person\u2019s knowledge may be inferred from circumstances.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"15\">\n<p id=\"b436-6\"> A survey of case law reveals that how such actual knowledge is ascertained can raise troubling concerns. One jurisdiction has stated that, \u201cabsent the most extraordinary circumstances, [a] criminal defense counsel, as a matter of law, cannot know that a client is going to testily falsely absent the client\u2019s admission of the intent to do so.\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>MeDowell, </em>supra, 266 Wis. 2d 638-39; id., 637 (\u201cWith a lesser standard [than requiring the client to admit to counsel an intent to testify falsely] . . . [h]ow, really, would counsel \u2018know,\u2019 absent [such] an admission from the defendant? And then, what would be counsel\u2019s corresponding dufy? In trial preparation, would counsel investigate the facts in order to advocate zealously, or to determine the veracity of a client\u2019s account? Should counsel refrain from looking too carefully at the facts for fear of concluding that a client\u2019s account is false? Without a client\u2019s admission of intent to testify falsely, counsel sails swirling seas, changeable from one moment to the next, without a single star by which to chart a course.\u201d). Another court has concluded that the beyond a reasonable doubt standard essentially would eviscerate rule 3.3 because it would be \u201cvirtually impossible to satisfy unless the lawyer had a direct confession from his or her client or personally witnessed the event in question.\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Hischke, </em>639 N.W.2d 6, 10 (Iowa 2002).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"16\">\n<p id=\"b438-7\"> We presume that, when Berke invoked rule 3.3 (a) (3), he did so mindful of the actual knowledge standard imposed therein, and only after adhering to his obligations under the rule, which instructs that, \u201c[i]f a lawyer knows that the client intends to testify falsely or wants the lawyer to introduce false evidence, the lawyer should seek to persuade the client that the evidence should not be offered. If the persuasion is ineffective and the lawyer continues to represent the client, the lawyer must refuse to offer the false evidence.\u201d Rules of Professional Conduct 3.3 (a) (3), commentary. The defendant does not claim otherwise.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"17\">\n<p id=\"b440-8\"> Although the defendant does not claim in the present case that he failed to understand either Berke\u2019s invocation of rule 3.3 or the basis for Judge Alexander\u2019s decision that the defendant could testify only in the narrative form, we note that it is the far better practice for trial courts to ensure, on the record, that the defendant fully understands the basis for his counsel\u2019s invocation of rule 3.3 (a) (3).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"18\">\n<p id=\"b440-9\"> Indeed, in light of the defendant\u2019s admission to having committed perjury on several occasions throughout this case; see footnote 5 of this opinion; the defendant would be hard-pressed to claim that he was harmed by the trial court\u2019s reliance on Berke\u2019s representation.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"19\">\n<p id=\"b440-10\"> Therefore, we do not decide whether, under other circumstances, atrial court should conduct an evidentiary hearing and whether other witnesses could be called and a new attorney appointed. We note, however, that some commentators have suggested that such procedures during trial could risk interfering with the confidentiality between the defendant and his counsel. See generally N. Lefstein, \u201cClient Perjury in Criminal Cases: Still in Search of An Answer,\u201d 1 Geo. J. Legal Ethics 521, 540 (1987-1988); note, \u201cCriminal Defendant Perjury: A Lawyer\u2019s Choice Between Ethics, the Constitution, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"423\">*423</page-number>and the Truth,\u201d 28 New Eng. L. Rev. 881, 902 (1994). Other courts have suggested that a defendant should pursue an evidentiary hearing in aposttrial habeas proceeding when an adequate record can be made without any undue strain on an existing attorney-client relationship. See, e.g., <em>Brown </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>226 S.W.3d 74, 90 n.4 (Ky. 2007). We express no opinion on either option.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"20\">\n<p id=\"b443-8\"> We note that, although the defendant has placed a constitutional tag on this claim in his brief to this court, he does not invoke <em>State </em>v. <em>Golding, </em>supra, 213 Conn. 233, as he has for his first two claims; see footnote 9 of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"426\">*426</page-number>this opinion; nor does the defendant cite any authority for his claim that the restriction on Berke\u2019s ability to argue the nonperjurious portions of his testimony was unconstitutional.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
