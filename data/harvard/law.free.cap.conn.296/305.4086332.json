We disagree that the defendant is exempt from registering under \u00a7 54-251 (a) and, accordingly, affirm the decision of the trial court.</p>\n<p id=\"b325-6\">The following relevant facts and procedural history are not in dispute. On January 19, 2005, the defendant <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"308\">*308</page-number>pleaded guilty under the <em>Alford </em>doctrine<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> to two counts of reckless endangerment in the second degree in violation of General Statutes \u00a7 53a-64<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> and one count of unlawful restraint in the second degree in violation of General Statutes \u00a7 53a-96.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> These charges were based on the defendant\u2019s allegedly inappropriate sexual contact with the intimate parts of a ten year old female. The trial court sentenced the defendant to a total effective sentence of two years, execution suspended, and three years probation with special conditions. In addition, because the offense of unlawful restraint in the second degree involved a victim who, at the time of the offense, was under eighteen years of age, the defendant was required to comply with the registration requirements of \u00a7 54-251 (a).<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> At the time of sentencing, however, the trial court mistakenly informed the defendant that the offenses of which he had been convicted did not require him to register as a sex offender.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> In accordance with <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"309\">*309</page-number>the court\u2019s advisement, the defendant did not register as a sex offender.</p>\n<p id=\"b327-6\">On November 2, 2005, the defendant was charged under General Statutes \u00a7 53a-32<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> with violating the terms of his probation.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> On June 16, 2006, a probation violation hearing was held at which the defendant admitted to violating the terms of his probation. At that hearing, the court advised the defendant that, at the time he had entered his <em>Alford </em>plea, the court mistakenly had informed him that the charges to which he had pleaded did not require him to register under \u00a7 54-251 (a). The court further explained that, contrary to what the defendant had been advised when he entered his <em>Alford </em>plea, he was, in fact, required to register as a sex offender.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> The state agreed with the court that the defendant was required to register under \u00a7 54-251 (a). At the conclusion of the hearing, the court did not revoke the defendant\u2019s probation but, instead, continued the proceeding for three months for the purpose of monitoring the defendant\u2019s compliance with the terms of his probation. Thereafter, on June 26, 2006, the defendant registered as a sex offender pursuant to \u00a7 54-251 (a).</p>\n<p id=\"b327-7\">On September 18, 2006, the defendant, who was represented by new counsel, filed a motion to vacate his <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"310\">*310</page-number>\u201cplea\u201d<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> with respect to the violation of probation charge on the ground that, at the time of that plea, the court had not substantially complied with the plea canvass provisions of Practice Book \u00a7 39-19. The claims that the defendant raised in support of his contention that he was entitled to withdraw his plea with respect to the violation of probation charge axe not relevant to this appeal. The defendant also sought \u201crelief from the registration requirement\u201d of \u00a7 54-251 (a) due to the fact that the court had failed to inform him, when he entered his <em>Alford </em>plea, that he was subject to that requirement. According to defense counsel, this result was dictated by the mandatory language of \u00a7 54-251 (a), which entitled the defendant to notice of the registration requirement before the court accepted his <em>Alford </em>plea to the offense of unlawful restraint in the second degree. Defense counsel indicated that requiring the defendant to register as a sex offender effectively altered the terms of his plea agreement with the state. Finally, defense counsel informed the court that, if it declined to grant the defendant the relief that he sought with respect to the registration requirement, the defendant would seek to withdraw his <em>Alford </em>plea. Thereafter, the trial court granted the defendant\u2019s motion to vacate his plea with respect to the probation violation charge but denied his request for relief from the requirement of \u00a7 54-251 (a) that he register as a sex offender.</p>\n<p id=\"b328-6\">On September 25,2006, the defendant again admitted to violating the terms of his probation, and he again sought to be relieved of the requirement that he register as a sex offender. The trial court denied the defendant\u2019s request and continued the case for sentencing on the violation of probation charge. At that sentencing hearing on January 23, 2007, the trial court continued the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"311\">*311</page-number>defendant\u2019s probation. Once again, the defendant sought to be relieved of the requirement that he register as a sex offender. The court denied the defendant\u2019s request and informed him that his recourse was to take an appeal from the court\u2019s ruling to the Appellate Court. Thereafter, the defendant appealed to the Appellate Court, claiming that the trial court improperly had denied his request for relief from the registration requirement of \u00a7 54-251 (a), and we transferred the appeal to this court pursuant to General Statutes \u00a7 51-199 (c) and Practice Book \u00a7 65-1. On appeal, the defendant renews his claim that he is exempt from registering as a sex offender under \u00a7 54-251 (a) because of the trial court\u2019s failure to inform him of that requirement prior to accepting his <em>Alford </em>plea.</p>\n<p id=\"b329-6\">Before addressing the merits of the defendant\u2019s claim, we first consider the state\u2019s contention that this court lacks subject matter jurisdiction over this appeal because the trial court\u2019s ruling directing the defendant to register as a sex offender in accordance with \u00a7 54-251 (a) is not an appealable final judgment.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> In support of this claim, the state contends that such a decision is reviewable only when a defendant challenges the factual underpinnings that form the basis for mandatory registration under \u00a7 54-251 (a): e.g., whether the victim was under the age of eighteen or whether the offense constituted a nonviolent sexual offense. In all other cases, the state asserts, \u201cthe obligation to register as a sex offender is triggered by the entry of the judgment of conviction, not by the court\u2019s advisement that the law mandates the defendant\u2019s compliance with mandatory <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"312\">*312</page-number>registration.\u201d Thus, in the state\u2019s view, because the advisement in the present case did not form the basis of the defendant\u2019s obligation to register as a sex offender, that advisement does not constitute an appeal-able final judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b330-6\">We need not decide whether the state\u2019s contention might have merit in some other case because, in the present case, the trial court expressly informed the defendant when he entered his <em>Alford </em>plea that he had no obligation to register as a sex offender. At that time, there was nothing concerning the issue of sex offender registration under \u00a7 54-251 (a) that the defendant had reason to challenge on appeal. Only later, after the trial court informed the defendant that he was required to register pursuant to \u00a7 54-251 (a), did he then have a basis for an appeal. In other words, the defendant was not aggrieved until the court informed him, contrary to the court\u2019s earlier advisement, that he was required to register as a sex offender, and a party does not have standing to appeal unless that party is aggrieved by a decision of the trial court. See, e.g., <em>State </em>v. <em>T.D., </em>286 Conn. 353, 358, 944 A.2d 288 (2008) (\u201cAggrievement implicates both the [party\u2019s] standing and this court\u2019s subject matter jurisdiction. ... To be aggrieved, a party must have a specific personal and legal interest in the subject matter of the litigation and, further, that interest must be specially and injuriously affected by the decision at issue.\u201d [Citation omitted.]) Because the court issued its ruling directing him to register in connection with the probation violation hearing, the defendant properly raised his claim challenging the ruling on appeal from the judgment rendered by the trial court in connection with its finding of a probation violation.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b331-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"313\">*313</page-number>We turn, therefore, to the merits of the defendant\u2019s claim that the trial court incorrectly determined that he is required to register as a sex offender under \u00a7 54-251 (a) even though the court had failed to inform him of that requirement prior to accepting his <em>Alford </em>plea. The defendant contends that, because the advisement provision of \u00a7 54-251 (a) expressly provides that the court \u201cshall\u201d inform a defendant of the registration requirement prior to accepting his plea, that provision is mandatory. The defendant further contends that a fair construction of \u00a7 54-251 (a) leads to the conclusion that the court\u2019s failure to comply with that provision relieves the defendant of the registration requirement.</p>\n<p id=\"b331-6\">In light of the plain and straightforward statutory language, we, like the state, agree with the defendant that the advisement provision of \u00a7 54-251 (a) is mandatory. See, e.g., <em>Lostritto </em>v. <em>Community Action Agency of New Haven, Inc., </em>269 Conn. 10, 20, 848 A.2d 418 (2004) (\u201c[a]s we have often stated, [definitive words such as must or shall, ordinarily express legislative mandates of a nondiscretionary nature\u201d [internal quotation marks omitted]). We therefore also agree with the defendant that the court improperly failed to advise him of the registration requirement before accepting his <em>Alford </em>plea as to the offense of unlawful restraint in the second degree. We disagree with the defendant, however, with respect to his construction of \u00a7 54-251 (a) as relieving him of that requirement when, as in the present case, the court fails to comply with the advisement provision of \u00a7 54-251 (a). Indeed, there is nothing in the language or legislative history of \u00a7 54-251 (a) to suggest that the court\u2019s failure to advise a defendant of the registration requirement renders the defendant exempt from that requirement. Moreover, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"314\">*314</page-number>the registration provision of \u00a7 54-251 (a), which provides, inter alia, that a person who has been convicted of a criminal offense against a minor victim, as defined in \u00a7 54-250 (2), or a nonviolent sexual offense, as defined in \u00a7 54-250 (5), \u201cshall . . . register\u201d with the commissioner of public safety, is itself cast in mandatory terms. Thus, the interpretation of \u00a7 54-251 (a) that the defendant advances would require us to engraft language onto that provision conditioning the registration requirement on the court\u2019s compliance with the advisement requirement, something that we cannot do. See, e.g., <em>Southwick at Milford Condominium Assn., Inc. </em>v. <em>523 Wheelers Farm Road, Milford, LLC, </em>294 Conn. 311, 321, 984 A.2d 676 (2009) (court cannot rewrite statute to achieve particular result).</p>\n<p id=\"b332-6\">Furthermore, although the requirement to register as a sex offender under Megan\u2019s Law is regulatory rather than punitive in nature; e.g., <em>State </em>v. <em>Waterman, </em>264 Conn. 484, 489, 825 A.2d 63 (2003); we previously have recognized that the \u201clegislature enacted the law to protect the public from sex offenders.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Arthur H., </em>288 Conn. 582, 590, 953 A.2d 630 (2008). Because the defendant pleaded guilty to an offense the commission of which triggers the registration requirement, it would be manifestly inconsistent with the public safety purpose of the statutory scheme to construe \u00a7 54-251 (a) as exempting the defendant from that requirement merely because the court did not comply with the mandatory advisement provision. Indeed, the defendant has identified no authority, and our research has revealed none, to support the proposition that this court may uphold a plea agreement that is contrary to a clear statutory mandate.</p>\n<p id=\"b332-7\">Nevertheless, the trial court\u2019s failure to advise the defendant of the registration requirement prior to accepting his <em>Alford </em>plea violated the advisement provision of \u00a7 54-251 (a). In fact, in the present case, the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"315\">*315</page-number>court expressly informed the defendant that he was <em>not </em>required to register as a sex offender. The court\u2019s failure to comply with the mandatory advisement language of \u00a7 54-251 (a), however, did not leave the defendant without a remedy. For example, he could have sought to withdraw his <em>Alford </em>plea either because it had not been entered knowingly and voluntarily or because requiring him to register as a sex offender violated the terms of his plea agreement with the state. In short, his remedy is to challenge the conviction to which the obligation of \u00a7 54-251 (a) attaches. The defendant has elected not to seek such relief, however. Instead, he seeks relief from the registration requirement itself. For the foregoing reasons, however, we do not have the authority to relieve him of that requirement in light of his conviction of unlawful restraint in the second degree.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b333-5\">The decision of the trial court is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b333-6\">In this opinion the other justices concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b325-7\"> General Statutes \u00a7 54-251 (a) provides in relevant part: \u201cAny person who has been convicted ... of a criminal offense against a victim who is a minor or a nonviolent sexual offense, and is released into the community on or after October 1, 1998, shall, within three days following such release . . . register such person\u2019s name, identifying factors, criminal history record, residence address and electronic mail address, instant message address or other similar Internet communication identifier, if any, with the Commissioner of Public Safety, on such forms and in such locations as the commissioner shall direct, and shall maintain such registration for ten years except that any person who has one or more prior convictions of any such offense or who is convicted of a violation of subdivision (2) of subsection (a) of section 53a-70 shall maintain such registration for life. Prior to accepting a plea of guilty or nolo contendere from a person with respect to a criminal offense against a victim who is a minor or a nonviolent sexual offense, the court shall (1) inform the person that the entry of a finding of guilty after acceptance of the plea will subject the person to the registration requirements of this section, and (2) determine that the person fully understands the consequences of the plea. . . .\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b325-8\"> As this court has observed, the goal of Megan\u2019s Law, which is set forth in chapter 969 of the General Statutes, General Statutes \u00a7\u00a7 54-250 through 54-261, is to \u201calert the public by identifying potential sexual offender recidivists when necessary for public safety.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>T.R.D., </em>286 Conn. 191, 220, 942 A.2d 1000 (2008). This goal is accomplished by requiring persons convicted of certain offenses to register with the commissioner of public safety and by mandating disclosure of that registry to the public.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b326-6\"> \u201cUnder <em>North Carolina </em>v. <em>Alford, </em>400 U.S. 25, 91 S.

See General Statutes \u00a7 52-263. Thus, this court lacks subject matter jurisdiction over an appeal that is not from a final judgment. See, e.g., <em>Mazurek </em>v. <em>Great American Ins. Co., </em>284 Conn. 16, 33, 930 A.2d 682 (2007). Moreover, we must address and decide a challenge to our subject matter jurisdiction whenever the claim is raised. E.g., <em>Jolly, Inc. </em>v. <em>Zoning Board of Appeals, </em>237 Conn. 184, 192, 676 A.2d 831 (1996).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"13\">\n<p id=\"b330-7\"> The state raises the alternative claim that we should dismiss this appeal as untimely. The state concedes, however, that the timeliness of an appeal does not implicate this court\u2019s subject matter jurisdiction and, further, that the state never filed a motion to dismiss the appeal on timeliness grounds. We therefore decline the state\u2019s invitation to dismiss the appeal. See <em>Rubenstein </em>v. <em>Rubenstein, </em>107 Conn. App. 488, 499, 945 A.2d 1043 (failure <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"313\">*313</page-number>to file motion to dismiss appeal as untimely constitutes waiver of right to dismissal <em>on </em>nonjurisdictional grounds), cert. denied, 289 Conn. 948, 960 A.2d 1037 (2008).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"14\">\n<p id=\"AYX\"> At oral argument, the defendant raised the claim that it would be inequitable to require him to register as a sex offender despite the trial court\u2019s advisement to the contrary.
