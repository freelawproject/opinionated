J.</author>\n<p id=\"AYP\">The issue presented by this appeal is whether the trial court properly concluded that the employees of the named plaintiff, the department of public safety (department),<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> in the job classifications of state police lieutenant and state police captain (employees), are not managerial employees under Gen<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"596\">*596</page-number>eral Statutes \u00a7 5-270 (g)<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> and, therefore, have the right to bargain under the state employee collective bargaining law. General Statutes \u00a7\u00a7 5-270 through 5-280. The named defendant, the state board of labor relations (board), concluded that the employees were not managerial employees and, accordingly, granted the petition of the defendant Connecticut State Employees Association, SEIU Local 2001 (union), seeking certification as their exclusive bargaining representative. The department appealed from that decision to the trial court pursuant to General Statutes \u00a7 4-183 and the trial court dismissed the appeal. The department then filed this appeal.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> We reverse the judgment of the trial court on the ground that the trial court applied an improper legal standard in determining that the board properly had determined that the employees were not managerial employees.</p>\n<p id=\"b614-5\">The record reveals the following procedural history. The union filed a petition with the board seeking certification as the exclusive bargaining representative of a new bargaining unit consisting of state police lieutenants and state police captains. The board ordered an election among those employees, to which the department objected on the ground that the employees did not have the right to bargain under the state employee <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"597\">*597</page-number>collective bargaining law because, among other reasons, they met at least two of the criteria set forth in \u00a7 5-270 (g) and, therefore, were managerial employees. After the employees voted in favor of union representation, the board conducted a hearing on the department\u2019s objections. The board concluded that the employees met the criterion set forth in \u00a7 5-270 (g) (1), but did not meet any of the other three statutory criteria. Specifically, with respect to subdivision (2) of \u00a7 5-270 (g), the board concluded that \u201c[t]he evidence clearly supports a conclusion that the responsibility for the development, implementation and evaluation of goals and objectives consistent with the [department\u2019s] mission is placed at a level above that of captain. While these employees may be asked for their opinions and in select cases, individual majors and other superiors may rely heavily on them, they simply do not have and cannot exercise the level of independent judgment and involvement necessary to meet this criterion.\u201d With respect to subdivision (3) of \u00a7 5-270 (g), the board concluded that \u201cno evidence or testimony established that these employees are involved in any way, other than the occasional suggestion, in the formulation of [department] policy.\u201d With respect to subdivision (4) of \u00a7 5-270 (g), the board concluded that \u201c[t] here is no question that none of the . . . employees has any role in the administration of collective bargaining agreements.\u201d Accordingly, the board concluded that the employees were not managerial employees, dismissed the department\u2019s objections and certified the union as the employees\u2019 representative.</p>\n<p id=\"b615-5\">Thereafter, the department refused to bargain with the union<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> and the union filed an unfair labor practice <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"598\">*598</page-number>complaint with the board. The board ruled in favor of the union and ordered the department to negotiate with it. The department then appealed to the trial court. The trial court concluded that the language of \u00a7 5-270 (g) was plain and unambiguous and that the board properly had determined that subdivisions (2) and (3) of \u00a7 5-270 (g) require that \u201cthe employees at issue exercise a level of independent judgment . . . .\u201d<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Accordingly, the trial court dismissed the appeal. This appeal followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b616-5\">On appeal, the department claims that the trial court improperly deferred to the board\u2019s interpretation of \u00a7 5-270 (g) (2) and (3) and concluded that the employees were not managerial employees because the statute provides that managerial employees must exercise independent judgment in carrying out the enumerated functions. The board and the union contend that the trial court properly interpreted the statute and properly applied it to the facts of this case. We conclude that the trial court improperly construed \u00a7 5-270 (g) to include a requirement that the managerial employees exercise independent judgment in carrying out the principal functions listed in subdivisions (2) and (3).</p>\n<p id=\"b616-6\">At the outset, we set forth the standard of review. \u201cAccording to our well established standards, [r]eview of an administrative agency decision requires a court to determine whether there is substantial evidence in the administrative record to support the agency\u2019s findings of basic fact and whether the conclusions drawn from those facts are reasonable. . . . Neither this court nor the trial court may retry the case or substitute its own judgment for that of the administrative agency on the weight of the evidence or questions of fact. . . . Our ultimate duty is to determine, in view of all of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"599\">*599</page-number>evidence, whether the agency, in issuing its order, acted unreasonably, arbitrarily, illegally or in abuse of its discretion. . . . [A]n agency\u2019s factual and discretionary determinations are to be accorded considerable weight by the courts. ... It is well settled [however] that we do not defer to the board\u2019s construction of a statute\u2014 a question of law \u2014 when . . . the [provisions] at issue previously ha[v] e not been subj ected to judicial scrutiny or when the board\u2019s interpretation has not been time tested.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Christopher R. </em>v. <em>Commissioner of Mental Retardation, </em>277 Conn. 594, 603, 893 A.2d 431 (2006). A conclusion that an agency\u2019s interpretation of a statute is entitled to deference, however, \u201cdoes not end [our] inquiry. We also must determine whether the [board\u2019s] interpretation is reasonable. ... In so doing, we apply our established rules of statutory construction.\u201d (Citation omitted.) <em>Curry </em>v. <em>Allan S. Goodman, Inc., </em>286 Conn. 390, 407, 944 A.2d 925 (2008); see also <em>Vincent </em>v. <em>New Haven, </em>285 Conn. 778, 784 n.8, 941 A.2d 932 (2008) (\u201crule of deference applies only when agency \u2018has consistently followed its construction over a long period of time, <em>the statutory language is ambiguous, </em>and the agency\u2019s interpretation is reasonable\u2019 \u201d [emphasis in original]).</p>\n<p id=\"b617-5\">\u201cWhen construing a statute, [o]ur fundamental objective is to ascertain and give <em>effect to the </em>apparent intent of the legislature. ... In other words, we seek to determine, in a reasoned manner, the meaning of the statutory language as applied to the facts of [the] case, including the question of whether the language actually does apply. ... In seeking to determine that meaning, General Statutes \u00a7 l-2z<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> directs us first to consider the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"600\">*600</page-number>text of the statute itself and its relationship to other statutes. If, after examining such text and considering such relationship, the meaning of such text is plain and unambiguous and does not yield absurd or unworkable results, extratextual evidence of the meaning of the statute shall not be considered. . . . When a statute is not plain and unambiguous, we also look for interpretive guidance to the legislative history and circumstances surrounding its enactment, to the legislative policy it was designed to implement, and to its relationship to existing legislation and common law principles governing the same general subject matter . . . .\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Vincent </em>v. <em>New Haven, </em>supra, 285 Conn. 784-85.</p>\n<p id=\"b618-5\">In the present case, the department contends that, because the board\u2019s interpretation of \u00a7 5-270 (g) has not been time-tested and previously has not been subject to judicial scrutiny, the board was not entitled to deference and our review is plenary. Specifically, the department points out that the board has interpreted \u00a7 5-270 only twice; see <em>In re Connecticut State Employees Assn., SEIU Local 2001, </em>Conn. Board of Labor Relations Decision No. 4070 (August 17, 2005); <em>In re Protective Services Employees Coalition, AFL-CIO, </em>Conn. Board of Labor Relations Decision No. 3145 (October 27,1993); and that neither decision was subject to judicial review. The board and the union contend that, because the board concluded in these two decisions that certain police lieutenants who worked for various agencies and captains in the department of correction were not managerial employees under \u00a7 5-270 (g), and because the department was the employer in both decisions and did not challenge the board\u2019s decisions, the board\u2019s interpretation of the statute is time-tested and is entitled to deference.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> We agree with the department.</p>\n<p id=\"b619-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"601\">*601</page-number>In <em>Vincent </em>v. <em>New Haven, </em>supra, 285 Conn. 783-84 and n.8, this court concluded that the compensation review board\u2019s inteipretation of General Statutes (Rev. to 1989) \u00a7 31-306 was not entitled to deference because it had applied the interpretation in only two cases, the oldest of which had been decided in 1999, and neither decision had been subject to judicial review. See also <em>Christopher R. </em>v. <em>Commissioner of Mental Retardation, </em>supra, 277 Conn. 603 n.9 (\u201c[t]wo isolated cases do not indicate a time tested interpretation\u201d); cf. <em>Curry </em>v. <em>Allan S. Goodman, Inc., </em>supra, 286 Conn. 405-407 (when commission on human rights and opportunities had consistently interpreted General Statutes \u00a7 46a-60 in thirteen decisions over twelve years, several of which had been adopted by various trial courts, interpretation was entitled to deference); <em>Hartford </em>v. <em>Hartford Municipal Employees Assn., </em>259 Conn. 251, 268, 788 A.2d 60 (2002) (deferring to interpretation of board to resolve possible ambiguity when board had presented evidence of consistent interpretation of statute for more than twenty-five years). In the present case, the board has interpreted \u00a7 5-270 (g) only twice and neither decision was subject to judicial scrutiny. We conclude, therefore, that, as in <em>Vincent </em>and <em>Christopher R., </em>the board\u2019s interpretation is not entitled to deference.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> Accordingly, our review is plenary.</p>\n<p id=\"b620-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"602\">*602</page-number>We begin our analysis with the language of \u00a7 5-270 (g), which provides: \u201c \u2018Managerial employee\u2019 means any individual in a position in which the principal functions are characterized by not fewer than two of the following, provided for any position in any unit of the system of higher education, one of such two functions shall be as specified in subdivision (4) of this subsection: (1) Responsibility for direction of a subunit or facility of a major division of an agency or assignment to an agency head\u2019s staff; (2) development, implementation and evaluation of goals and objectives consistent with agency mission and policy; (3) participation in the formulation of agency policy; or (4) a major role in the administration of collective bargaining agreements or major personnel decisions, or both, including staffing, hiring, firing, evaluation, promotion and training of employees.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b620-5\">Thus, under \u00a7 5-270 (g) (2) and (3), employees in a particular position are managerial employees if the enumerated functions constitute the position\u2019s \u201cprincipal functions . . . .\u201d Although the phrase \u201cprincipal functions\u201d is not statutorily defined, we conclude that no reasonable interpretation of the phrase carries the connotation that employees in a managerial position must exercise independent judgment in carrying out the enumerated functions. Rather, the phrase connotes that the enumerated functions must be the position\u2019s most important, consequential or influential functions. See Merriam-Webster\u2019s Collegiate Dictionary (10th Ed. 1993) (defining \u201cprincipal\u201d as \u201cmost important, consequential, or influential: CHIEF\u201d); see also Black\u2019s Law Dictionary (9th Ed. 2009) (defining \u201cprincipal\u201d as \u201c[c]hief; primary; most important\u201d).<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> Thus, contrary to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"603\">*603</page-number>the board\u2019s suggestion that, if the phrase principal function is to have any meaning, it must mean that managerial employees exercise independent judgment,<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> it is reasonable to conclude that the legislature intended that the board could consider the amount of time that the employees in the position devote to each function, whether an employee\u2019s ability to carry out an enumerated function is a prerequisite for being hired to the position and whether the failure of an employee in the position to carry out an enumerated function would have important consequences to the employer.* 1<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> We conclude, therefore, that although the application of the phrase principal functions to any particular position will require an exercise of judgment as to which functions of a particular position are the most important, consequential and influential, the phrase clearly and unambiguously does not mean that the employee must exercise independent judgment in carrying out the enumerated functions.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b622-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"604\">*604</page-number>Similarly, nothing within the language specifically describing the principal functions of managerial employees connotes that such employees must exercise independent judgment in carrying out those functions. Subdivision (2) provides that the position\u2019s most important, consequential or influential functions may include the \u201cdevelopment, implementation and evaluation of goals and objectives consistent with agency mission and policy . . . .\u201d General Statutes \u00a7 5-270 (g) (2). The development, implementation and evaluation of the goals and objectives may be an important responsibility of an employee in a particular position even if the employee does not exercise independent judgment in carrying out that responsibility. For example, one of the principal functions of an employee may be to present a range of options for implementing the employer\u2019s goals and objectives, with the final choice to be made by a higher ranking employee. Subdivision (3) of \u00a7 5-270 (g) merely provides that a principal function of a managerial employee may be \u201cparticipation in the formulation of agency policy . . . .\u201d<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> Participation, by its very nature, does not require independence.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b623-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"605\">*605</page-number>Moreover, if the legislature had intended to impose a requirement that managerial employees exercise independent judgment in carrying out the activities described in \u00a7 5-270 (g) (2) and (3), it could have done so expressly, as it did in \u00a7 5-270 (f).<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> \u201cWe are not permitted to supply statutory language that the legislature may have chosen to omit.\u201d (Internal quotation marks <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"606\">*606</page-number>omitted.) <em>Connecticut Light &amp; Power Co. </em>v. <em>Dept. of Public Utility Control, </em>266 Conn. 108, 119, 830 A.2d 1121 (2003).</p>\n<p id=\"b624-5\">The board and the union raise numerous policy arguments in support of their claim that managerial employees must exercise independent judgment in carrying out the principal functions described in \u00a7 5-270 (g) (2) and (3), and also point to the legislative history of the statute. We have concluded, however, that the language of \u00a7 5-270 (g) plainly and unambiguously does not require that managerial employees exercise independent judgment in carrying out their principal functions.</p>\n<p id=\"b624-6\">We conclude, therefore, that the trial court improperly dismissed the department\u2019s appeal after concluding that the board properly had determined that the employees did not meet the criteria for managerial employees set forth in \u00a7 5-270 (g) (2) and (3) because the department had not proved that the employees exercised independent judgment in carrying out the functions described in those subdivisions. Accordingly, we reverse the judgment of the trial court and remand the case to that court with direction to remand the case to the board so that it may apply the proper standard.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b624-7\">The judgment of the trial court is reversed and the case is remanded to that court with direction to sustain the department\u2019s appeal and to remand the case to the board for further proceedings according to law.</p>\n<p id=\"b624-8\">In this opinion NORCOTT, ZARELLA and McLACHLAN, Js., concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b613-13\"> Because the department, in its appeal, was acting through the office of labor relations of the office of policy and management, that office also is a plaintiff in this action.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b614-6\"> General Statutes \u00a7 5-270 (g) provides: \u201c \u2018Managerial employee\u2019 means any individual in a position in which the principal functions are characterized by not fewer than two of the following, provided for any position in any unit of the system of higher education, one of such two functions shall be as specified in subdivision (4) of this subsection: (1) Responsibility for direction of a subunit or facility of a major division of an agency or assignment to an agency head\u2019s staff; (2) development, implementation and evaluation of goals and objectives consistent with agency mission and policy; (3) participation in the formulation of agency policy; or (4) a major role in the administration of collective bargaining agreements or major personnel decisions, or both, including staffing, hiring, firing, evaluation, promotion and training of employees.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b614-7\"> The department appealed from the judgment of the trial court to the Appellate Court and we transferred the appeal to this court pursuant to General Statutes \u00a7 51-199 (c) and Practice Book \u00a7 65-1.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b615-6\"> The department was required to refuse to negotiate with the union in order to obtain judicial review of the board\u2019s decision certifying the union as the employees\u2019 bargaining representative.

The hoard <em>argues </em>that it would be absurd to conclude that supervisory employees, who are of lower rank than managerial employees and who are not excluded from collective bargaining, are required to exercise independent judgment in carrying out their principal functions, but managerial employees are not. The principal functions of supervisory employees are different, however, from those of managerial employees. Accordingly, we do not agree that our interpretation results in an absurdity. The legislature reasonably could distinguish supervisory employees from lower ranking employees by requiring a finding that the former exercise independent judgment in carrying out certain functions while distinguishing managerial employees from lower ranking employees by requiring a finding that the former had different principal functions than the latter.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"16\">\n<p id=\"b624-10\"> General Statutes \u00a7 4-183 Q) provides in relevant part that, if the trial court sustains an administrative appeal, it may, \u201cif appropriate . . . remand the case for further proceedings. . . .\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-3\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b624-9\">KATZ, J.,</author>\n<p id=\"AhW\">with whom PALMER, J., joins, dissenting.

Accordingly, I respectfully dissent.</p>\n<p id=\"b625-4\">As a preliminary matter, it is useful to clarify briefly the basis of both the board\u2019s decision and the trial court\u2019s affirmance of that decision, as well as what is not at issue. It is undisputed that the employees\u2019 job <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"608\">*608</page-number>functions meet the criteria of \u00a7 5-270 (g) (1), but do not meet the criteria of \u00a7 5-270 (g) (4). Therefore, this appeal turns on whether the board properly determined that the classifications of state police lieutenant and captain did not meet either of the two criteria of \u00a7 5-270 (g) (2) and (3), as employees must meet at least two of the four criteria under \u00a7 5-270g to be deemed managerial employees. In regard to the criterion set forth in \u00a7 5-270 (g) (2) \u2014 \u201cdevelopment, implementation and evaluation of goals and objectives consistent with agency mission and policy\u201d \u2014 the board determined that to satisfy that subdivision, the exercise of independent judgment is required. The board then found that: \u201cThe evidence clearly supports a conclusion that the responsibility for the development, implementation and evaluation of goals and objectives consistent with the [department\u2019s] mission is placed at a level above that of captain. While these employees may be asked for their opinions and in select cases, individual majors and other superiors may rely heavily on them, [those employees] simply do not have and cannot exercise the level of independent judgment and involvement necessary to meet this criterion.\u201d In regard to the criterion set forth in \u00a7 5-270 (g) (3) \u2014 \u201cparticipation in the formulation of agency policy\u201d \u2014 the board concluded that the employees \u201c[did] not participate in any meaningful way in the formulation of agency policy. . . . [N]o evidence or testimony established that these employees are involved in any way, other than the occasional suggestion, in the formulation of agency policy. As such, none of the employees fit [the] criterion [of \u00a7 5-270 (g) (3)].\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b626-5\">In affirming the board\u2019s decision, however, the trial court treated that decision as though it properly had injected the independent judgment requirement into its analysis of both subdivisions (2) and (3) of \u00a7 5-270 (g). In doing so, the court noted that \u201c[t]he concept of independent judgment does not require the manager to have <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"609\">*609</page-number>absolute autonomy, but as the [board] state [d] in its brief . . . [t]he [department must] show that the employees were vested with some indication of trust in their judgment and authority and that they were included in a meaningful way in decision-making and policy formulation .... To some extent all [s]tate employees implement goals and objectives and make suggestions about policy. However, the statute means nothing if it does not mean that managers have some indicia that they participate effectively in the processes by which decisions regarding the agency are made.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) Looking to previous board decisions interpreting \u00a7 5-270 (g) to impose such a requirement, the court afforded deference to the board\u2019s interpretation and determined that the board\u2019s construction was reasonable. I would conclude that the trial court properly interpreted and affirmed the board\u2019s determination as it pertained to subdivision (2) of \u00a7 5-270 (g). I would further conclude that, although the trial court misinterpreted the basis of the board\u2019s decision, it nevertheless properly affirmed the board\u2019s ultimate determination as to subdivision (3) of the statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b627-5\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b627-6\">I first turn to \u00a7 5-270 (g), which provides in relevant part that the term \u201c \u2018[m]anagerial employee\u2019 means any individual in a position in which the principal functions are characterized by . . . (2) development, implementation and evaluation of goals and objectives consistent with agency mission and policy . . . .\u201d The question of whether the trial court properly concluded that the board correctly had determined that the employees did not satisfy \u00a7 5-270 (g) (2) because that subdivision requires the exercise of independent judgment presents a question of statutory interpretation. I agree with the majority that the trial court improperly deferred to the board\u2019s interpretation of \u00a7 5-270 (g) (2) because that interpretation was neither time-tested nor previously <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"610\">*610</page-number>subjected to judicial review and, therefore, that plenary review is appropriate. See <em>Vincent </em>v. <em>New Haven, </em>285 Conn. 778, 783-84, 941 A.2d 932 (2008); <em>Longley </em>v. <em>State Employees Retirement Commission, </em>284 Conn. 149, 163-64, 931 A.2d 890 (2007). I disagree, however, with the majority\u2019s conclusion that the enumerated terms unambiguously do not require the exercise of independent judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b628-5\">In undertaking this review, I am mindful of the plain meaning rule of General Statutes \u00a7 l-2z<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> and our general rules of statutory construction. See <em>Picco </em>v. <em>Voluntown, </em>295 Conn. 141, 147, 989 A.2d 593 (2010). \u201c[T]he test to determine ambiguity is whether the statute, when read in context, is susceptible to more than one reasonable inteipretation.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Orr, </em>291 Conn. 642, 654, 969 A.2d 750 (2009). As the majority states, the text of \u00a7 5-270 (g) (2) makes no <em>express </em>reference to the level of judgment, discretion or authority an employee must use in his duties in order to satisfy that criterion.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> From this, the majority concludes that \u00a7 5-270 (g) (2) plainly and unambiguously does not require such judgment, whereas the board, which is charged with implementing that statute, has concluded that it plainly and unambiguously means the opposite. Although I do not dispute the reasonableness of the majority\u2019s interpretation, I am more convinced that the language of the statute, read <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"611\">*611</page-number>contextually, supports the reasonableness of the <em>board\u2019s </em>interpretation. In my view, therefore, because it fails to yield a plain and unambiguous meaning, \u00a7 5-270 (g) (2) is ambiguous. See, e.g., <em>Hees </em>v. <em>Burke Construction, Inc., </em>290 Conn. 1, 12, 961 A.2d 373 (2009) (\u201c[b]ecause both readings of the statute are reasonable, we conclude that the statutory language is ambiguous in this case\u201d); <em>State </em>v. <em>Jenkins, </em>288 Conn. 610, 620-21, 954 A.2d 806 (2008) (concluding that phrase is ambiguous because it is susceptible of more than one reasonable interpretation).</p>\n<p id=\"b629-5\">Section 5-270 (g) (2) addresses three functions that must be performed consistently with the mission and policy of the particular state agency \u2014 (1) the development, (2) implementation and (3) evaluation of goals and objectives. The commonly accepted definitions of these terms, to which we may look as part of our analysis under \u00a7 l-2z; see General Statutes \u00a7 1-1 (a);<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> read together, seem to connote the use of independent judgment. I would agree that the common meaning of implementation, <em>read in isolation, </em>suggests a purely ministerial function and thus does not require the exercise of independent judgment.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> See The American Heri<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"612\">*612</page-number>tage Dictionary of the English Language (3d Ed. 1992) (defining \u201cimplement\u201d as \u201c[t]o put into practical effect; carry out\u201d). On the other hand, the common meaning of evaluation does connote the use of independent judgment. See id. (defining \u201cevaluate\u201d as \u201c[t]o examine and judge carefully; appraise\u201d). The meaning of development is fairly open-ended. See id. (defining \u201cdevelop\u201d as \u201c[t]o bring from latency to or toward fulfillment . . . [t]o expand or enlarge . . . [t]o improve the quality of; refine . . . [t]o bring into being gradually\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b630-4\">It is significant, however, that \u00a7 5-270 (g) (2) requires the evaluation and development of goals and objectives <em>in conformity with \u201cagency mission and policy </em>. . . .\u201d (Emphasis added.) Those policies and missions rarely consist of wholly objective criteria or ministerial procedures that would obviate the need for the exercise of independent judgment, but, rather, are commonly understood to involve broadly stated ideals. See Black\u2019s Law Dictionary (9th Ed. 2009) (defining \u201cpolicy\u201d as \u201c[t]he <em>general principles </em>by which a government is guided in its management of public affairs\u201d [emphasis added]); The American Heritage Dictionary of the English Language, supra (defining \u201cmission\u201d as \u201c[a] special assignment given to a person or group\u201d); The American Heritage Dictionary of the English Language, supra (\u201c[P]olicy\u201d is defined as: \u201c[a] plan or course of action, as of a government . . . intended to influence and determine decisions, actions, and other matters: American foreign policy; the company\u2019s personnel policy. ... A course of action, guiding principle, or procedure considered expedient, prudent or advantageous . . . .\u201d). Acting in conformity with a policy or mission therefore necessitates independent judgment of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"613\">*613</page-number>meaning, import and consequences of such ideals. Analogously, the legislature routinely assigns agencies the task of developing regulations that are consistent with broadly stated legislative policies, a task that clearly requires the exercise of independent judgment. See, e.g., General Statutes \u00a7 1-84 (r) (2) (requiring board of trustees of constituent units of state system of higher education to establish <em>policies </em>to ensure that members do not violate ethical code and to establish specific <em>procedures </em>to effectuate those policies); General Statutes \u00a7 42-260 (g) (\u201c[t]he Insurance Commissioner shall develop regulations, in accordance with chapter 54, implementing an arbitration process to settle disputes arising from extended warranty contracts between extended warranty providers and buyers\u201d); General Statutes \u00a7 46a-57 (c) (\u201c[t]he commission [on human rights and opportunities], in consultation with the executive director and Chief Human Rights Referee, shall adopt regulations and rules of practice, in accordance with chapter 54, to ensure consistent procedures governing contested case proceedings\u201d). Therefore, read contextually, the language of \u00a7 5-270 (g) (2) supports the reasonableness of the board\u2019s contention that the statute requires managers to exercise independent judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b631-5\">I find unavailing the majority\u2019s contention that the legislature\u2019s inclusion of the term \u201cindependent judgment\u201d in \u00a7 5-270 (f)<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> conclusively indicates that it did <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"614\">*614</page-number>not intend for such a consideration to apply in \u00a7 5-270 (g) (2). It is evident from the plain language of these subsections that the tasks enumerated in subsection (f) of the statute refer primarily to <em>personnel </em>functions and therefore differ markedly from the policy and mission focused responsibilities enumerated in \u00a7 5-270 (g) (2). Indeed, the sole reference to policy in subsection (f) requires only that a supervisory employee exercise judgment in \u201capplying . . . established personnel policies and procedures . . . .\u201d General Statutes \u00a7 5-270 (f) (3). It is particularly telling that this subdivision refers to \u201capplying\u201d policy rather than to the \u201cdevelopment, implementation and evaluation\u201d of goals and objectives consistent with policy as referenced in \u00a7 5-270 (g) (2) because the term application does not necessarily connote a use of discretion or judgment. See Black\u2019s Law Dictionary, supra (defining \u201capply\u201d as \u201c[t]o employ for a limited purpose . . . [t]o put to use with a particular subject matter\u201d); The American Heritage Dictionary of the English Language, supra (defining \u201capply\u201d as \u201c[t]o put to or adapt for a special use . . . [t]o put into action\u201d). The inclusion of an explicit independent judgment requirement in \u00a7 5-270 (f) therefore serves to distinguish between the largely ministerial tasks enumerated therein and the level of discretion and judgment necessary to qualify as a supervisor. In contrast, such an explicit requirement would not be necessary in \u00a7 5-270 (g) (2) if, as the board reasonably concluded, the plain terms of that subdivision already connote the use of such judgment.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b633-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"615\">*615</page-number>Moreover, reading \u00a7 5-270 (f) in conjunction with \u00a7 5-270 (b),<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> which enumerates the classes of state workers considered eligible employees for the purpose of collective bargaining, suggests that the inclusion of the explicit independent judgment requirement in \u00a7 5-270 (f) lends support to the <em>board\u2019s </em>interpretation of \u00a7 5-270 (g) (2). The effect of \u00a7 5-270 (b) and (f) is explicitly to include supervisors in collective bargaining. See <em>State Management Assn. of Connecticut, Inc. </em>v. <em>O\u2019Neill, </em>204 Conn. 746, 749, 755, 529 A.2d 1276 (1987) (noting that under \u00a7 5-270 [b] and [\u00b6] supervisory employees are eligible for collective bargaining). Indeed, the term \u201csupervisory employee\u201d appears nowhere else in the relevant statutory scheme, and therefore \u00a7 5-270 (f) appears to have little effect beyond ensuring that supervisory employees are included in collective bargaining.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> In contrast, \u00a7 5-270 (b) explicitly excludes managers from collective bargaining. As the board noted, it would be a bizarre result to require supervisors to exercise independent judgment but not to require managers, who constitute the top of the leadership structure and are therefore excluded from collective bargaining, to exercise that same level of judgment. I therefore disagree with the majority that the inclusion of the explicit \u201cindependent judgment\u201d requirement in \u00a7 5-270 (f) unambig<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"616\">*616</page-number>uously indicates that such a requirement does not exist in \u00a7 5-270 (g). Accordingly, I also conclude that the language of \u00a7 5-270 (g) (2) is open to more than one reasonable interpretation and thus is not plain and unambiguous.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b634-5\">The available extratextual sources, to which I turn because the language of the statute is ambiguous; <em>Grady </em>v. <em>Somers, </em>294 Conn. 324, 334, 984 A.2d 684 (2009); bolsters the department\u2019s reading of \u00a7 5-270 (g) (2) as requiring managers to exercise independent judgment. This court previously has analyzed the meaning and the import of the legislative history of \u00a7 5-270 (g). \u201cA review of the legislative history of No. 81-457 of the 1981 Public Acts, the origin of ... \u00a7 5-270 (g) which excludes managerial employees, reveals that, in enacting the statute, the legislators were . . . concerned with efficiency in state government: \u2018The purpose of [\u00a7 5-270 (g)] is to ensure that there are people available to act as managers for the state system to provide effective management of state government.\u2019 24 H.R. Proc., Pt. 24,1981 Sess., p. 7874, remarks of Representative Gardner Wright. \u2018It is important that we allow the state to deal with some system for being able to pick the people who will be classified as managers so that everyone knows what the responsibility is, what the assignments are and who has to take responsibility for action whether something is done correctly and can take credit or whether something is done badly and have to take the blame.\u2019 24 S. Proc., Pt. 17, 1981 Sess., <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"617\">*617</page-number>p. 5624, remarks of Senator Marcella Fahey. Related to this legislative purpose was the concern for the security and safety of those people under the care of various state agencies in strike situations. Senator Fahey indicated: \u2018What we are dealing with here today is if we have problems in the [s]tate of Connecticut and we have a strike, who is going to be there to take care of our patients in our hospitals? Who is going to be there to take care of our prisoners? We are not saying we want to leave enough people so that they can break the strike, but there has to be at least two or three people who are designated as managers, who can make sure that the place doesn\u2019t catch on fire or can make plans for a disaster to move patients in and out of places, who can make sure they ring a fire alarm or push the right button or at least call if there is a problem. If we do not exclude anyone and call anyone a manager, how do we operate? We all look to someone who is a manager for the administrative functions. ... If we pull things together so that everybody is equalized in a situation that no one can take the initiative and answer a question, are we helping the public or are we hurting the public?\u2019 [Id.], <em>pp. 5623-24 State Management Assn. of Connecticut, Inc. </em>v. <em>O\u2019Neill, </em>supra, 204 Conn. 755.</p>\n<p id=\"b635-5\">Drawing from this legislative history, as well as the text of the statute, this court has emphasized that, in order to effectuate the legislature\u2019s policy considerations, the managerial exclusion applies only to employees with significant independent and decision-making authority. \u201c[M]anagers have the responsibility to decide major personnel decisions and formulate agency policies .... These responsibilities give managers prestige, <em>autonomy </em>and managerial <em>authority </em>that is not enjoyed by other employees.\u201d (Emphasis added.) <em>Dept. of Administrative Services </em>v. <em>Employees\u2019 Review Board, </em>226 Conn. 670, 683-84, 628 A.2d 957 (1993); see also <em>State Management Assn. of Connecticut, Inc. </em>v. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"618\">*618</page-number><em>O\u2019Neill, </em>supra, 204 Conn. 759 (\u201cIn comparing managers and supervisors, the trial court reasoned that \u2018[supervisors supervise the work of subordinates; managers head an agency [unit] or facility.

Because there is no challenge to the board\u2019s conclusion that the department\u2019s employees in the present case do not exercise such independent judgment, the trial court properly concluded that \u00a7 5-270 (g) (2) was not satisfied.</p>\n<p id=\"b639-5\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b639-6\">I turn next to the trial court\u2019s determination that the board properly concluded that \u00a7 5-270 (g) (3), which requires \u201cparticipation in the formulation of agency policy,\u201d was not satisfied in the present case. As I previously have noted, the board concluded that the department had failed to establish that the employees were involved in any way, beyond offering occasional suggestions, in the formulation of policy. The trial court, however, treated the board\u2019s decision as requiring \u201cindependent judgment\u201d for both \u00a7 5-270 (g) (2) and (3). Although I agree with the majority that the trial court improperly engrafted that requirement onto the statutory language, I do so not because the court misinterpreted the statute, but, rather, because it misinterpreted the basis of the board\u2019s decision.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> Therefore, I would affirm the judgment of the trial court as to \u00a7 5-270 (g) (3) on the alternate ground that the board properly found that the department had presented insufficient evidence to establish that the employees participated in the formulation of agency policy.</p>\n<p id=\"b639-7\">While the department focuses specifically on the fact that the board\u2019s decision refers to \u201cmeaningful\u201d participation, which the department contends was improper, the department ignores the fact that the board specifically found that the department had provided no evidence or testimony demonstrating that the employees were involved in policy formulation <em>in any way beyond </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"622\">*622</page-number><em>offering occasional suggestions. </em>As the factual finding of an administrative agency, this court may \u201cdetermine [only] whether there [was] substantial evidence in the administrative record to support the agency\u2019s findings of basic fact and whether the conclusions drawn from those facts [were] reasonable.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Hogan </em>v. <em>Dept. of Children &amp; Families, </em>290 Conn. 545, 561, 964 A.2d 1213 (2009). The department does not contend that there was evidence to the contrary or that the board\u2019s conclusion drawn from the evidence was unreasonable. Accordingly, I conclude that the trial court properly affirmed the decision of the board because the employees did not satisfy the requirements of either \u00a7 5-270 (g) (2) or (3).</p>\n<p id=\"b640-6\">I therefore respectfully dissent.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b625-5\"> As the majority notes in footnote 1 of its opinion, the office of policy and management also was a plaintiff in this case.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b625-6\"> General Statutes \u00a7 5-270 (g) provides: \u201c \u2018Managerial employee\u2019 means any individual in a position in which the principal functions are characterized by not fewer than two of the following, provided for any position in any unit of the system of higher education, one of such two functions shall be as specified in subdivision (4) of this subsection: (1) Responsibility for direction of a subunit or facility of a major division of an agency or assignment to an agency head\u2019s staff; (2) development, implementation and evaluation of goals and objectives consistent with agency mission and policy; (3) participation in the formulation of agency policy; or (4) a major role in the administration of collective bargaining agreements or major personnel decisions, or both, including staffing, hiring, firing, evaluation, promotion and training of employees.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b628-6\"> General Statutes \u00a7 l-2z provides: \u201cThe meaning of a statute shall, in the first instance, be ascertained from the text of the statute itself and its relationship to other statutes.

I do not understand the board\u2019s interpretation to mean that the employee must operate <em>completely </em>autonomously. Thus, the mere fact that employees may work collectively to develop goals and objectives would not render their action outside the scope of \u00a7 5-270 (g) (2). Indeed, in \u00a7 5-270 (f), which expressly requires the exercise of independent judgment, the legislature also has used the term \u201cparticipat[e],\u201d which necessarily requires some collective action. See footnote 7 of this dissenting opinion.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"12\">\n<p id=\"b636-6\"> The board subsequently reached a similar conclusion with regard to certain employees of the department of correction in <em>In re Connecticut </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"619\">*619</page-number><em>State Employees Assn., SEIU Local 2001, </em>Conn.

Thus, while employees may be asked for their recommendations, none exercise the level of independent judgment or authority necessary to fulfill [the statutory criteria of \u00a7 5-270 (g) (2)].\u201d Id., 4.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"13\">\n<p id=\"b638-6\"> The majority challenges this application of the legislative acquiescence doctrine based, in part, on its conclusion that the board\u2019s interpretation of \u00a7 5-270 (g) (2) is not time-tested. I first note that this analysis seems to conflate the doctrine concerning judicial deference to an agency\u2019s decision with that governing legislative acquiescence to a court or agency decision. While these doctrines may sometimes overlap in application, they are nonetheless triggered by separate and distinct circumstances and I cannot agree that the inapplicability of one should influence the applicability of the other.</p>\n<p id=\"b638-7\">It is true that legislative inaction following an agency decision may not constitute legislative acquiescence when the agency decision \u201cis of relatively recent vintage and of relatively infrequent application\u201d; <em>Vincent </em>v. <em>New Haven, </em>285 Conn. 778, 791 n.15, 941 A.2d 932 (2008); because, in such a situation, it may be \u201ctoo soon to draw any firm conclusion from legislative inaction . . . .\u201d Id. Considering, however, that the legislature has had twenty-three years to respond to this court\u2019s decision in <em>O\u2019Neitt, </em>and seventeen years to respond to the board\u2019s decision in <em>In re Protective Services Employees Coalition, AFL-CIO, </em>and that the legislature has, in fact, amended \u00a7 5-270 (g) three times in that interval, I conclude that the facts in this case weigh heavily in favor of applying the doctrine of legislative acquiescence. See <em>Wiseman </em>v. <em>Armstrong, </em>269 Conn. 802, 825-26, 850 A.2d 114 (2004) (fact that legislature amended statute three times after attorney general\u2019s opinion but did not change relevant provision indicative of legislative acquiescence); <em>Connecticut Light &amp; Power Co. </em>v. <em>Public Utilities Control Authority, </em>supra, 176 Conn. 198 (\u201cinference of legislative concurrence with the agency\u2019s interpretation [is] to be drawn from legislative silence concerning that interpretation, especially where the legislature makes unrelated amendments in the same statute\u201d).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"14\">\n<p id=\"b639-8\"><em> </em>Although the majority acknowledges that the board\u2019s decision did not rest on the independent judgment requirement, it declines to address the propriety of the board\u2019s decision.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
