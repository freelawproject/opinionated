The defendant, Tomas D., appeals<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> from the judgment of the trial court, rendered after a jury trial, convicting him of sexual assault in the first degree in violation of General Statutes \u00a7 53a-70 (a) (2),<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> unlawful restraint in the first degree in violation of General Statutes \u00a7 53a-95 (a),<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> and risk of injury to a child in violation of General Statutes (Rev. to 2005) \u00a7 53-21 (a) (2).<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> On appeal, the defendant, in addition to his subpoena claims, contends that: (1) the evidence at trial was insufficient to establish his guilt beyond a reasonable doubt; (2) the trial court abused its discretion by denying his motion for a new trial; and (3) prosecutorial impropriety deprived him of a fair trial. We disagree with the defendant\u2019s various claims and, accordingly, affirm the judgment of the trial court.</p>\n<p id=\"b497-4\">The record reveals the following facts, which the jury reasonably could have found, and procedural history. On Monday, May 1,2006, the then twelve year old victim was living in Waterbury with her grandfather, T, and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"480\">*480</page-number>her grandmother, E, who are the parents of the defendant, who is the victim\u2019s uncle. Shortly before 7 a.m. on that date, the defendant telephoned their home and asked the victim whether she was going to school that day; she informed him that she planned to attend. A few minutes later, the defendant telephoned again and told the victim that he would drive her to school; this was unusual because he had never driven her to school before, and she ordinarily took the school bus. Shortly thereafter, the defendant arrived and spoke with T, leading T to believe that the defendant would drive the victim to school so that T could bring his other younger grandchildren to their schools.</p>\n<p id=\"b498-6\">The defendant then drove the victim in his Jeep past her school bus stop, where she waved to O, one of her friends who was waiting there. While they drove, the defendant commented to the victim: \u201c[He] had to make sure [the victim] get[s] to school, because [she] could get hurt outside if [she doesn\u2019t] get to school, if [she\u2019s] outside, because someone could rape [her] or something and \u2014 or kill [her].\u201d Rather than drive the victim directly to school, the defendant drove to his apartment first and asked her to come inside because he needed to change out of his work clothing.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> While the victim ate cereal in the defendant\u2019s kitchen, the defendant went upstairs to change, and then came down clad only in his boxer shorts. He then led her by the arm upstairs to his bedroom. Once they arrived in his bedroom, the defendant said, \u201cfor someone else to do it, that he\u2019d rather do this himself,\u201d started to play a pornographic DVD that he took from a green plastic storage bin in the bedroom and directed the victim to go to the bed. The defendant then pushed the victim onto the bed, and pulled off her pants and underwear, groped her <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"481\">*481</page-number>breasts and licked her vagina. When the victim told the defendant to stop, he said, \u201c[d]on\u2019t make me use force,\u201d pulled her legs apart, and engaged in vaginal intercourse with her.</p>\n<p id=\"b499-6\">Several hours later, at approximately 2:30 p.m., after the victim already had tried unsuccessfully to leave the defendant\u2019s house on her own,<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> the defendant and the victim took his other Jeep to pick up M, the daughter of the defendant\u2019s fianc\u00e9e. While in the car, the defendant asked the victim not to tell E what had occurred \u201cbecause [E] would kill him,\u201d and told her to tell E that the defendant had picked her up from school because she was scared. After dropping M off at the defendant\u2019s home, they then drove toward the victim\u2019s house, where they came upon E and T walking with S, the defendant\u2019s sister, and several of their other grandchildren, including C, the defendant\u2019s daughter. The defendant pulled the Jeep over and told E that the victim had called him and asked to be picked up from school because she was scared.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> After E gave the victim a key, C joined the victim and the defendant in the car for the rest of the trip to the victim\u2019s home; the rest of the family declined the defendant\u2019s offer of a ride, as they were already close to home.</p>\n<p id=\"b499-7\">The victim, T and E all testified that, in the days following May 1, the victim showered with unusual freq<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"482\">*482</page-number>uency,<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> acted withdrawn and locked herself in her bedroom when the defendant visited their home. When O subsequently asked the victim why she had not been in school that day, she told O about the assault; she did not, however, report it to an adult until Friday, May 5, when she told E. E then brought the victim to Saint Mary\u2019s Hospital.* <footnotemark>11</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b500-6\">Following a police investigation, the state charged the defendant with sexual assault in the first degree in violation of \u00a7 53a-70 (a) (2), unlawful restraint in the first degree in violation of \u00a7 53a-95 (a), and risk of injury to a child in violation of \u00a7 53-21 (a) (2). Thereafter, the case was tried to a jury. After the trial court denied the defendant\u2019s oral motion for a judgment of acquittal on the basis of testimonial and documentary evidence that the victim had been marked present in school at the time of the assault,<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> the jury returned a verdict of guilty <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"483\">*483</page-number>on all counts. The defendant then filed posttrial motions for a judgment of acquittal and for a new trial, claiming, inter alia, that the verdict was contrary to the evidence and that the state improperly had failed to inform the defense that it had released Scott Stevenson, a sergeant of the Waterbury police department and the lead investigator in this case, from his subpoena, causing him to leave for his scheduled vacation and become unavailable to testify at the trial, thus depriving the trier of fact of Stevenson\u2019s potentially material and exculpatory testimony.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> The trial court denied both motions, rendered a judgment of conviction in accordance with the jury\u2019s verdict and sentenced the defendant to a total effective sentence of thirty-five years imprisonment, execution suspended after nineteen years, and thirty years probation. This appeal followed. See footnote 3 of this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b501-6\">On appeal, the defendant claims that: (1) the evidence was insufficient to establish his guilt beyond a reasonable doubt; (2) the trial court improperly denied his motion for a new trial; (3) the state\u2019s failure to notify him that it had released Stevenson from subpoena violated his federal and state constitutional rights to compulsory process; and (4) prosecutorial impropriety deprived him of a fair trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b502-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"484\">*484</page-number>I</p>\n<p id=\"b502-6\">FACT BASED CLAIMS</p>\n<p id=\"b502-7\">We begin with the defendant\u2019s fact based claims that: (1) the evidence was not sufficient to establish his guilt beyond a reasonable doubt; and (2) the trial court abused its discretion by denying his motion for a new trial because the jury\u2019s verdict was contrary to the weight of the evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b502-8\">A</p>\n<p id=\"b502-9\">Sufficiency of the Evidence</p>\n<p id=\"b502-10\">We begin with the defendant\u2019s claim that the evidence was insufficient to convict him of the crimes charged.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> Specifically, the defendant argues that there was evidence, \u201cnot refuted by the state, that it was physically impossible for [him] to have committed the charged crimes because [the victim] was in school \u2014 not in [his] apartment \u2014 on the day and time that she claimed she was assaulted.\u201d The defendant also emphasizes the lack of physical evidence to support the victim\u2019s allegations, and that the only evidence of his guilt is \u201cthe inconsistent and contradictory testimony of the [victim]; testimony on the basis of which no reasonable person could have concluded that [he] was guilty beyond a reasonable doubt.\u201d In response, the state argues that the defendant\u2019s claim is a \u201cmisguided invitation to this court to second-guess the credibility determinations of the jury,\u201d and further contends that the verdict is supported by direct evidence, namely, the victim\u2019s testimony. We agree with the state and conclude that the evidence was sufficient to sustain the jury\u2019s verdict under the well <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"485\">*485</page-number>established standard by which we review sufficiency of the evidence claims. See, e.g., <em>State </em>v. <em>Na\u2019im B., </em>288 Conn. 290, 295-97, 952 A.2d 755 (2008) (evidence construed in light most favorable to sustaining verdict in determining whether it is sufficient to prove guilt beyond reasonable doubt).</p>\n<p id=\"b503-4\">The defendant does not claim that the evidence, if properly credited by the jury, leaves unsatisfied any of the elements of the offenses charged under \u00a7 53a-70 (a) (2), \u00a7 53a-95 (a) or \u00a7 53-21 (a) (2). Rather, he contends that he could not have committed the crimes because attendance records from the victim\u2019s middle school indicate that she was there, rather than with him, on the day and at the time of the assault. The juiy, however, reasonably could have found that those attendance records were the product of a data entry error committed by one of the victim\u2019s homeroom teachers, who had not recorded the victim as being absent when she took attendance using the \u201cLetter Grade\u201d computer program during homeroom, which lasted from 7:50 until 8 a.m.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> O, who had seen the victim drive by the bus stop with the defendant, and was in all of her classes except for homeroom, testified that the victim was absent from all of her classes that day, and was not present when they customarily met up after homeroom to travel together to their first instructional period. June Kozloski, the victim\u2019s art teacher, testified that, in her individual records, she had recorded the victim as absent <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"486\">*486</page-number>from her class, which was scheduled from approximately 12:30 until 1:20 p.m.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> Kozloski also testified that, in her experience, the attendance indicated by Letter Grade frequently was erroneous. Heidi Doolan, the victim\u2019s music teacher, testified similarly. Finally, Rebecca Wisnie, a Waterbury police detective, testified that she had learned during her investigation that the victim had not taken an English test that was administered that day, either.</p>\n<p id=\"b504-6\">With respect to the defendant\u2019s claims that the victim\u2019s trial testimony was flawed by her unreliable memory,<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> and also was inconsistent with portions of her voluntary statement to the police, none of the claimed inconsistencies<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> negates the essential elements of the offenses charged, and is not a ground for reversal because \u201c[questions of whether to believe or to disbelieve a competent witness are beyond our review. As a reviewing court, we may not retry the case or pass on the credibility of witnesses. . . . We must defer to the trier of fact\u2019s assessment of the credibility of the witnesses that is made on the basis of its firsthand observation of their conduct, demeanor and attitude.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Mullins, </em>288 Conn. 345, 365, 952 A.2d 784 (2008); see also, e.g., <em>State </em>v. <em>Linarte, </em>107 Conn. App. 93, 117-18, 944 A.2d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"487\">*487</page-number>369 (\u201c[t]hough labeled as a challenge to the sufficiency of the evidence, this claim rests on an assessment of the witnesses\u2019 credibility\u201d), cert. denied, 289 Conn. 901, 957 A.2d 873 (2008). Thus, we conclude that the jury\u2019s verdict was supported by sufficient evidence to prove the defendant\u2019s guilt of the offenses charged beyond a reasonable doubt.</p>\n<p id=\"b505-6\">B</p>\n<p id=\"b505-7\">Denial of the Defendant\u2019s Motion for a New Trial</p>\n<p id=\"b505-8\">The defendant next claims that the trial court abused its discretion by denying his motion for a new trial because there was a \u201c \u2018serious danger\u2019 \u201d that he was wrongfully convicted. Noting that appellate review of the trial court\u2019s action on this motion is more searching than that of a sufficiency of the evidence claim, the defendant again relies on the Letter Grade attendance records and inconsistencies in the victim\u2019s testimony, and contends that the jury\u2019s verdict was against the weight of the evidence presented at trial. In response, the state argues that the trial court did not abuse its discretion by denying the defendant\u2019s motion for a new trial because the school attendance records were not incontrovertible evidence that rendered the jury\u2019s findings physically impossible. We agree with the state and conclude that the trial court did not abuse its discretion by denying the defendant\u2019s motion for a new trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b505-9\">When a defendant claims that \u201che should be granted a new trial because of the serious danger that he was wrongly convicted . . . [t]he trial court should not set [aside] a verdict . . . where there [is] some evidence upon which the jury [reasonably could have] based its verdict, but [the court should set aside the verdict] where the manifest injustice of the verdict is so plain and palpable as clearly to denote that some mistake was made by the jury in the application of legal principles, or as to justify the suspicion that [the jurors] or some <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"488\">*488</page-number>of them were influenced by prejudice, corruption or partiality. . . . Within these parameters, furthermore, the trial court may set [aside] a verdict even if the evidence was conflicting and there was direct evidence in favor of the party who prevailed with the jury. . . . The authority of the trial court to set aside a verdict that is against the weight of the evidence is grounded in the fact that the action of a jury may be as unreasonable, and as suggestive of being produced by improper influences, in passing upon the credibility of witnesses and in the weighing of conflicting testimony, as in any other respect. It is one of the duties of a judge, in the due performance of his [or her] part in jury trials, to see to it that such influences, apparently operating upon the jury, do not prevail, and manifest injustice thereby be done.\u201d (Citation omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>McCarthy, </em>105 Conn. App. 596, 600-601, 939 A.2d 1195, cert. denied, 286 Conn. 913, 944 A.2d 983 (2008), quoting <em>State </em>v. <em>Griffin, </em>253 Conn. 195, 200-201, 749 A.2d 1192 (2000). \u201c[U]nlike an appellate court, the trial [court] has had the same opportunity as the jury to view the witnesses, to assess their credibility and to determine the weight that should be given to their evidence.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>McCarthy, </em>supra, 601. Consequently, we review the trial court\u2019s decision on a motion for a new trial for abuse of discretion. Id.</p>\n<p id=\"b506-6\">Having reviewed the record in the present case, we conclude that the trial court did not abuse its discretion by denying the defendant\u2019s motion for a new trial. Notwithstanding certain inconsistencies between the victim\u2019s trial testimony and her statement to the police; see footnote 18 of this opinion; a juror nevertheless reasonably could have credited the victim\u2019s testimony <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"489\">*489</page-number>regarding the sexual assault.<footnotemark>19</footnotemark> See, e.g., <em>State </em>v. <em>McCarthy, </em>supra, 105 Conn. App. 604-607 (concluding that trial court properly denied motion for new trial because \u201c[t]he jury . . . was aware of these fabrications, recantations and inconsistencies [in the testimony of a key state witness], and the assessment of a witness\u2019 credibility is a function of the jury, not of an appellate court\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b507-6\">Moreover, given the testimony of O, Kozloski, Doolan and Wisnie that the victim was absent from school for the entire day on the day of the assault, the jury had ample opportunity to consider, and reasonably reject, the defendant\u2019s proffered evidence of physical impossibility, namely, the Letter Grade report indicating that the victim had been present in school for homeroom. Cf. <em>State </em>v. <em>Whipper, </em>258 Conn. 229, 247-49, 780 A.2d 53 (2001) (trial court properly denied motion for new trial because there were explanations for fact that defendant\u2019s DNA was not found in blood samples taken from kitchen, including degradation because of environment and blood chemical factors that could have masked its presence), overruled in part on other grounds by <em>State </em>v. <em>Grant, </em>286 Conn. 499, 533-35, 944 A.2d 947, cert. denied, 555 U.S. 916, 129 S. Ct. 271, 172 L. Ed. 2d 200 (2008). Inasmuch as the trial court had ample opportunity to witness the proceedings and hear firsthand the testimony at trial that was credited by the jury, we decline to disturb the court\u2019s discretionary decision to deny the defendant\u2019s motion for a new trial.<footnotemark>20</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b508-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"490\">*490</page-number>II</p>\n<p id=\"b508-6\">COMPULSORY PROCESS CLAIMS</p>\n<p id=\"b508-7\">The defendant next claims that the state violated his federal and state constitutional rights to compulsory process by failing to give him notice that it had released Stevenson from his subpoena, thus rendering Stevenson unavailable to testify at trial when he then left the jurisdiction for a vacation. The record reveals the following additional facts and procedural history relevant to these claims. On Thursday, April 19, 2007, after the state had rested its case, the trial court denied the defendant\u2019s oral motion for a judgment of acquittal and asked the defendant if he was ready to proceed with his case. Defense counsel responded that he had several witnesses to call, but that only one, J, was ready at that time. Defense counsel stated his intention to call numerous teachers from the victim\u2019s school, but advised the court that he was unable to have subpoenas served on them because of a school vacation during the week of the trial. He also stated that he had expected the state\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"491\">*491</page-number>presentation of its case-in-chief to last longer, because the state\u2019s witness list included several police officers, namely, Wisnie, Barbara Alenckis and Stevenson, that it had not called to testify. Defense counsel then asked the trial court to permit him to call J to testify that day, and then continue the proceedings until Monday, April 23, to allow him time to subpoena the police officers to testify then, and have the teachers subpoenaed to testify the next day, Tuesday, April 24. After learning that the defendant\u2019s proposed continuance would pose scheduling problems for several jurors, the trial court continued the case, over the state\u2019s objection, to the following Thursday, April 26.</p>\n<p id=\"b509-6\">Subsequently, on Tuesday, April 24, defense counsel requested an opportunity to speak with the trial court, which convened a hearing for that afternoon. Defense counsel then advised the court that he had learned that, at some point on the preceding Thursday, April 19, the state had released Stevenson from his subpoena.<footnotemark>21</footnotemark> Defense counsel stated that, when his subpoenas were served on the police officers on Friday, April 20, he was advised that Stevenson had left for a vacation and would not return until Monday, April 30. Defense counsel then requested information from the prosecutor concerning when she had released Stevenson from his subpoena, and also asked for permission to argue that Stevenson, who was \u201ccrucial\u201d to the defendant\u2019s case, was a missing witness pursuant to <em>State </em>v. <em>Malave, </em>250 Conn. 722, 739-40, 737 A.2d 442 (1999), cert. denied, 528 U.S. 1170, 120 S. Ct. 1195, 145 L. Ed. 2d 1099 (2000).<footnotemark>22</footnotemark> <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"492\">*492</page-number>After responding to the trial court\u2019s questions for defense counsel about the legal basis for his assertion that the state was obligated to notify him prior to releasing Stevenson from the subpoena,<footnotemark>23</footnotemark> defense counsel made a comprehensive offer of proof regarding Stevenson\u2019s expected testimony, noting that Stevenson had taken oral and written statements from both the defendant and the victim, and could testify further about the defendant\u2019s cooperation during the course of the investigation. The trial court then adjourned the proceedings without ruling on the defendant\u2019s request.</p>\n<p id=\"b510-6\">Subsequently, on April 27, which was the last day of evidence, the defendant reiterated his request, which the trial court had rejected the day before, to offer into evidence his written statement, which Stevenson had taken on May 5, 2006.<footnotemark>24</footnotemark> The trial court permitted the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"493\">*493</page-number>defendant to make an offer of proof and to mark a copy of his statement for identification, although it had concluded the day before that the defendant\u2019s statement was inadmissible under the evidentiary rule set forth in <em>State </em>v. <em>Stepney, </em>191 Conn. 233, 254, 464 A.2d 758 (1983), cert. denied, 465 U.S. 1084, 104 S. Ct. 1455, 79 L. Ed. 2d 772 (1984).<footnotemark>25</footnotemark> See also footnote 24 of this opinion. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"494\">*494</page-number>Defense counsel then argued that the state\u2019s strategic decision not to introduce the teachers\u2019 testimony, as well as its decision not to elicit the testimony of the police officers in conjunction with its reliance on the <em>Stepney </em>rule, as incorporated into \u00a7 8-3 (1) (A) of the Connecticut Code of Evidence, constituted prosecutorial impropriety. In response, the state argued that it could not present its case through statements without subjecting its witnesses, including the victim, to cross-examination, and that it was \u201cunder the same constraints as a defense in that regard.\u201d The state further argued that it had provided all exculpatory matter to the defense earlier in the proceedings. The trial court concluded that it did not find any evidence of prosecutorial impropriety.<footnotemark>26</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b512-6\">After the trial court canvassed the defendant concerning his decision not to testify on his own behalf, and discussed the jury charge with the parties, defense counsel then asked the trial court about the scope to which it would permit argument with respect to the state\u2019s failure to present certain witnesses. The prosecutor argued, however, that it was concerned about having to prove a negative, in that the jury did not hear \u201cabout what investigation may or may not have been done or wasn\u2019t done.\u201d In response, the defendant argued that it was a \u201ctactical decision [the prosecutor] made that the court says is not prosecutorial impropriety .... [The prosecutor] can\u2019t have her cake and eat it too. [The prosecutor] released the witnesses and I tried to present them as best I can, and I don\u2019t <em>believe </em>\u2014 I <em>don\u2019t have the temerity to ask the court to continue this trial </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"495\">*495</page-number><em>[until] Monday </em>to have \u2014 because . . . Stevenson will be here . . . and it looks like from the court\u2019s rulings, <em>most of what he did is already into evidence, although the issue of the statement of the defendant is not in evidence, but it is in evidence through other witnesses.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b513-6\">\u201cJust like the saliva sample can be testified to . . . as being done voluntarily because that\u2019s in evidence through some of the witnesses . . . it\u2019s a situation the state has created . . . .\u201d (Emphasis added.) The trial court permitted the defendant to argue a lack of evidence, but not to suggest that the state was \u201chiding\u201d or \u201c[c]onceaiing evidence,\u201d and emphasized further that the defendant could not argue that the state had an obligation to produce a certain witness, or \u201cargue . . . because the state didn\u2019t bring in certain witnesses,\u201d that, as defense counsel stated, \u201cthey\u2019re hiding something.\u201d<footnotemark>27</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b513-7\">The parties then proceeded to give their summations. Following the jury\u2019s verdict, the defendant renewed this claim in a written motion for a new trial as a federal due process violation, contending that the prosecutor\u2019s actions were unethical and resulted in the trial court depriving him of his right to a fair trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b513-8\">A</p>\n<p id=\"b513-9\">Federal Compulsory Process Claims</p>\n<p id=\"b513-10\">The defendant first claims that the state violated his right to compulsory process under the sixth amendment to the United States constitution. See footnote 1 of this opinion. Specifically, the defendant contends that he is entitled to a new trial because the prosecutor\u2019s release <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"496\">*496</page-number>of Stevenson from his subpoena without first notifying the defendant constituted \u201c \u2018substantial interference\u2019 \u201d with Stevenson\u2019s ability to testify.<footnotemark>28</footnotemark> In response, the state relies on, inter alia, <em>State </em>v. <em>Estrella, </em>277 Conn. 458, 893 A.2d 348 (2006), and <em>State </em>v. <em>Rawls, </em>198 Conn. 111, 502 A.2d 374 (1985), and contends that the defendant has failed to prove a violation of his right to compulsory process because Stevenson\u2019s absence was not the product of state action and, most significantly, the defendant failed to seek a second continuance of the trial for purposes of exercising his subpoena rights pursuant to General Statutes \u00a7 52-143<footnotemark>29</footnotemark> upon Stevenson\u2019s return to the jurisdiction. We agree with the state and conclude that the prosecutor\u2019s release of Stevenson from his subpoena did not violate the defendant\u2019s federal right to compulsory process.</p>\n<p id=\"b515-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"497\">*497</page-number>\u201cThe federal constitution require [s] that criminal defendants be afforded a meaningful opportunity to present a complete defense. . . . The sixth amendment . . . [guarantees] the right to offer the testimony of witnesses, and to compel their attendance, if necessary, [and] is in plain terms the right to present a defense, the right to present the defendant\u2019s version of the facts as well as the prosecution\u2019s to the jury so that it may decide where the truth lies. . . . When defense evidence is excluded, such exclusion may give rise to a claim of denial of the right to present a defense. . . .</p>\n<p id=\"b515-6\">\u201cThe right to present a defense, and its concomitant right to compulsory process, are not unqualified; they are subject to countervailing public interests . . . such as the state\u2019s responsibility for arresting and prosecuting suspected criminals. <em>... To establish a violation of the right to present a defense based on lost evidence, a defendant must show that the evidence was material and exculpatory, and that it was of such a nature that the defendant would be unable to obtain comparable evidence by other reasonably available means. . . . Moreover, unless the defendant can show bad faith on the pa,rt of the state, failure to preserve potentially useful evidence does not constitute a denial of due process of law. . . . </em>Finally, the misconduct must demonstrate that the absence of [fundamental] fairness infected the trial; the acts complained of must be of such quality as necessarily prevents a fair trial.\u201d (Citations omitted; emphasis added; internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Estrella, </em>supra, 277 Conn. 487-88; see also <em>United States </em>v. <em>Valenzuela-Bernal, </em>458 U.S. 858, 867, 102 S. Ct. 3440, 73 L. Ed. 2d 1193 (1982) (\u201c[The] respondent cannot establish a violation of his constitutional right to compulsory process merely by showing that deportation of the passengers deprived him of their testimony.

See <em>State </em>v. <em>Lubesky, </em>195 Conn. 475, 478-80, 488 A.2d 1239 (1985) (rejecting compulsory process claim arising from inability to find state witness who already had testified because defendant failed to request continuance or move for mistrial); <em>Schwartzmiller v. State, </em>108 Idaho 329, 330-31, 699 P.2d 429 (App. 1985) (\u201cdefendant\u2019s diligence in exercising his sixth amendment right\u201d is \u201crelevant factual [inquiry]\u201d); <em>State </em>v. <em>Timblin, </em>254 Mont. 48, 50, 834 P.2d 927 (1992) (noting \u201cdefendant\u2019s diligence in exercising [s]ixth [a]mendment rights\u201d forms part of compulsory process inquiry). To exercise his sixth amendment compulsory process rights diligently, a defendant is required to utilize available court procedures, such as the issuance of subpoenas, as well as requests for continuances or material witness warrants that may be reasonably necessary to effectuate the service process. See, e.g., <em>United States </em>v. <em>Desena, </em>287 F.3d 170, 176 (2d Cir. 2002); <em>State </em>v. <em>Lubesky, </em>supra, 480; <em>People v. Henderson, </em>133 Ill. App. 2d 336, 343, 273 N.E.2d 244 (1971); <em>State </em>v. <em>Green, </em>448 So. 2d 782, 786-87 (La. App. 1985); <em>Young </em>v. <em>State, </em>191 P.3d 601, 606-607 (Okla. Crim. App. 2008); <em>Dean </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>30 Va. App. 49, 56-57, 515 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"499\">*499</page-number>S.E.2d 331 (1999); accord <em>State </em>v. <em>Rawls, </em>supra, 198 Conn. 119 (rejecting confrontation clause challenge to toxicological report because defendant\u2019s \u201crights were adequately protected by the available procedures for pretrial discovery . . . and subpoenaing of the witnesses] during trial,\u201d as well as motions to strike or for \u201ca continuance to allow an opportunity to subpoena the individuals who actually performed the tests\u201d [citation omitted; internal quotation marks omitted]).</p>\n<p id=\"b517-4\">We conclude that the prosecutor\u2019s release of Stevenson from his subpoena did not violate the defendant\u2019s sixth amendment right to compulsory process. Specifically, there is no evidence that the prosecutor released Stevenson from his subpoena in bad faith or with the knowledge that Stevenson would then be unable to testify at the remainder of the trial. <em>See Buie </em>v. <em>Sullivan, </em>923 F.2d 10, 12 (2d Cir. 1990) (\u201c[^peculation . . . does not permit a determination of bad faith on the part of the prosecutor\u201d). Moreover, given the fact that the trial court had ruled the defendant\u2019s voluntary statement inadmissible under <em>State </em>v. <em>Stepney, </em>supra, 191 Conn. 233, Stevenson\u2019s testimony was not critically important because the defendant himself had acknowledged that both inconsistencies in the victim\u2019s statement and Stevenson\u2019s actions during the investigation already had been admitted into evidence through other witnesses. Compare <em>Buie </em>v. <em>Sullivan, </em>supra, 11-12 (no sixth amendment violation when arrest rendering witness unavailable was based on probable cause, and witness\u2019 exculpatory statements were admitted through testimony of police officer), with <em>Singleton </em>v. <em>Lefkowitz, </em>583 F.2d 618, 623-25 (2d Cir. 1978) (defendant\u2019s compulsory process rights were violated when government released from custody material witness, who previously had failed to appear in response to defendant\u2019s subpoena, and whose testimony could have rebutted defendant\u2019s involvement in drug transaction, and trial court had <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"500\">*500</page-number>denied defendant\u2019s motion for additional continuance to secure witness\u2019 presence at trial), cert. denied sub nom. <em>Abrams </em>v. <em>Singleton, </em>440 U.S. 929, 99 S. Ct. 1266, 59 L. Ed. 2d 486 (1979).</p>\n<p id=\"b518-6\">Finally, the defendant\u2019s lack of diligence in exercising his sixth amendment rights also leads us to reject his federal compulsory process claim. Even assuming that the defendant reasonably relied on Stevenson\u2019s presence on the state\u2019s witness list, rather than subpoenaing him at the start of trial, after the defendant unsuccessfully attempted to subpoena Stevenson during the trial, he nevertheless failed to attempt to seek the continuance that would be necessary to secure Stevenson\u2019s live testimony, stating at one point that he lacked the \u201ctemerity\u201d to do so.<footnotemark>30</footnotemark> This omission is a significant factor in concluding that the defendant\u2019s federal compulsory process rights have not been violated by the prosecutor\u2019s release of Stevenson from his subpoena. See, e.g., <em>State </em>v. <em>Green, </em>supra, 448 So. 2d 786-87 (no compulsoiy process violation when state excused witness from subpoena before trial, and defendant thereafter requested issuance of new subpoena, but did not attempt to serve it; after verdict, defendant raised issue of witness\u2019 release from subpoena in motion for new trial, issued another subpoena for witness, but even after continuance granted, failed to serve subpoena); <em>Dean </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>supra, 30 Va. App. 56-57 (no compulsory process violation when prosecutor <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"501\">*501</page-number>released witness from subpoena because defendant did not issue his own subpoena or request \u201ca continuance in order to obtain the presence of the witnesses at trial\u201d); cf. <em>United States </em>v. <em>Desena, </em>supra, 287 F.3d 176 (\u201c[s]eeking only a missing witness charge was a strategic decision, and having failed to secure an acquittal, [the defendant] cannot now complain that other, unrequested remedies should have been granted sua sponte by the trial court\u201d).<footnotemark>31</footnotemark> Thus, we conclude that the defendant has failed to establish that the prosecutor\u2019s release of Stevenson from his subpoena constituted a federal compulsory process violation.<footnotemark>32</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b520-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"502\">*502</page-number>B</p>\n<p id=\"b520-6\">State Compulsory Process Claims</p>\n<p id=\"b520-7\">Supplying a complete state constitutional analysis pursuant to <em>State </em>v. <em>Geisler, </em>222 Conn. 672, 684-86, 610 A.2d 1225 (1992), the defendant next claims that the state\u2019s release of Stevenson from his subpoena violated his compulsory process rights under article first, \u00a7 8, of the Connecticut constitution. See footnote 2 of this opinion. Most significantly, the defendant relies on this court\u2019s interpretation of that provision\u2019s due process clause in <em>State </em>v. <em>Morales, </em>232 Conn. 707, 657 A.2d 585 (1995), as well <em>as Montgomery </em>v. <em>State, </em>804 N.E.2d 1217 (Ind. App.), transfer denied, 822 N.E.2d 976 (Ind. 2004), and <em>People </em>v. <em>Perez, </em>255 Mich. App. 703, 662 N.W.2d 446, vacated in part on other grounds, 469 Mich. 415, 670 N.W.2d 655 (2003), in support of a state constitutional rule requiring prosecutors to provide criminal defendants with prior notice when they intend to release a witness from subpoena, regardless of whether the prosecutor has knowledge of that witness\u2019 pending unavailability. In response, the state contends that this claim is unpreserved and that the record is inadequate for review under <em>State </em>v. <em>Golding, </em>213 Conn. 233, 239-40, 567 A.2d 823 (1989). The state also relies on <em>State </em>v. <em>Estrella, </em>supra, 277 Conn. 488-89, and contends that the state compulsory process clause should be interpreted consistently with its sixth amendment counterpart. We agree with the state and conclude that the prosecutor\u2019s release of Stevenson from his subpoena did not violate the defendant\u2019s right to compulsory process under article first, \u00a7 8, of the state constitution.</p>\n<p id=\"b520-8\">We begin with the reviewability of the defendant\u2019s state constitutional claim. Although we disagree with the defendant that he preserved this claim in his arguments to the trial court, none of which mentioned a state constitutional claim, we will grant his request and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"503\">*503</page-number>review this claim pursuant to <em>State </em>v. <em>Golding, </em>supra, 213 Conn. 239-40, under which \u201ca defendant may prevail on unpreserved claims only if: (1) the record is adequate to review the alleged claim of error; (2) the claim is of constitutional magnitude alleging the violation of a fundamental right; (3) the alleged constitutional violation clearly exists and clearly deprived the defendant of a fair trial; and (4) if subject to harmless error analysis, the state has failed to demonstrate harmlessness of the alleged constitutional violation beyond a reasonable doubt. The first two <em>Golding </em>requirements involve whether the claim is reviewable, and the second two involve whether there was constitutional error requiring a new trial.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Foreman, </em>288 Conn. 684, 692-93 n.6, 954 A.2d 135 (2008). Notwithstanding the state\u2019s argument to the contrary, we conclude that the transcript is adequate to determine the historical basis of the events that occurred during the trial of the present case, leaving any evidentiary failures for consideration under the third prong of <em>Golding, </em>namely, whether the defendant proved the clear existence of a constitutional violation that deprived him of a fair trial.<footnotemark>33</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b521-6\">\u201cIt is well established that federal constitutional and statutory law establishes a minimum national standard for the exercise of individual rights and does not inhibit state governments from affording higher levels of pro<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"504\">*504</page-number>tection for such rights. . . . Furthermore, although we often rely on the United States Supreme Court\u2019s interpretation of the amendments to the constitution of the United States to delineate the boundaries of the protections provided by the constitution of Connecticut, we have also recognized that, in some instances, our state constitution provides protections beyond those provided by the federal constitution, as that document has been interpreted by the United States Supreme Court. . . . The analytical framework by which we determine whether, in any given instance, our state constitution affords broader protection to our citizens than the federal constitutional minimum is well settled. In <em>State </em>v. <em>Geisler, </em>[supra, 222 Conn. 684-86], we enumerated the following six factors to be considered in determining that issue: (1) persuasive relevant federal precedents; (2) the text of the operative constitutional provisions; (3) historical insights into the intent of our constitutional forebears; (4) related Connecticut precedents; (5) persuasive precedents of other state courts; and (6) contemporary understandings of applicable economic and sociological norms, or as otherwise described, relevant public policies.\u201d<footnotemark>34</footnotemark> (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>McKenzie-Adams, </em>281 Conn. 486, 509-10, 915 A.2d 822, cert. denied, 552 U.S. 888, 128 S. Ct. 248, 169 L. Ed. 2d 148 (2007).</p>\n<p id=\"b522-8\">As the state observes, this case is not our first opportunity to consider the contours of the state constitution\u2019s compulsory process clause. In <em>State </em>v. <em>Estrella, </em>supra, 277 Conn. 488-89, we recently concluded that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"505\">*505</page-number>the state compulsory process provision did not provide greater protections than did the federal constitution with respect to a criminal defendant\u2019s inability to subpoena a witness who had been deported by the federal government. Discussing the textual and historical factors, we concluded that there is no such \u201cbasis for assigning independent meaning to our state constitutional provision.\u201d Id., 489; see also id., 489 n.19 (noting \u201cslight textual difference in the two provisions\u201d but \u201cfailing] to see how this difference would have any practical effect\u201d). We also noted that the defendant in <em>Estrella </em>had not pointed us to any Connecticut or sister state case law that supported his request for enhanced protection under the state constitution and had \u201cadvanced no compelling policy considerations to warrant a broader reading of the state compulsory process clause.\u201d Id., 489.</p>\n<p id=\"b523-6\">In his briefs, the defendant in the present case does not, however, ask us to overrule or limit <em>Estrella. </em>He does, however, rely on the independent state due process analysis from <em>State </em>v. <em>Morales, </em>supra, 232 Conn. 707, in support of his argument that \u201cthe state constitution offers defendants vast protections regarding the calling of witnesses \u2014 even greater than those offered by the federal constitution \u2014 to ensure that defendants may adequately defend themselves against criminal charges.\u201d In <em>Morales, </em>in considering whether the state\u2019s failure to preserve potentially useful evidence, specifically a jacket worn by a sexual assault victim that had contained semen stains from the attack, violated a defendant\u2019s due process right to a fair trial, we followed the vast majority of our sister states that have considered the issue under their own constitutions, and rejected the federal \u201cbad faith\u201d standard articulated in <em>Arizona </em>v. <em>Youngblood, </em>488 U.S. 51, 57-58, 109 S. Ct. 333, 102 L. Ed. 2d 281 (1988).<footnotemark>35</footnotemark> <em>State </em>v. <em>Morales, </em>supra, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"506\">*506</page-number>726-27. In so concluding, this court performed a complete <em>Geisler </em>analysis and elected to continue applying, as a matter of state constitutional law, the balancing test from <em>State </em>v. <em>Asherman, </em>193 Conn. 695, 724, 478 A.2d 227 (1984), cert. denied, 470 U.S. 1050, 105 S. Ct. 1749, 84 L. Ed. 2d 814 (1985),<footnotemark>36</footnotemark> that had been utilized prior to the United States Supreme Court\u2019s decision in Youngblood.<footnotemark>37</footnotemark> <em>State </em>v. <em>Morales, </em>supra, 719-20.</p>\n<p id=\"b524-6\">We conclude that <em>Morales </em>does not alter our conclusion in <em>Estrella </em>that Connecticut case law does not support a broader reading of the state compulsory process clause. <em>Morales </em>is readily distinguishable from the present case with respect to the permanency of the unavailability of the evidence or testimony at issue and, therefore, the ultimate fairness of the defendant\u2019s trial. Put differently, this case does not involve the destruc<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"507\">*507</page-number>tion, disposal or total loss of evidence but, rather, temporary witness unavailability that, as a constitutional matter, is attributable to the defendant\u2019s own failure to take the action necessary to exercise the rights provided him under the state compulsory process clause, either by issuing his own subpoenas prior to trial pursuant to \u00a7 52-143, or attempting to seek a continuance during trial, to enable that action.</p>\n<p id=\"b525-6\">Turning to the other <em>Geisler </em>factors, the defendant has not pointed to, and our independent research has not disclosed, any decisions wherein the courts of our sister states have construed their state constitutions as providing greater protections with respect to the prosecution\u2019s release from subpoena of one of its witnesses.<footnotemark>38</footnotemark> Thus, the two decisions that the defendant does cite, <em>Montgomery </em>v. <em>State, </em>supra, 804 N.E.2d 1217, and <em>People </em>v. <em>Perez, </em>supra, 255 Mich. App. 703, are considered more appropriately under the public policy factor, which encompasses \u201ceconomic/sociological considerations.\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Geisler, </em>supra, 222 Conn. 685. In <em>Montgomery, </em>an arson case, the state rested its case without calling two insurance company investigators, whose reports contradicted in part the findings of the police, and then released them from subpoena, leaving the defendant unable to subpoena them himself in time to testify at trial. <em>Montgomery </em>v. <em>State, </em>supra, 1220. The court concluded that the failure of the defendant\u2019s trial counsel to seek a continuance to subpoena the investigators for live testimony, rather than reading a deposition into evidence, was constitutionally ineffective assistance because the case against the defendant was entirely circumstantial and amounted to a battle of the experts. Id., 1221-22. The court, did, however, admonish the prosecutor for his failure to \u201cinform [the defendant], whose witness list included those witnesses <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"508\">*508</page-number>listed by the [s]tate ... or seek permission from the trial court to release the witnesses from the court\u2019s subpoena.\u201d (Citation omitted.) Id., 1222 n.6. While not attributing its decision to any particular legal source, the court stated that, under Indiana law, \u201conce a witness is served with a subpoena, the witness is under court order to appear, and cannot be unilaterally dismissed without permission from the court that issued the subpoena. Further, given the substantial time and cost that go towards service of process, duplicative service of subpoenas is unnecessary and unwarranted when one party has clearly served the subpoena prior to trial.\u201d<footnotemark>39</footnotemark> Id.</p>\n<p id=\"b526-6\">As a practical matter, we agree with the defendant that it would be an efficient best practice for the prosecutor to notify both the court and the defendant prior to releasing its witnesses from subpoena, particularly if there is a likelihood that the witnesses will become unavailable to be subpoenaed by the defendant later in the trial. This procedure is not, however, presently required by statute or a rule of practice, and we decline to implement it as a rule of state constitutional law, given that the defendant\u2019s compulsory process rights <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"509\">*509</page-number>already are protected by existing statutes and court procedures, including \u00a7 52-143, as well as the potential availability of continuances in the case of temporarily missing material witnesses. Thus, with only one of the <em>Geisler </em>factors providing any support at all for the defendant\u2019s claim, and the defendant having failed to avail himself of existing procedures to attempt to secure Stevenson\u2019s presence, we conclude that the state constitution\u2019s compulsory process clause does not provide him with greater protection in the present case.</p>\n<p id=\"b527-4\">Ill</p>\n<p id=\"b527-5\">PROSECUTORIAL IMPROPRIETY CLAIMS</p>\n<p id=\"b527-6\">We next address the defendant\u2019s claim that prosecutorial impropriety deprived him of his constitutional right to a fair trial. Specifically, he claims that the prosecutor improperly: (1) acted intentionally to render Stevenson, a critical defense witness, unavailable to testify during trial; and (2) during closing argument, expressed \u201cher opinion regarding the [victim\u2019s] character, the [victim\u2019s] veracity, and, ultimately, what the evidence at trial demonstrated.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b527-7\">A</p>\n<p id=\"b527-8\">The Prosecutor\u2019s Release of Stevenson from Subpoena</p>\n<p id=\"b527-9\">We first consider whether the prosecutor\u2019s actions regarding the release of Stevenson from the subpoena constituted prosecutorial impropriety. The defendant relies on the venerable rule of <em>State </em>v. <em>Guilfoyle, </em>109 Conn. 124, 145 A. 761 (1929), <em>and State </em>v. Mitchell, 169 Conn. 161, 362 A.2d 808 (1969), overruled in part on other grounds by <em>State </em>v. <em>Graham, </em>200 Conn. 9, 509 A.2d 493 (1986), and contends that the prosecutor \u201cshirked her responsibility to bring forth every relevant witness before the trial court,\u201d and also \u201cintentionally and overtly prevented [the defendant] from, himself, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"510\">*510</page-number>placing the truth before the jury.\u201d<footnotemark>40</footnotemark> Notwithstanding the lack of evidence of bad faith on the part of the prosecutor; see part II of this opinion; we agree, however, with the state that subsequent case law has made clear that the <em>Guilfoyle </em>rule is one of disclosure, akin to that of <em>Brady </em>v. <em>Maryland, </em>373 U.S. 83, 83 S. Ct. 1194, 10 L. Ed. 2d 215 (1963), and that there was no <em>Guilfoyle </em>violation because the defendant was aware of Stevenson and the potential substance of his testimony, and could have taken action to procure his testimony. See <em>State </em>v. <em>Mitchell, </em>supra, 165; see also <em>State </em>v. <em>Johnson, </em>57 Conn.

Accordingly, we conclude that the state had no obligation to call Stevenson to the stand under <em>Guilfoyle, </em>and that the state satisfied its disclosure obligation, as there is no dispute that the defendant was fully aware of the potential substance of Stevenson\u2019s anticipated testimony and, indeed, was able to make comprehensive offers of proof about it, and then ultimately determine that it had been covered by the testi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"511\">*511</page-number>mony of the other police officers.<footnotemark>41</footnotemark> See footnotes 23 and 24 of this opinion and the accompanying text.</p>\n<p id=\"b529-6\">B</p>\n<p id=\"b529-7\">Claims Arising from Certain Remarks by the Prosecutor during Closing Arguments</p>\n<p id=\"b529-8\">The defendant next claims that, during closing arguments, the prosecutor improperly expressed her personal opinion regarding the victim\u2019s character and veracity and, ultimately, what the evidence at trial demonstrated. It is well settled that unpreserved claims that prosecutorial impropriety deprived a defendant of a fair trial are reviewed in two separate steps, the first of which is to ascertain whether impropriety occurred in the first instance, and the second of which is to determine whether that impropriety deprived the defendant of his due process right to a fair trial. See, e.g., <em>State </em>v. <em>Angel T., </em>292 Conn. 262, 274-75, 973 A.2d 1207 (2009); <em>State </em>v. <em>Williams, </em>204 Conn. 523, 540, 529 A.2d 653 (1987).</p>\n<p id=\"b529-9\">The defendant first challenges the prosecutor\u2019s observations regarding the victim\u2019s courage, namely, that, \u201cI would submit <em>she testified bravely\u201d; </em>and (2) \u201c[w]hen you look at [the victim\u2019s] testimony, I submit to you that it will show you not only is she a <em>courageous girl </em>to have stood up within her family and pointed an accusing finger at her uncle, but that her testimony\u2019s credible and it is corroborated . . . .\u201d (Emphasis added.) The state effectively concedes that these two comments were improper emotional appeals to the juiy\u2019s sympathies. See, e.g., <em>State </em>v. <em>Ceballos, </em>266 Conn. 364, 395-96, 832 A.2d 14 (2003). Accordingly, we con<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"512\">*512</page-number>sider subsequently their impact on the fairness of the defendant\u2019s trial. See part III C of this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b530-4\">The defendant next challenges the propriety of the prosecutor\u2019s statement during rebuttal argument that, \u201cI don\u2019t ask for any excuses for [the victim\u2019s] testimony. I don\u2019t believe she needs any. I believe she told you what happened. She was accurate here in the courtroom. She was as accurate as she could be in her written statement and her story remains the same.\u201d The defendant contends that this statement was an improper expression of the prosecutor\u2019s personal belief about the veracity of the victim as a witness. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b530-5\">It is well settled that \u201c[a] prosecutor may not express his own opinion, directly or indirectly, as to the credibility of the witnesses. . . . Nor should a prosecutor express his opinion, directly or indirectly, as to the guilt of the defendant. . . . Such expressions of personal opinion are a form of unsworn and unchecked testimony, and are particularly difficult for the jury to ignore because of the prosecutor\u2019s special position. . . . Moreover, because the jury is aware that the prosecutor has prepared and presented the case and consequently, may have access to matters not in evidence ... it is likely to infer that such matters precipitated the personal opinions. ... It is not, however, improper for the prosecutor to comment upon the evidence presented at trial and to argue the inferences that the jurors might draw therefrom ....</p>\n<p id=\"b530-6\">\u201cAlthough prosecutors generally should try to avoid using phrases that begin with the pronoun I, such as I think or I believe, we recognize that the use of the word I is part of our everyday parlance and . . . because of established speech patterns, it cannot always easily be eliminated completely from extemporaneous elocution. . . . Therefore, if it is clear that the prosecutor is arguing from the evidence presented at trial, instead of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"513\">*513</page-number>giving improper unsworn testimony with the suggestion of secret knowledge, his or her occasional use of the first person does not constitute [impropriety].\u201d (Citations omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Luster, </em>279 Conn. 414, 435-36, 902 A.2d 636 (2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b531-6\">Viewing the prosecutor\u2019s comment in context, we <em>agree </em>with the state <em>that, </em>it \u201cis clear that the prosecutor is arguing from the evidence presented at trial, instead of giving improper unsworn testimony with the suggestion of secret knowledge . . . .\u2019\u2019Id., 436. This statement simply operated to rebut the portion of the defendant\u2019s summation emphasizing the inconsistencies between the victim\u2019s statement and her trial testimony, and is consistent with the rule permitting \u201c[a] prosecutor . . . properly [to] comment on the credibility of a witness where . . . the comment reflects reasonable inferences from the evidence adduced at trial.\u201d<footnotemark>42</footnotemark> (Internal quotation marks omitted.) Id., 438.</p>\n<p id=\"b531-7\">C</p>\n<p id=\"b531-8\">Due Process Analysis</p>\n<p id=\"b531-9\">We now apply the well established six factor analysis from <em>State </em>v. <em>Williams, </em>supra, 204 Conn. 540,<footnotemark>43</footnotemark> to deter<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"514\">*514</page-number>mine whether the state has established beyond a reasonable doubt that the prosecutorial impropriety, namely, the prosecutor\u2019s description of the victim as courageous and brave, did not deprive the defendant of a fair trial. See <em>State </em>v. <em>Angel T., </em>supra, 292 Conn. 287-88. This analysis requires us to \u201cview the prosecutor\u2019s comments in the context of the entire trial\u201d and determine \u201cwhether there is a reasonable likelihood that the jury\u2019s verdict would have been different absent the sum total of the improprieties.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) Id., 287.</p>\n<p id=\"b532-6\">With respect to the first <em>Williams </em>factor, the state concedes that the defendant did not invite the impropriety. Regarding the second factor, namely, the severity of the impropriety, it is well settled that a defendant\u2019s failure to object or to seek curative measures at trial supports the state\u2019s contention that the impropriety was not severe. Id., 289. \u201cDefense counsel\u2019s failure to object at trial is, however, not by itself fatal to a defendant\u2019s claim .... Thus, the apparent lack of severity with respect to the impropriety is counterbalanced in part by the third <em>Williams </em>factor, namely, the frequency of the [impropriety] . . . .\u201d (Citations omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.) Id. Having reviewed the record, we conclude that the improper remarks were infrequent in nature, occurring only twice during closing arguments. See, e.g., <em>State </em>v. <em>Johnson, </em>107 Conn. App. 188, 195-96, 203, 944 A.2d 416 (two instances of improper argument not frequent), cert. denied, 288 Conn. 905, 953 A.2d 650 (2008); <em>State </em>v. <em>Jose G., </em>102 Conn. App. 748, 767, 929 A.2d 324 (2007) (four improper questions not frequent), affd, 290 Conn. 331, 963 A.2d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"515\">*515</page-number>42 (2009). Moreover, the two improper remarks were isolated to a discrete part of the trial, both occurring during the prosecutor\u2019s principal summation. Cf. <em>State </em>v. <em>Warholic, </em>278 Conn. 354, 398, 897 A.2d 569 (2006) (\u201cthe instances of prosecutorial [impropriety] were not isolated because they occurred during both the cross-examination of the defendant and the prosecutor\u2019s closing and rebuttal arguments\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b533-6\">The fourth <em>Williams </em>factor, \u201cthe centrality of the [impropriety] to the critical issues in the case\u201d; <em>State </em>v. <em>Williams, </em>supra, 204 Conn. 540; supports the defendant, as comments implying that the victim testified truthfully or otherwise supporting her credibility are particularly significant, as \u201cwithout independent physical evidence to prove that the defendant had sexually assaulted [the victim], or even that [the victim] had been sexually assaulted at all, the significance of the [prosecutor\u2019s] improper conduct increases considerably.\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Ceballos, </em>supra, 266 Conn. 416-17.</p>\n<p id=\"b533-7\">With respect to the fifth factor, namely, \u201cthe strength of the curative measures adopted\u201d; <em>State </em>v. <em>Williams, </em>supra, 204 Conn. 540; the state concedes that the trial court did not employ any corrective measures directed specifically at the improper remarks, but did give a general instruction to the jury, explaining its role and its sole power to decide facts and determine credibility. Although \u201c \u2018a general instruction does not have the same curative effect as a charge directed at a specific impropriety\u2019 \u201d; <em>State </em>v. <em>Warholic, </em>supra, 278 Conn. 401; when a defendant, as here, fails to object at trial, he \u201cbears much of the responsibility for the fact that these claimed improprieties went uncured,\u201d especially because \u201cdefense counsel\u2019s failure to object to the prosecutor\u2019s argument . . . when [they were] made suggests that defense counsel did not believe that [they were] unfair in light of the record of the case at the time. . . . Moreover . . . defense counsel may elect not to object to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"516\">*516</page-number>arguments . . . that he or she deems marginally objectionable for tactical reasons, namely, because he or she does not want to draw the jury\u2019s attention to [them] or because he or she wants to later refute that argument .... The same principles hold true in regard to requests for special instructions. The failure by the defendant to request specific curative instructions frequently indicates on appellate review that the challenged instruction did not deprive the defendant of a fair trial.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Angel T., </em>supra, 292 Conn. 291.</p>\n<p id=\"b534-6\">Finally, we consider the sixth <em>Williams </em>factor, namely, \u201cthe strength of the state\u2019s case.\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Williams, </em>supra, 204 Conn. 540. \u201c[W]e have never stated that the state\u2019s evidence must have been overwhelming in order to support a conclusion that prosecutorial [impropriety] did not deprive the defendant of a fair trial.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Angel T., </em>supra, 292 Conn. 293. We disagree with the defendant\u2019s reliance on the school attendance records and the testimony of the victim\u2019s homeroom teachers, who created them, in support of his contention that the state\u2019s case was not strong because there was evidence that the victim was present at school at the time of the assault. As previously discussed, the jury reasonably could have relied on the testimony of O, Doolan, Kozloski and Wisnie to conclude that the Letter Grade attendance records were the product of an unfortunately timed computer coding error made by the victim\u2019s homeroom teachers. Moreover, with respect to the defendant\u2019s claim that the victim\u2019s testimony was inconsistent, contradictory and substantially uncorroborated by physical evidence,<footnotemark>44</footnotemark> none of the claimed inconsisten<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"517\">*517</page-number>cies negates the essential elements of the offenses charged. Further, the victim\u2019s testimony was corroborated by her descriptions of the green bin of pornographic movies, and evidence of her changed demeanor in the days following May 1. Finally, there was no deadlock to indicate that the present case was a close one in the juiy\u2019s eyes. See id., 294 (\u201cmultiple reports of juiy deadlock indicate that the fact finder itself did not view the state\u2019s case against the defendant as particularly strong\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b535-6\">Having reviewed all of the <em>Williams </em>factors, we conclude that the state has demonstrated, beyond a reasonable doubt, the reasonable likelihood that the jury\u2019s verdict would not have been different absent the impropriety in the present case. Although the impropriety was uninvited, the remarks by the prosecutor during her closing argument, describing the victim as brave and courageous, were neither frequent nor severe. Furthermore, while the impropriety related to a central portion of the state\u2019s case, the defendant\u2019s failure to seek curative measures at trial further indicates a lack of severity. Moreover, the state\u2019s case was relatively strong in that it was not wholly dependent on the uncorroborated testimony of the victim, and there is no indication that the jury felt otherwise. Accordingly, we conclude that the prosecutorial impropriety did not deprive the defendant of a fair trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b535-7\">The judgment is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b535-8\">In this opinion the other justices concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b496-11\"> The sixth amendment to the United States constitution provides: \u201cIn all criminal prosecutions, the accused shall enjoy the right to a speedy and public trial, by an impartial jury of the State and district wherein the crime shall have been committed, which district shall have been previously ascertained by law, and to be informed of the nature and cause of the accusation; to be confronted with the witnesses against him; to have compulsory process for obtaining witnesses in his favor, and to have the assistance of counsel for his defense.\u201d \u201cThe sixth amendment rights to confrontation and to compulsory process are made applicable to the states through the due process clause of the fourteenth amendment.\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Gilberto L., </em>292 Conn. 226, 229 n.2, 972 A.2d 205 (2009).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b496-12\"> Article first, \u00a7 8, of the constitution of Connecticut provides in relevant part: \u201cIn all criminal prosecutions, the accused shall have a right to be heard by himself and by counsel; to be informed of the nature and cause of the accusation; to be confronted by the witnesses against him; to have compulsory process to obtain witnesses in his behalf ....

The state, however, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"483\">*483</page-number>introduced testimony from O and several of the victim\u2019s teachers, discussed further in part I of this opinion, indicating that these records were erroneous, and that she was in fact absent from school for that entire day.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"13\">\n<p id=\"b501-8\"> The defendant also claimed that the state improperly had failed to: (1) introduce the defendant\u2019s oral and written statements made during the course of the police investigation, thus forcing him either to testify or keep the jury from receiving those potentially material statements; and (2) develop material evidence \u2014 namely, S\u2019s cellular telephone records \u2014 necessary to prove that the victim and S were not committing perjury when they testified that the victim had not used S\u2019s cellular telephone to call the defendant to pick her up from school in the afternoon on the date of the assault. Along with rejecting these claims, the trial court also denied the defendant\u2019s motion for posttrial discovery of S\u2019s cellular telephone records.

Using Letter Grade, the homeroom teachers, without the benefit of a seating chart, would look out at the twenty-eight students seated in the classroom and then mark only the absent students; students present in the classroom did not have a mark recorded next to their name. We note, however, Negron\u2019s testimony that she paid special attention to the victim\u2019s attendance record because the victim had a history of excessive absences.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"16\">\n<p id=\"b504-7\"> Kozloski also testified, however, that the victim previously had cut her class in the beginning of the marking period when she had not been aware that she was supposed to be in Kozloski\u2019s class.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"17\">\n<p id=\"b504-8\"> The defendant points, for example, to the victim\u2019s testimony that she did not have Toucet, who testified at trial, as a teacher, or even know who she was.

In our view, <em>Palomba </em>stands only for the proposition that the decision to grant a new trial is a discretionary one that lies primarily with the trial court, which had the opportunity to view the proceedings firsthand.

The trial court then sustained the state\u2019s objection, concluding that the defendant\u2019s questions called \u201cfor pure hearsay.\u201d Defense counsel then raised the still unresolved issue of whether he would be permitted to refer to Stevenson\u2019s absence as a factor contributing to the weakness of the state\u2019s case.</p>\n<p id=\"b510-10\">Defense counsel then stated his \u201coffer of proof . . . that . . . Stevenson if he\u2019s available would have been able to testify as to the calling [of] the defendant down to the police station the early afternoon of May 5, 2006, and talking to the defendant and taking an oral statement from him as to his whereabouts on May 1 and what he did with [the victim] ... on May 1 as far as picking her up and taking her to school and then dropping her off and receiving a cell phone call from her later in the after \u2014 early afternoon, wanting to be picked up and going to school and picking her up. That would have been admissible through Stevenson.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"ApWB\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"493\">*493</page-number>\u201cAlso, testimony as to his voluntarily giving . . .

Alenckis that she took a written statement from the defendant on June 14, 2006, but . . . Stevenson\u2019s testimony is still very important to the case, and we feel that we should be able to comment on the state\u2019s failure to call him, especially under the circumstances where the state released him from their subpoena without letting us know that [it] was releasing him from [its] subpoena, so that we could have guaranteed that he would have been here at a reasonable time.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AnL\">\u201cAnd we would cite <em>[State </em>v. <em>Malave, </em>supra, 250 Conn. 722], for the proposition that the court can [in] its discretion have an evidentiary hearing to determine the issue of the missing witness if there\u2019s a claim of the state that it\u2019s not [the state\u2019s] fault that he\u2019s missing.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"A3Aj\">In response, the prosecutor argued that Stevenson\u2019s testimony would be cumulative, and also that the defendant\u2019s out-of-court statements could not be admitted through Stevenson as an alternative to in-court testimony. The prosecutor concluded by arguing that the court \u201ccertainly has the right to indicate it\u2019s not going to have another delay for nonessential cumulative evidence.\u201d After rebuttal argument from defense counsel to the effect that this court\u2019s decision in <em>State </em>v. <em>Stepney, </em>191 Conn. 233, 464 A.2d 758 (1983), cert. 65 U.S. 1084, 104 S.

Ed. 2d 772 (1984); see footnote 25 of this opinion; should be extended to permit the defendant to introduce his own written statement, the trial court concluded that the defendant\u2019s statement was inadmissible.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"25\">\n<p id=\"b511-11\"> In <em>State </em>v. <em>Stepney, </em>supra, 191 Conn. 254, this court concluded that, even if the defendant chooses not to testify at trial, the state could introduce into evidence \u201cstatements voluntarily made to agents of the government or of statements made to third parties\u201d because there is \u201cno persuasive reason why the privilege [against self-incrimination] should be thus enlarged to exclude from the trier of fact, at the option of the defendant, reliable and probative evidence of voluntary statements made by the defendant.\u201d Accord <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"494\">*494</page-number>Conn.

The trial court rejected this claim, which the defendant does not renew on appeal.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"27\">\n<p id=\"b513-11\"> During this exchange, after the trial court stated its intention to give \u201ccounsel a wide swath on argument,\u201d the prosecutor noted her \u201cconcern [that] if [defense counsel] is going to be making claims about me not presenting certain witnesses, he has equal power to have presented them.\u201d Defense counsel again emphasized that he did not \u201chave equal powers to the witness, because [Stevenson is] gone because of what [the prosecutor] did. I don\u2019t have equal powers.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"28\">\n<p id=\"b514-6\"> Our review of the record reveals that the defendant did not raise his federal compulsory process claim at trial, choosing instead to focus on obtaining permission to make a missing witness argument pursuant to <em>State </em>v. <em>Malave, </em>supra, 250 Conn. 722, and to raise a due process prosecutorial impropriety claim in his posttrial motions. Further, in his principal brief, the defendant does not seek review of any unpreserved federal constitutional claims pursuant to the bypass procedure of <em>State </em>v. <em>Golding, </em>213 Conn. 233, 239-40, 567 A.2d 823 (1989). Ordinarily, this would preclude review of his federal constitutional claims based on the compulsory process clause, which were not raised at trial. See, <em>e.g., Lebron v. Commissioner of Correction, </em>274 Conn. 507, 532, 876 A.2d 1178 (2005). Because the defendant has, however, properly requested <em>Golding </em>review of his state constitutional claims in his brief, we will exercise our discretion to review his federal constitutional claims pursuant to <em>Golding, </em>as well.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"29\">\n<p id=\"b514-7\"> General Statutes \u00a7 52-143 provides in relevant part: \u201c(a) Subpoenas for witnesses shall be signed by the clerk of the court or a commissioner of the Superior Court and shall be served by an officer, indifferent person or, in any criminal case in which a defendant is represented by a public defender or special assistant public defender, by an investigator of the Division of Public Defender Services.

Although we agree that the failure to seek a continuance is not by itself fatal, it is nevertheless significant given the lack of evidence of bad faith on the part of the prosecutor and the fact that Stevenson\u2019s testimony would have been cumulative and otherwise of limited value. Most importantly, a continuance in the present case likely would have provided the defendant with the opportunity to examine Stevenson, unlike in those cases wherein witnesses were rendered completely unavailable by actions such as deportation.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"31\">\n<p id=\"b519-6\"> See also <em>United States </em>v. <em>Desena, </em>supra, 287 F.3d 176 (\u201c [m]ore important, [the defendant] has not shown [that the detective] could not have been located had the defense requested a continuance\u201d); <em>State </em>v. <em>Lubesky, </em>supra, 195 Conn. 480 (rejecting compulsory process claim arising from defendant\u2019s inability to find and recall state witness because defendant failed to request continuance or move for mistrial); <em>People </em>v. <em>Henderson, </em>supra, 133 Ill.
