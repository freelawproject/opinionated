Cantrell, a federal prisoner serving a 70-month sentence for conspiring to manufacture and distribute methamphetamine, 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 846, and manufacturing methamphetamine, 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 841, appeals the district court\u2019s <em>sua sponte </em>dismissal of his petition for a writ of habeas corpus, 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2241. His habeas pe<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"652\">*652</page-number>tition sought to challenge the validity of his federal conviction on two grounds: (1) that the district court lacked jurisdiction over the offense because Congress had not enacted 21 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 841 and 846 into law, and the offenses had not occurred on U.S. property, but within the state of Missouri; and (2) his conviction and sentence violated the rule announced in <em>Apprendi v. New Jersey, </em>530 U.S. 466, 120 S.Ct. 2348, 147 L.Ed.2d 435 (2000), because the indictment did not reference a drug quantity.</p>\n<p id=\"b674-4\">The government has filed a motion for summary disposition of the appeal. We conclude that the district court properly determined that Cantrell could not raise his claims challenging the validity of his federal conviction through a habeas petition brought pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2241 as he does not meet the requirements of the savings clause contained in 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255. Moreover, Cantrell has not demonstrated that he is actually innocent as his claims fail upon an examination of the merits. Thus, we <em>grant </em>the government\u2019s motion and affirm the dismissal of the habeas petition.</p>\n<p id=\"b674-5\">Cantrell is mistaken in his belief that Congress did not enact 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 841. On October 27, 1970, Congress enacted the Comprehensive Drug Abuse Prevention and Control Act of 1970, Pub. L. No. 91-513, Tit. II, \u00a7\u00a7 401, 406, 84 Stat. 1260, 1265, codified at 21 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 841 and 846. Thus, the crimes embodied by these statutes do not represent mere regulations promulgated by the Attorney General.</p>\n<p id=\"b674-6\">Cantrell\u2019s claim that the district court lacked jurisdiction because his criminal conduct occurred in a state (and not on federally owned land, a territory, or the District of Columbia) also fails. Congress has provided that: \u201cThe district courts of the United States shall have original jurisdiction, exclusive of the courts of the States, of all offenses against the laws of the United States.\u201d 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3231. The trial court\u2019s jurisdiction under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3231 is not restricted to crimes occurring on federally owned property. <em>United States v. Mundt, </em>29 F.3d 233, 237 (6th Cir.1994); <em>see also Prou v United States, </em>199 F.3d 37, 45 (1st Cir.1999) (\u201ca federal district court plainly possesses subject-matter jurisdiction over drug cases\u201d); <em>United States v. Lussier, </em>929 F.2d 25, 26 (1st Cir.1991) (rejecting \u201cterritorial\u201d jurisdiction argument in criminal tax case).</p>\n<p id=\"b674-8\">To the extent that Cantrell\u2019s claim can be construed as a general challenge to the constitutionality of the statutes of conviction, we note that the statutes at issue, 21 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 841, 846, were not enacted pursuant to Congress\u2019s general police powers over its territories and the District of Columbia, but, rather, under Congress\u2019s power to regulate commerce. With this in mind, we have upheld their constitutionality. <em>See United States v. Zorrilla, </em>93 F.3d 7, 8-9 (1st Cir.1996)(holding that drug trafficking is precisely the kind of economic enterprise that substantially affects interstate commerce and that, therefore, comes within Congress\u2019s regulatory power under the Commerce Clause).</p>\n<p id=\"b674-9\">Cantrell\u2019s <em>Apprendi </em>argument would fail even if <em>Apprendi </em>could be considered retroactively applicable to cases on collateral review (which is not the case). The rule in <em>Apprendi </em>is that, \u201c[ojther than the fact of a prior conviction, any fact that increases the penalty for a crime beyond the prescribed statutory maximum must be submitted to a jury, and proved beyond a reasonable doubt.\u201d 530 U.S. at 490. This rule has not been violated because Cantrell\u2019s 70-month sentence fell far below the 20-year maximum statutory sentence applicable to drug crimes without reference to drug quantity. <em>See United States </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"653\">*653</page-number><em>v. Campbell, </em>268 F.3d 1, 7 (1st Cir.2001)(finding no <em>Apprendi </em>violation when the district court sentences a defendant below the default statutory maximum applicable to crimes without reference to drug quantity); <em>see also </em>21 U.S.C. \u00a7 841(b)(1)(C) (setting default statutory maximum). Likewise, his three-year term of supervised release was within the default statutory maximum.</p>\n<p id=\"A8q\"><em>Affirmed. </em>Loc.R. 27(c).</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
