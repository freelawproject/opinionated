If so, we need not address whether the Board improperly required He to provide corroborative evidence to support his application. The Board had jurisdiction under 8 C.F.R. \u00a7\u00a7 3.1(b)(3) and 240.53(a), and we have jurisdiction over this timely petition pursuant to 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(b).</p>\n<p id=\"b624-16\">He argues that the Board should not have based its adverse credibility determination on what was characterized as emotionless, vague, and unpersuasive testimony. Nothing in He\u2019s testimony or arguments on appeal, however, compels a contrary finding. <em>See Chen v. INS, </em>266 F.3d 1094, 1098 (9th Cir.2001) (citing 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(b)(4)(B) (Supp. II 1996)).</p>\n<p id=\"b624-21\">He next asserts that the discrepancies in the household registry do not detract from his credibility and therefore are not an appropriate basis for the Board\u2019s adverse credibility finding. He argues that it is \u201cwithin the realm of reasonable possibility\u201d that the discrepancy regarding his second son\u2019s birthplace was due to an error by a Chinese bureaucrat and that the Board\u2019s reliance on this discrepancy is therefore misplaced. While it is certainly possible that the discrepancy is due to an administrative error, that possibility does not \u201ccompel\u201d the conclusion that He\u2019s version of events is true. There is substantial evidence in the record as a whole to support the Board\u2019s adverse credibility finding.</p>\n<p id=\"b624-22\">Petition DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"***\">\n<p id=\"b624-29\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and may not be cited to or by the courts of this circuit except as may be provided by Ninth Circuit Rule 36-3.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
