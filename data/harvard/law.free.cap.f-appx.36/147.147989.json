McNeil appeals only the district court\u2019s rulings regarding her racial discrimination and age discrimination claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b178-4\">We have reviewed the parties\u2019 briefs, the joint appendix, and the district court\u2019s order and find no reversible error. The district court correctly determined McNeil failed to establish a prima facie case of discriminatory discharge or age discrimination because she failed to establish that she was performing at a level that met her employer\u2019s legitimate job expectations, or that she was replaced by someone outside her protected class or someone within her protected class but significantly younger than she. <em>See Brinkley v. Harbour Recreation Club, </em>180 F.3d 598, 607 (4th Cir. 1999); <em>EEOC v. Sears Roebuck &amp; Co., </em>243 F.3d 846, 851 (4th Cir.2001). Furthermore, even if McNeil could establish a prima facie case, she has presented no evidence of pretext. <em>See Reeves v. Sanderson Plumbing Prods., Inc., </em>530 U.S. 133, 137-39, 120 S.Ct. 2097, 147 L.Ed.2d 105 (2000). Accordingly, we affirm on the reasoning of the district court. <em>McNeil v. Hospice of N. Va., </em>No. CA-01-178-A (E.D. Va. filed Sept. 25, 2001; entered Sept. 28, 2001). We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b178-5\">\n<em>AFFIRMED.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
