Because substantial evidence supports the Board\u2019s adverse credibility determination, we need not address whether the Board improperly required Ma to provide corroborative evidence to support his application. The Board had jurisdiction under 8 C.F.R. \u00a7\u00a7 3.1(b)(3) and 240.53(a), and we have jurisdiction over this timely petition pursuant to 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(b).</p>\n<p id=\"b654-22\">Ma asserts that the Board should not have discredited his testimony because there are reasonable explanations (other than Ma\u2019s untruthfulness) for the inconsistencies and oddities in his testimony. Whether there are plausible explanations under which Ma\u2019s story might be true is not the appropriate test. Rather, we review the Board\u2019s administrative findings to determine whether \u201cany reasonable adjudicator would be compelled to conclude to the contrary.\u201d <em>Chen v. INS, </em>266 F.3d 1094, 1098 (9th Cir.2001) (citing 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(b)(4)(B) (Supp. II 1996)). Ma was unable to provide concrete evidence even of his marriage, so the importance of his credibility was heightened. Ma gave highly suspect testimony. The Board provided specific, cogent reasons for discounting his testimony. The discrepancies in Ma\u2019s testimony regarding his wife\u2019s forced abortion are material because the incident is critical to his asylum claim. <em>See De Leon-Barrios v. INS, </em>116 F.3d 391, 393-94 (9th Cir. 1997). As such, they are sufficient to support the Board\u2019s adverse credibility determination. <em>Id. </em>The evidence does not compel a finding contrary to that reached by the Board.</p>\n<p id=\"b654-23\">Ma next argues that the Board should have remanded the case for a hearing which would consider Ma\u2019s cooperation with American authorities in prosecuting the individuals who smuggled him into <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"633\">*633</page-number>Guam. A motion to reopen must be supported by \u201caffidavits and other evidentiary material.\u201d 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 3.23(b)(3).</p>\n<p id=\"b655-5\">The Board did not deny Ma\u2019s motion solely on the basis that Ma had failed to raise it before the Immigration Judge. Rather, the Board examined the merits of Ma\u2019s assertion, and held that Ma\u2019s \u201cgeneralized statement\u201d on appeal was \u201cunsupported by any facts or documentary evidence relevant to his fear of harm or analysis under applicable case law.\u201d The Board found that Ma had not provided a sufficient evidentiary basis for remand. Therefore, the Board\u2019s denial of Ma\u2019s request was not an abuse of discretion, because the Board offered a \u201creasoned explanation for its decision.\u201d <em>See Konstantinova v. INS, </em>195 F.3d 528, 529 (9th Cir.1999).</p>\n<p id=\"b655-6\">Petition DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"***\">\n<p id=\"b654-24\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and may not be cited to or by the courts of this circuit except as may be provided by Ninth Circuit Rule 36-3.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
