Khalsa challenges the denial of his motion to suppress evidence obtained during an allegedly illegal stop at the Greensboro, North Carolina, train station.</p>\n<p id=\"b121-23\">Khalsa contends that the police officers did not possess sufficiently reliable information to warrant an investigatory stop. The district court held that Khalsa\u2019s encounter with the police was not a detention or a stop. We review the district court\u2019s factual findings on a denial of a suppression motion for clear error and its legal conclusions de novo, <em>United States v. Rusher, </em>966 F.2d 868, 873 (4th Cir.1992), construing the evidence in the light most favorable to the party who prevailed below. <em>United States v. Seidman, </em>156 F.3d 542, 547 (4th Cir.1998). The encounter at issue occurred in a public area, the train platform, and two plain clothed officers with concealed weapons identified themselves and asked to speak to Khalsa while another officer waited at a distance. Khal-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"92\">*92</page-number>sa agreed to speak with the officers. On these facts, we conclude this was not an investigatory stop under <em>Terry v. Ohio, </em>392 U.S. 1, 88 S.Ct. 1868, 20 L.Ed.2d 889 (1968). <em>See Florida v. Royer, </em>460 U.S. 491, 497, 103 S.Ct. 1319, 75 L.Ed.2d 229 (1983); <em>United States v. Mendenhall, </em>446 U.S. 544, 553-54, 100 S.Ct. 1870, 64 L.Ed.2d 497 (1980).</p>\n<p id=\"b122-4\">Khalsa further contends his consent to the search of his baggage was involuntary because the investigating officer did not respond to his inquiry regarding his right to refuse consent to a search of his baggage; he raises this claim under the Fifth Amendment as interpreted in <em>Miranda v. Arizona, </em>384 U.S. 436, 86 S.Ct. 1602, 16 L.Ed.2d 694 (1966). The police are not required to inform investigative subjects of their rights prior to seeking consent to search. <em>See Ohio v. Robinette, </em>519 U.S. 33, 39, 117 S.Ct. 417, 136 L.Ed.2d 347 (1996). Khalsa\u2019s argument does not demonstrate clear error in the district court\u2019s ruling, after the hearing on the motion to suppress, that Khalsa consented to the search of his bags. <em>Rusher, </em>966 F.2d at 873; <em>see Schneckloth v. Bustamonte, </em>412 U.S. 218, 249, 93 S.Ct. 2041, 36 L.Ed.2d 854 (1973).</p>\n<p id=\"b122-5\">Accordingly, we affirm the district court\u2019s order denying Khalsa\u2019s motion to suppress. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid in the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b122-6\">\n<em>AFFIRMED.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
