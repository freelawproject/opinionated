We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b592-6\">Johnson originally pleaded guilty to conspiracy to distribute cocaine and cocaine base, in violation of 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 846, for which he was sentenced \u2014 following a downward departure for substantial assistance \u2014 -to 4 years of probation. The district court subsequently revoked probation and sentenced Johnson to 24 months\u2019 imprisonment and 2 years of supervised release, after finding that Johnson had violated the conditions of his probation. On appeal, Johnson challenges both the decision to revoke his probation and the sentence imposed. We reject both challenges.</p>\n<p id=\"b592-7\">At the revocation hearing, Johnson admitted that he had been arrested for driving while intoxicated and had twice tested positive for cocaine. The district court expressed concern that Johnson needed to learn the consequences of his actions, and noted that the Bureau of Prisons\u2019 intensive drug treatment might benefit Johnson. We find no abuse of discretion in the district court\u2019s decision to revoke probation. <em>See United States v. Leigh, </em>276 F.3d 1011, 1012 (8th Cir.2002) (standard of review). The court also did not abuse its discretion in deviating from the advisory range suggested by the Sentencing Guidelines, and the sentence did not exceed (and in fact was well below) the Guidelines range applicable to the original offense. <em>See </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7 7B1.4, p.s., comment, (n.4) (sentence above recommended range may be warranted where defendant originally ben-efitted from downward departure that resulted in sentence below Guidelines range applicable to underlying conduct); <em>United States v. Iversen, </em>90 F.3d 1340, 1345 (8th Cir.1996) (discussing probation revocation sentencing); <em>United States v. Carr, </em>66 F.3d 981, 983 (8th Cir.1995) (per curiam) (district court may deviate from Chapter 7\u2019s suggested sentence when in its considered discretion departure is warranted). Finally, we reject Johnson\u2019s challenge to his supervised-release term. <em>See </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7 7B1.3(g)(1), p.s.; <em>United States v. Hobbs, </em>981 F.2d 1198 (11th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>510 U.S. 832, 114 S.Ct. 103, 126 L.Ed.2d 69 (1993).</p>\n<p id=\"b592-11\">The judgment is affirmed. Counsel\u2019s motion to withdraw is granted.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b592-8\">.
