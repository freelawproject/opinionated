Taylor moves for preparation of a transcript at government expense and for permission to proceed in forma pauperis (IFP) on appeal. We deny him the transcript; grant him leave to appeal IFP, leaving the fee-collection details to the district court in accordance with 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(b); and affirm the judgment of the district court.</p>\n<p id=\"b259-13\">We review the grant of summary judgment de novo, <em>see Cooper v. Olin Corp., </em>246 F.3d 1083, 1087 (8th Cir.2001), and we may affirm the judgment on any ground supported by the record, <em>see Miller v. Benson, </em>51 F.3d 166, 170 (8th Cir.1995). After thoroughly reviewing the record, we conclude that there were no genuine issues of material fact concerning defendants\u2019 liability. Taylor\u2019s claims against defendants Nurse Wendy Maglothin and Infirmary Administrator Rebekah Davis boil down to a disagreement as to the recommended treatment for his hernias and with Nurse Maglothin\u2019s decision not to schedule him for a doctor\u2019s appointment. <em>See Vaughan v. Lacey, </em>49 F.3d 1344, 1346 (8th Cir.1995) (disagreement as to proper course of treatment is not actionable under Eighth Amendment). Further, there was no proof that the remaining defendants were involved in the medical treatment decisions. <em>See Keeper v. King, </em>130 F.3d 1309, 1314 (8th Cir.1997) (prison official not involved in treatment decisions made by medical unit\u2019s staff cannot be liable for medical staffs diagnostic decisions).</p>\n<p id=\"b259-16\">Accordingly, we affirm. <em>See </em>8th Cir. R. 47A(a).</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b259-14\">. The Honorable Jerry W. Cavaneau, United States Magistrate Judge for the Eastern District of Arkansas, to whom the case was referred for final disposition by consent of the parties pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 636(c).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
