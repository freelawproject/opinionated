Eginton, <em>Judge, </em>dismissing his claims brought under 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983 alleging that defendants prison officials violated his rights under the Eighth Amendment to the Constitution, principally in connection with the presence of asbestos in the prison. The district court dismissed the action on the ground that defendants who are sued in their official capacities as state employees are immune under the Eleventh Amendment from a claim for damages and because Mejia\u2019s claims have not been exhausted in accordance with 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1997e(a). On appeal, Mejia appears to contend principally (1) that his action was maintainable as a <em>Bivens </em>action <em>(Bivens v. Six Unknown Named Agents of Federal Bureau of Narcotics, </em>403 U.S. 388, 91 S.Ct. 1999, 29 L.Ed.2d 619 (1971)), and (2) that exhaustion should not have been required because his claims arose prior to the effective date of \u00a7 1997e(a) and because it was not clear that the exhaustion requirement applied to claims for money damages. Finding no merit in his contentions, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b491-13\"><em>Bivens </em>actions for violations of civil rights have been held available in certain circumstances against agents of the federal government, but the Supreme Court \u201cha[s] consistently refused to extend <em>Bivens </em>liability to any ... new category of defendants.\u201d <em>Correctional Services Corp. v. Malesko, </em>534 U.S. 61, 122 S.Ct. 515, 520, 151 L.Ed.2d 456 (2001). The defendants named by Mejia are not federal agents but agents of the State of Connecticut. Accordingly, the district court properly did not treat his action as a <em>Bivens </em>action. Although a civil rights action may be brought under 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983 against a \u201cperson\u201d acting under color of state law, state officials sued in their official capacities have Eleventh Amendment immunity from suit, and hence are not considered \u201cperson[s]\u201d within the meaning of \u00a7 1983, <em>see Howlett v. Rose, </em>496 U.S. 356, 365, 110 S.Ct. 2430, 110 L.Ed.2d 332 (1990); <em>Will v. Michigan Department of State Police, </em>491 U.S. 58, 71, 109 S.Ct. 2304, 105 L.Ed.2d 45 (1989). Mejia has made no argument on appeal to indicate that his claims were asserted against the defendants in their individual capacities.</p>\n<p id=\"b491-14\">The district court also properly ruled that Mejia\u2019s claims with respect to the conditions of his confinement could not be maintained because he had not exhausted his administrative remedies. We reject Mejia\u2019s contention that the exhaustion requirement was inapplicable on the ground that his suit, brought in 2000, asserted claims that arose as early as 1994, prior to the 1996 effective date of \u00a7 1997e(a). Although the exhaustion requirement in \u00a7 1997e(a) could not properly be applied to an action that was already pending on the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"468\">*468</page-number>date the section became effective, it does apply \u201cto actions that ha[d] yet to be brought.\u201d <em>Salahuddin v. Mead, </em>174 F.3d 271, 274 (2d Cir.1999) (internal quotation marks omitted). Further, subsequent to the entry of judgment in this case, the Supreme Court made clear that \u00a7 1997e(a)\u2019s exhaustion requirement is applicable regardless of the type of relief sought. <em>See Porter v. Nussle, </em>534 U.S. 516, 122 S.Ct. 983, 152 L.Ed.2d 12 (2002).</p>\n<p id=\"b492-4\">We have considered all of Mejia\u2019s contentions on this appeal and have found them to be without merit. The judgment of the district court is affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
