Greene appeals the district court\u2019s judgment dismissing his 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2241 (1994) petition. Greene\u2019s case was referred to a magistrate judge pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 686(b)(1)(B) (1994). The magistrate judge recommended that relief be denied and advised Greene that failure to file timely objections to this recommendation could waive appellate review of a district court order based upon the recommendation. Despite this warning, Greene failed to object to the magistrate judge\u2019s recommendation.</p>\n<p id=\"b195-6\">The timely filing of objections to a magistrate judge\u2019s recommendation is necessary to preserve appellate review of the substance of that recommendation when the parties have been warned that failure to object will waive appellate review. <em>See Wright v. Collins, </em>766 F.2d 841, 845-46 (4th Cir.1985); <em>see also Thomas v. Arn, </em>474 U.S. 140, 106 S.Ct. 466, 88 L.Ed.2d 435 (1985). Greene has waived appellate review by failing to file objections after receiving proper notice. Accordingly, we affirm the judgment of the district court. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b195-7\">\n<em>AFFIRMED.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
