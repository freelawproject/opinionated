The IJ entered an order of deportation <em>in absentia </em>when So-lorzano-Ahumada failed to appear for his scheduled deportation hearing. Solorza-no-Ahumada contends that the order was an abuse of discretion because he did not receive notice of the hearing as required by \u00a7 242B of the Immigration and Nationality Act (\u201cINA\u201d), 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252b(a)(2) (1995).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> We have jurisdiction under 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1105a (1995).</p>\n<p id=\"b283-22\">Our review is for abuse of discretion. <em>Garcia v. INS, </em>222 F.3d 1208, 1209 (9th Cir.2000). We will not disturb the BIA\u2019s ruling unless it has acted \u201carbitrarily, irrationally, or contrary to law.\u201d <em>Eide-Ka-hayon v. INS, </em>86 F.3d 147, 149 (9th Cir. 1996) (citations and internal quotations omitted). We review <em>de novo </em>the BIA\u2019s determination of purely legal questions. <em>Singh v. INS, </em>213 F.3d at 1052.</p>\n<p id=\"b283-23\">Solorzano-Ahumada contends that he lived at the same address for three years. However, he offers no proof that he ever provided his correct address to the INS or that he ever received mail from the INS at the incomplete address. Thus, he failed to meet his burden of showing that the INS had his complete address and failed to include the apartment number in the Order to Show Cause.</p>\n<p id=\"b283-24\">Section 3.15 of the Code of Federal Regulations makes the alien\u2019s obligation to provide a correct address explicit, stating in relevant part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b283-25\">(d)(1) If the alien\u2019s address ... on the Order to Show Cause or Notice to Ap<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"258\">*258</page-number>pear is incorrect, the alien must provide to the Immigration Court where the charging document has been filed, within five days of service of that document, a written notice of an address and telephone number at which the alien can be contacted.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b284-4\">8 C.F.R. \u00a7 3.15 (1997). Solorzano-Ahumada offers no evidence of compliance or even an explanation of his failure to comply.</p>\n<p id=\"b284-5\">Because notice was sent by certified mail to Solorzano-Ahumada\u2019s last known address, service was presumptively effective. <em>Arrieta v. INS, </em>117 F.3d 429, 431 (9th Cir.1997). Solorzano-Ahumada did not show that nondelivery was not due to his failure to provide his correct address. Thus, he cannot overcome the presumption. <em>In re Grijalva, </em>Int. Dec. 3246, 1995 WL 314388 (BIA April 28, 1995).</p>\n<p id=\"b284-6\">Petition DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"***\">\n<p id=\"b283-19\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and may not be cited to or by the courts of this circuit except as provided by Ninth Circuit Rule 36-3.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b283-20\">. The Illegal Immigration Reform and Immigrant Responsibility Act of 1996 (\"IIRIRA\u201d), Pub.L. 104-208, 110 Stat. 3009 (Sept. 30, 1996), <em>as amended by </em>Pub.L. No. 104\u2014302, 110 Stat. 3656 (Oct. 11, 1996), repealed this section. However, the IIRIRA provides transitional rules that apply to cases where the deportation proceedings commenced prior to April 1, 1997, and in which a final deportation order was issued on or after October 30, 1996. The transitional rules provide that the INA applies as codified prior to the passage of the IIRIRA. <em>See </em>IIRIRA \u00a7\u00a7 306(c)(1), 309(a); <em>Singh v. INS, </em>213 F.3d 1050, 1051 n. 1 (9th Cir.2000). Because Solorzano-Ahumada\u2019s deportation proceedings commenced on July 24, 1996, and a final order of deportation was issued on July 26, 2000, we have jurisdiction under the pre-IIRIRA judicial review provision of the INA. <em>See </em>8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1105a (1995).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
