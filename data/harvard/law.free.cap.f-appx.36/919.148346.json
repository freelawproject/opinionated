We have jurisdiction pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291 and 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3742. We review de novo the district court\u2019s interpretation and application of the Sentencing Guidelines. <em>United States v. Franklin, </em>235 F.3d 1165, 1168 (9th Cir. 2000). We review for clear error the district court\u2019s determination that a defendant is not entitled to a reduction in his offense level for acceptance of responsibility. <em>United States v. Villasenor-Cesar, </em>114 F.3d 970, 973 (9th Cir.1997). We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b942-7\">Ayala-Sanabria contends that his 1986 second-degree burglary conviction under California Penal Code \u00a7 459 does not qualify as an aggravated felony warranting enhancement of his sentence under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2L1.2(b)(1)(A), because the state statute covers both conduct that would constitute burglary under the federal definition in <em>Taylor v. United States, </em>495 U.S. 575, 598-99, 110 S.Ct. 2143, 109 L.Ed.2d 607 (1990) and conduct that would not. The district court, however, did not err by finding that the pre-sentence report contained sufficient reliable and uncontroverted evidence that Ayala-Sanabria committed a burglary as defined by <em>Taylor. See United States v. Romero-Rendon, </em>220 F.3d 1159, 1163 <em>&amp; </em>n. 4 (9th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>531 U.S. 1043, 121 S.Ct. 640, 148 L.Ed.2d 546 (2000).</p>\n<p id=\"b942-11\">Ayala-Sanabria\u2019s contention that the district court violated his rights under <em>Apprendi v. New Jersey, </em>530 U.S. 466, 120 S.Ct. 2348, 147 L.Ed.2d 435 (2000) is foreclosed by our decision in <em>United States v. Pacheco-Zepeda, </em>234 F.3d 411, 414 (9th Cir.) (as amended), <em>cert. denied, </em>532 U.S. 966, 121 S.Ct. 1503, 149 L.Ed.2d 388 (2001).</p>\n<p id=\"b942-12\">Finally, Ayala-Sanabria contends that the district court erred by finding that he was not entitled to an adjustment for acceptance of responsibility under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3E1.1. This contention lacks merit because this is not one of those rare situations where a defendant has clearly accepted responsibility despite having gone to trial. <em>See </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3E1.1, cmt. n. 2; <em>United States v. McKinney, </em>15 F.3d 849, 852 (9th Cir.1994).</p>\n<p id=\"b942-13\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b942-9\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and may not be cited to or by the courts of this circuit except as may be provided by Ninth Circuit Rule 36-3.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
