Stein of the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York, sitting by designation.</p>\n</footnote>\n<opinion data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"majority\">\n<p id=\"b680-13\">SUMMARY ORDER</p>\n<p id=\"b680-14\">ON CONSIDERATION WHEREOF, IT IS HEREBY ORDERED, ADJUDGED AND DECREED that the judgment of the district court be and it hereby is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<p id=\"b680-15\">Petitioner Hector Aguirre appeals from the January 10, 2001 judgment of the district court denying his habeas corpus petition brought pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254. Aguirre seeks to vacate his 1995 state conviction for the murder of Jacqueline Holman. He argues that the state courts abridged his right to remain silent by failing to suppress the confession he gave to a police detective after repeatedly stating that he could not talk about \u201cJackie\u201d because he had Chirvonne \u2014 his girlfriend whom he had stabbed in an unrelated incident \u2014 on his mind. Aguirre confessed to the murder of Jackie Holman while in police custody after he had been properly read his <em>Miranda </em>warning.</p>\n<p id=\"b680-16\">Under the Antiterrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act (\u201cAEDPA\u201d), to obtain a writ of habeas corpus Aguirre must show that the state court\u2019s rejection of his claim \u201cwas contrary to, or involved an unreasonable application of\u2019 clearly established Supreme Court precedent, 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254(d)(1), or \u201cresulted in a decision that was based on an unreasonable determination of the facts in light of the evidence presented in the State court proceedings.\u201d 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254(d)(2).</p>\n<p id=\"b680-17\">The trial court conducted a pretrial hearing with respect to Aguirre\u2019s motion to suppress his confession. The court determined that Aguirre\u2019s statement that he could not talk about Jackie did not amount even to an equivocal invocation of his right to remain silent. The court found that his <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"659\">*659</page-number>remark was an expression of his obsession with what had happened to Chirvonne, rather than an invocation of his right not to talk about Jackie. This finding does not represent an unreasonable determination of the evidence under \u00a7 2254(d)(2).</p>\n<p id=\"b681-5\">Once the court had determined that Aguirre\u2019s statement was not an invocation of his right to remain silent, its legal determination that Aguirre was not entitled to have his subsequent confession suppressed was manifestly not contrary to, nor an unreasonable application of, Supreme Court law.</p>\n<p id=\"b681-6\">Petitioner argues that in reviewing his conviction the Appellate Division misunderstood federal law. Even if we agreed, it would be of no consequence. Where the trial court made no <em>error </em>in admitting the confession, faulty analysis by an appellate court would not convert a proper receipt of evidence into a violation of a constitutional right.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
