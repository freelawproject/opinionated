We have jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291. We review entry of summary judgment de novo, <em>Lopez v. Smith, </em>203 F.3d 1122, 1131 (9th Cir.2000) (en banc), and we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b939-24\">After a boating accident on the Yellowstone River, Stanko was cited and arrested by appellee Jeff Scott, a game warden for the State of Montana. Stanko\u2019s bare allegation that he was arrested for exercising his right against self-incrimination does not create a genuine issue of material fact as to pretext, because the arrest was independently supported by probable cause. <em>See United States v. Hudson, </em>100 F.3d 1409, 1415 (9th Cir.1996).</p>\n<p id=\"b939-25\">Stanko\u2019s contention that the warrantless search of his boat violated the Fourth Amendment lacks merit because the district court properly found that the search was supported by probable cause. <em>See United States v. Albers, </em>136 F.3d 670, 674 (9th Cir.1998).</p>\n<p id=\"b939-26\">An adequate postdeprivation state remedy exists for Stanko\u2019s alleged property loss, so his section 1983 due process claim is barred. <em>See </em>Mont.Code Ann. \u00a7 46-5-312 (2001); <em>Blueford v. Prunty, </em>108 F.3d 251, 256 (9th Cir.1997).</p>\n<p id=\"b940-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"918\">*918</page-number>Finally, the district court did not abuse its discretion by declining to exercise supplemental jurisdiction over Stanko\u2019s state law claims. <em>See Brown v. Lucky Stores, Inc., </em>246 F.3d 1182, 1189 (9th Cir.2001).</p>\n<p id=\"b940-4\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b939-27\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and may not be cited to or by the courts of this circuit except as may be provided by Ninth Circuit Rule 36-3.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
