We affirm. Even if the evidence meets the first two requirements of a <em>Brady </em><footnotemark>1</footnotemark> violation, it fails to meet the third: prejudice.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b290-26\">Prejudice, in this context, involves establishing \u201ca reasonable probability of a different result\u201d at trial had the evidence not been withheld.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Williams has not done so. Had counsel known that Schlemmer had seen the photograph, he would have had additional support for his motion seeking a special identification procedure, and he might have chosen to present a pretrial motion to suppress. In addition, he could have prepared to cross-examine Schlem-mer more fully. Williams fails to show how any of these things establish a reasonable probability that the result of his trial would have differed. And, in light of the rest of the facts, we see no such probability ourselves.</p>\n<p id=\"b290-27\">The district court correctly concluded that the state court proceedings did not result in a \u201cdecision that was contrary to, or involved an unreasonable application of, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"265\">*265</page-number>clearly established Federal law.\u201d<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Accordingly, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b291-5\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b290-28\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and may not be cited to or by the courts of this circuit except as may be provided by Ninth Circuit Rule 36-3.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b290-29\">. <em>Brady v.
