(\u201cBFI\u201d) and BFI Waste Management Systems, in Bowens\u2019 personal injury action. By order dated June 13, 2001, Judge Skretny adopted the Report and Recommendation of United States Magistrate Judge H. Kenneth Schroeder, and dismissed the action.</p>\n<p id=\"b40-9\">On appeal, Bowens challenges the lower court\u2019s conclusion that as a matter of law, Bowens was a \u201cspecial employee\u201d of BFI. Bowens also challenges (for the first time) the removal of this action to federal court on the basis that there is no diversity of citizenship.</p>\n<p id=\"b40-10\">We are satisfied that diversity jurisdiction exists. Bowens is a citizen of New York, and defendant BFI Waste Systems of North America, Inc. is incorporated and maintains its principal place of business outside New York. The other named defendant, BFI Waste Management Systems, a/k/a BFI Waste Management Systems, Inc., is not an existing corporate entity. Since Bowens seeks $1.5 million in damages, the amount in controversy exceeds $75,000. <em>See </em>28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1441.</p>\n<p id=\"b40-11\">With respect to Bowens\u2019 challenge on the determination of his status of a \u201cspecial employee,\u201d we affirm the judgment of the district court for substantially the reasons stated in Judge Skretny\u2019s Order dated June 13, 2001, and Magistrate Judge Schroeder\u2019s Report and Recommendation and Order dated April 12, 2001. We also find that plaintiffs challenge to the removal lacks merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b40-12\">For the reasons set forth above, the judgment of the district court is hereby AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
