Rankins, who is African-American, argued that the prosecution improperly exercised a peremptory challenge against the last African-American member of his voir dire panel.</p>\n<p id=\"b321-5\">We review the district court\u2019s decision to grant a \u00a7 2254 habeas petition de novo. <em>Alvarado v. Hill, </em>252 F.3d 1066, 1068 (9th Cir.2001). Because Rankins\u2019 petition was filed after April 24, 1996, it is subject to the Antiterrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act of 1996 (\u201cAEDPA\u201d). <em>Lockhart v. Terhune, </em>250 F.3d 1223, 1228 (9th Cir.2001). Under AEDPA, we can reverse a state court\u2019s decision denying relief only if the decision either was \u201ccontrary to, or involved an unreasonable application of, clearly established Federal law, as determined by the Supreme Court of the United States\u201d or \u201cbased on an unreasonable determination of the facts in light of the evidence presented in the state court proceeding.\u201d 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254(d).</p>\n<p id=\"b321-6\">The state argues, and the trial court and the California Court of Appeal agreed, that under <em>Batson v. Kentucky, </em>476 U.S. 79, 106 S.Ct. 1712, 90 L.Ed.2d 69 (1986), the prosecutor\u2019s stated reasons for exercising the questioned peremptory challenge were rational and nondiscriminatory. A trial court\u2019s finding regarding whether a prosecutor\u2019s use of a peremptory challenge was discriminatory is entitled to a presumption of correctness and will not be disturbed unless the district court finds that the trial court committed clear error. <em>See McClain v. Prunty, </em>217 F.3d 1209, 1220 (9th Cir. 2000). \u201cSince the trial judge\u2019s findings in the context under consideration here largely will turn on evaluation of credibility, a reviewing court ordinarily should give those findings great deference.\u201d <em>Batson, </em>476 U.S. at 98 n. 21, 106 S.Ct. 1712. Here, the prosecutor stated that he excluded persons involved in educational employment, including the voir dire person in question. In addition to the African-American voir dire person, he excluded four other persons who worked in education, but did not exercise a challenge against one retired teacher. Furthermore, the prosecutor stated that he excluded the voir dire person because she gave short, incomplete answers in response to the jury questionnaire and did not appear to be forthcoming with information. The prosecutor also excluded four other persons he found to be less than forthcoming with their answers to the questionnaire.</p>\n<p id=\"b321-8\">\u201c[A] state court factual determination is unreasonable if it is so clearly incorrect that it would not be debatable among reasonable jurists.\u201d <em>Jeffries v. Wood, </em>114 F.3d 1484, 1500 (9th Cir.) (en banc), <em>cert. denied, </em>522 U.S. 1008, 118 S.Ct. 586, 139 L.Ed.2d 423 (1997), <em>overruled on other grounds by Lindh v. Murphy, </em>521 U.S. 320, 117 S.Ct. 2059, 138 L.Ed.2d 481 (1997). The case before us is a close one but we give deference to the findings of the trial court that actually saw and heard the voir dire proceedings. The trial court concluded that the prosecutor\u2019s stated reasons for exercising the challenge were rational and race-neutral and the state appellate court agreed. We conclude that the state court\u2019s determination that the prosecutor\u2019s reasons were not discriminatory was not an unreasonable determination of the facts in light of the evidence. Because we so hold, we need not decide whether the prosecutor\u2019s act of stating reasons for his use of the challenge rendered moot the need for the court to find that Rankins had established a prima facie case for <em>Batson </em>purposes.</p>\n<p id=\"b321-9\">REVERSED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"***\">\n<p id=\"b320-28\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and may not be cited to or by the courts of this circuit except as may be provided by Ninth Circuit Rule 36-3.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-4\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b321-10\">HAWKINS, Circuit Judge,</author>\n<p id=\"ALy\">dissenting.</p>\n<p id=\"b321-11\">HAWKINS, Circuit Judge.</p>\n<p id=\"b321-12\">I respectfully dissent. In a close case, an African-American defendant saw the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"298\">*298</page-number>only potential African-American juror challenged by the prosecutor. Facing a <em>Batson </em>challenge, the prosecutor provided a two-part justification: (1) that he challenged all potential jurors who were \u201cinvolved in education\u201d \u2014 yet he allowed a retired teacher to sit (someone much closer to being \u201cinvolved in education\u201d than someone who \u201cworked\u201d \u2014 in what capacity we do not know \u2014 at a local community college); and (2) that he did not like her \u201cshort form\u201d answers to the juror questionnaire \u2014 yet many of the jurors who went unchallenged gave similarly brief responses (the trial judge admitted he had \u201cencouraged\u201d the rapid filling out of the forms by potential jurors). These explanations are gossamer at best and smack of pretext. I would defer to the judgment of the district judge, a seasoned trial veteran who carefully considered the record and chose to grant the writ.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
