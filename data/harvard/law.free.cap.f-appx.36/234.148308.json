Mendoza-Paz, </em>286 F.3d 1104, 1110, 1114 (9th Cir.2002) (\u00a7 960 is constitutional); <em>United States v. Buck-land, </em>289 F.3d 558 (9th Cir.2002) (en banc) (\u00a7 841 is constitutional).</p>\n<p id=\"b260-26\">(2) Roy essentially concedes that <em>Ap-prendi </em>does not require vacation of his sentence. We agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b260-27\">(3) James asserts error under <em>Apprendi </em>on the basis that the issue of drug quantity was not submitted to the jury. Because he did not object at trial, we apply the plain error standard. <em>See Buckland, </em>277 F.3d at 1178. That means that we must decide whether there was error; if so, whether it was plain; and if so, whether it affected substantial rights. <em>See United States v. Olano, </em>507 U.S. 725, 732-35, 113 S.Ct. 1770, 1777-78, 123 L.Ed.2d 508 (1993); <em>see also United States v. Cotton, </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"235\">*235</page-number>\u2014 U.S. -, 122 S.Ct. 1781, 1785, \u2014 L.Ed.2d - (2002). If the answer to each of those questions is yes, we must then decide if the error \u201c\u2018seriously affect[ed] the fairness, integrity or public reputation of judicial proceedings.\u2019\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 736, 113 S.Ct. at 1179 (citation omitted). There can be no doubt that there was error in this case and that it was plain. But James\u2019 case founders because, for example, there is no contest that the amounts in the packages that James was convicted of sending amounted to far more than 50 grams of methamphetamine, and that placed him in the 10 years to life statutory range.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> <em>See </em>21 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 841(b)(1)(A), 960(b)(1). Thus, \u201cit appears beyond all doubt that the <em>Apprendi </em>error in this case did not affect the outcome of the proceedings, and, accordingly, did not affect [James\u2019] substantial rights.\u201d <em>Buckland, </em>at 1184. \u201cFinally, even were we to assume that the error here did affect substantial rights, we would affirm nonetheless because, given the evidence and the record ..., the error did not \u2018seriously affect the fairness, integrity, or public reputation of judicial proceedings.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1178 (citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b261-7\">(3) Richard\u2019s claim founders for the same basic reason that James\u2019 does. As to Richard, there is no real contest that, if guilty at all, his involvement was in far more than the minimum amount required to expose him to a life sentence under the relevant statutes.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Here, too, we would not exercise our discretion to reverse for <em>Apprendi </em>error in any event.</p>\n<p id=\"b261-8\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"****\">\n<p id=\"b260-28\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and may not be cited to or by the courts of this circuit except as provided by Ninth Circuit Rule 36-3.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b260-29\">.

We, of course, recognize that James contests his guilt. That, however, does not affect the quantity, and it is quantity that we must focus upon here.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b261-24\">.
