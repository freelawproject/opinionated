Jackson has not engaged in substantial gainful activity since July 18, 1993, and alleges that she became disabled in February 1993 due to a severe fracture of the scapula.</p>\n<p id=\"b523-9\">Our role as a reviewing court is limited to determining whether the Commissioner\u2019s decision is supported by substantial evidence, which is \u201csuch relevant evidence as a reasonable mind might accept as adequate to support a conclusion.\u201d <em>Richardson v. Perales, </em>402 U.S. 389, 401, 91 S.Ct. 1420, 28 L.Ed.2d 842 (1971) (quotation and citation omitted); see also 42 U.S.C. 405(g), 1383(c)(3). We are bound by the ALJ\u2019s findings of fact if they are supported by substantial evidence in the record. <em>Plummer v. Apfel, </em>186 F.3d 422, 427 (3d Cir.1999).</p>\n<p id=\"b523-10\">Jackson challenges the ALJ\u2019s decision on essentially two grounds. We have carefully considered Jackson\u2019s arguments and find that they lack merit. In particular, we agree with the District Court that the ALJ does not bear the burden of establishing that Jackson\u2019s past relevant work is \u201csubstantial gainful activity\u201d or that she performed the job for a significant period of time. See <em>Wallace v. Sec\u2019y of HHS, </em>722 F.2d 1150, 1153 (3d Cir.1983) (per curiam). Further, it is well within the discretion of the ALJ to discount the opinion of Dr. Mylod, who did not examine Jackson, in relation to the testimony of Dr. Ahamed and Dr. Schwartz, both of whom did examine Jackson and reached the same conclusion, i.e., that Jackson was capable of performing her past relevant work. See 20 C.F.R. 404.1527(d)(1).</p>\n<p id=\"b523-12\">For the reasons substantially stated in the well-reasoned and thorough opinion of the District Court, we find that the ALJ\u2019s decision was supported by substantial evidence and we therefore affirm.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
