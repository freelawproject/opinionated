Her appeal challenges the district court\u2019s conclusion that, based on the factors articulated in <em>United States v. Wauneka, </em>770 F.2d 1434 (9th Cir.1985), she was not \u201cin custody\u201d for the purposes of <em>Miranda v. Arizona, </em>384 U.S. 436, 86 S.Ct. 1602, 16 L.Ed.2d 694 (1966), when she signed a written statement confessing to the crime. We have jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291. We have carefully reviewed the record and affirm for the reasons set forth in the district court\u2019s Order Denying Defendant\u2019s Motion to Suppress Statements of April 13, 2000.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b334-20\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b334-15\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and may not be cited to or by the courts of this circuit except as may be provided by Ninth Cir. R. 36-3.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b334-16\">. We note one minor disagreement with the district court\u2019s findings. In applying the <em>Wauneka </em>factor of the extent to which Mendoza was confronted with evidence of guilt, the district found that \u201c[t]he agents clearly did not confront Defendant with any physical evidence of guilt.\u201d . Mendoza\u2019s written confession, however, which was prepared by the interrogating agents, states that, during the course of the interrogation, Special Agent Crosson confronted her with the incriminating letters: \"Mr. CROSSON showed me copies of envelopes which were addressed to various persons, and the letters which were <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"311\">*311</page-number>contained in the envelopes.\u201d The district court\u2019s error in this regard does not, however, affect its holding because it nonetheless found that Crosson's accusatory statements had \"the same psychological effect as confrontation by physical evidence.\u201d Thus, the error does not affect the outcome of the <em>Wauneka </em>balancing test.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
