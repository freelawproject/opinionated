Dep\u2019t of Defense, </em>169 F.Supp.2d 140 (E.D.N.Y.2001). The final agency action that Fogel challenges occurred in January 1982, when the Secretary of the Air Force, adopting the recommendation of the Department of Defense Civilian/Military Review Board, determined that service during World War II in the United States Maritime Service would not be considered active military service in the U.S. Armed Forces for purposes of conferring veteran status under the GI Bill Improvement Act of 1977, Pub.L. No. 95-202, 91 Stat. 1433 (codified as amended in scattered sections of 38 U.S.C.). Thus, Fogel\u2019s complaint, to be timely, had to be filed by January 1988. <em>See </em>28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2401 (civil actions against the United States must be commenced within six years after the right of action first accrues); <em>Polanco v. US. Drug Enforcement Admin., </em>158 F.3d 647, 652-53 (2d Cir.1998) (applying six-year limitation in \u00a7 2401 to actions under the Administrative Procedure Act, 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 701 <em>et seq.). </em>Fogel argues that his lawsuit is timely because the six-year period should have run from the 1999 denial of his individual application for veteran status and military burial, but that was essentially a denial of Fogel\u2019s request for reconsideration of the 1982 decision. If the statutory limitation period were to start anew each time a request for reconsideration was denied, the purpose of the limitation would be defeated.</p>\n<p id=\"b498-10\">Accordingly, the district court properly dismissed Fogel\u2019s complaint as time-barred. That court, in the interest of \u201ccompleting] the record,\u201d 169 F.Supp.2d at 150, proceeded to pass on the merits of Fogel\u2019s complaint. As to that portion of the district court\u2019s opinion, we express no view.</p>\n<p id=\"b498-11\">For the reasons set forth above, the judgment of the district court is hereby AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
