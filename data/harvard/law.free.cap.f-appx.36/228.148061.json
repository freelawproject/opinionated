Gonzalez-Renteria moved for a downward departure based on his agreement to waive a hearing and to consent to administrative deportation. The district court<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> denied the motion and sentenced him to 46 months imprisonment and 3 years supervised release.</p>\n<p id=\"b258-17\">On appeal Gonzalez-Renteria\u2019s counsel has moved to withdraw and filed a brief under <em>Anders v. California, </em>386 U.S. 738, 87 S.Ct. 1396, 18 L.Ed.2d 493 (1967), arguing that the district court erred in denying the downward-departure motion. We may not review a district court\u2019s denial of a downward-departure motion where \u2014 as here \u2014 there is no evidence that the court did not understand its authority to depart, or that the court was motivated by an unconstitutional reason. <em>See United States v. Hemandez-Reyes, </em>114 F.3d 800, 801-02 (8th Cir.1997).</p>\n<p id=\"b258-21\">Having found no nonfrivolous issues in our independent review of the record, <em>see Penson v. Ohio, </em>488 U.S. 75, 80, 109 S.Ct. 346, 102 L.Ed.2d 300 (1988), we grant counsel\u2019s motion to withdraw, and we affirm.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b258-18\">.
