He now appeals his sentence. Appellant claims that the district court erred when it used the quantity of drugs found in the SE Division Street apartment to determine his base offense level. We have jurisdiction to hear this appeal pursuant to 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3742(a) and 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291, and we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b303-8\">A determination of the quantity of drugs involved in a criminal offense is a factual finding.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The district court\u2019s factual findings must be supported by a preponderance of the evidence.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> We review those factual findings for clear error.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> We will overturn a district court\u2019s findings only if we have a firm and definite conviction that the court made a mistake.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b303-9\">The district court did not clearly err when it determined that Appellant was responsible for the cocaine found in the Division Street apartment. Although the district court relied on the statements of Garcia Lopez to make its finding, other evidence corroborated those statements and provided additional support for the court\u2019s finding. Garcia Lopez told the agents that Appellant helped pay the rent on the Division Street apartment, had keys to the apartment, and came and went as he pleased. Garcia Lopez also stated that Appellant and his brother brought the air compressor to the apartment. These hearsay statements alone might not be enough to find by a preponderance of the evidence that Appellant possessed the drugs found in the apartment.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> However, other evidence provided the necessary corroboration for the district court to consider Garcia Lopez\u2019s statements.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b303-16\">Additional evidence that tied Appellant to the Division Street apartment came from Appellant himself, his brother, and their friend Jose Soberanes. Appellant was with his brother, Javier, when the two were arrested at the storage locker. Agents found $2,500.00 and a set of electronic scales on Appellant at the storage locker. The agents had previously observed Javier\u2019s car at the Division Street apartment, and Javier had keys to the dead bolt and doorknob locks of the apartment on him when he was arrested. Both Javier and Appellant consented in writing to the search of the apartment after their arrest.</p>\n<p id=\"b304-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"278\">*278</page-number>At the apartment, the agents discovered cocaine in a vehicle air conditioning compressor, just like in the storage unit. The compressor had been lined with the same type of paper towels in the same manner as the compressor in the storage unit. Finally, while agents were still at the apartment, Soberanes arrived and told the agents that Appellant and his brother had called him after they had been arrested. He also told the agents that Appellant and his brother paid the rent on the apartment. All of this evidence substantially corroborates Garcia Lopez\u2019s statements and provides additional support for the district court\u2019s conclusion that Appellant was responsible for the cocaine found at the Division Street apartment. We therefore affirm the district court.</p>\n<p id=\"b304-4\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b303-11\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and may not be cited to or by the courts of this circuit except as may be provided by Ninth Circuit Rule 36-3.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b303-12\">. <em>United States v.
