At the outset, we must determine whether Myers timely filed his notice of appeal. In criminal cases, the defendant must file his notice of appeal within ten days of the entry of judgment. Fed. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"80\">*80</page-number>R.App. P. 4(b)(1)(A); <em>United States v. Alvarez, </em>210 F.3d 309, 310 (5th Cir.2000). With or without a motion, the district court may grant an extension of time to file of up to thirty days upon a showing of excusable neglect or good cause. Fed. R.App. P. 4(b)(4); <em>United States v. Reyes, </em>759 F.2d 351, 353 (4th Cir.1985). Where excusable neglect is apparent from the face of record, we need not remand the case to the district court for such determination. <em>Reyes, </em>759 F.2d at 354.</p>\n<p id=\"b110-4\">The district court entered its order on the criminal docket on February 7, 2002, <em>see </em>Fed. R.App. P. 4(b)(6); the ten-day appeal period expired on February 18, 2002.<footnotemark>*</footnotemark> Myers dated the notice of appeal February 20, and it was received in this court on March 4, 2002. <em>See </em>Fed. R.App. P. 4(d). Myers\u2019 notice of appeal was, therefore, filed beyond the ten-day appeal period but within the excusable neglect period. We find that excusable neglect appears on the face of the record. <em>Reyes, </em>759 F.2d at 354; <em>see Pioneer Inv. Servs. Co. v. Brunswick Assocs. Ltd. P\u2019ship, </em>507 U.S. 380, 388, 113 S.Ct. 1489, 123 L.Ed.2d 74 (1993) (discussing factors in determining whether excusable neglect exists); <em>United States v. Clark, </em>51 F.3d 42, 44 (5th Cir.1995) (holding that <em>\u201cPioneer </em>controls determinations of excusable neglect under Rule 4(b)\u201d). Thus, we have jurisdiction over Myers\u2019 appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b110-5\">Turning to the merits of Myers\u2019 claims, we have reviewed the record and the district court\u2019s order and find no reversible error. Accordingly, we affirm on the reasoning of the district court. <em>United States v. Myers, </em>No. CR-95-152 (D.S.C. Feb. 7, 2002). We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b110-7\">\n<em>AFFIRMED.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b110-19\">The ten-day period expired on Sunday, February 17, 2002. Thus, Myers had until Monday, February 18, to timely file his notice of appeal. Fed. R.App. P. 26(a)(3).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
