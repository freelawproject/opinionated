Oxen-dine challenges the district court\u2019s findings supporting a two-level enhancement of her offense level for obstruction of justice pursuant to <em>U.S. Sentencing Guidelines Manual </em>\u00a7 3C1.1 (2000), based on her perjury at trial. For the following reasons, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b535-20\">At trial, Oxendine testified that on or about February 8, 1998, her aunt contacted Oxendine\u2019s family in North Carolina and asked them to drive to Baltimore, Maryland due to an \u201cemergency.\u201d Oxen-dine further testified that upon arriving in Baltimore, her aunt instructed her to bail out \u201cJerry Oxendine,\u201d an individual Oxen-dine testified she did not know, who later turned out to be Gerald Moore, Oxendine\u2019s fugitive brother. The Government\u2019s witnesses, however, testified Oxendine and her family knew Moore was in Baltimore and that he had been arrested on February 6, 1998 for unrelated state charges under an alias. Based on this discrepancy and Oxendine\u2019s incredible version of events, the district court found Oxendine committed perjury in testifying in her own defense at trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b535-21\">At Oxendine\u2019s sentencing hearing, the district court imposed a two-level enhancement for obstruction of justice pursuant to \u00a7 3C1.1 because Oxendine deliberately offered false testimony in her defense. Oxen-dine challenges the application of this enhancement, alleging the court failed to make necessary findings in applying the enhancement and that there was insufficient evidence to support it.</p>\n<p id=\"b535-22\">Oxendine\u2019s assignments of error are meritless. The district court adopted the factual findings of Oxendine\u2019s presentence report as its own, which satisfies the requirements of <em>United States v. Dunnigan, </em>507 U.S. 87, 94-95, 113 S.Ct. 1111, 122 L.Ed.2d 445 (1993) (obliging sentencing courts to make specific findings of perjury before in applying \u00a7 3C1.1 enhancements <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"512\">*512</page-number>based on a defendant\u2019s testimony at trial). <em>See United States v. Haas, </em>171 F.3d 259, 268 (5th Cir.1999). Furthermore, the findings of Oxendine\u2019s presentence report, combined with the Government\u2019s uncontested proffer at sentencing and the district court\u2019s statements during trial, provide a sufficient evidentiary basis for the \u00a7 3C1.1 enhancement. Therefore, we find Oxendine\u2019s objections to the enhancement of her offense level for obstruction of justice under \u00a7 3C1.1 based on her perjury at trial are without merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b536-4\">Accordingly, we affirm Oxendine\u2019s sentence and dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b536-5\">\n<em>AFFIRMED.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
