He challenged his sentence on appeal, and we ordered a remand for re-sentencing in an unpublished order issued on March 27, 2001. Following the remand, the district court conducted a new sentencing proceeding and this time imposed a sentence of 405 months. Palmer filed a timely notice of appeal, but his attorney has now moved to withdraw under <em>Anders v. California, </em>386 U.S. 738, 87 S.Ct. 1396, 18 L.Ed.2d 493 (1967), because he cannot discern a nonfrivolous issue for appeal. Pursuant to Circuit Rule 51(b), Palmer was given the opportunity to respond to counsel\u2019s motion, which included a 30-day extension to May 28, 2002. His response came in on June 3, and although it is a tad late, we have considered it.</p>\n<p id=\"b247-19\">Counsel\u2019s <em>Anders </em>brief is adequate \u2014 in fact, it\u2019s more than just adequate, it\u2019s very good \u2014 so we limit our review of the record to the potential issues counsel has identified. <em>United States v. Tabb, </em>125 F.3d 583 (7th Cir.1997). Having reviewed counsel\u2019s brief, Mr. Palmer\u2019s response, and the record in this case, we conclude that no non-frivolous argument could be advanced to support the proposition that the district court committed any error in imposing Mr. Palmer\u2019s sentence upon remand. The term imposed did not exceed the top of the appropriately established guideline range, and his sentence did not result from any incorrect application of the guidelines. Accordingly, we GRANT counsel\u2019s motion to withdraw and DISMISS Mr. Palmer\u2019s appeal.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
