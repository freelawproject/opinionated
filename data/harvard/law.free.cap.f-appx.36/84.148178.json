We have reviewed the record and the district court\u2019s opinion accepting the magistrate judge\u2019s recommendation and find no reversible error as to the dismissal of Townsend\u2019s civil rights claims brought pursuant to \u00a7 1983. Although we express no opinion as to the merit of Townsend\u2019s claims, to the extent he sought to allege non-civil rights claims under the auspice of diversity jurisdiction, we modify the district court\u2019s order to reflect a dismissal without prejudice as to those claims. Accordingly, we grant Townsend\u2019s motion for leave to proceed in forma pau-peris and affirm as modified. <em>Townsend v. Lockhart, </em>No. CA-01-691-1 (M.D.N.C. Oct. 26, 2001). We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b114-19\">\n<em>AFFIRMED AS MODIFIED.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
