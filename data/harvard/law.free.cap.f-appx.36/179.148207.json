Wershing advocated union representation and filed for a representation election. He was subsequently laid off. Wershing then sued, claiming that Hinck-ley Township retaliated against him for his union advocacy and violated his rights under the First Amendment and other federal and state laws. Defendants moved for summary judgment on the basis of qualified immunity, which the district court denied.</p>\n<p id=\"b210-6\">Defendants now raise five issues. First, whether Wershing\u2019s union activity was constitutionally protected as relating to a matter of public concern. Second, whether Wershing has established that the constitutional right allegedly violated was a clearly established right of which a reasonable official in the individual Defendants\u2019 position would have known. Third, whether Wershing has shown that the conduct of the individual Defendants was objectively unreasonable in light of the purported clearly established right. Fourth, whether summary judgment should be granted in favor of Defendants on Wershing\u2019s wrongful discharge as against public policy because Wershing\u2019s First Amendment claim fails. Fifth, whether the district court had subject matter jurisdiction over Wersh-ing\u2019s public policy wrongful discharge claim premised on Ohio Rev.Code \u00a7 4117.</p>\n<p id=\"b210-7\">After reviewing the briefs and the record in this case and after hearing oral argument, we are persuaded that the district court properly denied Defendants\u2019 motion for summary judgment for the reasons stated in its opinion of March 19, 2001. Accordingly, we adopt the opinion of the district court and AFFIRM the district court\u2019s denial of Defendants\u2019 motion for summary judgment on the basis of qualified immunity.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
