R.App. P. 34(a)(2); 10th Cir. R. 34.1(G). The case is therefore ordered submitted without oral argument.</p>\n<p id=\"b409-22\">This is a pro se \u00a7 2255 prisoner appeal. Mr. Bahe pled guilty to drug charges and was sentenced to 24 months imprisonment to be served consecutive to a Utah state court sentence. Mr. Bahe\u2019s \u00a7 2255 motion claimed that his sentence should have been concurrent with, rather than consecutive to, his state sentence. Finding no merit in any of Mr. Bahe\u2019s arguments, the district court denied the \u00a7 2255 motion on the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"386\">*386</page-number>merits. Appellant then applied to this court for a certificate of appealability.</p>\n<p id=\"b410-4\">In order for this court to grant a certificate of appealability, Appellant must make \u201ca substantial showing of the denial of a constitutional right.\u201d 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2253(c)(2). To do so, Appellant must demonstrate that \u201creasonable jurists could debate whether (or, for that matter, agree that) the petition should have been resolved in a different manner or that the issues presented were adequate to deserve encouragement to proceed further.\u201d <em>Slack v. McDaniel, </em>529 U.S. 473, 484, 120 S.Ct. 1595, 146 L.Ed.2d 542 (2000) (quotations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b410-5\">Mr. Bahe argues that the district judge believed that Mr. Bahe would only serve one year in state prison and that is why the judge ordered a consecutive sentence. So far, Mr. Bahe has served six years in state prison. However, there is nothing in the record to indicate that the district judge based his decision on a one-year sentence in state prison. We have carefully reviewed Mr. Bahe\u2019s and the Government\u2019s briefs, the district court\u2019s disposition, and the record on appeal. Nothing in the facts, the record on appeal, or the briefs raises an issue which meets our standards for the grant of a certificate of appealability. We find no merit in Mr. Bahe\u2019s contention. We cannot say that \u201creasonable jurists could debate whether (or, for that matter, agree that) the petition should have been resolved in a different manner.\u201d <em>Id. </em>We DENY Appellant\u2019s request for a certificate of appealability and DISMISS the appeal.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b409-24\"> This order and judgment is not binding precedent, except under the doctrines of law of the case, res judicata, and collateral estoppel. The court generally disfavors the citation of orders and judgments; nevertheless, an order and judgment may be cited under the terms and conditions of 10th Cir. R. 36.3.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
