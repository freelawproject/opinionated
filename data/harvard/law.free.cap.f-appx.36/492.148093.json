At sentencing, the District Court applied a four-level enhancement because Andeliz was in the business of receiving and selling stolen property. This enhancement resulted in an adjusted offense level of 16 which, combined with a criminal history category of I, gave him a Sentencing Guideline Range of 18-24 months. The District Court imposed an 18-month sentence for each count, to be served concurrently. Andeliz appeals raising the issues shown under Section I below, which have been taken verbatim from his brief. We will affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b517-7\">I. ISSUES</p>\n<p id=\"b517-8\">1. Under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2B1.1(b)(4)(B), whether the District Court abused its discretion and erred as a matter of law in sentencing the defendant to eighteen months incarceration when the Court ruled that the defendant would be sentenced as \u201cbeing in the business of selling stolen goods.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b517-9\">2. Under <em>Apprendi, </em>whether the sentencing factor outlined in U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2B1.2 was an element of the crime, subject to determination beyond reasonable doubt by the jury when the defendant received a sentence in excess of the statutory maximum penalty.</p>\n<p id=\"b517-10\">3. Under Fed.R.Evid. 404B, whether the evidence of past wrongdoings was not related to the material issue, was not proved by clear and convincing evidence, and its prejudicial value outweighed its probative value.</p>\n<p id=\"b517-13\">II. DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b517-14\">The history of this case is well known to counsel, the parties, and the Court. Inasmuch as we are writing a non-precedential opinion and only for the parties herein, we see no need to recapitulate either the extensive facts upon which Andeliz was convicted, or the procedure that preceded the conviction and sentencing therein.</p>\n<p id=\"b517-15\">With respect to the first issue raised by the appellant, we conclude that the District Court properly applied the enhancement in U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2B1.1(b)(4)(B). It is clear from the record that Andeliz was engaged in the business of receiving and selling stolen property. Andeliz was caught with a substantial amount of stolen goods. His fencing operation was also conducted with sufficient regularity to support a finding that he was in the business of receiving stolen property.</p>\n<p id=\"b517-16\">We likewise conclude that the District Court properly rejected Andeliz\u2019s claim raised at sentencing, that, under <em>Apprendi v. New Jersey, </em>530 U.S. 466, 120 S.Ct. 2348, 147 L.Ed.2d 435 (2000), it was necessary that the jury, not the sentencing court, have found the facts that established the loss amount, and that Andeliz was in the business of receiving stolen property. Andeliz\u2019s 18 month sentence was well below the ten year statutory maximum sentence for either of the offenses of convic<em>tion </em>\u2014 Apprendi simply does not apply.</p>\n<p id=\"b517-17\">Finally, there is likewise no merit in appellant\u2019s third issue, and we conclude that the District Court properly exercised its discretion by admitting evidence, pursuant to Fed.R.Evid. 404(b), of Andeliz\u2019s uncharged possession of $24,000 worth of stolen Walmart merchandise. This evidence was used to prove an element of the charged crimes that Andeliz knew <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"494\">*494</page-number>that the Sam\u2019s Club merchandise in his possession had been stolen. As the District Court instructed the jury, the evidence was admitted to prove Andeliz\u2019s guilty knowledge, and not to show his criminal propensity. Where, as here, the appellant vigorously disputes the government\u2019s allegation that he knew that the goods he received were stolen, the District Court has the discretion to admit evidence of other instances in which the defendant possessed stolen property to prove that knowledge. That evidence was properly admitted here.</p>\n<p id=\"b518-4\">III. CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b518-5\">In sum, and for the foregoing reasons, we will affirm the judgment of the District Court entered on July 10, 2001.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
