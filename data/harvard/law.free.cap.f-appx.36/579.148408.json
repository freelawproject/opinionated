We have jurisdiction pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291 and we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b603-20\">Rubio-Soria contends that the district court erroneously denied his motion to dismiss the indictment based on his claim that \u00a7 960 is unconstitutional after <em>Ap-prendi v. New Jersey, </em>530 U.S. 466, 120 S.Ct. 2348, 147 L.Ed.2d 435 (2000). Ru-bio-Soria further contends that even if \u00a7 960 is constitutional, his conviction must be reversed because the government failed to prove beyond a reasonable doubt that he knowingly or intentionally imported a specific quantity of marijuana.</p>\n<p id=\"b603-21\">We reject Rubio-Soria\u2019s facial constitutional challenge to \u00a7 960 because it is foreclosed by our decision in <em>United States v. Mendoza-Paz, </em>286 F.3d 1104, 1109-10 (9th Cir.2002) (upholding the constitutionality of 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 960 after Apprendi). Rubio-Soria\u2019s contention that the government was required to prove his knowledge of drug quantity also fails pursuant to <em>United States v. Carranza, </em>289 F.3d 634, 644 (9th Cir.2002) (concluding that <em>Apprendi </em>did not change the rule that the government need not prove defendant\u2019s knowledge of type and amount of controlled substance).</p>\n<p id=\"b603-22\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b603-24\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and may not be cited to or by the courts of this circuit except as may be provided by 9th Cir.
