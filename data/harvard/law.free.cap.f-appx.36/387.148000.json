NELSON and Attorney General of Kansas, Respondents-Appellees.</parties>\n<docketnumber data-order=\"1\" data-type=\"docketnumber\" id=\"b411-16\">No. 02-3021.</docketnumber>\n<court data-order=\"2\" data-type=\"court\" id=\"b411-17\">United States Court of Appeals, Tenth Circuit.</court>\n<decisiondate data-order=\"3\" data-type=\"decisiondate\" id=\"b411-18\">May 31, 2002.</decisiondate>\n<p data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"judges\" id=\"b411-19\">Before KELLY, McKAY, and MURPHY, Circuit Judges.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<p id=\"b411-20\">ORDER AND JUDGMENT <footnotemark>*</footnotemark></p>\n<author id=\"b411-21\">McKAY, Circuit Judge.</author>\n<p id=\"b411-22\">After examining the briefs and the appellate record, this panel has determined <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"388\">*388</page-number>unanimously that oral argument would not materially assist the determination of this appeal. <em>See </em>Fed. R.App. P. 34(a)(2); 10th Cir. R. 34.1(G). The case is therefore ordered submitted without oral argument.</p>\n<p id=\"b412-4\">This is a pro se \u00a7 2254 prisoner appeal. Mr. Timley was convicted of three counts of rape and four counts of aggravated criminal sodomy. His convictions were affirmed on direct appeal. Mr. Timley\u2019s three state post-conviction actions and appeals were unsuccessful.</p>\n<p id=\"b412-5\">In his \u00a7 2254 petition, Mr. Timley raised ten claims of error. The magistrate judge recommended that the petition be denied as untimely under AEDPA. After consideration of Mr. Timley\u2019s objections, the district court adopted the recommendation, finding no grounds for equitable tolling, and denied the petition. Finding no merit in any of Mr. Timley\u2019s arguments, the district court declined to grant him a certificate of appealability. Petitioner then applied to this court for a certificate of appealability.</p>\n<p id=\"b412-6\">In order for this court to grant a certificate of appealability, Petitioner must make a \u201csubstantial showing of the denial of a constitutional right.\u201d 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2253(c)(2). To do so, Petitioner must demonstrate that \u201creasonable jurists could debate whether (or, for that matter, agree that) the petition should have been resolved in a different manner or that the issues presented were adequate to deserve encouragement to proceed further.\u201d <em>Slack v. McDaniel, </em>529 U.S. 473, 484, 120 S.Ct. 1595, 146 L.Ed.2d 542 (2000) (quotations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b412-7\">We have carefully reviewed Mr. Tim-ley\u2019s brief, the district court\u2019s disposition, and the record on appeal. Nothing in the facts, the record on appeal, or Appellant\u2019s brief raises an issue which meets our standards for the grant of a certificate of ap-pealability. For substantially the same reasons as set forth by the district court in its Order of December 20, 2001, adopting the magistrate judge\u2019s report and recommendation, we cannot say that \u201creasonable jurists could debate whether (or, for that matter, agree that) the petition should have been resolved in a different manner.\u201d <em>Id. </em>We DENY Petitioner\u2019s request for a certificate of appealability and DISMISS the appeal.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b411-9\"> This order and judgment is not binding precedent, except under the doctrines of law of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"388\">*388</page-number>case, res judicata, and collateral estoppel. The court generally disfavors the citation of orders and judgments; nevertheless, an order and judgment may be cited under the terms and conditions of 10th Cir. R. 36.3.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
