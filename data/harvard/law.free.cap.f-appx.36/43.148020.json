For the reasons that follow, we will affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b73-22\">Inasmuch as we write only for the parties and the district court, we need not reiterate the factual background of this appeal. Plaintiff concedes that its equal protection claim is subject to a \u201crational basis\u201d analysis as no fundamental right is involved, and plaintiff is not afforded the protections that result from suspect classification such as race. We have reviewed the thoughtful Memorandum and Order of the district court filed on January 23, 2001, as well as the subsequent order filed October 15, 2001 in which the district court clarified its memorandum and order. We will affirm substantially for the reasons set forth by the district court in its Memorandum Opinion and subsequent clarification.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
