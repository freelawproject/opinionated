Reynolds appeals, and we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b600-4\">After a hearing on Reynolds\u2019s application for benefits, an administrative law judge (ALJ) determined that Reynolds had \u201csome degenerative changes of the lumbar spine\u201d and was \u201cmoderately depressed.\u201d He found that Reynolds is \u201crestricted to the performance of light work activity,\u201d with \u201cthe capacity to frequently lift ten pounds and occasionally lift up to twenty pounds.\u201d He also found that, due to pain in her lower back, Reynolds needs to alternate positions between sitting and standing approximately every half hour. Although the ALJ found Reynolds was unable to perform her past relevant work as a home care aide, line worker, and security guard, the ALJ found, based upon a vocational expert\u2019s testimony, that a person with Reynolds\u2019s restrictions could work in certain other line-worker jobs, and as an inspector, packer, cashier, and gatekeeper. Relying on the vocational expert\u2019s testimony, the ALJ denied Reynolds\u2019s claim. His decision was affirmed by the Commissioner through an administrative appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b600-5\">Reynolds challenged the Commissioner\u2019s decision in the district court, and the district court ruled in favor of the Commissioner. On appeal from that decision, Reynolds claims (1) the ALJ\u2019s hypothetical was \u201cvague and ill-defined\u201d; (2) the ALJ failed to articulate the facts that supported his conclusions; and (3) the vocational expert\u2019s testimony \u201cwas in unexplained conflict with the <em>Dictionary of Occupational Titles </em>(DOT).\u201d <em>See </em>20 C.F.R. \u00a7 404.1566(d)(1).</p>\n<p id=\"b600-8\">We must affirm the Commissioner\u2019s decision if it is supported by substantial evidence on the record as a whole. <em>See Roberts v. Apfel, </em>222 F.3d 466, 467 (8th Cir. 2000). Substantial evidence is less than a preponderance, but enough that a reasonable mind would find it adequate to support the Commissioner\u2019s decision. <em>See id. </em>Having reviewed the record and the ALJ\u2019s written opinion, we find substantial evidence to support the Commissioner\u2019s decision to deny benefits.</p>\n<p id=\"b600-10\">Contrary to Reynolds\u2019s argument, the ALJ adequately described Reynolds\u2019s limitations in the hypothetical he addressed to the vocational expert. The ALJ found that Reynolds has the ability to perform a full range of light work, with a few limitations. After he explained these limitations to the vocational expert, the ALJ did not need to embark on a detailed discussion of the abilities Reynolds retained. In addition, based on our review of the ALJ\u2019s written opinion, we find he adequately set forth the evidentiary basis for his conclusions.</p>\n<p id=\"b600-11\">Finally, we see no conflict between the vocational expert\u2019s testimony and the DOT. It is true the Commissioner cannot rely on expert testimony that conflicts with the job classifications in the DOT unless there is evidence in the record to rebut those classifications. <em>See Porch v. Chater, </em>115 F.3d 567, 572 (8th Cir.1997). In this case, the vocational expert provided additional information about certain jobs listed in the DOT, namely, whether those jobs allowed workers to alternate between sitting and standing. The vocational expert\u2019s testimony did not contradict any information in the DOT; rather, it served as a supplement to that information. The ALJ was entitled to accept the expert\u2019s testimony and to base his decision upon it.</p>\n<p id=\"b600-12\">Because there is substantial evidence in the record to support the ALJ\u2019s decision, we affirm the judgment of the district court. <em>See </em>8th Cir. R. 47B.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b599-6\">. The Honorable Thomas C.
