We have reviewed the record and the district court\u2019s opinion and find no reversible error. Although a labor organization may be subject to suit under Title VII of the Civil Rights Act, 42 U.S.C.A. \u00a7\u00a7 2000e to 2000e-17 (West 1994 &amp; Supp.2001), Smith has not stated a viable claim against the Defendants. The record provides no basis from which we can conclude that the Defendants knew Smith\u2019s employer was discriminating against her and failed to take action based on such knowledge. <em>See generally Goodman v. Lukens Steel Co., </em>482 U.S. 656, 665-69, 107 S.Ct. 2617, 96 L.Ed.2d 572 (1987). Rather, Smith\u2019s claims assert unfair treatment by her former employer, the Board of Education of Carroll County, which is not a party to this action. Her conclusory allegation that the Defendants breached their duty of fair representation fails to state a claim upon which relief may be granted. Accordingly, we affirm the district court\u2019s judgment. <em>Smith v. Carroll County Educ. Ass\u2019n, Inc., </em>No. CA-01-1425-JFM (D.Md. Nov. 8, 2001). We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b179-23\">\n<em>AFFIRMED.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
