We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b890-26\">In 1999, the Immigration Judge (IJ) found Mr. Bini removable (1) for overstaying the brief period of permission to be in the United States he had received in 1984, in violation of the Immigration and Naturalization Act (INA) \u00a7 237(a)(1)(B), 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1227(a)(1)(B); and (2) for having committed \u201ctwo crimes involving moral turpitude not arising out of a single scheme of criminal misconduct,\u201d in violation of INA \u00a7 237(a)(2)(A)(ii), 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1227(a) (2) (A) (ii). The IJ denied Mr. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"869\">*869</page-number>Bird\u2019s withholding-of-removal application and denied voluntary departure. The Board of Immigration Appeals (BIA) affirmed the IJ\u2019s decision and dismissed the appeal in February 2000.</p>\n<p id=\"b891-5\">Mr. Bini did not directly appeal to this court following the BIA\u2019s adverse ruling. Instead, two months later he filed in the district court a complicated habeas petition and supporting brief, stating he clearly established a probability of torture and persecution if returned to Nigeria and \u201chas\u201d requested reopening of his proceedings to apply for Convention relief. The district court denied Mr. Bird\u2019s petition but granted his request for a stay pending appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b891-6\">On appeal, in addition to attacking the BIA decision, Mr. Bini appears to argue that the district court erred in upholding his continuing detention under 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1231(a)(6), that the court erred in its determination that he was ineligible for relief under INA \u00a7 212(c), 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1182(c) (repealed in 1996), and that this court should \u201cgrant the motion [to reopen].\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b891-7\">We conclude the district court correctly determined it lacked jurisdiction to entertain Mr. Bini\u2019s challenges to the BIA\u2019s decision in a habeas proceeding: Such challenges must be raised in a petition for review of the BIA\u2019s decision. <em>See </em>8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(b)(1), (2), (9) (petition for review, filed within 30 days of final removal order, shall be filed with appeals court; judicial review of all questions of law and fact, including interpretation and application of constitutional and statutory provisions, arising from action taken or proceeding brought to remove alien \u201cshall be available only in judicial review of a final order under this section\u201d); <em>Foti v. INS, </em>375 U.S. 217, 224, 84 S.Ct. 306, 11 L.Ed.2d 281 (1963) (Congress\u2019s \u201cfundamental purpose\u201d behind review provision vesting exclusive review in appellate courts was to abbreviate judicial-review process in order to frustrate practices whereby persons subject to deportation were forestalling departure by dilatory tactics in courts).</p>\n<p id=\"b891-9\">The district court, which did have jurisdiction over Mr. Bini\u2019s challenge to his continuing detention, <em>see </em>28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2241(c)(3) (granting courts authority to determine whether detention is in violation of laws of United States), correctly upheld the detention because when the habeas petition was filed, the Immigration and Naturalization Service (INS) had not detained him beyond the initial ninety-day removal period prescribed by 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1231(a)(1)(A), and the INS has discretion to extend Mr. Bini\u2019s detention because he is removable for moral-turpitude crimes, <em>see 8 </em>U.S.C. \u00a7 1231(a)(6) (alien who is removable under \u00a7 1227(a)(2) or who Attorney General determines to be risk to community or unlikely to comply with removal order may be detained beyond removal period). Further, the removal period has been extended by Mr. Bini\u2019s obtaining a stay. <em>See 8 </em>U.S.C. \u00a7 1231(a)(1)(C) (removal period shall be extended beyond period of 90 days and alien may remain in detention during such extended period if alien acts to prevent removal).</p>\n<p id=\"b891-10\">Additionally, the district court properly rejected Mr. Bini\u2019s argument concerning section 1182(c) relief, because that section had been repealed, pertained to lawfully admitted permanent-resident aliens \u2014 not to overstays, and afforded no basis for habeas relief. Finally, Mr. Bini\u2019s request for us to \u201cgrant the motion [to reopen]\u201d is misplaced. <em>See 8 </em>C.F.R. \u00a7 3.2(g)(2)(i) (2001) (motion to reopen \u201cshall be filed directly with the Board\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b892-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"870\">*870</page-number>Accordingly, we affirm the district court\u2019s decision.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b890-17\">.
