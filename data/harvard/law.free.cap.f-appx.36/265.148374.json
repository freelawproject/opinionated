Magill, Senior United States Circuit Judge for the United States Court of Appeals, Eighth Circuit, sitting by designation.</p>\n</footnote>\n<opinion data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-3\" type=\"majority\">\n<p id=\"b291-18\">MEMORANDUM <footnotemark>***</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b291-19\">Nineteen-year-old Cesar Marinez-Arel-lano and his fifteen-year-old cousin, Josu\u00e9 Arellano-Gutierrez, imported about forty kilograms of marijuana into the United States. Marinez-Arellano stated that he agreed with a man named Kiret to smuggle the marijuana in return for $500 and that he was going to give $250 to Arellano-Gutierrez, who, according to Marinez-Ar-ellano, came along because he \u201calso wanted to make some money.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b291-24\">Marinez-Arellano pleaded guilty to importing marijuana in violation of 21 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 952 and 960. The district court sentenced Marinez-Arellano to twelve months and one day imprisonment and three years supervised release. In doing so, the district court found that Marinez-Arellano \u201crecruited\u201d his cousin for the smuggling trip and therefore increased Marinez-Arel-lano\u2019s base offense level by two under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3B1.4. for \u201cuse of a minor.\u201d Marinez-Arellano appeals, but we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b291-25\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b291-26\">Marinez-Arellano first argues that 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 960 is unconstitutional under <em>Ap-prendi v. New Jersey, </em>530 U.S. 466, 120 S.Ct. 2348, 147 L.Ed.2d 435 (2000). This Circuit has rejected this argument. <em>United States v. Mendoza-Paz, </em>286 F.3d 1104, 1109 (9th Cir.2002).</p>\n<p id=\"b291-27\">Based on <em>Apprendi </em>Marinez-Arellano next argues that this Court must interpret \u00a7 960 to impose a requirement that the defendant know the type and amount of the controlled substance at issue. <em>Appren-di </em>does not apply to this case. <em>Apprendi </em>holds that \u201c[ojther than the fact of a prior conviction, any fact that increases the penalty for a crime beyond the prescribed statutory maximum must be submitted to a jury, and proved beyond a reasonable doubt.\u201d <em>Apprendi </em>530 U.S. at 490. The <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"266\">*266</page-number>maximum sentence for importing fewer than fifty kilograms of marijuana is five years. 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 960(b)(4). The district court never exposed Marinez-Arellano to a term of imprisonment greater than five years, and thus <em>Apprendi </em>is inapplicable. In any event, Marinez-Arellano was sentenced to twelve months and one day imprisonment and three years of supervised release. This is well below the permissible statutory maximum and thus any potential <em>Apprendi </em>error would be harmless.</p>\n<p id=\"b292-4\">Finally, Marinez-Arellano contends that the district court erred by enhancing his sentence for \u201cuse of a minor\u201d under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3B1.4. Section 3B1.4, entitled \u201cUsing a Minor To Commit a Crime,\u201d provides: \u201cIf the defendant used or attempted to use a person less than eighteen years of age to commit the offense or assist in avoiding detection of, or apprehension for, the offense, increase by 2 levels.\u201d U.S. Sentencing Guidelines Manual \u00a7 3B1.4 (2001). The commentary to \u00a7 3B1.4 states that \u201c \u2018[ujsed or attempted to use\u2019 includes directing, commanding, encouraging, intimidating, counseling, training, procuring, recruiting, or soliciting.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at cmt. n. 1. This court reviews the district court\u2019s interpretation of the Sentencing Guidelines de novo, its factual findings for clear error, and its application of the Guidelines to the facts for abuse of discretion. <em>United States v. Seesing, </em>234 F.3d 456, 459 (9th Cir.2000).</p>\n<p id=\"b292-5\">This Court recently analyzed \u00a7 3B1.4 in <em>United States v. Parker, </em>241 F.3d 1114 (9th Cir.2001). The <em>Parker </em>Court reversed the district court\u2019s application of a two-level sentence enhancement pursuant to \u00a7 3B1.4 for use of a minor to commit a bank robbery, holding that \u201ca defendant\u2019s participation in an armed bank robbery with a minor does not warrant a sentence enhancement under \u00a7 3B1.4 in the absence of evidence that the defendant acted affirmatively to involve the minor in the robbery, beyond merely acting as his partner.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1120.</p>\n<p id=\"b292-7\">Here, the district court applied \u00a7 3B1.4\u2019s two-level enhancement after concluding that Marinez-Arellano \u201crecruited\u201d Arellano-Gutierrez. Marinez-Arellano argues that \u00a7 3B1.4 requires that the defendant \u201cactively\u201d use a minor to commit a crime, so \u00a7 3B1.4 should not apply to this case because he and Arellano-Gutierrez <em>jointly </em>decided to import marijuana. However, the district court\u2019s finding that Marinez-Arellano \u201crecruited\u201d Arellano-Gutierrez is not clearly erroneous. Mari-nez-Arellano told the authorities that he initiated contact with Kiret and made the arrangements to smuggle the marijuana for $500. Only after Marinez-Arellano made his deal with Kiret did he involve his cousin. Therefore, under the test set forth in <em>Parker, </em>Marinez-Arellano \u201cacted affirmatively to involve the minor\u201d and was subject to the enhancement in \u00a7 3B1.4. 241 F.3d at 1120.</p>\n<p id=\"b292-8\">Alternatively, Marinez-Arellano argues that the rule of lenity should apply, thereby requiring reversal of the \u00a7 3B1.4 sentencing enhancement. The rule of lenity requires courts to resolve ambiguities in criminal statutes in the defendant\u2019s favor, but applies \u201conly if, after seizing everything from which aid can be derived, we can make no more than a guess as to what Congress intended.\u201d <em>Muscarello v. United States, </em>524 U.S. 125, 138, 118 S.Ct. 1911, 141 L.Ed.2d 111 (1998) (citations omitted). However, since \u00a7 3B1.4 unambiguously permitted the district court to enhance Marinez-Arellano\u2019s sentence, the rule of lenity does not apply.</p>\n<p id=\"b292-9\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b292-10\">We AFFIRM the district court.</p>\n<footnote label=\"***\">\n<p id=\"b291-29\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and may not be cited to or by the courts of this circuit except as may be provided by Ninth Circuit Rule 36-3.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
