Defendant concedes that the district court erred by not explaining its reasoning for both the direction and the degree of the departure. <em>See, e.g., United States v. Green, </em>105 F.3d 1321, 1322 (9th Cir.1997).</p>\n<p id=\"b289-5\">The parties disagree only about the appropriate scope of the remand. We conclude that a limitation on the remand is not appropriate but, instead, that we will simply vacate the sentence and remand the case to the district court for resentencing and for a specific explanation for the departure, if any, that the court deems is warranted. <em>See United States v. Matthews, </em>278 F.3d 880, 885-86 (9th Cir.2002) (en banc) (holding that, as a general matter, if a district court errs in sentencing, we remand for resentencing \"without a limiting instruction). We are not persuaded that the circumstances justify a limiting instruction here.</p>\n<p id=\"b289-6\">In resolving the issue presented to us by the parties, we identified another aspect of the sentence in which the district court erred as a matter of law. The judgment requires the defendant to pay restitution to the United States Attorney\u2019s office in the amount of $419,521.00 and to Kenichi Kimura, an individual, in the amount of $16,397.00, \u201cin such amounts and installments as directed by the Probation Officer.\u201d Under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3664(i), the court <em>must </em>direct that Kimura be paid first:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"And\">If the court finds that more than 1 victim has sustained a loss requiring restitution by a defendant, the court may provide for a different payment schedule for each victim based on the type and amount of each victim\u2019s loss and accounting for the economic circumstances of each victim. <em>In any case in which the United States is a victim, the court shall ensure that all other victims receive full restitution before the United States receives any restitution.</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b289-9\">(Emphasis added.) The judgment in this case failed to make that provision. When the district court on remand resentences Defendant in other respects, it shall include the foregoing requirement.</p>\n<p id=\"b289-10\">Sentence VACATED; REMANDED for resentencing.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b288-37\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and may not be cited to or by the courts of this circuit except as provided by Ninth Circuit Rule 36-3.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
