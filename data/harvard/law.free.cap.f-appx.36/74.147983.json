The district court sentenced him to 120 months in prison and three years of supervised release. The district court ordered the sentence to run concurrently with the twelve-month sentence Payne was serving for possession with intent to sell and deliver cocaine and possession of stolen goods, and consecutively to all other state sentences he was currently serving. Payne\u2019s attorney filed a brief in accordance with <em>Anders v. California, </em>386 U.S. 738, 87 S.Ct. 1396, 18 L.Ed.2d 493 (1967), raising the issue of whether Payne\u2019s sentence was unfairly harsh. Payne was informed of his right to file a pro se supplemental brief but has not done so.</p>\n<p id=\"b104-22\">In accordance with <em>Anders, </em>we have reviewed the entire record and have found no meritorious issues for appeal. We therefore affirm Payne\u2019s conviction and sentence. We deny counsel\u2019s motion to withdraw and require that counsel inform <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"75\">*75</page-number>Ms client, in writing, of Ms rigM to petition the Supreme Court of the Umted States for further review. If the client requests that a petition be filed, but counsel believes that such petition would be frivolous, then counsel may move in this court for leave to withdraw from representation. Counsel\u2019s motion must state that a copy thereof was served on the client. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented m the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b105-5\">\n<em>AFFIRMED.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
