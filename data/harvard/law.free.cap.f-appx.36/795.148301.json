On appeal, the respondent contends (1) that the district court failed to make appropriate findings under AEDPA, the Anti-terrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act of 1996, 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254(d), and (2) that the court improperly shifted the burden to the state to disprove Dedvukovie\u2019s ineffective assistance claim by crediting the \u201cself-serving\u201d testimony of the petitioner.</p>\n<p id=\"b818-14\">Having had the benefit of oral argument in this case, and having studied the briefs submitted by the parties and the record on appeal, we are not convinced that the district court erred in granting relief in this case. The district judge\u2019s analysis was sound and the remedy she fashioned was appropriate. We therefore affirm for the reasons stated in the court\u2019s opinion and order dated and filed September 27, 2000. We add only a few observations.</p>\n<p id=\"b818-15\">The relevant portions of 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254(d) are as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b818-16\">[A]n application for a writ of habeas corpus on behalf of a person in custody pursuant to the judgment of the state court shall not be granted with respect <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"797\">*797</page-number>to any claim that was adjudicated on the merits in State court proceedings unless the adjudication of the claim</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b819-5\">(1) resulted in a decision that was contrary to, or involved an unreasonable application of, clearly established Federal law, as determined by the Supreme Court of the United States.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b819-6\">(2) resulted in a decision that was based on an unreasonable determination of the facts in light of the evidence presented in the State court proceeding.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b819-7\">In <em>Williams v. Taylor, </em>529 U.S. 862, 120 S.Ct. 1495, 146 L.Ed.2d 389 (2000), the Supreme Court clarified the distinction between a decision that is \u201ccontrary to\u201d and one that constitutes an \u201cunreasonable application of\u2019 clearly established Supreme Court law under \u00a7 2254(d)(1). A state court decision is \u201ccontrary to\u201d clearly established Supreme Court precedent when it \u201capplies a rule that contradicts the governing law set forth in [Supreme Court] cases,\u201d or \u201cconfronts a set of facts that are materially indistinguishable from a decision of\u2019 the Supreme Court and nevertheless arrives at a different result. <em>Id. </em>at 405-06, 120 S.Ct. 1495 (O\u2019Conner, J\u201e concurring). In contrast, a state court decision is an \u201cunreasonable application of\u2019 clearly established federal law when \u201cthe state court identifies the correct governing legal principle from this Court\u2019s decisions but unreasonably applies that principle to the facts of the prisoner\u2019s case.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 413, 120 S.Ct. 1495. An \u201cunreasonable application of law\u201d under the statute must be both incorrect and unreasonable. <em>Id. </em>at 411, 120 S.Ct. 1495.</p>\n<p id=\"b819-8\">In this case, the district court articulated the correct standard and, we are convinced, correctly applied it. Although the court\u2019s conclusion is not set out in so many words, the district judge implicitly found that the Michigan Court of Appeals engaged in an unreasonable application of the Supreme Court\u2019s opinions in <em>Strickland v. Washington, </em>466 U.S. 668, 687, 104 S.Ct. 2052, 80 L.Ed.2d 674 (1984), and <em>Hill v. Lockhart, </em>474 U.S. 52, 58, 106 S.Ct. 366, 88 L.Ed.2d 203 (1985). We agree. The crux of the problem was not the Michigan court\u2019s identification of the appropriate standard \u2014 the court ostensibly applied <em>Strickland\u2019s </em>\u201creasonable probability\u201d test. However, in its opinion, the court did no more than rubber-stamp the trial court\u2019s ruling at the conclusion of the <em>Gin-ther </em>hearing, in which the judge simply concluded, without more, that there was no proof to indicate whether or not the petitioner would have accepted the state\u2019s offer to plead to reduced charges. Given the testimony of the petitioner, the indication in the court record of an offer at the pretrial conference, and the glaring deficiencies revealed by his counsel\u2019s testimony, this conclusion was obviously <em>not </em>supported by the record.</p>\n<p id=\"b819-10\">There can be little doubt about the significance of the legal assistance that the petitioner was apparently denied. As the Second Circuit has noted, \u201cThe decision whether to plead guilty or contest a criminal charge is ordinarily the most important single decision in a <em>criminal </em>ease ... [and] counsel may and must give the client the benefit of counsel\u2019s professional advice on this crucial decision.\u201d <em>Boria v. Keane, </em>99 F.3d 492, 496-97 (2d Cir.1996) <em>(quoting </em>Anthony G. Amsterdam, Trial Manual Five for the Defense of Criminal Cases (1988)). However, the defense attorney in this case had no indication in her file that she had properly advised her client of the prosecution\u2019s offer to allow him to plead to reduced charges, nor could she recall discussing the state\u2019s offer with Dedvukovic, although she did say that it was her usual practice to do so. Her client, on the other hand, swears that his attorney never explained to him the significance of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"798\">*798</page-number>state\u2019s offer or the difference in his sentence that a guilty plea might have made, despite his request that she research the question and give him information and advice regarding his options.</p>\n<p id=\"b820-4\">The state brands this testimony \u201cself-serving\u201d and insists that, without objective evidence to support it, the petitioner is not entitled to relief. However, the district court correctly identified the two-prong test applied to questions of this nature: whether the record reflects, first, that trial counsel\u2019s performance was deficient and, second, that but for the deficiency in performance, there is a reasonable probability that the petitioner would have accepted the prosecution\u2019s offer and pleaded guilty. <em>See Turner v. Tennessee, 858 </em>F.2d 1201, 1205 (6th Cir.1988), <em>vacated on other grounds, </em>492 U.S. 902, 109 S.Ct. 3208, 106 L.Ed.2d 559 (1989), <em>reinstated on other grounds, </em>940 F.2d 1000 (6th Cir.1991).</p>\n<p id=\"b820-5\">Although some circuits have held that a defendant must support his own assertion that he would have accepted the offer with additional objective evidence, <em>see, e.g., Paters v. United States, </em>159 F.3d 1043, 1047 (7th Cir.1998); <em>United States v. Gordon, </em>156 F.3d 376, 381 (2d. Cir.1998), we in this circuit have declined to adopt such a requirement. <em>See Magana v. Hofbauer, </em>263 F.3d 542, 548 n. 1 (6th Cir.2001). Nevertheless, it has been held, as the district court recognized, that a substantial disparity between the penalty offered by the prosecution and the punishment called for by the indictment is sufficient to establish a reasonable probability that a properly informed and advised defendant would have accepted the prosecution\u2019s offer. <em>See e.g., Gordon, </em>156 F.3d at 381 (disparity in sentences constitutes objective evidence that a properly informed defendant would have accepted a plea offer). It follows that the district court did not err in relying on such a disparity, along with the unrefuted testimony of the petitioner, to support its conclusion that habeas relief was required in this case. Certainly, we cannot say that the ruling \u201cshifted the burden to Respondent to prove that trial counsel was not deficient,\u201d as the state claims in its brief on appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b820-7\">For the reasons set out above, we AFFIRM the judgment of the district court.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b818-11\">. On appeal, Dedvukovic attempts to challenge the district court\u2019s denial of relief on his claim that an erroneous jury instruction denied him of due process and a fair trial. However, no certificate of appealability appears in the record to cover this claim.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
