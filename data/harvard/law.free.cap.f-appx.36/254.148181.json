The district court had jurisdiction under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3231, and we have jurisdiction over this timely appeal pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291 and 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3742. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b281-6\">Lugo first argues that 21 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 841 and 960 are unconstitutional under <em>Apprendi </em>because they classify drug quantity and drug type as facts relevant to sentencing rather than as elements of the crime. The constitutionality of a federal statute is a question of law reviewed de novo. <em>United States v. Jones, </em>231 F.3d 508, 513 (9th Cir.2000).</p>\n<p id=\"b281-7\">A recent Ninth Circuit en banc decision explicitly held 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 841 to be facially constitutional under <em>Apprendi v. New Jersey, </em>530 U.S. 466, 120 S.Ct. 2348, 147 L.Ed.2d 435 (2000). <em>United States v. Buckland, </em>277 F.3d 1173, 1177 (9th Cir. 2002) (en banc). Another recent Ninth Circuit decision applied the <em>Buckland </em>decision to 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 960(b) and held that statute facially constitutional under <em>Ap-prendi. United States v. Carranza, </em>289 F.3d 634 (9th Cir.2002). Therefore, Lugo\u2019s constitutional claims have already been decided against her.</p>\n<p id=\"b281-8\">Lugo\u2019s as-applied challenge to the constitutionality of sections 841 and 960 also fails because Lugo was never exposed to a sentence beyond the statutory maximum for the smallest quantity of drugs. Lugo was sentenced to twenty-one months, which is less than the statutory maximum of sixty months provided by sections 841(b)(1)(D) and 960(b)(4) for offenses involving less than fifty kilograms of marijuana. <em>See </em>21 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 841(b)(1)(D) <em>&amp; </em>960(b)(4).</p>\n<p id=\"b281-11\">Lugo also argues that her Fifth and Sixth Amendment rights to have every element presented to the trier of fact and the grand jury were violated by (1) the Government\u2019s failure to include <em>mens rea </em>terms as to drug quantity and type in the indictment, and (2) the court\u2019s failure to instruct the jury regarding the <em>mens rea </em>requirements as to drug quantity and type. The sufficiency of an indictment is reviewed de novo. <em>United States v. Pernillo-Fuentes, </em>252 F.3d 1030, 1032 (9th Cir. 2001) (citing <em>United States v. Tobias, </em>863 F.2d 685, 687 (9th Cir.1988)). \u201c \u201cWhether a jury instruction misstates elements of a statutory crime is a question of law reviewed de novo.\u2019 \u201d <em>United States v. Romo-Romo, </em>246 F.3d 1272, 1274 (9th Cir. 2001) (quoting <em>United States v. Johnson, </em>956 F.2d 197, 199 (9th Cir.1992)).</p>\n<p id=\"b281-12\">\u201cA defendant charged with importing or possessing a drag is not required to know the type and amount of drag,\u201d and <em>Ap-prendi </em>did not change this. <em>Carranza, </em>289 F.3d at 643. Therefore, the indictment was sufficient, and the jury instructions were proper.</p>\n<p id=\"b281-13\">Finally, Lugo argues that there was insufficient evidence of an importation to support her conviction under section 960 because there was no \u201centry\u201d of the contraband into the United States as she claims is required by 21 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 952 and 960 and defined by 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 951. She asserts that the district court therefore improperly denied her motion for a judgment of acquittal. We review de novo the district court\u2019s construction or interpretation of a statute. <em>See United States v. </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"256\">*256</page-number><em>Doe, </em>136 F.3d 631, 634 (9th Cir.1998). The short answer is that the special meaning of the term \u201centry\u201d in the immigration context does not apply to drug smuggling. <em>See Carranza, </em>289 F.3d at 643.</p>\n<p id=\"b282-4\">Other issues raised were considered, and we hold them to be without merit.</p>\n<p id=\"AHl\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b281-9\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and may not be cited to or by the courts of this circuit except as may be provided by Ninth Circuit Rule 36-3.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
