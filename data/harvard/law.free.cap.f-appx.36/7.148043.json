In 1997, McKee was convicted in New York state court of Murder in the Second Degree for the 1996 shooting of Teddy Vance. Three weeks before trial and over thirteen months after the crime, the government gave McKee, who is African-American, a memorandum prepared by an Assistant District Attorney, which summarized a telephone conversation with a police officer about a witness\u2019s statement implicating a Hispanic man in the shooting. However, when interviewed by the defense, the witness, Augustus Rivera, denied ever making the statement, and without Rivera\u2019s testimony affirming the statement, McKee was unable to introduce the substance of the memo, either for its truth or any other purposes.</p>\n<p id=\"b37-17\">The trial court <em>sua sponte </em>ordered a post-conviction hearing to determine whether the memorandum was <em>Brady </em>material and whether the delayed delivery impaired the defense\u2019s opportunity to use it. <em>Brady v. Maryland, </em>373 U.S. 83, 83 S.Ct. 1194,10 L.Ed.2d 215 (1963); <em>see also Kyles v. Whitley, </em>514 U.S. 419, 115 S.Ct. 1555, 131 L.Ed.2d 490 (1995). The court determined that the memorandum was <em>Brady </em>material, but that the delay did not prejudice McKee, because: [1] Rivera was still available; [2] there was no evidence in the record to support McKee\u2019s contention that Rivera would have affirmed the statement if interviewed sometime earlier; [3] a mid-trial continuance was granted to allow McKee as much time as necessary to further investigate the memo and its contents; and [4] the delayed disclosure had no effect on McKee\u2019s trial strategy.</p>\n<p id=\"b37-18\">McKee appealed the court\u2019s <em>Brady </em>ruling and its exclusion of the hearsay substance of the memo. The appellate court affirmed, and the Court of Appeals denied leave to appeal. McKee filed a timely habeas petition, pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254. The district court denied the application, and granted a certificate of ap-pealability pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(a).</p>\n<p id=\"b38-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"8\">*8</page-number>We affirm. The trial court\u2019s <em>Brady </em>ruling was sound, its evidentiary rulings were within its discretion, and it took a number of prudent measures to explore the circumstances and cure any prejudice it found. These rulings clearly were neither \u201ccontrary to\u201d nor involved \u201cunreasonable application^] of\u2019 established federal law, and the findings supporting the rulings were reasonable. 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254 (stating test for federal court to provide collateral relief to state prisoners).</p>\n<p id=\"b38-4\">For the reasons set forth above, the judgment of the district court is AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
