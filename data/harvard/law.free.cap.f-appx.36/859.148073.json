The district court dismissed for failure to state a claim pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915A(b)(1), but we conclude that further proceedings are necessary. Accordingly, we vacate and remand.</p>\n<p id=\"b882-4\">Chavez is serving prison terms totaling life plus 31 years at the United States Penitentiary at Terre Haute, Indiana. At sentencing in 1983, the district court in Arizona ordered him to pay restitution of $2,650 \u201cimmediately to the extent possible and then in regular monthly installments of not less than $25,\u201d and also imposed special assessments totaling $200 and payable \u201cimmediately.\u201d To facilitate the payment of restitution, prison officials at Terre Haute developed a payment schedule for Chavez, using procedures delineated by the Inmate Financial Responsibility Program (IFRP). 28 C.F.R \u00a7 545.10-11. For reasons unclear from the record, prison officials later placed Chavez on \u201crefusal\u201d status, indicating that he would not comply with his payment plan.</p>\n<p id=\"b882-5\">Unhappy with the prison\u2019s application of the IFRP, Chavez filed an informal grievance that was denied, and then tendered a formal grievance to a prison official for filing. Chavez alleges that this grievance was returned to him unfiled and that his two administrative appeals were subsequently denied because the formal grievance had not been properly filed. Chavez then turned to federal court.</p>\n<p id=\"b882-6\">Although Chavez labeled his suit as a civil rights action, it is in essence a challenge to the execution of his sentence and as such must be addressed as a petition for habeas corpus under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2241. <em>See Valona v. United States, </em>138 F.3d 693, 694 (7th Cir.1998). Exhaustion of administrative remedies is normally a prerequisite to seeking relief under \u00a7 2241, <em>see Clemente v. Allen, </em>120 F.3d 703, 705 (7th Cir.1997), but Chavez complains that his efforts to exhaust were impeded and in any event the requirement is not jurisdictional, <em>see Schiselman v. United States Parole Comm\u2019n, </em>858 F.2d 1232, 1234 n. 1 (7th Cir.1988).</p>\n<p id=\"b882-8\">Chavez principally contests the authority of the Bureau of Prisons (BOP) to schedule restitution payments where the sentencing court already set a schedule for him. Chavez was ordered to pay \u201cimmediately to the extent possible\u201d <em>and </em>\u201cat the rate of not less than $25 per month.\u201d As the district court stated, we have held that an IFRP payment schedule is not a usurpation of judicial power where the sentencing court ordered payment immediately \u201cto the extent possible.\u201d <em>McGhee v. Clark, </em>166 F.3d 884, 886 (7th Cir.1999). But the order here to pay \u201cnot less than $25 per month\u201d is more akin to the order to pay \u201cequal monthly installments\u201d in <em>United States v. Pandiello, </em>184 F.3d 682, 688 (7th Cir.1999), which we held to be an illegal delegation of judicial authority to the IFRP. Chavez thus has a colorable claim for relief, and the district court accordingly must revisit the issue of whether the sentencing court inappropriately delegated its authority.</p>\n<p id=\"b882-9\">Chavez also claims that, irrespective of how the BOP scheduled his restitution payments, he became exempt from paying his restitution five years after sentencing and that the BOP thus was illegally taking money from his prison account. The basis for Chavez\u2019s assertion is unclear, but this too is a challenge to the execution of his sentence that the district court must address in the first instance on remand. Of course, as with Chavez\u2019s first claim, we express no opinion as to the ultimate merit of his contention, and hold only that Chavez\u2019s petition warrants further development in the district court. On remand the district court should dismiss as defendants <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"861\">*861</page-number>all but James Cahill, because as the warden of Terre Haute he is the only proper defendant in Chavez\u2019s \u00a7 2241 action. <em>See Jackson v. Brennan, </em>924 F.2d 725, 727 n. 2 (7th Cir.1991).</p>\n<p id=\"b883-5\">Finally, in his district court filing Chavez also asserts claims under 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983, including that he was deprived of access to the courts when his formal grievance was returned unfiled. If Chavez wants to pursue these claims, he must file a \u00a7 1983 action separate from the present \u00a7 2241 petition. For purposes here, we note only that this court has never decided whether a denial-of-aecess-to-the-courts claim may be premised on interference with a prison grievance system, but regardless such a claim seems improbable here because Chavez would be unlikely to establish the prejudice that is an element of any such claim. <em>See Nance v. Vieregge, </em>147 F.3d 589, 591 (7th Cir.1998). But we need not decide this question because Chavez must raise his access-to-the-courts claim in a separate \u00a7 1983 filing.</p>\n<p id=\"b883-6\">Accordingly, we VACATE the district court\u2019s judgment and REMAND the case to the district court for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
