We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b623-7\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b623-8\">1. <em>Quantity of Drugs</em></p>\n<p id=\"b623-9\">Parker was sentenced based on a quantity of drugs seized from his codefendants who stated that they were instructed to deliver the drugs to Parker. The court found the statements \u201ccorroborate and establish\u201d that the quantity of drugs seized \u201cwas intended for delivery to the defendant.\u201d This evidence is sufficient to hold Parker accountable for the drugs. <em>See United States v. Aichele, </em>941 F.2d 761, 766 (9th Cir.1991). Nothing in the record supports Parker\u2019s claim that the district court impermissibly based its sentence on his refusal to testify or present evidence at sentencing.</p>\n<p id=\"b623-10\">We reject Parker\u2019s claim that his sentence violates <em>Apprendi v. New Jersey, </em>530 U.S. 466, 120 S.Ct. 2348, 147 L.Ed.2d 435 (2000). The district court\u2019s finding regarding drug quantity did not expose him to a sentence greater than the \u201cprescribed statutory maximum.\u201d <em>See United States v. Carranza, </em>289 F.3d 634, 643 (9th Cir.2002). The district court was therefore not required to submit the quantity of drugs to a jury for proof beyond a reasonable doubt. <em>See United States v. Buckland, </em>289 F.3d 558, 564-65 (9th Cir.2002) (en banc), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S.-, 122 S.Ct. 2314, \u2014 L.Ed.2d - (2002); <em>United States v. Mendozar-Paz, </em>286 F.3d 1104, 1110-11 (9th Cir.2002).</p>\n<p id=\"b623-15\">2. <em>Safety Valve Reduction</em></p>\n<p id=\"b623-16\">Parker argues that he is entitled to a reduced sentence based on the safety valve provisions of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(f). The district court denied the reduction because Parker did not make a \u201ctruthful and unreserved exposition of his criminal activity.\u201d Parker contends that he told all that he knew and that the reduction is available even when a defendant \u201chas no relevant or useful ... information to provide.... \u201d U.S.S.G. \u00a7 5C1.2(a)(5).</p>\n<p id=\"b623-17\">While we agree that the reduction is available to a defendant who provides \u201call information at his disposal,\u201d whether relevant or not, <em>see United States v. Shrestha, </em>86 F.3d 935, 938 (9th Cir.1996), the district court here found that Parker withheld information regarding other individuals involved in the conspiracy. Parker\u2019s \u201cbare assertion\u201d to the contrary is not sufficient to carry his burden of establishing eligibility. <em>See United States v. Ajugwo, </em>82 F.3d 925, 929 (9th Cir.1996). Moreover, the district court is not obligated to believe a story that \u201crings false.\u201d <em>See United States v. Lopez, </em>163 F.3d 1142, 1143 (9th Cir. 1998). Finally, we reject Parker\u2019s contention that the district court\u2019s findings were insufficient to permit appellate review. <em>See United States v. Real-Hernandez, </em>90 F.3d 356, 360 (9th Cir.1996).</p>\n<p id=\"b623-18\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b623-13\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and may not be cited to or by the courts of this circuit except as may be provided by Ninth Circuit Rule 36-3.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
