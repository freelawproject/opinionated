We have jurisdiction pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291. We review de novo the district court\u2019s order and we uphold the Commissioner\u2019s decision if it is supported by substantial evidence and is free of legal error. <em>Holohan v. Massa-nari, </em>246 F.3d 1195, 1201 (9th Cir.2001). We reverse and remand for payment of benefits.</p>\n<p id=\"b944-8\">The vocational expert (\u201cVE\u201d) testified that if Champion could not complete a normal work day, combined with her other limitations, she could not perform any job in the national economy. The administrative law judge (\u201cALJ\u201d) concluded that Champion could complete a normal work day by rejecting the opinions of Champion\u2019s treating and examining physicians, Champion\u2019s testimony, and the lay witness statements from Champion\u2019s mother and sister. The ALJ\u2019s rejection of this evidence was erroneous.</p>\n<p id=\"b944-9\">First, the ALJ did not provide \u201cspecific and legitimate\u201d reasons for rejecting the opinions of Champion\u2019s treating and examining physicians in favor of the non-examining physicians. <em>See id. </em>at 1203. For example, the ALJ rejected the treating physician\u2019s opinion that Champion\u2019s mental impairments precluded her from working, in part because about fifteen months earlier the doctor had opined that Champion could possibly go back to work in a job that required less encounters with the public. The ALJ\u2019s selective reliance on the treating physician\u2019s earlier opinion is not supported by the record. <em>Cf. Lester v. Chater, </em>81 F.3d 821, 833 (9th Cir.1995) (treating physician\u2019s more recent opinion based upon more complete record was entitled to more weight than earlier opinion that indicated claimant had occasional symptom-free periods).</p>\n<p id=\"b944-13\">Second, the ALJ\u2019s adverse credibility finding against Champion is not supported by clear and convincing reasons. <em>See Re-gennitter v. Commissioner, </em>166 F.3d 1294, 1296-98 (9th Cir.1999). For example, the medical evidence explained that Champion\u2019s headaches were associated with menopause and therefore were of recent origin, and the medical evidence supported her testimony that she suffers from agoraphobia. <em>Cf. id. </em>(reversing ALJ\u2019s adverse credibility determination because it was not supported by clear and convincing reasons).</p>\n<p id=\"b944-14\">Finally, the ALJ failed to provide specific reasons for rejecting the lay witness statements from Champion\u2019s mother and sister concerning the symptoms of Champion\u2019s bipolar disorder and the adverse effects of the medication prescribed to treat that disorder. <em>See Nguyen v. Cha-ter, </em>100 F.3d 1462, 1467 (9th Cir.1996).</p>\n<p id=\"b945-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"923\">*923</page-number>REVERSED and REMANDED for payment of benefits.</p>\n<footnote label=\"***\">\n<p id=\"b944-15\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and may not be cited to or by the courts of this circuit except as may be provided by 9 th Cir.
