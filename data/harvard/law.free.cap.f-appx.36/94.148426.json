On appeal, Lamb argues the district court erred in finding he possessed a dangerous weapon for purposes of <em>U.S. Sentencing Guidelines Manual </em>\u00a7 2D1.1(b)(1) (2000). We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b125-10\">A two-level enhancement must be given under USSG \u00a7 2D1.1(b)(1) if a dangerous weapon was possessed during the offense. The enhancement applies if the weapon is present, \u201cunless it is clearly improbable that the weapon was connected with the offense.\u201d USSG \u00a7 2D1.1, comment, (n.3). The determination that a weapon enhancement is warranted is a factual question subject to clearly erroneous review. <em>United States v. Apple, </em>915 F.2d 899, 914 (4th Cir.1990). Because a confidential informant testified that he saw Lamb possess a firearm on at least four occasions during drug distribution activities, and because Lamb fails to establish it was clearly improbable that the weapon was connected with the offense, we conclude the district court did not clearly err.</p>\n<p id=\"b125-11\">For these reasons, we affirm Lamb\u2019s sentence. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b125-13\">\n<em>AFFIRMED.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
