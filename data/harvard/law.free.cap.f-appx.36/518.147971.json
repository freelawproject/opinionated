For the following reasons, we dismiss Hampton\u2019s appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b542-19\">We find no merit in any of Hampton\u2019s ineffective assistance of counsel claims. <em>See Strickland v. Washington, </em>466 U.S. 668, 104 S.Ct. 2052, 80 L.Ed.2d 674 (1984). The district court was entitled to rely on conduct charged in a dismissed count of Hampton\u2019s indictment in enhancing Hamp-ton\u2019s offense level under <em>U.S. Sentencing Guidelines Manual </em>\u00a7 2K2.1(b)(5) (2000). <em>See United States v. Williams, </em>880 F.2d 804, 805 (4th Cir.1989). Similarly, the court properly relied on Hampton\u2019s prior state convictions in the calculation of his criminal history. <em>See Daniels v. United States, </em>532 U.S. 374, 382, 121 S.Ct. 1578, 149 L.Ed.2d 590 (2001). Therefore, Hamp-ton did not receive ineffective assistance of counsel in these respects. Finally, Hamp-ton\u2019s ineffective assistance claim predicated on <em>United States v. Lopez, </em>514 U.S. 549, 115 S.Ct. 1624, 131 L.Ed.2d 626 (1995), is equally meritless. <em>See United States v. Wells, </em>98 F.3d 808, 811 (4th Cir.1996) (citing cases).</p>\n<p id=\"b542-20\">Accordingly, we deny a certificate of appealability and dismiss Hampton\u2019s appeal. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b542-21\">\n<em>DISMISSED.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
