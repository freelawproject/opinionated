We have jurisdiction under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3742(b) and 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291, and we reverse.</p>\n<p id=\"b282-20\">Despite our considerable deference to the district court in these matters, departure in these circumstances was an abuse of discretion. <em>See Koon v. United States, </em>518 U.S. 81, 98, 116 S.Ct. 2035, 135 L.Ed.2d 392 (1996). We may assume that the ability to repay restitution should be characterized as something other than a socio-economic factor in the circumstances here. However, we must still address the determination that this case fell outside the heartland. \u201cThe relevant question ... is not ... whether a particular factor is within the heartland as a general proposition, but whether the particular factor is within the heartland given all the facts of the case.\u201d <em>Koon, </em>518 U.S. at 99-100 (citation and internal quotations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b282-21\">The considerations articulated by the district court, including Williams\u2019s ability to work and repay restitution, his entitlement to retirement benefits, his age, and his physical condition, were insufficient to take this case outside the heartland of cases governed by U.S. Sentencing Guidelines Manual \u00a7 2F1.1 (deleted Nov. 1, 2001). Therefore, we remand for resen-tencing.</p>\n<p id=\"b282-22\">REVERSED and REMANDED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b282-18\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and may not be cited to or by the courts of this circuit except as may be provided by Ninth Circuit Rule 36-3.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
