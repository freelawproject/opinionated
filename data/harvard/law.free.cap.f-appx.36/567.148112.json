After the district court<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> sustained Ramos-Corona\u2019s objections to the presentence report\u2019s drug-quantity determination and 2-level firearm enhancement, he was subject to a Guidelines imprisonment range of 97-121 months and a statutory mandatory minimum sentence of 120 months. The court then sentenced him to 121 months in prison and 5 years supervised release.</p>\n<p id=\"b591-18\">On appeal Ramos-Corona\u2019s counsel has moved to withdraw and filed a brief under <em>Anders v. California, </em>386 U.S. 738, 87 S.Ct. 1396, 18 L.Ed.2d 493 (1967), arguing the district court should have sentenced Ramos-Corona to 120 rather than 121 months imprisonment. We may not review a sentence, however, simply because it is at the top of a properly calculated Guidelines range. <em>See United States v. Woodrum, </em>959 F.2d 100, 101 (8th Cir.1992) (per curiam).</p>\n<p id=\"b591-20\">Having found no nonfrivolous issues in our independent review of the record, <em>see Penson v. Ohio, </em>488 U.S. 75, 80, 109 S.Ct. 346, 102 L.Ed.2d 300 (1988), we grant counsel\u2019s motion to withdraw and we affirm.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b591-33\">. The Honorable Richard G.
