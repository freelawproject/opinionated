Sanyaolu filed a notice of appeal, but his counsel has moved to withdraw because in his view there are no nonfrivolous grounds for appeal. <em>See An-ders v. California, </em>386 U.S. 738, 87 S.Ct. 1396, 18 L.Ed.2d 493 (1967). Counsel\u2019s <em>Anders </em>brief is facially adequate and Sa-nyaolu has not responded to it, so we limit our review of the record to the potential issues counsel discusses. <em>United States v. Tabb, </em>125 F.3d 583, 584 (7th Cir.1997) (per curiam).</p>\n<p id=\"b246-19\">Counsel initially considers whether Sanyaolu could assert a nonfrivolous challenge to his sentence. In particular, counsel considers arguing that the district court should have departed downward, but properly deems this contention frivolous because Sanyaolu never moved for a downward departure in the district court. <em>See United States v. Dillard, </em>43 F.3d 299, 311 (7th Cir.1994) (defendant waived argument that he was entitled to departure where he never raised it in district court); <em>United States v. Kellum, </em>42 F.3d 1087, 1096 (7th Cir.1994) (same).</p>\n<p id=\"b246-20\">Counsel next assesses whether Sanyaolu could seek from this court an order compelling the government to bring federal drug charges against the cooperating witness who set up a drug deal with Sanyaolu. As counsel correctly concludes, however, such an argument would be frivolous be<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"217\">*217</page-number>cause, even assuming Sanyaolu could raise such a claim, charging decisions are not the province of the federal judiciary. <em>See United States v. Martin, </em>287 F.3d 609, 623 (7th Cir.2002) (observing that the \u201cjudiciary cannot compel prosecutions\u201d); <em>United States v. Giannattasio, </em>979 F.2d 98, 100 (7th Cir.1992) (\u201cA judge in our system does not have the authority to tell prosecutors which crimes to prosecute or when to prosecute them.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b247-5\">Counsel\u2019s motion to withdraw is GRANTED and the appeal is DISMISSED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
