The district court dismissed Simi\u2019s case as time-barred, and we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b627-7\">The limitations period was not tolled while Simi challenged DHS\u2019s 1995 and 1996 audits. DHS\u2019s 1995 and 1996 audits do not arise out of the same transaction as its 1997 audit; DHS considers each year\u2019s audit to be a separate decision and relies on different sets of documents for each audit. Because DHS\u2019s issuance of Simi\u2019s 1997 audit is a separate transaction, DHS did not have adequate notice that Simi\u2019s appeal of the 1995 and 1996 decisions would result in a \u00a7 1983 challenge to the 1997 decision. And DHS was prejudiced by Simi\u2019s delay because it had no incentive to gather and preserve the separate set of documents that were the foundation of its 1997 audit. Finally, Simi did not act reasonably in waiting until the 1995 and 1996 audits were resolved until filing its \u00a7 1983 claim. Indeed, a recent settlement of Simi\u2019s challenges to the 1995 and 1996 audits has had no impact on DHS\u2019s 1997 audit decision. In these circumstances there is no basis for equitable tolling. <em>See Daviton v. Columbia/HCA Healthcare Corp., </em>241 F.3d 1131, 1137 (9th Cir.2001) (en banc); <em>Elkins v.
