The Administrative Law Judge (\u201cALJ\u201d) found that Horsley had not timely filed his claim and that equitable tolling would not excuse his neglect. We have jurisdiction pursuant to 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1324b(i)(1). The agency\u2019s conclusions of law concerning IRCA are reviewed de novo, with a \u201ccertain amount of deference\u201d to reasonable statutory interpretations. <em>Mester Mfg. Co. v. INS, </em>879 F.2d 561, 565 (9th Cir.1989). We deny the petition for review.</p>\n<p id=\"b347-22\">The ALJ properly held that Horsley\u2019s OCAHO complaint, filed 917 days after the receipt of the right-to-sue letter, was not filed within the 90-day time limit. <em>See 8 </em>U.S.C. \u00a7 1324b(d)(2). The ALJ also properly found that equitable tolling was not appropriate when Horsley knew and understood that he had to file within 90 days <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"324\">*324</page-number>of the receipt of the right-to-sue letter but decided not to file the complaint because he was unsure whether his case was \u201cwithout reasonable foundation in law or fact.\u201d Even if we generously tolled the limitations period until the date on which the agency provided all of the information Horsley had requested, the complaint was not filed for another six months-well beyond the 90-day limitations period. As \u201cthere is no reason why a plaintiff should enjoy a manipulable open-ended time extension which could render the statutory limitation meaningless,\u201d we deny the petition for review. <em>Scholar v. Pacific Bell, </em>963 F.2d 264, 268 (9th Cir.1992).</p>\n<p id=\"b348-4\">DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b347-11\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and may not be cited to or by the courts of this circuit except as may be provided by Ninth Circuit Rule 36-3.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
