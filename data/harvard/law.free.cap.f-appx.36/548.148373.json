Duggan, United States District Judge for the Eastern District of Michigan, sitting by designation.</p>\n</footnote>\n<opinion data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"majority\">\n<p id=\"b572-12\">Harry Wright, proceeding pro se, appeals a magistrate judge\u2019s order denying his motion for relief from judgment filed pursuant to Fed.R.Civ.P. 60(b). This case has been referred to a panel of the court pursuant to Rule 34(j)(1), Rules of the Sixth Circuit. Upon examination, this panel unanimously agrees that oral argument is not needed. Fed. R.App. P. 34(a).</p>\n<p id=\"b572-13\">On April 25, 1997, Wright filed a complaint against the Northeast Ohio Regional Sewer District (\u201cNortheast\u201d), his former employer; the Laborers\u2019 International Union of North America, Local 860, his former union; Edwin O\u2019Deal, Thomas Smeal, and Jeffrey Looby, Northeast employees; and Ken Yuko and William Gallitz, union officials. Wright, an African-American, was employed as a security guard for Northeast from 1989 to 1996. Wright\u2019s employment was terminated in 1996 for sleeping while on duty on several occasions during the course of his employment. Wright alleged, however, that his employment was terminated because of his race and in retaliation because he had engaged in protected activity. Wright also alleged that his union discriminated against him on the basis of race by failing to adequately represent him during his disciplinary proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b572-16\">The parties consented to have a magistrate judge exercise jurisdiction over the action pursuant to the provisions of 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 636(c). On March 4, 1999, the magistrate judge granted the defendants\u2019 motions for summary judgment and dismissed the case. On appeal, this court affirmed the magistrate judge\u2019s judgment, and subsequently denied Wright\u2019s petition for rehearing.</p>\n<p id=\"b572-17\">On August 3, 2001, Wright filed a motion for relief from judgment pursuant to Fed. R.Civ.P. 60(b), which was denied by the magistrate judge. Wright has filed a timely appeal. The defendants\u2019 \u201cjoint motion to allow existing record to stand on its own merit\u201d has been granted by this court.</p>\n<p id=\"b572-18\">We review the magistrate judge\u2019s denial of a Fed.R.Civ.P. 60(b) motion for an abuse of discretion. <em>Cincinnati Ins. Co. v. Byers, </em>151 F.3d 574, 578 (6th Cir.1998); <em>Good v. Ohio Edison Co., </em>149 F.3d 413, 423 (6th Cir.1998). An abuse of discretion has been defined as a \u201c \u2018definite and firm conviction that the trial court committed a clear error of judgment.\u2019\u201d <em>Byers, </em>151 F.3d at 578-79 (quoting <em>Logan v. Dayton </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"549\">*549</page-number><em>Hudson Corp., </em>865 F.2d 789, 790 (6th Cir. 1989)). An appeal \u201cfrom denial of Rule 60(b) relief does not bring up the underlying judgment for review.\u201d <em>Browder v. Dir., Dep\u2019t of Corr., </em>434 U.S. 257, 263 n. 7, 98 S.Ct. 556, 54 L.Ed.2d 521 (1978). Rather, this court\u2019s inquiry is limited to \u201cwhether one of the specified circumstances exists in which [the plaintiff] is entitled to reopen the merits of his underlying claims.\u201d <em>Feathers v. Chevron U.S.A., Inc., </em>141 F.3d 264, 268 (6th Cir.1998).</p>\n<p id=\"b573-5\">Upon review, we conclude that the magistrate judge did not abuse his discretion when he denied Wright\u2019s Fed.R.Civ.P. 60(b) motion for relief from judgment, as Wright failed to demonstrate the existence of any of the grounds for relief specified in Fed.R.Civ.P. 60(b)(1)-(6). In his motion for relief from judgment, Wright merely reiterated the arguments that had already been made throughout the course of the prior proceedings and argued that the United States Supreme Court\u2019s decision in <em>Reeves v. Sanderson Plumbing Prods., Inc., </em>530 U.S. 133, 120 S.Ct. 2097, 147 L.Ed.2d 105 (2000), \u201chas reversed Prior underlying judgement [sic ].\u201d Contrary to Wright\u2019s contention, the <em>Reeves </em>decision did not reverse or vacate any of the decisions upon which the magistrate judge relied when granting the defendants\u2019 motions for summary judgment and dismissing his employment discrimination case.</p>\n<p id=\"b573-6\">Accordingly, the magistrate judge\u2019s order is affirmed. Rule 34(j)(2)(C), Rules of the Sixth Circuit.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
