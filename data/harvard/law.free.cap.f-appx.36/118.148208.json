The district court imposed 135 month and 86-month sentences on Enriquez and Gonzales, respectively, and they each appealed.</p>\n<p id=\"b149-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"119\">*119</page-number>Each defendant\u2019s appeal raises only sentencing issues. In No. 01-4013, Enriquez renews a written objection to his presentence report that he failed to raise at his sentencing hearing: that his offense level should not have been enhanced by two levels for his leadership role in the conspiracy pursuant to <em>United States Sentencing Guidelines Manual </em>\u00a7 3B1.1(c) (2000). Enriquez also challenges the district court\u2019s determinations as to the acceptance of responsibility offense level adjustment and its decision not to depart downward. In No. 01 \u2014 4127, Gonzales (despite his waiver of his right to appeal), challenges only the extent of the district court\u2019s downward departure.</p>\n<p id=\"b149-5\">Enriquez\u2019s initial objection, challenging application of an offense level enhancement for his supervisory role pursuant to \u00a7 3B1.1(c), fails to demonstrate plain error. While Enriquez claims the acquittal of Bernardo Valdes, a co-conspirator named in the same indictment returned against Enriquez, indicates Valdes cannot be \u201ccriminally responsible,\u201d and thus \u201csupervised\u201d by Enriquez within the meaning of \u00a7 3B1.1, we find neither Valdes\u2019 acquittal nor Enriquez\u2019s related arguments on this issue demonstrate plain error. <em>See United States v. Wells, </em>163 F.3d 889, 900 (4th Cir.1998); <em>United States v. Haun, </em>90 F.3d 1096, 1103 (6th Cir.1996).</p>\n<p id=\"b149-6\">Enriquez\u2019s second objection, that the district court improperly denied a downward adjustment to his offense level for acceptance of responsibility under USSG \u00a7 3E1.1, is also meritless. The district court imposed an obstruction of justice enhancement to Enriquez\u2019s offense level under USSG \u00a7 3C1.1, because Enriquez attempted to influence his co-conspirators\u2019 cooperation with the Government, and because Enriquez perjured himself at Valdes\u2019 trial. While Enriquez acknowledges that downward adjustments under \u00a7 3E1.1 are ordinarily incompatible with enhancements under \u00a7 3C1.1, Enriquez contends the district court was required to make findings in accordance with <em>United States v. Dunnigan, </em>507 U.S. 87, 92-98, 113 S.Ct. 1111, 122 L.Ed.2d 445 (1993), in order to deny the \u00a7 3E1.1 adjustment based on his perjured testimony. That claim overlooks an independent basis for applying a \u00a7 3C1.1 enhancement: that Enriquez attempted to tamper with his co-conspirators\u2019 statements to the Government. Because there is an independent basis for sustaining Enriquez\u2019s \u00a7 3C1.1 enhancement, and Enriquez\u2019s behavior after pleading guilty indicates the district court did not err in concluding Enriquez did not completely accept responsibility, we find no error in the denial of a downward adjustment under \u00a7 3E1.1.</p>\n<p id=\"b149-8\">Enriquez\u2019s third assignment of error is dismissed. The district court\u2019s statements in denying Enriquez\u2019s request for a downward departure based on his health and alienage do not indicate a misapprehension of its authority to depart. <em>See United States v. Rowen, </em>73 F.3d 1061, 1063 (10th Cir.1996). As a result, that claim is unre-viewable. <em>See United States v. Aramony, </em>166 F.3d 655, 664-65 (4th Cir.1999).</p>\n<p id=\"b149-9\">Finally, Gonzales\u2019 sole claim on appeal, challenging the extent of the district court\u2019s downward departure, is also unre-viewable. Gonzales executed a knowing and voluntary waiver of his right to appeal this issue, <em>see United States v. Wessells, </em>936 F.2d 165, 167-68 (4th Cir.1991), and Gonzales offers no independent basis to question the legality of his sentence, <em>see United States v. Brown, </em>232 F.3d 399, 403 (4th Cir.2000); <em>United States v. Attar, </em>38 F.3d 727, 732-33 (4th Cir.1994); <em>United States v. Marin, </em>961 F.2d 493, 496 (4th Cir.1992).</p>\n<p id=\"b149-10\">Accordingly, we affirm in part and dismiss in part as to Enriquez\u2019s appeal of his <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"120\">*120</page-number>sentence in No. 01-4013, and dismiss Gonzales\u2019 appeal in No. 01-4127 based on his waiver of appellate rights in his plea agreement. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b150-4\">\n<em>AFFIRMED IN PART, DISMISSED IN PART</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b150-5\">\n<em>DISMISSED.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b148-27\"> Enriquez also pled guilty to the second count of the indictment, charging him with possession of the marijuana in question with intent to distribute in violation of 21 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 841 (West 1999 &amp; Supp.2001).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
