We have reviewed the record and the BIA\u2019s decision and conclude that the BIA did not abuse its discretion by denying their motion to file their brief out of time. <em>See </em>8 C.F.R. \u00a7 3.3(c)(1) (2001); <em>Huicochea-Gomez v. INS, </em>237 F.3d 696, 700-01 (6th Cir.2001). We further conclude the BIA used the correct standard to review the immigration judge\u2019s assessment of the Kayesses\u2019 credibility. <em>See Matter of </em>A-S-Interim Decision 3336 (BIA 1998). In addition, we defer to the BIA\u2019s credibility determination and find that the Kayesses did not meet their burden of establishing they were eligible for suspension of deportation. <em>INS v. Elias-Zacarias, </em>502 U.S. 478, 481-83, 112 S.Ct. 812, 117 L.Ed.2d 38 (1992); <em>Figeroa v. INS, </em>886 F.2d 76, 78-79 (4th Cir.1989).</p>\n<p id=\"b115-10\">Accordingly, we affirm the BIA\u2019s order. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the material before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b115-12\">\n<em>AFFIRMED.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
