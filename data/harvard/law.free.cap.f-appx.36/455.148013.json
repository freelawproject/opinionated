Palazzolo\u2019s proceeding. We <em>affirm.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b479-17\">Tomscha, one of Palazzolo\u2019s counterparts, is a New York regional vice president of the American Federation for Government Employees Council 236. On August 12, 2000, he filed a motion to intervene, accompanied by an affidavit, in support of Palazzolo\u2019s petition for review of his removal by the General Services Administration. The board denied Toms-cha\u2019s motion because he did not demonstrate that he would have been affected directly by the outcome of Palazzolo\u2019s proceeding. Tomscha asserts that Palaz-zolo\u2019s removal affects his ability to make disclosures regarding GSA\u2019s activities without fear of reprisal.</p>\n<p id=\"b479-18\">Under Merit Systems Protection Board regulations, a person, organization, or agency may permissively intervene in a board proceeding. <em>See </em>5 C.F.R. \u00a7 1201.34(c)(1) (2002). \u201cA motion for permission to intervene will be granted where the requester will be affected directly by the outcome of the proceeding.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at \u00a7 1201.34(c)(2).</p>\n<p id=\"b479-19\">We must affirm the final decision of the board unless we determine that it is \u201c(1) arbitrary, capricious, an abuse of discretion, or otherwise not in accordance with law; (2) obtained without procedures required by law, rule, or regulation having been followed; or (3) unsupported by substantial evidence.\u201d 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 7703(c) (2000).</p>\n<p id=\"b479-20\">Tomscha\u2019s affidavit does not provide any detail of how he was directly affected by the outcome of Palazzolo\u2019s proceeding. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"456\">*456</page-number>Accordingly, we decline to disturb the board\u2019s ruling.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
