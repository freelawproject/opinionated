Pursuant to the Illegal Immigration Reform and Immigrant Responsibility Act of 1996 (\u201cIIRIRA\u201d), the transitional rules apply, <em>see Kalaw v. INS, </em>133 F.3d 1147, 1150 (9th Cir.1997), and we therefore have jurisdiction under 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1105a(a), as amended by IIRIRA \u00a7 309(c), <em>see Avetova-Elisseva v. INS, </em>213 F.3d 1192, 1195 n. 4 (9th Cir.2000). We deny the petition for review.</p>\n<p id=\"b657-7\">Gonzalez-Corona contends that \u00a7 309(c)(5) of IIRIRA deprives him of due process because it is unconstitutionally vague in its application of the \u201cstop-time rule.\u201d We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b657-8\">In <em>Ram v. INS, </em>243 F.3d 510, 516 (9th Cir.2001), we held that there is \u201conly one reasonable interpretation\u201d of \u00a7 309(c)(5)\u2014 that it applies to transitional rule aliens such as Gonzalez-Corona. Accordingly, \u00a7 309(c)(5) is not unconstitutionally vague.</p>\n<p id=\"b657-9\">Gonzalez-Corona further contends that the statute is unconstitutionally vague as applied to individuals convicted of certain crimes. Gonzalez-Corona lacks standing to raise the issue, as the stop-time rule applied to him does not involve the commission of any crime.</p>\n<p id=\"b657-10\">Gonzalez-Corona contends that IIRIRA violates due process by failing to directly amend section 244(a)(1) of the Immigration and Nationality Act, 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1254(a)(1) (repealed 1996). This contention lacks merit because transitional procedures need not be placed in the body of permanent law. See <em>Id. </em>at 514 &amp; n. 6.</p>\n<p id=\"b657-13\">We do not consider petitioner\u2019s eligibility, if any, for relief under the class action pending in the district court in accordance with <em>Barahona-Gomez v. Reno, </em>167 F.3d 1228 (9th Cir.1999), <em>supplemental opinion, </em>236 F.3d 1115 (9th Cir.2001). Our resolution of this case does not affect any interim or permanent relief awarded to members of the class certified in <em>Barahona-Gomez.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b657-14\">PETITION FOR REVIEW DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b657-11\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and may not be cited to or by the courts of this circuit except as may be provided by Ninth Circuit Rule 36-3.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
