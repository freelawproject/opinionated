Pacificare removed the case to federal court, and filed a motion to dismiss on the basis that Hower\u2019s claims were preempted by ERISA. Hower moved to remand the case to state court, arguing that the tortious breach of the implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing fit under the insurance savings clause in ERISA. The parties are otherwise familiar with the facts, and we do not repeat them here.</p>\n<p id=\"b277-20\">The district court held that Hower\u2019s cause of action was preempted by ERISA, 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 1144(a), because it was a law that regulated insurance, but that it was not saved, because of the Supreme Court\u2019s decision in <em>Pilot Life Ins. Co. v. Dedeaux, </em>481 U.S. 41, 57, 107 S.Ct. 1549, 95 L.Ed.2d 39 (1987) and the Ninth Circuit\u2019s decisions in <em>Parrino v. FHP, Inc., </em>146 F.3d 699, 704-05 (9th Cir.1998) and <em>Kanne v. Connecticut General Life Ins. Co., </em>867 F.2d 489, 494 (9th Cir.1988). The court granted Pacificare\u2019s motion to dismiss for failure to state a claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b278-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"252\">*252</page-number>Hower\u2019s argument that her claim is not preempted by ERISA directly challenges the Supreme Court\u2019s decision in <em>Pilot Life, </em>and the prevailing law in the Ninth Circuit which states that a claim for breach of the implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing of an insurance contract is preempted by ERISA. <em>See e.g. Bast v. Prudential Ins. Co. of Am., </em>150 F.3d 1003, 1007-08 (9th Cir.1998); <em>Parrino, </em>146 F.3d at 704-05; <em>Crull v. GEM Ins. Co., </em>58 F.3d 1386, 1390-91 (9th Cir.1995); <em>Tingey v. Pixley-Richards West, Inc., </em>953 F.2d 1124, 1133 (9thCir.1992); <em>see also Olson v. General Dynamics Corp., </em>960 F.2d 1418 (9th Cir.1991); <em>Kanne, </em>867 F.2d at 494.</p>\n<p id=\"b278-4\">Further, our jurisprudence explicitly states that the civil enforcement provision of ERISA is meant to be exclusive. <em>Crull, </em>58 F.3d at 1390-91. A claim for breach of the implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing provides a remedy that is outside the scope of ERISA\u2019s civil enforcement provisions, and therefore, is not allowed. <em>Pilot Life Ins. Co. </em>481 at 57, 107 S.Ct. 1549.</p>\n<p id=\"b278-5\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"***\">\n<p id=\"b277-21\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and may not be cited to or by the courts of this circuit except as provided by Ninth Circuit Rule 36-3.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
