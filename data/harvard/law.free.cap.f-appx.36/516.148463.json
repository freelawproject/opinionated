On appeal, Wilson contends that the district court erred by dismissing his claims of fraud, perjury, and conspiracy stemming from a magazine sweepstakes promotion.<footnotemark>*</footnotemark> Finding no error, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b540-19\">We review an award of summary judgment de novo. <em>Higgins v. E.I. DuPont de Nemours &amp; Co., </em>863 F.2d 1162, 1167 (4th Cir.1988). Summary judgment is appropriate when \u201cthe pleadings, depositions, answers to interrogatories, and admissions on file, together with the affidavits, if any, show that there is no genuine issue as to any material fact and that the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.\u201d Fed.R.Civ.P. 56(c); <em>Anderson v. Liberty Lobby, Inc., </em>477 U.S. 242, 247-49, 106 S.Ct. 2505, 91 L.Ed.2d 202 (1986). In determining whether the moving party has shown that there is no genuine issue of material fact, we assess the factual evidence and all inferences to be drawn therefrom in the light most favorable to the non-moving party. <em>Id. </em>at 255; <em>Smith v. Va. Commonwealth Univ., </em>84 F.3d 672, 675 (4th Cir.1996).</p>\n<p id=\"b540-20\">We have reviewed Wilson\u2019s claims and find them meritless. Accordingly, we affirm on the reasoning of the district court. <em>See Wilson v. President, Time, Inc., </em>No. CA-00-2293-1-13AK (D.S.C. Dec. 7, 2001). We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b540-21\">\n<em>AFFIRMED.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b540-17\"> Wilson raised several other claims in his original complaint, but he failed to raise those claims on appeal. Therefore, he has waived review of those claims. <em>See </em>4th Cir. R. 34(b).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
