The estate may not deduct any more of the corpus than this amount.</p>\n<p id=\"b626-4\">\u201cWe defer to ... regulatory interpretations of the [Internal Revenue] Code so long as they are reasonable.\u201d <em>Sessler v. United States, </em>7 F.3d 1449, 1451 n. 2 (9th Cir.1993). The regulation challenged here is reasonable and consistent with the Code. <em>See </em>26 U.S.C. \u00a7 2056(b)(7)(B)(ii) (\u201cThe surviving spouse has a qualifying income interest for life if ... the surviving spouse is entitled to <em>all </em>the income from the property ....\u201d) (emphasis added). Mrs. Sansone is entitled to all the income from $1,041,719 of the corpus; therefore, she has a qualifying income interest for life only in that specific portion of the corpus.</p>\n<p id=\"b626-5\">The Sansone trust is not a \u201cqualified charitable remainder trust\u201d under 26 U.S.C. \u00a7 2056(b)(8); therefore, the challenged regulation applies. To be a \u201cqualified charitable remainder trust,\u201d the trust must be either \u201ca charitable remainder annuity trust or [a] charitable remainder unitrust.\u201d 26 U.S.C. \u00a7 2056(b)(8)(B)(ii). The Sansone trust is not the former because the annual payments are not of a \u201csum certain,\u201d but instead could fluctuate with inflation. 26 U.S.C. \u00a7 664(d)(1)(a) (a charitable remainder annuity trust is a trust \u201cfrom which a sum certain ... is to be paid\u201d); 26 C.F.R. \u00a7 1.664-2(a)(1)(ii) (\u201cA sum certain is a stated dollar amount which is the same ... for each year of such period.\u201d). Nor is it the latter, because the annual payments are not based on a fixed percentage of the corpus. <em>See </em>26 U.S.C. \u00a7 664(d)(2)(A) (a charitable remainder unitrust is a trust \u201cfrom which a fixed percentage [of the corpus] is to be paid\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b626-9\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b625-30\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and may not be cited to or by the courts of this circuit except as may be provided by Ninth Circuit Rule 36-3.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b626-6\">. This rule \"applies with respect to estates of decedents dying on or before October 24, 1992.\u201d 26 C.F.R. \u00a7 20.2056(b)-7(e)(5).
