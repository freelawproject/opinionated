The District Court held that the prisoner\u2019s \u00a7 1983 claims should be dismissed pursuant to the Supreme Court\u2019s decision in <em>Edwards v. Balisok, </em>520 U.S. 641, 117 S.Ct. 1584, 137 L.Ed.2d 906 (1997). Prior to our disposition of this appeal, another panel of this Court decided <em>Leamer v. Fauver, </em>288 F.3d 532 (3d Cir.2002), holding that <em>Balisok </em>does not require the dismissal of a prisoner\u2019s 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983 claim challenging prison conditions. <em>See Learner, </em>288 F.3d at---, slip op. at 11-17. The decision in <em>Learner </em>binds us and controls the disposition of this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b513-9\">There are no material differences for purposes of this appeal between the appellant\u2019s claims \u2014 that prison officials wrongfully disciplined him by placing him in segregated custody for one month and transferring him to a higher security prison in retaliation for exercising his First Amendment rights \u2014 and the claims in <em>Learner. </em>The appellant challenges only the conditions of his confinement, not the fact or duration thereof, and such a challenge could not have been brought by means of a habeas corpus action. The judgment of the District Court is therefore REVERSED and the case is remanded for further proceedings.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
