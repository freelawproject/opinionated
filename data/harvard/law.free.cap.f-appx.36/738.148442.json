Washington also contests the manner in which the district court calculated his sentence. For the following reasons, we affirm Washington\u2019s conviction and sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b761-5\">Prior to trial, the district court declined to suppress evidence the United States sought to introduce that was recovered during a search of Washington at an alleged crack house. Washington moved to suppress that evidence because a state court had previously suppressed the evidence, finding the search during which the evidence was discovered violated the Fourth Amendment. We review the district court\u2019s legal conclusions supporting its suppression determination de novo and the underlying factual findings for clear error. When applying these standards, we conclude that Washington\u2019s challenge is without merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b761-6\">In declining to suppress the evidence in question, the district court correctly noted that state suppression rulings are not determinative of the United States\u2019 ability to introduce that same evidence in a subsequent federal prosecution, as collateral estoppel would only apply if the United States was a party to the earlier determination in some manner. <em>United States v. Safari, </em>849 F.2d 891, <em>893 </em>(4th Cir.1988). Furthermore, we agree with the district court that, based on the facts presented at the suppression hearing, the Government was not represented at that earlier proceeding, and that the search did not violate the Fourth Amendment. <em>See United States v. Leon, </em>468 U.S. 897, 919-22, 103 S.Ct. 3535, 77 L.Ed.2d 1386 (1984); <em>Illinois v. Gates, </em>462 U.S. 213, 236, 103 S.Ct. 2317, 76 L.Ed.2d 527 (1983). Accordingly, we affirm the district court\u2019s suppression determination.</p>\n<p id=\"b761-10\">Washington\u2019s challenges to evidentiary determinations underlying various elements of his sentence, which we review for clear error, <em>see United States v. Daugh-trey, </em>874 F.2d 213, 217 (4th Cir.1989), are equally unpersuasive.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The Government presented ample evidence at trial to support the district court\u2019s determination that Washington was responsible for distributing 1.5 kilograms of cocaine base over the course of the eight-year conspiracy. Indeed, even calculating the volume of drugs involved in the manner most favorable to Washington, <em>see United States v. Sampson, </em>140 F.3d 585, 592 (4th Cir.1998), the testimony of Jeff McAllister alone is more than sufficient to support the district court\u2019s finding of a base offense level of thirty-eight predicated on Washington\u2019s responsibility for distributing 1.5 kilograms of cocaine base.</p>\n<p id=\"b761-11\">Next, Washington objects to the enhancement of his offense level for his possession of a firearm during the commission of this offense, in accordance with <em>U.S. Sentencing Guidelines Manual </em>\u00a7 2D1.1(b)(1) (2000). In applying this enhancement, the district court noted the testimony of several individuals who stated <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"740\">*740</page-number>Washington and his confederates hid several firearms in close proximity to the areas in which they distributed crack. Further, Anthony Harris testified he saw both drugs and a firearm in Washington\u2019s possession at Washington\u2019s apartment. In light of this testimony, we find no error in the district court\u2019s application of \u00a7 2D1.1(b)(1). <em>See United States v. Hough, </em>276 F.3d 884, 894-95 (6th Cir. 2002); <em>United States v. Flores, </em>149 F.3d 1272, 1280 (10th Cir.1998); <em>United States v. Harris, </em>128 F.3d 850, 852 (4th Cir.1997).</p>\n<p id=\"b762-6\">Washington\u2019s final objection relates to the district court\u2019s application of a three-level enhancement to his offense level for his supervisory role in the conspiracy pursuant to USSG \u00a7 3B1.1(b). At Washington\u2019s sentencing hearing, the district court identified at least three individuals it found to be involved in Washington\u2019s criminal activity, including Harris, whom the district court also found to have been supervised by Washington. In light of the substantial evidence supporting these findings, including Harris\u2019 testimony, we find no error in the district court\u2019s application of \u00a7 3B1.1(b).</p>\n<p id=\"b762-7\">Accordingly, we grant the parties\u2019 joint motion to correct the joint appendix and affirm Washington\u2019s conviction and sentence.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the district court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b762-8\">\n<em>AFFIRMED.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b760-16\">. Those offenses were distribution of cocaine base and marijuana, <em>see </em>21 U.S.C. \u00a7 841(a)(1) 0994), distribution of cocaine base and marijuana within 1000 feet of a school or public <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"739\">*739</page-number>housing, <em>see 21 </em>U.S.C. \u00a7 860(a) (1994), distribution of cocaine base and marijuana to a minor, <em>see 21 </em>U.S.C.A. \u00a7 859 (West 1999), and employment of a minor in distributing cocaine base and marijuana, <em>see 21 </em>U.S.C.A. \u00a7 861(a) (West 1999).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b761-8\">. Washington does not challenge the district court\u2019s adoption of the recommendation in Washington\u2019s presentence report to apply a two-level enhancement for distributing in a protected area under USSG \u00a7 2D 1.2(a)(1) (supported by Washington\u2019s conviction under \u00a7 860 <em>(see </em>\u00a7 2D 1.2, comment, (n.1))), and a two-level enhancement for distributing to a minor under \u00a7 2D 1.2(a)(1) (supported by Washington\u2019s conviction under \u00a7 859, and cumulatively imposed pursuant to USSG \u00a7 1B 1.1, comment, (n.4)).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b762-10\">. We note Washington\u2019s judgment and commitment order incorrectly states his total offense level is thirty-eight, rather than forty-seven as established by the district court at sentencing. Because the judgment and commitment order nevertheless accurately reflects the life sentence pronounced by the district court at sentencing, we find no plain error in this discrepancy. <em>See United States v. Olano, </em>507 U.S. 725, 731-32, 113 S.Ct. 1770, 123 L.Ed.2d 508 (1993); <em>see also United States v. Daddino, </em>5 F.3d 262, 266 n. 5 (7th Cir. 1993).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
