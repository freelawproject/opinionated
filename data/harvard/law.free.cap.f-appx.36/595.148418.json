A prosecutor\u2019s decision as to when to dismiss charges is entitled to absolute prosecutorial immunity because it is \u201cintimately associated with the judicial phase of the criminal process\u201d<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> and involves the prosecutor\u2019s \u201crole as advocate for the State.\u201d<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Thus, Goss had no chance of prevailing on his claim that Sewell should have dismissed the charges sooner, and the district court properly denied Goss\u2019s motion to amend.</p>\n<p id=\"b618-21\">The district court properly granted summary judgment to the individual defendants Hood River County and Hood River County Sheriffs Department on qualified immunity grounds. Ms. Goss\u2019s serious injuries, history of abuse by Goss, and statements to police would lead a reasonable officer to find probable cause to arrest Goss for burglary, assault, and rape.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Goss\u2019s contention that the district court impermissibly weighed evidence at the summary judgment stage lacks merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b618-22\">Finally, Goss has presented no legal argument that the district court abused its discretion by denying his motion to strike <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"597\">*597</page-number>certain evidence. We therefore do not consider this contention.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b619-5\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b618-15\"> The Honorable John S.
