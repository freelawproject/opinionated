He claims that his encounter with the police constituted a seizure for purposes of the Fourth Amendment that was unsupported by reasonable suspicion and exceeded the scope of the apartment tenant\u2019s consent to search the apartment in which Anderson was present. We have reviewed the record and the district court\u2019s opinion and find no reversible error. Accordingly, we affirm on the reasoning of the district court. <em>See United States v. Anderson, </em>No. CR-01-95 (M.D.N.C. June 20 and November 19, 2001) . We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b536-23\">\n<em>AFFIRMED.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
