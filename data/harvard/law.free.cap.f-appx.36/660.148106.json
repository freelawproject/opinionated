Arroyo was convicted after a jury trial in state court of three counts of criminal sale of a controlled substance in the first degree, in violation of N.Y. Penal Law \u00a7 220.43(1), and criminal possession of a controlled substance in the third degree, in violation of N.Y. Penal Law \u00a7 220.16(1). He was sentenced to indeterminate concurrent terms of imprisonment of twenty-five years to life, twenty years to life, fifteen years to life, and five to fifteen years for each of his respective counts.</p>\n<p id=\"b683-17\">The only ground upon which petitioner challenges his conviction is the closure of the courtroom during the testimony of one of the government\u2019s witnesses, a backup undercover officer designated # 25569 (\u201cUC 25569\u201d), who described two of the three transactions that led to Arroyo\u2019s arrest. Another undercover officer (\u201cUC 10553\u201d) was the primary officer in the operation and conducted all three transactions upon which petitioner\u2019s conviction is based. UC 25569\u2019s role during the transactions was limited to tasting the drugs at UC 10553\u2019s direction; carrying the drugs <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"662\">*662</page-number>to the car and getting the money from the car at UC 10553\u2019s instruction; overhearing an incriminating statement about appellant; signaling the backup team to move in for the arrest; and identifying petitioner after his arrest. Each of the transactions was monitored and/or recorded by other field officers by use of video or audio equipment.</p>\n<p id=\"b684-4\">The State moved for the closure of the courtroom during UC 25569\u2019s testimony. At the closure hearing, the officer testified that he planned to return to undercover work in the Queens Narcotics Division after his recovery from a knee surgery. He stated that he had eleven pending cases in which the target had been arrested but had not yet pled or been tried; twenty to thirty buys for which the targets had not been arrested; and about one to two cases in which he was trying to instigate a buy operation. When asked about his fear of testifying in an open courtroom, the officer replied \u201c[b]ecause my safety might be in danger\u201d without further elaboration. Although the trial court closed the courtroom, it did not articulate any findings on the record. A transcript of UC 25569\u2019s testimony was made available to the public and UC 10553 and other field team members testified in open court. The tapes of two of the drug transactions were also played in open court.</p>\n<p id=\"b684-5\">Under the familiar <em>Waller </em>test, a courtroom closure is justified only if the following four requirements are met: (1) the proponent of closure advances an \u201coverriding interest\u201d likely to be prejudiced; (2) the closure is no broader than necessary; (3) the trial court considers reasonable alternatives to closure; and (4) the trial court makes findings adequate to support closure. <em>See Waller v. Georgia, </em>467 U.S. 39, 48, 104 S.Ct. 2210, 81 L.Ed.2d 31 (1984). Appellant challenges the closure because, <em>inter alia, </em>(1) the officer\u2019s testimony did not establish an adequate basis for closure due to his safety concerns and thus failed to satisfy the first <em>Waller </em>requirement and (2) the state court failed to make findings on the record to support the closure and thus did not satisfy the fourth <em>Waller </em>requirement.</p>\n<p id=\"b684-7\">We review a district court\u2019s decision to deny a habeas petition <em>de novo. See Bobb v. Senkowski </em>196 F.3d 350, 352 (2d Cir. 1999) (per curiam). The state court\u2019s determination will not be disturbed unless it is contrary to, or an unreasonable application of, clearly established federal law. 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254(d)(1).</p>\n<p id=\"b684-8\">The extent of the closure permitted depends on the gravity of the interest that must be asserted and the degree of risk of that interest being prejudiced. <em>See Ayala v. Speckard, </em>131 F.3d 62, 70 (2d Cir.1997) (en banc); <em>United States v. Doe, </em>63 F.3d 121, 129 (2d Cir.1995). Where the closure is limited and the witness\u2019s testimony is merely corroborative, the State\u2019s burden is \u201cnot a heavy one.\u201d <em>Brown v. Kuhlmann, </em>142 F.3d 529, 538 (2d Cir.1998). In justifying a courtroom closure in a case similar to this one, we have stated it is \u201csufficient for the state court to have before it testimony that the officer continued to work as an undercover officer ..., that there were several \u2018lost subjects\u2019 still at large from his recent investigations, and that he feared for his safety if he were to testify in public.\u201d <em>Bobb, </em>196 F.3d at 354; <em>see also Bowden v. Keane, </em>237 F.3d 125, 130 (2d Cir. 2001) (stating that justifying fear in \u201crough terms\u201d is sufficient to satisfy the first <em>Waller </em>requirement). As noted above, UC 25569 testified to each of these factors at the closure hearing.</p>\n<p id=\"b684-9\">We reject petitioner\u2019s argument that this case is distinguishable from <em>Bobb </em>because UC 25569 was an \u201cintegral\u201d member of the team, participated in two of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"663\">*663</page-number>transactions, and handled the drugs and money at the direction of the primary officer. The officer in <em>Bobb </em>testified to three out of seven transactions, <em>see Bobb, </em>196 F.3d at 353, and we do not find that UC 25569 testified to any relevant facts that were not also established by the audiotapes played in open court or the testimony of the other officers. Thus his testimony, like the testimony of the officer in <em>Bobb, </em>was merely corroborative. Therefore, we affirm the district court\u2019s finding that the closure of the court was not an \u201cobjectively unreasonable\u201d application of the first <em>Waller </em>requirement. <em>See Francis v. Stone, </em>221 F.3d 100, 109 (2d Cir.2000).</p>\n<p id=\"b685-5\">Finally, we note that the trial court did not comply with the clear requirement of the fourth <em>Waller </em>factor by failing to state on the record its findings that supported the courtroom closure. However, appellant did not raise this objection below in the district court and therefore has forfeited this issue on appeal. <em>See United States v. Triestman, 178 </em>F.3d 624, 632-33 (2d Cir.1999).</p>\n<p id=\"b685-6\">We have carefully considered Arroyo\u2019s remaining arguments regarding the other elements of the <em>Waller </em>test and find them to lack merit. For the reasons set forth above, the judgment of the district court is hereby AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
