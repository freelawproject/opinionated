The district court did not abuse its discretion in denying Smart\u2019s requests for reconsideration, which it treated as motions for reconsideration under Local Rule 7.16. \u201cOnly in rare cases will we question the exercise of discretion in connection with the application of local rules.\u201d <em>United States v.
