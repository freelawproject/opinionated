Handy asserts he received ineffective assistance of counsel at trial. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b548-20\">Claims of ineffective assistance of counsel are generally not cognizable on direct appeal. To allow for adequate development of a record, a defendant generally must bring such a claim in a 28 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 2255 (West Supp.2001) motion unless the record conclusively establishes ineffective assistance. <em>United States v. Richardson, </em>195 F.3d 192, 198 (4th Cir.1999). Here, the record does not conclusively establish that Handy\u2019s counsel was ineffective. We therefore affirm Handy\u2019s conviction and sentence without prejudice to Handy\u2019s ability to assert his ineffective assistance of counsel claims in a 28 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 2255 (West Supp.2001) motion. <em>United States v. King, </em>119 F.3d 290, 295 (4th Cir.1997).</p>\n<p id=\"b548-21\">Accordingly, we affirm Handy\u2019s conviction and sentence. We dispense with oral argument, because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b548-22\">\n<em>AFFIRMED.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
