Shadur, Senior District Judge for the Northern District of Illinois, sitting by designation.</p>\n</footnote>\n<opinion data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"majority\">\n<p id=\"b314-4\">MEMORANDUM <footnotemark>**</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b314-5\">George Davis (\u201cDavis\u201d) appeals the judgment of the district court upholding the denial by the Commissioner of Social Security (\u201cCommissioner\u201d) of Davis\u2019 application for disability insurance benefits under both the Social Security and Supplemental Security Income programs pursuant to Titles II and XVI of the Social Security Act, 42 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 401-434 and 1381-1383f. Davis contends that Commissioner\u2019s decision was not supported by substantial evidence and was not based on a proper application of legal standards.</p>\n<p id=\"b314-6\">We review the district court\u2019s grant of summary judgment de novo, and in doing so we uphold Commissioner\u2019s decision if it is supported by substantial evidence and free of legal error <em>(Meanel v. Apfel, </em>172 F.3d 1111, 1113 (9th Cir.1999)). Because substantial evidence does support the conclusion that Davis was not disabled and because the decision by the Administrative Law Judge (\u201cALJ\u201d) was indeed free of legal error, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b314-7\">Contrary to Davis\u2019 contention, Social Security Ruling 83-12 does not compel the conclusion that he is disabled because of the erosion of his occupational base. All that was required of the ALJ was that he consult with a vocational expert (\u201cVE\u201d) to determine whether someone with Davis\u2019 limitations could perform substantial gainful work in the economy <em>(Moore v. Apfel, </em>216 F.3d 864, 870-71 (9th Cir.2000); accord, <em>Thomas v. Barnhart, </em>278 F.3d 947, 960 (9th Cir.2002)). That is exactly what the ALJ did, and the VE\u2019s testimony that Davis was capable of performing millions of medium-level jobs existing in the national economy provides substantial evidence supporting the ALJ\u2019s decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b314-11\">Further, the ALJ properly buttressed his finding that Davis\u2019 testimony was not credible (1) by identifying Davis\u2019 statements \u201cconcerning his impairments and their impact on his ability to work\u201d as the specific testimony being discredited (ER 83) and (2) by pointing to specific evidence that raised a question about Davis\u2019 accuracy in describing his own symptoms, including treatment reports describing Davis as a \u201cpoor historian\u201d and stating that his \u201csubjective complaints outweigh objective findings\u201d (ER 81). Thus the ALJ complied precisely with the requirement that he identify the testimony being discredited and the evidence undermining it <em>(see, e.g., Lester v. Chater, </em>81 F.3d 821, 834 (9th Cir.1995); <em>Dodrill v. Shalala, </em>12 F.3d 915, 918 (9th Cir.1993)).</p>\n<p id=\"b314-12\">Finally, the ALJ satisfied his duty, as set forth in the caselaw sought to be relied on by Davis <em>(Vidal v. Harris, </em>637 F.2d 710, 713 (9th Cir.1981), quoting <em>Cox v. Califa-no, </em>587 F.2d 988, 991 (9th Cir.1978)), to develop the record for unrepresented claimant Davis fully and fairly. First, Davis\u2019 argument that the ALJ had an independent duty to investigate whether Davis met the listing requirement for \u201cmental retardation\u201d is not supported by the record. Second, the ALJ\u2019s examination of the VE was adequate and accurately reflected Davis\u2019 limitations. <em>Vidal\u2019s </em>facts are not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"291\">*291</page-number>analogous and do not support Davis\u2019 position (687 F.2d at 712-15).</p>\n<p id=\"b315-5\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b314-13\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and may not be cited to or by the courts of this circuit except as may be provided by Ninth Circuit Rule 36-3.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
