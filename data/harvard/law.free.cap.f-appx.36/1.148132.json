Artuz, </em>113 F.Supp.2d 327 (E.D.N.Y.2000). In 1993, Ortiz was convicted, after jury trial, of Murder in the Second Degree and Criminal Possession of a Weapon, arising out of a 1991 drive-by shooting of a seventeen year old boy. The trial court admitted into evidence the unredacted statement of Ortiz\u2019s non-testifying, co-defendant, Danny Torres, in violation of <em>Cruz v. New York, </em>481 U.S. 186, 193, 107 S.Ct. 1714, 95 L.Ed.2d 162 (1987) and the Confrontation Clause of the Sixth Amendment.</p>\n<p id=\"b32-12\">After exhausting his state court appeals, Ortiz filed a federal petition for habeas relief, raising, <em>inter alia, </em>the <em>Cruz </em>error. The district court held the error harmless. On appeal, the only issue is the propriety of that ruling. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b32-14\">\u201cWhere a nontestifying codefendant\u2019s confession facially incriminating the defendant is not directly admissible against the defendant, the Confrontation Clause bars its admission at their joint trial, even if the jury' is instructed not to consider it against the defendant, and even if the defendant\u2019s own confession is admitted against him.\u201d <em>Cruz, </em>481 U.S. at 186, 107 S.Ct. 1714. However, <em>Cruz </em>violations are subject to harmless error analysis. <em>See Samuels v. Mann, </em>13 F.3d 522, 526 (2d Cir.1993). To succeed, therefore, a habeas petitioner must demonstrate actual prejudice. <em>Brecht v. Abrahamson, </em>507 U.S. 619, 637, 113 S.Ct. 1710, 123 L.Ed.2d 353 (1993).</p>\n<p id=\"b32-15\">Ortiz fails to show prejudice because Torres\u2019 statement was substantially similar to a properly-admitted statement Ortiz made to the police. The accounts are parallel in crucial points and particulars. Both place Ortiz in the driver\u2019s seat and the gun in the hand of a third party, named Jose, seated in the backseat. There are inconsistencies, but in the main the inconsistencies concern incidental matters (such as the car\u2019s ultimate destination after the shooting) and would not unduly lead a jury to infer that either defendant was a liar, or both.</p>\n<p id=\"b32-16\">Still, the crucial issue is intent, and on that score, Torres\u2019 statement is marginally more damaging to Ortiz. For instance, Torres details both Jose\u2019s instruction to Ortiz to \u201cslow down\u201d and Ortiz\u2019s compliance. Significantly, however, Torres was convicted of murder by the same jury even though neither account details any action on his part indicative of intent: unlike Ortiz, who acts as driver in both versions, Torres passively sits in the front passenger seat.</p>\n<p id=\"b33-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"3\">*3</page-number>Ortiz makes much of the arguably suspect testimony of the government\u2019s key witness, Karina Veliz. Initially, Veliz denied knowledge of the car\u2019s occupants. Subsequently, she named Ortiz as the shooter and Torres as the driver. Ortiz adequately demonstrates that Veliz had a motive to lie. However, the credibility of Veliz is a question that bears chiefly on sufficiency of evidence. While we recognize that \u201cthe weight of the prosecution\u2019s case\u201d is the most significant factor in determining whether a <em>Cruz </em>error is harmless, our evaluation of weight requires us to consider only the diminution of the body of evidence once the <em>Cruz </em>error is \u201cstripped\u201d away. <em>Samuels, </em>13 F.3d at 526-27. Because Torres\u2019s statement was largely cumulative, the government\u2019s case would have been as \u201cstrong\u201d with or without it.</p>\n<p id=\"b33-5\">Ortiz counters that without the Torres statement, the government would have been left with a \u201che said/she said contest\u201d between Ortiz and Velez. If anything, however, the Torres statement tended to reinforce Ortiz\u2019s own version, which identified Ortiz as the driver, and thus belied Veliz\u2019s account, which cast Ortiz as the shooter. One may suppose that that is the reason Ortiz did not object to the admission of the Torres statement at trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b33-6\">For the reasons set forth above, the judgment of the district court is AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
