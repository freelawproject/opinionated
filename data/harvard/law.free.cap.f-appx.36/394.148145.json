R.App. P. 34(a)(2); 10th Cir. R. 34.1(G). The case is therefore ordered submitted without oral argument.</p>\n<p id=\"b418-15\">Appellant Brian Dale Dubuc, an Oklahoma state prisoner, appeals the district court\u2019s dismissal of the civil rights complaint he brought pursuant to 42 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1983 and 1985(3). The district court denied Dubuc\u2019s motion to proceed <em>in for-ma pauperis </em>(ifp), concluding that Dubuc was barred from proceeding <em>ifp </em>because he has previously filed three or more civil actions <em>ifp </em>which were dismissed as frivolous, malicious, or for failure to state a valid claim. <em>See </em>28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(g). The court addressed and rejected Dubuc\u2019s arguments that 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(g) is unconstitutional and that he is in \u201cimminent danger of serious physical injury.\u201d 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(g) (providing an exception to the \u00a7 1915(g) bar). The court then <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"395\">*395</page-number>dismissed Dubuc\u2019s complaint without prejudice for failure to pay the filing fee. Du-buc brought this appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b419-5\">Dubuc has filed a motion to proceed <em>ifp </em>on appeal together with an appellate brief. In his brief, Dubuc does not contest the district court\u2019s conclusion that he has three strikes but, instead, renews his argument that 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(g) is unconstitutional and also argues that the district court erred when it concluded that he had not demonstrated that he is under imminent danger of serious physical injury. After a review of Dubuc\u2019s appellate brief, the appellate record, and the applicable law, we agree with the district court\u2019s conclusion that Dubuc\u2019s challenge to the constitutionality of 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(g) is foreclosed by Tenth Circuit precedent. <em>See White v. Colorado, </em>157 F.3d 1226, 1232 (10th Cir. 1998); <em>see also Kinnell v. Graves, </em>265 F.3d 1125, 1127-28 (10th Cir.2001). We also agree that Dubuc has failed to identify any facts suggesting that he is in \u201cimminent danger of serious physical injury.\u201d 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(g). Accordingly, because Dubuc does not contest the district court\u2019s conclusion that he has three prior strikes, Dubuc\u2019s motion to proceed <em>ifp </em>on appeal is denied and this appeal is dismissed for failure to pay the appellate filing fee.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b418-7\"> This order and judgment is not binding precedent, except under the doctrines of law of the case, res judicata, and collateral estoppel. The court generally disfavors the citation of orders and judgments; nevertheless, an order and judgment may be cited under the terms and conditions of 10th Cir. R. 36.3.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
