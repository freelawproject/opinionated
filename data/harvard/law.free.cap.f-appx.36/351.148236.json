His primary allegation is that his incarceration in a privately run correctional facility violates state law. The district court dismissed the complaint sua sponte, and we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b376-11\">Quintana, who has at all times in this litigation proceeded pro se and in forma pauperis, alleges that various state officials violated N.M. Stat. Ann. \u00a7 31-20-2 by housing state prisoners in privately run county correctional facilities. According to the complaint, \u00a7 31-20-2 creates a liberty interest subject to due process protection under the Fourteenth Amendment. Quin-tana further alleges that the State retaliated against his litigation \u201cby taking all law libraries in the State.\u201d (R. Doc. 1 Attach, at 3.) Specifically, he claims:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b376-14\">The State no longer provides case law forms or typewriters for the petitioners] to research and prepare his responses. The state has not provided anyone to advise petitioner, such as a lawyer or paralegal. [The correctional facility], by order of the State, is now censoring all mail, which is a violation of the First Amendment of the Constitution of the United States.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b376-15\"><em>(Id.) </em>The district court dismissed all of Quintana\u2019s claims sua sponte pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(e)(2) and Fed.R.Civ.P. 12(b)(6). On appeal, Quintana does not take issue with the district court\u2019s dismissal of his retaliation claim. Regarding the remainder of the complaint, Quintana argues that dismissal without allowing him to amend was in error.</p>\n<p id=\"b376-16\">We review the district court\u2019s dismissal under the standards stated in <em>Curley v. Perry, </em>246 F.3d 1278 (10th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. \u2014, 122 S.Ct. 274, 151 L.Ed.2d 201 (2001):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b376-18\">We review de novo the district court\u2019s decision to dismiss a complaint under \u00a7 1915(d)(2) for failure to state a claim. We must accept the allegations of the complaint as true and view them in the light most favorable to the plaintiff. We further construe a pro se complaint liberally. Dismissal of a pro se complaint for failure to state a claim is proper only where it is obvious that the plaintiff cannot prevail on the facts he has al<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"353\">*353</page-number>leged and it would be futile to give him an opportunity to amend. Similarly, dismissal under Rule 12(b)(6) without affording plaintiff notice or an opportunity to amend is proper only when it is patently obvious that the plaintiff could not prevail on the facts alleged, and allowing him an opportunity to amend his complaint would be futile.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b377-5\"><em>Id. </em>at 1281-82 (quotations and citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b377-6\">Title 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983 provides a remedy for deprivations of <em>federal </em>constitutional or statutory rights. Incarceration in a privately run county correctional facility does not ipso facto violate federal constitutional or statutory law. <em>See Montez v. McKinna, </em>208 F.3d 862, 866 (10th Cir. 2000) (\u201cMoreover, there is no federal constitutional right to incarceration in. any particular prison or portion of a prison.\u201d). Quintana does allege, however, that a state statute, N.M. Stat. Ann. \u00a7 31-20-2, creates a liberty interest that has been taken in violation of the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment. The Supreme Court has recognized that \u201cStates may under certain circumstances create liberty interests which are protected by the Due Process Clause.\u201d <em>Sandin v. Conner, </em>515 U.S. 472, 483-84, 115 S.Ct. 2293, 132 L.Ed.2d 418 (1995).</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b377-7\">But these interests will be generally limited to freedom from restraint which, while not exceeding the sentence in such an unexpected manner as to give rise to protection by the Due Process Clause of its own force, nonetheless imposes atypical and significant hardship on the inmate in relation to the ordinary incidents of prison life.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b377-8\"><em>Id. </em>at 484, 115 S.Ct. 2293 (citations omitted). Quintana\u2019s incarceration in a privately run county correctional facility is not an \u201catypical and significant hardship\u201d on him and thus does not rise to the level of a federal due process violation.</p>\n<p id=\"b377-10\">We therefore conclude that the district court did not err in dismissing Quintana\u2019s complaint. We also conclude that affording Quintana an opportunity to amend his complaint would have been futile.</p>\n<p id=\"b377-11\">The judgment is AFFIRMED. The mandate shall issue forthwith.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b376-12\">The case is unanimously ordered submitted without oral argument pursuant to Fed. R.App. P. 34(a)(2) and 10th Cir. R. 34.1(G). This order and judgment is not binding precedent, except under the doctrines of law of the ease, res judicata, and collateral estoppel. The Court generally disfavors the citation of orders and judgments; nevertheless, an order and judgment may be cited under the terms and conditions of 10th Cir. R. 36.3.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
