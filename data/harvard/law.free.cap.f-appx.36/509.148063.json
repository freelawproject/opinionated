He contends the jury verdict is not supported by sufficient evidence and also asserts that the district court gave insufficient jury instructions defining \u201cpossession\u201d under the statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b534-10\">To determine whether there was sufficient evidence to support a conviction, this Court considers whether, taking the evidence in the light most favorable to the government, any reasonable trier of fact could have found the defendant guilty beyond a reasonable doubt. <em>Glasser v. United States, </em>315 U.S. 60, 80, 62 S.Ct. 457, 86 L.Ed. 680 (1942). This Court does not weigh the evidence or determine the credibility of witnesses. Rather, the jury verdict must be upheld if there is substantial evidence to support the verdict. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b534-11\">Rice contends the statute requires that the possession of the firearm have present or imminent interstate impact, however, there is no such requirement. Evidence showing that the gun traveled in interstate commerce is sufficient to support a conviction. <em>See United States v. Gallimore, </em>247 F.3d 134, 138 (4th Cir.2001). Therefore, Rice\u2019s stipulation at trial that the gun had traveled in interstate commerce satisfies this element.</p>\n<p id=\"b534-13\">As Rice did not timely object to the proposed jury instructions, this court reviews the district court\u2019s instructions for plain error. <em>See </em>Fed. R.Crim. Pro. 52(b); <em>United States v. McCaskill, </em>676 F.2d 995, 1001 (4th Cir.1982). Rice argues that the jury instruction defining \u201cpossession\u201d under the statute was confusing and lessened the Government\u2019s burden of proof. According to Rice, the district court failed to caution the jury against convicting Rice based on his close proximity to the firearm. However, the court\u2019s instructions properly defined possession as either actual possession or the power and intention to exercise control over the firearm. <em>United States v. Jackson, </em>124 F.3d 607, 610-11 (4th Cir.1997). The instruction does not leave room for the confusion that Rice complains of because the language specifically requires more than mere proximity to the firearm.</p>\n<p id=\"b534-14\">Rice\u2019s conviction was supported by sufficient evidence and the trial court properly instructed the jury regarding possession of a firearm. Accordingly, we affirm Rice\u2019s conviction and sentence. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b534-15\">\n<em>AFFIRMED.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
