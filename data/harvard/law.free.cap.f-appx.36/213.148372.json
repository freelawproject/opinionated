Hutchins sued to recover benefits under a long-term disability (\u201cLTD\u201d) plan governed by the Employee Retirement Income Security Act (\u201cERISA\u201d). <em>See </em>29 U.S.C. \u00a7 1132(a)(1)(B). The district court granted summary judgment for the defendants, Hutchins\u2019s former employer and plan administrator A.O. Smith Corporation and plan trustee CTC Illinois Trust Company (\u201cCTC\u201d), concluding that the denial of LTD benefits was not arbitrary or capricious. Hutchins appeals, arguing that A.O. Smith incorrectly interpreted the medical opinions of his surgeon, Dr. Mark M. Benson. We vacate the grant of summary judgment and remand the case for reconsideration in light of recent developments involving Dr. Benson\u2019s medical license.</p>\n<p id=\"b243-21\">After the removal of his tumor, Hutchins applied for LTD benefits from A.O. Smith. During the application process Dr. Benson gave three opinions regarding Hutchins\u2019s ability to work. First, in December 1997 Dr. Benson stated that he did not feel that Hutchins was totally disabled. Based on Dr. Benson\u2019s opinion, the A.O. Smith Retirement Committee (\u201cCommittee\u201d) denied Hutchins\u2019s request for LTD benefits. Dr. Benson\u2019s second opinion came in May 1998 when Hutchins appealed the denial to the Committee. Dr. Benson stated that Hutchins \u201cis disabled from doing any type of functional work because of his pain.\u201d The following month Dr. Benson clarified his opinion in a telephone conversation with the A.O. Smith Corporate Medical Director, Dr. William Longe, stating that although he could not deny Hutchins\u2019s feelings of pain, Hutchins could return to work with restrictions on lifting, bending, stooping, pushing, and pulling. In light of Dr. Benson\u2019s clarification, the Committee <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"214\">*214</page-number>again denied Hutchins\u2019s request for LTD benefits.</p>\n<p id=\"b244-4\">Dr. Benson rendered each of the opinions while his license to practice medicine was under a cloud; that is, under a stayed suspension by the State of Wisconsin Medical Examining Board. Neither the plan administrator nor the district court knew of Dr. Benson\u2019s licensing problems. We asked the parties to respond to this newly discovered public information and to explain why we should not remand the case for reconsideration. After reviewing the responses, we conclude that a remand is necessary to allow the district court to determine whether Dr. Benson\u2019s licensing problems affect the outcome of this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b244-5\">VACATED AND REMANDED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
