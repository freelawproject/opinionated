In sentencing Braun to 24 months imprisonment, the statutory maximum authorized under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3583(e)(3) based on Braun\u2019s underlying offenses, the court noted that Braun was not amenable to supervised release and a maximum sentence was necessary for the safety of the community. Upon careful review of the record, we conclude the district court did not abuse its discretion in imposing a sentence above the suggested Guidelines range. <em>See </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7 7B1.4 (range of imprisonment available upon revocation); <em>United States v. Shaw, </em>180 F.3d 920, 922 (8th Cir.1999) (per curiam) (Chapter 7 Guidelines are advisory and nonbinding). Braun\u2019s revocation prison sentence did not exceed the maximum prison term authorized under section 3583(e)(3), and the court\u2019s stated reasons for imposing the 24-month term reflect consideration of the factors set forth in 18 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 3553 and 3583. <em>See United States v. Grimes, </em>54 F.3d 489, 492 (8th Cir.1995) (revocation sentence reviewed for abuse of discretion).</p>\n<p id=\"b594-21\">Braun\u2019s other arguments are without merit. Accordingly, we affirm, grant counsel\u2019s motion to withdraw, and deny all other pending motions.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b594-18\">. TL honorable Nanette K.
