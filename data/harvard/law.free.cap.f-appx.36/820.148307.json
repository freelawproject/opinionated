Smith appeals the district court\u2019s order sentencing him to restitution in the amount of $4,759,319 for fraudulently wire-transferring clients\u2019 funds into his personal brokerage account. He claims that restitution is improper because he is unable to pay. The United States argues that restitution is not only proper, but mandatory under the Mandatory Victims Restitution Act of 1996 (\u201cMVRA\u201d), 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3663A.</p>\n<p id=\"b842-23\">It appears that one of the victims of the fraud was the district judge\u2019s secretary. We requested letter briefing from the parties on whether recusal of the district judge was required in this case. We now vacate the sentence and remand to the district court for consideration of the recu-sal issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b842-24\">Recusal of federal judges is governed by 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 455. In relevant part it reads:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b842-25\">Any justice, judge, or magistrate [magistrate judge] of the United States shall disqualify himself in any proceeding in which his impartiality might reasonably be questioned.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b842-26\">28 U.S.C. \u00a7 455(a). The statute is self-executing. The judge must recuse himself, even in the absence of a party complaint, if \u201ca reasonable person with knowledge of all the facts would conclude that the judge\u2019s impartiality might reasonably be questioned.\u201d <em>United States v. Story, </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"821\">*821</page-number>716 F.2d 1088, 1091 (6th Cir.1983) (quoting <em>Trotter v. Int\u2019l Longshoremen\u2019s &amp; Warehousemen\u2019s Union, </em>704 F.2d 1141, 1144 (9th Cir.1983)).</p>\n<p id=\"b843-5\">Recusal under \u00a7 455(a) may be waived by the parties. Section 455(e) permits a judge to accept waiver \u201cprovided it is preceded by a full disclosure on the record of the basis for disqualification.\u201d 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 455(e).</p>\n<p id=\"b843-6\">The presentence report indicates that the district judge\u2019s secretary was a victim. Beyond that fact, the record is insufficiently developed for us to determine whether the parties were offered full disclosure on the record of the basis for disqualification, and whether the parties waived the recusal requirement. Under such circumstances, we find the best course of action is to vacate the sentence and remand to the district judge to conduct \u201ca hearing in which there is \u2018full disclosure on the record of the basis for disqualification\u2019\u201d and to \u201cconsider the waiver and recusal issues.\u201d <em>Barksdale v. Emerick, </em>853 F.2d 1359, 1361-62 (6th Cir.1988); <em>see also Easley v. Univ. of Mich. Bd. of Regents, </em>853 F.2d 1351, 1352 (6th Cir.1988).</p>\n<p id=\"b843-7\">VACATED and REMANDED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
