R.App. P. 34(a)(2); 10th Cir. R. 34.1(G). The case is therefore ordered submitted without oral argument.</p>\n<p id=\"b965-28\">Petitioner Majeed Ahmed appeals from the district court\u2019s order denying and dismissing with prejudice his 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2241 petition for a writ of habeas corpus. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"944\">*944</page-number>We review the denial of his \u00a7 2241 petition <em>de novo. Hunnicutt v. Hawk, </em>229 F.3d 997, 1000 (10th Cir.2000).</p>\n<p id=\"b966-4\">Ahmed\u2019s first issue concerns whether the United States Parole Commission had lost jurisdiction to revoke his parole by the time he was extradited from Pakistan. After extradition, but before his parole was revoked, Ahmed filed a separate \u00a7 2241 proceeding in the Eastern District of New York. He did not raise this issue in the prior proceeding, although he could have done so. The magistrate judge opined that this issue was \u201cprobably subject to dismissal as an abuse of the writ,\u201d Aplt.App., Vol. III at 436, but nevertheless reached the issue on the merits \u201cin the interest of justice.\u201d <em>Id.</em><footnotemark><em>1</em></footnotemark><em> </em>The district court adopted the magistrate judge\u2019s recommendation.</p>\n<p id=\"b966-5\">We review <em>de novo </em>the question of whether an issue raised in a habeas petition is successive or abusive. <em>See United States v. Orozco-Ramirez, </em>211 F.3d 862, 865 (5th Cir.2000). Our <em>de novo </em>review convinces us that Ahmed\u2019s presentation of this issue represents an abuse of the writ. We therefore affirm the dismissal with prejudice of this claim, albeit as an abuse of the writ, a different ground than that relied upon by the district court.</p>\n<p id=\"b966-8\">The remainder of Ahmed\u2019s claims are properly before us on the merits, because they concern challenges to the revocation of his parole that could not have been brought in the prior \u00a7 2241 proceeding. Our <em>de novo </em>review, however, reveals that the district court properly denied Ahmed\u2019s petition. The judgment of the United States District Court for the District of Colorado is therefore AFFIRMED for substantially the same reasons stated in the well-reasoned report and recommendation of the United States Magistrate Judge, dated March 3, 1999, and the district court\u2019s order adopting that recommendation, dated January 18, 2001.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b965-29\"> This order and judgment is not binding precedent, except under the doctrines of law of the case, res judicata, and collateral estoppel. The court generally disfavors the citation of orders and judgments; nevertheless, an order and judgment may be cited under the terms and conditions of 10th Cir. R. 36.3.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b966-6\">. The \"interests of justice\u201d exception was removed from 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2244(a) by the 1996 AEDPA revision to that statute and is not applicable to this case.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
