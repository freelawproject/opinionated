Claiborne, Jr., appeals his convictions and sentences for conspiracy to distribute cocaine base and heroin; five counts of possession with intent to distribute cocaine base; distribution of heroin; murder in aid of racketeering activity; use and carry of a firearm during a crime of violence; and murder during a crime of drug trafficking. He asserts on appeal that (1) the district court abused its discretion in denying his motion for a mistrial; (2) there was insufficient evidence to support the jury\u2019s findings regarding drug quantity; (3) there was insufficient evidence to support his convictions for murder in aid of racketeering and murder during a crime of drug trafficking; and (4) the Government presented insufficient evidence of an effect on interstate commerce to invoke federal jurisdiction. Finding no merit to Claiborne\u2019s claims, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b103-20\">First, as to the prosecutor\u2019s comments during closing arguments concerning Claiborne\u2019s failure to testify, we conclude that the district court did not abuse its discretion in denying Claiborne\u2019s motion for a mistrial on this basis. Even assuming the prosecutor\u2019s remarks constituted a direct comment on Claiborne\u2019s failure to testify, <em>see United States v. Whitehead, </em>618 F.2d 523, 527 (4th Cir.1980), we conclude that they did not affect Claiborne\u2019s substantial rights. <em>See United States v. Harrison, </em>716 F.2d 1050, 1052 (4th Cir.1983).</p>\n<p id=\"b103-21\">We also find that sufficient evidence supported the jury\u2019s findings regarding drug quantity as well as Claiborne\u2019s convictions for murder in aid of racketeering activity and murder during a crime of drug trafficking. A reviewing court must uphold a jury\u2019s verdict if there is substantial evidence to support it. <em>Glasser v. United States, </em>315 U.S. 60, 80, 62 S.Ct. 457, 86 L.Ed. 680 (1942). We have reviewed the record and are satisfied that substantial evidence supports each of the jury\u2019s findings.</p>\n<p id=\"b103-22\">Finally, we hold that the Government presented sufficient evidence of an effect on interstate commerce to support Claiborne\u2019s conviction for murder in aid of racketeering activity under 18 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 1959 (West 2000). The Government <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"74\">*74</page-number>need only show that the enterprise\u2019s activities had a de minimis effect on interstate commerce. The Government met this standard in this case by presenting the jury with evidence of the presence of crack cocaine and heroin in the Commonwealth of Virginia along with evidence that the plants required to produce these drugs do not grow in Virginia. <em>See United States v. Gray, </em>137 F.3d 765, 772-73 (4th Cir.1998). We note that the Government was not required to prove an effect on interstate commerce to obtain a conviction on the remaining counts.</p>\n<p id=\"b104-4\">Accordingly, we affirm Claiborne\u2019s convictions and sentences. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b104-5\">\n<em>AFFIRMED.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
