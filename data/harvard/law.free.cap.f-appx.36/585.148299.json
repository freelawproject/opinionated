O\u2019Connor appeals the 7-month sentence imposed following the revocation of his supervised release, subsequent to his underlying sentence of 12-months imposed following a conviction for transporting illegal aliens in violation of 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1324. We have jurisdiction pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291, and we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b607-23\">O\u2019Connor contends that 1) the district court faded to consider each of the applicable factors prior to imposing sentence; 2) the district court failed to state its reasons for imposing the sentence, in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(c); and 3) the district court violated the Federal Rules of Evidence by acting as a witness during the revocation hearing. O\u2019Connor failed to raise these objections in the district court; therefore, we review for plain error. <em>See United States v. Vences, </em>169 F.3d 611, 613 (9th Cir.1999).</p>\n<p id=\"b607-24\">O\u2019Connor\u2019s first contention fails because a review of the record demonstrates the district court did consider the applicable factors as laid out in 18 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 3583(e) and 3553(a). <em>See United States v. Lock-ard, </em>910 F.2d 542, 544 (9th Cir.1990) (as amended) (enumerating factors such as nature and circumstances of the violation, the need to deter criminal conduct, and the need for educational or vocational training, or medical care). Moreover, the sentence <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"586\">*586</page-number>was imposed in accordance with the applicable statutes and sentencing guidelines. <em>See </em>18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a)(4), (a)(5), (a)(6); U.S.S.G. \u00a7\u00a7 7B1.3, 7B1.4.</p>\n<p id=\"b608-4\">O\u2019Connor\u2019s second contention fails because the district court satisfied 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(c) by explaining how it determined the relevant guideline range. <em>See Lock-ard, </em>910 F.2d at 546 (explaining that district court satisfies \u00a7 3553(c) requirement of stating general reasons for imposing particular sentence by explaining how it determined relevant guideline range).</p>\n<p id=\"b608-5\">O\u2019Connor\u2019s final contention also fails because the Federal Rules of Evidence do not apply to proceedings to revoke supervision. <em>See United States v. Walker, </em>117 F.3d 417, 421 (9th Cir.1997); <em>see also United States v. Sustaita, </em>1 F.3d 950, 952-53 (9th Cir.1993) (recognizing that a sentencing judge may rely on information which would not be admissible at trial). Moreover, the judge\u2019s comments concerning O\u2019Connor\u2019s need for medical treatment did not constitute expert testimony. <em>See </em>18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a)(2)(D).</p>\n<p id=\"b608-6\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b607-25\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and may not be cited to or by the courts of this circuit except as may be provided by 9th Cir.
