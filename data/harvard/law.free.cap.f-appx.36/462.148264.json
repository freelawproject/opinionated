Hall, Judge), after a plea of guilty.</p>\n<p id=\"b486-20\">On December 12, 2000, Quinones pleaded guilty to one count of possessing a firearm by a convicted felon in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 922(g)(1) and 924(a)(2). On June 28, 2001, the District Court sentenced Quinones to an incarcerative term of 96 months, followed by supervised release of 3 years, and a special assessment of $100. Although Quinones\u2019 base offense level and acceptance of responsibility placed him in an initial guidelines range of 51 to 63 months of imprisonment, the District Court found by a preponderance of the evidence that Quinones was eligible under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2K2.1(b)(5) for a 4-level guidelines enhancement based on Qui-nones\u2019 possession of the firearm in connection with a separate felony offense. The 4-level enhancement raised Quinones\u2019 guidelines range to 77 to 96 months of imprisonment.</p>\n<p id=\"b486-21\">Quinones appeals his sentence on the grounds that, pursuant to the Supreme Court\u2019s decision in <em>Apprendi v. New Jersey, </em>530 U.S. 466, 120 S.Ct. 2348, 147 L.Ed.2d 435 (2000), facts which increase a defendant\u2019s sentence above the maximum in a guidelines range but below the relevant statutory maximum must be proven to a jury beyond a reasonable doubt or at least be proven to a sentencing court by more than a preponderance of the evidence. However, as Quinones concedes, these arguments have already been foreclosed by our recent decision in <em>United </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"463\">*463</page-number><em>States v. Norris, </em>281 F.3d 357 (2d Cir. Feb.19, 2002).</p>\n<p id=\"b487-5\">In <em>Norris, </em>we held that \u201cin light of our applicable precedents, <em>Apprendi </em>does not apply to enhancements that determine a sentence that is within the applicable statutory maximum and that would otherwise be above the applicable statutory minimum.\u201d 281 F.3d at 359. We further held that \u201cthe applicable standard of proof for enhancements is preponderance of the evidence.\u201d <em>Norris </em>is clearly dispositive of Quinones\u2019 appeal. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b487-6\">Accordingly, we AFFIRM the judgment of the District Court.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
