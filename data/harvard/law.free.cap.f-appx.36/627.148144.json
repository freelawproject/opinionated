We have jurisdiction pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291. We review de novo, <em>Barnett v. Centoni </em>31 F.3d 813, 816 (9th Cir.1994) (per curiam), and affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b649-26\">Because Gotcher does not have a liberty interest in avoiding placement in administrative segregation, the district court prop<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"628\">*628</page-number>erly dismissed his due process claims with prejudice. <em>See May v. Baldwin, </em>109 F.3d 557, 565 (9th Cir.1997). Moreover, because Gotcher was disciplined with the revocation of good-time credits and did not demonstrate that this discipline had been vitiated by a state-court proceeding, the district court properly dismissed these claims. <em>See Edwards v. Balisok, </em>520 U.S. 641, 646-47, 117 S.Ct. 1584, 137 L.Ed.2d 906 (1997).</p>\n<p id=\"b650-4\">We also affirm the district court\u2019s dismissal with prejudice of Gotcher\u2019s access-to-the-courts claims. <em>See Lewis v. Casey, </em>518 U.S. 343, 354-55, 116 S.Ct. 2174, 135 L.Ed.2d 606 (1996).</p>\n<p id=\"b650-5\">Finally, because Gotcher admitted in his objections to the magistrate judge\u2019s report and recommendation that he had not exhausted his claims regarding his inmate trust account, we conclude that the district court properly dismissed these claims without prejudice. <em>See Booth v. Churner, </em>532 U.S. 731, 741, 121 S.Ct. 1819, 149 L.Ed.2d 958 (2001).</p>\n<p id=\"b650-6\">We reject Gotcher\u2019s remaining contentions on appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b650-7\">AFFIRMED,</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b649-27\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and may not be cited to or by the courts of this circuit except as may be provided by 9th Cir.
