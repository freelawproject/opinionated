Sept.25, 2000). Sheldon originally entered his petition in the Eastern District of New York seeking release from confinement pursuant to the Southern District\u2019s finding of civil contempt for his failure to produce documents in his underlying bankruptcy case. <em>Id. </em>at *1. After a tortured procedural history, the Eastern District of New York ordered Sheldon released pending resolution of his petition and transferred the matter to the Southern District of New York. The Southern District denied his petition. <em>Id. </em>Since the filing of the original petition, the underlying proceedings in bankruptcy have closed and Sheldon has been released pursuant to an order of this Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b682-7\">28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1826 instills in the courts the power to detain a witness who refuses to testify until the witness produces the requested testimony or other information. The statute specifically provides, however, that \u201c[n]o period of such confinement shall exceed the life of ... the court proceeding ... before which such refusal to comply with the court order occurred.\u201d 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1826(a). In this case, the court proceeding before which Sheldon refused to produce requested documents closed on December 6, 2000. As of that date, therefore, the court no longer had the power to confine Sheldon for his contempt. Furthermore, this Court ordered Sheldon\u2019s release according to Rule 23(b)(3) of the Federal Rules of Appellate Procedure on December 5, 2000. As Sheldon has not been incarcerated since that time, and as there can be no outstanding order to incarcerate him pursuant to the closed bankruptcy proceeding, he may no longer assert a habeas petition under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2241, the basis of his claim, which limits the court\u2019s ability to grant the writ of habeas to cases in which the petitioner is presently in custody. <em>See </em>28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2241(c).</p>\n<p id=\"b682-9\">For the reasons set forth above, Sheldon\u2019s petition for habeas corpus is DISMISSED as moot.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
