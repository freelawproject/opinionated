We are satisfied that the jurisdiction of this Court is squarely controlled by the plain text of Section 1249(a)(b)(5)(C), which provides that an in absentia removal order may be rescinded only upon a motion to reopen; we believe that we are also controlled by <em>Marrero v. INS, </em>990 Fed.2d 772, Third Circuit, 1993, that a petition for review an in absentia deportation order is not proper where the alien had failed to file a motion to reopen the deportation order. Now, we are aware that one has now been filed, but that fact subsumes what is the animating spirit of both the statute and Marrero case, that the petitioner must exhaust administrative remedies; under these circumstances, petitioner has not exhausted them. And we have no idea what the Board will do: The Board may very well grant the motion to reopen, and this Court <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"504\">*504</page-number>has made some remarks on the record that it has no objection if Ms. Aristova communicates to the Board.</p>\n<p id=\"b528-4\">We are also satisfied that there would be no difference, given the clear, unequivocal proof of notice required for service, whatever the standard of review. We are, should we reach the merits, concerned about the sloppy manner in which the form was filled out by the Immigration Judge.</p>\n<p id=\"b528-5\">At all events, we are satisfied that we lack jurisdiction and, accordingly, the appeal will be dismissed. The Clerk will arrange for a transcript of this bench opinion, which will be a non-precedential opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b528-6\">Judge Scirica, anything to add or do you concur?</p>\n<p id=\"b528-7\">THE HONORABLE JUDGE SCIRI-CA: I concur.</p>\n<p id=\"b528-8\">JUDGE BECKER: Judge Rendell?</p>\n<p id=\"b528-9\">THE HONORABLE JUDGE REN-DELL: Yes, I concur as well.</p>\n<p id=\"b528-10\">JUDGE BECKER: Thank you very much.</p>\n<p id=\"b528-11\">(Bench opinion concluded.)</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
