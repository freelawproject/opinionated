We deny the petition.</p>\n<p id=\"b338-24\">In cases involving multiple injuries or cumulative trauma that result in compen-sable disability, liability for purposes of the Longshore and Harbor Workers\u2019 Compensation Act, 33 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 901-950, attaches to the employer for whom the claimant was working when the last injury \u201caggravated, accelerated or combined with claimant\u2019s prior injury, thus resulting in claimant\u2019s disability.\u201d <em>Found. Constructors, Inc. v. Dir. OWCP, </em>950 F.2d 621, 623 (9th Cir.1991) (quoting <em>Kelaita v. Dir. OWCP, </em>799 F.2d 1308, 1311 (9th Cir.1986)). Here, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"315\">*315</page-number>Ahuna suffered from a long-lasting injury to his left knee which he was told almost immediately after his last job with SSA would require a total joint replacement. Ahuna also injured his right knee while under SSA\u2019s employment. SSA concedes in its briefing that \u201c[i]t is clear that Ahu-na\u2019s disability results from the combination of his left and right knee impairments, as the ALJ found.\u201d Because SSA does not challenge the Board\u2019s finding that Ahuna suffered no further injuries or aggravation to either of his existing injuries after Ahu-na\u2019s employment with SSA, we must conclude that SSA is the employer liable for Ahuna\u2019s disability compensation.</p>\n<p id=\"b339-5\">PETITION DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b338-25\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and may not be cited to or by the courts of this circuit except as may be provided by Ninth Circuit Rule 36-3.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
