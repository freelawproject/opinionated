In the two complaints at issue, appellants asserted on behalf of themselves and others similarly situated, respectively, 70 and 40 counts against defendants-appellees, the City of New York, the NYPD, the New York City Office of Labor Relations, and various of their officers (collectively, the \u201cCity\u201d); the police unions of which the retirees are members, including the Patrolmen\u2019s Benevolent Association; and the Boards of Trustees of the various funds at issue. The district court dismissed most but not all of these claims in two opinions, <em>New York 10-13 Ass\u2019n v. City of New York, </em>No. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"9\">*9</page-number>98 Civ. 1425, 1999 WL 177442, at *19-20 (S.D.N.Y. Mar. 30, 1999), <em>New York 10-13 Ass\u2019n v. City of New York, </em>No. 98 Civ. 1425, 2000 WL 1376101, at *15-16 (S.D.N.Y. Sept. 22, 2000)[hereinafter, respectively, <em>New York 10-13 I &amp; New York 10-13 II], </em>familiarity with which is assumed, pursuant to the motions of various appellees for judgment on the pleadings and summary judgment. The district court also denied without prejudice appellants\u2019 motions for class certification. <em>See New York 10-13 I, </em>1999 WL 177442, at *20; <em>New York 10-13 II, </em>2000 WL 1376101, at *16. The remaining claims were withdrawn by the parties, and this appeal followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b39-5\">This dispute arises out of the administration of various benefits received by the retired police officers. The gravamen of appellants\u2019 claim, both below and here on appeal, is that \u201cit has become standard in New York City\u2019s collective bargaining with its police unions for the parties to negotiate over and agree to diversion of moneys set aside for retirees to the payment of more generous benefits for the present employees \u2014 and that the fund trustees ... have done the other Defendants\u2019 bidding.\u201d In their two complaints, appellants sought relief under a variety of theories, including age discrimination, illegal representation, breach of state and federal fiduciary and fair representation duties, and the violation of various constitutional rights.</p>\n<p id=\"b39-6\">On appeal, appellants claim that the district court erred by (1) dismissing the Taylor law claims that the unions and the City illegally bargained on behalf of the retirees; (2) not finding that, in the course of this illegal bargaining, the appellees had breached various state law duties, including fiduciary duties and duties of fair representation; (3) finding that appellants had failed to establish standing to assert many of their claims; (4) dismissing the contract clause and takings claims; and (5) dismissing the age discrimination claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b39-8\">Reviewing the district court\u2019s judgment on the pleadings and grant of summary judgment <em>de novo, Sheppard v. Beerman, </em>94 F.3d 823, 827 (2d Cir.1996) (judgment on the pleadings); <em>VKK Corp. v. Nat'l Football League, </em>244 F.3d 114, 118 (2d Cir.2001) (motion for summary judgment), we affirm for substantially the reasons set forth in Judge Koeltl\u2019s thorough and thoughtful opinions.</p>\n<p id=\"b39-9\">Accordingly, for the reasons set forth above, the judgment of the district court is AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
