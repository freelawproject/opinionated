The District Court concluded that Delgado was entitled to a downward departure based upon his substantial assistance. Nonetheless, the court decided that a three-month departure was all that was indicated because appellant had an extensive history as a drug dealer and because there was a substantial quantity of the drugs involved in this offense. In effect, appellant is arguing that the District Court should have departed a total of fifteen months below his applicable Guideline range instead of three months.</p>\n<p id=\"b515-9\">We do not have appellate jurisdiction to review a challenge to the District Court\u2019s discretionary decision, challenging the extent of a downward departure under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 5K1.1. See <em>United States v. Torres, 251 </em>F.3d 138, 145 (3d Cir.2001) (citing <em>United States v. Parker, </em>902 F.2d 221, 222 (3d Cir.1990)). Thus, we will dismiss this appeal.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
