We dismiss the appeal for lack of jurisdiction because Almond\u2019s notice of appeal was not timely filed.</p>\n<p id=\"b188-19\">Parties in a civil action, in which the United States is not a party, are accorded thirty days after the entry of the magistrate judge\u2019s final judgment or order to note an appeal, <em>see </em>Fed. R.App. P. 4(a)(1), unless the magistrate judge extends the appeal period under Fed. RApp. P. 4(a)(5), or reopens the appeal period under Fed. R. App. P. 4(a)(6). This appeal period is \u201cmandatory and jurisdictional.\u201d <em>Browder v. Dir., Dep\u2019t of Corr., </em>434 U.S. 257, 264, 98 S.Ct. 556, 54 L.Ed.2d 521 (1978) (quoting <em>United States v.

Almond\u2019s notice of appeal was filed on March 25, 2002. Because Almond failed to file a timely notice of appeal or to obtain an extension or reopening of the appeal period, we deny a certificate of appealability and dismiss the appeal. We deny Almond\u2019s motion for preparation of a transcript at government expense and dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b188-23\">\n<em>DISMISSED.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b188-18\"> The parties consented to the exercise of jurisdiction by the magistrate judge in accordance with 28 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 636(c)(1) (West 1993 &amp; Supp.2001).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
