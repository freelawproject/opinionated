R.App. P. 34(a)(2).</p>\n</footnote>\n<opinion data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"majority\">\n<p id=\"b353-25\">MEMORANDUM <footnotemark>**</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b353-26\">Dr. Harrell Robinson and his attorney, Roy Dickson, appeal an award of sanctions <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"330\">*330</page-number>for misconduct and bad faith in connection with the filing and prosecution of Robinson\u2019s 1999 bankruptcy petition. We affirm. Because the parties are familiar with the factual and procedural history, we do not recount it here.</p>\n<p id=\"b354-4\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b354-5\">The bankruptcy court\u2019s factual findings are supported by the record and are not clearly erroneous. <em>See In re Levander, </em>180 F.3d 1114, 1118 (9th Cir.1999). Robinson admitted that he filed the bankruptcy petition in an effort to save his home from foreclosure, and that he did not intend to make arrangements to satisfy Cigna\u2019s claims against him in the bankruptcy. Robinson had filed two previous personal bankruptcies, one of which was still pending at the time of his filing in this case, and Dickson was Robinson\u2019s attorney for each of those bankruptcy filings.</p>\n<p id=\"b354-6\">The court\u2019s finding that Robinson engaged in a pattern of bad faith conduct because he repeatedly failed to comply with bankruptcy disclosure and scheduling requirements also was not clearly erroneous. A review of the record supports the court\u2019s factual findings that Robinson failed to disclose his ownership of real property, incorrectly reported the value for his residential property, and failed to include Cigna as a creditor in its schedules.</p>\n<p id=\"b354-7\">Finally, the record supports the court\u2019s finding that Robinson and Dickson knowingly deceived the court and acted in bad faith in their efforts to have Robinson\u2019s bankruptcy petition dismissed. Robinson and Dickson, with the help of Robinson\u2019s landlord, filed sworn declarations, fabricated letters and court pleadings which claimed that Robinson\u2019s landlord would repossess his office property if he remained in bankruptcy. Robinson and Dickson knew that the landlord had no intention of repossessing Robinson\u2019s business, but asked him to write letters saying he would repossess if the bankruptcy was not dismissed.</p>\n<p id=\"b354-9\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b354-10\">The district court correctly concluded that the bankruptcy court did not abuse its discretion in sanctioning Robinson and Dickson for their conduct under the court\u2019s inherent powers and Fed. R. Bankr.P. 9011. Robinson and Dickson knowingly submitted perjured declarations, fabricated evidence and frivolous pleadings in their attempts to convince the bankruptcy court to dismiss Robinson\u2019s petition, in violation of Fed R. Bankr.P. 9011. <em>Marsch v. Marsch (In re Marsch), </em>36 F.3d 825, 829-30 (9th Cir.1994); <em>Valley Nat\u2019l Bank v. Needier (In re Grantham Brothers), </em>922 F.2d 1438, 1442 (9th Cir.1991).</p>\n<p id=\"b354-11\">Those actions, combined with the pattern of bad faith and misconduct documented by the court in its factual findings, also are sanctionable pursuant to the court\u2019s inherent powers under 11 U.S.C. \u00a7 105. <em>Caldwell v. Unified Capital Corp. (In re Rainbow Magazine, Inc.), </em>77 F.3d 278, 284 (9th Cir.1996).</p>\n<p id=\"b354-12\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b353-28\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and may not be cited to or by the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"330\">*330</page-number>courts of this circuit except as may be provided by Ninth Circuit Rule 36-3.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
