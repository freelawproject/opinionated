Because the facts are familiar to the parties, we will not recite them in detail except as necessary. We have jurisdiction pursuant to 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1105(a). Illegal Immigration Reform and Immigrant Responsibility Act (\u201cIIRIRA\u201d) \u00a7 309. We deny the petitions.</p>\n<p id=\"b278-20\">De la Torre first argues that the BIA\u2019s September 15, 2000 deportation order should be reversed. We review de novo the BIA\u2019s determination of purely legal issues. <em>Chowdhury v. INS, </em>249 F.3d 970, 972 (9th Cir.2001). The BIA\u2019s findings of fact are reviewed for substantial evidence. <em>Lal v. INS, </em>255 F.3d 998, 1000 (9th Cir. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"253\">*253</page-number>2001). We conclude that the BIA correctly applied the stop-time rule under IIRI-RA \u00a7 309(c)(5) and that its decision was supported by substantial evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b279-5\">Even if the stop-time rule had not been applied, de la Torre would not have been eligible for a suspension of deportation as a result of his conviction. De la Torre is ineligible for a finding of good moral character because he was confined for a period of more than 180 days. 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1101(f)(7) (precluding one from establishing good moral character if he \u201chas been confined, as a result of conviction, to a penal institution for an aggregate period of one hundred and eighty days or more ... \u201d). The petitioner argues that this provision does not apply to him because he served 314 days of his 365-day sentence prior to his conviction. This argument is not persuasive because petitioner was simply given credit for time served. Accordingly, the conviction falls under 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1101(f)(7).</p>\n<p id=\"b279-6\">The petitioner also argues that he could have established good moral character because his conviction had been expunged under California Penal Code \u00a7 1203.4(a). Under IIRIRA, however, this expungement does not affect the consequences of the conviction for purposes of the deportation laws. <em>See Ramirez-Castro v. INS, </em>287 F.3d 1172 (9th Cir.2002); <em>Murillo-Espinoza v. INS, </em>261 F.3d 771 (9th Cir. 2001). Thus, the conviction made de la Torre statutorily ineligible to demonstrate good moral character for purposes of obtaining a suspension of deportation.</p>\n<p id=\"b279-7\">The petitioner also argues that the BIA\u2019s August 1, 2001 denial of his motion to reopen should be reversed. De la Torre had moved to introduce evidence that he had entered the country in August 1985, early enough to satisfy the requirements of the stop-time rule. The BIA\u2019s denial of that motion, de la Torre contends, violated his due process rights. However, as noted above, de la Torre is ineligible for a suspension of deportation based upon his conviction, and thus he has not shown that he has been prejudiced by the denial of the motion to reopen. <em>See Campos-Sanchez v. INS, </em>164 F.3d 448, 450 (9th Cir.1999).</p>\n<p id=\"A4J\">PETITIONS FOR REVIEW DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b278-21\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and may not be cited to or by the courts of this circuit except as may be provided by Ninth Circuit Rule 36-3.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
