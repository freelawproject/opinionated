A prison guard caught inmate Randall Min-niefield with tobacco, and as a result he was reprimanded and lost 60 days of good-time credit. After exhausting his administrative remedies, Minniefield filed a petition for a writ of habeas corpus under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254(a) claiming that prison officials violated his due process rights. The district court denied Minniefield\u2019s petition. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b249-23\">In September 2000 Minniefield was transferred from Wabash Valley to the Lake County jail for a court hearing. Unlike Wabash Valley, Lake County lets inmates smoke and its commissary sells tobacco. Minniefield took advantage of Lake County\u2019s policy and bought some tobacco. When Minniefield returned to Wabash Valley, a prison guard searched his belongings and found tobacco scattered between the pages of six transcripts Min-niefield brought with him. The pages of the transcripts were glued together with what appeared to be toothpaste. The guard confiscated the transcripts and tobacco, and submitted a conduct report describing his discovery. The prison\u2019s disciplinary board held a hearing and found Minniefield guilty of possessing tobacco based upon the conduct report and Minnie-field\u2019s own testimony.</p>\n<p id=\"b249-24\">Minniefield argued in his \u00a7 2254 petition that the prison gave him inadequate notice of the charge and prevented him from preparing an adequate defense and presenting witnesses. But he abandons these arguments on appeal and now claims only that the district court \u201cmisconstrued the facts of the case.\u201d His challenge faces a tough hurdle. Due process requires only that the disciplinary board\u2019s decision be supported by \u201csome\u201d evidence. <em>Webb v. Anderson, </em>224 F.3d 649, 652 (7th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>531 U.S. 999, 121 S.Ct. 497, 148 L.Ed.2d 468 (2000). That standard is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"220\">*220</page-number>meager, and we will affirm the district court\u2019s denial of Minniefield\u2019s petition as long as there was <em>any </em>evidence in the record that he possessed tobacco in the prison. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b250-4\">Minniefield has never disputed bringing tobacco with him when he returned to Wabash Valley. He admits possession in his appellate brief. The conduct report filed by the guard also states that Minnie-field possessed tobacco in the prison. The conduct report alone meets the \u201csome\u201d evidence standard, <em>McPherson v. McBride, </em>188 F.3d 784, 786 (7th Cir.1999), and therefore the district court properly denied Minniefield\u2019s habeas corpus petition. Minniefield\u2019s arguments that he broke no rule when he bought the tobacco at the Lake County jail and that he did not get it past the Wabash Valley guards are merit-less because neither rebuts the fact that he possessed tobacco in the prison. His argument that the prison should only have confiscated the tobacco rather than discipline him is also meritless. Although Min-niefield has cited a handbook which advises inmates that the prison will confiscate prohibited items, it does not state that confiscation is the prison\u2019s exclusive remedy.</p>\n<p id=\"b250-6\">For the preceding reasons, we AFFIRM the judgment of the district court.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
