On appeal, Vernon contends that the district court erred in finding a factual basis for his plea for the \u00a7 924(c) offense charged in count 12 of his indictment, charging him with using, carrying, and brandishing a firearm during and in relation to a crime of violence; specifically, an armed bank robbery. The district court\u2019s determination of whether a factual basis exists for a guilty plea and its acceptance of a guilty plea is reversed only for abuse of discretion. <em>United States v. Mitchell, </em>104 F.3d 649, 652 (4th Cir.1997).</p>\n<p id=\"b116-22\">The record discloses an adequate factual basis for Vernon\u2019s guilty plea. The court\u2019s reading of the charges in the indictment, coupled with Vernon\u2019s admission to the charges, provided a sufficient basis for the plea. <em>See United States v. McFadden, </em>238 F.3d 198, 200 (2nd Cir.2001). Moreover, Vernon also acknowledged the accuracy of the Government\u2019s recitation of the factual basis for the charge, which specifically averred Vernon\u2019s use of a handgun in connection with the robbery.</p>\n<p id=\"b116-23\">Vernon also asserts that his receipt of a three-level enhancement for use of a \u201cdangerous weapon\u201d in connection with the underlying armed robbery offense undermines the validity of his \u00a7 924(c) conviction for use of a firearm, because both offenses relate to the same armed rob<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"87\">*87</page-number>bery. While we note that the Government concedes that application of the dangerous weapon enhancement to the pertinent bank robbery charge was improper under <em>U.S. Sentencing Guidelines Manual </em>\u00a7 2K2.4, this does not undermine the validity of Vernon\u2019s plea to the \u00a7 924(c) charge. Moreover, we further note that Vernon does not challenge the propriety of the enhancement, or the Government\u2019s position that application of the enhancement did not ultimately affect Vernon\u2019s sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b117-5\">Accordingly, we affirm Vernon\u2019s conviction and sentence. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b117-6\">\n<em>AFFIRMED.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
