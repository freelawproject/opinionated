Whitfield appeals from the final judgment entered in the District Court<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> for the Western District of Missouri after he pleaded guilty to bank robbery, in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2113(a). The district court sentenced Whitfield to 151 months imprisonment and 3 years supervised release. Counsel has moved to withdraw on appeal pursuant to <em>Anders v. California, </em>386 U.S. 738, 87 S.Ct. 1396, 18 L.Ed.2d 493 (1967), and has filed a brief challenging Whitfield\u2019s classification as a career offender. Whitfield has not filed a pro se supplemental brief. For the reasons discussed below, we dismiss this appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b595-8\">Because Whitfield knowingly and voluntarily waived the right to challenge his sentence on direct appeal, we will not entertain counsel\u2019s argument about the propriety of Whitfield\u2019s career offender status. <em>See United States v. Morrison, </em>171 F.3d 567, 568 (8th Cir.1999) (waiver of appeal enforcement). Further, we have reviewed the record independently for any un-waived, nonfrivolous issues, <em>see Penson v. Ohio, </em>488 U.S. 75, 80, 109 S.Ct. 346, 102 L.Ed.2d 300 (1988), and we have found none. Accordingly, we grant counsel\u2019s motion to withdraw, and we dismiss the appeal.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b595-10\">. The Honorable Howard F. Sachs, United States District Judge for the Western District of Missouri.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
