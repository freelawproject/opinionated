RApp. P. 34(f); 10th Cir. R. 34.1(G). The case is therefore ordered submitted without oral argument.</p>\n<p id=\"b425-12\">Thomas Berry appeals from a Tax Court judgment upholding the Commissioner\u2019s notice of deficiency for federal income taxes due on his 1996 return. The deficiency notice stemmed from the Commissioner\u2019s refusal to allow Mr. Berry to deduct as \u201calimony\u201d $154,000 in fees and costs he paid to his former wife\u2019s attorney during the Berrys\u2019 divorce proceedings. The Commissioner took the position that Mr. Berry\u2019s payment did not satisfy the definition of alimony under section 71(b)(1) of the Internal Revenue Code, 26 U.S.C. \u00a7 71(b)(1). The Tax Court held for the Commissioner, and we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b425-15\">In 1995, Kay Rogers Berry filed a divorce petition against her husband Thomas Berry in an Oklahoma state court. Thereafter the state court issued two temporary orders requiring Mr. Berry to pay Mrs. Berry\u2019s attorney\u2019s fees and costs. It issued a third such order, in August 1996, directing Mr. Berry to pay an additional $154,000 to his wife\u2019s attorney. In 1997, Mr. and Mrs. Berry negotiated a settlement; the court entered a final decree of divorce in accord with the parties\u2019 agreement. Mr. Berry, who complied with all of the court\u2019s temporary fee orders, claims that his $154,000 payment to Mrs. Berry\u2019s attorney constitutes alimony. He concludes therefore that it is tax deductible under section 215(a) of the Code, 26 U.S.C. \u00a7 215(a).</p>\n<p id=\"b425-16\">To qualify for the alimony deduction, a payment must satisfy the Code\u2019s four-part definition. The parties dispute only whether the contested payment meets the fourth criterion of that definition; Would Mrs. Berry\u2019s death release Mr. Berry from the duty to pay his former wife\u2019s attorney? If so, his payment is tax deductible; if not, he cannot claim the deduction.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b426-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"402\">*402</page-number>The parties agree that had Mrs. Berry died anytime <em>after </em>the parties\u2019 final divorce decree was entered, Mr. Berry would indeed remain liable to pay her attorney\u2019s fees. Thus, the narrow question before us is whether, as a hypothetical matter, he would have been liable had she died <em>before </em>the final decree was entered.</p>\n<p id=\"b426-4\">Oklahoma law creates and defines the liability arising from the state court order directing Mr. Berry to pay Mrs. Berry\u2019s attorney\u2019s fees; once the breadth of that liability is established, federal law determines its tax consequences. <em>See Morgan v. Commissioner, </em>309 U.S. 78, 80, 60 S.Ct. 424, 84 L.Ed. 585 (1940). Accordingly, because the parties disagree only on the scope of Mr. Berry\u2019s obligation, our task is the same as the Tax Court\u2019s. We must thus predict how the Oklahoma Supreme Court would resolve the question before us. Such a prediction is necessary because no Oklahoma statute or court decision precisely addresses the issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b426-5\">We agree with the Tax Court\u2019s conclusion that <em>Kelly v. Maupin, </em>177 Okla. 44, 58 P.2d 116 (1936), is an apt analogue, one strongly suggesting that the Oklahoma Supreme Court would hold Mr. Berry liable for his wife\u2019s attorney\u2019s fees even if she had died before their final divorce decree was entered. <em>Kelly </em>held that a couple\u2019s voluntary dismissal of their divorce action did not prevent the court from enforcing its earlier ruling requiring the husband to pay the wife\u2019s attorney\u2019s fees. <em>Id. </em>at 119. Like the Tax Court, we see little difference between a divorce action terminated by voluntary dismissal, as in <em>Kelly, </em>and one, as postulated here, terminated by death. The policy justification supporting the rule announced in <em>Kelly </em>applies as well in this case: An attorney fee award remains enforceable even after a dismissal of a divorce because \u201c[i]ts purpose is to provide a means whereby attorneys can be assured of their pay for properly preparing and presenting [a divorce] case.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b426-10\">Mr. Berry points out that under Oklahoma law the death of one spouse before a final divorce decree is entered deprives the court of jurisdiction over the parties and generally terminates the cause of action. <em>See Pellow v. Pellow, </em>714 P.2d 593, 597 (Okla.1985). He is no doubt correct as a general matter, but <em>Kelly, </em>which has never been questioned much less overruled, amounts to an exception to that rule, for it makes clear that in a divorce case an attorney may enforce an existing fee award notwithstanding that the divorce action itself was dismissed without a final decree. We are unpersuaded, moreover, by Mr. Berry\u2019s effort to distinguish <em>Kelly </em>on its facts.</p>\n<p id=\"b426-11\">The judgment of the United States Tax Court is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b425-13\"> This order and judgment is not binding precedent, except under the doctrines of law of the case, res judicata, and collateral estoppel.

R. 36.3.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b425-17\">.
