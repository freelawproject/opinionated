The relevant portion of section 44-1009 states that the claim must be brought \u201cwithin four years after the transfer was made or obligation was incurred.\u201d The last transfer in the record from Grantham Fire Protection, Inc. (Grantham) to Genesis Fire Protection, Inc. (Genesis) took place on May 1, 1992-four years and five months before the First Commerce filed its claim. Grantham also incurred a series of obligations on Genesis\u2019 behalf when it allowed Genesis to use its credit to purchase goods from suppliers. While the record indicates that Genesis reimbursed Grantham for these withdrawals as late as December 11, 1992, there is no evidence that these obligations were <em>incurred </em>by <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"342\">*342</page-number>Grantham after August 31, 1992. Because First Commerce\u2019s claim was not timely under either period, we have no need to decide which one applies. The district court\u2019s summary judgment on First Commerce\u2019s fraudulent transfer claim was proper.</p>\n<p id=\"b366-4\">The second issue is whether the district court erred in holding that Genesis should not be held liable as a Grantham successor because Grantham\u2019s \u201cprincipal assets\u201d were not transferred to Genesis. <em>A.R. Teeters &amp; Assocs., Inc. v. Eastman Kodak Co., </em>172 Ariz. 324, 836 P.2d 1034, 1039 (Ct.App.1992). Under <em>A.R. Teeters, </em>the transfer of a corporation\u2019s \u201cprincipal assets\u201d is a prerequisite to successor liability. <em>Id. </em>First Commerce argues that the district court erred in not finding that Grantham transferred its goodwill to Genesis. Because First Commerce failed to ask the district court to make such a finding, the argument is waived. <em>Hollinger v. United States, </em>651 F.2d 636, 640-41 (9th Cir.1981) (citation omitted). Since First Commerce\u2019s other successor liability arguments hinge on the \u201cprincipal assets\u201d issue, the same result obtains.</p>\n<p id=\"b366-5\">Defendants cross-appeal the district court\u2019s refusal to award attorneys\u2019 fees under Arizona Revised Statutes section 12-341.01. \u201cWe review a district court\u2019s award of attorneys\u2019 fees under state law for abuse of discretion. We review whether the district court properly interpreted and applied the relevant state statute, however, de novo.\u201d <em>Kona Enters., Inc. v. Estate of Bishop, </em>229 F.3d 877, 883 (9th Cir.2000) (citations omitted). Section 12-341.01(A) states that a court may award attorneys\u2019 fees in an action that \u201carise[s] out of a contract.\u201d First Commerce\u2019s claims arose out of contract because it could not have brought its action <em>\u201cbut for\u201d </em>the Grantham note. <em>Sparks v. Republic Nat\u2019l Life Ins. Co., </em>132 Ariz. 529, 647 P.2d 1127, 1141 (1982) (emphasis added). The district court should award attorneys\u2019 fees to the defendants in its discretion. <em>McKesson Chem. Co. v. Van Waters &amp; Rogers, </em>153 Ariz. 557, 739 P.2d 211, 216 (Ct.App.1987).</p>\n<p id=\"b366-7\">Section 12-341.01(C) requires a court to award fees in cases where a claim \u201cconstitutes harassment, is groundless and is not made in good faith.\u201d The district court did not abuse its discretion when it declined to award fees to the Granthams under this provision because First Commerce included them in the action solely for the purpose of recovering Grantham Fire Protection, Inc. assets. <em>See Johnson v. Home State Bank, </em>501 U.S. 78, 83-84, 111 S.Ct. 2150, 115 L.Ed.2d 66 (1991).</p>\n<p id=\"b366-8\">AFFIRMED IN PART, REVERSED IN PART AND REMANDED</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b365-14\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and may not be cited to or by the courts of this circuit except as may be provided by Ninth Circuit Rule 36-3.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
