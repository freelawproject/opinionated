The record, taken in the light most favorable to plaintiff as the party against whom summary judgment was granted, does not contain evidence from which a rational factfinder could infer that the employment decisions of which plaintiff complains were based on his age, national origin, or disability. <em>See generally Schnabel v. Abramson, </em>232 F.3d 83, 91 (2d Cir.2000); <em>Chambers v. TRM Copy Centers Corp., </em>43 F.3d 29, 36-37 (2d Cir.1994).</p>\n<p id=\"b495-6\">We have considered all of plaintiffs contentions on this appeal and have found them to be without merit. The judgment of the district court is affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
