Leo Glasser, <em>Judge, </em>of being a felon in possession of a firearm in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 922(g)(1), and sentencing him principally to 63 months\u2019 imprisonment, to be followed by a three-year term of supervised release. On appeal, Davis, represented by new counsel, contends that he received constitutionally ineffective assistance from the attorney who represented him at trial. Finding no merit in his contentions, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b487-23\">In order to prevail on a claim of ineffective assistance of counsel, a defendant must show both that counsel\u2019s representation fell below an objective standard of reasonableness under prevailing professional norms, and that there is a reason<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"464\">*464</page-number>able probability that but for the deficiency, the outcome of the proceeding would have been different. <em>See Strickland v. Washington, </em>466 U.S. 668, 687-88, 694, 104 S.Ct. 2052, 80 L.Ed.2d 674 (1984). Davis contends principally that his trial counsel\u2019s performance was substandard because counsel (a) failed to conduct adequate cross-examination of certain witnesses as to whether Davis in fact had possessed a firearm, and (b) stipulated that the firearm in question had traveled in foreign commerce. In light of the facts (a) that the witnesses in question testified that on the occasion at issue Davis had pointed a gun at them, and (b) that the gun in question was a German product, Davis has not met either prong of the <em>Strickland </em>test.</p>\n<p id=\"b488-4\">We have considered all of Davis\u2019s contentions on this appeal and have found them to be without merit. The judgment of the district court is affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
