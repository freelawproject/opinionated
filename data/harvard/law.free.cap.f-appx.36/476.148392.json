The United States has moved for summary af-firmance of Impala\u2019s conviction and sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b501-5\">Impala argues on appeal various matters including that he is the victim of a racial conspiracy including, among others, Jews, Irish Catholics, Anglo-Saxon Protestants, and Puerto Ricans. We liberally construe Impala\u2019s arguments to raise the following claims: ineffective assistance of counsel; error by the District Court in admitting evidence seized during Impala\u2019s arrest and certain of Impala\u2019s post-arrest statements; and abuse of discretion by the District Court in departing horizontally from the recommended criminal history category contained in the Bureau of Prison\u2019s Pre-sentencing Report.</p>\n<p id=\"b501-6\">To establish a claim of constitutionally ineffective assistance of counsel, a defendant must show that, but for the alleged deficiency, \u201cthe likely outcome of the proceeding would have been different.\u201d <em>United States v. Best, </em>219 F.3d 192, 201 (2d Cir.2000). Impala\u2019s claim fails because none of the deficiencies that he alleges, or that we liberally construe him to have alleged, likely would have altered his conviction on the bank robbery and felony-in-possession charges.</p>\n<p id=\"b501-8\">On each of the other claims, we affirm for substantially the reasons stated by the District Court. <em>See United States v. Geth-ers, </em>No. 97CR118, Slip Op. (D.Conn. July 9, 1998) (Motion to Suppress); <em>United States v. Gethers, </em>No. 97CR62, Slip Op. (D.Conn. July 9, 1998) (conviction on bank robbery charge); <em>United States v. Gethers, </em>No. 97CR118, Slip Op. (D.Conn. July 9, 1998) (conviction on felon-in-possession charge).</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b500-7\"> Impala changed his name from David Geth-ers, the name appearing on earlier filings and decisions in this matter.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
