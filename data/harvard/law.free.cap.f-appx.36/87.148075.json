The district court denied his motion to compel the Government to move for downward departure based on substantial assistance under <em>U.S. Sentencing Guidelines Manual </em>\u00a7 5K1.1 (2000), refused to grant a downward departure for Roman\u2019s minor role in the offense, and enhanced Roman\u2019s sentence two levels for possession of firearms under <em>U.S. Sentencing Guidelines Manual </em>\u00a7 2D1.1(b)(1) (2000). The district court sentenced Roman to 240 months\u2019 incarceration in compliance with <em>Apprendi v. New Jersey, </em>530 U.S. 466, 120 S.Ct. 2348, 147 L.Ed.2d 435 (2000), which was below the applicable guidelines range of 292 to 365 months.</p>\n<p id=\"b117-24\">Roman noted a timely appeal. Roman\u2019s attorney filed a brief in accordance with <em>Anders v. California, </em>386 U.S. 738, 87 S.Ct. 1396, 18 L.Ed.2d 493 (1967), contending the district court erred in failing to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"88\">*88</page-number>compel the Government to move for downward departure for his cooperation, failing to grant a downward departure based on his minor role in the offense, and accepting a two-level enhancement for possession of firearms.</p>\n<p id=\"b118-4\">A defendant may not appeal a district court\u2019s refusal to depart downward at sentencing unless the court\u2019s refusal was based on a mistaken view that it lacked the authority to depart. <em>United States v. Bayerle, </em>898 F.2d 28, 31 (4th Cir.1990). The district court recognized that it had the authority to depart, but declined to do so. Therefore, we will not review Roman\u2019s claim the district court erred in declining to depart downward. Furthermore, we find the district court did not clearly err in assigning a two-level enhancement because the record supports the finding the two firearms located in the vehicle Roman was operating were probably connected, rather than clearly improbably connected, to the drug offense. <em>See </em>USSG \u00a7 2D1.1, comment. (n.3); <em>United States v. Harris, </em>128 F.3d 850, 852 (4th Cir.1997). Accordingly, we affirm the order of the district court.</p>\n<p id=\"b118-5\">As required by <em>Anders, </em>we have independently reviewed the entire record and all pertinent documents. We have considered all possible issues presented by this record and concluded that there are no non-frivolous grounds for this appeal. Pursuant to the plan adopted by the Fourth Circuit Judicial Council in implementation of the Criminal Justice Act of 1964, 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3006A (1994), this court requires that counsel inform his client, in writing, of his right to petition the Supreme Court for further review. If requested by the client to do so, counsel should prepare a timely petition for writ of certiorari, unless counsel believes that such a petition would be frivolous. In that case, counsel may move in this court for leave to withdraw from representation. Counsel\u2019s motion must state that a copy thereof was served on the client.</p>\n<p id=\"b118-7\">Roman\u2019s conviction and sentence are affirmed. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b118-8\">\n<em>AFFIRMED.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
