We have reviewed the administrative record and the Board\u2019s decision and find that substantial evidence supports the Board\u2019s determination that Tsegaye failed to submit sufficient evidence to establish eligibility for asylum. Accordingly, we deny Tsegaye\u2019s petition for review on the reasoning of the Board. <em>See Tsegaye v. INS, </em>No. A70-683-731 (B.I.A. Jan. 4, 2002). We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b183-21\">\n<em>PETITION DENIED.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
