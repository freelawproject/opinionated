The alleged contract was for a subscription to <em>Men </em>magazine, unauthorized because the subscription was not prepaid, and evidenced by the publisher\u2019s letter to \u201cDave Gradelss\u201d demanding payment and a guard\u2019s conduct report claiming that Gradeless wrote \u201cBill me later\u201d on the magazine order form. The district court initially denied the petition because Gradeless had not described an infringement of a constitutionally protected liberty interest, <em>see Sandin v. Conner, 515 </em>U.S. 472, 115 S.Ct. 2293, 132 L.Ed.2d 418 (1995), but when Gradeless asserted that the reprimand prevented him from moving out of credit-earning Class III where he earned no good time, <em>see </em>Ind.Code \u00a7\u00a7 35-50-6-3 and 35-50-6-4 (2000), the court <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"209\">*209</page-number>revised its order under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 59(e) to conclude instead that there existed \u201csome evidence\u201d to support the disciplinary conviction. Gradeless appeals, and we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b239-5\">We note at the outset that we have yet to address whether \u00a7 2254 or the Due Process Clause are implicated where an inmate alleges only that a prison decision caused his <em>retention in, </em>rather than <em>demotion to, </em>a particular credit-earning class. The closest we have come is <em>Montgomery v. Anderson, </em>262 F.3d 641 (7th Cir.2001), in which we held that 1) \u201cany decision,\u201d including reducing a prisoner\u2019s credit-earning class, \u201cthat determines the fact or duration of state custody may ... be challenged under \u00a7 2254,\u201d and 2) Indiana prisoners must be afforded due process before being promoted to a lower credit earning class. <em>Id. </em>at 643-45. But we need not resolve whether a reprimand that caused Gradeless\u2019s retention in the lowest credit-earning classification \u201cdetermined\u201d the duration of his custody, such that \u00a7 2254 was available, or deprived him of constitutionally protected \u201cliberty\u201d or \u201cproperty,\u201d such that some process was due, because neither party argues the point and Grade-less\u2019s due process claim fails regardless. <em>See Sylvester v. Hanks, </em>140 F.3d 713, 714-15 (7th Cir.1998).</p>\n<p id=\"b239-6\">Among other due process requirements not at issue here, a prison disciplinary decision must at most be supported by \u201csome evidence.\u201d <em>See Superintendent, Mass. Corr. Inst. v. Hill, </em>472 U.S. 445, 454, 105 S.Ct. 2768, 86 L.Ed.2d 356 (1985). The \u201csome evidence\u201d standard requires only that the decision not be arbitrary or without support in the record. <em>Id. </em>at 455-56; <em>McPherson v. McBride, </em>188 F.3d 784, 786 (7th Cir.1999). Contrary to Grade-less\u2019s assertions, the collection letter and the guard\u2019s disciplinary report easily satisfy the \u201csome evidence\u201d standard. <em>See, e.g., McPherson, </em>188 F.3d at 786. Further, the evidence possesses \u201csufficient indicia of reliability\u201d to assure us that the board\u2019s decision was not arbitrary. <em>See Meeks v. McBride, </em>81 F.3d 717, 720 (7th Cir.1996). That the collection letter left out one of the \u201ce\u2019s\u201d in \u201cGradeless\u201d does not seriously call into question its reliability, especially when it is considered in light of the guard\u2019s report that Gradeless had asked the magazine to \u201cBill [him] later.\u201d <em>See Sylvester, </em>140 F.3d at 715 (some evidence where letter claimed \u201cBaye\u201d plotted a riot, inmate was one of a few known as \u201cBaye,\u201d and guard\u2019s conduct report linked letter and inmate by describing conversation in which inmate threatened a \u201cdemonstration\u201d). The prison board heard and rejected Gradeless\u2019s assertions that the guard concocted the conduct report. We are not in a position nor are we required to second-guess such credibility determinations, <em>Hill, </em>472 U.S. at 455-56, 105 S.Ct. 2768, and so the district court\u2019s decision is</p>\n<p id=\"b239-8\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
