As the parties are well aware of the history of these proceedings and the facts involved, we need not repeat them here.</p>\n<p id=\"b63-20\">Williams raises essentially one issue on appeal. He asserts that the District Court erroneously failed to instruct the jury of the \u201cheeding presumption,\u201d which would have informed the jury that the accident machine\u2019s operator would have obeyed an adequate warning had it been placed on the machine. Williams claims that this omission was prejudicial to his case and thus warrants the grant of a new trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b63-21\">\u2018We exercise plenary review in determining whether jury instructions misstated an applicable legal standard.\u201d <em>Fuentes v. Wagner, </em>206 F.3d 335, 346 n. 14 (3d Cir. 2000) (citing <em>Parks v. AlliedSignal, Inc., </em>113 F.3d 1327, 1330 (3d Cir.1997)).</p>\n<p id=\"b63-22\">Appellees argue that Williams\u2019s argument has been waived because he did not timely object to the District Court\u2019s failure to instruct the jury of the \u201cheeding presumption.\u201d To preserve an objection to a failure to instruct a jury on an issue, a party must assert the objection, stating distinctly the matter objected to and the grounds for the objection, before the jury retires to consider its verdict; a party that fads timely to challenge a trial court\u2019s jury instructions is deemed to have waived such a challenge. <em>Alexander v. Riga, </em>208 F.3d 419, 426 (3d Cir.2000). In this case, Williams failed to assert an objection to the District Court\u2019s decision not to instruct the jury of the \u201cheeding presumption\u201d until after jury began deliberations. He thus waived this objection.</p>\n<p id=\"b64-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"34\">*34</page-number>Accordingly, we need not reach the merits of Williams\u2019s appeal. The judgment of the District Court is affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
