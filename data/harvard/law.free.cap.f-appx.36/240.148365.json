No. 104-134, 110 Stat. 1321 (1996) (\u201cPLRA\u201d), amended \u00a7 1997e(a) to provide that \u201c[n]o action shall be brought with respect to prison conditions under section 1983 of this title, or any other Federal law, by a prisoner confined in any jail, prison, or other correctional facility until such administrative remedies as are available are exhausted.\u201d 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1997e(a). Clark was thus required to exhaust all of the administrative remedies available to him in the California prison system, \u201cirrespective of the forms of relief sought and offered through administrative avenues,\u201d before he could pursue his \u00a7 1983 claim in federal court. <em>See Booth v. Churner, </em>532 U.S. 731, 121 S.Ct. 1819, 1825 n. 6, 149 L.Ed.2d 958 (2001).</p>\n<p id=\"b267-6\">Clark contends that he either met the PLRA\u2019s exhaustion requirement or, alternatively, was prevented from doing so when correctional officers \u201cscreened out\u201d his complaints on the basis of his use of \u201cinappropriate statements,\u201d an action which he argues violated his right to petition the government for a redress of his grievances under the First Amendment as set forth in <em>Bradley v. Hall, </em>64 F.3d 1276, 1281-82 (9th Cir.1995). Despite these arguments, however, a review of the record reveals that Clark clearly failed to exhaust the administrative remedies which were available to him for his first and second filed grievances and that he failed to participate fully in the administrative processes made available to him.</p>\n<p id=\"b267-7\">We conclude that the requirement that Clark resubmit his grievances after removing the \u201cinappropriate statements,\u201d which included profanity and offensive language that was not essential to and likely detracted from the substance of his claim, does not constitute a \u201cpunishment,\u201d unlike in <em>Bradley, </em>and is not an \u201cexaggerated response to prison concerns.\u201d <em>See Turner v. Safley, </em>482 U.S. 78, 89-90, 107 S.Ct. 2254, 96 L.Ed.2d 64 (1987). We therefore reject his argument that he should be excepted from the exhaustion requirement.</p>\n<p id=\"b267-11\">We also reject Clark\u2019s further contention that the acts underlying his \u00a7 1983 action, which he argues were individualized instances of retaliation, are not subject to the \u00a7 1997e(a) exhaustion requirement because they do not qualify as \u201cprison conditions.\u201d Clark\u2019s own description of the widespread and systematic nature of defendants\u2019 alleged wrongdoing undermines his claim that the acts were \u201cparticularized instances\u201d of misconduct. Accordingly, we affirm the district court\u2019s grant of summary judgment based Clark\u2019s failure to exhaust his administrative remedies.</p>\n<p id=\"b267-12\">We also affirm the district court\u2019s dismissal of Clark\u2019s additional claims of retaliation when it denied his motion for leave to amend. Clark\u2019s proposed amendments alleging retaliation were either duplicative of existing claims or faked to provide the specific factual akegations necessary to state a claim. The district court did not abuse its discretion in denying the amendments as futke. <em>See Bonin v. Calderon, </em>59 F.3d 815, 845-46 (1995).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b267-13\">We also conclude that the district court properly denied Clark\u2019s motion for reconsideration. We agree with the district court that the PLRA filing fee provisions, 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(b), do not violate due process. <em>See Taylor v. Delatoore, </em>281 F.3d 844 (9th Cir.2002) (holding that \u00a7 1915(b) does not deprive an indigent <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"242\">*242</page-number>prisoner of his constitutional right of access to the courts or of equal protection).</p>\n<p id=\"b268-4\">Finally, because California has an adequate post-deprivation remedy, Clark has no cognizable claim under \u00a7 1983 for the negligent or intentional deprivation of his property. <em>See Barnett v. Centoni, </em>31 F.3d 813, 816-17 (9th Cir.1994).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b268-5\">For the foregoing reasons, the judgment of the district court is</p>\n<p id=\"b268-6\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b266-25\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and may not be cited to or by the courts of this circuit except as provided by Ninth Cir. R. 36-3.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b267-8\">. Because summary judgment was proper, we need not reach the issue of whether the dismissal of defendant Pierce for lack of service was an abuse of discretion.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b268-16\">. We reject Clark\u2019s remaining contentions as meritless.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
