Spivey\u2019s attorney filed a brief in accordance with <em>Anders v. California, </em>386 U.S. 738, 87 S.Ct. 1396, 18 L.Ed.2d 493 (1967), briefing two issues, but concluding there was no error. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b120-19\">Prior to accepting Spivey\u2019s guilty plea, the district court engaged in a thorough colloquy held pursuant to Fed.R.Crim.P. 11. During the Rule 11 hearing, the district court established Spivey\u2019s competence and satisfaction with her attorney, explained what constitutional rights she was relinquishing by pleading guilty, established she understood and reviewed the charges filed against her, informed her of the elements of the offenses and the mandatory minimum and possible maximum punishments, and explained the Sentencing Guidelines and supervised release. Spivey acknowledged her guilt and stated no promises had been made in exchange for her plea. The district court found a factual basis supported the charge and accepted the plea, which Spivey signed. Consequently, we find no error surrounding the Rule 11 hearing. <em>See United States v. DeFusco, </em>949 F.2d 114, 117, 120 (4th Cir.1991).</p>\n<p id=\"b120-20\">The district court sentenced Spivey to 151 months\u2019 imprisonment, which was within the range of 135-168 months calculated under the Sentencing Guidelines and reflected a three level downward adjustment for acceptance of responsibility. <em>See U.S. Sentencing Guidelines Manual </em>\u00a7\u00a7 2D1.1(c)(2), 3E1.1(a), (b) (2000). The statutory maximum term of imprisonment was life imprisonment. <em>See </em>21 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 841(b)(1)(A) (West 1999). Because Spivey\u2019s sentence did not exceed the maximum allowed by the Guidelines or statute, we will not review the sentence. <em>See United States v. Porter, </em>909 F.2d 789, 794 (4th Cir.1990) (finding challenge to court\u2019s exercise of discretion in setting a sentence in a properly calculated guideline range not addressable on appeal).</p>\n<p id=\"b120-21\">As required by <em>Anders, </em>we have reviewed the entire record and have found no meritorious issues for appeal. We therefore affirm Spivey\u2019s conviction and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"91\">*91</page-number>sentence. This court requires that counsel inform his client, in writing, of her right to petition the Supreme Court of the United States for further review. If the client requests that a petition be filed, but counsel believes that such a petition would be frivolous, then counsel may move in this court for leave to withdraw from representation. Counsel\u2019s motion must state that a copy thereof was served on the client. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b121-5\">\n<em>AFFIRMED.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
