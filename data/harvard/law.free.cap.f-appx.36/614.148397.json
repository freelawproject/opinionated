We have jurisdiction pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291 and hold that the district court erred by (1) finding that Carson was not a prevailing party under \u00a7 1988, and (2) refusing to award attorney\u2019s fees that were required by the parties\u2019 settlement agreement. Accordingly, we vacate the district court\u2019s order and remand for determination of an appropriate fees award under both state and federal law.</p>\n<p id=\"b636-19\">I STANDARD OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b636-20\">\u201cThis Court reviews for abuse of discretion a district court\u2019s decision on a motion for attorney fees.\u201d <em>Cline v. Indus. Maint. Eng\u2019g &amp; Contracting Co., </em>200 F.3d 1223, 1235 (9th Cir.2000). The panel \u201creviews the district court\u2019s analysis of the law de novo and its factual determinations for clear error.\u201d <em>Id. </em>\u201c[T]he district court\u2019s fee award will be overturned if it is based on an inaccurate view of the law or a clearly erroneous finding of fact.\u201d <em>Trevino v. Gates, </em>99 F.3d 911, 924 (9th Cir.1996).</p>\n<p id=\"b636-21\">II DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b636-22\">A. Prevailing Party Status</p>\n<p id=\"b636-23\">The district court held that Carson was not a prevailing party for purposes of \u00a7 1988. \u201cThe touchstone of the prevailing party inquiry must be the material alteration of the legal relationship of the parties.\u201d <em>Farrar v. Hobby, </em>506 U.S. 103, 111, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"615\">*615</page-number>113 S.Ct. 566, 121 L.Ed.2d 494 (1992) (quoting <em>Texas State Teachers Ass\u2019n v. Garland Indep. Sch. Dist., </em>489 U.S. 782, 792-93, 109 S.Ct. 1486, 103 L.Ed.2d 866 (1989)). \u201c\u2018[A] material alteration of the legal relationship occurs [when] the plaintiff becomes entitled to enforce a judgment, consent decree, or settlement against the defendant.\u2019 In these situations, the legal relationship is altered because the plaintiff can force the defendant to do something he otherwise would not have to do.\u201d <em>Fischer v. SJB-P.D. Inc., </em>214 F.3d 1115, 1118 (9th Cir.2000) (quoting <em>Farrar, </em>506 U.S. at 113). Accordingly, this Court recently held that \u201ca plaintiff \u2018prevails\u2019 when he or she enters into a legally enforceable settlement agreement against the defendant.\u201d <em>Barrios v. Cal. Interscholastic Fed\u2019n, </em>277 F.3d 1128, 1134 (9th Cir.2002).</p>\n<p id=\"b637-5\">The Settlement required the City to pay Carson $60,000 and to structure her benefits as if she had been hired in 1996, and required the County to pay $5,000. It cannot be disputed that the Settlement provided Carson with relief far in excess of that obtained from her litigation before the Montana Department of Labor. Thus, the Settlement obligated the Defendants to do something they otherwise were not obliged to do. Moreover, the district court retained jurisdiction over the action \u201cfor the limited purpose of enforcing the Settlement,\u201d thus ensuring the Settlement\u2019s legal enforceability. Therefore, under <em>Fischer </em>and <em>Barrios, </em>Carson was a prevailing party for purposes of \u00a7 1988.</p>\n<p id=\"b637-6\">B. The Award of Fees and Costs Under \u00a7 1988 and \u00a7 49-2-505(7)</p>\n<p id=\"b637-7\">The City concedes that Carson was a prevailing party in her state administrative proceedings for purposes of \u00a7 49-2-505(7). In addition, as discussed above, Carson was a prevailing party for purposes of \u00a7 1988. Thus, the remaining issue is whether the district court was obligated to award Carson attorney\u2019s fees after she timely filed her petition in accordance with the Settlement.</p>\n<p id=\"b637-9\">The district court incorporated the Settlement into its order dismissing the case and retained jurisdiction to enforce the Settlement\u2019s terms. The Settlement clearly contemplated that the district court would award attorney\u2019s fees in the event Carson timely filed a petition. Given these unusual circumstances, the district court\u2019s declination to do so was not an appropriate exercise of its discretion. On remand, the court shall, in accordance with the parties\u2019 Settlement, determine an\u2019appropriate fees award under \u00a7 1988 and \u00a7 49-2-505(7). The district court has no discretion to deny altogether fees under either statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b637-10\">VACATED and REMANDED.
