He argues that the $1,034,000 restitution obligation imposed with his 1995 contempt conviction violates the rule announced in <em>Apprendi v. New </em>Jersey, 530 U.S. 466, 120 S.Ct. 2348, 147 L.Ed.2d 435 (2000), because the facts upon which the district court based its restitution order were not proved to a jury beyond a reasonable doubt. Dohrmann served twenty-seven months in prison and remains on supervised release, but he did not chal<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"880\">*880</page-number>lenge the legality of his conviction or sentence in his motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b902-4\">We construe Dohrmanris motion as a petition for habeas corpus under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2241. We have jurisdiction to review the district court\u2019s denial of his motion under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1291 and 2253(a). Because it is not clear from the record that the district court had jurisdiction over Dohrmann\u2019s motion under \u00a7 2241, we vacate and remand to the district court so that it may consider whether it has jurisdiction and, if not, whether it would be in the interest of justice to transfer Dohrm-ann\u2019s petition to the custodial district, in which a \u00a7 2241 petition must be brought.</p>\n<p id=\"b902-5\">I. Proper Avenue for Relief</p>\n<p id=\"atn-dedup-1\">We construe Dohrmann\u2019s motion as a petition for a writ of habeas corpus under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2241, rather than as a petition under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255, because the relief that Dohrmann requests \u2014 review of his restitution obligation only, not the legality of his conviction \u2014 is not available under even a procedurally proper \u00a7 2255 petition.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> <em>United States v. Kramer, </em>195 F.3d 1129, 1130 (9th Cir.1999) (holding that \u00a7 2255 relief \u201cis not available to those, like the defendant, who challenge only fines or restitution orders\u201d). Section 2241 relief, however, is available to petitioners who may not seek relief under \u00a7 2255 or in circumstances in which relief under \u00a7 2255 is \u201cinadequate or ineffective.\u201d 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255; <em>see also Moore v. Reno, </em>185 F.3d 1054, 1055 (9th Cir.1999) (per curiam). Dohrmann also meets \u00a7 2241\u2019s jurisdictional requirement that he be \u201cin custody,\u201d because he was on supervised release at the time that he filed his motion. <em>Feld-man v. Perrill, </em>902 F.2d 1445, 1449 (9th Cir.1990).</p>\n<p id=\"b902-8\">Thus, \u00a7 2241, not \u00a7 2255, is the appropriate avenue of relief. <em>Cf. Montano-Figueroa v. Crabtree, </em>162 F.3d 548 (9th Cir. 1998) (per curiam) (allowing prisoners to use \u00a7 2241 to challenge the lawfulness of the method by which restitution is collected); <em>see also Kramer, </em>195 F.3d at 1129 (relying on text in \u00a7 2255, which is not present in \u00a7 2241, in concluding that \u00a7 2255 requires that the prisoner not only be in custody, but that \u201che also must <em>claim the right to be released </em>from custody\u201d). We have often construed petitions labeled as \u00a7 2255 motions either as petitions for habeas relief under \u00a7 2241 or as petitions for a writ of coram nobis if one of these other avenues is more appropriate. <em>See, e.g., Tyler v. United States, </em>929 F.2d 451, 453 &amp; n. 5 (9th Cir. 1991) (lower court construed \u00a7 2255 motion as \u00a7 2241 petition because the latter was \u201cthe proper vehicle for obtaining judicial review of parole board decisions\u201d). We see no reason not to do so here, especially because the petition was filed pro se, <em>see, e.g., id. </em>at 453; Dohrmann did not label his motion as a \u00a7 2255 petition; and it is not clear from the district court\u2019s order that the district court treated his motion as a \u00a7 2255 petition.</p>\n<p id=\"b902-9\">II. Jurisdiction Under \u00a7 2241</p>\n<p id=\"b902-10\">We nevertheless vacate the district court\u2019s order denying Dohrmanris petition because it is not clear from the record that the district court had jurisdiction under <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"881\">*881</page-number>\u00a7 2241. Dohrmann may bring a \u00a7 2241 habeas petition only in the district court that has personal jurisdiction over his current custodian. <em>Brittingham v. United States, </em>982 F.2d 378, 379 (9th Cir.1992) (per curiam). Because Dohrmann was on supervised release when he filed his motion, the relevant custodian is his supervised release administrator. <em>Cf. Feldman, </em>902 F.2d at 1450 (\u201cThe District of Arizona administers [petitioner\u2019s] current parole, therefore \u2014 convenient or not \u2014 it is in that district that petitioner must proceed.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b903-5\">Neither the record nor the briefs clearly establish the location of Dohrmann\u2019s supervised release administrator. It is not uncommon for a district court to transfer jurisdiction of a person on supervised release to another district under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3605, especially if, as in this case, the defendant is permitted to reside in a different judicial district after his release from custody. <em>See, e.g., United States v. Lakatos, </em>241 F.3d 690, 692 (9th Cir.2001); <em>Feldman, </em>902 F.2d at 1450. It is therefore possible that Dohrmann\u2019s current custodian resides in the Northern District of Alabama, which encompasses Talladega, Alabama, where Dohrmann was incarcerated, and in which Dohrmann has apparently been living since his release from prison.</p>\n<p id=\"b903-6\">If Dohrmann\u2019s custodian is indeed located outside the Northern District of California, then the district court lacked jurisdiction to reach the merits of Dohrmann\u2019s claim. We therefore remand to the district court so that it may determine whether it has jurisdiction.</p>\n<p id=\"b903-7\">If the district court on remand determines that it does not have jurisdiction, then it should determine whether it would be in the interest of justice to transfer Dohrmann\u2019s petition to the court where he could properly have brought it in the first instance. Under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1631, if a \u201ccourt finds that there is a want of jurisdiction, the court shall\u201d transfer the action to any such court in which the action could have properly been brought \u201cif it is in the interest of justice.\u201d 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1631; <em>Miller v. Hambrick, </em>905 F.2d 259, 262 (9th Cir.1990).</p>\n<p id=\"b903-9\">Because we cannot determine whether the district court had jurisdiction, we do not reach the merits of Dohrmann\u2019s underlying <em>Apprendi </em>claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b903-10\">VACATED and REMANDED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b901-28\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and may not be cited to or by the courts of this circuit except as may be provided by Ninth Circuit Rule 36-3.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b902-6\">. We do not, therefore, discuss the procedural inadequacies of Dohrmann\u2019s petition under \u00a7 2255, including his failure to secure a certificate of appealability. <em>See </em>28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2253(c). Because a certificate of appeala-bility is not required to appeal the denial of a petition under \u00a7 2241, <em>Forde v. United States Parole Comm'n, </em>114 F.3d 878, 879 (9th Cir. 1997), we deny as moot Dohrmann\u2019s Motion that Appellant's Pro Se Notice of Appeal Be Deemed an Application for Certificate of Ap-pealability Pursuant to Fed. R.App. P. 22(b)(2).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
