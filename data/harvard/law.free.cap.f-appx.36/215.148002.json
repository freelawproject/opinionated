The district court denied the motion, but then granted a certificate of appealability on the ineffective-assistance claim without explaining how that claim is \u201csubstantial\u201d \u2014 a requirement to obtain appellate review. 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2253(c)(2); <em>Ramunno v. United States, </em>264 F.3d 723, 726 (7th Cir.2001). And the claim is not substantial; it is in fact frivolous. Nonetheless, the government has not moved to vacate the certificate, <em>see Ramunno, </em>264 F.3d at 726, so we will proceed to the merits of the appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b245-19\">Cole contends that his lawyer furnished ineffective assistance by failing to investigate three possible lines of defense: (1) that \u201cbank\u201d as defined in 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2113(f) does not include institutions that are insured by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation \u201cfor only insolvency and not bank robbery\u201d; (2) that \u201cthe intent element of [\u00a7 2113(a)]\u201d was not met because Cole did not \u201center[ ] the bank with intent to commit a felony affecting such bank ... because [he] had been drinking and using drugs, which had altered his mind\u201d; and (3) that the indictment was defective because it cited only to \u00a7 2113(d) and not \u00a7 2113(a). All three of these arguments are frivolous, so Cole\u2019s lawyer was not deficient for fading to raise them. First, it does not matter that the bank Cole robbed was not FDIC-insured for losses due to criminal acts. <em>See </em>18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2113(f). <em>No </em>bank is; FDIC-insurance coverage by nature does not extend so far. <em>See United States v. Watts, </em>256 F.3d 630, 633-34 (7th Cir.2001), <em>petition for cert. </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"216\">*216</page-number><em>filed </em>(Aug. 17, 2001) (No. 01-5860). Second, it is irrelevant whether Cole \u201centered the bank with intent to commit a felony.\u201d Cole pleaded guilty to bank <em>robbery </em>under the first paragraph of subsection (a), which does not require proof of such intent. <em>See generally Carter v. United States, </em>530 U.S. 255, 267-271, 120 S.Ct. 2159, 147 L.Ed.2d 203 (2000). Lastly, an omission in the citation of a charging statute is not grounds for reversal unless the omission misled the defendant to his prejudice. Fed.R.Crim.P. 7(c)(3); <em>United States v. Brumley, </em>217 F.3d 905, 913 (7th Cir.2000). Here, the indictment contains all the elements of the charged offense, and Cole gives no explanation whatsoever how he was prejudiced by the indictment\u2019s failure to cite to both subsections of the statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b246-4\">Cole has briefed additional issues, but the certificate of appealability, which we previously declined to expand, was limited to just the ineffective-assistance claim. The decision of the district court is therefore AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
