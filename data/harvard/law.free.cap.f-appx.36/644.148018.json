R.App. P. 34(a)(2); 10th Cir. R. 34.1(G). The case is therefore ordered submitted without oral argument.</p>\n<p id=\"b666-15\">This case is before the court on Frank Medel Jr.\u2019s <em>pro se </em>request for a certificate of appealability (\u201cCOA\u201d). Medel seeks a COA so that he can appeal the district court\u2019s denial of his 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254 habe-as petition. <em>See 28 </em>U.S.C. \u00a7 2253(c)(1)(a). To be entitled to a COA, Medel must make \u201ca substantial showing of the denial of a constitutional right.\u201d <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 2253(c)(2). Where, as here, the district court denied the petition on the merits, he can make such a showing by demonstrating \u201cthat reasonable jurists could debate whether (or, for that matter, agree that) the petition should have been resolved in a different manner or that the issues presented were adequate to deserve encouragement to proceed further.\u201d <em>Slack v. McDaniel, </em>529 U.S. 473, 484, 120 S.Ct. 1595, 146 L.Ed.2d 542 (2000) (quotation omitted). This court has closely reviewed Medel\u2019s application for a COA, the parties\u2019 appellate briefs, the district court\u2019s thorough and well-stated order, and the entire record on appeal. Our review demonstrates that the district court\u2019s resolution of Me-del\u2019s petition is not reasonably debatable and that the issues he seeks to present on appeal are not deserving of further proceedings. Accordingly, this court DENIES Medel\u2019s request for a COA and DISMISS this appeal for substantially those reasons set out in the district court\u2019s order dated November 20, 2001.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b666-16\"> This order and judgment is not binding precedent, except under the doctrines of law of the case, res judicata and collateral estoppel. The court generally disfavors the citation of orders and judgments; nevertheless, an order and judgment may be cited under the terms and conditions of 10th Cir. R. 36.3.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
