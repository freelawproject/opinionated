Pursuant to a certificate of appealability granted by this court, Smith appeals the district court\u2019s denial of habeas corpus relief on three claims. We have jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2253 and we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b904-21\">Smith first argues that the trial court improperly admitted tape recorded statements that he made to the police during an interview at the stationhouse, in violation of <em>Miranda v. Arizona, </em>384 U.S. 436, 86 S.Ct. 1602, 16 L.Ed.2d 694 (1966). Contrary to the state\u2019s position, this claim <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"883\">*883</page-number>was not procedurally defaulted because it was summarily denied on the merits by the California Supreme Court. <em>Harris v. Superior Court, </em>500 F.2d 1124 (9th Cir. 1974) (en banc). Upon independent review of the record, however, we hold that Smith has not shown that it was an unreasonable application of Supreme Court precedent to conclude that he was not in custody when these statements were made. <em>See California v. Beheler, </em>468 U.S. 1121, 1125, 103 S.Ct. 3517, 77 L.Ed.2d 1275 (1983) (per curiam); <em>Oregon v. Mathiason, </em>429 U.S. 492, 97 S.Ct. 711, 50 L.Ed.2d 714 (1977) (per curiam); <em>Delgado v. Lewis, </em>223 F.3d 976, 982 (9th Cir.2000).</p>\n<p id=\"b905-5\">Similarly, Smith has not shown that the statements that he made to the police on his front porch were admitted in violation of <em>Miranda. </em>The factual findings of the state court were not clearly erroneous. Nor was the legal conclusion that Smith was not in custody for the purposes of <em>Miranda </em>when he made the statement an unreasonable application of Supreme Court precedent. 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254(d); <em>Stansbury v. California, </em>511 U.S. 318, 114 S.Ct. 1526, 128 L.Ed.2d 293 (1994).</p>\n<p id=\"b905-6\">Smith further argues that the admission of this statement violated <em>Miranda </em>because the statement was made in response to continued interrogation after he had invoked his right to have an attorney present. <em>See Edwards v. Arizona, </em>451 U.S. 477, 101 S.Ct. 1880, 68 L.Ed.2d 378 (1981). This claim does not appear to have been exhausted in state court,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> but we may nonetheless deny it on the merits. 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254(b)(2). Based on the evidence in the record, the admission of the statement was not unreasonable.</p>\n<p id=\"b905-9\">Finally, Smith argues that the prosecutor impermissibly commented on his <em>post-Miranda </em>silence, in violation of <em>Doyle v. Ohio, </em>426 U.S. 610, 96 S.Ct. 2240, 49 L.Ed.2d 91 (1976). Even if error, we cannot conclude that this isolated comment had a \u201csubstantial and injurious effect or influence in determining the jury\u2019s verdict.\u201d <em>Bains v. Cambra, </em>204 F.3d 964, 977-78 (9th Cir.) (quoting <em>Brecht v. Abrahamson, </em>507 U.S. 619, 638, 113 S.Ct. 1710, 123 L.Ed.2d 353 (1993)), <em>cert. denied, </em>531 U.S. 1037, 121 S.Ct. 627, 148 L.Ed.2d 536 (2000).</p>\n<p id=\"b905-10\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b904-22\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and may not be cited to or by the courts of this circuit except as may be provided by Ninth Circuit Rule 36-3.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b905-7\">. Smith's introduction of the evidence supporting this claim in his objection to the magistrate\u2019s report was sufficient to preserve the issue for appeal, in the absence of a reasoned decision by the district court to refuse to consider the evidence on procedural grounds. <em>See United States v. Howell, </em>231 F.3d 615, 622-23 (9th Cir.2000).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
