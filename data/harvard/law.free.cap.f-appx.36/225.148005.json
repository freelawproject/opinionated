The District Court<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> found that Benitez-Medina was an organizer and leader of the charged conspiracy. Accordingly, the court imposed a four-level enhancement of Benitez-Medina\u2019s offense level pursuant to U.S. Sentencing Guidelines Manual \u00a7 3Bl.l(a) (2000) (providing for four-level enhancement where defendant \u201cwas an organizer or leader of a criminal activity that involved five or more participants or was otherwise extensive\u201d), resulting in a sentence of 180 months\u2019 imprisonment.</p>\n<p id=\"b256-6\">Benitez-Medina appeals only the four-level sentencing enhancement, arguing that the District Court\u2019s finding regarding his role in the conspiracy is clearly erroneous. We disagree. The evidence presented at the sentencing hearing is sufficient to support specific findings that there were five or more participants in the undertaking; that Benitez-Medina exercised decision-making authority and control over one or more of them; and that he set the price of the methamphetamine, recruited participants, and was entitled to a larger share of the fruits of the drag-distribution scheme than his co-conspirators. Given this evidence, we cannot say the challenged finding is clearly erroneous.</p>\n<p id=\"b256-7\">The sentence imposed by the District Court is affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b256-9\">. The Honorable Jean C. Hamilton, Chief Judge, United States District Court for the Eastern District of Missouri.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
