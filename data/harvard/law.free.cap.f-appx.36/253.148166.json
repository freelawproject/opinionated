Reed, Jr., United States District Judge for the District of Nevada, sitting by designation.</p>\n</footnote>\n<opinion data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"majority\">\n<p id=\"b280-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"254\">*254</page-number>MEMORANDUM <footnotemark>**</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b280-4\">Vincent Mark McNease (\u201cMcNease\u201d) appeals his conviction for violating 21 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 841, 952 and 960.</p>\n<p id=\"b280-5\">1. Any vouching on the part of the prosecutor was negated by the independent, overwhelming physical evidence of McNease\u2019s guilt, <em>United States v. Matthews, </em>240 F.3d 806, 818-19 (9th Cir.2000), and the district court\u2019s curative instruction. <em>United States v. Daas, </em>198 F.3d 1167, 1179 (9th Cir.1999). The district court did not abuse its discretion in denying McNease\u2019s motion for a new trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b280-6\">2. Expert testimony to explain why customs inspectors do not check for fingerprints at the border was relevant and admissible to rebut defense arguments. <em>See United States v. Murillo, </em>255 F.3d 1169, 1178 (9th Cir.2001). The district court did not abuse its discretion in admitting the expert testimony.</p>\n<p id=\"b280-7\">3. Evidence of McNease\u2019s previous conviction was probative of knowledge or lack of mistake, and the district court properly instructed the jury as to the limited purpose for which the evidence was being admitted. <em>See United States v. Hinton, </em>31 F.3d 817, 822 (9th Cir.1994). The district court did not abuse its discretion in admitting the evidence or in ruling that the probative value of evidence was not outweighed by its prejudicial effect. <em>See United States v. Blitz, </em>151 F.3d 1002, 1007-08 (9th Cir.1998).</p>\n<p id=\"b280-8\">4. Our recent holding in <em>United States v. Buckland, </em>277 F.3d 1173, 1187 (9th Cir. 2002), forecloses McNease\u2019s argument regarding the unconstitutionality of 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 841. Similarly, <em>United States v. Varela-Rivera, </em>279 F.3d 1174, 1175 n. 1 (9th Cir.2002), negates McNease\u2019s constitutional challenge to 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 952. Finally, our recent rulings in <em>United States v. Mendoza-Paz, </em>286 F.3d 1104, 1110 (9th Cir.2002), and <em>United States v. Carranza, </em>289 F.3d 634, 643 (9th Cir.2002), preclude McNease\u2019s attack on the constitutionality of 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 960.</p>\n<p id=\"b280-10\">5. The district court committed no error during McNease\u2019s trial. Accordingly, cumulative error analysis does not apply. <em>United States v. De Cruz, </em>82 F.3d 856, 868 (9th Cir.1996).</p>\n<p id=\"b280-11\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b280-23\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and may not be cited to or by the courts of this circuit except as may be provided by Ninth Circuit Rule 36-3.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
