He was sentenced principally to two concurrent 151 month terms of imprisonment, to be followed by a three-year term of supervised release. On appeal, Gil contends principally (1) that his rights under <em>Apprendi v. New Jersey, </em>530 U.S. 466, 120 S.Ct. 2348, 147 L.Ed.2d 435 (2000), were violated because in his plea of guilty he did not admit to trafficking in any particular quantity of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"469\">*469</page-number>heroin, (2) that he was denied effective assistance of counsel, and (3) that the district court abused its discretion in denying him a downward departure for extraordinary family circumstances. Although we modify the judgment to reflect the penalty sections actually applied with respect to his conspiracy offenses, we find no merit in Gil\u2019s contentions, and we affirm the judgment as modified.</p>\n<p id=\"b493-5\">Gil accurately states that in his plea allocution he did not admit to conspiring to import, possess, or distribute any particular quantity of heroin. That fact, however, provides no basis for reversal. The penalties for conspiracy in violation of \u00a7 846 or \u00a7 963, respectively, are the same as those prescribed for the substantive offense that was the object of the conspiracy. <em>See </em>21 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 846, 963. The object of Gil\u2019s \u00a7 846 conspiracy was the distribution and possession of heroin with intent to distribute, in violation of 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 841(a)(1); the object of his \u00a7 963 conspiracy was the importation of heroin, in violation of 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 960(a)(1). Sections 841(b)(1)(A) and 960(b)(1)(A) provide penalties of up to life imprisonment, as well as setting mandatory minimum prison terms, for persons found guilty of possessing/distributing and importing, respectively, specified quantities of heroin. In contrast, \u00a7 841(b)(1)(C), provides that a person found guilty of possessing or distributing an unspecified quantity of heroin \u201cshall be sentenced to a term of imprisonment of not more than 20 years,\u201d 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 841(b)(1)(C); similarly, \u00a7 960(b)(3) provides a 20 year maximum term for a person found guilty of importing an unspecified quantity of heroin. Except in circumstances not applicable here, neither \u00a7 841(b)(1)(C) nor \u00a7 960(b)(3) provides for a mandatory minimum prison term.</p>\n<p id=\"b493-6\">There is no dispute that, in sentencing Gil for violation of \u00a7 846, the district court adopted the government\u2019s explicit suggestion that it sentence him under \u00a7 841(b)(1)(C); with respect to the \u00a7 963 violation, the court also implicitly sentenced him under \u00a7 960(b)(3) rather than under \u00a7 960(b)(1)(A), as the record indicates that the only frame of reference was a 20-year maximum and reflects agreement among the court and the parties that there was no applicable mandatory minimum. The 151 month sentence imposed on Gil on each count was well below the 240 month maxima allowed by \u00a7\u00a7 841(b)(1)(C) and 960(b)(3), and hence there was no <em>Apprendi </em>violation.</p>\n<p id=\"b493-8\">We note, however, that, notwithstanding the court\u2019s decision to apply to Gil the penalty provisions of \u00a7\u00a7 841(b)(1)(C) and 960(b)(3), the written judgment indicates that he was sentenced under \u00a7\u00a7 841(b)(1)(A) and 960(b)(1)(A). Accordingly, the judgment is modified to indicate that the sentence for Gil\u2019s \u00a7 846 offense was imposed under 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 841(b)(1)(C) and that the sentence for his \u00a7 963 offense was imposed under 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 960(b)(3). A corrected judgment should be entered reflecting those modifications.</p>\n<p id=\"b493-9\">Gil also contends that the attorney who represented him at the time of his plea of guilty provided constitutionally ineffective assistance. The record, however, does not indicate that counsel\u2019s performance was substandard; and given that Gil was sentenced below the statutory maxima for trafficking in unspecified quantities of heroin and without reference to any statutory mandatory minimum, and that he suffered no adverse consequences from having pleaded guilty, Gil cannot meet the standard for ineffective-assistance-of-counsel claims set by <em>Strickland v. Washington, </em>466 U.S. 668, 104 S.Ct. 2052, 80 L.Ed.2d 674 (1984).</p>\n<p id=\"b494-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"470\">*470</page-number>Finally, Gil\u2019s contention that the district court abused its discretion in denying him a downward departure for extraordinary family circumstances is not a proper subject for appeal. A district court\u2019s decision not to depart from the Guidelines is not reviewable on appeal unless the court has misapplied the Guidelines, imposed an illegal sentence, or misapprehended its departure authority. <em>See, e.g., United States v. Clark, </em>128 F.3d 122, 124 (2d Cir.1997); <em>United States v. Brown, </em>98 F.3d 690, 692 (2d Cir.1996) (per curiam); <em>United States v. Haynes, </em>985 F.2d 65, 68 (2d Cir.1993). Gil does not contend that the sentence was illegal or resulted from a misapplication of law, and the record reveals that the court plainly understood that it had authority to depart. The court stated that Gil\u2019s situation \u201cdoesn\u2019t rise to the level of extraordinary family circumstances.\u201d In addition, the court stated that it had considered whether a departure might be warranted by a combination of family circumstances and extraordinary cooperation, but had concluded that \u201cit just doesn\u2019t appear that the facts support it.\u201d The court\u2019s refusal to depart is thus not reviewable.</p>\n<p id=\"b494-4\">We have considered all of Gil\u2019s contentions that are properly before us and have found them to be without merit. The judgment of the district court is modified in accordance with the foregoing, and, as modified, is affirmed. The matter is remanded for correction of the judgment to reflect that Gil was sentenced under 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 841(b)(1)(C) rather than \u00a7 841(b)(1)(A), and under 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 960(b)(3) rather than \u00a7 960(b)(1)(A).</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
