We have jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291, and we reverse.</p>\n<p id=\"b622-5\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b622-6\">Shortly after the district court held that Bess\u2019s claims were preempted by ERISA, Bess moved to reconsider in light of this court\u2019s decision in <em>LaVenture v. Prudential Insurance Co. of America, </em>237 F.3d 1042 (9th Cir.2001). <em>LaVenture </em>clearly undermines the basis for the district court\u2019s ruling given our holding that a disability policy purchased by business owners for their sole benefit is not an ERISA plan. <em>Id. </em>at 1047. The district court\u2019s articulated reason for refusing to reconsider \u2014 that Bess was not an owner when the motion for summary judgment was heard \u2014 is beside the point. Accordingly, it was an abuse of discretion not to entertain Bess\u2019s motion for reconsideration. We remand for reconsideration, including for an opportunity for both parties to develop a record in light of <em>LaVenture.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b622-7\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b622-8\">The parties offer competing, not manifestly unreasonable interpretations of the total disability provisions in Bess\u2019s policies and extensive arguments supporting those interpretations. There is no indication that the district court considered and ruled upon the merits of these arguments. <em>See Singleton v. Wulff </em>428 U.S. 106, 120, 96 S.Ct. 2868, 49 L.Ed.2d 826 (1976). While New York Life urges us nevertheless to affirm, we are guided by the California Supreme Court\u2019s admonition that, \u201c[i]n its final analysis, the question of what amounts to total disability is one of fact....\u201d <em>Erreca v. Western States Life Ins. Co., </em>19 Cal.2d 388, 397, 121 P.2d 689 (1942). We cannot say that triable issues do not exist here; therefore, we reverse and remand for further proceedings on the issue of whether Bess is entitled to total disability benefits.</p>\n<p id=\"b622-12\">REVERSED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b621-27\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and may not be cited to or by the courts <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"600\">*600</page-number>of this circuit except as may be provided by Ninth Circuit Rule 36-3.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
