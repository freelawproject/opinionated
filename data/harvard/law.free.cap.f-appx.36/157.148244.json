We dismiss the appeal for lack of jurisdiction because Spillman\u2019s notice of appeal was not timely filed.</p>\n<p id=\"b187-22\">Parties are accorded thirty days after the entry of the district court\u2019s final judgment or order to note an appeal, <em>see </em>Fed. R.App. P. 4(a)(1), unless the district court extends the appeal period under Fed. R.App. P. 4(a)(5) or reopens the appeal period under Fed. R.App. P. 4(a)(6).
