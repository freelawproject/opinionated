Specifically, and in answer to appellant\u2019s only challenge to the district court\u2019s <em>res judicata </em>findings, the parties to this and all of appellant\u2019s previous actions are either identical or in privity. <em>See Sunshine Anthracite Coal Co. v. Adkins, </em>310 U.S. 381, 402, 60 S.Ct. 907, 84 L.Ed. 1263 (1940). Thus, we AFFIRM for substantially the same reasons stated in the district court\u2019s order dated May 29, 2001.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b409-9\"> This order and judgment is not binding precedent, except under the doctrines of law of the case, res judicata, and collateral estoppel. The court generally disfavors the citation of orders and judgments; nevertheless, an order and judgment may be cited under the terms and conditions of 10th Cir. R. 36.3.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b409-10\">. After examining the briefs and appellate record, this panel has determined unanimously that oral argument would not materially assist the determination of this appeal. <em>See </em>Fed. R.App. P. 34(a)(2); 10th Cir. R. 34.1(G). The case is therefore ordered submitted without oral argument.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
