We reject his argument and we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b346-22\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b346-23\">Aquino contends that the district court erred by calculating his sentence using quantities of methamphetamine not charged in the indictment or admitted to at his plea hearing. He relies on <em>Appren-di v. New Jersey, </em>530 U.S. 466, 490, 120 S.Ct. 2348, 147 L.Ed.2d 435 (2000), holding that \u201c[ojther than the fact of a prior conviction, any fact that increases the penalty for a crime beyond the prescribed statutory maximum must be submitted to a jury, and proved beyond a reasonable doubt.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b346-24\"><em>Apprendi </em>does not apply to Aquino\u2019s circumstances. Aquino pleaded guilty to drug offenses that trigger a maximum sentence of life imprisonment. 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 841(b)(1)(A)(viii). Moreover, distribution of any amount of methamphetamine carries a maximum sentence of twenty years. 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 841(b)(1)(C). The district court\u2019s decision to include the additional amount of methamphetamine did not expose Aquino to a sentence that exceeds either of these maximum sentences. Accordingly, there is no <em>Apprendi </em>violation. <em>See United States v. Mendoza-Paz, </em>286 F.3d 1104, 1110-11 (9th Cir.2002); <em>United </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"323\">*323</page-number><em>States v. Okafor, </em>285 F.3d 842, 847 (9th Cir.2002). To the extent that Aquino argues that \u00a7 841 is facially unconstitutional, we rejected that argument in <em>United-States v. Buckland, </em>289 F.3d 558 (9th Cir. 2002) (en banc), <em>cert. denied, </em>2002 WL 764233 (U.S. May 28, 2002).</p>\n<p id=\"b347-5\">Aquino also challenges the district court\u2019s finding that he is responsible for the additional methamphetamine. We already ruled, however, in Aquino\u2019s prior appeal that these additional drugs \u201cwere properly taken into account by the district court when sentencing [Aquino].\u201d <em>See United States v. Aquino, </em>242 F.3d 859, 866 (9th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>533 U.S. 963, 121 S.Ct. 2622, 150 L.Ed.2d 775 (2001). Aquino has not offered any persuasive reason to compel us to depart from our prior decision. <em>See United States v. Scrivner, </em>189 F.3d 825, 827 (9th Cir.1999) (noting exceptions that would permit court to reconsider prior ruling in the same case).</p>\n<p id=\"b347-6\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b346-25\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and may not be cited to or by the courts of this circuit except as may be provided by Ninth Circuit Rule 36-3.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
