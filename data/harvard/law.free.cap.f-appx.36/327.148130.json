We deny Alam\u2019s petition for review.</p>\n<p id=\"b351-26\">Substantial evidence supports the BIA\u2019s conclusion that Alam\u2019s submission of a fraudulent writ that he represented as truthful undermined his asylum claim in its entirety. <em>See Akinmade v. INS, </em>196 F.3d 951, 955-56 (9th Cir.1999). The fraudulent <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"328\">*328</page-number>writ supports an adverse credibility determination because it goes to persecution, one of the critical elements of Alam\u2019s asylum claim. <em>In re O-D-, </em>21 I. <em>&amp; </em>N. Dec. 1079, 1082-83 (BIA 1998). Further, the Immigration Judge gave Alam ample opportunity to explain his submission of the fraudulent writ, but Alam provided no credible explanation for its presentation.</p>\n<p id=\"b352-4\">Because Alam did not meet the standard for granting asylum, it follows that he also did not satisfy the more stringent standard for withholding of deportation. <em>See Mejia-Paiz v. INS, </em>111 F.3d 720, 725 (9th Cir.1997).</p>\n<p id=\"b352-5\">The BIA did not abuse its discretion in denying Alam\u2019s motion to reopen to pursue suspension of deportation and relief under the Convention Against Torture. <em>Israel v. INS, </em>785 F.2d 738, 740 (9th Cir. 1986). With respect to Alam\u2019s suspension of deportation claim, he falls under IIRIRA\u2019s stop-time rule because he did not apply for suspension of deportation until March 3, 1999, almost two years after IIR-IRA\u2019s April 1, 1997 effective date. <em>See Guadalupe-Cruz v. INS, </em>240 F.3d 1209, 1211-12 (9th Cir.), <em>as amended, </em>250 F.3d 1271 (9th Cir.2001). Because seven years did not elapse between Alam\u2019s entry into the United States on August 31, 1989 and the government\u2019s issuance of an Order to Show Cause on February 27, 1996, he does not meet the stop-time rule and is not entitled to suspension of deportation. <em>See Ram v. INS, </em>243 F.3d 510, 513 (9th Cir. 2001). With respect to Alam\u2019s Convention Against Torture claim, Alam\u2019s argument that as a journalist he is likely to face persecution under Pakistan\u2019s totalitarian regime is too generalized to establish pri-ma facie eligibility for that type of relief. <em>See In re S-V-, </em>Int. Dec. 3430 (BIA 2000).</p>\n<p id=\"AFR\">PETITION DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b351-27\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and may not be cited to or by the courts of this circuit except as may be provided by Ninth Circuit Rule 36-3.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
