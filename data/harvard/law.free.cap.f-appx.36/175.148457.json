Brooks moved for dismissal under Federal Rule of Civil <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"176\">*176</page-number>Procedure 12(b)(6), or, alternatively, for dismissal on grounds of qualified immunity. The district court issued a Memorandum of Opinion and Order granting the Rule 12(b)(6) motion for failure to state a claim upon which relief may be granted. Bauer appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b206-4\">We have carefully reviewed the record, the applicable law and the parties\u2019 briefs, and we find that the district court\u2019s opinion carefully and correctly sets out the law governing the issues raised and clearly articulates the reasons underlying its decision to dismiss the complaint. We further find that the issuance of a full written opinion by this court would serve no useful purpose. Accordingly, for the reasons stated in the district court\u2019s opinion, we AFFIRM the judgment.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
