We have jurisdiction pursuant to 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3742(a) and 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b646-4\">Soto contends that 21 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 952 and 960 are unconstitutional pursuant to <em>Ap-prendi v. New Jersey, </em>530 U.S. 466, 120 S.Ct. 2348, 147 L.Ed.2d 435 (2000). Our holdings in <em>United States v. Mendoza-Paz, </em>286 F.3d 1104, 1110 (9th Cir.2002) (\u00a7 960), and <em>United States v. Varela-Rivera, </em>279 F.3d 1174, 1175 n. 1 (9th Cir.2002) (\u00a7 952) foreclose this argument.</p>\n<p id=\"b646-5\">In the alternative, Soto contends that the government was required to allege in the indictment that Soto knew the type and quantity of controlled substance he was alleged to have imported. This contention fails based on our holding in <em>United States v. Carranza, </em>289 F.3d 634, 644 (9th Cir.2002) (holding that <em>Apprendi </em>does not require the government to prove that defendant knew type and amount of controlled substance).</p>\n<p id=\"b646-6\">Soto\u2019s final contention is that the government breached the plea agreement by suggesting during the sentencing hearing that the negotiated criminal history category was insufficient after seeing Soto\u2019s full record in the pre-sentence report. Alleged violations of a plea agreement are reviewed de novo. <em>See United States v. Camarillo-Tello, </em>236 F.3d 1024, 1026 (9th Cir.2001). After reviewing the record, we find that the statements made by the government did not breach the plea agreement. <em>Cf. id. </em>at 1027-28; <em>United States v. Johnson, </em>187 F.3d 1129, 1135 (9th Cir. 1999); <em>United States v. Myers, </em>32 F.3d 411, 412-13 (9th Cir.1994) (per curiam).</p>\n<p id=\"b646-10\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b645-39\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and may not be cited to or by the courts of this circuit except as may be provided by 9th Cir.
