On appeal, defendants challenge the district court\u2019s determinations on join-der and severance, sufficiency of the evidence, admission of certain evidence, jury instructions, and sentencing. The appellants also allege prosecutorial animus. This Court affirms the district court on each of the issues addressed in this summary order for substantially the same reasons stated by the district court.</p>\n<p id=\"b35-7\">For the reasons set forth above, the judgment of the district court is AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
