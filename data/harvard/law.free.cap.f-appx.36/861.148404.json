The district court denied relief, and we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b884-17\">An investigation into drug trafficking at the Wabash Valley Correctional Facility led to a disciplinary charge against Mr. Schlomer for aiding in money laundering. A conduct adjustment board held a hearing and found Mr. Schlomer guilty based on an internal-affairs investigative file and report submitted by prison officials in support of the charging conduct report. According to the investigation report, authorities initially learned from a confidential informant that Mr. Schlomer regularly trafficked contraband within the prison, and then through follow-up investigation discovered that Mr. Schlomer received money from other inmates through \u201coutside associates.\u201d The investigation report recounts, for example, that on October 30, 1999, Mr. Schlomer and a \u201cfemale subject\u201d discussed sending $150 to an \u201caffiliate\u201d of another inmate at the prison. Telephone logs contained in the internal-affairs file attached to the conduct report reveal that the \u201cfemale subject\u201d was Mr. Schlomer\u2019s daughter and also document a second exchange of money between Mr. Schlomer <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"863\">*863</page-number>and another inmate. A copy of a personal check in the file made out to Mr. Schlomer\u2019s daughter for $100 accounts for a third transaction, and the investigating officer\u2019s affidavit evidences a fourth and a fifth. Investigating officer Randy Rasner also attests to the discovery of 56.8 grams of marijuana in Mr. Schlomer\u2019s cell.</p>\n<p id=\"b885-5\">At his hearing Mr. Schlomer denied the investigating officer\u2019s written account and maintained that the prison\u2019s audio recording of his October 30 telephone call would prove the telephone logs in the internal-affairs file were inaccurate. But, according to Mr. Schlomer, the board did not listen to the tape, and he appealed to the warden. The warden downgraded the money laundering charge to \u201cgiving to or accepting from any person\u201d a thing of value \u201cwithout proper authorization\u201d and also reduced Mr. Schlomer\u2019s sentence to one year in segregation and a 90-day loss of good-time credits. After Mr. Schlomer appealed again, this time without success, he commenced the present action in the district court. Because he suffered a loss of good-time credits, his petition was properly brought under \u00a7 2254, <em>see Montgomery v. Anderson, </em>262 F.3d 641, 643 (7th Cir.2001), and the hearing held before the board had to comply with due process, <em>see Superintendent of Mass. Dep\u2019t of Corr. v. Hill, </em>472 U.S. 445, 454, 105 S.Ct. 2768, 86 L.Ed.2d 356 (1985); <em>Wolff v. McDonnell, </em>418 U.S. 539, 563-67, 94 S.Ct. 2963, 41 L.Ed.2d 935 (1974).</p>\n<p id=\"b885-6\">On appeal Mr. Schlomer argues that he received inadequate process for three reasons, each of which is without merit. First he contends that the evidence before the board was not sufficient to convict him of giving or accepting something of value without authorization. But to satisfy due process the board\u2019s decision requires only the support of \u201csome evidence,\u201d <em>Hill, </em>472 U.S. at 455-56, 105 S.Ct. 2768, and that standard is met even by \u201cmeager proof,\u201d <em>Webb v. Anderson, </em>224 F.3d 649, 652 (7th Cir.2000); <em>see also McPherson v. McBride, </em>188 F.3d 784, 786 (7th Cir.1999). Here the investigation report and contents of the internal-affairs file evidence that in less than six weeks Mr. Schlomer\u2019s daughter five times exchanged money with someone connected to an inmate at the prison. Although one or two exchanges might not mean anything, the number of transactions supports an inference that Mr. Schlomer was transacting business in the prison and collecting payment through his daughter. Coupled with the informant\u2019s tip that Mr. Schlomer regularly trafficked contraband and the marijuana found in Mr. Schlomer\u2019s cell, there is some evidence that Mr. Schlomer traded some commodity without authorization and used his daughter to collect or make payments.</p>\n<p id=\"b885-8\">Mr. Schlomer next argues that the board did not adequately explain why it found him guilty. The board\u2019s announcement that \u201c[bjased on [the] Conduct Report [and] Reported Investigation of Randy Rasner. we find Schlomer guilty\u201d is brief, but it is sufficient given the complexity of Mr. Schlomer\u2019s case. <em>See Pardo v. Hosier, </em>946 F.2d 1278, 1285 (7th Cir.1991); <em>Culbert v. Young, </em>834 F.2d 624, 631 (7th Cir.1987); <em>Saenz v. Young, </em>811 F.2d 1172, 1174 (7th Cir.1987). In a simple case involving a dispute over the relative credibility of an investigator\u2019s report and the prisoner\u2019s account of what happened, the board may properly refer to the report as the sole basis for its decision. <em>See Culbert, </em>834 F.2d at 631; <em>Saenz, </em>811 F.2d at 1174. Here no mystery surrounds the board\u2019s reasoning process, so its statement, while spare, meets constitutional requirements.</p>\n<p id=\"b885-9\">Mr. Schlomer\u2019s final argument is also without merit. He submits that pris<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"864\">*864</page-number>on officials should have retrieved and listened to the audio tape of his October 30 conversation with his daughter. The district court apparently dismissed this contention on the erroneous theory that the substance of the telephone call was undisputed. In fact, Mr. Schlomer strenuously contested the investigator\u2019s account of his call and told the board that the tape would show inaccuracies in the prison telephone logs. Nevertheless, Mr. Schlomer\u2019s protestations do not entitle him to relief, for there is no evidence that Mr. Schlomer took advantage of his opportunity during pre-screening to request the tape. Mr. Schlomer now asserts that he made an oral demand that went undocumented by the screening officer, but he forfeited any such argument by not raising it in his administrative appeals. <em>See Eads v. Hanks, </em>280 F.3d 728 (7th Cir.2002).</p>\n<p id=\"b886-4\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
