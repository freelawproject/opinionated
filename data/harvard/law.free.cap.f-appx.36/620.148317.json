We have jurisdiction pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2253, review de novo, <em>see Patterson v. Stewart, </em>251 F.3d 1243, 1245 (9th Cir.), <em>cert denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. \u2014, 122 S.Ct. 406, 151 L.Ed.2d 308 (2001), and affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b642-27\">Under \u00a7 2244(d)(1) of the AEDPA, Holloway had until May 6, 1998, to file his 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254 petition. Absent tolling of the statute of limitations, therefore, Holloway\u2019s petition filed March 29, 2000, is untimely.</p>\n<p id=\"b642-28\">Holloway contends that the district court erred by not granting him statutory or equitable tolling based on his claim the state failed to provide an adequate law library and trained library clerks. We reject Holloway\u2019s contention because he has failed to allege sufficient facts to demonstrate that extraordinary circumstances beyond his control made it impossible for him to file his petition on time. <em>Cf, Wha-lem/Hunt v. Early, </em>233 F.3d 1146 (9th <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"621\">*621</page-number>Cir.2000) (en banc) (per curiam).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"A0Z\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b642-29\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and may not be cited to or by the courts of this circuit except as may be provided by 9th Cir. R. 36-3.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b643-19\">. We do not reach Holloway\u2019s apparent contention that he was denied access to the courts because it is more appropriately raised in an action under 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983. <em>See Taylor v. List, </em>880 F.2d 1040, 1046 (9th Cir. 1989) (discussing access to courts claim in the context of a \u00a7 1983 action).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
