We have jurisdiction pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291, and we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b643-21\">Verduzco-Higuera contends that 21 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 841, 952 and 960 are unconstitutional pursuant to <em>Apprendi v. New Jersey, </em>530 U.S. 466, 120 S.Ct. 2348, 147 L.Ed.2d 435 (2000). Our holdings in <em>United States v. Buckland, </em>289 F.3d 558, 564 (9th Cir.2002), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S.\u2014, 122 S.Ct. 2314, \u2014 L.Ed.2d \u2014 (2002) (\u00a7 841); <em>United States v. Mendoza-Paz, </em>286 F.3d 1104, 1110 (9th Cir.2002) (\u00a7 960), and <em>United States v. Varela-Rivera, </em>279 F.3d 1174, 1175 n. 1 (9th Cir.2002) (\u00a7 952) foreclose this argument.</p>\n<p id=\"b643-25\">In the alternative, Verduzco-Higuera contends that the government was required to allege in the indictment that Verduzco-Higuera knew the type and quantity of controlled substance he was alleged to have imported. Verduzco-Higu-era raised this argument for the first time in his reply brief. Accordingly, we will not review the claim. <em>See United States v. Bentson, </em>947 F.2d 1353, 1356 (9th Cir. 1991). Moreover, even if the issue were properly before us, we would still affirm the district court. <em>See United States v. Carranza, </em>289 F.3d 634, 644 (9th Cir.2002) (holding that <em>Apprendi </em>does not require the government to prove that defendant knew type and amount of controlled substance).</p>\n<p id=\"b643-26\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b643-29\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and may not be cited to or by the courts of this circuit except as may be provided by 9th Cir.
