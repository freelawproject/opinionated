We have reviewed the record and the district court\u2019s order and find no reversible error in the denial of \u00a7 2255 relief.</p>\n<p id=\"b544-23\">On appeal, Stewart asserts that, because the jury rendered a general verdict of guilty on the charge of conspiracy to distribute cocaine, crack cocaine, and marijuana, his 324-month sentence exceeds the five-year statutory maximum in 21 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 841(b)(1)(D) (West 1999 &amp; Supp.2001), for marijuana offenses involving less than fifty kilograms (the least-punished object of the conspiracy) and that, under <em>United States v. Rhynes, </em>196 F.3d 207 (4th Cir.1999), <em>vacated in part on other grounds, </em>218 F.3d 310 (4th Cir.) (en banc), <em>cert. denied, </em>530 U.S. 1222, 120 S.Ct. 2235, 147 L.Ed.2d 263 (2000), he should be re-sentenced. He also asserts that counsel provided ineffective assistance by failing to raise the issue on direct appeal.<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"521\">*521</page-number><footnotemark>*</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b545-5\">We conclude that Stewart has failed to show cause and prejudice under <em>United States v. Frady, </em>456 U.S. 152, 167-68, 102 S.Ct. 1584, 71 L.Ed.2d 816 (1982), to excuse his failure to raise on direct appeal his claim under <em>Rhynes. </em>We further conclude that counsel did not provide ineffective assistance by failing to raise the <em>Rhynes </em>issue in the trial court or on appeal because counsel was not required to anticipate the rule that was subsequently announced in <em>Rhynes. </em>In addition, because we find no exceptional circumstances, we decline to review Stewart\u2019s claims raised for the first time on appeal. <em>See Muth v. United States, </em>1 F.3d 246, 250 (4th Cir.1993).</p>\n<p id=\"b545-6\">Accordingly, we deny Stewart\u2019s motion for appointment of counsel, deny a certificate of appealability, and dismiss the appeal substantially on the reasoning of the district court. <em>United States v. Stewart, </em>Nos. CR-95-320; CA-00-429-5-22 (D.S.C. Aug. 29, 2001). We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b545-7\">\n<em>DISMISSED.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b545-9\"> In addition to this <em>Rhynes </em>claim, Stewart\u2019s \u00a7 2255 motion also alleged ineffective assistance of counsel for failure to object to the court\u2019s inclusion of a 1989 Florida conviction in computing his criminal history points. Stewart does not challenge on appeal the district court\u2019s dismissal of this claim. We therefore dismiss Stewart\u2019s appeal as to this claim. <em>See </em>4th Cir. R. 34(b).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
