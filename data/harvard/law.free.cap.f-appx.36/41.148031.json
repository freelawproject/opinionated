On June 18, 1992, Dickerson was convicted in a Delaware Superior Court of first degree murder and possession of a deadly weapon during the commission of a felony. On September 14, 1992, Dickerson was sentenced to life imprisonment for his murder conviction and 20 years imprisonment for the weapons conviction. On December 21, 1993, the Delaware Supreme Court affirmed his conviction and sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b72-7\">On January 13, 1995, Dickerson filed an application for post-conviction relief in the Superior Court of Delaware, asserting a claim of ineffective assistance of trial counsel, which the Superior Court denied. On appeal, the Delaware Supreme Court remanded the case to the Superior Court for an evidentiary hearing. The Superior Court held a hearing and again denied the claim. The Delaware Supreme Court affirmed the Superior Court\u2019s decision on January 7, 1998. On September 1, 1998, Dickerson filed a petition for a writ of habeas corpus with the District Court. The court denied the petition on December 10,1999. This appeal followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b72-8\">Prior to his trial, Dickerson told his counsel that the arresting officer, in the cours of attempting to obtain a statement from him, informed Dickerson that his co-defendants had taken lie d\u00e9teetor tests and passed. During cross-examination at trial, Dickerson\u2019s counsel questioned the officer as to whether he had made such a statement. The officer denied ever having made such a statement. There was no mention of lie detector tests during the trial. Neither of Dickerson\u2019s codefendants had ever taken a lie detector test, but they were called as witnesses at Dickerson\u2019s trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b72-12\">On appeal, Dickerson again claims prejudice due to ineffective assistance of counsel. He bases this claim on his counsel\u2019s cross-examination of the arresting officer concerning the lie detector tests. Dickerson claims that by questioning the officer about lie detector tests, his counsel introduced to the jury matters which were not properly admissible as evidence. He further claims that the improper admission of this evidence, left uncorrected by the Trial Court, served to bolster the credibility of the prosecution\u2019s witnesses, thereby causing prejudice.</p>\n<p id=\"b72-13\">In reviewing the actions of counsel at trial, there is a strong presumption that the representation was reasonably made. <em>Strickland v. Washington, </em>466 U.S. 668, 689, 104 S.Ct. 2052, 80 L.Ed.2d 674 (1984). In applying Strickland, we have stated that proof of an ineffective assistance of counsel claim requires first, that the attorney\u2019s performance was deficient, and, second, that the errors prejudiced the defense. <em>Wells v. Petsock, </em>941 F.2d 253, 259 (3d Cir.1991).</p>\n<p id=\"b72-14\">In examining this issue, the District Court found that defense counsel\u2019s poorly phrased question concerning lie detector tests, with no other mention of the tests throughout the rest of the trial, was not enough to render his counsel\u2019s assistance constitutionally deficient. We agree. The <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"43\">*43</page-number>record indicates that the questioning by counsel was an attempt to establish that the police were improperly aggressive in trying to obtain a statement from Dickerson. Furthermore, the District Court found that any inference that might have been created by counsel\u2019s question about a lie detector test was mitigated by the jury\u2019s ability to independently assess the credibility of the witnesses to whom the tests were allegedly administered. Dickerson has failed to demonstrate that his attorney\u2019s performance was deficient.</p>\n<p id=\"b73-5\">For the foregoing reasons, we will affirm the judgment of the District Court.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
