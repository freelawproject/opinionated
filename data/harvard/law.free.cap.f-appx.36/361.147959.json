R.App. P. 34(a)(2). The case is, therefore, ordered submitted without oral argument.</p>\n<p id=\"b386-9\">Billy Brown, a state prisoner proceeding pro se, brought this action in forma pau-peris under 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983 alleging constitutional violations from the conduct of prison officials with respect to Mr. Brown\u2019s mail. In his original complaint, Mr. Brown contended that on August 13 and on August 28, 2000, prison officials mishandled correspondence with his attorney (the \u201clegal correspondence\u201d). In his amended complaint, Mr. Brown alleged that prison officials opened and reviewed a privileged letter from a radio station addressed to him on November 16, 2000 and also unlawfully intercepted a outgoing letter to the same radio station (the \u201cmedia correspondence\u201d). The district court sua sponte dismissed, with prejudice, Mr. Brown\u2019s claims regarding the media correspondence, <em>see </em>28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(e)(2), but did not address the allegations concerning the legal correspondence. Mr. Brown appeals this decision and seeks leave to proceed in forma pauperis. For the reasons stated below we affirm the district court\u2019s dismissal and deny Mr. Brown\u2019s request to proceed in forma pauperis.</p>\n<p id=\"b386-12\">I. DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"ANQ\">A. Legal Correspondence</p>\n<p id=\"b386-13\">In his original complaint, Mr. Brown contended that (1) on August 13, 2000 prison officials intercepted a package from his lawyer; and (2) that on August 28, 2000, prison officials mishandled, opened, withheld and altered correspondence from his attorney. He also contends that he sought administrative relief on these claims. Mr. Brown\u2019s attorney supplies an affidavit stating that he sent his client a copy of a petition for review of the denial of post-conviction relief in Oregon. Mr. Brown\u2019s counsel also filed the petition with the Oregon Supreme Court. Mr. Brown\u2019s attorney learned a month later that his client never received the correspondence.</p>\n<p id=\"b386-14\">The Defendants suggest that we need not consider the allegations regarding tampering with legal correspondence, as they were part of the initial complaint only, and Mr. Brown failed to reallege them in the amended complaint. <em>See </em>Fed.R.Civ.P. 10(c). We are mindful of our duty to liberally construe pleadings of pro se litigants. <em>See Meade v. Grubbs, </em>841 F.2d 1512, 1526 (10th Cir.1988). At the same time, we acknowledge that such litigants must adhere to the same rules of procedure as other litigants. <em>See Green v. Dorrell, </em>969 F.2d 915, 917 (10th Cir.1992). Also, we need not manufacture issues for <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"363\">*363</page-number>pro se parties. <em>See National Commodity and Barter Ass\u2019n v. Gibbs, </em>886 F.2d 1240, 1244 (10th Cir.1989). Nevertheless, because Mr. Brown\u2019s amended complaint clearly expresses the intention to \u201cadd[ ] a claim,\u201d Rec. doc. 9, at 1, we shall address all of his contentions.</p>\n<p id=\"b387-5\">The Defendants note that as to the August 13, 2000 package that was apparently lost, there was no deprivation of constitutional rights. They assert that because his attorney filed the document in Oregon state court, Mr. Brown cannot claim denial of access to the courts. <em>See Lewis v. Casey, </em>518 U.S. 343, 350-51, 116 S.Ct. 2174, 135 L.Ed.2d 606 (1996) (noting that inmates have a right to receive legal advice from other inmates only when it is a necessary \u201cmeans for ensuring a \u2018reasonably adequate opportunity to present claimed violations of fundamental constitutional rights to the courts.\u2019 \u201d) (quoting <em>Bounds v. Smith, </em>430 U.S. 817, 825, 97 S.Ct. 1491, 52 L.Ed.2d 72 (1977)). Similarly, Defendants claim there is no First Amendment violation because there is no evidence of improper motive.</p>\n<p id=\"b387-6\">Regarding the August 28, 2000 package, Defendants admit to opening this package in Mr. Brown\u2019s presence. The package, however, was not marked as legal mail and had no return address on the outside of the box to suggest the return address.</p>\n<p id=\"b387-7\">We review de novo the district court\u2019s decision to dismiss the complaint under \u00a7 1915(e)(2), taking the allegations of the complaint as true. <em>See Curley v. Perry, </em>246 F.3d 1278, 1281 (10th Cir.2001). There is no evidence that the Defendants caused any interference with either the August 13 or the August 28, 2000 package. The Oregon court received the petition, so the loss of the August 13 package did not constitute interference with Mr. Brown\u2019s access to the courts. Likewise, there is no evidence of improper motive, so Mr. Brown cannot assert a First Amendment violation. The district court properly dismissed Mr. Brown\u2019s claims with respect to the August 13 package.</p>\n<p id=\"b387-9\">Additionally we note that Mr. Brown ultimately received the August 28, 2000 package. We agree with the Defendants that the August 28, 2000 incident was \u201can isolated incident, without any evidence of improper motive or resulting interference with [Mr. Brown\u2019s] right to counsel or to access to the courts.\u201d <em>Smith v. Maschner, </em>899 F.2d 940, 944 (10th Cir.1990). In addition, prison officials may open an inmate\u2019s incoming legal mail to search for contraband in the presence of the inmate. <em>See Wolff v. McDonnell, </em>418 U.S. 539, 577, 94 S.Ct. 2963, 41 L.Ed.2d 935 (1974). Because the August 28, 2000 package was opened in Mr. Brown\u2019s presence, this incident \u201cdoes not give rise to a constitutional violation.\u201d <em>Smith, </em>899 F.2d at 944.</p>\n<p id=\"b387-10\">B. Media Correspondence</p>\n<p id=\"b387-11\">In his amended complaint, Mr. Brown included allegations that prison officials unlawfully opened correspondence addressed to him from a radio station and intercepted an outgoing letter to the same address. We agree with the district court\u2019s conclusions that the interception of the of the two items was reasonable. The incoming letter contained a check for Mr. Brown and was sent by his godmother, who worked at the radio station. Although inmates are generally allowed to correspond with the media, the correspondence was with Mr. Brown\u2019s godmother and was of a personal nature. The Defendants may regulate correspondence thought to be disguised as privileged media mail. <em>See Guajardo v. Estelle, </em>580 F.2d 748, 759 (5th Cir.1978) (noting that the district court\u2019s decision did \u201cnot permit wholesale sending and receiving of mail to any address purporting to be that of a media representative\u201d and that \u201cprison authorities may have a reasonable time, when necessary, to verify that the address<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"364\">*364</page-number>ee reflected on the face of an envelope is actually a member of the editorial or reporting staff of a media organization\u201d). Likewise, we have stated that \u201c[i]n the case of unprivileged incoming and outgoing prison mail, regulation by prison officials is \u2018essentially an administrative matter in which the courts will not intervene.\u2019\u201d <em>United States, v. Gordon, </em>168 F.3d 1222, 1228 (10th Cir.1999) (quoting <em>Wilkerson v. Warden of U.S. Reformatory, El Reno, </em>465 F.2d 956, 957 (10th Cir.1972)).</p>\n<p id=\"b388-4\">II. CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b388-5\">We have carefully reviewed Mr. Brown\u2019s complaints and the record. For substantially the same reasons underlying the district court\u2019s May 22, 2001 Order, we affirm the dismissal of Mr. Brown\u2019s frivolous petition pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(e)(2) and we deny Mr. Brown\u2019s motion to proceed in forma pauperis. Mr. Brown is advised that he must submit immediate payment of the unpaid balance due in this appeal.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b386-10\"> This order and judgment is not binding precedent, except under the doctrines of res judica-ta, collateral estoppel, and law of the case. The court generally disfavors the citation of orders and judgments; nevertheless, an order and judgment may be cited under the terms and conditions of 10th Cir. R. 36.3.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
