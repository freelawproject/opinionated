Y. S. 1147; <em>Sheridan </em>v. <em>Sheridan, </em>58 Yt. 504. ' The demurrer admits the law of a foreign state and the facts as stated in the declaration whether stated argumentatively or directly. Actions in this State upon foreign statutes are upheld. The nature of the remedy or the jurisdiction of the courts to enforce it is not under international comity dependent upon the question whether it is a statutory or common law right, <em>McLeod </em>v. <em>Railroad Co., </em>58 Yt. 727; <em>Cady </em>v. <em>Sanford, </em>53 Yt. 632.

If the stockholder was only liable in proportion to the stock held by him, a resort to chancery might be necessary, but this statute makes the stockholder individually liable for the debts for an amount equal to the par value of his stock. The liability is fixed and does not depend upon the liability of other stockholders. <em>Handy </em>v. <em>Draper, </em>89 N. Y. 334; <em>Bank </em>v. <em>Bliss, </em>35 N.

St. Repts. 414.</p>\n<p id=\"b396-8\">Assuming the liability under the constitutional provision in question to be contractual in nature, and to be construed by the laws of Nebraska, the form of remedy, and the mode of proceeding, are regulated by the laws of the place where the action is instituted: Story on Conflict of Laws, \u00a7 556; <em>Harrison </em>v. <em>Edwards, </em>12 Vt. 648; and if the constitution or statutes of the state of Nebraska contain provisions <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"381\">*381</page-number>prescribing a specific remedy for enforcing this liability, such provisions have no extraterritorial force and we are not affected thereby. 2 Morawetz on Corp. \u00a7 876.</p>\n<p id=\"b397-5\">The statutes of this State contain no provisions creating any new remedy at law, or enlarging or changing the \u25a0common law remedy, if such exists, upon such a constitutional or statutory liability. In that regard, a receiver has no remedy at law, other than such as is given him by the common law.</p>\n<p id=\"b397-6\">It is fundamental that to authorize a party to sue at law in his own name, he must have the legal title to the matter or thing in controversy, and no exception to this rule exists, at common law, as to suits brought by a receiver. He can maintain an action at law in his own name only when he has in himself the legal title. High on Receivers, \u00a7 220; <em>Newell </em>v. <em>Fisher, </em>24 Miss. 392; <em>Yearger </em>v. <em>Wallace, </em>44 Pa. St. 294.</p>\n<p id=\"b397-7\">A receiver derives his authority from the court appointing him, and his possession of property and property rights, is the poss\u00e9ssion of the court for the benefit of whomsoever the same shall ultimately be adjudged to belong. The title thereto is unchanged. <em>Chicago Union Bank </em>v. <em>Kansas City Bank, </em>136 U. S. 236.</p>\n<p id=\"b397-8\">The liability under the constitutional provision upon which this action is based, is for the benefit of creditors, and the allegations in the declaration do not show the receiver to have such a legal title as will enable him to maintain an action at law in his own name, in this State, for its enforcement.</p>\n<p id=\"b397-9\">\n<em>Judgment affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
