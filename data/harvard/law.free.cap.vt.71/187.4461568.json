The plaintiff claims to recover for five thousand pounds of milk and some hemlock bark disposed of by the defendant in the year 1896. The milk was delivered to a cheese factory, and the avails taken by the defendant. The bark was peeled from some hemlock cut by the defendant in June, 1896, and was sold by the defendant in the fall of that year. The defendant received $50 for the milk and $15 for the bark. He has not accounted to the plaintiff for these sums, otherwise than by meeting his payments for the year. June 6, 1896, the plaintiff received $50 in payment of the note due June 1st, 1896. November 28, 1896, he received $73 to apply on the interest due December 1st, 1896. April 22, 1897, he received on wood sold $47.10, balance due on interest of December 1st, 1896. This suitwas brought November 18, 1897. The reservation covering this property is that it shall be and remain the plaintiff\u2019s \u201ctill said payments are made.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b204-8\">The court construed this to mean the payments for the year, and rendered judgment for the defendant.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b204-9\"><em>E.

The bond also provides, that the defendant shall give a mortgage to secure the balance of the debt; and that the crops raised on the farm, all butter and income from the cows, all wood, bark and lumber cut on the farm, shall be and remain the plaintiff\u2019s until \u201csaid payments are made.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b205-5\">The defendant contends, that,- by this condition, a lien is reserved only on property mentioned therein, for the payment due, or to become due, the year in which such property is produced from the farm and cows; but we think this is not the true construction of the reservation. When payments aggregating nine hundred dollars of the principal and interest on the whole debt have been made, the -property is to be conveyed. Then follows the reservation, which continues in force until the \u201csaid payments are made.\u201d The words, \u201csaid payments,\u201d clearly refer to the payments that make the sum of nine hundred dollars, and are to be made before the plaintiff is under any obligation to convey the property; and the plaintiff\u2019s lien continues and attaches to all crops raised on the farm, all butter and income from the cows, all wood, bark and lumber cut on the farm, until the full sum of nine hundred dollars is paid, and is not terminated as to property produced in any one year, on payment of the sum falling due during that year.</p>\n<p id=\"b205-6\">\n<em>Judgment reversed; judgment for the plaintiff.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
