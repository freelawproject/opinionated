There is no statute on the subject, and unless it is an offense by the common law of England, the conviction cannot be sustained. If it is an offense at common law, such provision of that law is applicable to our local situation and circumstances and not repugnant to our constitution or laws, in so far as it makes sodomy a criminal offense, and is, therefore, the law of this State. V. S. 898.</p>\n<p id=\"b328-7\">In 1 Hawkin\u2019s Pleas of the Crown (6th ed.) 99, it is said that sodomy was felony by the ancient common law. In 12 Coke 36 and 37, speaking of this offense, it is said: \u2018 \u2018It appears by the ancient authorities of law that this was felony, but they vary in the punishment.\u201d See 3 Coke\u2019s Inst. 58; and note a, 1 Russ. Crimes (8th Am. ed. with Greaves\u2019s, Davis &amp; Metcalf\u2019s and Sherwood\u2019s notes) 697. 25 Hen. VIII., c. 6, which made this crime a capital offense, clearly recognized that it was then a criminal offense by declaring in the preamble to that statute that \u201cthere is not yet sufficient and condign punishment appointed and limited by the due course of the laws of this realm for the detestable and abominable vice of buggery committed with mankind or beast, etc.\u201d Bishop says the effect of this statute was merely to settle the question that this offense is a felony punishable in the same way as other felonies. Bish. Cr. Pr. \u00a7 966. Bishop further says it was an offense at common law, and consequently is an offense in those states adopting the common law. 1 Bish. Cr. Law (7th ed.) \u00a7 503; (4th ed.) \u00a7 948. To the same effect are <em>State </em>v. <em>Place, </em>5 Wash. 774 (1893); and <em>State </em>v. <em>Frank, </em>103 Mo. 122. We think it <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"313\">*313</page-number>clear tbat it was a crime at common law, and, therefore, is a criminal offense in this State. There being no punishment prescribed by statute, the punishment is fine or imprisonment, or both, in the discretion of the court; but imprisonment, if imposed, must be in the house of correction. V. S. 5170.</p>\n<p id=\"b329-5\">\n<em>Judgment of guilty on verdict. Let sentence be pronounced and execution thereof done.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
