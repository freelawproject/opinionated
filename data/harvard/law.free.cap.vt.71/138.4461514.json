The testimony may have been inadmissible, but it could have done no harm, as the plaintiff subsequently conceded that the value should be treated as a certain larger sum, and it was so treated by the jury.</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b154-11\"><em>Discrediting Party on Cross-Examination. </em>\u2014 The plaintiff was entitled to discredit the defendant upon cross-examination by showing that the defendant\u2019s own version of the alleged fraudulent transaction was unnatural and unworthy of belief.</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b154-12\"><em>Damages. </em>\u2014 The rule of damages announced when the case was here before \u201469 Yt. 210 \u2014 was properly followed upon retrial below, the facts developed on both trials being essentially the same.</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b154-13\"><em>Deceit. </em>\u2014 The defendant was not entitled to an instruction that the plaintiff could not recover if it should be found that the policy was read to him by the defendant; for there may be an actionable deceit concerning a technical writing whose terms are made known.</headnotes>\n<summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b154-14\">Case. Trial by jury at the December term, ,1897, Caledonia county, <em>Thompson, </em>J., presiding. Verdict and judgment for the plaintiff. The defendant excepted.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b155-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"139\">*139</page-number>This was a second trial of the case reported in 69 Vt. 210, and the tendency of the plaintiffs evidence was the same as at the first trial. It did not appear that the plaintiff ever expressly refused to pay further premiums or offered to return the policy.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b155-5\">The defendant\u2019s requests were as follows: (1) The plaintiff having failed t o prove a rescission of the contract the case affords no basis for a computation of damages beyond a nominal amount. (2) But if the court hold that the plaintiff is entitled to actual damages, then the defendant is entitled to recover the difference in value between the policy that he in fact received and the policy that was represented to him by the defendant for the period of two years \u2014 two years being the term of the policy under the election of the plaintiff, he having elected to forfeit it at the end of that term. (3) That the sale was not complete as between these parties until the delivery and acceptance of the policy by McKindly, and if the jury find the defendant read over the policy to the plaintiff, as his evidence tends to show, the plaintiff cannot recover.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b155-7\">Upon the subject of the third request, the court charged that the contract was not completed until the policy was delivered to the plaintiff, and that if at the time of the delivery the defendant read it and made its meaning clear to the plaintiff, he would not be liable even if he had previously deceived the plaintiff; but that if in spite of such reading and explanation the defendant saw that the plaintiff was still laboring under the false impression which the defendant had previously and fraudulently made upon his mind, such reading and explanation would not purge the transaction of fraud.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b155-8\">The question of damages was submitted in accordance with the rule laid down by the supreme court, 69 Yt. 210.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b155-9\"><em>Dunnett &amp; Slack </em>for the defendant.</attorneys>\n<attorneys data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b155-10\"><em>W. P. Stafford </em>for the plaintiff.</attorneys>\n<opinion data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"AIA\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"140\">*140</page-number>Munson, J.</author>\n<p id=\"AFD\">The plaintiff was permitted to testify that after paying the second premium and before the third became due, he read his policy through for the first time because of something he had heard, and that, not being able to understand it, he consulted counsel, and learned that it did not contain the guaranty nor permit the withdrawal which the defendant represented it did. The defendant claims that it was error to permit the plaintiff to state what he learned from his counsel. In view of the plaintiff\u2019s payment of the second premium it was permissible for him to show when he first learned of the deceit; and while this might have been done without repeating the statement of counsel, there was nothing prejudicial in the repetition, for it covered no more than was apparent from the policy, upon a construction conceded by the defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b156-5\">One John H. Nelson was produced by the plaintiff, and testified that having just made application at his own house for apolicyliketheonein question, he went with the defendant at his request to the plaintiff\u2019s house, and was present at the opening of the interview between the parties. He afterwards testified, on cross-examination as is apparent from the question objected to, that he told the plaintiff what he thought of the policy. The plaintiff was then permitted to ask the witness what he told the plaintiff that he thought of it, and the witness replied that he told him that he had taken out the same policy himself, and that he thought it was a good investment. If the allowance of the question was a technical error, it is certain that the answer cannot have harmed the defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b156-6\">The plaintiff was permitted, as a basis for estimating the damages, to show by a former representative of the Equitable Insurance Company that the cheapest policy that that company would have issued to insure the plaintiff for the two years in question would have cost a certain sum. Plaintiff\u2019s counsel afterwards conceded that in arriving at the damages the cost should be figured at a larger sum; <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"141\">*141</page-number>and the case was submitted to the jury upon the basis of this concession, and a verdict was returned accordingly. The evidence may have been improperly admitted, but if inadmissible it was rendered harmless by the action subsequently taken.</p>\n<p id=\"b157-5\">In giving his account of the interview in which the representations declared upon were claimed to have been made, the defendant testified that he told the plaintiff that the policy would be worth a certain sum \u201cjudged by the past experience of the company.\u201d The plaintiff was then permitted to draw from the defendant that the first policy of this kind that -he knew of the company\u2019s issuing might have been as late as 1888, and that at the time he took plaintiffs application he did not know any policy of that class had matured or run twenty years, and that he could not have told that any had run ten years. The defendant claims that this was error because the representation so discredited was not one declared upon. But we think the plaintiff was clearly entitled to discredit the defendant by cross-examination upon any matter which he had testified to having stated in connection with the representations complained of.</p>\n<p id=\"b157-6\">The defendant claims it was error to permit the plaintiff to put in evidence certain parts of a rate book of the Mutual Life which the defendant had produced as the one he used in his interview with the plaintiff. The book being referred to and not produced, the exception need not be considered.</p>\n<p id=\"b157-7\">The court could not have complied with the defendant\u2019s first two requests to charge without disregarding our former holding in the same, case as reported in the 69 Yt. 210. The defendant\u2019s claim that the ease presented by the exceptions is not within that holding is not sustainable, as will sufficiently appear from a comparison of the cases.</p>\n<p id=\"b157-8\">The defendant was not entitled to a compliance with his third request as drawn, nor to more of the instruction asked than was given. It was not true that the plaintiff <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"142\">*142</page-number>could not Have recovered, if it were found that the defendant read the policy to him. There can be an actionable deceit concerning a technical writing whose terms are made known. Bigelow on Fraud, <em>507; Calkins </em>v. <em>The State, </em>13 Wis. 389. The further charge upon the subject, which is criticised in the brief, was not excepted to.</p>\n<p id=\"b158-3\">\n<em>Judgment affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
