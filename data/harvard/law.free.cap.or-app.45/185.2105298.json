He partially complied for several years and, sometime in 1974, ceased payment altogether. In April, 1975, an indictment for criminal nonsupport was issued and Reed was extradited from California and arraigned in August, 1975. At arraignment, pursuant to a plea bargain, Reed pled guilty to a lesser crime of criminal mistreatment and was sentenced to probation for two years, conditioned on his <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"188\">*188</page-number>fulfilling certain requirements, including paying $50 per month child support, keeping the court posted as to his whereabouts and reimbursing the court for the cost of his court-appointed attorney.</p>\n<p id=\"b216-3\">In February, 1976, an order to show cause why his probation should not be revoked and a bench warrant were issued for Reed. He did not appear until July, 1978, at which time the proceedings were continued. In October, 1978, a second indictment for criminal nonsupport and a second show cause order were issued. Shortly thereafter, Reed filed his petition for post-conviction relief attacking the first conviction. In January 1979, the post-conviction court sustained the state\u2019s demurrer to the petition on the grounds (a) that Reed could not challenge the constitutionality of ORS 163.555 because it did not form the basis of his conviction, and (b) that the allegation that the state had withheld exculpatory that Reed\u2019s ex-wife had continuously attempted to deny Reed his \"parental rights\u201d by preventing him from visiting his son and prejudicing the child against his not exculpatory with respect to a charge of criminal mistreatment.</p>\n<p id=\"b216-4\">In June, 1979, Reed\u2019s probation was revoked. At that hearing his attorney argued that the proceeding should be continued pending conclusion of the post-conviction relief proceeding. Reed further contended that he could not fully defend in the probation revocation hearing without sacrificing his Fifth Amendment rights with respect to the second indictment for criminal nonsupport pending at that time. Reed\u2019s probation was revoked nevertheless. In August, 1979, Reed refused to plead over in the post-conviction proceeding and the petition was dismissed.</p>\n<p id=\"b216-5\">1) With respect to his first of assignment error, Reed makes two arguments: first, that it is unfair to permit the state to charge a person with a crime, withhold information favorable to a potential defense to that crime and plea bargain in order to obtain a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"189\">*189</page-number>guilty plea to a lesser crime; and second, that the defense of \"lawful excuse\u201d applicable to a criminal non-support<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> is also available in a prosecution for criminal mistreatment,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> so that this information should have been disclosed to Reed before negotiating a plea of guilty on the lesser charge.</p>\n<p id=\"AbqU\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"190\">*190</page-number>the constitutional validity of ORS 163.200, the statute defining the crime to which he pled guilty. See ORS 138.530(1)(d).<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> That the statute under which Reed was originally charged may be unconstitutional does not invalidate subsequent proceedings if they are constitutionally valid. <em>See State v. Cloman, </em>254 Or 1, 12, 456 P2d 67 (1969). There was no allegation here that his indictment for criminal nonsupport induced him to plead guilty to an offense he did not commit. ORS 138.530(1)(a);<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> <em>Barnes v. </em>Cupp, 44 Or App 533, 606 P2d 664 (1980.)</p>\n<p id=\"b218-3\">3) The sole issue at the probation revocation hearing was whether Reed had violated the terms of his probation. ORS 137.550(2). It was uncontested that he had failed to make support payments, to reimburse the court for the costs of his court-appointed attorney and to apprise the court in writing of his address and employment. Any of these grounds was a sufficient basis for revoking probation and evidence to the contrary could have been presented without jeopardizing Reed\u2019s right against self-incrimination.</p>\n<p id=\"b218-4\">Affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<blockquote id=\"ANp\">\"A person commits the crime of criminal nonsupport if, being the parent, lawful guardian or other person lawfully charged with the support of a child under 18 years of age, bom in or out of wedlock, he refuses or neglects <em>without lawful excuse </em>to provide support for such child.\u201d ORS 163.555(1).
