J.</author>\n<p id=\"A33\">Appellant Steven Holdsworth was in a Contra Costa County jail after being sentenced for assault with a deadly weapon. (Pen. Code, \u00a7 245, subd. (a)(1).) Four days after sentence was imposed, he <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"256\">*256</page-number>destroyed jail property. He was later convicted of this crime. (Pen. Code, \u00a7 4600.)<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The trial court determined that the crime should be sentenced as an in-prison offense under section 1170.1, subdivision (c). The court accordingly gave appellant a six-year sentence fully consecutive to the assault sentence, three years for the section 4600 offense and three years for three prior prison terms. (\u00a7 667.5.) The question before us is whether section 1170.1, subdivision (c), applies to a defendant who has been sentenced for a felony but has yet to be delivered to state prison.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> A subissue is whether appellant could be sentenced under section 1170.1, subdivision (c), because he was on parole and subject to a parole hold at the time *of his crime.</p>\n<p id=\"b246-4\">The issue in this case arises because the determinate sentencing law treats in-prison offenses differently than out-of-prison offenses. Sentences for out-of-prison offenses are ordinarily calculated under subdivision (a) of section 1170.1. Subdivision (a) states, inter alia, that the greatest term of imprisonment is the principal term and that consecutive sentences are subordinate terms, served at one-third of the middle term. Subdivision (c) applies to \u201cfelonies committed while the person is confined in a state prison.\u201d Subdivision (a) begins with the words \u201c[ejxcept as provided in subdivision (c),\u201d making clear that felonies committed in prison are exempt from the general sentencing scheme. <em>(In re Sims </em>(1981) 117 Cal.App.3d 309, 313 [172 Cal.Rptr. 608].) A sentence under subdivision (c) will generally be longer than under subdivision (a). This is so because subdivision (c) requires that when an in-prison offense is imposed consecutively,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> it is fully consecutive to the offense for which the defendant was imprisoned. In other words, the in-prison offense is treated as a new principal term rather than as a subordinate term to the out-of-prison offense. <em>(People </em>v. <em>McCart </em>(1982) 32 Cal.3d 338, 344 [185 Cal.Rptr. 284, 649 P.2d 926]; <em>Sims, supra, </em>at p. 314.)<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b246-5\">We hold that the court erred in applying section 1170.1, subdivision (c). We reach this conclusion based primarily on the language of section 1170.1, subdivision (c), itself: \u201cfelonies committed while the person is <em>confined in a state </em>prisonThe word \u201cconfined\u201d denotes physical restraint with a bound<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"257\">*257</page-number>ary. (See Webster\u2019s New Internat. Dict. (3d ed. 1966) p. 476.) The phrase \u201cstate prison\u201d logically means any institution designated by the state as a prison. Sections 4504, subdivision (a), and 5003 indicate that the phrase \u201cstate prison\u201d can include institutions other than prisons over which the Department of Corrections has jurisdiction.  However, the Department of Corrections does not have jurisdiction over local jails.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark>\n                   Thus, section 1170.1, subdivision (c), cannot apply to a convicted felon awaiting delivery to a state prison. (Cf. <em>People </em>v. <em>Mitchell (1988)post, </em>p. 300 [244 Cal.Rptr. 803]; <em>People </em>v. <em>Jones </em>(1980) 110 Cal.App.3d 75, 77 [167 Cal.Rptr. 571] [one who escapes from local facility or jail must be sentenced under \u00a7 1170.1, subd. (a)].)</p>\n<p id=\"b247-5\">This interpretation is supported by the analogous Penal Code provision of section 4502. This statute makes criminal certain acts when committed by \u201c[e]very person confined in a state prison.\u201d Before 1963, section 4502 applied to \u201c[e]very prisoner committed to a state prison.\u201d <em>(In re Smith </em>(1966) 64 Cal.2d 437, 440 [50 Cal.Rptr. 460, 412 P.2d 804].)<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> Despite the \u201ccommitted to\u201d language, courts applied section 4502 to persons who were physically confined in a state prison, but who had not been committed to a state prison as convicted felons. (See <em>People </em>v. <em>Rodriguez </em>(1963) 222 Cal.App.2d 221, 224-226 [34 Cal.Rptr. 907] [Youth Authority commitment to Soledad]; <em>People </em>v. <em>White </em>(1960) 177 Cal.App.2d 383, 385 [2 Cal.Rptr. 202] [transfer of adjudged psychopath to San Quentin]; <em>People </em>v. <em>Scherbing </em>(1949) 93 Cal.App.2d 736, 739 [209 P.2d 796], overruled on other grounds in <em>People </em>v. <em>Olivas </em>(1976) 17 Cal.3d 236, 257 [131 Cal.Rptr. 55, 551 P.2d 375] [Youth Authority commitment to San Quentin].) As stated in <em>In re Smith, supra, </em>at page 440, the amendment was \u201cenacted to clarify the law and not to change it.\u201d Thus, cases decided after the amendment have rejected the claim that the amendment changed the law as regards nonfelons in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"258\">*258</page-number>state prison. <em>(In re Branch </em>(1969) 70 Cal.2d 200, 215-217 [74 Cal.Rptr. 238, 449 P.2d 174]; <em>In re Smith, supra, </em>64 Cal.2d at p. 440; <em>People </em>v. <em>Lopez (1969) 1 </em>Cal.App.3d 672, 681 [82 Cal.Rptr. 121].) The result in these cases reflects the legislative intent to promote the safety of guards and inmates, since the law furthers this goal regardless of the reason the person is in prison. <em>(People </em>v. <em>Superior Court (Gaulden) </em>(1977) 66 Cal.App.3d 773, 778 [136 Cal.Rptr. 229], overruled on <em>other </em>grounds in <em>People </em>v. <em>Sumstine </em>(1984) 36 Cal.3d 909, 919, fn. 6 [206 Cal.Rptr. 707, 687 P.2d 904]; <em>Lopez, supra, </em>at pp. 681-682.)</p>\n<p id=\"b248-5\">The amendment of section 4502 and the cases interpreting this statute make clear that it is the defendant\u2019s physical presence in a state prison that determines the applicability of this statute. The court in <em>Smith, </em>by stating that the amendment was \u201cenacted to clarify the law and not to change it,\u201d presumably meant that after the amendment, the law was now clear that the place of confinement rather than the status of the confinee was determinative.</p>\n<p id=\"b248-6\">Since section 1170.1, subdivision (c), also reads \u201cconfined in a state prison,\u201d it is reasonable to assume the Legislature, when it enacted the determinate sentencing law, intended to give section 1170.1, subdivision (c), the same meaning. <em>(Selfa </em>v. <em>Superior Court </em>(1980) 109 Cal.App.3d 182, 187 [167 Cal.Rptr. 153] [statutes relating to the same subject matter should be harmonized].) The amendment of section 4502 shows that the Legislature knows the difference between \u201cconfined\u201d and \u201ccommitted,\u201d and that when it says \u201cconfined,\u201d it means actual, physical confinement.</p>\n<p id=\"b248-7\">Our conclusion is also consistent with the laws which define when a prison sentence begins. Section 2900, subdivision (a), provides: \u201cThe term of imprisonment fixed by the judgment in a criminal action commences to run only upon the actual delivery of the defendant into the custody of the Director of Corrections at the place designated by the Director of Corrections as a place for the reception of persons convicted of felonies.\u201d In conjunction with this provision, subdivision (e) of section 2900.5 provides: \u201cIt shall be the duty of any agency to which a person is committed to apply the [presentence credit] for the period between the date of sentencing and the date the person is delivered to such agency.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b248-8\">These statutes instruct that delivery, the physical act of transporting the defendant to a state penal institution, is what triggers the running of a prison sentence. After sentencing and before delivery, the defendant\u2019s custody is considered presentence time to be credited against the actual prison term. Logically, a person cannot be \u201cconfined in a state prison\u201d until he has been \u201cdelivered\u201d to a state prison. Read in light of sections 2900, subdivi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"259\">*259</page-number>sion (a), and 2900.5, subdivision (e), the word \u201cconfined\u201d as used in subdivision (c) of section 1170.1 must mean literal confinement in a state prison.</p>\n<p id=\"b249-5\">Respondent urges us to adopt the reasoning of <em>People </em>v. <em>Lamont, supra, 177 </em>Cal.App.3d 577, <em>People </em>v. <em>Nick </em>(1985) 164 Cal.App.3d 141 [210 Cal.Rptr. 137], and <em>People </em>v. <em>Pitcock </em>(1982) 134 Cal.App.3d 795 [184 Cal.Rptr. 772]. These cases considered whether a convicted felon confined in a nonprison setting could be sentenced under section 1170.1, subdivision (c). They held the statute did apply. There is a critical difference, however, between these cases and this case. There, the defendants had been physically delivered to a state institution. Here, no such delivery occurred. Appellant was not confined in any type of state institution when he committed his crime.</p>\n<p id=\"b249-6\">This distinction is found explicitly in <em>Nick </em>and implicitly in <em>Lamont. </em>In <em>Nick, </em>the court held that the defendant\u2019s confinement in a conservation camp made the provisions of section 1170.1, subdivision (c), applicable. Citing <em>Pitcock,</em><footnotemark><em>7</em></footnotemark><em> </em>the court stated: \u201cIn light of the fact that appellant was originally committed to the Department of Corrections in 1980, <em>and was delivered to the custody of the director of that department at that time, </em>he is properly treated as a prisoner confined to a state prison under statutes which proscribe acts performed while so confined.\u201d <em>(People </em>v. <em>Nick, supra, </em>164 Cal. App.3d at p. 146, italics added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b249-7\">In <em>Lamont, </em>the court held that section 1170.1, subdivision (c), applied to a defendant residing in a halfway house and participating in a work furlough program. <em>(People </em>v. <em>Lamont, supra, 177 </em>Cal.App.3d at p. 583.) The court examined subdivisions (a) and (b) of section 4504 and subdivision (q) of section 5003. <em>(Id., </em>at pp. 582-583.) The relevant portions of the former statute, which deals with offenses by prisoners, read: \u201cFor purposes of this chapter: [fl] (a) A person is deemed confined in a \u2018state prison\u2019 if he is confined in any of the prisons and institutions specified in Section 5003 by order made pursuant to law, . . . [^j] (b) A person is deemed \u2018confined in\u2019 a prison although, at the time of the offense, he is temporarily outside its walls or bounds for the purpose of serving on a work detail or for the purpose of confinement in a local correctional institution pending trial or for any other purpose for which a prisoner may be allowed temporarily outside the walls or bounds of the prison, . . .\u201d The subdivisions of section 5003 list the places over which the Department of Corrections has jurisdic<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"260\">*260</page-number>tion; subdivision (q) adds: \u201cSuch other institutions and prison facilities as the Department of Corrections or the Director of Corrections may be authorized by law to establish.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b250-5\">The result in <em>Lamont </em>is correct because the defendant was in effect serving his sentence in a halfway house. The defendant had been delivered to a state institution after being sentenced; the only question was a semantic one of whether the halfway house constituted an institution or prison facility under section 5003, subdivision (q), and, by extension, a state prison for purposes of section 1170.1, subdivision (c). <em>(People </em>v. <em>Lamont, supra, 177 </em>Cal.App.3d at p. 583.) The question in this case is quite different. Appellant had not been delivered to any type of state institution when he committed his crime. Therefore, the question in this case is a threshold one of whether section 1170.1, subdivision (c), may apply before delivery to any state institution. This question was not at issue in <em>Lamont, Nick </em>or <em>Pitcock.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b250-6\"> Respondent contends that section 1170.1, subdivision (c), applies because appellant was a parolee in custody and subject to a parole hold at the time of the instant crime. We conclude that these facts are not determinative of the issue. Even though appellant was a parolee in custody, and even if appellant was subject to a parole hold,<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> he could not be sentenced under section 1170.1, subdivision (c), because he was not then physically confined in a state prison or state institution.</p>\n<p id=\"b250-7\">Respondent argues that appellant\u2019s parole status made him a state prisoner. Respondent relies on the theory that a parolee is in the constructive or legal custody of the state. (See \u00a7\u00a7 3000, subds. (a) and (d), <em>3056;</em><footnotemark><em>9</em></footnotemark><em> People </em>v. <em>Britton </em>(1984) 156 Cal.App.3d 689, 695-696 [202 Cal.Rptr. 882].) This argument is answered by section 4504, subdivision (b), which states in part: \u201c[A] prisoner who has been released on parole is not deemed \u2018confined in\u2019 a prison for purposes of this chapter.\u201d This section makes clear that a parolee who commits a crime has not committed an in-prison offense unless he is in a prison at that time. While this statute by its terms is limited to defining offenses by prisoners, its language is not explicitly exclusive, and, as noted above, the similarity of language between section 4504, subdivision (b), and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"261\">*261</page-number>section 1170.1, subdivision (c), requires that the statutes be harmonized. <em>People </em>v. <em>Lamont, supra, </em>did rely on the provisions of section 4504 as an aid in interpreting section 1170.1, subdivision (c). <em>(People </em>v. <em>Lamont, supra, 177 </em>Cal.App.3d at pp. 582-583.)</p>\n<p id=\"b251-5\">Thus, appellant\u2019s constructive or legal custody is not the issue, for it is the place of confinement, not the status of the person confined, that is decisive. <em>(In re Branch, supra, </em>70 Cal.2d at pp. 215-217; <em>In re Smith, supra, </em>64 Cal. 3d at p. 440; <em>People </em>v. <em>Lopez, supra, </em>1 Cal.App.3d at p. 681.)</p>\n<p id=\"b251-6\">It is also noteworthy that under the determinate sentencing law, the parole period is imposed separately from and is not part of the prison sentence. A prisoner is not paroled until he has completed his sentence. <em>(People </em>v. <em>Britton, supra, </em>156 Cal.App.3d at pp. 695-696; <em>People </em>v. <em>Mathews </em>(1980) 102 Cal.App.3d 704, 712 [162 Cal.Rptr. 615].)  Thus, appellant was not a prisoner of the state until he was delivered to state prison pursuant to his section 4600 conviction.</p>\n<p id=\"b251-7\">For the same reasons, any parole hold did not transform appellant\u2019s local custody into confinement in a state prison. A parole hold cannot be equated with the delivery of a convicted felon to a state prison.  A parole hold is \u201c[a]n authorization by a departmental employee that a parolee be held in custody pursuant to Section 3056 of the Penal Code.\u201d (Cal. Dept, of Corrections, Parole Procedures Manual\u2014Felon (Feb. 8, 1985) p. RC6 (hereafter Parole Procedures Manual)). It occurs when a parole agent, having reason to believe the parolee has violated parole, causes the parolee to be brought into custody or refrained from obtaining release on bail. <em>(In re Law </em>(1973) 10 Cal.3d 21, 24, fn. 2 [109 Cal.Rptr. 573, 513 P.2d 621]; Parole Procedures Manual, <em>supra, </em>ch. 8, art. 4, \u00a7 840, subd. (a), p. 4-8.1.) The parole agent\u2019s decision to place the hold must be reviewed within four days. (Cal. Admin. Code, tit. 15, \u00a7\u00a7 3530, subd. (c), 3532, subd. (a); Parole Procedures Manual, <em>supra, </em>ch. 8, art. 4, \u00a7\u00a7 840, subd. (a), p. 4-8.1, 842, p. 4-8.2.)<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> The hold may not be longer than six months or the remainder of the parole period, whichever comes first. (Cal. Admin. Code, tit. 15, \u00a7 3535; Parole Procedures Manual, <em>supra, </em>\u00a7 845, p. 4-8.5.)</p>\n<p id=\"b251-8\">The parole agent may place the parolee in a local jail or, if he is already in jail, prevent him from being released on bail, on his own recognizance or after the expiration of any sentence the parolee may be required to serve. <em>(In re Law, supra, </em>10 Cal.3d at p. 24, fn. 2; Cal. Admin. Code, tit. 15, \u00a7 3530, subd. (d).) A parolee under a parole hold may be transferred to a state <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"262\">*262</page-number>prison only after a hearing except for medical reasons or \u201c[i]f officials of a local jail cannot or will not retain a parolee in custody pending a hearing and a violation report is being submitted to the Board of Prison Terms, . . (Parole Procedures Manual, <em>supra, </em>ch. 8, art. 4, \u00a7 846, subds. (a) and (b), p.4-8.5; Cal. Admin. Code, tit. 15, \u00a72605.)</p>\n<p id=\"b252-5\">These rules show that a parole hold is a temporary measure to restrain a parolee suspected of violating parole. It is not a prison sentence, nor does it transform the parolee into a state prisoner. The parole agent has no power to confine a parolee in a state prison in the first instance. His power is limited to booking him into a local jail. Only later may a parolee be transferred to state prison, if warranted under the circumstances. If such a transfer occurs, and the parolee commits a crime, he would, under the reasoning <em>o\u00ed Branch, Smith, </em>and <em>Lopez, supra, </em>be subject to section 1170.1, subdivision (c).<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> Since no transfer occurred in this case, section 1170.1, subdivision (c), did not apply.</p>\n<p id=\"b252-6\">Having concluded that appellant could not be sentenced under section 1170.1, subdivision (c), the court was required to impose sentence under section 1170.1, subdivision (a). In <em>People </em>v. <em>Tassell </em>(1984) 36 Cal.3d 77, 90 [201 Cal.Rptr. 567, 679 P.2d 1], the Supreme Court held that prior prison term enhancements may be imposed only once in a single sentencing package. Therefore, the enhancements attached to the section 4600 offense must be stricken.</p>\n<p id=\"b252-7\">That portion of the judgment imposing sentence for the section 4600 offense under section 1170.1, subdivision (c), is reversed. The court is directed to impose sentence under section 1170.1, subdivision (a). In so doing, the court must decide whether to impose this sentence consecutively or concurrently to the prior assault sentence. In either event, the prior prison term enhancements under section 667.5 attaching to the section 4600 offense must be stricken. In all other respects, the judgment is affirmed.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b252-8\">Merrill, J., concurred.</p>\n<author id=\"b253-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"263\">*263</page-number>BARRY-DEAL, J.</author>\n<p id=\"AQZ\">I concur in the reasoning and the judgment of the lead opinion. I write separately only to suggest that the Legislature reexamine the scope of Penal Code section 1170.1, subdivision (c). As stated by Presiding Justice White, the legislative scheme dealing with crimes committed by those confined in state prison \u201creflects the legislative intent to promote the safety of guards and inmates . . . .\u201d (Majority opn., <em>ante, </em>p. 258.)

The judge may have relied on this fact in his ruling since he stated that the parole hold theory was \u201cone that frankly impresses me.\u201d Were we to find that the parole hold made appellant eligible for sentencing under section 1170.1, subdivision (c), we would agree with appellant that remand would be necessary to determine if in fact there was such a parole hold and, if so, whether the hold was still in effect at the time of the crime.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"9\">\n<p id=\"b250-9\"> Section 3000 speaks of the parole period as a form of custody, and the waiver or completion of the period of parole as a \u201cdischarge[ ] from custody.\u201d Section 3056 provides: \u201cPrisoners on parole shall remain under the legal custody of the department [of Corrections] and shall be subject at any time to be taken back within the inclosure of the prison.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"10\">\n<p id=\"b251-9\">The initial review is accomplished by a \u201cunit supervisor.\u201d Higher levels of review are by the \u201cdistrict administrator\u201d and the Board of Prison Terms. (Parole Procedures Manual, <em>supra, </em>ch. 8, art. 4, \u00a7 842, subds. (a)-(c), pp. 4-8.2-4-8.3.)</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"11\">\n<p id=\"b252-9\"> The same reasoning should hold where a parolee\u2019s parole is revoked. There is authority to return a parole violater to state prison. (See \u00a7\u00a7 3060.5, 3084; Cal. Code Regs., tit. 15, \u00a7 2646, subd. (c).) A parole violater is also eligible for treatment in a local facility (Cal. Admin. Code, tit. 15, \u00a7 2646, subd. (c)(2)) or for work furlough (Cal. Admin. Code, tit. 15, \u00a7 2646, subd. (c)(6)). Consistent with our holding as to persons subject to parole holds, whether a person who commits a crime after his parole is revoked can be sentenced under section 1170.1, subdivision (c), depends on whether he is physically confined in a state prison within the meaning of sections 4504, subdivision (a) and 5003.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"12\">\n<p id=\"b252-10\"> Appellant raises an additional contention in a habeas corpus petition <em>(In re Holdsworth, </em>A038560), which has been consolidated with the appeal for purposes of argument and briefing, and which we have considered in conjunction with the appeal. We deny the petition today by separate order.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
