Memorandum: Defendant was charged with two counts of rape in the first degree (Penal Law \u00a7 130.35 [1]) and two counts of sodomy in the first degree (Penal Law \u00a7 130.50 [1]). He was found guilty, following a bench trial, of two counts of attempted rape in the first degree and two counts of attempted sodomy in the first degree. He contends that County Court erred in admitting a videotape and in considering the lesser included offenses of attempted rape and attempted sodomy. Those issues are not preserved for our review <em>(see, </em>CPL 470.05 [2]), and we decline to exercise our power to address them as a matter of discretion in the interest of justice <em>(see, </em>CPL 470.15 [6] [a]). In any event, any error regarding the admission of the videotape is harmless <em>(see, People v Crimmins, 36 </em>NY2d 230, 241-242), and the proof adduced at trial supports a finding of attempt even though there is some evidence of consummation <em>(see, People v Shreve, </em>167 AD2d 698; <em>People v Mendez, </em>158 AD2d 326, <em>lv denied </em>76 NY2d 792). Finally, there is no merit to defendant\u2019s contention that the verdict is against <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"887\">*887</page-number>the weight of the evidence <em>(see, People v Bleakley, </em>69 NY2d 490, 495).
