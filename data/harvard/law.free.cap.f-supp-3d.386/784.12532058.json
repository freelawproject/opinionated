Second, the Government's Response takes issue with the definition of a Notice to Appear in U.S.C. \u00a7 1229(a)(1), as opposed to the regulatory definition in\n   <extracted-citation index=\"18\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=8%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%201003.15\">\n    8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1003.15\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , which does not require a date and time to be in a Notice to Appear.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"19\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=8%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%201003.15\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"19\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=8%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%201003.15\">\n    at 5-6\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

The indictment for illegal re-entry should be dismissed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   <strong>\n    a. The Statutory Definition Controls Over the Regulatory Definition Upon Which the Government Relies.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   The necessary components of a Notice to Appear are provided in two different places.
