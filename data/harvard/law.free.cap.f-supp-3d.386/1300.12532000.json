(\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   SAC \u00b6 141.) They argue that defenses like qualified immunity and good faith are categorically inapplicable to claims for equitable relief.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Wood v.

Even if this distinction is well taken, plaintiffs' refund claim fails for two independent reasons.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   First, plaintiffs cannot simply plead around defenses by labeling the proposed remedy as equitable rather than legal. Instead, this court must look to \"the substance of the remedy sought rather than the label placed on that remedy.\"\n   <em>\n    Depot, Inc. v.

It is uncontroverted that plaintiffs' claim seeks payment out of the general assets of the union defendants. And the Supreme Court has stressed that recovering money out of a defendant's general assets, as opposed to a segregated fund, \"is a\n   <em>\n    legal\n   </em>\n   remedy, not an equitable one.\"\n   <em>\n    Montanile v.

(SAC \u00b6\u00b6 35, 39.) Since the Supreme Court issued its ruling in\n   <em>\n    Janus\n   </em>\n   , Porter has pondered whether to resign his union membership and is concerned that he will be forced to continue to pay union dues after he relinquishes his membership. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 120.) He is also worried that he will lose his \"classification seniority\" if he quits the union. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 134.) On June 27, 2018, he\n   informed his employer that he had not signed a union card or opted into fees, and asked whether dues would be taken from his paycheck. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 121.) Porter's employer told him to contact his union. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 122.) Porter wishes, however, to terminate payroll deductions immediately upon resigning his union membership. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 123.) He seeks a declaratory judgment that California Government Code \u00a7\u00a7 1152 and 1157.12(b) are unconstitutional, as well as an injunction against their enforcement, because they allegedly prevent him from halting payroll deductions unless and until the union instructs his employer to do so. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 123, 125.) The union defendants contend that these claims fail because Porter lacks Article III standing.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   Under Article III of the U.S. Constitution, the judicial power is limited to \"Cases\" and \"Controversies.\" That a plaintiff must have standing to sue is \"rooted in the traditional understanding of a case or controversy.\"\n   <em>\n    Spokeo, Inc. v.

This alleged harm by itself is insufficient to confer standing. Even if Porter has a right to instruct his employer to terminate payroll deductions, Porter would not satisfy Article III's injury-in-fact requirement with an injury \"divorced from any concrete harm.\"\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Spokeo\n   </em>\n   , 136 S. Ct. at 1549 ;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Bassett v.

Although Porter may not want to submit a request to terminate payroll deductions to his union, it is difficult to imagine how submitting this request, without more, would cause Porter harm to any of his real interests. While the Supreme Court in\n   <em>\n    Spokeo\n   </em>\n   stated that \"intangible injuries can nevertheless be concrete,\" 136 S. Ct. at 1549, Porter fails to sufficiently allege why this requirement independently exacts any harm to his First Amendment rights.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   To the extent Porter believes that the union defendants would not honor his request to discontinue dues payments once he resigns, that injury is too speculative to confer standing. Porter has not asked Local 3634 whether dues payments would be halted immediately if he resigns. Until he does so and receives an answer that they would not be, this court cannot conclude that any threatened harm from continued dues payments after resignation\n   is \"certainly impending,\" and thus imminent for the purposes of Article III standing.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Clapper\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12407550\" index=\"72\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/568/398/#p409\">\n    568 U.S. at 409\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12407550\" index=\"73\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/568/398/#p409\">\n    133 S.Ct. 1138\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . For the same reason, Porter's concern that he may lose his classification seniority if he quits his union (SAC \u00b6 134) also does not constitute an injury that is \"certainly impending.\" Indeed, under California law, unions and state employers cannot discriminate against an employee who exercises his right to refuse to participate in a union.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"74\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Cal.%20Code%20%C2%A7%203506\">\n    Cal.
