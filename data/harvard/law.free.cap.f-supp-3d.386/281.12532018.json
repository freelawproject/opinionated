(Dkt. 1).

The Court dismissed Plaintiff's claim for the destruction of his legal materials as against Defendant Michael Philips (\"Philips\") as well as all claims against Defendants John Doe 1, John Doe 2, and John Doe 3 (collectively,\n   the \"John Doe Defendants\") without prejudice. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 24). The remaining claims alleged against Philips and the other named defendants were dismissed with prejudice, with the exception of Plaintiff's excessive force claim asserted against Philips, which was permitted to proceed to service unless Plaintiff filed an amended complaint consistent with the Court's screening order. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ). Plaintiff was advised that any amended complaint must include all necessary allegations so that it may stand alone as the sole complaint in this action. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   On September 7, 2018, Plaintiff filed his Amended Complaint (Dkt. 7) along with three motions requesting various miscellaneous relief (Dkt. 8; Dkt. 9; Dkt. 10).

For the following reasons, Plaintiff's amended excessive force claim may proceed to service as against Philips, but his remaining claims are dismissed with prejudice, Plaintiff's motion for permission to use the Court's electronic filing system (Dkt. 8) is denied without prejudice, motion for an order pursuant to\n   <em>\n    Valentin v.

Plaintiff claims that Philips, who was employed as the Immigration and Customs Enforcement (\"ICE\") Field Office Director in Buffalo, New York, forged a Nigerian Travel Certificate to unlawfully remove him from the United States in order to \"help some 'rogue' Connecticut Law Enforcement Officers get away with\" having illegally arrested Plaintiff and caused him to serve seven years of \"false imprisonment\" and two years of \"federal prison overtime.\" (Dkt. 7 at 1-2).\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   Philips and \"other ICE agents\" conspired with the \"rogue\" officers to unlawfully remove Plaintiff from the United States to impede his legal actions challenging his alleged illegal arrests, false imprisonment, and federal sentence. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 5). Philips used a \"private airline,\" identified by Plaintiff as \"Giant Airline,\" to \"execute the illegal removal.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ). Plaintiff alleges that John Doe 1 is the \"Owner/CEO\" of \"Giant Private Airline,\" and that John Doe 2 and John Doe 3 were the pilot and the co-pilot of the \"deportation plane,\" respectively. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 4).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   Before Plaintiff was allegedly removed from the United States, \"Philips and his fellow ICE agents deliberately confiscated and destroyed\" all of Plaintiff's \"legal documents and legal materials\" in order to prevent Plaintiff from contesting the purportedly wrongful acts he alleges were committed against him. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 6-7 (emphasis omitted)). Plaintiff claims that he \"consequently lost\" several judicial and administrative actions that he outlines in further detail within his Amended Complaint. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 7-18).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   Plaintiff also claims that \"Philips and his fellow ICE Agents (About 12 of\n   them)\" stripped Plaintiff of his clothes in front of \"all female ICE agents\" and \"all other female prison staff,\" and then \"tied Plaintiff up with chains\" while they \"severely beat him up while butt naked.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 20). Plaintiff was then carried \"like a dead body\" into the deportation plane and was \"periodically\" beaten during the flight from Buffalo, New York to Lagos, Nigeria. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ).\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   Plaintiff further alleges that John Doe 1 contractually agreed \"to use his aircraft[ ] to violate Plaintiff's constitutional rights.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 23,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6219215\" index=\"6\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/503/1/\">\n    112 S.Ct. 995\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ). Stated differently, Plaintiff claims that John Doe 1 \"consented\" to Philips' use of excessive force, and that he \"knew exactly what Defendant Philips and other ICE agents would do with his aircraft[ ] before he allowed them to use it.\" (\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6219215\" index=\"7\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/503/1/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   ). Plaintiff also alleges that John Doe 2 and John Doe 3 both \"witnessed\" the excessive force used by Philips and the \"other ICE Agents\" and yet, they did nothing to intervene to assist Plaintiff. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 25-27,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6219215\" index=\"8\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/503/1/\">\n    112 S.Ct. 995\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   Attached to Plaintiff's Amended Complaint were three motions requesting various forms of relief.

(Dkt. 6 at 11, 21-23). The Court reaches the same conclusion here for substantially the same reasons as those outlined in the initial screening order. The Second Circuit has not yet addressed whether a district court has jurisdiction over an excessive force claim that appears to arise out of the act of physically removing a plaintiff aboard an airplane pursuant to his immigration removal order.\n   <em>\n    Cf.\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Foster v.

Although the Court continues to question whether it has jurisdiction over Plaintiff's excessive force claim, the Court will again assume, for screening purposes only, that Plaintiff's excessive force allegations fall outside the jurisdictional bar of \u00a7 1252(g).

Although Plaintiff states that at least one of his legal claims was dismissed for lack of sufficient documentary evidence (Dkt. 7 at 9), Plaintiff has not set forth factual assertions that demonstrate the documents he allegedly possessed would have had any impact on his success. In other words, Plaintiff has failed to allege a reasoned basis to believe that the documents he was in possession of or now seeks to obtain have any bearing on his underlying claims.
