Bertelsman, United States District Judge\n   In the present matter, Plaintiff, acting on behalf of a putative class of individuals or entities who purchased or otherwise acquired General Cable's common stock during the Class Period, alleges that Defendant General Cable, Defendant Gregory B. Kenny, and Defendant Brian J. Robinson violated \u00a7 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 78j(b) and Rule 10-b5 promulgated thereunder,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=17%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%20240\">\n    17 C.F.R. \u00a7 240\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .10b-5. Plaintiff also alleges that Defendants Kenny and Robinson violated \u00a7 20(a) of the Exchange Act. The defendants filed respective motions to dismiss all claims brought against them. (Docs. 75, 76, 77).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   Having previously heard oral argument and taken this matter under submission, the Court now issues the following Memorandum Opinion and Order.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     Factual and Procedural Background\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   <strong>\n    1. General Cable\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   General Cable (\"GC\") is a wire and cable manufacturer based primarily in Highland Heights, Kentucky. The individual defendants-Gregory Kenny and Brian Robinson-served as GC's Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, respectively, during the Class Period. (Doc. 69 \u00b6\u00b6 31-32). In addition to its North American endeavors, GC has extensive international operations and it derives a large percentage of its revenues from these overseas divisions. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 60). The relevant foreign subsidiaries were in Portugal, Angola, Thailand, China, and Egypt. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 34-38).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   In the early 2010s, GC began to realize that, through certain foreign entities, GC committed several violations of the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (\"FCPA\"). In December of 2012, certain GC executives-which purportedly included Defendant Robinson-received an Internal Audit report that identified excessive payments to a particular agent in Angola. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 148, 154). The report also recommended that GC establish a global policy for using agents and sales representatives, but GC failed to take any subsequent action on this matter until the fall of 2013 when it conducted an onsite review. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 157). After this onsite review, GC reported its findings to the SEC and DOJ in January of 2014. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 163). This prompted investigations by both departments that culminated in settlements between GC and the DOJ and SEC, respectively, in December of 2016. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 170, 173). These settlements revealed the extensive nature of the FCPA-related issues, and GC admitted to knowing that certain subsidiaries had been acting in violation of the FCPA since 2011. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 146).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   <strong>\n    2. General Cable's Statements During the Class Period\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   <strong>\n    a. General Cable's regular SEC filings.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   The Class Period for this action runs from February 23, 2012, to February 10, 2016. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 1). In compliance with SEC regulations, GC filed regular reports throughout the class period, which were signed by Kenny and Robinson. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 175, 178, 192, 194, 202, 204, 211). In these filings, GC routinely informed investors\n   of risks that were associated with its overall business. For example, in its 2011 Form 10-K-filed on the starting date of the Class Period-GC included a section appropriately titled \"Risk Factors\" in which it stated that it is \"subject to a number of risk factors listed below[ ] which could have a material adverse affect on [its] financial condition.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   (Doc. 75-16 at 3). GC identified the listed risk factors as \"all of the known material risks and uncertainties that they know to exist\" but cautioned that additional, unknown risks may also impair its business. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   One of the risk factors was that certain foreign and U.S. laws applied to their international operations, including the FCPA. GC stated that \"[a]lthough we have implemented policies and procedures designed to ensure compliance with these laws, there can be no assurance that our employees, contractors and agents will not take actions in violation of our policies, particularly as we expand our operations through organic growth and acquisitions.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 13). This statement was repeated in every Form 10-K and Form 10-K/A that was filed during the Class Period, and was also incorporated by reference in every Form 10-Q and Form 10-Q/A during this time. (Doc. 69 \u00b6 76). GC had regularly repeated this statement in its Forms 10-K since at least December of 2007 (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 176).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   GC also explained specifically that it is subject to risks that come with doing extensive international business. This included conducting operations in countries that are at \"higher risk of being targets of economic and political destabilization, international conflicts, restrictive actions by foreign governments, nationalizations or expropriations, changes in regulatory requirements,\n   <strong>\n    the difficulty of effectively managing diverse global operations\n   </strong>\n   , terrorist activities, adverse foreign tax laws and the threat posed by potential pandemics in countries that do not have the resources necessary to deal with such outbreaks.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 177) (emphasis in original). These risks, per GC, are particularly heightened in certain countries, including Angola, Thailand, and India. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ). These statements were repeated in the same SEC filings as the statement regarding GC's FCPA program. (\n   <em>\n    See\n    <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=17%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%20240\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=17%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%20240\">\n    \u00b6\u00b6 178, 193-94, 203-04, 212-13\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   GC also included a certification on its 2011 Form 10-K that related to the effectiveness of its internal controls over financial reporting. GC claimed the management had evaluated the effectiveness of the internal control over financial reporting and \"concluded that internal control over financial reporting was effective as of December 31, 2011.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 179). This was included in the 2012 Form 10-Qs for the first and second quarters. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 180). Lastly, there were additional certifications which were required under Section 302 of the Sarbanes Oxley Act of 2002 that related to defendants Kenny and Robinson as CEO and CFO, respectively. These certifications made extensive assurances as to the disclosure controls and reliability of financial reporting.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 183).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   Through publication, republications, and incorporations by reference, these statements-with one exception-were repeated\n   by GC throughout the Class Period. The exception is GC's statement that management had evaluated the effectiveness of the internal control over financial reporting and found it effective; it was issued on February 23, 2012, and repeated only on March 30, 2012, and June 29, 2012. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 179-80).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   <strong>\n    b. GC's disclosures of the FCPA violations.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   In August of 2014, GC disclosed publicly that it had alerted the DOJ and SEC to the potential FCPA violation in Angola. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 164). GC followed up in September in a separate disclosure and also revealed that it was reviewing certain payments in its Thailand and India operations for possible FCPA \"implications.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 165). In order to address flaws that it had discovered in its FCPA program, GC stated that it was implementing screening processes for international sales agents. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 224). Following the September disclosure, GC's stock prices fell more than 10%. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 19).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   In October, GC announced that it was divesting its Asia Pacific and African operations. (Doc. 69 \u00b6 20). According to a conference call conducted the following day, GC made this decision in order to better focus on its core operations in other parts of the world. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 167). In this same call, Robinson updated the callers on the SEC and DOJ investigations by stating that GC had undergone extensive reviews and was making improvements to strengthen their FCPA compliance program. (Doc. 75-10). GC's stock fell 6% the following day. (Doc. 69 \u00b6 232).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   GC's final relevant disclosure was issued on February 10, 2016. There, GC announced that the FCPA investigation was substantially completed and it updated the amount of profits that would likely be disgorged as an outcome of this investigation. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 169). However, it also revealed that there were other suspicious transactions with FCPA implications that may require an additional profit disgorgement of, potentially, $ 33 million. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 169). Following this final disclosure, GC's stock fell 31.61% on February 11, 2016. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 238).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   <strong>\n    c. GC enters into settlements with the DOJ and SEC.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   Despite GC's disclosures to investors regarding FCPA-related issues, the extent of the FCPA violations was not fully revealed until it entered into separate settlements with the DOJ and the SEC. On December 22, 2016, GC entered into a Non-Prosecution Agreement (\"NPA\") with the DOJ in which it admitted that it committed several FCPA violations from 2003 through 2015. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 39). GC also entered into a Cease-and-Desist Order (\"CDO\") with the SEC, which detailed the same FCPA violations. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 42). Most relevant here are certain admissions that GC made regarding its FCPA compliance program in these documents, specifically the NPA. (\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=17%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%20240\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=17%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%20240\">\n    \u00b6\u00b6 40, 77, 84-85,122\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   The NPA states that:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-28\">\n   GC, acting through certain executives and employees ... knew that certain of its foreign subsidiaries used certain third-party agents and distributors to make corrupt payments to foreign officials in order to obtain and retain business in certain countries. Nonetheless, GC knowingly and willfully failed to implement and maintain an adequate system of internal accounting controls designed to detect and prevent corruption or otherwise illegal payments by its agents.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   (Doc. 75-12 at A-2-A-3).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   The NPA also reveals that a certain high-level executive became aware of potential\n   FCPA violations in Thailand in 2011, and \"General Cable took no further action and did not take any steps to implement adequate internal accounting controls.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at A-6 - A-7). The NPA acknowledges that GC has enhanced its program and \"engaged in extensive remedial measures\" to prevent this sort of activity from happening again. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 2). GC also agreed to \"adopt new or [ ] modify existing internal controls, compliance codes, policies, and procedures\" to maintain an effective system. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at B-1).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   The CDO is similar. The SEC found that GC had a Code of Ethics that prohibited these sorts of payments and explicitly stated that the FCPA applied to GC and its employees. (Doc. 75-13 at 3). It also found that this same code required all transactions to comply with \"federal securities laws that required GCC to maintain books, records, and accounts that accurately and fairly reflect transactions, and a system of internal accounting controls designed to provide reasonable assurances that GCC's financial statements will be accurate and complete.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   Despite this, the SEC found that GC failed to adequately train its employees in order to ensure compliance with the FCPA. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ). This resulted in a highly ineffective program: many of GC's foreign subsidiaries had no internal accounting controls through which they could safely work with third-party entities and some employees were generally unaware that the FCPA even applied to their operations. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 3-4). It also details specifically how the FCPA compliance program failed in Angola where there were no additional internal accounting controls implemented until months after the initial red flags were raised. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 4-5). Similarly, the SEC acknowledges that GC has extensively improved its system.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   <strong>\n    d. Confidential Witness Accounts of the State of GC's Compliance Program.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   Plaintiff dedicates a substantial amount of his Amended Complaint to several accounts from confidential witnesses (\"CWs\") who were employed at GC during the Class Period or in the years immediately preceding the Class Period. (Doc. 69 \u00b6\u00b6 43-54). The most prominent confidential witnesses are CW 1 and CW 2. CW 1 was hired in 2012 to be Vice President of Internal Audit at GC and was in that position during the Class Period. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   43, 93). CW 1 reported, at least partially, to Robinson. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 43). CW 1 was hired in the third quarter of 2012 supposedly in order to fix GC's \"broken\" Internal Audit department. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 93, 96). CW 2 was a manager in Internal Audit during the Class Period, and reported directly to the Vice President of Internal Audit-who would seemingly be CW 1. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 44). Many other CWs were auditors for GC, with only some working as auditors during the Class Period. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 45-48). According to these CWs, GC had extraordinarily inefficient policies and procedures for ensuring compliance with the FCPA. CW 1 explained that GC did not provide adequate FCPA-specific training and resources to its Internal Audit department. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 104-05). GC also failed to conduct formalized global risk assessments, which help companies design and implement systems meant to address specific identified risks. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 113, 115). Per multiple CWs-including CW 2-GC did not test its compliance with the FCPA, either, which would have helped it discover\n   weaknesses and violations. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 116, 118).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   As part of CW 2's responsibilities, CW 2 conducted onsite visits at foreign subsidiaries. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 44). CW 2 recounted incidents from these foreign subsidiaries that should have alerted GC to potential FCPA-compliance issues. CW 2 stated that many of GC's ROW subsidiaries were \"difficult to work with and very defensive\" when they had to work with Internal Audit. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 149). CW 2 discovered an internal memorandum in the ROW division that stated that \"auditors were 'not your friends' and 'only give the auditors what they ask for.' \" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 151). At some undisclosed time, CW 2 also found an email that also seemed to contain a plot from a South African operation to conceal the true reason that an Internal Control accountant was in South Africa. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 152). CW 2 brought this to Robinson's attention but said that, while Robinson told CW 2 to \"calm down\" and that he would get to the bottom of it, CW 2 never heard from Robinson about the incident again. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   CW 1 also alleged that Robinson was regularly informed of supposed inefficiencies and needs for improvement. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 93). Allegedly, CW 1 informed Robinson of many concerns regarding GC's \"deficient FCPA compliance program\" but Robinson was \"nonrespons[ive]\" to these concerns. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 95). While CW 1 offers no specific allegations as to Kenny's knowledge, CW 1 believed that \"Kenny simply relied on Robinson when it came to issues such as compliance.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 96). The CWs overall create a picture that GC's management was largely unreceptive to efforts to improve its compliance program. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 94-97). The reason for this, according to CW 1, seemed to be that \"since there had been no FCPA violation uncovered to date, the Company's FCPA compliance must be sufficient.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 94). CW 1 alleged that this \"head in the sand\" mentality was inconsistent with the level of exposure GC faced through its international operations. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 94). As the NPA and CDO revealed, the program had many deficiencies that allowed multiple violations to occur.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   <strong>\n    3. Procedural History\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   An original complaint against GC, Kenny, and Robinson for alleged violations of federal securities laws was filed in January of 2017 in the Southern District of New York. (Doc. 1). Pursuant to\n   <extracted-citation index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201404\">\n    28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1404\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a), the parties agreed to transfer venue to the Eastern District of Kentucky. (Doc. 9). Once a lead plaintiff was appointed by this Court, (Doc. 56), Lead Plaintiff then filed an Amended Complaint in January of 2018. (Doc. 69). Defendants thereafter filed respective motions to dismiss all claims brought against them. (Docs. 75, 76, 77). Defendants each attack the merits of Plaintiff's claims, and GC also asks that this matter be dismissed for being untimely.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     Analysis\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   <strong>\n    1.

(Doc. 75 at 19-21). However, GC fails to recognize the extent to which Plaintiff relies on the factual\n   findings revealed in the NPA and CDO-specifically for support in his allegations regarding scienter.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   Section 10(b) claims have two-year statutes of limitations.\n   <extracted-citation index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201658\">\n    28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1658\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (b)(1).

There is nothing in these disclosures to reveal that GC was not as surprised as anyone else to learn of the flaws that lead to these violations.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   It was not until December of 2016 that Plaintiff could plead with any particularity that GC was aware of issues related to its program. In the NPA specifically, GC admitted that it knew it had an ineffective and inadequate FCPA compliance program. As stated in the NPA, GC knew that it had employees making illegal payments and it \"knowingly and willfully failed to implement and maintain an adequate system of internal accounting controls designed to detect and prevent corruption or otherwise illegal payments by its agents.\" (Doc. 75-12 at A-3). Further, it \"knowingly and willfully failed to address these known weaknesses.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ).

They further allege that Plaintiff failed to adequately plead scienter as to any defendant. Plaintiff's claims for each statement fail for varying reasons, so each statement is addressed in turn.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-60\">\n   <strong>\n    c. GC's statement regarding its compliance program is not actionable since it made no assurances that the system was effective and merely stated that it had a program, which is not false or misleading.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-61\">\n   As explained above, GC included a \"Risk Factors\" section in its SEC filings throughout the Class Period. In this section, GC explained that there are various laws and regulations associated with its overseas operations, which included the FCPA. (Doc. 75-16 at 13). In the Amended Complaint, Plaintiff focuses on a particular part of GC's statement immediately following its statement that certain laws, like the FCPA, apply to its international entities: \"we have implemented policies and procedures designed to ensure compliance with [the FCPA].\" (Doc. 69 \u00b6 176) (alteration in original). Pursuant to the PSLRA, Plaintiff explains that this was false or misleading because Defendants \"knew or were severely reckless in not knowing that: (i) General Cable lacked the components of an effective corporate compliance program ....\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 185).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-62\">\n   The parties disagree as to what specifically Plaintiff alleges in the Amended Complaint that explains why this statement was false. Defendants argue that Plaintiff is claiming GC misleadingly stated its program was effective when it actually made no assurances regarding the efficacy of any program-it merely stated that it had a program. (Doc. 75 at 26). Plaintiff argues that this statement was false because GC \"failed to implement even the minimum requirements of an effective FCPA compliance program\" to the extent that there essentially was not a program in place. (Doc. 101 at 24-25). Plaintiff clarifies that, because the program was allegedly extremely deficient, \"even if the court holds that GC had a policy,\n   <em>\n    which it did not\n   </em>\n   , the statements were materially misleading because they were not designed or implemented to ensure compliance.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 26) (emphasis added).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-63\">\n   While Defendants are closer to the truth regarding Plaintiff's allegations, there is\n   some grey area as to whether Plaintiff challenges the existence or the efficacy of the program. Many of Plaintiff's allegations clearly center around the alleged inefficiency of GC's program: GC did not have \"even the basic elements of a\n   <em>\n    suitable\n   </em>\n   FCPA compliance program;\" GC did not have a \"\n   <em>\n    meaningful\n   </em>\n   or\n   <em>\n    effective\n   </em>\n   program\" to ensure compliance; former employees confirmed that GC lacked \"the components of an\n   <em>\n    effective\n   </em>\n   FCPA compliance program;\" and GC \"knew or [was] severely reckless in not knowing that ... General Cable lacked the components of an\n   <em>\n    effective\n   </em>\n   corporate compliance program ....\" (Doc. 69 \u00b6\u00b6 8, 77, 78, 185) (emphases added).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-64\">\n   Similarly, many of the confidential witness accounts center around the deficiencies that made GC's program ineffective: it did not provide sufficient staffing and resources to ensure compliance; the auditors in Internal Audit were not specifically trained for the FCPA; and GC had \"woefully inadequate\" staffing and resources for Internal Audit.\n   <footnotemark>\n    7\n   </footnotemark>\n   (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 102, 104, 105). Plaintiff also boldly asserts that GC \"did not implement\n   <em>\n    any\n   </em>\n   FCPA-specific policies, procedures, or internal controls to prevent FCPA violations\" and had \"wholesale disregard\" for its FCPA responsibilities. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 6) (emphasis added). However, as Plaintiff points out, he also claimed that the deficiencies rendered GC's compliance program \"virtually non-existent....\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 269).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-65\">\n   To the extent that Plaintiff alleges GC did not have any program, Plaintiff is incorrect. The SEC found that GC had a Code of Ethics that specifically stated that the FCPA applied to GC employees and that they were prohibited from giving consideration to public officials, unless authorized by law, and it prohibited excessive payments to third parties. (Doc. 75-13 at 3). It also required all \"transactions to be executed only with management authority, general or specific, in compliance with federal securities laws that required GCC to maintain accurate books, records, and accounts that accurately and fairly reflect transactions, and a system of internal accounting controls designed to provide reasonable assurances that GCC's financial statements will be accurate and complete.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ). Thus, Plaintiff cannot plausibly claim that GC failed to have\n   <em>\n    any\n   </em>\n   FCPA-compliance program.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-66\">\n   As for the statement in general, in order to be actionable, the statement must be false or misleading and it must concern a material fact.\n   <em>\n    Omnicare\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4265567\" index=\"25\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/769/455/#p469\">\n    769 F.3d at 470\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

In these filings, GC said \"[a]lthough\n   <em>\n    we have implemented polices and procedures designed to ensure compliance with these laws\n   </em>\n   , there can be no assurance that our employees, contractors and agents will not take actions in violation of our policies, particularly as we expand our operations through organic growth and acquisitions.\" (Doc. 75-16 at 13) (emphasis added). This statement vaguely references GC's commitment to abiding with applicable laws and regulations. As the Sixth Circuit said about similarly vague statements regarding legal compliance, it provides GC with \"a great amount of wiggle room.\"\n   <em>\n    Omnicare\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4265567\" index=\"30\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/769/455/#p469\">\n    769 F.3d at 478\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . GC is not saying that it\n   <em>\n    is\n   </em>\n   complying with laws-rather, it only said that it has designed programs to foster compliance and compliance still may not always occur.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-68\">\n   Further undercutting materiality is the fact that, as Plaintiff alleged, this statement had regularly appeared in each Form 10-K GC filed since its Form 10-K for the fiscal year ending in 2007. (Doc. 69 \u00b6 176). The vague nature of this sentence and its borderline boilerplate quality cut against its materiality.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Omnicare\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4265567\" index=\"31\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/769/455/#p469\">\n    769 F.3d at 478\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . In\n   <em>\n    Omnicare\n   </em>\n   , the Sixth Circuit seriously questioned whether defendant's statement that it \"believe[d] that we are in compliance in all material respects with federal, state and local laws\" was material because it also was regularly repeated in filings and similarly vague.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4265567\" index=\"32\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/769/455/#p469\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-69\">\n   The\n   <em>\n    Omnicare\n   </em>\n   court found that it was material, however, because of context: there had been issues with legal problems regarding non-compliance in the company's recent past, which meant an investor may put more weight on statements of compliance.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4265567\" index=\"33\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/769/455/#p469\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   Here, there is no similar context until at least 2014 when GC began revealing to investors that it had disclosed potential FCPA issues to the DOJ and SEC. No investor had any special reason to place weight on GC's statements regarding legal compliance until it had notice of compliance-related issues. The importance of these statements would have grown as time went on and more issues arose, but it is hard to see how there is any context to earlier statements that would render this statement material in the same way as the\n   <em>\n    Omnicare\n   </em>\n   statement.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-70\">\n   Moreover, GC's statement provides for even more latitude than the statement in\n   <em>\n    Omnicare.\n   </em>\n   The defendant in\n   <em>\n    Omnicare\n   </em>\n   said that it believed it was in compliance with relevant laws.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4265567\" index=\"34\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/769/455/#p469\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   GC made no similar statement regarding the state of its compliance-it simply said that it had implemented policies to ensure compliance while also fully acknowledging that compliance may not always happen. Further, it seems doubtful that a reasonable investor's opinion on whether to invest is dependent upon a vague statement that the company tries to comply with the law. Surely reasonable investors strive to invest in companies they believe comply with the laws without the company having to explicitly say it tries to operate lawfully. That is, it is hard to see how a reasonable investor would find this statement material.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-71\">\n   However, while the Court has serious doubts regarding the materiality of this statement, it will heed the Sixth Circuit's warning that courts \"must tread lightly at the motion-to-dismiss stage\" for materiality because they do not have a full understanding of investor behavior and economic consequences.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4265567\" index=\"35\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/769/455/#p469\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4265567\" index=\"35\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/769/455/#p469\">\n    at 472\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . The Court also notes that, as alluded to above, statements regarding compliance may have gained materiality as the FCPA-issues emerged. Thus, the Court assumes without deciding that this statement is material.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-72\">\n   The statement must still be objectively false or misleading, though. As explained above, Plaintiff alleged that this statement\n   was false because Defendants knew, or were reckless in not knowing, that it \"lacked the components of an effective corporate compliance program ....\" (Doc. 69 \u00b6 185). The problem is that GC never said it had an effective compliance program. It made no guarantees for its compliance program. Rather, it said that there are \"[v]arious laws and regulations associated with our current international operations\" and \"[t]hese laws and regulations include import and export requirements, U.S. laws\n   <em>\n    such as the FCPA\n   </em>\n   , and local laws prohibiting payments to governmental officials and other corrupt practices.\" (Doc. 75-16 at 13) (emphasis added). Immediately thereafter, it said that \"we have implemented policies and procedures designed to ensure compliance with\n   <em>\n    these laws\n   </em>\n   ,\" which includes the FCPA. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) (emphasis added).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-73\">\n   Thus, not only does Plaintiff miss the mark by inferring any sort of assurance as to the program's efficacy, he also incorrectly implies that GC said anything specific about the FCPA. GC acknowledged that its overseas operations were subject to several laws and regulations-including the FCPA-but it then only made a vague statement that it had policies and procedures designed to ensure compliance with all applicable laws. This is the extent of what GC chose to say in these disclosures: laws apply, and it has implemented policies and procedures to ensure compliance with those laws.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-74\">\n   There is therefore a wide discrepancy between what GC actually said and what Plaintiff argues is misleading.

Plaintiff argues that \"defendants had no basis to make any representation as to the existence or effectiveness of the Company's FCPA compliance program.\" (Doc. 101 at 25). As an initial matter, GC did not make any representation as to the effectiveness of its program-it merely said that it had programs designed to ensure compliance with laws. Further, GC did have a basis to make an assurance regarding the simple existence of its program since the SEC found that GC explicitly addressed the applicability of the FCPA and had procedures designed to prevent illegal payments. (Doc. 75-13 at 3).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-75\">\n   Rather than support Plaintiff's argument, the cases he relies upon further reveal why it is inappropriate to find that this statement was false or misleading. In\n   <em>\n    Invacare\n   </em>\n   , the corporate defendant made assurances that it had addressed specific FDA observations and issued other statements regarding particular concerns brought by the FDA.\n   <em>\n    Gov't of Guam Ret.

The court found that these statements were not false because the defendant\n   <em>\n    did\n   </em>\n   have a program in place and it made no statements regarding the program's efficacy-it simply stated that it existed.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12419339\" index=\"41\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/277/500/#p512\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   Further likening this case to GC's, the\n   <em>\n    Menaldi\n   </em>\n   defendant had also committed several FCPA violations and had entered into agreements with the DOJ and SEC.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12419339\" index=\"42\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/277/500/#p512\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12419339\" index=\"42\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/277/500/#p512\">\n    at 507-08\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Thus, the system had similarly failed by allowing violations.

While the effects of this problem created large issues for GC, that does not change the nature of what GC actually said. Further, \"[u]nder plaintiff's theory of its case, any company that has a compliance program and discloses that program in even the most austere terms would be required,\n   <em>\n    ipso facto\n   </em>\n   , to disclose any possible deviation that came to its attention.\"\n   <em>\n    In re FBR Inc.

Supp. 2d 346\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 360 (S.D.N.Y. 2008). Because GC made no assurances beyond saying that it had programs designed to ensure compliance with laws, this statement is not objectively false or misleading and is not actionable under \u00a7 10(b).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-78\">\n   <strong>\n    d. Because GC did not know that its overseas operations would fail if it could not rely on corrupt business practices, it did not have a duty to disclose this as a risk.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-79\">\n   Plaintiff's second category of allegedly false and misleading statements is also related to GC's identified risks. Plaintiff argues that GC disclosed risks regarding \"the economic, political and other risks of maintaining facilities and selling products in foreign countries,\" including \"the difficulty of effectively managing diverse global operations\" in countries like Angola, Egypt, India, and Thailand. (Doc. 69 \u00b6 177). According to Plaintiff, this was false and misleading because \"(i) these disclosures omitted the fact that one of the primary risks facing the Company's operations in these countries as of the date of these statements was the fact that General Cable was dependent upon corruption in order to facilitate it[s] overseas operations, and (ii) an inability to sustain these practices, either due to political reform abroad or enforcement at home, would have a material adverse impact on the Company's continued operations in those countries.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 186). That this was the primary risk facing GC's overseas operations is clear because when GC had to stop engaging in FCPA violations, it \"was forced to divest its overseas operations.\" (Doc. 101 at 32). Plaintiff therefore connects GC's decision to exit its operations in its Asia Pacific and Africa operations in October of 2014 with its FCPA violations: GC was working with the DOJ and SEC at the time it closed these divisions and, presumably, was stopping its corrupt practices, which allegedly\n   caused its business to fail in those countries.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-80\">\n   Again, the statement must be actionable in order to satisfy the \u00a7 10(b) requirements, meaning it must be a statement or omission pertaining to a material fact.\n   <em>\n    Omnicare\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4265567\" index=\"45\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/769/455/#p469\">\n    769 F.3d at 470\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

App'x 483\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (6th Cir. 2015), the Court finds that the decision in\n   <em>\n    Zaluski\n   </em>\n   is a better comparison. In\n   <em>\n    Zaluski\n   </em>\n   , the defendant allegedly failed to disclose that it had violated its contract with the State of Tennessee and that it was at risk of sanctions or termination of the contract.\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3567480\" index=\"57\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/527/564/#p572\">\n    527 F.3d at 574\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . This information constituted the \"potential consequences\" of the defendant's actions and was \"soft information that did not give rise to a duty to disclose.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3567480\" index=\"58\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/527/564/#p572\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   This was also true because the plaintiffs did not allege any facts that revealed the defendant knew any of these potential consequences would occur.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3567480\" index=\"59\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/527/564/#p572\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   Therefore, there was no duty to disclose.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-84\">\n   Similarly, any forced cessation of GC's operations in these countries was a potential consequence of its actions and it was not information that had to be disclosed until it was virtually certain to occur. Plaintiff has connected the dots and inferred that, because GC announced it was ending these operations after it had to stop making corrupt payments, it must have depended upon those corrupt payments in order to sustain those operations. However, when GC announced it was exiting these divisions, it said it was doing so in order to focus on \"core strategic operations in North America, Latin America and Europe.\" (Doc. 69 \u00b6 167). Plaintiff has offered only his own inference as to why that was not true-he has not alleged any\n   facts that GC actually closed its operations because they were unsustainable without corruption.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-85\">\n   More importantly, though, Plaintiff alleged no facts that GC knew that it would have to shut down these operations if it could not continue engaging in corrupt practices. Similar to\n   <em>\n    Zaluski\n   </em>\n   , Plaintiff has not alleged facts that reveal GC knew more than it said. Because this was soft information, Plaintiff has to meet the actual-knowledge standard and Plaintiff has altogether failed to do so. For this reason, GC did not have to disclose the alleged risk that was omitted.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-86\">\n   <strong>\n    e. Plaintiff has sufficiently plead that GC's statements regarding its internal controls were false and misleading.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-87\">\n   Plaintiff's final challenged statement relates to GC's internal accounting controls. In its 2011 Form 10-K, 1Q 2012 Form 10-Q, and 2Q 2012 Form 10-Q, GC stated that its management had conducted an evaluation of its internal control's effectiveness, and \"[a]s a result of this process, management concluded that internal control over financial reporting was effective as of December 31, 2011.\" (Doc. 69 \u00b6 179). GC did not repeat this statement throughout the Class Period, though, and it was not re-issued after June 29, 2012-thus, it was not issued for the majority of the Class Period. Apparently due to this absence, Plaintiff also alleged that particular certifications are allegedly false because they too refer to internal controls. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 183). Pursuant to Section 302 of the Sarbanes Oxley Act of 2002, Kenny and Robinson signed CEO and CFO 302 Certifications, respectively (\"SOX certifications\"). (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 181). These were regularly repeated throughout the Class Period, and made several general assurances regarding disclosure mechanisms and internal controls over financial reporting.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-88\">\n   According to Plaintiff, these statements were false or misleading because the Defendants \"knew or were severely reckless in not knowing that ... General Cable lacked the components of an effective corporate compliance program for FCPA, including sufficient policies, procedures and\n   <em>\n    internal controls\n   </em>\n   designed to ensure compliance with the FCPA's anti-bribery and accounting provisions ....\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 185) (emphasis added). This was false because, as the NPA revealed, GC knew that it had deficiencies in its internal controls and it \"knowingly and willfully failed to implement and maintain an adequate system of internal accounting controls designed to detect and prevent corruption or otherwise illegal payments by its agents.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 187). The CDO likewise found that \"a number of [the Company's] foreign subsidiaries lacked internal accounting controls for doing business with third-party entities on sales to government customers.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 188) (alteration in original).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-89\">\n   Defendants argue that this statement is not false or misleading because it does not relate to the FCPA. GC was making assurances as to its financial reporting, which, it argues, is unrelated to whether it had internal controls for FCPA violations. (Doc. 75 at 30). This is true for both GC's general statement regarding its internal controls and for the SOX certifications: neither has any connection to the FCPA. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 31).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-90\">\n   The Court shares some of GC's concerns, particularly regarding the SOX Certifications. This is partially due to PSLRA requirements. As explained above, plaintiffs are required to \"specify\n   <em>\n    each statement\n   </em>\n   \" that it alleges is misleading. 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 78u-4(b)(1) (emphasis added). For the other challenged other statements, Plaintiff clearly satisfies this requirement: in each, Plaintiff highlights particular provisions that he alleges to be false so that it is abundantly certain as to what his claim\n   is based upon. (Doc. 69 \u00b6\u00b6 176-77, 179). That same sort of clarity is missing from Plaintiff's allegations for the SOX certifications since Plaintiff, seemingly, includes the majority of the SOX certification without emphasizing any particular portion as being false or misleading. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 183). This is especially problematic because, as another court has recognized, SOX certifications do not make any explicit reassurances regarding the FCPA.\n   <em>\n    In re InVision Tech., Inc. Sec. Litig.\n   </em>\n   , No. C04-03181 MJJ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"60\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2006%20WL%20538752\">\n    2006 WL 538752\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *6 (N.D. Cal. Jan. 24, 2006). Thus, in the instance where clarity is most crucial, Plaintiff has seemingly failed to meet his burden.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-91\">\n   Plaintiff does attempt to cast some light on the matter in a later paragraph by lumping various phrases from the SOX certifications-GC had \"designed\" internal controls \"to ensure\" disclosure of material information and \"provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of its financial reporting\"-in with the other challenged statements in a large paragraph that explains why\n   <em>\n    all\n   </em>\n   of these statements are false. (Doc. 69 \u00b6 185). The Court assumes, then, that these are the statements Plaintiff believes to be misleading or false in the SOX certifications.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-92\">\n   While the Court is aware that this barely passes PSLRA-muster and that other courts have declined to find these SOX certifications false based on FCPA-related reasons, the Court finds that Plaintiff has adequately plead the falsity of these statements. Plaintiff is largely able to do so because the NPA and CDO clearly reveal that, despite GC's assurances otherwise, it had deficient internal accounting controls and it incorrectly recorded various corrupt payments. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 187-88). Because the problematic internal accounting controls identified in the NPA and CDO are technically part of GC's overall financial internal control system, the fact that GC had admitted deficiencies and that it failed to fix these issues renders its statements regarding the efficacy of these internal controls misleading in light of information now known.\n   <em>\n    Omnicare\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4265567\" index=\"61\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/769/455/#p469\">\n    769 F.3d at 478\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Thus, this statement is actionable.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-93\">\n   <strong>\n    f. However, Plaintiff has failed to adequately plead that GC acted with the requisite scienter in making this final category of statements.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-94\">\n   Finally, Plaintiff must satisfy the PSLRA's strict scienter requirement by pleading \"with particularity facts giving rise to a strong inference that the defendant acted with the required state of mind.\" 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 78u-4(b)(2). The Supreme Court has defined scienter in the securities fraud context as the intent to deceive, manipulate, or defraud.\n   <em>\n    Ernst &amp; Ernst v. Hochfelder\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6175010\" index=\"62\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/425/185/#p193\">\n    425 U.S. 185\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 193,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6175010\" index=\"63\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/425/185/#p193\">\n    96 S.Ct. 1375\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6175010\" index=\"64\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/425/185/#p193\">\n    47 L.Ed.2d 668\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1976). The Sixth Circuit has identified various kinds of scienter requirements that are dependent upon the kind of statement that is being made. If a statement is present or historical fact, \"the state of mind required is recklessness. Recklessness is defined as highly unreasonable conduct which is an extreme departure from the standards of ordinary care. While the danger need not be known, it must be at least so obvious that any reasonable man would have known of it.\"\n   <em>\n    Miller v. Champion Enters.

While Plaintiff's allegations regarding the SOX certifications lack clarity, it seems that the relied-upon provisions would also constitute soft information. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Doc. \u00b6 185) (alleging that GC falsely or misleadingly stated it \"had 'designed' sufficient internal controls 'to ensure' the disclosure of material information and 'provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of [its] financial reporting ....' \") (alteration in original). Thus, Plaintiff must allege sufficient facts to establish that GC actually knew the falsity of its statements when it issued them and that it acted to defraud the public.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Omnicare\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4265567\" index=\"69\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/769/455/#p469\">\n    769 F.3d at 483-84\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (imputing knowledge of a corporate officer but dismissing because there were insufficient facts to establish that the corporation acted to defraud the public).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-96\">\n   As to whether GC knew what it was saying was false, the Court finds that it did not. As GC has repeatedly argued, it was making statements regarding its overall financial reporting system and the internal controls for its general financial status. Per the NPA, what GC actually knew to be deficient was a very specific problem: GC\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-97\">\n   knowingly and willfully failed to implement and maintain an adequate system of internal accounting controls\n   <em>\n    designed to detect and prevent corruption or otherwise illegal payments by its agents.\n   </em>\n   In particular ... General Cable had deficient internal accounting controls that did not require and/or ensure ... (a)\n   <em>\n    due diligence for the retention of third-party agents and distributors\n   </em>\n   ; (b)\n   <em>\n    proof that services had been rendered by third-parties before payment could be made to them\n   </em>\n   ; (c)\n   <em>\n    oversight of the payment process to ensure that payments were made pursuant to contractual terms or that payments were reasonable and legitimate.\n   </em>\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-98\">\n   (Doc. 75-12 at A-3) (emphases added).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-99\">\n   Thus, what GC knew about its internal controls is at odds with the general assurance it made regarding internal controls for its overall financial status. The same is true for the SOX certifications: these, again, ensure nothing specific to the FCPA and are collective statements over its company-wide financial system. It is hard to say that, based on this very specific sort of deficiency, GC actually knew its broad, company-wide statements were false.\n   <footnotemark>\n    8\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-100\">\n   This disparity also weighs against finding that GC acted with the requisite intent to defraud the public. The Sixth Circuit often looks to a list of nine non-exhaustive factors that are relevant in determining if a defendant acted with scienter. These are commonly referred to as the\n   <em>\n    Helwig\n   </em>\n   factors and they are:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-101\">\n   (1) insider trading at a suspicious time or in an unusual amount; (2) divergence between internal reports and external statements on the same subject; (3) closeness in time of an allegedly fraudulent statement or omission and the later disclosure of inconsistent information; (4) evidence of bribery by a top company official; (5) existence of an ancillary lawsuit charging fraud by a company and the company's quick settlement of that suit; (6) disregard of the most current factual information before making statements; (7) disclosure of accounting information in such a way that its negative implications could only be understood by someone with a high degree of sophistication; (8) the personal interest of certain directors in not informing disinterested directors of an impending sale of stock; and (9) the self-interested motivation of defendants in the form of saving their salaries or jobs.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-102\">\n   <em>\n    Helwig v.

The Sixth Circuit has stated that the second factor-divergence between internal reports and external statements on the same subject-is often the \"key factor\" in finding the defendant acted with scienter.\n   <em>\n    Dougherty\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12518835\" index=\"74\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/905/971/#p978\">\n    905 F.3d at 981\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . By at least December of 2012, there was an actual report regarding FCPA-related deficiencies in GC's internal controls-the Internal Audit report from Angola. As the NPA stated, the Internal Audit revealed issues with GC's relationship with a third-party agent and \"[t]hereafter, the Company failed to establish adequate internal accounting controls and General Cable Condel continued to make corrupt payments to the agent in excess of the contractually required amounts.\" (Doc. 75-12 at A-5). Thus, this constitutes an internal report that presented divergent information from GC's assurances that its \"internal control over financial reporting was effective\" and that it had \"designed\" appropriate internal controls to \"provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of its financial reporting.\" (Doc. 69 \u00b6\u00b6 179, 185) (alteration omitted). This also constitutes current information that was disregarded.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-104\">\n   However, the disparity between what GC knew and what it said, again, cuts in GC's favor for not finding scienter. As the Sixth Circuit has found, disparities in generality matter for scienter as well as for finding a statement false or misleading.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Omnicare\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4265567\" index=\"75\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/769/455/#p469\">\n    769 F.3d at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   484 ;\n   <em>\n    Doshi v.

Hence, these factors do not weigh strongly in favor of scienter since the false statement does not align with the known information.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-105\">\n   Plaintiff argues that the third, fourth, and fifth\n   <em>\n    Helwig\n   </em>\n   factors also weigh in favor of scienter. (Doc. 101 at 46-47). The third factor, closeness in time, is foreclosed by Sixth Circuit precedent. In the first\n   <em>\n    Doshi\n   </em>\n   decision, the panel rejected an 86-day gap between an allegedly fraudulent statement and later disclosure of inconsistent information.\n   <em>\n    Doshi\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5920504\" index=\"78\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/823/1032/#p1042\">\n    823 F.3d at 1042\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Here, there is almost the exact same timeframe. GC allegedly issued a false statement in its May 6, 2014, disclosure since it contained the same SOX certifications. However, it revealed on August 1, 2014, that it had reported potential violations in Angola to the SEC and DOJ. (Doc. 69 \u00b6\u00b6 163-64, 213). This is an 87-day gap, which is one day longer than what the\n   Sixth Circuit rejected in\n   <em>\n    Doshi.\n   </em>\n   For this reason, this does not weigh in favor of scienter.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-106\">\n   The fourth factor-evidence of bribery by a top official-does not clearly weigh in favor of scienter, either. The widespread bribery in this instance constituted the actual FCPA violations. Plaintiff does not explain how this also weighs in favor of scienter in that GC was acting to defraud the public. The fifth factor, ancillary fraud lawsuits and the company's quick settlement, likewise does not weigh in favor of scienter. Plaintiff argues that this factor is satisfied through GC's settlements with the DOJ and the SEC. (Doc. 101 at 47). It is technically true that this factor considers settlements entered into by the defendant. However, to say that GC's settlement is like the settlements encompassed by this factor is an untenable proposition. GC self-reported results of its internal investigations to the SEC and DOJ, and received credit for fully cooperating with the three-year investigation that it brought upon itself through its self-reporting. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Doc. 69 \u00b6\u00b6 170, 173; Doc. 75-12 at 1; Doc. 75-13 at 11). This\n   <em>\n    Helwig\n   </em>\n   factor refers to the traditional lawsuit in which the opposing party initiates the investigation into the corporation's wrongdoing by filing a lawsuit, and the corporation acts quickly to sweep information under the rug before it is known to the public.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    City of Monroe Emps. Ret. Sys. v. Bridgestone Corp.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1546958\" index=\"79\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/399/651/#p685\">\n    399 F.3d 651\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 685 (6th Cir. 2005) (describing how Firestone entered into settlements in which the parties agreed to conceal discovery, \"damaging documents\" were returned to Firestone, and the settlement agreements themselves were sealed). Consequently, this factor does not weigh in favor of scienter.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-107\">\n   Therefore, only two\n   <em>\n    Helwig\n   </em>\n   factors weigh in favor of scienter, and their strength is undercut by the wide gap that separates what GC knew and what it said. The Court also acknowledges that, while the\n   <em>\n    Helwig\n   </em>\n   factors have been used in post-\n   <em>\n    Tellabs\n   </em>\n   cases, the Court must heed\n   <em>\n    Tellabs\n   </em>\n   instruction \"not to scrutinize each allegation in isolation but to assess all the allegations holistically.\"\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3573048\" index=\"80\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/551/308/#p322\">\n    551 U.S. at 326\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3573048\" index=\"81\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/551/308/#p322\">\n    127 S.Ct. 2499\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Dougherty\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12518835\" index=\"82\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/905/971/#p978\">\n    905 F.3d at 981\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (determining which of the\n   <em>\n    Helwig\n   </em>\n   factors were satisfied). Thus, while these factors weigh against finding scienter, the Court will construe the complaint as a whole and consider these factors as part of its overall analysis.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-108\">\n   Plaintiff also points to the NPA and CDO admissions as evidence of scienter. As explained above, these admissions establish that GC knew its internal controls were inadequate regarding third-party agents. (\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   , Doc. 69 \u00b6 246). These admissions further establish that GC knew it committed FCPA violations. (\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 243). But these admissions do not reveal that GC knew it was misleading the public when it made a statement regarding its entire financial reporting status and certain SOX certifications. The NPA and CDO reference internal accounting control deficiencies, but they, again, do not contain any admission covering GC's financial reporting and controls overall. Hence, what is revealed in the NPA and CDO is only a small part of the statement GC made to its investors.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-109\">\n   Plaintiff also relies on confidential witnesses to establish that GC knew of \"several incidents that raised 'red flags' regarding the lack of internal controls ... at the Company's overseas subsidiaries.\" (Doc. 69 \u00b6 260). But these alleged \"red flags\" are simply CW 2's accounts that certain foreign subsidiaries did not willingly cooperate with Internal Auditors. While the Defendants argue that the confidential witness accounts should be discounted for various reasons, the Court need not decide\n   what weight to give this account since it is altogether irrelevant regarding GC's statement for its overall financial internal control mechanisms. That particular foreign subsidiaries did not enjoy working with Internal Auditors, or even that they actively sought to conceal activities from them, does not make this statement fraudulent.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-110\">\n   Plaintiff argues that, because GC's overseas operations were part of GC's core operations, it is reasonable to believe GC was aware of these issues when it made the above statements. (Doc. 101 at 45-46). Plaintiff is correct that courts have found statements regarding a company's core operations to be more indicative of scienter.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    In re Huffy Corp., Sec. Litig.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5876268\" index=\"83\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-2d/577/968/#p1000\">\n    577 F. Supp. 2d 968\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 1000 (S.D. Ohio 2008). Assuming that GC derived the majority of its revenue from its overseas operations,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Doc. 69 \u00b6 60, the Court is still unpersuaded that this means that GC acted to defraud when it made these statements. The inquiry is the same: whether GC had scienter when it made a generalized statement for its financial reporting overall while knowing a very specific issue related only to FCPA compliance. The fact that GC relied heavily upon its overseas operations still does not establish that, first, GC actually knew these statements were false because of an FCPA-related issue, and, secondly, that it was acting with scienter.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-111\">\n   Because we must employ a holistic analysis, the Court also considers the fact that GC repurchased its own stock during the Class Period when the stock prices were allegedly inflated. (\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   , Doc. 75-7 at 24). Other courts have found that this \"undermines any inference of scienter.\"\n   <em>\n    I.B.E.W. v. Limited Brands, Inc.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4177915\" index=\"84\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-2d/788/609/#p631\">\n    788 F. Supp. 2d 609\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 631 (S.D. Ohio 2011) ;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Beaver Cty. Retirement Bd. v.

Ohio Mar. 25, 2009) (finding that the Company's decision to repurchase its stock, when viewed in conjunction with other factors, weighed against scienter). The Court joins these other courts and finds that this weighs against scienter as to GC.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-112\">\n   To summarize, GC knew that a very specific facet of its internal controls had failed and was inadequate. GC knew that it did not have controls that provided a sufficient framework for dealing with third-parties in the identified subsidiaries and GC knew that this allowed it to violate the FCPA in particular countries. But this does not mean that GC knew its overall internal controls over financial reporting were not effective, nor does it mean that GC knew its SOX certifications-which do not specifically relate to the FCPA-were false. Moreover, none of these facts alleged establish that GC acted with scienter when issuing these statements, even when viewed collectively. The facts do not change the nature of what was said-that, generally, GC believed its financial controls were effective and designed to ensure material information was reported.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-113\">\n   Further, as mandated by\n   <em>\n    Tellabs\n   </em>\n   , the Court must consider other plausible inferences.\n   <em>\n    Tellabs Inc.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3573048\" index=\"86\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/551/308/#p322\">\n    551 U.S. at 314\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3573048\" index=\"87\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/551/308/#p322\">\n    127 S.Ct. 2499\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . The most plausible inference is a reiteration of the same principle echoed throughout this section: when GC made assurances regarding its financial reporting internal controls overall, it did not believe it was speaking falsely, nor was it acting to deceive the public. Further, while GC mentioned the FCPA in its \"Risk Factors\" section, these statements appeared in other sections of GC's SEC filings and Plaintiff has not alleged that these sections referenced the FCPA. Consequently, it is entirely plausible that, when GC made statements regarding its overall financial reporting system, it believed them to be sound despite a specific FCPA-related issue. For these reasons, Plaintiff fails to\n   adequately plead scienter and his \u00a7 10(b) claim against GC fail.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-114\">\n   <strong>\n    g. Plaintiff also fails to adequately plead that Robinson and Kenny acted with the requisite scienter.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-115\">\n   Plaintiff's \u00a7 10(b) claim is also brought against the Individual Defendants, Robinson and Kenny. (Doc. 69 \u00b6 300). Each has challenged this claim on similar bases as GC. The Court finds that Plaintiff failed to adequately allege that either Robinson and Kenny acted with scienter, and his claims against them likewise fail.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-116\">\n   Plaintiff includes several allegations regarding Robinson and what he supposedly knew that contradicted GC's statements described above. The most damning piece of evidence against Robinson is his receipt of the 2012 Internal Audit report regarding the issues in Angola. Plaintiff alleges that Robinson received a copy of the official audit report that identified potentially illegal payments that were being made to an agent in Angola. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 156). The SEC commented on potential aspects of this Internal Audit and noted that, thereafter, GC \"failed to implement any additional internal accounting controls in response to the internal audit report until at least eight months after General Cable issued the audit report, in August 2013.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 158). It is reasonable to infer based on the SEC-provided information, then, that it related to internal control deficiencies.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-117\">\n   While Robinson argues that his receipt of this Internal Audit does not actually mean he \"reviewed the 2012 report, let alone that he would have understood it meant that bribery was taking place if he had read it,\" the Court accepts as true that Robinson was required to sign off on all audit reports and presume that Robinson read it prior to signing off on it. (\n   <em>\n    Compare\n   </em>\n   Doc. 77 at 11,\n   <em>\n    with\n   </em>\n   Doc. 69 \u00b6 156). Thus, by December of 2012, Robinson was allegedly aware that there were issues with GC's internal controls in Angola that allowed these violations to occur. Plaintiff relies on several confidential witness accounts, as well, in establishing that Robinson was aware of issues. Many of these statements regard GC's FCPA-compliance program in general,\n   <footnotemark>\n    9\n   </footnotemark>\n   though, and\n   are not related to issues regarding the internal controls.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-118\">\n   Plaintiff does allege one specific confidential witness encounter that allegedly \"raised 'red flags' regarding the sufficiency of General Cable's internal controls and compliance program\" at GC's overseas subsidiaries. (Doc. 69 \u00b6 149). CW 2 recounted that GC's ROW subsidiaries were difficult to work with and described internal documentation that revealed these subsidiaries did not want to cooperate with Internal Auditors. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 149, 151-52). This account is problematic for two reasons. The first is that it is hard to see how this clearly should have informed Robinson that his statement regarding the internal controls for GC's overall financial reporting system was false or misleading. Second, while CW 2 allegedly told Robinson about these incidents, Plaintiff does not allege specifically\n   <em>\n    when\n   </em>\n   CW 2 spoke to Robinson about this. This is an important omission because it does not establish that, when Robinson spoke, he knew what he said was false or misleading.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Omnicare\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4265567\" index=\"88\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/769/455/#p469\">\n    769 F.3d at 483\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-119\">\n   Plaintiff also points to statements made by Robinson because these statements pertain to \"[his] close oversight and knowledge of the Company's internal controls\" and this contributes to a finding of scienter. (Doc. 101 at 43). Plaintiff includes Robinson's statements that the \"management team,\" and Robinson specifically, owned the issue of internal controls and had \"shrunk the decision-making of the company and the flow of information\" to make sure that management was aware of what was happening in GC's operations. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) (alterations omitted). None of this pleads with particularity what the \"flow of information\" revealed to Robinson, though, or what he actually knew. Similar statements have been rejected for failing to plead with particularity.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Indiana Elec. Workers' Pension Trust Fund IBEW v.

Robinson's general statements are likewise insufficient to establish scienter. Thus, while there are specific allegations regarding Robinson in the Amended Complaint, they fail to establish Robinson knew what he certified was false.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-120\">\n   While Plaintiff regularly alleges what GC and Robinson knew in the Amended Complaint, the same is not true as to Individual Defendant, Kenny. The most that Plaintiff alleges about Kenny is that CW 1 believed Kenny relied on Robinson for compliance issues and that Kenny and Robinson both had a \"head in the sand\" attitude. (Doc. 69 \u00b6\u00b6 92, 96). As explained above, the PSLRA imposes exacting pleading requirements on plaintiffs that require them to plead \"with particularity facts giving rise to a strong inference that the defendant acted with the required state of mind.\" 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 78u-4(b)(2)(A). These two allegations wholly fail to meet that standard.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-121\">\n   Despite Plaintiff's contentions, Kenny is named seemingly on the sole basis of his position. Plaintiff alleges that\n   Kenny had access to material non-public information and he therefore knew that the company had omitted material information or that its representations were false. (Doc. 69 \u00b6 33). But Sixth Circuit law is clear: \"fraudulent intent cannot be inferred merely from the Individual Defendants' positions in the Company and alleged access to information. Without more, Plaintiffs fail to meet the PSLRA requirement to state with particularity facts giving rise to a strong inference of scienter.\"\n   <em>\n    PR Diamonds, Inc. v.

App'x 418\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 432 (6th Cir. 2004). The most concrete allegation as to Robinson-the 2012 Internal Audit report-is not connected to Kenny in any way. Plaintiff offers no allegations that Kenny ever received the report, let alone read it and understood there were issues with the Angolan internal controls. Thus, even where Plaintiff's allegations are strongest, they are unconnected to Kenny.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-122\">\n   Plaintiff attempts other routes to establish the scienter of both Individual Defendants, but they likewise fail. Plaintiff asserts that the SOX certifications are indicative of scienter, but this is a high bar for plaintiffs to clear. There must be facts that a defendant was severely reckless in signing the SOX certifications before this counts for scienter.\n   <em>\n    Ley v.

Here, while Plaintiff relies upon the SOX certifications as being a false or misleading statement, he has not alleged facts that either defendant was severely reckless when they signed them.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-123\">\n   Plaintiff also argues that the \"sheer magnitude of the FCPA compliance issues facing the Company during the Individual Defendants' tenure strongly supports an inference\" of scienter. (Doc. 101 at 44). When courts have reviewed whether a violation was substantial enough to indicate knowledge, they have consistently found that the violations must be so \"great in magnitude[ ] that they should have been obvious to a defendant.\"\n   <em>\n    Cardinal Health\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5388900\" index=\"96\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-2d/426/688/#p724\">\n    426 F.

Lead Plaintiff insists that $ 13 million-which was paid out over 12 years-was significant enough to a company of this size to inevitably be discovered. (Doc. 101 at 44).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-124\">\n   Breaking down these payments reveals how nominal they are considering the amount of money consistently passing through GC: in Angola specifically, $ 450,000 was paid between 2003 and 2009, then $ 8.7 million between 2009 and 2013. (Doc. 75-12 at A-3 - A-4). Despite Plaintiff's assertion, it certainly does not \"strain credulity\" that the Individual Defendants' were unaware of these payments. The cases that Plaintiff relies upon further reveal how these FCPA issues failed to reach such a degree that Kenny and Robinson must have been aware of it.\n   <em>\n    Cardinal Health\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5388900\" index=\"97\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-2d/426/688/#p724\">\n    426 F.

GC's violations are not of similar magnitude.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-125\">\n   Further, while Plaintiff relies on Kenny's and Robinson's background as support for the contention that they should\n   have been aware of corruption issues, this still fails to state with particularity actual facts that Kenny and Robinson acted with scienter. Perhaps Kenny and Robinson should have known about and been concerned with issues before they acted. But, as Plaintiff alleges, GC had been operating in highly corrupt countries for several years and it had not uncovered any FCPA violations prior to 2011. (Doc. 69 \u00b6\u00b6 35, 36, 94). Upon Robinson's receipt of the 2012 Internal Audit report, it was not fraudulent for him to continue believing that the internal controls overall were still effective. Even if CWs 1 and 2 regularly reported issues to him, these accounts do not establish with any certainty that Robinson did not believe what he certified to be true. The same is even more true of Kenny. Kenny cannot be held responsible for making false statements if there are no facts that reveal he knew, or even suspected, the situation was different than what he assured investors in these filings. No confidential witness recounted any conversations with Kenny, nor were these FCPA issues so pervasive, obvious, or extensive such that he must have known about them prior to his disclosures.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-126\">\n   GC has admitted that it committed FCPA violations in several countries that allowed it to incur substantial profits. GC has also paid for those violations through disgorgements of millions in profits. While GC's disclosures regarding its FCPA violations hurt investors' share prices, that does not necessarily mean that GC acted to deceive its investors through statements it made. The reasons for that are explained at length above. For these reasons, Plaintiff's \u00a7 10(b) claim against all defendants is dismissed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-127\">\n   <strong>\n    3.

Recklessness is \"highly unreasonable conduct which is an extreme departure from the standards of ordinary care. Recklessness requires more than negligence and is akin to conscious disregard.

The first is that the only actionable statement refers to GC's internal controls over financial reporting and these witness's account are largely related to other inefficiencies and flaws of the FCPA-compliance program in general, and do not reveal that Robinson knew about issues related to the internal controls specifically. Second, what these witnesses reveal regarding even the FCPA program in general is largely unhelpful since \"[c]onfidential sources cannot be used to merely parrot conclusory allegations contained in the complaint, but [they] may assist securities fraud plaintiffs so long as they are not vague and conclusory.\"\n    <em>\n     Zwick Partners, LP v.
