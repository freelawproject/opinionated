The warrant application describes a single message exchange between Lacy and \"tiffany4ualways,\" in which \"tiffany4ualways\" solicited nude photos from Lacy's undercover account. The warrant application does not allege that any actual photos were exchanged, nor does it allege that any specific details regarding the photographs were discussed. The only information provided about the content of the solicited pictures is that they were to be nude photos, specifically \"full naked body pics face all in pic.\" Appl. at 4.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   \"Child pornography,\" as that term is defined in Virginia law, requires more than mere nudity of an underaged person.\n   <em>\n    Doyle\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5873561\" index=\"42\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/650/460/#p471\">\n    650 F.3d at 473\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

The solicited photos, therefore, do not meet the definition of \"child pornography\" under Virginia law.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5873561\" index=\"44\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/650/460/#p471\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   Accordingly, the solicitation of the nude photos by \"tiffany4ualways,\" without more, did not constitute a criminal offense. Simply put, no crime occurred during the message exchange.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   Therefore, the question becomes whether the one message exchange, soliciting naked photos, by itself creates probable cause that child pornography would be recovered on electronic devices in the home identified in response to the Cox subpoena.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Ornelas\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11746351\" index=\"45\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/517/690/#p696\">\n    517 U.S. at 696\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11746351\" index=\"46\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/517/690/#p696\">\n    116 S.Ct. 1657\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (probable cause exists where \"contraband or evidence of a\n   <em>\n    crime\n   </em>\n   will be found\") (emphasis added) (citations omitted);\n   <em>\n    Gates\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6187462\" index=\"47\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/462/213/#p239\">\n    462 U.S. at 238-39\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6187462\" index=\"48\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/462/213/#p239\">\n    103 S.Ct. 2317\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (probable cause exists if the totality of the circumstances show a \"fair probability that contraband or evidence of a\n   <em>\n    crime\n   </em>\n   will be found in a particular place\") (emphasis added). The warrant application\n   describes only a single message exchange on one day between \"tiffany4ualways,\" purportedly a sixteen year-old girl, and Lacy's undercover internet account, also purportedly that of a sixteen year-old girl. Importantly, the warrant application does not contain any facts tending to suggest that \"tiffany4ualways\" was not, in fact, a sixteen year-old girl. There are also no facts in the warrant application suggesting that \"tiffany4ualways\" had solicited photos of any kind from any persons other than from Lacy's undercover account, or that \"tiffany4ualways\" ever contacted Lacy again in the intervening weeks between the date of the one contact and message exchange, October 19, 2018, and the date of the application, November 14, 2018. Under this scenario, there was a \"fair probability\" that this message exchange was an isolated incident between a sixteen year-old girl and a person whom she thought was another sixteen year-old girl.\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   Although the warrant application describes the behaviors typical of child pornography collectors, which information is based on Lacy's experience investigating this type of crime,\n   <footnotemark>\n    7\n   </footnotemark>\n   there are no facts suggesting that \"tiffany4ualways\" is a collector of child pornography. Without additional information, is it not reasonable to presume that an online Kik account, purportedly operated by a sixteen year-old girl, is in fact being operated by a collector of child pornography. Due to the substantial probability, based only on the information in the warrant application, that \"tiffany4ualways\" was a sixteen year-old child who had not committed any criminal offense, the warrant application did not demonstrate a \"fair probability\" that evidence of a crime would be found on the electronic devices in the home associated with the \"tiffany4ualways\" account, and the warrant application therefore did not provide the state magistrate with a \"substantial basis\" to issue a search warrant.\n   <em>\n    Gates\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6187462\" index=\"49\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/462/213/#p239\">\n    462 U.S. at 236, 238-39\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6187462\" index=\"50\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/462/213/#p239\">\n    103 S.Ct. 2317\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Accordingly, the court\n   <strong>\n    FINDS\n   </strong>\n   that the November 14, 2018 warrant application to search the electronic devices in the Defendant's residence did not demonstrate probable cause for the search.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   <strong>\n    IV.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   Although the warrant application did not demonstrate probable cause to search the electronics devices in the Defendant's residence, this does not end the court's inquiry on the Defendant's Motion to Suppress. Rather, the court must consider whether the \"good faith\" exception applies to the November 16, 2018 search.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   There are no facts before the court that the warrant application contained false or misleading information, or that the state magistrate failed to act as a neutral decisionmaker. The Defendant has also not argued the search warrant failed to state with particularity the place to be searched or the things to be seized.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Mot. Suppress. Accordingly, the good faith exception will apply in this case, unless the warrant application is \"so lacking in indicia of probable cause\" that the executing officers could not have reasonably believed there was probable cause for the search.\n   <em>\n    Leon\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11340969\" index=\"51\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/468/897/#p915\">\n    468 U.S. at 923\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11340969\" index=\"52\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/468/897/#p915\">\n    104 S.Ct. 3405\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   At the June 11, 2019 hearing, the court received limited evidence and argument on the good faith exception, with the focus of counsel primarily fixed on the issue of probable cause.\n   <footnotemark>\n    8\n   </footnotemark>\n   Specifically, S.D. Lacy, the undercover investigator who applied for the search warrant at issue, did not testify. There is no evidence before the court of whether Lacy knew any facts which were relevant to his probable cause determination, but were omitted from his search warrant application, or of what his training and experience in child pornography cases actually was at the time. Accordingly, at this stage of the proceedings, the court has not been provided with sufficient information to fully consider the potential applicability of the good faith exception to this case.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Thomas\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12519190\" index=\"53\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/908/68/#p73\">\n    908 F.3d at 73\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   <strong>\n    V.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   Having concluded that the warrant application did not demonstrate probable cause to search the electronic devices in the Defendant's residence, the court\n   <strong>\n    DIRECTS\n   </strong>\n   the parties to contact the Calendar Clerk to schedule a second hearing to address the good faith exception.
