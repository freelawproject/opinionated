In 2011, the Justice Department's Office of Legal Counsel (\"OLC\") issued a formal opinion declaring that the Wire Act only punishes activities associated with sports gambling. Last year, the OLC changed its mind. It now asserts that the Act also covers lotteries and other forms of gambling that do not involve sports.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   The New Hampshire Lottery Commission has long offered lottery games such as Powerball that necessarily use interstate wires. Fearing that these games, which produce substantial revenue for the State, will be deemed to be criminal activities under the OLC's current interpretation of the Wire Act, the Commission filed a complaint in this court seeking both a declaratory judgment that the Act is limited to sports gambling and an order under the Administrative Procedure Act setting aside the OLC's new interpretation. One of the Commission's vendors also filed a complaint that has been joined with the current action, seeking declaratory relief.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   Before me are the Government's motion to dismiss for lack of standing and the parties' cross-motions for summary judgment. As I explain below, I agree with the plaintiffs that they have standing to sue. Based on the text, context, and structure of the Wire Act, I also conclude that the Act is limited to sports gambling. Accordingly, I deny the Government's motions and grant the plaintiffs' motions for summary judgment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   <strong>\n    I.\n    <em>\n     BACKGROUND\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   <strong>\n    A. The Wire Act\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   The relevant portion of the Wire Act provides:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-14\">\n   Whoever being engaged in the business of betting or wagering knowingly uses a wire communication facility for the transmission in interstate or foreign commerce of bets or wagers or information assisting in the placing of bets or wagers on any sporting event or contest, or for the transmission of a wire communication which entitles the recipient to receive money or credit as a result of bets or wagers, or for information assisting in the placing of bets or wagers, shall be fined under this title or imprisoned not more than two years, or both.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201084\">\n    18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1084\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   Section 1084(a) consists of two clauses. The first clause makes it a crime for anyone engaged in the business of gambling to use a wire communication facility \"for the transmission in interstate or foreign commerce of bets or wagers or information assisting in the placing of bets or wagers on any sporting event or contest.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201084\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   The second clause prohibits \"the transmission of a wire communication which entitles the recipient to receive money or credit as a result of bets or wagers, or for information assisting in the placing of bets or wagers.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201084\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   The key question this case presents is whether the limiting phrase \"on any sporting event or contest\" in \u00a7 1084(a)'s first clause modifies all references to \"bets or wagers\" in both clauses or only the single reference it directly follows in the first clause. If, as the OLC concluded in 2011, the sports-gambling modifier limits each reference to \"bets or wagers,\" then both clauses apply only to sports gambling. On the other hand, if the OLC's current interpretation is correct, then \u00a7 1084(a)'s first\n   clause prohibits the interstate transmission of both sports and non-sports bets or wagers but punishes the interstate transmission of information only if the information assists in the placing of bets or wagers on sports. It also follows from the OLC's current interpretation that \u00a7 1084(a)'s second clause is unconstrained by the sports-gambling modifier.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   <strong>\n    B. The OLC Opinions\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   The path that leads to both OLC opinions begins in 2009, when New York and Illinois asked the Department of Justice whether in-state sales of lottery tickets via the internet would violate the Wire Act if those sales caused information to be transmitted across state lines. The Department referred the matter to the OLC for a formal opinion. In 2011, the OLC responded by concluding that \"interstate transmissions of wire communications that do not relate to 'a sporting event or contest,'\n   <extracted-citation index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201084\">\n    18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1084\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a), fall outside of the reach of the Wire Act.\"\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Virginia A. Seitz,\n   <em>\n    Whether Proposals by Illinois and New York to Use the Internet and Out-of-State Transaction Processors to Sell Lottery Tickets to In-State Adults Violate the Wire Act, Memorandum Opinion for the Assistant Attorney General, Criminal Division\n   </em>\n   , U.S. Dept. Just. 1 (Sept. 20, 2011) (\"2011 OLC Opinion\" or \"2011 Opinion\"), Doc. No. 2-4.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   The OLC arrived at this conclusion by first determining that the phrase \"on any sporting event or contest\" in the first clause of \u00a7 1084(a) applies to the transmissions of both \"bets or wagers\" and \"information assisting in the placing of bets or wagers.\" 2011 OLC Opinion at 5. Noting that the statutory text could be read either way, the OLC explained that it was \"difficult to discern\" why Congress would forbid the interstate transmission of all types of bets or wagers but only prohibit the transmission of information assisting in the placing of bets or wagers that concern sports.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201084\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   The more reasonable inference, according to the OLC, was that Congress intended that the prohibitions \"be parallel in scope.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201084\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   Next, the OLC concluded that the phrase \"on any sporting event or contest\" also modifies the references to \"bets or wagers\" in \u00a7 1084(a)'s second clause.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"6\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201084\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"6\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201084\">\n    at 7\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . The OLC explained that the references to \"bets or wagers\" in the second clause are best understood as shorthand references to \"bets or wagers on any sporting event or contest\" as described in the first clause.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"7\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201084\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   The 2011 Opinion also relied heavily on the Act's legislative history to confirm its interpretation of the section's limited scope.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"8\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201084\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"8\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201084\">\n    at 6-10\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   In 2018, the OLC reversed course and released a new opinion concluding that \"the prohibitions of\n   <extracted-citation index=\"9\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201084\">\n    18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1084\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a) are not uniformly limited to gambling on sporting events or contests.\"\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Steven A. Engel,\n   <em>\n    Reconsidering Whether the Wire Act Applies to Non-Sports Gambling, Memorandum Opinion for the Acting Assistant Attorney General, Criminal Division\n   </em>\n   , U.S. Dept. Just. 23 (Nov. 2, 2018) (\"2018 OLC Opinion\" or \"2018 Opinion\"), Doc. No. 2-5. The OLC now reasoned that the plain text of \u00a7 1084(a) unambiguously requires that all but one of the section's prohibitions apply to gambling generally.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"10\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201084\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"10\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201084\">\n    at 7, 11\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   The OLC based its new reading on the syntactic structure of \u00a7 1084(a). Relying heavily on a canon of statutory construction commonly referred to as the \"rule of the last antecedent,\" the OLC concluded that the use of the sports-gambling modifier in the section's first clause applies only to the prohibition on the interstate transmission of \"information assisting in the placing of bets or wagers\" and not the\n   transmission of \"bets or wagers\" themselves.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"11\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201084\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"11\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201084\">\n    at 7-8\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   The OLC then concluded that the use of the sports-gambling modifier in \u00a7 1084(a)'s first clause should not be carried forward into the section's second clause.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"12\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201084\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"12\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201084\">\n    at 11\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . The two clauses are distinct \"[a]s a matter of basic grammar\" and \"[i]t would take a considerable leap for the reader to carry that modifier both backward to the first prohibition of the first clause, then forward across the entire second clause,\" the OLC reasoned.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"13\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201084\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   The OLC acknowledged its earlier concern that this reading of \u00a7 1084(a) would produce anomalous results.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"14\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201084\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"14\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201084\">\n    at 14-15\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

New Hampshire Lottery System\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   The Lottery Commission offers multiple types of lottery games. Those games include instant ticket and draw games that offer tickets for sale at brick-and-mortar retailers, multi-jurisdictional games such as Powerball and Mega Millions that permit tickets to be purchased either in stores or through the internet, and \"iLottery\" games that sell tickets exclusively through the internet. Each game involves the use of interstate wire transmissions.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   The Lottery Commission contracts with a vendor, Intralot, Inc., to provide a computer gaming system (\"CGS\") to manage the games and a back-office system (\"BOS\") to manage inventory and sales data. Its CGS and BOS servers for traditional retailer-based lottery games are located in Barre, Vermont, with a disaster recovery location in Strongsville, Ohio.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   Brick-and-mortar retailers employ lottery terminals that connect the retailer to the CGS and BOS systems via the internet, a cellular network, or a satellite connection. The terminals send and receive different types of data based on the type of game. For example, in an instant ticket game, a player purchases a pre-printed ticket and scratches it to reveal the result. The lottery terminal then communicates with the CGS to activate the ticket, validate the result, and record the sale and payment of prizes. Draw games require players to purchase sets of numbers for a future draw. The retailer requests a wager transaction from the CGS through the terminal. The CGS generates a wager in the system and sends the information to the terminal. In both types of transactions, the data travels between a lottery terminal in New Hampshire and CGS servers in Vermont and Ohio.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   The Lottery Commission also offers a variety of multi-jurisdictional games, including\n   Powerball, Mega Millions, Tri-State Lotto, and Lucky for Life. Like the in-state games, ticket sales for these games typically occur through communications between lottery terminals in New Hampshire and CGS servers in Vermont and Ohio.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   For verification purposes, bets for multi-state games are then sent from those CGS locations to two independent control system servers in New Hampshire over the internet. The Lottery Commission also shares sales and transaction data with member states over the internet. Finally, once a jackpot is won, the participating lotteries transfer their portions of the jackpot to the jurisdiction that sold the winning ticket. This is typically done via a wire transfer or an automated clearing house process.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   In September 2018, the Lottery Commission also began to offer e-instant and draw games, including Powerball and Mega Millions, via its internet platform or \"iLottery.\" NeoPollard Interactive LLC, its vendor, operates a separate CGS with servers located in New Hampshire. The system uses geo-location data from a player's computer or mobile device to ensure the player can only make a bet or wager while physically located in New Hampshire. Although all financial transactions and bets must begin and end in New Hampshire, the Commission states that it cannot guarantee that intermediate routing of data or information ancillary to a transaction does not cross state lines.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   Given the way in which these systems operate, the Lottery Commission contends that the implementation of the 2018 OLC Opinion may result in the suspension of all lottery sales by the Commission, resulting in an annual loss of over $ 90 million in state revenue.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   <strong>\n    D. Lottery Systems and \"iGaming\" in Amici States\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   The State of New Jersey, the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania, and the Michigan Bureau of State Lottery\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   have filed amicus briefs in support of the plaintiffs.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   They describe the impact the 2018 OLC Opinion would have on their respective state-run lotteries. The lottery systems in those states are substantially similar to New Hampshire's, including the types of games offered and their reliance on interstate wires.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   In addition, New Jersey and Pennsylvania have legalized some forms of online gambling or \"iGaming.\" Those states permit state-licensed private companies to offer online casino and poker games to players within the state. New Jersey also has a shared agreement with Delaware and Nevada allowing online poker players from those states to play together.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   <strong>\n    E. Procedural History\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   The Lottery Commission filed its complaint and a concurrent motion for summary judgment on February 15, 2019. The\n   Commission seeks both a declaratory judgment that the Wire Act does not extend to state-conducted lottery activities and an order setting aside the 2018 OLC Opinion pursuant to the Administrative Procedure Act (\"APA\"),\n   <extracted-citation index=\"20\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=5%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20701\">\n    5 U.S.C. \u00a7 701\n   </extracted-citation>\n   <em>\n    et seq.\n   </em>\n   Later that day, NeoPollard Interactive LLC, the vendor that supports New Hampshire's iLottery system, and its 50% owner, Pollard Banknote LTD (collectively \"NeoPollard\") filed a complaint and a concurrent motion for summary judgment. NeoPollard seeks a judgment declaring that the Wire Act is limited to gambling on sporting events. I consolidated the NeoPollard action with the Lottery Commission action on February 22, 2019.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   The Government responded by filing a motion to dismiss the complaints pursuant to Rule 12(b)(1), because the plaintiffs lack standing to sue, and Rule 12(b)(6), because the complaints fail to state viable claims for relief. With the parties' consent, I converted the Government's request for relief pursuant to Rule 12(b)(6) into a Rule 56 motion for summary judgment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   <strong>\n    II.\n    <em>\n     ANALYSIS\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   The Government has challenged the plaintiffs' standing to sue.

I then turn to the parties' cross-motions for summary judgment, which raise two issues: (1) whether the Lottery Commission's APA claim fails because the 2018 OLC Opinion is not \"final agency action,\" and (2) whether the Wire Act is limited to sports gambling.

At the far end of the spectrum, where a threat of prosecution cannot be considered imminent, are cases in which \"an unambiguous disclaimer of coverage by the prosecutor\" would likely eliminate the threat of prosecution.\n   <em>\n    Hemp Council\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11480324\" index=\"57\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/203/1/#p5\">\n    203 F.3d at 5\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   The plaintiffs in this case easily satisfy the imminence requirement. First, they have openly engaged for many years in conduct that the 2018 OLC Opinion now brands as criminal, and they intend to continue their activities unless they are forced to stop because of a reasonable fear\n   that prosecutions will otherwise ensue. Second, the risk of prosecution is substantial. After operating for years in reliance on OLC guidance that their conduct was not subject to the Wire Act, the plaintiffs have had to confront a sudden about-face by the Department of Justice. Even worse, they face a directive from the Deputy Attorney General to his prosecutors that they should begin enforcing the OLC's new interpretation of the Act after the expiration of a specified grace period. Given these unusual circumstances, the plaintiffs have met their burden to establish their standing to sue.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   The Government challenges this conclusion by arguing that the likelihood that the plaintiffs will face prosecution under the Wire Act is low, because the 2018 OLC Opinion does not explicitly conclude that state agencies, state employees, and state vendors are subject to prosecution under the Act. I reject this argument because the record tells a different story.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-50\">\n   It is worth remembering that the 2011 OLC Opinion responded to a request from two states for an opinion as to whether they could sell lottery tickets online without violating the Wire Act. In concluding that the Wire Act did not apply to non-sports gambling such as lotteries, the 2011 Opinion did not even hint at the possibility that states would be exempt from the Act's proscriptions. Had the OLC believed that states were excluded from the Act's coverage, it could have responded to the states' request by simply informing them that they were not subject to the Act. To infer from the OLC's silence on this point that it might conclude in the future that state actors are not subject to the Wire Act requires an unwarranted speculative leap. This is especially true given the fact that a Department of Justice official warned the Illinois lottery in 2005 that the contemplated online sale of lottery tickets by the state\n   <em>\n    would\n   </em>\n   violate the Wire Act.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Letter from Laura H. Parsky, Deputy Assistant Attorney General, to Carolyn Adams, Illinois Lottery Superintendent (May 13, 2005), Doc. No. 57-2.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-51\">\n   Any remaining doubt about the OLC's view on the issue is dispelled by both the 2018 OLC Opinion itself and the Government's actions after its issuance. In defending its decision to reinterpret the Wire Act, the OLC noted that \"[s]ome States ... began selling lottery tickets via the Internet after the issuance of our 2011 Opinion.\"\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   2018 OLC Opinion at 22. The OLC deemed these reliance interests insufficient to warrant continued adherence to the 2011 Opinion.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11480324\" index=\"58\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/203/1/#p5\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11480324\" index=\"58\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/203/1/#p5\">\n    at 22-23\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . After the 2018 OLC Opinion issued, the Deputy Attorney General issued the Enforcement Directive informing federal prosecutors that ensuing prosecutions should be deferred for a 90-day grace period to give entities that \"relied on the 2011 OLC Opinion time to bring their operations into compliance with federal law.\"\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Enforcement Directive, Doc. No. 2-6. That guidance did not suggest that state entities that had relied on the 2011 Opinion would be exempt from prosecution after the grace period expired. Accordingly, nothing the Department of Justice said or did before the plaintiffs filed their complaints gave states like New Hampshire any reason to believe that state actors would not be prosecuted under the OLC's new interpretation of the Wire Act. When the complaints were filed, therefore, the plaintiffs faced a sufficiently imminent threat of prosecution to give them standing to sue.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-52\">\n   <em>\n    Hemp Council\n   </em>\n   supports this conclusion. There, in a hearing before the New Hampshire legislature, a representative of the Drug Enforcement Administration (\"DEA\") asserted that cultivating hemp plants violated federal law.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Hemp Council\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11480324\" index=\"59\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/203/1/#p5\">\n    203 F.3d at 3\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . The First Circuit reasoned that the DEA had made its position clear and there was no \"reason to doubt the government's zeal\" in enforcing its position.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11480324\" index=\"60\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/203/1/#p5\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11480324\" index=\"60\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/203/1/#p5\">\n    at 5\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . That position established that the plaintiffs, who were deterred from farming hemp, faced a \"realistic\" threat of prosecution.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11480324\" index=\"61\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/203/1/#p5\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   So too here.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-53\">\n   In resisting this assessment, the Government relies heavily on an April 8, 2019 memorandum issued by the Deputy Attorney General.

First, at present, the State Actor Directive is nothing more than a temporary moratorium that cannot sustain a mootness claim.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    City of Los Angeles v. Lyons\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11298204\" index=\"74\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/461/95/#p101\">\n    461 U.S. 95\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 101,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11298204\" index=\"75\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/461/95/#p101\">\n    103 S.Ct. 1660\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11298204\" index=\"76\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/461/95/#p101\">\n    75 L.Ed.2d 675\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1983) (temporary moratorium on use of challenged policy did not moot the case). Second, to the extent that the Government holds out the possibility that the temporary moratorium might become permanent at a later date, its argument is purely speculative. The Government has rejected the only argument put forward by the Lottery Commission that states are not covered by the Act, and it has otherwise failed to identify any alternative legal theory as to why state actors might be exempt.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Doc. No. 70. Speculation that such a viable theory may exist cannot provide a sufficient foundation to moot a live controversy.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-56\">\n   The Government's remaining standing argument is less conventional, but it too fails to persuade. It is based on the mistaken premise that a plaintiff has standing to seek pre-enforcement review only when challenging a criminal statute on constitutional grounds.

But the court did not uphold the convictions on that basis.

Both agree that \u00a7 1084(a) includes two general clauses that each, in turn, prohibit two types of wire transmissions.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"156\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201084\">\n    18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1084\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a).

Should each reference to \"bets or wagers\" be interpreted to mean \"bets or wagers on any sporting event or contest\"? Or is the phrase \"bets or wagers\" in the first, third, and fourth prohibitions untethered to the sports-gambling modifier, such that those prohibitions apply to all forms of gambling? Each party contends that the plain language of \u00a7 1084(a) mandates its position. I conclude that the text does not provide an unambiguous answer to this question.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-85\">\n   Starting with the first clause, the Government contends that the syntactic structure of the clause and the rule of the last antecedent make it plain that the sports-gambling modifier does not apply to the first prohibition (\"the transmission ... of bets or wagers\").

Section 1084(a)'s first clause is expressly limited to transmissions \"in interstate or foreign commerce\" but the transmissions prohibited by the second clause do not contain this limitation. Nevertheless, both OLC opinions agree that the interstate-commerce modifier is borrowed from the first clause and applied to the transmissions prohibited by the second clause.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   2011 OLC Opinion at 7; 2018 OLC Opinion at 13.

As the OLC concluded in 2011, the omission of the interstate-commerce\n   modifier from the second clause \"suggests that Congress used shortened phrases in the second clause to refer back to terms spelled out more completely in the first clause.\" 2011 OLC Opinion at 7. I agree with the 2011 OLC Opinion that this instance of borrowing by the drafters of \u00a7 1084(a) gives textual support for similarly importing the sports-gambling modifier into the second clause.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-92\">\n   The Government's arguments for discounting the interpretive force of the interstate-commerce modifier fall short. According to the 2018 Opinion, the interstate-commerce modifier is different because, unlike the sports-gambling modifier, which appears \"midway through the list\" of the Wire Act's prohibitions, the interstate-commerce modifier appears at the beginning of the Act's four prohibitions.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   2018 OLC Opinion at 13. This argument is flawed. The fact that the modifier precedes the four references to \"bets or wagers\" is irrelevant because it does not modify \"bets or wagers.\" Instead, the interstate-commerce modifier immediately limits the term \"transmission\" in the first clause. Viewed properly, the use of the interstate-commerce modifier supports the plaintiffs' argument. Like the statute's use of the sports-gambling modifier, the interstate-commerce modifier follows the term it modifies in the first clause (\"transmission\") and is borrowed to modify the same term in the second clause. This consistent pattern of borrowing indicates that Congress used shorthand in the second clause to refer to terms delineated \"more completely in the first clause.\"\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   2011 OLC Opinion at 7.\n   <footnotemark>\n    10\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-93\">\n   The Government also contends that the constitutional avoidance doctrine strengthens the rationale for applying the interstate-commerce modifier across the entire statute to avoid doubts about Congress's regulatory authority. The same is obviously not the case with the sports-gambling modifier. But the doctrine of constitutional avoidance is not the only reason to import the modifier into the second clause. The text and context provide sufficient indicia that the second clause borrows that term from the first clause.\n   <em>\n    cf.\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Bass\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6173129\" index=\"185\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/404/336/#p339\">\n    404 U.S. at 338-47\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6173129\" index=\"186\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/404/336/#p339\">\n    92 S.Ct. 515\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (applying traditional canons of constructions, including coherency, to extend interstate-commerce modifier to all three statutory prohibitions while disclaiming reliance on constitutional avoidance).

Limiting the Wire Act to sports gambling conforms to this rule. It avoids significant coherence problems that result from the OLC's current interpretation and it construes the Wire Act in harmony with another gambling statute that Congress enacted the same day as the Wire Act.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-98\">\n   The OLC's 2018 Opinion, by contrast, produces an unlikely reading of \u00a7 1084(a) that the 2011 OLC Opinion avoids. Under the current interpretation, the section's first clause prohibits transmissions of all bets or wagers but bars transmissions of information that assist the placement of only those bets or wagers that concern sports. The incongruous results that follow from this interpretation are problematic because, as the OLC explained in 2011 when it rejected this construction, \"it is difficult to discern why Congress, having forbidden the transmission of\n   <em>\n    all\n   </em>\n   kinds of bets or wagers, would have wanted to prohibit only the transmission of information assisting in bets or wagers concerning sports.\"\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   2011 OLC Opinion at 5. Even in its current opinion, the OLC continues to recognize that \"[t]here is a logic to this reasoning.\"\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   2018 OLC Opinion at 14. This logic, however, did not persuade the OLC in 2018 for two reasons: first, because Congress might have wanted to specifically target transmissions of information on sports bets or wagers given the special importance of such information to this form of gambling; and second, because \"Congress might have been worried that an unfocused prohibition on transmitting any information that 'assisted' in any sort of gambling whatsoever would criminalize a range of speech-related conduct.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 14-15. These arguments are unpersuasive. Such speculation may show that the OLC's 2018 interpretation is not patently absurd. But it does not establish that its reading is a better construction of an ambiguous text.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-99\">\n   The OLC's current construction of the second clause gives rise to an even more serious coherence problem. If, as the OLC now contends, the clause is read without the sports-gambling modifier, the two clauses of \u00a7 1084(a) cannot easily be reconciled: The second clause prohibits transmissions that enable a recipient to receive payment for information that facilitates both\n   <em>\n    sports and non-sports\n   </em>\n   gambling, but the first clause prohibits only transmissions of\n   <em>\n    sports-related\n   </em>\n   information. In other words, the OLC's current interpretation incongruously permits information transmissions that facilitate non-sports gambling in the first clause while criminalizing transmissions that enable a person to receive payment for the same transmissions in the second clause.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-100\">\n   The Government's only explanation for this inconsistency is that Congress might have had a special interest in preventing gambling-related payouts via the wires, regardless of whether the money was for lawful or unlawful activities. This rationale\n   is inadequate. It does not explain why a rational legislator would have designed a statute that prevents a lawful gambling business from sending or receiving payment for a business activity that the statute does not prohibit. It is bizarre to authorize an activity but prohibit getting paid for doing it.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-101\">\n   Consider a vendor who contracts with an online casino to solicit players. The contract guarantees the vendor payment for every new player who bets $ 100 at the site. The Wire Act permits the vendor to send emails to players enticing them and explaining the site's games. But, under the OLC's current interpretation, the Act prohibits the vendor from receiving (and the casino from sending) money transfers for supplying that information. That makes little sense. The incoherence that plagues the statute when the sports-gambling modifier is not imported into the second clause significantly undermines the OLC's current construction of \u00a7 1084(a). Limiting the entire section to sports gambling renders the statute coherent and makes the 2011 Opinion the better reading of the text.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-102\">\n   Reading \u00a7 1084(a) to apply only to sports gambling also finds support in another gambling statute passed the same day as the Wire Act.\n   <em>\n    cf.\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    United States v.

Those arguments do not withstand scrutiny. Section 1084(b) creates a safe harbor for interstate wire communications transmitting (1) \"information for use in news reporting of sporting events or contests,\" and (2) \"information assisting in the placing of bets or wagers on a sporting event or contest\" between two states where \"betting on that sporting event or contest\" is legal.\n   <extracted-citation index=\"211\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201084\">\n    18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1084\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (b). The Government maintains that \u00a7 1084(b) supports its contention that Congress repeated the phrase \"sporting event or contest\" when it wanted to apply it beyond its nearest referent. I am unpersuaded by the Government's argument. Section 1084(a) repeats the same phrase (\"bets or wagers\") four times, so the question is whether Congress used that phrase as a shorthand for \"bets or wagers on a sporting event or contest.\" By contrast, \u00a7 1084(b) has varied formulations of phrases followed by the sports-gambling modifier.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"212\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201084\">\n    id.\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (\"\n   <em>\n    news reporting of\n   </em>\n   sporting events or contests,\" \"\n   <em>\n    bets or wagers on\n   </em>\n   a sporting event or contest,\" and \"\n   <em>\n    betting on that\n   </em>\n   sporting event or contest\") (emphasis added). Unlike the recurrent \"bets or wagers,\" those diverse phrases are not susceptible to an abridged reference. As a result, \u00a7 1084(b) requires that the modifier be repeated.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-105\">\n   The Government also contends that because \u00a7 1084(d) is not limited to sports gambling, neither is \u00a7 1084(a). That reading misunderstands the role of \u00a7 1084(d). Section 1084(d) requires a common carrier to discontinue the operation of a wire facility if it is notified that the facility is being used \"for the purpose of transmitting or receiving gambling information in interstate or foreign commerce in violation of Federal, State or local law.\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"213\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201084\">\n    18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1084\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (d). The provision thus incorporates federal, state, and local gambling laws that go beyond the scope of \u00a7 1084(a).

If anything, the legislative history supports the plaintiffs' position.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-109\">\n   The original version of \u00a7 1084(a) would have imposed criminal penalties on anyone who \"leases, furnishes, or maintains any wire communication facility with intent that it be used for the transmission in interstate or foreign commerce of bets or wagers, or information assisting in the placing of bets or wagers, on any sporting event or contest, or knowingly uses such facility for any such transmission.\" S. 1656, 87th Cong. \u00a7 2 (1961) (as introduced) (emphasis added) (excerpt appended to this opinion as Appendix A).\n   <footnotemark>\n    12\n   </footnotemark>\n   It is undisputed\n   that the original text was unequivocally limited to sports gambling.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   2018 OLC Opinion at 16; 2011 OLC Opinion at 6.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-110\">\n   After conducting hearings in June 1961, the Senate Judiciary Committee, in collaboration with the Department of Justice, proposed an amendment to the bill.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   S. Rep. No. 87-588, at 1-2 (1961);\n   <em>\n    Report of Proceedings: Hearing Before the S. Comm. on the Judiciary, Exec. Sess.\n   </em>\n   , 87th Cong. 54-55 (1961). Reflected in the enacted text, the amendment made three modifications to \u00a7 1084(a) : (1) it changed the class of covered persons to those who are \"engaged in the business of betting or wagering,\" (2) it added a second clause prohibiting payment-related transmissions, and (3) it removed the commas before and after the phrase \"or information assisting in the placing of bets or wagers\" in the first clause.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   S. 1656, 87th Cong. (as reported in Senate, July 24, 1961) (excerpt appended to this opinion as Appendix B). As I have explained, without those commas, it is not clear whether both prohibitions in the first clause are limited to sports gambling.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-111\">\n   The Government's amici contend that the legislative history shows that the removal of the commas was intended to expand the scope of \u00a7 1084(a) to cover all gambling. They principally rely on three pages from the transcript of the hearing before the Senate Committee on the Judiciary on June 20, 1961.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    The Attorney General's Program to Curb Organized Crime and Racketeering: Hearings on S. 1653, S. 1654, S. 1655, S. 1656, S. 1657, S. 1658, S. 1665 Before the S. Comm. on the Judiciary\n   </em>\n   , 87th Cong. 277-79 (1961). Those pages reflect an exchange between Senator Carey Kefauver and Herbert Miller, the Assistant Attorney General in charge of the Department's Criminal Division.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"214\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201084\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   According to the Government's amici, Senator Kefauver suggested three changes to the original text during the exchange: (1) changing the covered persons to those engaged in the business of gambling; (2) adding prohibitions to cover transmissions of money; and (3) expanding the scope of the bill from sports gambling to all forms of gambling.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"215\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201084\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   The Committee's subsequent amendment, discussed above, was intended to incorporate all three changes, the argument goes. Whereas the changed wording of the bill reflected the first two changes, punctuation purportedly accomplished the third. According to the Government's amici, the deletion of the two commas \"was an efficient way\" to accommodate Senator Kefauver's proposal for the Wire Act to encompass all bets and wagers, not just sports-related ones.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Doc. No. 68 at 130.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-112\">\n   The idea that this change in punctuation was intended to broaden the scope of \u00a7 1084(a) is too speculative to carry any weight. First, the legislative record suggests, if anything, that the omission of the second comma (appearing directly before the phrase \"on any sporting event or contest\") was inadvertent. In the original version of the bill, this comma carried the weight of signaling that the proposed law\n   prohibited only transmissions related to sports gambling.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    supra\n   </em>\n   at 149-50. The amendment, as reported in the Senate, contained a redline version showing what was stricken from the original text.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Appendix B. That redline, however, incorrectly reports that the second comma was\n   <em>\n    never\n   </em>\n   a part of the original text, suggesting that its omission from the amended version of the bill was not an intentional act.\n   <em>\n    Compare\n   </em>\n   Appendix A,\n   <em>\n    with\n   </em>\n   Appendix B.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-113\">\n   Second, in reporting on the amendment, the Senate Judiciary Committee explained that it was offered to alter the class of covered persons and expand its prohibitions to include \"money or credit\" communications.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   S. Rep. No. 87-588, at 2 (1961). The report does not even hint that by omitting a single comma from the original bill, the Committee also intended to dramatically expand the scope of prohibited transmissions from \"bets or wagers ... on any sporting event or contest\" to all \"bets or wagers.\"\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   Adopting the argument of the Government's amici on this point requires a speculative leap that I am unwilling to make.\n   <em>\n    cf.\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Whitman v.

In that description, Deputy Attorney General Byron White explained that, as amended:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-115\">\n   [The Wire Act] is aimed now at those who use the wire communication facility for the transmission of bets or wagers\n   <em>\n    in connection with a sporting event\n   </em>\n   and also who use the facility for the transmission of the winnings, as suggested by Senator Kefauver.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-116\">\n   <em>\n    Report of Proceedings: Hearing Before the S. Comm. on the Judiciary, Exec. Sess.\n   </em>\n   , 87th Cong. 55 (1961) (emphasis added). Consistent with the Committee's report, White confirmed that the amendment incorporated Senator Kefauver's first two proposals and suggested that, even as amended, the bill continued to be limited to sports gambling.\n   <footnotemark>\n    13\n   </footnotemark>\n   <em>\n    Compare\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9505769\" index=\"219\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/531/457/#p468\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9505769\" index=\"219\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/531/457/#p468\">\n    ,\n   </extracted-citation>\n   <em>\n    with\n   </em>\n   S.

The Act's legislative history, if anything, confirms this conclusion. Accordingly, I construe all four prohibitions in \u00a7 1084(a) to apply only to bets or wagers on a sporting event or contest.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-119\">\n   <strong>\n    C.

Here, declaratory relief is appropriate because the plaintiffs face a credible threat of prosecution, their interests are sufficiently affected, and a judgment will resolve the dispute.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Verizon New Eng., Inc. v.

As the First Circuit has explained, where an agency has made a definitive interpretation of a criminal law, the Declaratory Judgment Act provides \"a way to resolve the legal correctness of [the] position without subjecting an honest businessman to criminal penalties.\"\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Hemp Council\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11480324\" index=\"225\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/203/1/#p5\">\n    203 F.3d at 5\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (citation omitted).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-123\">\n   The parties nevertheless disagree as to whether a declaratory judgment should be limited to the parties or have universal effect.\n   <footnotemark>\n    15\n   </footnotemark>\n   The plaintiffs maintain that declaratory relief \"necessarily extends beyond the [Commission] itself.\" Doc. No. 58 at 21. The Government contends that any declaratory relief must apply only to the parties to the case. I agree with the Government.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-124\">\n   Declaratory judgments do not bind non-parties. The Act allows me to \"declare the rights and other legal relations of any interested\n   <em>\n    party seeking such declaration\n   </em>\n   .\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"226\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%202201\">\n    28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2201\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a) (emphasis added). It thus limits me to declaring the rights and legal relations of the plaintiffs seeking the declaration. It \"does not\n   contain any provisions indicating that declaratory judgments are authoritative vis-\u00e0-vis nonparties to the litigation.\"\n   <em>\n    Mass. Delivery Ass'n v.

The idea that a declaration necessarily binds non-parties finds no support in the statute or in caselaw.\n   <footnotemark>\n    16\n   </footnotemark>\n   Accordingly, I decline to give my declaratory judgment the broader scope that the plaintiffs seek.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-125\">\n   It is clear, however, that the judgment binds the parties beyond the geographic boundaries of my district.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Restatement of Judgments \u00a7 1 (1942). And such an effect is necessary here. NeoPollard's iLottery system is currently used in Michigan and New Hampshire, and its system \"has been configured according to state specifications for deployment\" in Virginia.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Siver Decl., Doc. No. 10-2 at 2-3. The Lottery Commission's operations similarly extend beyond the State. Its servers are located in Vermont, with a disaster recovery location in Ohio.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-126\">\n   The State sells multi-jurisdictional games as a member of the Tri-State Lotto Compact along with Maine and Vermont, sells Powerball and Mega Millions through the Multi-State Lottery Association, and is a member of a consortium of 25 states and the District of Columbia that sells Lucky for Life.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   McIntyre Decl., Doc. No. 2-2 at 5. The multi-jurisdictional games \"involve up to 48 states and territories.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 6. My declaration thus binds the United States vis-\u00e0-vis NeoPollard and the Lottery Commission everywhere the plaintiffs operate or would be otherwise subject to prosecution.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-127\">\n   Michigan, as an amicus, presents a somewhat more novel theory for extending the declaratory judgment to non-parties on behalf of the Lottery Commission. The argument goes like this: New Hampshire, as a member of the Multi-State Lottery Association, benefits financially from the large scale of multi-jurisdictional games such as Powerball. If another state, such as Michigan, shuttered its state lottery, then the overall revenues of Powerball would decline. If the revenues of Powerball decline, then the share of Powerball revenue that New Hampshire receives would decrease. Therefore, because I should ensure that New Hampshire not suffer any adverse financial effect, \"anything short of nationwide equitable relief is hollow.\"\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Doc. No. 37 at 11.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-128\">\n   New Hampshire has not advocated for this theory in its pleadings or at oral argument, and the issue is insufficiently developed factually and legally. For instance, no party has addressed whether extending relief to the Multi-State Lottery Association members would be relief for an \"interested party seeking such declaration\" as the Declaratory Judgment Act requires.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"228\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%202201\">\n    28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2201\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a).

No. 1. Finally, although the factual record specifies that the Commission recorded operating revenue of $ 337.8 million\n   for the 2018 fiscal year,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   McIntyre Decl., Doc. No. 2-2 at 2, it is bereft of information detailing the sources of that revenue, much less how another state's cessation of operations would affect its bottom line. In such a situation, granting relief on the Powerball-as-joint-venture theory would risk going \"beyond the bounds of the complaint and the evidence in this case.\"\n   <em>\n    Diaz-Fonseca v.

According to this reading, the third clause criminalizes the use of the wires \"to seek information that would assist [a gambling enterprise] in the placing of bets or wagers.\" Doc. No. 58 at 16. I am unpersuaded by the Commission's argument because it either creates a conflict between the second and fourth prohibitions (assuming the sports-gambling modifier applies only to the former) or renders the fourth prohibition superfluous (if the sports-gambling modifier applies to both prohibitions).
