He seeks damages and injunctive relief arising out of defendants' alleged violations of\n   New York Public Health Law \u00a7 18 (\" \u00a7 18\"), which prohibits health care providers from charging qualified persons more than $0.75 per page for copies of their medical records. This Opinion addresses the defendants' second motion to dismiss this action.

February 22, 2018) (\"February 2018 Opinion\"). In sum, Vicky Ortiz (\"Ortiz\"), through her attorney, made a written request to NYPH for her medical records in October 2016. The request indicated that, pursuant to \u00a7 18(2)(e), NYPH could not charge Ortiz more than $0.75 per page. NYPH's contractor, a predecessor in interest to CIOX, charged Ortiz $1.50 per page for her medical records. Ortiz paid the bill and subsequently filed this class action. Shortly thereafter, CIOX unilaterally refunded Ortiz's credit card the amount charged above the $0.75 statutory maximum.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   The February 2018 Opinion dismissed several counts of the FAC but allowed a single claim, for a violation of \u00a7 18(2)(e), to go forward.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at *6.

NYPH and CIOX assert that the plaintiff lacks standing to pursue either damages or injunctive relief, that \u00a7 18(2)(e) does not accord a private right of action, that the plaintiff's proposed class is overbroad, and that CIOX's copying costs are not at issue in this litigation.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   Because \u00a7 18(2)(e) does not accord a private right of action, only the first two claims are addressed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   <em>\n    <strong>\n     Discussion\n    </strong>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   I.

They argued that Ortiz lacked standing to pursue her claims for damages because the FAC failed to allege that she, rather than her attorney, was injured. They also argued that the FAC failed to allege a likelihood of future injury sufficient to confer standing for injunctive relief. They further argued that, even if Ortiz had standing at one point, her claims became moot when CIOX unilaterally refunded to her credit card the amount of the alleged overcharge. Each of these arguments was rejected in the February 2018 Opinion.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Ortiz\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"9\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2018%20WL%201033237\">\n    2018 WL 1033237\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *2-3.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   In their current motion, the defendants reframe their mootness argument as a standing argument.

The defendants are incorrect. Although Ortiz has died, it is plausible that her estate will need to obtain copies of her medical records in connection with the administration of her estate. Section 18 allows representatives of a decedent's estate to obtain medical records; persons with power of attorney to make such requests are \"qualified persons\" under the statute.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   N.Y. Pub. Health L. (\"PHL\") \u00a7 18(1)(g). Hector Ortiz brings this litigation in his capacity as temporary administrator of Ortiz's estate. As such, Ortiz's death does not impact Hector Ortiz's standing to seek injunctive relief.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   II. Private Right of Action\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   Defendants seek judgment on the pleadings on the grounds that \u00a7 18(2)(e) contains neither an express nor implied private right of action. The defendants are correct.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   Section 18 does not contain any express grant of a private right of action. Where a statute does not expressly provide for a private right of action, a plaintiff \"can seek civil relief in a plenary action based on a violation of the statute only if a legislative intent to create such a right is fairly implied in the statutory provisions and their legislative history.\"\n   <em>\n    Cruz v.

A qualified person shall not be denied access to patient information solely because of inability to pay.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   PHL \u00a7 18(2)(e) (emphasis added).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   At issue is whether, by prohibiting health care providers from charging more than $0.75 per page in connection with inspecting or copying medical records, the Legislature implied a private right of action. For the reasons described below, the text, structure, and legislative history of \u00a7 18(2)(e) do not permit a finding that New York's Legislature intended to create a private right of action.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   As a threshold matter, there is no dispute that the first factor weighs in favor of recognizing a private right of action for violations of \u00a7 18(2)(e). The price-per-page provision was added to \u00a7 18 in 1991, five years after the Legislature first afforded consumers an opportunity to inspect and obtain copies of their medical records. 1991 N.Y. Sess. L., ch. 165, \u00a7 49. The provision capped the charges health care providers\n   may impose on qualified persons for medical records. Ortiz is among those qualified persons for whose particular benefit \u00a7 18(2)(e) was enacted.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Cruz\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4289797\" index=\"41\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ny3d/22/61/#p70\">\n    22 N.Y.3d at 70\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4289797\" index=\"42\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ny3d/22/61/#p70\">\n    979 N.Y.S.2d 257\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4289797\" index=\"43\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ny3d/22/61/#p70\">\n    2 N.E.3d 221\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   It is less clear that the recognition of a private right of action would promote the legislative purpose in enacting the statute, which is the second factor. The one-sentence amendment that was made to \u00a7 18 was a miniscule part of a massive overhaul to the Public Health Law that principally revised New York's Medicaid program.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   1991 N.Y.

When the bill was submitted to then Governor Mario Cuomo for approval, a Memorandum from the Senate and various submissions were included in the Bill Jacket for the Governor's review.\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   Broadly speaking, the Senate Memorandum explains that the purpose of the Act is \"to restrain the rapid growth in costs of the Medicaid system\" through \"structural changes in the way Medicaid services are provided.\" Senate Memorandum, Bill Jacket, L. 1991, ch. 165, at 19.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   Two submissions included in the Bill Jacket -- one from the New York State Office for the Aging and one from the New York Public Interest Research Group -- addressed the price-per-page provision in \u00a7 18 specifically. Both submissions supported the amendment as a means of curbing fees associated with access to medical records. The submission by the Office for the Aging stated, in part:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-40\">\n   These Sections impose a ceiling on the amount that may reasonably be charged for paper copies of medical records requested by patients and other \"qualified persons.\" The New York State Office for the Aging supports this measure and recommends careful monitoring to help ensure that the ceiling of seventy-five cents per page not become a standard charge. The reasonable cost of providing many medical records is less than seventy-five cents per page.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   Letter from the Office for the Aging, Bill Jacket, L. 1991, ch. 165, at 50. By enacting the price-per-page provision, the Legislature clearly intended to control patient costs associated with access to medical records. Because the threat of an additional enforcement mechanism -- civil lawsuits against health care providers -- would likely add to the growth in medical costs, it is debatable whether recognition of a private right of action would promote the legislative purpose, whether considered from the perspective of either \u00a7 18 alone or in the context of the 1991 revisions to the Public Health Law in their entirety.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   The third factor is whether recognition of a private right of action \"would be consistent with the legislative scheme.\"\n   <em>\n    Cruz\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4289797\" index=\"44\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ny3d/22/61/#p70\">\n    22 N.Y.3d at 70\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4289797\" index=\"45\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ny3d/22/61/#p70\">\n    979 N.Y.S.2d 257\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4289797\" index=\"46\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ny3d/22/61/#p70\">\n    2 N.E.3d 221\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (citation omitted).

First, under \u00a7 12, the Legislature has authorized the Commissioner of Health to impose substantial fines for violations of any provision of the Public Health Law \"for which a civil penalty is not otherwise expressly prescribed by law.\" PHL \u00a7 12(1)(a)-(b). Because \u00a7 18(2)(e) does not prescribe a civil penalty, a violation of its terms may be subject to enforcement through \u00a7 12. Second, under \u00a7 13, the Legislature has allowed New York citizens to enforce any provision of the Public Health Law through an action under Article 78. The parties agree that an action under Article 78 would have allowed Ortiz to obtain a judgment compelling NYPH to provide her with copies of her medical records in compliance with \u00a7 18(2)(e) -- that is, at a reasonable charge not more than $0.75 per page.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    In re Barbara Halio v.

Although enactment of these two provisions are nearly contemporaneous, only \u00a7 19 requires a refund of charges that exceed the statutory limit. \"A due respect for the competence of the Legislature requires us to conclude that the [different] remedial choices it made were considered choices.\"\n   <em>\n    People ex rel. Spitzer v. Grasso\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3554642\" index=\"87\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ad3d/42/126/\">\n    42 A.D.3d 126\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3554642\" index=\"88\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ad3d/42/126/\">\n    836 N.Y.S.2d 40\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 49 (1st Dep't 2007). Without \"strong indicia of a contrary congressional intent,\" it would be inappropriate to disturb this legislative judgment.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3554642\" index=\"89\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ad3d/42/126/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   (declining to recognize a private right of action where statute authorized enforcement by the Attorney General).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-58\">\n   Plaintiff next argues that a private right of action is appropriate because \"no special agency expertise is required to determine whether Defendants charged more than the statutory maximum.\" A court's competence to perform calculations is not a sufficient basis for concluding that a private right of action is consistent with the legislative scheme. In any event, plaintiff is wrong to assume that actions brought under \u00a7 18(2)(e) would be resolved by simple\n   calculation. Section 18(2)(e) principally requires health care providers to impose \"a reasonable charge ... not exceeding the costs incurred by such provider.\" PHL \u00a7 18(2)(e). Calculating damages in those cases could require resource-intensive litigation. As the court in\n   <em>\n    Casillo\n   </em>\n   explained in 1992, \"[t]he 1991 amendments capping copying costs within the definition of 'reasonable charge' was not intended to create a plethora of litigation where the courts would be forced to determine what is an allowable fee in this case or that case.\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"90\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=580%20N.Y.S.2d%20992\">\n    580 N.Y.S.2d at 998\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-59\">\n   Finally, plaintiff emphasizes that, in several other cases, courts appear to have assumed that \u00a7 18(2)(e) accords qualified persons a private right of action for damages.

HealthPort Techs., LLC\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12523489\" index=\"91\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/291/484/\">\n    291 F.

But none of the cases to which plaintiff cites have decided the issue on the merits. The instant case appears to be the first case to squarely present the issue for judicial resolution.
