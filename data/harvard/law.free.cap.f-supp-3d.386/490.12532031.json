For the following reasons, the Court will grant Warren leave to proceed\n   <em>\n    in forma pauperis\n   </em>\n   and dismiss his Complaint for lack of subject matter jurisdiction.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   <strong>\n    I. FACTS\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   Warren brings due process claims against the Defendant Judges based on their allegedly improper dismissal of two appeals he filed. Warren alleges that he filed an appeal in a\n   <em>\n    quo warranto\n   </em>\n   action, which was forwarded to the Pennsylvania Superior Court. In a per curiam order, the court directed Warren to show cause as to why his appeal should not be dismissed on the basis that an \"appeal taken from an action in quo warranto may be within the exclusive jurisdiction of the Pennsylvania Supreme Court.\" (Compl. at 3, \u00b6 14.) Warren responded with a motion to transfer his appeal. Two days later, the court directed the prothonotary to issue a briefing schedule. Warren filed a motion to stay that order on the basis that he believed his appeal should be transferred due to a lack of jurisdiction.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   The court thereafter issued an order discharging the rule to show cause order, indicating that the appeal would proceed at that time, and directing that the parties should be prepared to address the jurisdictional issue as the issue may be revisited by the panel of judges assigned to the case. (Compl. at Ex. 4.) Rather than file a brief as directed, Warren filed a writ of prohibition with the Pennsylvania Supreme Court to prohibit the Pennsylvania Superior Court from acting on his appeal. While the writ of prohibition was pending, the Pennsylvania Superior Court issued a per curiam order dismissing Warren's appeal due to his failure to file a brief. Warren moved to strike that judgment, but his motion was denied. Warren alleges that essentially the same course of events happened in connection with a second appeal he filed in a separate\n   <em>\n    quo warranto\n   </em>\n   action.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   Based on those allegations, Warren claims that the judges of the Pennsylvania Superior Court violated his due process rights by acting without jurisdiction to deprive him of his appeals in both cases. Warren asks this Court for an injunction \"[i]mmediately void[ing] their judgments\" in his appeals, and for monetary damages. (Compl. at 7.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   <strong>\n    II. STANDARD OF REVIEW\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   Warren is granted leave to proceed\n   <em>\n    in forma pauperis\n   </em>\n   because it appears that he is not capable of paying the fees to commence this civil action.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   As Warren is proceeding\n   <em>\n    in forma pauperis\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201915\">\n    28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (e)(2)(B) applies. That provision requires the Court to dismiss the Complaint if it is frivolous or fails to state a claim. A complaint is frivolous if it \"lacks an arguable\n   basis either in law or in fact,\"\n   <em>\n    Neitzke v. Williams,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"605680\" index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/490/319/#p325\">\n    490 U.S. 319\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 325,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"605680\" index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/490/319/#p325\">\n    109 S.Ct. 1827\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"605680\" index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/490/319/#p325\">\n    104 L.Ed.2d 338\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1989), and is legally baseless if \"based on an indisputably meritless legal theory.\"\n   <em>\n    Deutsch v. United States,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7416082\" index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/67/1080/#p1085\">\n    67 F.3d 1080\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 1085 (3d Cir. 1995). Additionally, to survive dismissal, the Complaint must contain \"sufficient factual matter, accepted as true, to state a claim to relief that is plausible on its face.\"\n   <em>\n    Ashcroft v. Iqbal,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3653744\" index=\"6\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/556/662/#p678\">\n    556 U.S. 662\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 678,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3653744\" index=\"7\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/556/662/#p678\">\n    129 S.Ct. 1937\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3653744\" index=\"8\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/556/662/#p678\">\n    173 L.Ed.2d 868\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2009) (quotations omitted). \"[M]ere conclusory statements[ ] do not suffice.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3653744\" index=\"9\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/556/662/#p678\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   Furthermore, \"[i]f the court determines at any time that it lacks' subject-matter jurisdiction, the court must dismiss the action.\" Fed. R. Civ. P. 12(h)(3). As Warren is proceeding\n   <em>\n    pro se,\n   </em>\n   the Court construes his allegations liberally.\n   <em>\n    Higgs v. Att'y Gen.,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3828353\" index=\"10\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/655/333/#p339\">\n    655 F.3d 333\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 339 (3d Cir. 2011).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   <strong>\n    III. DISCUSSION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   The Court lacks jurisdiction over Warren's case. Pursuant to the\n   <em>\n    Rooker-Feldman\n   </em>\n   doctrine, \"federal district courts lack jurisdiction over suits that are essentially appeals from state-court judgments.\"\n   <em>\n    Great W. Mining &amp; Mineral Co. v. Fox Rothschild LLP,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3709928\" index=\"11\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/615/159/#p165\">\n    615 F.3d 159\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 165 (3d Cir. 2010). Based on that principle, the\n   <em>\n    Rooker-Feldman\n   </em>\n   doctrine deprives a federal district court of jurisdiction over \"cases brought by state-court losers complaining of injuries caused by state-court judgments rendered before the district court proceedings commenced and inviting district court review and rejection of those judgments.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3709928\" index=\"12\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/615/159/#p165\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3709928\" index=\"12\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/615/159/#p165\">\n    at 166\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (quotations omitted). \"[T]here are four requirements that must be met for the\n   <em>\n    Rooker-Feldman\n   </em>\n   doctrine to apply: (1) the federal plaintiff lost in state court; (2) the plaintiff complains of injuries caused by the state-court judgments; (3) those judgments were rendered before the federal suit was filed; and (4) the plaintiff is inviting the district court to review and reject the state judgments.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3709928\" index=\"13\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/615/159/#p165\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   Here, all four requirements for applying\n   <em>\n    Rooker-Feldman\n   </em>\n   are satisfied. Warren lost in state court prior to filing the instant case and his due process claims are predicated on injuries caused by the state court judgments. He is clearly inviting review and rejection of the Pennsylvania Superior Court's judgments in his cases by asking this Court to conclude that the state court acted improperly in issuing those judgments and by asking this Court to vacate those judgments. At bottom, Warren's case is essentially an appeal from unfavorable judgments issued by a state court seeking review and rejection of those judgments on the grounds that they were issued without jurisdiction and/or in violation of Warren's rights. Accordingly, this Court cannot exercise jurisdiction over his claims.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    King v. Burr\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"14\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=728%20F.%20App%27x%2083\">\n    728 F. App'x 83\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 85 (3d Cir. 2018) (affirming dismissal pursuant to\n   <em>\n    Rooker Feldman\n   </em>\n   doctrine where \"the sources of the plaintiff's injury are orders and judgments of the Pennsylvania state courts\" (internal quotations and alteration omitted)).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   <strong>\n    IV. CONCLUSION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   For the following reasons, the Court will grant Warren leave to proceed\n   <em>\n    in forma pauperis\n   </em>\n   and dismiss his Complaint for lack of subject matter jurisdiction. Warren will not be given leave to file an amended complaint because he cannot cure the defects in his claims. An appropriate Order follows.\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-22\">\n    However, as Warren is a prisoner, he will be obligated to pay the filing fee in installments in accordance with\n    <extracted-citation index=\"15\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201915\">\n     28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915\n    </extracted-citation>\n    (b).\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n </opinion>\n</casebody>\n"
