The Court has conducted a de novo review of the motion to suppress, pursuant to\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20636\">\n    28 U.S.C. \u00a7 636\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (b)(1). The Court concurs in the Magistrate Judge's factual findings, analysis, and conclusions of law.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   filing 68.

Filing 512 at 21. In the context of the First\n   Amendment, a statute may also be challenged as facially overbroad. The facial overbreadth doctrine \"provides an avenue whereby a law may be invalidated as overbroad if a substantial number of its applications are unconstitutional, judged in relation to the statute's plainly legitimate sweep.\"\n   <em>\n    Josephine Havlak Photographer, Inc. v.

Good is not facing charges under \u00a7 1324(a)(1)(A)(ii) and (iv). The court cannot dismiss an indictment alleging violations of \u00a7 1324(a)(1)(A)(iii) because other statutory subsections of \u00a7 1324 that are not charged may be unconstitutional. As to \u00a7 1324(a)(1)(A)(iii) and (v)(I), Defendant cannot show that these subsections pose a realistic danger of significantly compromising recognized First Amendment protections of parties not before the Court.\n   <em>\n    Regan\n   </em>\n   , 468 U.S. at 704 n. 8,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11339762\" index=\"40\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/468/641/\">\n    104 S.Ct. 3262\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

Subsection (iii) reads:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-162\">\n   Any person who ... knowing or in reckless disregard of the fact that an alien has come to, entered, or remains in the United States in violation of law, conceals, harbors, or shields from detection, or attempts to conceal, harbor, or shield from detection, such alien in any place, including any building or any means of transportation ... shall be punished as provided in subparagraph (B).\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-163\">\n   <extracted-citation index=\"166\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=8%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201324\">\n    8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1324\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a)(1)(A)(iii). Good offers no argument on how subsection (iii)'s \"conceals\" or \"shields from detection\" language poses any realistic threat under the overbreadth analysis. Rather, Defendant's sole argument is that the statute \"places no limit on 'harboring,\" and this opinion will address only that argument.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-164\">\n   Contrary to Good's claim, the Eighth Circuit has explicitly defined \"harboring\" within the meaning of subsection (iii) as \"any conduct that 'substantially facilitate[s] an alien's remaining in the United States illegally.' \"\n   <em>\n    U.S. v.

So, to violate the harboring component of subsection (iii), a defendant must knowingly or in reckless disregard of the fact that an alien has come to, entered, or remains in the U.S. in violation of the law, engage in any conduct that substantially facilitates an alien's, or group of aliens' ability to remain in the U.S. illegally.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-165\">\n   Any speech included within the sweep of subsection (iii) is incidental to defendant's criminal conduct. As explained above, any incidental burden on speech arising from the enforcement of \u00a7 1324(a)(1)(A)(iii) furthers the government's interest in uniformly administering and enforcing border security laws, a fundamental responsibility of the federal government that is for a purpose wholly unrelated to suppressing free expression. Any burden on speech arising from \u00a7 1324(a)(1)(A)(iii) does not exceed what is necessary to further the purpose of immigration legislation. Defendant has therefore failed to demonstrate that the harboring subsection of \u00a7 1324 imposes a burden on speech that violates the First Amendment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-166\">\n   <em>\n    2.

Defendant contends that \"Count II does not do so against Mr. Good\" and \"should be dismissed on this basis.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   )\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-178\">\n   Count II charges that Good and others \"did knowingly and willfully conspire\" ... \"to commit laundering of monetary instruments by conducting and attempting to conduct financial transactions ... involv[ing] the proceeds of ... harboring certain aliens, and at the time of the financial transactions and attempted financial transactions, the defendants knew the transaction was designed in whole or in part to conceal or disguise the nature, location, source, ownership, or control of the proceeds of harboring aliens and to avoid transaction reporting requirements and to promote the harboring of aliens.\" (Filing No. 284, at CM/ECF p. 10). Specifically as to Good, the superseding indictment charges that Benitez and Delgado, \"in part through their company Castro Properties, LLC, would conceal and disguise the true ownership of commercial and real estate assets in the names of others to include ...

(Filing No. 284, at CM/ECF p. 12).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-179\">\n   The court finds that the allegations against Good sufficiently charge affirmative conduct against Defendant. The superseding indictment puts Good on notice that he is charged with willfully conspiring and agreeing to commit the laundering of monetary instruments by acting to \"conceal and disguise the true ownership of commercial and real estate assets\" in Good's name. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-180\">\n   Further, the court finds that Count II sufficiently states the relevant elements of a money laundering conspiracy: \"(1) that the defendant conducted a\n   financial transaction which involved the proceeds of an unlawful activity; (2) that he knew that the property involved in the transaction was proceeds of some form of specified unlawful activity; and (3) that he intended to promote the specified unlawful activity.\"\n   <em>\n    U.S. v.

An illegal alien cannot \"harbor, conceal, or shield himself from detection.\" It logically follows that, under the statute at issue, a person cannot be guilty of aiding and abetting the conduct of the illegal alien(s) either. This is the Government's theory and it must fail.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-184\">\n   (Filing No. 338, at CM/ECF p. 44-45) (internal quotation and citations omitted).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-185\">\n   Contrary to Good's argument, the language of the superseding indictment states that Good conspired with third persons, charging that Defendant:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-186\">\n   did knowingly and willfully conspire and agree\n   <em>\n    together and with each other, and with other persons known and unknown to the grand jury\n   </em>\n   , to commit harboring and concealment of aliens ....\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-187\">\n   (Filing No. 284, at CM/ECF p. 2) (emphasis added). The government's evidence may show that Good conspired with aliens, but the conspiracy charge alleges he conspired with others as well to conceal the aliens from government detection. Count I alleges the essential elements of the crime defined under \u00a7 1324(a)(1)(A)(v)(I).
