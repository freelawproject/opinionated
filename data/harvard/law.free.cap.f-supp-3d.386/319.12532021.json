Gardephe, United States District Judge\n   Plaintiffs in these actions are the Martin Hilti Family Trust (the \"Trust\") and Frances Hamilton White. These actions arise from Plaintiffs' purchase of forged paintings from the Knoedler Gallery, an art gallery in Manhattan. The Defendants that are the subject of this opinion are Knoedler Gallery, LLC (\"Knoedler LLC\"), the owner of the gallery; 8-31 Holdings, Inc. (\"8-31\"), Knoedler LLC's sole member; and Michael Hammer, 8-31's sole shareholder (collectively, \"Defendants\"). The operative complaints assert claims under the Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act (\"RICO\"), and state law causes of action for fraud, fraudulent concealment, aiding and abetting fraud, conspiracy to commit fraud, and conspiracy to commit fraudulent concealment.

For example, Knoedler LLC argues that it cannot be held liable for White's injuries, because White purchased her painting in 2000 - a year before Knoedler LLC was formed. (Def. Knoedler LLC (\n    <em>\n     Hilti\n    </em>\n    Dkt. No. 217) at 13) White argues, however, that Knoedler LLC is responsible for her injuries under a successor liability theory. (Pltf. White Br. (\n    <em>\n     White\n    </em>\n    Dkt. No. 172) at 18, 23) Moreover, Plaintiffs argue that - under an\n    <em>\n     alter\n    </em>\n    <em>\n     ego\n    </em>\n    theory of liability - Hammer can be held responsible for 8-31's actions, and 8-31 can be held liable for Knoedler LLC's actions. (Pltf. Jt. Br. (\n    <em>\n     Hilti\n    </em>\n    Dkt.

Here, analysis of the parties' arguments must begin with a discussion of the corporate structure of and dealings between Knoedler LLC and 8-31, and Hammer's relationship with these entities. Accordingly, the Court considers below the formation of Knoedler LLC and 8-31; the relationship between Knoedler LLC and 8-31; and Hammer's relationship with these entities.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-54\">\n    <strong>\n     1.\n     <em>\n      Pre-2001 Corporate Structure: Knoedler-Modarco and 8-31\n     </em>\n    </strong>\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-55\">\n    Prior to 2001, the Gallery was operated by the M.

Freedman's testimony that \"Hammer was interested to know what[ ]transacted\" (\n    <em>\n     id\n    </em>\n    . at 137), was \"aware of sales in general,\" and \"oftentimes [saw] paperwork regarding sales\" ( [\n    <em>\n     id\n    </em>\n    .] at 137, 334) does not demonstrate that Hammer was aware of the outlandish profits Knoedler made on the sale of Rosales Paintings. Similarly, Freedman's testimony that Hammer spoke with Knoedler's chief financial officer about financial matters at the gallery (\n    <em>\n     id.\n    </em>\n    at 136-37) does not demonstrate that Hammer was informed of the profit margins associated with sales of Rosales Paintings.\n   </blockquote>\n   <blockquote id=\"p-121\">\n    Hammer denies any knowledge of Knoedler's profit margin on Rosales Paintings. (Hammer Dep. (\n    <em>\n     De Sole\n    </em>\n    Dkt. No. 236), Ex. 21 at 131-34, 214, 218) Hammer testified that the financial information he received about Knoedler was never broken down into individual sales, but instead \"would be one number for sales, one number for cost of sales, gross profit and then all of these expenses. It was just a summary.... [W]e never had serious detailed information.\" ( [\n    <em>\n     id\n    </em>\n    .] at 133-34) In sum, there is no evidence that Hammer was aware of Knoedler's profit margins on the sale of any particular Rosales Painting, or on any collection of Rosales Paintings. Accordingly, Hammer's knowledge of the underlying fraud scheme cannot be premised on an awareness that Knoedler was making outlandish profits on the sale of Rosales Paintings.\n   </blockquote>\n   <blockquote id=\"p-122\">\n    As to Hammer's knowledge concerning the source and provenance of the Rosales Paintings, Freedman testified that Hammer knew that Rosales was the source of the works, that the works were \"newly discovered,\" that Knoedler was researching the provenance of the works, and that Knoedler did not know the identity of the owner. (Freedman Dep. (\n    <em>\n     De Sole\n    </em>\n    Dkt. No. 236), Ex. 18 at 334-39) There is no evidence, however, that Hammer was aware of (1) Rosales' shifting provenance stories; (2) Rosales' inconsistent accounts of the size and scope of Mr. X's collection; (3) Rosales' unwillingness to sign forms confirming\n    the authenticity of the Rosales Paintings; or (4) the issues raised concerning the Diebenkorns Rosales brought to Knoedler early on. There is likewise no evidence that Hammer ever met Rosales or ever discussed the Rosales Paintings with her. Finally, to the extent that Freedman was making misrepresentations to Knoedler customers about the provenance of the Rosales Paintings, there is no evidence that Hammer knew that she was making those misrepresentations. There is likewise no evidence that Freedman ever told Hammer that there was reason to question the authenticity or provenance of the Rosales Paintings. Freedman's conclusory testimony that she \"would have told Michael Hammer what [she] knew [about how the Mexican collector came to own the Rosales Paintings]\" ( [\n    <em>\n     id\n    </em>\n    .] at 338-39) is not sufficient to create a material issue of fact as to whether Hammer understood that the paintings were forgeries.\n   </blockquote>\n   <blockquote id=\"p-123\">\n    Hammer testified that he never discussed with Freedman or any other Knoedler employee a connection between David Herbert and Mr. X, and that he doesn't know who David Herbert is. (Hammer Dep. (\n    <em>\n     De Sole\n    </em>\n    Dkt.

(\n    <em>\n     De Sole\n    </em>\n    Dkt. No. 236), Ex. 18 at 339), this testimony does not demonstrate that Hammer understood that the Rosales Paintings were not authentic.\n   </blockquote>\n   <blockquote id=\"p-124\">\n    Hammer did review \"very carefully\" the IFAR Report concerning the \"Green Pollock\" purchased by Jack Levy. (Hammer Dep. (\n    <em>\n     De Sole\n    </em>\n    Dkt. No. 236), Ex. 21 at 170-71) As discussed above, the IFAR report rejects Knoedler and Rosales' claim that Ossorio had been involved in the acquisition of the Green Pollock, and notes that there are \"disturbing differences\" between the materials used to create the Green Pollock and the materials used to create a known Pollock from the same year. (IFAR Report (\n    <em>\n     De Sole\n    </em>\n    Dkt. No. 236), Ex. 140 at 8, 14) The report also states that \"IFAR's own extensive archival and other research has turned up no documentary material of any kind linking the painting to Pollock, or Ossorio.\" (\n    <em>\n     Id\n    </em>\n    . at 1) The conclusion of the IFAR report reads: \"given the several strongly negative opinions [from Pollock experts about the authenticity of the work] and the lack of information as to prior ownership, and with no documentation or other evidence to override the concerns of those who do not accept it as a work by Pollock, we cannot currently support its addition to the artist's\n    <em>\n     oeuvre\n    </em>\n    .\" (\n    <em>\n     Id\n    </em>\n    . at 10) Based on the IFAR Report, Levy returned the Green Pollock to Knoedler in late 2003, and the Gallery refunded his full purchase price of $ 2 million.

(\n    <em>\n     Id\n    </em>\n    . at 168, 186) Moreover, Freedman did not tell Hammer that Knoedler had sold other\n    paintings from the same source that had b[r]ought the Green Pollock to Knoedler. (\n    <em>\n     Id\n    </em>\n    . at 188) When Hammer asked Freedman if there was any problem with the Green Pollock, she told him \"absolutely not.\" (\n    <em>\n     Id\n    </em>\n    . at 188) Hammer nonetheless directed Freedman to share the IFAR Report with an individual who was preparing to invest in the Green Pollock. (\n    <em>\n     Id\n    </em>\n    . at 193-94) Hammer did not direct Freedman to share the IFAR Report with any customer preparing to purchase a Rosales Painting, however.\n   </blockquote>\n   <blockquote id=\"p-126\">\n    The IFAR Report - standing alone - is not sufficient to demonstrate that Hammer knew that all of the Rosales Paintings - including those purchased by Plaintiffs - were forgeries. Plaintiffs have not shown that Hammer should have realized that the IFAR Report cast doubt on the authenticity and provenance of all of the Rosales Paintings. Moreover, Plaintiffs have not cited evidence demonstrating that - over the more than ten years that Rosales Paintings were sold at Knoedler - any other issue concerning the authenticity of a Rosales Painting was brought to Hammer's attention.\n   </blockquote>\n   <blockquote id=\"p-127\">\n    Because a reasonable jury could not conclude that Hammer was aware of an ongoing fraud scheme at Knoedler, the actions of Hammer cited by Plaintiffs - such as regularly increasing Freedman's compensation - cannot be viewed as acts in furtherance of the racketeering enterprise. Moreover, the fact that Hammer received a share of Knoedler's profits does not demonstrate that he was a knowing participant in a fraud scheme at Knoedler\n   </blockquote>\n   <p id=\"p-128\">\n    <em>\n     De Sole\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4196115\" index=\"29\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/139/618/\">\n     139 F.

(Pltf. Jt. Br. (\n    <em>\n     Hilti\n    </em>\n    Dkt.

The evidentiary record here establishes no more than what this Court found insufficient in\n    <em>\n     De Sole\n    </em>\n    .\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-131\">\n    Plaintiffs also contend that Hammer \"knew of the profits generated by sales of\" the Rosales Paintings.

(Pltf. R. 56.1 Add. Stmt. (\n    <em>\n     Hilti\n    </em>\n    Dkt. No. 220) \u00b6\u00b6 1084, 1089, 1091) But there is no evidence that Hammer was ever shown data setting forth Knoedler's profits on a particular Rosales Painting, or on all sales of Rosales Paintings. For example, with respect to the memorandum discussing a 363% profit on a single painting, there is no evidence that Hammer was told that this painting was a Rosales Painting. (Def. R. 56.1 Cntrstmt.

While the evidence here shows that, at least by 2006, Hammer had access to information indicating that the Gallery was generating large profits, it does not show that he \"was aware of the outlandish profits Knoedler\n    made on each Rosales Painting.\"\n    <em>\n     De Sole\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4196115\" index=\"32\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/139/618/\">\n     139 F.

In\n    <em>\n     De Sole\n    </em>\n    , this Court discussed in detail Hammer's knowledge of the IFAR Report, and whether he knew that the painting that was the subject of the IFAR Report was part of a larger collection of paintings that had been sold by the Gallery.\n    <em>\n     De Sole\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4196115\" index=\"33\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/139/618/\">\n     139 F.

(Hammer Decl. (\n    <em>\n     Hilti\n    </em>\n    Dkt. No. 218-3) \u00b6 30) After the asset purchase agreements were executed, Knoedler-Modarco no longer operated any business. It was left with three assets - the Knoedler Gallery archives, 150 paintings, and two promissory notes, and the company was dissolved once the promissory notes were repaid. (Def. R. 56.1 Stmt.

No. 218) \u00b6\u00b6 896-97, 905, 907, 920-21, 924) There is no evidence that Knoedler-Modarco sold the archives or paintings before dissolving, or that it otherwise engaged in any business activity after its transactions with the three newly created LLCs. In sum, there is substantial evidence that Knoedler-Modarco was left in a sufficiently altered state such that the \"existence of only one corporation\" factor is satisfied.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-188\">\n    Moreover, Knoedler-Modarco no longer existed when this litigation was commenced.

(Pltf. R. 56.1 Add. Stmt. (\n    <em>\n     Hilti\n    </em>\n    Dkt. No. 220) \u00b6\u00b6 1452-57) Indeed, Freedman testified that nothing changed in the Gallery's operations as a result of this transaction. (Freedman Dep. (\n    <em>\n     Hilti\n    </em>\n    Dkt. No. 219-4) at 690:9-691:14) Before and after the transaction, the Knoedler Gallery held itself out as a gallery that was founded in 1846, and continued to operate under the trade name \"Knoedler &amp; Company.\" (Pltf. R. 56.1 Add. Stmt. (\n    <em>\n     Hilti\n    </em>\n    Dkt. No. 220) \u00b6\u00b6 1397-98, 1458) It is likewise undisputed that the board of directors of Knoedler-Modarco was nearly identical to the board of directors of 8-31 - the only difference is that Dru Hammer was not a member of 8-31's board at the time of the Knoedler-Modarco asset sale in 2001; she joined 8-31's board in 2003.\n    <footnotemark>\n     31\n    </footnotemark>\n    (\n    <em>\n     Id.\n    </em>\n    \u00b6\u00b6 1407-09) Finally, it is undisputed that\n    Hammer owned 24.9% of Knoedler-Modarco, and that he is the sole shareholder of 8-31.\n    <footnotemark>\n     32\n    </footnotemark>\n    (Def.

Here, Sansone - the chief financial officer of Knoedler-Modarco, Knoedler LLC, and 8-31 - referred to this transaction as a \"reorganization.\" (Pltf. R. 56.1 Add. Stmt. (\n    <em>\n     Hilti\n    </em>\n    Dkt. No. 220) \u00b6\u00b6 1412-13; Sansone Dep. (\n    <em>\n     Hilti\n    </em>\n    Dkt. No. 219-33) at 418:23) Moreover, all parties to the Knoedler-Modarco transaction were represented by the same law firm, and no deponent could recall discussing the transaction at a board meeting. Indeed, the executives who signed the Knoedler-Modarco/Knoedler LLC asset purchase agreement - Sansone for Knoedler-Modarco, and Freedman for Knoedler LLC - do not recall reading the asset purchase agreement; negotiating the agreement; or discussing the agreement with anyone before signing it.

In 2001, for example, Knoedler LLC and 8-31 entered into a Management Agreement to govern the services 8-31 would provide to Knoedler LLC. This agreement includes payroll and accounting services. (Def. R. 56.1 Stmt. (\n    <em>\n     Hilti\n    </em>\n    Dkt. No. 218) \u00b6 498; Pltf. R. 56.1 Add. Stmt. (\n    <em>\n     Hilti\n    </em>\n    Dkt.

R. 56.1 Stmt. (\n    <em>\n     Hilti\n    </em>\n    Dkt.

No. 220) \u00b6 1138) Instead, Knoedler LLC simply and regularly transferred money to 8-31 whenever 8-31 needed money and Knoedler LLC had cash on hand. (Def. R. 56.1 Stmt.

It is undisputed that, in 2010, Knoedler's interdivisional receivables due from 8-31 - worth more than $ 13 million - were reclassified as \"distributions\" to 8-31. (Pltf. R. 56.1 Add. Stmt. (\n    <em>\n     Hilti\n    </em>\n    Dkt. No. 220) \u00b6\u00b6 1142, 1144; Def. R. 56.1 Stmt. (\n    <em>\n     Hilti\n    </em>\n    Dkt. No. 218) \u00b6 578) On its face, this reclassification is evidence that 8-31 eliminated a significant asset of Knoedler LLC and liability of 8-31.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-218\">\n    Defendants argue, however, that for nearly a decade the fund transfers from Knoedler LLC to 8-31 were incorrectly classified as \"interdivisional receivables\" on these entities' general ledgers and financial statements. (Def. 8-31 Br. (\n    <em>\n     Hilti\n    </em>\n    Dkt. No. 215) at 28) John Salomon, Defendants' accounting expert, testified that where \"a holding company receiv[es a] transfer [that it] does not have the ability to repay[, ]and no expectation can exist that it should or would be able to make repayment, the transfer from the subsidiary should not be classified as a receivable on the subsidiary's general ledger and financial statement.\" (Def. R. 56.1 Stmt. (\n    <em>\n     Hilti\n    </em>\n    Dkt. No. 218) \u00b6 541)\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-219\">\n    Moreover, Sansone and Blankschen - who each served as vice president, secretary, treasurer, and chief financial officer for both 8-31 and Knoedler LLC - testified that they understood that 8-31 would not be able to repay these funds to Knoedler. (Def. 8-31 Br. (\n    <em>\n     Hilti\n    </em>\n    Dkt. No. 215) at 28; Def. R. 56.1 Stmt. (\n    <em>\n     Hilti\n    </em>\n    Dkt. No. 218) \u00b6\u00b6 937-38) According to Defendants, \"[e]ven if this Court were to conclude that the interdivisional receivables were not actually distributions, the value of the interdivisional receivables was zero,\" because 8-31 was not able to repay Knoedler. (Def. 8-31 Br. (\n    <em>\n     Hilti\n    </em>\n    Dkt. No. 215) at 32-33) 8-31 contends that the reclassification was thus proper, and did not constitute siphoning. (\n    <em>\n     Id.\n    </em>\n    at 35-41)\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-220\">\n    The Court concludes that the parties' dispute about the propriety of the 2010 reclassification presents a jury issue. As an initial matter, there is ample evidence that the classification of interdivisional receivables was not a mere oversight. Knoedler LLC and 8-31 used the receivable/payable language consistently from 2001 through 2010, and under the leadership of two different chief financial officers. (Pltf. R. 56.1 Add. Stmt. (\n    <em>\n     Hilti\n    </em>\n    Dkt. No. 220) \u00b6\u00b6 1125, 1131) Indeed, it was not until Knoedler\n    LLC came under criminal investigation that 8-31 decided that the decade-long accounting treatment of these transactions was a mistake. (\n    <em>\n     Id.\n    </em>\n    \u00b6 1144) Moreover, in 2008 an outside auditor asked Blankschen to explain 8-31's interdivisional accounts in connection with an audit of 8-31's 2005 taxes. (Interdivisional Accounts E-mail (\n    <em>\n     Hilti\n    </em>\n    Dkt. No. 219-53) at 6) Blankschen provided the auditor with a detailed explanation of how 8-31 records its interdivisional receivables and payables, referring to these accounts as assets and liabilities. (\n    <em>\n     Id.\n    </em>\n    ) Finally, the financial accounting policies attached to Knoedler LLC and 8-31's consolidated financial statements plainly state that \"[a]ccounts receivable are stated at the amounts management expects to collect.\" (\n    <em>\n     E.g.\n    </em>\n    , 8-31 &amp; LLCs' Consolidated Financial Statements (\n    <em>\n     Hilti\n    </em>\n    Dkt. No. 218-130) at 6)\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-221\">\n    While 8-31's arguments may raise an issue of fact regarding the nature of the accounting reclassification, a reasonable jury could conclude that 8-31 siphoned off more than $ 13 million from Knoedler LLC in 2010.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-222\">\n    <strong>\n     2.\n     <em>\n      Fundamental Unfairness\n     </em>\n    </strong>\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-223\">\n    As this Court concluded in\n    <em>\n     De Sole\n    </em>\n    :\n   </p>\n   <blockquote id=\"p-224\">\n    A reasonable jury could also find an \"overall element of injustice or unfairness,\"\n    <em>\n     NetJets Aviation, Inc.\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4129333\" index=\"160\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/537/168/#p176\">\n     537 F.3d at 177\n    </extracted-citation>\n    , if a corporate distinction between 8-31 and Knoedler [LLC] were recognized. As discussed above, Plaintiffs have proffered sufficient evidence for a reasonable jury to conclude that 8-31 siphoned [more than $ 13] million from Knoedler [LLC].

This sequence of events gives rise to an inference that the purpose of transferring [more than $ 13] million from Knoedler [LLC] to 8-31 was to shield those assets from the reach of law enforcement or Knoedler [LLC's] creditors, and constitutes evidence of \"injustice or unfairness that is a result of an abuse of the corporate form.\"\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    <em>\n     Nat'l Gear &amp; Piston, Inc.\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4233397\" index=\"161\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-2d/975/392/#p406\">\n     975 F.

(\n    <em>\n     Hilti\n    </em>\n    Dkt. No. 220) \u00b6 1313). He did not keep records of his business use of these vehicles. (Pltf. R. 56.1 Cntrstmt. (\n    <em>\n     Hilti\n    </em>\n    Dkt.
