Although the quarry is located in an area zoned for mineral extraction and primarily regulated by the Pennsylvania Department of Environmental Protection, local officials sought to impose additional conditions on its operations in response to residents' concerns and hesitated to issue an operating permit. Then, fearing that the quarry owner and operator were about to install an asphalt plant on site, the Township sought to enjoin them from doing so in state court. The owner of the quarry along with the operator of the site removed the enforcement action to this court, seeking injunctive relief to permit their operations, which I granted in part.\n   <em>\n    East Rockhill Twp. v.

One is a civil rights claim asserting a denial of substantive due process. The second is a state law claim alleging tortious interference with the quarry operator's contract to supply stone for a state highway project. The Township and its officials moved to dismiss these counterclaims. Because I am persuaded that no reasonable jury could find Defendants' actions shocking to the conscience, and because the actions Defendants took affecting the contract were privileged, I will grant the motions to dismiss.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   <strong>\n    I. Factual Background\n   </strong>\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   In November 2017, Pierson Construction was awarded a contract by the Pennsylvania Turnpike Commission to widen and improve part of the Pennsylvania Turnpike (\"the Turnpike Project\"). To complete the Turnpike Project, an affiliated entity of Pierson Construction, Pierson Materials, leased the Rockhill Quarry in East Rockhill Township. When Pierson Materials notified the Township of its plans to use the quarry to obtain material and produce asphalt, the underlying dispute ensued. Counterclaim Plaintiffs here include Richard E. Pierson Materials Corp. and Richard E. Pierson Construction Co., Inc. (collectively \"Pierson\") as well as Hanson Aggregates Pennsylvania, LLC (\"Hanson\"), which owns the property that contains the Rockhill Quarry. Counterclaim Defendants include the Township, East Rockhill Township Board of Supervisors (\"the Board\"), Township Manager and Zoning Officer Marianne Morano, and Board members Gary Volovnik, David Nyman, and Jim Nietupski.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   The quarry in question has been in existence and operated at some level since 1890. Asphalt production has periodically occurred at the site, but the equipment for such production was removed in the early 1980s when quarrying operations were reduced substantially. In the eyes of its neighbors, the quarry had long been inactive,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Defs.' Counterclaim Ex. G; Defs.' Counterclaim Ex. K, and the demographics of the area around the quarry had changed in that time.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Defs.' Counterclaim Ex. G. But Hanson continuously maintained Department of Environmental Protection (DEP) permits for the quarry, so as to remain in \"active operation\" for purposes of the controlling state statute, 52 P.S. \u00a7 3303.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   It also obtained annual zoning permits from the Township.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   In November 2017, Pierson informed the Township of its plans to lease the quarry for the Turnpike Project and its specific plans to produce asphalt. According to the Counterclaim, Pierson sought to \"bring in portable quarrying equipment to be located on existing impervious areas of the site,\" \"bring in portable asphalt making equipment to be located on existing impervious areas of the site and placed in the same areas (using existing foundations and footings) as prior asphalt making equipment,\" and \"place temporary trailers on the existing foundations of prior buildings.\" Defs.' Counterclaim \u00b6 55. Pierson provided a tour of the quarry to Zoning Officer Morano in December 2017, and on December 11 and December 21, 2017, Pierson submitted two letters to the Township regarding the proposed operations.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Defs.' Counterclaim Ex. E; Defs.' Counterclaim Ex. F. Pierson then began preparations for asphalt production, ordering equipment and materials, preparing the site, and hiring personnel.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   On December 26, 2017, numerous local residents attended a meeting of the Township Board of Supervisors and expressed opposition to the proposed increase in quarrying operations. On December 28, 2017, Morano emailed DEP, copying various other officials. She described the concerns of local residents and asked DEP to delay issuing approvals until after the Township could meet with DEP about the changed circumstances since the quarry was last active. Defs.' Counterclaim Ex. G.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   Morano did not send that email to Hanson or Pierson.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   On December 29, 2017, Morano responded to Pierson's December 11 and 21 letters. In her response, she indicated that there appeared to be \"new and/or altered structures, equipment and/or uses proposed for the property\" and that a special exception would therefore be necessary before Pierson could proceed with the \"proposed use and/or improvements.\" Defs.' Counterclaim Ex. H. Pierson responded to Morano's December 29, 2017 letter on January 4, 2018. It argued that the proposed use of the quarry was consistent with how it has always been used and noted that the Township previously issued annual zoning permits without referring to any special exception requirement. Defs.' Counterclaim Ex. I.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   Prior to that response, on the same day that Morano responded to Pierson's letters-December 29, 2017-Hanson had submitted a letter to the Township along with a 2018 Zoning Permit Application, Existing Land Use Overlay Plans, and Site Plans. That same day, as a supplement to the 2018 Zoning Permit Application, Pierson had submitted a letter that confirmed compliance with the requirements in the Township's zoning ordinance for issuance of an H12 Extractive Operation Permit, a report regarding traffic routes, and the DEP General Plan Approval and General Operating Permit for certain temporary equipment to be used at the quarry.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   On January 12, 2018, Morano replied to Hanson and Pierson's application materials in a letter that stated the following findings: Pierson would need to obtain a special exception; Pierson was not compliant with various zoning requirements; Pierson could only obtain relief related to the asphalt plant from the Zoning Hearing Board; and land development approval would be necessary to transport the portable quarrying equipment or to place trailers on the existing foundations.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Defs.' Counterclaim Ex. J. Based on these findings, the Township denied Hanson and Pierson's 2018 Zoning Permit Application.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12530031\" index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/364/436/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   The Township also decreed that the proposed new use and related improvements necessary for asphalt production must cease until all approvals could be obtained.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12530031\" index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/364/436/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   On June 15, 2018, Morano, as Township Manager, further informed DEP that the Township objected to DEP issuing an air quality plan approval for Pierson to install and operate a stone crusher.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Defs.' Counterclaim Ex. K.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   Hearings before the Zoning Hearing Board proceeded over several sessions without resolution. The Township, concerned that Hanson and Pierson intended to proceed with the installation of an asphalt plant, sued in state court to enjoin its operation.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Defs.' Notice of Removal Ex. A. Significantly, the Township did not seek to enjoin the operation of the quarry; public hearings as to the terms under which it should operate continued. Following removal, Hanson and Pierson sought an injunction requiring the Township to allow operation of both the quarry and the asphalt plant. After a bench trial, I enjoined the Township from interfering with operation of the quarry under the Declaratory Judgment Act, finding that exclusive jurisdiction to regulate quarry operations rested with the DEP. I abstained from ruling as to the asphalt plant, finding state law at best unsettled, if not adverse to Hanson and Pierson.\n   <em>\n    East Rockhill Twp.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12530031\" index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/364/436/\">\n    364 F.

They further contend that local political pressure motivated the Township and its officials to attempt to regulate quarry operations despite knowing that such regulation is preempted under the Pennsylvania Mining Act. Specifically, they argue that the Township rejected the 2018 Zoning Permit Application only \"because Pierson seeks to increase the Quarry's operations.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 99.

Supp. 3d at 447\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . In context,\n   the Township officials' conduct cannot be deemed improper.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-55\">\n   As to the Township officials' motives-the second Restatement factor-Pierson affirmatively pleads that they acted in response to local residents' complaints. I cannot fault government officials for responding to constituent concerns. Pierson's allegations that the Township officials acted in violation of state law are insufficient to call into question whether they were motivated by genuine public concerns. My assessment of motive is related to my consideration of the fourth factor-interests advanced by the officials' conduct-and one aspect of the fifth factor-the social interests in protecting the officials' freedom of action.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Restatement (Second) of Torts \u00a7 767 comment d (Am. Law Inst. 1979). I conclude that the Township officials have a strong interest in advocating for the community's well-being and giving voice to local residents' views on land use policy. Representative government requires that officials consider and respond to the concerns of citizens, and officials' freedom to serve their constituents without fear of repercussions (except from the electorate) is of great social utility.\n   <em>\n    See\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12530031\" index=\"76\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/364/436/\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   at comments f, g. Pierson has not sufficiently challenged the motive of the individual officials by plausibly alleging that they pursued the public interest in bad faith or through wrongful means.\n   <em>\n    See\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12530031\" index=\"77\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/364/436/\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   at comment f.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-56\">\n   I conclude that the actions of Township officials are privileged even as I also acknowledge the social interest in protecting Pierson's contractual rights-the third Restatement factor-and Pierson's direct interest in reaping the benefits of his contract with the Turnpike Commission-an element of the fifth Restatement factor. For that matter, the Turnpike Project itself serves a social interest. But the question before me is \"whether, upon a consideration of the relative significance of the factors involved, the conduct should be permitted without liability,\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     despite\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n   its effect of harm to another.\"\n   <em>\n    Triffin\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"929888\" index=\"78\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/pa-super/426/57/\">\n    626 A.2d at 574\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (quoting Restatement (Second) of Torts \u00a7 767 comment b (Am. Law Inst. 1979)) (emphasis added). By definition, regulatory actions taken by governmental officials will impact the commercial activities of those subject to such regulation. Courts should therefore exercise caution before attaching tort liability to the decision-making process of such officials. After balancing all of the Restatement factors,\n   <footnotemark>\n    10\n   </footnotemark>\n   I conclude that the allegations set forth in the Counterclaim do not suffice to establish Township officials acted improperly. Absent clear allegations that they knew their decisions were totally without any colorable legal foundation, or that they acted with corrupt motives, their efforts to regulate the reactivation of the quarry, including the asphalt plant, were privileged and justified.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-57\">\n   Pierson therefore has not stated a claim for tortious interference with contractual relations, and I will grant the Motion to Dismiss with respect to this claim as well.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-58\">\n   Both remaining counts of the Counterclaim will be dismissed with prejudice.\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-61\">\n    A more detailed recitation of the facts is set forth in my opinion addressing equitable relief.\n    <em>\n     See\n     <extracted-citation case-ids=\"929888\" index=\"79\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/pa-super/426/57/\">\n      id.\n     </extracted-citation>\n    </em>\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"2\">\n   <p id=\"p-62\">\n    Under Pennsylvania law, a permit may be maintained as \"active\" so long as a certain minimal cottage is extracted each year, even if the quarry is not marketing its product to the public.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"3\">\n   <p id=\"p-63\">\n    The Counterclaim indicates that these statements were made at a meeting on December 2, which I assume is a typographical error.
