No. 23-3 at 7.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   In December 2015, the odor ordinance was amended to increase the civil penalty for municipal violations from $ 100 per offense to $ 750 for a \"first offense,\" and $ 1,000 for repeated violations.\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   Doc. No. 23-2 at 7, Doc. No. 30-1 at 60-61. On June 27, 2016, Sibley amended the odor ordinance to add the words \"unreasonably\" and \"unreasonable.\" Specifically, the June 2016 version states:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-35\">\n   \"[N]uisance\" shall mean whatever is injurious to health, indecent, or\n   <em>\n    unreasonably\n   </em>\n   offensive to the senses, or an obstruction to the free use of property, so as essentially to interfere\n   <em>\n    unreasonably\n   </em>\n   with the comfortable enjoyment of life or property.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-36\">\n   * * *\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-37\">\n   Offensive Smells: The erecting, continuing or using of any building or other place for the exercise of any trade, employment or manufacture which, by occasioning\n   <em>\n    unreasonably\n   </em>\n   noxious exhalations,\n   <em>\n    unreasonably\n   </em>\n   offensive smells or other\n   <em>\n    unreasonable\n   </em>\n   annoyances, becomes injurious and dangerous to the health, comfort or property of individuals or the public.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   Doc. No. 23-2 at 15 (emphasis added). This amendment brought the odor ordinance in line with the Iowa Code's definition of nuisance.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"33\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Iowa%20Code%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%20657.1\">\n    Iowa Code \u00a7\u00a7 657.1\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1) (nuisance defined), 657.2(1) (odor as a nuisance).\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n   Finally, if \"the authorized municipal\n   representative finds that a nuisance exists, and that the appropriate method of abatement is reasonably ascertainable from the circumstances,\" the ordinance provides procedures for abatement including notice and the right to a public hearing. Doc. No. 23-2 at 17.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     C. The Conflict\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   Before ChemSol purchased the Facility and IDP began drying product, the companies had dealings with the Sibley City Council and with the Osceola County Economic Development Commission (OCEDC).\n   <footnotemark>\n    7\n   </footnotemark>\n   ChemSol applied for economic development grants from the United States Department of Agriculture (USDA) and from the OCEDC. The OCEDC approved plaintiffs' applications for an Economic Development grant. Doc. No. 30-1 at 26-27. Ultimately, however, ChemSol states that it purchased the facility using its own funds and returned the grant due to issues with the OCEDC's \"increasing demands ... after receiving the funds.\" Doc. No. 30-2 at 67\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   Once the Facility began drying products, IDP's operations made Sibley stink. The odor has been described as rotten eggs, dried blood, rotten animal carcasses (boiling, burning and decomposing), vomit, human waste and dead bodies. Residents report that the smell makes them gag or throw up and that it limits the amount of time that they can stand to be outside. Depending on the weather, the odor can be detected all over town. Doc. No. 23-4 at 89-100; Doc. No. 23-5 at 1-100.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   Plaintiffs contend that they disclosed that the Facility would create unpleasant odors before IDP commenced operations. In support of this, plaintiffs point to (1) the description of IDP's proposed operations included in the OCEDC grant application, (2) Zilverberg's recollection of his conversations with City Council members and (3) Bowlsby's recollection of his conversations with City Council members. However, the summary judgment record does not clearly establish what information Sibley was given before IDP began operating at the facility. The OCEDC grant application describes the products that would be dried at the facility but does not describe any odors that would result.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Doc. No. 30-1 at 34. Zilverberg recalls telling Kirk Grau\n   <footnotemark>\n    8\n   </footnotemark>\n   at the OCEDC that \"[IDP's] products are going to have odors,\" but Zilverberg did not have a conversation regarding those odors with Sibley's city council. Doc. No. 30-2 at 55.

You know, being offensive is a matter of opinion sometimes so we decided, we're not gonna do anything on them if it's just one phone call, two phone calls. We wanted multiple phone calls before we'd go out and issue citations. And that's exactly what we did. We put the number at three and so each time we received more than three or more complaints, that's when we'd go out and write the citations. Before we went and wrote the citations, myself or whatever deputy is working - you would go out around town. You'd go out and smell and we determined that if it was an offensive odor, three people thought it was offensive, and the deputy or myself thought it was offensive, then we went and wrote the citation. After writing the citation, we would just take down the current weather conditions, temperature, wind direction, wind speed, things like that ... if you couldn't be outside, it was offensive.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-73\">\n   Doc.

The type of scrubber (specs?) the dollars to be committed to it, the dates of installation and testing protocol would be of interest. Thinking out loud, perhaps hiring a neutral engineer to evaluate? My understanding is that Stanton is building a scrubber for a small unit in the plant, but is unable to do the larger dryer. So there needs to be some discussion of how to address that issue following any testing of the scrubber on the smaller unit. I found the attached online and perhaps an estimate from a company like this one, experienced in the field, would be helpful as a sign of good faith for moving forward on the larger unit and any others installed in the future.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-84\">\n   A related issue is that Stanton needs to actually be paid. We don't represent them, but I know there are mechanic's liens filed and local contractors unpaid. That doesn't help the public mood. Having this work done but not paying for it will create more public relations problems that no one needs. Cash up front to Stanton would be advisable. They are trustworthy and will do the work spec[ifie]d. This is a small town and the payment issue goes to trustworthiness. For any plan to work people need to be convinced that the company is trustworthy.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-85\">\n   As I said, the LaMarca and Landry law firm in Des Moines is seeking clients for a nuisance action. I understand that they are signing up businesses and individuals rather than doing a class lawsuit. Damages in such an action largely disappear if the problem is solved. We represent some private clients, and will need to discuss any plans with them also. They are independent of the city, but have all expressed their willingness to walk away if the problem is solved. They are not wanting protracted litigation with a pot of gold at the end of the rainbow. These are business people who want all businesses to thrive, including IDP. We have deliberately avoided trying to expand the group of people we represent, because we do not want people involved who are unwilling to walk\n   away upon abatement. Our interest is in abating the nuisance.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-86\">\n   I mentioned personal liability not as a threat but as a point to note. Tort liability is not shielded by corporations. Individual actors still have liability. Nuisances are torts under Iowa law, and your clients need to be aware of that.

Finally, plaintiffs state that Sibley is estopped from claiming that operation of the Facility creates a public nuisance because Sibley granted IDP permission to operate that Facility. Sibley responds that the out-of-town offensive odors are outside of Sibley's jurisdiction and, in any event, that there is no evidence that these odors are \"injurious and dangerous to the health, comfort or property of individuals or the public.\" Sibley denies that it is estopped from enforcing its odor ordinance and argues that its enforcement techniques are constitutional.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-160\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     a.

As a result, plaintiffs claim that Sibley is estopped from enforcing the odor ordinance against them. Sibley denies that it made any representations that it would not enforce local ordinances. The evidence on this point is mixed. Sibley was informed that there would be some odor but there is no evidence that it was informed of the full extent of the odor. More importantly, there is no evidence in the record that Sibley made any promises to plaintiffs regarding the enforcement of local ordinances.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-162\">\n   Under Iowa law, the elements of estoppel are:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-163\">\n   (1) a clear and definite promise; (2) the promise was made with the promisor's clear understanding that the promise was seeking an assurance upon which the promise could rely and without which he would not act; (3) the promise acted to his substantial detriment in reasonable reliance on the promise; and (4) injustice can be avoided only by enforcement of the promise.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-164\">\n   <em>\n    Kunde v.

To the extent Count III alleges liability based on enacting the odor ordinance, Sibley is entitled to summary judgment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-215\">\n   Sibley is also entitled to summary judgment to the extent that Count III alleges liability for enforcing the odor ordinance. As discussed above, the ordinance\n   is a valid exercise of Sibley's police powers, authorized by Iowa law, and constitutionally permissible. The tort of interference with expected business advantage requires that the defendant act \"improperly.\" Sibley did not take any actions with respect to enforcing the ordinance that were not authorized by law. Nor is there evidence that Sibley acted with \"the sole or primary purpose to injure or destroy the plaintiff.\"\n   <em>\n    Fin. Mktg.

Communication with Third Parties as Interference\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-217\">\n   Sibley argues that it is entitled to summary judgment as to the allegations that it interfered with a prospective buyer of the Facility because IDP has failed to identify any such action that is attributable to the city (beyond enacting and enforcing the odor ordinance). The summary judgment record contains no details as to the alleged \"barrage of negative comments about IDP\" leveled at a potential buyer. In resisting the motion for summary judgment, IDP focuses solely on Sibley's actions concerning the odor ordinance, not on statements Sibley allegedly made to anyone.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Doc. No. 30 at 36-37 (\"Through the legislative process, Sibley, after the fact, attempted to shut Plaintiffs down, it attempted to control Plaintiff's operations....\").

Thus, economic regulation is subject to a less strict vagueness test because its subject matter is often more narrow, and because businesses, which face economic demands to plan behavior carefully, can be expected to consult relevant legislation in advance of action. Indeed, the regulated enterprise may have the ability to clarify the meaning of the regulation by its own inquiry, or by resort to an administrative process. The Court has also expressed greater tolerance of enactments with civil rather than criminal penalties because the consequences of imprecision are qualitatively less severe. And the Court has recognized that a scienter requirement may mitigate a law's vagueness, especially with respect to the adequacy of notice to the complainant that his conduct is proscribed.\n   </blockquote>\n   <p id=\"p-240\">\n    <em>\n     Village of Hoffman Estates v.
