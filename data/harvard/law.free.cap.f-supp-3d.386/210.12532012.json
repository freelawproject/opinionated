(Docket No. 164.) For the reasons set forth below, PRIDCO's motion for reconsideration is\n   <strong>\n    DENIED\n   </strong>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   <strong>\n    I. Background\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   The United States commenced this action on September 25, 2015, asserting that PRIDCO is liable for all response costs \"incurred by the [Environmental Protection Agency] in connection with the [Maunabo Area Groundwater Contamination Superfund Site]\" pursuant to the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act (\"CERCLA\"), 42 U.S.C. sections 9607\n   <em>\n    et seq.\n   </em>\n   (Docket No. 1; Docket No. 8 at p. 7.) The Court granted the United States' motion to trifurcate this litigation into a Liability Phase (\"Phase I\"), a Cost Phase (\"Phase II\"), and a Contribution Phase (\"Phase III\"). (Docket No. 85.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   The Court held that PRIDCO is\n   <em>\n    prima facie\n   </em>\n   liable pursuant to CERCLA in Phase I.\n   <em>\n    United States v. P.R. Indus.

The third-party defense offered PRIDCO a potential reprieve from the strict-liability regime set forth in CERCLA.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12523094\" index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/287/133/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   (citing\n   <em>\n    Acushnet Co.,\n   </em>\n   191 F.3d at 74 (\"CERCLA, as we have said on other occasions, sketches the contours of a strict liability regime.\")).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   The United States and PRIDCO filed cross-motions for summary judgment regarding the third-party defense and costs. (Docket Nos. 142 &amp; 143.) To invoke the third-party defense, PRIDCO had to establish by a preponderance of the evidence that \"an act or omission of a third party other than an employee or agent of [PRIDCO], or than one whose act or omission occurs in connection with a contractual relationship\" caused the groundwater contamination.\n   <extracted-citation index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%209607\">\n    42 U.S.C. \u00a7 9607\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (b)(3) ;\n   <em>\n    see, e.g.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    United States v.

PRIDCO emphasized repeatedly that the source of contamination is unknown. (\n   Docket No. 143 at p. 45.) This proposition only underscored that the third-party defense is inapplicable. Accordingly, the Court granted the United States' motion for summary judgment regarding the third-party defense.\n   <em>\n    United States v. P.R. Indus. Dev.

R. Civ. P. 56 and their interaction with the third-party defenses under CERCLA.\" (Docket No. 164 at p. 6.)

A motion for reconsideration does \"not provide a vehicle for a party to undo its own procedural failures [or] allow a party [to] advance arguments that could and should have been presented to the district court prior to judgment.\"\n   <em>\n    Iverson v.

Discussion\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   PRIDCO misconstrues CERCLA, asserting that the United States failed \"to meet its statutory obligation of identifying the location of the actual release or the source of the groundwater contamination within PRIDCO's property.\" (Docket No. 164 at p. 4.) The Court has reiterated throughout this litigation that \"CERCLA contains no causation element.\"\n   <em>\n    P.R. Indus. Dev. Co.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12523094\" index=\"12\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/287/133/\">\n    287 F.

The United States is under no \"statutory obligation\" to prove that PRIDCO's property is the source of the contamination.

Instead of proving that a third-party caused the release of hazardous substances, however, PRIDCO speculates that the groundwater contamination originated from the Navarro property.
