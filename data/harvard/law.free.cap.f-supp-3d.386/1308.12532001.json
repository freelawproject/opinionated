Drozd, UNITED STATES DISTRICT JUDGE\n  </author>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   This matter is before the court on defendant Netafim Irrigation, Inc.'s motion to dismiss the first amended complaint. (Doc. No. 18.) On May 7, 2019, that motion came before the court for hearing. Attorney A. Peter Rausch, Jr. appeared on behalf of plaintiffs Jain Irrigation, Inc. (\"Jain\"), Agri-Valley Irrigation (\"AVI\"), and Irrigation Design &amp; Construction LLC (\"IDC\"). Attorneys Kendall H. MacVey and Kenneth Reinker appeared on behalf of defendant. Having considered the parties' briefing, and for the reasons that follow, defendant's motion will be granted with leave to amend.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   <strong>\n    BACKGROUND\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   In the first amended complaint, plaintiffs allege as follows. Jain manufactures and sells a wide variety of drip and micro-irrigation equipment throughout the United States, and as of 2017 has sales of approximately $80,000,000.00. (Doc. No. 14 (\"FAC\") at \u00b6 10.) IDC is in the business of designing, engineering, fabricating, installing, and maintaining agricultural irrigation systems and selling irrigation supplies and parts at seven retail locations serving the Central and Salinas Valleys of California. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 11.) AVI does similar work throughout the Central Valley. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 12.) Like Jain, defendant Netafim also manufactures and sells drip and micro-irrigation products. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 14.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   On or about April 19, 2017, IDC and AVI announced that they had each entered into an agreement to provide equity to a newly formed company, Jain Distribution Holdings, Inc. (\"Jain Distribution\"), funded by Jain. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 13.) Although Jain Distribution became an investor and part owner of AVI and IDC, each continued to be managed and operated as an independent distributor. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) Beginning that same month, plaintiffs allege that Netafim began to form and enter into a conspiracy with other companies to boycott IDC and AVI. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 28.) These companies include, but are not limited to, Rivulis Irrigation, Inc. (\"Rivulis\"), Eurodrip U.S.A., Inc. (\"Eurodrip\"), The Toro Company (\"Toro\"), Bowsmith, Inc. (\"Bowsmith\"), Rain Bird Corporation (\"Rain Bird\"), Landmark Irrigation, Inc. (\"Landmark\"), and Hydratec, Inc. (\"Hydratec\"). (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6\u00b6 15-22, 28.) In furtherance of the conspiracy, each of these companies (collectively, the \"Conspiring Manufacturers\") terminated their prior business relationships with IDC and AVI and refused to supply any further products to either company. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 28.) That same month, and pursuant to the same conspiracy, the Conspiring Manufacturers agreed with an unknown number of distributors (including at least Landmark and Hydratec) that in exchange for the Conspiring Manufacturers' agreement to boycott AVI and IDC, the distributors would boycott Jain by reducing or terminating their purchases of Jain products. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 29.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   The FAC describes Netafim as the \"instigator\" of the conspiracy and alleges that it sought to recruit other manufacturers to join. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 30.) The FAC also alleges that following the announcement of Jain Distribution's formation, Netafim's president telephoned an executive of Fresno Valve &amp; Casting (\"Fresno Valve\"), a manufacturer of irrigation equipment and a direct competitor of both Netafim and Jain, and stated in substance that Jain \"broke the rule\" prohibiting manufacturers from selling directly to growers. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) The Netafim president then asked Fresno Valve to join Netafim to stop the violation of this \"rule.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) Fresno Valve did not agree to join, and after speaking to executives at AVI and IDC confirming their intention and ability to continue to act independently, Fresno Valve's executive advised that Fresno Valve would not cut off sales to them. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) A few days after that phone call, Netafim publicly announced that it was terminating its relationship with IDC and AVI. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 31.) In May and June 2017, Rivulis, Toro, Rain Bird, and Bowsmith took similar action. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6\u00b6 32-35.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   Although Fresno Valve did not join the boycott of AVI and IDC, it remained under significant pressure to do so. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 36.) The FAC alleges that various distributors had direct discussions with Fresno Valve executives, stating in substance that \"you are either with us or against us.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) Representatives from Bowsmith visited Fresno Valve and suggested to their executives that it would be better to cut off AVI and IDC. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 37.) The FAC\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   further alleges that there was particular pressure on Fresno Valve because it was virtually the only source of filters for AVI and IDC. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 36.) Thus, if Fresno Valve could be persuaded to join the boycott, it would effectively \"cripple\" AVI and IDC. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   )\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   The FAC also describes an incident in which AVI and Rivulis representatives met over lunch to discuss the boycott. The Rivulis representative revealed that although Rivulis had projected a loss of 20% of its business due to the boycott, it turned out that the boycott had caused much greater losses. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 42.) The Rivulis representative went on to state that \"Netafim started this whole thing\" and was the \"ring leader\" of the arrangement. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) The representative further stated that Netafim had asked Rivulis to \"join them in cutting off Jain\" for the purpose of hurting Jain because Jain had \"crossed the line\" by getting into the distribution market, that Netafim had been calling other \"suppliers\" and asking them not to sell to AVI or IDC, and that Netafim and Rivulis intended to cost AVI and IDC business. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   )\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   In August 2017, Netafim brought several distributors in California to a meeting in Washington State. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 43.) At the meeting, the distributors discussed strategies to \"take out\" AVI and IDC and agreed that they should work together to damage AVI and IDC. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) The FAC lists numerous companies who had representatives present at this meeting. Ultimately, as a result of the conspiracy, or by reason of threats or pressure from the Conspiring Manufacturers, numerous companies have either reduced or eliminated their purchases from Jain. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 50.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   Plaintiffs seek both damages and injunctive relief under the Sherman Act,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=15%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201\">\n    15 U.S.C. \u00a7 1\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , and the Cartwright Act, California Business and Professions Code \u00a7\u00a7 16720 and 16726. In addition, plaintiffs assert that defendants have interfered with prospective economic relations. Defendant moved to dismiss the FAC on February 6, 2019. (Doc. No. 18.) On March 19, 2019, plaintiffs filed an opposition. (Doc. No. 23.) Defendant filed a reply on April 2, 2019. (Doc.

Plaintiffs' opposition to the pending motion to dismiss fleshes out this theory and describes the alleged conspiracy as of the \"hub and spoke\" variety, in which Netafim and the Conspiring Manufacturers are the hub, the distributors are the spokes, and the rim is the agreement among the distributors to (a) refuse to make purchases from Jain and (b) to prevent AVI and IDC from obtaining the products of the Conspiring Manufacturers. (Doc. No. 23 at 21 n.3.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   The Ninth Circuit's approach to hub and spoke conspiracies was first discussed in\n   <em>\n    In re Musical Instruments &amp; Equipment Antitrust Litigation\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4331544\" index=\"51\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/798/1186/#p1192\">\n    798 F.3d 1186\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 1192 (9th Cir. 2015).

Cal. Feb. 4, 2016) (\"Vertical refusals to deal-for example, between a manufacturer and a retailer-do not per se violate the Sherman Act and are instead subject to the 'rule of reason,' which examines an agreement for its anticompetitive effects.\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   As applied here, this line of cases presents a quandary. On one hand, the structure of the conspiracy alleged appears quite similar to that in\n   <em>\n    In re Musical Instruments\n   </em>\n   since it involves both horizontal agreements between manufacturers (such as Netafim and Rivulis) and vertical agreements between manufacturers and distributors (such as Netafim and RDO). (FAC at \u00b6\u00b6 40, 42.) The proper approach under the decision in\n   <em>\n    In re Musical Instruments\n   </em>\n   would appear to be to analyze the horizontal agreements using a per se approach, and the vertical agreements under the rule of reason. On the other hand, plaintiffs in this case are explicit in their briefing that the entire conspiracy as alleged \"is per se unlawful,\" (Doc. No. 23 at 23), and the FAC makes clear that plaintiffs are specifically alleging a per se violation of the Sherman Act. (FAC at \u00b6 6 n.1.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   Based on the precedent discussed above, the court finds that the conspiracy alleged by plaintiffs, even if proven, does not amount to a per se violation of \u00a7 1 of the Sherman Act. Plaintiffs' theory of the case is that as part of the conspiracy, \"the Conspiring Manufacturers agreed with an unknown number of dealer/distributors ... that, in exchange for the Conspiring Manufacturers' agreement to boycott AVI and IDC, such dealer/distributors would engage in a group boycott or collective refusal to deal with Jain[.]\" (FAC at \u00b6 29.) Thus, the conspiracy alleged is premised upon vertical agreements between manufacturers and distributors, in which the manufacturers agree to boycott AVI and IDC in return for the distributors agreeing to boycott Jain.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   At oral argument, plaintiffs for the first time advanced a new argument-namely, that rather than one single conspiracy, the FAC in fact alleges two entirely separate conspiracies. In this telling, the FAC alleges one horizontal conspiracy among manufacturers, and a second horizontal conspiracy among distributors, with some nebulous, unspecified connection running between them. This argument is belied by the FAC itself and the allegations therein which repeatedly refers to a single conspiracy. (\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   , FAC at \u00b6\u00b6 30, 32-34,\n   36-38.) The court is bound to accept the factual allegations of the FAC as true for purposes of resolving the pending motion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   Moreover, the law is clear that vertical agreements involving boycotts must be analyzed under the rule of reason.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    NYNEX Corp.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11076388\" index=\"59\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/525/128/#p135\">\n    525 U.S. at 135\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11076388\" index=\"60\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/525/128/#p135\">\n    119 S.Ct. 493\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ;\n   <em>\n    Calculators Haw., Inc. v.

Cal. 2013) (rejecting plaintiff's argument that a conspiracy involving \"manufacturers, distributors, and a retailer\" was per se unlawful because a manufacturer's agreements with its distributors are vertical agreements, to which per se analysis does not apply). The conspiracy alleged by plaintiff in the FAC simply is not susceptible to per se treatment under controlling law, because of which it must be dismissed. Moreover, because plaintiffs' Cartwright Act claims rise or fall depending on the success of its Sherman Act claim, plaintiffs' Cartwright Act claims must also be dismissed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   <strong>\n    B. Claim for Interference with Prospective Economic Relations\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   Next, the court addresses plaintiffs' state law claim for interference with prospective economic relations. Defendant argues that such a claim requires an underlying violation of law, and that because plaintiffs' antitrust claims must fail, this claim does as well. (Doc. No. 18 at 23.) \"[A] plaintiff seeking to recover for an alleged interference with prospective contractual or economic relations must plead and prove as part of its case-in-chief that the defendant not only knowingly interfered with the plaintiff's expectancy, but engaged in conduct that was wrongful by some legal measure other than the fact of interference itself.\"\n   <em>\n    Della Penna v.

Plaintiffs do not dispute this point of law but contend that they have satisfied their burden in this regard by adequately alleging violations of the Sherman and Cartwright Acts. (Doc. No. 23 at 25.)

(\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   )\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 15 instructs courts to \"freely give leave when justice so requires\" and that rule is \"to be applied with extreme liberality.\"\n   <em>\n    Eminence Capital, LLC v.
