The case comes before the Court upon the Report and Recommendation (\"the R &amp; R\") (Docket No. 33) of United States Magistrate Judge Leslie G. Foschio, issued May 2, 2017, regarding Defendant's Motion for Judgment on the Administrative Record (Docket No. 23) and Plaintiff's Motion for Summary Judgment/Alternative Motion for Judgment Pursuant to Fed.

Plaintiff's Medical History\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   Plaintiff is a board-certified neurologist with a number of medical issues dating back to at least 2005. Because Plaintiff continued to submit additional medical evidence during his appeal, the records cover a period extending into mid-2014. During that time, Plaintiff was examined in person and treated by at least twelve physicians, seven of whom were specialists in rheumatology: Drs. Frank Lipson, Yan Liu, Simon Carette, Larry Moreland, Ernesto Levy, Joseph Grisanti, and John Stone. No treating provider whose records are contained in the Administrative Record concluded that Plaintiff was capable of continuing to work as a neurologist.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   <strong>\n    A. 2005 Records\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   On January 17, 2005, Plaintiff saw nephrologist Dr. George Wu for symptoms of proteinuria. He had \"significant general fatigue\" and right knee arthralgia without\n   inflammation. Dr. Wu requested repeat serology regarding Plaintiff's renal function and complement levels. PLA-CL-IDI-000700.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   Plaintiff underwent a whole body bone scan on August 24, 2005, at the request of rheumatologist Dr. Frank Lipson. There are a few handwritten treatment notes from Dr. Lipson in the record, but they are very difficult to read. The radiologist saw \"unusual\" bone uptake about the proximal tibiae and increased tracer accumulation in multiple small and large joints, which was \"striking and may reflect a polyarthropathy.\" PLA-CL-IDI-000476. An MRI was advised but apparently never performed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   Plaintiff returned to see Dr. Wu on August 26, 2005, regarding his proteinuria. Dr. Wu noted Plaintiff's history of arthralgia in the knee area. Though the bone scan performed several days before showed increased bone uptake at the tibial-fibular junction, there was no definitive diagnosis of a rheumatological issue. Dr. Wu ordered a battery of renal tests. PLA-CL-IDI-000691-692.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   <strong>\n    B. 2006 Records\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   At a February 8, 2006 visit with Dr. Wu, Plaintiff complained of arthralgia, particularly in the right knee. Plaintiff had no active joints or effusions. PLA-CL-IDI-000683-684. Dr. Wu requested additional testing in regard to Plaintiff's proteinuria.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4326897\" index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/35/274/#p280\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   On October 16, 2006, Plaintiff followed up with Dr. Wu for his proteinuria. PLA-CL-IDI-000678-679. Dr. Wu reported that in the last year, Plaintiff had symptoms of fatigue, malaise, paresthesia and polyarthralgia. That day, Plaintiff had a red left eye, as his scleritis was active. Dr. Wu noted that scleritis can be associated with Wegener's granulomatosis, polyarteritis nodosa, collagen vascular disease such as rheumatoid arthritis, and granulomatous disease such as sarcoidosis. Dr. Wu requested repeat serological testing.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   A total body bone scan with spectrometry was performed on November 24, 2006, at rheumatologist Dr. Lipson's request. The radiologist reported mild focal uptake in both knees in keeping with arthropathy and \"[a]ctivity also in keeping with arthritic change noted in both sternoclavicular joints and small joints of both hands and feet.\" PLA-CL-IDI-000473. There was no definitive diagnostic impression. Dr. Lipson ordered certain lab work done in 2005, which revealed that Plaintiff's anti-nuclear antibodies and rheumatoid factor were negative.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   <strong>\n    C. 2007 Records\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   In a follow-up with nephrologist Dr. Wu on April 30, 2007, Plaintiff reported that he \"feels fatigued,\" has \"occasional pain at the tibial-fibular joint,\" and was experiencing paresthesia. PLA-CL-IDI-000674. Dr. Wu noted some muscle-wasting distally. He urged Plaintiff to obtain a nerve conduction study and asked him to repeat the renal function and serological tests.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4326897\" index=\"6\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/35/274/#p280\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   Plaintiff was referred to rheumatologist Dr. Yan Liu by his former primary care physician Dr. Antoun A.M. Toma.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   In a letter dated August 16, 2007, to Dr. Toma, Dr. Liu recounted that since last year Plaintiff had been developing increasing polyarticular pain involving small and large joints with some morning stiffness. Dr. Liu noted the abnormal repeat bone scan findings of multi-articular uptake in small and large joints. Dr. Liu observed\n   that although the negative rheumatoid factor and benign joint exam \"goes against rheumatoid arthritis that can manifest as scleritis,\" he \"certainly would keep it within the differential diagnosis.\" PLA-CL-IDI-000669-670.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   On November 26, 2007, Plaintiff was seen in follow-up by Dr. Liu for \"small vessel vasculitis (possibly Wegener's [granulomatosis ] )[,]\" the manifestations of which have included red cell casts, scleritis and joint pain. PLA-CL-IDI-000661. Dr. Liu noted that Plaintiff's repeat serology was unremarkable.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4326897\" index=\"7\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/35/274/#p280\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   <strong>\n    D. 2008 Records\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   Plaintiff saw nephrologist Dr. Wu on January 18, 2008, in follow-up, for diagnoses of proteinuria and possible microscopic polyangiitis. He did have some occasional elbow pain and right patellar discomfort. Dr. Wu observed \"no overt inflammation\" and \"no active joints.\" PLA-CL-IDI-000651.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   On October 5, 2006, a handwritten note from ophthamologist Dr. Calvin Breslin indicates that he saw Plaintiff for his left eye episcleritis with limbic keratitis. Dr. Breslin prescribed 60 mg of prednisone which should eventually be tapered to 40 mg. PLA-CL-IDI-000512.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   <strong>\n    E. 2009 Records\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   Plaintiff saw rheumatologist Simon Carette, M.D. on March 18, 2009, for assessment of possible vasculitis. PLA-CL-IDI-001029-1031. Dr. Carette noted that for the past 6 months, Plaintiff had progressive left sub-costal fullness, progressive anorexia, decreased energy, and progressive burning sensations in the hands and feet bilaterally, and enthesitis of the right Achille's tendon, all of which improved significantly with prednisone. On examination, Plaintiff had diffuse erythema of left cornea with significant thinning, no tender or effused joints, and unremarkable neurological findings. Plaintiff's scleritis was noted to be severe, and Dr. Carette determined that an emergency consult with ophthalmologist Dr. Breslin was indicated. Dr. Carette found it \"quite difficult to provide a unifying diagnosis\" and accordingly requested more bloodwork.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   Plaintiff saw Dr. Breslin again on March 19, 2009, at Dr. Carette's request, for Plaintiff's \"active scleritis with corneal thinning of left eye\" and inability to taper his prednisone dosage (10 mg) any further. PLA-CL-IDI-000514. Dr. Breslin indicated that Plaintiff should increase the prednisone to 60 mg daily and add an immunosuppressant, Imuran (azothioprine); once the eyhe was clear, he could taper off the prednisone. PLA-CL-IDI-000515.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   Plaintiff returned to see Dr. Wu on March 20, 2009, who, as far as a renal diagnosis, wrote \"[q]uery microscopic polyangiitis or Wegener's granulamatosis.\" Dr. Wu noted that when Plaintiff was on prednisone, his scleritis and polyarthralgia \"improved significantly.\" PLA-CL-IDI-0005. However, he was still awaiting Dr. Carette's assessment as to further treatment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   <strong>\n    F. 2010-2011 Records\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   There are no office visit notes or other medical records from these years in the Administrative Record. Although Plaintiff did see rheumatologist Dr. Larry Moreland on May 20, 2011, this note is not contained in the Administrative Record.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   <strong>\n    G. 2012 Records\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   Plaintiff saw his new primary care physician, Todd Orszulak, D.O., on May 2, 2012, and June 13, 2012, and review of systems was negative for fatigue. PLA-CL-IDI-001313-1317. On September 17, 2012, Dr. Orszulak's review of systems was\n   positive for fatigue. PLA-CL-IDI-001321-1323.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   <strong>\n    H. 2013 Records\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   On January 24, 2013, Plaintiff saw Dr. Orszulak. Review of his musculoskeletal system was negative for joint pain or muscle pain. PLA-CL-IDI-000279. On March 27, 2013, Plaintiff returned to see Dr. Orszulak for \"[w]orsening fatigue\" in regards to his \"possible 'Polychrondritis.' \" He was taking prednisone for left eye episcleritis diagnosed in 2006 by Dr. Breslin, but it was not helping the fatigue or arthritis. PLA-CL-IDI-000285. Dr. Orszulak noted that Plaintiff was \"++ for fatigue.\" PLA-CL-IDI-000286.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   Plaintiff underwent a rheumatology evaluation by Dr. Ernesto Levy, M.D. at Invision Health Brain and Spine Center on April 30, 2013. PLA-CL-IDI-001295-1298. Dr. Levy noted that\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-45\">\n   [o]ver the last several years [Plaintiff] experienced progressive symptoms such as fatigability to the extreme that he would feel dizzy and close to collapse if off prednisone. He ... would become very sick if his prednisone was lowered and extremely sick if completely tapered down.... [T]he current dose is prednisone 10 mg p.o. daily. In lowering this dose [Plaintiff] would experience dizziness, lightheartedness, a sensation of heaviness in his head, excruciating ioint pain with involvement of MCP and PIP joints as well as knee joints and metatarsophalangeal joints. He would also have worsening eye symptoms with reddening, photophobia, and he states an overall a relapse of his scleritis. In addition there would be low beck pain, end muscle spasms at diverse locations.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   PLA-CL-IDI-001295. Dr. Levy observed that \"[a]s of now, his illness remains undiagnosed[,]\" but \"[s]ome of the described features would have the prints of an inflammatory rheumatologic condition (scleritis, abnormal urine); however some other features are less specific (fatigue, dizziness).\" PLA-CL-IDI-1296. Dr. Levy's \"review of systems\" was \"[r]emarkable for extreme fatigue, headaches, and dizziness to the point that the patient would collapse; at times even holding himself to a fixed object so not to fall. He has experienced ear tinging, excessive thirst, and anxiety. He has also experienced swelling of his feet. Most symptoms exacerbate or are only evident when he is off prednisone. Moderate joint pain and important fatigability still occur at a dose of prednisone 10 mg p.o. daily.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4326897\" index=\"8\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/35/274/#p280\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   On examination, there was no formal synovitis, and all joints had full range of motion. PLA-CL-IDI-001296. \"Palpation of joints [did] not cause pain,\" Dr. Levy stated, \"though the patient feels some degree of arthralgia at all times.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4326897\" index=\"9\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/35/274/#p280\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   Dr. Levy described Plaintiff's case as \"high-complexity ... as no dear localizing manifestation exists[;] \"[t]he more compelling manifestations include arthralgia, fatigability (at some times extreme), scleritis (well documented), and intolerance to a prednisone taper.\" PLA-CL-IDI-001297. Dr. Levy recommended a new baseline blood work-up and introduction of a steroid-sparing agent (e.g., Imuran ) and a slow taper of prednisone under the guidance of an endocrinologist in order to learn more about the disease.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   Plaintiff saw rheumatologist Dr. Moreland on May 3, 2013, PLA-CL-IDI-000399-403, who noted that he had last seen Plaintiff on May 20, 2011.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   Plaintiff had brought\n   long-term disability papers to discuss with Dr. Moreland. PLA-CL-IDI-000403. Under current medical problems, Dr. Moreland noted,\n   <em>\n    inter\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    alia\n   </em>\n   , relapsing polychondritis; history of intermittent pain and swelling of ears and nose; history of scleritis ; polyarthritis, nonspecific; and severe fatigue. PLA-CL-IDI-000399. Under interval history, Plaintiff reported to Dr. Moreland that he had moved from Pennsylvania to Niagara Falls to be closer to his family as he was \"having continued problems with functioning and working\" as a neurologist in Buffalo. \"Fatigue continues to be a big issue,\" and he continued to have \"intermittent pain.\" Plaintiff informed Dr. Moreland that he \"would like to quit work because he is not able to continue to keep up with the pace.\" PLA-CL-IDI-000399. On review of Plaintiff's musculoskeletal system, Dr. Moreland noted \"[g]ood range of motion of all joints\" and \"[n]o active synovitis.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4326897\" index=\"10\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/35/274/#p280\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   Plaintiff's head, ears, nose, and throat were normal with \"no obvious pain or inflammation of external parts of ears.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4326897\" index=\"11\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/35/274/#p280\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   Dr. Moreland \"recommend[ed] that [Plaintiff] stop work completely based on his current medical problems,\" and said he would complete the disability paperwork accordingly.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4326897\" index=\"12\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/35/274/#p280\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   There were no changes to Plaintiff's medications.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   On May 30, 2013, Plaintiff saw primary care physician Dr. Orszulak for his annual visit.

Relapsing polychondritis\" on one note and as \"relapsing polychondritis-stable\" on another note. PLA-CL-IDI-000638. Dr. Rajarathna noted that Plaintiff \"plans to get disability.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-50\">\n   On September 13, 2013, Plaintiff returned to see Dr. Moreland in Pittsburgh and reported he was \"about the same\" as in May of that year. On examination, Plaintiff had \"[s]light tenderness of the left earlobe\" without significant redness; his nasal cavities appeared normal. With regard to his musculoskeletal system, Dr. Moreland noted \"[n]o active synovitis.\" PLA-CL-IDI-000409.

The Hospital is now known as Ascension Health. In connection with his employment application, Plaintiff was asked to complete a medical history questionnaire, essentially a \"check-the-box\" form, and undergo an examination (which was \"[n]ormal\"). PLA-CL-IDI-000967-973.

Benefits Specialist Robinson requested that Dr. Bress answer the following questions: \"1. Are R &amp; L's supported as per Dr. Moreland? If so, when did R &amp; L's begin? 2. What is the duration of the R &amp; L's? 3. When should [medical record] be updated for review?\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4326897\" index=\"27\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/35/274/#p280\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-100\">\n   Dr. Bress issued his report on October 8, 2018. PLA-CL-IDI-000539-543. After he \"reviewed the entire medical file,\" Dr. Bress agreed that Plaintiff's \"physical findings (although minimal) are consistent with a diagnosis of RP [i.e., relapsing polychrondritis],\" although he was \"unable to locate results of a cartilage biopsy to confirm the diagnosis.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4326897\" index=\"28\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/35/274/#p280\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   However, Dr. Bress concluded, even \"[i]f the insured has RP, it is [his] opinion that it is mild or very well controlled and therefore does not support restrictions or limitations for the following reasons:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-101\">\n   1. minimal recent physical findings-slight tenderness left ear lobe-no other findings to suggest the presence of RP such as ear redness, atrophy of ears or nasal cartilage\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-102\">\n   2. maintained only on low dose prednisone (10 mg daily)-no need for immunosuppressives\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-103\">\n   3. most recent ESR and CRP\n   <footnotemark>\n    7\n   </footnotemark>\n   normal\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-104\">\n   4. follow up visit with Dr. Moreland in 6 months-more frequent visits would\n   have been indicated if RP was active or severe[.]\"\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-105\">\n   PLA-CL-IDI-000542. With regard to the other diagnosis listed on Dr. Moreland's APS (polyarthritis ), Dr. Bress observed that examinations and laboratory findings have revealed no abnormal joint findings (e.g., no active joints or synovitis, negative antinuclear antibodies and rheumatoid factor) to suggest the presence of a polyarthritis. Therefore, Dr. Bress opined, if a polyarthritis is present, it is extremely mild and does not support restrictions or limitations. Finally, none of Plaintiff's co-morbid conditions (hypertension, steroid induced diabetes, dyslipidemia, scleritis in the left eye, polyneuropathy, vitamin D deficiency, osteoarthritis, and osteopenia ) were being claimed as impairing. Taking into consideration all of Plaintiff's conditions, both individually and in totality, it was Dr. Bress's opinion that restrictions and limitations are not supported on a physical basis.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-106\">\n   On October 15, 2013, Dr. Bress spoke with Dr. Moreland via telephone and submitted an addendum to his report that same day, PLA-CL-IDI-000562, summarizing the call as follows:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-107\">\n   Dr. Moreland stated that exam findings and results of lab tests are normal. In view of these findings, Dr. Moreland stated that he is not supporting any restrictions or limitations. Dr. Moreland mentioned that the insured states that he is unable to work because of fatigue, but there is nothing on exam and lab data to support this claimed impairment. Dr. Moreland is in agreement with my assessment as noted in my reviews. My opinion therefore remains the same.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-108\">\n   PLA-CL-IDI-000569. Also on October 20, 2013, Dr. Bress sent a letter to Dr. Moreland, repeating the above summary, for purposes of confirming the essence of their conversation. PLA-CL-IDI-000569-570. Dr. Moreland returned a copy of Dr. Bress' letter, on which he included the following handwritten note:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-109\">\n   As a Rheumatologist I see several patients with autoimmune diseases who report fatigue as a major problem. There is no blood test or approved questionnaire that accurately measures fatigue. Most often patients have normal lab (routine) and exams. So, although I have not placed any restrictions on work for Dr. Khan, he reports he cannot function with his current occupation. So, I support his claim for disability.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-110\">\n   PLA-CL-IDI-000612.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-111\">\n   After reviewing this response, Dr. Bress's opinion remained \"unchanged\" because Dr. Moreland failed to provide \"supporting evidence[,]\" \"such as findings on exam that the insured appeared fatigued or chronically ill, had difficulty with movements such as rising onto and off the exam table, or other clinical findings.\" PLA-CL-IDI-000621-622.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-112\">\n   Meanwhile, Dr. Bress attempted to schedule a peer phone call with Plaintiff's most recent primary care provider, Dr. Rajarathna, but was unable to do so. Accordingly, he sent her several questions to answer. In particular, she was asked to list any restrictions (activities which Plaintiff should not perform) and limitations (activities which he is unable to perform). Dr. Rajarathna sent a letter on November 29, 2013, stating in pertinent part, that Plaintiff's \"mental situation is greatly affected by his disability,\" that he \"says he doesn't have any physical strength to maintain any function,\" and that he is \"unable to maintain\n   any position in any length of time without pain. He did not find any period of time that he is symptoms [sic] free.\" PLA-CL-IDI-000756. Dr. Rajarathna concluded by stating that she believed Plaintiff would not be able to continue his career as a neurologist.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4326897\" index=\"29\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/35/274/#p280\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-113\">\n   Meanwhile, in a phone call with Benefits Specialist Robinson, on November 8, 2013, Plaintiff's attorney at the administrative level, Michael Quiat, Esq.

He will talk with the doctor to verify if he will provide additional information to us\" about R &amp; Ls. PLA-CL-IDI-000719. On November 18, 2013, Dr. Moreland sent a follow-up letter to Dr. Bress to clarify his position regarding Plaintiff's restrictions and limitations. He stated,\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-114\">\n   As a rheumatologist, I have experienced many patients who suffer with autoimmune diseases resulting in significant fatigue and other symptoms. Not all of those symptoms are verifiable by objective evidence, though they are no less real or debilitating.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-115\">\n   Dr. Khan reports intermittent periods of dizziness, left ear pain, burning in the feet, arthralgia (causing difficulty walking and standing) and significant pain.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-116\">\n   In the case of Dr. Khan, his positive findings on examination include elevated blood pressure, tachycardia, fluid in the ears, redness in the left eye due to scleritis, decreased left nasolabial fold with mild ptosis and swelling right knee.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-117\">\n   Clearly given the above, Dr. Khan is restricted and limited from performing the regular and substantial duties of evaluating and treating patients both in the in patient and outpatient settings.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-118\">\n   Unless and until these symptoms resolve, he will continue to be unable to perform such responsibilities.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-119\">\n   PLA-CL-IDI-000754.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-120\">\n   In an addendum to his report dated November 18, 2013, Dr. Bress indicated that notwithstanding Dr. Moreland's latest letter, his opinion remained \"unchanged.\" PLA-CL-IDI-000767.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-121\">\n   Dr. Bress also evaluated Dr. Rajarathna's letter, which did not change his opinion because she \"lists symptoms, but no physical findings.\" Dr. Rajarathna mentions lack of physical strength, but does not mention documentation of muscle weakness on exam; likewise, she mentions Plaintiff's \"mental situation\" but does not provide any cognitive deficit noted on exam. PLA-CL-IDI-000767-768. Dr. Bress observed that since the \"physical findings and results of lab tests are not in dispute, but rather the interpretation of these findings as they relate to the insured's functionality, a DMO [Designated Medical Officer] rather than an IME [Independent Medical Examination] opinion will be requested.\" PLA-CL-IDI-000768.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-122\">\n   Dr. John G. Paty, Jr., board-certified in internal medicine and rheumatology, was the DMO who performed a paper-review and concurred with Dr. Bress's opinion. PLA-CL-IDI-000772-775. Dr. Paty's December 5, 2013 report consists almost entirely of a recitation of the medical records. His opinion was that \"[w]ithin a reasonable degree of medical certainty,\" \"the medical record did not support impairment noted by Dr. Moreland\" \"because [the] physical findings[,]\" the \"laboratory data[,]\" \"the claimant's activities,\" the absence [of] medication changes with recent reported symptoms, with Prednisone continued at the same dosage, and the six-months return visit with Dr. Moreland rheumatology AP were inconsistent with impairment due to Relapsing\n   Polychondritis or pain due to multiple joint pain (polyarthralgia ) and fatigue.\" PLA-CL-IDI-000775.

Defendant's Denial of Benefits\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-124\">\n   By letter dated December 11, 2013, Benefits Specialist Robinson informed Attorney Quiat that Defendant was denying Plaintiff's claim, PLA-CL-IDI-000804-810, because the \"medical information ... received does not support an impairment that would prevent him from being able to perform the duties of his occupation. As such, he is not eligible to receive Total Disability benefits, Residual Disability benefits, Recovery benefits or Waiver of Premium.\" PLA-CL-IDI-000805. Benefits Specialist Robinson explained that the medical records \"do not support an impairment because physical findings, laboratory data, Dr. Khan's activities, the absence of medication changes with recent reported symptoms and Prednisone continued at the same dosage, as well as the six-months return visit with his treating physician are inconsistent with impairment due to Relapsing Polychondritis or pain due to polyarthralgia and fatigue.\" PLA-CL-IDI-000805. The denial letter also noted that Plaintiff's \"Individual Disability Status Update forms completed in July and August 2013 noted difficulty with mobility, fatigue, and any form of physical exertion, which is inconsistent with physical findings noted by Dr. Moreland in 2013 and by Dr. Orszulak.\" PLA-CL-IDI-000805-806. Moreover, Plaintiff's \"reported day-to-day activities of reading, computer use, occasional household chores noted in his statements, working until June 2013, and grocery shopping are inconsistent with an impairment of recurrent polychondritis.\" PLA-CL-IDI-000806. As to the diagnosis of polyarthritis, Benefits Specialist Robinson observed that Plaintiff's \"examinations revealed no abnormal joint findings to suggest the presence of this condition[,]\" and therefore, \"if this condition is present, it is extremely mild and does not support restrictions or limitations.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4326897\" index=\"32\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/35/274/#p280\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-125\">\n   <strong>\n    V.

Plaintiff's Appeal Letter, Supporting Documents and New Medical Opinions\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-127\">\n   Attorney Quiat requested Plaintiff's claim file via letter dated April 21, 2014, and the matter was reassigned to Lead Appeals Specialist Richard A. Enberg (\"Appeals Specialist Enberg\"). PLA-CL-IDI-000839. Plaintiff's formal appeal and letter brief were filed on June 9, 2014. PLA-CL-IDI-000865-880. Attorney Quiat also submitted a supporting certification from Plaintiff, PLA-CL-IDI-000881-885, and several medical records that were already on file with Defendant. In addition, Attorney Quiat submitted a new opinion from rheumatologist Dr. Joseph M. Grisanti, whom Plaintiff saw on April 10, 2014. PLA-CL-IDI-000896-898. Dr. Grisanti noted Plaintiff's history of scleritis, proteinuria, relapsing polychrondritis and arthralgias. Dr. Grisanti recommended that Plaintiff pursue early retirement or\n   disability because of his inability to function as the result of the \"dominating fatigability\" associated with the foregoing diagnoses. Dr. Grisanti was not optimistic that Plaintiff's symptoms would resolve.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-128\">\n   Finally, Attorney Quiat submitted a Notice of Award from the Social Security Administration (\"SSA\"), indicating that Plaintiff was entitled to monthly disability benefits beginning December 2013. PLA-CL-IDI-000900-903.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-129\">\n   By letter dated July 24, 2014, Attorney Quiat submitted a supplemental report from rheumatologist John H. Stone, M.D., M.P.H., dated July 23, 2014, along with Dr. Stone's clinical notes of his appointment with Plaintiff on May 29, 2014. PLA-CL-IDI-000954-958. Dr. Stone opined that the diagnosis of polychondritis was confirmed not only by the records but by the test results and his clinical evaluation of Plaintiff. Given this diagnosis, Dr. Stone stated, Plaintiff's complaints of severe fatigue and pain were \"reasonable and expected symptoms of his [r]elapsing [p]olychrondritis.\" Dr. Stone indicated that he was familiar with the types of physical requirements demanded by hospital-based medicine, and that, given Plaintiff's diagnosis of relapsing polychronditis and physical manifestations of the condition, Plaintiff was totally disabled from his prior occupation. Dr. Stone explained that his opinion was based on his past experience in treating relapsing polychrondritis, his clinical observations of Plaintiff, and a review of his medical history.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-130\">\n   <strong>\n    B.

PLA-CL-IDI-001217-1253. Plaintiff alleged disability based on relapsing polychondritis with fatigue and arthralgia. PLA-CL-IDI-001228. The medical records requested by the SSA were from Dr. Orszulak and Dr. Moreland, for the period from 2012 to the present. PLA-CL-IDI-001228, 1254-1261. Plaintiff described his duties during a typical workday as follows: walking, standing, and sitting for 2.5 hours each; and stooping, kneeling, and crouching for 1 hour each. PLA-CL-IDI-001223. He did not have to lift or carry anything heavier 10 pounds.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4326897\" index=\"33\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/35/274/#p280\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   The SSA found that no consultative examination was required; that Plaintiff had the \"severe\" impairment of \"other disorders of the nervous system\" and the \"non-severe\" impairment of \"diabetes mellitus\"; that his subjective complaints were substantiated by the objective medical evidence alone; and that there were no medical opinions. PLA-CL-IDI-001230. The SSA concluded that Plaintiff had the residual functional capacity (\"RFC\") to stand and/or walk (with normal breaks) for \"significantly less than 2 hours\" and sit (with normal breaks) for about 6 hours in an 8-hour workday. PLA-CL-IDI-001231.

He also stated that Plaintiff got an infection in 2004,\n   <footnotemark>\n    10\n   </footnotemark>\n   and since that time has been unable to discontinue prednisone ; that he has established joint pain; that he experiences extreme fatigue, headaches, and dizziness to the point where he would collapse or need to hold onto a fixed object so as not to fall; and that he has experienced swelling in his feet and has left-sided facial droop. The SSA concluded that Plaintiff did not have the RFC to perform his past relevant work as a neurologist (Dictionary of Occupational Titles (\"DOT\") code 070.101-050).\n   <footnotemark>\n    11\n   </footnotemark>\n   Because Plaintiff's impairment was \"so severe that he is limited to significantly less than a full range of sedentary work,\" Medical-Vocational Rule 204.00 directed a finding of disability.

Defendant's Medical Consultant's Review on Appeal\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-134\">\n   Defendant's in-house medical consultant Beth Schnars, M.D., board-certified in internal medicine, conducted a paper review of Plaintiff's claim and issued a report. PLA-CL-IDI-000934-939. In pertinent part, Dr. Schnars agreed that relapsing polychondritis, \"a rare autoimmune disorder characterized by progressive inflammation of cartilage particularly of the ears, nose, and trachea with cartilage destruction,\" \"can also be associated with polyarthritis and ocular symptoms[,]\" such as alleged by Plaintiff. PLA-CL-IDI-000937. Dr. Schnars commented that the treatment for this disorder was \"low dose steroids with addition of other immune modulating agents for unremitting symptoms.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4326897\" index=\"35\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/35/274/#p280\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   \"While some symptoms are supportive of this diagnosis,\" she noted, \"the medical records provided do not [sic] severity [sic] symptoms, aggressive treatment or exam findings supportive of significant underlying pathology[,]\" PLA-CL-IDI-000937, since \"[s]erial peripheral joint exams by various providers since 2005 have all been normal without any documentation of significant tenderness or synovitis [;]\" and \"[t]here has been no evidence of cartilaginous inflammation or the ears/nose/trachea (the ear lobe does not contain cartilage).\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4326897\" index=\"36\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/35/274/#p280\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-135\">\n   Dr. Schnars noted that rheumatologist Dr. Grisanti's office visit note \"remarked on tenderness of the upper aspect of the left ear without swelling/redness,\" and Dr. Moreland mentioned \"left eye ptosis with nasal labial flattening in [his] letter of advocacy in 11/13[,]\" but \"[t]hese findings have been present since 2006[,] are not suggestive of polychondritis[,] and would not contribute to functionality.\" PLA-CL-IDI-000937. Serial connective tissue panels and inflammatory markers have all been negative since 2005. Dr. Schnars observed that while Plaintiff's early bone scans noted mild peripheral joint uptake, no provider has recently recommended bone imaging \"as would be anticipated for unremitting pain limiting functionality.\" PLA-CL-IDI-000937. Morever, there have been no medication changes recommended as would be anticipated for uncontrolled\n   symptoms due to underlying rheumatologic disorder ; instead, Plaintiff has been self-prescribing prednisone (10 mg daily) since 2009, and there have been no medications used for joint pain.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4326897\" index=\"37\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/35/274/#p280\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-136\">\n   Dr. Schnars noted that Dr. Moreland \"recommended work cessation due to fatigue/arthralgias when presented with disability papers[,]\" in May 2013, but a primary care note from May 30, 2013, \"documented no reports of arthralgias or ear pain with normal exam.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-137\">\n   Considering Plaintiff's general medical diagnoses (polychondritis, episcleritis, arthralgias, diabetes, fatigue, chronic pain, hypertension and neuropathy ) collectively and individually, in a \"whole person analysis,\" Dr. Schnars found they \"do not rise to the level of impairment from or since the [date of disability]\" because all of Plaintiff's supporting medical expert opinions from Dr. Moreland, Dr. Rajarathna, Dr. Grisanti, and Dr. Stone were \"based on self reports of long standing fatigue without supporting evidence of abnormalities on exam or lab findings and lack of aggressive medical management.\" After reviewing rheumatologist Dr. Stone's letter and clinical notes, Dr. Schnars issued an addendum finding that they did not change her opinion.

Dr. Schnars provided the following questions for the outside rheumatologist's paper IME: whether the medical records support the diagnosis of polychondritis; whether the medical records support any restrictions or limitations for any period from June 10, 2013; whether the intensity of treatment, frequency of evaluation, exam findings and diagnostic testing consistent with severity of underlying disease from polychondritis or other medical conditions; and whether the medical records reflect any change in condition around the date of disability from chronic medical issues. PLA-CL-IDI-000974.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-140\">\n   On August 15, 2014, rheumatologist Alfonso Bello, M.D., of the Illinois Bone &amp; Joint Institute, was sent Dr. Schnars's questions, Plaintiff's medical records, and the in-house file reviews performed by Defendant's medical consultants. Dr. Bello was not sent the SSDI file, as it had not been received by that point. PLA-CL-IDI-000986-989.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-141\">\n   Dr. Bello submitted his report to Defendant on September 17, 2014. PLA-CL-IDI-001330-1333. In response to Defendant's specific questions, he concluded that the diagnosis of relapsing polychrondritis was confirmed based on the history, clinical examination, and evaluation by two different board-certified rheumatologists. PLA-CL-IDI-001332. Notwithstanding the diagnoses of relapsing polychrondritis and complaints of arthralgias and fatigue, Dr. Bello found \"there has been no clear evidence of physical limitations based on objective clinical evidence specifically of abnormal musculoskeletal examinations that would warrant restrictions or limitations based on [a] reasonable degree of medical knowledge.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4326897\" index=\"38\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/35/274/#p280\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   According to Dr. Bello, the level of activity required to practice medicine would fall into the category of sedentary to light duty work exertion requirements but \"there has been no data that was provided in the medical records to support restrictions in either category.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4326897\" index=\"39\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/35/274/#p280\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   Dr. Bello determined that the frequency of evaluations, exam findings, and diagnostic testing \"appear to be consistent with [Plaintiff]'s diagnosis of [sic] difficulty in the overall management; however, there is [sic] no treatment guidelines\" for relapsing\n   polychrondritis.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4326897\" index=\"40\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/35/274/#p280\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   Finally, as to whether there was any change in Plaintiff's medical condition around the alleged date of disability, Dr. Bello opined that there \"appears to be no specific findings that would indicate a flare other than of his scleritis.\" PLA-CL-IDI-001333. Dr. Bello reiterated that \"other than his subjective complaints of arthralgias and fatigue, there were no specific musculoskeletal findings are noted at any of the clinical evaluations reviewed.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4326897\" index=\"41\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/35/274/#p280\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   Therefore, \"it is difficult to assess whether in fact there were any major changes through the period of the medical records to the period reviewed.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4326897\" index=\"42\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/35/274/#p280\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-142\">\n   <strong>\n    E. Denial of the Appeal\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-143\">\n   On October 17, 2014, Appeals Specialist Enberg sent Attorney Quiat a letter stating that Defendant was denying Plaintiff's appeal. PLA-CL-IDI-001345-1351. The letter chiefly relied on Dr. Bello's file review. Defendant purported to distinguish the SSDI decision on the basis that the SSA did not include a review by a physician, that it was \"inconsistent with the medical evidence,\" that the SSA did not consider unspecified evidence subsequent to October 31, 2013, which was \"not supportive of disability,\" and that the \"comprehensive medical reviews by the Unum physician and the specialty medical examiner are compelling evidence in support of work capacity for your occupation.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-144\">\n   On November 19, 2014, Defendant submitted additional, unspecified records to Dr. Bello. PLA-CL-IDI-001364. On December 5, 2014, Dr. Bello issued a brief addendum stating that his \"previous opinion stands.\" PLA-CL-IDI-001372-1373. On December 22, 2014, Appeals Specialist Enberg notified Attorney Quiat about having forwarded the additional records to Dr. Bello, and that review of these records did not change Dr. Bello's opinion. PLA-CL-IDI-001378-1379.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-145\">\n   <strong>\n    VI. Plaintiff's Credibility\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-146\">\n   After reviewing the entire Administrative Record, it is apparent that-in the opinions of Defendant and its in-house and external medical consultants-Plaintiff's claim for long-term disability benefits stood or fell on the credibility of his subjective complaints. A district court's determination as to whether a claimant's complaints of pain and fatigue are or are not credible is a finding of fact subject to appellate review for clear error.\n   <em>\n    Connors\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1952924\" index=\"43\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/272/127/#p135\">\n    272 F.3d at 137\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . The question of whether Plaintiff's subjective complaints are sufficient evidence of disability is legal in nature and subject to\n   <em>\n    de\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    novo\n   </em>\n   review on appeal.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1952924\" index=\"44\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/272/127/#p135\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   (citing\n   <em>\n    LoPresti\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"943653\" index=\"45\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/126/34/#p39\">\n    126 F.3d at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   39 ). Thus, before proceeding to the legal issue, the Court must assess the credibility of Plaintiff's complaints and make a factual finding.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   ;\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    also\n   </em>\n   Fed. R. Civ. P. 52(a)(6).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-147\">\n   The Court is guided in its inquiry by the two-step credibility analysis utilized by adjudicators in the SSDI context.\n   <footnotemark>\n    12\n   </footnotemark>\n   The Court finds that Plaintiff has proven by a\n   preponderance of the evidence-in particular, the unanimous opinions of the physicians who examined him-that he suffers from medically determinable impairment s that could reasonably be expected to produce the pain and fatigue alleged. Defendant's in-house medical reviewers have never meaningfully challenged the validity of any of Plaintiff's diagnoses, and outside rheumatologist Dr. Bello agreed that the diagnosis of relapsing polychondritis was confirmed by the medical record.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-148\">\n   Turning to the next step, the Court notes that the SSA found that the severity of Plaintiff's symptoms were wholly substantiated by his own statements in his application and the medical records from Drs. Moreland and Orszulak (which represented but a small subset of the records reviewed by Defendant and its consultants). None of the physicians who examined Plaintiff ever suggested that he was malingering or engaging in symptom magnification.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-149\">\n   The Court finds the attempts by Defendant and its medical reviewers to dissect Plaintiff's credibility to be unavailing. For instance, in-house medical consultant Dr. Schnars noted that when rheumatologist Dr. Stone examined Plaintiff in 2014, there was \"no documentation of fatigue or limitations of functionality during [Dr. Stone's] 5/14 evaluation which is commented upon during 7/14 letter of advocacy.\" However, a review of the medical records indicates that Plaintiff consistently and routinely complained of fatigue and joint pain to all of his physicians. The fact that Dr. Stone, as well as Plaintiff's other medical providers such as Dr. Moreland, Dr. Levy, Dr. Grisanti, Dr. Rajarathna, \"relied on [his] subjective complaints hardly undermines [their] opinion[s] as to [his] functional limitations, as '[a] patient's report of complaints, or history, is an essential diagnostic tool.' \"\n   <em>\n    Green-Younger v. Barnhart\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1533950\" index=\"46\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/335/99/#p107\">\n    335 F.3d 99\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 107 (2d Cir. 2003) (quoting\n   <em>\n    Flanery v.

Based on the Court's reading of the medical records, it appears that this recommendation was made largely to mitigate Plaintiff's significant adverse effects from prednisone, such as steroid-induced diabetes and mental status changes. While Dr. Schnars asserted that Plaintiff took no medication for chronic pain, notes from nephrologist Dr. Wu indicate that Plaintiff occasionally took Celebrex, a pain medication\n   <footnotemark>\n    13\n   </footnotemark>\n   prescribed by rheumatologist Dr. Liu. On February 29, 2008, Dr. Liu informed primary care physician Dr. Toma that Plaintiff's \"joint pain is still problematic but with his BP [blood pressure] issues-we have not increased the Celebrex.\" PLA-CL-IDI-00110. Dr. Schnars and Dr. Bress found that Plaintiff's statements about the severity of his symptoms were undercut by the fact that he was only taking 10 mg of prednisone. However, the record shows that higher daily dosages \"led to side-effects of depression, mania and psychosis [.]\" PLA-CL-IDI-001029. Plaintiff has\n   stated that he still experiences break-through pain even when on prednisone. PLA-CL-IDI-000170.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-151\">\n   Appeals Specialist Enberg, Dr. Schnars and Dr. Paty relied on the fact that Plaintiff continued to work after Dr. Moreland completed the supporting disability papers to show that Plaintiff was not disabled from performing his occupation. Dr. Schnars also cited a Hospital representative's comment that the date of disability was within two weeks of Plaintiff's being terminated from his position. However, the reason given by the Hospital for Plaintiff's termination was that he was not meeting billing expectations or seeing enough patients. This actually tends to corroborate the statements Plaintiff made in 2013 to Dr. Moreland and Dr. Rajarathna that his pain and fatigue were increasing in severity to the point that he was unable to keep up the pace required of him at work, and he therefore planned to seek disability. In his sworn certification, Plaintiff stated that he understood why the Hospital was choosing not to renew his employment contract and that the Hospital had offered him work as an independent contractor; however, he turned it down because he could not manage practicing medicine at a reduced level. The fact that Plaintiff persevered in continuing to work despite his chronic fatigue and pain should not be used against him.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Reddick v.

Admission of Evidence Without Good Cause\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-162\">\n   On January 5, 2016, rheumatologist Dr. Carette issued a \"Reassessment Summary,\" indicating that Plaintiff had been diagnosed with granulomatosis with polyangiitis (\"GPA\"), formerly known as Wegener's granulomatosis. The following day, January 6, 2016, at a status conference with Magistrate Judge Foschio, Plaintiff's counsel acknowledged on behalf of his client that no discovery beyond the Administrative Record was necessary. Subsequently, in support of his summary judgment motion, Plaintiff sought admission of Dr. Carette's Reassessment Summary because it was relevant to proving that \"he is totally disabled.\" Docket No. 25-3 at 11. Defendant countered that the Reassessment Summary was not part of the Administrative Record and that Plaintiff had failed to meet his burden of establishing good cause for its admission and consideration. Plaintiff replied that \"a new diagnosis is good cause.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-163\">\n   The R &amp; R correctly stated that in the Second Circuit \"the decision whether to admit additional evidence is one which is discretionary with the district court, but which discretion ought not to be exercised in the absence of good cause.\"\n   <em>\n    DeFelice v.

The R &amp; R then concluded that Plaintiff established good cause to admit Dr. Carette's Reassessment Summary because the diagnosis was based upon objective medical testing and physical examination, and therefore was \"highly probative\" of Plaintiff's disabling condition. R &amp; R at 41. Somewhat confusingly, however, Plaintiff's counsel did not make such an argument and, in fact, admitted that Dr. Carette's Reassessment Summary was not material to the question of whether Plaintiff is disabled and entitled to benefits.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Declaration of Robert J.

In that case, the district court found that good cause existed for the admission of the report because it was\n   <em>\n    highly probative\n   </em>\n   and written by a disinterested party who had actually examined Paese, and\n   <em>\n    because Paese was not at fault for the report's initial absence from the record.\n   </em>\n   \"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5410992\" index=\"71\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/449/435/#p441\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   (emphasis supplied). Here, the record was not created until after the Administrative Record was closed. At the same time, Plaintiff arguably is not at fault for the absence of the report's\n   <em>\n    contents\n   </em>\n   from the Administrative Record. Dr. Carette's notes suggest that information which possibly could have led to an earlier diagnosis of GPA may have been overlooked by Plaintiff's treatment providers.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Docket No. 25-2, p. 16 of 36. Dr. Carette's diagnosis of GPA was made after he repeated an ANCA [Antineutrophil Cytoplasmic Antibody] test in June 2015, based on his observation that Plaintiff was \"once found to have positive ANCA's in an outside lab (method of detection not determined nor was the type of ANCA).\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5410992\" index=\"72\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/449/435/#p441\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   Dr. Carette repeated this test, which yielded positive anti-PR3.

On June 30, 2015, before ordering the new ANCA test, Dr. Carette noted they \"still don't have a clear diagnosis....\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5410992\" index=\"74\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/449/435/#p441\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5410992\" index=\"74\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/449/435/#p441\">\n    ,\n   </extracted-citation>\n   p. 16 of 36. And, as Plaintiff points out, Wegener's granulomatosis was considered as a diagnosis years ago.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-166\">\n   While Dr. Carette's notes thus suggest that the diagnosis of GPA was retrospective in nature, it is not clear. Also, as Plaintiff argues, the Disability Policy does not require that he have a definitive or certain diagnosis. Thus, it is difficult to describe Dr. Carette's report as \"highly probative\" on the issue of whether Plaintiff was disabled at the time he applied for benefits. Under\n   <em>\n    Paese\n   </em>\n   , the Court does not find good cause to admit Dr. Carette's Reassessment Summary as proof that Plaintiff was disabled as of June 10, 2013, because Plaintiff has not established that the document was \"highly probative\" and was not included in the Administrative Record through no fault of his own. The Court therefore rejects this finding of the R &amp; R.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-167\">\n   <strong>\n    2. Admissibility of Other Insurers' Decisions\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-168\">\n   The R &amp; R correctly found that the favorable claims decisions issued by The Hartford and MetLife, from whom Plaintiff had purchased disability policies, were not binding on this Court.

The R &amp; R went on to find that the \"facts\" that The Hartford and MetLife awarded long-term disability benefits \"may be considered at a bench trial.\" R &amp; R at 46 (citing\n   <em>\n    Frischman v.

Supp. 619\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 624 (E.D.N.Y. 1961) ).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-169\">\n   The Court agrees with Defendant that\n   <em>\n    Frischman\n   </em>\n   is inapposite to this ERISA matter for several reasons. Most importantly,\n   <em>\n    Frischman\n   </em>\n   stands only for the unremarkable proposition that physician's medical reports as to a claimant's disability could be considered by, but are not binding on, the SSA. Here, however, the other insurers' decisions are not actually in the Administrative Record; nor are the policies they issued or the records they considered. The only information available to the Court is Plaintiff's assertion that he was \"quickly\" awarded benefits by The Hartford and MetLife.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-170\">\n   It would demand too much of\n   <em>\n    Frischman\n   </em>\n   to read it as stating that other insurers' decisions, based on different policies containing different definitions of disability, would be relevant to this Court's determination whether\n   <em>\n    this\n   </em>\n   claimant is disabled under the policy he purchased from\n   <em>\n    this\n   </em>\n   insurer. The Court accordingly rejects this portion of the R &amp; R.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-171\">\n   <strong>\n    3. Reliance on Claims Manual Not in the Record\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-172\">\n   The R &amp; R noted that Plaintiff presented an argument to the effect that \"Defendant's own claims manual requires the SSA's decision to be given 'significant\n   weight.' \" R &amp; R at 43. Defendant objects to this observation because the claims manual itself is not in the Administrative Record and because Plaintiff did not mention the claims manual until he filed his reply brief. Defendant also objects to the R &amp; R's finding that the SSA's decision is relevant and should be given \" 'significant weight,' as required under the Disability Policy.\" R &amp; R at 46.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-173\">\n   To the extent the R &amp; R asserted that the Disability Policy requires significant weight to be accorded to a decision by the SSA, this is inaccurate: The Disability Policy mentions nothing whatever about decisions by the SSA. However, as Plaintiff counters, the Administrative Record contains evidence, from at least two employees, that the claims manual applicable to deciding claims under the Disability Policy\n   <em>\n    does\n   </em>\n   require significant weight to be given to the SSA's disability decisions.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-174\">\n   First, Appeals Specialist Enberg sought input from in-house attorney Nancy M. Smith (\"Attorney Smith\") regarding the caselaw cited in Plaintiff's appeal letter. In her response, Attorney Smith\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-175\">\n   note[d] that the Insured was awarded SSDI benefits.\n   <em>\n    Under the claim manual, the company must provide significant weight to that decision.\n   </em>\n   The administrative record would include the information provided by him that the other carriers are providing benefits.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-176\">\n   In an [sic] response you should note that the company has conducted a full and fair evaluation of the Insured's eligibility for benefits consistent with its obligations under the policy and ERISA.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-177\">\n   PLA-CL-IDI-000929 (emphasis supplied).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-178\">\n   On September 11, 2014, Appeals Specialist Enberg informed Attorney Quiat that he was awaiting receipt of the SSDI file. Appeals Specialist Enberg \"explained that if the opinion of the rheumatologist supports disability, the SSDI file would not be necessary to complete appeal. However,\n   <em>\n    if the rheumatologist does not support disability we are still required to provided significant weight to SSDI.\n   </em>\n   \" PLA-CL-IDI-001212 (emphasis supplied). As the R &amp; R notes, Defendant \" 'admits that the administrative record contains claim notes, which speak for themselves.' \" R &amp; R at 44 n. 12 (quoting Defendant's Response Statement of Facts (Docket No. 27-2) \u00b6 72; alteration omitted). In light of the foregoing, the Court finds no error in the R &amp; R's analysis of the SSA decision and the weight to be accorded to it under the claims manual applicable to Plaintiff's Disability Policy.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-179\">\n   Finally, Defendant's assertion that \"the record contains none of the information on which the SSA based its decision,\" Def.'s Obj. at 10, is incorrect. The Administrative Record contains the entire SSA file, and the SSA's decision indicates which medical records were requested, obtained, and considered.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-180\">\n   <strong>\n    4. Recommendation for a Plenary Bench Trial\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-181\">\n   Because the parties have consented to a bench trial \"on the papers\" before this Court, the R &amp; R's recommendation that a plenary bench trial is necessary,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   R &amp; R at 53-54, has been rendered moot.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-182\">\n   <strong>\n    5. The Identity of the Claims Administrator\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-183\">\n   Defendant objects that the R &amp; R misconstrued the facts related to the identity of the claims administrator. In particular, the R &amp; R asserted that \"[a]ll claims under the Disability Policy are administered by Defendant's corporate parent and agent Unum Group.\" R &amp; R at 9. Defendant notes that the R &amp; R provided no citation to the record to support this statement. In its Response to Plaintiff's Statement of Material Facts, Defendant denied Plaintiff's assertion that all decisions and all actions were made by Unum Group.

Drs. Bress, Schnars, Paty and Bello relied on the lack of \"laboratory data\" and \"objective\" clinical findings to find Plaintiff's complaints of fatigue and pain unsubstantiated. Defendant's medical reviewers largely ignored the abnormal bone scans performed in 2006 that were suggestive of a polyarthralgia. And, they have not stated what types of laboratory results they would have expected to see in a person with Plaintiff's disease profile and symptoms. As far as examination findings, they expected to see such things as a fatigued appearance, joint swelling and decreased range of motion, or the inability to get on the examination table. Defendant's consultants have not pointed to any medical authority stating that swelling and decreased range of motion always occurs in cases of polyarthralgia secondary to relapsing polychrondritis. Contrary to Defendant's suggestion, whether a patient \"looks\" tired is, of course, a wholly subjective judgment. Rheumatologist Dr. Moreland explained that there is no blood test or approved questionnaire that accurately measures fatigue, and most often his patients have normal laboratory results and examinations. Defendant's medical experts' opinions demanded unspecified types of objective proof that, given the nature of Plaintiff's diagnoses and symptoms, is essentially impossible to obtain.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-198\">\n   Defendant's medical reviewers' opinions collectively constitute an unfavorable referendum on Plaintiff's credibility, formed without the benefit of examining Plaintiff in person. The Court recognizes that while plan administrators may not arbitrarily reject or refuse to consider the opinions of a treating physician, they \"are not obligated to accord special deference to the opinions of treating physicians.\"\n   <em>\n    Black &amp; Decker Disability Plan v.

In particular, Dr. Moreland estimated Plaintiff's ability to sit, stand, and walk as \"occasional,\" which Defendant's form defined as 1 to 33 percent of a workday. Defendant's vocational expert, VRC Gaughan, provided an opinion as to the exertional and cognitive requirements of Plaintiff's job as a hospital neurologist, concluding that it was a \"light\" exertional level job which required standing for around 6 hours a day, well over 33 percent of a workday. Apparently, however, neither Defendant nor its medical reviewers considered this evidence as they did not mention Dr. Moreland's form providing specific physical limitations or VRC Gaughan's vocational assessment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-201\">\n   While Defendant's outside medical consultant Dr. Bello remarked in passing that a hospital-based neurology position is \"sedentary to light\" in exertion, he is not a vocational expert and he did not analyze Plaintiff's specific position, unlike VRC Gaughan. Consistently with VRC Gaughan, the SSA determined that, according to the DOT, the strength level of Plaintiff's previous position was \"light.\" However, discussion or mention of the SSDI decision was conspicuously absent from the reports issued by Defendant's medical consultants, notwithstanding admissions by Appeals Specialist Enberg and Attorney Smith that the claims manual applicable to deciding Plaintiff's disability claim required \"significant weight\" be accorded to a decision from the SSA. Defendant's chief justification for discounting the SSA's decision-that no medical expert reviewed Plaintiff's SSDI claim or provided an opinion-is unpersuasive, given that Defendant's consultants did not directly address whether Plaintiff is unable to perform the material and substantial duties of his occupation but instead attacked on his credibility. It further demonstrates that the opinions of Defendant's medical reviewers hardly constitute \"compelling evidence\" for ignoring the SSA's decision.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-202\">\n   In sum, the Court finds that Plaintiff has established by a preponderance of the evidence that he is unable, due to sickness or disease, to perform the material and substantial duties of his occupation as a hospital neurologist, and he therefore is\n   disabled under the \"Your Occupation\" provision of the Disability Policy.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-203\">\n   <strong>\n    D.

The R &amp; R found that Defendant had waived the affirmative defense, and that Plaintiff likewise had waived the opportunity to raise the argument of Defendant's waiver. R &amp; R at 55.
