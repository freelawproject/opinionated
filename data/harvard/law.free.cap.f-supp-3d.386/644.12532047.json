In addition, AdvanceMed conducted preliminary data analysis that showed plaintiff ranked above average in peer comparison of Medicare billing. After determining that a full audit of all claims paid to plaintiff would not be feasible, AdvanceMed conducted a statistical sampling of the Medicare claims paid to plaintiff. In this respect, AdvanceMed reviewed the services provided by plaintiff to 30 randomly selected beneficiaries and then extrapolated the overpayment determinations to estimate the total amount plaintiff was overpaid by Medicare.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-19\">\n   \u2022 AdvanceMed selected January 1, 2008 to June 30, 2010 as the period to be reviewed and used simple random sampling as the sample design. AdvanceMed defined the universe as all fully and partially paid claims submitted by the provider for the period covered. It defined the sampling unit as individual beneficiaries, with each unit identified by a health insurance claim (\"HIC\") number. AdvanceMed created the sampling frame by identifying those sampling units from the universe where at least one line of service on the claim was paid greater than $0 to the provider, and then sorted the frame by HIC number. The frame included 1,717 units.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-20\">\n   \u2022 AdvanceMed then used a random number-generator software to draw a simple random sample of 30 beneficiaries.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-21\">\n   \u2022 Fifteen of the 1,717 HIC numbers used in the sampling frame to identify the beneficiaries did not match the beneficiaries' actual HIC numbers.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-22\">\n   \u2022 On October 14, 2010, AdvanceMed requested documentation from plaintiff to support 60 Medicare claims plaintiff had submitted and received reimbursement for on behalf of those 30 beneficiaries. AdvanceMed used the documentation to conduct a medical review of those claims and determined that plaintiff had been overpaid for 33 claims not covered by Medicare. Using the lower limit of the 90% two-sided confidence interval,\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   AdvanceMed then extrapolated the sampled overpayment to conclude that plaintiff had received a total overpayment of $2,775,432.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-23\">\n   \u2022 On June 6, 2012, AdvanceMed provided Plaintiff with documentation supporting its overpayment extrapolation, including,\n   <em>\n    inter alia\n   </em>\n   , documentation of the sample design, the universe of claims, the sampling frame, the random numbers used, the random sample generated, and the statistical results.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-24\">\n   \u2022 After receiving notice of the overpayment assessment, plaintiff sought redetermination of AdvanceMed's determination that the 33 claims were not covered. The resulting decision was partially favorable, as AdvanceMed reversed 2 of the claim\n   denials. Plaintiff then requested reconsideration by a separate CMS contractor, which affirmed all 31 of the claim denials.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-25\">\n   \u2022 Next, plaintiff requested and received a hearing before an Administrative Law Judge (\"ALJ\"). At the hearing, plaintiff both challenged AdvanceMed's individual claim denials and argued that AdvanceMed's statistical sampling could not be replicated based on the documentation provided by AdvanceMed. The ALJ rejected plaintiff's challenge to AdvanceMed's statistical sampling, but reversed certain claim denials.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-26\">\n   \u2022 Finally, plaintiff requested review of the ALJ's decision by the MAC, which constituted the final stage of administrative review. On March 29, 2018, the MAC issued a decision that reversed 3 claim denials by the ALJ but affirmed the ALJ's conclusions with respect to the validity of AdvanceMed's statistical sampling and the remaining 15 claim denials.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   <strong>\n    II.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   The standards of review that govern the district court's review of the MAC's final decision are set forth in the Medicare statute and the APA.

As previous MAC decisions have concluded, failure to supply the provider with sufficient documentation to recreate the sampling frame and sample effectively deprives the provider of its right to challenge the statistical validity of the sample and thus may constitute a ground for invalidating the overpayment extrapolation.\n   <em>\n    See William Vecchioni, D.C.\n   </em>\n   , M-13-3700 (H.H.S. Nov. 20, 2013);\n   <em>\n    Global Home Care, Inc.\n   </em>\n   , M-11-116 (H.H.S. Jan. 11, 2011);\n   <em>\n    Podiatric Medical Associates\n   </em>\n   , M-10-230 (H.H.S. June 22, 2010).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   But here, as the MAC concluded, plaintiff was provided with ample documentation to enable plaintiff to replicate the sampling frame and the sample. The record confirms that the statistical sampling information CMS provided to plaintiff included,\n   <em>\n    inter alia\n   </em>\n   , an electronic spreadsheet of the frame used in the overpayment review; a memorandum explaining the universe, sampling frame, sampling unit, sample size, and sample design; the sample that was selected from the frame; and the exact random numbers that were generated and used to select the sample from the frame. And it is undisputed that applying the random numbers provided by CMS to the sampling frame provided by CMS would generate the same sample as the one selected and recorded by AdvanceMed. Thus, it is clear that the MAC's conclusion that plaintiff had sufficient records to replicate the results of AdvanceMed's sampling was rational and based on substantial evidence in the record.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   Seeking to avoid this conclusion, plaintiff argues that it was not possible to replicate the sampling frame and sample provided by CMS because 15 of the 1,717 HIC numbers\n   <footnotemark>\n    7\n   </footnotemark>\n   used to identify the beneficiaries listed in the sampling frame were not the beneficiaries' actual HIC numbers and did not comply with CMS guidelines governing the proper formatting of HIC numbers. According to plaintiff, if the beneficiaries' actual HIC numbers were used, the order of the sampling units-\n   <em>\n    i.e.\n   </em>\n   , the beneficiaries-would have been different in the sampling frame and thus application of the random numbers provided by CMS would have generated a sample different from the one selected by AdvanceMed. This argument is entirely unpersuasive. Plaintiff had sufficient documentation to replicate the sampling frame because it was provided with the exact sampling frame used by AdvanceMed. And plaintiff had sufficient records to replicate the sample because it had the exact random numbers and frame used by AdvanceMed and the actual sample AdvanceMed selected. Indeed, it was not necessary for plaintiff to create a new frame in which plaintiff replaced certain HIC numbers because it is undisputed that the HIC numbers in the frame served only as placeholders to identify the sample units (\n   <em>\n    i.e.\n   </em>\n   the beneficiaries) and that changing the HIC numbers did not impact the probability that any particular beneficiary would be randomly selected.\n   <footnotemark>\n    8\n   </footnotemark>\n   In short, it is immaterial that a few of the HIC numbers used in the frame did not match the beneficiaries' actual HIC numbers.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   Accordingly, plaintiff has cited no persuasive basis on which to call into question the MAC's conclusion that plaintiff was provided with sufficient documentation to replicate the frame and sample and to test the statistical validity of AdvanceMed's sampling methodology. The MAC thus sensibly and correctly denied plaintiff's claim that AdvanceMed's sampling and extrapolation results must be discarded for lack of documentation.\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Pruchniewski v.

In this respect, the MAC decision first explained that the ALJ had found that the March 12, 2010 visit to go over the home exercise program (\"HEP\") was not necessary and did not require the skills of an occupational therapist because C.A.'s therapist had already determined on March 9, 2010 that C.A. had met the goals of her therapy and was following the HEP. The decision next noted plaintiff's argument in response that the visit was necessary to give further instructions and perform a final assessment. The MAC then examined the medical records from each of C.A.'s occupational therapy visits, including clinical notes reflecting that C.A. had been instructed on the HEP on multiple visits and that as of March 9, 2010, C.A. was following the home exercise program and was benefitting from energy-conservation techniques. After reciting this evidence, the MAC decision stated that it agreed with the ALJ's determination that the occupational therapy service provided on March 12, 2010 was not necessary. It is clear from the MAC decision, then, that the MAC affirmed the ALJ's determination that the March 12, 2010 visit was unnecessary-and rejected plaintiff's argument to the contrary-because the record as a whole supported the ALJ's findings that C.A. had already met the goals of her therapy and was following the HEP on prior visits. Accordingly, the MAC's no-coverage determination with respect to C.A.'s March 12, 2010 visit satisfies the MAC's duty of explanation under the APA; a reviewing court \"can discern what the [MAC] did and why.\"\n   <em>\n    Piney Mountain\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11610989\" index=\"44\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/176/753/\">\n    176 F.3d at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   762 n.10.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   B.\n   <em>\n    Beneficiary: D.B., Dates of Service: December 9. 2009 - February 26, 2010\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   Plaintiff argues that the MAC's determinations that there was no Medicare coverage for the nursing, occupational therapy, and physical therapy services provided to D.B. must be set aside because the MAC did not give a sufficient explanation for its determinations and because those determinations are not supported by substantial evidence.\n   <footnotemark>\n    10\n   </footnotemark>\n   A review of the MAC's decision demonstrates that the MAC sufficiently explained the reasoning for its determinations of no-coverage and that such determinations are supported by substantial evidence in the record.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-50\">\n   First, the MAC adequately explained that the nursing services provided to D.B. during the period at issue were not covered by Medicare because D.B. did not require skilled nursing services for purposes of observing or assessing D.B. Earlier in its decision, the MAC stated that the Medicare Benefits Policy Manual Ch. 7 (\"MBPM\") \u00a7 40.1.2.1 provides that observation and assessment of a patient by a nurse are necessary when the likelihood of change in a patient's condition requires skilled nursing personnel to evaluate the patient's need for modification of treatment until the patient's treatment regimen is stabilized. Thus, it is clear that the MAC's analysis of the necessity of D.B.'s assessment and observation services was focused on whether the record evidence reflected a sufficient likelihood of change in D.B.'s respiratory condition to warrant such services. In this respect, the MAC decision reviewed the record evidence and noted that prior to the commencement of the services at issue, D.B.'s vitals were within normal limits, her respiratory system and skin were normal, and she was alert. The MAC also acknowledged the evidence emphasized by plaintiff, namely documentation of fluctuations in D.B.'s blood pressure readings and pain levels and a change in medication. The MAC's review of this evidence makes clear that the MAC determined that the record evidence, as a whole, did not show that there was a sufficient likelihood of change in D.B.'s condition to create a necessity for observation and assessment services by a skilled nurse. Accordingly, the MAC's no-coverage determination with respect to D.B.'s observation and assessment services satisfies the MAC's duty of explanation under the APA.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-51\">\n   In addition, the MAC's determination that there was an insufficient likelihood of change in D.B.'s condition to justify observation and assessment services by a nurse is supported by substantial evidence in the record. As noted above, the record evidence reflects that before the observation and assessment services at issue were provided, D.B.'s vitals were within normal limits, her respiratory system and skin were normal, and she was alert. This evidence satisfies the substantial evidence standard because it is certainly sufficient to allow \"a reasonable mind [to] accept as adequate to support [the] conclusion\" that there was an insubstantial likelihood that D.B.'s respiratory condition would change.\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Pierce\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1775136\" index=\"45\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/487/552/#p565\">\n    487 U.S. at 565\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1775136\" index=\"46\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/487/552/#p565\">\n    108 S.Ct. 2541\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . It is true, as plaintiff points out, that the record also contains evidence that during this time, D.B.'s blood pressure readings and pain levels fluctuated and that D.B.'s medication changed.\n   <footnotemark>\n    11\n   </footnotemark>\n   But it is well-settled that \"[t]he duty to resolve\n   conflicts in the evidence rests with the [agency], not with a reviewing court.\"\n   <em>\n    Smith v.

Accordingly, the MAC's determination that there was an insufficient likelihood of change in D.B.'s condition to justify observation and assessment services by a nurse is supported by substantial evidence in the record.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-52\">\n   The MAC also determined that the occupational therapy and physical therapy services provided to D.B. during the period at issue were not covered by Medicare because there was no reasonable expectation of material improvement in a reasonable and predictable period of time, as is required for Medicare coverage.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   MBPM \u00a7 40.2.1. In its decision, the MAC discussed evidence of multiple occasions on which D.B. expressed a persistent lack of desire to participate in therapy and refused to perform exercises. Thus, the MAC's decision passes muster under the APA because it adequately explained that the determination that it was not reasonable to expect that the therapy services at issue would result in improvement was based on evidence that D.B. lacked a desire to participate in therapy and because that determination is supported by substantial evidence in the record.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-53\">\n   C.\n   <em>\n    Beneficiary: M.G., Dates of Service: September 11, 2009 - November 11, 2009\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-54\">\n   Plaintiff argues that the MAC's determinations that there was no Medicare coverage for the services provided to M.G. must be set aside because the MAC's decision is not supported by substantial evidence in the record.

Plaintiff argues that this factual determination is incorrect because the record evidence contains a copy of the plan of care that is countersigned by a physician and an affidavit from the physician explaining that she co-signed the plan of care along with the nurse practitioner. In response, defendant argues that even if the copy of the plan identified by plaintiff undermines the evidentiary basis for the MAC's finding that the plan was not signed by a physician, substantial evidence nonetheless exists to support the MAC's alternative determination that the plan failed to comply with \u00a7 409.43(e) because the physician did not review the plan every 60 days.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-56\">\n   Defendant's argument is correct; although the MAC's decision was not \"a model of analytical precision,\" it does appear\n   that the MAC concluded that M.G.'s plan of care failed to comply with the 60-day review requirement of \u00a7 409.43(e) and that this conclusion is supported by substantial evidence in the record.\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Inova Alexandria Hosp. v.

Review of the administrative record reflects that the ALJ clearly determined that M.G.'s plan of care was defective under \u00a7 409.43(e) because the plan had not been reviewed every 60 days. As the ALJ explained, this finding was based on the fact that the physician's signature on the plan was dated November 20, 2009, more than 60 days after the commencement of the home health services described in the plan. On appeal, the MAC squarely rejected plaintiff's argument that the ALJ's decision concerning the 60-day review requirement was based on an inapplicable regulation that post-dated M.G.'s plan of care. Thus, it is reasonably discernable that the MAC decision adopted the ALJ's conclusion that the plan of care failed to comply with the 60-day review requirement of \u00a7 409.43 based on the MAC's approval of the ALJ's reasoning on this ground.\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Int'l Rehab.

Accordingly, even if the MAC's finding that M.G.'s plan of care was not signed by a physician is unsupported by substantial evidence, reversal of the MAC's decision is not warranted because substantial evidence exists to support the MAC's alternative finding that the plan failed to comply with the 60-day review requirement of \u00a7 409.43(e).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-58\">\n   D.\n   <em>\n    Beneficiary: J.H., Dates of Service: April 25, 2010 - May 26, 2010\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-59\">\n   Plaintiff argues that the MAC's determination that there was no Medicare coverage for the physical therapy services provided to J.F. must be set aside because the MAC's decision is not supported by substantial evidence in the record. A review of the record demonstrates that the MAC's determination of no-coverage is supported by substantial evidence.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-60\">\n   The MAC determined that the physical therapy services provided to treat J.H.'s back pain were not eligible for Medicare coverage because the documentation in the record was inadequate to demonstrate that such services were reasonable or necessary. This conclusion is supported by the substantial record evidence cited in the MAC decision. In this regard, the MAC first observed that J.H.'s documentation did not provide (i) a detailed initial evaluation, (ii) a clear comparison between J.H.'s prior level of functioning and his current level of functioning, or (iii) the goals of therapy. Next, the MAC noted that multiple medical reports reported that J.H. had no back pain and that his reports of pain levels of 4 or 5 out of 10 on other occasions were unreliable because J.H.'s cognitive impairments made it difficult for him to use a numerical score system. Based on this evidence, the MAC reasonably concluded that the record evidence on the whole did not reflect that the physical therapy services provided to J.H. were\n   medically reasonable or necessary to treat J.H.'s back pain.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-61\">\n   E.\n   <em>\n    Beneficiary: R.H., Dates of Service: November 17, 2007 - January 15, 2008\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-62\">\n   Plaintiff argues that the MAC's determination that there was no Medicare coverage for the first period of skilled nursing services provided to R.H. must be set aside because the MAC did not give a sufficient explanation for its determination and because that determination is not supported by substantial evidence. A review of the record demonstrates that that the MAC sufficiently explained the reasoning for its determination of no-coverage and that the determination is supported by substantial evidence in the record.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-63\">\n   The MAC concluded that the skilled nursing services provided to R.H. were not necessary for purposes of observation and assessment of R.H.'s condition. As explained in the MAC decision, this conclusion was based on the fact that the records of nursing visits did not reflect a sufficient likelihood of change in R.H.'s condition to warrant evaluation by skilled nursing personnel, as is required for Medicare coverage under MBPM \u00a7 40.1.2.1. Thus, the MAC adequately explained that its no-coverage determination was based on a finding that on the whole the record evidence did not show that there was a sufficient likelihood of change in R.H.'s condition to create a necessity for observation and assessment services by a skilled nurse.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-64\">\n   In addition, the records of nursing visits referenced by the MAC decision reflect that there is substantial evidence to support MAC's determination that there was an insufficient likelihood of change in R.H.'s condition to warrant observation and assessment by a skilled nurse. Prior to the commencement of the services at issue, only one record reflects a change in R.H.'s breathing, weight, and lab results, whereas the remaining nursing visit records reflect that such conditions remained constant. In addition, the nursing records reflect that R.H.'s primary diagnosis of edema persisted throughout the period at issue, as did the use of Lasix to treat R.H.'s edema. It does appear that the nursing notes reflect a greater degree of fluctuation in R.H.'s blood pressure. Yet, in light of the various other indicators of consistency in R.H.'s condition discussed above, the changes in R.H.'s blood pressure readings do not undermine the MAC's conclusion that the record on the whole reflected that observation and assessment were not necessary. Accordingly, the nursing notes cited by the MAC decision constitute substantial evidence to support the MAC's determination that the record disclosed insufficient complications in R.H.'s condition to warrant the provision of observation and assessment services by a skilled nurse.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-65\">\n   F.\n   <em>\n    Beneficiary: R.H., Dates of Service: January 16, 2008 - March 15, 2008\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-66\">\n   Plaintiff argues that the MAC's determination that there was no Medicare coverage for the second period of skilled nursing services provided to R.H. must be set aside because the MAC's determination is not supported by substantial evidence in the record.

Although the physician prescribed two new medications to treat R.H.'s high blood pressure and pain, the nursing report documenting those new prescriptions also noted that R.H.'s daughter would assume primary responsibility over R.H.'s medications. Accordingly, the nursing notes cited by the MAC decision-with respect to both the first and second periods of R.H.'s nursing care-constitute substantial evidence to support the MAC's determination that the record disclosed insufficient complications in R.H.'s condition to warrant the provision of observation and assessment services by a skilled nurse.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-68\">\n   G.\n   <em>\n    Beneficiary: C.S., Dates of Service: March 16, 2010 - May 14, 2010\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-69\">\n   Plaintiff argues that the MAC's determination that there was no Medicare coverage for the various services provided to C.S. must be set aside because the MAC's reasoning marks an arbitrary departure from its decisions in previous cases and is not supported by substantial evidence in the record.

Plaintiff argues that the MAC's invalidation of the plan of care on this ground is an arbitrary departure from the agency's decision in\n   <em>\n    Landmark Home Health\n   </em>\n   , M-2009-1209 (H.H.S. February 19, 2010), which held that the physician's failure to date his signature on the plan of care did not invalidate the plan of care. Plaintiff's argument fails because the\n   <em>\n    Landmark\n   </em>\n   decision is factually distinguishable from C.S.'s case. In\n   <em>\n    Landmark\n   </em>\n   , the MAC concluded that it was not necessary for the physician to date his signature because the plan of care bore a handwritten date in block 24, \"Date [Home Health Agency] Received Signed [Plan of Treatment].\"\n   <em>\n    Landmark\n   </em>\n   at *5. This was so, the MAC explained, because the presence of the handwritten date in block 24 provided a clear indication of the date that the plan of care was reviewed by the physician, in satisfaction of the requirement in \u00a7 409.43 that each review of the plan of care must contain the date of review. Here, the plan of care for C.S.'s services is not dated by the physician and bears only a facsimile header that indicates the date it was returned from the physician's office. Unlike the handwritten date on the plan of care in\n   <em>\n    Landmark\n   </em>\n   , the facsimile header on C.S.'s plan of care does not clearly reflect the date that the physician reviewed the plan; it indicates only the date on which the plan of care was faxed by the physician's office. Thus, the MAC's determination that the\n   physician's failure to mark the date on which he reviewed C.S.'s plan of care renders the plan of care deficient is contrary neither to \u00a7 409.43(c)(3) nor to the agency's prior application of that regulation in\n   <em>\n    Landmark.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-71\">\n   The second independent ground on which the MAC affirmed the ALJ's no-coverage determination was that the record did not demonstrate that C.S.'s home health services were reasonable or necessary during the period at issue. Plaintiff argues that this conclusion is not supported by substantial evidence. This argument fails because there is substantial evidence in the record to support the MAC's determination that there was not a sufficient change in C.S.'s condition to warrant the services provided during this period. Specifically, the record reflected that home health services had been resumed because of a stroke suffered by C.S. Yet, as the MAC noted, C.S.'s stroke had occurred seven months before the commencement of the services at issue, and during the interim C.S. had already been admitted to and discharged from home health services after the physician determined that C.S. had reached his maximum functional potential. Further, a doctor's assessment of C.S. noted that there was no significant change in C.S.'s condition since his last period of home health treatment, and other nursing records made during this period also observed that C.S.'s condition was stable. Thus, the MAC's determination that the home health services provided to C.S. during this period were not medically reasonable or necessary is supported by substantial evidence in the record, namely (i) that C.S. had already received and been discharged from home health services to treat the effects of his stroke and (ii) that C.S. did not exhibit a significant change in his condition since his discharge.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-72\">\n   H.\n   <em>\n    Beneficiary: J.S., Dates of Service: February 4, 2009 - April 3, 2009\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-73\">\n   Plaintiff argues that the MAC's determination that there was no Medicare coverage for the physical therapy services provided to J.S. must be set aside because the MAC's determination did not apply the correct legal standard. A review of the MAC decision demonstrates that that the MAC's no-coverage determination applied the correct legal standard in assessing whether the physical therapy services were covered by Medicare.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-74\">\n   The MAC concluded that the record did not support the need for physical therapy services because the plan of care did not document J.S.'s prior level of function or the goals of therapy in terms of objective measurements and because multiple physical therapy evaluations failed to reflect any objective tests or measurements relating to J.S.'s functional status or treatment goals.\n   <footnotemark>\n    13\n   </footnotemark>\n   In reaching this conclusion, the MAC explained that MBPM \u00a7 40.2.2.A provides that skilled physical therapy assessment services that are entitled to Medicare coverage include \"objective tests and measurements such as, but not limited to, range of motion, strength, balance, coordination, endurance, or functional ability.\" The MAC decision then observed that the majority of the physical therapy records did not reflect any objective tests or measurements relating to J.S.'s functional status or treatment goals. Thus, the MAC concluded that, pursuant to MBPM \u00a7 40.2.2.A, the physical therapy assessment services provided to J.S. did not\n   consist of objective tests and measurements and were thus not covered by Medicare.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-75\">\n   A plain reading of MBPM \u00a7 40.2.2.A confirms that the MAC correctly applied the regulation in evaluating whether the treatment goals and services provided to J.S. consisted of objective tests and measurements.\n   <em>\n    See\n    <extracted-citation index=\"53\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%20409.43\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   (\"Skilled rehabilitation services concurrent with the management of a patient's care plan\n   <em>\n    include objective tests and measurements\n   </em>\n   such as, but not limited to, range of motion, strength, balance, coordination, endurance, or functional ability.\") (emphasis added).

Plaintiff has cited no persuasive basis on which to conclude that MAC's application of MBPM \u00a7 40.2.2.A here is inconsistent with the regulation.

A review of the record demonstrates that that the MAC's no-coverage determination is supported by substantial evidence.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-78\">\n   The physical therapy visit at issue consisted of assessing R.S.'s lymphedema, educating R.S. about her disease process, and educating nursing staff about multi-layer bandaging for lymphedema management. The MAC concluded that the physical therapy visit was not covered by Medicare on two grounds, each of which is supported by substantial evidence. First, the MAC affirmed the ALJ's finding that the physical therapy services were not reasonable or necessary because they were duplicative of the skilled nursing services provided to R.S. during the period at issue. In this respect, the record reflects that R.S. also received skilled nursing services that included providing wound care, assessing R.S.'s lymphedema, applying compression foot and leg wraps, and educating R.S. about the signs and symptoms of infection, which were all covered by Medicare. This evidence amply supports the MAC's finding that the physical therapy services provided to R.S.-namely, assessing R.S.'s lymphedema and educating R.S. about her disease process-were duplicative of the skilled nursing services already being provided to R.S.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-79\">\n   Second, the MAC concluded that the physical therapy service consisting of educating nursing staff about multi-layer bandaging for lymphedema management was not covered by Medicare because MBPM \u00a7 40.2.1(d) excludes coverage for therapy visits \"solely to train other [staff].\" As the record evidence discussed above makes clear, all of the other physical therapy services provided to R.S. were duplicative and thus not covered by Medicare. Thus, the MAC was correct to determine that MBPM \u00a7 40.2.1(d) precluded coverage when the only non-duplicative, potentially coverable service provided in the physical therapy visit was to teach the nursing staff how to control and bandage lymphedema.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-80\">\n   J.\n   <em>\n    Beneficiary: R.S., Dates of Service: October 10, 2009 - December 8, 2009\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-81\">\n   Plaintiff argues that the MAC's determination that there was no Medicare coverage for the occupational therapy services provided to R.S. must be set aside because the MAC's determination applied incorrect legal principles. A review of the MAC decision demonstrates that that the MAC's no-coverage determination applied the correct legal principles.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-82\">\n   The MAC concluded that the occupational therapy services related to increasing R.S.'s arm strength were not covered by Medicare because such services were not medically reasonable or necessary. In reaching this conclusion, the MAC explained that MBPM \u00a7 40.2.4.1 provides that occupational therapy services are entitled to coverage only when such services are reasonable and necessary \"because of the patient's condition.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    14\n   </footnotemark>\n   The MAC decision then observed that the goals of R.S.'s occupational therapy included strengthening R.S.'s arms to an objective measurement of 3/5, yet none of the notes from R.S.'s treatment included any measurements of R.S.'s arm strength. Thus, the MAC concluded that the record was insufficient to show that the occupational therapy services were reasonably tailored to treat the deficit in R.S.'s arm strength, as is required for coverage under MBPM \u00a7 40.2.4.1.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   MBPM \u00a7 40.2.4.1 (providing that \"the skills of an occupational therapist to ... implement an occupational therapy program are covered when they are reasonable and necessary because of the patient's condition\"). Plaintiff has cited no persuasive ground on which to conclude that the MAC improperly applied MBPM \u00a7 40.2.4.1 in determining that the treatment record was insufficient to show that the occupational therapy was reasonably designed to treat R.S.'s objectively measurable arm strength deficit.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-83\">\n   The MAC also found that the occupational therapy services related to increasing R.S.'s independence in activities of daily living were not covered by Medicare because such services were not reasonable or necessary. Plaintiff argues that the MAC improperly based its determination that the occupational therapy was not reasonable or necessary on the retrospective observation that R.S. did not demonstrate any improvement during the treatment. This argument fails; as the ALJ specifically concluded, and the MAC affirmed, the occupational therapy services related to increasing R.S.'s independence in activities of daily living were not reasonable or necessary because the record did not show that such services were provided with a reasonable expectation of improvement, as is required for coverage under MBPM \u00a7 40.2.1(d)(1). The MAC found that the reasonable expectation standard had not been met because the record reflected that the occupational therapy services remained repetitive despite a lack of improvement in R.S.'s condition. Thus, the MAC did not base its conclusion that the occupational therapy services were not medically reasonable or necessary solely on the fact that R.S. did not exhibit improved independence in activities of daily living. Rather, the MAC and the ALJ properly applied MBPM \u00a7 40.2.1(d)(1) and concluded that such services were not provided with a reasonable expectation of improvement based on the fact that the same, repetitive therapy continued to be provided despite a lack of improvement in the patient's condition.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-84\">\n   <strong>\n    VI.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-85\">\n   Plaintiff next argues that the MAC's conclusions that plaintiff is not entitled to a limitation of liability pursuant to 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1395pp or a waiver of recoupment pursuant to 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1395gg should be set aside because these determinations apply incorrect legal standards and are unsupported by substantial evidence. The MAC's liability determinations with respect to each of these statutes are examined separately below.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-86\">\n   <strong>\n    A.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-87\">\n   Section 1395pp of the Medicare Act provides that a healthcare provider is not liable for repaying Medicare payments for services that have been deemed not to be medically reasonable or necessary if the provider \"did not know, and could not reasonably have been expected to know, that payment would not be made.\" 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1395pp(a). The regulations further explain that \"[i]t is clear that the provider ... could have been expected to have known that the services were excluded from coverage on the basis of ... [i]ts receipt of CMS notices, including manual issuances, bulletins, or other written guides or directives.\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"58\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%20411.406\">\n    42 C.F.R. \u00a7 411.406\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (e) ;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   Medicare Claims Processing Manual (\"MCPM\") Ch. 30 \u00a7 40.1.2 (stating that \"[a] provider is always considered to have prior knowledge, and no Medicare payment will be made to any provider for any claim, if previous notification was given ... that the claim would be denied,\" including the forms of notification listed in\n   <extracted-citation index=\"59\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%20411.406\">\n    42 C.F.R. \u00a7 411.406\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ). In short, as courts have held, Medicare-certified providers can be expected to know that certain services are not covered by Medicare based on their \"constructive notice\" of the criteria for coverage in the Medicare regulations and manuals.\n   <footnotemark>\n    15\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-88\">\n   These principles confirm that the MAC's determination that plaintiff was not entitled to a limitation of liability under \u00a7 1395pp applied correct legal standards and is supported by substantial evidence. As the MAC decision observed, the MAC's determinations that certain services provided by plaintiff were not medically reasonable or necessary were each based on guidance from publicly available statutes, regulations, and CMS manual provisions that were in effect when plaintiff provided the services. Thus, it was reasonable for the MAC to conclude that plaintiff had constructive knowledge of the requirements for Medicare coverage on which the MAC relied and thus that plaintiff could have been expected to know that Medicare would not pay for the services that fell outside of the limitations on coverage reflected in those requirements.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-89\">\n   Seeking to avoid this conclusion, plaintiff argues that it could not have been expected to know that Medicare would not pay for the services at issue because it was not clear and obvious that Medicare did not cover those services. Put another way, plaintiff argues that the CMS guidance on which the MAC relied was not sufficiently clear to put plaintiff on notice that its Medicare claims would be denied. This argument fails; as courts have sensibly recognized,\n   the test advocated by plaintiff finds no support in the regulations, which state that providers are expected to know that certain services are not covered by Medicare based on their constructive notice of the criteria for coverage in the Medicare regulations and manuals.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.,\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Galindo v.

Tex. Sept. 28, 2018). Plaintiff cites no persuasive authority to support the proposition that the agency must make the demanding showing that the clarity of the Medicare guidance makes it obvious that certain services are not covered. To the contrary, what the regulations make clear and obvious is that a Medicare-certified provider's constructive notice of the criteria for coverage in Medicare guidance is sufficient to demonstrate that the provider \"could have been expected to have known that the services were excluded from coverage.\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"62\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%20411.406\">\n    42 C.F.R. \u00a7 411.406\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (e).\n   <footnotemark>\n    16\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-90\">\n   Accordingly, the MAC correctly determined that plaintiff is not entitled to a limitation of its liability to reimburse the sums paid to plaintiff by Medicare for services that the MAC determined were not medically reasonable and necessary under the Medicare statute and regulations.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-91\">\n   <strong>\n    B.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-92\">\n   Section 1395gg of the Medicare Act provides that the Secretary may waive recoupment where the provider was \"without fault\" when it received overpayment. 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1395gg(b).

MFMM Ch. 3 \u00a7 90.1(H). The MAC found that plaintiff was not entitled to a waiver of recoupment because plaintiff should have known that the services for which the MAC denied coverage were not covered by Medicare. For the reasons already stated,\n   <em>\n    supra\n   </em>\n   part VI.A, the MAC's determination that plaintiff should have known that the services at issue fell outside the requirements for Medicare coverage applied the correct legal standards and is supported by substantial evidence.\n   <footnotemark>\n    17\n   </footnotemark>\n   Accordingly, plaintiff is not\n   entitled to a waiver of recoupment for the sums paid to plaintiff by Medicare for services that the MAC determined were not covered by Medicare.\n   <footnotemark>\n    18\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-93\">\n   <strong>\n    VII.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-94\">\n   In sum, for the reasons stated above, the MAC's determination that plaintiff was overpaid for ineligible Medicare claims is in accordance with the law and supported by the record evidence, and it is neither arbitrary nor capricious.

These cases are therefore distinguishable and unpersuasive here. In sharp contrast with those cases, the Medicare rules on which the MAC relied to deny coverage here were in effect at the time that plaintiff provided the services at issue.
