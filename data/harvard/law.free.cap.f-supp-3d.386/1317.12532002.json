PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   On November 9, 2018, Plaintiffs filed a consumer class action complaint against Talking Rain, seeking damages and equitable relief for the alleged false and misleading labeling on Defendant's Sparkling Ice products. [Doc. No. 1, at \u00b6\u00b6 1-7.] The complaint alleges violations of California's False Advertising Law (\"FAL\") Business &amp; Professions Code \u00a7 17500,\n   <em>\n    et seq.\n   </em>\n   ; the Unfair Competition Law, Business &amp; Professions Code \u00a7 17200,\n   <em>\n    et seq.\n   </em>\n   (\"UCL\"); California's Consumers Legal Remedies Act, California Civil Code \u00a7 1750,\n   <em>\n    et seq.\n   </em>\n   (\"CLRA\"); fraud by omission; negligent misrepresentation; breach of express warranties; and breach of implied warranties.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   On January 28, 201, Plaintiffs filed the First Amended Complaint (\"FAC\"). [Doc. No. 12.] The FAC asserts FAL, UCL, CLRA, fraud by omission; negligent misrepresentation; breach of express warranties; and breach of implied warranties against Defendant for misrepresenting and misleading consumers regarding the Sparkling Ice beverages (the \"Products\").\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   [\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ] The FAC alleges that \"the Products are labeled as if they are flavored only with natural ingredients when they in fact contain an undisclosed artificial flavor, d-1-malic acid, in violation of state and federal law\", namely\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=21%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%20101.22\">\n    21 C.F.R. \u00a7 101.22\n   </extracted-citation>\n   which regulates the labelling of food containing artificial ingredients, and C.F.R. \u00a7 102.5 which provides food labels accurately identify and describe the basic nature of the food, its characterizing properties or ingredients. [\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 7.] Further, Plaintiffs contend they relied on the labeling and believed they were buying all-natural products with natural flavoring ingredients, instead of the artificially flavored sparkling water purchased. [\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 67.] Both Plaintiffs have purchased the beverages several times, most recently in 2018, with Augustine purchasing the Products at a Ralph's grocery store in San Diego, California and Garfinkel buying the Products at a Ralph's in West Hollywood, California.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   [\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6\u00b6 63, 65.] Had the Products not claimed to be naturally flavored, Plaintiffs allege that they would have not purchased them, or alternatively, had they known they were not free of artificial flavoring, they would not have purchased them at the premium price.

[\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 16.] In order to perpetuate the alleged misrepresentation, the label prominently displays a \"naturally flavored designation,\" and omits the legally required \"artificially flavored\" disclosure, yet an ingredient\n   identified on the back \"malic acid,\" is an artificial flavor. [\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6\u00b6 17-24.] Subsequent to purchasing the Products, Plaintiffs have tested the Products and confirmed the presence of artificial d-1 malic acid.
