Tostrud, United States District Court Judge\n  </author>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   This case is about insurance coverage for injuries from a dog bite. The answer to the coverage question depends on whether a term appearing in the relevant policy in bold text-\"\n   <strong>\n    insured\n   </strong>\n   \"-means the same thing or something different when it appears in the policy in plain text-\"insured.\" Plaintiff Auto-Owners Insurance Company says the word unambiguously has the same meaning regardless of whether it appears in bold or plain text and that, as a result, there is no coverage for dog-bite injuries sustained by intervenor defendant J.M. J.M. says the opposite, and she has intervened and moved to dismiss Auto-Owners' complaint under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 12(b)(6). J.M.'s motion will be granted because the Auto-Owners policy is at least ambiguous about whether it uses the word \"insured\" to mean different things depending on whether it appears in bold or regular text, and Minnesota law requires that ambiguity to be construed against Auto-Owners. Auto-Owners' complaint for declaratory relief based on its interpretation of the policy is therefore implausible.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   I\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   The facts of this case are few and straightforward. Defendants Laura and Frank Kammerer asked J.M. to care for their two dogs while the Kammerers were\n   away. Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 8-11 [ECF No. 1]. J.M. was caring for the dogs in the Kammerers' home on December 31, 2016, when one of them bit her multiple times, causing injuries.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 12-13. At that time, the Kammerers were covered under the Auto-Owners homeowners policy, and the policy provided personal-liability protection.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Ex. B (\"Policy\") at 9, 25-30 [ECF No. 1-2].\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   The Kammerers notified Auto-Owners of the incident on January 3, 2017. Compl. \u00b6 13;\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   Ex. A [ECF No. 1-1]. On April 26, 2018, J.M.'s attorney sent a demand letter to Auto-Owners.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 14. Auto-Owners sent the Kammerers a \"reservation-of-rights\" letter on June 28, 2018.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Ex. C [ECF No. 1-3]. In the letter, Auto-Owners wrote that it would defend the Kammerers against J.M.'s claims subject to a reservation of rights but added: \"Please be advised that the Auto-Owners Policy does not apply to '\n   <strong>\n    bodily injury\n   </strong>\n   or\n   <strong>\n    personal injury\n   </strong>\n   to any insured.'

It argues that the two explanatory sentences preceding the policy's definitions establish that it intended every use of the word \"insured\" in the policy to appear in bold text, that it \"simply chose to employ bold face type as a matter of courtesy and convenience\" to its policyholders, and that its failure to do so with respect to the intra-insured exclusion was a \"typographical error resulting in the omission of this courtesy bolding in one instance.\" Mem. in Opp'n at 6-9. Auto-Owners does not offer extrinsic evidence to substantiate these assertions. Its argument depends entirely on the policy and especially on the two sentences at the beginning of the\n   <strong>\n    DEFINITIONS\n   </strong>\n   section: \"To understand this policy,\n   <strong>\n    you\n   </strong>\n   must understand the meaning of the following words. These words appear in\n   <strong>\n    bold face type\n   </strong>\n   whenever used in this policy and endorsements attached to this policy.\" Policy at 14. Auto-Owners argues the policy's \"use of the singular phrase 'the meaning' ... indicates that each of the words to be defined below has a single meaning\" and that the wording of \"whenever used\" in the second sentence does not \"suggest that the meaning of each defined\n   word is contingent on the word appearing in bold face type.\" Mem. in Opp'n at 7.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   These arguments do not establish that Auto-Owners' interpretation is the only reasonable interpretation of the policy or, put another way, that the policy reasonably may be interpreted only to deny coverage for J.M.'s claim. Perhaps it would be reasonable to understand the phrase \"[t]hese words appear in\n   <strong>\n    bold face type\n   </strong>\n   whenever used in this policy\" to express an intent that each specially-defined word appear in \"\n   <strong>\n    bold face type\n   </strong>\n   ,\" Policy at 14, at all times in the policy. Perhaps some policyholders would conclude that words assigned special meaning in the\n   <strong>\n    DEFINITIONS\n   </strong>\n   section but appearing in plain text reflect typographical mistakes by Auto-Owners. Under this interpretation, a hypothetical policyholder might conclude that the word \"insured\" in the policy's intra-insured exclusion should be interpreted as if it appeared in bold text, and that would mean J.M.'s claim is not covered. That is not, however, the only reasonable interpretation of the phrase \"[t]hese words appear in\n   <strong>\n    bold face type\n   </strong>\n   whenever used in this policy.\" Policy at 14. The point of the two sentences preceding the\n   <strong>\n    DEFINITIONS\n   </strong>\n   is to alert policyholders to the fact that \"words appear[ing] in\n   <strong>\n    bold face type\n   </strong>\n   ,\" have special meaning.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4891637\" index=\"20\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/idaho/126/51/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   With that qualifier, a policyholder might reasonably think that the two sentences and the\n   <strong>\n    DEFINITIONS\n   </strong>\n   section as a whole do not say anything about the meaning of words not in bold text. Also, the word \"used\" in the second sentence need not-and really should not-be understood to mean \"appear.\" The words have different meanings. Relevant to interpreting the policy, \"use\" means \"[t]o put into service or apply for a purpose; employ.\"\n   <em>\n    The American Heritage Dictionary of the English Language\n   </em>\n   1894 (4th ed. 2000). \"Appear\" means \"[t]o become visible.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4891637\" index=\"21\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/idaho/126/51/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4891637\" index=\"21\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/idaho/126/51/\">\n    at 86\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . A reasonable policyholder would understand that Auto-Owners \"uses\" or \"employs\" words in bold text to denote specialized meaning. A reasonable policyholder would not necessarily anticipate that the mere appearance of the same words in plain text signals the same specialized usage.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   Some of Auto-Owners' arguments are not tenable. The policy says nothing to suggest that Auto-Owners' use of bold text is intended \"as a matter of courtesy and convenience.\"\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Mem. in Opp'n at 8. To the contrary, the first of the two sentences on which Auto-Owners relies reads as an imperative command: a policyholder \"must understand\" the meaning of words in \"\n   <strong>\n    bold face type\n   </strong>\n   \" to understand the policy. Policy at 14. Nor does the policy say anything about the possibility of typographical errors or how they are to be resolved.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   The point of Auto-Owners' assertion that the appearance of \"insured\" in plain text in the Kammerers' homeowners policy is \"one instance\" of a mistake is not clear. Mem. in Opp'n at 8. If Auto-Owners intends to refer to other policies, there is no evidence showing that similar policies that Auto-Owners issued to others do or do not contain the same asserted error. If Auto-Owners means to say that the word \"insured\" appears in plain text in only \"one instance\" in the Kammerers' policy, that is not correct. The term appears in plain text twice in the policy's declarations (albeit in capital letters), Policy at 9-10, and in definition seventeen,\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 16 (\"\n   <strong>\n    17. You\n   </strong>\n   or\n   <strong>\n    your\n   </strong>\n   means the first named insured shown in the Declarations and if an individual,\n   <strong>\n    your\n   </strong>\n   spouse who resides in the same household.\"). The fact that \"insured\" appears in the policy multiple times in plain text undermines Auto-Owners' argument that its appearance in plain text in the intra-insured exclusion was inadvertent.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   Auto-Owners also argues that \"Minnesota Law supports treating [J.M.] as an insured\n   or a keeper of the dogs under [the] circumstances\" of this case. Mem. in Opp'n at 9. To support this contention, Auto-Owners cites a Minnesota statute that imposes liability on dog owners for injuries caused by dogs.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   The statute reads:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-34\">\n   If a dog, without provocation, attacks or injures any person who is acting peaceably in any place where the person may lawfully be, the owner of the dog is liable in damages to the person so attacked or injured to the full amount of the injury sustained. The term \"owner\" includes any person harboring or keeping a dog but the owner shall be primarily liable. The term \"dog\" includes both male and female of the canine species.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   <extracted-citation index=\"22\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Minn.%20Stat.%20%C2%A7%20347.22\">\n    Minn. Stat. \u00a7 347.22\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . In the same section of its brief, Auto-Owners also cites two cases-one from the Court of Appeals of Wisconsin and the other from the Supreme Court of Nebraska-that Auto-Owners asserts \"persuasively found no coverage in factually similar situations.\" Mem. in Opp'n at 10-11.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   Neither the Minnesota statute nor the cases Auto-Owners cites justifies the conclusion that J.M. is an \"insured\" for purposes of the intra-insured exclusion. Auto-Owners is correct that J.M.'s acceptance of temporary responsibility for the care of the Kammerers' dogs would seem to justify a finding that she was \"harboring or keeping\" them within the meaning of\n   <extracted-citation index=\"23\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Minn.%20Stat.%20%C2%A7%20347.22\">\n    Minn.

App. 2005). But the statute doesn't say anything about insurance coverage. It is true, as a practical matter, that dog owners and others who harbor or keep dogs might be wise to purchase insurance coverage in view of the scope of liability created by the statute, but that observation says nothing about the scope of the policy's coverage in this case. The two cases Auto-Owners cites are also distinguishable. Though both cases address insurance coverage for dog-bite injuries sustained by dog-sitters, the policies at issue used \"\n   <strong>\n    insured\n   </strong>\n   \" in bold text in both their personal-liability coverage provisions and their intra-insured exclusions.\n   <em>\n    Van Kleek v.

And here, there can be no\n   doubt the Kammerers-and not J.M.-are the named insureds and policyholders. They applied for the insurance and paid the premium, or at least there is no suggestion otherwise. The first page of the policy's declarations names the Kammerers as \"INSURED.\" Policy at 9. On the second page of the declarations, only Laura Kammerer is named as \"INSURED.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 10. Either way, the declarations don't mention J.M.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   Auto-Owners identifies no unreasonable results that might flow from interpreting \"insured\" in the intra-insured exclusion differently from \"\n   <strong>\n    insured\n   </strong>\n   \" as it is defined and used elsewhere in the policy. This is not a case, then, where the \"obvious purpose of the contract as a whole\" shows that the ambiguity apparent from Auto-Owners use of bold and plain text is in fact nonexistent.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Miller v.

And it is not difficult to identify-at least hypothetically-a reason why Auto-Owners might purposefully have chosen not to subject an \"\n   <strong>\n    insured\n   </strong>\n   \" like J.M. to the intra-insured exclusion. The \"\n   <strong>\n    Personal Liability\n   </strong>\n   \" exclusion applicable to insureds has no limits. It does not say that its scope is coterminous with the provision making J.M. an \"\n   <strong>\n    insured\n   </strong>\n   \" while legally responsible for the Kammerers' dogs. In other words, if J.M. were an \"insured\" for purposes of the exclusion, then she would be excluded entirely from the Policy's coverage, certainly while engaged in the dog-sitting activities that made her an \"\n   <strong>\n    insured\n   </strong>\n   .\" Hypothetically, that would mean there would be no coverage if, for example, one of the Kammerers ran J.M. over with a car while she was caring for their dogs. It seems sensible that an insurer might intend to provide coverage in that kind of situation.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   D\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   To summarize, the word \"insured\" reasonably may be understood to have different meanings in the policy depending on whether the word appears in bold or plain text. For purposes of the policy's intra-insured exclusion specifically, \"insured\" reasonably may be understood not to refer to J.M. Auto-Owners' theory of the case-that the word unambiguously has the same meaning regardless of whether it appears in bold or plain text-is incorrect, and its complaint for declaratory relief based on its interpretation of the policy is therefore implausible and must be dismissed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   <strong>\n    ORDER\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   Based upon all of the files, records, and proceedings in the above-captioned matter,\n   <strong>\n    IT IS HEREBY ORDERED\n   </strong>\n   that:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-43\">\n   1.
