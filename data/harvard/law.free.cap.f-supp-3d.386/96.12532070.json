Regulatory Background\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   The City of Boston has traditionally regulated taxis under a set of municipal rules, ordinances and regulations (\"Taxi Rules\"), for which the Police Commissioner has the exclusive authority to regulate hackney carriages and hackney stands. In 2008, the Boston Police Department (\"BPD\") issued the Hackney Carriage Rules and Flat Rate Handbook (\"Rule 403\"), which regulates hackney carriage fares, medallions and hackney licenses, among other things. Rule 403 also incorporates a previously promulgated Vehicle for Hire Ordinance (\"the Boston Ordinance\"), which provides in relevant part:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-13\">\n   no person, firm, or corporation driving or having charge of a taxicab or other private vehicle shall offer the vehicle for hire for the purposes of transporting, soliciting and/or picking up a passenger or passengers unless said person is licensed as a hackney driver and said vehicle is licensed as a hackney carriage by the Police Commissioner.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   City of Boston Code 16-15.05: Vehicle for Hire Ordinance;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   Appendix I to Rule 403. The Hackney Department of the BPD is largely charged with implementing these Taxi Rules.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   <strong>\n    B. Factual Background\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   In June, 2013, following separate conversations between Uber management and the Hackney Department on the one hand, and Uber and senior staff in the Mayor's office on the other, Uber launched its own peer-to-peer (\"P2P\") application, UberX. With respect to UberX, Uber did not require its drivers to comply with Rule 403 or the Boston Ordinance because its management believed that the Taxi Rules applied only to taxi cabs, not transportation\n   network companies (\"TNCs\") such as Uber.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   Shortly thereafter, uniformed officers began ticketing Uber drivers for violating a variety of municipal and state regulations, including the Boston Ordinance. From roughly July, 2013, to January, 2015, Uber acknowledged hundreds of police citations issued to UberX drivers. Although some drivers successfully challenged those tickets in court, Uber routinely reimbursed all other charged drivers. During this same time period, while Uber reimbursed its drivers for the cost of tickets, the Mayor's office made somewhat contradictory statements suggesting that the Taxi Rules did not apply to TNCs.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   This regulatory uncertainty persisted until August, 2016, when the Massachusetts legislature enacted the Transportation Network Companies Act (\"the TNC Act\").\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   M.G.L. c. 159A \u00bd. The TNC Act preempts municipalities from regulating TNCs through local municipal rules and vests regulatory jurisdiction in the Massachusetts Department of Public Utilities and the Massachusetts Port Authority.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00a7 10.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   Following this Court's order which allowed, in part, and denied, in part, defendants' motion to dismiss (Docket No. 96), the parties submitted cross motions for summary judgment with respect to plaintiffs' claims for unfair competition from June, 2013, to August, 2016 (\"the alleged unlawful conduct period\"). Plaintiffs have moved for partial summary judgment on their claim of liability (under Chapter 93A and common law) and defendants' \u00a7 3 and superseding cause defenses. Defendants have moved for summary judgment on plaintiffs' claim of liability (under Chapter 93A and common law) and on its\n   <em>\n    res\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    judicata\n   </em>\n   and \u00a7 3 defenses.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   For the reasons set forth below, both parties' motions will be denied (with the exception of plaintiffs' motion for partial summary judgment on defendants' \u00a7 3 defense) and the Court will promptly convene a bench trial in accordance with this opinion.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   <strong>\n    II.\n    <em>\n     Legal Analysis\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   <strong>\n    A.

Egregiousness\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   With respect to the ultimate issue of whether Uber competed unfairly under Chapter 93A,\n   <em>\n    i.e.\n   </em>\n   , with \"egregiousness\" or \"rascality\" during the alleged unlawful conduct period, the parties have set forth compelling and competing narratives.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Baker\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Goldman, Sachs &amp; Co.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4291456\" index=\"20\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/771/37/#p51\">\n    771 F.3d 37\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 51 (1st Cir. 2014) (finding that plaintiffs must prove more than \"mere negligence\"; they must prove \"extreme or egregious\" negligence).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   On one hand, plaintiffs submit that Uber competed unfairly because it knowingly violated the Taxi Rules by launching UberX without appropriate hackney licenses and drivers (and thus was able to price out taxi cabs) and did so with a callous disregard for those rules and for the regulators who enforced them. Defendants respond that their strategy in entering the market under tacit regulatory approval was done in good faith and as a result of their inventive and disruptive competition. They buttress this argument by pointing to internal communications and public communications disseminated by City decision makers.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   After reviewing the totality of the evidence, this Court finds that Uber acted with reckless disregard for the City's Taxi Rules. They reimbursed their drivers for hundreds of tickets and told them that Uber was legal, despite acknowledging otherwise in private circles.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   The Court notes that it will consider ticket evidence in this case, notwithstanding a purportedly contrary decision of the Massachusetts Supreme Judicial Court (\"the SJC\") in\n   <em>\n    LePage\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Bumila\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3886939\" index=\"21\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/mass/407/163/\">\n    407 Mass. 163\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"22\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=552%20N.E.2d%2080\">\n    552 N.E.2d 80\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1990). In the\n   <em>\n    LePage\n   </em>\n   decision, the SJC held that the decision to pay a $40 traffic citation and to forgo a judicial appeal does not bear a sufficient relationship to whether the paying party acquiesces in or admits to the charges recited in the citation.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"23\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=552%20N.E.2d%2080\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"23\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=552%20N.E.2d%2080\">\n    at 82\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Here, the evidence that Uber paid off hundreds of tickets apparently is not intended to show that Uber in fact violated the rules but rather demonstrates that Uber was aware that the Hackney Department and the Police Commissioner were enforcing the rules against TNCs and that Uber, nevertheless, disregarded that enforcement.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   Moreover, Uber avoided the costs of complying with those regulations and capitalized on the lack of enforcement by engaging in \"surge pricing\". In sum, there is no good faith dispute that Uber violated the Taxi Rules.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   Uber's violation of the Taxi Rules is, however, neither necessary nor sufficient to prove a Chapter 93A claim.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Massachusetts Eye &amp; Ear Infirmary\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    QLT Phototherapeutics, Inc.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4011864\" index=\"24\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/552/47/#p69\">\n    552 F.3d 47\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 69 (1st Cir. 2009). Rather, the guiding principle is whether Uber's actions would, under the totality of the circumstances,\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-49\">\n   raise an eyebrow of someone inured to the rough and tumble of the world of commerce.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-50\">\n   <em>\n    Levings\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Forbes &amp; Wallace, Inc.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3960002\" index=\"25\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/mass-app-ct/8/498/\">\n    8 Mass.App.Ct. 498\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"26\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=396%20N.E.2d%20149\">\n    396 N.E.2d 149\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1979) (Kass, J.).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-51\">\n   Under this standard, the Court reserves its finding of liability because Uber has proffered some evidence that management acted in good faith when it relied on statements made by City decision makers during the alleged unlawful conduct period. Thus, because neither party has demonstrated as a matter of law that Uber did or did not act egregiously, the cross motions for summary judgment on Chapter 93A liability will be denied.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-52\">\n   <strong>\n    c. Actual Damages\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-53\">\n   Next, defendants argue that plaintiffs cannot establish actual damages because 1) they have no protectable property interest in the book value of taxi medallions, 2) even if taxi medallions are \"financial assets\", only those plaintiffs who suffered an actual loss can recover and 3) purely economic damages are not recoverable under Chapter 93A.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-54\">\n   Under \u00a7 11, plaintiffs must establish a \"loss of money or property\" resulting from defendants' unfair practices or competition. M.G.L. c. 93A, \u00a7 11. Here, the Court finds that plaintiffs have demonstrated actual economic damages (not property damages) sufficient to survive summary judgment for the following reasons.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-55\">\n   First, while plaintiffs likely have a property interest in the medallions themselves, they do not have a property interest in the diminishing value of those medallions.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Bos.

Plaintiffs' claims of reduced medallion value represent alleged economic injury, not a loss of property under Chapter 93A.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-56\">\n   Next, the Court finds defendants' Rule 10b-5 analysis with respect to financial assets to be instructive but ultimately unpersuasive. The more vigorous causation requirement in Rule 10b-5 cases is rooted in the concept that a stock can recover in price, even after the unlawful conduct has subsided, and thus any unrealized loss (\n   <em>\n    i.e.\n   </em>\n   , from not selling the stock) is speculative.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Blue Chip Stamps\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Manor Drug Stores\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"541651\" index=\"28\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/421/723/#p734\">\n    421 U.S. 723\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 734-35,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"541651\" index=\"29\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/421/723/#p734\">\n    95 S.Ct. 1917\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"541651\" index=\"30\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/421/723/#p734\">\n    44 L.Ed.2d 539\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1975). Here, the experts agree that the structural change in the transportation-for-hire market is permanent and thus the depression in medallion values is not temporary or even speculative. Accordingly, the Court finds that the plaintiffs may recover for any loss of value proven during the alleged unlawful conduct period.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-57\">\n   Finally, this Court agrees with plaintiffs that economic damages are recoverable under M.G.L. c. 93A, \u00a7 11.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Cummings\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    HPG Int'l, Inc.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11116695\" index=\"31\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/244/16/#p26\">\n    244 F.3d 16\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 26, n.3 (1st Cir. 2001).

In\n   <em>\n    Canal\n   </em>\n   , the First Circuit rejected a third-party consumers' Chapter 93A claim because their alleged harm flowed from defendants' negligence with respect to the plaintiff, not the third-party consumers.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"10518403\" index=\"33\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/973/988/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"10518403\" index=\"33\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/973/988/\">\n    at 998-99\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Not only is that case factually distinguishable in that the third-party harm stemmed from a contractual relationship (not present here), but plaintiffs in this case have alleged that Uber acted egregiously in disregarding applicable Taxi Rules. Thus, Uber's claim for an economic recovery bar under \u00a7 11 is unavailing.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-58\">\n   <strong>\n    2.

This Court disagrees because, first, there is a dispute over when the alleged injury occurred and thus when the action accrued (\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Epstein\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    C.R.

In\n   <em>\n    O'Hara\n   </em>\n   , the Court found that the federal regulation explicitly gave the regulating entity authority to determine that the consumer label is not deceptive, which was the subject of the Chapter 93A claim.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12524854\" index=\"42\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/306/441/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12524854\" index=\"42\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/306/441/\">\n    at 455\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

Nor can Uber plausibly rely on arguments set forth in its motion to dismiss in a preceding action that was filed during the tenure of Commissioner Evans. That motion to dismiss was filed in May, 2015, and suggests that whether Rule 403 applies to TNCs is \"at best, open to interpretation\". Nothing about those limited statements constitutes an affirmative safe harbor exemption as a matter of law.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-76\">\n   <strong>\n    i. Misplaced Reliance on Caselaw\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-77\">\n   First, the new testimony of Commissioner Davis does not bear upon this Court's prior ruling with respect to the deference doctrine set forth in\n   <em>\n    Dial A Car, Inc.\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Transportation, Inc.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7641546,3693236\" index=\"47\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/82/484/\">\n    82 F.3d 484\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (D.C.

Not only is the Court's justification for abstention in that case rooted in federalism concerns, which do not apply here, but also the subject Taxi Rules here are \"so clear on [their] face that no good faith doubt concerning [their] interpretation\" is possible.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7641546,3693236\" index=\"48\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/82/484/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   at 489 n.3. As such, defendants' safe harbor claim rises and falls with their contention that government officials gave affirmative permission to launch\n   <em>\n    during\n   </em>\n   the alleged unlawful conduct period.

In\n   <em>\n    O'Hara\n   </em>\n   , the regulating entity certified that the label of a particular product did not violate federal law, and thus, the Court found that plaintiffs could not subsequently claim that those approved labels were deceptive under Chapter 93A.\n   <em>\n    O'Hara\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12524854\" index=\"49\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/306/441/\">\n    306 F.

To be clear, this Court is not suggesting that formal rulemaking is required to satisfy \u00a7 3, but alleged oral statements by a Commissioner after-the-fact or limited arguments in a motion to dismiss do not rise to the level of particularized approval.\n   <em>\n    Cf.\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12524854\" index=\"50\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/306/441/\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12524854\" index=\"50\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/306/441/\">\n    at 465\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-79\">\n   Moreover,\n   <em>\n    Dorrian\n   </em>\n   is factually distinguishable because, in that case, prior to the alleged unfair conduct, the regulating agency issued written advisory opinions and amendments to regulations concluding that the defendants did not need a license to conduct business.\n   <em>\n    Dorrian\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    LVNV Funding, LLC\n   </em>\n   , No. SUCV142684BLS2,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"51\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2017%20WL%202218773\">\n    2017 WL 2218773\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *13 (Mass.

Superseding Cause\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-82\">\n   Plaintiffs argue that the TNC Act is not a superseding cause of their damages because the enactment of that statute was reasonably foreseeable and was not independent from Uber's conduct (\n   <em>\n    i.e.\n   </em>\n   , Uber leveraged its drivers and riders to lobby the Massachusetts legislature).

They have failed, however, to demonstrate conclusively that the TNC Act is not a superseding cause.
