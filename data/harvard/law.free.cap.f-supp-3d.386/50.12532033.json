A hapless tourist who enters through the employees' door may be ejected from a museum, even if he were otherwise entitled to be there. Similarly, a plaintiff who comes into federal court through the federal removal process may find his case thrown out, even if it could have properly arrived there another way. Such is the plight of Melvin Williams, who sued the U.S. Department of Agriculture in the Superior Court of the District of Columbia, alleging the Department discriminated and retaliated against him based on his disability. The Department's conduct, he contends, violated the Rehabilitation Act of 1973,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=29%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20701\">\n    29 U.S.C. \u00a7 701\n   </extracted-citation>\n   <em>\n    et seq.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   The Department, as a federal defendant, exercised its right to remove the case to federal court.

Superior Court case, rendering that pleading a nullity.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 4. Not so. The Court merely summarized Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 8(a), which describes the requirements of complaints before federal courts.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   ECF No. 11 at 1. It made no determination about the validity of a pleading filed in the Superior Court. Indeed, the Court lacks jurisdiction to do so.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   Mr. Williams urges that, in ordering a more definite statement of his allegations, the Court \"employed a repleading procedure specifically contemplated and authorized by Fed. R. Civ. P. 81(a).\" Pl.'s Opp. at 4. But again, Mr. Williams misreads the Court's Order, which simply granted the Department's motion for a more definite statement. That motion, and the Court's Order, concerned Rule 8 and not Rule 81(a).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   Next, Mr. Williams correctly observes that a party seeking removal from state court bears the burden of showing that jurisdiction exists in federal court.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 5. If this Court lacks jurisdiction, he contends, then the Department failed to meet its removal burden and the \"threshold jurisdictional dispute should have played out in the D.C. court.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Perhaps. But whether removal was proper does not affect the scope of this Court's jurisdiction. And even if the Court agreed with Mr. Williams, the appropriate remedy would be to remand the case to the Superior Court. On remand, of course, the Superior Court would be compelled to dismiss the case for lack of jurisdiction. This argument thus fails ameliorate Mr. Williams's predicament.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   Lastly, Mr. Williams argues that the Department could have sought removal under either\n   <extracted-citation index=\"43\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201441\">\n    28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1441\n   </extracted-citation>\n   or \u00a7 1442. When a case is removed under Section 1441, a federal court may hear a claim over which it would have had original jurisdiction, even if the state court lacked jurisdiction over the claim.\n   <extracted-citation index=\"44\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201441\">\n    28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1441\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (f). By contrast, removals under Section 1442 are subject to the derivative jurisdiction requirements discussed above. Mr. Williams suggests that the choice to remove the case under Section 1442 \"suggests that the Government has been stringing the plaintiff and the Court along in order to seek this particular litigation advantage.\" Pl.'s Opp. at 7.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   But Section 1442 is the proper removal mechanism for federal defendants. By its plain terms, it applies to the \"United States or any agency thereof,\" or \"any officer\" of a federal agency.\n   <extracted-citation index=\"45\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201442\">\n    28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1442\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a)(1). The Court sees no evidence of an improper motive here. And, even if it did, it lacks the power to expand its subject matter jurisdiction to address such a motive.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   Underlying Mr. Williams's arguments is a mistaken belief that the Court may expand its subject matter jurisdiction. True, the Court construes\n   <em>\n    pro se\n   </em>\n   filings liberally.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Richardson v. United States\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3671446,11563247\" index=\"46\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/193/545/\">\n    193 F.3d 545\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 548 (D.C. Cir. 1999). And it is mindful of the costs and burdens of re-filing a new case in federal court. But the jurisdiction of federal courts is limited and \"is not to be expanded by judicial decree.\"\n   <em>\n    Kokkonen\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1147542\" index=\"47\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/511/375/#p377\">\n    511 U.S. at 377\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1147542\" index=\"48\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/511/375/#p377\">\n    114 S.Ct. 1673\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Thus, because the Superior Court lacked\n   jurisdiction to hear Mr. Williams's claims, the Court cannot derive removal jurisdiction over these claims under\n   <extracted-citation index=\"49\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201442\">\n    28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1442\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a).
