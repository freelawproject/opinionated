FACTUAL BACKGROUND\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   The following facts are undisputed, except where noted. There are approximately 80 individual Plaintiffs in this case as special investigators employed by Farmers, comprised of approximately 40 named Plaintiffs and Opt-In Plaintiffs (members of the FLSA collective) and 57 Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 23 California-based class members, 17 of whom are also Opt-In Plaintiffs (collectively, \"Plaintiffs\"). Defendant Farmers Insurance Exchange (\"Farmers\" or \"FIE\") is an inter-insurance exchange that sells homeowners insurance, auto insurance, commercial insurance, and financial services throughout the United States. Am. Compl., \u00b6 9; Am. Answer, \u00b6\u00b6 9, 10. Farmers is the only entity that employed special investigators, including all Plaintiffs and absent class members. Gendell Decl., \u00b6\u00b6 5-6 (Head Human Resources Business Partner-Claims for\n   Farmers Group, Inc.); Ex. 8, Masuen Dep. at 37:11-16; Ex. 15, Serafin Dep. at 121:25-122:16.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   <strong>\n    A. Special Investigations Unit's Purpose and Structure\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   Farmers' Special Investigations Unit (\"SIU\") provides investigatory services to Farmers' Claims Organization (\"Claims\") when fraud is suspected in the submission of any insurance claim. Ex. 18, Wedding\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   Decl., \u00b6 2. SIU's purpose is to \"educate, identify, detect, [and] resist fraudulent payments, or attempts to defraud the company through the insurance claims process.\" Ex. 15, Serafin\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   Dep. at 123:5-8. SIU's \"calculated impact\" in deterring fraud is valued at approximately $50-60 million per year while it operates on a budget of approximately $28 million. Ex. 15, Serafin Dep. at 124:11-17.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   In the SIU hierarchy of employees, special investigators are at the lowest level. Ex. 31, Wedding Depo. at 41:19-25. Special investigators report to SIU Managers (\"SIMs\")\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   (5-7 in each zone), who report to five Zone Managers, who report to the SIU Director. Ex. 31, Wedding Dep. at 39:18-25. The five zones are: east, central, west, centralized support, and national.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Cal.%20Code%20%C2%A7%20226\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Cal.%20Code%20%C2%A7%20226\">\n    at 40:19-21\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . According to Plaintiffs, the special investigators in this case are or were in the east, central, and west zones. Special investigators are salaried employees and, during the relevant period, no special investigator employed by Farmers in California made less than $49,920 per year and some made more than $100,000 annually. Rupert\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   Decl., \u00b6 5, Ex. 2; Francis Dep. at 96:15-20 (salary of approximately $110,000 when he left Farmers). Some Plaintiffs testified that they understood at the time they were hired that the special investigator position was overtime exempt and that they would be paid the same salary regardless of the number of hours worked. Ex. 7, Grimes Dep. at 32:16-20, 33:2-8, 35:11-21, 155:5-8; Ex. 6, Reyes Dep. at 32:7-11, 37:7-21; Ex. 4, Daszko Dep. at 51:15-18, 56:19-57:2; Ex. 21, Hsieh\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   Decl., \u00b6 3.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   Out of the millions of claims for insurance benefits filed by Farmers' insureds every year, approximately 2% of those claims are referred to SIU for investigation. Ex. 15, Serafin Dep. at 122:17-123:1. The role of special investigators is to \"investigate potentially fraudulent claims, resolve indicators of fraud, and to help Farmers from paying out on illegitimate claims.\" Ex. 19, Bear\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n   Decl., \u00b6 5. They \"conduct investigations into those claims, they resolve the indicators and then they report their findings to the CR [claims representative] for them to make a decision.\" Ex. 24, Martinez Dep. at 34:9-11. Sometimes the insurance claims they investigate\n   involve millions of dollars. Ex. 7, Grimes Dep. at 72:12-22 (worked several claims exceeding $1 million); Ex. 4, Daszko Dep. at 145:19-146:3 (investigated $2.5 million property claim involving stolen microchips). Special investigators are expected to collaborate with their \"customers,\" the claims representatives. Ex. 28, Page\n   <footnotemark>\n    7\n   </footnotemark>\n   Dep. at 18:12-17. Several Farmers employees testified that investigating claims is the special investigators' main responsibility. Ex. 28, Page Dep. at 18:12-19:1 (\"their primary role is to investigate claims or indicators of fraud that might be present, and they are collaborative with our claims partners\"); Ex. 30, Serafin Dep. at 74:20-22 (\"I think investigating is a critical core piece of what an investigator's time should be spent doing, but naturally there is [sic] other duties that are critical ... but if you were to pull the job description for an investigator, I think the core of it would be centered around the investigative activity.\"); Ex 24, Martinez\n   <footnotemark>\n    8\n   </footnotemark>\n   Dep. at 34:16-24 (Q: \"So would you agree with me that the main job of the special investigator is to investigate claims and report what they investigated or what they found to the claims rep?\" A: \"Yes.\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   Plaintiff David Deluca was employed as a special investigator from approximately April 2012 to May 2014. Am. Compl., \u00b6 3. He was assigned to a territory that covered Santa Clara, Contra Costa, and Alameda Counties, and he reported to offices in San Jose and Concord, California.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Cal.%20Code%20%C2%A7%20226\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   Plaintiff Barry Francis was employed as a special investigator from approximately April 2006 to June 2016.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Cal.%20Code%20%C2%A7%20226\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Cal.%20Code%20%C2%A7%20226\">\n    , \u00b6 4\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . He was assigned to cover San Francisco, Contra Costa, and San Mateo Counties, and reported to an office in Daly City, California.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Cal.%20Code%20%C2%A7%20226\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   Plaintiff Melissa Laughlin was employed as a special investigator from approximately December 2011 to September 2014 and covered territory on Long Island, New York.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"6\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Cal.%20Code%20%C2%A7%20226\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"6\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Cal.%20Code%20%C2%A7%20226\">\n    , \u00b6 5\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . These named Plaintiffs, as with all other special investigators, were classified as exempt employees. Am. Answer, \u00b6 13.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   <strong>\n    B. Investigations Process\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   A claim is routed to SIU for investigation after being identified by Claims as a suspect file. Ex. 31, Wedding Dep. at 87:2-88:6. Sometimes the Claims representative will initially contact a special investigator to discuss whether a claim has fraud indicators\n   <footnotemark>\n    9\n   </footnotemark>\n   that warrant an investigation and other times the Claims representative will submit the claim through a system called the assignment manager.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ; Ex. 6, Reyes Dep. at 68:17-70:1 (describing situation where Claims representative would call to obtain his opinion on whether a claim had a fraud indicator and should be referred to SIU for investigation). If the claim is routed through the assignment manager, that manager system assigns the file to a special investigator based on their proximity to the claim, who then reviews the file to determine whether an investigation is warranted and if s/he is the person who will conduct the investigation. Ex. 31, Wedding Dep. at 88:7-22. A special investigator does\n   not need to accept every claim that is referred to the SIU. Ex. 25, Masuen\n   <footnotemark>\n    10\n   </footnotemark>\n   Dep. at 61:10-12 (\"It's the investigator's job to take a look at that file and see if they think we can have any impact on that claim.\"); Ex. 22, Newell Decl., \u00b6 6; Ex. 21, Hsieh Decl., \u00b6 15 (\"the decision to decline SIU involvement is my own\" and she does not need to confer with her SIM before declining a file). At times, a special investigator may close a file mid-investigation because s/he decided that the claim did not warrant SIU involvement. Ex. 2, Francis Dep. at 85:17-25.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   Once they have the file, special investigators contact the claim representative early on to consult about an investigation plan. Ex. 28, Page Dep. at 31:15-32:1. SIMs do not officially approve an investigation plan once it is drafted, although SIMs generally initially review them.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"7\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Cal.%20Code%20%C2%A7%20226\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"7\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Cal.%20Code%20%C2%A7%20226\">\n    at 32:2-7\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Each claim is unique and special investigators have \"the freedom to tailor their tasks to that claim.\" Ex. 13, Newell Dep. at 86:6-17. Plans are subject to change depending on whether developments in the investigation warrant a new direction. Ex. 6, Reyes Dep. at 75:20-76:23 (may need to make mid-investigation changes to the plan but would not need to seek approval first from Claims representative or SIM).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   An investigation plan may include one or more of the following tasks: running background reports; taking detailed in-person statements; canvassing the relevant cite; following up with witnesses, police, and anyone else associated with the claim; reviewing cell phone records; reviewing credit report; searching social media. Ex. 5, SIU Investigations Presentation, FIE-DF007669 (describing SIU's investigative tasks). Special investigators are expected to update their Claims partners as important developments occur in the course of their investigation. Ex. 1, Quality Guidelines.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   The special investigators create a file for each claim they investigate. Ex. 28, Page Dep. at 18:21-22. Within the file, they record their investigative activities and, at the end of the investigation, record a summary or conclusion about their investigative findings.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"8\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Cal.%20Code%20%C2%A7%20226\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"8\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Cal.%20Code%20%C2%A7%20226\">\n    at 18:23-19:1\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . The conclusions are \"just a summary of the key points that [the special investigators] investigate.\" Ex. 13, Newell\n   <footnotemark>\n    11\n   </footnotemark>\n   Dep. at 96:24-25. \"It may have what the indicators were. It will have what the tasks were, what the results of the tasks were that the [special investigator] did that are relevant to the claim. And it's just reporting the facts of what [SIU] found in the investigation in a concise manner to Claims.\" Ex. 13, Newell Dep. at 97:2-6; Ex. 18, Ambrosio Dep. at 7-9 (\"Because the claim file is based on fact ... It's just strictly fact.\"); Ex. 13, Newell Dep. at 63:7-13 (\"we just want to report the pertinent information ... the information that explains were the indicators resolved, what were the results, and not a step-by-step ... replay of the entire investigation ...\"). Special investigators are not supposed to record their opinions in the file about whether fraud occurred or on any other issue, such as whether a witness was lying. Ex. 28, Page Dep. at 22:18-25, 23:5-20. At times, special investigators report insureds to the underwriting department if they thought their investigation yielded risk advice. Ex. 6, Reyes Dep. at 101:6-102:11 (provided risk advice to underwriting based on his own assessment without input from his supervisor); Ex. 15, Serafin Dep. at 128:19-129:15 (expected\n   special investigators to report to underwriting if they encountered a risk in the course of performing their investigations); Ex. 12, Page Dep. at 121:17-122:9 (special investigators send risk advice to underwriting that they discover during investigations).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   The Claims department has access to the file and can review it at any time. Ex. 13, Newell Dep. at 97:7-10; Ex. 28, Page Dep. at 19:20-20:2. The Claims representative uses the information recorded in the file to inform their ultimate decision on whether or not to deny the claim, as the Claims representative is ultimately responsible for making that decision. Ex. 28, Page Dep. at 20:3-7, 16-17; Ex. 25, Masuen Dep. at 36:21-23 (\"[T]he claims office is ultimately the one that makes a decision on the claim. We just provide the facts.\"); Ex. 9, SIU California Yearly Anti Fraud 2017 at FIE-DF007607.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   A Claims representative may \"informally discuss\" the investigation with the special investigator or another member of SIU. Ex. 28, Page Dep. at 9-12. Mr. Serafin, the former SIU director, testified that at the conclusion of an investigation the special investigator is expected to have a conversation with the Claims representative responsible for the file so that the special investigator \"could convey context and what they observed and have a more detailed conversation.\" Ex. 30, Serafin Dep. at 77:12-14. This conversation may include a \"candid discussion about what they observed, what they saw, and what they think the appropriate next steps would be for that claim resolution.\" Ex. 30, Serafin Dep. at 77:3-5. Mr. Page, an experienced SIM, acknowledged that special investigators might give their informal opinion on whether to pay or deny a claim based on fraud, but that he would not expect them to do so because \"it's a fact-based investigation and I want them to steer away from their opinions on these things as much as possible.\" Ex. 28, Page Dep. at 69:23-70:15. Mr. Page further acknowledged that some Claims representatives, especially inexperienced ones, may press the special investigators for their opinions.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"9\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Cal.%20Code%20%C2%A7%20226\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   Some special investigators provided testimony that they sometimes provided informal opinions to Claims representatives about whether to pay a claim or not. Ex. 4, Daszko Dep. at 31:19-32:9 (would discuss the \"ultimate legitimacy of the claim\" with Claims representatives about one-third of the time); Ex. 19, Bear Decl., \u00b6 41 (when he was a special investigator he \"frequently had informal, verbal communications with the claims representative to discuss relevant factual information about the ultimate legitimacy of the claim as well as my factual observations relating to witness's credibility\"). Other Plaintiffs testified that they did not offer these informal opinions. Ex. 3, Francis Dep. at 186:7-14 (in response to question about whether to deny or pay claim, he would respond \"That's a claims office decision.\"); Ex. 20, Deluca Dep. at 41:8-41:12 (refused to offer conclusions to Claims representatives); Ex. 22, Grimes Dep. at 51:12-52:5 (if asked, would tell Claims representative that \"we are not allowed to give our opinion or tell them what we think should happen next\"). Special investigators are neither trained to provide their opinions nor are they evaluated on giving them. Ex. 18, Ambrosio Dep. at 115:10-12 (no training to give ultimate opinion on fraud and not evaluated on giving informal opinions); Ex. 28, Page Dep. at 70:16-19 (same).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   In conducting their work, special investigators are encouraged to \"think very independently\" and determine in their discretion \"how and what to investigate when they receive a claim.\" Ex. 19, Bear Decl., \u00b6 6; Ex. 22, Newell Decl., \u00b6 8 (\"I believe it is important to afford special investigators\n   under my supervision the freedom and latitude to plan and conduct investigations in the manner they see appropriate based on the nature of the specific claim, including the particular indicators of fraud present in the claim file.\"). SIMs do not micromanage the special investigators and special investigators largely work independently and from the field. Ex. 7, Grimes Dep. at 94:22-95:8 (she was never given a daily task list and was expected to management her own workflow); Ex. 22, Newell Decl., \u00b6\u00b6 18 (\"As a SIM, I have never directed or mandated that special investigators perform their investigations in a certain manner or sequence.\"), 19 (special investigators under his supervision are \"remote or virtual employees who work out of their homes, in the field, and occasionally visit different Branch Claims Offices\"); Ex. 21, Hsieh Decl., \u00b6 5 (\"So long as I get my work done, Ms. Masuen leaves me alone to schedule my workload, create my investigation plans, and to carry out my investigations as I decide.\"); Ex. 6, Reyes Dep. at 65:8-11 (worked from home 99% of the time); Ex. 2, Francis Dep. at 106:22-107:2 (primarily worked out on the field). The special investigators maintained flexible schedules that were not dictated by their supervisors. Ex. 2, Francis Dep. at 102:18-23 (testifying that he had no set schedule); Ex. 8, Masuen Dep. at 124:7-19 (explaining that special investigators under her supervision made their own schedules and were allowed flexibility to attend to personal obligations during the normal workday); Ex. 22, Newell Decl., \u00b6 19 (\"As SIM, I do not take any steps to monitor the whereabouts of an investigator on a daily basis. How a special investigator chooses to spend his or time [sic] is their own decision.\"). Special investigators are not prevented from taking meal breaks. Ex. 21, Hsieh Decl., \u00b6 27 (\"As a special investigator, I am able to take a break whenever I want to take a break during the day ... No one at FIE has ever told me that I should not take my meal break ...\"); Ex. 2, Francis Dep. at 222:11-16 (never told not to take a meal or rest break).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   <strong>\n    C. Special Investigator Training, Quality Guidelines, and Audits\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   Over time, Farmers has shifted the process it uses for evaluating the quality of SIU's investigations, but there have always been guidelines against which investigations were reviewed. Ex. 30, Serafin Dep. at 29:2-30:13. Historically, before the U.S. District Court for the District of Minnesota ruled that Farmers misclassified special investigators as administratively exempt under the FLSA and California law in\n   <em>\n    Fenton v. Farmers Ins. Exch.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3791661\" index=\"10\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-2d/663/718/\">\n    663 F. Supp. 2d 718\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (D. Minn. 2009), Farmers used a quality assurance (QA) system to audit special investigators' work that provided a quantitative score for their performance.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3791661\" index=\"11\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-2d/663/718/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3791661\" index=\"11\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-2d/663/718/\">\n    at 726\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (noting that the QA guidelines \"explain in great detail how plaintiffs should approach dozens of issues that typically arise in the performance and documentation of investigations\"). Prior to around 2013, special investigators conducted their investigations using a QA checklist, but special investigators have since stopped using the checklist. Ex. 30, Serafin Dep. at 112:22-113:20; Ex. 4, Daszko Dep. at 164:20-25.\n   <footnotemark>\n    12\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   In approximately 2013 or 2014, SIU changed the QA reviews and standards to behavior-based Investigative Quality (\"IQ\") reviews and standards and eliminated the checklist. Ex. 30, Serafin Dep. at\n   29:13-30:13; Ex. 14, Francis Files (contain numerical score for his files in 2014, according to Plaintiffs, although the document is not dated).\n   <footnotemark>\n    13\n   </footnotemark>\n   The purpose of the changes was \"to get rid of the checklist mentality\" and eliminate the scoring of special investigators' work. Ex. 18, Ambrosio Dep. at 63:5-15; Ex. 15, Serafin Dep. at 112:20-21 (\"we went away from any kind of checklist and any kind of scoring\"). Witnesses explained that the revisions to the quality standards and review process had the effect of reducing inapplicable and unnecessary work on a given investigation. Ex. 31, Wedding Dep. at 144:12-17 (\"... at one time there was a requirement that field investigators had to do field work on every file, so that also would to the unnecessary work, and so that - I would say the teams where that was a requirement, there's no such requirement\"); Ex. 30, Serafin Dep. at 112:8-114:17 (the changes helped special investigators move \"through the process efficiently, thereby creating minimal delay and costing the company less money to get the proper resolution ... if they weren't doing unnecessary tasks, then they should be probably more effective in how quickly they got to the right answers\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   After the transition, SIU supervisors used quality guidelines to assess the special investigators' performance, which were provided to the special investigators for their reference. Ex. 30, Serafin Dep. at 25:11-26:21. These guidelines were called the SIU Investigation Quality Best Practices Guidelines. Exs. 1-3 (these exhibits contain three different versions of the guidelines, the most recent version appears to be from 2015) (the \"Guidelines\"). The Guidelines cover timeliness, investigation, regulatory compliance, and documentation. Exs 1-3 at 1. In declarations supporting their motion for class certification, Plaintiffs Deluca, Francis, Daszko, O'Brien, and Stewart stated that the \"SIU Quality Assurance Guidelines (QA)\" \"applied and controlled how special investigators worked on their files\" throughout their employment. Dkt. No. 69-9 (\u00b6 10). Plaintiff Deluca explained that he tried to adhere to what the guidelines required and that he did not know if there was anything else he would have done that was not in the guidelines. Ex. 3, Deluca Dep. at 110:19-111:23.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   According to Plaintiffs, SIMs review a sampling of special investigators' files using a program called TeamThink that includes a standard set of review questions that include basic questions about the claim and investigation, as well as qualitative questions such as whether the \"investigative thought process [was] proactive and efficient\" and whether \"the claim [was] handled within state regulatory requirements.\" Exs. 12-13 (reviews from 2016 and 2017).\n   <footnotemark>\n    14\n   </footnotemark>\n   These reviews include the SIMs' comments and feedback, such as comments\n   that the SIM \"would be careful about putting in your opinion about what caused the damage. Stick to reporting the facts only.\" Ex. 12 at FIE-DF006600. If a special investigator's file failed to meet an expectation, such as an expectation about timeliness of completion, an \"exception\" will be noted and, generally, discussed with the special investigator. Ex. 28, Page Dep. at 46:2-25; Ex. 24, Martinez Dep. at 75:1376:2 (using TeamThink questionnaire as a tool for coaching special investigators). During discovery, Farmers provided a report listing the results of hundreds of claims reviews. Brome Decl., \u00b6 3; Ex. 32 (184-page compilation of review comments).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   Although SIMs appear to perform some degree of qualitative review of special investigators' files, there is evidence that each SIM was given discretion to perform quality reviews.\n   <footnotemark>\n    15\n   </footnotemark>\n   Ex. 18, Wedding Decl., \u00b6 15 (\"SIMs periodically conduct a review of the open cases that a special investigator is handling ... The quality review of claim files, however, is left to the discretion of the SIM at the local level.\"). Michael Ambrosio testified that SIU discontinued regular quality reviews around 2014 because they had \"consistently ... high, high-quality reviews\" and \"at that point, we felt there was really no value.\" Ex. 10, Ambrosio Dep. at 57:15-21. From then on, SIU moved to \"more of a spot checking, random checking, by the SIMs. More of a trust but verify kind of approach versus a rigid review.\" Ex. 10, Ambrosio Dep. at 58:6-8. In addition to their own review, some SIMs, such as Diane Masuen, asks her special investigators to perform a peer review of the other special investigators' files. Ex. 8, Masuen Dep. at 79:4-9.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   Objective measures are tracked regarding the special investigators' productivity and impact. These measures include the volume of claims closed by the special investigators, how long it takes to close files, and the dollar value of claims that are \"deterred\" by SIU's work. Ex. 28, Page Dep. at 54:25-55:13, 55:23-57:2, Ex. 11 at FIE-DF002939; Ex. 30, Serafin Dep. at 13:4-25, 135:15-21. A department outside of SIU, called National QA, has conducted audits of SIU files. Ex. 18, Ambrosio Dep. at 70:6-71:9. Richard Martinez, who used to work in SIU and moved to National QA in 2015, explained that National QA used to randomly pull 120 files to review every quarter, which included SIU's contribution to the file, and generate a benchmark report on its findings. Ex. 24, Martinez Dep. at 48:17-49:20. The purpose of these audits, the results of which were only provided to SIU leadership, was to look at \"overall work, overall trends and patterns that we are seeing in terms of ... their teams [sic] behavior.\" Ex. 14, Martinez Dep. at 58:21-59:14. More recently, National QA has moved toward more targeted reviews, such as the use of private investigators and the effectiveness of the use of social media for investigations. Ex. 24, Martinez Dep. at 57:6-23.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   Starting in 2016, Special Investigators completed a three- to four-week training module called \"SIU Fundamentals\" intended to prepare them to fulfill their job responsibilities. Ex. 10, SIU Fundamentals at FIE-DF006904; Pl. Supp. Br., Page Dep. at 112:7-113:16. SIU Fundamentals training touches a wide range of relevant topics, including investigation basics (e.g., taking witness statements and checking databases), indicator lists, investigative quality, and regulatory compliance.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3791661\" index=\"12\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-2d/663/718/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   Before that time, Farmers used a new hire\n   program called the Onboarding Journal.

Government Reporting Function\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   SIU is an internal investigatory function that is mandated by the State of California's Department of Insurance (\"DOI\"). Ex. 2, Francis Dep. at 97:8-12; Ex. 11, Stewart Dep. at 52:4-11. Under certain circumstances, special investigators are expected to report claims to DOI or the National Insurance Crime Bureau (\"NICB\"). Ex. 25, Masuen Dep. at 84:13-16. Reporting to these entities is required by state and federal law. Ex. 18, Ambrosio Dep. at 91:23-92:16. Special investigators receive training on how to properly complete the DOI and NICB reports and Farmers had guidelines for ensuring that referrals had all necessary information. Ex. 18, Ambrosio Dep. at 93:1-12, Ex. 8, FIE-DF007374 (internal Farmers email providing tips for NICB and DOI referrals). Claims are reported to these entities when there are unresolved fraud indicators after an investigation. Ex. 25, Masuen Dep. at 86:1-10; Ex. 28, Page Dep. at 74:4-13; Ex. 22, Grimes Dep. at 47:9-14; Ex. 20, Deluca Dep. at 25:8-26:5. In California, the technical standard is when one \"reasonably believes or knows that a fraudulent claim is being made.\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"13\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Cal.%20Code%20%C2%A7%201872.4\">\n    Cal. Ins. Code \u00a7 1872.4\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   Several SIU employees testified that they referred nearly all claims they investigated to DOI and/or NICB. Ex. 28, O'Brien Dep. at 107:8-21 (his best recollection was that he referred every claim to NICB); Ex. 29, Reyes Dep. at 77:17-78:4 (reported \"essentially, almost all claims\"). For some special investigators, their SIMs supervised some or most of their referrals to NICB and DOI. Ex. 22, Grimes Dep. at 47:22-48:5 (referrals were generally determined by special investigators but sometimes her manager directed her to refer claims that she would not have referred); Ex. 29, Reyes Dep. at 79:18-80:5 (same); Ex. 20, Deluca Dep. at 29:20-30:25) (asked SIM whether referral was appropriate \"[m]ost of the time\"). Once SIU makes a referral to NICB or DOI, it is up to that agency to decide how to handle the claim. Ex. 28, Page Dep. at 78:23-79:1.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   In addition to referrals to NICB and DOI, a special investigator may report a claim to law enforcement to \"shar[e] information\" and \"build rapport.\" Ex. 7, Grimes Dep. at 27:17-28:11 (would communicate with district attorneys in California in connection with investigations of workers compensation claims); Ex. 4, Daszko Dep. at 163:5-164:19.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   <strong>\n    E. Industry Events and Training for Claims Representatives\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   Special investigators may provide training to Claims representatives about SIU's work and some special investigators attend industry meetings and events or conduct trainings for outside groups. Ex. 18, Ambrosio Dep. at 98:6-99:8 (a small number of special investigators provide training to Claims representatives and it is \"encouraged, but not required\"); Ex. 18, Ambrosio Dep. at 40:1-21 (some special investigators attended outside industry meetings). However, these events and trainings were not especially time consuming and were not a large portion of the tasks the special investigators performed as part of their job duties. Ex. 18, Ambrosio Dep. at 40:23-41:4 (for special investigators who attended industry meetings frequently they would spend \"[o]nly a couple hours a month\" at them); Ex. 18, Ambrosio Dep. at 100:15-101:3 (trainings occur once or twice a year for approximately 15-20 minutes).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   <strong>\n    F. Tracking Time Worked and Breaks\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-50\">\n   There is evidence that special investigators worked over 40 hours per week to\n   investigate all of the files assigned to them.

No. 69-9, Deluca Dec., \u00b6 11; Francis Dec., \u00b6 11; Daszko Dec., \u00b6 11; O'Brien Dec., \u00b6 11; Stewart Dec., \u00b6 11 (stating that they \"routinely worked over 40 hours per week\" and that they \"did not receive any overtime compensation for any of those hours\"). Mr. Page, who is a SIM, testified at his deposition that he discourages special investigators from working over 40 hours a week but he \"know[s] it happens.\" Ex. 28, Page Dep. at 98:13. He also stated, however, that \"[i]t tends to balance itself out.\" Ex. 28, Page Dep. at 98:13-14.\n   <footnotemark>\n    16\n   </footnotemark>\n   Farmers does not keep records of the hours that the special investigators worked and, therefore, the special investigators may be in the best position to identify how many hours they worked. Ex. 18, Ambrosio Dep. at 87:11-88:1; Ex. 28, Page Dep. at 100:22-24. The pay stubs provided to special investigators do not indicate the number of hours worked. Ex. 15, FIE-DF004398 (sample wage statement).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-51\">\n   Farmers' meal and rest break policies did not provide second meal breaks for the exempt special investigators. The policies either (1) applied to \"all employees\" (i.e., exempt and nonexempt) but only provided first meal breaks without mention of second meal breaks; or (2) only provided second meal breaks for nonexempt employees. Dkt. No. 69-3. Plaintiffs testified that they regularly worked through their meal periods without taking dedicated meal periods. Ex. 21, Francis Dep. at 218:2-219:8 (worked through lunch); Ex. 20, Deluca Dep. at 149:12-24 (\"I can't really say that I ever took lunch\" and \"a lot of times we'd eat right there [in the office] while we're working\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-52\">\n   <strong>\n    G.

Plaintiff does not dispute that Farmers' records may show that her employment started on December 27, 2011.\" She similarly did not dispute the end date of her employment in her response to the Request for Admission. The complaint was filed on January 4, 2017, and Laughlin filed her consent to join form on October 23, 2017.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-54\">\n   <strong>\n    II. PROCEDURAL HISTORY\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-55\">\n   On January 4, 2017, Plaintiffs filed this lawsuit contending that Farmers misclassified them as overtime exempt. Plaintiffs alleged claims under FLSA for overtime and California's wage and hour laws for waiting time and wage statement penalties and premiums for missed meal periods. The Court conditionally certified Plaintiffs' FLSA claims on August 1, 2017 and certified a class of special investigators who worked for Farmers in California on February 27, 2018.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-56\">\n   On November 8, 2018, the Court granted in part and denied in part Plaintiffs' motion to leave to amend their complaint. The Court permitted Plaintiffs to amend the complaint to add New York Plaintiff Melissa Laughlin and her New York state law claims but denied the addition of Michigan Plaintiffs Timothy Bethel, Thomas Berry, and Mark Ritzema and their Michigan state law claims. Plaintiffs filed an amended complaint on November 13, 2018\n   to add Plaintiff Laughlin's claims that Farmers violated New York's overtime law, New York Labor Law Art. 19, \u00a7\u00a7 650 et seq., and provided deficient notice and wage statements in violation of New York's Wage Theft Act, New York Labor Law Art. 6, \u00a7\u00a7 190 et seq.

Plaintiffs cite deposition testimony from various current employees of Farmers that their primary duty is to investigate, as well as the fact that the SIU Onboarding Journal and the Guidelines both emphasize the investigation of claims even if they also mention other tasks performed by the special investigators such as regulatory compliance.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-75\">\n   Turning the focus onto their \"primary value\" or end goal rather than their main task, Farmers contends that the special investigators' primary duty is to protect Farmers' assets against the threat of insurance fraud or, in a slightly different characterization, combat fraud.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Ferrell v.

Mar. 30, 2007) (elevating the plaintiffs' primary value\" to the defendant over consideration of the time spent performing certain duties). Farmers notes that insurance fraud is a multi-billion dollar threat.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"39\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Cal.%20Code%20%C2%A7%201871\">\n    Cal.

Thus, Farmers asserts that all of Plaintiffs' tasks - from running their investigations to consulting with Claims representatives to reporting claims to NICB or DOI to training other personnel on fraud prevention and detection - should all be considered part of their primary duties. If the Court were to give controlling weight to an employee's \"primary value,\" as Farmers argues, it is likely that nearly all tasks an employee completes would be completed in service of her ultimate worth to the employee organization, unless the employee undertook truly unrelated tasks.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-76\">\n   Instead, Plaintiffs' primary job duty is to conduct investigations into claims that indicate potential fraud, while their other responsibilities are secondary to that central task. Take, for example, Plaintiffs' responsibility to report potentially fraudulent claims to DOI and NCIB. There is undisputed evidence that nearly all claims that SIU investigates are referred to one or both entities, and that making those referrals takes up a relatively small percentage of Plaintiffs' time.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Calderon v. GEICO Gen. Ins.

That task serves Farmers' overall goal of preventing and detecting insurance fraud and is necessary to comply with Farmers' legal obligations.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-77\">\n   But it is not central to the fundamental purpose of the special investigators, which is to avoid the payment of fraudulent claims in the first place.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Ex. 15, Serafin Dep. at 123:5-8 (SIU's purpose is to \"educate, identify, detect, [and] resist fraudulent payments, or attempts to defraud the company through the insurance claims process\"). If, hypothetically, Farmers were to eliminate the duty to make referrals, the special investigators' jobs would remain largely the same.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-78\">\n   The same is true of the other less time-intensive tasks that Plaintiffs perform in the course of their jobs. Farmers highlights the fact that some special investigators train Claims representatives and other personnel on issues related to fraud. Since providing training is not a requirement of the job and not all special investigators opt to give training, this activity cannot be considered part of Plaintiffs' primary duty. For essentially the same reasons, the provision of informal opinions to Claims representatives about the legitimacy of a claim are also not Plaintiffs' primary duty. Some special investigators testified that they give informal opinions about whether to pay a claim, but there is also evidence that they are not trained to do so, it is not considered part of their job, some do not give these informal opinions, and their investigations and conclusions are factual only.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-79\">\n   <strong>\n    b.

The plaintiff was a Target employee who identified and conducted investigations of fraud and theft at several Target stores.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at *2. The plaintiff reviewed information that had been entered into a database by Target store employees to identify instances where she believed fraud might be occurring.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at *3. Once she developed a potential case for investigation, she brought it to her supervisor for approval.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   She then started running the investigation, seeking approval from her supervisor along the way as needed.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Eventually, if a strong enough case was made, the plaintiff brought the information she developed in her investigation to law enforcement.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   On the discretion and judgment element, the court found that \"[n]otwithstanding that there are only so many tactics to choose from, Investigators use their judgment to decide which ones to employ.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at *7. Thus, she \"exercised independent judgment and discretion not only in selecting cases and in planning out strategies and tactics for investigations, but in carrying out those investigations.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at *7. In the same way that the\n   <em>\n    Mullins\n   </em>\n   plaintiff was responsible for planning her investigative steps, Plaintiffs did here, too, and here Plaintiffs functioned under a lower level of supervision. However,\n   <em>\n    Mullins\n   </em>\n   is also somewhat distinguishable because the plaintiff was responsible for identifying her\n   own cases for investigation, whereas cases are typically referred to Plaintiffs by the Claims representatives, although Plaintiffs can decline them.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-105\">\n   Focusing only on the special investigators' primary duty of conducting investigations of fraud indicators on referred claims, the record reflects that Plaintiffs act independently in planning and carrying out their investigations.

Special investigators' custom of communicating and collaborating with the Claims representatives during the course of their investigations does not significantly reduce the independence they exercise. However, \"mak[ing] decisions regarding the precise manner in which they conduct an investigation - creating action plans, deciding who to interview, what documents to review, what leads to follow, and whether to recommend hiring an expert - ... are more appropriately viewed as choices among 'established techniques, procedures or specific standards described in manuals or other sources,' \" that are not considered exercises of discretion and independent judgment with respect to matters of significance for purposes of the administrative exemption.\n   <em>\n    Ahle v.

Plaintiffs' assertion that Farmers did not change the special investigators' job is inaccurate, as it eliminated the investigation checklist and converted its QA program to the IQ system around 2013 or 2014. In 2015, Farmers also stopped performing routine audits of SIU's investigation. Plaintiffs are correct, however, that Mr. Serafin, former SIU Director, testified in his deposition that the\n   <em>\n    Fenton\n   </em>\n   decision did not factor into the implementation of the IQ system because they believed they were in compliance with the FLSA and that the\n   <em>\n    Fenton\n   </em>\n   decision was wrongly decided. The\n   <em>\n    Fenton\n   </em>\n   parties settled the case after summary judgment and an appeal was never taken.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-111\">\n   While the\n   <em>\n    Fenton\n   </em>\n   court did not rely exclusively on the QA standards to find that the special investigators did not exercise sufficient discretion or independent judgment, it noted that the \"QA review guidelines ... explain in great detail how plaintiffs should approach dozens of issues that typically arise in the performance and documentation of investigations.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-112\">\n   <em>\n    Fenton\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3791661\" index=\"113\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-2d/663/718/\">\n    663 F.

After\n   <em>\n    Fenton\n   </em>\n   , Farmers did not change its standards to allow special investigators to provide their ultimate conclusions on whether a claim is fraudulent, but it did substantially revise its guidelines in the years after the decision to eliminate the QA standards, thereby giving special investigators greater control to tailor their investigation to a particular claim file.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-113\">\n   Farmers contends that it made other changes to the special investigators' job, such as determining whether SIU involvement is appropriate in the first place and requiring that investigators only include relevant information in their final report, as opposed to an exhaustive recitation of all the information gathered in their investigations. Based on the record citations Farmers provided to the court, both in its original briefing and the supplemental briefing supplied after the hearing, it is not clear that these were actual changes implemented post-\n   <em>\n    Fenton.\n   </em>\n   Instead, Farmers largely relies on comparing statements in the\n   <em>\n    Fenton\n   </em>\n   decision that described the special investigators' role at the time to standards that were in place in 2013 (\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Ex. 18, Wedding Decl., \u00b6 30, Ex. E) or vague testimony about moving from the QA guidelines to behavior-based standards (\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Ex. 15, Serafin Dep. at 50:3-52:1) to argue that the responsibilities and expectations of the position evolved in the period after\n   <em>\n    Fenton.\n   </em>\n   The Court cannot easily verify the\n   <em>\n    Fenton\n   </em>\n   court's characterization of the special investigators' duties at that time because it does not have the underlying evidence that was before the\n   <em>\n    Fenton\n   </em>\n   court. Accordingly, this evidence is inconclusive in establishing when or even whether these more specific job changes took place as Farmers asserts.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-114\">\n   Moreover, as to the information provided in the special investigators' final reports, the 2013 SIU QAE Explainer that Farmers submitted does not directly conflict with the QA guidelines that support the\n   <em>\n    Fenton\n   </em>\n   court's determination that the special investigators provided an \"exhaustive file\" at the end of their work.\n   <em>\n    Fenton\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3791661\" index=\"114\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-2d/663/718/\">\n    663 F.

The pre-\n   <em>\n    Fenton\n   </em>\n   QA guidelines stated that the special investigators' \"purpose is to provide ... factual information that allows the Claims Professionals ... to make good decisions, not tell them what decision to make, or provide conjecture on what really happened.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3791661\" index=\"115\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-2d/663/718/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3791661\" index=\"115\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-2d/663/718/\">\n    at 727\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . The QA guidelines required special investigators to include \"[a]ll inculpating and exculpating information ... in equal detail and emphasis,\" and provided that \"[o]pinions and/or speculative 'what if' scenarios are not acceptable.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3791661\" index=\"116\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-2d/663/718/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   They further provided that \"[a]ll reports must be attached to the file, even if the result was no information available.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3791661\" index=\"117\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-2d/663/718/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-115\">\n   The later guidelines cited by Farmers do not seem to represent a major change as to the information Plaintiffs must provide to the Claims Representatives. While the 2013 SIU QAE Explainer stated that the documentation \"should be as concise as reasonably possible,\" Ex. 18, Wedding Decl., \u00b6 30, Ex. E at FIE-DF000959, it also required inclusion of \"their investigative actions and any information developed that could potentially impact the claim decision.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3791661\" index=\"118\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-2d/663/718/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   at FIE-DF000957. More specifically, it must \"list the relevant investigation actions completed, identify and explain the SI's conclusions, summarize any significant findings, address the outcome of identified indicators, detail any discrepancies or unresolved issues, and be supported by facts (investigative activity).\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3791661\" index=\"119\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-2d/663/718/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   at FIE-DF000958. Moreover, the 2013 guidelines were explicit that special investigators were required to \"evidence the SI's strategic thinking as they developed their investigation. This should include explaining why they pursued new leads, the\n   reasons for changes to the investigation plan, why they deemed any steps not valuable or decided to eliminate others and the basis for their conclusions.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3791661\" index=\"120\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-2d/663/718/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   at FIE-DF000957. As discussed in the background section of this Order, the deposition testimony cited by the parties uniformly demonstrates that Plaintiffs were not allowed to include their subjective opinions about a claim in their reports, just as in the pre-\n   <em>\n    Fenton\n   </em>\n   era. That Plaintiffs were expected to supply \"reasonably concise\" information and documentation that focuses on \"any information developed that could potentially impact the claim\" does not establish that Plaintiffs no longer had to provide all relevant claim-related information to Claims Representatives, as it appears they were required to do in the period reviewed by the\n   <em>\n    Fenton\n   </em>\n   court.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-116\">\n   It is evident, however, that the legal landscape has been shifting on the exempt status of insurance fraud investigators and that Farmers relied on the Sixth Circuit's decision in\n   <em>\n    Foster.\n   </em>\n   Farmers did not completely alter Plaintiffs' position after the\n   <em>\n    Fenton\n   </em>\n   decision, although it did make some changes. Farmers stated that it believed the\n   <em>\n    Fenton\n   </em>\n   decision was wrongly decided (the parties settled before appeal), and it maintained that their special investigators were appropriately classified as exempt from overtime. The Sixth Circuit's\n   <em>\n    Foster\n   </em>\n   decision in 2013 supported Farmers' position before the statute of limitations period began to run, and the Fourth Circuit's\n   <em>\n    Calderon\n   </em>\n   decision in 2015 created a circuit split that complicated case law on the application of the administrative exemption. In light of these competing facts, there are disputed material facts concerning whether Farmers acted willfully in misclassifying the Plaintiffs. Accordingly, the Court denies Plaintiffs' motion for summary judgment on the willfulness issue.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-117\">\n   <strong>\n    C. Liquidated Damages\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-118\">\n   Plaintiffs also move for summary judgment on whether Farmers is liable for liquidated damages. \"An employer has the burden of showing that the violation of the [FLSA] was in good faith\n   <em>\n    and\n   </em>\n   that the employer had reasonable grounds for believing that no violation took place.

On the issue of its subjective good faith, Farmers has shown that it made changes to the special investigator position after\n   <em>\n    Fenton\n   </em>\n   , largely in the form of eliminating the QA checklist. Farmers organized a working group in 2011, two years after\n   <em>\n    Fenton\n   </em>\n   , to evaluate the investigator position. While Mr. Serafin testified that the\n   <em>\n    Fenton\n   </em>\n   decision was not a factor in switching to the IQ system and away from the QA review and the investigation checklist, he also provided testimony that Farmers believed the\n   <em>\n    Fenton\n   </em>\n   decision was wrongly decided and Plaintiffs' exempt status was lawful. On this record, the Court declines\n   to enter summary judgment in favor of Plaintiffs on the availability of liquidated damages.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-120\">\n   <strong>\n    D.

They explain that her salary was approximately $80,000 per year ($1,538.46 per week and $38.46 per hour). Her overtime rate (1.5x) is $57.69. Laughlin estimates that she worked approximately 15 hours of overtime per week, so that her weekly wage loss was $865.35 before liquidated damages are taken into account. She is eligible for 136 weeks overtime under New York law, so without liquidated damages her maximum damages are $117,687.60.

After the Court enters its summary judgment order, the parties will likely need to complete some discovery, as reflected by the case schedule which incorporates a period of post-summary judgment discovery. After that, however, the case will proceed to trial. In addition, Laughlin's claims almost entirely overlap with the claims of the other Plaintiffs, all of which remain in this case. Thus, while Laughlin's own FLSA claim will be dismissed, the other Plaintiffs' federal claim remains. At this point, discovery on Laughlin's state law claims has likely been taken and, if any discovery remains on her claims, it will only add a small, incremental burden to whatever discovery must be taken on the other substantially identical claims of the other Plaintiffs. This significant\n   overlap between the claims means that maintaining this case in federal court is the more efficient option, and there is no special state law expertise needed to adjudicate the claims. In this way, comity is not necessarily well-served by dismissing Laughlin's claims and requiring her to refile in New York state court, particularly given the advanced procedural posture of this case. While Laughlin's claims have only been in this case since November 2018, they rest largely on litigation surrounding the FLSA claims which has been in litigated since January 2017.
