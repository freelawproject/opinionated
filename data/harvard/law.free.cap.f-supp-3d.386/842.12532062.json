For the reasons provided below, the motion is\n   <strong>\n    GRANTED\n   </strong>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   <strong>\n    I.\n   </strong>\n   <em>\n    <strong>\n     BACKGROUND\n    </strong>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   This is an action arising under the Sherman Antitrust Act (\"the Sherman Act\"),\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=15%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201\">\n    15 U.S.C. \u00a7 1\n   </extracted-citation>\n   <em>\n    et seq.\n   </em>\n   , concerning Defendants' alleged conduct at the public auction for the Estate of Lenita Cole (\"the Estate\")\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   held on April 21, 2018, for real property located in Scottsville, Kentucky. (Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 3-6, DN 1). Plaintiff Valerie Powell (\"Plaintiff\"), who is the daughter of Lenita Cole and Administratrix of the Estate, alleges that \"during the course of the auction, Defendants recognized that there was only one (1) competing bidder, namely Chris Shockley [ (\"Shockley\") ] who was bidding on behalf of his farm partnership.\" (Compl. \u00b6 8). Plaintiff claims that Defendant Barry Dyer (\"Dyer\") approached Shockley and demanded that Shockley pay Defendants $ 40,000 or else they would continue bidding on the property. (Compl. \u00b6 8). Shockley and his farming partner, Jason Williams (\"Williams\"), allegedly agreed to pay $ 40,000 to acquire the property free of competing bids from Defendants. (Compl. \u00b6 9). Shockley and Williams ultimately paid $ 492,200 for the property upon placing the highest bid at the auction. (Compl. \u00b6 10).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   Afterward, \"the [E]state investigated the matter and concluded that it was deprived of $ 158,200 as a result\" of Defendants' conduct. (Pl.'s Resp. 2). Plaintiff reaches this conclusion because \"Shockley and Williams were prepared to pay up to ... $ 650,400\" for the property, compared to the $ 492,200 they ultimately paid. (Compl. \u00b6 10). As a result, Plaintiff alleges that she and her brother-who is also a beneficiary of the Estate and a resident of Tennessee-were each deprived of $ 79,100. (Pl.'s Resp. 2).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   Plaintiff initiated the present action pursuant to\n   <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=15%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%2015\">\n    15 U.S.C. \u00a7 15\n   </extracted-citation>\n   seeking to recover treble damages as well as reasonable attorneys' fees and litigation costs.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   (Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 12-13). Defendants move to dismiss Plaintiff's Complaint on two grounds. First, Defendants argue the Court lacks subject matter jurisdiction because \"Plaintiff must establish a nexus between [Defendants'] conduct and interstate commerce in order to bring a Sherman Act violation case.\" (Defs.' Mot. Dismiss 2, DN 6). Since the Estate was being probated in Kentucky, and because Defendants, Plaintiff, Shockley and Williams are all residents of Kentucky, Defendants \"request this Court to dismiss this case for lack of subject matter jurisdiction [because] the transaction ... was purely intrastate and did not have a substantial impact on interstate commerce.\" (Defs.' Mot. Dismiss 3). Second, Defendants contend Shockley and Williams are indispensable parties to this action under Fed. R. Civ. P. 19(a)(1) whose non-joiner warrants dismissal. (Defs.' Mot. Dismiss 3-4).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   In her response, Plaintiff asserts that Defendants' conduct affects interstate commerce \"given that the beneficiary residing in Tennessee was deprived of $ 79,000 or more as a result of Defendants' wrongdoing.\" (Pl.'s Resp. Defs.' Mot. Dismiss 4, DN 8 [hereinafter Pl.'s Resp.] ). Regarding Defendants' motion to join Shockley and Williams as indispensable parties, Plaintiff argues \"Defendants have merely made conclusory statements unsupported by any specific facts or legal arguments\" and \"the law is clear that potential joint tortfeasors are only permissive parties.\" (Pl.'s Resp. 6).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   <strong>\n    II.\n   </strong>\n   <em>\n    <strong>\n     STANDARD OF REVIEW\n    </strong>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   Motions to dismiss for lack of subject matter jurisdiction under Fed.
