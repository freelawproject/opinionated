Holloway's Employment With Heartland\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   In November, 2009, Heartland hired Holloway as a Regional Hospice Consultant (RHC). Her job was to evaluate Heartland providers' entitlement to payment for hospice services. To make her evaluations, Holloway reviewed patients' clinical and insurance documentation, including their eligibility for Medicare or Medicaid. (Doc. 69 at 12, \u00b6 25). Some patients' files were designated as \"Bill Hold Chart Audits,\" meaning Heartland held \"claims to Medicare for payment ... pending ... Holloway's review.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   (internal quotations omitted)).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   RHCs, including Holloway, prepared for executives' review \"workbooks\" discussing patients' \"clinical records and billing histories\" and identifying for discharge patients who the RHCs concluded were not terminally ill. (Doc. 69 at 14, \u00b6 28). \"Holloway routinely followed up\" on her recommendations and often found that the patients she identified in her workbooks \"had not been discharged but remained on hospice and continued to be the subject of claims to the Medicare Part A and Medicaid systems.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 34, \u00b6 72).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   In October, 2010, Holloway's employment at Heartland ended. (Doc. 69 at 12, \u00b6 25).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   <strong>\n    III. Holloway's\n    <em>\n     Qui Tam\n    </em>\n    Action\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   Holloway originally filed her\n   <em>\n    qui tam\n   </em>\n   complaint alleging FCA violations on August 24, 2010. (Doc. 1). After a seven and one-half-year investigation, the government filed its notice of election to decline intervention on March 1, 2018. (Doc. 55). In response to an August 6, 2018 motion to dismiss (Doc. 68), Holloway sought, and I granted, leave to amend her complaint (Doc. 70). The amended complaint (Doc. 69) is the subject of the pending motion (Doc. 82).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   Holloway's amended complaint asserts that Heartland 1) presented false or fraudulent claims for payment to the government (the \"presentment\" claim); 2) prepared false records in support of such claims for payment (the \"false records\" claim); and 3) retained payments from the government to which Heartland was not entitled (the \"reverse\" false claim). (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Doc. 69 at 45-49).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   In support of these claims, Holloway alleges corporate-wide practices aimed at inflating Heartland's hospice census:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-26\">\n   \u2022 A\n   <strong>\n    reward/punishment system\n   </strong>\n   , whereby Heartland 1) promised certain employee groups bonuses if hospice agencies met targets for new enrollments and achieved census and billing benchmarks (Doc. 69 at 15-16, \u00b6 31); 2) promised additional vacation hours to the agency with the largest census increase in its region (\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 17-18, \u00b6 35); and 3) threatened to terminate certain Toledo-based employees if facilities failed to meet census requirements (\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 18, \u00b6 36).\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-27\">\n   \u2022\n   <strong>\n    Employee training\n   </strong>\n   that discouraged \"clinical personnel charged with preparing [patient] documentation\" from using \"ship sinkers,\" that is, language depicting patient improvement, and instead encouraged \"negative charting,\" or \"focus[ing] ... on purported clinical indicia of medical\n   decline[ ]\" as would support hospice recertification. (Doc. 69 at 22-23, \u00b6\u00b6 42-44).\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-28\">\n   \u2022 Authorizing non-physician employees to\n   <strong>\n    override physician recommendations\n   </strong>\n   to discharge patients from hospice care where physicians' notes indicated the patient no longer needed such care. (Doc. 69 at 27-28, \u00b6\u00b6 56-57).\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   Holloway submits that these practices caused employees to produce \"distorted records,\" on which medical directors and physicians relied when \"deciding whether or not to certify or re-certify\" patients as hospice-eligible. (Doc. 69 at 20, \u00b6\u00b6 39-40). In turn, she asserts, Heartland submitted claims for payment that falsely represented the patients' eligibility. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 20, \u00b6 41).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   Holloway also alleges that Heartland retained funds the government paid for treating unqualified patients by:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-31\">\n   \u2022 Instructing employees not to review\n   <strong>\n    discharged patients' records\n   </strong>\n   beyond the most recent billing period to determine whether the agency should have discharged such patients sooner (and, thereby, ceased billing for their treatment sooner) (Doc. 69 at 35, \u00b6 76); and\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-32\">\n   \u2022 Refusing to respond to Medicare\n   <strong>\n    auditors' requests\n   </strong>\n   for additional documentation when \"Heartland knew (or realized upon inquiry)\" that subject patients \"were not eligible for hospice services,\" causing the auditors to deny one month's worth of claims but take no further action (Doc.69 at 37, \u00b6 79).\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   <strong>\n    Standard of Review\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   To survive a motion to dismiss under Rule 12(b)(6), the complaint \"must contain sufficient factual matter, accepted as true, to state a claim that is plausible on its face.\"\n   <em>\n    Ashcroft v.

Holloway responds that those cases do not reveal the fraud she alleges because her complaint alleges a broader scheme, names different Heartland entities, and arises in a different jurisdiction.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-83\">\n   I agree with Heartland.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-84\">\n   First, the South Carolina cases directly alleged that the same corporate parent, HCR ManorCare, fraudulently submitted claims for hospice care it provided unqualified patients. Accordingly, those cases, \"regardless of [their] specificity,\" publicly disclosed Holloway's allegations.\n   <em>\n    Poteet,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4012348\" index=\"74\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/552/503/#p511\">\n     supra\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"75\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=552%20F.3d%20513\">\n    552 F.3d 513\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (internal citations omitted).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-85\">\n   Next, the Sixth Circuit has found the type of differences Holloway identifies between her case and the Heartland South Carolina cases immaterial to this inquiry.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-86\">\n   For example, in\n   <em>\n    United States ex rel.

The court held that two\n   <em>\n    qui tam\n   </em>\n   cases disclosed the relator's allegations although one case arose in a different federal jurisdiction against another of the defendant's divisions that served customers in another region of the country, and another case arose in state court but alleged fraud against a subset of customers not implicated in relator's case.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-87\">\n   In\n   <em>\n    Poteet,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4012348\" index=\"77\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/552/503/#p511\">\n     supra\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   , 552 F.3d at 512-13, the court likewise found that a California state wrongful discharge case disclosed relator's FCA claims in Tennessee federal court because both cases asserted that defendant bribed medical professionals with vacations disguised as conferences and \"think tanks.\" The court so held because the prior suit \"presented enough facts to create an inference of wrongdoing ... and thereby was sufficient to put the government on notice of the 'possibility of fraud.' \"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 513 (internal quotations and citations omitted).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-88\">\n   So too here. Holloway, like the Heartland South Carolina plaintiffs, claims that Heartland fraudulently requested payment for hospice services when it knew patients were not hospice eligible. The differences in jurisdiction, breadth, and subsidiaries involved are immaterial to the question of whether those cases disclosed Holloway's allegations.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-89\">\n   The South Carolina cases sufficiently put the government on notice of the same type of fraud Holloway alleges, and, therefore, those cases publicly disclosed her claims.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-90\">\n   <strong>\n    b.

And, moreover, that sometimes the longer it gets, the less persuasive it may become. But if some attorney doesn't waste time (mine and his or hers) filing a motion seeking leave to exceed page limits or opposing same, that's fine with me.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-176\">\n    Always better, though, to take the time as best and vigorously as one can, snipping, cutting, and pruning, pulling up the weeds, raking out the underbrush, and edging along the driveway, curb, sidewalk, around the lamppost, and walkway to the front door.
