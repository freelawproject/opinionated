Dkt. No. 59. The minutes from that status conference state that \"[t]he court ha[d] additional questions re defendants' request for a\n   <em>\n    Franks\n   </em>\n   Hearing.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 1.

She recommended that this court uphold the search based on the good-faith exception to the exclusionary rule.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   The defendants have objected both to Judge Joseph's order denying their request for a\n   <em>\n    Franks\n   </em>\n   hearing and her recommendation regarding the motion to suppress.

The court reproduces below the facts as Judge Joseph recounted them:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-20\">\n   On September 3, 2017, Milwaukee County Circuit Judge Borowski issued a warrant to search 5272 North 45th Street, Milwaukee, Wisconsin. The application for the search warrant was based on an affidavit signed by Nate Peskie, a Special Agent with the Wisconsin Department of Justice Division of Criminal Investigation. (Exh. A \u00b6 1.) Peskie was part of a local, state, and federal law enforcement investigation of Theresa Lewis. (Defs.' Br. \u00b6 9.)\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-21\">\n   Peskie averred that law enforcement had interviewed a confidential informant who told them that Theresa Lewis was working with her cousin, Stephen Lewis, to pick up cocaine shipments in Texas. (Exh. A \u00b6 3.) The informant provided law enforcement with telephone number (414) 949-9152 and claimed that the number was being used by Theresa Lewis to contact the informant. (\n   <em>\n    Id\n   </em>\n   .) Peskie further averred that the informant explained that during conversations with Theresa Lewis, the informant referred to the cocaine source location in Texas as \"home away from home.\" The informant also said that Theresa Lewis told the informant that she (Lewis) was going to their \"home away from home\" with Stephen Lewis and was being paid $1200 to make the trips approximately once a month. The informant spoke to Theresa Lewis about the drug operation as recently as July 10, 2017. (Exh. A \u00b6 4.)\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-22\">\n   Peskie also averred that on May 8, 2017, law enforcement agents received information from the informant who explained that during a call with Theresa Lewis on May 3, 2017, Theresa Lewis said that she was getting ready to make a trip over the weekend and that upon returning from the trip she would \"drop it (believed to be drugs)\" at Stephen Lewis' house and get paid by him. (Exh. A \u00b6 7.)\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-23\">\n   Peskie averred that the informant is accurate and reliable because: (1) the\n   informant had been providing information to law enforcement since February 2017; (2) the information was substantially against the informant's own penal interest; and (3) the information was consistent with evidence obtained through other law enforcement activity, phone records, and interviews of other confidential sources. (Exh. A \u00b6 3.)\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-24\">\n   Peskie also averred that on March 1, 2017, law enforcement reviewed historical call records obtained through a subpoena for (414) 949-9152, the telephone number utilized by Theresa Lewis. Those records indicate numerous contacts between Theresa Lewis' number and (972) 734-1111 a Dallas, TX telephone associated with \"several Milwaukee area drug cases.\" (Exh. A \u00b6 5.)\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-25\">\n   Peskie also averred that on April 27, 2017 agents from DCI and DEA met with members of the Milwaukee FBI Task Force who informed them that the FBI had an open drug investigation linked to Stephen Lewis. The FBI claimed Stephen Lewis was a runner for a large-scale heroin and cocaine distribution network. (Exh. A \u00b6 6.)\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-26\">\n   Peskie stated that a \"reliable source\" informed law enforcement that Theresa Lewis left Milwaukee on August 11, 2017 for a drug trip to Houston, TX and returned to Milwaukee on August 14, 2017. (Exh. A \u00b6 8.) The same \"reliable source\" informed law enforcement that Theresa Lewis left Milwaukee on September 1, 2017 and was heading to Texas on a drug trip. Peskie believed the \"reliable source\" to be accurate and reliable because Peskie had utilized information from the same \"reliable source\" in the past and found it to be reliable and correct. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   )\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-27\">\n   Peskie further averred that based on monitoring of Theresa Lewis' cell phone, authorized pursuant to a \"State of Wisconsin Pen/Trap &amp; Trace warrant\" obtained on September 2, 2017, he became aware that Theresa Lewis' phone stopped at a gas station in Livingston, TX on September 2, 2017. (Exh. A \u00b6\u00b6 9-10.) A follow-up call to the Livingston police department ascertained that \"Theresa Lewis was in the company of several black males, and that two vehicles were possibly associated with Theresa Lewis, a silver VW and a white Hyundai.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) Peskie subsequently observed a white Hyundai and a silver VW hatchback crossing the border into Wisconsin on September 2, 2017\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   at 1:45 p.m., and that the VW was ultimately stopped on I-94 under the North Avenue overpass, where Theresa Lewis was found seated in the back seat. (Exh. A \u00b6 11.)\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-28\">\n   Milwaukee Police Department (MPD) officers monitoring 5272 N. 45th Street prior to the traffic stop of the vehicle of which Theresa Lewis was a passenger on September 2, 2017, did not note any vehicles parked in the front or rear of 5272 N. 45th Street that \"were known to be associated with this residence.\" (Exh. A \u00b6 12.) The MPD officers later saw a white Hyundai parked at the rear of 5272 N. 45th Street. (Exh. A \u00b6 13.) Stephen Lewis was seen leaving the rear of that residence and entering the white Hyundai after which a traffic stop was\n   attempted, Stephen Lewis fled, and was ultimately arrested. (Exh. A \u00b6 14.) The Hyundai was searched and law enforcement recovered one corner cut of cocaine lying beneath the front driver's seat. Stephen Lewis denied having been at 5272 N. 45th Street. (Exh. A \u00b6\u00b6 14-15.)\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-29\">\n   Finally, Peskie averred that law enforcement subsequently returned to 5272 N. 45th Street and knocked at the front door, but received no response. (Exh. A \u00b6 17.) While at the front door, a law enforcement officer smelled the odor of \"fresh\" marijuana in the area of the front door, and with the information that Theresa Lewis was in the company of several black males while in Livingston, TX at the gas station, the law enforcement officer believed a second individual was inside the residence. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) Law enforcement officers then entered the residence using a key recovered from Stephen Lewis. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) Peskie further states that: the residence was \"frozen and secured\" by law enforcement; the residence was not searched; and law enforcement officers were waiting for a search warrant to search the residence. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   )\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   Dkt. No. 62 at 2-5.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   <strong>\n    II. MOTION TO SUPPRESS AND REQUEST FOR\n    <em>\n     FRANKS\n    </em>\n    HEARING\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   A.\n   <em>\n    The Defendants' Arguments\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   The defendants asked the court to suppress evidence obtained from a September 3, 2017 search of a residence at 5272 N. 45th Street, Milwaukee, Wisconsin. Dkt. No. 52. Most of the motion focused on the defendants' contention that the affidavit submitted to Judge Borowski in support of the warrant contained false and misleading statements, or omitted facts, in violation of\n   <em>\n    Franks\n   </em>\n   .\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 2. The motion also alleged that the officers entered the residence before they obtained a warrant, and that that entry violated the Fourth Amendment.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 14-15. Finally, they argued that the warrant failed to state probable cause that officers would find contraband or evidence at the 5272 North 45th Street residence.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 2.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   In support of their request for a\n   <em>\n    Franks\n   </em>\n   hearing, the defendants identified the following alleged false and/or misleading statements in the affidavit, and several omissions:\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   * Paragraph Seven:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-36\">\n   On May 8th, 2017, a DCI S/A received information from the CS who explained that during a call with Theresa LEWIS on May 3rd, 2017, Theresa LEWIS said that she was getting ready to \"make a trip\" over the weekend. Theresa LEWIS told the CS that immediately upon returning from \"the trip\" she would drop it (believed to be drugs) off at Stephen LEWIS' aka \"Lil Steve's\" house and get paid by him. According to the CS, this conversation with LEWIS was done with LEWIS using telephone number 414-949-9152.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   Dkt. No. 52-1 at \u00b67.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   The defendants argued that their review of the discovery, \"including letters sent by the CS to law enforcement,\" revealed that on May 3, 2017, Theresa Lewis did not tell the informant that she was going to deliver anything to Stephen Lewis' house (or to any other house). Dkt. No. 52 at 7 (citing a discovery document not provided to the court). They asserted that they had listened to a recording of a May 3, 2017 jail call between the CS and Theresa Lewis, and that at no time during the fifteen-minute call did Theresa Lewis say she planned to take anything to Stephen Lewis' house.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   * Paragraph Ten:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-40\">\n   That your affiant ultimately obtained information during the monitoring of this cellular phone that Theresa Lewis while northbound from the Houston, Texas area had stopped in Livingston, Texas at a gas station; a subsequent follow-up phone call to the local police department (Livingston PD) ascertained that Theresa Lewis was in the company of several black males and that two vehicles were possibly associated with Theresa Lewis with those vehicles being a silver VW and a white Hyundai;\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   Dkt. No. 52-1 at \u00b610.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   Recall that Theresa Lewis stopped at the Texas gas station on September 2, 2017. The defendants alleged that there were two false statements in paragraph Ten. First, they argued that Peskie's assertion that \"two vehicles were possibly associated with Teresa [sic] Lewis with those vehicles being a silver VW and a\n   <strong>\n    white Hyundai\n   </strong>\n   \" was false. Dkt. No. 52 at 8 (quoting dkt. no. 52-1 at \u00b610) (emphasis in defendants' brief). They stated that law enforcement reports disclosed in discovery reported that the clerk at the Livingston gas station had told law enforcement that he recalled seeing a silver Volkswagen and a \"white vehicle\"-no model specified-at the gas pumps.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   (citing a discovery document not provided to the court). The defendants asserted that the discovery further indicated that Theresa Lewis's cell phone pinged at a gas station in Bryant, Arkansas at 12:14 a.m. on September 3, 2017 (the wee hours the next day). Dkt. No. 52 at 12. The discovery revealed that Peskie contacted local law enforcement in Bryant who told him that \"the 'clerk remembered two vehicles being parked at the gas pumps, the clerk stated one of the vehicles was a silver Volkswagen hatchback. And the other was a new\n   <strong>\n    white Honda\n   </strong>\n   .' \" Dkt. No. 52 at 12 (quoting a discovery document not provided to the court) (emphasis in defendants' brief). In other words, neither clerk mentioned a Hyundai.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   Second, the defendants argued that video surveillance from the Livingston, Texas gas station showed that Theresa Lewis was with\n   <em>\n    two\n   </em>\n   black males, not \"several.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 8. The clerk at the Arkansas gas station recalled seeing two black males \"in the new white Honda that apparently filled up with gas and paid at the pump.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 12-13.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   * Paragraph Eleven:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-45\">\n   That your affiant, subsequent thereto at approximately 1:45 p.m., observed a white Hyundai and a silver VW hatchback crossing the border into Wisconsin; that the VW was ultimately stopped in [sic] I-94 under the North Avenue overpass at which time affiant ascertained that Theresa Lewis was seated in the back seat;\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   Dkt. No. 52-1 at \u00b611.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   The defendants argued that the discovery did not support Peskie's statement that he saw a\n   <em>\n    white Hyundai\n   </em>\n   cross the border into Wisconsin on the afternoon of September 3, 2017. Dkt. No. 52 at 8-9. The defendants asserted that discovery showed that law enforcement monitored two \"vehicles of interest\" crossing the border into Wisconsin: (1) a silver Volkswagen GTI with two black males in the front seats and a black female in the backseat, and (2) a Volkswagen Passat (no color specified) with a black female driver and a black male passenger.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 9. The defendants maintained that discovery showed the Passat had fled from police.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   The defendants also reiterated that Peskie's assertion that Theresa Lewis had been seen in Texas in a car with \"several\" black males caused officers to enter the residence on North 45th Street without the warrant, because it gave them false reason to believe that there might be a \"second\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   person (other than Stephen Lewis, whom law enforcement had seen leaving the house) inside.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   They point out that when officers stopped the silver Volkswagen hatchback after it crossed into Wisconsin, Theresa Lewis and\n   <em>\n    two\n   </em>\n   black males (Lorenzo Sandlin and Johnny Walker)-the same number of men that the clerk at the Texas gas station had reported seeing-were inside, but Peskie did not state that in the affidavit.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 13. Only Peskie's affidavit referred to \"several\" black males, but that reference to \"several\" caused officers to enter the North Avenue residence without the warrant.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-50\">\n   Finally, the defendants argue that paragraph eleven of Peskie's affidavit failed to state that law enforcement searched the silver Volkswagen in which Theresa Lewis, Lorenzo Sandlin and Johnny Walker had been driving, and found no contraband.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   They also noted that, contrary to what Peskie represented in the affidavit, the North Avenue overpass crosses I-43, not I-94.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-51\">\n   * Paragraph Seventeen:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-52\">\n   That affiant along with other Special Agents with the Wisconsin Department of Justice returned to 5272 North 45th Street and proceeded to knock on the door but received no response; that SA Gajevic, while at the front door, was able to able [sic] to detect the odor of fresh marijuana coming from the area of the front door of the residence; based upon the information received that Lewis was in the company of several black males while in Livingston, Texas at the gas station, case agents proceeded to enter into the residence believing that a second individual was inside; this location was then searched for an additional individuals [sic] but none were located; furthermore, case agents used keys recovered from Stephen Lewis to enter into this residence; at the present time, the residence of 5272 North 45th Street is frozen and secured by DCI special agents; furthermore, this premises has not been searched and case agents are awaiting approval for the application of a search warrant authorizing a search of this location;\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-53\">\n   Dkt. No. 52-1 at \u00b617.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-54\">\n   The defendants contended that the 5272 residence was not \"frozen and secured\" as the Peskie affidavit says.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 9. They say that officers saw Stephen Lewis leaving the south door of the residence at 3:36 p.m., and that they arrested him at 3:40 p.m.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 10. The defendants asserted that the discovery showed that the officers were \"immediately sent\" to the residence, but that the judge did not authorize the warrant until 6:50 p.m.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   The defendants concluded that because officers were sent to the residence some three hours before the search warrant issued, \"law enforcement officers were in the house for several hours from the time law enforcement officers entered it until the search warrant was authorized ....\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   The defendants further contended that because law enforcement already had stopped the silver Volkswagen (with Theresa Lewis and the two black males observed in her company in Texas inside) they could not have believed that another individual from the alleged Texas drug run was inside the residence.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 13.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-55\">\n   * Paragraph Three:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-56\">\n   On February 28, 2017, Special Agents from the Wisconsin Department of Justice, Division of Criminal Investigation (DCI), conducted an interview of an identified citizen witness who wished to be a confidential source (CS). During the interview, the CS explained that he/she has been in contact with Theresa LEWIS. Through a phone conversation, LEWIS told the CS that she (LEWIS) was making trips to Texas to pick up\n   cocaine shipments with \"Lil Steve\" and \"Lil Mike\". The CS explained that \"Lil Steve\" is Theresa LEWIS's cousin, who agents identified as Stephen LEWIS. Stephen LEWIS had been previously purchasing one (1) to two (2) kilograms of cocaine per month from the CS. According to the CS, this conversation with LEWIS was done with LEWIS using telephone number 414-949-9152.

Dkt. No. 70.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-97\">\n   First, they argued that this court should remand the case to Judge Joseph so that she can consider new evidence she did not have when she made her decision-evidence suggesting that the white Hyundai never traveled to Texas in late August-early September 2017.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Specifically, the defendants argue that when Stephen Lewis picked up the white Hyundai from Hertz Rental Car on August 28, 2017, it had 11,433 miles on it; when it crashed following a police chase on September 3, 2017, it had 11,500 miles on it.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   The defendants assert that the white Hyundai picked up by Stephen Lewis and seen at the 5272 N. 45th Street residence could not have been the same white Hyundai alleged to have been associated with Theresa Lewis in Texas and Arkansas in early September 2017.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   The defendants also assert that while discovery showed that law enforcement referred to this second car as a generic white vehicle, a white Honda and a VW Passat, the affidavit stated unequivocally\n   that the second car associated with Theresa Lewis was a white Hyundai.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 8. The defendants argue that the white Hyundai alleged to have traveled south and back was \"a creature of fiction.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 6.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-98\">\n   Second, the defendants challenged the procedure Judge Joseph used to reach her decision to deny their request for a\n   <em>\n    Franks\n   </em>\n   hearing. They argue that by holding a pre-\n   <em>\n    Franks\n   </em>\n   hearing and relying on the government's supplemental filings to deny the motion, Judge Joseph committed error.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 9 (citing\n   <em>\n    United States v.

The defendants say that their motion to suppress postulated that \"the white Hyundai\" referenced in paragraph ten and eleven was a fiction created by law enforcement to tie Theresa Lewis's Texas drug caravan to Stephen Lewis' residence.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 10-11. They say that Judge Joseph erred by hearing argument on whether to schedule a\n   <em>\n    Franks\n   </em>\n   hearing (a so-called \"pre-\n   <em>\n    Franks\n   </em>\n   \" hearing) and by relying on evidence provided at that hearing and in supplemental briefing to decide that a\n   <em>\n    Franks\n   </em>\n   hearing was unnecessary.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 11-12. The defendants say this procedure violated the Seventh Circuit's decision in\n   <em>\n    McMurtrey\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3654763\" index=\"23\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/704/502/#p504\">\n    704 F.3d at 505\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 11.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-99\">\n   Third, the defendants argue that Judge Joseph ought to have held an evidentiary hearing on the defendants' allegation that law enforcement illegally searched the residence before obtaining a warrant. Dkt. No. 70 at 12. They assert that Judge Joseph \"never discussed or ruled on the Defendants' claim that the initial entry into the home was illegal and tainted the subsequently-obtained warrant.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 70. The defendants say that the affidavit stated only that officers smelled \"fresh\" marijuana coming from the area around the front door of the residence.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   They also speculate that \"the officers did more than a cursory search for persons when they searched Residence the first time[,]\" and they speculate that Peskie may have sought the search warrant based on what officers observed during that initial, allegedly illegal entry.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 14.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-100\">\n   Finally, the defendants allege that Judge Joseph erred in not holding a\n   <em>\n    Franks\n   </em>\n   hearing because she did not consider the defendants' claims cumulatively. Dkt. No. 70 at 15. They argue that \"[t]he effect of misrepresentations and omissions on the existence of probable cause in a\n   <em>\n    Franks\n   </em>\n   challenge must be considered cumulatively.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   (citing\n   <em>\n    United States v.

They say that Judge Joseph erroneously concluded that Judge Borowski had enough information to evaluate the credibility of the confidential informant.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 20. They argue that Judge Joseph's statement that \"it would be clear to the issuing judge that the informant was not acting simply as a good Samaritan or out of civic duty, but had something to\n   gain from providing the information,\" dkt. no. 62 at 12, was erroneous. They argue that \"[i]t is not the job of the issuing magistrate to assume an informant is reliable. It is the job of the affiant to truthfully justify the need to invade the liberty interests of a person, including by truthfully explaining why an informant ought to be considered reliable.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 21.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-102\">\n   D.\n   <em>\n    Government's Response\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-103\">\n   The government responds that the \"new evidence\" that the white Hyundai accumulated only sixty-seven miles from the time Stephen Lewis picked it up to the time it crashed \"does not identify a material false statement that was intentionally or reckless made[.]\" Dkt. No. 75 at 6. The government asserts that \"there is absolutely no support in the record showing that Special Agent Peskie was aware of these rental car records at the time he swore the affidavit on September 3, 2017.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 7. It also contends that the affidavit never definitively stated that the white Hyundai traveled to Texas; the affidavit stated that \"two vehicles were\n   <em>\n    possibly associated\n   </em>\n   with Theresa Lewis[.]\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   (citing Dkt. No. 52-1 at \u00b610).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-104\">\n   Next, the government argues that Judge Joseph did not commit procedural error in denying the request for a\n   <em>\n    Franks\n   </em>\n   hearing. Dkt. No. 75 at 9. The government says that Judge Joseph relied on a letter to the case agent from the confidential informant and case notes from agent Peskie about the Theresa Lewis vehicles.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 9-10. It says that \"defendants cite no case establishing that Judge Joseph or the government erred by taking note of evidence that had previously been produced in evaluating the serious accusations that form the basis for a\n   <em>\n    Franks\n   </em>\n   challenge.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 10. The government also argues that even assuming Judge Joseph erred, she committed harmless error because the defendants had not met their burden for a\n   <em>\n    Franks\n   </em>\n   hearing.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 11.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-105\">\n   The government also contends that officers' entry into the 5272 North 45th Street residence before obtaining a warrant was constitutional.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 12. It states, \"[s]ecuring a dwelling, on the basis of probable cause, to prevent the destruction or removal of evidence while a search warrant is being sought is not itself an unreasonable seizure of either the dwelling or its contents.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   (citing\n   <em>\n    Segura v.

Most of the reply brief recycles arguments made in their original objection; the defendants argue that the rental car records are compelling, that Judge Joseph violated\n   <em>\n    McMurtrey\n   </em>\n   , that they are entitled to an evidentiary hearing on the initial entry and that they believe the misrepresentations and omissions, taken together, warrant a\n   <em>\n    Franks\n   </em>\n   hearing.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 8-13.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-110\">\n   Finally, the defendants argue that the government has taken inconsistent positions regarding probable cause.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 14.

Dkt. No. 75 at 10.

The minutes indicate that Judge Joseph held the hearing because she had questions about the defendants' request for a\n   <em>\n    Franks\n   </em>\n   hearing. The court concludes that the September 6, 2018 hearing was a pre-\n   <em>\n    Franks\n   </em>\n   hearing, subject to the limitations imposed by\n   <em>\n    McMurtrey\n   </em>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-128\">\n   The Seventh Circuit observed that the law on \"pre-\n   <em>\n    Franks\n   </em>\n   \" procedures was sparse as of 2013, and neither the government nor the defendants have provided cases interpreting\n   <em>\n    McMurtrey\n   </em>\n   . The court has found two cases discussing the procedure. The year after it decided\n   <em>\n    McMurtrey\n   </em>\n   , the Seventh Circuit decided\n   <em>\n    United States v.

In concluding that the district court erred in denying the defendant's request for a\n   <em>\n    Franks\n   </em>\n   hearing, the Seventh Circuit stated that\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-129\">\n   to obtain a\n   <em>\n    Franks\n   </em>\n   hearing, the defendant need not overcome the court's speculation regarding an innocent explanation for the falsity or omission.

Finally, the government offered the Seventh Circuit a possible innocent explanation for law enforcement's omission of certain evidence from the affidavit.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   The Seventh Circuit explained that\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-132\">\n   [s]uch an explanation may be offered at a\n   <em>\n    Franks\n   </em>\n   hearing, but the mere assertion of that rationale is not enough to avoid the hearing.

The procedure that Judge Shadid used tracks the procedure prescribed in\n   <em>\n    McMurtrey\n   </em>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-135\">\n   The court concludes that Judge Joseph committed clear error in allowing the government to explain away the discrepancies the defendants had identified in the motion to suppress without converting the September 6, 2018 hearing into a full-blown\n   <em>\n    Franks\n   </em>\n   evidentiary hearing. The government's response to the defendants' objections criticized the defendants' inconsistent arguments. The government says that while the defendants initially argued that paragraph seven of the affidavit contained a false statement, \"[a]fter being confronted with a letter written by the confidential source to case agents (which had been produced in discovery prior to their filing of pretrial motions),\" the defendants \"now contend that the government is precluded from relying on this letter to refute the defendants' serious allegations\" that Peskie made false statements. Dkt. No. 75 at 9. The government seems to concede that it provided \"the case agent's notes and the letter from the confidential source to the case agent\" to Judge Joseph.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 10. It argues, however, that it did not \"present evidence\" when it directed Judge Joseph's attention to the notes and the letter, because \"no one was called to testify at the September 6, 2018 hearing.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   The court is at a loss to understand how giving the court information that it did not have in order to rebut the defendants' allegations of false statements or omission does\n   <em>\n    not\n   </em>\n   constitute presenting evidence, whether the documents were presented through the testimony of a witness or just handed to the judge. The presentation of the notes and the letter appear to have been an attempt to \"back up\" one of Peskie's assertions in paragraph seven of the affidavit that the defendants alleged was false, misleading or incomplete.\n   <em>\n    McMurtrey\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    Glover\n   </em>\n   and\n   <em>\n    Bell\n   </em>\n   state that the purpose of a pre-\n   <em>\n    Franks\n   </em>\n   hearing is to allow a\n   <em>\n    defendant\n   </em>\n   to supplement the allegations in his original motion when his written request for a\n   <em>\n    Franks\n   </em>\n   hearing does not make the \"relatively difficult\" preliminary showing required. The purpose is\n   <em>\n    not\n   </em>\n   to allow the government to present evidence to rebut the assertions the defendant made in the request; that is what the\n   <em>\n    Franks\n   </em>\n   hearing itself is for. By allowing the government to present evidence and arguments rebutting the assertions in the defendants' request, Judge Joseph did what\n   <em>\n    McMurtrey\n   </em>\n   says a district court cannot do.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-136\">\n   2.\n   <em>\n    Harmless error\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-137\">\n   The government argues that even if Judge Joseph committed a procedural error, that error was harmless because the defendants \"failed to make the requisite\n   'substantial preliminary showing' to obtain a\n   <em>\n    Franks\n   </em>\n   hearing.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   It argues that the\n   <em>\n    McMurtrey\n   </em>\n   trial court's restrictions on the defendant's ability to cross-examine the search warrant affiant were impermissible because the defendant had made a showing sufficient to warrant a full\n   <em>\n    Franks\n   </em>\n   hearing; it argues that here, the defendants did not make a sufficient showing to warrant a full\n   <em>\n    Franks\n   </em>\n   hearing, so the fact that Judge Joseph did not give the defendants the opportunity to litigate the agent notes and the letter was harmless.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 10-11. This is a circular argument.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-138\">\n   The\n   <em>\n    McMurtrey\n   </em>\n   court pointed out that if a \"defendant's initial\n   <em>\n    Franks\n   </em>\n   motion does not make the required 'substantial preliminary showing,' the court need not hold a pre-\n   <em>\n    Franks\n   </em>\n   hearing to provide the defendant a further opportunity to do so.\"\n   <em>\n    McMurtrey\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3654763\" index=\"59\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/704/502/#p504\">\n    704 F.3d at 505\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . It appears that in this case, Judge Joseph had questions about whether the defendants' initial\n   <em>\n    Franks\n   </em>\n   motion made the required substantial preliminary showing, because she scheduled an attorneys-only status hearing for the stated purpose of gathering more information about the defendants' request for a\n   <em>\n    Franks\n   </em>\n   hearing. If Judge Joseph had read the defendants' request for a\n   <em>\n    Franks\n   </em>\n   hearing and concluded that it did not make the requisite preliminary showing on its face, she could have denied the motion and moved on to the suppression motion. Rather than denying the motion, she scheduled the hearing, asking for more information. That implies she did not conclude that, on its face, the request for a\n   <em>\n    Franks\n   </em>\n   hearing failed to make the requisite showing. Given that, Judge Joseph had the discretion to give\n   <em>\n    the defendants\n   </em>\n   the opportunity to supplement their motion, but not to allow the government to make arguments based on information outside the four corners of the affidavit.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-139\">\n   Because the court cannot conclude that Judge Joseph's error was harmless, the court will vacate the order denying the defendants' motion for a\n   <em>\n    Franks\n   </em>\n   hearing and remand the case to Judge Joseph to conduct that hearing. As far as this court can tell, that is the remedy for allowing the government to rebut the allegations in the defendants' request without expanding the status conference into a full evidentiary hearing.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-140\">\n   <strong>\n    V. OTHER MATTERS\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-141\">\n   Judge Joseph also issued a report, recommending that this court deny the defendants' motion to suppress. Dkt. No. 62. Given its ruling on the objection to the denial of the defendants' motion for a\n   <em>\n    Franks\n   </em>\n   hearing, the court will defer ruling on whether to adopt that recommendation. The outcome of the\n   <em>\n    Franks\n   </em>\n   hearing may impact whether Judge Joseph reaches the suppression motion, or whether she amends her recommendation.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-142\">\n   The court encourages the parties to present all relevant evidence and arguments to Judge Joseph at the\n   <em>\n    Franks\n   </em>\n   hearing. If Judge Joseph again recommends, post-\n   <em>\n    Franks\n   </em>\n   hearing, that this court should deny the motion to suppress, this court will not consider evidence not presented to Judge Joseph, or arguments not made to her.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-143\">\n   Finally, defendant Hinkle has asked the court to order Federal Defender Services of Wisconsin to appoint Attorney John Schiro to represent her, retroactive to July 10, 2018. Dkt. No. 79. Attorney Schiro was privately retained to represent Hinkle, but because she is in state custody, she does not have funds to continue to pay him. The court will grant this motion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-144\">\n   <strong>\n    VI. CONCLUSION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-145\">\n   The court\n   <strong>\n    VACATES\n   </strong>\n   that portion of Judge Joseph's October 5, 2018 order that\n   denied the defendants' motion for a\n   <em>\n    Franks\n   </em>\n   hearing.
