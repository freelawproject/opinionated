INTRODUCTION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   Plaintiff Aaron Kaufman (\"Plaintiff\") filed the instant matter on September 8, 2017, in Los Angeles Superior Court seeking a declaration that he was entitled to a defense under his homeowners' policy issued by Defendant Federal Insurance Company (\"Federal\"). The defense that Plaintiff seeks is in connection with a cross-complaint and amended cross-complaint (\"Cross-Complaint\" and \"FACC\") filed against Plaintiff by his former employer in the underlying action styled,\n   <em>\n    Kaufman v. California Physicians Services dba Blue Shield of California\n   </em>\n   , Case No. BC577827, Los Angeles County Superior Court (\"Underlying Action\"). Defendants removed the case to this Court on February 1, 2018. (Notice of Removal, ECF No. 1.) Pending before the Court is Defendants, Federal Insurance Company (\"Federal\") and Chubb National Insurance Company (\"Chubb\"), Motion for Summary Judgment, or in the alternative, Partial Summary Judgment (\"Motion\"). (ECF No. 30.) For the following reasons, the Court\n   <strong>\n    GRANTS\n   </strong>\n   Defendants' Motion.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   <strong>\n    II. FACTUAL BACKGROUND\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   Plaintiff was employed by California Physicians Services dba Blue Shield of California (\"Blue Shield\") as its Chief Technology Officer and Vice President of Health Information Technology from March 13, 2013, to March 10, 2015. (Defendants' Statement of Uncontroverted Facts and Conclusions of Law (\"DSUF\") 1, ECF No. 30-2.) Plaintiff worked for Blue Shield's office in San Francisco, California. (DSUF 2.) Federal issued Masterpiece Policy Number 14288420-01 to Plaintiff for the policy period October 15, 2014, to October 15, 2015, (the \"Policy\"), which provided \"Personal Liability Coverage\" for suits filed anywhere in the world, including California. (DSUF 3, 5, 6.) The scope of coverage was limited to personal injury or property damage. (Decl. of Elizabeth L. Musser (\"Musser Decl.\") Ex. P (the \"Policy\"), T-1, ECF No. 30-12.) \"Personal injury\" is defined to include libel, slander, defamation of character, or invasion of privacy. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) Under the Policy, \"[Federal] will defend a covered person against any suit seeking covered damages for personal injury or property damage.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) The Policy contains two exceptions that limit the scope of its coverage: director's liability and business pursuits. (DSUF 9, 10.) Under the director's liability exception there is no coverage for \"any damages for any covered person's actions or failure to act as an officer or member of a board of directors of any corporation or organization.\" (DSUF 9.) Under the business disputes exception, there is no coverage for \"any damages arising out of a covered person's business pursuit, investment or other for-profit-activities, any of which are conducted on behalf of a covered person or others, or business property ...\" nor \"damages or consequences resulting from business or professional care or services performed or not performed.\" (DSUF 10.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   On April 6, 2015, Plaintiff filed a complaint against Blue Shield and asserted causes of action related to his termination from Blue Shield. (DSUF 11.) In response,\n   on April 21, 2015, Blue Shield filed a Cross-Complaint against Plaintiff. (DSUF 17.) In the Cross-Complaint, Blue Shield asserted causes of action against Plaintiff for (1) Fraud; (2) Breach of Fiduciary Duty; (3) Breach of the Duty of Loyalty; (4) Conversion; and (5) Negligent Misrepresentation. (DSUF 18.) Blue Shield sought \"to recover the substantial amount of money that its former Vice President and Chief Technology Officer Aaron Kaufman knowingly misappropriated from Blue Shield, before being terminated.\" (DSUF 20.) Blue Shield discovered the alleged misappropriation after it investigated Plaintiff's conduct following an after-hours company event at a San Francisco bowling alley on January 6, 2015. (DSUF 22.) Plaintiff organized the event and invited several Blue Shield employees and their spouses or significant others to attend the event, and Plaintiff was joined by his girlfriend. (DSUF 22.) Blue Shield alleged that at some point during the event, Plaintiff's girlfriend posted inappropriate photos of herself while at the bowling alley and shared them on social media sites. (DSUF 23.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   As a result of the investigation, Blue Shield alleged that Plaintiff, \"(1) violat[ed] Blue Shield's Travel and Expense Policy; (2) violat[ed] Blue Shield's Code of Conduct; (3) interfer[ed] with an investigation; and (4) caus[ed] reputational damage to Blue Shield,\" which led Blue Shield to terminate Plaintiff's employment. (DSUF 24.) Blue Shield's Cross-Complaint sought \"(1) damages arising out of Kaufman's fraudulent misrepresentations, breaches of fiduciary duty, breaches of the duty of loyalty and conversion; (2) disgorgement from Plaintiff and restitution to Blue Shield of Plaintiff's personal expenses improperly charged to and paid by Blue Shield; (3) punitive damages; (4) an order dismissing Plaintiff's complaint; (5) interest; and (6) attorney's fees.\" (DSUF 26.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   On or about April 28, 2015, Plaintiff tendered the Cross-Complaint to Defendant Federal for coverage under the Policy. (DSUF 28.) On or about May 12, 2015, a claims adjuster in California sent a letter to Plaintiff's counsel advising him that there was no obligation to provide coverage for Plaintiff in the Cross-Complaint. (DSUF 29.) Following a demurrer, on September 14, 2015, Blue Shield filed its First Amended Cross-Complaint (\"FACC\") in the Underlying Action and asserted causes of action against Plaintiff for (1) Fraud - Intentional Misrepresentation; (2) Fraud - Concealment; (3) Negligent Misrepresentation; (4) Breach of Fiduciary Duty; and (5) Breach of the Duty of Loyalty. (DSUF 34.) Around September 29, 2015, and October 16, 2015, Plaintiff tendered the FACC for coverage under the Policy. (DSUF 43.) On October 28, 2015, Defendants denied coverage again, and invited Plaintiff to provide additional information supporting a claim for coverage under the Policy. (DSUF 44.) Neither Plaintiff nor his counsel provided additional information in support of coverage. (DSUF 45.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   The Underlying Action was tried to a jury in March 2017, and on March 17, 2017, the jury returned a verdict which denied any remedy to Blue Shield on its FACC, and also denied any remedy to Plaintiff on his complaint. (DSUF 51-52.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   Following the conclusion of the Underlying Action, Plaintiff initiated the instant matter on September 8, 2017, seeking a declaration that he was entitled to a defense under his homeowners' policy in the Underlying Action. (Mot. 1.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   <strong>\n    III. LEGAL STANDARD\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   A court \"shall grant summary judgment if the movant shows that there is no genuine dispute as to any material fact and the movant is entitled to judgment as a matter\n   of law.\" Fed.

DISCUSSION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   Federal contends it is entitled to summary judgment because the Cross-Complaint and FACC in the Underlying Action did not assert any claim coming within the coverage of the Policy. (Mot. 1.) Chubb contends that it is entitled to summary judgment because it is a separate entity from Federal and did not issue the Policy and therefore has no contractual or legal relationship with Plaintiff. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) Plaintiff alleges that he was entitled to a defense in the Underlying Action because the Cross-Complaint and FACC presented a\n   <em>\n    potential\n   </em>\n   claim under the Policy. (Opp'n to Mot. for Summary J. (\"Opp'n\") 12, ECF No. 33.) Plaintiff also argues that Chubb is responsible because the Policy was a \"Chubb Masterpiece Personal Liability Insurance Policy\" issued by Federal.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   <strong>\n    A. Duty to Defend\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   Under California law, the duty to defend is determined by \"comparing the\n   allegations of the complaint with the terms of the policy. Facts extrinsic to the complaint also give rise to a duty to defend when they reveal a possibility that the claim may be covered by the policy.\"\n   <em>\n    Gray v.

In that case, the plaintiff alleged there was a duty to defend where the underlying complaint referenced a \"damaged reputation.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"62\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=104%20Cal.%20Rptr.%203d%20319\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   The court held that the mere fact that a third-party complaint mentions an element of a potential covered claim does not create a duty to defend \"when the facts known to the insurer, viewed as a\n   whole establish that no such claim is potentially asserted.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"63\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=104%20Cal.%20Rptr.%203d%20319\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   The underlying complaint in\n   <em>\n    Total Call\n   </em>\n   made no allegations that the plaintiff specifically referenced the other party when making false statements.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"64\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=104%20Cal.%20Rptr.%203d%20319\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   Instead, all that was alleged was that the plaintiff made false statements in connection with its own advertising for a certain product, but never referred to the other party in doing so.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"65\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=104%20Cal.%20Rptr.%203d%20319\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   Similarly, here, neither the Cross-Complaint nor the FACC contain allegations that Plaintiff made any false statements, oral or written, about Blue Shield. The mere mention that Plaintiff caused Blue Shield \"reputational damage\" does not create a duty to defend because the allegations, when viewed as a whole, establish that no defamation claim was potentially asserted. Additionally, when viewed in the proper context, the allegations relating to \"reputational damage\" related to the reasons for Plaintiff's termination. While the duty to defend in California is broad, this duty does not require the insurer to speculate \"about extraneous 'facts' regarding potential liability or ways in which the third-party claimant might amend its complaint at some future date.\"\n   <em>\n    Gunderson v.
