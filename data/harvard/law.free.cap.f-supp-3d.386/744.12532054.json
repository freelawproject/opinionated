Defendant's Arguments in Support of the Motion to Confirm Arbitration Award\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   Defendants assert that on May 18, 2016, Plaintiff initiated arbitration (the \"Arbitration\") against Defendants, asserting various claims related to the misappropriation of trust funds by Geller.\n   <footnotemark>\n    37\n   </footnotemark>\n   Defendants assert that at the conclusion of Plaintiff's case-in-chief, the Defendants moved to dismiss the Arbitration on the grounds that Plaintiff had failed to assert a claim under any regulation or law-state or federal-upon which damages could be awarded.\n   <footnotemark>\n    38\n   </footnotemark>\n   Defendants assert that the Panel deferred ruling on Defendants' motion until after the conclusion of their case-in-chief, at which time Defendants reasserted their motion and \"the Panel unanimously found no civil responsibility by [them] for the criminal misdeeds of the Trustee [Geller].\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    39\n   </footnotemark>\n   Defendants assert that accordingly, the Panel dismissed Plaintiff's claims against Defendants with prejudice.\n   <footnotemark>\n    40\n   </footnotemark>\n   Further, Defendants state that in the written Award, the Panel stated that \"no breach of a fiduciary duty under any law or regulation [had been] presented [by Plaintiff]\" and that Geller, as trustee, \"was the person\n   solely responsible for the asset destruction of the trust.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    41\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   Defendants argue that if Plaintiff wished to challenge the Award, she was required to file a motion to vacate, modify, or correct the Award by January 10, 2019, three months after the Award was delivered to the parties on October 10, 2018.\n   <footnotemark>\n    42\n   </footnotemark>\n   Defendants assert that all claims by Plaintiff against Defendants have been fully and finally resolved by the Award, which dismissed Plaintiff's claims against Defendants and denied \"[a]ny and all claims for relief not specifically addressed [t]herein[.]\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    43\n   </footnotemark>\n   Subsequently, Defendants argue that the claims that have been resolved against Defendants are \"separate, distinct, and independent from any claims that may still remain against Geller\" and thus the Court should enter final judgment now so that Defendants do not have to wait until proceedings with Geller conclude.\n   <footnotemark>\n    44\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   <strong>\n    2. Plaintiff's Opposition to the Motion to Confirm Arbitration Award\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   In opposition, Plaintiff argues that she did timely move to vacate the arbitration award because the award was entered on November 6, 2018 and she filed a motion to vacate three months later on February 6, 2019.\n   <footnotemark>\n    45\n   </footnotemark>\n   Plaintiff asserts that \"a motion to vacate, modify, or correct an award must be served upon the adverse party or his attorney within three months after the award is filed or delivered.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    46\n   </footnotemark>\n   Plaintiff claims that the Final Arbitration Award was rendered on November 6, 2018, and that Defendants refer to a partially executed award on October 10, 2018.\n   <footnotemark>\n    47\n   </footnotemark>\n   Plaintiff assert that the Court should look to the fully executed Final Arbitration Award, not the interim, partially executed award, as the action that started the three-month limitations period.\n   <footnotemark>\n    48\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   <strong>\n    3. Defendants' Reply in Further Support of the Motion\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   In reply, Defendants' reassert that the limitations period began to run on October 10, 2018 and expired on January 10, 2019.\n   <footnotemark>\n    49\n   </footnotemark>\n   Defendants argue that accordingly, Plaintiff's motion to vacate, filed on February 6, 2019, was untimely by 27 days.\n   <footnotemark>\n    50\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   Defendants claim that the Award was delivered to the parties through FINRA's online portal and the parties were notified by e-mail on October 10, 2018.\n   <footnotemark>\n    51\n   </footnotemark>\n   Defendants claim that the award was signed by two of the three arbitrators who served on the arbitration panel, Mary Elizabeth Skelnik and Daniel Patrick Hurley, but not the third arbitrator, the Honorable Frank A. Little, Jr.\n   <footnotemark>\n    52\n   </footnotemark>\n   Defendants further claim that in the e-mail notification, the Award was referred to as \"Executed Award with Two Signatures[.]\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    53\n   </footnotemark>\n   Defendants claim that a letter from FINRA accompanied the Award, stating that:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-35\">\n   Attached please find the decision reached by the arbitrator(s) in the\n   above-referenced matter. Accordingly, we have closed this case and removed it from our arbitration docket. As you will see, the Award has been signed by the majority of the Panel. Arbitrator Little is currently out of town, but has read the Award, concurred with its content and will sign the Award upon his return. Upon FINRA's receipt, Arbitrator Little's signature will be provided to you.\n   <footnotemark>\n    54\n   </footnotemark>\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   Defendants state that the document refers to itself as the \"Award\" in various sections and that \"neither the letter nor the Award itself indicates that the Award is conditional, stayed, or otherwise \"not final.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    55\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   Defendants then assert that on November 6, 2018, FINRA sent the parties a letter and Arbitrator Little's signed signature page, which states that:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-38\">\n   On October 10, 2018, this office served the award on the parties with two arbitrator signatures. We have received the third signature, and are re-serving the award. Please note that service of the award with three signatures does not modify any of the information and applicable due dates referenced in FINRA's October 10, 2018 letter.\n   <footnotemark>\n    56\n   </footnotemark>\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   Defendants assert that the Award attached to FINRA's November 6, 2018 letter is identical to the Award delivered to the parties on October 10, 2018, with the addition of Arbitrator Little's signature included on an extra page.\n   <footnotemark>\n    57\n   </footnotemark>\n   Defendants also assert that, the Award is publicly available on FINRA's website, where the \"Date of Award\" is indicated as \"10/10/2018.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    58\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   Defendants claim that FINRA addresses this issue under Rule 12904(a), which provides in pertinent part, \"[a]ll awards shall be in writing and signed by a majority of the arbitrators or as required by applicable law.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    59\n   </footnotemark>\n   Further, Defendants assert that the FINRA website provides that \"[i]n a three-arbitrator panel, an award is based on the vote of a majority of the arbitrators; a unanimous decision is not required.... Once the award is signed by a majority of the arbitrators, FINRA will send copies of the signed award to each party or representative of the party.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    60\n   </footnotemark>\n   Defendants also claim that the Federal Arbitration Act does not require all arbitrators serving on a panel to sign an award in order to effectuate and render the award as final.\n   <footnotemark>\n    61\n   </footnotemark>\n   And Defendants claim that while the FAA controls here, the American Arbitration Association and the Louisiana Binding Arbitration Act also only require a majority of arbitrators to sign an award.\n   <footnotemark>\n    62\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   Defendants argue that while there is no case law on this issue from the Fifth Circuit, federal case law outside the Fifth Circuit supports the conclusion that the effective date of the award is October 10, 2018, not November 6, 2018.\n   <footnotemark>\n    63\n   </footnotemark>\n   Defendants claim that the First Circuit has found \"an arbitral award is deemed 'final' provided it evidences the arbitrators' intention to resolve all claims submitted in the demand for arbitration[.]\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    64\n   </footnotemark>\n   Defendants also point to a case from the Seventh Circuit, wherein the court addressed a previous version of FINRA Rule 12904(a) and calculated the limitations period based on the decision of a single member of an arbitration panel.\n   <footnotemark>\n    65\n   </footnotemark>\n   Defendants also point to various district court decisions outside the Fifth Circuit in which courts have rejected arguments that a revision or addition of a signature effected the finality of an initial award.\n   <footnotemark>\n    66\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   Finally, Defendants argue that \"the FAA gives district courts no discretion in deciding whether to confirm an arbitration award where, as here, the limitations period has passed and no motion to vacate, modify, or correct an arbitral award has been filed.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    67\n   </footnotemark>\n   Defendants argue that in this case, the Award must be confirmed because \"[t]he purpose of the short periods prescribed in the federal and state arbitration statutes for moving courts to vacate an award is to accord the arbitration award finality in a timely fashion.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    68\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     B.

Plaintiff's Arguments in Support of the Motion to Vacate Arbitration Award\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   Plaintiff asserts that the moving Defendants are responsible for Plaintiff's losses because Geller was only able to misappropriate the investment account \"because the Investment Firm and Investment Advisors consciously disregarded their duties to reasonably investigate the trustee's obviously suspicious, fraudulent, and illegal behavior.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    69\n   </footnotemark>\n   Plaintiff asserts that instead of investigating the trustee's transfers and spending of assets in the investment account, the firm and advisors \"internally acknowledged and discussed the trustee's suspicious and highly questionable conduct yet opted to do nothing.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    70\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   Plaintiff asserts that the Court should vacate the arbitration award because the Panel \"committed a manifest disregard of\n   the law\" when it reached the conclusion that \"the Investment Firm and Investment Advisors were not required to conduct any investigation into the obviously suspicious and fraudulent behavior,\" despite acknowledging the applicable law requiring an investment firm or advisor to investigate suspicious activity.\n   <footnotemark>\n    71\n   </footnotemark>\n   Further, Plaintiff states that the Panel failed to address or resolve four of the Plaintiff's five causes of action, despite expressly acknowledging that all these claims were at issue.\n   <footnotemark>\n    72\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   Plaintiff states that the FAA provides the grounds on which a district court may vacate an arbitration award: (1) where the award was procured by corruption, fraud, or undue means; (2) where there was evident partiality or corruption in the arbitrators, or either of them; (3) where the arbitrators were guilty of misconduct in refusing to postpone the hearing, upon sufficient cause shown, or in refusing to hear evidence pertinent and material to the controversy; or of any other misbehavior by which the rights of any party have been prejudiced; or (4) where the arbitrators exceeded their powers, or so imperfectly executed them that a mutual, final, and definite award upon the subject matter submitted was not made.\n   <footnotemark>\n    73\n   </footnotemark>\n   Plaintiff also states that the Supreme Court and the Fifth Circuit have determined in the past that \"manifest disregard of the law\" by an arbitration panel is a valid basis on which to vacate an arbitration award.\n   <footnotemark>\n    74\n   </footnotemark>\n   Plaintiff asserts that \"manifest disregard of law\" means more than a mere error or misunderstanding with respect to the law, but instead means that the arbitration panel recognized the existence of the governing legal principle and nonetheless decided to ignore it.\n   <footnotemark>\n    75\n   </footnotemark>\n   Plaintiff recognizes that the Supreme Court decided in\n   <em>\n    Hall Street Associates, L.L.C. v.

The statutory grounds for vacatur are: (1) where the award was procured by corruption, fraud, or undue means; (2) where there was evident partiality or corruption in the arbitrators, or either of them; (3) where the arbitrators were guilty of misconduct in refusing to postpone the hearing, upon sufficient cause shown, or in refusing to hear evidence pertinent and material to the controversy; or of any other misbehavior by which the rights of any party have been prejudiced; or (4) where the arbitrators exceeded their powers, or so imperfectly executed them that a mutual, final, and definite award upon the subject matter submitted was not made.\n   <footnotemark>\n    133\n   </footnotemark>\n   Plaintiff does not allege that the Award was procured by fraudulent means, that the arbitrators were partial, that the arbitrators committed misconduct, or that the arbitrators improperly executed their powers.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-78\">\n   Instead, Plaintiff alleges that the Panel \"committed a manifest disregard of the law\" when it reached the conclusion that \"the Investment Firm and Investment Advisors were not required to conduct any investigation into the obviously suspicious and fraudulent behavior,\" despite acknowledging the applicable law requiring an investment firm or advisor to investigate suspicious activity.\n   <footnotemark>\n    134\n   </footnotemark>\n   Further, Plaintiff states that the Panel failed to address or resolve four of the Plaintiff's five causes of action, despite expressly acknowledging that all these claims were at issue.\n   <footnotemark>\n    135\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-79\">\n   Manifest disregard means \"more than error or misunderstanding with respect to the law.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    136\n   </footnotemark>\n   Assuming that the \"manifest disregard\" ground is valid, in order to succeed on a motion to vacate, Plaintiff must show that the arbitrators \"appreciated the existence of a clearly governing [legal] principle but decided to ignore or pay no attention to it.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    137\n   </footnotemark>\n   Additionally, \"the governing law ignored by the arbitrators must be well defined, explicit, and clearly applicable.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    138\n   </footnotemark>\n   Defendants argue that the FINRA rules referenced by Plaintiff in this case do not constitute governing law.\n   <footnotemark>\n    139\n   </footnotemark>\n   However, the Fifth Circuit has not ruled on this issue, and the Court\n   finds that there exist independent grounds to deny vacatur, so the Court will not rule on this issue.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-80\">\n   Plaintiff argues that the Panel's decision was the wrong decision and that the Panel misapplied FINRA rules related to Defendants duty to protect clients and investigate suspicious account activity.\n   <footnotemark>\n    140\n   </footnotemark>\n   In the Award, the Panel stated that during the arbitration proceedings Defendants moved to dismiss Plaintiff's claims \"on the grounds there was not any breach of a fiduciary duty or regulation by Respondents.\" The Panel also stated that Plaintiff objected to dismissal of her claims on the basis that Defendants \"breached the duty of due diligence, duty of honor, and the duty to investigate unusual activity in connection in connection with the [Trust].\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    141\n   </footnotemark>\n   The Panel ultimately determined that \"the Trustee of the trust was the person solely responsible for the asset destruction of the trust.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    142\n   </footnotemark>\n   \"Thus, the Panel unanimously determined to grant Respondents' Motion to Dismiss, with prejudice....\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    143\n   </footnotemark>\n   In regards to Defendants at issue in the instant motion, \"[t]he Panel found that no breach of a fiduciary duty under any law or regulation was presented.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    144\n   </footnotemark>\n   Based on the plain language of the award, the Panel considered the existence of governing law, but found that a fiduciary duty did not exist under this law. Plaintiff's issue with the arbitration decision is not that the Panel ignored the law entirely, but that the Panel did not reach Plaintiff's desired outcome when applying the law. Therefore, even under the \"manifest disregard of the law\" standard, Plaintiff's motion for vacatur fails.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-81\">\n   As Plaintiff presents no other grounds to vacate the arbitration award, the Court will deny the motion to vacate. As stated above, \"[u]nder the terms of \u00a7 9, a court must confirm an arbitration award unless it is vacated, modified, or corrected as prescribed in \u00a7\u00a7 10 and 11.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    145\n   </footnotemark>\n   Accordingly, having no grounds to vacate, modify, or correct the Award, the Court will confirm the Award.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-82\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     IV.
