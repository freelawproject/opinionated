No. 19 at 1.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   The issue before the Court is whether New York is a real party in interest because, if it is, this Court lacks subject matter jurisdiction over the case. For the following reasons, the Court finds that New York is a real party in interest, there is no diversity of citizenship between the parties, and the case must be remanded back to state court.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   <strong>\n    II. BACKGROUND\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   <strong>\n    A. Facts\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   Defendant is a toy and stationary company incorporated and based in New Jersey.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Dkt. No. 1-2 at 5. According to the Complaint, from August 2015 through April 2016, Defendant imported or distributed approximately 8,924 Toys in New York that contained amounts of lead that far exceeded the permissible federal limit.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 5, 16, 20.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   On April 22, 2016, Defendant discovered that the Toys contained dangerous amounts of lead.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Dkt.

The following day, Defendant informed the U.S. Consumer Product Safety Commission (\"CPSC\") about this issue.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Two days later, Defendant stopped selling the Toys and, under the supervision of CPSC, voluntarily recalled the kits.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 5-6.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   <strong>\n    B. Procedural History\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   On December 13, 2018, the State filed a Verified Petition in the New York Supreme Court in Albany County, alleging that Defendant violated General Business Law (\"GBL\") \u00a7 396-k, which prohibits the importation, distribution, and sale of hazardous toys; GBL \u00a7 349, which prohibits deceiving consumers; GBL \u00a7 350, which prohibits false advertising; and Executive Law \u00a7 63(12), which prohibits fraud.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Dkt.

Accordingly, the Court finds that New York has articulated several quasi-sovereign interests in this lawsuit.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   The remedies requested in the Complaint support this conclusion. New York asks the Court to enjoin Defendant's illegal conduct, impose civil statutory penalties, and institute a quality control program that would prevent another lead incident from happening.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Dkt. No. 1-2 at 28-31. Defendant argues that \"the State's claim for civil penalties is mere window-dressing that does not transform the State into a real party in interest.\"\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Dkt. No. 31 at 11. On the contrary, the civil penalties show that the state is enforcing its quasi-sovereign interests in this litigation. Moreover, the fact that New York does not seek any restitution or damages for the victims is further evidence that the State is the true party to this action.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   Therefore, because the\n   remedies sought clearly benefit the state, New York is the real party in interest in this action.\n   <em>\n    Compare\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Merrill Lynch, Pierce, Fenner &amp; Smith, Inc. v.

No. 31 at 11. This argument mischaracterizes the Complaint. In the Complaint, New York seeks to enjoin Defendant from conduct that is illegal under New York law and to impose civil statutory fines to punish Defendant and deter other businesses from similarly harming New York consumers.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Dkt. No. 1-2 at 28-31. \"The purpose of seeking this wide-ranging relief is not merely to vindicate the interests of a few private parties ...

In fact, New York asks the Court to impose a quality control program, which would prevent the recurrence of this issue.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Dkt. No. 1-2 at 28-29. Clearly, then, this action is not brought on behalf of a confined group of New York citizens, but has been brought by New York to enforce its quasi-sovereign interests.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   Defendant's reliance on\n   <em>\n    Cavicchia\n   </em>\n   is unavailing. In\n   <em>\n    Cavicchia\n   </em>\n   , a district court held that the state was not the real party in interest after it considered that the lawsuit was brought as a civil claim, the statute empowered the Attorney General to sue \"in the name and on behalf of the people of the state of New York,\" and the case \"[did] not in any way affect state revenues, state property, state contracts, or any activity by the state as a political entity.\"\n   <em>\n    Cavicchia\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3092477\" index=\"52\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp/311/149/#p155\">\n    311 F.

No. 31 at 12, 15 (arguing that since the New York consumer protection statutes have never before been used to enforce the federal limit for lead in children's products, it is not proper for New York to do so now);\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 16-19 (arguing that the laws under which the State brings this action are preempted by federal regulation). Since the Court has concluded that it does not have subject-matter jurisdiction to hear this case, it may not rule on the merits of the case, and must remand the case back to state court.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Fed.
