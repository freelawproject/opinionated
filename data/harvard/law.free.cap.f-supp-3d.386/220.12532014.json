SPATT, United States District Judge\n  </author>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   In this case, Marc W. Weinstein (\"Weinstein\" or the \"Plaintiff\") challenges the constitutionality of the Nassau County Police Department's (the \"Department\" or \"NCPD\") policy of confiscating firearms in the course of responding to domestic incidents. On December 10, 2014, the Plaintiff commenced this action against the Department, Acting NCPD Commissioner Thomas Krumpter (\"Krumpter\"), NCPD Chief Steven E. Skrynecki (\"Skrynecki\"), NCPD First Precinct Commanding Officer Daniel P. Flanagan (\"Flanagan\"), NCPD Officer James B. Malone (\"Malone\"), and NCPD Officer and Investigator Paul Cappy (\"Cappy\"). Weinstein originally asserted deprivations of his First, Second, Fourth, Fifth and Fourteenth Amendment rights as well as various state law causes of action. On January 8, 2015, the Plaintiff filed an amended complaint, which added the County of Nassau (the \"County\") (along with the Department, Krumpter, Skrynecki, Flanagan, Malone, and Cappy collectively referred to as the \"Defendants\") as a defendant.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   On February 25, 2015, the Plaintiff filed a motion pursuant to Federal Rule of Civil Procedure (\" FED. R. CIV. P. \" or \"Rule\") 65 seeking a preliminary injunction. On April 11, 2015, Weinstein filed a second amended complaint. This Court denied the Plaintiff's motion seeking a preliminary injunction on August 17, 2015, because Weinstein failed to identify any actual and imminent harm that he would suffer if an injunction did not issue.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   On September 7, 2017, the Plaintiff filed one of the instant motions, pursuant to FED. R. CIV. P. 56, seeking summary judgment in his favor. The other instant motion, filed on March 8, 2018 by the Defendants, seeks summary judgment pursuant to FED. R. CIV. P. 56 in their favor. In the Plaintiff's memorandum opposing the Defendants' cross-motion, Weinstein withdrew his First Amendment cause of action.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   On March 1, 2019, this Court ordered that the parties file all Local Rule 56.1 statements and counter-statements with the Court and that each party submit supplemental briefing that addresses whether Nassau County's policy (1) complies with this Court's ruling in\n   <em>\n    Razzano v.

BACKGROUND\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   Unless otherwise noted, the following facts are undisputed and are drawn from the parties' Local Rule 56.1 statements.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   <strong>\n    A. THE FACTUAL BACKGROUND\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   <strong>\n    1. The Incident\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   On February 25, 2014, Weinstein was at his residence, located at 781 Jefferson Street, Baldwin, New York. The Plaintiff's wife, Zoila Watson-Weinstein (\"Zoila\") and his 24-year-old son, Abraham Weinstein (\"Abraham\"), also resided at the home. Weinstein had previously obtained a license to own handguns from the NCPD and at that time owned nine handguns, all of which were located in his residence. The Plaintiff also owned 39 longarms, which he stored in a safe in the living room.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   At approximately 1:30 p.m. that day, the Plaintiff got into a verbal argument with Abraham regarding the use of a washing machine in the basement. Weinstein was upset that Abraham overloaded the washing machine, which caused flooding on the basement floor. Abraham and Weinstein became engaged in a loud verbal dispute, which awoke Zoila in her bedroom. According to Zoila, \"They were getting loud. And then I remember hearing something about, you just wait right here, wait right here. I'll get something for you. And then [Weinstein] ran upstairs.... He went up to our bedroom.... Then he rushed by me and went back downstairs. But I thought I saw a gun or - I said - it wasn't even that I saw a gun. I thought I saw something brown in his hands.... I know the two of them were still discussing loudly whatever the situation was[.]\" Document Entry (\"Dkt.\") 73-5 at 65:19-67:12.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   At 1:33 p.m. Zoila called 911. The following conversation ensued:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-20\">\n   OPERATOR: \"Nassau County Police 546.\"\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-21\">\n   ZOILA: \"Hi, I'm calling - I - I - I have somebody that's just really out of control today, and it's my husband. And he even took out a gun to turn around and threaten us in the house. So I think I want to have the police come.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-22\">\n   OPERATOR: \"Okay, okay, he's not violent right now?\"\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-23\">\n   ZOILA: \"No, he's just yelling right now. But he took a gun out to go and -.\"\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-24\">\n   OPERATOR: \"Took what kind of gun out?\" [Zoila hangs up]\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 88:16-89:18.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   Malone, a NCPD detective, received an emergency radio dispatch at 1:41 p.m. while in his patrol vehicle to respond to a domestic incident \"with a hysterical female caller, stating there was a male with a gun - being threatened with a gun[.]\" Dkt. 73-7 at 8:14-9:24. When Malone arrived at the house, he knocked on the front door and rang the doorbell. Abraham cracked the door open and told Malone that \"everything's fine.\" Malone responded that he needed to see what occurred and Abraham ultimately let him into the house. Upon entering, Malone observed Zoila standing on the second floor \"hysterically crying, tears running down her face.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 13:23-14:11. Malone discovered Weinstein in the basement sitting on the couch. The Plaintiff told Malone that although there was a fight, everything was fine. Malone reported that Weinstein looked \"very lethargic, very calm, and kind of had like a thousand-yard\n   stare, like looking through me.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 14:17-23. While walking through the house, Malone observed guns and ammunition both inside the living room gun safe, and in various other locations. When Malone spoke to Zoila, she confirmed the 911 call but denied that Weinstein used a gun in the course of the argument.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   After interviewing Weinstein, Zoila and Abraham, Malone determined, based on his interpretation of NCPD policy, that the event in question qualified as a \"domestic incident.\" Malone testified:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-28\">\n   They were upset. They lied about a couple of things telling me there was no argument, there was no fight, yet the 911 call said there was a gun. They were very upset. The mother was hysterical, the son was shaking, sweating. Something happened in that house. To this day I fully believe that there was a gun used in the house. Nobody would admit it. They wouldn't say anything about it. They denied it the entire time. I end[ed] up telling Marc, I said you're not being arrested. But we both know something happened in this house.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 28:23-30:7. The NCPD confiscated all 39 longarms, nine handguns and the Plaintiff's handgun license. The parties dispute whether the seizure was voluntary. The NCPD did not obtain a search warrant at any time during its investigation of the incident.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   <strong>\n    2.

All residents of the County who seek to acquire a handgun license must file an application to the Nassau County Police Commissioner, the licensing officer for the County. Handgun licenses expire five years after issuance unless renewed. They also \"may be revoked and cancelled at any time[.]\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"10\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=N.Y.%20Penal%20Law%20%C2%A7%20400.00\">\n    N.Y. Penal Law \u00a7 400.00\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (11). NCPD's Pistol License Section has the authority to issue, deny, limit, suspend, or revoke handgun licenses. At the time of the incident, a handgun license was subject to a mandatory six-month suspension if its owner was involved in a domestic incident. All handguns would also be removed from the home along with the license. On May 21, 2015, the Nassau County Pistol License Information Handbook was revised to state the following:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-96\">\n   The policy of the Nassau County Police Department is to take a proactive stance against domestic violence, specifically to protect victims of domestic violence, enforce laws and prevent future violence. Therefore, upon notification of any domestic situation where violence is threatened or alleged to have occurred or upon notification of the existence of a volatile domestic situation, the Nassau County Police Department will require the surrender of the pistol license and firearm(s)\n   <em>\n    as well as rifles and shotguns\n   </em>\n   of any involved licensee pending an investigation into the facts and circumstances of the domestic incident and ongoing domestic relations of the licensee and any other involved party(ies). Nassau County Police Department policy requires an investigation before reinstatement of the pistol license can be authorized. The license and firearm(s) as well as any rifles and shotguns will be returned only after a thorough investigation\n   reveals that there are no compelling reasons for continuing the suspension.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-97\">\n   Dkt. 73-12 (emphasis in original).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-98\">\n   <strong>\n    3. Firearm Retrieval Process\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-99\">\n   When handguns and handgun licenses are confiscated, they are transported to the closest precinct and assigned to a police officer in the Pistol License Section, who conducts an investigation into whether the handguns and license should be returned. If longarms are involved, the Deputy Commanding Officer is designated as the Precinct Domestic Incident Liaison Officer and initiates an investigation into whether longarms should be returned. As noted above, Weinstein's firearms and handgun license were confiscated on February 25, 2014. The Plaintiff's handguns and handgun license were transported to the First Precinct and assigned to Cappy. His longarms were also transported to the First Precinct, where Deputy Inspector Robert Musetich (\"Musetich\") was the Deputy Commanding Officer.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-100\">\n   <strong>\n    a. Handguns\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-101\">\n   On January 28, 2015, Marc Timpano, the Commanding Officer of the Pistol License Section, recommended that Weinstein's handgun license be reinstated and that his handguns be returned to him. On February 6, 2015, Weinstein arrived at the NCPD's Police Headquarters and retrieved all of his handguns.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-102\">\n   <strong>\n    b. Longarms\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-103\">\n   On March 3, 2014, Musetich mailed a letter to Weinstein that asked the Plaintiff to complete a Long Gun Review Record form and return it to the NCPD. Although the Plaintiff denies having received this letter or the enclosed forms, Weinstein wrote Musetich a letter that same day to request the return of his firearms and license. The Plaintiff did not attach a Long Gun Review Record to this letter. The NCPD was unable to continue to process Weinstein's request for the return of his longarms without the Long Gun Review Record.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-104\">\n   In October 2014, NCPD Captain John Gisondi (\"Gisondi\") became the Deputy Commanding Officer and Precinct Domestic Incident Liaison Officer for the First Precinct. Gisondi directed his staff to review files on confiscations and re-send letters for those who still had not had their firearms returned. On January 15, 2015, Gisondi sent a certified letter to the Plaintiff again requesting that he complete the enclosed Long Gun Review Record form.

Gisondi attached the form letters that needed to be filled out, signed, and notarized by all those who reside with the Plaintiff. The form letters stated that the signing party had no objection to the return of the firearms, did not feel threatened by Weinstein, and did not believe that he/she would be endangered if the firearms were returned. Zoila, Abraham and the Plaintiff's daughter, who was not at the residence on the date of the incident, signed and notarized the forms. On or around that time, the NCPD completed a Domestic Gun Return Checklist that confirmed all required steps had been completed. Gisondi also personally interviewed all three family members who lived with Weinstein.

After entering the residence, Malone interviewed Weinstein, Zoila, and Abraham. He observed Zoila still visibly hysterical and Weinstein in the basement with a peculiar demeanor. According to Malone, he was \"very lethargic, very calm, and kind of had like a thousand-yard stare, like looking through me.\" During Malone's conversation with Zoila, she confirmed her emergency phone call to police. There were no visible injuries on any of the residents. The record suggests that Malone and his fellow officer left the residence without making any arrests and then returned with additional officers at a later time. The NCPD then confiscated the Plaintiff's longarms and transported them to the First Precinct. The Court cannot conclude based on the current record that exigent circumstances existed at the time the confiscation occurred.

To apply the second prong, the Court must consider \"the risk of an erroneous deprivation of such interest through the procedures used, and the value, if any, of additional or substitute procedural safeguards.\"\n   <em>\n    Mathews\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12026449\" index=\"100\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/424/319/#p334\">\n    424 U.S. at 335\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12026449\" index=\"101\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/424/319/#p334\">\n    96 S.Ct. 893\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . As the Defendants describe, OPS 10023 contains the following procedural safeguards: (1) initiating of investigation by the Precinct Domestic Incident Liaison Coordinator; (2) require the owner to fill out Form 173; (3) initiation of an administrative review; (4) review the National Crime Information database to determine if there is anything that would permit a return of rifles under the Federal Gun Control Act; and (5) interviews with other parties or victims to obtain consent.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-148\">\n   The Plaintiff contends that the above procedures failed to provide a meaningful opportunity to be heard in a timely and sufficient manner. To advance this argument, Weinstein asserts that the current procedure for returning longarms, OPS 10023, does not meet the four requirements elucidated in\n   <em>\n    Razzano\n   </em>\n   . To review,\n   <em>\n    Razzano\n   </em>\n   required the County to initiate a prompt post-deprivation hearing that adhered to the following requirements:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-149\">\n   First, the post-deprivation hearing must be held before a neutral decision-maker.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-150\">\n   Second, ... the right to a prompt post-deprivation hearing only applies to seized longarms that are not (1) the fruit of a crime, (2) an instrument of crime, (3) evidence of a crime, (4) contraband, or (5) barred by court order from being possessed by the person from whom they were confiscated.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-151\">\n   Third, at the hearing, Nassau County shall have the burden of showing that it is likely to succeed in court on a cause of action-presumably forfeiture or a cause of action seeking an order of protection, although the Court does not limit Nassau County to these theories-to maintain possession of the seized longarms.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-152\">\n   Fourth, if the person deprived of longarms prevails at the hearing, the longarms must be returned, barring an order to the contrary from a court to whom that finding is appealed. If, by contrast, Nassau County prevails at the hearing, Nassau County must timely commence a proceeding by which it seeks to maintain possession of the longarms in question.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-153\">\n   <em>\n    Razzano\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4191551\" index=\"102\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-2d/765/176/\">\n    765 F. Supp. 2d at 191\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . This remedy provides substantial protections to individuals whose longarms are seized at a relatively small cost to the County. The Defendants have not presented any evidence that a\n   <em>\n    Razzano\n   </em>\n   hearing would be overly costly or burdensome. As this Court explained, there is nothing preventing the County from having a single hearing officer review handgun licenses and longarms seizures.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-154\">\n   The Defendants argue that the current procedure satisfies both\n   <em>\n    Matthews\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    '\n   </em>\n   second prong and\n   <em>\n    Razzano\n   </em>\n   by providing a \"prompt and thorough investigation ... immediately after confiscation,\" Dkt. 79 at 7, and returning longarms after completion of the investigation, if warranted. The Court agrees, as a general matter, that OPS 10023 establishes a thorough procedure that ensures longarms are only returned to law abiding, responsible individuals. However, the effectiveness or scrupulousness of a procedure does not render it compliant with procedural due process. Notably, OPS 10023 does not provide a\n   <em>\n    prompt, post-deprivation hearing\n   </em>\n   to determine if longarms are being erroneously held by the NCPD. In executing its responsibility to protect the public, it remains possible that police officers may make a mistake in the course of the multitude of stressful decisions required while on duty. A prompt hearing would be valuable in correcting these mistakes and preventing erroneous deprivation.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-155\">\n   While the scrupulousness of the procedure ensures the correct result, the lack of a prompt hearing leaves room for a heightened risk of prolonged deprivation for undeserving owners of longarms. Notably, the current procedure does not provide swift relief. In the instant case, Weinstein's firearms were seized on February 25, 2014. On March 3, 2014, Musetich mailed a Long Gun Review Record form to the Plaintiff and requested that he fill it out and return it to the NCPD. Weinstein did not respond to this request until January 2015, after a new request by the NCPD was initiated to retrieve the Long Gun Review Record form. On February 25, 2015, Gisondi recommended that Weinstein's longarms be returned. On March 13, 2015, Weinstein retrieved all 39 longarms from the NCPD. Discounting the period of time whereby the Plaintiff failed to respond to the NCPD's request, the process took approximately two to three months.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-156\">\n   Although this is not an unreasonable length of time to complete an investigation and return property, the record reflects that Weinstein's experience is not typical. In the First Precinct alone, the NCPD\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-157\">\n   only returned confiscated longarms for two of the 23 individuals who had their weapons seized between September 2012 and February 2014. For many of these individuals, their longarms remain confiscated after\n   <em>\n    four years\n   </em>\n   . This is unacceptable. While all 23 individuals should not or will not have their weapons returned for various reasons, and that many of these delays may not be due to the NCPD, the Court can safely assume that a plurality of these seizures will ultimately result in longarms being returned to their owners.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-158\">\n   Further, for many owners the investigation is on hold for the failure of a victim to return his or her contact forms. For others, it is held up for failure to return a Long Gun Review Record form. This cannot indefinitely preclude individuals from receiving a timely decision in the investigative process. Owners of longarms are entitled to a\n   <em>\n    prompt\n   </em>\n   investigation to determine if their property has been erroneously seized from them. Thoroughness of process is not sufficient to overcome the potential for erroneous deprivation; a timely process is required to satisfy constitutional muster. As the Second Circuit explained in\n   <em>\n    Panzella\n   </em>\n   , \"a lengthy deprivation can be enough to violate the Fourteenth Amendment right to due process.\"\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12275806\" index=\"103\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/863/210/\">\n    863 F.3d at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   218 n.9. For those who have had their longarms seized, four years is much too long to wait for an adjudication of that process. The Court concludes that the current process raises a considerable risk of erroneous deprivation.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-159\">\n   The third\n   <em>\n    Mathews\n   </em>\n   factor inquires as to \"the [g]overnment's interest, including the function involved and the fiscal and administrative burdens that the additional or substitute procedural requirement would entail.\"\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12026449\" index=\"104\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/424/319/#p334\">\n    424 U.S. at 335\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12026449\" index=\"105\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/424/319/#p334\">\n    96 S.Ct. 893\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . The argument presented by the Defendants in support of this factor mimics part of the argument advanced by the County in\n   <em>\n    Razzano\n   </em>\n   , that although the lack of license requirement allows individuals to replace confiscated longarms with newly purchased ones, the government has a critical interest in keeping guns away from dangerous individuals. As the Court previously explained in\n   <em>\n    Razzano\n   </em>\n   , a person's ability to purchase additional longarms to replace the weapons seized substantially limits the Defendants public safety interest in retaining confiscated longarms.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Panzella\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12275806\" index=\"106\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/863/210/\">\n    863 F.3d at 219\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (holding that the plaintiff's ability to freely purchase additional longarms precludes the Court from relying on any public safety interest);\n   <em>\n    Razzano\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4191551\" index=\"107\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-2d/765/176/\">\n    765 F.
