Tostrud, United States District Court Judge\n  </author>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   Midwest Sign &amp; Screen Printing Supply seeks a preliminary injunction forbidding its former employee, Robert Dalpe, from \"working for or assisting\" his new employer, Laird Plastics, \"in any capacity that competes with Midwest\" in violation of an employment agreement between Midwest and Dalpe. Midwest has introduced evidence showing that Dalpe likely violated his employment agreement by emailing himself Midwest's confidential information before his Midwest employment ended and that, if not modified, Dalpe's new position would enable him to assist Laird in competing with Midwest. Midwest has not, however, shown a likelihood of success on other essential elements of its claims, and Laird and Dalpe have introduced evidence showing that Dalpe no longer possesses or intends to use or disclose Midwest's confidential information and that Dalpe's job duties with Laird have been limited to minimize the probability of violating Dalpe's employment agreement with Midwest. For these reasons, among others, Midwest has not shown a likelihood of success on the merits or irreparable harm to justify ordering the extraordinary remedy of a preliminary injunction.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   I\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   A\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   Midwest and Laird's business activities overlap but are not identical. Midwest is \"a\n   full-service supplier of sign materials, including paints and substrates; screen materials, including inks, adhesives, and frames; digital media, equipment, and software; and other digital services.\" First May Aff. \u00b6 3 [ECF No. 5]; Mem. in Supp. at 2 [ECF No. 4] (\"Midwest prides itself [on] being more than simply a supplier. It offers its customers a full-service experience with expert hands-on consultation from its experienced sales representatives.\"). Midwest serves customers in twenty-nine states. Weinberg Aff. \u00b6 18, Ex. D [ECF No. 6]. Laird is \"the largest plastics distributor in the nation,\" with fifty locations in the continental United States and Canada. Reply Mem. at 2 [ECF No. 36]; First Jenkins Decl. \u00b6\u00b6 2-3 [ECF No. 32] (stating Laird has over 25,000 customers). Laird says that \"[a]s a result of its geographic breadth, each Laird location tailors its product offerings to the demands of the individual local market.\" First Jenkins Decl. \u00b6\u00b6 4, 7. At its location in Portland, Oregon, where Dalpe is supposed to work, Laird offers three categories of plastic products: (1) graphic materials, like rigid sheet stock and semi-rigid plastics, which are primarily used for large, indoor signage; (2) acrylics and polycarbonates, which are hard and often see-through materials used when customers require a more durable or transparent product; and (3) mechanical/engineering materials, which are plastics used industrially, such as conveyor equipment in a manufacturing plant.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 11, 13, 17, 20.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   Midwest and Laird dispute the extent to which they compete.

Laird says that it and Midwest do not \"sell blue widgets to the same local hardware store,\" and that it \"sells vastly different plastics products to a largely dissimilar customer base.\" Mem. in Opp'n at 1 [ECF No. 31]; First Jenkins Decl. \u00b6 40 (\"Of Laird's approximate 350 customers in the Portland Market, less than ten are also customers of Midwest.\"). Midwest and Laird's submissions identify specific products they both sell, albeit with different volume and regularity. These include \"roll stock\" (for digital printing and lamination) and \"rigid sheet stock\" (for signage).\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Dalpe Decl. \u00b6 16 [ECF No. 33]; Second May Aff. Ex.

Dalpe Decl. \u00b6 1; Froelke Aff. Ex. A [ECF No. 7]. His first job was Operations Manager, which involved managing Midwest's warehouse, inventory, and customer support at a California location. Dalpe Decl. \u00b6 1; Mem. in Supp. at 2. In April 2015, Midwest promoted Dalpe to the position of Northwest Sales Manager. Dalpe Decl. \u00b6 1; Weinberg Aff. Ex. A. In this new role, Dalpe officed in Portland but oversaw sales for Midwest's \"Pacific Northwest\" region, which included all of Oregon and Washington, and parts of Idaho, Alaska, Montana, and British Columbia. Weinberg Aff. \u00b6 7. According to Midwest's \"Job Description\" document, Dalpe's duties as Sales Manager included leading a team of five sales representatives, meeting with key customers, approving customer quotes and proposals, and \"monitor[ing] Midwest's competition, their products, sales and marketing activities.\" Weinberg Aff. Ex. C at 1. He also participated in weekly sales calls with the Vice\n   President of Sales and other Sales Managers nationwide. Weinberg Aff. \u00b6 17.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   As part of his promotion to Northwest Sales Manager, Midwest required Dalpe to renew his acceptance of a contract entitled \"Confidentiality, Nonsolicitation and Noncompetition Agreement.\" Weinberg Aff. Ex. B (2015 Agreement, hereinafter \"Agreement\");\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   Froelke Aff. Ex. A (2011 Agreement). Principally at issue in this motion are the Agreement's non-disclosure (\u00b6 2), non-retention (\u00b6 3), and non-compete (\u00b6\u00b6 5 and 6) provisions:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-18\">\n   2.

The Agreement also contains choice-of-law and choice-of-forum clauses providing that Minnesota law shall govern \"any disputes arising out of or in any [sic] related to this Agreement\" and that Dalpe consents to jurisdiction in Minnesota courts.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 11.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   C\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   Around December 2018, Dalpe began meeting with individuals from Laird to discuss the possibility of leaving Midwest for Laird.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   First Jenkins Decl. \u00b6\u00b6 51-55. On February 25, 2019, Laird offered Dalpe a position as the Profit Center Manager to lead Laird's Portland location.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 56. That same day, Dalpe informed Midwest that he intended to terminate his employment to work with Laird. Weinberg Aff. \u00b6\u00b6 19-20. Dalpe's last day at Midwest was March 8, 2019, and his first day at Laird was March 19, 2019. Dalpe Decl. \u00b6\u00b6 31-32.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   Both before and after meeting with Laird representatives, Dalpe sent several emails from his Midwest work account to his personal account attaching Midwest documents. Dalpe Decl. \u00b6 33; First May\n   Aff. \u00b6\u00b6 12-13. The information included Midwest's annual profit and loss statements and daily margin reports dating back to 2015, account lists and contact information for over 2,700 Midwest customers, and copies of an offer letter and employment agreement for a recently-hired Midwest sales representative.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   First May Aff. \u00b6 13. Dalpe does not dispute that this information is confidential but testifies that he did this \"in order to ensure compliance with [his] non-compete obligations and without any intention of sharing the information with Laird or using the information at Laird for competitive advantage,\" and so he could calculate his commission amount. Dalpe Decl. \u00b6\u00b6 34-35. Midwest says the \"vast majority\" of information Dalpe sent himself is not timely or pertinent to \"the method by which [his] bonus or other compensation is calculated.\" First May Aff. \u00b6 14.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   Laird has not provided a job description for Dalpe's new position except to say that Profit Center Managers in general \"lead[ ] each Laird location\" and are \"responsible for overseeing all aspects of local operations including hiring and terminating personnel, developing and implementing sales strategies, selecting suppliers, and identifying investment opportunities.\" First Jenkins Decl. \u00b6 6. Dalpe will supervise five Laird sales representatives and report to a Regional Manager. Dalpe Decl. \u00b6\u00b6 2-3; First Jenkins Decl. \u00b6 7. Laird attempts to distinguish Dalpe's role from what he did at Midwest by saying he will help \"grow its Portland Market sales by adding equipment to fabricate and process plastics,\" meaning items like \"cosmetic displays, machine guards, starwheels, pullies, rollers, and sprockets\"-something Midwest doesn't do.

Oberdorfer Aff. \u00b6\u00b6 2-3, Exs. A, B [ECF No. 8]. According to Midwest, \"[d]espite numerous written requests from Midwest's counsel, neither Laird nor Dalpe\" provided adequate assurances \"that Dalpe has ceased accessing and has destroyed Midwest confidential information,\" and Dalpe refused to \"turn over [his] personal devices for Midwest's review ... or preservation.\" Mem. in Supp. at 13;\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Oberdorfer Aff. \u00b6\u00b6 4-6, Ex.

At the hearing, Midwest suggested-Agreement aside-it would not object to Dalpe working in a territory outside the Pacific Northwest. This might very well include other territories where Midwest and Laird compete. It seems reasonable to infer from Midwest's position that its business interests adequately would be served by a geographic restriction that shares boundaries with the Pacific Northwest territory in which Dalpe worked. Consistent with its position at the hearing, Midwest has requested that the Agreement, if overbroad, be blue-penciled to include a geographic limitation coterminous with Midwest's Pacific Northwest territory. Though\n   it would narrow the Agreement's scope significantly, granting this request seems reasonable. As noted earlier, courts applying Minnesota law have blue-penciled restrictive covenants to include only \"the area where the employee performed duties, the employer's business area, the employer's customers, or a reasonable geographical area.\"\n   <em>\n    Satellite Indus.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"10654307\" index=\"39\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/nw2d/396/635/#p640\">\n    396 N.W.2d at 640\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (internal citations omitted). And doing so here would be consistent with Midwest's legitimate business interests. That territory is where Dalpe worked, his customer relationships are most likely to exist, his knowledge of Midwest's business is likely most extensive, and, it follows, where he could cause Midwest the greatest harm. But granting this request does not save the Agreement's non-compete covenants.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-51\">\n   Geography aside, the non-compete covenants-on first review in the context of a request for a preliminary injunction-appear likely to be unreasonably overbroad in their description of prohibited work. The Agreement provides that \"[f]or a period of 12 months after the termination of [his] employment (whether voluntary or involuntary), [Dalpe] will not own, work for or assist any entity that offers products or services that compete with products or services that [Midwest] offer[s].\" Agreement \u00b6 5. Nor will he \"provide products or services that compete with [Midwest's] to any entity who was a customer of [Midwest's] during [his] employment with [Midwest].\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 6. The Agreement does not define what it means by \"products or services that\n   <em>\n    compete\n   </em>\n   with products or services that [Midwest] offers.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 5 (emphasis added). This term reasonably may be understood to prohibit Dalpe from working for a remarkably broad array of potential employers. In its complaint, Midwest describes the services it offers:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-52\">\n   Midwest's primary business is to help companies in the screen printing, digital printing, and sign industries grow their business by offering general consultation services, digital printer repair and maintenance services, selection consultation and delivery of products including, but not limited to, acrylics, Alucobond, Dibond, Gatorfoam, Sintra, foamboard, styrene, banner, and most rigid and flexible industry substrates.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-53\">\n   Compl. \u00b6 12. Defendants reasonably observe that many businesses offer one or more of these products or services and hypothesize, as an example, that the Agreement's non-compete terms would prohibit Dalpe from working in an office-supply store or any similar retail business that sells any of the listed products. Mem. in Opp'n at 17. Though it characterizes Laird's position on this issue as \"ludicrous,\" Midwest has neither argued nor explained why it does not compete with office-supply or similar businesses. There is no evidence, for example, showing that Midwest customers do not also obtain products and services Midwest sells from these types of businesses. In addition to prohibiting Dalpe from working for a seemingly vast array of employers, the Agreement seems unreasonably overbroad because it would prohibit Dalpe from working in roles with these employers that are entirely dissimilar from his Northwest Sales Manager position. Hypothetically, for example, he would be prohibited from managing inventory, directing human resources, or even working as a delivery driver because each of these roles would entail \"work[ing] for ... an[ ] entity that offers products or services that compete with [Midwest's].\" Agreement \u00b6 5.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-54\">\n   The only source of a limitation that might resolve these problems (or perhaps provide a starting point for blue-penciling the Agreement to resolve them) is the\n   term \"compete.\" There may be a reasonable definition of this term that might have the effect of narrowing the reach of the Agreement's non-compete covenants, but Midwest does not identify it. Its submissions do not address its intended or preferred interpretation of this word. When asked at the hearing what \"products or services that compete with products or services that [Midwest] offers\" means, Midwest responded initially by implying that the phrase's meaning is self-evident: \"That means products or services that compete with products or services that Midwest offers.\" Midwest also suggested that the \"common, everyday reading\" of \"compete\" should be limited by how it is understood within the industry, but there is no evidence in the record suggesting an industry understanding of the term, much less one that reasonably would narrow the breadth of the restriction. Perhaps businesses like Midwest share an understanding that they do not compete with businesses-for example, retail office-supply stores-though they may sell some of the same products. But the record contains no evidence of that. Midwest does not contend that the non-compete provisions should (or may) be blue-penciled to address this issue, and the breadth of these provisions, the inability to clearly define the scope of \"products or services that compete with ... [Midwest's],\" and the absence of evidence showing the Parties' intent with respect to this issue seem to make that task impracticable and unwise.\n   <em>\n    Cf.\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Southland Metals, Inc. v.

Absent evidence of use or disclosure, CPI would need to show \"acquisition\" by \"improper means\" .... Notably, Dwyer's Confidentiality Agreement did not\n   <em>\n    per se\n   </em>\n   prohibit him from forwarding emails to his personal email account. And absent this express prohibition-or again evidence of use or disclosure-the\n   Court is hard-pressed to conclude that Dwyer's behavior falls under the definition of \"improper means.\"\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-68\">\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12523803\" index=\"63\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/294/791/#p807\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12523803\" index=\"63\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/294/791/#p807\">\n    at 809-10\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (citations omitted). The same logic applies here. For the same reasons Midwest is not likely to succeed on its breach-of-contract claim for the \"disclosure or use\" of confidential information under the non-disclosure clause of the Agreement, Midwest has not carried its burden to demonstrate that \"disclosure\" or \"use\" is satisfied for purposes of its trade-secret claims.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-69\">\n   There also is no evidence of threatened misappropriation or inevitable disclosure. As in\n   <em>\n    Lexis-Nexis\n   </em>\n   , where a departing \"sales manager\" copied a company database and hundreds of emails with sensitive company documents, \"[t]here is little evidence that [Dalpe] now possesses confidential [Midwest] information, apart from what he might retain in his memory.\"\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11621132\" index=\"64\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-2d/41/950/#p956\">\n    41 F.

To summarize, then, even if Dalpe took trade secrets with him, Midwest has not demonstrated a likelihood of success on the element of \"misappropriation,\" actual or threatened.

This tortious-interference claim, then, rises and falls on the success of Midwest's breach-of-contract claims. As discussed, the only breach-of-contract claim for which Midwest has arguably demonstrated a breach is the non-retention clause. But at this stage, there is no evidence suggesting that Laird knew about this specific contractual provision until after Dalpe announced his departure, when Midwest sent Laird a copy of Dalpe's Agreement.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Oberdorfer Decl. \u00b6 2, Ex.
