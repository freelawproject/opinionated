Thus finding that the claims failed step one of the\n   <em>\n    Mayo\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    /\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Alice\n   </em>\n   test, and after finding they also failed step two, the district court granted the defendant's motion for judgment on the pleadings.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-55\">\n   This Court agrees with Cisco that the claims in\n   <em>\n    Twilio\n   </em>\n   and\n   <em>\n    24/7 Customer\n   </em>\n   are analogous to the claim at issue here. The claims in those cases, as is the claim here, were directed to abstract ideas related to the ranking of information (whether message routing data, customer service representative profiles, or antenna performance) and taking subsequent action (whether routing of a delivery receipt, the selection of a customer service representative, or the selection of a master station) based on those rankings. As in\n   <em>\n    Twilio\n   </em>\n   , the patent here finds analogy in the brick and mortar world. Using the analogies that Judge Koh employed, the '522 patent purports to rank stations based on antenna performance, just as a prospective diner could rank restaurant choices based on the numbers of stars awarded by online reviewers.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-56\">\n   Additionally, the example of ranking antenna performance that the specification uses could be performed by a mental process. The specification gives the following \"example of a system in accordance with the present invention\":\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-57\">\n   a Bluetooth piconet comprising three devices: a laptop PC using antennas located in a slot-in PC card; a wireless headset; and a home telephony base station. The base station has the highest ranking antenna system, because of its size, possibly diversity, and a position that is not badly shadowed. The PC card has a miniature antenna and is shadowed by the PC, and therefore has a lower ranking antenna. The headset includes a very small and inefficient antenna with losses to the user's head, significant shadowing and poorly defined polarisation, and therefore has the lowest ranking antenna.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-58\">\n   Initially the network begins with communication between the PC and the headset. Because of its higher antenna ranking the PC becomes master in this piconet. When the base station joins the network, for example to enable Internet access by the PC, the base station will become master because it has the highest ranking antenna.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-59\">\n   '522 patent at 3:38-50. Nothing in the patent's process for ranking the antennas of the various devices or for making one of them the master describes anything that\n   cannot be done manually or with a mental process. Even to a lay user, the superiority of the PC's antenna to that of the headset would be obvious. The fact that ranking the antennas and preferencing the one with the highest performance could be done by a human performing a mental process thus further supports a finding that the '522 patent is directed to an abstract idea.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Intellectual Ventures I LLC v.

When asked to identify the technological solution, Uniloc stated that it is \"the using of antenna performance characteristics in view of the local environment\" as the method for determining a station's rank. But unlike in\n   <em>\n    Finjan\n   </em>\n   , where the Federal Circuit found that the method of the claim \"employ[ed] a new kind of file,\" Uniloc has been unable to identify any technological solution beyond the\n   <em>\n    idea\n   </em>\n   of using antenna performance characteristics as a way of ranking stations.\n   <em>\n    Finjan\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12267136\" index=\"99\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/879/1299/\">\n    879 F.3d at 1306\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

Rather, at the hearing, when the Court inquired whether the claim covered\n   <em>\n    any way\n   </em>\n   of using antenna performance characteristics to determine the master in a network, Uniloc answered in the affirmative-that yes, as long as it was based on using antenna performance characteristics, it was covered by the patent. In other words, the patent-in-suit claims the use of antenna performance characteristics to rank stations, but not any particular way of doing this.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-72\">\n   The Court disagrees with Uniloc that \"Claim 6 explains exactly how to achieve the desired result of a more operationally efficient ad-hoc network[.]\"\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Defs.'
