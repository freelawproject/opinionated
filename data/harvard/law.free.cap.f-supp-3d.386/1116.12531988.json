The Court has considered\n   the briefing, the oral arguments presented at the hearing on April 25, 2019, and the applicable legal authorities. The motion is GRANTED IN PART AND DENIED IN PART, WITH LEAVE TO AMEND for the reasons discussed below.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   <strong>\n    I. BACKGROUND\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   Plaintiffs allege the following facts, which are accepted as true for purposes of evaluating the motion to dismiss. At some unspecified time, Plaintiffs contacted a company called \"Sullivan\" to inquire about buying solar panels for their home. FAC \u00b6 133, ECF 32. A Sullivan representative named Hans Berg (\"Berg\") told them that panels manufactured by Defendant Bosch were of the highest quality, would last for at least twenty years, and would produce 80-90% of their rated power for the number of years specified. FAC \u00b6\u00b6 133-36. In October 2012, Plaintiffs entered into a Prepaid Solar Power Agreement with non-party Kilowatt Systems, LLC (\"Kilowatt\"), under which Plaintiffs paid $ 25,339.22 for the installation and use of forty-two Bosch c-Si M 60 NA30119 Panels on their property. FAC \u00b6 29. Sullivan installed the panels on Plaintiffs' property in a ground-mounted array in March 2013. FAC \u00b6\u00b6 139, 145.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   Bosch solar panels are covered by a \"Limited Warranty for photovoltaic modules\" (\"Limited Warranty\") covering both material and workmanship (\"Product Warranty\") and loss of performance (\"Performance Warranty\"). Limited Warranty, Exh. A to FAC. The Product Warranty guarantees that the solar panels are free of defects in material and workmanship for a period of ten years from the date of delivery. Limited Warranty \u00b6 A. The Performance Warranty guarantees that the solar panels, also referred to as the \"Module,\" will: \"a) within a period of ten years from the date of delivery provide at least 90%; and b) within a period of 25 years from the date of delivery provide at least 80% of the minimum performance set forth in the data sheet....\" Limited Warranty \u00b6 B. \"These Warranties are granted to the Consumer or shall transfer from the Consumer to subsequent buyers / end users for the remainder of the warranty period, provided the subsequent buyers / end users can show that the Modules have not been modified or relocated from their originally installed location.\" Limited Warranty \u00b6 C.1.1. The \"Consumer\" is defined as \"the final customer or end-user that properly places the Modules into operation for the first time.\" Limited Warranty \u00b6 A.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   The Limited Warranty sets forth requirements for \"Warranty Claim Verification and Procedure,\" directing that claims be submitted \"within three (3) months of the occurrence of an event placing the Consumer on notice that a claim under one of the warranties has or may have arisen.\" Limited Warranty \u00b6 C.3.4. \"All warranty claims must be accompanied by (i) the original bill of sale for the Module, and (ii) proof that (a) there is a defect in the materials and/or workmanship of the Module, or (b) the performance of the Module no longer meets the minimum performance warranted by Bosch Solar Energy Corp.\" Limited Warranty \u00b6 C.3.2. \"Module performance shall be measured by Bosch Solar Energy Corp. under standard test conditions (25\u00b0C cell temperature, irradiation 1,000 W/m\n   <sup>\n    2\n   </sup>\n   and spectrum AM 1.5),\" and \"[t]he Consumer is responsible for maintaining the standard test conditions while producing evidence that the performance has fallen below the guaranteed minimum performance.\" Limited Warranty \u00b6 C.3.3. If these requirements are met, \"[t]he sole obligation of Bosch Solar Energy Corp. under these warranties shall be, at its sole discretion, to (i) replace the Module with a functional module of the same type, (ii) remedy the defects, or (iii) refund the unamortized portion of the purchase price of\n   the Module.\" Limited Warranty \u00b6 C.2.4. If testing determines that the Module meets the minimum performance warranted, or that the failure to do so is the result of a condition not covered by the Performance Warranty, Bosch \"shall be entitled to reimbursement of the cost of conducting such tests from the party submitting the warranty claim.\" Limited Warranty \u00b6 C.3.3. Finally, the Limited Warranty provides that \"[a]ll disputes arising from this warranty shall be governed by the laws of the State of Michigan and conflict of law rules shall not apply.\" Limited Warranty \u00b6 C.3.5.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   In April 2017, Bosch issued a voluntary recall of 28,000\n   <em>\n    roof\n   </em>\n   -mounted Bosch c-Si M 60 NA30119 Panels based on a defect in the panels' solder joints that generated excessive heat, posing a risk of igniting roofing materials. FAC \u00b6\u00b6 9-11. Plaintiffs claim that the defect in the solder joints also posed a risk of igniting debris or other materials near ground-mounted installations, although ground-mounted installations were not included in the recall. FAC \u00b6\u00b6 10-12. Plaintiffs also claim that, in addition to the defective solder joints, the Bosch c-Si M 60 NA30119 Panels have a defective backsheet. FAC \u00b6 16. A backsheet is a plastic sheet that is necessary to protect the panel from moisture penetration.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \"In 2017, the Rojas requested that Bosch replace the solar system pursuant to the Bosch Recall Notice. Bosch has failed to do so despite numerous requests even after their representative informed Plaintiffs that the panels would be replaced.\" FAC \u00b6 143. \"The Rojas also provided Bosch with written notification of the breach of warranty and have requested that Bosch replace the defective panels to no avail.\" FAC \u00b6 144.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   Plaintiffs filed this putative class action on September 24, 2018, asserting claims for breach of warranty and unfair competition on behalf of all persons or entities who purchased and installed Bosch solar panels in the United States or who purchased property on which Bosch solar panels previously were installed. Compl., ECF 1. Several weeks after filing suit, Plaintiffs purchased the solar panels on their property from Kilowatt. FAC \u00b6 147, ECF 32. On January 4, 2019, Plaintiffs filed the operative FAC, alleging claims for: (1) breach of express warranty under unspecified state common law; (2) breach of express warranty under the Magnuson-Moss Warranty Act; (3) breach of express warranty under California Commercial Code \u00a7 2313 ; (4) violation of California's unfair competition law; (5) unjust enrichment; and (6) violation of California's Consumer Legal Remedy Act.

DISCUSSION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   Plaintiffs' claims may be divided into two categories. In the first category are Claims 1, 2, and 3, in which Plaintiffs assert that Defendant Bosch breached the express Limited Warranty under common law (Claim 1), the Magnuson-Moss Warranty Act (Claim 2), and California Commercial Code \u00a7 2313 (Claim 3). Specifically, Plaintiffs allege that \"Bosch has breached the Product Warranty because the panels have solder joint and delamination defects,\" and that \"Bosch has breached the Performance Warranty because Plaintiffs have experienced a degradation of power below the output promised by Bosch.\" FAC \u00b6\u00b6 195-96;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   FAC \u00b6\u00b6 204-10, 218-22. These claims appear to be limited to claims arising from the Bosch c-Si M 60 NA30119 Panels.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   In the second category are Claims 4, 5, and 6, which are grounded in the requirements for Warranty Claim Verification and Procedure. Plaintiffs contend that meeting these requirements would be impossible, because the Limited Warranty does not disclose what testing procedures would satisfy the \"standard test conditions,\" and any attempt to meet the requirements would be so costly as to equal or exceed the expense of replacing the solar panels. FAC \u00b6\u00b6 229-230, 240, 252. Plaintiffs assert that the requirements for Warranty Claim Verification and Procedure, and in particular the standard test conditions requirement, are unconscionable and violate California's Unfair Competition Law (Claim 4), results in unjust enrichment to Defendant (Claim 5), and violates California's Consumer Legal Remedies Act (Claim 6). These claims appear to encompass all models of Bosch solar panels, not just the model installed and ultimately purchased by Plaintiffs.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   Before addressing these two categories of claims in turn, the Court observes that Plaintiffs' claims are asserted primarily under California law despite express language in the Limited Warranty stating that all disputes shall be governed by Michigan law. Limited Warranty \u00b6 C.3.5. Plaintiffs allege in the FAC that the choice of law provision is \"unenforceable and unconscionable.\" FAC \u00b6 128. Defendant does not challenge that allegation in this motion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   <strong>\n    A. Claims for Breach of the Limited Warranty (Claims 1, 2 and 3)\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   Claims 1, 2, and 3 are based on Plaintiffs' allegations that Defendant breached the Limited Warranty. Claim 1 is for common law breach of express warranty under unspecified state law. Defendant's motion to dismiss assumes that Claim 1 is asserted under California law. For purposes of addressing the motion, the Court assumes the same. When they amend their pleading to address other defects discussed herein, Plaintiffs shall amend Claim 1 to make clear whether it is asserted under California law or the law of some other state(s). If Plaintiffs seek to proceed under the laws of more than one state, Plaintiffs must identify all such states and the laws in question with specificity.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   Claim 2 is asserted under the Magnuson-Moss Warranty Act (\"MMWA\"),\n   <extracted-citation index=\"12\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=15%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%202310\">\n    15 U.S.C. \u00a7 2310\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , which provides a federal claim for breach of a warranty existing under state law.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Tietsworth v.

Supp. 2d 1123\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 1143 (N.D. Cal. 2010). The MMWA claim is based on Claim 1 for breach of express warranty under common law.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   FAC \u00b6 205 (\"The allegations\n   of this Claim for Relief are based on the breaches of warranty addressed fully in the First Claim for Relief.\"). Claim 3 is for breach of express warranty under California Commercial Code \u00a7 2313.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   <strong>\n    1. State Law Warranty Claims (Claims 1 and 3)\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   Defendant argues that Claims 1 and 3, asserting breach of the Limited Warranty under California law, are subject to dismissal on several grounds. First, Defendant argues that Plaintiffs have failed to plead either privity of contract with Defendant or reasonable reliance on the terms of the express warranty. Second, Defendant asserts that Plaintiffs failed give notice of their warranty claims as required under California law and the terms of the Limited Warranty. Third, Defendant argues that the Limited Warranty precludes claims for consequential damages. Finally, Defendant asserts that Plaintiffs have not alleged fact sufficient to state a claim for breach of the Performance Warranty.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   <strong>\n    a. Privity or Reliance\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   This Court recently had occasion to consider the requirements for pleading breach of express warranty under California law in\n   <em>\n    In re Nexus 6P Prod. Liab. Litig.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12523729\" index=\"14\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/293/888/\">\n    293 F. Supp. 3d 888\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (N.D. Cal. 2018), cited by both sides here. Acknowledging that older California decisions had required either privity or reliance to assert a claim for breach of express warranty, this Court concluded that \"California has shifted its view\" such that it is possible to state a claim for breach of express warranty absent privity or actual reliance on the warranty.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12523729\" index=\"15\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/293/888/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12523729\" index=\"15\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/293/888/\">\n    at 914-15\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   In reaching that conclusion, this Court relied on\n   <em>\n    Weinstat v.

The\n   <em>\n    Weinstat\n   </em>\n   court observed that although \"Pre-Uniform Commercial Code law governing express warranties required the purchaser to prove reliance on specific promises made by the seller,\" the UCC \"does not require such proof.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 1227,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"18\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=103%20Cal.%20Rptr.%203d%20614\">\n    103 Cal.Rptr.3d 614\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Under Section 2313 of the California Commercial Code, an express warranty is created by \"[a]ny affirmation of fact or promise made by the seller to the buyer which relates to the goods and becomes part of the basis of the bargain,\" or by \"[a]ny description of the goods which is made part of the basis of the bargain.\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"19\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Cal.%20Code%20%C2%A7%202313\">\n    Cal.

An express warranty contained in product manuals or other materials given to the buyer at the time of delivery may be part of the basis of the bargain, even if such materials technically were delivered\n   <em>\n    after\n   </em>\n   the buyer paid the purchase price.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 1230-31,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"23\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=103%20Cal.%20Rptr.%203d%20614\">\n    103 Cal.Rptr.3d 614\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . The\n   <em>\n    Weinstat\n   </em>\n   court summarized the changes in warranty law effected by California's adoption of the UCC as follows: \"[t]he statute thus creates a\n   <em>\n    presumption\n   </em>\n   that the seller's affirmations go to the basis of the bargain,\" which may be rebutted only by \"clear and affirmative proof\" that the affirmations are not part of the agreement.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 1227, 1229,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"24\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=103%20Cal.%20Rptr.%203d%20614\">\n    103 Cal.Rptr.3d 614\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (emphasis added).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   Applying these principles in\n   <em>\n    Nexus\n   </em>\n   , this Court concluded that the plaintiffs' failure to plead reliance was not fatal to their\n   claims against smartphone manufacturer Huawei Device USA, Inc.

Consequential Damages\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   Defendant argues that the Limited Warranty precludes any recovery for consequential damages.

The Court agrees. \"That certain elements or forms of relief might be unavailable under a stated cause of action does not render that cause of action susceptible to a motion to dismiss.\"\n   <em>\n    Glob.

Cal. Mar. 17, 2016) (internal quotation marks and citation omitted).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-51\">\n   In its reply, Defendant asserts that the bar on consequential damages is dispositive of Claims 1 and 3 because Plaintiffs cannot seek any other types of damages permitted under the express warranty - for example, the cost of replacing their solar panels - in light of their knowledge of the alleged defects when they purchased the panels. The Court is not prepared to rule at this stage of the proceedings, and certainly not based on Defendant's one-paragraph reply argument, that Plaintiffs are precluded from recovering all types of relief ordinarily available for breach of express warranty.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-52\">\n   The motion to dismiss Claims 1 and 3 based on Defendant's assertion that consequential damages are barred is DENIED. In making this ruling, the Court expresses no opinion whether consequential damages in fact are barred under the Limited Warranty. The Court concludes only that this issue is not appropriate for adjudication on a motion to dismiss.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-53\">\n   <strong>\n    d. Performance Warranty\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-54\">\n   Defendant argues that Plaintiffs have failed to allege facts sufficient to state a claim for breach of the Performance\n   Warranty, because they assert in only conclusory fashion that \"Bosch has breached the Performance Warranty because Plaintiffs have experienced a degradation of power below the output promised by Bosch.\"\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   FAC \u00b6 196. Plaintiffs point to other allegations in FAC, alleging what power levels were promised under the express warranty, FAC \u00b6 42; that \"the inability of the Rojas's Bosch solar panels to produce the represented power levels also resulted in a breach of the Performance Warranty,\" FAC \u00b6 143; and that although Plaintiffs had \"virtually no electric bills\" when the solar panels first were installed, \"[i]n the year 2017, their electric bill jumped to nearly $ 3,000.00,\" FAC \u00b6 165. These allegations are sufficient to inform Defendant which provision of the Limited Warranty Plaintiffs contend was breached, and the nature of the breach.

Their UCL and CLRA claims are subject to dismissal on that basis, because \"to establish injury in fact in this case, Plaintiffs must do more than allege that the provisions are unconscionable - they must show that insertion of these provisions has caused or will cause them concrete harm.\"\n   <em>\n    Lee v.

Cal. Mar. 14, 2008). Plaintiffs argue that they can assert claims based on the challenged provisions of the Limited Warranty, because nothing precludes Defendant from enforcing them.

Supp. 3d 1077\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 1094 (N.D.

Plaintiffs allege that \"Plaintiffs paid Twenty-Five Thousand Three Hundred Thirty-Nine and 22/100 Dollars ($ 25,339.22) to purchase a solar power system which included the Bosch solar panels. The exact amount by which Bosch was enriched\n   will be according to proof at trial.\" FAC \u00b6 238. Plaintiffs also allege that \"Bosch was enriched by this transaction because it made a profit on the sale of the solar panels.\" FAC \u00b6 241. Plaintiffs allege that \"Bosch's enrichment came at the expense of Plaintiffs because Plaintiffs paid the purchase price from which Bosch derived its profit.\" FAC \u00b6 241. All of these allegations are entirely conclusory. Plaintiffs do not allege any facts suggesting that Bosch received any part of the purchase price Plaintiffs paid for their solar panels.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-75\">\n   Plaintiffs assert that \"Bosch has been further unjustly enriched in that the purchase price paid by Plaintiffs and Class Members did not contemplate that consumers would bear the cost of testing in order to assert a warranty claim. Bosch has refused to perform such testing, and Plaintiffs and Class Members have borne this cost.\" FAC \u00b6 240. Plaintiffs do not allege any facts showing that they incurred testing costs which should have been borne by Bosch.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-76\">\n   Plaintiffs' conclusory allegations are insufficient to state a claim for unjust enrichment. In their opposition brief, Plaintiffs argue that \"[i]t is not hard to trace the money that Plaintiffs paid for Bosch's defective solar panels up the channel to Bosch.\" Opp. at 21, ECF 38. If that is so, Plaintiffs should have little difficulty amending their unjust enrichment claim to add facts showing that Bosch was enriched at the expense of Plaintiffs.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-77\">\n   Defendant argues another basis for dismissal of the unjust enrichment claim, asserting that Plaintiffs cannot proceed on a quasi-contract theory, because \"a quasi-contract cause of action does not lie where...express binding agreements exist and define the parties' rights.\"\n   <em>\n    MH Pillars\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12419534\" index=\"65\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/277/1077/#p1094\">\n    277 F. Supp. 3d at 1094\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Plaintiff responds with citations to authorities holding that a claim for unjust enrichment need not be dismissed even if it is duplicative of other claims.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Astiana v. Hain Celestial Grp., Inc.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4149790\" index=\"66\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/783/753/#p762\">\n    783 F.3d 753\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 762-63 (9th Cir. 1915). It is not clear from the authorities cited by Defendant that the existence of an express warranty absolutely bars a claim for unjust enrichment on facts such as those alleged here. However, Plaintiffs' unjust enrichment claim is subject to dismissal on the basis that they allege in only conclusory fashion that Defendant received a benefit and unjustly retained it at Plaintiffs' expense.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-78\">\n   The motion to dismiss Claim 5 is GRANTED WITH LEAVE TO AMEND.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-79\">\n   <strong>\n    3. Procedural or Substantive Unconscionability\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-80\">\n   Defendant asserts that Plaintiffs' claims based on the allegedly unconscionable warranty provisions are subject to dismissal because Plaintiffs have not adequately alleged procedural or substantive unconscionability. The Court need not address this argument in light of its conclusion that all of Plaintiffs' claims are subject to dismissal on other grounds. However, as the Court observed at the hearing, Plaintiffs' allegations regarding procedural unconscionability are not particularly robust. For example, in order to establish oppression - a requisite element of a claim of procedural unconscionability - Plaintiffs must allege facts showing \"an inequality of bargaining power which results in no real negotiation and an absence of meaningful choice.\"\n   <em>\n    Tietsworth\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4086344\" index=\"67\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-2d/720/1123/#p1143\">\n    720 F. Supp. 2d at 1139\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . \"[A]ny claim of 'oppression' may be defeated if the complaining party had reasonably available alternative sources of supply from which to obtain the desired goods or services free of the terms claimed to be unconscionable.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4086344\" index=\"68\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-2d/720/1123/#p1143\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   Plaintiffs have not alleged facts showing that the market for solar panels was such that they had no reasonable available sources of supply. The Court urges Plaintiffs to take\n   the opportunity afforded them by this order to amend their factual allegations supporting their claim of unconscionability.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-81\">\n   <strong>\n    C. Standing to Sue on Models other than Bosch c-Si M 60 NA30119\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-82\">\n   Defendant contends that Plaintiffs lack standing to sue on models other than the Bosch c-Si M 60 NA30119 panels installed on their property. Defendants rely on\n   <em>\n    Carrea v. Dreyer's Grand Ice Cream, Inc.\n   </em>\n   , No. C 10-01044 JSW,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"69\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2011%20WL%20159380\">\n    2011 WL 159380\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *3 (N.D. Cal. Jan. 10, 2011), a food labeling case in which the district court dismissed claims based on food products not purchased by the plaintiff.\n   <em>\n    Carrea\n   </em>\n   is factually distinguishable from the present case, in which Plaintiffs allege that multiple solar panel models manufactured by Bosch were subject to the same unconscionable warranty terms. The Court therefore declines to dismiss Plaintiffs' claims based on other models based on this argument.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-83\">\n   <strong>\n    D. Suit on Behalf of Putative Nationwide Subclasses\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-84\">\n   Finally, Defendant contends that the Court may not exercise personal jurisdiction with respect to claims asserted by non-resident putative class members which arise from conduct unrelated to the state of California.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Bristol-Myers Squibb Co. v. Superior Court\n   </em>\n   , --- U.S. ----,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12604783\" index=\"70\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/137/1773/#p1782\">\n    137 S.

At the hearing, the Court indicated that it would defer consideration of the\n   <em>\n    Bristol-Myers Squibb\n   </em>\n   issue because it would not raise a complete bar to litigation in California and the FAC is deficient in numerous other respects. Defendants may raise the issue in a future motion, if appropriate.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-85\">\n   <strong>\n    IV.
