KELLY, United States District Judge\n  </author>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   Does the First Amendment permit the Federal Election Commission to regulate, through disclaimer and disclosure requirements, long-running radio ads for a person's eponymous business once that person decides to run for federal office? Leigh Brown, a realtor and recent entrant into a primary race for a House of Representatives seat, argues it does not, largely because those requirements allegedly function as an outright ban on her ability to run them under the circumstances here. The crux of this case is whether that is so and, even if it is not, whether the FEC can regulate Brown's ads in the same way it does other speech about federal candidates shortly before elections.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   Brown and her business, known as Leigh Brown &amp; Associates, seek a preliminary injunction preventing the FEC from applying these disclaimer and disclosure requirements to radio ads for the business. But because they have neither shown a likelihood of success on the merits of the claims they have pled, nor demonstrated that they are likely to suffer irreparable harm in the absence of preliminary relief, the Court declines to issue an injunction. As explained below, only one set of Brown's ads are subject to the disclaimer and disclosure requirements under the statute at issue. And those requirements do not ban Brown or her business from speaking. Further, even when, as here, the regulated speech \"only pertain[s] to a commercial transaction,\" those requirements still serve the voting public's \"interest in knowing who is speaking about a candidate shortly before an election.\"\n   <em>\n    Citizens United v.

The Court therefore ordered the parties to address at the preliminary injunction hearing whether either procedure deprived this Court of jurisdiction over Plaintiffs' constitutional claims or their motion for a preliminary injunction. The Court is satisfied that neither does.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-58\">\n   BCRA's special review procedure permits plaintiffs to request three-judge panels to hear their constitutional claims.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Indep.

This deprives a district court of jurisdiction over the merits and requires that the court \"immediately certify\n   the record and all non-frivolous constitutional questions to the\n   <em>\n    en banc\n   </em>\n   court of appeals.\"\n   <em>\n    Wagner\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3575896,3664766\" index=\"77\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/717/1007/\">\n    717 F.3d at 1009, 1011\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . At the hearing, the parties disagreed on whether this provision governs any piece of Plaintiffs' complaint: Plaintiffs asserted it covers Brown's challenge to the statutory provisions about electioneering communications, and the FEC asserted that Plaintiffs' FECA claims are too frivolous to warrant certification. But they both insisted that even if this procedure applies, it does not deprive the Court of its jurisdiction to rule on Plaintiffs' preliminary injunction motion. The Court agrees. And district courts in this Circuit have decided preliminary injunction motions under these circumstances.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.,\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Holmes v.

Indeed, one court framed the question of whether a plaintiff's ads were electioneering communications as a predicate to reaching its as-applied constitutional challenges.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Hispanic Leadership Fund, Inc. v.

As for the original ads, then, the Court proceeds with the constitutional analysis in evaluating the merits of Count I. The Court must first determine the level of scrutiny to apply in evaluating the constitutionality of the electioneering communications rules. Because the Court rejects Plaintiffs' argument that the electioneering communications rules function as an outright ban on their speech, the Court applies exacting scrutiny. Finally, the Court finds that the disclaimer and disclosure requirements that apply to electioneering communications likely withstand exacting scrutiny as applied to Brown's original ads under the rationale expounded by the Supreme Court in\n   <em>\n    Citizens United\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    .\n   </em>\n   For these reasons, Plaintiffs are not likely to succeed on the merits of Count I. In addition, Plaintiffs cannot show a likelihood of success on Count III as to the original ads\n   both because that count does not plead a cause of action and because, in any event, it appears predicated on a determination that the original ads are not electioneering communications.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-65\">\n   Plaintiffs have also not shown a likelihood of success on either of the counts related to the alternative ads. Because Brown's alternative ads likely are not electioneering communications, Plaintiffs cannot show a likelihood of success on their as-applied constitutional challenge to those ads in Count II. And notwithstanding the Court's determination that the alternative ads likely are not electioneering communications, because Count III contains no discernible cause of action, Plaintiffs have not shown a likelihood of success on that count as to the alternative ads. Ultimately, then, the Court concludes that Plaintiffs are unlikely to succeed on the merits of any of their claims.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-66\">\n   <strong>\n    1. Whether Brown's Ads Are Electioneering Communications\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-67\">\n   An electioneering communication has three elements: it refers to a clearly identified candidate, airs within 30 days before a primary election, and targets the relevant electorate.\n   <extracted-citation index=\"81\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=52%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%2030104\">\n    52 U.S.C. \u00a7 30104\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (f)(3)(A).

Thus, the Court will proceed below to the constitutional analysis applicable to the original ads in evaluating Plaintiffs' likelihood of success on Count I. In addition, Plaintiffs are unlikely to succeed on Count III as to the original ads both because that count appears to be predicated on a determination that the ads\n   are\n   <em>\n    not\n   </em>\n   electioneering communications, and, as discussed in more detail below, because Count III does not contain a cognizable cause of action.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-71\">\n   <strong>\n    b. Brown's Alternative Ads\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-72\">\n   Brown's alternative ads make only small changes to the original ads, but those changes make all the difference for purposes of determining whether they are electioneering communications under the statute. The FEC asserts that the ads \"can be viewed as referring to a clearly identified candidate\" because \"they feature Brown's actual voice\" and the ad \"twice references her firm which includes her name.\" Def.'s Opp'n at 37-38. But neither of those factors, separately or together, cause the alternative ads to \"refer[ ] to\" Brown.\n   <extracted-citation index=\"84\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=52%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%2030104\">\n    52 U.S.C. \u00a7 30104\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (f)(3)(A)(i)(I). They refer, instead, to her business.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-73\">\n   The FEC spends most of its effort arguing the significance of Brown's voicing the alternative ads herself, but it never persuasively explains why that makes them electioneering communications. It argues that \"it is permissible to find that listeners in the Charlotte area would recognize\" Brown as the speaker, Def.'s Opp'n at 38, thus causing the ad to refer to her by \"unambiguous reference,\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"85\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=52%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%2030101\">\n    52 U.S.C. \u00a7 30101\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (18)(c). But the ad itself does not provide the Court the basis to so conclude. And neither does the current record, even assuming it were proper for the Court to consider evidence relating to the recognizability of Brown's voice.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-74\">\n   The FEC's back-up argument gets it no further. The alterative ads refer to \"Leigh Brown &amp; Associates,\" the business, not to \"Leigh Brown\" the person.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Pls.' Mot. at 5-6. In fact, the FEC's characterization of its own argument aptly demonstrates why it fails. The FEC argues that the alternative ads \"twice\n   <em>\n    reference[ ] her firm\n   </em>\n   which includes her name,\" Def.'s Opp'n at 37, and \"\n   <em>\n    refer to the company\n   </em>\n   which includes the candidate's name,\" Def.'s Opp'n at 38 (emphasis added). The FEC is right.

In light of those standards, the Court cannot conclude that it is \"sufficiently likely\" that the FEC will impose the disclaimer and disclosure requirements on the alternative ads such that they would be entitled to judgment on Count II.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-78\">\n   The Court finds it reasonably clear that Plaintiffs' alternative ads likely do not fall within the statute's definition of an electioneering communication. To be sure, the argument that those ads do in fact fit within that definition and thus are subject to the disclaimer and disclosure requirements is \"arguable\"; indeed, when Plaintiffs sought an advisory opinion from the FEC finding that the ads were not electioneering communications, it declined to issue it. But declining to issue an advisory opinion is a far cry from undertaking enforcement action. Particularly telling is that, even before the Court's determination, three of the four commissioners concluded that the alternative ads\n   <em>\n    were not\n   </em>\n   electioneering communications.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Am. Compl. Ex. C at 2; Audio of FEC Consideration of AOR 2019-06 at Its April 11, 2019 Open Meeting, https://www.fec.gov/resources/cms-content/documents/2019041105.mp3 (relevant discussion from 41:40 to 42:09). Otherwise, Plaintiffs have not pointed to any instance in which the FEC took such action against comparable ads. And the Court, especially in light of its conclusions here, has no reason to suspect that the FEC will engage in enforcement action under these circumstances.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-79\">\n   It is not enough to simply show a colorable argument that intended future conduct might be subject to a challenged statutory provision. To ultimately succeed on their constitutional claim, Plaintiffs must demonstrate that there actually exists a likelihood that the FEC will undertake enforcement action if they engage in that conduct, and the record before the Court is simply insufficient to so conclude. Thus, without any reasonable expectation that the FEC will, in fact, apply the disclaimer and disclosure rules against the alternative ads, the Court cannot conclude that Plaintiffs have demonstrated a likelihood of success on Count II.\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-80\">\n   Plaintiffs are also unlikely to succeed on the merits of Count III as to the alternative ads, but for a much more elementary reason. Count III contains no discernible cause of action. In that count, Plaintiffs request a judgment from the Court declaring that the ads are not electioneering communications under the statute.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Am. Compl. at 23. And to be sure, in undertaking the analysis relevant to the constitutional causes of action pled in Count II, the Court has in effect agreed with Plaintiffs on this point. But that does not relieve Plaintiffs of their burden to show a likelihood of success on a cause of action pled in the amended complaint, which is, beyond any doubt, required for a preliminary injunction. And simply put, Count III does not aid them in meeting that burden. The thrust of Count III is that the ads are not electioneering communications under BCRA for various reasons, but it alleges no underlying legal right that would entitle Plaintiffs to a judgment reflecting a freestanding determination that that is so.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 89-104.

Whether the FEC Rules Are a Ban on Plaintiffs' Speech\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-83\">\n   Count I remains. Having decided that the disclaimer and disclosure requirements likely apply to Brown's original ads, the Court next looks to the consequences of that application. As explained above, Plaintiffs argue that the electioneering communications rules and the coordinated communications ban put them in a quandary; they contend that the only way they can comply with all of them is to not run the ads at all. Pls.' Mot. at 14. The disclaimer they would have to include at the end of the radio ads would, Plaintiffs assert, cause them to be subject to the ban on coordinated communications.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 15. And as such, because the electioneering communications rules function as an outright ban on her speech, they must be subject to strict scrutiny, which they cannot survive.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 12, 20.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-84\">\n   The FEC argues that Brown's ads fall within the safe harbor to the coordinated communications ban for ads proposing commercial transactions, so there is no quandary. Def.'s Opp'n at 22. But Plaintiffs protest that the safe harbor cannot relieve them of the coordinated communications ban because the safe harbor does not apply to ads that promote, attack, support, or oppose the candidate they identify. ECF No. 15 at 10-11;\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"99\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=11%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%20109.21\">\n    11 C.F.R. \u00a7 109.21\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (i). And as Plaintiffs' counsel clarified at the hearing on the instant motion, Plaintiffs contend that merely adding the electioneering communications disclaimer to the end of the original ads-that is, saying that Brown had authorized them-would necessarily promote or support Brown as a candidate and therefore disqualify them from the safe harbor.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-85\">\n   The Court agrees with the parties that whether Brown's original ads fall within the safe harbor dictates whether she can lawfully air them under the coordinated communications rules. But the answer to that question does not dictate whether a preliminary injunction is warranted here. Plaintiffs have challenged only the disclaimer and disclosure requirements for electioneering communications and ask only for an injunction that would prohibit the FEC from applying them to the ads.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Am. Compl. \u00b6 1; ECF No. 12-2 at 1. Moreover, at the hearing on the instant\n   motion, Plaintiffs' counsel explicitly disclaimed challenging the coordinated communications ban or the safe harbor.\n   <footnotemark>\n    8\n   </footnotemark>\n   Thus, the coordinated communications ban and the safe harbor are before the Court only to the extent that the disclaimer and disclosure requirements impact their application to Brown's ads.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-86\">\n   As described above, Plaintiffs argue that the disclaimer and disclosure rules impact the application of the coordinated communications ban and safe harbor to Brown's original ads in two ways: (1) if Plaintiffs include a disclaimer saying that Brown authorized the ads and file a report saying she helped create them, the ads will become coordinated communications and therefore be prohibited; and (2) the disclaimer would necessarily promote or support Brown, so that they could not then rely on the safe harbor. But neither theory withstands scrutiny. First, whether the ads are coordinated has nothing to do with what Brown says in the ad or reports to the FEC about the ad; all that matters is whether Brown did, in fact, work with her company to create the ad.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"100\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=11%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%20109.21\">\n    11 C.F.R. \u00a7 109.21\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (d)(2) (treating communications as coordinated if the candidate is \"materially involved in decisions regarding\" the ad). Here, Brown has \"written and recorded\" both sets of ads, Am. Compl. Ex. D \u00b6 39, so the coordinated communications ban applies irrespective of any disclaimer she includes or report she files.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-87\">\n   Nor do the disclaimer and disclosure requirements affect the availability of the safe harbor for commercial transactions. To comply with the disclaimer rule for electioneering communications, Brown merely has to say that she authorized the ad and her business paid for it.\n   <extracted-citation index=\"101\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=11%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%20110.11\">\n    11 C.F.R. \u00a7 110.11\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (c). Neither statement \"promotes\" or \"supports\" her in any way.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-88\">\n   Because the disclaimer and disclosure requirements challenged by Plaintiffs do not affect whether the coordinated communications ban applies to them, the quandary that purportedly censors their speech arises from a regulatory scheme entirely separate from the one they have challenged here. Put another way, even if the Court granted a preliminary injunction enjoining the FEC from applying the disclaimer and disclosure rules to Brown's original ads, it would not affect whether these communications were coordinated, or whether the safe harbor applied to them. The constitutionality of the coordinated communications ban and its effect on Plaintiffs here are simply not before the Court.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-89\">\n   The only parts of the purported quandary that are before the Court, as pled in the amended complaint and as reflected in the preliminary relief sought by Plaintiffs, are the application of BCRA's disclaimer and disclosure requirements to Brown's original ads. And the Supreme Court has determined that because those rules do not prohibit speech, they are subject only to exacting scrutiny.\n   <footnotemark>\n    9\n   </footnotemark>\n   <em>\n    Citizens United\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3639027\" index=\"102\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/558/310/#p369\">\n    558 U.S. at 366\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3639027\" index=\"103\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/558/310/#p369\">\n    130 S.Ct. 876\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-90\">\n   <strong>\n    3.

This is so because they refer to her-the candidate-regardless of the nature of any message they may convey to the electorate. In\n   <em>\n    Citizens United\n   </em>\n   , the Court held that the disclaimer requirement was substantially related to an informational interest because it \"avoid[s] confusion\" and \"mak[es] clear that the ads are not funded by a candidate or political party.\"\n   <em>\n    Citizens United\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3639027\" index=\"136\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/558/310/#p369\">\n    558 U.S. at 368\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3639027\" index=\"137\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/558/310/#p369\">\n    130 S.Ct. 876\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . That interest is served here as well: a disclaimer stating that Leigh Brown &amp; Associates paid for the ads clarifies for listeners that they were not paid for by Brown's campaign, an opponent, or some other third party. The Court also concluded that the disclaimer and disclosure requirements served this informational interest by informing voters \"who is speaking about [the] candidate shortly before [the] election\" even though the speech at issue was related to \"a commercial transaction.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3639027\" index=\"138\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/558/310/#p369\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3639027\" index=\"138\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/558/310/#p369\">\n    at 369\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3639027\" index=\"139\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/558/310/#p369\">\n    130 S.Ct. 876\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . That interest is also satisfied in this case-again, notwithstanding the fact that the ads are commercial in nature.

In an opinion authored by Judge Tymkovich, the Tenth Circuit rejected the argument. First, it held that the reasoning of\n   <em>\n    Citizens United\n   </em>\n   precluded the distinction urged by the plaintiff:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-101\">\n   The Court did not rest its holding on the ground that the public only has an interest in knowing who\n   <em>\n    references a campaign\n   </em>\n   shortly before an election. Rather, the Court upheld the application of the statute because of the public's interest \"in knowing who is\n   <em>\n    speaking about a candidate\n   </em>\n   shortly before an election.\"\n   <em>\n    Citizens United\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3639027\" index=\"156\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/558/310/#p369\">\n    558 U.S. at 369\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3639027\" index=\"157\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/558/310/#p369\">\n    130 S.

The logic of\n   <em>\n    Citizens United\n   </em>\n   is that advertisements that mention a candidate shortly before an election\n   <em>\n    are\n   </em>\n   deemed sufficiently campaign-related to implicate the government's interests in disclosure.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-102\">\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3639027\" index=\"158\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/558/310/#p369\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-103\">\n   Second, the Tenth Circuit noted that whether an ad is \"campaign-related\" was not, in any event, a workable constitutional test: \"The difficulty of reliably distinguishing between campaign-related speech and non-campaign-related speech is why courts must look only to whether the specific statutory definitions before them are sufficiently tailored to the government's legitimate interests.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3639027\" index=\"159\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/558/310/#p369\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   The Court shares this concern about drawing the same sorts of distinctions Plaintiffs urge upon it here, even though the speech at issue is commercial, and not issue-related.
