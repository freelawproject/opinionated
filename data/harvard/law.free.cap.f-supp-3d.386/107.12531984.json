(\"ABC\") and Marcia Berger brought this action against DRS Power Technology, Inc. (\"DRS\"), asserting claims relating to a contract for the excavation and environmental evaluation of a project site. DRS, a defense contractor for the United States Navy, hired ABC as a subcontractor to excavate the site in preparation for the installation of a tank for the Navy. ABC allegedly ran into unforeseen difficulties during the excavation that dramatically increased project costs, but was assured by DRS that ABC would be paid for the additional expense. At the conclusion of the project, the parties were unable to reach an agreement as to the\n   proper amount owed. ABC filed suit on August 4, 2018, asserting a claim under Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 93A (\"ch. 93A\") (Count I), a claim for breach of contract (Count II), and a claim for negligent infliction of emotional distress (\"NIED\") (Count III).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   This matter is presently before the court on the \"Defendant's Motion to Dismiss\" (Docket No. 6), wherein the defendant asserts that the plaintiffs' ch. 93A claim and NIED claim must be dismissed.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   For the reasons detailed herein, this court concludes that ABC has failed to make out a claim under Mass. Gen. Laws. ch. 93A or a claim for negligent infliction of emotional distress. Therefore, DRS's Motion to Dismiss is ALLOWED as to Counts I and III of the plaintiffs' Complaint.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   <strong>\n    II.\n    <em>\n     STATEMENT OF FACTS\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   This court summarizes the facts as alleged in the plaintiffs' Complaint, with additional uncontested facts where noted. Marcia Berger is the president of ABC, an environmental and excavation company headquartered in Massachusetts. (Docket No. 1 (\"Complaint\") at 1). DRS is a major defense contractor that works extensively with the United States Navy. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   In 2014, DRS entered into a contract with ABC for ABC to install a sub-floor tank pit at a DRS facility in Massachusetts and to perform associated environmental clean-up. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 5, 7). The purchase order for the transaction specified that the upper budget for the project was $235,000 and that the cost of all work performed within the scope of the project was not to exceed $335,000 without the approval of DRS. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 13, Ex. A). The purchase order incorporated the terms of a task order that ABC had submitted to DRS. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b611). The task order indicated that \"Should the work extend beyond the scope of work outlined herein, The Client [DRS] agrees to pay for all additional expenses incurred by ABC Soils.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 12).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   During the excavation, ABC discovered unanticipated environmental contamination and subsurface debris. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 16). Specifically, the site was found to contain industrial debris, such as oven parts and railroad tracks, as well as concrete and other debris contaminated with polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs). (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 17, 19). As a result, ABC was forced to engage in significant environmental remediation and removal on the project site. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 18). To properly treat the contaminated debris and concrete, ABC had to power wash the debris before removing it for off-site disposal. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 20). Additionally, ABC discovered that a concrete floor on site was five feet thick and reinforced with rebar and steel mesh, necessitating significant expense to remove it. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 22, 23).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   Following the excavation, DRS requested that the pit be made deeper and larger, resulting in a 10.2% increase in volume from what had originally been agreed upon. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 33). At the same time, DRS instructed ABC not to excavate to groundwater level, which forced ABC to undertake additional procedures to comply with the request. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 34). ABC was required to install special, custom-built concrete\n   forms into the pit due to the jagged and uneven nature of the excavation. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 36). ABC had to remove heavy timbers from the excavation site as the concrete forms were installed, which cost additional time and effort. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 37).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   ABC notified DRS of the cost increases associated with the PCB contamination and extensive debris. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 26). DRS employees were also on site daily to witness the progress of the excavation. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 27). A project manager for DRS assured ABC that ABC would be compensated for the additional work. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 28). Officers for the United States Navy also surveyed the project site and pressured ABC to finish the project. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 29).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   As a result of the unexpected subsurface conditions, ABC incurred expenses well in excess of original cost estimates for the project. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 38-39). DRS has allegedly refused to fully compensate ABC for these additional costs, despite its earlier promise. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 44). At one point, negotiations as to the amount due to ABC were ongoing, but stalled after a large staff reorganization at DRS. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 43). To date, DRS has paid ABC $175,000. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 42). The plaintiffs allege that DRS owes ABC an additional $275,941.97 plus interest. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 45). DRS offered to settle the parties' payment dispute for $121, 520, but ABC rejected the offer as insufficient and significantly less than what was contractually owed. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 46).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   As a result of DRS's unwillingness to pay what ABC believes it is owed, ABC was forced to cut back on expenses and reduce its staff. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 47). ABC lost a key employee who took approximately $500,000 in business with him when he left. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 50). ABC was also forced to borrow money to make up for the loss in revenue. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 49). Plaintiff Berger began working longer hours to cover company overhead. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 48). As a result, Ms. Berger lost sleep, experienced anxiety and headaches, and missed out on time with her family. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 51). Ms. Berger's son experienced difficulties in school, further exacerbating her emotional distress. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 52). As a result of the financial hardship on Ms. Berger, tensions arose in her marriage and her spouse ultimately filed for divorce. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 53).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   Additional facts will be provided below where appropriate.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   <strong>\n    III.\n    <em>\n     ANALYSIS\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   <strong>\n    A.\n    <em>\n     Standard of Review\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   Motions to dismiss under Rule 12(b)(6) test the sufficiency of the pleadings.

Gen. Laws ch. 93A, arguing that the plaintiffs have failed to set forth any factual allegations amounting to unfair or deceptive conduct. As an initial matter, the plaintiffs assert that the validity of their ch. 93A claim is a question of fact that should not be evaluated on a motion to dismiss. To be sure, liability under ch. 93A \"is decided case-by-case, and Massachusetts courts have consistently emphasized the fact-specific nature of the inquiry.\"\n   <em>\n    Arthur D. Little, Inc. v.

Here, the plaintiffs assert that the implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing that adheres to the parties' contractual relationship creates such a duty. Assuming, without deciding, that the covenant of good faith and fair dealing extends beyond the parties to the agreement-ABC and DRS-to include Ms. Berger personally, this is still insufficient to establish a legal duty. A breach of the implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing \"gives rise to a contract action, not one for negligence[,]\" and thus does not create such a duty.\n   <em>\n    Islam v.

Although the court in\n   <em>\n    Chery\n   </em>\n   made reference to \"emotional distress,\" the plaintiffs overstate its relevance. The court in\n   <em>\n    Chery\n   </em>\n   merely held that evidence of emotional distress may be used to satisfy the injury or harm element of a ch. 93A claim; it has no bearing on the ability of a plaintiff to establish the existence of a legal duty. In\n   <em>\n    Chery\n   </em>\n   there was no question that the insurer owed its insured a duty. For the reasons described above, however, no such legal duty exists here.

The plaintiffs have since been granted leave to amend the complaint to correct this deficiency. (\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    Docket No. 16). At a hearing held before the court on June 5, 2019 on the defendant's Motion to Dismiss, the defendant conceded that it was no longer seeking to dismiss the plaintiffs' Complaint in its entirety in light of the amendment correcting the error.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"2\">\n   <p id=\"p-41\">\n    In their opposition to the Motion to Dismiss, the plaintiffs assert that their ch. 93A claim is viable under the doctrine of quantum meruit.
