(Order (Dkt. No. 89).) We assume familiarity with that opinion and repeat here only as necessary. At the motion to dismiss stage, we accept all well-pleaded factual allegations in the counterclaim as true and draw all inferences in the plaintiff's favor.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   <em>\n    Cole v.

Maui Jim is a designer, manufacturer, and provider of prescription and non-prescription sunglasses. (2d Am. Compl. (Dkt. No. 257) \u00b6 16.) SBG is an online retailer of luxury designer eyewear. (2d Am. Countercl. (Dkt. No. 259) \u00b6 13.) It sells products from more than 180 designer brands, including Maui Jim, on its websites in twenty countries.

Instead, SBG asserts that the Maui Jim frames and non-prescription lenses SBG sells are \"100% genuine,\" and that SBG customers also receive prescription lenses \"fabricated through [SBG] by a premium optical laboratory.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   )\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   SBG's amended responsive pleading asserts counterclaims against Maui Jim for trade disparagement (Count I); defamation (Count II); violation of the Sherman Antitrust Act,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=15%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201\">\n    15 U.S.C. \u00a7 1\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    et seq.\n   </em>\n   (Count III); violation of California's Cartwright Act,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Cal.%20Code%20%C2%A7%2016700\">\n    Cal.

(\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 33-94.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   SBG alleges it brings its counterclaims \"to compensate it for, and put an end to, Maui Jim's ongoing illegal campaign to stifle competition.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 1.) According to SBG, Maui Jim \"seeks to eradicate lawful competition and monopolize control over its worldwide supply chain, allowing it to illegally prop up prices of its eyewear.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 2.) SBG further alleges Maui Jim's efforts to stifle competition from discount retailers include Maui Jim's alleged attempt to \"exploit recent xenophobia by engaging in a negative public relations campaign that painted SmartBuyGlasses as a dishonest, foreign counterfeiter.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 2, 26.) In furtherance of its efforts, SBG alleges Maui Jim issued a press release dated January 23, 2017, which included the following statement from Maui Jim's Vice President of Global Marketing:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-16\">\n   Companies that utilize these types of disingenuous and misleading sales practices undermine the integrity of the Maui Jim brand and the quality and technology it has come to represent .... [Maui Jim] simply cannot allow our brand to be harmed by the sale of counterfeit or non-genuine Maui Jim products that do not live up to our-and most importantly our customers'-expectations.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 28.) SBG also alleges that Maui Jim's corporate headquarters and customer service representatives falsely instructed potential customers that SBG sells \"fake\" or inauthentic products, and that\n   SBG is \"not an authentic website.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 29.) Maui Jim has allegedly made the same claims of inauthenticity to United States customs officials. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 30.) Moreover, SBG asserts Maui Jim \"used this case to discover and then attempt to eviscerate SmartBuyGlasses' supply chain\" by cancelling accounts with certain SBG suppliers after they were confidentially disclosed in discovery. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 31.) SBG alleges that it has been harmed in the marketplace as a result of Maui Jim's actions. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 32.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   Separately, SBG alleges that Maui Jim has entered into anticompetitive agreements with its distributors to maintain minimum retail prices and to restrict to whom distributors can sell. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 52.) Maui Jim has allegedly threatened to terminate and has actually terminated retailers that have sold authentic goods to SBG. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 56, 68.) As a result of these agreements, SBG claims that consumers paid artificially high prices for Maui Jim sunglasses and that SBG's business was injured by Maui Jim's efforts to eliminate SBG's supply of Maui Jim sunglasses. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 58.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   In addition, SBG alleges that it \"sources the vast majority of its Maui Jim product from Member States within the European Union, and the alleged restrictive contracts at issue (particularly with respect to Maui Jim's tortious interference with contract claims) all involve retailers in the European Union.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 88.) SBG claims that these contracts and Maui Jim's \"actions to discover and close the accounts of [SBG's] suppliers within the European Union\" caused SBG damage and violate European antitrust law.

Specifically, Maui Jim argues SBG fails to allege the required elements of a trade disparagement claim (Count I); fails to plead defamation (Count II) with particularity or fails to state a claim because some of the allegedly defamatory statements are substantially true or constitute non-actionable opinion statements; does not allege an antitrust injury or a plausible relevant market in its federal antitrust claim (Count III); and fails to identify which counterclaimant has standing to sue under European antitrust law (Count VI).

(2d Am. Countercl. \u00b6\u00b6 87-89.) Maui Jim mounts three attacks on this claim. First, in its Rule 12(b)(6) motion to dismiss, Maui Jim argues that SBG fails to plead with specificity which defendant brings the EU Antitrust Claim. (Mem. at 21-22.) Second and third, Maui Jim asserts in a separate motion that the EU Antitrust Claim should be dismissed based on the principle of\n   <em>\n    forum non conveniens\n   </em>\n   , or, in the alternative, international comity. (Dkt. No. 196.) Although principles of international comity are central to this claim, they are best considered within the doctrine of\n   <em>\n    forum non conveniens\n   </em>\n   , which here counsels dismissal.

As Maui Jim points out, (MJ EU Mem. at 8-9), SBG's allegations reveal that the EU Antitrust Claim and underlying evidence are centered almost exclusively in Europe. SBG alleges that it \"sources the vast majority of its Maui Jim product from Member States within the European Union, and the alleged restrictive contracts at issue ... all involve retailers in the European Union.\" (2d Am Countercl. \u00b6 88.) It also alleges that \"Maui Jim's anticompetitive actions caused the restriction of trade between retailers in the European Union and [SBG].\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   )\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-90\">\n   SBG faults Maui Jim for failing to identify specific witnesses or documents that would be difficult to obtain outside of Europe. (SBG EU Resp. at 5-6.) SBG also argues that the availability of compulsory process in Europe is at best a neutral factor because the subject matter of Maui Jim's affirmative Lanham Act and tortious interference claims cover the same subject matter as SBG's EU Antitrust Claim and would produce overlapping evidence. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 6-8.) SBG contends further that documents concerning European supply chains and contractual arrangements \"are not only accessible but have also been accessed and are being produced.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 8.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-91\">\n   In reply, Maui Jim vigorously disputes that any such production of evidence from SBG has occurred. (Dkt. No. 238 (\"MJ EU Reply\") at 10;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   Dkt. No. 234 (Order staying antitrust discovery).) Maui Jim also argues that while its tortious interference claim is limited to the United States and Italy, SBG's EU Antitrust Claim has a much wider potential scope covering several European countries or the whole of Europe, while not including the United States. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 3.) Maui Jim's Lanham Act claims, moreover, do not appear to require application of European law, and SBG does not explain how this subject matter would overlap with its EU Antitrust Claim. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 6.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-92\">\n   We agree with Maui Jim that, while its affirmative tortious interference claim may require evidence centered in Italy and the United States, the potential reach of SBG's EU Antitrust Claim weighs in favor of dismissal because most of the evidence regarding this claim is likely to be in Europe. SBG's point is well taken that compulsory process in Europe may be a wash, depending on the course of litigation of Maui Jim's claims regarding agreements in European countries. On balance, though, the private interest factors weigh slightly toward dismissal on\n   <em>\n    forum non conveniens\n   </em>\n   grounds.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-93\">\n   <strong>\n    2. Public Interest Factors\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-94\">\n   Maui Jim and SBG also dispute relevant the public interest factors. Maui Jim contends that congestion in this district warrants dismissal, that Europe's local interest is better vindicated by hearing SBG's EU Antitrust Claim in a European Union member state, and that applying the governing European Union law and burdening a domestic jury with European Union law favors dismissal.

(2d Am. Countercl. \u00b6 92.) Maui Jim argues that this allegation \"seeks to penalize Maui Jim under an antitrust theory for filing this lawsuit\" in contravention of\n   <em>\n    Noerr\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    -\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Pennington\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    .\n   </em>\n   (MJ Cal.

(SBG Cal. Resp. at 13; 2d Am. Countercl. \u00b6\u00b6 41.) Indeed, similar allegations in SBG's original counterclaims led us to conclude that its claim for unjust\n   enrichment could survive the earlier motion to dismiss. As we stated then:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-109\">\n   Taking SmartBuyGlasses' allegations as true, it has set forth a plausible claim that Maui Jim publicized false allegations and commentary regarding SmartBuyGlasses' products in a press release, thereby wrongfully disparaging SmartBuyGlasses' business and falsely asserting it sells counterfeit products. (Counterclaim \u00b6\u00b6 2, 29, 34-35.) SmartBuyGlasses alleges it has suffered harm in the marketplace as a result. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 35.) The counterclaim therefore connects Maui Jim's unjust benefit (increased prices of its products due to its allegedly anti-competitive and fraudulent conduct) to a detriment to SmartBuyGlasses (disparagement of its products as counterfeit).\n   <em>\n    Cleary\n   </em>\n   [\n   <em>\n    v.

As a result, SmartBuyGlasses' allegations in Count VIII [for unjust enrichment] are sufficient to survive dismissal at this stage.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-110\">\n   (Order at 16.) Although, in the present opinion, we grant in part Maui Jim's motion to dismiss SBG's defamation claim based on the press release referenced in the above passage, we also deny in part that motion based on other alleged defamation that goes beyond this suit,\n   <em>\n    see supra\n   </em>\n   Part II(A). \"[I]f an unjust enrichment claim rests on the same improper conduct alleged in another claim, then the unjust enrichment claim will be tied to this related claim-and, of course, unjust enrichment will stand or fall with the related claim.\"\n   <em>\n    Cleary\n   </em>\n   , 656 F.3d at 517.

The\n   <em>\n    Noerr\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    -\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Pennington\n   </em>\n   doctrine thus does not bar this claim, because it covers allegations going beyond the current suit.

MOTION TO STRIKE AFFIRMATIVE DEFENSES\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-112\">\n   In addition to its motions to dismiss, Maui Jim also moves under Rule 12(f) to strike two affirmative defenses that SBG pleaded in its answer. (Dkt. No. 278 \u00b6\u00b6 3-4.) We consider each argument in turn.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-113\">\n   <strong>\n    A.

No. 259) at 31.) This affirmative defense reads:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-115\">\n   Maui Jim's use of its trademarks in violation of the antitrust laws precludes enforcement of the trademarks at issue on both equitable grounds and under \u00a7 33(b)(7) of Lanham Act. 15 UCSC \u00a7 1115(b)(7). Plaintiffs are attempting to misuse their trademarks to acquire a monopoly in violation of U.S. antitrust laws.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-116\">\n   (Answer at 31.) Maui Jim argues first that this defense should be stricken because it depends on SBG's deficient Sherman Act claim. (MJ Cal. Mem. at 15.) Maui Jim also argues that under the\n   <em>\n    Noerr\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    -\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Pennington\n   </em>\n   doctrine, SBG is foreclosed from arguing that Maui Jim is using its suit against SBG to violate antitrust laws. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 16-18.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-117\">\n   SBG agrees that its Sherman Act claim is \"coterminous\" with its first affirmative defense, and the allegation that Maui Jim is \"attempting to misuse their trademarks to acquire a monopoly in violation of U.S. antitrust laws\" refers to SBG's Sherman Act claim, not to Maui Jim's lawsuit. (SBG Cal. Resp. at 9; Answer at 31.) As SBG's Sherman Act claim is dismissed,\n   <em>\n    see supra\n   </em>\n   Part III, its \"coterminous\" defense also fails.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-118\">\n   However, SBG argues that Section 33(b)(7) of the Lanham Act can operate as an independent affirmative defense. (SBG Cal. Resp. at 10-11.) Section 33(b)(7) allows a defense if a \"mark has been or is being used to violate the antitrust laws of the United States.\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"251\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=15%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201115\">\n    15 U.S.C. \u00a7 1115\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (b)(7).
