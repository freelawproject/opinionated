KELLY, United States District Judge\n  </author>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   In June 2017, American Oversight submitted three requests to the Environmental Protection Agency for communications records under the Freedom of Information Act. The EPA, determining that each request did not reasonably describe the records sought, told American Oversight that it could not process its requests without additional clarification. American Oversight disagreed, arguing that its requests as written reasonably described the records it was seeking, and declined to provide additional clarification. The EPA consequently denied the requests.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   American Oversight then sued, claiming that the EPA unlawfully refused to process its requests under FOIA. It sought to compel the agency to conduct searches and release any non-exempt, responsive records. Over the course of this proceeding, the parties resolved their disputes about American Oversight's three requests. But that did not end the matter. American Oversight also alleges that the EPA's refusals to process those requests resulted from an unlawful policy or practice, and it seeks an injunction prohibiting the EPA from continuing to apply that alleged policy to future requests. The parties have cross-moved for summary judgment on this remaining claim.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   American Oversight argues specifically that the EPA maintains a policy or practice of refusing to process any request for communications records unless it provides a subject matter or keyword for the search. The record, however, tells a different story. The EPA's responses to American Oversight's requests, and the requests from other organizations that American Oversight holds up in support of its claim, vary depending on the specifics-or lack thereof-of each request. For almost all\n   the requests identified by American Oversight, the absence of an identified subject matter or keywords was one of multiple reasons the EPA asserted it was not reasonably described and requested more information to process it. And the EPA provides several examples of requests it agreed to process that\n   <em>\n    did not\n   </em>\n   include subject matters or keywords. Thus, the record cannot sustain American Oversight's claim that the EPA has a policy of refusing to process a request unless it receives subject matters or keywords.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   Accordingly, and for the reasons explained below, the EPA's Partial Motion for Summary Judgment, ECF No. 11, will be granted and American Oversight's Motion for Summary Judgment, ECF No. 8, will be denied.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   <strong>\n    I.

Analysis\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   American Oversight contends that the EPA has adopted a policy of refusing to process FOIA requests for communications records that do not provide specific keywords or subject matters. Specifically, it describes that alleged policy in its complaint as \"a policy, pattern, or practice of declining to process FOIA requests for communications that clearly identify the custodians, recipients, and date range for the records sought on the grounds that they do not provide keywords, search terms, or a particular subject matter.\" Compl. \u00b6 41. As evidence of this alleged policy, American Oversight points to the three June 2017 FOIA requests cited in its complaint, as well as three additional FOIA requests submitted to the EPA by American Oversight and other similar organizations over the past few years.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 26-40. According to American Oversight, each of those requests \"reasonably described\" the records sought, thus triggering the EPA's obligation to conduct a search, but the agency refused to do so because the requests failed to provide \"a keyword or a search term that could be used to narrow the scope of the request.\" Pl.'s MSJ at 11-12. And that recurrent response, American Oversight contends, manifests a practice by the EPA of unlawfully refusing to process a proper FOIA request because it does not provide a keyword or search term.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 11;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 13 (\"[T]he EPA refused to process [the] requests unless American Oversight provided a subject matter or search term for use in processing the request.\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   The EPA disputes that its responses to American Oversight's three June 2017 requests were improper, and it argues further that even if any of them were, they did not result from an \"impermissible\" policy or practice that violates FOIA. Def.'s MSJ at 10-14. On the first point, the EPA maintains that it \"reasonably determined that [American Oversight's] three FOIA requests ... did not adequately describe the records sought,\" and therefore \"[p]ermissibly [s]ought [c]larification.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 10. But even if any of American Oversight's requests did adequately describe the records sought, the EPA asserts, its responses were based on individualized assessments of the requests, and not the result of a broader policy or practice that violates FOIA.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 12-16. For each request, the EPA argues, it provided a response \"tailored to the perceived deficiencies of that specific request\" and \"identifying the additional information needed.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 13. And as further evidence that it does not employ a practice of denying FOIA requests for communications records unless they contain a subject matter or keywords, the EPA proffers three recent examples of requests the EPA processed that\n   <em>\n    did not\n   </em>\n   include those details.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   White Decl. \u00b6 19; Def.'s Ex.

According to the complaint, the alleged \"policy or practice\" underlying its claim is a refusal to process an otherwise reasonably described request for communications records that \"clearly identif[ies] the custodians, recipients, and date range for the requested records on the grounds that they do not specify keywords, search terms, or a particular subject matter.\" Compl. \u00b6 47;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   Pl.'s MSJ at 11-12 (arguing that the six instances identified of \"refus[ing] to process FOIA requests that clearly described the requested records on the grounds that the requester had not provided a keyword or search term that could be used to narrow the scope of the request ... constitutes a policy or practice of improperly denying reasonably described FOIA requests in violation of FOIA\"). No doubt, categorically refusing to process any request for communications records unless that request provided a keyword or search term\n   <em>\n    would\n   </em>\n   violate FOIA.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   But American Oversight must demonstrate that the unlawful FOIA policy described above is in fact a policy \"adopted, endorsed, or implemented\" by the EPA.\n   <em>\n    Muttitt\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5889782\" index=\"55\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-2d/926/284/#p293\">\n    926 F. Supp. 2d at 293\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . And the undisputed record demonstrates that the EPA engaged in a case-by-case approach to each request that found them lacking for distinct reasons. Significantly, Elizabeth White, the EPA official overseeing FOIA requests submitted to the EPA's Office of the Administrator, disclaims the existence of the alleged policy in her declaration, stating that all FOIA requests are reviewed individually and that \"[w]hile some requests require [a] subject matter or keyword in order to conduct a search, other requests may not.\" White Decl. \u00b6 5. That declaration, of course, is not dispositive, but the record of requests and EPA responses before the Court provides little\n   evidence to contradict it. Indeed, the EPA's responses to the several FOIA requests identified by American Oversight in its complaint, as outlined below, show a practice not of categorically denying any request that lacks keywords or subject matters, but of seeking clarification of requests that the EPA has concluded for various reasons-many of which appear to have been justified-are not reasonably described.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   Turning first to American Oversight's requests highlighted in the complaint, of the EPA's responses to those three requests, only one-the response to the Pruitt Communications FOIA-concluded that the request did not \"reasonably define a set of records to search\" solely because the request \"fail[ed] to provide details such as the subject matters, titles or key terms.\" Def.'s Ex. D. As to that request, the EPA has not explained why it could not reasonably discern the records sought and process the request when American Oversight sought all email records for a particular account across a two-week span. And the Court fails to see why, as the EPA insists, a subject matter or keyword was necessary.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   In response to the Outside Communications FOIA, however, the EPA stated that it could not process the request because it \"fail[ed] to provide details such as the\n   <em>\n    names of potential authors or recipients\n   </em>\n   , subject matters, titles or key terms\" and because \"\n   <em>\n    the language regarding domain names [was] insufficient\n   </em>\n   to allow [the] EPA to discern the subject matter and authors or recipients outside of [the] EPA\" in which American Oversight was interested. Def.'s Ex. E (emphasis added). Indeed, an EPA official explained in an affidavit that the EPA could not search for emails in an EPA email account sent to or received from \"any email address not containing a .gov domain name,\" as American Oversight requested, without excluding a large amount of if not all responsive records.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   White Decl. \u00b6 8.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   American Oversight rejects these explanations, describing the EPA's account that it could not process the request without specified email domains \"facially untenable\" since the EPA listed examples in its request of domain names that the EPA could use.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Pl.'s Opp'n at 14-15; Pl.'s Ex. 2 at 2 (describing \"any email address not containing a .gov domain name\" as \"email addresses with domain names that include .com, .net, .org, or .edu\"). But in so arguing, American Oversight underscores the very shortcoming of its policy-or-practice claim. Its dispute as to this particular request is not with some unspoken policy of refusing to process the request until the requestor provides a keyword or subject matter for the email records sought, but with the EPA's specific determination that it could not search for the records without specifying non-.gov domain names for the potential authors or recipients.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Def.'s Ex. E; White Decl. \u00b6 8. That response can hardly be said to evidence a policy or practice of denying a request for email records solely because the request lacks a subject matter or keyword, particularly given that the EPA identified a separate-and notably request-specific-shortcoming of the request unrelated to the fact that it lacked those details.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-50\">\n   Moreover, and further emphasizing that the lack of keywords or a subject matter was not the singular basis of its denial, the EPA's determination that it could not process American Oversight's request as stated appears to be justified. EPA official White asserts that the EPA could not search for the requested email records with non-.gov domain names by excluding .gov accounts because the requested emails must have at least one .gov participant, and thus that would necessarily leave\n   out all or a significant portion of responsive emails.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   White Decl. \u00b6 8. American Oversight does not dispute that representation, but it claims that the EPA should have at least begun to process the request with the domain names suggested in the request.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Pl.'s Opp'n at 17. While that may be so, the Court need not decide whether the EPA's obligations to process the request were triggered to resolve American Oversight's policy-or-practice claim. The fact remains that, contrary to American Oversight's allegation, the EPA's response to this request does not show that it refused to process the request for email records unless and until American Oversight provided a subject matter or keyword. The central hold-up was about domain names.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-51\">\n   Turning next to the Congressional Communications FOIA, the EPA's response demonstrates a similar, request-specific approach. In concluding that it did not reasonably describe the records sought, the EPA stated that it not only \"fail[ed] to provide details such as subject matters, titles[,] or key terms,\" but also that \"limiting [the] request to the domains\n   <em>\n    house.gov\n   </em>\n   or\n   <em>\n    senate.gov\n   </em>\n   [was] insufficient to allow the EPA discern the subject matter and senators or representatives\" in which American Oversight was interested. Def.'s Ex. F. The EPA identified specific shortcomings of the request, independent of the fact that the request did not provide any subject matter or keyword, and it sought clarification from the requester.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5889782\" index=\"56\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-2d/926/284/#p293\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   American Oversight tries to dismiss this explanation in a footnote, arguing that \"a requester has no obligation to provide the actual names of the interlocutors in question,\" Pl.'s Opp'n at 5 n.2, but again, that argument reveals the problem with American Oversight's claim. While that contention may be true, the alleged unlawful policy or practice only emerges once American Oversight casts off the EPA's other, case-specific reasons for finding the request ill-described.\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   To be sure, unlike the Outside Communications request, the EPA provides little explanation why it could not search for emails in the accounts of the named custodians using the house.gov and senate.gov domains specified, and the Court fails to see how that request as written does not reasonably describe the records sought. But that response, despite American Oversight's insistence, does not reveal that the determination resulted from a policy of refusing to process requests\n   <em>\n    solely because\n   </em>\n   they lack a keyword or subject matter.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Pl.'s MSJ at 14 (\"The Court should enjoin EPA from continuing\n   to deny FOIA requests that clearly identify the requested records solely on the basis that they do not provide a subject matter, keyword, or search term.\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-52\">\n   The other FOIA requests that American Oversight identifies reveal a similar case-by-case approach. In April 2017, American Oversight submitted requests for \"[a]ll communications\" between \"any political or SES appointee in the Office of the Administrator ... or the Office of Air and Radiation ..., as well as anyone acting on behalf of those individuals\" and (1) Carl Icahn, \"any individual acting on behalf of Mr. Icahn,\" or anyone \"acting on behalf of Icahn Enterprises or CVR Energy,\" or (2) anyone acting on behalf of Valero Energy. Pl.'s Ex. 15 at 2. The EPA responded that it could not process American Oversight's complaint without further clarification about\n   <em>\n    who\n   </em>\n   might \"represent persons acting on behalf of Carl Icahn, persons at Icahn Enterprises, CVR Energy or Valero Energy.\" Pl.'s Ex. 16. A second request, submitted by an environmental organization, similarly sought all communications records between \"Carl Icahn, his personal staff, or staff of CVR Energy or a subsidiary\" and several unnamed individuals holding certain positions at the EPA or the President's staff or transition teams.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Pl.'s Ex. 18. Again, the EPA responded that it could not process the request because it was \"silent as to who may comprise Carl Icahn's personal staff or staff of CVR energy, who among Administrator Pruitt's advisors [the requester] was interested in[,] and who comprise[d] President or President Elect Trump's advisors or staff.\" Pl.'s Ex. 19 at 1. The EPA's responses to these requests were self-evidently not based solely on their lack of keywords or subject matters, but on request-specific conclusions that the EPA could not process them without additional clarification as to the identities of the participants.\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-53\">\n   And again, further emphasizing that these determinations were not the product of a policy of refusing to process requests that lack subject matters or keywords, EPA's conclusions appear justified. \"A request must enable 'a professional agency employee familiar with the subject area to locate the record with a reasonable amount of effort.' \"\n   <em>\n    Hall &amp; Assocs.\n   </em>\n   , 83 F. Supp. 3d at 101 (quoting\n   <em>\n    Exp.-Imp. Bank\n   </em>\n   , 108 F. Supp. 2d at 27 ). \"The agency is 'not obliged to look beyond the four corners of the request for leads' ..., and ultimately\n   'it is the requester's responsibility to frame requests with sufficient particularity.' \"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   (quoting\n   <em>\n    Kowalczyk\n   </em>\n   , 73 F.3d at 389, then\n   <em>\n    Exp.-Imp. Bank\n   </em>\n   , 108 F. Supp. 2d at 27 ). As the EPA made clear in its responses, its employees could not determine from the text of the request, for purposes of conducting a search, which individuals are acting on behalf of Carl Icahn, Valero Energy, or CVR Energy, or which individuals comprise President or President-Elect Trump's advisors or staff.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Pl.'s Ex. 16; Pl.'s Ex. 19 at 1. Perhaps for that reason, American Oversight neglects to even address these explanations in its response.\n   <em>\n    See generally\n   </em>\n   Pl.'s Opp'n.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-54\">\n   To be sure, in the EPA's response to each of the requests identified by American Oversight, the EPA stated that the requests failed to provide subject matters or keywords. As noted previously, the EPA cited that deficiency as one of the bases for why it could not process American Oversight's three requests that were the subject of this action. And in responding to the two Icahn requests, the EPA also stated that they \"fail[ed] to provide keywords, titles[,] or other relevant information which would allow [it] to identify the subject matter\" in which the requester was interested.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Pl.'s Ex. 16; Pl.'s Ex. 19 at 1. But when viewed in their broader context, those statements do not reveal a pattern of denying any request that lacks a keyword or subject matter. Those are precisely the types of details that the EPA's own FOIA regulations instruct requesters to include in their requests to ensure that it \"will be able to identify and locate records responsive to [those] request[s].\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"57\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=40%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%202.102\">\n    40 C.F.R. \u00a7 2.102\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (c). It is thus unremarkable that the EPA will specifically ask for these additional details when it concludes that it cannot reasonably discern and locate the records that a requester seeks.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-55\">\n   Moreover, the EPA's representation that an employee\n   <em>\n    would be\n   </em>\n   able to reasonably locate requested records if the requester provided a keyword or a subject matter does not support the accusation that the EPA had a policy that it\n   <em>\n    would not\n   </em>\n   process that request\n   <em>\n    unless\n   </em>\n   the requester provided a keyword or subject matter. Indeed, the EPA has provided undisputed evidence directly to the contrary. It points to three requests for communications records, all submitted around the same time as the requests identified by American Oversight to support its policy-or-practice claim, that it agreed to process without any keywords or subject matters. White Decl. \u00b6 19;\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Def.'s Ex. M (request for all \"emails to or from emails addresses with the domains @americanchemistry.com and @arkema.com for dates August 17 to September 28, 2017\"); Def.'s Ex. N (request for \"all emails received by the following EPA addresses from April 12 to April 15, 2018: sooners7@epa.gov; esp7@epa.gov; and adm14pruitt@epa.gov\"); Def.'s Ex. O (request for \"all emails between the Franciscan Action Network and EPA employees ... from Feb. 1 2017 to the date [the] FOIA request is ... processed\"). For that reason, this case is far removed from the circumstances presented in\n   <em>\n    Muckrock\n   </em>\n   , on which American Oversight so heavily relies.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Pl.'s MSJ at 12-13; Pl.'s Opp'n at 10-11. In\n   <em>\n    Muckrock\n   </em>\n   , the plaintiff similarly alleged that the CIA employed a policy of categorically denying requests for email records unless that request provided a specific \"to\" and \"from\" field, a time frame, and a subject matter.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   300 F. Supp. 3d at 135. Not only did the plaintiff in that case provide multiple instances of the CIA refusing to process requests for no other reason than that the requests lacked those four pieces of information, but the CIA could not come forward with any examples of instances when it did process a request that lacked one of\n   those elements.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 135-36. The record here hardly compares.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-56\">\n   At bottom, the record before the Court presents only one instance when the EPA denied outright a request for communications records solely because it failed to provide a keyword or subject matter. It presents four instances when the EPA made request-specific determinations regarding its ability to process requests independent of their lack of keywords or subject matters, at least two-if not three-of which appear justified. And it presents three instances when the EPA processed requests for communications records that provided no keywords or subject matters at all, along with a declaration from the EPA official overseeing FOIA requests submitted to the Office of the Director declaring that it does not employ the policy American Oversight alleges. This record is hardly sufficient for a reasonable jury to conclude, as American Oversight must establish to obtain the relief it seeks, \"that the [EPA] has adopted, endorsed, or implemented [a] policy or practice that constitutes an ongoing 'failure to abide by the terms of the FOIA.' \"\n   <em>\n    Muttitt\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5889782\" index=\"58\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-2d/926/284/#p293\">\n    926 F.

Such discussions, as this action makes clear, may not always prove successful, and clarification may not always be necessary or warranted. As noted, however, those discussions will necessarily be context-specific, and that will likewise lead to context-specific grounds for denial. And for that very reason, they are generally ill-suited to the type of policy-or-practice claim that American Oversight brings here. The Court ultimately will not, based on this record, prospectively hamper that process, particularly when it concerns an agency's requests for information that would no doubt make it easier for an agency to locate the specific records that a requester seeks. The Court does not foreclose that an agency may systematically abuse that process in a way that warrants judicial intervention.

Without more, the Court has no basis to determine the actual grounds for the EPA's denial. The Court certainly cannot conclude, particularly given the sheer breadth of the request as described by White, whether the EPA's response was justified in those particular circumstances in light of its search capabilities, as opposed to the product of some categorical policy of requiring subject matters or keywords for every request for communications records.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"7\">\n   <p id=\"p-70\">\n    In its consolidated opposition to the EPA's cross-motion and reply in support of its motion, American Oversight appears to retreat from the policy or practice it alleges in its complaint and in its motion for summary judgment, particularly its allegation that the EPA requires a subject matter or keyword. It states that it is instead seeking\n    <em>\n     first\n    </em>\n    a declaratory judgment \"that a FOIA request for email communications that identifies (a) the agency custodians whose files are to be searched; (b) the correspondents (whether internal to the agency or external, and whether identified by name, position, email address, or domain) whose communications with those custodians are sought; and (c) a discrete date range for the requested records, has 'reasonably described' the records sought,\" and\n    <em>\n     second\n    </em>\n    \"an injunction enjoining the agency from requiring FOIA requesters to provide\n    <em>\n     more information than that.\n    </em>\n    \" Pl.'s Opp'n at 19 (emphasis added).

But even assuming that American Oversight had articulated the alleged policy in this way from the start-that is, the EPA has a consistent policy of wrongfully determining that a request identifying custodians, recipients, and a date range is not reasonably described-such a policy or practice is still unsupported by the record. As noted, while some requests, such as the Pruitt Communications Request, appear to have been \"reasonably described,\" others, such as the Icahn requests, were not. And for that reason, while a request that includes the details highlighted by American Oversight may \"reasonably describe\" communications records, in other circumstances, it may not. Thus, not only would the requested declaratory relief be erroneous as a matter of law, the record does not demonstrate a consistent policy or practice showing American Oversight's entitlement to it.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"8\">\n   <p id=\"p-71\">\n    At the end of its consolidated opposition and reply brief, American Oversight, for the first time, states that the court should at least \"permit American Oversight limited discovery into [the EPA's] FOIA practices.\" Pl.'s Opp'n at 20. American Oversight, however, has not moved under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 56(d) for additional discovery, nor has it attempted to show \"by affidavit or declaration that, for specified reasons, it cannot present facts essential to justify its opposition\" to the EPA's motion, as the Rule requires.\n    <em>\n     See also\n    </em>\n    <em>\n     Convertino v.
