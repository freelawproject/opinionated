GIBSON, JUDGE\n  </author>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   Before the Court is Defendant UPMC Altoona's Motion for Summary Judgment. (ECF No. 30.) This Motion is fully briefed and is ripe for disposition. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   ECF Nos. 31-33, 44-46, 51-53, 58-59.) For the following reasons, the Motion is\n   <strong>\n    GRANTED IN PART\n   </strong>\n   and\n   <strong>\n    DENIED IN PART.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   <strong>\n    I. Background\n   </strong>\n   <strong>\n    A. Factual History\n   </strong>\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   The following facts are undisputed unless otherwise noted. The Court includes additional material facts in Section IV where necessary.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   <strong>\n    1. Sabo's Employment at UPMC Altoona and its Predecessors\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   Plaintiff Deborah Sabo began work at Altoona Hospital - which later became UPMC Altoona - as a nutrition specialist in March of 1998. (ECF No. 32 \u00b6 1; ECF No. 44 \u00b6 1.) In 2008, Sabo was promoted to certified dietary manager. (ECF No. 32 \u00b6 2; ECF N.\u00b62.) As a certified dietary manager, Sabo supervised food-preparation employees and oversaw food service, sanitation, food procurement, and storage. (ECF No. 32 \u00b6 3; ECF No. 44 \u00b6 3.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   Sabo worked in UPMC Altoona's nutrition services department. (ECF No. 32 \u00b6 4; ECF No. 44 \u00b6 4.) The nutrition services department at UPMC Altoona was overseen by Robert Strawser, the executive director of missions and patient experience at UPMC Altoona. (ECF No. 32 \u00b6 9; ECF No. 44 \u00b6 9.) From 2008 until 2014, Sabo reported to Debra Finochio, the director of UPMC Altoona's nutrition services department. (ECF No. 32 \u00b6 4; ECF No. 44 \u00b6 4.) After Finochio's retirement in 2014, Sabo reported to Dona Baughman, who replaced Finochio as director of the nutrition services department. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   )\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   In February of 2013, UPMC Altoona's nutrition services department hired Keith Auker as executive chef. (ECF No. 32 \u00b6 13; ECF No. 44 \u00b6 13.) Auker was in charge of \"all things food,\" including planning menus, ordering and preparing food, and executing VIP events and executive functions. (ECF No. 32 \u00b6 15; ECF No. 44 \u00b6 15.) The parties dispute whether Sabo performed Auker's job duties before he started working at UPMC Altoona. (ECF No. 32 \u00b6\u00b6 16-19; ECF No. 44 \u00b6\u00b6 16-19.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   <strong>\n    2. Sabo's Job Performance and Experience at UPMC Altoona\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   As Sabo's direct supervisor, Finochio completed performance reviews for Sabo from 1998 until November of 2014. (ECF No. 32 \u00b6 20; ECF No. 44 \u00b6 20.) Supervisors rated employees on a one-to-five scale with one being the lowest rating and five being the highest. (ECF No. 32 \u00b6\u00b6 24-26; ECF No. 44 \u00b6\u00b6 24-26.) The parties do not dispute that performance reviews factored in whether employees achieved \"personal goals\" - long term goals that employees established for themselves. (ECF No. 32 \u00b6\u00b6 23-25; ECF No. 44 \u00b6\u00b6 23-25.) However, the parties dispute exactly what personal goals were and how the achievement of personal goals was factored into employee performance reviews. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   )\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   From 2009 until 2013, Sabo received \"consistently relatively strong\" performance reviews. (ECF No. 32 \u00b6 27; ECF No. 44 \u00b6 27.) The parties agree that Sabo was a well-liked and good employee. (ECF No. 52 \u00b6 18.) Sabo received a 3.7 rating for 2009-2010, a 3.8 rating for 2010-2011, a 4.0 rating for 2011-2012, and a 3.75 rating in 2012-2013. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) Defendant alleges that Sabo received a 2 out of 5 rating in a category of her 2012-2013 performance review because she did not meet one of her personal goals. (ECF No. 32 \u00b6 28.) Sabo disputes this fact, and asserts that \"Finochio\n   gave Sabo a 2 out of 5 because [Sabo] had taken time off.\" (ECF No. 44 \u00b6 28.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   As a result of Sabo's \"great score\" on her 2012-2013 performance review, Sabo received a salary increase and a lump-sum bonus. (ECF No. 32 \u00b6\u00b6 31-32, 34-36; ECF No. 44 \u00b6\u00b6 31-32, 34-36.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   Sabo took leave under the Family and Medical Leave Act (\"FMLA\") twice during her employment at UPMC Altoona. (ECF No. 32 \u00b6 40; ECF No. 44 \u00b6 40.) First, Sabo took FMLA leave in 2012 for approximately three months due to anxiety and depression. (ECF No. 32 \u00b6 41; ECF No. 44 \u00b6 41.) Defendant alleges that Sabo's managers and supervisors did not know that she suffered from depression and anxiety. (ECF No. 32 \u00b6 42.) Sabo disputes that fact by alleging that Baughman knew of Sabo's history of depression. (ECF No. 44 \u00b6 42.) Sabo did not seek accommodations after her 2012 FMLA leave. (ECF No. 32 \u00b6 48; ECF No. 44 \u00b6 48.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   Sabo also took FMLA leave in 2013 for approximately four months due to spinal stenosis. (ECF No. 32 \u00b6 43; ECF No. 44 \u00b6 43.) Finochio and Baughman knew that Sabo's 2013 FMLA leave was related to a neck injury. (ECF No. 32 \u00b6 44, 46; ECF No. 44 \u00b6 44, 46.) After her 2013 FMLA leave, Sabo requested that she not be required to lift more than 10 pounds. (ECF No. 32 \u00b6 49; ECF No. 44 \u00b6 49.) UPMC Altoona accommodated Sabo's request. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   )\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   Sabo complained to her superiors and human-resources employees about three issues throughout her employment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   <strong>\n    a. Sabo Complained About Her 2012-2013 Performance Review\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   First, Sabo complained about her 2012-2013 performance review. (ECF No. 32 \u00b6\u00b6 52-68; ECF No. 44 \u00b6\u00b6 52-68.) Sabo left a voicemail message with Finochio complaining about her receiving a 2 out of 5 in an individual category of the 2012-2013 performance review. (ECF No. 32 \u00b6 52; ECF No. 44 \u00b6 52.) Finochio told Sabo not to worry about the individual category because her overall score was high. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) Sabo alleges that Finochio told Sabo that her 2 out of 5 score was due to Sabo's taking FMLA leave. (ECF No. 44 \u00b6 52.) The parties agree the Finochio mentioned Sabo's FMLA leave in the 2012-2013 performance review. (ECF No. 52 \u00b6 33.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   Sabo met with Finochio on February 11, 2014 to discuss Sabo's concerns about her 2012-2013 performance review. (ECF No. 32 \u00b6 55; ECF No. 44 \u00b6 55.) At that meeting, Sabo told Finochio that she believed Finochio was retaliating against her for utilizing FMLA leave. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) Finochio denied Plaintiff's allegation. (ECF No. 32 \u00b6 56; ECF No. 44 \u00b6 56.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   Finochio contacted Strawser (UPMC Altoona's executive director of missions and patient experience) and John Kepler, UPMC Altoona's director of human resources, about Sabo's complaint regarding her 2012-2013 performance review. (ECF No. 32 \u00b6 57; ECF No. 44 \u00b6 57.) Strawser and Kepler determined that Sabo's complaint was meritless because (1) the overall score for her performance review was high, and (2) Sabo was unable to meet her personal goals while missing work. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   )\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   Finochio and Kepler then decided to refer Sabo to UPMC Altoona's employee assistance program (EAP), which provided counseling to employees. (ECF No. 32 \u00b6 58; ECF No. 44 \u00b6 58.) UPMC Altoona claims that Finochio and Kepler made this decision because Sabo exhibited a \"level of continued distress.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) Sabo states that the referral was based on Sabo becoming \"emotional\" when Strawser and Finochio refused to consider her complaint about FMLA leave. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   )\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   On February 18, 2014, Sabo met with Finochio and Strawser. (ECF No. 32 \u00b6 61; ECF No. 44 \u00b6 61.) At that meeting, Sabo, Finochio, and Strawser discussed Sabo's 2012-2013 performance review and her referral to EAP. (ECF No. 32 \u00b6 62; ECF No. 44 \u00b6 62.) Sabo became emotional when she learned that Strawser and Finochio would not change her 2012-2013 performance review. (ECF No. 52 \u00b6 47.) After that meeting, Sabo attended EAP and Finochio opined that the situation had improved. (ECF No. 32 \u00b6 63; ECF No. 44 \u00b6 63.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   Sabo also complained about her 2012-2013 performance review at a meeting with Sarah Greene, a human resources manager for UPMC Altoona, on October 9, 2014. (ECF No. 32 \u00b6 65; ECF No. 44 \u00b6 65.) Sabo drafted a follow-up email to Greene after the meeting, but never sent it. (ECF No. 52 \u00b6 56.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   The parties dispute whether Sabo complained about the 2012-2013 performance reviews to Baughman or other supervisors. (ECF No. 32 \u00b6\u00b6 66-68; ECF No. 44 \u00b6\u00b6 66-68.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   <strong>\n    b. Sabo Complained About Logging Time\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   Second, Sabo complained about Executive Chef Auker at her October 9, 2014 meeting with Greene. (ECF No. 32 \u00b6\u00b6 69-76; ECF No. 44 \u00b6\u00b6 69-76.) Sabo complained that she was required to log her time each workday while Auker, the newly hired executive chef, was not required to log his time. (ECF No. 32 \u00b6\u00b6 70-71; ECF No. 44 \u00b6\u00b6 70-71.) Defendant alleges that Greene did not interpret Sabo's comments as complaints about sex discrimination, but Sabo contends that her statements \"clearly regard[ed] sex discrimination.\" (ECF No. 32 \u00b6\u00b6 73-75; ECF No. 44 \u00b6\u00b6 73-75.) When Baughman became director of the nutrition services department in 2014, Sabo was no longer required to log her time. (ECF No. 32 \u00b6 76; ECF No. 44 \u00b6 76.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   <strong>\n    c. Sabo Complained About Communication Issues with Baughman\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   Third, Sabo complained about communication issues with Baughman after Baughman took over for Finochio as director of the nutrition services department in 2014. (ECF No. 32 \u00b6\u00b6 77-80; ECF No. 44 \u00b6\u00b6 77-80.) Sabo informed Greene of her issues communicating with Baughman. (ECF No. 32 \u00b6\u00b6 77-78; ECF No. 44 \u00b6\u00b6 77-78.) In response, Greene held weekly \"huddles\" to address the communication issues. (ECF No. 32 \u00b6 79; ECF No. 44 \u00b6 79.) Greene received a similar complaint from another employee named Betsy Lynch. (ECF No. 32 \u00b6 80; ECF No. 44 \u00b6 80.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   <strong>\n    3. Sabo's Termination\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   In March of 2015, UPMC Altoona informed Baughman of a \"reduction in force.\" (ECF No. 32 \u00b6 81; ECF No. 44 \u00b6 81.) UPMC Altoona required Baughman to reduce the workforce in the nutrition services department by four percent, which translated to four full-time employees. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) Baughman determined the positions that would be eliminated. (ECF No. 32 \u00b6 84; ECF No. 44 \u00b6 84.) Baughman chose to eliminate a certified dietary manager, nutrition services supervisor, and part-time clerical assistant. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   )\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   Defendant alleges that Baughman used seniority to determine who would be terminated where there was more than individual in each position. (ECF No. 32 \u00b6 85.) Sabo alleges that \"Baughman used seniority as a pretext to 'get rid' of employees who used FMLA or extended leave.\" (ECF No. 44 \u00b6 85.) The parties disagree about the decision-making process Baughman used to eliminate positions. (ECF No. 32 \u00b6\u00b6 86-87; ECF No. 44 \u00b6\u00b6 86-87.) The parties also disagree about how Baughman communicated her decision to her superiors and whether Strawser was involved.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   (ECF No. 32 \u00b6\u00b6 86-87, 89; ECF No. 44 \u00b6\u00b6 86-87, 89.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   Sabo lost her job as a result of the 2015 reduction in force. (ECF No. 32 \u00b6 93; ECF No. 44 \u00b6 93.) Defendant alleges that Sabo was the least senior certified dietary manager in UPMC Altoona's nutrition services department. (ECF No. 32 \u00b6\u00b6 92, 94.) Sabo, however, maintains that she had the same level of seniority as another certified dietary manager, Julie Fornwalt. (ECF No. 44 \u00b6\u00b6 92, 94.) Sabo argues that she and Fornwalt were promoted to certified dietary manager at the same time in 2008, and that they had different roles within the certified dietary manager position.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 92-94.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   UMPC Altoona staff notified Sabo of her termination at 10:00 a.m. on August 5, 2015. (ECF No. 32 \u00b6 99; ECF No. 44 \u00b6 99.) Greene, Strawser, Baughman, and a human resources representative named Jennifer Hatajik attended the meeting. (ECF No. 32 \u00b6 100; ECF No. 44 \u00b6 100.) One of these staff members told Sabo that she was being terminated and explained the benefits packages that would be available to her. (ECF No. 32 \u00b6 102; ECF No. 44 \u00b6 102.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   Baughman accompanied Sabo to her office as Sabo collected her belongings. (ECF No. 32 \u00b6 104; ECF No. 44 \u00b6 104.) Sabo insulted Baughman and stated that she wanted to kill herself. (ECF No. 32 \u00b6\u00b6 105-06; ECF No. 44 \u00b6\u00b6 105-06.) At some point, Strawser approached Sabo's office. (ECF No. 32 \u00b6 108; ECF No. 44 \u00b6 108.) Baughman communicated Sabo's threat to Strawser as a \"statement that Plaintiff would be better off dead.\" (ECF No. 32 \u00b6 108; ECF No. 44 \u00b6 108.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   Strawser and Baughman escorted Sabo to her car. (ECF No. 32 \u00b6 109; ECF No. 44 \u00b6 109.) Sabo was upset as she left the building and informed other UPMC Altoona employees that she had been fired. (ECF No. 32 \u00b6\u00b6 110-14; ECF No. 44 \u00b6\u00b6 110-14.) On the way to her car, Sabo told Baughman and Strawser \"that her job was her life\" and that \"she might as well just end it.\" (ECF No. 52 \u00b6 122.) She refused help from Strawser and left the premises. (ECF No. 32 \u00b6\u00b6 112-14; ECF No. 44 \u00b6\u00b6 112-14.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   <strong>\n    4. The Aftermath of Sabo's Termination\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   After they escorted Sabo off the UPMC Altoona premises, Strawser and Baughman again met with Greene and Hatajik. (ECF No. 32 \u00b6 116; ECF No. 44 \u00b6 116.) The four decided to call the UPMC Altoona Crisis Center to determine if they should take additional action regarding Sabo. (ECF No. 32 \u00b6\u00b6 116-17; ECF No. 44 \u00b6\u00b6 116-17.) Strawser told the Crisis Center that Sabo threatened to harm herself after learning of her termination. (ECF No. 32 \u00b6 118; ECF No. 44 \u00b6 118.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   The Crisis Center informed Strawser \"that there did not appear to be grounds for a 302 [involuntary] commitment.\" (ECF No. 32 \u00b6 119; ECF No. 44 \u00b6 119.) The Crisis Center also told Strawser it would visit Sabo's home \"to perform a wellness check.\" (ECF No. 32 \u00b6\u00b6 119-20; ECF No. 44 \u00b6\u00b6 119-20.) Strawser contacted other UPMC Altoona staff and attempted to contact Sabo's boyfriend and sister. (ECF No. 32 \u00b6\u00b6 121-22; ECF No. 44 \u00b6\u00b6 121-22.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   Crisis Center employees visited Sabo's home and determined that she was not there. (ECF No. 32 \u00b6 123; ECF No. 44 \u00b6 123.) Crisis Center employees then asked Strawser to sign a \"302 Petition\" to have Sabo involuntary committed, but Strawser\n   refused. (ECF No. 32 \u00b6 123; ECF No. 44 \u00b6 123.) Defendant alleges that Strawser did not sign the form because he was not present for Sabo's suicidal statements, but Sabo alleges that Strawser was present and contemporaneously aware of Sabo's threats of self-harm. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) Strawser provided Crisis Center employees with Baughman's contact information. (ECF No. 32 \u00b6 124; ECF No. 44 \u00b6 124.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   After Sabo left UPMC Altoona on August 5, 2015, Baughman went to a movie. (ECF No. 52 \u00b6 148.) After the movie, Baughman returned calls to Crisis Center employees about the 302 Petition. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 148.) Baughman was initially hesitant to sign the 302 Petition but eventually signed it. (ECF No. 32 \u00b6\u00b6 125-26; ECF No. 44 \u00b6\u00b6 125-26; ECF No. 52 \u00b6\u00b6 148-50.) On the 302 Petition, Baughman noted that Sabo had a history of depression. (ECF No. 44 \u00b6 116; ECF No. 52 \u00b6 116.) Baughman testified that Crisis Center employees \"told her what to write in the Petition.\" (ECF No. 52 \u00b6 116.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   After leaving UPMC Altoona's premises, Sabo drove to the liquor store to acquire alcohol. (ECF No. 32 \u00b6 128; ECF No. 44 \u00b6 128.) That night, she consumed alcohol and Xanax (a prescription Benzodiazepine used for anxiety and panic disorder ) in her car and fell asleep. (ECF No. 32 \u00b6 129; ECF No. 44 \u00b6 129.) Sabo claims that she attempted to commit suicide by consuming the alcohol and Xanax. (ECF No. 44 \u00b6\u00b6 129-30.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   Sabo returned to her home on the morning of August 6, 2015 - the day after her termination. (ECF No. 32 \u00b6 130; ECF No. 44 \u00b6 130.) Police departments, investigators, detectives, and the UPMC Crisis Center were searching for Sabo that morning. (ECF No. 32 \u00b6 131; ECF No. 44 \u00b6 131.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-50\">\n   Sabo was admitted to UPMC Altoona's behavioral health unit on August 6, 2015.

ADA discrimination claims are sometimes referred to as disparate-treatment claims.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Raytheon Co. v.

Second, Sabo alleges that Defendant unlawfully retaliated against her in violation of the ADA. (ECF. No. 1 \u00b6\u00b6 58-59.)

Sabo's Discrimination Claim Under the Americans with Disabilities Act\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-67\">\n   To establish a prima facie case of discrimination under the ADA, a plaintiff must show: (1) that he or she is a disabled person as defined by the ADA; (2) he or she is otherwise qualified to perform the essential functions of the job, with or without reasonable accommodations by the employer; and (3) he or she has suffered an adverse employment decision as a result of discrimination.\n   <em>\n    Evans v.

Defendant concedes that Sabo was disabled for purposes of the ADA. (ECF No. 31 at 11.) And Defendant does not challenge that Sabo was qualified to perform the essential functions of her job. Rather, Defendant alleges that Sabo cannot show causation because her supervisors were unaware of her depression and anxiety. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   )\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-69\">\n   Sabo responds to Defendant's first point by arguing that her supervisors knew that she was disabled due to her spinal stenosis, anxiety, and depression. (ECF No. 45 at 10.) She points out that UPMC Altoona managers - specifically Baughman, Strawser, Finochio, and Greene - were all aware that Sabo had taken FMLA leave. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) Sabo argues that, accordingly, a jury could infer that these supervisors knew of her disability because she took FMLA leave. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) Sabo further argues that her immediate supervisor, Baughman, knew of her disabilities. Baughman testified that she knew of Sabo's spinal stenosis. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) And on the 302 Petition to involuntarily commit Sabo after her termination, Baughman affirmed that Sabo had a history of depression. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   )\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-70\">\n   The Court finds that there is a genuine issue of material fact as to whether Sabo's supervisors knew about her disabilities. It is undisputed that Baughman signed a 302 Petition stating that Sabo had a history of depression. (ECF No. 44 \u00b6 116; ECF No. 52 \u00b6 116.) This plainly shows that Baughman was aware of Sabo's mental-health related disability. While Defendant states that Crisis Center employees told Baughman to write that in the form, this is a factual dispute for the jury to resolve - especially given that Baughman signed the 302 Form subject to criminal prosecution for providing false information. (ECF No. 52 \u00b6 116; ECF No. 58 at 2.) Moreover, a reasonable jury could infer that Sabo's FMLA leave informed her supervisors that she was disabled. Accordingly, Sabo has proffered sufficient evidence to preclude summary judgment on her prima facie case of discrimination under the ADA.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-71\">\n   Under the\n   <em>\n    McDonnell Douglas\n   </em>\n   burden-shifting framework, the burden shifts from the plaintiff to the defendant after the plaintiff has established a prima facie case of discrimination.\n   <em>\n    McDonnell Douglas Corp. v.

Here, Baughman determined the criteria for the reduction in force. (ECF No. 44 \u00b6 88, 93; ECF No. 52 \u00b6 88, 93.) Although she chose to terminate employees based on departmental seniority, she could have used other criteria. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) There is also a dispute as to how Baughman calculated seniority. (ECF No. 44 \u00b6\u00b6 92, 94.) And when Baughman learned about the reduction in force, she suggested to her supervisors that she could terminate one of the two certified dietary managers. (ECF No. 44 \u00b6 73; ECF No. 52 \u00b6 73.) When Baughman made that statement, she believed that Sabo was the least senior certified dietary manager, and therefore would be terminated. (ECF No. 44 \u00b6 74; ECF No. 52 \u00b6 74.) As a whole, the situation here is analogous to\n   <em>\n    Showalter\n   </em>\n   and shows that a jury could reject Baughman's explanation for the reduction in force, and instead determine that she made decisions knowing that Sabo would be terminated. Sabo therefore casts sufficient doubt on Defendant's proffered rationale for her termination and survives summary judgment on her discrimination claim under the ADA.

June 19, 2008) ).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-98\">\n   Sabo has raised a genuine dispute on whether she was prevented from asserting her rights due to mental distress after her termination. It is undisputed that Sabo was involuntarily committed to UPMC Altoona due to extreme mental distress for a three-day period following her termination. (ECF No. 32 \u00b6\u00b6 132-36; ECF No. 44 \u00b6\u00b6 132-36.) Involuntary commitment is an extreme circumstance that obviously prohibited Sabo from exercising her rights.\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n   Sabo also alleges that she was in a heavily medicated state whenever she left UPMC Altoona on August 8, 2019. (ECF No. 44 \u00b6 155; ECF No. 52 \u00b6 155.) Based on these facts, the Court must infer that Sabo's extreme mental distress prohibited her from exercising her rights in the eight days following her termination. And because Sabo filed her Complaint with the PHRA 188 days after her termination, eight days of equitable tolling renders her Complaint timely.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-99\">\n   Moreover, the PHRA is a remedial statute.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.,\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Davis v. Jefferson Reg'l Med. Ctr.\n   </em>\n   , No. 2:06-cv-1094,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"68\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2007%20WL%202752137\">\n    2007 WL 2752137\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *4 (W.D.

And courts have applied equitable tolling to the PHRA's 180-day time limit.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.,\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Altopiedi v. Memorex Telex Corp.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7405964\" index=\"70\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp/834/800/#p806\">\n    834 F. Supp. 800\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 806 (E.D. Pa. 1993). This further weighs in favor of finding that Sabo is entitled to equitable tolling. The Court therefore finds that, especially at the summary judgment stage, it should construe the 180-day limitations period of the PHRA in favor of Sabo.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-100\">\n   Defendant's second argument-that Sabo is not entitled to equitable tolling because she was represented by counsel before the expiration of the 180-day period-is unpersuasive. Plaintiffs are generally entitled to the full limitations period from the point where their claims accrue.\n   <em>\n    Oshiver v. Levin, Fishbein, Sedran &amp; Berman\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1852350\" index=\"71\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/38/1380/#p1386\">\n    38 F.3d 1380\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 1386 (3d Cir. 1994) ;\n   <em>\n    New Castle Cty. v.

Because Sabo's claim did not accrue until sometime after her involuntary commitment, she is entitled to equitable tolling even though she retained counsel during the 180-day limitations period.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-101\">\n   In conclusion, the Court finds that the extreme circumstances in this case may\n   warrant equitable tolling of the 180-day limitations period.

It is undisputed that Sabo took FMLA leave in 2012 and 2013 as a UPMC Altoona employee. (ECF No. 32 \u00b6\u00b6 40-43; ECF No. 44 \u00b6\u00b6 40-43.) And there are genuine issues of material fact as to whether Sabo suffered adverse employment actions. \"An 'adverse employment action' is an action that 'alters the employee's compensation, terms, conditions, privileges of employment, deprives him or her of employment opportunities, or adversely affects his or her status as an employee.' \"\n   <em>\n    Budhun v.

(ECF No. 52 \u00b6 33.) Sabo also alleges that the conditions of her employment changed because she was required to attend EAP counseling after she complained about FMLA retaliation. (ECF No. 52 \u00b6\u00b6 48-49.) And finally, it is undisputed that UPMC Altoona terminated Sabo on August 5, 2015. (ECF No. 32 \u00b6 99; ECF No. 44 \u00b6 99.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-107\">\n   The key question is whether Sabo can show causation. To demonstrate causation, a plaintiff must show \"either (1) an unusually suggestive proximity between the protected\n   activity and the allegedly retaliatory action, or (2) a pattern of antagonism coupled with timing to establish a causal link.\"\n   <em>\n    Budhun\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4184165\" index=\"80\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/765/245/#p257\">\n    765 F.3d at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   258 (citing\n   <em>\n    Lauren W. ex rel. Jean W. v. DeFlaminis\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3895969\" index=\"81\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/480/259/#p267\">\n    480 F.3d 259\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 267 (3d Cir. 2007) ).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-108\">\n   Defendant argues that Sabo cannot show causation because there is not a suggestive temporal proximity between Sabo's protected activity and the allegedly adverse employment actions. The Court will conduct separate causation analyses for the each of the adverse employment actions that Sabo allegedly suffered.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-109\">\n   The Court will firstly consider whether Sabo's FMLA leave caused a reduction in pay or a change in her employment conditions. Sabo alleges that her negative performance review caused a reduction in pay. (ECF No. 52 \u00b6 27.) She received the allegedly retaliatory performance review on December 17, 2013-after Sabo's second stint of FMLA leave, which ended in May of 2013. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 27.) Although the negative performance review occurred more than six months after Sabo took FMLA leave, the performance review explicitly referred to Sabo's FMLA leave. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 32-33.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-110\">\n   Similarly, Finochio referred Sabo to the EAP employee-counseling program-which allegedly changed the conditions of Sabo's employment-on February 18, 2014-soon after Sabo began complaining about her negative performance review. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 44.) Accordingly, the Court finds that Sabo has created a genuine issue of material fact as to whether there was an unusually suggestive proximity between the protected activity and her negative performance review and referral to counseling.\n   <footnotemark>\n    8\n   </footnotemark>\n   Therefore, Sabo's FMLA retaliation claim survives summary judgment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-111\">\n   However, the Court finds that Sabo cannot demonstrate a causal link between her protected activity and her termination. Sabo was terminated on August 5, 2015-more than two years after she took FMLA leave and nearly two years after she complained of retaliation. Moreover, Baughman decided to terminate Sabo. But Baughman's predecessor, Finochio, gave Sabo the 2012-2013 performance review and referred Sabo to EAP counseling. Accordingly, the Court finds that Sabo cannot establish a causal link between protected activity and her termination. Nonetheless, the Court will deny summary judgment on Plaintiff's FMLA claim because she adequately alleges a causal link between her protected activity and Defendant's retaliatory conduct-specifically the performance review that negatively affected her pay and her referral to counseling.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-112\">\n   Defendant also argues that Sabo's FMLA claim is barred by the statute of\n   limitations. Defendant argues that the alleged retaliation occurred in late 2013 and early 2014 and that Sabo did not file her Complaint until July 21, 2017. However, \"an [FMLA] action may be brought ... not later than two years after the date of the last event constituting the alleged violation for which the action is brought.\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"82\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=29%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%202617\">\n    29 U.S.C. \u00a7 2617\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (c)(1). Sabo's FMLA claim is not barred by the statute of limitations because she alleges that her termination-which occurred less than two years before she filed her complaint-forms part of her FMLA claim.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-113\">\n   In conclusion, the Court finds that there are genuine disputes of material fact that preclude summary judgment on Sabo's FMLA retaliation claim. Accordingly, the Court will\n   <strong>\n    DENY\n   </strong>\n   Defendant's Morion for Summary Judgment with respect to Sabo's FMLA retaliation claim.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-114\">\n   <strong>\n    4. Count IV-Defendant Is Not Entitled to Summary Judgment on Sabo's Claims Under Title VII\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-115\">\n   Count IV of Sabo's Complaint alleges that Defendant violated Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 \"by targeting and terminating her based on her gender, and by reassigning her position and duties to a male employee with far fewer years of seniority or experience.\" (ECF No. 1 \u00b6\u00b6 77-81.) Sabo also alleges that Defendant retaliated against her because she complained about gender discrimination. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 80.)

Here, there was a close relationship between the parties. Sabo was an employee of UPMC Altoona. (ECF No. 32 \u00b6\u00b6 1-5.) Sabo's supervisors, Baughman and Strawser, accompanied Sabo to her car after her termination. (ECF No. 32 \u00b6 109; ECF No. 44 \u00b6 109.) Strawser and Baughman understood that Sabo expressed thoughts related to suicide-at least to some extent-after her termination. (ECF No. 32 \u00b6\u00b6 105-06, 108; ECF No. 44 \u00b6\u00b6 105-06, 108; ECF No. 52 \u00b6\u00b6 122.) For example, Baughman testified that \"Sabo said something to the effect that she might as well just kill herself.\" (ECF No. 52 \u00b6 108.) And as Strawser acknowledged, he knew there was some risk that Sabo would attempt suicide if they permitted her to leave the UPMC Altoona premises. (ECF No. \u00b6 145.) As discussed more fully below, it is reasonable to impose a general duty of care on employers where a recently terminated employee expresses suicidal thoughts while still on the employer's premises.

Accordingly, the Court finds that there is a genuine dispute of material fact as to whether Sabo suffered from an emergency medical condition under EMTALA.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-183\">\n   The Court notes that Sabo did not present herself at UPMC Altoona's emergency room. (ECF No. 51 at 9.) EMTALA applies when \"any individual\n   <em>\n    comes to the emergency department.\n   </em>\n   \" 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1395dd. But under federal regulations interpreting EMTALA, EMTALA applies whenever an individual \"[h]as presented on hospital property ... [where] a prudent layperson observer would believe, based on the individual's appearance or behavior, that the individual needs emergency examination or treatment.\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"201\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%20489.24\">\n    42 C.F.R. \u00a7 489.24\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Here, Sabo's distraught condition on hospital property after her termination may have led a prudent observer to refer Plaintiff for emergency treatment or examination. Therefore, the fact that Sabo was on UPMC Altoona's premises implicates EMTALA. The fact that Sabo did not go to the UPMC Altoona's emergency room after her termination does not defeat her EMTALA claim.\n   <footnotemark>\n    13\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-184\">\n   Defendant also argues that Sabo cannot raise a negligence per se claim at summary judgment because Sabo's Complaint does not specifically raise negligence per se in Count VI or otherwise mention EMTALA. (ECF No. 51 at 8-9.) The Court also disagrees with this argument.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-185\">\n   Defendant cites\n   <em>\n    Al Makaaseb\n   </em>\n   and\n   <em>\n    Deitrick\n   </em>\n   in support of this position. However, neither of these cases support Defendant's argument. In\n   <em>\n    Al Makaaseb\n   </em>\n   , the Court held that \"[u]nder [Federal Rule of Civil Procedure] 8(a), as long as an issue is pled, the party does not have to state the exact theory of relief in order to obtain a remedy.\"\n   <em>\n    Al Makaaseb Gen.

Supp. 2d 485\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 500-01 (W.D. Pa. 2006). The court there dismissed the plaintiff's negligence per se claim because plaintiff did not plead negligence or negligence per se before summary judgment.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1001895\" index=\"203\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-2d/412/485/#p500\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   The instant case is distinguishable because Count VI of Plaintiff's Complaint clearly raises negligence. According to the logic in\n   <em>\n    Al Makaaseb\n   </em>\n   , it follows that Sabo was not required to specifically plead negligence per se because she already pled the issue of negligence. Similarly, in\n   <em>\n    Deitrick\n   </em>\n   , the Middle District of Pennsylvania held that citation to a specific statute is not required so long as the complaint alleges particular conduct that clearly violates a statute.\n   <footnotemark>\n    14\n   </footnotemark>\n   <em>\n    Deitrick v.

Apr. 9, 2015). Here, Sabo's Complaint clearly alleges that Defendant ignored Sabo's suicide threats, thereby endangering her health. These allegations implicate EMTALA.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-186\">\n   Therefore, Sabo may also proceed on a negligence per se theory in Count VI because there is a genuine dispute of material fact as to whether Defendant violated EMTALA. As the Court previously determined, there are genuine disputes of material fact as to causation that must be determined by the jury.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-187\">\n   <strong>\n    4.

Further, \"[t]reatment shall include diagnosis, evaluation, therapy, or rehabilitation needed to alleviate pain and distress and to facilitate the recovery of a person from mental illness and shall also include care and other services that supplement treatment and aid or promote such recovery.\" 50 PA. CONS. STAT. \u00a7 7104.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-195\">\n   The MHPA is clearly designed to apply to facilities that provide mental-health treatment, like UPMC Altoona. The notice provision in Section 7302(c) of the MHPA is a procedure that was enacted to supplement mental-health treatment for the patient. Its purpose is to ensure that the patient's support network is aware of the patient's treatment and able to assist to promote recovery.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-196\">\n   Here, Defendant does not dispute that Defendant failed to contact Sabo's relatives (or other individuals) to inform them of her status. (ECF No. 52 \u00b6\u00b6 155-57.) And after Sabo was discharged, Defendant simply released her from the facility without contacting relatives or other individuals to inform them of her discharge. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) Sabo also alleges that she was released in a heavily medicated state. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 156.) This seems to be the scenario that the MHPA was designed to prevent.

The Centers for Disease Control defines \"suicidal ideation\" as \"thinking about, considering, or planning for suicide.\"\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    Centers for Disease Control , Self-Directed Violence Surveillance : Uniform Definition and Recommended Data Elements 35 (2011), available at https://www.cdc.gov/violenceprevention/pdf/self-directed-violence-a.pdf.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"13\">\n   <p id=\"p-219\">\n    It is undisputed that Baughman and Strawser were trained on EMTALA. (ECF No. 52 \u00b6 125.) This further indicates that EMTALA applies on all hospital property, not just in the emergency department. It seems unlikely that Defendant would train Baughman and Strawser-two non-emergency room employees-on EMTALA if it did not apply to them in their daily duties.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"14\">\n   <p id=\"p-220\">\n    A concern in these cases is that defendants may not have notice of the theory under which the plaintiff planned to proceed.\n    <em>\n     Deitrick\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation index=\"221\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2015%20WL%201606714\">\n     2015 WL 1606714\n    </extracted-citation>\n    , at *9 ;\n    <em>\n     Al Makaaseb\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1001895\" index=\"222\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-2d/412/485/#p500\">\n     412 F. Supp. 2d at 500\n    </extracted-citation>\n    (\"Rule 8(a) does not permit the plaintiff to wait until the last minute to ascertain and refine their legal theories, especially if the defendant will be prejudiced.\"). Here, Defendant will not be prejudiced because Sabo did not wait until the last minute to raise a negligence per se theory. Sabo conducted discovery on EMTALA and Defendant stipulated that EMTALA applies to it. (ECF No. 58 at 10 n.10.)\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"15\">\n   <p id=\"p-221\">\n    In its Brief in Support of its Motion for Summary Judgment (ECF No. 31), Defendant argues that it is entitled to summary judgment on Sabo's MHPA claim \"because the MHPA does not provide for a private right of action and thus benefits the public at large as opposed to a particular class of individuals.\" (\n    <em>\n     Id.\n    </em>\n    at 24.) However, in its Reply Brief, Defendant \"agrees that the MHPA provides for a private right of action, but it is important to note that it does so only for persons in treatment.\" (ECF No. 51 at 10.) The Court will not fully address this argument because it is undisputed that Sabo was \"in treatment\" at UPMC Altoona after her involuntary commitment on August 6, 2015.
