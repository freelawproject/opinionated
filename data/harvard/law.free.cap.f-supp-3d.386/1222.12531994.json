ECF No. 108. The Court will deny the motion.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   <strong>\n    I. BACKGROUND\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   In this patent dispute, Looksmart claims that Microsoft's Bing search engine and related services infringe Looksmart's patent, U.S. Patent Number 7,356,530 (the \" '530 patent\"). Complaint (\"Compl.\"), ECF No. 1 \u00b6 29.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   Looksmart filed this action on August 15, 2017. ECF No. 1. On May 22, 2018, Looksmart served its damages contentions pursuant to this district's local rules. ECF No. 108-3. In its contentions, Looksmart stated that it would pursue damages in the form of a reasonable royalty.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 3. With the caveat that further discovery was necessary, Looksmart set forth \"several potentially relevant approaches\" for calculating that royalty.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 5. For instance, Looksmart posited that using a 1.3 percent royalty rate, as applied to \"Bing search advertising revenue,\" would produce a royalty of about $575 million.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 6. Looksmart also provided a \"supplemental analysis\" setting forth several methods of estimating the incremental profit derived from the '530 patent's improvements to search latency.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 7. Finally, the damages contentions briefly reviewed other factors of potential relevance set forth in\n   <em>\n    Georgia-Pacific Corp. v. U.S. Plywood Corp.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3170522\" index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp/318/1116/\">\n    318 F.

ECF No. 108-3 at 12-16.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   On March 15, 2019, Looksmart served its expert damages report, authored by Michael Lasinski. ECF No. 109-5. Lasinski opined that approximately $39.5 million would be an appropriate royalty over the lifetime of the patent.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3170522\" index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp/318/1116/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   at 6 &amp; n.7. The report explained that the '530 patent's technology enabled Microsoft to achieve the same performance for Bing using fewer servers.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 6. Lasinski then based his damages calculation on the incremental costs Microsoft was able to avoid from deploying additional servers and related hardware.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   On April 23, 2019, Microsoft filed this motion to strike Lasinski's report, arguing that his avoided cost theory of damages was not disclosed by Looksmart's damages contentions. ECF No. 108. Looksmart opposed the motion, asserting in part that a failure to disclose a damages theory in its contentions did not foreclose it from later pursuing that theory. ECF No. 113. After the motion was fully briefed, the Court requested supplemental briefing on various issues related to this district's Patent Local Rule 3-8, the source of the damages contentions requirement. ECF No. 123. The parties then filed supplemental briefs, ECF Nos. 124, 125, and the Court held a hearing on June 27, 2019.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   <strong>\n    II. DISCUSSION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   The Court first considers the parties' threshold dispute regarding the requirements of this district's Patent Local Rules, then turns to the specific facts of this case.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   <strong>\n    A. Patent Local Rules\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   Although this motion concerns damages contentions, much of the parties' dispute turns on the degree to which damages contentions should be treated similarly to infringement and invalidity contentions under this district's Patent Local Rules. The Court thus briefly reviews those requirements.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   <strong>\n    1. Infringement and Invalidity Contentions\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   As the Federal Circuit has described, the need for this court's local rules arose because \"allowing the parties to discover their opponent's theories of liability ... ha[d] been difficult to achieve through traditional discovery mechanisms such as contention interrogatories.\"\n   <em>\n    O2 Micro Int'l Ltd. v. Monolithic Power Sys., Inc.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3805486\" index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/467/1355/#p1365\">\n    467 F.3d 1355\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 1365 (Fed.

In particular, \"[a]nswers to such interrogatories [we]re often postponed until the close of discovery, or [we]re amended as a matter of course during the discovery period.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3805486\" index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/467/1355/#p1365\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   (citations omitted). The Patent Local Rules \"address[ed] this problem by requiring both the plaintiff and the defendant in patent cases to provide early notice of their infringement and invalidity contentions, and to proceed with diligence in amending those contentions when new information comes to light in the course of discovery.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3805486\" index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/467/1355/#p1365\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   at 1365-66 ;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Woods v.

Patent L.R. 3-1. Infringement contentions must include a detailed claim chart, specifically identifying each claim of each patent alleged to be infringed, as well as information as to how the accused products infringe each claim.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3514693\" index=\"6\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/692/1272/#p1280\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   Within 45 days of receiving a party's infringement contentions, the opposing party must serve its invalidity contentions. Patent L.R. 3-3. Patent Local Rule 3-3 mandates that invalidity contentions set forth that party's theories of patent invalidity, including, where relevant, the specific items of prior art and an explanation of how they invalidate each patent claim.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3514693\" index=\"7\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/692/1272/#p1280\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   Patent Local Rule 3-6, in turn, limits a party's ability to amend infringement or invalidity contentions, stating that such amendments \"may be made only by order of the Court upon a timely showing of good cause.\" Patent L.R. 3-6.

Supp. 3d 934\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 946 (N.D. Cal. 2018) (collecting cases). In conjunction with Patent Local Rule 3-6, this limitation on expert reports means that a party wishing to advance new arguments or theories must move diligently to seek leave to amend in order to present those points in an expert report, and ultimately, at trial. The Federal Circuit has recognized the necessity of this enforcement mechanism, explaining that \"[i]f the parties were not required to amend their contentions promptly after discovering new information, the contentions requirement would be virtually meaningless as a mechanism for shaping\n   the conduct of discovery and trial preparation.\"\n   <em>\n    O2 Micro\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3805486\" index=\"12\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/467/1355/#p1365\">\n    467 F.3d at 1366\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   <strong>\n    2. Damages Contentions\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   While the framework for infringement and invalidity contentions is well developed at this point, the locus of the parties' dispute is Patent Local Rule 3-8, a relatively recent addition.

If parties know that damages contentions may bear no relation to a party's ultimate theories and thus become stale immediately upon service, the Court fails to see how their disclosure effectively serves any of the above purposes.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    O2 Micro\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3805486\" index=\"44\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/467/1355/#p1365\">\n    467 F.3d at 1366\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (\"If the parties were not required to amend their contentions promptly after discovering new information, the contentions requirement would be virtually meaningless as a mechanism for shaping the conduct of discovery and trial preparation.\").

Noting that Patent Local Rule 3-8 otherwise generally tracks the model rule, Looksmart urges the Court to infer that this district did not intend for Rule 26(e) to apply.

Unlike infringement and invalidity contentions, the local rules did not cabin this duty to amend with a more limited amendment scheme controlled by the court.\n   <em>\n    Cf.\n   </em>\n   Patent L.R. 3-6 (\"The duty to supplement discovery responses does not excuse the need to obtain leave of court to amend contentions.\"). Notably, Looksmart identifies no analogous category of contentions, under the Patent Local Rules or otherwise, that are treated as one-time obligations that need never be amended. As explained above, nothing in the text of the Patent Local Rules, their purpose, or the relevant case law indicates that damages contentions are unique in this regard.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-52\">\n   The Court therefore holds that Rule 26(e) requires parties to supplement or amend their damages contentions when a party's damages theory shifts \"in some material respect.\" Fed.

ECF No. 124 at 5-6. While Microsoft's argument carries some force, the Court concludes that a leave of court standard is not appropriate for\n   <em>\n    amendments\n   </em>\n   to damages contentions.\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   In particular, the Court finds it significant that, despite the well-established framework requiring leave of court to amend infringement and invalidity contentions, the district did not expressly adopt a similar requirement.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    SAS Inst., Inc. v.

In both cases, Microsoft relies on the potential consequences that would flow from the absence of the requirement, expressing concern that late-stage unilateral amendments will prejudice to opposing parties.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 6-7. These are valid concerns.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-57\">\n   Nonetheless, the Court concludes that Rules 26(e) and 37(c) provide an adequate remedy to deter unduly prejudicial amendments. Rule 26(e)(1)(A) requires a party to amend its damages contentions \"in a timely manner if the party learns that in some material respect the disclosure or response is incomplete or incorrect.\" Fed. R. Civ. P. 26(e)(1)(A). Rule 37(c)(1), in turn, precludes a party who violates that obligation from \"us[ing] that information ... to supply evidence on a motion, at a hearing, or at trial, unless the failure was substantially justified or is harmless.\" Fed.

Case-Specific Analysis\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-60\">\n   With those legal principles in mind, the Court addresses the facts of this case.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-61\">\n   Looksmart first argues that it did not violate any duty to amend because it did not attempt to assert a different category of damages listed in Patent Local Rule 3-8. ECF No. 125 at 10-11; ECF No. 112-14 at 12. Patent Local Rule 3-8 provides examples of categories of damages, such as lost profits, price erosion, convoyed or collateral sales, reasonable royalty, as well as a catchall \"any other form of damages.\" In light of the Court's holdings above, the Court construes this as an argument that any shift in a party's damages theory is not \"material,\" Fed. R. Civ. P. 26(e), so long as the theory falls within the same category.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-62\">\n   Looksmart's position lacks support in the text of the rule. Patent Local Rule 3-8 requires a party to identify not only each category of damages, but also \"its theories of recovery, factual support for those theories, and computations of damages within each category.\" Moreover, Looksmart's approach would strip the duty to amend (and by extension, damages contentions themselves) of any practical significance, as parties could allege an entirely different theory of damages, turning on different facts, and resulting in a drastically different case\n   value. As the Federal Circuit has recognized, Rule 26(e) demands more.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Woods\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3514693\" index=\"59\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/692/1272/#p1280\">\n    692 F.3d at 1280\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (\" Rule 26(e) requires that as\n   <em>\n    theories\n   </em>\n   mature and as the relevance of various\n   <em>\n    items of evidence\n   </em>\n   changes, responses to interrogatories, and particularly contention interrogatories, be corrected or supplemented to reflect those changes.\" (emphasis added)).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-63\">\n   Looksmart's authority is not to the contrary. The\n   <em>\n    Finjan\n   </em>\n   court concluded that amendment was required for a different category of damages, but nothing in its order implies that a party need not amend to assert a different theory under the same category.\n   <em>\n    Finjan\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"60\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2019%20WL%201168536\">\n    2019 WL 1168536\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *1. Similarly, in\n   <em>\n    Twilio\n   </em>\n   , the court gave the assertion of \"lost profits instead of or in addition to a reasonable royalty\" as an example of \"a new theory of recovery\" requiring amendment, but did not address a distinct theory within the same category.\n   <em>\n    Twilio\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"61\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2017%20WL%205525929\">\n    2017 WL 5525929\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *5.\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-64\">\n   Here, the Court need not define with a high degree of precision the extent to which shifts in theories, supporting facts, or computations of damages are sufficiently material to require supplementation under Rule 26(e).

At the hearing, Looksmart identified three general statements that (1) \"a cost savings approach\" was one of several potential damages theories; (2) \"the cost of [Microsoft's] next best alternative that avoids infringement of the Patent-in-Suit ... may also be considered\" to determine Microsoft's willingness to pay; and (3) a licensee's benefit includes \"the full economic costs ... associated with developing, relying on, and using the next-best, practically available, non-infringing alternative.\" ECF No. 108-3 at 3, 5, 16. To say the least, these boilerplate statements do nothing to disclose the basis for Looksmart's actual avoided cost theory.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-66\">\n   Looksmart also pointed to a portion of its damages contentions stating that damages might be based on \"incremental revenues and profits ... attributable to 500 milliseconds in search latency improvement.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 7. Within one of three suggested methods for calculating incremental benefits - a comparison based on a search algorithm agreement between Microsoft and Yahoo - Looksmart's damages contentions identified various \"apportionments that may need to be applied\" to the agreement's royalty rate, including a \"[r]eduction in Yahoo's expenditures for search engine maintenance.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 9. Looksmart further stated that the entire method \"may require a detailed analysis of cost savings Yahoo achieved as a result of the Microsoft / Yahoo search arrangement.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 10. These statements that Looksmart might apply an analysis to another search technology agreement, and that that analysis might include reduced search engine maintenance, are a far cry from letting Microsoft\n   know that Looksmart's damages would be primarily or exclusively based on Microsoft's own avoided server cost.\n   <footnotemark>\n    7\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-67\">\n   The Court thus concludes that the shift in Looksmart's damages theory was \"material.\" Fed. R. Civ. P. 26(e)(1)(A). Nor is there any dispute that Looksmart failed to amend its contentions \"in a timely manner.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-68\">\n   The remainder of Looksmart's argument is devoted to, in effect, whether \"the additional or corrective information has ... otherwise been made known to the other parties during the discovery process or in writing.\" Fed. R. Civ. P. 26(e)(1)(A). Looksmart contends that its damages theory was made known to Microsoft through a series of discovery exchanges and disputes concerning Bing News' query cache, and eventually, server count. ECF No. 112-14 at 8-11.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-69\">\n   The Court first offers a general observation regarding Looksmart's argument. The question asked by a contention interrogatory - or that needs to be provided by a damages contention - is not simply whether a specific subject is potentially in play in the litigation. The purpose is to describe the particular relevance of that subject to a party's theory of infringement, invalidity, or damages. The assertion that this purpose is equally well satisfied by requiring a party to wade through its opponent's discovery material will almost never be reasonable, especially given the volume and complexity of most patent discovery.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Asia Vital\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12531233\" index=\"63\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/377/990/#p1004\">\n    377 F.Supp.3d at 1004\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (\"The post-hoc identification of a needle in a haystack does not cure [a] failure to respond [to a contention interrogatory].\");\n   <em>\n    Apple\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"64\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2012%20WL%203155574\">\n    2012 WL 3155574\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *5 (noting thousands of pages of documents and over five hundred prior art references and explaining that \"[i]t would have been difficult, if not impossible, for Apple to have known which prior art references and evidence were intended to support which theory, without Samsung amending its responses to the contention interrogatories in a timely manner\"). Indeed, the point of contentions is to eliminate the guesswork involved in going through a party's documentary and other evidence.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-70\">\n   Even assuming there might be a case in which a party's discovery adequately placed its opponent on notice as to its damages theories, Looksmart's documents do not reasonably suggest its avoided cost theory. For example, the fact that Looksmart included questions about Bing News and its query cache in voluminous interrogatories, requests for production, and a deposition notice,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   ECF No. 112-15 at 3-5; ECF No. 112-17 at 4; ECF No. 112-21; ECF No. 113-8 at 3, does not compel the understanding that Looksmart's damages theory was premised on avoided cost of Bing News servers. The final two documents in Looksmart's narrative reveal a dispute over Microsoft's obligation to produce information regarding the number of servers, ECF No. 112-23 at 2; ECF No. 112-24 at 2, but this still does not bridge the gap from server count to an avoided cost theory. At bottom, this type of inferential guesswork is precisely what damages contentions are intended to avoid.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-71\">\n   The Court therefore concludes that Looksmart violated Rule 26(e) by failing to amend its damages contentions. Looksmart may nonetheless pursue its\n   previously undisclosed theory in its expert report if it can \"establish[ ] that the failure was substantially justified or is harmless.\"\n   <em>\n    Goodman v.

While we do not fault the district court for its ruling limiting Goodman's physicians' testimony, we think that fairness counsels in favor of applying our newly-clarified rule regarding hybrid experts prospectively.
