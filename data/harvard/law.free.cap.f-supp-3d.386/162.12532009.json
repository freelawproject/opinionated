(Docket No. 101, Ex. 6 at p. 12.) Between 2001 and 2004, PRASA detected volatile organic compounds, including trichloroethylene (\"TCE\") and cis-1, 2-dichloroethene (\"cis-1, 2-DCE\"), in the water supply.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   (Docket No. 101, Ex. 3 at p. 23.)

(Docket No. 101, Ex. 5 at p. 171.) The cis-1, 2-DCE plume is located below PRIDCO's property.

In its motion for summary judgment, the United States: (1) omitted \"five small dollar contracts,\" (2) referred to the cis-1, 2-DCE plume as multiple plumes rather than a single plume, and (3) requested reimbursement for \"all costs,\" a representation that contradicted its request for \"only\" past costs in its motion to limit the scope of judicial review.\n   <em>\n    P.R.

(Docket No. 166, Ex. 2 at p. 2.) The EPA commissioned various contractors, including CDM Smith, Inc., Lockheed Martin, and Alion Science and Technology Corporation, to complete the pre-design investigation and other response actions.

(Docket No. 142, Ex. 9 at p. 7.) PRIDCO is not liable, however, for the response costs incurred by the EPA in connection with the PCE and 1, 1-DCE plumes of contaminated groundwater. Based on the EPA's cost summaries, cost allocations from CDM Federal Programs Corporation, supporting documentation, and prejudgment interest summary, the total response cost for the cis-1, 2-DCE plume is $ 5,398,161.04 as of February 28, 2018.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"81\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%209607\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"81\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%209607\">\n    at p. 8\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-69\">\n   <strong>\n    VI. PRIDCO's Arguments in Opposition to the United States' Motion for Summary Judgment are Unavailing\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-70\">\n   The linchpin of PRIDCO's argument in opposition to summary judgment is that the United States withheld \"detailed information regarding costs and allocations\" in violation of Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 26 (\" Rule 26\"). (Docket No. 153 at p. 16.) This argument is unconvincing.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-71\">\n   PRIDCO claims that the expert reports by Wright, Osborne, and Kime are insufficient because they lack specific cost analyses regarding the cis-1, 2-DCE plume. (Docket No. 153 at pp. 18-20.) Rule 26 required the United States to disclose a written report identifying any witness \"retained or specially employed to provide expert testimony in the case or one whose duties as the party's employee regularly involve giving expert testimony.\" Fed. R. Civ. P. 26(a)(2). This report must set forth a \"complete statement of all opinions the witness will express and the basis and reasons for them,\" and the \"facts or data considered by the witness in forming them.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"82\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%209607\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-72\">\n   PRIDCO's allegations of discovery violations are unwarranted and untimely. PRIDCO cites no authority for the proposition that expert reports must contain a specific cost analysis.

Thus, the report is adequate under Rule 26.\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-73\">\n   Pursuant to the Court's order, PRIDCO was to receive the expert reports from Osborne, Wright and Kime on April 2, 2018. (Docket Nos. 136.) The United States disclosed a cost report on March 1, 2018 to provide PRIDCO with \"an idea of past costs EPA incurred responding to the Site.\" (Docket No. 153, Ex. 1 at p. 1.) PRIDCO then requested a report that isolated the costs incurred in response to the cis-a, 2-DCE plume. (Docket No. 153 at p. 16.) Subsequently, the United States timely\n   disclosed the expert cost reports. (Docket No. 158 at p. 6.) PRIDCO did not present an expert witness regarding costs, nor did PRIDCO depose the United States' cost experts. (Docket No. 153 at p. 16.) Additionally, PRIDCO did not file a motion to compel the disclosure of cost-related discovery. Not until the eve of the deadline to oppose the United States' motion for summary judgment did PRIDCO raise an alleged Rule 26 violation. (Docket No. 158 at p. 5.) In light of these circumstances, the Court is unconvinced that a Rule 26 violation occurred, or that any such violation would justify denying the United States' motion for summary judgment.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Fern\u00e1ndez-Salicrup v.
