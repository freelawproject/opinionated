Background\n      </strong>\n     </p>\n     <p id=\"p-10\">\n      Plaintiff, Daniel M. Johnson (\"Plaintiff\"), began working for DLLR in 2001. (ECF No. 3, at 3). In January of 2016, Plaintiff \"informed Defendants that he was losing a substantial amount of vision due to diabetes.\" (\n      <em>\n       Id.\n      </em>\n      ). \"At this time, he began the interactive process of requesting accommodations.\" (\n      <em>\n       Id.\n      </em>\n      ). The process continued through September of 2016. (\n      <em>\n       Id.\n      </em>\n      ). At some unspecified point DLLR \"requested that Plaintiff ... visit a physician to determine whether he was fit for duty.\" (\n      <em>\n       Id.\n      </em>\n      ). \"Ultimately, that physician determined that [Plaintiff] would be unable to perform the essential functions of his job due to the lack of normal eye sight.\" (\n      <em>\n       Id.\n      </em>\n      , at 3-4). \"Based on the ... advice of the physician, [DLLR] placed [Plaintiff] on involuntary leave which became unpaid leave after June 20, 2016.\" (\n      <em>\n       Id.\n      </em>\n      , at 4). Plaintiff continued \"the interactive process and requested various accommodations.\" (\n      <em>\n       Id.\n      </em>\n      ). DLLR \"denied the accommodations requested by [Plaintiff][.]\" (\n      <em>\n       Id.\n      </em>\n      ). \"By October of 2016, Plaintiff ... was forced to take disability retirement because he was no longer being paid and accommodations had not been granted to permit him to perform the essential functions of his job.\" (\n      <em>\n       Id.\n      </em>\n      , at 4-5).\n     </p>\n     <p id=\"p-11\">\n      Plaintiff \"filed a charge of employment discrimination with the Baltimore office of the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission\" (\"EEOC\") on December 15, 2016, \"alleging employment discrimination based on [his] disability, blindness.\" (ECF No. 17-2, at 1). Plaintiff's charge was transferred to the Maryland Commission on Civil Rights (\"MCCR\") through a worksharing agreement between the EEOC and MCCR on April 24, 2017. (ECF No. 11-2). MCCR sent Plaintiff a letter on June 21, 2017, acknowledging that Plaintiff \"elected to have the case forwarded directly to an investigative unit to be scheduled for a Fact Finding Conference.\" (ECF No. 17-1, at 9). The letter further stated that:\n     </p>\n     <p id=\"p-12\">\n      Pursuant to \u00a7 20-1013 of the State Government Article, a Complainant also has the ability to commence a civil action against the Respondent on his or her own behalf in an appropriate State court with respect to an alleged discriminatory employment practice that forms the basis of a charge issued by the Commission. The Complainant may commence such civil action if: (1) the Complainant initially filed a timely administrative charge or complaint under federal, State, or local law alleging an unlawful employment practice by the respondent; (2) at least 180 days have elapsed since the filing of the administrative charge or complaint; and (3) the civil action is filed within 2 years after the alleged unlawful employment practice occurred.\n     </p>\n     <p id=\"p-13\">\n      (\n      <em>\n       Id.\n      </em>\n      ). A fact-finding conference was held on April 5, 2018. (ECF No. 17-2, at 2). Plaintiff's counsel was not able to attend the fact-finding conference in person and instead participated through Plaintiff's \"cell phone and use [of] its speaker phone capacity.\" (\n      <em>\n       Id.\n      </em>\n      ). Plaintiff states in his declaration that his counsel \"attempted to participate and ask questions\" but the investigator \"informed [Plaintiff's counsel] that he could not participate in any way and that only those personally involved in the case could speak.\" According to Plaintiff, the investigator unfairly \"did allow [DLLR's counsel] to participate in the Conference\" and DLLR's counsel \"took the lead on explaining the Department's side of the case.\" When Plaintiff \"challenged the investigator as to why [DLLR's counsel] could participate and [Plaintiff's counsel] could not, the investigator said that [DLLR's counsel] had been advising [DLLR] during the time period prior to [Plaintiff's] termination and was involved with the facts and circumstances involved with [Plaintiff's] employment situation.\" Plaintiff states that his counsel similarly advised him during the time period prior to his termination. Plaintiff notes that he attended \"a few meetings with [DLLR] where\" accommodations and a return to work were discussed and \"[DLLR's counsel] was not present[.]\" During the conference, Plaintiff's counsel \"attempted to speak a couple of times to assist [Plaintiff], and the investigator advised him that if he continued, she would end the [c]onference.\" Defendants contend in a declaration of Sarah P. Harlan, who represented DLLR at the conference, that \"counsel for Plaintiff attempted to make evidentiary objections as if the conference were a formal hearing subject to the rules of evidence\" and that the \"[i]nvestigator advised Plaintiff's counsel that he was not permitted to participate in such a manner.\" (ECF No. 11-2, at 3). When Plaintiff \"confirmed that [his counsel] would not be allowed to participate in [the] [fact-finding conference] in any way, [Plaintiff] decided to leave because ... [DLLR] would be allowed to rely upon its lawyer and have her participate directly in the [c]onference, and [Plaintiff] would not have [the] benefit of [his counsel].\"\n     </p>\n     <p id=\"p-14\">\n      Plaintiff's complaint was \"administratively closed\" due to a \"failure to cooperate\" on April 5, 2018. (ECF No. 11-2, at 13).

So the Tenth Circuit's gloss on Title VII is confessedly adventurous, and this will distress originalists. It is also in severe tension with the Supreme Court's recent observation, concerning the \"exhaustion\" provisions in both Title VII and the Age Discrimination in Employment Act, that \"neither of these provisions makes reference to the concept of exhaustion, and neither is in any sense an exhaustion provision.\"\n      <em>\n       Woodford v. Ngo\n      </em>\n      ,\n      <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3500482\" index=\"60\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/548/81/\">\n       548 U.S. 81\n      </extracted-citation>\n      ,\n      <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3500482\" index=\"61\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/548/81/\">\n       126 S.Ct. 2378\n      </extracted-citation>\n      ,\n      <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3500482\" index=\"62\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/548/81/\">\n       165 L.Ed.2d 368\n      </extracted-citation>\n      (2006). Title VII imposes procedural requirements as a precondition to bringing a suit in federal court that is an original proceeding rather than one to review agency action ... Title VII does not incorporate anything like the full apparatus of exhaustion, an apparatus designed as we have noted for cases in which judicial review of an adjudication or a rule is sought. We shall continue for convenience to refer to Title VII's \"exhaustion\" requirements, but they must not be confused with the requirements for APA-type exhaustion.\n     </p>\n     <p class=\"attorneys\" id=\"p-35\">\n      The decisive objection to the Tenth Circuit's position is that if widely adopted it would protract and complicate Title VII litigation, and with little or no offsetting benefit if we are right in thinking that the problem of complainants who by failing\n     to cooperate with the Commission thwart the conciliation process and as a result thrust additional cases on the federal courts is a slight one. In\n      <em>\n       Shikles\n      </em>\n      the complainant's lack of cooperation could be established with unusual ease: he refused to be interviewed, failed to provide the EEOC with the documents that it requested, failed to explain why he could not provide them, and his lawyer failed to respond to several of the EEOC's efforts to reach him. In the next case, however, the complainant might sit for the interview but refuse to answer questions. In the case after that he would answer questions but do so cryptically. And in a subsequent case he would answer questions fully but fail to bargain in good faith over the employer's offer of a settlement.\n     </p>\n     <p class=\"attorneys\" id=\"p-36\">\n      For the \"cooperation\" theory of exhaustion requires not merely pro forma compliance with the Commission's regulations but, as\n      <em>\n       Shikles\n      </em>\n      put it, a \"good faith effort at cooperation.\"\n      <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8920816\" index=\"63\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/426/1304/#p1317\">\n       426 F.3d at 1317\n      </extracted-citation>\n      .

Defendants incorrectly argue that\n      <em>\n       Mach Mining\n      </em>\n      overrules\n      <em>\n       Oberweis Dairy\n      </em>\n      .\n      <em>\n       Mach Mining\n      </em>\n      concerned the Title VII requirement that the EEOC attempt conciliation of a discrimination charge prior to filing a law suit, and the Seventh Circuit's determination \"that alleged failures by the EEOC in the conciliation process simply do not support an affirmative defense for employers charged with employment discrimination.\"\n      <em>\n       EEOC v.

The Supreme Court, in reversing the Seventh Circuit, stated that \"The EEOC must try to engage the employer in some form of discussion (whether written or oral) so as to give the employer an opportunity to remedy the allegedly discriminatory practice.\"\n      <em>\n       Mach Mining\n      </em>\n      ,\n      <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12588813\" index=\"81\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/135/1645/\">\n       135 S.Ct. at 1656\n      </extracted-citation>\n      . As Defendants concede, the \"facts of\n      <em>\n       Mach Mining\n      </em>\n      are obviously not on all fours with the instant case.\n      <em>\n       Mach Mining\n      </em>\n      defines what administrative efforts the EEOC must undertake before it initiates litigation against an employer. It does not say what a private plaintiff must do to properly meet his or her exhaustion requirements.\" (ECF No. 11-1, at 15). This distinction is critical. The Court expressly rejected the argument that courts should \"do a deep dive into the conciliation process\" and \"consider whether the EEOC has 'negotiate[d] in good faith' over a discrimination claim.\"\n      <em>\n       Mach Mining\n      </em>\n      ,\n      <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12588813\" index=\"82\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/135/1645/\">\n       135 S.Ct. at 1653\n      </extracted-citation>\n      . The Court further noted that Title VII is\n     \"a law that treats the conciliation process not as an end in itself, but only as a tool to redress workplace discrimination.\"\n      <em>\n       <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12588813\" index=\"83\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/135/1645/\">\n        Id.\n       </extracted-citation>\n      </em>\n      <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12588813\" index=\"83\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/135/1645/\">\n       at 1654\n      </extracted-citation>\n      .

In coming to this conclusion, the Court walked through the plain language of the statutory requirements.\n      <em>\n       <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12588813\" index=\"85\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/135/1645/\">\n        Id.\n       </extracted-citation>\n      </em>\n      at 1649-50 ;\n      <em>\n       see also\n      </em>\n      <em>\n       Oberweis Dairy\n      </em>\n      ,\n      <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3350754\" index=\"86\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/456/704/\">\n       456 F.3d at 708-09\n      </extracted-citation>\n      (detailing the limited statutory requirements a Title VII plaintiff must meet to file suit in federal court). A similar reading of the statute is appropriate here.\n     </p>\n     <p id=\"p-39\">\n      The statutory text does not support Defendants' argument. The plain language of 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 2000e-5(b) requires the EEOC to attempt conciliation prior to filing suit in federal court. (\"If the Commission determines after such investigation that there is reasonable cause to believe that the charge is true, the Commission shall endeavor to eliminate any such alleged unlawful employment practice by informal methods of conference, conciliation, and persuasion.\"). \u00a7 2000e-5 does not place an obligation of good faith conciliation on the allegedly aggrieved complainant. A plaintiff is not statutorily required to prove what efforts, if any, he or she made to conciliate. Indeed, \u00a7 2000e-5(b) severely restricts information concerning conciliation.\n      <em>\n       <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3350754\" index=\"87\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/456/704/\">\n        Id.\n       </extracted-citation>\n      </em>\n      (\"Nothing said or done during [conciliation] may be ... used as evidence in a subsequent proceeding without ... written consent[.] Any person who makes public information in violation of this subsection shall be fined not more than $1,000 or imprisoned for not more than one year, or both.\"). Accordingly, it is not clear, as a matter of law, that a plaintiff must do more than file a timely claim, and receive a right to sue notice, in order to satisfy the statute.\n     </p>\n     <p id=\"p-40\">\n      In any event, the facts here do not establish conclusively that Plaintiff failed to cooperate. He clearly did not wholly fail to cooperate with the EEOC. He filed a charge with the EEOC, thus putting the employer on notice of the alleged violation and affording the parties the opportunity potentially to resolve the matter outside of court. He cooperated with the EEOC for 477 days, and awaited the EEOC's right to sue letter. Even if it is appropriate to delve into the \"good faith\" of a plaintiff in the conciliation process, the record at this time contains material disputes of fact and does not support the grant of summary judgment to Defendants on this issue.\n     </p>\n     <p id=\"p-41\">\n      <strong>\n       IV.
