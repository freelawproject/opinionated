When tasked with elucidating the standard to be applied on final certification under the FLSA in\n   <em>\n    Zavala\n   </em>\n   , we eschewed an approach derived from Rule 23, holding instead that\n   <em>\n    the standard to be applied to determine whether FLSA final certification is appropriate is \"whether the proposed collective plaintiffs are 'similarly situated\n   </em>\n   .' \"\n   <em>\n    Zavala\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3508544\" index=\"11\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/691/527/\">\n    691 F.3d at 536\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (citation omitted). This approach makes sense because \"Congress clearly chose not to have the Rule 23 standards apply to [statutory] class actions [such as those under the FLSA]\" by adopting not a \"commonality\" or \"predominance\" requirement, but rather\n   <em>\n    a finding that the collective plaintiffs are \"similarly situated\n   </em>\n   .\"\n   <em>\n    Thiessen\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9500362\" index=\"12\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/267/1095/\">\n    267 F.3d at 1105\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .
