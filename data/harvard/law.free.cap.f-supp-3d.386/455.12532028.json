Jones III, United States District Judge\n   Plaintiffs Michael and Brandy Gress (\"Plaintiffs\") bring this class action against Defendant Freedom Mortgage Corporation (\"Defendant\") on behalf of a multi-state putative class claiming breach of contract (Count I); violation of various state consumer protection statutes\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   on behalf of the multi-state putative class (Count II); violation of the Pennsylvania Unfair Trade Practices and Consumer Protection Law (\"UTPCPL\"), 73 P.S. \u00a7\u00a7 201-1,\n   <em>\n    et seq.\n   </em>\n   , on behalf of the Pennsylvania cases (Count III); violation of the Pennsylvania Fair Credit Extension Uniformity Act (\"FCEUA\"), 73 P.S. \u00a7 2270.1,\n   <em>\n    et seq.\n   </em>\n   , on behalf of the Pennsylvania cases (Count IV); and unjust enrichment on behalf of the Pennsylvania cases (Count V). Plaintiffs filed their Complaint on March 5, 2019. (Doc. 1). Presently pending before the Court is Defendant's Motion to Dismiss pursuant to Rules 12(b)(1), 12(b)(2), and 12(b)(6) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, filed on April 17, 2019. (Doc. 21). The Motion has been fully briefed, (Docs. 22, 26, 27), and is ripe for review.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   <strong>\n    I. FACTUAL BACKGROUND\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   We take the following facts from Plaintiffs' Complaint and assume them to be true, as we must.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   On May 30, 2017, Plaintiffs purchased a home in Mercersburg, Pennsylvania, and executed a mortgage agreement on behalf of their lender. (Doc. 1 at \u00b6 50). The loan and mortgage were later assigned to Defendant. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 51). The mortgage instrument was a form document that included the following provision:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote class=\"attorneys\" id=\"p-12\">\n   If (a) Borrower fails to perform the covenants and agreements contained in this Security Agreement, (b) there is a legal proceeding that might significantly affect Lender's interest in the Property and/or rights under this Security Agreement (such as a proceeding in bankruptcy, probate, for condemnation or forfeiture, for enforcement of a lien which may attain priority over the Security Instrument or to enforce laws or regulations), or (c) Borrower has abandoned the Property, then Lender may do and pay for whatever is reasonable or appropriate to protect Lender's interest in the Property and rights under this Security Agreement, including protecting and/or\n   assessing the value of the Property, and securing and/or repairing the Property.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 56). Plaintiffs suffered financial difficulties, which resulted in a missed mortgage payment in 2017. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 58). Despite falling behind, however, Plaintiffs made subsequent monthly payments on October 31, 2017, November 30, 2017, January 6, 2018, and February 21, 2018. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 59). Plaintiffs also contacted Defendant about the default and notified Defendant that they intended to become current on the mortgage and still occupied the house. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 60). Defendant ordered a property inspection of Plaintiffs' home and assessed a fee of $15 against Plaintiffs for the inspection on February 21, 2018. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6\u00b6 62-63). Plaintiffs paid the $15 fee on March 31, 2018. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 66).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   Plaintiffs continued to make monthly payments on March 31, 2018, April 30, 2018, May 31, 2018, and June 30, 2018. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 67). Thereafter, Plaintiffs again suffered a financial setback and missed a mortgage payment that had been due on August 1, 2018, followed by a late payment on September 14, 2018, for the payment due on September 1, 2018. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 69). As before, Plaintiffs contacted Defendant about the defaults and reiterated that they intended to bring themselves current on the loan and that they continued to occupy the residence. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 70). Plaintiffs and Defendant also discussed a potential loan modification. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 71). On October 10, 2018, Plaintiffs sent Defendant a loan modification application. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 72). Defendant ordered three more property inspections and assessed $15 fees for the inspections to Plaintiffs on August 21, 2018, October 1, 2018, and October 31, 2018. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6\u00b6 74-75). Plaintiffs paid these fees on February 7, 2019. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 78). The fees assessed for each of the four property inspections appeared on account statements Plaintiffs received from Defendant. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6\u00b6 79-80). The statements included the assessed fees in the amount owed by Plaintiffs on their mortgage. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 80).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   Plaintiffs aver that thousands of other borrowers around the country are also being charged for these property inspection fees by Defendant. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 82). According to Plaintiffs, Defendant automates the ordering and performance of property inspections. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 17). Defendant's computer system automatically searches for accounts that have been in default for a particular period and orders property inspections of the mortgaged properties. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 18). The only factor determining when the computer will order a property inspection is the length of time an account has been in default, not whether an inspection is reasonable or appropriate under the circumstances, according to Plaintiffs. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6\u00b6 19, 21). Once ordered, an inspector drives by the property to determine whether it has been abandoned and then electronically sends inspection reports back to Defendant's computer system. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6\u00b6 25, 26). These inspections occur even when Defendant knows or should know that the property is not abandoned. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 28). The system continues to order inspections of the same properties, sometimes monthly, until the borrower becomes current on the loan. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 33).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   <strong>\n    II. DISCUSSION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   Defendant moves to dismiss Plaintiffs' Complaint pursuant to Rule 12(b)(1) (lack of subject matter jurisdiction), Rule 12(b)(2) (lack of personal jurisdiction), and Rule 12(b)(6) (failure to state a claim upon which relief can be granted) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure. As to Rule 12(b)(1), lack of subject matter jurisdiction, Defendant argues that Plaintiffs lack standing to represent out-of-state putative class members for violations of other states' laws. As to Rule 12(b)(2), Defendant argues that out-of-state putative class\n   members lack personal jurisdiction over Defendant in Pennsylvania. Finally, Defendant argues that, for a variety of reasons, Plaintiffs have failed to adequately plead a claim for relief under Rule 12(b)(6). We will begin with Defendant's standing argument under Rule 12(b)(1).\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-90\">\n    California Consumer Legal Remedies Act,\n    <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Cal.%20Code%20%C2%A7%201750\">\n     Cal.

We concede that this is a murky area of law lacking Third Circuit precedent and populated by the divergent conclusions of district courts.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-24\">\n    Article III standing requires an \"injury in fact,\" a causal connection between the injury and conduct complained of, and redressability.\n    <em>\n     Lujan v.

As noted, there appears to be no dispute that Plaintiffs have standing to state their own claims under Pennsylvania law. Furthermore, there is no indication that Plaintiffs are attempting to allege that\n    <em>\n     they\n    </em>\n    can recover under the laws of other states. Finally, Defendant is not articulating a challenge to the potential standing, or lack thereof, of\n    <em>\n     putative\n    </em>\n    class members. Rather, Defendant essentially suggests that Plaintiffs may not allege the claims of out-of-state putative class members on their behalf because Plaintiffs do not personally have standing for those claims.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-25\">\n    Several of our sister courts within the Third Circuit have agreed with Defendant's position.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    <em>\n     In re Insulin Pricing Litig.\n    </em>\n    , 3:17-cv-699,\n    <extracted-citation index=\"18\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2019%20WL%20643709\">\n     2019 WL 643709\n    </extracted-citation>\n    (D.N.J.

Moreover, the Supreme Court's holding clearly did not establish some new \"bright line\" rule as it relates to specific jurisdiction. Indeed, the Court explicitly stated that its holding was rooted in settled principles of specific jurisdiction. Instead, the Court's primary aim, it appears to us, was to stop the gradual creep of the boundaries of specific jurisdiction, which the California Supreme Court's \"sliding scale approach\" would have accomplished. None of this is to suggest that the Court's ruling did not introduce confusion, as it most certainly did, but instead that the Court's holding appears to have been somewhat targeted to a certain factual scenario, which is not present before us. This may explain why the Court chose not to clarify the applicability of the ruling to federal cases or to class actions, even if such clarification would have been dictum.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-46\">\n    Taking all of this into consideration, we will decline to apply\n    <em>\n     Bristol-Myers Squibb\n    </em>\n    to the case at bar.

Discussion\n    </strong>\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-55\">\n    Defendant advances several arguments based on Rule 12(b)(6). Broadly speaking, Defendant argues that Plaintiffs' claims must be dismissed because (1) Plaintiffs did not satisfy a condition of the contract that they provide Defendant notice and an opportunity to cure before filing suit; (2) the mortgage agreement expressly allows the inspections and fees; and (3) the property inspection fees were reasonable and appropriate. Regarding the claims under state consumer protection laws, Defendant argues that Plaintiffs were not deceived about the inspection fees and that the alleged violations of the Pennsylvania Fair Credit Extension Uniformity Act (FCEUA) are not supported. Finally, Defendant contends that Plaintiffs' unjust enrichment claim fails because the conduct at issue is the subject of an express contract. We will begin with Defendant's argument\n    that Plaintiffs failed to satisfy a condition precedent.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-56\">\n    <strong>\n     a.

Rule 9(c) states: \"In pleading conditions precedent, it suffices to allege generally that all conditions precedent have occurred or been performed.\" Fed. R. Civ. P. 9(c).

Read separately, each section appears to be straight forward. However, when considered together, as part of the whole contract, the relationship between Section 9 and 14 becomes less clear. Both sections refer to actions Defendant\n    could take to protect its \"interest in the Property\" and \"rights under this Security Instrument.\" Both sections also indicate that Defendant can charge back any costs to Plaintiffs. Section 14 simply says Defendant \"may charge\" Plaintiffs for the fees, while Section 9 states that incurred costs \"become additional debt\" of Plaintiffs, which \"shall bear interest at the Note rate from the date of disbursement....\" (\n    <em>\n     Id.\n    </em>\n    ).\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-72\">\n    Defendant contends that Section 14 should be read as a specific provision that controls the general provision of Section 9 with respect to property inspection fees upon default.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    <em>\n     Eighth North-Val, Inc. v.

While the principle of the specific controlling the general makes good logical sense where contract provisions appear to be inconsistent, we are not certain that is the case here.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-73\">\n    The central thrust of Section 14 concerns loan charges and specifically authorizes property inspection fees in cases of default. The remainder of Section 14 addresses whether fees can be charged or not (i.e., fees not expressly authorized can still be charged, but fees expressly prohibited cannot) and the steps to be taken if the loan is subject to laws that set maximum loan charges and the loan exceeds that maximum. In addition, as noted earlier, Sections 9 and 14 appear to handle charge-backs differently, with the charges in Section 14 seeming to be separate and akin to interest charges, while the costs in Section 9 are added to the total debt, which would itself bear interest. In other words, one could reasonably construe Section 14 as authorizing property inspections in default cases, where reasonable and appropriate, and permitting Defendant to charge inspection fees to Plaintiffs as a separate item, rather than adding those fees to the total interest-bearing debt. Because the two provisions, taken together, are susceptible to more than one reasonable interpretation, we find them to be ambiguous. Ambiguous contract terms are for the fact-finder to determine, and dismissal at this stage would be inappropriate.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-74\">\n    <strong>\n     c. The Fees Were Reasonable and Appropriate\n    </strong>\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-75\">\n    Defendant argues that the fees, in any case, were reasonable and appropriate. Whether they were reasonable and appropriate, however, is plainly a fact-intensive question. Here, Plaintiffs plausibly alleged that the property inspections were automatically triggered upon default, regardless of any other circumstances, and potentially were not even reviewed by Defendant. Thus, Plaintiffs have plausibly alleged that the inspections were neither reasonable nor appropriate, which is sufficient to survive a motion to dismiss.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-76\">\n    <strong>\n     d. Plaintiffs Were Not Deceived by the Fees and Violations of the Pennsylvania Fair Credit Extension Uniformity Act are Unsupported\n    </strong>\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-77\">\n    Defendant next suggests that Plaintiffs claims under state consumer protection laws fails because Plaintiffs were not deceived by the inspection fees and that the alleged violations of the Fair Credit Extension Uniformity Act (\"FCEUA\") are unsupported. Both sides seem to agree that the consumer protection claims sound in fraud and must be pled with particularity. Fed R. Civ. P. 9(b) (\"In alleging fraud or mistake, a party must state with particularity the circumstances constituting fraud or mistake.\").\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-78\">\n    Plaintiffs appear to base their claims on general \"fraudulent or deceptive conduct which creates a likelihood of confusion or of misunderstanding.\" 73 P.S. \u00a7 201-2(4)(xxi).\n    <footnotemark>\n     2\n    </footnotemark>\n    Plaintiffs further allege that Defendant's violation of the FCEUA constitutes a violation of Pennsylvania's consumer protection law, as well.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-79\">\n    Starting with the consumer protection laws, to base a claim on generally fraudulent or deceptive conduct, Plaintiffs must show not only a deceptive or fraudulent act, but that they \"justifiably relied on [Defendant's] wrongful conduct or representation and that [they] suffered harm as a result of that reliance.\"\n    <em>\n     Hunt v. U.S. Tobacco Co.\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4127940\" index=\"134\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/538/217/#p223\">\n     538 F.3d 217\n    </extracted-citation>\n    , 223 (3d Cir. 2008) (quoting\n    <em>\n     Yocca v.

Plaintiffs' allegations unfold as follows: (1) Defendant presented Plaintiffs with mortgage documents indicating that they would only pay for reasonable and appropriate fees; (2) Defendant knew that under its automated property inspection system, Plaintiffs would be charged for fees regardless of whether the inspections were reasonable or appropriate; (3) Defendant included the fees on Plaintiffs' periodic account statements; (4) Plaintiffs had no reason to believe that the charges on their statements were unreasonable or inappropriate; (5) the statements did not indicate that the charges were unreasonable or inappropriate; (6) relying on the statements to be accurate, Plaintiffs paid for the inspection fees under the assumption that they must be reasonable and appropriate. (Doc. 1 at \u00b6\u00b6 136-141).\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-80\">\n    Assuming Plaintiffs allegations to be true, it is plausible that Defendant knew its practice of automatic property inspections could, at least sometimes, result in unreasonable or inappropriate fees charged to its customers. Those customers, such as Plaintiffs, relying on the language of the mortgage agreement and the expectation that Defendant would not charge them for unreasonable fees, plausibly could have been deceived into thinking that Defendant was only requesting property inspections after considering whether the inspections were reasonable and appropriate. Although admittedly Plaintiffs' consumer protection allegations are thin, we find that they are nonetheless sufficient at this early stage to proceed to discovery.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-81\">\n    Turning now to Plaintiffs' claims under the FCEUA, we note that Plaintiffs plead a separate count for violating the FCEUA (Count IV) but also allege a violation of the FCEUA in support of its claim under the UTPCPL. At the outset, the separate count for the FCEUA must be dismissed because the FCEUA \"does not provide its own private cause of action; rather, it is enforced through the remedial provision of the UTPCPL.\"\n    <em>\n     Kaymark v.

We do not, however, preclude Plaintiffs from alleging an FCEUA violation as an additional ground under Plaintiffs' UTPCPL claim. Defendant argues that Plaintiffs' FCEUA allegations fail because the fees were expressly authorized by the mortgage agreement. However, the central matter to be resolved by the finder of fact is whether the property inspection fees needed to be reasonable and appropriate. To the extent\n    that they did, and assuming that Defendant's automatic inspection practice is found to have been unreasonable, then those fees were\n    <em>\n     not\n    </em>\n    expressly authorized under the circumstances. Therefore, we will not preclude Plaintiffs from pursing their FCEUA allegations as support for their UTPCPL claim in Count III.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-82\">\n    <strong>\n     e. Unjust Enrichment Claim Fails Because Conduct is Subject to an Express Contract\n    </strong>\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-83\">\n    Finally, Defendant argues that Plaintiffs' claim for unjust enrichment must fail because the conduct at issue is the subject of an express contract. \"[I]t has long been held in this Commonwealth that the doctrine of unjust enrichment is inapplicable when the relationship between parties is founded upon a written agreement or express contract, regardless of how 'harsh the provisions of such contracts may seem in the light of subsequent happenings.' \"\n    <em>\n     Wilson Area Sch.
