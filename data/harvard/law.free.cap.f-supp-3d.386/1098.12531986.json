Plaintiffs filed a response (Doc. 317) and Defendants a reply (Doc. 322). Oral argument was held on February 6, 2019. (Doc. 390).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     Background\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   Joshua David Mellberg, LLC (\"JDM\") is a financial advisory firm. Throughout the years, JDM developed numerous confidential and proprietary business practices and trade secrets. JDM takes significant measures to protect that confidential information and has a policy that requires all employees to return any physical embodiments of confidential information and trade secrets to JDM upon the termination of their employment. JDM alleges that the Defendants, former employees of JDM, misappropriated JDM's confidential information and caused JDM significant financial damages.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   In August 2015, Plaintiffs submitted their initial disclosure statement (\"August 2015 Disclosure\") indicating they were seeking over $ 85,000,000.00 in damages in connection with their underlying claims. (Doc. 317, pg. 2). In that disclosure, Plaintiffs identified eleven categories of damages, with lump-sum estimates for eight of\n   the categories but provided no computations to support those estimates. (Doc. 310, pg. 5). Two months before the May 2017 expert witness deadline, Plaintiffs disclosed Lynton Kotzin (\"Mr. Kotzin\"), as their damages expert. Mr. Kotzin produced an expert report (the \"Kotzin Report\") pursuant to Rule 26(a)(2)(B) which estimated that if liability were found, the amount of economic damages to JDM would be $ 16,340,000.00. This figure reflected Mr. Kotzin's estimation of two categories of damages: lost profits and a diminution of JDM's company value.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   On June 12, 2018, Plaintiffs disclosed that their interim CFO, Paul Crooks (\"Mr. Crooks\"), would present a new cost-based damages methodology via a supplemental disclosure statement. Mr. Crooks began his employment with JDM as a consultant in finance and operations in January 2017 and transitioned into JDM's interim Chief Financial Officer in the Summer of 2017. He stayed in that role until July 2018, when a full-time CFO was hired. (Doc. 327-3, pg. 9). In September 2018, Plaintiffs disclosed Mr. Crooks's supplemental disclosure statement. (\"September 2018 Disclosure\"). That disclosure statement included calculations prepared by Mr. Crooks and largely based loss amounts on a theory of unjust enrichment with an actual total loss amount of $ 107,310,000.00.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   On October 12, 2018, Defendants filed a Motion to Exclude Plaintiffs' Untimely Damages Evidence. (Doc. 310). Specifically, Defendants argue: (1) Mr. Crooks is an expert witness in lay witness clothing; (2) Mr. Crooks is an expert witness and was not timely disclosed; and (3) Mr. Crooks's testimony should be excluded.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     Analysis\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   <em>\n    1.

Personal Knowledge\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   Rule 701 requires that Mr. Crooks's testimony be \"rationally based on [his] perception.\" Defendants take an overly expansive view of the personal knowledge component in Rule 701, claiming that since Mr. Crooks was not employed at JDM from 2010 through 2013, and his damages analysis is based on information,\n   documents, and statements from 2010 through 2013, he does not satisfy the personal knowledge requirement.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   (Doc. 310, pg. 7) (\"Crooks' damages analysis is based on information from 2010 through 2013. But he did not perform any services for JDM until January 2017 and admits that he has no personal knowledge of events at JDM before then.\") (internal citation omitted).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   The personal knowledge requirement in Rule 701 is not a requirement that a witness be personally present or involved in every interaction that he or she is testifying to.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    United States v.

Personal knowledge is also not knowledge that a witness possesses only if it is a party to an event. Even though Mr. Crooks was not employed with JDM from 2010 through 2013, if he is familiar with JDM's financial records due to his employment with JDM, he will have met the personal knowledge requirement even if the documents that he is reviewing were prepared by other employees.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Lightning Lube, Inc. v.

Mr. Crooks began his employment with JDM as a consultant in finance and operations in January 2017 and became JDM's interim CFO in July 2017. By July 2018, a full-time CFO was hired and Mr. Crooks stepped down from that position and transitioned to a new role as president of Mellberg Wealth Management, an LLC jointly owned by Mr. Crooks and JDM. (Doc. 327-4, pg. 8). Therefore, Mr. Crooks was only employed with JDM for a period of approximately one and one-half years. However, even while Mr. Crooks served as JDM's interim CFO, it appears that he was nothing more than a part-time employee.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   Mr. Crooks testified that he only traveled to Tucson to work for JDM three times per month and stated: \"Generally speaking, I work between 30 and 40 percent of a month, as much as 50, depending on the needs of the organization.\" (Doc. 327-3, pg. 8).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   Notably, Mr. Crooks did not even consider himself to be JDM's CFO.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   (Doc. 327-4, pg. 7) (\"Q.

Specialized Knowledge\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-72\">\n   Rules 701 also requires that Mr. Crooks's testimony not be \"based on scientific, technical, or other specialized knowledge within the scope of Rule 702.\" While it appears that any testimony that requires some specialized knowledge removes it from the ambit of Rule 701, courts have acknowledged certain exceptions to this rule.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-73\">\n   The Advisory Committee notes to Rule 701 provides one such example:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-74\">\n   For example, most courts have permitted the owner or officer of a business to testify to the value or projected profits of the business, without the necessity of qualifying the witness as an accountant, appraiser, or similar expert.

Given this calculation, plus the money the franchisees would have earned in the first four years, [the Franchise Owner] predicted that he would have earned $ 27,729,000 in future profits from the 117 existing contracts through 1996. Next, [the Franchise Owner] calculated the lost profits on the franchises he expected to have sold.

You used your professional judgment and knowledge of the industry to do that?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-107\">\n   A.

And that's why there's so many incentives on that as that becomes very valuable. I sampled about 5,000 appointments. I couldn't go back to the period because the data wasn't clean enough to do that way back then, but I was able to go back and sample 5,000 appointments and create a slice by tenure of all these advisors which created this curve that's here.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-112\">\n   (Doc. 327-4, pg. 33).\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-113\">\n   A.

And those were advertising and digital and other.\"). It is evident that rather than utilizing his personal knowledge garnered from his experience as JDM's interim CFO, Mr. Crooks has conducted his analysis of JDM's financials utilizing specialized knowledge that is properly within the purview of Rule 702.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-123\">\n   <em>\n    2. Will Defendants Suffer Prejudice?\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-124\">\n   Since Mr. Crooks is providing expert testimony, the Court will next determine whether his late disclosure is prejudicial. Although Plaintiffs disclosed that they were seeking over $ 85 million in damages in their August 2015 Disclosure, that initial disclosure statement was submitted to Defendants at a relatively early stage in the litigation and was unsupported by any financial analysis or calculations. Plaintiffs allege that this early stage allegation of $ 85 million in damages provided Defendants with adequate notice. (Doc. 317, pg. 2) (\"Thus, although Defendants disingenuously argue that JDM seeks to increase its damages from $ 16 million to $ 95 million, in reality Defendants have known for years that JDM was seeking over $ 85 million from early on in this litigation, and thus, cannot seriously contend they are now somehow surprised that JDM is seeking over $ 95 million.\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-125\">\n   Ordinarily, parties should strive to provide clear and timely disclosures. The expert witness deadline lapsed in May 2017 and Plaintiffs chose only to disclose Mr. Kotzin as an expert witness on damages. Plaintiffs also elected only to provide the Kotzin report, which merely covered two categories of damages. Plaintiffs were keenly aware that majority of their damages categories still required additional input. Plaintiffs could have requested an extension of the expert witness deadline but neglected to do so. \"Implicit in Rule 37(c)(1) is that the burden is on the party facing sanctions to prove harmlessness.\"\n   <em>\n    Yeti by Molly, Ltd. v. Deckers Outdoor Corp.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9501104\" index=\"23\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/259/1101/#p1107\">\n    259 F.3d 1101\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 1107 (9th Cir. 2001). Plaintiffs assert that their delay in disclosure is harmless, but Plaintiffs' arguments solely rely on their contention that Mr.\n   Crooks is a lay witness.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   (Doc. 317, pg. 17) (Plaintiffs claim that Defendants will not be prejudiced by their inability to submit a rebuttal expert report because Mr. Crooks is a lay witness, and \"there is no such thing as a rebuttal lay witness report.\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-126\">\n   Defendants allege that \"[i]f Plaintiffs had properly and timely disclosed Crooks and his $ 80 million in new damages, then Defendants would have: (1) subpoenaed him to obtain all supporting documents, data, and communications; (2) submitted a rebuttal expert report; and (3) had the opportunity to conduct follow-up discovery to test the assumptions and data underlying Crooks' analysis.\" (Doc. 310, pg. 16). The Court finds Defendants' argument convincing. Not only is it concerning that Plaintiffs elected to provide their September 2018 Disclosure without any supporting documentation, but Plaintiffs' disclosure was also knowingly belated and deprived Defendants of the ability to properly respond. The September 2018 Disclosure should be treated as an expert report and Defendants should have had the opportunity to conduct follow-up discovery and challenge Mr. Crooks's expert opinion with a rebuttal expert report and additional discovery.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-127\">\n   <em>\n    3. What is the Appropriate Sanction for the Late Disclosure?\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-128\">\n   Since the Court has determined that Mr. Crooks is providing expert testimony and that Defendants will suffer prejudice from the late disclosure, the Court's final inquiry relates to the appropriate sanction. The Court notes that this is not a case involving an untimely disclosure for a legitimate reason. Rather, Plaintiffs provide no explanation for their belated disclosure. Rather, Plaintiffs candidly admit that the disclosure was late, but, rationalize it by writing: \"at most, Crooks' Calculations were only four months late.\" (Doc. 317, pg. 20).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-129\">\n   Fed. R. Civ. P. 26(a)(1)(A)(iii) requires parties to disclose a computation of each category of damages in a timely manner. Plaintiffs timely disclosed that they were seeking over $ 85 million in damages in August 2015. They timely disclosed computations for some damage categories in the Kotzin Report, but postponed disclosing the majority of those computations until September 2018. \"Courts are more likely to exclude damages evidence when a party first discloses its computation of damages shortly before trial or substantially after discovery has closed.\"\n   <em>\n    Martin v. Collier\n   </em>\n   , No. 2:11-CV-00320-LRH,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"24\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2012%20WL%202564890\">\n    2012 WL 2564890\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *2 (D. Nev. July 2, 2012).\n   <em>\n    See also, e.g.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    Quevedo v. Trans-Pac.

Even though Plaintiffs' extraordinarily late disclosure can possibly be mitigated by re-opening discovery, exclusion is the appropriate sanction. The Court believes Plaintiffs are fully aware that Mr. Crooks's testimony is properly situated as expert testimony and have introduced him in as a lay witness to circumvent the long-expired expert witness deadline. Not only is Plaintiffs' strategy concerning, their attitude with respect to their late disclosure by claiming it is \"only 4 months\" late is troublesome. Deadlines are in place to be respected.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-131\">\n   Further compounding Plaintiffs' current discovery violation is their litany of prior\n   transgressions and inability to fairly engage in the discovery process. The record is littered with countless examples of Plaintiffs failing to: meet deadlines, reasonably negotiate with Defendants, and follow court orders.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   , (Doc. 209, pg. 3) (\"The Court directed the parties to meet and confer regarding both search terms and the process for the search. After two months, agreement has not been reached and it appears Plaintiffs are impeding progress.\");\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 4 (\"Because Plaintiffs did not timely propound formal discovery as required by the Federal Rules, the Court upheld Defendant Impact's objection to responding to Plaintiffs' untimely informal request.\"); (Doc. 199, pg. 3) (\"At the February status conference, Defendant Impact Partnership expressed concern about the completeness of Plaintiffs' responses to its document requests ... At the recent March conference, the parties had not reached agreement. Although Plaintiffs have begun to conduct searches, they had not negotiated with Defendant on the terms to be used or the process, as the Court had intended.\"); (Doc. 217, pg. 2) (\"The Court's deadline in the April 19 Order was firm, as reflected in the set deadline of May 7 for Defendants to respond to Plaintiffs' brief on this topic. The Court has encouraged the parties to meet and confer and believes issues are best resolved between counsel. But, this case is old and firm deadlines are necessary to complete discovery in the limited time remaining. Because Plaintiffs did not comply with the Court's deadline, the Court will not allow the discovery as requested by Plaintiffs.\"); (Doc. 223, pg. 2-3) (\"At the status conference, the Court directed the parties to brief this issue. The Court notes that this is the third Court deadline Plaintiffs' counsel has missed without seeking an extension. This has occurred despite Plaintiffs' counsel repeatedly affirming their preference for the Court to assist the parties by overseeing the discovery schedule.\"); (Doc. 234, pg. 3-4) (\"Plaintiffs did not produce any documents until four months after the protective order was entered ... Defendant has identified responsive documents that were not produced as well as 'gaps' in Mellberg emails that indicate a lack of production ... However, after the Court reviewed the extensive exhibits provided by Defendant and the evidence provided by Plaintiffs, as summarized above, it is persuaded that Plaintiffs' search for emails has not been adequate.\"); (Doc. 246, pg. 4) (\"Plaintiffs failed to fully comply with the requirements of the Order.\"); (Doc. 246, pg. 5, n.3) (\"Counsel for Defendant Will indicated, at the May 9 status conference, that he had informed Plaintiffs of his willingness to allow a search within the parameters now being ordered by the Court. If Plaintiffs had acceded to this reasonable negotiation position during the meet and confer process, the Court's involvement could have been minimized.\"); (Doc. 271, pg. 2) (\"Plaintiffs did not meet that deadline and did not notify opposing counsel or the Court of their inability to do so.\"); (Doc. 271, pg. 4) (\"Plaintiffs requested that the mirror images be searched by someone other than the individual Defendants and they were granted two rounds of keyword searches by a neutral vendor. Therefore, the Court assumes almost all relevant documents were produced during that process. To the extent any relevant documents were missed, that was discoverable by Plaintiffs from the DTI spreadsheets. The Court has already denied discovery based on those spreadsheets. Plaintiffs' attempt to evade that denial will not be allowed.\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-132\">\n   Considering the numerous discovery violations committed by Plaintiffs, the complete lack of an explanation as to the belated disclosure, the extreme untimeliness of the disclosure, and the prejudice to Defendants,\n   the Court finds that exclusion is the appropriate remedy.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-133\">\n   Accordingly, IT IS ORDERED:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-134\">\n   1. Defendants' Motion to Exclude Plaintiffs' Untimely Damages Evidence (Doc. 310) is granted.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-135\">\n   2.
