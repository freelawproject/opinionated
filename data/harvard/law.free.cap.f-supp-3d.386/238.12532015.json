Plaintiffs Jeffrey Farkas, M.D., LLC, d/b/a Interventional Neuro Associates (\"Farkas\") and Alicea Sherise (\"Patient\" or \"the patient\") assert a cause of action against defendants Cigna Health and Life Insurance Company (\"Cigna\") and Program Development Services, Inc. (\"PDS\") for (1) recovery of benefits under ERISA Section 502(a)(1)(B), codified as\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=29%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201132\">\n    29 U.S.C. \u00a7 1132\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a)(1)(B), and (2) breach of fiduciary duty under ERISA Section 502(a)(3), codified as\n   <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=29%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201132\">\n    29 U.S.C. \u00a7 1132\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a)(3).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   Plaintiffs seek $332,300 in billed charges for emergency brain surgery performed by Farkas, an out-of-network medical provider, on Patient after she suffered a stroke and multiple brain aneurysms.

They contend,\n   <em>\n    inter alia\n   </em>\n   , that: (1) plaintiffs' claim for benefits should be dismissed because the failure to apply a provision in the insurance plan providing non-network doctors 100% reimbursement for \"Emergency Room\" services did not amount to an abuse of discretion; and (2) plaintiffs' fiduciary duty claim should be dismissed because it seeks the same monetary remedy sought in the claim for benefits.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   Summary judgment is granted.
