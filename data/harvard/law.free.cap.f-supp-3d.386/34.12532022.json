Perhaps. But the Humane Society has all it needs to tie these records to particular facilities. The Service released the licensees' names and\n   customer ID numbers.

Not so. Once the Service removes the improper redactions from the veterinary records and inspection reports, the Humane Society will have a wealth of information to evaluate the Service's monitoring of veterinary care.

The Secretary of Agriculture has delegated to the Service the authority to ensure compliance with and enforcement of the AWA \"through inspections, enforcement, education, and cooperative efforts.\"\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"125\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=7%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%20371.7\">\n    7 C.F.R \u00a7 371.7\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-62\">\n   The Service thus uses inspection reports to administer and enforce compliance with the AWA on an ongoing basis. Woods Decl. 1 \u00b6\u00b6 68, 70. If an inspector finds a deficiency that requires correction, he notes the applicable regulation, a description of the problem, and a deadline to correct the deficiency.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"126\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=7%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%20371.7\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"126\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=7%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%20371.7\">\n    \u00b6 9\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

So inspection reports are related to the Service's delegated law enforcement authority.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-63\">\n   Ultimately, this finding is of little help to the Service. Like Exemption 6, Exemption 7(c) requires balancing individuals' privacy interest against the public's interest in disclosure.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Stern v.

Yes, \"Exemption 7(C)'s privacy language is broader than the comparable language in Exemption 6.\"\n   <em>\n    U.S. Dep't of Justice v.

But even under Exemption 7(C)'s broader standard, the Service's withholding of the narratives and descriptions of noncompliant conduct is improper.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-64\">\n   Recall that there is no personal privacy interest in \"shoddy work,\" and the Service has not sufficiently shown a risk of harassment. More, the Humane Society has some interest in monitoring the Service by reviewing inspection reports. On balance, the Court finds that releasing information other than the licensee's addresses and third parties' names could not \"reasonably be expected to constitute an unwarranted invasion of personal privacy.\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"132\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=5%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20552\">\n    5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (b)(7)(C).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-65\">\n   <strong>\n    C.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-66\">\n   An agency must disclose \"[a]ny reasonably segregable portion\" of an otherwise exempt record.\n   <extracted-citation index=\"133\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=5%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20552\">\n    5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (b). An agency cannot withhold non-exempt portions of a document unless they \"are inextricably intertwined with exempt portions.\"\n   <em>\n    Mead Data Central, Inc. v.

The Service \"conducted a line-by-line analysis of each responsive document to determine whether any non-exempt material could be released,\" and \"[w]here reasonably segregable non-exempt material was identified, it was released.\" Woods Decl. 1 \u00b6 75. The Service's\n   <em>\n    Vaughn\n   </em>\n   Index further supplies the relatively detailed justification necessary to find that the Service has carried its burden.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-68\">\n   The Humane Society complains that certain photographs could have been further unredacted.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   , Cross-Mot. at 46 (citing\n   <em>\n    Vaughn\n   </em>\n   index explanation for withholding of photos of veterinary records). But those photos were redacted because they included descriptions or depictions of noncompliant conduct.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g., Vaughn\n   </em>\n   Index at 14-15. Because the Court has found that those withholdings were improper, the portions of the photos depicting or describing noncompliant conduct will be released. The Humane Society has not pointed to evidence that would otherwise overcome the presumption that the agency met its obligation. Thus, despite the Service's improper withholding of certain information, the Court finds that the Service has otherwise met its burden to release all reasonably segregable material.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-69\">\n   <strong>\n    IV.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-70\">\n   The Service properly withheld the licensees' addresses and contact information from the inspection documents. It also properly withheld third-parties' names, images, and personally identifying information. But the Service's other withholdings-dates, inspection narratives, animal inventories, and so on-were improper, and the Service must now disclose that information to the extent it is reasonably segregable from the information properly withheld.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-71\">\n   For the foregoing reasons, the Plaintiff's Cross-Motion for Summary Judgment will be granted in part and denied in part, and the Defendants' Motion for Summary Judgment will be granted in part and denied in part.
