Compl. \u00b6 1.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   Montel alleged that the Officers violated and conspired to violate his civil rights under section 1983 and Massachusetts General Laws chapter 12, sections 11H and I (counts III, IV, and V).

Officers' Mem. 7-11. For Montel's claims under sections 11H and 11I of chapter 12 of the Massachusetts General Laws (the \"Massachusetts Civil Rights Act\"), the Officers argue that Montel cannot show a violation of his rights by means of threats, intimidation, or coercion.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 12-14. The Officers contend that Montel's intentional infliction of emotion distress (\"IIED\") claim must fail because their actions do not rise to the level of extreme and outrageous conduct beyond all bounds of decency.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 14-15. Finally, the Officers maintain that they cannot be liable for assault and battery because their use of force was justified.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 15-17.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   Springfield argues that Montel cannot show \"a constitutional violative act by the [Officers],\" which dooms his claims against the City.
