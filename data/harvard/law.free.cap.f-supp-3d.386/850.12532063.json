LUDINGTON, United States District Judge\n   On May 4, 2017, Plaintiff filed a complaint against Praxair, Inc. (\"Praxair\") and Fiba Technologies, Inc. (\"Fiba\") for injuries sustained from an explosion involving a hydrogen trailer (the \"Trailer\"). Compl., ECF No. 1. On December 19, 2017, Plaintiff filed an amended complaint adding Defendants Fike Corporation (\"Fike\") and Chart Industries (\"Chart\").\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   Am. Compl., ECF No. 27.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   This opinion and order addresses the following five pending motions. On December 3, 2018, Fike filed a motion for summary judgment. ECF No. 80. The next week, Plaintiff filed a motion to amend his complaint a second time. ECF No. 84. On January 25, 2019, Plaintiff's motion to amend his complaint was denied. ECF No. 97. Plaintiff filed a motion to reconsider the Court's order denying his motion to amend, which will be addressed by this opinion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   On January 25, 2019, Praxair filed a motion to exclude the testimony of Plaintiff's two experts, Thomas G. Witte and Michael D. Klein. ECF No. 100. Praxair contends that Witte's calculations of the Trailer's vacuum are scientifically unsound and incorrect. Praxair also contends that Plaintiff cannot call Witte as a witness because his conclusion that the Trailer's pressure rose to an unsafe level contradicts Plaintiff's testimony to the contrary. Finally, Praxair argues that Klein's testimony should be excluded because he failed, in assessing causation, to analyze and exclude alternative ignition sources for the explosion. A few days later, Fiba filed a motion to exclude Klein's testimony. ECF No. 101. Like Praxair, Fiba argues that Klein failed to assess alternative ignition sources. Fiba also contends that Klein's determination that the Trailer's vent stack rain flap did not fully open is not supported by the evidence. The next week, Fiba filed a notice of concurrence with Praxair's motion. ECF No. 111.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   On February 4, Praxair and Fiba filed separate motions for summary judgment. ECF No. 106, 108.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   Following a brief explanation about hydrogen and its transportation and a brief recitation of the relevant facts, each of the motions will be addressed in turn.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   <strong>\n    I.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   <strong>\n    A.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   The following information involving the transportation and delivery of hydrogen was obtained from depositions and the various expert reports and appears largely uncontested.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   Hydrogen is typically transported in its liquid form. However, liquid hydrogen transforms from a liquid to a gas at a very low temperature, -423 degrees Fahrenheit. It is the lightest known gas and is 7/100ths as heavy as air. Accordingly, it is imperative that the liquid hydrogen remain at a low temperature within the trailer during transportation. As the temperature within the trailer rises, the liquid hydrogen will begin converting to a gas. Because hydrogen gas occupies more space than liquid hydrogen, the pressure within the trailer will increase.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   The trailer is designed to keep the hydrogen at a low temperature. To accomplish this, the trailer has an inner and an outer container. The inner container contains the hydrogen and the outer container holds the inner container. Between the two is an empty space maintained in a vacuum, helping sustain a low temperature within the inner container. Despite the vacuum, the inner container's temperature will inevitably rise. The design of the trailer cannot prevent this, only slow the progression. However, the quality of the vacuum will affect how quickly the temperature rises. The better the vacuum, the slower the rise in temperature. The poorer the vacuum, the quicker the rise in temperature.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   The effectiveness of a vacuum is measured in microns which can be measured in one of two ways: cold microns and warm microns. A cold micron reading is measured while the trailer holds hydrogen. A warm micron reading is measured while the trailer is empty. The maximum safe micron level differs between cold microns and warm microns. The higher the micron reading, the higher the vacuum temperature. The lower the micron reading, the lower the vacuum temperature. A low micron reading is indicative of an effective vacuum. When a vacuum temperature rises to a certain micron level, it is deemed unsafe.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   While liquid hydrogen is being transported, it can only be held in the trailer for a certain amount of time because its temperature will increase and become a gas. This will cause the pressure within the trailer to increase. Eventually, the pressure will reach a level that the trailer can no longer contain the hydrogen gas. At this point, the gas must be permitted to escape or the trailer may explode.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   To facilitate a controlled release of hydrogen, the trailer is equipped with three safety release mechanisms. The first is the back pressure regulators which provide the smallest amount of pressure release at 135 psig. If the pressure increases beyond the capability of the back pressure regulators, then the spring loaded safety relief valves will activate. The spring loaded safety relief valves provide a medium amount of pressure release at 150 psig. And finally, if the pressure increases beyond the capability of the spring loaded safety relief valves, the rupture discs will activate. As the name implies, the discs with rupture and release a high amount of pressure at 219 psig.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   All three of these safety relief mechanisms channel into the trailer's vent stack which releases the hydrogen gas into the air outside the trailer. The release of hydrogen gas can be dangerous because hydrogen has a broad flammability range and requires only a low level of energy to ignite. 0.02 millijoules of energy can ignite hydrogen which is less than seven percent of the energy needed to ignite natural gas. Hydrogen can ignite from the slightest source, such as static electricity or friction. For this reason, it is imperative that the vent stack and the trailer itself be constructed of material and in a manner that eliminates any such ignition source from being present.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   The trailer has a pressure gauge that the driver can view from their seat. Praxair instructs its drivers to monitor the pressure level within the trailer. If the pressure rises more than 0.2 psig over two hours, drivers must stop, find a safe location, and vent the trailer.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   Upon arriving at their destination, drivers must attach a hose from the trailer to the receiving hydrogen tank. The driver activates a switch on the tank and it automatically lowers the tank pressure to 135 pounds. The driver then must manually lower the tank pressure to 120 pounds and increase the trailer pressure to 135 pounds. It is dangerous for the trailer to exceed 135 pounds of pressure because the trailer's maximum pressure is 150 pounds. The difference in pressure between the trailer and the tank forces the hydrogen to flow from the trailer into the tank. It is important that the difference in pressure be great enough that the hydrogen is forced to flow between the two. Otherwise, the hydrogen will not flow into the tank and the pressure within the trailer will continue to build. The optimal difference in pressure is 15 pounds.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   <strong>\n    B.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   The incident at issue occurred on December 22, 2014. Plaintiff was scheduled to deliver hydrogen from East Chicago, Indiana to Hemlock Semiconductor in Hemlock, Michigan. Pl.'s Dep. at 39, ECF No. 55-1. The trailer used to deliver the hydrogen was Trailer 4855 (\"Trailer\"). Am. Compl. at 3, ECF No. 27.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   Prior to making the delivery, Plaintiff inspected the Trailer. ECF No. 55-1 at 36. This included examining the Trailer's valves, meters, hoses, and vent knobs.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Plaintiff also checked to ensure that the Trailer's pressure was below 12 psig. ECF No. 100-9 at 22. Upon arriving at Hemlock Semiconductor, Plaintiff parked the Trailer at one of eight hydrogen tanks. ECF No. 55-1 at 30. He chock blocked the Trailer's tires, lowered the Trailer's airbag, grounded the Trailer, and connected a copper grounding wire to the Trailer.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 49-50. Plaintiff then lowered the pressure in the receiving tank and elevated the pressure in the Trailer.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 53. Hydrogen began pumping from the Trailer into the tank.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 56. At some point, Plaintiff recalls the pressure in the Trailer quickly rising to 140 psig. ECF No. 80-5 at 58. Hydrogen then explosively escaped the Trailer and injured Plaintiff. ECF No. 27 at 5.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   <strong>\n    C.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   Following the incident, Praxair (the owner of the Trailer) developed a Root Cause Analysis (\"RCA\") of the accident on March 31, 2015. Rathgeber Dep. at 136, ECF No. 63-4. The focus of an RCA is first to determine what the employee's injury is and then to determine how the injury occurred.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 24-25. Praxair's Director of Safety for U.S. Industrial Gasses, Dan Rathgeber, was deposed on May 4, 2018 regarding the RCA. Rathgeber explained that during the RCA, Trailer 4855 was inspected \"top to bottom\" and no problems were found.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 129. He did identify two causes of Mr. Guinn's injury. He stated:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-28\">\n   [T]here were two causes. When we say \"caused the incident,\" we need to be talking about the focal point here, and we were looking at the injury to Mr. Guinn, so Mr. Guinn's really lack of operational discipline, not lowering the tank pressure to what the procedures and the requirements were caused the incident. And then him also going to the back of the trailer without his required PPE caused the injury to his - to his\n   head.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   ECF No. 63-4 at 130-131.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   Rathgeber explained the first cause of the accident as follows:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-31\">\n   Mr. Guinn failed to reduce the pressure in the tank to below or at 120 psig based on the data that we have...So when you're delivering liquid hydrogen, one of the first things you do is you start building pressure in the trailer. So Mr. Guinn would be basically taking liquid hydrogen, putting it through an atmospheric vaporizer, kind of like a fin coil where it's absorbing heat. And when any kind of a cryogenic material absorbs heat, it expands and it produces pressure. So he's building the pressure up in his trailer from, roughly, 18 to 50 pounds to his delivery pressure which is going to be below 135 pounds because 135 is the max pressure he should allow that trailer to get to.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-32\">\n   Now, unfortunately what Mr. Guinn did, he was supposed to - we always want to have a 15 pound DP, differential pressure, between the trailer and the tank you're delivering to. So Mr. Guinn tried to put - tried to get the trailer - you know, tried to deliver to a tank that was 130 pounds, with a five pound DP, so the liquid has nowhere to go at that point so it's expanding. He's trying to control pressure, but it has nowhere to go because he hasn't lowered the pressure.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 44-45.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   As part of his report, Rathgeber had prepared a diagram which he referenced during his deposition.\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-35\">\n   This diagram reflects the pressure and level of that tank during the time of the delivery.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-36\">\n   Now, as you can see, this is the delivery that Mr. Guinn made; and the pressure right here never gets below 120. And you can see a small blip in the level, and some of that could be done to the pressure. But you can see over here, a normal delivery where the driver takes it below 120, you can see a linear increase, and so that product now has a place to go and starts increasing the level, and you don't see that over here with Mr. Guinn...\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-37\">\n   And so what I'm saying is that if Mr. Guinn had followed the procedure like he was supposed to and reduce the tank down to 120 psig, the pressure that is built up in the trailer - and the other part of this cause is that Mr. Guinn has full control over many things. One is building the pressure in the trailer, the other is venting the pressure in the trailer as well so you're watching that pressure that's, you know, built into these procedures and what he's trained in to open the vents as the pressure gets higher to make sure that he has a place for that pressure to go as he's watching it.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 47-48.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   Regarding the second cause of the accident, he stated\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-40\">\n   Yeah, so Mr. Guinn's procedures when we have a stack fire is to don his baklava on top of his -- and his hardhat on top of that and, you know, with all of his gloves and everything, go back to the trailer and switch the diverter valve, which, you know, he was somewhat attempting to do, it seems based on the Hemlcok statements, but he was also not wearing his protective equipment.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 130-131.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   <strong>\n    D.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   The case currently has three defendants: Praxair, Fiba, and Fike, but an\n   unusual alignment of the financial interests of the parties. Praxair \"produces, stores, and distributes industrial gases, such as oxygen and hydrogen.\" ECF No. 27 at 3. It owns Trailer 4855.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Plaintiff is not an employee of Praxair, but of Ruan Transportation Management (\"Ruan\"). Ruan contracts with Praxair to provide drivers and, presumably, tractor trucks to transport the liquid hydrogen. Praxair's Mot. Partial Sum. J., ECF No. 55 at 2. As part of Ruan and Praxair's contract, Ruan agreed to indemnify Praxair against all claims and liabilities, except those arising from Praxair's sole negligence. As part of his employment duties for Ruan, Plaintiff transported and delivered Praxair products to Praxair customers. ECF No. 27 at 3. Plaintiff had been working for Ruan for two and a half years when the incident occurred. ECF No. 55-1 at 17.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   Fiba services gas containment equipment, including Praxair's trailers. ECF No. 27 at 4. Fiba typically conducts visual inspections of trailers once a year and a pressure test inspection once every five years.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   Clay Dep. at 15-16, ECF No. 106-14. Fiba had serviced the trailer in October 2014, just two months prior to the incident.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 70. Fiba issued a Certificate of Compliance which provided\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-45\">\n   This is to Certify that FIBA Technologies, Inc. hereby confirms that the product being supplied conforms to the specifications set forth by Purchase Order Number: 60011861, and referenced to FIBA Work Order Number: OH16534...If the product is a trailer, FIBA also certifies that the equipment has been manufactured in accordance with all requirements of the U.S. Federal Motor Vehicle Safety Standards, at the time of manufacture.\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   Fike manufactures burst or rupture discs for hydrogen trailers, including Trailer 4855.

He listed only two defendants, Praxair and Fiba. Plaintiff alleged that Praxair breached its duty of reasonable care in maintaining, testing, and inspecting the trailer.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 4-5. He also claimed that Praxair was negligent by permitting use of the trailer and by \"failing to warn Plaintiff of the signs of valve degradation and the consequences thereof.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 4. Plaintiff further claimed that Fiba breached its duty of reasonable care by negligently testing and inspecting the trailer and failing to recommend its removal from service.\n   <em>\n    See id.\n   </em>\n   at 5-6.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   In the fall of 2017, Praxair and Fiba filed separate Notices of Non-Party Fault. ECF No. 19, 20. Both identified five additional parties, including Fike, not identified in Plaintiff's complaint and alleged that these parties were at fault for Plaintiff's damages. On December 19, 2017, Plaintiff filed his first amended complaint which added Fike as a defendant to the action. ECF No. 27. Plaintiff alleged that Fike\n   \"negligently designed, tested, approved, manufactured, produced and/or recommended the burst or rupture discs used on the subject trailer.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Neither Praxair nor Fiba filed crossclaims.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-50\">\n   <strong>\n    II.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-51\">\n   Plaintiff's motion for reconsideration of the Court's order denying his motion to amend his complaint will be addressed first.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-52\">\n   <strong>\n    A.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-53\">\n   Pursuant to Eastern District of Michigan Local Rule 7.1(h), a party may file a motion for reconsideration of a previous order, but must do so within fourteen days of the order's entry.

Between the inner container and the outer container is annular space with a vacuum design. \"The vacuum is the most critical parameter to limit heat transfer into the inner container and its contents. If too much heat enters the inner container, then the cryogenic liquid warms, expands and begins to boil.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 2. According to Witte, a super insulated tank, such as Trailer 4855, has a vacuum of 1-10 microns cold.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-126\">\n   A tank cannot be filled to capacity with liquid hydrogen.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Unoccupied space must exist because despite the vacuum insulation, the hydrogen's heat will increase while the hydrogen is within the inner container.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   (\"[H]eat is always added to a cryogenic tank and cannot be stopped. The heat transfer can only be slowed down to meet delivery/fill times.\") To address this, tanks are equipped with relief devices. The three types of devices are \"(1) back pressure regulators (smallest flow), (2) spring loaded safety relief valves (medium flow), and (3) rupture discs (highest flow).\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   These relief devices all must tie into a vent stack, which provides a conduit for hydrogen to escape the tanker. Trailer 4855's vent stack had a metal rain flap covering its opening to prevent rain from entering the stack.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-127\">\n   Witte states that the Hemlock Semiconductor System (\"HSC\") is one of the most complex liquid hydrogen systems he has ever seen in his career. One reason is that the HSC system operates above hydrogen's critical pressure of 173.5 psig.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 5. Also, drivers are required to raise the pressure in the trailers to 135 psig in order to pump the hydrogen into the tanker. This is only 15 psig below 150 psig, the level at which the trailer can no longer contain the pressurized hydrogen and must activate the pressure relief mechanisms.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Additionally, the driver must vent the tank down to 120 psig to reach an adequate pressure difference between the trailer and the tanker. However, the HSC signs warn drivers to not drop the pressure below 120 psig when filling the tanker. Witte represents that maintaining the pressure at an exact pressure of 120 psig can be difficult to do.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-128\">\n   Witte then explains the process of pumping hydrogen from a trailer into a HSC tank.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 6. The driver must:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-129\">\n   1. Manually raise the trailer pressure to 135 psig by opening a valve on the trailer's pressure build system.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-130\">\n   2. Activate a switch isolating the receiving tank from the other HSC tanks.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-131\">\n   3.

Begin the fill once the tank pressure reaches 120 psig\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-134\">\n   6. Monitor the pressure within the HSC tank and the Praxair trailer during the delivery. If the pressure in the tank becomes too high, the driver must open the manual vent valve on either the trailer or the tank.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-135\">\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"26\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Mich.%20Comp.%20Laws%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%20600.6304\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-136\">\n   Next, Witte describes the incident involving Guinn and Trailer 4855.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 7. According to Witte, Praxair's fill matrix for determining the maximum amount of liquid hydrogen that the Trailer could hold violated federal law. \"As a result, Praxair trailer 4855 was\n   <strong>\n    overfilled\n   </strong>\n   by 1208 lbs or ~2700 gals of liquid hydrogen.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 9. (bold in original).\n   <footnotemark>\n    8\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-137\">\n   Witte continues by describing Trailer 4855's history of vacuum problems.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 11. Within less than a year, both the \"inner vessel hydro port and the outer casing of the vessel\" had internal and external cracks. From 1991 to 1992, the Trailer was taken out of use and serviced for vacuum issues which involved pumping the vacuum.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Witte explains that pumping the annular space from a vacuum throughout its life compromises its quality because it introduces \"air, water, and other impurities into the annular space.\"\n   <em>\n    See id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-138\">\n   Furthermore, from 1991-2014, there were thirty recorded incidents in which the vacuum reading exceed 50 microns, which Witte deems an \"unacceptable vacuum reading[ ].\"\n   <em>\n    See id.\n   </em>\n   Of particular concern is that during the Trailer's five-year inspection in 2014, the vacuum showed consistent vacuum issues, including a reading of almost 3000 microns, a repeated rise in the micron level during the course of the inspection, and difficulty \"pulling the vacuum.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 13. Witte also represents that the FIBA representative deposed was unaware of the proper vacuum reading for super insulated trailers. \"He testified below 800 microns warm and 100 microns cold are satisfactory readings. He is wrong by a significant factor. On a super insulated LHY trailer a maximum warm vacuum is 140 microns, and cold vacuum is under 10 microns. At 10 microns colds, there is a significant increase in heat transfer that must be monitored by pressure to assure the rupture discs and relief valves do not activate.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 13.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-139\">\n   In addition to the Trailer's vacuum, Witte opined on the condition of the Trailer's rupture discs.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 14. From 2004-2014, Praxair documented a total of thirty-one Trailer 4855 rupture disc failures. Its sister trailer, Trailer 4896 (also manufactured by LOX Corporation), had thirty-six rupture disc failures during that time. Rupture disc failures are rare, as demonstrated by the fact that in Praxair's entire East Chicago fleet, only one other rupture disc failed during that same time period. However, Witte does not attribute the disc failures to Fike, the rupture disc manufacturer. Instead, he opines that \"these rupture disc failures were highly likely caused by bad vacuums and overfilled trailers.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 14.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-140\">\n   Witte concludes his report by summarizing the facts of the incident.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 15. He explains that the Trailer was overfilled at the Praxair East Chicago plant and that by the time Plaintiff arrived at HSC, the liquid hydrogen had expanded to fully fill the trailer or close to it. Witte attributes this increase in pressure to the Trailer's faulty vacuum. He continues by explaining that due to the excess pressure, the safety valves were unable to release an adequate amount of pressure which caused the rupture discs to activate. The sudden drop in pressure after the rupture discs burst caused the liquid hydrogen to quickly boil off, contributing to the severity of the explosion. He also states that the rain flap on the vent stack malfunctioned by not rising to a vertical level which would have provided the hydrogen with an unobstructed exit from the vent stack. The burn marks on the Trailer indicate that the flap was at least partially obstructing the vent stack, directing the explosion in directions other than vertically. He briefly theorizes that \"[t]he ignition could reasonably been [sic] caused by the lights in the area of the vent stack.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 16.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-141\">\n   Witte then lists the failures of each Defendant that contributed to the explosion.

He summarizes his prior findings, which included his assertions that Praxair: did not monitor the tank holding time; did not investigate previous rupture disc failures; did not address the Trailer's historically bad vacuum; did not sufficiently train its drivers or Ruan drivers; the pressure gauges were difficult to read; the signage at HSC was inconsistent with driver delivery instructions; the vent stack did not open fully; the light on the back of the Trailer was not designed to be explosion proof; and Praxair did not require its drivers to wear full protective gear.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-142\">\n   Witte claims that Fiba was \"partially responsible\" for the explosion because it did not fix the historical vacuum problems even though it had inspected and serviced the trailer multiple times over a span of years.

ECF No. 100 at 1. First, his calculations of the vacuum pressure are scientifically \"wrong.\" Second, Plaintiff's testimony that Trailer 4855's pressure did not increase between Chicago and Hemlock bars Plaintiff from calling an expert to testify to the contrary. Witte's assertion that the vacuum pressure rose while Guinn was driving from Chicago to Hemlock is contradicted by Guinn, the party identifying Witte as an expert.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-146\">\n   <strong>\n    a.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-147\">\n   Praxair challenges Witte's calculations of the trailer's vacuum pressure, arguing that he applied the improper reading methodology. In his report, Witte does not specify whether he is referring to microns warm or microns cold. It initially appears that he is using microns cold in his calculation because he begins this section of his report by stating that \"the vacuum was well above the optimum specifications of 1 micron cold.\" ECF No. 116-1 at 10. He then goes on to explain that the temperature rose from 14 microns to ultimately 450 microns, but does not specify whether he is still using cold microns or warm microns.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Presumably he was referring to warm microns because the chart entitled \"Recorded Vacuum Levels above 50 Microns in Trailer 4855\" appears to record the temperature in warm microns.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 12. Not every reading specifies \"warm microns,\" but the reading on November 12, 2014 specifically provides \"Vacuum of 60\n   microns (warm).\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   (parenthesis present in original).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-148\">\n   Praxair argues that Witte used warm micron readings in his calculations, but stated his conclusion in cold microns.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   ECF No. 100 at 9. Witte conceded in his deposition that the calculations he used were warm microns. Witte Dep. at 66, Ex. 4, ECF No. 100-5. Praxair also argues that Clay Carpenter, a FIBA plant manager \"testified that the trailer's post-accident vacuum reading on March 12, 2015 was acceptable based on FIBA's standard for\n   <em>\n    warm\n   </em>\n   vacuum readings.\" ECF No. 100 at 10 (emphasis in original).\n   <footnotemark>\n    10\n   </footnotemark>\n   This distinction is significant because the threshold for excess temperature is different depending on whether warm microns or cold microns is used. If Witte was referring to 200 warm microns, Trailer 4855's temperature would be 60 warm microns in excess of the maximum safe level (140 microns warm). If Witte was referring to 200 cold microns, Trailer 4855's temperature would be 190 cold microns in excess of the maximum safe amount (10 microns cold).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-149\">\n   Additionally, there is disagreement between Witte and Praxair's expert, David J. Eby, as to the maximum temperature that a vacuum can safely maintain. Eby asserts \"Witte simply assumes that a trailer with a [cold vacuum pressure] of anything higher than one-micron is defective, without any supporting calculations, analyses, or test. His opinion is wrong.\" Eby Report at 6, ECF No. 100-6, Ex. 5.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-150\">\n   <strong>\n    b.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-151\">\n   Praxair also argues that Plaintiff should not be permitted to offer Witte's testimony in direct contradiction to Plaintiff's testimony. Witte's deposition provides:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-152\">\n   Q: Because if your opinions are correct, that this vessel had vacuum issues such that the heat transfer would cause an uncontrolled rise in pressure, you would expect to see that during the course of the trip, wouldn't you?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-153\">\n   A: Yes. I would expect to see the pressure going up.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-154\">\n   Witte Dep. at 12, ECF No. 100-5. However, Plaintiff testified that the trailer's pressure was normal when he inspected it before leaving Chicago, the pressure did not increase during his drive to Hemlock, and the pressure was still below 12 psig when he arrived at Hemlock. Guinn Dep. at 22- 27, ECF No. 100-9.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-155\">\n   Praxair further reasons that\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-156\">\n   Guinn also testified that when he arrived to Hemlock, he built trailer pressure from 12 psig to 20 psig to purge the trailer's delivery hoses. This alone belies Witte's theory that trailer pressure was 70-75 psig when Guinn arrived at Hemlock. It also contradicts Witte's theory that Guinn experienced a rapid pressure increase and release of hydrogen within \"milliseconds\" after starting to build pressure. If that were the case, the release of hydrogen would have occurred when Guinn built pressure to purge the trailer's delivery hoses. According to Guinn, that didn't happen.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-157\">\n   ECF No. 100 at 12. Witte's report directly contradicts this because Witte claims that pressure was building within the Trailer as Plaintiff was driving it from Chicago to Hemlock and that the \"trailers [sic] liquid hydrogen had expanded to either liquid\n   full or very close to it.\" ECF No. 100-2 at 16.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-158\">\n   <strong>\n    2.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-159\">\n   In his response, Plaintiff does not meaningfully engage with either of these arguments. He simply asserts that \"Defendant Praxair's arguments about the correctness of Witte's underlying mathematical calculations are really about the correctness of his conclusions, not the reliability of his methodology. In other words, Rule 702 does not permit the district court to evaluate the quality of an expert's data, inputs or conclusions.\" ECF No. 116 at 9-10. In its reply, Praxair argues that Plaintiff's response sidesteps the primary issue, which is whether Witte relied \"on assumptions that are not in accord with established facts\" because his heat transfer calculation \"relied on incorrect assumptions.\"\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   ECF No. 123 at 10 (quoting\n   <em>\n    Badalamenti v.

ECF No. 116 at 10. In its reply, Praxair contends that it only used Eby's report \"to illustrate the trailer's ability to insulate liquid hydrogen in transit at 14 microns cold compared to 200 microns cold.\" ECF No. 123 at 5.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-161\">\n   <strong>\n    3.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-162\">\n   Fiba filed a notice that it concurred with Praxair's motion challenging Witte's testimony. ECF No. 111. In its recitation of the facts, Fiba included more details about the Warm Retention Tests that it performed on Trailer 4855's vacuum. In July 2014, the vacuum was measured at 1 micron warm.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 4. During the next month, the readings rose to 79 microns warm, which Fiba claims is well within its safe vacuum requirements.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 5. Another test was performed in October 2014 and the vacuum reading was 7 microns warm. As part of the test, the pressure in the vacuum was increased to \"working pressure\" and read at 28 microns warm.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Fiba performed a third test and the vacuum reading began at 3 microns warm.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 5-6. Fiba does not state whether the reading rose during this test and if so, to what extent. However, it claims that the Trailer remained within Fiba's safe vacuum requirements. Fiba performed a fourth test prior to releasing the Trailer to Praxair and the vacuum was read at 14 microns warm.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 6.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-163\">\n   Fiba further represents that after the incident, Praxair sent the Trailer to Fiba on March 12, 2015 and the vacuum reading was 91 microns warm.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Praxair sent the Trailer to Fiba again on January 22, 2016 and the vacuum reading was 57 microns warm.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-164\">\n   <strong>\n    4.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-165\">\n   At the hearing on the motion challenging Witte's testimony, Witte testified that a hydrogen trailer should be able to hold a vacuum indefinitely and that a vessel should not be used when it can no longer hold a vacuum. He explained that when a vacuum is faulty, it takes in air. The moisture within the air then attaches to the insulation of the vacuum and freezes solid. It is difficult to remove the moisture once it has entered the vacuum. This is problematic because the moisture increases heat transfer between the outer and inner containers which decreases the effectiveness of the vacuum. Witte described how Fiba had \"pulled\" the Trailer's vacuum multiple times in an attempt to decrease the heat transfer between the two containers. In Witte's opinion, Praxair should instead have stopped using the Trailer. He conjectured that Praxair elected not to dispose of\n   the Trailer because hydrogen trailers cost on average $ 1.2 million.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-166\">\n   Witte explained that Praxair had overfilled the Trailer in Chicago prior to Plaintiff's delivery to Hemlock. Witte determined that if the 17 psig road relief valve had been turned off, that 5,400 pounds would have been the maximum amount of hydrogen that should have been in the Trailer. However, Praxair filled the Trailer to 7,000 pounds. Witte referenced the deposition of Ronald Crague in which Crague testified that he instructed the fill technicians to close the valve. Crague testified that he left it within the driver's discretion as to whether the valve should be open or closed during transportation. Witte also referenced Praxair's handbook for drivers which instructs drivers to keep all valves tightly closed. Plaintiff was allegedly told to keep the valve closed during deliveries to prevent the Trailer from venting while on the highway. Witte also noted that after being filled with hydrogen, the Trailer held the hydrogen for twenty-one straight hours. His report documents that Praxair began filling the Trailer on December 21, 2014 at 11:30 p.m. and completed the fill on December 22, 2014 at 2:15 a.m. Guinn later drove the Trailer to Hemlock, arriving at Hemlock at 8:15 p.m. on December 22, 2014. According to Witte, it is unsafe for a trailer to hold hydrogen for such an extended period of time because the hydrogen will warm and increase the trailer's pressure.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-167\">\n   Witte concluded that because the Trailer was overfilled, it became \"liquid full\" (leaving no space for the hydrogen gas to occupy). He conjectured that the click heard by Plaintiff right before the explosion was the safety valve activating and the accompanying boom was the rupture discs bursting. He acknowledged that his findings are contradicted by Plaintiff's testimony that the Trailer's pressure did not increase from Chicago to Hemlock. However, he explained that regardless of Plaintiff's testimony, the physical evidence supported his conclusion that the Trailer's pressure was building.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-168\">\n   Witte also noted that it was unsafe for Praxair to continue using the Trailer after it had 31 incidents of burst discs activating. He explained that a burst disc activation is considered a \"near miss\" of a more damaging result. He referenced the deposition of Dennis Noel, a Praxair employee who performed maintenance on the Trailer. Dennis Noel Dep., ECF No. 125-8. In his deposition, Noel testified that he had notified Praxair that the burst discs were activating too frequently.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 29 (\"There's times that we've sit down and discussed it and we brought it to their attention and told them that, yeah, there's too many discs being blown, yes.\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-169\">\n   Witte asserted that the Trailer's rain flap is part of the Trailer's safety relief system. He explained that when a rupture disc activates, the hydrogen gas travels through the venting stack at a velocity like a jet engine. He again referenced Noel's deposition in which Noel stated that when the safety system activates, it sometimes bends or blows off the rain flap.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 60 (\"Well, when you have 150 pounds of pressure going through that vent stack with the volume pushing it, sometimes it blows it off completely.\");\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 61 (\"Through past experience with it, usually they bend or they get blown off.\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-170\">\n   When Defense counsel pressed Witte to explain his calculations about the Trailer's temperature and pressure, Witte explained that there were multiple factors that could influence a trailer's temperature, such as whether its vacuum had been filled or when maintenance had been performed on the vacuum.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-171\">\n   <strong>\n    5.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-172\">\n   Defendants present two primary challenges to Witte's testimony. First, that Witte's testimony contradicts Plaintiff's deposition testimony and second, that his calculations incorrectly use warm and cold micron readings interchangeably. Defendants' motion challenging Witte will be denied.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-173\">\n   <strong>\n    a.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-174\">\n   The reports and testimony of all the experts are consistent on at least one point: that the pressure in the trailer rose to a dangerous level prior to the explosion between Chicago and Hemlock. Without some form of over-pressurization, the safety relief system would not have activated and vented the hydrogen. The experts disagree on why the pressure rose to such a level, but all agree that it rose nonetheless. Witte attributes the rise in pressure to Praxair overfilling the Trailer and the inadequacy of the vacuum in the Trailer. Klein has no opinion as to why the pressure rose, but acknowledges that it rose to an excess level. Klein Report at 9, ECF No. 80-3 (\"The partially opened vent flapper created an obstruction and directed the hydrogen being released during the\n   <em>\n    overpressure\n   </em>\n   event towards the rear of the trailer...\")(emphasis added);\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   Klein Dep. at 8-9 (\"Q: My understanding in this case is that you will not be giving opinions as to why the trailer pressure rose and vented hydrogen through the vent stack; is that fair? A: That's true.\"). Eby, Harris, and Rathgeber all attribute the over-pressurization to Plaintiff's failure to properly maintain the Trailer's pressure at a safe level. Eby Report at 22, ECF No. 100 (\"Mr. Guinn failed to maintain pressure in trailer 4855 at or less than 135 psig.\"); Harris Report at 2, ECF No. 96-2 (\"Mr. Guinn's actions of increasing the trailer pressure and not quickly relieving the overpressure, was why the trailer had to release hydrogen.\");\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Rathgeber Dep. at 49, ECF No. 63-4 (\"[I]t doesn't seem based on the data that [Guinn] was monitoring the pressure in his tank very well -- the trailer.\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-175\">\n   Defendants argue that Plaintiff should not be permitted to offer an expert witness who will offer a factual scenario directly contradicted by the Plaintiff's own testimony about the facts. At the hearing, Plaintiff's counsel argued that due to Plaintiff's head injuries, Plaintiff's recollections should not be dispositive of the facts. However, if Witte's report is to be adopted, Plaintiff has offered no explanation as to why he took no action to relieve the Trailer's pressure while driving to Hemlock or prior to pumping the hydrogen into the receiving tank. Plaintiff has not explained why he could not pull off from the highway, park the Trailer, and vent the Trailer. Equally unexplained is why Plaintiff would have built pressure in the Trailer to pump the hydrogen into the Hemlock tank if the Trailer's pressure had already reached a dangerous level. If Witte's testimony is correct, the Trailer's pressure would have reached a significant level by the time Plaintiff began pumping the hydrogen. These actions occurred before the explosion and Plaintiff's alleged head injury. Accordingly, the inconsistencies between his deposition and Witte's report are not explained based on his later brain injury. The unresolved question is why Plaintiff did not relieve pressure in the Trailer when it reached a dangerous level.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-176\">\n   While Plaintiff's decision to offer Witte's testimony includes the risk of harming Plaintiff's case by introducing his comparative negligence, it is Plaintiff's prerogative to introduce it. The Sixth Circuit was presented with a similar scenario in\n   <em>\n    Lee v. Smith &amp; Wesson Corp.\n   </em>\n   in which the conclusions of the plaintiff's expert witness contradicted the plaintiff's testimony.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-177\">\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4147885\" index=\"29\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/760/523/\">\n    760 F.3d 523\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (6th Cir. 2014). The district court excluded the testimony of the expert witness. The Sixth Circuit reversed and remanded the case. The Sixth Circuit explained that the district court should have admitted the testimony of the expert witness despite its discrepancies with the plaintiff's testimony.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4147885\" index=\"30\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/760/523/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4147885\" index=\"30\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/760/523/\">\n    at 526\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

The fact that Witte's testimony implicates Plaintiff's comparative negligence is not a bar to Plaintiff's decision to call Witte as an opinion witness.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-178\">\n   So too here. Plaintiff's testimony does not establish the facts of the case and cannot form the basis for concluding that Witte's report contradicts established fact.

However, Defendants are challenging Witte's data and results, not his methodology in reaching those results. Because Defendants have not demonstrated that Witte's methodology is defective, his testimony will not be excluded. Furthermore, Witte explained that the alleged inconsistencies in his calculations are due to a variety of factors that can influence the calculations' results. Accordingly, he will be permitted to testify and Defendants will have an opportunity to challenge him at trial.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-181\">\n   <strong>\n    B.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-182\">\n   Michael Klein's report represents that he \"is a Professional Engineer, a Certified Hazardous Material Manager and a Certified Fire and Explosion Investigator with 25 years of experience in the design, planning, and delivery of high-value projects for the government and private sectors.\" Klein Report, Ex. 3, ECF No. 72-3 at Ex.

He notes that a photograph of Trailer 4855's venting stack shows that the rain flap is only partially opened. \"This partial opening of the vent flapper would have prevented hydrogen from being directly vented up into the atmosphere during an over pressurization event.

Praxair only permitted Klein to visually inspect the Trailer. Praxair did not permit him to touch the Trailer. His testimony centered on the Trailer's vent stack rain flap which he claimed was a component of the Trailer's safety relief system. He explained that the flap functioned like a see-saw with the flap turning on a bolt. The flap's lid was on one side covering the vent stack and a weight was on the other side acting as a counter-balance. When no gas was being vented through the vent stack, the flap sat level upon the the stack. When gas was being vented, the gas would force the lid to rise into ninety-degree vertical position. When gas was no longer venting, the weight of the lid would cause the rain flap to return to its original level position. Federal regulation requires the rain flap to function in this way.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-208\">\n   (7) Arrangement and location of pressure relief devices.\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-209\">\n   (i) The discharge from any pressure relief system must be directed upward and be unobstructed to the outside of the protective housing in such a manner as to prevent impingement of gas upon the jacket or any structural part of the vehicle.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-210\">\n   (ii) Each pressure relief valve must be arranged or protected to prevent the accumulation of foreign material between the relief valve and the atmospheric discharge opening in any relief piping.

As the hydrogen gas was travelling up the venting stack, it encountered the partially opened rain flap and was deflected downward towards the Trailer. Klein contends that had the rain flap functioned properly, it would have risen to a full vertical position and the hydrogen would have escaped the stack unencumbered. Klein conjectured that the rain flap failed to fully open because the hinge mechanism was too tight.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-213\">\n   However, this alone would not have caused the explosion. Something would have to ignite the hydrogen to cause the explosion. Based upon the burn marks on the exterior of the vent stack and the Trailer, Klein concluded that the Trailer's exterior lights ignited the hydrogen. The burn patterns displayed a \"clean burn pattern\" in which the flames burned the paint off all the way down to the underlying metal. Klein explained that his conclusions based upon the clean burn pattern are supported by the NFPA Guide for Fire and Explosion Investigations. He noted that it was unnecessary for him to recreate the burn because the NFPA Guide supported his conclusion based on his observations of the Trailer's burn pattern. He did\n   not perform his own modelling, but instead relied upon the modelling performed by Praxair.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-214\">\n   He also based his theory on the fact that this safety relief system had activated thirty-one times prior to this incident and an explosion had never occurred in any of those instances. He concluded that the failure of the stack vent flap was because Fiba had replaced the rain flap just six weeks prior to the incident.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-215\">\n   <strong>\n    4.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-216\">\n   Praxair's primary challenge to Klein's report is that he does not eliminate other possible sources of the explosion's ignition, such as electricity or friction. During the hearing, Klein explained that he had considered static and friction as possible ignition sources. However, he ruled these out because the burn pattern would have been different had static or friction ignited the hydrogen. He explained that if friction had ignited the hydrogen, the burn pattern would have been more \"localized.\" In his deposition, he explained\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-217\">\n   ...if you had seen friction it had spilled on there, there would have been a fire pattern closer to where the -- where the fuel had spilled down, it -- friction. But you can see where the -- where the hydrogen moved to the various lighting components throughout the trailer including the back rear lighting on the tanker itself and the lighting that encompassed the doghouse and then the spotlighting that was part of the doghouse itself. All the lights were involved in the fire.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-218\">\n   Klein Dep. at 51, ECF No. 100-4. Based upon Klein's deposition and his testimony at trial, it is apparent that Klein did consider other possible sources of ignition and ruled them out.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-219\">\n   Klein was asked to explain how hydrogen, a gas lighter than air, could have travelled down the trailer. Klein explained that the hydrogen exited the vent stack with such force, that when it encountered the obstructing rain flap, it was forced down. He explained that the speed of the hydrogen gas was such that the flap temporarily deflected the gas down despite it being lighter than oxygen. Though this theory may or may not withstand scrutiny at trial, Defendants have proffered no other explanation for the burn patterns found on the exterior of the Trailer.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-220\">\n   Defendants' motion will be denied and Klein will be permitted to testify as an expert witness.

This disc was designed to operate, or rupture at 219 psi. The safety relief valves are in the same system and are designed to operate at 151 psi. These relief valves still operated properly after the explosion, but did not operate during or before the explosion. This indicates that the rupture disc failed at too low a pressure, before the relief valves activated. This was probably due to hydrogen embrittlement, as later reports indicate. Unlike the relief valves, (which relieve the high pressure, then reseat), the rupture disc bursts and cannot re-close. The premature activation of this rupture disc caused the release of hydrogen and was the major cause of the explosion.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-295\">\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"55\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Mich.%20Comp.%20Laws%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%20600.6304\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   However, Harris also attributed fault to Plaintiff.\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-296\">\n   Mr. Guinn drove the trailer to the Hemlock hydrogen tanks without incident.

He also pressurized the hydrogen tanker up to above 130 psi, utilizing the pressure builder. He indicated that he was filling normally for about 8 minutes and the meter showed 300 - 400. (Thus, the tanker was not overfilled). Then, the trailer pressure started to rise. As he reached for the vent valve to relieve the pressure, he heard a loud click and the explosion occurred. Mr. Guinn's actions of increasing the trailer pressure and not quickly relieving the overpressure, was why the trailer had to release hydrogen. The trailer and pressure builder are apparently still operating fine without defect. The Hemlock hydrogen tank's pressure should have been reduced more, to 120 psi.

Plaintiff however, may not pick and choose those aspects of his experts' reports that support his case, but then reject those aspects that weaken his case. The same holds true for the expert reports of opposing counsel. He may not pick and choose aspects of Harris's report that allow him to recover from Fike, but then reject those aspects that attribute fault to him. To do so would undermine the fundamental purpose of expert witnesses as individuals whose purpose is to provide guidance on technical and scientific matters.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-302\">\n   Plaintiff has not demonstrated that a genuine issue of material fact concerning Fike's alleged breach of duty. He cannot rest his entire argument on the expert report of opposing counsel that contradicts the conclusions of his own experts.

As explained above, Plaintiff's First Amended Complaint presents a simple count of negligence against Praxair with a plethora of different theories of the Defendant's breach of duty. ECF No. 27 at 5-6. Under Michigan law, a prima facie case of negligence contains four elements: \"(1) that the defendant owed a duty to the plaintiff; (2) that the defendant breached that duty; (3) that the defendant's breach of duty was a proximate cause of the plaintiff's damages; and (4) that the plaintiff suffered damages.\"\n   <em>\n    Baker v.

Ct. App. 1996).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-306\">\n   Praxair argues that Guinn cannot prove the second and third elements of his prima facie case, namely breach and causation. Each argument will be addressed in turn.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-307\">\n   <strong>\n    A.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-308\">\n   Praxair contends that Plaintiff cannot identify any specific evidence to support his allegations that Praxair breached its duties to Plaintiff. ECF No. 106 at 16. It argues that because Plaintiff's experts found that the Trailer's safety relief system functioned properly, Plaintiff has no evidence to support his allegations.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 17. It further argues that Plaintiff's experts have introduced new theories that fall beyond Plaintiff's First Amended Complaint and that if the Court were to consider these new theories, Praxair is still not liable.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 18-19. Plaintiff responds that typically, the question of whether a duty\n   has been breached is a question of fact reserved for the jury.\n   <footnotemark>\n    14\n   </footnotemark>\n   ECF No. 125 at 16.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-309\">\n   As explained above in the Court's decision to grant in part Plaintiff's motion for reconsideration of its order denying its motion to amend his complaint, all the allegations of the Second Amended Complaint (except those related to overfilling the Trailer and the signage at Hemlock) are subsumed by the unchallenged allegations within the First Amended Complaint. This includes Plaintiff's allegations related to the faulty vacuum, the Trailer's history of activated rupture discs, and the vent stack rain flap. Plaintiff has presented sufficient evidence to raise an issue of material fact regarding whether Praxair breached its duty to Plaintiff.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-310\">\n   Concerning the faulty vacuum, Plaintiff has presented evidence that the Trailer had internal and external cracks. Along with other factors, this allegedly made the vacuum faulty. As explained by Witte, a faulty vacuum attracts air and moisture and decreases the vacuum's effectiveness. According to Witte, Praxair should have stopped using the Trailer when it became apparent that the vacuum could not maintain an acceptable temperature. Additionally, according to Witte, the Trailer had a long history of activating rupture discs. Witte attributes this history to the Trailer's faulty vacuum. Praxair argues that such information is irrelevant because it is unknown under what circumstances the rupture discs activated. However, this argument does not refute Witte's conclusions nor does it resolve whether Praxair breached its duty of care by not taking the Trailer out of service or doing more to address the Trailer's allegedly dangerous condition.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-311\">\n   Furthermore, as established by Klein's testimony, there remains the issue of whether the Trailer's rain flap malfunctioned and if so, why. The Parties have presented photographs of the rain flap in different positions. In one photograph, allegedly the earliest photograph, the rain flap is closed, completely covering the vent stack. This supports the proposition that the rain flap functioned properly when the explosion occurred. When the hydrogen gas travelled up the vent stack, it came in contact with the rain flap and forced the flap into a completely vertical position. However, in another photograph, the rain flap is partially open, indicating that the flap malfunctioned. When the hydrogen gas travelled up the vent stack, it came in contact with the rain flap, but the flap did not rise to a completely vertical position as it was supposed to do. Instead, it only opened partially and prevented the hydrogen gas from escaping the vent stack vertically. This theory is also supported by the burn marks on the body of the Trailer, indicating that rain flap diverted the gas down to the body of the Trailer.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-312\">\n   Though Praxair's expert Eby disagrees with most of the assertions by Plaintiff and his experts, a motion for summary judgment is not the time to referee a \"battle of the experts.\"\n   <em>\n    Kalamazoo River Study Group v. Rockwell Intern. Corp.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11639514\" index=\"61\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/171/1065/#p1072\">\n    171 F.3d 1065\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 1072 (6th Cir. 1999) (explaining that \"credibility judgments, the weighing of evidence, and the drawing of legitimate inferences from the facts are jury functions, not those of the judge.\"). Plaintiff has presented sufficient evidence that Praxair breached its duty to Plaintiff\n   by failing to maintain the Trailer in a safe condition.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-313\">\n   <strong>\n    B.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-314\">\n   Praxair's second argument is that Plaintiff cannot rely upon Witte's testimony to establish causation. Praxair repeats the argument against Witte that it presented in its motion challenging Witte, namely that Witte's testimony refutes Plaintiff's testimony. As explained above, Witte's testimony will not be excluded solely because it contradicts Plaintiff's testimony. Plaintiff is taking a risk by offering testimony that corroborates his comparative negligence, but it is a risk Plaintiff is permitted to take.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-315\">\n   Accordingly, Praxair's motion for summary judgment will be denied.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-316\">\n   <strong>\n    VI.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-317\">\n   Fiba's motion for summary judgment will now be addressed. Like Praxair, Fiba argues that neither Plaintiff nor his experts can prove that Fiba breached its duty to Plaintiff nor that Fiba caused the explosion. It argues that \"Plaintiff turns to his experts to apply mistaken calculations to determine the vacuum readings on the day of the incident and examine a photograph taken after the incident occurred. ECF No. 108 at 17.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-318\">\n   Plaintiff and his experts have presented sufficient evidence to raise an issue of material fact regarding Fiba's potential breach of duty and causation. The evidence includes the vacuum's cracked condition and inability to consistently hold an appropriately low temperature, the history of burst disc activations, and the possible malfunction of the rain flap. Fiba had the responsibility to inspect and maintain the Trailer. A mere two months prior to the incident, Fiba inspected the Trailer and issued a certificate certifying that\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-319\">\n   This is to Certify that FIBA Technologies, Inc. hereby confirms that the product being supplied conforms to the specifications set forth by Purchase Order Number: 60011861, and referenced to FIBA Work Order Number: OH16534...If the product is a trailer, FIBA also certifies that the equipment has been manufactured in accordance with all requirements of the U.S. Federal Motor Vehicle Safety Standards, at the time of manufacture.\n   <footnotemark>\n    15\n   </footnotemark>\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-320\">\n   Fiba did not advise Praxair to remove the Trailer from use despite the vacuum's inability to consistently hold an appropriate temperature and history of burst discs activating. Fiba was the party that installed the new rain flap on the Trailer just two months prior to the incident that potentially malfunctioned. Both the photograph of the rain flap partially opened and the burn marks on the body of the Trailer seemingly support Plaintiff's allegations that the flap malfunctioned. Plaintiff and his experts have presented sufficient evidence of an issue of material fact. Accordingly, Fiba's motion for summary judgment will be denied.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-321\">\n   <strong>\n    VII.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-322\">\n   Accordingly, it is\n   <strong>\n    ORDERED\n   </strong>\n   that Plaintiff's motion for reconsideration of the Court's order denying Plaintiff's motion to amend his complaint, ECF No. 110, is\n   <strong>\n    GRANTED in part\n   </strong>\n   .

ECF No. 103.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"7\">\n   <p id=\"p-341\">\n    Throughout the course of this litigation, several different attorneys represented Plaintiff. The first complaint filed on May 4, 2017 listed Craig Hilborn and Kevin Riddle of Hilborn &amp; Hilborn P.C. and Barry Conybeare of Conybeare Law Office, P.C. ECF No. 1. Six months later, Hilborn &amp; Hilborn P.C. withdrew as counsel. ECF No. 22, 23. The next month, Debra Freid filed her appearance as co-counsel. ECF No. 24. On September 18, 2018, she withdrew. ECF No. 60. That same month, Thomas W. Waun and Vernon R. Johnson of Johnson Law, PLC appeared as co-counsel for Plaintiff. ECF No. 57, 59. Conybeare Law Office and Johnson Law are the two firms currently representing Plaintiff.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"8\">\n   <p id=\"p-342\">\n    In Rathgeber's deposition, he testified, \"it's the driver's responsibility before he gets on the road to make sure that the pressure in his trailer is - meets the DOT requirements to get on the road.\" ECF No. 63-4 at 36.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"9\">\n   <p id=\"p-343\">\n    Witte also apportioned fault to Chart Industries as the manufacturer of the Trailer. However, Chart Industries has been dismissed as a defendant so its potential fault will not be discussed.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"10\">\n   <p id=\"p-344\">\n    Praxair quotes Carpenter's deposition to support this argument. However, nowhere in Carpenter's deposition does he specify whether warm or cold vacuum readings were taken on the Trailer. He states that the micron reading on the Trailer was 450 microns, but he does not specify whether it is warm or cold. Carpenter Dep., Ex. 7, ECF No. 100-8. However, in his affidavit, Carpenter testifies that the readings are in warm microns. Carpenter Aff., Ex. E, ECF No. 111-5.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"11\">\n   <p id=\"p-345\">\n    Similar to Praxair, Fiba also argues that Klein's opinion should be excluded because he did not eliminate other potential ignition sources of the explosion, such as static electricity or friction.\n    <em>\n     Id.\n    </em>\n    at 9.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"12\">\n   <p id=\"p-346\">\n    M.C.R. 2.112(K) is a substantive rule and pursuant to\n    <em>\n     Erie\n    </em>\n    , it will be adopted here.

Hogan\n    </em>\n    the court found that\n   </p>\n   <blockquote id=\"p-347\">\n    the rule [M.C.R. 2.112(K) ] is a necessary component of Michigan's statutory scheme of \"fair share liability.\" The failure of this federal court to include the rule's notice provision as part and parcel of Michigan's substantive tort law would result in tort litigation differing materially depending on whether a suit was brought in state court or as a diversity action in federal court. Absent application of the rule, plaintiffs would have neither the benefit of the \"shield\" protecting them from the allocation of fault to a non-party without notice, nor the opportunity to amend the complaint to include those identified non-parties in a timely manner.\n   </blockquote>\n   <p id=\"p-348\">\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9040798\" index=\"62\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-2d/351/736/\">\n     351 F.Supp.2d 736\n    </extracted-citation>\n    at 739 (W.D.
