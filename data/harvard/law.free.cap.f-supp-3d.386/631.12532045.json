(Dkt. No. 23-1 at 1.) Named Plaintiff Ryan Sellers, with the conditionally certified class of ten opt-in plaintiffs, alleges that Defendants violated the minimum wage provisions of the Fair Labor Standards Act (\"FLSA\"),\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=29%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%20201\">\n    29 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 201\n   </extracted-citation>\n   <em>\n    et seq.\n   </em>\n   , by claiming a tip credit from the minimum hourly wage while also deducting from Plaintiffs' paychecks an amount equal to Defendants' lost revenue caused by bar shortages.

After the district court has conditionally certified the class, the potential class members have been identified and notified, and discovery has been completed, \"a defendant may then move to decertify the collective action, pointing to a more developed record to support its contention that the plaintiffs are not similarly situated to the extent that a collective action would be the appropriate vehicle for relief.\"\n   <em>\n    Pelczynski v.

Plaintiffs Are Not Situated in Disparate Factual or Employment Settings.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   \"The first factor of the decertification analysis involves an assessment of\n   whether Plaintiffs have provided evidence of a company-wide policy which may violate the FLSA, as well as an assessment of Plaintiffs' job duties, geographic location, supervision, and salary.\"\n   <em>\n    Regan v. City of Charleston\n   </em>\n   , 2:13-cv-3046-PMD,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"11\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2015%20WL%206727079\">\n    2015 WL 6727079\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *4 (D.S.C. Nov. 3, 2015) (internal quotation marks omitted) (denying motion to decertify). It is undisputed that Defendants adhere to a corporate practice of deducting an amount equivalent to revenue lost from bar shortages from bartenders' paychecks. This practice is memorialized in the standardized Terms of Employment between Defendants and its bartenders. (Dkt. No. 41-5 at 2.) \"Plaintiffs are similarly situated if they were victims of a common policy or plan that violated the law.\"\n   <em>\n    MacGregor v. Farmers Ins. Exchange\n   </em>\n   , No. 2:10-cv-03088-DCN,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"12\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2011%20WL%202981466\">\n    2011 WL 2981466\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *2 (D.S.C. July 22, 2011). Moreover, as Defendants describe, \"[t]he named Plaintiff and other opt-in bartenders employed by Defendants had similar job duties as bartenders, as spelled out in the policy manual and posted duties sheets.\" (Dkt. No. 45 at 4.) As evidenced by this uniform policy deducting bar shortages from bartenders' paychecks-the \"common thread\" among Plaintiffs' claims-the Court finds that Plaintiffs have demonstrated that their factual and employment settings are sufficiently uniform to warrant certification.\n   <em>\n    Regan\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"13\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2015%20WL%206727079\">\n    2015 WL 6727079\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *4.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   <strong>\n    B. Defendants' Defenses Are Not Sufficiently Individualized to Each Plaintiff.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   Defendants contend that they would advance individualized defenses against each Plaintiff because Ryan Sellers did not accurately report her income to the Internal Revenue Service and, therefore, she cannot demonstrate that Defendants' practice of claiming a tip credit while deducting bar shortages from paychecks lowered her income below the minimum wage. This argument is unavailing because the undisputed record evidence that Defendants both claim a tip credit and deduct bar shortages from bartenders' paychecks indicates a FLSA violation,\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   <strong>\n    C. Fairness and Procedural Considerations Warrant Continued Certification.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   Defendants offer no argument as to any fairness or procedural consideration of certification, such as to contend that certification is unduly prejudicial or judicially inefficient. \"The Court has broad discretion in determining whether the case should continue as a collective action after discovery.\"\n   <em>\n    Randolph v. PowerComm Constr., Inc.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4350619\" index=\"14\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/frd/309/349/#p368\">\n    309 F.R.D. 349\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 368 (D. Md. 2015). Having considered this case's procedural posture and the record facts, the Court finds that certification is fair in the circumstances present here.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   Each of these factors indicates that Plaintiffs are sufficiently similar with respect to the legal issues to be determined and, as a result, that decertification is not warranted.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   <strong>\n    IV.\n    <em>\n     Conclusion\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   For the foregoing reasons, Defendants' motion to decertify the conditionally certified class (Dkt. No. 49) is\n   <strong>\n    DENIED.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   <strong>\n    AND IT IS SO ORDERED.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n </opinion>\n</casebody>\n"
