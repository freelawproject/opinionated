At issue are defendant's motions (i) to dismiss for lack of subject matter jurisdiction and (ii) to dismiss for failure to state a claim. Because the DHS officials' conduct that plaintiff challenges in this case falls within the discretionary function exception of the Federal Tort Claims Act (\"FTCA\"),\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   this action must be dismissed for lack of subject matter jurisdiction.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   <strong>\n    I.\n   </strong>\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   Plaintiff was born in El Salvador on January 20, 1978. According to the Complaint, plaintiff first entered the United States at age two or three and was granted lawful permanent residence in the United States on or about September 1, 1987. Plaintiff's parents divorced in 1983, but the divorce decree did not address or decide which parent would have legal or physical custody of plaintiff. On June 8, 1995, plaintiff's father became a naturalized citizen of the United States. At the time of his father's naturalization, plaintiff was seventeen years old and was residing with his father in Washington, D.C. Plaintiff's father had actual, uncontested custody of plaintiff at the time of plaintiff's father's naturalization. Accordingly, by operation of then-applicable Immigration and Nationality\n   Act \u00a7 321(a),\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   plaintiff automatically derived United States citizenship on June 8, 1995 by virtue of his father's naturalization.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   Yet, plaintiff did not receive a certificate of citizenship or any other proof of his citizenship at that time.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   In February 2004, plaintiff left the United States to visit El Salvador. When plaintiff returned to the United States on February 28, 2004 via John F. Kennedy International Airport in New York City, plaintiff was questioned about his immigration status by a United States Customs and Border Protection (\"CBP\") officer. Plaintiff told the CBP officer that he was a lawful permanent resident, that he lived with his father in Washington, DC, and that his father was a U.S. citizen. Plaintiff also asked the CBP officer to investigate whether plaintiff was a United States citizen. CBP allowed plaintiff to enter the United States but directed him to report to CBP at Dulles International Airport because it appeared that plaintiff had been convicted of four criminal offenses, including two controlled substance offenses. Plaintiff subsequently reported to CBP at Dulles International Airport.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   On April 26, 2004, CBP officers began investigating whether plaintiff possessed derivative United States citizenship from his father's naturalization as a United States citizen. In the course of the investigation, CBP had in its possession information reflecting that at the time of his father's naturalization, (i) plaintiff was a minor, (ii) plaintiff resided with his father, and (iii) plaintiff's parents had agreed that plaintiff would reside with his father. Nonetheless, CBP and DHS officials determined that plaintiff was not a derivative citizen of the United States.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   During a check-in with CBP on or about August 12, 2004, CBP told plaintiff he was not a United States citizen and detained him in an immigration detention center in Virginia. Immigration officials searched plaintiff multiple times while he was detained. Thereafter, United States Immigration and Customs Enforcement (\"ICE\") served plaintiff with a Notice to Appear (\"NTA\"), which commenced removal proceedings against plaintiff in Immigration Court in Arlington, Virginia. The NTA informed plaintiff that ICE alleged (i) that plaintiff was not a citizen of the United States, (ii) that plaintiff was convicted of four criminal offenses, including two controlled substance offenses, (iii) and that plaintiff was subject to removal under\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=8%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201182\">\n    8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1182\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a)(2)(A)(i)(II) (controlled substance offenses), (a)(2)(C) (illicit trafficker in any controlled substance), and (a)(2)(A)(i)(I) (crimes involving moral turpitude). Plaintiff remained detained, but was represented by counsel during his removal proceedings.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   During his removal proceedings, plaintiff, by counsel, conceded that he was not a United States citizen, despite the fact that he was provided a full opportunity to argue\n   that he had previously obtained derivative United States citizenship. Based on plaintiff's admission, the Immigration Court held that plaintiff was subject to removal pursuant to the charges in the NTA. Plaintiff was ordered removed on September 29, 2004, and plaintiff did not notice an appeal of that order. Immigration officials executed the removal order and removed Plaintiff to El Salvador on or about December 6, 2004.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   Plaintiff subsequently returned to the United States in or around 2005. Then, on or about November 20, 2015, ICE officers took plaintiff into custody and detained him at a detention center in Virginia after plaintiff's prior removal order was reinstated pursuant to\n   <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=8%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201231\">\n    8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1231\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a)(5). Plaintiff retained new counsel, who presented plaintiff's claim of derivative citizenship based on his father's naturalization to ICE on April 4, 2016. That same day, ICE released plaintiff from physical custody through an Order of Supervision. Plaintiff, by his new counsel, subsequently persuaded federal officials of his derivative citizenship. Plaintiff was thus issued a United States passport and a certificate of United States citizenship, and his 2004 removal proceedings were terminated.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   Based on these facts, plaintiff claims that the United States is liable pursuant to the FTCA for the following torts under Virginia law: assault, battery, false arrest, intentional infliction of emotional distress, negligence, and negligent infliction of emotional distress. In essence, these claims allege that DHS officials erroneously determined in 2004 that plaintiff had not become a derivative citizen when his father was naturalized and that, as a result, DHS officials unlawfully arrested, detained, and removed plaintiff in 2004 and again unlawfully arrested and detained plaintiff in 2015 and 2016.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   <strong>\n    II.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   In its motion to dismiss for lack of subject matter jurisdiction, defendant argues that subject matter jurisdiction over plaintiff's claims is lacking pursuant to the discretionary function exception to the FTCA's waiver of sovereign immunity.\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   As the Supreme Court has explained, \"[a]bsent a waiver, sovereign immunity shields the Federal Government and its agencies from suit.\"\n   <em>\n    F.D.I.C. v.

Yet importantly, the FTCA's waiver is limited by several exceptions, which, if applicable, preserve the United States' sovereign immunity from suit and deprive the district court of subject matter jurisdiction over the plaintiff's claims against the United States.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Medina v.

A review of the Complaint reflects that plaintiff alleges that DHS officials negligently and erroneously determined in 2004 that plaintiff was ineligible for derivative citizenship and that this determination led to plaintiff's arrest, detention, and removal to El Salvador in 2004 and his arrest and detention during 2015 and 2016.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Compl. \u00b6 43 (\"DHS arrested, detained, and deported [plaintiff] based on a misunderstanding of citizenship law in 2004.\");\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 49 (\"DHS acted recklessly when the agency incorrectly determined that [plaintiff] was not a U.S. citizen, which subsequently led to his arrest, detention, and deportation to El Salvador.\");\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 52 (\"DHS breached its duty [to allow U.S. citizens like plaintiff to enter the United States freely] which was the cause in fact and proximate cause of [plaintiff's] arrests, detention, and deportation.\");\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 54 (\"DHS acted negligently when the agency incorrectly determined that [plaintiff] was not a U.S. citizen, which subsequently led to his arrest, detention, and deportation to El Salvador.\"). Thus, plaintiff's various tort claims, distilled to their essence, challenge DHS officials' determination in 2004 that plaintiff was ineligible for derivative United States citizenship and DHS's decision to detain and deport plaintiff based on that determination.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   There is no doubt that the first requirement for application of the FTCA's discretionary exception function-\n   <em>\n    i.e.\n   </em>\n   that the conduct at issue involves an element of judgment or choice-is met here. The government conduct that plaintiff challenges here clearly involved the exercise of judgment and discretion by DHS officials.

First, as courts have sensibly concluded, in the context of applying the discretionary function exception, \"the arrest, detention, and deportation of [a suspected alien] cannot be separated from the agents' investigation\" of the suspected alien's citizenship status.\n   <em>\n    Arteaga-Ruiz v.

The plaintiff in\n   <em>\n    Arteaga-Ruiz\n   </em>\n   , like plaintiff here, conceded in his removal proceeding that he was not a United States citizen and agreed that he was removable.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 1199-1200. Then, after the plaintiff in\n   <em>\n    Arteaga-Ruiz\n   </em>\n   returned to the United States in 2010, he was advised by an immigration attorney that the plaintiff possessed derivative United States citizenship as of 2001.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 1200. The\n   <em>\n    Arteaga-Ruiz\n   </em>\n   plaintiff thereafter initiated an action against the United States, including claims of negligence, false imprisonment, and intentional infliction of emotional distress, each of which was based on the plaintiff's arrest, detention, and removal in 2007.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   The district court first concluded that the\n   <em>\n    Arteaga-Ruiz\n   </em>\n   plaintiff's claims, which mirror the claims brought by plaintiff in the instant case, \"all stem from ICE's allegedly negligent investigative activity concerning his immigration status, which led to his week-long detention and removal.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 1202-03. According to the district court, this challenged government conduct met the first requirement of the discretionary function exception because \"the ICE agents' conduct during their investigation of [the plaintiff]'s immigration status, the conclusions drawn from their investigation, and the decision to remove him, are generally considered discretionary conduct.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 1203. The district court also held that this conduct met the second requirement of the discretionary function analysis because \"[t]he ICE agents' discretionary conduct in investigating [the plaintiff]'s immigration status, analyzing the information received, and in deciding whether to issue an NTA charging [the plaintiff] were susceptible to policy analysis.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 1204. Accordingly, the district court held that the\n   <em>\n    Arteaga-Ruiz\n   </em>\n   plaintiffs \"negligence, false imprisonment, and intentional infliction of emotional distress claims are barred by the discretionary function exception to the FTCA's waiver of sovereign immunity.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   On appeal, the Ninth Circuit affirmed the district court's dismissal of the\n   <em>\n    Arteaga-Ruiz\n   </em>\n   plaintiff's tort claims. Specifically, the Ninth Circuit held (i) that the plaintiff's claims \"turn on whether federal immigration agents negligently or wrongfully failed to discover that [the plaintiff] was a U.S. citizen before he was removed in 2007,\" and (ii) that these \"claims are barred by the discretionary function exception because the manner in which the agents investigated [the plaintiff]'s eligibility for removal meets both\" requirements of the discretionary function exception.\n   <em>\n    Arteaga-Ruiz\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12406900\" index=\"49\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-appx/705/597/#p598\">\n    705 F.

Importantly, the Ninth Circuit also rejected the\n   <em>\n    Arteaga-Ruiz\n   </em>\n   plaintiff's argument that \"the agents could not have been acting with discretion because they lacked the authority to arrest, detain, and deport a U.S. citizen\" because, according to the Ninth Circuit, \"the arrest, detention, and deportation of [the plaintiff] cannot be separated from the agents' investigation and their reliance on his admission of non-citizenship.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12406900\" index=\"50\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-appx/705/597/#p598\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   In light of the close factual similarity between\n   <em>\n    Arteaga-Ruiz\n   </em>\n   and the instant case, the Ninth Circuit's reasoning in\n   <em>\n    Arteaga-Ruiz\n   </em>\n   is particularly instructive and thus provides further support for the conclusion reached here, namely that the discretionary function exception to the FTCA applies to DHS officials' determination in 2004 that plaintiff was ineligible for derivative United States citizenship and DHS's decision to detain and deport plaintiff based on that determination.\n   <footnotemark>\n    8\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   An appropriate order will issue.\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-36\">\n    <extracted-citation index=\"51\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%202671\">\n     28 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 2671\n    </extracted-citation>\n    <em>\n     et seq.\n    </em>\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"2\">\n   <p id=\"p-37\">\n    The Fourth Circuit has explained that when the defendant challenges the factual basis for subject matter jurisdiction, \"the district court is to regard the pleadings' allegations as mere evidence on the issue, and may consider evidence outside the pleadings without converting the proceeding to one for summary judgment.\"\n    <em>\n     Richmond, Fredericksburg &amp; Potomac R.
