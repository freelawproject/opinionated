DAVILA, United States District Judge\n  </author>\n  <p id=\"p-8\">\n   This putative class action against Apple Inc. (\"Apple\") is brought by Plaintiffs from across the U.S. as well as multiple foreign countries. Presently before the Court are several pending motions.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   In its order granting in part and denying in part Apple's motion to dismiss the Consolidated Amended Complaint (CAC), the Court denied Apple's motion with respect to the non-U.S. Plaintiffs. Apple now asks the Court to reconsider its ruling on that issue. Dkt. No. 236-1. The Court will GRANT Apple's motion for reconsideration.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   Apple moves to dismiss claims in the Second Amended Complaint (\"SAC\"). Dkt. No. 272 (\"MTD\"). The Court GRANTS in part and DENIES in part Apple's motion to dismiss.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   Along with their Opposition to Apple's motion to dismiss, Plaintiffs separately filed \"Objections\" to Apple's motion. Dkt. No. 282. Plaintiffs \"request[ed] leave to file these objections as a separate document\" because of \"the seriousness of Plaintiffs' objections and the large number of irregularities in the MTD.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 1. Plaintiffs' request is procedurally inappropriate.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Civ. L.R. 7-3(a) (\"Any evidentiary and procedural objections to the motion must be contained within the brief or memorandum.\"). Plaintiffs' offer no compelling explanation for their attempt to circumvent the page limits that this Court set for briefing on the motion to dismiss. Accordingly, Plaintiffs' request is DENIED, and the Court will not consider this document. Plaintiffs shall not submit any billing requests related to production of this extraneous document.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   In addition, Plaintiffs' Opposition is accompanied by the Declaration of Joseph Cotchett, which includes as exhibits additional documents produced by Apple in discovery or allegedly downloaded from the Internet Archives as copies of Apple's own webpages. Dkt. No. 280-1. These documents are not properly before the Court as part of the motion to dismiss, so the Court does consider them.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Branch v.

Dkt. Nos. 177, 281. The Court GRANTS Apple's request to take judicial notice of the hardware warranty. Dkt. No. 177. The Court DENIES Plaintiffs' request to take judicial notice of documents produced during discovery. Dkt. No. 281.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   Finally, the parties have each filed administrative motions for leave to file statements of recent decision. Dkt. Nos. 307, 308. These administrative motions are improper under Civil Local Rules 7-3(d)(2) and 7-11. The Court DENIES these administrative motions.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   <strong>\n    I. BACKGROUND\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   In its order granting in part and denying in part the motion to dismiss, the Court discussed the background facts in detail. Dkt. No. 219. The Court will not repeat that discussion here and assumes familiarity with it. At a high level, this case involves allegations that Apple attempted to conceal iPhone battery defects and that Apple failed to adequately disclose that certain software updates would affect device performance.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   On July 2, 2018, Plaintiffs filed the CAC, asserting 76 causes of action under one federal statute, all 50 states' statutes, and the common law, on behalf of a class including consumers from the 50 states and other territories of the United States as well as multiple foreign countries. Dkt. No. 145. After considering the parties' proposals for proceeding with a motion to dismiss a limited set of claims, the Court ordered that Apple's motion to dismiss the CAC\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   would be limited to counts one through six of the CAC and the threshold issues of whether Plaintiffs could assert claims on behalf of non-U.S. residents and whether Plaintiffs' claims extended to certain iPad devices.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Dkt. No. 163 at 1. On August 9, 2018, Apple filed its motion to dismiss the CAC. Dkt. No. 176. On October 1, 2018, the Court granted in part and denied in part Apple's motion to dismiss the CAC. Dkt. No. 219 (\"Order\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   With respect to the Foreign plaintiffs, the Court noted that \"[m]any of the [practical and constitutional] concerns that Apple raises are substantial and potentially well-founded;\" however, the Court explained that \"[t]he issues identified by Apple are better addressed at a later stage of the proceedings, such as class certification.\" Dkt. No. 219 at 8. Except with respect to claims under the California False Advertising Law, the Court concluded that non-U.S. Plaintiffs could invoke California law.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 13. The Court also determined that the Computer Fraud and Abuse Act applied extraterritorially, and denied Apple's request to dismiss the U.K. Plaintiffs' claims under the doctrine of international comity or forum non conveniens.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 15, 17.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   On November 15, 2018, Apple filed a motion for leave to file a motion for reconsideration of the Court's Order and motion for reconsideration. Dkt. No. 236 (\"Mot. for Reconsideration\"). Apple's motion is limited to the Court's choice-of-law conclusion that foreign Plaintiffs may invoke California law. On December 4, 2018, the Court granted Apple's motion for leave to file a motion for reconsideration. Dkt. No. 246. The Court deemed filed the attached motion for reconsideration and invited responsive briefing.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 2. Plaintiffs filed an opposition, Dkt. No. 266 (\"Opp. re Reconsideration\"), and Apple filed a Reply to MTD, Dkt. No. 269 (\"Reply re Reconsideration\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   Apple filed the instant motion to dismiss on January 24, 2019. Dkt. 272. Plaintiffs opposed the motion to dismiss, requested the court take judicial notice of various documents, and sought leave to file additional objections to the motion to dismiss. Dkt. Nos. 280 (\"Opp. To MTD\"), 281, 282. Apple filed a reply. Dkt. No. 286. The Court heard oral argument from the parties on March 7, 2019. Dkt. No. 302.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   <strong>\n    II. LEGAL STANDARDS\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   Motions for reconsideration are disfavored and \"should not be granted, absent highly unusual circumstances, unless the district court is presented with newly discovered evidence, committed\n   <em>\n    clear error\n   </em>\n   , or if there is an intervening change in the controlling law.\"\n   <em>\n    McDowell v.

The Court might properly consider these documents under the theory of judicial notice or the theory of incorporation by reference. Although the parties make arguments under both theories, they fail to distinguish between them.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   Federal Rule of Evidence 201 \"permits a court to notice an adjudicative fact if it 'not subject to reasonable dispute.'

However, Plaintiffs do not actually dispute the only fact that Apple seeks to rely on: the fact that the hardware warranty selects the law of the country of purchase. Thus, Plaintiffs argument against judicial notice is unpersuasive.\n   <em>\n    Cf.\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Khoja\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12518146\" index=\"31\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/899/988/#p998\">\n    899 F.3d at 1001-02\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (judicial notice was proper when the court only took notice of an undisputed filing date on an application). Plaintiffs also argue that judicial notice is improper because Plaintiffs do not state any warranty claims, and therefore the hardware warranty is not relevant. Dkt. No. 192 at 4-5. As discussed further below with respect to Apple's motion for reconsideration, the Court finds that Plaintiffs' battery defect claims arise under the hardware warranty. Accordingly, Plaintiffs' argument against judicial notice on this basis is unpersuasive. Finally, the case relied upon by Plaintiffs for the proposition that courts have declined to take notice of Apple's hardware warranty is distinguishable because in that case, the plaintiffs only alleged that their devices' software did not function as advertised.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    In re: iPhone 4S Consumer Litig.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"32\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2013%20WL%203829653\">\n    2013 WL 3829653\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , *7 (N.D.

MOTION FOR RECONSIDERATION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   Apple argues that the Court should reconsider its ruling denying Apple's motion to dismiss the non-U.S. Plaintiffs' claims for three reasons: (1) the Court failed to consider the entirety of the both the hardware warranty and the Software License Agreement (\"SLA\"), which demonstrate that the hardware warranty's choice of the law of the country of purchase should apply; (2) even if the SLA applies, the Court failed to consider whether California law was \"contrary to a fundamental policy\" of foreign jurisdictions that have a \"materially greater interest\" in having their law applied; and (3) if it was unclear whether the SLA or hardware warranty applied, under general California choice-of-law principles, California law should not apply. Mot. for Reconsideration at 7. Except as noted below with respect to the additional foreign law expert declarations that Apple submitted with its motion, all of Apple's arguments assert a manifest failure by the Court to consider material facts or dispositive legal arguments. In order to successfully argue for reconsideration on this basis, Apple must show that the arguments \"were presented to the Court before such interlocutory order.\" Civ. L.R. 7-9(b)(3).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   In its previous Order, the Court granted with leave to amend Apple's motion to dismiss the FAL claims of non-U.S. Plaintiffs.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   Order at 17.

Order at 9. The Court reasoned that Plaintiffs' causes of action arise from or relate to the SLA, and that \"[t]he language of the choice-of-law clause at issue in\n   <em>\n    Nedlloyd\n   </em>\n   is indistinguishable from the language\" of the choice-of-law clause in the SLA.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 10-11. In addition, the Court concluded that the hardware warranty \"explicitly exempts 'consumable parts, such as batteries' from its coverage.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 12. Accordingly, the Court concluded that the SLA's choice of California law applied to all of Plaintiffs' claims.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   Apple argues that there was a manifest failure by the Court to consider material facts showing that (1) Plaintiffs' claims fell within the scope of the hardware warranty rather than the SLA, and (2) the SLA did not indicate that California law would govern all aspects of Apple's relationship with its customers. Mot. for Reconsideration at 8.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   <strong>\n    B. Whether Plaintiffs' Claims Fall Within the Scope of the SLA\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   Apple argues that \"Plaintiffs' core theory ... is based on an alleged problem with their devices'\n   <em>\n    hardware\n   </em>\n   ,\" and that \"their Apple devices' software clearly plays a secondary role in their theory of liability.\" Mot. for Reconsideration at 11. Apple argues that this is not a license dispute, and the SLA does not give rise to any of Plaintiffs' causes of action.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 12. In addition, Apple challenges the Court's previous conclusion that the hardware warranty does not apply to batteries. Apple argues that the Court failed to consider the full relevant provision which states that the warranty does not apply \"to consumable parts, such as batteries ...\n   <em>\n    unless failure has occurred due to a defect in materials or workmanship.\n   </em>\n   \" Dkt. No. 177-1 Ex. A (emphasis added). Thus, Apple argues, the hardware warranty governs all battery issues and specifies that only defects to design or workmanship entitle the customer to the remedy of a free replacement battery. Mot. for Reconsideration at 13.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   Apple's argument is persuasive. Specifically, the Court agrees that there was a manifest failure in its earlier order to consider the entirety of the hardware warranty. Properly construed, the hardware warranty appears to apply to all battery issues, and the express limitations appear to be with respect to Apple's liability rather than with respect to the coverage of the warranty. Plaintiffs offer no persuasive argument to the contrary. In addition, the Court failed to consider whether some of Plaintiffs' causes of action were primarily about their devices' hardware. On reconsideration, the Court concludes that Plaintiffs' battery defect claims are based on a problem with their devices' hardware and thus arise under the hardware warranty. As discussed below with respect to Apple's motion to dismiss the SAC, the Court will grant Apple's motion to dismiss Plaintiffs' battery defect claims.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   The surviving claims relate to Plaintiffs' theory that Apple failed to adequately disclose the function of the iOS updates. These claims directly arise from the scope of the authorization in the SLA and are thus governed by the SLA's choice of law provision. The Court notes that in its motion to dismiss the second amended\n   complaint, Apple cites approvingly an opinion dismissing a breach of implicit contract claim related to an iOS update because the SLA \"is an express contract that governs the same subject matter.\" MTD at 25-26 (citing\n   <em>\n    Wofford v. Apple Inc.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"41\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2011%20WL%205445054\">\n    2011 WL 5445054\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *2, *4 (S.D. Cal. Nov. 9, 2011) ). Apple cannot have it both ways. If the SLA defeats Plaintiffs' claims of implicit contract related to iOS updates, the SLA is also applicable to Plaintiffs' computer intrusion claims arising from the same iOS updates. Because the Court concludes that the only surviving claims relate to the SLA, the Court need not reach Plaintiffs' argument that the hardware warranty is not a contract.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   <strong>\n    C.

Under those circumstances, the court interpreted the choice-of-law provision broadly based on the parties' intent to have a single jurisdiction's law govern all causes of action arising out of the agreement.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   Apple attempts to distinguish the SLA from the contract at issue in\n   <em>\n    Nedlloyd\n   </em>\n   on two grounds: (1) Apple's relationship with its customers is governed by the SLA\n   <em>\n    and\n   </em>\n   the hardware warranty, which have their own separate choice-of-law provisions; and (2) the SLA contains at least seven provisions that expressly recognize local law. Mot. for Reconsideration at 10.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   As an initial matter, Apple failed entirely to raise these arguments in its briefing on the motion to dismiss the CAC. Because Apple could have raised these arguments, this Court need not consider them on a motion for reconsideration.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Marlyn Nutraceuticals\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5870916\" index=\"47\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/571/873/#p880\">\n    571 F.3d at 880\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (\"A motion for reconsideration may\n   <em>\n    not\n   </em>\n   be used to raise arguments or present evidence for the first time when they could reasonably have been raised earlier in the litigation.\" (internal quotation and citation omitted)). Even proceeding to consider the arguments, they are not persuasive. As to Apple's first argument, the Court acknowledges that the parties' relationship in\n   <em>\n    Nedlloyd\n   </em>\n   was governed entirely by a single contract, whereas the SLA only governs Apple's relationship with its customers as to their use of the software. But this is a distinction without a meaning. As the Court has already explained, Plaintiffs' computer intrusion claims arise from or relate to the SLA. Thus, the fact that the SLA might not govern other aspects of Apple's relationship with Plaintiffs is irrelevant. As to Apple's second argument, Sections 2(f) and 5(j) of the SLA require customers to use iOS software in accordance with local law. Dkt. No. 145 Ex. 5. Sections 7.1, 7.6, and 8 advise customers that local law may prohibit the application of the SLA's limitations on warranties and damages.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5870916\" index=\"48\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/571/873/#p880\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   Section 10 notes that the customer's right to export is controlled by U.S. law and the laws of the jurisdiction where the iOS software was obtained.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5870916\" index=\"49\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/571/873/#p880\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   And Section 13 provides that the English version of the SLA controls, unless prohibited by local law.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5870916\" index=\"50\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/571/873/#p880\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   Contrary to Apple's characterization of these provisions, nothing\n   indicates that they were intended to alter the SLA's selection of California law.

Specifically, the Court explained that \"Plaintiffs' theory appears to be that Apple was duty-bound to disclose that their batteries will eventually need replacement because increasing software capability puts more demands on hardware and battery capacity degrades over time.... [However, a]s Plaintiffs' own allegations demonstrate, consumers are fully aware of the facts regarding software capability and battery capacity.\" Order at 33. Moreover, the Court concluded that Apple's hardware warranty, which only lasts for one year, makes clear that \"consumers cannot realistically expect their batteries to last for the lifetime of their devices.\" Order at 34. The Court acknowledged that materiality is typically a question of fact, but concluded that Plaintiffs' own allegations in the CAC showed that consumers were fully aware of the alleged defect. Order at 33.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-99\">\n   Apple argues that the Court should dismiss Plaintiffs' omissions theory because the underlying defect theory is essentially unchanged. Mot at 14. Apple argues that the only alleged defect is that Plaintiffs' devices did not function as well or as long as Plaintiffs would prefer, which does not create a material omission to trigger Apple's duty to disclose. Reply to MTD at 8-9. Plaintiffs argue that they \"do not complain about batteries that age as designed by Apple or [argue] that [batteries] should last forever.\" Opp. to MTD at 12. Instead, Plaintiffs argue that the alleged defect is that batteries age prematurely and are susceptible to UPOs.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"115\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=207%20P.3d%2020\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   At the hearing, Plaintiffs stressed that the SAC includes additional allegations regarding Apple's knowledge of and response to the occurrence of UPOs. Hr'g Tr. at 19:10-20:18.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-100\">\n   In the CAC, Plaintiffs defined the defect as the \"mismatch between the Devices' hardware, including their processing chips and rechargeable lithium-ion batteries, and the ever-increasing demands placed on the Devices via Apple's constantly-updating iOS software platform.\" CAC \u00b6 9. In the SAC, Plaintiffs now state that \"[t]he nature of the Defect was that Apple had designed its Devices in such a way that the power-hungry software strained the Devices battery thereby causing it to prematurely age -\n   <em>\n    i.e.\n   </em>\n   , rapidly develop very high resistance levels - and significantly increased susceptibility to a [UPO].\" SAC \u00b6 370;\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 4 (\"Apple's power-hungry operating software ... and its applications strained the battery powering the Device, thereby causing the battery to age and degrade prematurely\"). Plaintiffs allege that \"[a] battery and processor must be designed such that even as the battery ages and loses performance, it will still be capable of meeting the processor's peak power demands for years to come.\" SAC \u00b6 423.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-101\">\n   The core problem with the CAC, as identified in this Court's previous Order, was that it essentially labeled as a defect the typical aging process of a lithium-ion battery-an aging process which the CAC itself recognized that consumers were aware of. The Court agrees with Apple that Plaintiffs' theory of the defect is materially unchanged from the CAC, and that this core problem continues to infect the\n   SAC. The SAC itself explains that the alleged defect is part of the typical aging process of a lithium-ion battery. Specifically, the SAC explains that as a battery chemically ages, its ability to deliver maximum power decreases due to an increase in internal resistance. SAC \u00b6 378. A UPO occurs when a Device is unable to manage the maximum power demands placed on it.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 379. Plaintiffs explain that \"the shutdown is intentional from the device perspective, [but] it is unexpected by the user.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Moreover, the SAC alleges that \"[t]he speed for which Apple's products are known and marketed to consumers comes from powerful processing units which are supposed to perform calculations and render graphics on its smart-phones at top speeds.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 421. Plaintiffs allege that consumers purchase Apple's devices because of these processors; however, \"[a]s these processing units become faster and more powerful ... [they] require more power from the phone's battery.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Thus, the SAC lays out the defect as the result of the normal battery aging process, and in part as a result of the power-hungry features that the SAC alleges consumers value in Apple products in the first place.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-102\">\n   The Court is not persuaded that Plaintiffs have alleged anything that is different from normal aging of the battery. Plaintiffs direct the Court's attention to their specific allegations regarding allegedly premature UPOs. For example, the SAC alleges that [Redacted]. SAC \u00b6\u00b6 387-88. The SAC alleges that Apple was aware of complaints from users whose Apple devices experienced UPOs despite showing battery levels of 50-60%, and that internal email communications between Apple engineers show that [Redacted]. SAC \u00b6\u00b6 383, 390. In their briefing, Plaintiffs state that the batteries age \"twice as fast.\" Opp. to MTD at 12. At the hearing, Plaintiffs argued [Redacted] Hr'g Tr. 36:2-11, 37:8-9.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-103\">\n   Taking these allegations as true, as the Court must at this stage, Plaintiffs allege that [Redacted]. Plaintiffs do not allege that all, or even most, iPhones experienced UPOs at such a low charge cycle. Quite the contrary. They allege that most UPOs occurred on devices with fewer than 500 charge cycles. Moreover, as previously discussed, Plaintiffs make no allegations regarding whether they ever experienced UPOs on their own devices. These allegations say nothing about whether the batteries were still within the one-year hardware warranty when they experienced UPOs. As the Court explained in its previous Order, that warranty makes clear that consumers cannot expect batteries to last for the lifetime of their devices. Order at 34. Beyond their conclusory allegation that the batteries aged prematurely, Plaintiffs do not allege facts showing that the batteries malfunctioned or suffered from any design or manufacturing defect or were otherwise not as expected when produced. Plaintiffs do not allege that there was any fundamental flaw in the batteries themselves that caused UPOs. Rather, in Plaintiffs' own words, \"the power-hungry software strained the Devices battery.\" This amounts to an allegation that the devices functioned as expected, but that the batteries did not last as long as Plaintiffs believe that they should.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-104\">\n   Setting aside the failure of the SAC to plead anything more than the usual battery aging process, the Court finds that the defect is not material for another reason.

Additional Factors\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-108\">\n   As to the additional factors required under\n   <em>\n    Collins\n   </em>\n   , Plaintiffs do not allege that Apple was in a fiduciary relationship with Plaintiffs. In its previous order, the Court concluded that Plaintiffs failed to adequately plead that Apple had exclusive knowledge of material facts not known to Plaintiffs because \"common sense and Plaintiffs' own allegations demonstrate that consumers know about the degradation of batteries and the increasing capability of software.\" Order at 35. The Court finds that the SAC fails to correct this error. The Court acknowledges that the SAC adds several paragraphs regarding Apple's internal knowledge of and response to UPOs. SAC \u00b6\u00b6 369-409. The Court agrees with Plaintiffs insofar as they argue that these allegations show that Apple gathered substantial data on its batteries' performance that was not available to consumers. Plaintiffs cite two cases using language that the defendant had superior, rather than exclusive, knowledge. Opp. to MTD at 16. But even so, Plaintiffs had knowledge of the basic facts of battery degradation over time. These factual allegations are unlike allegedly defective laptop keyboards that unexpectedly and suddenly fail within a year of purchase.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    In re MacBook Keyboard Litig.\n   </em>\n   , Case No. 5:18-cv-02813-EJD,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"120\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2019%20WL%201765817\">\n    2019 WL 1765817\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (N.D. Cal. Apr. 22, 2019).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-109\">\n   The third and fourth circumstances that give rise to a duty are active concealment of a defect and making partial representations while also suppressing material facts. Plaintiffs argue that the SAC alleges \"active concealment\" based on Apple's use of iOS updates to throttle device performance. Opp. to MTD at 18-19. Plaintiffs argue that the SAC alleges partial misrepresentations based on Apple's statement that devices would retain 80% of their battery capacity at 500 charging cycles. Opp. to MTD at 19-21. The flaw in Plaintiffs' arguments is that, as discussed, Plaintiffs are aware of the basic function of batteries and their decay over time. Apple's own hardware warranty makes clear that consumers cannot reasonably expect their batteries to last forever. While the Court agrees that Plaintiffs allege secrecy around the function of the iOS updates, here, Plaintiffs attempt to shoehorn that secrecy into something that it is not: concealment of the basic fact that Apple's batteries would degrade over time.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-110\">\n   <strong>\n    d. Conclusion as to Omissions Theory\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-111\">\n   The SAC fails to fix the problem in Plaintiffs' omission theory. Most importantly, Plaintiffs theory of the defect defeats their own argument of materiality. Plaintiffs define the defect as the aging of the battery and the occurrence of UPOs due to power-hungry software and hardware. In other words, the alleged defect is the natural aging of the battery as a result\n   of use of the device. The failure of the battery to last as long as Plaintiffs would prefer does not constitute a material omission. In addition, Plaintiffs fail to plead any of the additional factors required: fiduciary relationship, exclusive knowledge, active concealment, or misleading partial representations. Because Plaintiffs' omissions theory is fundamentally flawed, the Court does not need to reach the parties' arguments regarding whether Plaintiffs adequately pleaded reliance.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-112\">\n   To the extent that the Court finds that Plaintiffs' theory is inadequate, Plaintiffs request leave to amend. Opp. to MTD at 22 n.26. At the hearing, Plaintiffs stated that they could amend to add additional details regarding the alleged defect based on the report that Plaintiffs' technical expert prepared. Hr'g. Tr. at 21:11-18.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-113\">\n   As an initial matter, the Court notes that it previously granted leave to amend with respect to this same theory. As discussed above, Plaintiffs' defect theory is essentially unchanged from the CAC. More fundamentally, the problem with Plaintiffs' request is that the defect in their pleading cannot be cured by merely adding more factual allegations. As explained above, Plaintiffs' theory is essentially that normal use of Apple devices leads to battery aging and UPOs, and that the batteries do not last for the life of the product. More factual allegations will not change the nature of the theory. Based on Plaintiffs' current allegations, it does not appear to the Court that they could allege a defect based on battery malfunctioning, poor design, or some other cause that did not result from normal wear and tear. Even if Plaintiffs could make such an allegation, the Court notes that such a theory would be inconsistent with the detailed allegations in both the CAC and the SAC. Because Plaintiffs would be held to the concessions in their current pleadings, the Court concludes that Plaintiffs would be unable to amend their complaint in any meaningful way such that they could plead an actionable omissions theory. Accordingly, the Court GRANTS without leave to amend Apple's motion to dismiss Plaintiffs' claims based on an omissions theory.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-114\">\n   <strong>\n    D. California Unfair Competition Law\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-115\">\n   In its previous Order, the Court denied Apple's motion to dismiss Plaintiffs' claims under the \"unlawful\" prong of the UCL, except with respect to the iPhone 5 and iPad models, because Plaintiffs' claim under the CDAFA could support the claim under the \"unlawful\" prong of the UCL. Order at 37. The Court denied Apple's motion to dismiss Plaintiffs' claims under the \"unfair\" prong of the UCL because Plaintiffs' only argument was that the \"unfair\" prong could not survive if the claims under the \"unlawful\" and \"fraudulent\" prongs do not survive. Order at 38.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-116\">\n   In a cursory section of the present motion to dismiss, Apple repeats these arguments. MTD at 20. As discussed below with respect to the computer intrusion claims, Plaintiffs' claims under the CDAFA survive. Accordingly, Plaintiffs' claims under the \"unlawful\" prong of the UCL also survive.

The crux of the Court's ruling on all of these claims was that Plaintiffs consented to install iOS updates, but Plaintiffs adequately alleged that the throttling of their devices' power supply constituted damage and that Plaintiffs did not and could not consent to this damage because Apple never disclosed the intended effects of the iOS updates.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-126\">\n   Apple now seeks to reargue these same issues.

In essence, Apple now argues that Plaintiffs cannot allege that they did not consent to any alleged damage done by the iOS updates when Plaintiffs also alleged that they consented to the installation of the updates. MTD at 22-23. In its previous Order addressing this precise issue, the Court concluded that \"even though Plaintiffs voluntarily installed the iOS updates, they never gave permission for Apple to cause damage to their iPhones.\" Order at 19-20.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    San Miguel v.

At heart, Apple does not raise an argument about the specificity of the pleadings, but rather attempts to reargue the legal question of whether Plaintiffs can state a claim for unauthorized damages when Plaintiffs consented to install the iOS updates. Applying Rule 9(b) does not change the Court's conclusion that Plaintiffs have adequately alleged that Apple concealed the throttling effect of the iOS updates, and that these allegations are sufficient at the pleading stage.

Moreover, as discussed above with respect to Plaintiffs' battery defect theory, Plaintiffs acknowledge that their phones functioned as expected when purchased. Plaintiffs concede that the \"defect\" is the normal aging of the battery. Plaintiffs rely heavily on Apple's statement that its batteries are \"designed to retain up to 80% of its original capacity at 500 complete charging cycles.\" SAC \u00b6 381.
