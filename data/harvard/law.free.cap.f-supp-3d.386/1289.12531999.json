The panel also noted that this court \"may determine in the first instance whether any of [plaintiffs'] claims are moot.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) Pursuant to the discussion with the parties at the status conference on remand, the court set a briefing schedule for the two motions at issue in this order: (1) defendants' motion to dismiss plaintiffs' claims for prospective relief as moot and (2) plaintiffs' motion to reopen discovery on the affirmative defense of good faith. (Docket No. 118.)

Defendants cited\n   <em>\n    Janus\n   </em>\n   as the justification for their change in policy, and the timing of the change indicates that the decision was a significant motivating force.

Indeed, defendants vigorously defended against this lawsuit and employed the opt-out procedure up until\n   <em>\n    Janus\n   </em>\n   .

Nothing in this statement, the letter from the State Controller's Office, or the affidavit submitted by the union's counsel is tentative. Second, the new practice fully addresses the challenged conduct. Because defendants no longer collect any fees absent an employee's affirmative consent, they no longer use the opt-out system at issue in this case. Third, as explained above, the\n   <em>\n    Janus\n   </em>\n   decision, not this litigation, catalyzed the change in policy.

City of Los Angeles\n    </em>\n    , No. SA 18-cv-360 JVS(ADSx) (C.D. Cal. June 5, 2019) (Docket No. 67). In\n    <em>\n     Guppy\n    </em>\n    , the defendants continued to automatically deduct agency fees from plaintiff's wages even after the Supreme Court's decision in\n    <em>\n     Janus\n    </em>\n    . (\n    <em>\n     Id.\n    </em>\n    at 3.) Only after the plaintiff brought a lawsuit did the defendants in\n    <em>\n     Guppy\n    </em>\n    stop these deductions. (\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    <em>\n     id.\n    </em>\n    at 4.) By contrast, defendants in this case immediately stopped collecting agency fees after\n    <em>\n     Janus\n    </em>\n    and readily acknowledged that the Supreme Court's decision now prohibits the challenged conduct.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"5\">\n   <p id=\"p-54\">\n    On May 25, 2015, plaintiffs served interrogatories and requests for production on the union. (\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    Decl. of Jeffrey Demain \u00b6 2 (Docket No. 129-1).) The union then objected to the discovery as untimely and plaintiffs took no action to compel further responses.
