Hershey contends that defendants have a duty to defend and indemnify it in a pending lawsuit in the District of Delaware (the \"Delaware Action\") and breached certain insurance policies by claiming they had no such duties. Hershey moves for partial summary judgment regarding its claims against Liberty Mutual. (Doc. 14). Defendants move for summary judgment as to their duty to defend and indemnify in the Delaware Action. (Doc. 17). We will grant in part and deny in part\n   Hershey's motion and deny defendants' motion in its entirety.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   <strong>\n    I.\n    <em>\n     Factual Background &amp; Procedural History\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   Hershey manufactures and sells ice cream and other frozen dessert products throughout the eastern United States. (Doc. 16 \u00b6 1). In 2014, f'real Foods, LLC (\"f'real\") filed suit against Hershey and several other defendants in the United States District Court for the District of Delaware.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   (Doc. 19 \u00b6 9). F'real's complaint (the \"Complaint\") alleges patent infringement (Counts I, II, III, and IV); trademark infringement (Counts V and VI); trade dress infringement (Count VII); and unfair competition (Counts VIII and IX). (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 10; Doc. 5-5 \u00b6\u00b6 29-72). The gravamen of the Complaint is that Hershey and its codefendants unlawfully copied f'real's self-serve milkshake machine and related marketing designs, display, and verbiage. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    generally\n   </em>\n   Doc. 5-5 \u00b6\u00b6 1-28).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   Liberty Mutual initially defended Hershey subject to a reservation of rights. (Doc. 19 \u00b6 11). Following dismissal of Counts VII, VIII, and IX, defendants notified Hershey that they would no longer defend or indemnify Hershey in the Delaware Action. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 12-13;\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Docs. 5-6, 5-7, 5-8). According to defendants, the remaining claims do not implicate a duty to defend or indemnify under the pertinent insurance policies. (Doc. 5-5 \u00b6\u00b6 12-13;\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Docs. 5-6, 5-7, 5-8).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   The policies at issue are annual commercial general liability insurance policies between Liberty Mutual and Hershey spanning from September 2012 to September 2015 (\"CGL policies\") and a commercial liability umbrella insurance policy from September 2014 to September 2015 between Liberty Insurance and Hershey (\"umbrella policy\"). (Doc. 19 \u00b6\u00b6 1-2). The CGL policies are, for all practical purposes, identical. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 3-6). The umbrella policy's relevant provisions likewise contain language and definitions identical to the CGL policies. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 7-8).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   Hershey filed the instant diversity action in March 2018 and amended its pleading the following month. Hershey seeks a declaration that defendants have a duty to defend and indemnify it in the Delaware Action (Counts I and II). Hershey also asserts breach of contract for defendants' withdrawal of their defense and alleged repudiation of their obligations under the CGL and umbrella policies (Counts III and IV). Hershey moves for summary judgment on its claims against Liberty Mutual (Counts I and III). Defendants move for summary judgment as to their \"duty to defend or indemnify Hershey\" in the Delaware Action.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   (Doc. 17 at 1; Doc. 17-1).

Relevant CGL and Umbrella Policy Provisions\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   The applicable \"Insuring Agreement\" in the CGL policies states as follows:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-22\">\n   We will pay those sums that the insured becomes legally obligated to pay as damages because of \"\n   <em>\n    personal and advertising injury\n   </em>\n   \" to which this insurance applies. We will have the right and duty to defend the insured against any \"suit\" seeking those damages even if the allegations of the \"suit\" are groundless, false or fraudulent. However, we will have no duty to defend the insured against any \"suit\" seeking damages for \"personal and advertising injury\" to which this insurance does not apply.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   (Doc. 19-1 at 21 (emphasis added)). This \"personal and advertising injury\" coverage is subject to numerous exclusions. (Doc. 19 \u00b6 4; Doc. 19-1 at 21-22). Of particular relevance for the instant case, exclusion \"i\" precludes coverage for \" 'personal and advertising injury' arising out of the infringement of copyright, patent, trademark, trade secret or other intellectual property rights,\" except for \"the use of another's advertising idea in [the insured's] 'advertisement.' \" (Doc. 19-1 at 21). Exclusion \"i\" also expressly provides that it does not apply to \"infringement, in [the insured's] 'advertisement,' of copyright, trade dress or slogan.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) Thus, subsection \"i\" generally excludes coverage for injuries stemming\n   from intellectual property infringement, but includes exceptions for (and thus expressly\n   <em>\n    provides\n   </em>\n   coverage for) injury from infringement of another's \"advertising idea\" or \"copyright, trade dress or slogan\" in the insured's \"advertisement.\" (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"2132029\" index=\"15\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/402/241/#p245\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   ) These two exceptions are mirrored in the definition of \"personal and advertising injury,\" which specifically includes injury arising out of,\n   <em>\n    inter alia\n   </em>\n   , \"[t]he use of another's advertising idea in [the insured's] 'advertisement'; or [i]nfringing upon another's copyright, trade dress or slogan in [the insured's] 'advertisement.' \" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 29).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   Finally, \"advertisement\" is defined in the CGL and umbrella policies as \"a paid announcement that is broadcast or published in the print, broadcast or electronic media to the general public or specific market segments about your goods, products or services for the purpose of attracting customers or supporters.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 27; Doc. 19 \u00b6\u00b6 7-8).

Any other\n   injury incurred from intellectual property infringement is excluded by the explicit terms of the policies.

The f'real display kiosk prominently features f'real's name\n   <em>\n    with f'real advertising slogans like \"Blend a F'REAL ... for REAL\" or \"REAL Milkshakes, REAL Good.\"\n   </em>\n   A\n   <em>\n    key part of f'real's advertising\n   </em>\n   to identify and distinguish its products\n   <em>\n    is the prominent use of the word \"REAL.\"\n   </em>\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-33\">\n   27. In addition to using f'real's patented blender technology, Hamilton Beach and Hershey Creamery have packaged their goods in containers and sold their products at retail kiosks that closely mimic those developed by f'real. For example as shown in the attached Exhibit 7, Hershey Creamery packages their competing frozen milk shakes in a plastic container that is comparable in size and shape to the plastic container f'real uses.

Defendants contend that such in-store advertising is not \"a paid announcement that is broadcast or published in the print, broadcast or electronic media.\" (Doc. 18 at 2 (quoting Doc. 19-1 at 27)). Hershey counters that the phrase \"published in the print ... media\" is broad enough to include slogans published on in-store advertising signage, or, at the very least, is ambiguous and should be construed in Hershey's favor.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   We need not determine the meaning of \"published in the print ... media\" or decide whether in-store advertising signage qualifies as an advertisement under that meaning. We find that, when f'real's allegations are read together and construed liberally in Hershey's favor, the Complaint implicates Liberty Mutual's duty to defend because the trademark infringement claims \"might or might not fall within the policy's coverage.\"\n   <em>\n    Jerry's Sport Ctr., Inc.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4197434,7288227\" index=\"35\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a3d/2/526/\">\n    2 A.3d at 541\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   <strong>\n    2.\n    <em>\n     Implication of the Duty to Defend\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   We begin by noting that the Complaint repeatedly emphasizes f'real's concern with infringement on its advertising ideas and slogans, which employ \"prominent use\" of the word \"REAL.\" (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Doc. 5-5 \u00b6\u00b6 22, 23, 27, 28, 56, 59). Paragraphs 22 and 23 identify f'real's marketing slogans, including one that is trademarked, which utilize \"REAL\" as part of its advertising strategy. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 22-23). Paragraph 23 specifically uses the phrase \"advertising slogans\" when discussing f'real's distinctive use of the word \"REAL\" in its advertising, setting the stage for its explanation, in paragraph 27, of how Hershey purportedly infringed by using \"REAL\" in its slogans for its similar products. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 23). Paragraph 28 discusses Hershey's \"advertising signage\" that makes repeated use of the word \"REAL.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 28). This paragraph also identifies allegedly infringing advertising slogans that Hershey uses: \"REAL ICE CREAM,\" \"REAL MILKSHAKES\" and \"REAL FAST.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   )\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   Finally, paragraphs 56 and 59 assert trademark infringement (federal and common law, respectively) by broadly alleging \"use\" by Hershey of infringing slogans\n   including \"REAL ICE CREAM,\" \"REAL MILKSHAKES,\" and \"REAL FAST\" for \"competing blending machines and milkshakes[.]\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 56, 59). These inclusive paragraphs provide no limiting language as to the type of wrongful trademark \"use\" for which Hershey is allegedly liable.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   Defendants contend that if paragraphs 56 and 59 relate to advertising at all, they can only refer to advertisements specifically alleged earlier in the Complaint,\n   <em>\n    viz.\n   </em>\n   , in-store advertising signage. We disagree. A complaint is not a contract, and we reject defendants' attempt to apply contract interpretation principles to f'real's pleading. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    e.g.\n   </em>\n   , Doc. 21 at 6-7). Broad claims for trademark infringement-like in Counts V and VI of the Complaint, which generally allege improper use by Hershey of f'real's trademarks in Hershey's competing slogans-quite naturally could include infringement in advertising as well as in packaging and displays. And, in fact, f'real includes examples of such slogan infringement in advertising, packaging, and displays earlier in the Complaint, which f'real incorporates by reference.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   Nothing in the Complaint or paragraphs 56 and 59 limits f'real's trademark infringement claims to only those specific instances of improper usage mentioned in previous paragraphs. After all, there is no requirement that a plaintiff exhaustively list every infringing act to plausibly state a claim for relief; complaints frequently contain nonexhaustive lists of allegedly wrongful conduct without limiting recovery to such occurrences, especially because discovery has not yet taken place. We reject defendants' assertion that, even though the Complaint repeatedly and broadly discusses slogan infringement in relation to advertising, the duty to defend is obviated because the specific infringement examples provided do not satisfy the insurer's own interpretation of the policy's definition of \"advertisement.\" The law is to the contrary, obligating an insurer to defend if it is\n   <em>\n    possible\n   </em>\n   that a claim falls within the policy's coverage, and requiring any doubts on this score to be resolved in favor of the insured.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   The Complaint makes clear that f'real believes Hershey infringed on f'real's advertising ideas and slogans, and specifically did so in the context of advertising for \"competing blending machines and milkshakes.\" This is a sufficient nexus between advertising and injury to trigger a duty to defend-it is at least possible that a covered \"advertising injury\" may be part of f'real's recovery against Hershey. We conclude that, in light of the broad nature of the allegations, and when liberally construing the Complaint in Hershey's favor, f'real's remaining claims \"may\n   <em>\n    potentially\n   </em>\n   come within the coverage of the policy.\"\n   <em>\n    Transamerica Ins.

Breach of Contract\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   Hershey also moves for summary judgment on Count III, which asserts that Liberty Mutual breached its obligations under the CGL policies by withdrawing its defense in the Delaware Action and repudiating its potential indemnification obligation if Hershey were found liable. A\n   breach of contract claim under Pennsylvania law consists of three elements: (1) the existence of a contract that includes its essential terms; (2) a breach of that contract; and (3) damages resulting from the breach.\n   <em>\n    Meyer, Darragh, Buckler, Bebenek &amp; Eck, P.L.L.C. v.

The contractual obligation allegedly violated is the duty to defend and the same CGL policy provisions are at issue, in particular the \"Insuring Agreement\" that states that Liberty Mutual \"will have the right and duty to defend the insured against any 'suit' seeking\" damages for \"personal and advertising injury.\" (Doc. 19-1 at 21).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   Hershey alleges that Liberty Mutual's withdrawal of its defense and continuing refusal to defend constitutes a breach of the CGL policies. (Doc. 5 \u00b6 54). Liberty Mutual admits that it withdrew its defense, claiming it did so because it had no further duty to defend in the Delaware Action after Rule 12 motion practice. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Doc. 15 \u00b6\u00b6 19-21; Doc. 20 \u00b6\u00b6 19-21). Because Liberty Mutual was wrong about its duty to defend, withdrawing its defense without first seeking declaratory judgment violated its obligations under the CGL policies.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Harrison v. Cabot Oil &amp; Gas Corp.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6786979\" index=\"40\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/pa/631/268/\">\n    631 Pa. 268\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6885123,6786979\" index=\"41\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a3d/110/178/\">\n    110 A.3d 178\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 184-85 (2015) (citing RESTATEMENT ( SECOND ) OF CONTRACTS \u00a7 250 cmt. d ( AM. LAW INST. 1981)). Accordingly, Hershey has satisfied its burden at summary judgment on the first two elements of its breach of contract claim.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-50\">\n   The problem for Hershey is that it has not yet established the third element-damages. Hershey clearly\n   <em>\n    pled\n   </em>\n   that it suffered injury from Liberty Mutual's withdrawal and refusal to defend, (\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Doc. 5 \u00b6\u00b6 54, 56), but bare allegations do not suffice at the Rule 56 stage,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   FED.

We recognize that a finite loss amount for the failure to defend is likely unknown at this time. However, liability for breach of contract under Pennsylvania law requires proof of damages, and Hershey has not provided any Rule 56 support for its allegations that it was harmed by Liberty Mutual's breach. We thus are constrained to grant in part and deny in part Hershey's motion for summary judgment on Count III. We will grant summary judgment as to establishment of Liberty Mutual's contractual obligation and breach, but deny-without prejudice-summary judgment as to the issue of damages resulting therefrom.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Meyer, Darragh, Buckler, Bebenek &amp; Eck, P.L.L.C.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12280958,12280948,6805965,6806054\" index=\"44\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a3d/137/1247/\">\n    137 A.3d at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   1258 ; FED.
