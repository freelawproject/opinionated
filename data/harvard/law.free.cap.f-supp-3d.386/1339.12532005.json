Acoba, Roman Gulla Bibat, and Angie Siapno Bibat's (\"Plaintiffs\") Motion for Order of Remand (\"Motion\"), filed on February 28, 2019. [Dkt. no. 13.] Defendant PNC Bank, N.A. (\"PNC\") filed its memorandum in opposition on March 29, 2019, and Plaintiffs filed their reply on April 5, 2019. [Dkt. nos. 21, 22.] This matter came on for hearing on April 19, 2019. For the reasons set forth below, Plaintiffs' Motion is hereby granted in part and denied in part. The Motion is granted insofar as the instant case is remanded to the state court because the non-diverse defendants were not fraudulently joined. The Motion is denied as to Plaintiffs' request for an award of removal-related attorneys' fees and costs because, although the removal was improper, PNC had an objectively reasonable basis for attempting removal.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     BACKGROUND\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   The instant case arises out of the foreclosures of Plaintiffs' respective properties. Plaintiffs filed their Complaint in the State of Hawai'i Second Circuit Court (\"state court\") on December 21, 2018, and the\n   action was removed to federal court on January 30, 2019. [Notice of Removal (dkt. no. 1), Decl. of Lauren K. Chun, Exh. 1 (Complaint), Exh. 2 (First Amended Complaint, filed 12/27/18).]\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   According to the First Amended Complaint: Plaintiffs Christopher Carpenter (\"Carpenter\") and Mary T. Bulzomi (\"Bulzomi\") are residents and citizens of New Jersey; Plaintiffs Daniel K. Iwasaki (\"Iwasaki\") and Bernie L. Acoba (\"Acoba\") are residents and citizens of Hawai'i; and Plaintiffs Roman Gulla Bibat and Angie Siapno Bibat (\"Bibats\") are residents of Nevada, but they are in the process of moving to Hawai'i, which they intend to make their permanent residence. [First Amended Complaint at \u00b6\u00b6 3-8.] PNC is the successor by merger to National City Bank (\"NCB\"). PNC is organized under United States law and Delaware law, and has its principal place of business in Pennsylvania. [\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 9.]\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   Plaintiffs acknowledge their respective mortgages each gave the mortgagee a power of sale, which authorized the mortgagee to sell the property in the event of default. Plaintiffs contend each mortgagee agreed to sell the property \"in a manner reasonably calculated to obtain the best possible price for the\" property. [\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 36.] According to the First Amended Complaint, National City Mortgage (\"NCM\") and/or PNC asserted the right to use Haw. Rev. Stat. Chapter 667, Part I (2008) for the power of sale as the mortgagee and/or the assignee of each of Plaintiffs' mortgages. [\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 37.]\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   From 2009 through 2011, PNC was represented by the law firm Routh Crabtree Olson, which later became known as RCO Hawaii LLLC (\"RCO\"), in PNC's nonjudicial foreclosures in Hawai'i. [\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 21.] NCM and/or PNC, acting through RCO, commenced nonjudicial foreclosure proceedings against Plaintiffs, pursuant to the respective mortgages and\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Haw.%20Rev.%20Stat.%20%C2%A7%20667-5\">\n    Haw.

[\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 38.]\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   Plaintiffs allege that the foreclosure notices prepared for the foreclosure of each of Plaintiffs' properties violated\n   <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Haw.%20Rev.%20Stat.%20%C2%A7%20667-7\">\n    Haw. Rev. Stat. \u00a7 667-7\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a)(1) (2008) because none contained an adequate description of the property to be sold. [\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 43.] Plaintiffs also allege that, in each foreclosure, only a quitclaim deed was offered. [\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 44.] Offering and selling only a quitclaim deed, Plaintiffs contend, breached the mortgagee's duties because it was not reasonably calculated to obtain the best price for the property. [\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 46.]\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   Further, in each foreclosure, the auction was held on a date other than that specified on the respective foreclosure notice,\n   <em>\n    i.e.\n   </em>\n   the actual auction date was unpublished, and no notice of the postponement of the sale was published. Either PNC or its nominee was the successful bidder at each auction; the properties were conveyed to PNC or its nominee; and foreclosure affidavits were recorded. In this manner, Plaintiffs assert they were wrongfully deprived of their properties, and these sales are either void or voidable because of PNC's failure to comply with Chapter 667, Part I and the applicable case law. [\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6\u00b6 47-48.]\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   Defendant Robert White (\"White\") claims current title to Carpenter and Bulzomi's property, Defendant Guinevere Ray Stromberg (\"Stromberg\") claims current title to Iwasaki and Acoba's property, and Defendants Enrique Piano Paa, Jr. and Joyce Lan Kim Paa (\"Paas\") claim current title to the Bibats' property. [\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 77.] White, Stromberg, and the Paas (collectively \"Purchaser Defendants\") are all residents and citizens of Hawai'i. [\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6\u00b6 10, 12, 17.]\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   In a nutshell, Plaintiffs' claims against the Purchaser Defendants arise out of the\n   contention that the foreclosure affidavits used to support the foreclosures of each of Plaintiffs' properties constitute constructive or actual notice of apparent defects in the chain of title. As a result, Plaintiffs contend the Purchaser Defendants are not bona fide purchasers (\"BFPs\"). Plaintiffs also argue PNC's quitclaim deeds to its nominees were void\n   <em>\n    ab initio\n   </em>\n   , and therefore the special warranty deed from the nominees to each of the Purchaser Defendants is also void.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Haw.%20Rev.%20Stat.%20%C2%A7%20667-7\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Haw.%20Rev.%20Stat.%20%C2%A7%20667-7\">\n    at \u00b6\u00b6 82-83\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   Plaintiffs assert they were all members of the putative class in\n   <em>\n    Fergerstrom v. PNC Bank, N.A.\n   </em>\n   , CV 13-00526 DKW-RLP (\"\n   <em>\n    Fergerstrom\n   </em>\n   \"), which was originally filed in the State of Hawai'i First Circuit Court on September 9, 2013.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   <em>\n    Fergerstrom\n   </em>\n   was removed to this district court, and class certification was denied on September 18, 2018. Thus, Plaintiffs argue the statute of limitations on their claims was tolled starting September 9, 2013 until September 18, 2018, and therefore their claims against PNC are timely. [\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 18.]\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   Plaintiffs assert the following claims: a wrongful foreclosure claim against PNC (\"Count I\"); unfair and deceptive trade practices and unfair methods of competition, in violation of Haw. Rev. Stat. Chapter 480, against PNC (\"Count II\"); and quiet title and ejectment against the Purchaser Defendants, and against: First California Mortgage Company (\"FCMC\") - White's mortgagee; Defendant Bank of America, N.A. (\"Bank of America\") - Stromberg's mortgagee; Defendant Wells Fargo Bank, N.A. - the Paas' mortgagee; and Defendant Mortgage Electronic Registration Systems, Inc. - FCMC and Bank of America's nominee (\"Lienholder Defendants\" and \"Count III\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   PNC removed this case based on diversity jurisdiction. [Notice of Removal at \u00b6 10.] PNC contends Plaintiffs are either citizens of Hawai'i or New Jersey, although the Bibats may be citizens of Nevada. PNC is a Delaware citizen. Thus, there is complete diversity between Plaintiffs and PNC. PNC argues the citizenship of the Purchaser Defendants and Lienholder Defendants need not be considered because they were fraudulently joined.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   Plaintiffs now seek remand of this case: 1) because this Court lacks subject matter jurisdiction under\n   <extracted-citation index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201332\">\n    28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1332\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ;\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   and/or 2) based on the forum defendant rule,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201441\">\n    28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1441\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (b)(2), and also seek an award of attorneys' fees and costs, pursuant to\n   <extracted-citation index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201447\">\n    28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1447\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (c).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     STANDARD\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   <strong>\n    I.\n    <em>\n     General Removal Principles\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   The general statute governing removal,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"6\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201441\">\n    28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1441\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , is \"strictly construe[d] ... against removal jurisdiction.\"\n   <em>\n    Hansen v.

Similarly, because Plaintiffs' quiet title claims against the Lienholder Defendants are based upon Plaintiffs' claims against the Purchaser Defendants, the Lienholder Defendants were not fraudulently joined. Because there was no fraudulent joinder, the citizenship of all defendants must be considered for purposes of diversity jurisdiction.
