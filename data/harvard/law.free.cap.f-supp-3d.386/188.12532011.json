Defendant Wal-Mart of Puerto Rico, Inc., d/b/a Sam's Club Humacao (\"Wal-Mart\") filed a motion for summary judgment.\n   <strong>\n    ECF No. 37\n   </strong>\n   . Plaintiff Lainey Ann Rivera (\"plaintiff\") filed a response in opposition.\n   <strong>\n    ECF No. 48\n   </strong>\n   . Wal-Mart filed a surreply after seeking leave of the Court.\n   <strong>\n    ECF No. 55\n   </strong>\n   . Plaintiff also filed a motion for sanctions due to spoliation of evidence simultaneously with her opposition to summary judgment.\n   <strong>\n    ECF No. 47\n   </strong>\n   . Wal-Mart opposed the motion for sanctions.\n   <strong>\n    ECF No. 54\n   </strong>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   Prior to ruling on summary judgment, the Court referred the spoliation matter to a Magistrate Judge for mediation, evaluation, and adjudication as deemed appropriate.\n   <strong>\n    ECF No. 57\n   </strong>\n   . The Court subsequently referred the summary judgment motion for a report and recommendation (\"R&amp;R\") based on the interrelationship of issues between the two motions.\n   <strong>\n    ECF No. 68\n   </strong>\n   . The Magistrate's R&amp;R recommends granting summary judgment in favor of Wal-Mart, which would moot plaintiff's spoliation motion.\n   <strong>\n    ECF No. 69\n   </strong>\n   . Plaintiff timely objected to the R&amp;R.\n   <strong>\n    ECF No. 70\n   </strong>\n   . Wal-Mart\n   filed a response to plaintiff's objection.\n   <strong>\n    ECF No. 71\n   </strong>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   For the reasons explained below, the Court hereby\n   <strong>\n    REJECTS\n   </strong>\n   the R&amp;R.\n   <strong>\n    ECF No. 69\n   </strong>\n   .

They also dispute what visible signs of injury Roberto exhibited after his fall. In its proposed uncontested facts, Wal-Mart focused on Ada's statement that she did not notice any visible injuries when she returned from the restroom. Plaintiff opposed, noting that Ada described Roberto as complaining of leg pain immediately after the incident, of needing to hold onto the shopping cart for walking-assistance, and of feeling too unwell to exit the vehicle during their brief errand before returning home. Plaintiff also noted that Supervisor described Roberto as limping, dizzy, and talking slowly after the fall, while both Supervisor and Assistant Manager observed a red welt on the back of Roberto's head after the fall.\n   <strong>\n    ECF Nos. 37-4\n   </strong>\n   at 13, 18;\n   <strong>\n    47-1\n   </strong>\n   at 19;\n   <strong>\n    48\n   </strong>\n   at 7-8.

Procedural Background\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   Plaintiff filed the underlying complaint based on diversity jurisdiction, seeking damages for Wal-Mart's negligence on the theory that a defective swing caused Roberto's fall and subsequent death.\n   <strong>\n    ECF No. 1\n   </strong>\n   . Specifically, plaintiff's complaint alleges that \"co-defendants failed to exercise reasonable care to consider the foreseeable consequences of having a faulty manufactured or assembled swing exposed for use by customers, and/or encouraging its use, while having it [on] display without further warnings.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 6. Wal-Mart answered the complaint and subsequently moved for summary judgment based on its assertion that plaintiff lacks admissible, non-hearsay evidence to prove the causation element of her negligence claim.\n   <strong>\n    ECF\n   </strong>\n   <strong>\n    No. 37-1\n   </strong>\n   at 21-23. Wal-Mart relies on the lack of eyewitness testimony, surveillance footage, and evidence establishing that the swing was defective or defectively assembled.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Plaintiff opposed the motion for summary judgment and concurrently filed a separate motion for sanctions due to spoliation of evidence, arguing that Wal-Mart intentionally destroyed relevant surveillance footage, the swing, and any documents it created in relation to an internal investigation of the incident.\n   <strong>\n    ECF Nos. 48\n   </strong>\n   at 4;\n   <strong>\n    47\n   </strong>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   <strong>\n    II.

Similarly, Wal-Mart asserts that plaintiff may not rely on a hospital file that states the swing caused Roberto's fall because that statement also constitutes double hearsay; Roberto was not conscious at the hospital.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 22.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-52\">\n   Wal-Mart's hearsay argument, which constitutes the crux of its motion for summary judgment, is conclusory and lacking in analysis under the applicable hearsay rules and exceptions. The Court is not convinced, based on the undisputed evidence, as well as the evidence Wal-Mart failed to specifically controvert, that Roberto's statements to Ada after his fall necessarily constitute inadmissible hearsay. The Magistrate Judge also did not consider the applicable hearsay exceptions in the R&amp;R. Based on the record available, the Court finds that Roberto's statements to Ada would be admissible under either the present sense impression or excited utterance hearsay exceptions.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Fed.

The spontaneity and contemporaneity of these statements is also supported by the record currently available to the Court. The parties do not dispute that Roberto fell while Ada was in the restroom for a few minutes and that Ada came to his side immediately after exiting the restroom. Ada testified that Roberto made some, if not all, of the statements about the swing moments after his fall and while he remained splayed under the swing on the ground. And, even if Roberto made those statements sometime after he turned upright, the parties dispute how dazed Roberto remained after the incident, before he lost consciousness. In other words, it is disputed as to whether, at any time after Roberto's fall and before he fell unconscious, the excitement of the incident sufficiently faded to allow him to engage in reflective thought, thereby undermining the applicability of these hearsay exceptions. When he made these statements would still be relevant and from the uncontroverted deposition testimony available, it appears he made them while he laid on the ground under the swing or shortly thereafter. Further, it appears that Roberto remained in distress while on the drive home from Sam's Club and during the brief errand at Wal-Mart. Thus, it is likely that he never had an opportunity to engage in reflective thought after the incident, rendering all of his statements to Ada about the cause of his fall admissible as excited utterances or present sense impressions.\n   <strong>\n    ECF\n   </strong>\n   <strong>\n    No. 48-3\n   </strong>\n   at 13-16.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-57\">\n   Wal-Mart is certainly welcome to object to the admissibility of these statements at trial and upon presentation of further information about the circumstances surrounding these statements.

That a person has chronic health issues, without more, does not negate plaintiff's claim that Roberto fell when the backrest of the swung \"threw [him] backwards\" \"like a breadfruit.\" Plaintiff also points out that Wal-Mart supports this medical condition argument with seemingly unrelated emergency room records from eight years ago, as if they presented a self-explanatory explanation for Roberto's death, while Wal-Mart failed to address the forensic report identifying cranial cerebral trauma as Roberto's cause of death.\n   <strong>\n    ECF\n   </strong>\n   <strong>\n    No. 48\n   </strong>\n   at 12-13.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-62\">\n   Additionally, as discussed below,\n   <em>\n    see supra\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 IV, there is sufficient evidence in the record for a jury to infer that Wal-Mart acted in bad faith by failing to disclose/retain investigation documents, the swing, and all relevant surveillance footage from the day of Roberto's fall.\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n   This reasonable inference of bad faith suggests that the evidence Wal-Mart failed to preserve was unfavorable to Wal-Mart.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Testa v.

It takes no leap of the imagination to consider litigation \"reasonably foreseeable\" upon learning that a patron died after sitting on, falling from, and landing underneath, a patio swing in one of Wal-Mart's stores. Manager stated in his deposition, \"As a general manager, it was an incident that occurred in my club, and I thought that it was the right thing to go to them, and place myself at their disposal, if I could help them in any way.\"\n   <strong>\n    ECF\n   </strong>\n   <strong>\n    No. 47-1\n   </strong>\n   at 7.

And, although Manager denied being able to \"establish a link of [Roberto's] death with the fall[ ] ... at that time,\" he nonetheless recognized that the precipitating cause of Roberto's death may have been the fall that occurred in his store.\n   <strong>\n    ECF Nos. 47-1\n   </strong>\n   at 7, 18;\n   <strong>\n    48-1\n   </strong>\n   at 11. Whether, during Manager's visit with Roberto's family, the family spelled out their interest in pursuing litigation in unequivocal terms, while mourning their sudden and tragic loss, is not the standard for notice under this framework. Similarly, Ada's intention in completing an incident report-for \"insurance purposes\"-after Roberto's death hardly refutes plaintiff's assertion that it put Wal-Mart on notice under the spoliation standard. And, Wal-Mart's attempt to blame the swing's destruction on one employee's purported lack of knowledge does not negate its \"institutional notice\" to ensure the swing is preserved from, i.e., an\n   unaware employee's routine destruction of the swing.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Testa,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1306681\" index=\"46\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/144/173/#p177\">\n    144 F.3d at 177-78\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (rejecting Wal-Mart's defense that the employee responsible for the destruction of evidence was unaware of the plaintiff's injury as insufficient to \"dictate the resolution\" of the dispute).

Wal-Mart knew of Ada's involvement at the scene of Roberto's fall and her relationship to Roberto.

The Surveillance Footage\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-77\">\n   Wal-Mart argues that it never possessed the surveillance footage at issue and therefore cannot be sanctioned for destroying evidence that did not exist. Wal-Mart explains that, \"there was no camera view\" of the area where Roberto's fall occurred.\n   <strong>\n    ECF Nos. 48-1\n   </strong>\n   at 4, 8, 10;\n   <strong>\n    54\n   </strong>\n   at 8.

Manager stated that Josu\u00e9 concluded there was no footage of the accident because there were no cameras pointed in the direction of the swing.\n   <footnotemark>\n    7\n   </footnotemark>\n   <strong>\n    ECF\n   </strong>\n   <strong>\n    No. 48-1\n   </strong>\n   at 4-7. Manager described the store as having many surveillance cameras, some of which swivel, but he did not specify what type of cameras were installed in the area of the swing, how many, or where they were pointed except there was \"no view towards that area.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1306681\" index=\"47\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/144/173/#p177\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   He noted that the swing was located in the \"seasonal area\" which was \"in front of the cash registers\" and near the entrance, and that the store maintains fixed cameras at the registers and some swiveling cameras in the parking area.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 7. Manager also stated that he did not specifically ask Josu\u00e9 to look for footage depicting Roberto's gait even though Manager knew that Roberto may have been limping and clutching his stomach after the fall.\n   <strong>\n    ECF Nos. 47-1\n   </strong>\n   at 15;\n   <strong>\n    48-1\n   </strong>\n   at 4-5.

He also suggested that the footage could have been \"lost\" in the process of Josu\u00e9 \"leaving\" and that he was unsure if anyone completed Josue's investigation of the surveillance footage upon Josu\u00e9's departure.\n   <footnotemark>\n    8\n   </footnotemark>\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 6, 11. Additionally, Manager testified that \"there is a double file kept of the recordings,\" with one copy retained in the store\n   and the other \"at CMI,\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    9\n   </footnotemark>\n   but that he had no explanation as to why there was no footage, a backup copy or original copy, retained in this case in any location.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 7-9. Manager also did not personally view or reexamine any footage, despite having access to the system.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 4-5, 9. He explained that although the footage was now no longer available in the store, he could access a copy from CMI by submitting a request.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 5-6. Later, he testified that there was no way he could access any footage.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 7-9.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-79\">\n   A factfinder could reasonably conclude that no footage of Roberto's fall existed but that other footage relevant to plaintiff's claim, i.e., depicting Roberto's injuries (or lack thereof), did exist and Wal-Mart failed to look for it or preserve it. Whether this failure was negligent versus intentional, remains to be seen. A jury could deem Wal-Mart's inquiry sufficient and that it erased the remainder of the footage in accordance with its business practices. Manager's testimony is, however, conflicting and unclear, leaving room for a fact finder to infer obfuscation and bad faith.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Blinzler\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7653688\" index=\"48\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/81/1148/#p1159\">\n    81 F.3d at 1159\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (\"When the evidence indicates that a party is aware of circumstances that are likely to give rise to future litigation and yet destroys potentially relevant records without particularized inquiry, a factfinder may reasonably infer that the party probably did so because the records would harm its case.\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-80\">\n   <strong>\n    b. The Swing\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-81\">\n   Wal-Mart argues that the swing cannot form the basis of plaintiff's spoliation claim because the swing's relevance to Roberto's fall is speculative; she \"does not know what caused the accident.\"\n   <strong>\n    ECF\n   </strong>\n   <strong>\n    No. 54\n   </strong>\n   at 1-2. According to Wal-Mart, plaintiff needs to successfully prove negligence before she is entitled to a spoliation argument.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 2. Wal-Mart also suggests that because its inspection of the swing showed no signs of defect, the swing is not relevant to plaintiff's claim.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-82\">\n   Wal-Mart's interpretation of the spoliation rule swallows the purpose of the rule. Plaintiff must provide evidence sufficient for a fact finder to determine (1) notice of \"reasonably foreseeable litigation\" and (2) the spoiled evidence's \"potential relevance\" to the claim. Plaintiff has a claim, as sustained above, and Wal-Mart's attempt to gut the claim by relying on its failures to preserve is unpersuasive. Likewise, Wal-Mart's assurances that the swing is not relevant because its employee(s) inspected it and found nothing wrong, is putting the cart before the horse. The relevance of the swing to plaintiff's claim is not contingent on Wal-Mart's theory of the case or its self-serving assertions that the swing was fine.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-83\">\n   Moreover, Wal-Mart's inspection of the swing hardly inspires confidence, seemingly amounting to a proverbial \"kicking of its tires.\" Manager testified in his deposition that he inspected the swing around July 17, 2015,\n   <footnotemark>\n    10\n   </footnotemark>\n   stating, \"I did not have the assembly instructions. I just checked to see if it was solid, and that it was in perfect condition.\"\n   <strong>\n    ECF\n   </strong>\n   <strong>\n    No. 48-1\n   </strong>\n   at 11, 13, 16. Manager also did not know who originally assembled the swing, as that is information Sam's Club does not retain.\n   <strong>\n    ECF Nos. 48-1\n   </strong>\n   at 13;\n   <strong>\n    48-7\n   </strong>\n   at 19-20. He also clarified that he has no specific skills in swing construction.\n   <strong>\n    ECF\n   </strong>\n   <strong>\n    No. 47-1\n   </strong>\n   at 22-23. Manager testified, \"There was no visible defect. It did not feel weird, there [were] no broken pieces of wood, the structure was completely functional and whole.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-84\">\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 23. Manager stated he was accompanied by Assistant Manager, an individual from Asset Protection, and Supervisor and that they concluded that the swing had worn paint and no other problems.\n   <strong>\n    ECF\n   </strong>\n   <strong>\n    No. 48-7\n   </strong>\n   at 16. Somewhat confusingly, he also testified that he reviewed the swing on his own.\n   <strong>\n    ECF\n   </strong>\n   <strong>\n    No. 47-1\n   </strong>\n   at 22-23. It is unclear if Manager inspected the swing once or twice or simply does not have a strong memory of it either way.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-85\">\n   The swing's relevance is glaringly obvious. Roberto died after sitting on and falling from the swing. He allegedly told Ada, apparently the last person he spoke to before dying, that a problem with the swing caused him to fall. Ada communicated that to Wal-Mart management when they visited her house to offer their condolences and to help with Roberto's funeral. Thus, the relevance of the swing and Wal-Mart's notice of its relevance were communicated to Wal-Mart within days of Roberto's fall (if not earlier), and with ample time for Wal-Mart to secure the swing.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-86\">\n   Wal-Mart next asserts that its decommissioning of the swing was, at the most, negligent. Therefore, plaintiff cannot show bad faith to warrant an adverse inference instruction.\n   <strong>\n    ECF\n   </strong>\n   <strong>\n    No. 54\n   </strong>\n   at 11. Wal-Mart explained that, after Roberto's fall, the swing remained in place on the store floor, with the seat of the swing raised to prevent patrons from sitting on it.\n   <strong>\n    ECF\n   </strong>\n   <strong>\n    No. 47-3\n   </strong>\n   at 22. About three weeks after Roberto's fall, on August 8 or 9, 2015, Waleska Calvo, an Overnight Assistant Shift Manager (\"Night Manager\"), \"decommissioned\" the swing in the exercise of her normal duties and discretion to determine when to change the store's displays.\n   <strong>\n    ECF\n   </strong>\n   <strong>\n    No. 48-1\n   </strong>\n   at 14-15. She apparently ordered the swing's decommissioning in light of visible wear to its paint job, although she had the option of selling the display.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 13-14. Wal-Mart offers no explanation as to why Night Manager chose to destroy the swing rather than sell it, other than she had the discretion to do so.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Wal-Mart notes that because Night Manager worked an overnight shift, she \"did not meet the people who work[ed] during the day,\" suggesting that she remained ignorant of Roberto's fall.\n   <strong>\n    ECF\n   </strong>\n   <strong>\n    No. 54\n   </strong>\n   at 11, 13. Wal-Mart also submitted an affidavit signed by Night Manager, dated two-and-a-half years after Roberto's fall, indicating that she remembered decommissioning the swing for aesthetic reasons and that she was unaware of Roberto's accident at that time she decommissioned it.\n   <strong>\n    ECF No. 54-2\n   </strong>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-87\">\n   The Court finds there is sufficient evidence for a jury to find bad faith by Wal-Mart in relation to its treatment of the swing. Wal-Mart's claim that Night Manager coincidentally decommissioned the swing within a month of Roberto's fall and death is fairly inconceivable, and Night Manager's assurances in an affidavit dated two-and-a-half years afterwards could be reasonably disregarded as unreliable.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Most importantly, however, Night Manager's mental state at the time she decommissioned the swing does not negate Wal-Mart's responsibility to preserve evidence upon notice of potential litigation.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Testa\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1306681\" index=\"49\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/144/173/#p177\">\n    144 F.3d at 177-78\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . The institutional notice imputed to Wal-Mart requires it to ensure its left hand knows what its right hand is doing. Whether Wal-Mart opted to be discreet and not inform Night Manager of the incident, an argument Wal-Mart does not raise, also offers little explanation for why the swing remained on display in the storefront for weeks after the incident, subject to tampering by patrons and decommissioning by unwitting night managers. Indeed, this preservation requirement is squarely stated within Wal-Mart's store policy, requiring that evidence of a claim \"be secured at store level in case the claim becomes litigated,\" and to store the evidence\n   in a location that will ensure it is \"not be destroyed, damaged or tampered with.\"\n   <strong>\n    ECF No. 48-8\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-88\">\n   <strong>\n    c. The Investigation Evidence\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-89\">\n   Wal-Mart characterizes plaintiff's argument that it failed to preserve documentation of its internal investigation as an attempt to impose on it the duty to collect evidence on plaintiff's behalf.\n   <strong>\n    ECF\n   </strong>\n   <strong>\n    No. 54\n   </strong>\n   at 9. Wal-Mart asserts that it did not conduct an investigation into Roberto's fall because Ada and Roberto refused to complete an incident report on the day of the fall.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 9-10. Thus, as with the surveillance footage, Wal-Mart concludes that it cannot be sanctioned for failing to preserve that which did not exist.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-90\">\n   This argument is disingenuous. Ada\n   <em>\n    did\n   </em>\n   complete an incident report, albeit sometime after the fall, a distinction that Wal-Mart does not assert as relevant. And, Manager affirmatively stated at various points, that\n   <em>\n    he participated in the investigation into\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Roberto's fall. See, e.g.,\n   </em>\n   <strong>\n    ECF Nos. 47-1\n   </strong>\n   at 11;\n   <strong>\n    47-3\n   </strong>\n   at 9, 11, 14-16;\n   <strong>\n    48-1\n   </strong>\n   at 11;\n   <strong>\n    48-7\n   </strong>\n   at 9, 15. What's more, he described the investigation in some detail in both his deposition and in answers to interrogatories, stating that he conducted the investigation \"as part of the ordinary process and regular course of business done at the store.\"\n   <strong>\n    ECF\n   </strong>\n   <strong>\n    No. 48-7\n   </strong>\n   at 15. Supervisor, Assistant Manager, and an individual from Asset Protection aided him in the investigation.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Manager indicated he spoke with Supervisor, Ada, and other individuals in conjunction with the investigation.\n   <strong>\n    ECF\n   </strong>\n   <strong>\n    No. 47-1\n   </strong>\n   at 4-6, 8-9, 14. His investigation included an inspection of the swing.\n   <strong>\n    ECF\n   </strong>\n   <strong>\n    No. 48-7\n   </strong>\n   at 15. His conclusions from the investigation were that Roberto \"had several medical conditions therefore he was weak and was not supposed to be left unattended at the store\" and \"that the Pergola Swing was not defective and had nothing to do with [Roberto's] fall.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Additionally, Manager stated that he sent a memorandum by email\n   <footnotemark>\n    11\n   </footnotemark>\n   summarizing his conversations with Ada, but Wal-Mart did not include the email in its case file or otherwise save it because it \"was just a follow-up.\"\n   <strong>\n    ECF\n   </strong>\n   <strong>\n    No. 47-1\n   </strong>\n   at 4-6. He also indicated that he prepared a report summarizing his investigation and other conversations he had in conjunction with Roberto's fall.\n   <footnotemark>\n    12\n   </footnotemark>\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 9, 14.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-91\">\n   In other words, Manager stated in a deposition and answers to an interrogatory that: (1) he and his staff conducted an investigation, and (2) he created at least two documents in relation to that investigation. Wal-Mart, on the other hand, argues in its opposition to spoliation sanctions that no investigation occurred and, in fact, its nonoccurrence is Ada and Roberto's fault. The Court is not persuaded by Wal-Mart's brazen double-talk. There is ample evidence for the fact finder to conclude that an investigation occurred, generating at least some documentation, all of which Wal-Mart was on notice to keep safely stored for reasonably foreseeable litigation. Likewise, there is ample evidence for the fact finder to conclude that Wal-Mart's reasoning for failure to provide or preserve this information exhibits bad faith.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-92\">\n   <strong>\n    C.

Wal-Mart had an opportunity be heard, having responded to plaintiff's spoliation motion and plaintiff's spoliation arguments contained in her summary judgment opposition.\n   <strong>\n    ECF Nos. 54\n   </strong>\n   ,\n   <strong>\n    55\n   </strong>\n   . Plaintiff requested the spoliation sanctions of an adverse inference jury instruction, entry of default judgment, prohibition of Wal-Mart's affirmative defenses, and \"any other relief that [the Court] deems just and proper.\"\n   <strong>\n    ECF\n   </strong>\n   <strong>\n    No. 47\n   </strong>\n   at 17.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-97\">\n   The evidence presented to the Court shows that Manager and Supervisor, and therefore Wal-Mart, had notice of reasonably foreseeable litigation upon their visit with Roberto's family shortly after Roberto's death. Manager and Supervisor went to Roberto's home to offer to help pay for his funeral, at which time Ada told them that she attributed Roberto's death to a problem with the swing. Manager conducted an investigation and memorialized at least parts of his investigation in writing, such as his interviews with other employees and Ada. Wal-Mart now claims no investigation occurred and, remarkably, that its nonoccurrence is Roberto and Ada's fault. Not only does this demonstrate that Wal-Mart failed to preserve/provide investigation evidence, but it also strongly supports that it did so deliberately.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-98\">\n   Wal-Mart also affirmatively failed to preserve the swing. Indeed, Wal-Mart does not argue that it failed to preserve the swing, just that its failure is excusable. The Court disagrees and finds that Wal-Mart's failure to preserve the swing is both inexcusable and strongly indicative of bad faith. Wal-Mart cannot abdicate itself of its duty to preserve the swing based on Manager's cursory inspection of the swing or Night Manager's purported ignorance of the incident. Night Manager's ignorance is both inconceivable given the extraordinariness of the situation, and dubious in light of her unexplained decision to discard the swing, rather than sell it, within a few weeks of Roberto's fall for something as superficial as worn paint.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-99\">\n   The surveillance video issue is a closer call. Manager's testimony was contradictory as to whether: (1) someone reviewed all of the relevant footage, (2) the footage review was completed and, (3) there is, or ever was, a backup copy of the footage somewhere, (a) why it was not retained or, (b) why it was not created. This confusion could support a conclusion of negligence or purposeful obfuscation. The Court is not willing to rule out the latter at this stage, particularly in light of the totality of the circumstances at hand. The fact that there are\n   <em>\n    three\n   </em>\n   categories of missing evidence at issue has somewhat of a \"synergistic effect.\"\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Blinzler\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7653688\" index=\"71\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/81/1148/#p1159\">\n    81 F.3d at 1159\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . The unavailability of so much evidence that was\n   exclusively in Wal-Mart's control, all of which bear upon the ultimate issue of what caused Roberto's fall, suggests that the unavailability results from \"something more than a coincidence.\"\n   <em>\n    See\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7653688\" index=\"72\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/81/1148/#p1159\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   (involving the allegedly routine destruction of two important documents central to plaintiff's case).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-100\">\n   The Court recognizes that Wal-Mart's rejoinders-that all of the evidence at issue either did not exist or was \"destroyed in the ordinary course of business, pursuant to routine practice\"-are material to the factfinder's inquiry.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Testa\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1306681\" index=\"73\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/144/173/#p177\">\n    144 F.3d at 177\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .
