Parks of Detroit, Michigan, with his passenger, Willie Davis. Both men were traveling from Detroit, Michigan.</p>\n<p id=\"b66-12\">That night Sgt. Gurwell of the Springfield Post of the Ohio State Highway Patrol, together with two other Highway Patrol officers, was working a drug interdiction program on Interstate 75 in Miami County, Ohio. At approximately 10:30 p.m., he noticed appellee\u2019s car apparently exceeding the speed limit, but he was unable to get a radar reading on the car. Sgt. Gurwell was heading north and, as the two automobiles passed, the sergeant noted that the license plate light in appellee\u2019s car was not working. The sergeant turned around and made a traffic stop of the appellee.</p>\n<p id=\"b67-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"35\">*35</page-number>The sergeant walked over to the appellee\u2019s car and ordered the appellee to leave the car and come back to the sergeant\u2019s patrol car. Davis stayed in the Buick. While at the driver\u2019s side of appellee\u2019s car, Sgt. Gurwell noted some fast-food wrappers inside the car, a toggle switch and loose wires hanging under the dash, a disconnected radar detector in the back seat, and some missing interior trim. Back in the patrol car, he determined by radio telephone the proper owner of the car appellee was driving and ascertained that it had not been listed as stolen and that there were no warrants for the arrest of the appellee, who was a properly licensed and insured driver.</p>\n<p id=\"b67-5\">Sgt. Gurwell then wrote out and issued the appellee a defect notification for the license plate violation. Then while in the patrol car, the sergeant began to question the appellee about his destination and reason for travel. The appellee stated that he was going to a funeral in Alabama but admitted that he did not know who the deceased was, when the funeral was, or exactly where the funeral was.</p>\n<p id=\"b67-6\">The following is from the transcript of the cross-examination of Sgt. Gurwell at the suppression hearing:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b67-7\">\u201cQ. Okay, the rest of the conversation you had with him had nothing to do with this equipment violation, did it? For example, I mean where he was going had nothing to do with the violation for which you were stopping him?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b67-8\">\u201cA. Right.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b67-9\">\u201cQ. Isn\u2019t that so?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b67-10\">\u201cA. Right.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b67-11\">\u201cQ. And were you asking him to be nosy or why?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b67-12\">\u201cA. I was asking him because that\u2019s what I\u2019m paid by the State of Ohio to do.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b67-13\">\u201cQ. Just to stop drivers and ask them where they are going?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b67-14\">\u201cA. Well, be inquisitive.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b67-15\">\u201cQ. So you\u2019re just being generally inquisitive?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b67-16\">\u201cA. Yes sir.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b67-17\">\u201cQ. And he didn\u2019t tell you anything that led you to believe that where he was going would \u2014 had anything criminal involved with it, isn\u2019t that so?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b67-18\">\u201cA. Other than he was very evasive and I felt he was not telling me the truth about where he was going.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b67-19\">\u201cQ. Okay. Well, being evasive is not against the law, is it?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b67-20\">\u201cA. No sir.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b67-21\">\u201cQ. And lying to you is not against the law either?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b68-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"36\">*36</page-number>\u201cA. Not for that, no sir.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b68-5\">\u201cQ. I think you said in your report that you then decided to search the car based upon statements given by the driver.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b68-6\">\u201cA. Okay, yes sir.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b68-7\">\u201cQ. That\u2019s in your report?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b68-8\">\u201cA. Yes sir.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b68-9\">The passenger, Davis, later gave a different reason for his travel south, but that was not known to Sgt. Gurwell at the time and had nothing to do with his decision to search the car.</p>\n<p id=\"b68-10\">After about ten or fifteen minutes of this questioning, Sgt. Gurwell testified that he told the appellee he was free to go, but this statement is contradicted by the testimony of the appellee himself.</p>\n<p id=\"b68-11\">The sergeant then asked the appellee if he could search the appellee\u2019s car. The sergeant testified that he handed the appellee the standard Highway Patrol\u2019s consent-to-search form, which the sergeant himself filled out. The sergeant testified that he read to the appellee the waiver at the bottom of the form, which states: \u201cI understand that I have the right to refuse the search described above and refuse to sign this form. I further state that no promises, threats, force, physical or mental coercion of any kind have been used against me to obtain consent to this search or to sign this form.\u201d The appellee apparently did sign the form and his signature is witnessed by another highway patrolman, who by this time had arrived at the scene also.</p>\n<p id=\"b68-12\">The appellee\u2019s version of this encounter regarding the consent form is as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b68-13\">\u201cQ. Okay, prior to your signing that document, did you have any discussion or conversation with Sergeant Gurwell?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b68-14\">\u201cA. Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b68-15\">\u201cQ. Could you tell us what that conversation was?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b68-16\">\u201cA. It was about the tail light defection was \u2014 mostly about the tail light defection, you know, and he was writing this out while he was \u2014 while we was talkin\u2019, and he was wantin\u2019 to know where I was goin\u2019.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b68-17\">\u201cQ. Could you speak up a little bit?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b68-18\">\u201cA He wanted to know where I was goin\u2019.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b68-19\">\u201cQ. All right, did he ask you to sign that consent?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b68-20\">\u201cA. Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b68-21\">\u201cQ. Did he indicate to you whether you had any options to sign that consent?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b69-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"37\">*37</page-number>\u201cA. Yes, he \u2014 he said that \u2014 well, I asked him because I didn\u2019t want \u2014 I\u2019m sayin\u2019 that first I asked him about it, did I have to sign consent, and he said that he \u2014 that I \u2014 I asked him what was my options, and he said if I didn\u2019t sign the consent, then he would have to \u2014 he\u2014well, he \u2014 they could either call the dogs out there or they can tow it into the station because the registration \u2014 I had the registration and insurance to the car, but he was threatenin\u2019 me with stolen car, you know.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b69-5\">\u201cQ. Uh-huh.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b69-6\">\u201cA. Which he found out that it weren\u2019t stolen, you know, and he was sayin\u2019, you know, he can tow the car in or he can bring the dog out. It would take \u2014 take him long \u2014 take me longer for me to do this than let him go over the car in two minutes. He said he\u2019d run over the car in two minutes and we\u2019d be gone.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b69-7\">\u201cQ. So he \u2014 did he \u2014 he indicated then that if you consented to that, you could be gone in a couple of minutes?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b69-8\">\u201cA. Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b69-9\">\u201cQ. Did he tell you prior to asking you to sign the consent that you would be free to go without signing the consent?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b69-10\">\u201cA. Did he tell me prior to that I was\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b69-11\">\u201cQ. Prior to signing the consent, did he state that you could leave without signing a consent?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b69-12\">\u201cA. No, he never stated that.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b69-13\">\u201cQ. Did he at any time tell you that you were free to go?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b69-14\">\u201cA. No.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b69-15\">$ *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b69-16\">\u201cQ. So Sergeant Gurwell did not tell you that you could leave?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b69-17\">\u201cA. No.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b69-18\">\u201cQ. After you signed the consent, did he say you could leave?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b69-19\">\u201cA. No.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b69-20\">\u201cQ. And he indicated to you then that unless you signed the consent you\u2019d have to wait there two hours for the dogs to come?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b69-21\">\u201cA. Well, I \u2014 he told me this was the options, you know, that I had, you know, either let him search the car, you know, \u2019cause I understand it right away \u2019cause, you know, he read it to me. And then I asked him did I have to sign it, you know, and he never did read the bottom part to me, you know. And he read it\u2014 he never said this was the consent form for me to sign to search the car. He never did read the bottom part to me.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b70-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"38\">*38</page-number>\u201cQ. All right, so you\u2019re saying that he did not read\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b70-5\">\u201cA. No, you know, that\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b70-6\">\u201cQ. \u2014the consent to you?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b70-7\">\u201cA. No, he never said that I had the right to refuse it. I said, well, do I have an option, you know, to \u2014 You know, do I have to, you know, let you do this, and he said, well, you do this like this or we do it this way. So, you know, I had to do it the way he wanted it did, you know * * *.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b70-8\">$ $</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b70-9\">\u201cQ. And he just simply told you that if you signed that, that he would search the car and take couple minutes and you could be on your way?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b70-10\">\u201cA. Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b70-11\">\u201cQ. The other option was we could tow the car in and have it searched or have some dogs search the car?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b70-12\">\u201cA. Uh-huh.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b70-13\">\u201cQ. This that [sic] the other option?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b70-14\">\u201cA. Right.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b70-15\">\u201cQ. And he didn\u2019t give you a third option of saying you didn\u2019t have to do either of the foregoing, you can be on your way?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b70-16\">\u201cA. No, he didn\u2019t say that.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b70-17\">\u201cQ. Okay.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b70-18\">\u201cA. No, \u2019cause he never said \u2014 he never read the bottom of it sayin\u2019 that I could refuse, you know, for him to search. He never read that to me.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b70-19\">\u201cQ. And in that context you signed?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b70-20\">\u201cA. Yes, I just \u2014 you know, I signed it because I was ready to go and he said it only takes \u2014 it\u2019s only gonna take two minutes for him to run through the car, you know. So I signed it, you know, instead of waitin\u2019 out there for two hours, which he said anyway, you know.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b70-21\">\u201cQ. So you signed it for two reasons; one, you didn\u2019t have anything to hide as far as you were concerned?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b70-22\">\u201cA. Right.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b70-23\">\u201cQ. And two, you thought they were gonna search the car anyway\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b70-24\">\u201cA. Uh-huh.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b70-25\">\u201cQ. \u2014and it was a matter of whether he did it then or they searched it later, is that a fair appraisal?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b71-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"39\">*39</page-number>\u201cA. Right.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b71-5\">\u201cQ. But you didn\u2019t know that you could just say, \u2018Look, I\u2019m out of here\u2019?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b71-6\">\u201cA. I didn\u2019t know that.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b71-7\">* <em>*</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b71-8\">\u201cQ. All right, and then he said you don\u2019t have to sign it, but if you don\u2019t, you\u2019re gonna be here for a couple of hours \u2019cause I\u2019m gonna call in some dogs?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b71-9\">\u201cA. I asked him, I say if \u2014 I say, \u2018What if I don\u2019t sign it?\u2019 I say, What if I don\u2019t sign it?\u2019 That what I asked him. What if I don\u2019t sign it, and he say well, I get \u2014 I get three options. He say you get \u2014 well, he said you got three options. He said you can either sign it, let me search it, or I can call the dogs out, or I can tow it into the station. This is what he told me.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b71-10\">\u201cQ. All right, and so then you opted to sign it?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b71-11\">\u201cA. Yeah, I wanted to sign it.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b71-12\">\u201cQ. All right. Now, \u2019cause he said it would only take two minutes?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b71-13\">\u201cA. That was \u2014 yeah, that was basically the reason I signed, you know, so fast, you know, because he said that it was only gonna take two minutes. I would have probably read it, you know.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b71-14\">The sergeant then proceeded to search the car and found approximately two thousand grams of cocaine. The patrol also found a gun in the car after they had towed it back to the Highway Patrol post. In addition, a minute quantity of marijuana was found on passenger Davis. Both the appellee and passenger Davis were then arrested and were read their <em>Miranda </em>rights and taken back to the Piqua post of the Ohio State Highway Patrol where written statements were taken from each.</p>\n<p id=\"b71-15\">The sergeant testified at the suppression hearing that it was the things that he had seen in the car, namely some loose wires under the dash, a toggle switch, an unconnected radar detector, fast-food wrappers and some missing trim pieces in the interior, that had aroused his suspicion. He testified that while each one of these items could be consistent with a drug violation, they were also consistent with purely innocent behavior. For example, as to the fast-food wrappers, he testified that this is consistent with a drug violation because \u201cpeople don\u2019t want to leave the vehicle for any reason.\u201d He further testified that it was suspicious that the vehicle was traveling from Detroit, which \u201cis a source city for cocaine.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b71-16\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b71-17\">There is no issue here about the initial traffic stop. The stopping officer obviously had reasonable cause, based upon his own observation of the missing <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"40\">*40</page-number>light on the license plate, to stop the car and issue its driver a defect-notification form.</p>\n<p id=\"b72-5\">In order to continue holding the appellee and initiating a valid search of his vehicle, the stopping officer must have \u201cspecific and articulable facts that further detention was reasonable.\u201d <em>State v. Hart </em>(1988), 61 Ohio App.3d 37, 41, 572 N.E.2d 141, 144; see, also, <em>State v. Chatton </em>(1984), 11 Ohio St.3d 59, 11 OBR 250, 463 N.E.2d 1237, \u201cin which the Ohio Supreme Court held that a police officer, who detained an individual for a suspected traffic violation, does not have authority to further detain that individual to determine the validity of his driver\u2019s license once the officer no longer has reason to suspect that individual is committing a traffic violation, absent some specific and articulable facts that detention was reasonable.\u201d <em>State v. Hart, supra, </em>61 Ohio App.3d at 41, 572 N.E.2d at 144.</p>\n<p id=\"b72-6\">The state attempts to distinguish <em>Chatton </em>on the grounds that there the officer detained the defendant beyond a reasonable time after he had ascertained that the initial reason for the stop was no longer in issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b72-7\"><em>Chatton </em>is very much on point, however, since the question both here and in <em>Chatton </em>was, did the stopping officer have specific and articulable facts to reasonably justify detaining the driver of the vehicle after the issue which led to the stop had been resolved? In this case, the resolution was the issuance of the defect notification to the appellee.</p>\n<p id=\"b72-8\">The evidence shows that here the stopping officer detained the appellee in the patrol car for ten or fifteen minutes, during which he inquired in detail as to the appellee\u2019s destination and reasons for the trip. The appellee\u2019s vague and less than definitive answers undoubtedly fueled the officer\u2019s suspicions, but as this court stated in <em>State v. Carter </em>(Feb. 4, 1993), Montgomery App. No. 13628, unreported at 15, 1993 WL 24777, in an opinion by Judge Brogan: \u201cAn officer\u2019s inarticulate hunch will not provide a sufficient basis for an investigative stop.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b72-9\">The only other facts the officer mentioned as grounds for his search were the hanging toggle switch, the loose fast-food wrappers, the unconnected radar detector, and some missing trim in the interior of the car. These may be articulable facts but they certainly do not provide reasonable grounds for conducting the search. If fast-food wrappers and a radar detector in a vehicle can justify a search of it, then we are all at risk.</p>\n<p id=\"b72-10\">What we have here, obviously, is a so-called \u201cprofile case\u201d where an investigating officer notes some facts which are among a number of indicia often found in the profile of a typical drug courier or dealer. If the facts cited by the officer in this case are sufficient grounds to justify a search of the vehicle, then any late-model car being driven from Detroit by one or two young men, with a radar <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"41\">*41</page-number>detector, some fast-food wrappers, and a hanging toggle switch in it, together with a little bit of missing trim, is subject to a stop-and-search action. The net would be cast too far in such a case. A small set of individual facts, each one innocent in itself, does not necessarily add up to reasonable grounds for a search when taken together, at least under the circumstances of this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b73-5\">We agree with the trial court that the stopping officer indeed lacked specific and articulable facts to reasonably justify detaining the appellee after the defect notification had been issued. <em>Columbus v. Watson </em>(1989), 64 Ohio App.3d 6, 580 N.E.2d 494.</p>\n<p id=\"b73-6\">The state of course would validate this search on the grounds that a valid consent was obtained for it. It is settled law that where the validity of a search rests on consent, the state has the burden of proving that the necessary consent was obtained and that it was freely and voluntarily given, a burden that is not satisfied by showing a mere submission to a claim of lawful authority. <em>Florida v. Royer </em>(1983), 460 U.S. 491, 103 S.Ct. 1319, 75 L.Ed.2d 229; <em>Schneckloth v. Bustamonte </em>(1973), 412 U.S. 218, 93 S.Ct. 2041, 36 L.Ed.2d 854.</p>\n<p id=\"b73-7\">In <em>Schneckloth </em>the United States Supreme Court dealt at length with the issue of the voluntariness of a consent and held that the question of whether a consent to a search is in fact voluntary or is the product of duress or coercion, express or implied, is a question of fact to be determined from the totality of all the circumstances. The court there stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b73-8\">\u201cBut the Fourth and Fourteenth Amendments require that a consent not be coerced, by explicit or implicit means, by implied threat or covert force. For, no matter how subtly the coercion was applied, the resulting \u2018consent\u2019 would be no more than a pretext for the unjustified police intrusion against which the Fourth Amendment is directed.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b73-9\">\u00ab\u2021 * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b73-10\">\u201cIn examining all the surrounding circumstances to determine if in fact the consent to search was coerced, account must be taken of subtly coercive police questions, as well as the possibly vulnerable subjective state of the person who consents. Those searches that are the product of police coercion can thus be filtered out without undermining the continuing validity of consent searches. In sum, there is no reason for us to depart in the area of consent searches, from the traditional definition of \u2018voluntariness.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>at 228-229, 93 S.Ct. at 2048-2049, 36 L.Ed.2d at 863-864.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b73-11\">In the case at hand, there is sufficient testimony in the record, if believed, to support the conclusion that the appellee felt himself constrained to sign the consent form in the expectation that by doing so he would be back on the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"42\">*42</page-number>road and free again in just a few minutes. He was led to believe, apparently, that if he did not sign, the Highway Patrol would conduct a search anyway, after a wait of about two hours, whether or not dogs were involved. There was also sufficient testimony, if believed, to support the conclusion that the appellee did not feel that he was free to go and was in a subtly threatening situation. Credibility of witnesses is in the domain of the trial court. We shall not and should not attempt to second-guess it. The trial court found that the state did not meet its burden of proving that the consent to search was intelligently, freely and voluntarily given. <em>Bumper v. North Carolina </em>(1968), 391 U.S. 543, 88 S.Ct. 1788, 20 L.Ed.2d 797; <em>Florida v. Royer, supra.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b74-5\">The state cites for authority to justify its search in this case the decision of the Ohio Supreme Court in <em>State v. Comen </em>(1990), 50 Ohio St.3d 206, 553 N.E.2d 640. The facts in <em>Comen, </em>however, do not indicate the same kind of subtly coercive situation which the trial court found in the case at hand. In the <em>Comen </em>case, moreover, the police found several specific and articulable facts which would more than reasonably justify the stop and search there.</p>\n<p id=\"b74-6\"><em>Florida v. Jimeno </em>(1991), 500 U.S. -, 111 S.Ct. 1801, 114 L.Ed.2d 297, also relied upon by the state, was not a case concerning validity of consent but rather focused on the reasonableness of the scope of consent. The question there was whether the freely given consent conferred a right on the searching officer to open a closed container found in the car.</p>\n<p id=\"b74-8\"><em>State v. Cooper </em>(1989), 61 Ohio App.3d 344, 572 N.E.2d 790, also cited by the state, merely involved an officer stopping the defendant and asking for his identity and some identification. Clearly, that is not a violation of an individual\u2019s Fourth Amendment rights and has no bearing on the case at hand.</p>\n<p id=\"b74-9\">Finally, the state refers to <em>State v. Moon </em>(Feb. 14, 1986), Montgomery App. No. 9288, unreported, 1986 WL 2368, where this court found a voluntary consent was freely given. But there the holding by this court was supported by <em>uncontradicted </em>testimony by the police officer in the trial court. That is certainly not the situation with the present case, and we repeat that the resolution of conflicts in testimony is a matter of credibility and for the trial court to determine.</p>\n<p id=\"b74-10\">We are extremely sympathetic and in complete support of the often heroic efforts by our law enforcement officials to stem and if possible turn back the tide of illicit drugs which seems to be flooding our streets and neighborhoods, but, as the United States Supreme Court recently stated in <em>Florida v. Bostick </em>(1991), 501 U.S. -, -, 111 S.Ct. 2382, 2389, 115 L.Ed.2d 389, 401, we are \u201cnot empowered to suspend constitutional guarantees so that the Government may more effectively wage a \u2018war on drugs.\u2019 * * * If that war is to be fought, those <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"43\">*43</page-number>who fight must respect the rights of individuals, whether or not those individuals are suspected of having committed a crime.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b75-5\">We reject the assignment of error and affirm the judgment of the trial court.</p>\n<p id=\"b75-6\">\n<em>Judgment affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b75-7\">Grady, P.J., and Wolff, J., concur.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
