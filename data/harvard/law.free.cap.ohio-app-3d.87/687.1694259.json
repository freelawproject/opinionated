P\u00e9cora, appeals his conviction of felonious assault, R.C. 2903.11, with a firearm specification, R.C. 2941.141. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b721-6\">Pecora\u2019s conviction results from an incident on April 21, 1992. In the early morning, P\u00e9cora was alerted by a neighbor that two people were behaving suspiciously on his property. P\u00e9cora picked up his .38 caliber revolver and went outside. Once there, he noticed two men in the process of breaking into his son's car. P\u00e9cora testified that he told the suspects to \u201chold it right there,\u201d but the suspects began moving toward him. As they were advancing, P\u00e9cora claims to have fired two warning shots away from the men who then ran down the street into a nearby park. P\u00e9cora and his son gave chase. P\u00e9cora later identified the suspects as one white and one black male.</p>\n<p id=\"b721-7\">Carolyn Paden and Phillip Warner were also in this park. They heard the gunshots fired by P\u00e9cora and decided to leave. While pulling out of the park, Warner saw P\u00e9cora and his son. Warner observed that P\u00e9cora, who was running in the middle of the road, had a gun. Warner testified that, P\u00e9cora, who was now standing beside the car, fired two shots into the door of the driver\u2019s side of the vehicle. Warner \u201cfloored it\u201d and left the scene. Later, Warner stopped and found bullet holes in the driver\u2019s side door. He then reported this incident to the police.</p>\n<p id=\"b721-8\">P\u00e9cora was indicted on two counts of felonious assault with two counts of firearm specifications and two counts of physical harm specifications. The jury returned a verdict of guilty to one charge of felonious assault and one firearm specification. P\u00e9cora was acquitted of the remaining charges. He appeals from the trial court\u2019s decision, raising two assignments of error.</p>\n<p id=\"b721-9\">Assignment of Error No. I</p>\n<p id=\"b721-10\">\u201cThe trial court erred, and to the prejudice of appellant 1) by giving an erroneous instruction on the defense of citizen arrest, 2) by refusing to instruct the jury on the defense of mistake of fact, 3) by refusing to instruct the jury that an automobile may be used as a deadly weapon, and 4) by giving an erroneous instruction with regard to the use of force in effecting a citizen arrest for robbery.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b721-11\">P\u00e9cora raises several errors in the jury instructions. P\u00e9cora first argues that the trial court gave conflicting instructions on the issue of a citizen\u2019s arrest. While P\u00e9cora acknowledges the court gave the correct instruction at one point, he alleges the court later gave a contradictory instruction. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b721-12\">Initially, the court gave the elements necessary for a citizen\u2019s arrest with an explanation of each of these elements. This is the instruction P\u00e9cora admits was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"690\">*690</page-number>proper. Later, the court outlined the elements without any explanation. The court did not contradict itself by reviewing the instructions without the explanation.</p>\n<p id=\"b722-5\">Assuming <em>arguendo </em>the court erred in its instruction on citizen\u2019s arrest, P\u00e9cora could not successfully avail himself of this defense. He maintains that he was entitled to use deadly force in effectuating this arrest. As the United States Supreme Court has stated, the use of deadly force to prevent the escape of a suspected felon is prohibited unless it is necessary to prevent the escape and the officer has probable cause to believe that the suspect poses a significant threat of death or physical injury to the officer or others. <em>Tennessee v. Garner </em>(1985), 471 U.S. 1, 11, 105 S.Ct. 1694, 1701, 85 L.Ed.2d 1, 10. <em>Gamer </em>involved a police officer\u2019s right to use deadly force when arresting a breaking and entering suspect. The rights of a private citizen to use deadly force are no greater than those of a police officer. In this case, P\u00e9cora was confronted with two individuals breaking into his son\u2019s car. He had no authority, based on an attempted citizen\u2019s arrest, to use deadly force to apprehend these men. Therefore, he lacked authority to shoot the individuals in the automobile that he apparently mistook as fleeing thieves.</p>\n<p id=\"b722-6\">P\u00e9cora also alleges that the court erred in failing to instruct on mistake of fact. Ignorance or mistake of fact is a defense if it negates a mental state required to establish an element of a crime, except that if the defendant would be guilty of a crime under the facts as he believed them, then he may be convicted of that offense. P\u00e9cora would be guilty even if the situation were as he believed. LaFave, Criminal Law (2d Ed.1986) 405, Section 5.1. See, generally, 25 Ohio Jurisprudence 3d (1981) 167, Criminal Law, Section 62.</p>\n<p id=\"b722-7\">The court\u2019s instructions to the jury must be based on the actual issues in the case as presented by the evidence. <em>State v. Rogers </em>(1975), 43 Ohio St.2d 28, 72 O.O.2d 16, 330 N.E.2d 674, certiorari denied (1976), 423 U.S. 1061, 96 S.Ct. 801, 46 L.Ed.2d 653; <em>State v. Guster </em>(1981), 66 Ohio St.2d 266, 271, 20 O.O.3d 249, 252, 421 N.E.2d 157, 160. A court need not give an instruction unless it applies to the facts in the case. <em>Id. </em>P\u00e9cora asserts that an instruction was warranted as to mistake of fact because he shot at the vehicle due to his mistaken belief it was occupied by the suspected criminals. As we have previously stated, he had no authority to use deadly force to effectuate a citizen\u2019s arrest. Thus, as a matter of law his citizen\u2019s arrest defense must fail even if the facts were as he mistakenly believed.</p>\n<p id=\"b722-8\">Further, P\u00e9cora asserts that his actions were justified because he mistakenly believed the individuals in the vehicle were attempting to \u201crun him over.\u201d Assuming this is true, P\u00e9cora was not justified in firing at the car when it was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"691\">*691</page-number>passing him. Pecora compares this case to <em>State v. Foster </em>(1979), 60 Ohio Misc. 46, 14 O.O.3d 144, 396 N.E.2d 246. In <em>Foster, </em>the defendant was directly in the path of an automobile. Thus, the car was a deadly weapon. Here, P\u00e9cora was under no such threat. Rather, the evidence shows the car had already passed him. His mistake-of-fact defense was not available as he had no justification for firing at the passing car.</p>\n<p id=\"b723-5\">In summation, the court correctly instructed the jury on the elements of a citizen\u2019s arrest and the use of deadly force. The trial court was not required to instruct the jury on mistake of fact as P\u00e9cora could not have been excused of felonious assault even if the facts were as he believed. Pecora\u2019s first assignment of error is overruled.</p>\n<p id=\"b723-6\">Assignment of Error No. II</p>\n<p id=\"b723-7\">\u201cThe trial court committed plain error in failing to admonish the prosecutor, and in failing to give a curative instruction to the jury, despite repeated attempts by the prosecutor during the questioning of appellant and other witnesses, as well as in the prosecutor\u2019s closing arguments, to impress the jury that appellant\u2019s actions were motivated by prejudice against blacks where 1) there was no evidence that this motive existed and 2) appellant\u2019s initial objection to this course of conduct was sustained.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b723-8\">As P\u00e9cora correctly notes, we can only reverse the court\u2019s decision if we find its actions to be plain error because P\u00e9cora did not object to these statements at trial. In criminal cases, plain error is governed by Crim.R. 52(B) which states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b723-9\">\u201cPlain errors or defects affecting substantial rights may be noticed although they were not brought to the attention of the court.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b723-10\">The Supreme Court has repeatedly admonished that this exception to the general rule is to be invoked reluctantly.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b723-11\">\u201cNotice of plain error under Crim.R. 52(B) is to be taken with the utmost caution, under exceptional circumstances and only to prevent a manifest miscarriage of justice.\u201d <em>State v. Long </em>(1978), 53 Ohio St.2d 91, 7 O.O.3d 178, 372 N.E.2d 804, paragraph three of the syllabus. See, also, <em>State v. Thompson </em>(1987), 33 Ohio St.3d 1, 10, 514 N.E.2d 407, 416.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b723-12\">In this case, the race of the people who broke into Pecora\u2019s son\u2019s automobile and the race of the person who was driving out of the park were in issue. P\u00e9cora identified one person in his driveway as white and one as black. However, it was later discovered that both these people were white. Phillip Warner, the driver of the automobile fired upon, was black. The existence of Pecora\u2019s belief that Warner was one of the individuals in his driveway was an issue in this case. After reviewing the alleged statements, we find that the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"692\">*692</page-number>references to race were to bring this factual matter to the jury\u2019s attention and allow it to consider the reasonableness of Pecora\u2019s claimed belief that Warner was one of the suspected criminals. Pecora\u2019s second assignment is without merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b724-5\">The trial court\u2019s judgment is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b724-6\">\n<em>Judgment affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b724-7\">Cook, P.J., and Dickinson, J., concur.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
