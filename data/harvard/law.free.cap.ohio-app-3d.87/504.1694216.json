Ward, Administrator of the Estate of Montay Sibert.</p>\n<p id=\"b538-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"506\">*506</page-number>We conclude that R.C. 2117.06(A)(1) is satisfied by a computer-generated billing statement that (1) clearly indicates the creditor\u2019s name, address, and the precise amount of the obligation due; (2) identifies the decedent as the debtor; and (3) that is timely received by the administrator of the decedent\u2019s estate. We find that Ward is not entitled to judgment as a matter of law; accordingly, we reverse the judgment of the trial court and remand this cause for further proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b538-5\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b538-6\">Ward was appointed Administrator of the Estate of Montay Sibert on May 8, 1990. Montay died on April 25, 1990.</p>\n<p id=\"b538-7\">Ward averred that after Montay\u2019s death, in May 1990, she received three computer-generated billing statements from CMC. The record shows that these billing statements included CMC\u2019s name, address, the amount due, indicated the patient\u2019s name as \u201cMontay Sibert,\u201d and indicated the \u201cResponsible Party\u201d as Tammy Ward. Ward further averred that during Montay\u2019s life, she regularly received these billing statements and would routinely forward them \u201cdirectly to the guardian of Montay Sibert\u2019s estate for payment.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b538-8\">The amounts due on the three bills were $43,000, $9,000, and $6,843.69. Ward averred that Montay Sibert had been treated extensively by CMC since his birth for various medical conditions, and she characterized CMC\u2019s past billing statements as \u201cstatements for medical services.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b538-9\">Ward also averred that \u201cshortly after his death,\u201d she had notified employees of CMC that Montay had died. There is no evidence of <em>written </em>notification to CMC of either Montay Sibert\u2019s death or the appointment of an executor for his estate.</p>\n<p id=\"b538-10\">CMC brought an action against Ward, as the Administrator of the Estate of Montay Sibert, seeking payment of the three bills at issue. Ward filed a counterclaim of wrongful death and medical malpractice against CMC and Valerie A. Woodmansee, D.O. The counterclaim is not material to this appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b538-11\">The trial court found that \u201cTammy Ward reported the death of Montay Sibert to employees of The Children\u2019s Medical Center.\u201d The trial court also stated, in its order sustaining Ward\u2019s motion for summary judgment, that \u201c[t]here is no evidence before the Court that the plaintiff sent any bills to Tammy Ward after the death of Montay Sibert other than the bills in May and June of 1990.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b538-12\">The trial court held that the three computer-generated billing statements did not constitute proper presentment of claims against an estate under R.C. 2117.06, and that \u201c[t]he complaint does not state that claims were presented to Tammy Ward, as Administratrix of the Estate of Montay Sibert, and that the Administra<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"507\">*507</page-number>trix rejected the claims. These representations are crucial to the filing of a complaint by a creditor against the fiduciary of a deceased\u2019s estate.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b539-5\">From the judgment of the trial court, CMC appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b539-6\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b539-7\">CMC\u2019s sole assignment of error is as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b539-8\">\u201cThe trial court erred in granting summary judgment to the defendant administratrix, in regard to claims made against an estate, on the basis of improper presentment of claim, where the evidence before the court established that the administratrix received actual notice of the claims in writing prior to the filing of suit, and within the time limits imposed by statute.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b539-9\">As a threshold issue, we must determine whether the trial court was correct in observing that CMC\u2019s complaint was fatally flawed for failing to state that the claims were presented to Ward, as Administrator of the Estate of Montay Sibert, and that the administrator rejected the claims. Rejection by an administrator has been held to be a condition precedent to bringing an action on a claim. <em>Morgan v. City Natl. Bank &amp; Trust Co. of Columbus </em>(1964), 4 Ohio App.2d 417, 33 O.O.2d 504, 212 N.E.2d 822. A non-response by an administrator cannot be considered a rejection under R.C. 2117.06(D) because a non-response does not prevent an executor from later either rejecting or allowing the claim. R.C. 2117.06(D) provides, in pertinent part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b539-10\">\u201cIn the absence of any prior demand for allowance, the executor or administrator shall allow or reject all claims * * * within thirty days after their presentation, provided that failure of the executor or administrator to allow or reject within that time shall not prevent him from doing so after that time and shall not prejudice the rights of any claimant.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b539-11\">R.C. 2117.06(H) provides, in pertinent part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b539-12\">\u201cAny person whose claim has been presented, and not thereafter rejected, is a creditor as that term is used in Chapters 2113. to 2125. of the Revised Code.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b539-13\">It is doubtful that an executor can both reject and allow the same claim. Therefore, a challenge to the form of a presentment must be considered a rejection, at least by implication. There is no reason to consider an implicit rejection to be anything but a final rejection because an executor has no affirmative duty to notify a potential claimant that a submitted bill is improperly presented. Generally, it is the responsibility of the claimant to ascertain who and where the executor is, and executors or legal representatives of the estate have no duty under R.C. 2117.06 to advise potential claimants on the procedure for <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"508\">*508</page-number>properly presenting a claim. 33 Ohio Jurisprudence 3d (1982) 460, Decedent\u2019s Estates, Section 1552.</p>\n<p id=\"b540-4\">Silence by an executor, in response to a submitted bill, does not save an improperly presented claim from being time-barred. On the other hand, if the claim is properly presented, silence by an executor should not bar the claimant from joining the class of creditors of the estate, or prevent the creditor from suing on the claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b540-5\">Additionally, as one Ohio court has commented, \u201c[f]or obvious reasons, a fiduciary should not be permitted to accept a claim within the statutory period, hold it indefinitely, and then raise the statute of limitations as a defense because of some claimed defect in its form.\u201d <em>Gladman v. Carns </em>(1964), 9 Ohio App.2d 135, 138, 38 O.O.2d 149, 152, 223 N.E.2d 378, 381.</p>\n<p id=\"b540-6\">We conclude that an executor with actual knowledge of a legitimate debt of the estate, who personally receives a proper statement of that debt under R.C. 2117.06(A) and does not accept the claim within the thirty-day time period prescribed by R.C. 2117.06(D), effects a constructive rejection of the claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b540-7\">R.C. 2117.06(D) provides that if the executor does nothing with a properly presented claim, the rights of the creditor cannot be prejudiced by executor inaction. Therefore, we reject the trial court\u2019s contention that CMC\u2019s suit was not properly brought.</p>\n<p id=\"b540-8\">Another ancillary issue, raised by CMC, is whether CMC received sufficient notice of the decedent\u2019s death and whether a lack of written notice to CMC would either extend the statutory presentment period, or revive the claim. We do not reach this issue here because we find that the claim was properly presented.</p>\n<p id=\"b540-9\">Ward is entitled to summary judgment only if she can establish, through evidentiary material permitted by Civ.R. 56(C), that there is no genuine issue as to any material fact, that she is entitled to judgment as a matter of law, and that it appears from the evidence before the trial court that reasonable minds could come to but one conclusion and that conclusion is adverse to CMC, the nonmoving party, who is entitled to have the evidence construed most strongly in its favor. <em>Harless v. Willis Day Warehousing Co. </em>(1978), 54 Ohio St.2d 64, 8 O.O.3d 73, 375 N.E.2d 46.</p>\n<p id=\"b540-10\">The standard of review in this court is <em>de novo, </em>since the propriety of summary judgment is a question of law. We must determine whether the moving party, Ward, has sustained her burden by establishing that there is no genuine issue of material fact. <em>AAAA Enterprises, Inc. v. River Place Community Urban Redev. Corp. </em>(1990), 50 Ohio St.3d 157, 553 N.E.2d 597.</p>\n<p id=\"b540-11\">R.C. 2117.06(A) requires, in pertinent part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b541-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"509\">*509</page-number>\u201cAll creditors having claims against an estate * * * shall present their claims in one of the following manners:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b541-5\">\u201c(1) To the executor or administrator in a writing;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b541-6\">U * * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b541-7\">\u201c(3) In a writing that is sent by ordinary mail addressed to the decedent and that is actually received by the executor or administrator within the appropriate time specified in division (B) of this section. * * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b541-8\">\u201c(B) All claims shall be presented within one year after the death of the decedent * * *.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b541-9\">The time requirement of R.C. 2117.06 is mandatory.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> <em>Prudential Ins. Co. of Am. v. Joyce Bldg. Realty Co. </em>(1944), 143 Ohio St. 564, 28 O.O. 480, 56 N.E.2d 168.</p>\n<p id=\"b541-10\">The Ohio Supreme Court has further recognized that:</p>\n<p id=\"b541-11\">\u201cThe purpose and object of the law requiring the presentation of claims against an estate to the executor or administrator is manifestly to secure an expeditious and efficient administration of an estate by promptly providing such a fiduciary with the necessary information relating to the existence, amount and character of all indebtedness of the estate.\u201d <em>Fortelka v. Meifert </em>(1964), 176 Ohio St. 476, 479, 27 O.O.2d 439, 441-442, 200 N.E.2d 318, 321.</p>\n<p id=\"b541-12\">In <em>Fortelka, </em>the Ohio Supreme Court recognized that the method of presentment contemplated by R.C. 2117.06 does not preclude \u201canother equally efficient method for the presentation of claims\u201d and held that the timely filing of an action against the estate of the administrator\u2019s decedent, with proper service, constitu\u00ed ed a valid presentation meeting R.C. 2117.06.</p>\n<p id=\"b541-13\">This court has previously agreed with <em>Fortelka </em>in <em>Peoples Natl. Bank v. Treon </em>(1984), 16 Ohio App.3d 410, 411, 16 OBR 480, 481, 476 N.E.2d 372, 373. In <em>Treon, </em>the claim against the estate was presented to the attorney appointed by the estate\u2019s executor. The claim was captioned \u201cClaim against Estate,\u201d and was addressed to the attorney \u201cfor the Estate of ...,\u201d and we held that a claim against an estate is properly presented where the claim is presented to the attorney appointed by the executor of the estate to represent her in the administration of the estate, despite the fact that the executor did not receive notice of the claim until after the time allowed by R.C. 2117.06.</p>\n<p id=\"b541-14\">While Ohio law is strict on the time and notice elements of presentment, the form of the presentment has been less rigidly considered. In meeting one of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"510\">*510</page-number>three requirements of R.C. 2117.06(A), \u201c \u2018[a] claim against a decedent\u2019s estate need not be in any particular form; it is sufficient if it states the character and amount of the claim, enables the representatives to provide for its payment, and serves to bar all other claims by reason of its particularity of designation.\u2019\u201d <em>Carns, supra, </em>9 Ohio App.2d at 138, 38 O.O.2d at 151, 223 N.E.2d at 381.</p>\n<p id=\"b542-5\">We agree that R.C. 2117.06(A)(1) imposes no strict form requirements on presentment of claims. Claims need only be \u201cin a writing\u201d and \u201cpresented\u201d to the \u201cexecutor or administrator\u201d within the statutory time in R.C. 2117.06(B). The evidence here shows that CMC sent the bills within three months after the decedent\u2019s death, the statutory time of R.C. 2117.06(B) prior to its amendment in 1990, and that the bills were writings and were received by the administrator.</p>\n<p id=\"b542-6\">Of further significance is the fact that Ward knew of the decedent\u2019s debts to CMC, and that the billing statements included the name and address of the creditor, the name of the decedent debtor, the name of the administrator, and the precise amounts due. This information satisfies the particularity and efficiency requirements of <em>Fortelka </em>and <em>Carns, supra, </em>and comports with the nature and purpose of R.C. 2117.06: both to facilitate the prompt administration of estates and to bar claimants who, through indifference, carelessness, or a dilatory attitude, fail to make an effort to file their claims on time. 33 Ohio Jurisprudence 3d (1982) 465, Decedent\u2019s Estates, Section 1558.</p>\n<p id=\"b542-7\">We find CMC\u2019s presentment valid under R.C. 2117.06(A)(1) because the claim was timely sent, in a writing, to the administrator, and because under all of the prevailing circumstances, the notice to the administrator in her personal capacity constituted notice to the administrator in her capacity as fiduciary of the estate. She could not have been unaware of CMC\u2019s intention to seek payment from the decedent\u2019s estate.</p>\n<p id=\"b542-8\">Because the form of presentment was adequate under the statute, no genuine issue as to any material fact remains. Construing the evidence most strongly in favor of CMC, the nonmoving party, we find that Ward is not entitled to judgment as a matter of law.</p>\n<p id=\"b542-9\">CMC\u2019s sole assignment of error is sustained.</p>\n<p id=\"b542-10\">Ill</p>\n<p id=\"b542-11\">CMC\u2019s sole assignment of error having been sustained, the judgment of the trial court is reversed, and this cause is remanded for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b542-12\">\n<em>Judgment reversed and cause remanded.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b542-13\">Brogan and Wolff, JJ., concur.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b541-15\">. At the time of Montay Sibert's death, R.C. 2117.06(B) required that all claims be presented within three months after the death of the decedent. Because CMC sent the bills in question within three months of the decedent\u2019s death, there is no need to consider which version of the statute to apply.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
