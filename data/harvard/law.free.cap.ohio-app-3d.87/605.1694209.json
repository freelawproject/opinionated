Appellant alleged in his complaint that \u201cthe defendant proceeded to conduct the course of activity through the operation of road moving equipment moving dirt and earth and trees <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"607\">*607</page-number>and vegetation and by the operation of the equipment which caused a nuisance; that the defendants were also careless and negligent in their operations.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b639-5\">Valley View filed a motion for summary judgment asserting that appellant had failed to allege any negligence on the part of the village. Even if appellant had alleged facts to constitute an action against the village, Valley View argued that it would be immune under R.C. Chapter 2744, the Political Subdivision Tort Liability Act. The trial court granted Valley View\u2019s motion for summary judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b639-6\">Bohning filed a motion for summary judgment, also relying on the defense on nonliability under R.C. Chapter 2744. Bohning\u2019s motion was granted by the trial court.</p>\n<p id=\"b639-7\">Target filed its motion for summary judgment asserting the defense that it was not hable as a general contractor for the negligence, if any, of its subcontractor. Target also asserted that appellant had not alleged any real damage. The trial court granted Target\u2019s motion, as well.</p>\n<p id=\"b639-8\">Appellant admitted in his deposition testimony that he had bought the property in 1985 at a cost of $71,000 knowing that it was zoned for commercial development. An appraisal in 1989 indicated that the property\u2019s value had increased to $400,000. Appellant\u2019s complaint cites as damages to his property the excessive flooding, noise and dust. In the affidavit attached to appellant\u2019s brief in opposition to the motion for summary judgment, he also alleged that his property had sustained numerous cracks to the roof, walls and foundation.</p>\n<p id=\"b639-9\">Appellant appeals from each of the trial court\u2019s decisions to grant the respective appellees\u2019 motions for summary judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b639-10\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b639-11\">\u201cThe court committed prejudicial error in granting summary judgment to the defendant, Target Builders, as there were genuine issues of material fact which precluded the grant of a summary judgment.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b639-12\">Appellant argues that genuine issues of material fact exist as to his damages and as to Target\u2019s liability as a general contractor. The latter argument is without merit in that the issue is one of law and not of fact. However, appellant\u2019s first assertion is well taken.</p>\n<p id=\"b639-13\">\u201cSummary judgment shall be rendered forthwith if the pleading, depositions, answers to interrogatories, written admissions, affidavits, transcripts of evidence in the pending case, and written stipulations of fact, if any, timely filed in the action, show that there is no genuine issue as to any material fact and that the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.\u201d Civ.R. 56(C).</p>\n<p id=\"b640-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"608\">*608</page-number>A genuine dispute as to appellant\u2019s injuries exists, rendering summary judgment inappropriate.</p>\n<p id=\"b640-4\">Appellant\u2019s complaint alleged injuries which he asserted were proximately caused by defendant\u2019s negligence. Appellant argues that due to the failure of the excavation crew to adhere to the conditions of the permit granted by the village, his property has sustained damage. Appellant kept a record of his problems on wall calendars for the years 1988 and 1989. At various times he experienced excessive amounts of dust from the excavation project. At other times his yard was subject to flooding from the crew\u2019s failure to provide sediment barriers to prevent runoff, as required by the permit. His calendars also made note of the days on which heavy equipment was running at hours outside those permitted by the village.</p>\n<p id=\"b640-5\">Target alleges that appellant\u2019s water problem pre-existed its excavation work and, further, that appellant should expect a certain amount of noise and dust when living in an area zoned for commercial usage. A genuine issue of material fact exists as to whether the water problem was caused by or greatly exacerbated by Target\u2019s negligence and whether the amount of dust and noise exceeded that to be normally expected in a commercially zoned district.</p>\n<p id=\"b640-6\">As to Target\u2019s liability as a general contractor for the negligence of its subcontractor, the law in Ohio holds that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b640-7\">\u201cWhere danger to others is likely to attend the doing of certain work, unless care is observed, the person having it to do, is under a duty to see that it is done with reasonable care, and cannot, by the employment of an independent contractor, relieve himself from liability for injuries resulting to others from the negligence of the contractor or his servants.\u201d <em>Richman Bros. v. Miller </em>(1936), 131 Ohio St. 424, 6 O.O. 119, 3 N.E.2d 360, at paragraph one of the syllabus; <em>Covington &amp; Cincinnati Bridge Co. v. Steinbock &amp; Patrick </em>(1899), 61 Ohio St. 215, 55 N.E. 618, at paragraph one of the syllabus. See, also, <em>S. Ohio RR. Co. v. Morey </em>(1890), 47 Ohio St. 207, 24 N.E. 269, at paragraph three of the syllabus.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b640-8\">It is clear from the line of cases cited by the Ohio Supreme Court in <em>Richman </em>and <em>Covington </em>that excavation work is precisely the type of activity meant to be excepted from the general rule of nonliability as to the general contractor for a subcontractor\u2019s negligence. Target took on a project which was inherently dangerous to other persons and property if not done with reasonable care. The village\u2019s permit specified the precautions to be taken by the excavators in order to prevent damage to the adjacent property. It is unclear from any of the submitted briefs, attached affidavits or appellant\u2019s deposition whether Target or its subcontractor followed the conditions set by the village\u2019s permit. This is an issue of fact which would necessarily be determined upon remand to the trial <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"609\">*609</page-number>court. Under the law, Target is not immune from the liability of its subcontractor\u2019s negligence if it stemmed directly from the excavating work, as appellant alleges. See <em>S. Ohio RR. Co. v. Morey, supra.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b641-5\">Appellant\u2019s first assignment of error is sustained.</p>\n<p id=\"b641-6\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b641-7\">\u201cThe court committed prejudicial error in granting summary judgment to the defendant, Donald G. Bohning &amp; Assoc., Inc.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b641-8\">III</p>\n<p id=\"b641-9\">\u201cThe court committed prejudicial error in granting summary judgment to the village of Valley View as it owed a special duty to the plaintiff in these circumstances.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b641-10\">The village\u2019s decision to grant Target an excavation permit and the village engineer\u2019s responsibility in setting forth the specifics of the permit and enforcing it are not functions which give rise to liability on the part of the political subdivision or its employee.</p>\n<p id=\"b641-11\">Under R.C. 2744.02(A)(1) the village of Valley View would not be liable for \u201cany act or omission * * * in connection with a governmental or proprietary function.\u201d Included in the definition of a \u201cgovernmental function\u201d is:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b641-12\">\u201cThe provision or nonprovision of inspection services of all types, including, but not limited to, inspections in connection with building, zoning, sanitation, fire, plumbing, and electrical codes, and the taking of actions in connection with those types of codes, including, but not limited to, the approval of plans for the construction of buildings or structures and the issuance or revocation of building permits or stop work orders in connection with buildings or structures.\u201d R.C. 2744.01(C)(2)(p).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b641-13\">Under <em>Sawicki v. Ottawa Hills </em>(1988), 37 Ohio St.3d 222, 525 N.E.2d 468, and <em>Williams v. Pavlovich </em>(1989), 45 Ohio St.3d 179, 543 N.E.2d 1242, the village and its engineer would also be immune from liability under the public duty rule. A special duty to appellant has not been established on the facts of this case to create an exception to the public duty rule.</p>\n<p id=\"b641-14\">Appellant\u2019s second and third assignments of error are overruled.</p>\n<p id=\"b641-15\">The trial court\u2019s grant of the motions for summary judgment for the village of Valley View and Bohning is affirmed. The trial court\u2019s decision to grant Target\u2019s motion for summary judgment is reversed. This cause is remanded for a trial on <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"610\">*610</page-number>the merits to determine the issues of fact raised by appellant in its complaint against Target.</p>\n<p id=\"b642-4\">\n<em>Judgment accordingly.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b642-5\">Matia and Porter, JJ., concur.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
