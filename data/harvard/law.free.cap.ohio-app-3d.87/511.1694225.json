Russell, appeals <em>pro se </em>from an order of the common pleas court requiring Russell to pay attorney fees in the sum of $350 to the Shaker Heights Municipal Court and Magistrate Judge John Judge, respondents-appellees. Following dismissal of Russell\u2019s verified complaint for a writ of prohibition, the award was made pursuant to R.C. 2323.51(B)(1), which provides that \u201cwithin twenty-one days after the entry of judgment in a civil action, the court may award reasonable attorney\u2019s fees to any party to that action adversely affected by frivolous conduct.\u201d</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b544-16\">\u201c \u2018Frivolous conduct\u2019 means conduct of a party to a civil action * * * that satisfies either of the following:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b544-17\">\u201c(a) It obviously serves merely to harass or maliciously injure another party to the civil action;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b545-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"513\">*513</page-number>\u201c(b) It is not warranted under existing law and cannot be supported by a good faith argument for an extension, modification, or reversal of existing law.\u201d R.C. 2323.51(A)(2).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b545-4\">We find that the trial court properly awarded attorney fees and costs against Russell. We affirm the judgment below.</p>\n<p id=\"b545-5\">This case had its origins in Russell\u2019s arrest for driving without a license in Beachwood, Ohio on May 21, 1992 within the jurisdiction of the Shaker Heights Municipal Court. Thereafter ensued a number of events that ultimately resulted in his trial and conviction in the Shaker Heights Municipal Court. His appeal from that criminal conviction is pending in this court as case No. 64291.</p>\n<p id=\"b545-6\">While Russell was awaiting trial in the Shaker Heights prosecution he filed a verified complaint for a writ of prohibition in the Cuyahoga County Court of Common Pleas to prevent the Shaker Heights Municipal Court from proceeding with the prosecution. Shaker Heights filed a motion to dismiss the action because an action for the extraordinary writ of prohibition does not lie in the common pleas court. The trial court granted the motion to dismiss and then entertained and granted Shaker Heights\u2019s motion for attorney fees in a subsequent hearing. Russell does not challenge the amount of the award. We will address Russell\u2019s assignments of error in the order asserted.</p>\n<p id=\"b545-7\">\u201cI. The trial court erred in awarding attorney\u2019s fees pursuant to R.C. \u00a7 2323.51 because such awards are provided only where there is frivolous conduct as that term is defined in the statute. This is plain error.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b545-8\">We find that Russell\u2019s attempt to obtain a writ of prohibition from the common pleas court is \u201cfrivolous conduct\u201d within the meaning of the attorney fees statute. \u201cThe Court of Common Pleas does not, in the absence of statutes conferring it, have original jurisdiction in prohibition.\u201d <em>State ex rel. Miller v. Keefe </em>(1958), 168 Ohio St. 234, 6 O.O.2d 18, 152 N.E.2d 113, paragraph two of the syllabus; <em>State ex rel. Bernges v. Common Pleas Court of Clermont Cty. </em>(1970), 23 Ohio App.2d 89, 52 O.O.2d 94, 260 N.E.2d 839. The parties have cited no applicable statutes, and we have found none, vesting the common pleas court with jurisdiction in prohibition. A suit for a writ of prohibition is properly directed to the Supreme Court or courts of appeals, which have original jurisdiction, but not to the common pleas court. Sections 2 and 3, Article IV, Ohio Constitution. Although Russell was appearing <em>pro se, </em>he nonetheless had the benefit of the city of Beachwood\u2019s brief filed on June 25, 1992, which pointed out the lack of jurisdiction in the common pleas court. Nevertheless, rather than dismissing his action, he proceeded with it, wasting the court\u2019s and opposing counsel\u2019s time.</p>\n<p id=\"b545-9\">This assignment of error is overruled.</p>\n<p id=\"b546-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"514\">*514</page-number>\u201cII. The trial court erred in awarding attorney\u2019s fees to appellees, who may not benefit by such an award according to the legal principle that a party cannot recover fees incurred as a result of that party\u2019s own improper conduct. This is plain error.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b546-4\">In this assignment Russell seems to invoke the familiar equitable principle that no man can profit from his own wrongdoing. That principle has no application here. The prohibition action in common pleas court was improperly instituted by Russell because of transgressions he perceived or anticipated in the proceedings in the Shaker Heights Municipal Court. It remains to be seen whether there was any wrongdoing in the proceedings in that court when Russell\u2019s other appeal is heard. Nevertheless, that does not alter the fact that he engaged in frivolous conduct by beginning and maintaining a prohibition proceeding in the common pleas court, unnecessarily requiring the Shaker Heights Municipal Court to defend against it.</p>\n<p id=\"b546-5\">This assignment of error is overruled.</p>\n<p id=\"b546-6\">\u201cHI. The trial court erred in awarding attorney\u2019s fees pursuant to R.C. \u00a7 2323.51 because the trial court had previously dismissed appellant\u2019s cause upon appellee\u2019s Civ.R. 12(B) motion to dismiss for want of jurisdiction. Having dismissed appellant\u2019s complaint for want of jurisdiction, the court was without jurisdiction to award sanctions pursuant to R.C. \u00a7 2323.51. Appellant challenged the trial court\u2019s jurisdiction in his motion to strike appellees\u2019 motion for sanction.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b546-7\">The issue presented by this assignment is whether a trial court continues to have jurisdiction to enter an award of attorney fees for frivolous conduct although it has dismissed the suit which precipitated th\u00e9 unnecessary expenditure of fees. This issue is resolved by the attorney fees statute itself, in that it states that \u201cwithin twenty-one days <em>after entry of judgment </em>in a civil action, the court may award reasonable attorney\u2019s fees to any party to that action adversely affected by frivolous conduct.\u201d (Emphasis added.) R.C. 2323.51(B)(1). The statute contemplated consideration and award of attorney fees \u201cafter entry of judgment,\u201d <em>i.e., </em>after dismissal of Russell\u2019s action. An award of attorney fees as sanctions after the dismissal of the principal action is appropriate. <em>Painter v. Midland Steel Products Co. </em>(1989), 65 Ohio App.3d 273, 280, 583 N.E.2d 1018, 1022; <em>Hildreth v. Mims </em>(1990), 70 Ohio App.3d 282, 287, 590 N.E.2d 1353, 1356.</p>\n<p id=\"b546-8\">Although he did not originally assign it as error or brief it, appellant Russell raised the interesting question at oral argument whether proceedings in prohibition are a \u201ccivil action\u201d within the meaning of R.C. 2323.51(B)(1). Appellant contends that his complaint for a writ of prohibition was not a \u201ccivil action\u201d but a special proceeding and that R.C. 2323.51 does not apply, We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b547-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"515\">*515</page-number>The case on which appellant relies is <em>State ex rel. Miller v. Keefe, supra, </em>168 Ohio St. at 238, 6 O.O.2d at 20, 152 N.E.2d at 116, where the Supreme Court stated in dictum: \u201cNor do we think the \u2018civil action\u2019 of the Code embraces proceedings in prohibition.\u201d This decision was rendered before the adoption of the Ohio Rules of Civil Procedure, which state:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b547-4\">\u201cThese rules prescribe the procedure to be followed in all courts of this state in the exercise of civil jurisdiction at law or in equity, with the exceptions stated in subdivision (C) of this rule.\u201d Civ.R. 1(A).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b547-5\">Except as statutes might otherwise dictate, <em>e.g., </em>Civ.R. 1(C)(7), we believe that the Civil Rules were intended to cover all proceedings in the trial courts. \u201cThere shall be only one form of action, and it shall be known as a civil action.\u201d Civ.R. 2. See <em>State ex rel. Millington v. Weir </em>(1978), 60 Ohio App.2d 348, 349, 14 O.O.3d 310, 311, 397 N.E.2d 770, 772 (Civil Rules supersede the statutory requirements for a verified complaint in mandamus). We also take notice of our own Loc.R. 8(B)(1), which provides that actions on extraordinary writs \u201cwill proceed as any civil action under the Ohio Rules of Civil Procedure.\u201d S.Ct.Prac.R. VIII, Section 1, likewise provides: \u201cAn original action, other than habeas corpus, * * * shall proceed as any civil action under the Ohio Rules of Civil Procedure.\u201d It would be incongruous if the trial court did not have the power, inherent or otherwise under the statutes and rules applicable to civil actions, to discourage and sanction frivolous actions.</p>\n<p id=\"b547-6\">Accordingly, we hold that the action filed by appellant was of a civil nature and the trial court did not err in applying R.C. 2323.51.</p>\n<p id=\"b547-7\">This assignment of error is not well taken.</p>\n<p id=\"b547-8\">\n<em>Judgment affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b547-9\">Dyke, C.J., John F.
