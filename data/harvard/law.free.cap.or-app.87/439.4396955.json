ORS 166.270. He also appeals the subsequent reinstatement of his prison sentence and revocation of his probation on an earlier forgery in the first degree conviction. The sole issue with respect to both appeals is whether the sawed-off shotgun that defendant admits to having had in his possession is a \u201cfirearm capable of being concealed upon the person,\u201d as that phrase is used in ORS 166.270(1). We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b479-5\">ORS 166.270(1) provides, in part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b479-6\">\u201cAny person who has been convicted of a felony * * * who owns, or has in the person\u2019s possession or under the person\u2019s custody or control any firearm <em>capable of being concealed upon the person, </em>or any machine gun, commits the crime of exconvict in possession of a firearm.\u201d (Emphasis supplied.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b479-7\">Defendant does not contend that the sawed off shotgun, which had an 18-1/4 inch barrel and an overall length of 28-3/4 inches, was too large to be concealed on his person. He argues that, for the purpose of ORS 166.270(1), a firearm \u201ccapable of being concealed upon the person\u201d is defined and limited by ORS 166.210(2), which provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b479-8\">\u201c \u2018Pistol,\u2019 \u2018revolver\u2019 and \u2018firearms capable of being concealed upon the person,\u2019 <em>apply to and include </em>all firearms having a barrel less than 12 inches in length.\u201d (Emphasis supplied.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b479-9\">Defendant\u2019s reliance on ORS 166.210(2) is misplaced. The statute\u2019s use of the phrase \u201capply to and include\u201d rather than the term \u201cmeans,\u201d which is used in the definition of \u201cfirearm\u201d in ORS 166.210(1),<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> shows that the legislature, did not intend firearms with barrels less than 12 inches in length to be the exhaustive class of firearms capable of concealment. <em>See Beaver v. Pelett, </em>299 Or 664, 668, 705 P2d 1149 (1985). Rather, firearms with barrels less than 12 inches in length are \u201ccapable of being concealed upon the person\u201d as a matter of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"442\">*442</page-number>law. With respect to a firearm with a barrel 12 inches in length or longer, whether it is capable of being concealed upon the person depends on the circumstances of the particular case. Here, the trial court found that the sawed-off shotgun, which had an 18-1/4 inch barrel and was equipped with a pistol grip, was capable of being concealed on defendant\u2019s person. There was no error.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b480-4\">Affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b479-10\"> ORS 166.210(1) provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b479-11\">\u201c \u2018Firearm\u2019 <em>means </em>a weapon, by whatever name known, which is designed to. expel a projectile by the action of black powder or smokeless powder and which is readily capable of use as a weapon.\u201d (Emphasis supplied.)</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b480-5\"> To the extent that this holding is inconsistent with <em>State v. Clipston, </em>3 Or App 313, 323, 473 P2d 682 (1970), it is overruled.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
