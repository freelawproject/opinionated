He assigns as error the trial court\u2019s denial of his motions to suppress evidence seized from his bedroom closet and certain statements which he made following the search and seizure. The only question is whether defendant consented to the warrantless search and seizure by remaining silent.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b470-5\">On September 27,1985, a Bonneville Power Administration (BPA) janitor reported that a. suspicious old red pickup was parked in a BPA parking lot. Three days later, a BPA district engineer discovered that someone had stolen electronic testing equipment valued at $10,000 to $30,000 from his vehicle. The officer investigating the theft visited defendant and his father at their residence. The father, who owned the residence, invited the officer inside. The officer inquired about the use of an old red pickup, which belonged to defendant\u2019s father. Defendant denied driving the pickup on the date in question. The father expressly gave the officer permission \u201cto look around the house.\u201d The officer, followed by defendant and his father, went upstairs, where there were two bedrooms and a bathroom. Defendant\u2019s father pointed and said, \u201cThis is my son\u2019s room,\u201d and opened the door.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The officer entered the room, followed by the father, who pointed to the bed and a closet. Defendant remained in the hall, silent. The officer opened the closet and saw two large aluminum cases. Defendant, who was still in the hall, said, \u201cDad didn\u2019t know nothing about it.\u201d The officer advised defendant of his <em>Miranda </em>rights and seized the cases, placing them, with defendant\u2019s assistance, in the patrol car. The officer also noticed several old Bibles and a chain saw in defendant\u2019s room. In response to the officer\u2019s questions, defendant admitted that he had obtained them in a burglary.</p>\n<p id=\"b470-6\">The trial court denied defendant\u2019s motions to suppress the seized evidence and the statements on the ground that his conduct constituted a silent consent to the search <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"433\">*433</page-number>and, therefore, the evidence and statements were not the result of an illegal search. Because the conclusion that defendant consented requires the application of legal principles to historical facts, we must independently examine the uncontested facts to determine whether defendant\u2019s conduct amounted to consent. <em>State v. Warner, </em>284 Or 147, 585 P2d 681 (1978). Defendant was present during the officer\u2019s entire visit. When his father consented to the officer\u2019s request \u201cto look around the house,\u201d defendant was standing immediately beside his father and remained silent. At the top of the stairs, when defendant\u2019s father opened the door to his room, defendant remained outside the door, said nothing and made no movement to bar entry. The setting was not coercive and, in fact, the entire encounter had seemingly been rather friendly. There is no indication that defendant is mentally deficient or was for some reason unable to object.</p>\n<p id=\"b471-4\">We hold that defendant, by his failure to object to his father\u2019s apparent authorization of the search of his room, consented to it. Accordingly, the trial court did not err in denying his motions to suppress.</p>\n<p id=\"b471-5\">Affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b470-7\"> Defendant does not argue that, if there was consent, it was not voluntarily given.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b470-8\"> The state does not contend that the trial court based its decision on a finding of the father\u2019s common right of access to defendant\u2019s room.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
