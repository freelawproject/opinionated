They contend that the trial court erred in denying their motions to suppress evidence seized from the Dixsons\u2019 property in a warrantless search. The issue is whether Article I, section 9,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> of the Oregon Constitution requires a warrant for a search of an \u201copen field.\u201d We hold that it does and reverse. .</p>\n<p id=\"b36-5\">The Dixsons were purchasing the property in question, consisting of 40 acres, and lived in a home approximately 800 feet from the area where the marijuana plants were seized. That area was outside the curtilage of the home. Only a portion of the 40 acres was fenced. Lorin Dixson cultivated the land with the help of Digby. Sheriffs deputies, acting on a tip from an informant that marijuana was'growing on property owned by Rogge Lumber Company, went to the area and saw the Dixson residence, access roads and a vehicle being used to transport water. One of the officers then checked with the assessor\u2019s office to determine the property boundaries in the area. The following day, he flew over the area<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> and saw several patches of what he believed to be growing marijuana. He concluded, mistakenly, that the plants were growing on the Rogge property and obtained Rogge\u2019s consent to search its land for marijuana.</p>\n<p id=\"b36-6\">To get to the plants, the officers drove on a public road to a dirt logging road on the Dixson property. That road had not been used for some time and was not passable with a passenger car. At the property line, the Dixsons had posted a \u201cNo Hunting\u201d sign on a wire cable that was stretched across the road to block access. They had also felled a large madrona tree across it to prevent access. The officers walked around the cable and continued down the logging road to another dirt road, which also had a wire cable stretched across it with a \u201cNo Hunting\u201d sign attached. They walked around that cable <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"5\">*5</page-number>as well and came to another \u201cNo Hunting\u201d sign. Vegetation on and around the Dixson property was thick brush and, as the trial court found, the marijuana was not visible from ground level other than from the Dixson property. The officers saw the marijuana plants by pushing aside the brush after entering the land. They also encountered Lorin Dixson and Digby at the site of the plants.</p>\n<p id=\"b37-4\">The trial court found that Digby had a proprietary interest in the marijuana plants but no ownership interest in or right to possess the Dixson land. Therefore, it concluded that Digby did not have \u201cstanding\u201d to object to the search that occurred on the Dixsons\u2019 property. With respect to the Dixsons, the trial court, relying entirely on <em>Oliver v. United States, </em>466 US 170, 104 S Ct 1735, 80 L Ed 2d 214 (1984), held that they had no legitimate expectation that the area outside of their curtilage would remain free from warrantless intrusion by the sheriffs deputies. Accordingly, it denied all of the motions to suppress.</p>\n<p id=\"b37-5\">The decisive issue is not, as the trial court apparently thought, one of federal law. Whether defendant\u2019s land is constitutionally protected depends, in the first instance, not on United States Supreme Court cases interpreting the Fourth Amendment, but on the basic principles underlying the Oregon Constitution. We derive our analysis from them.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> <em>See State v. Kennedy, </em>295 Or 260, 666 P2d 1316 (1983). While those principles may be similar to those underlying the Fourth Amendment, we need not join the federal retreat from the constitutional requirements.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b38-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"6\">*6</page-number>The dispositive question is whether Article I, section 9, protects defendants from police intrusions onto the land where the marijuana was found. If it does, the deputies violated the constitutional protection, because they did not have a search warrant and the circumstances did not create an exception to the warrant requirement. If the land were within the curtilage of defendants\u2019 home, it would come within the specific constitutional language of \u201cpersons, houses, papers, and effects * * *.\u201d <em>State v. Lee, </em>120 Or 643, 253 P 533 (1927); <em>State v. Ohling, </em>70 Or App 249, 688 P2d 1384, <em>rev den </em>298 Or 334 (1984). Because it is not, we must determine whether Article I, section 9, is concerned exclusively with the rights that it expressly mentions or whether it uses those rights as tools to achieve a broader purpose. That is, does the constitution protect property as property, or is its protection of property a means to a greater end?</p>\n<p id=\"b38-4\">We believe it obvious that the constitution protects property in order to protect something more \u2014 one\u2019s personalty or individuality \u2014 from official control. It does so by adapting traditional trespass law to create areas where officials may not go. Article I, section 9, and the Fourth Amendment are the direct product of the experience that Americans had during the pre-revolutionary period with uncontrolled executive power. The colonists (and their supporters in England) looked to safeguards against arbitrary searches and seizures as one of the bulwarks of the liberty for which they <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"7\">*7</page-number>fought the Revolution. <em>See </em>Jensen, <em>The Founding of a Nation: A History of the American Revolution, 1763-1776, </em>155-58, 258, 377-78 (1968); Cooley, <em>Constitutional Limitations, </em>300-303 n 1 (1st ed 1868).</p>\n<p id=\"b39-4\">The tie between liberty and the right to exclude others from one\u2019s property remained basic in American thinking after the Revolution. In one\u2019s home one could be oneself. Writers frequently quoted a statement the Earl of Chatham, an English supporter of the American colonists, made before the revolution:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b39-5\">\u201cThe poorest man may, in his cottage, bid defiance to all the forces of the Crown. It may be frail; its roof may shake; the wind may blow through it; the storm may enter; the rain may enter; but the king of England may not enter; all his force dares not cross the threshold of the ruined tenement.\u201d <em>Quoted in </em>Cooley, <em>Constitutional Limitations, supra, </em>299 n 3.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b39-6\">Over a century later, the United States Supreme Court made a similar point in describing the heart of a violation of the Fourth Amendment:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b39-7\">\u201cIt is not the breaking of his doors, and the rummaging of his drawers, that constitutes the essence of the offense; but it is <em>the invasion of the indefeasible right of personal security, personal liberty and private property, </em>where that right has never been forfeited by his conviction of some public offense * * *.\u201d <em>Boyd v. United States, </em>116 US 616, 630, 6 S Ct 524, 29 L Ed 746 (1886). (Emphasis supplied.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b39-8\">In this century, we call the \u201cliberty\u201d to which Chatham and the Supreme Court referred the \u201cright to privacy.\u201d It is inherent in the purpose of Article I, section 9, and we must construe the state constitution to protect that right.</p>\n<p id=\"b39-9\">As the Supreme Court said in <em>State v. Duffy, et al., </em>135 Or 290, 297, 295 P 953 (1931), the purpose of that provision is \u201cto protect the individual in the sanctity of his home and in the <em>privacy </em>of his books, papers <em>and property </em>* * (Emphasis supplied.) The constitution is as extensive as the privacy which it is designed to protect. As a result of the sophisticated technology and increasingly complex society which have developed in this century, we now face situations in which literal adherence to the constitutional language defeats the constitutional purpose. We must extend constitutional protections beyond the express language of the constitution in order to give the constitution continuing life. The <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"8\">*8</page-number>danger in doing so is that we may lose a solid foundation for those rights. We thus must also establish an objective basis for deciding privacy rights that is both based in prior law and comports with the constitutional purpose.</p>\n<p id=\"b40-4\">The federal cases give us little help in this regard. At least since <em>Katz v. United States, </em>389 US 347, 88 S Ct 507, 19 L Ed 2d 576 (1967), they have recognized the necessity of protecting privacy beyond the literal terms of the Fourth Amendment. The test they use, however, is so flexible that it has little objective content beyond the specific cases decided.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Because the criteria by which to protect privacy under the state constitution remain unclear, we may approach the problem afresh.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b40-5\">There are two issues involved in applying Article I, section 9, to facts which are outside its literal language: First, <em>what places or things </em>does the provision protect? Second, <em>from what kinds of investigations </em>does it protect them? In <em>Katz v. United States, supra, </em>for instance, the court held that the defendant was protected <em>in </em>a public telephone booth <em>from </em>a device which allowed officers to overhear and record his side of a conversation. Although we might agree with that holding, the \u201creasonable expectation of privacy\u201d test which courts have drawn from Justice Harlan\u2019s concurrence both misdirects our attention and provides no answer to those questions.</p>\n<p id=\"b40-6\">The <em>Katz </em>test has two parts: the defendant must show both an actual (\u201csubjective\u201d) expectation of privacy <em>and </em>that the expectation is reasonable, that is, that it is one which <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"9\">*9</page-number>society will honor.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> The requirement of a subjective expectation turns the issue on its head: a person\u2019s rights do not depend on what he or she expects, but on what society provides to everyone. After all, the less the police respect citizens\u2019 rights, the lower will likely be a citizen\u2019s subjective expectations of privacy. To the degree that this criterion has any value, it is not in determining whether the person, place or thing is protected but in deciding whether particular police action violated that protection.</p>\n<p id=\"b41-4\">For instance, a person who chooses to grow marijuana in a front yard does not lose his rights in the yard. The police may not, without a warrant or an exception to the warrant requirement, intrude into the yard. They may, however, look at and photograph the crop from an adjacent public place and use their observations and photographs in applying for a search warrant and as evidence at trial. The reason is not that the yard is unprotected or that the person has no subjective expectation of privacy in it; rather, the police action is proper because the police did not violate the protection that the constitution gives. \u201cPersons may conduct themselves in otherwise protected areas in such a way that their words or acts can be plainly seen or heard outside without any special effort.\u201d <em>State v. Louis, </em>296 Or 57, 61, 672 P2d 708 (1983). The <em>Katz </em>test leads to a misunderstanding of that fundamental concept.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b41-5\">The second part of the <em>Katz </em>test, that the expectation be one which society will honor, simply restates the problem; it is not a test at all. It does not suggest how a court might determine that a particular \u201cexpectation\u201d is \u201creasonable.\u201d If that determination depends on something other than the predictions of those who decide the particular case, it must come from sources which explicate society\u2019s understanding of constitutional values. The proper question, thus, is not what the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"10\">*10</page-number>defendant expects or whether that expectation is reasonable but <em>whether the constitution protects the defendant. </em>That is the question before us.</p>\n<p id=\"Aa\">Although the Supreme Court has not clearly stated what it believes to be the extent of the constitutional protection of privacy, it has indicated \"that \u201cintrusion upon seclusion,\u201d as described in <em>Restatement (Second) Torts </em>\u00a7 652B, may be a privacy right whose violation gives rise to a tort. <em>Anderson v. Fisher Broadcasting Co. </em>300 Or 452, 712 P2d 803 (1986). That approach is consistent with one commentator\u2019s suggestion that privacy protects one\u2019s secrecy and solitude. <em>Note, </em>\u201cProtecting Privacy Under the Fourth Amendment,\u201d 91 Yale LJ 313, 327-30 (1981). Both suggestions are in line with the early understandings of the constitutional purpose discussed above. We follow those suggestions and hold that Article I, section 9, protects a person\u2019s right to exclude unwanted intrusions and unwanted methods of intruding from places and things over which that person has legitimate control. The right to exclude protects a person\u2019s secrecy and solitude. Whether one has legitimate control over a place or thing can usually be decided on the basis of other law. For this reason, the test states objective criteria which we can readily apply to this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b42-6\">The officers intruded into areas which are protected under common law trespass rules that existed long before the adoption of either the Fourth Amendment or Article I, section 9. Those areas are also protected under more recent criminal trespass statutes. ORS 164.205(6); ORS 164.245(1). The right to exclude unwanted intruders from them is well established. Although the land is not within the constitutional definition of \u201chome,\u201d the well-established right to control entry gives the possessor of the land a privacy interest in it as against anyone with a lesser right to possession. It does not matter that the officers did not have the <em>mens rea </em>necessary to subject them to criminal liability. What matters is that statutes and the common law protect the Dixons\u2019 land.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> <em>See Oliver v. United States, </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"11\">*11</page-number><em>supra, </em>466 US at 189-93 (Marshall, J., dissenting). The Dixsons, therefore, had a privacy interest in the land which they could assert against the police.</p>\n<p id=\"b43-4\">Digby\u2019s motion should also have been granted. He had a proprietary interest in the growing plants, helped care for them and had the right to exclude others from the property. In short, he was a licensee whose rights in the land were greater than those of the officers. He, along with the Dixsons, had a privacy right in the area in question. His Article I, section 9, rights were violated in the same way as were the Dixsons\u2019 rights.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b43-5\">Reversed and remanded for a new trial in each case.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b36-7\"> Article I, section 9, provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b36-8\">\u201cNo law shall violate the right of the people to be secure in their persons, houses, papers, and effects, against unreasonable search, or seizure; and no warrant shall issue but upon probable cause, supported by oath, or affirmation, and particularly describing the place to be searched, and the person or thing to be seized.\u201d</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b36-9\"> Defendants do not attack the validity of the aerial observation.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b37-6\"> We noted in <em>State v. Russo, </em>68 Or App 760, 764 n 2, 683 P2d 163 (1984), that \u201c[t]he existence and extent of an \u2018open field\u2019 doctrine under the Oregon Constitution is an open question.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b37-7\"> In his dissent, Judge Van Hoomissen ignores a basic rule of Oregon constitutional law: The Oregon Constitution is independent of the federal or other state constitutions. Federal constitutional opinions are relevant to Oregon decisions'only to the extent that they convince by their reasoning, even when the federal and Oregon constitutions have the same origins and are designed to protect the same values. <em>State v. Soriano, </em>68 Or App 642, 645-46, 684 P2d 1220, <em>opinion adopted </em>298 Or 392, 693 P2d 26 (1984); <em>State v. Kennedy, supra. </em>While Article I, section 9, and the Fourth Amendment have the same roots and reflect the same values, there is no reason to believe that the United States Supreme Court in 1984 (the year of <em>Oliver v. United States, supra) </em>was better able to apply those values than is this court in 1987. Neither court can claim any special channel to those who adopted the constitutions. By relying on older cases such as <em>State v. Flores, </em>280 Or 273, 570 P2d 965 (1977), and <em>State v. Florance, </em>270 Or <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"6\">*6</page-number>169, 527 P2d 1202 (1974), the dissent evades current Oregon law.</p>\n<p id=\"b38-6\">It is also curious that the dissent ignores federal law when it is apparently contrary to its position. Its attack on our willingness to extend constitutional protections beyond the explicit constitutional language in order to preserve constitutional values conveniently ignores that that is precisely what the federal courts have purported to do since <em>Katz v. United States, infra. </em>Indeed, our position is in some respects closer to the federal position than is the dissent\u2019s. Like the federal courts, we recognize the constitutional importance of protecting privacy; we simply consider the <em>Katz </em>test to be insufficiently objective and therefore inadequate to place clear limits on official action. The dissent would apparently retain the <em>pre-Katz </em>property-only law in its entirety, using the letter of the law to kill the spirit.</p>\n<p id=\"b38-7\">Finally, we have not \u201coverturned\u201d previous Oregon cases. <em>State v. Evans, </em>143 Or 603, 22 P2d 496 (1933), concerned the search of a hunting camp <em>on public land; </em>it is not authority for the \u201copen fields\u201d doctrine. Neither it, <em>State v. Lee, infra, </em>nor the other cases the dissent cites considered the effect that the protection of privacy inherent in Article I, section 9, might have in extending the constitution\u2019s express property-based language. That is an issue of first impression under the Oregon Constitution. We must resolve it by applying the constitutional purpose, not by stale attacks on supposed \u201cjudicial activism.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b40-7\"> For instance, the United States Supreme Court requires a \u201creasonable expectation of privacy\u201d before it will hold that the Fourth Amendment protects a defendant\u2019s rights, even in the kind of property which the constitution specifically lists. <em>See, e.g., United States v. Jacobson, </em>466 US 109, 104 S Ct 1652, 80 L Ed 2d 85 (1984) (private search so invaded the defendant\u2019s privacy interest in a package that subsequent warrantless government intrusion was permissible; no discussion of the defendant\u2019s continuing property right in it).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b40-8\"> The special concurrence suggests that the question is not completely open, because the Oregon Supreme Court has several times referred to \u201cprivacy interests\u201d under Article 1, section 9. However, the special concurrence is incorrect in its belief that the court\u2019s use of that term gives us any guidance for this case. In every case that the Supreme Court has decided the constitutional protection was clear; the object searched was the defendant\u2019s \u201ceffect.\u201d The court refers to \u201cprivacy interests\u201d as a <em>kind of interest </em>that the constitution protects, not as a method for determining what places or things the constitution protects. In contrast, the question before us in this case is whether a particular place has any constitutional protection at all.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b41-6\"> <em>See </em>LaFave, <em>Search and Seizure, </em>\u00a7 2.1 (2nd ed 1986), for a description and discussion of the <em>Katz </em>test as the federal courts apply it.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b41-7\"> Although the special concurrence would also reject <em>Katz, </em>its insistence that the land\u2019s physical characteristics make it \u201cprivate\u201d before it is protected suffers from the same flaws. The special concurrence does correctly recognize that, however we resolve the privacy aspects of these issues, the specific constitutional language sets a floor below which we cannot go. If a police intrusion is a trespass into the defendant\u2019s home, papers or effects, it violates the defendant\u2019s rights. <em>See State v. Normile, </em>74 Or App 545, 702 P2d 1160, <em>rev den </em>300 Or 162 (1985); <em>State v. Ohling, supra; State v. Russo, </em>68 Or App 760, 683 P2d 163 (1984).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"9\">\n<p id=\"b42-7\"> We do not suggest that defendants\u2019 privacy interests are measured solely by their property rights; however, those property rights provide a solid foundation for determining that defendants in this case have privacy interests which the constitution protects.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"10\">\n<p id=\"b43-8\"> That a person has the right to exclude, of course, is not necessarily the end of the question. In many situations there will be implied or express consent for members of the public to enter land for hiking, hunting, fishing and similar activities. <em>See, e.g., State v. Ohling, supra </em>(implied consent to go to front door of residence). Implied consent might be more likely for an \u201copen field\u201d than for land within the curtilage. However, the issue is whether the owner gave <em>consent to intrude; </em>the owner necessarily has the right to exclude. There was no consent here, and the police intrusion was thus impermissible.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"concurrence\">\n<author id=\"b43-6\">BUTTLER, J.,</author>\n<p id=\"Abt\">specially concurring.</p>\n<p id=\"b43-7\">The upshot of the plurality opinion is that all real property, whether developed or occupied or not, is entitled to the same constitutional protection as \u201chouses\u201d under Article I, section 9, because \u201cthe well-established right to control entry gives the possessor of the land a privacy interest in it as against anyone with a lesser right to possession.\u201d 87 Or App at 10. There is no doubt that a person has that kind of privacy interest or that Article I, section 9, protects a person\u2019s privacy interest in \u201chouses, papers and effects.\u201d <em>State v. Duffy et al., </em>135 Or 290, 295 P 953 (1931). The question is whether, given the right to exclude others, the possessor is entitled to the same constitutional protection afforded houses under Article I, section 9, even though a house includes no more than the house itself and its curtilage. <em>State v. Lee, </em>120 Or 643, 253 P 533 (1927).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> This court may not overrule <em>Lee, </em>as the plurality <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"12\">*12</page-number>opinion apparently would do, at least impliedly; neither do I think it is necessary to do so in this case in order to extend constitutional protection to objectively manifested privacy interests in land not within the curtilage.</p>\n<p id=\"b44-4\">The occupant of a house is presumed to have a constitutionally protected privacy interest in it, \u201cthe quintessential domain protected by the constitutional guarantee against warrantless searches.\u201d <em>State v. Louis, </em>296 Or 57, 60, 672 P2d 708 (1983). It need not be shown that the occupant expected privacy. On the other hand, if the person conducts himself in such a way that his acts may be seen readily without technological enhancement, he sacrifices his protected privacy interest, and an officer\u2019s observation of the conduct does not constitute a search. <em>State v. Louis, supra. </em>I do not understand the plurality to disagree with that proposition.</p>\n<p id=\"b44-5\">Our difference lies in resolving a question that is not presented in this case: whether a warrant is necessary before the police may seize contraband that they have observed on land outside the curtilage from a lawful vantage point without technological enhancement. The plurality would say that, although the observation was made without a search, all land is entitled to be treated the same as a house and its curtilage, and therefore a warrant is required in order to seize the obvious contraband. I would hold that, if it is necessary for the officers to trespass on property not within the curtilage in order to observe the activity or contraband in question, there is an unreasonable search and, therefore, any ensuing seizure would be unlawful.</p>\n<p id=\"b44-6\">Whether Article I, section 9, extends individual privacy rights beyond \u201cpersons, houses, papers and effects\u201d and, if so, on what basis, has not been decided. Defendants argue that we should apply the analysis of <em>Katz v. United States, </em>389 US 347, 88 S Ct 507, 19 L Ed 2d 576 (1967), although no case in the Supreme Court or in this court has adopted that analysis in considering the protection afforded by Article I, section 9. Neither has any case rejected it.</p>\n<p id=\"b44-7\">The most that I can make of the decided cases is that there is no <em>per se </em>exception to Article I, section 9, applicable to areas outside the curtilage \u2014 so-called \u201copen fields.\u201d <em>See Oliver v. United States, </em>466 US 170, 104 S Ct 1735, 80 L Ed 2d 214 (1984). Whether the area is protected constitutionally <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"13\">*13</page-number>depends on the facts of each case: has the defendant\u2019s cognizable privacy interest been invaded by the police. How that privacy interest is determined is an open question. The Supreme Court\u2019s most recent pronouncement on the protection afforded by the Oregon Constitution is in <em>State v. Owens, </em>302 Or 196, 206, 729 P2d 524 (1986):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b45-4\">\u201cArticle I, section 9, protects privacy and possessory interests. A \u2018search\u2019 occurs when a person\u2019s privacy interests are invaded.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b45-5\">In <em>Owens, </em>the object seized and searched was a transparent container \u2014 an \u201ceffect\u201d specifically protected by Article I, section 9. Nevertheless, the court stated that not all containers merit the same protection, because some, such as a transparent one, announce their contents; therefore, \u201cno cognizable privacy interest inheres in their contents,\u201d 302 Or at 206, and they may be opened and their contents seized. The court did not elaborate on how it determines whether a person has a \u201ccognizable privacy interest\u201d; however, the apparent reasoning is that one who carries something in a transparent container has manifested no expectation that the contents will be private, because they are in \u201cplain view.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b45-6\">Prior decisions have dealt briefly with the subject and suggest that the test is whether the defendant had a reasonable expectation of privacy in the thing searched. <em>See State v. Perry, </em>298 Or 21, 688 P2d 827 (1984); <em>State v. Elkins, </em>245 Or 279, 422 P2d 250 (1966). In <em>State v. Holt, </em>291 Or 343, 630 P2d 854 (1981), the court applied the <em>Katz </em>analysis in considering whether the protection of Article I, section 9, extended beyond a physical trespass, although it did so because the defendant had not argued that the analysis should be different than under the Fourth Amendment.</p>\n<p id=\"b45-7\">Under <em>Katz, </em>whether a claimed privacy interest deserves constitutional protection depends on whether the person has exhibited an actual (subjective) expectation of privacy and, if so, whether that expectation is one that society is prepared to recognize as reasonable. If both parts of the test are satisfied, the individual\u2019s privacy interest is protected, even though the place in which his privacy right is asserted is not mentioned specifically in Article I, section 9. Because I believe that both parts of the <em>Katz </em>test present problems as applied to a person\u2019s privacy interest in real property, I perceive no reason to adopt it here. As to the first part \u2014 the so-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"14\">*14</page-number>called \u201csubjective\u201d expectation \u2014 it would seem that the more tolerant the courts or the legislature are of governmental intrusion, the lower the individual\u2019s subjective expectations will be, because the conduct, over time, will become less offensive to us all.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Accordingly, an objective standard would be preferable. With respect to real property in particular, frequently there are objective indications that privacy is expected. If the property is protected from public view by virtue of its topography or vegetation, there is, without more, an objective manifestation that the place is private, without regard to the person\u2019s subjective expectations. In such a case, one need not build a wall around it or even post \u201cno trespassing\u201d signs to manifest that expectation. As we said in <em>State v. Russo, supra, </em>n 1, there is a \u201cnatural exclusionary barrier.\u201d 68 Or App at 764.</p>\n<p id=\"b46-4\">On the other hand, if the property\u2019s physical characteristics are such that the area in question may be seen without technological enhancement from a public place, such as a road, no amount of subjective expectation<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> that activities in that area will be private will make the area a constitutionally protected one. In that circumstance, the possessor would be in a situation analogous to the defendant in <em>State v. Owens, supra, </em>who carried contraband in a transparent vial (her effect) that announced its contents, thereby making it permissible for the police to seize it and test its contents.</p>\n<p id=\"b46-5\">Similarly, the second part of the <em>Katz </em>analysis \u2014 whether the expectation of privacy is a reasonable one that society is prepared to honor \u2014 is not helpful as applied to a person\u2019s privacy interest in real property. If the lawful <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"15\">*15</page-number>occupier or owner of the property has a cognizable privacy interest in the area in question, he is entitled to constitutional protection against an unreasonable search. The common law of trespass protects his right to exclude others; in addition, the legislature has made it a crime for one to enter on premises when he is not licensed or privileged to do so. <em>See </em>ORS 164.245;<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> ORS 164.205(3)(4)(6).<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Accordingly, a search is unreasonable if, in order to observe activities in the area of the property in question without technological enhancement, it is necessary to trespass on the property.</p>\n<p id=\"b47-4\">Here, the cultivated area of the Dixson\u2019s property was not visible from any place on the ground where the public, including law enforcement officers, had a right to be. Because the old skid roads that entered the property were not passable in passenger cars, and each of them was cabled off and \u201cNo Hunting\u201d signs were posted, there was nothing to indicate to a reasonable person that he could enter without permission. The Dixsons\u2019 nearest neighbor is approximately one-half mile away. Ready access from the Rogge land was prevented by impenetrable brush. The Dixsons, therefore, have a cognizable privacy interest in the area in question that is protected by Article I, section 9.</p>\n<p id=\"b47-5\">When the officers entered the Dixsons\u2019 land, they were trespassers invading the Dixsons\u2019 privacy interests and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"16\">*16</page-number>were engaged in a search for which they had no warrant and for which there was no exception to the warrant requirement. <em>State v. Owens, supra. </em>One of them recognized that fact in testifying that he had no intention of trespassing on the Dix-son property but entered under the mistaken belief that he was on Rogge\u2019s property. The evidence was seized as a result of an unreasonable search.</p>\n<p id=\"b48-4\">Accordingly, albeit for slightly different reasons, I concur in the result reached by the plurality with respect to all three cases.</p>\n<judges id=\"b48-5\">Richardson and Warren, JJ., join in this special concurrence.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b43-9\"> Other cases recognize the constitutional protection afforded an individual\u2019s house and its curtilage. <em>See, e.g., State v.

That concession should end this court\u2019s inquiry. When the language of the constitution is plain and certain, there is no reason for applying rules of construction. <em>State ex rel Bell v.

Lee, </em>120 Or 643, 253 P 533 (1927), the Supreme Court articulated the equivalent of an \u201copen fields\u201d doctrine under the Oregon Constitution. In <em>Lee, </em>the court recognized the common law distinction between a \u201chouse\u201d and the land inside its curtilage and land beyond the curtilage in the \u201copen fields.\u201d<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> The Supreme Court had no reason to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"19\">*19</page-number>recognize that distinction in <em>Lee, </em>except to recognize the common law rule that the legal protection afforded to each category of real property was different. The specially concurring opinion correctly observes that the plurality overrules <em>Lee, </em>at least by implication. 87 Or App at 11.</p>\n<p id=\"b51-4\">The Supreme Court also instructed in <em>Lee </em>that Article I, section 9, is to be construed \u201cin conformity with the principles of the common law.\u201d 120 Or at 649.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> <em>See </em>Cooley, <em>Constitutional Limitations, supra, </em>at 60-62.

Stanton, </em>7 Or App 286, 490 P2d 1274 (1971). <em>See State v. Fondren, </em>285 Or 361, 364, 591 P2d 1374, <em>cert den </em>444 US 834 (1979). However, in <em>Stanton, </em>we mistakenly concluded that <em>Katz </em>had limited <em>Hester. </em>In <em>State v. Walle, </em>52 Or App 963, 969, 630 P2d 377 (1981), we persisted in our error and overruled portions of <em>Stanton, </em>not because we had rejected <em>Hester, </em>but because we thought <em>Katz </em>had limited it.</p>\n<p id=\"b52-7\">I read <em>Lee, Evans </em>and <em>Brown </em>to have accepted <em>Hester </em>under Article I, section 9. I read <em>Stanton </em>and <em>Walle </em>to have limited <em>Hester </em>by superimposing a \u201creasonable expectation of privacy\u201d analysis on it. Defendants essentially agree with my analysis of the relevant Oregon authorities. I would adhere to earlier state authority on the basis of <em>stare decisis.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b52-8\">\n<em>Defendants\u2019 Argument</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b52-9\">Defendants concede that these are \u201copen fields\u201d cases. They contend that the trial court erred in failing to follow \u201cexisting Oregon law regarding the \u2018open fields\u2019 issue.\u201d They argue that the evidence in this case must be suppressed if the area in which the marijuana was growing was a \u201cconstitutionally protected area\u201d and that the test to determine whether the area is constitutionally protected is \u201cwhether the defendants had a reasonable expectation of privacy in such area.\u201d Thus, defendants ask this court to conduct a Katz-type analysis under Article I, section 9, which <em>Walle </em>suggests is the proper approach. The problem with their argument is that <em>Katz </em>did not modify <em>Hester\u2019s </em>\u201copen fields\u201d rule.</p>\n<p id=\"b52-10\">Defendants\u2019 reliance on <em>State v. Walle, supra, </em>and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"21\">*21</page-number><em>State v. Carter/Burton </em>54 Or App 852, 856, 636 P2d 460 (1981), is misplaced. Those cases were decided under the Fourth Amendment, <em>see State v. Russo, supra </em>n 5, 68 Or App at 764 n 1, and, thus, they are superceded by <em>Oliver v. United States, supra. </em>They are not authority for defendants\u2019 interpretation of the Oregon Constitution.</p>\n<p id=\"b53-4\">Defendants have never argued that they were entitled to relief under Article I, section 9, because the deputies \u201ctrespassed\u201d on their land.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> The plurality provides no justification for reversing the trial court on a theory not raised in the trial court and not briefed or argued on appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b53-5\">\n<em>Similarity of Texts</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b53-6\">The \u201cdiscovery\u201d of unique individual rights in a state constitution should spring from a process that is reasonable and reasoned.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> It should also reflect an intelligent awareness and assessment of federal experience. In determining whether independent state analysis is appropriate in this case, the similarity of the state and federal texts is a good starting point for inquiry. The text of Article I, section 9, is virtually identical with the corresponding text of the Fourth Amendment. <em>See </em>n 1, <em>supra. </em>The scope of both provisions is similar. <em>State v. </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"22\">*22</page-number><em>Elkins, </em>245 Or 279, 282, 422 P2d 250 (1966). Thus, the state text provides no basis for the plurality\u2019s analysis. <em>See State v. Flores, supra, </em>280 Or at 280.</p>\n<p id=\"b54-4\">\n<em>Federal Authority</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b54-5\">In construing the Oregon Constitution, we are not bound by federal interpretations of the Fourth Amendment. <em>State v. Kennedy, supra, </em>295 Or at 265-68. We may adopt a higher standard under the Oregon Constitution than that enunciated by the United States Supreme Court. <em>State v.

There is no <em>requirement </em>that we adopt a higher standard and, if we find United States Supreme Court decisions persuasive, we are free to align ourselves with them. <em>State v.

Kennedy, supra, </em>Justice Linde explained:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b54-7\">\u201cThis court like others has high respect for the opinions of the [United States] Supreme Court, particularly when they provide insight into the origins of provisions common to the state and federal bills or rights rather than only a contemporary \u2018balance\u2019 of pragmatic considerations about which reasonable people may differ over time and among the several states.\u201d 295 Or at 267.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b54-8\"><em>See State v.

When the Oregon Supreme Court has departed from federal authority in construing Oregon\u2019s Bill of Rights, it usually has provided a <em>principled </em>reason for doing so. <em>See, e.g., State v. Henry, </em>302 Or 510, 732 P2d 9 (1987); <em>State v. Kock, </em>302 Or 29, 725 P2d 1285 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"23\">*23</page-number>(1986); <em>State v. Kessler, </em>289 Or 359, 614 P2d 94 (1980). In failing to explain in a <em>principled </em>manner its radical departure from recent federal authority directly on point, the plurality fails to show the \u201chigh respect for the opinions of the [United States] Supreme Court\u201d that our Supreme Court repeatedly has stated should be shown. <em>See, e.g., State v.

Article I, section 9, of the Oregon Constitution is virtually identical to Article I, section 11, of the Indiana Constitution.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> The Indiana Supreme Court has found that Article I, section 11, of that state\u2019s constitution is practically a reiteration of the Fourth <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"24\">*24</page-number>Amendment to the United States Constitution, <em>Applegate v. State, </em>158 Ind 119, 124, 63 NE 16 (1902), and that it is but a reaffirmance of the rights of persons as they existed at common law. <em>Carey et al v. Sheets, </em>67 Ind 375, 377 (1879). That is consistent with our Supreme Court\u2019s directive in <em>State v. Lee, supra, </em>that we construe Article I, section 9, in conformity with the common law. More importantly, the Indiana Supreme Court has held that Article I, section 11, of that state\u2019s constitution does not protect fields, woods or land some distance from a house or dwelling. <em>Williams v. State, </em>201 Ind 175, 178, 166 NE 663 (1929). That is also consistent with our Supreme Court\u2019s holding in <em>Evans </em>that \u201cthe inhibition against search and seizure does not extend to * * * open fields.\u201d 143 Or at 611.</p>\n<p id=\"b56-4\">Other states have reached the same result under their state constitutions.

Snyder, </em>278 F 650 (ND W Va 1922). The requirement that all search warrants be specific is the heart of the Fourth Amendment.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> Article I, section 9, was meant to embody the same principle as the Fourth Amendment and the state constitutions that preceded the federal Bill of Rights. <em>State v.

Thus, this case is not concerned with any of the mischief that Article I, section 9, was intended to curtail.</p>\n<p id=\"b58-7\">\n<em>Plurality Analysis</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b58-8\">The plurality asks</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b58-9\">\u201cwhether Article I, section 9, is concerned exclusively with the rights that it expressly mentions or whether it uses those <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"27\">*27</page-number>rights as tools to achieve a broader purpose.

One only needs to look back to the November, 1986, General Election when Ballot Measure 5, which would have legalized private possession and growing of marijuana for personal use, was soundly defeated at the polls, to gauge the sentiment of Oregonians toward any action, such as this, that will make the illegal production of marijuana in this state much easier. So much for the \u201cfelt necessities of the time.\u201d Holmes, <em>The Common Law </em>1.</p>\n<p id=\"b60-5\">\n<em>Policy Considerations</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b60-6\">The plurality provides no pragmatic or policy reasons demonstrating that its conclusion is reasonable. Where is the social science research documenting unique local conditions, such as widespread police misconduct infringing citizens\u2019 rights to be free from \u201cunreasonable\u201d searches and seizures, that would require a different rule under the state constitution? <em>See State v. Flores, supra, </em>280 Or at 280. There is none. The spectre of platoons of jack-booted state storm-troopers assaulting the \u201copen fields\u201d of Oregon ferreting out evidence of criminal activity is simply unreal. <em>See State v. Smith, supra, </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"29\">*29</page-number>301 Or at 699 (Oregon not a part of the country where physical brutality and violence exist).</p>\n<p id=\"b61-4\">The plurality\u2019s reference to \u201csophisticated technology and increasingly complex society which have developed in this century\u201d is a \u201cred herring.\u201d 87 Or App at 8. <em>No </em>technology was used in the challenged search.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> Further, in the context of this case, the only thing that is \u201cincreasingly complex\u201d about our society is the fact that illegal marijuana is reportedly Oregon\u2019s leading cash crop.</p>\n<p id=\"b61-5\">\n<em>Conclusion</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b61-6\">Regrettably, a plurality of this court recognizes no obligation to base constitutional <em>rationales </em>on neutral principles. It substitutes its own social theories for the plain meaning of the specific constitutional text. Its result-oriented decisional process turns appellate review into a continuing constitutional convention. One well might ask, why do we need a <em>written </em>constitution at all if judges can \u201ccreate\u201d new rights where none previously existed and where neither text, history or authority support such discoveries? I reject the substitution of some other set of values for those that may be derived from the unambiguous text of the constitution and the assumed intent of its framers and ratifiers. Although judges are free to \u201cinterpret\u201d the constitution, the people alone have the right to \u201camend\u201d it. Article XVII, Constitution of Oregon.</p>\n<p id=\"b61-7\">Unprincipled judicial activism under the state constitution invites citizens to abandon their independent state guarantees in favor of entrusting their rights to federal law. <em>See State v. Kennedy, supra, </em>295 Or at 270. It also undermines the effectiveness of state legislatures. \u201cPrivacy\u201d is not the only value in society; we must balance degrees of it against other important values. Balancing competing values is preeminently a matter for the political process, not the courts, which are a poor substitute for the Legislature when it comes to examining the pros and cons of an issue and balancing competing values. In this case, for example, the theory on which this court has based its result was never raised in the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"30\">*30</page-number>trial court or on appeal. Rather, it sprang-forth, <em>sua sponte, </em>without input from the bench or bar, or from the public.</p>\n<p id=\"b62-4\">Professor Howard, one of our nation\u2019s foremost authorities on constitutional law, has cautioned:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b62-5\">\u201cThe case for an independent role for state courts should not be read as a case for unthinking activism. No judge, state or federal, is a knight errant, whose only concern is to do good. Hence, the state judge, when presented with the invitation to develop a body of state constitutional law, should pause to consider some of the dangers and hazards that may lie along the way.\u201d Howard, <em>State Courts and Constitutional Rights in the Day of the Burger Court, supra, </em>at 873.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b62-6\">Former Chief Justice Burger has noted:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b62-7\">\u201cWith our dual system of state and federal laws, administered by parallel state and federal courts, different standards may arise in various areas. But when state courts interpret state law to require <em>more </em>than the Federal Constitution requires, the citizens of the state must be aware that they have the power to amend state law to ensure rational law enforcement. The people of Florida have now done so with respect to Art I, \u00a7 12, of the State Constitution; they have it within their power to do so with respect to Fla Stat \u00a7 327.56 (1981).\u201d <em>Florida v.

The distinction implies that only the curtilage, not the neighboring open fields, warrants the Fourth Amendment protections that attach to the home. At common law, the curtilage is the area to which extends the intimate activity associated with the \u2018sanctity of a man\u2019s home and the privacies of life,\u2019 and therefore has been considered part of home itself for Fourth Amendment purposes. Thus, courts have extended Fourth Amendment protection to the curtilage; and they have defined the curtilage, as did the common law, by reference to the factors that determine whether an individual reasonably may expect that an area immediately adjacent to the home will remain private. Conversely, <em>the common law implies, as we reaffirm today, that no expectation of privacy legitimately attaches to open </em>fields.\u201d (Emphasis supplied; footnotes and citations omitted.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b51-12\">In <em>Katz v.

But it does not follow that the right to exclude conferred by trespass law embodies a privacy interest also protected by the Fourth Amendment. To the contrary, the common law of trespass furthers a range of interests that have nothing to do with privacy and that would not be served by applying the strictures of trespass law to public officers. Criminal laws against trespass are prophylactic: they protect against intruders who poach, steal livestock and crops, or vandalize property. And the civil action of trespass serves the important function of authorizing an owner to defeat claims of prescription by asserting his own title. <em>See, e.g., </em>O. Holmes, <em>The Common Law </em>90-100,244-246 (1881). In any event, unlicensed use of property by others is presumptively unjustified, as anyone who wishes to use the property is free to bargain for the right to do so with the property owner, <em>cf. </em>R.

However, I also agree with the specially concurring opinion\u2019s criticism of the \u201canalysis\u201d offered by the plurality which, I believe, incorrectly assumes that we are presented with an open slate. Furthermore, I am seriously concerned about the removal of all notions of <em>reasonableness, </em>which has historically been the touchstone of Oregon search and seizure law, from the test to determine whether a search warrant is required to search real property under the circumstances of a particular case. In <em>State v. Walle, </em>52 Or App 963, 630 P2d 377 (1981), we applied the \u201creasonable expectation of privacy\u201d approach under circumstances very similar to this case. I would apply the same test here and hold that this record does not provide evidence of an objectively \u201creasonable expectation of privacy\u201d as to the land on which the marijuana was discovered, even assuming that it is possible to manifest a constitutionally protected privacy interest in an open field.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Accordingly, I respectfully dissent.</p>\n<p id=\"b63-6\">The reasonable expectation of privacy test, as applied in <em>State v. Walle, supra, </em>is derived from Justice Harlan\u2019s concurrence in <em>Katz v. United States, </em>389 US 347, 361, 88 S Ct 507, 19 L Ed 2d 576 (1967). As he explained it, a \u201creasonable expectation of privacy\u201d encompasses two elements: (1) a subjective expectation of privacy that (2) is objectively reasonable. In other words, although an individual might have a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"32\">*32</page-number>subjective expectation of privacy in real property, that expectation \u2014 standing alone \u2014 is not enough to establish a constitutionally-protected privacy interest. Additionally, the individual\u2019s expectation of privacy must be objectively reasonable if it is to be one that society is willing to recognize.</p>\n<p id=\"b64-4\">With respect to real property, it is not, as the plurality holds, sufficient that the land in question is private property. Neither is it sufficient, as the special concurrence would hold, that the area is protected from public view by virtue of its topography or vegetation. In order to establish a constitutionally protected privacy interest, the owner of land must, at the very least, in some way affirmatively demonstrate that the public is not welcome on the land. Commonly employed means of conveying that message include erecting fences<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> and posting \u201cNo Trespassing\u201d signs. Both actions imply one message: KEEP OUT! Defendants did nothing that would convey the kind of message that would assert a claim to privacy. Surely, \u201cNo Hunting\u201d signs, such as they did post, do not say that hikers or other nonhunters are unwelcome. Similarly, making access roads impassable to motor vehicles is not evidence of an intent to deter foot traffic. As one officer testified, he had no intention of trespassing on the Dixson property. Rather, because there were no barriers to his free passage, he reasonably assumed that he was still on the property owned by Rogge Lumber Company.</p>\n<p id=\"b64-5\">Therefore, I would hold, under the facts of this case, that these defendants did not objectively manifest a reasonable expectation of privacy in the property searched, regardless of what might have been going on in their collective heads. It is unnecessary to sail into uncharted waters by formulating a new, untested constitutional analysis, as the' plurality and special concurrence have done. It is also unnecessary to determine, as Judge Van Hoomissen would, whether there is an open fields \u201cexception\u201d to Article I, section 9, of the Oregon Constitution, analogous to that under the federal Fourth Amendment.</p>\n<judges id=\"b64-6\">Deits, J., joins in this dissent.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b63-8\"> It may be that it is impossible to establish an objectively reasonable expectation of privacy in an open field.
