The point is not well taken. The information charges the crime in the language of the statute, and is sufficient. (Penal Code, \u00a7 459; <em>People </em>v. <em>Shaber, </em>32 Cal. 36; <em>People </em>v. <em>Martin, </em>id. 91; <em>People </em>v. <em>Cronin, </em>34 id. 191.)</p>\n<p id=\"b388-15\">The objection that the evidence is insufficient to justify the verdict can not be sustained. There is no doubt from the evidence that a burglary was committed, and the circumstances proved were sufficient to justify the jury in finding the defendant guilty of the crime.</p>\n<p id=\"b388-16\">There is nothing in the case to call for a-reversal of the judgment, and the same, as well as the orders denying defendant\u2019s motion in arrest of judgment, and for a new trial, are affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
