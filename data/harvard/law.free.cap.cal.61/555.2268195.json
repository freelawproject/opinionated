But before service of the complaint of intervenor, plaintiff and defendant proceeded to try the issues between them, which was doubtless irregular unless the attempt to intervene was <em>void.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b578-8\">Without admitting that the jurisdiction of the Superior Court with respect to the matter of intervention is, in the strict sense, statutory and limited, even if this much should be admitted, the Court below acquired jurisdiction by the order permitting, the intervenor to become a party. A person may intervene before the trial. (C. C. P., 387.) An intervention \u201c takes place <em>when </em>the order is made permitting such person to become a party.\u201d (Id.) The complaint in intervention is filed when \u201c leave of the Court\u201d is granted, which necessarily precedes its service.</p>\n<p id=\"b578-9\">Of course when the complaint in intervention is filed (by leave of the Court) a trial before its service on the party against whom the intervenor asserts an adverse claim is premature; but an erroneous procedure in that regard does not involve any question of jurisdiction.</p>\n<p id=\"b578-10\">Demurrer sustained.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
