Canfield, </em>for Appellant, on petition for hearing in bank.</p>\n<p data-order=\"30\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b671-8\">A collateral security is not assignable without the obligation for which it is held as security, and an instrument or agreement purporting to effect such an assignment is a nullity. In <em>Peters </em>v. <em>Jamestown Bridge Co., </em>5 Cal. 336, the Court, considering the question whether a conveyance of all the grantor\u2019s right, title, and interest in lands could operate as an assignment of a mortgage\" of those lands held by him, say: \u201c The deed from Perry to plaintiff could not operate as an assignment of the mortgage. The latter is a mere security for the debt, and can not pass without a transfer of the debt.\u201d</p>\n<p data-order=\"31\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b671-9\">This doctrine is reaffirmed in <em>Nagle </em>v. <em>Macy, </em>9 Cal. 428. Justice Field,delivering the opinion of the Court, says: \u201c The debt and the mortgage are inseparable; the latter must follow the former. As distinct from the debt, the mortgage has no determinate value and is not the subject of transfer.\u201d These cases, which state the law for California, rest upon the doctrine that the mortgage does not convey an estate in the land, but is a mere security for the debt, and stands in the same relation to the debt as any other security; they are, therefore, applicable to the case at bar.</p>\n<p data-order=\"32\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b671-10\">In <em>Polhemus </em>v. <em>Trainer, </em>30 Cal. 688, the Court say: \u201cIndependent of the debt, the mortgage has no assignable quality. It always abides with the debt, and does not pass unless the debt itself be assigned. An assignment of the mortgage without the debt is a nullity.\u201d In New York the assignment of a mortgage without the bond for which it is security, is a nullity. <em>(Cooper </em>v. <em>Newland, </em>17 Abb. Pr. 342.)</p>\n<p data-order=\"33\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b671-11\">In <em>Van Eman </em>v. <em>Stanchfield et al., </em>13 Minn. 75, the action was by an assignee of a promissory note, to recover the amount of, the note and interest. This note had been assigned to plaintiff by one to whom it had been assigned as a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"650\">*650</page-number>collateral security for a debt, and plaintiff took it under circumstances which made it subject to the rights or equities of any other party thereto; but the debt for which it had been held as security was not assigned to plaintiff. The defendant had judgment, and an order refusing a new trial was sustained on appeal, the Court holding that \u201c the lien or special property which the pawnee has in the pawn, is by reason of his ownership of the debt, for which he holds it as security. He can not, therefore, separate the lien from the debt, so-that the chose in action may be owned by one man, and the lien held by another. The lien is not a distinct and independent right of property, capable of being transferred- or assigned. The plaintiff, not showing himself owner of the debt, therefore failed to establish his title to the collateral\u201d</p>\n<p data-order=\"34\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b672-5\">And in this case it was held to make no difference that defendants had entered into a special agreement to pay the note to plaintiff\u2019s assignor. That agreement was to be construed as binding defendant to pay to plaintiff\u2019s assignor, as the person authorized to collect the note, by reason of his special property in it, as the security for the performance of another obligation. So in the case at bar; defendant\u2019s obligation to pay Hayman was only as he was entitled to have Hammell\u2019s interest in the pledged notes as a collateral security, and it follows that the attempted transfer of this interest to plaintiff was a nullity, and that plaintiff never acquired an interest in the pledged notes on which he could recover.</p>\n<p data-order=\"35\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b672-6\">If Hayman should pay the notes signed for Hammell\u2019s accommodation, and should assign his claim against Hammell for the advances to a stranger, this stranger would have a right to avail himself of the security which Hayman had held, and might bring an action against this defendant, to which the assignment of the collateral to Newell, and the judgment obtained by him in this action, would be no defense. <em>(Betz </em>v. <em>Heebner, </em>1 Pa. St. 280 ; and cited U. S. Dig., 1st series, vol. 1; p. 791, par. 544.)</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"36\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b672-7\">The Court:</author>\n<p id=\"b672-8\">The assignment from Hammell to Hayman transferred the legal title to the former\u2019s interest in the notes pledged to plaintiff\u2019s testator\u2014being Hammell\u2019s property in the excess <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"651\">*651</page-number>of the amount collected from the notes pledged beyond the indebtedness due from Hammell to the pledgee, with the right to sue for the whole of such excess. The assignment was made to secure Hayman against a contingent liability upon certain other notes which he had signed for the accommodation of Hammell, and contemplated advances; Hayman agreeing to pay Hammell all \u201c the proceeds of the said notes herein sold to him, after deducting therefrom the amount of said Sexton\u2019s claim and the amount which said Hayman shall actually pay at any time upon said-two notes upon which he is joint maker with said Hammell as aforesaid.\u201d It seems plain it was intended the interest of Hammell in the notes pledged should pass to Hayman, the former relying upon the promise of the latter that he would properly account; a promise which can be enforced when plaintiff shall have recovered his judgment in the present action.</p>\n<p id=\"b673-5\">Judgment affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
