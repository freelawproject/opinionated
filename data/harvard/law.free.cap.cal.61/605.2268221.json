Vanclief, </em>for Appellants.</p>\n<p data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b628-8\">The statement, on which alone the motion for new trial was. made, contains no specification of any error in law or fact as to the defendant Morgan, and, therefore, as to, him should have been \u201cdisregarded on the hearing of the motion.\u201d (C. C. P, \u00a7 659.)</p>\n<p data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b628-9\">This statute is mandatory. <em>(Partridge </em>v. <em>San Francisco, </em>27 Cal. 416; <em>Hidden </em>v. <em>Jordan, </em>28 id. 312; <em>Zenith G. &amp; S. M. Co. </em>v. <em>Irvine, </em>32 id. 303; <em>Martin </em>v. <em>Matfield, </em>49 id. 43; <em>Coleman </em>v. <em>Gilmore, </em>id. 340; <em>Smith </em>v. <em>Christian, </em>47 id. 19; <em>Doherty </em>v. <em>Enterprise M. Co., </em>50 id. 187; <em>Eddelbuttel </em>v. <em>Durrell, </em>55 id. 277.)</p>\n<p data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b628-10\">As to J. D. R. Stewart, against whom there was a verdict for plaintiff, with fifty dollars damages, the only ground upon which the new trial could have been granted, was insufficiency of the damages, as that is the only ground specified in the statement. There was no eviden\u00f3e by which any actual damage could have been estimated or measured by the rule of compensation. Therefore, under the general rule adopted by our Civil Code (Sec. 3274), making compensation the proper measure of damages, no more than nominal damages could have been found.</p>\n<p data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b628-11\">The only exception to this general rule is that contained in Section 3294 of the Civil Code: \u201c Where the defendant has <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"607\">*607</page-number>been guilty of oppression,\u201d etc., which, as a rule of law, simply defines the class of cases in which exemplary damages \u201cmay\u201d be given; but furnishes no measure by which they may be ascertained, except the honest, unbiased judgment of the jury; hence, there can be no ground for inteference by the Court, except that the verdict \u201cis the obvious result of passion, prejudice, or corruption.\u201d (Sedgw. on Dam. (6th ed.) 661, and note; Id. 570; <em>Dorsey </em>v. <em>Manlove, 14 </em>Cal. <em>554.) </em>In actions of tort, \u201cthe general rule is, that a new trial will not be granted for smallness of damages.\u201d (Sedgw. on Dam. (6th ed.) 766.)</p>\n<p data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b629-5\"><em>G. F. &amp; W. H. Sharp </em>and <em>John L. Love, </em>for Respondent.</p>\n<p data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b629-6\">The second, third, and fifth specifications are sufficient to include Morgan. The verdict of the jury was certainly irregular in this, that it did not find on the issue raised, by plaintiffs complaint and Morgan\u2019s answer.</p>\n<p data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b629-7\">The verdict of the jury should have been vacated, and a new trial granted by the Court on its own motion, without the application of either party, because there was a plain disregard by the jury of the instructions of the Court and the evidence in the case, and because the' verdict was rendered under the influence of passion and prejudice, and under a misapprehension of the instructions of the Court. (Code of Civ. Proa, \u00a7 662.) \u201c Damages must in all cases be reasonable.\u201d (Civil Code, \u00a7 3359.) The jury should have rendered exemplary damages. (Id., \u00a7 3294; Sedg. on Dam. (5th ed.) 710; <em>Richards </em>v. <em>Rose, </em>24 Eng. L. &amp; Eq. 406; <em>Richards </em>v. <em>Sanford, 2 </em>E. D. Smith,(N.Y.) 349; <em>Collins </em>v. <em>Albany &amp; Schenectady R.

Co., </em>19 Id. 461; Hilliard on New Trials, 574, c. 17, Sec. 27 (2d ed.); <em>Levi </em>v. <em>Milne, 4 </em>Bing. 195; <em>Mariani </em>v. <em>Dougherty, </em>46 Cal. 26 ; <em>Bacot </em>v. <em>Keith, 2 </em>Bay, 466.)</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b629-8\">McKinstry, J. :</author>\n<p id=\"b629-9\">The appeal is from an order, granting a new trial, by defendants J. D. R. Stewart and James Morgan.</p>\n<p id=\"b629-10\">No verdict was rendered by the jury for or against the defendant Morgan. \u201cA new trial is a re-examination of an issue of fact in the same Court after a trial and <em>decision </em>by <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"608\">*608</page-number>a jury, or Court, or by referees.\u201d (C. C. P., \u00a7 656.) It may be that there was a mistrial, or no trial, as to defendant Morgan, and that the Court below may hereafter proceed to try the case as to him; but there was no cause for a motion for a <em>new </em>trial, or for an application to <em>vacate </em>the <em>former verdict. </em>(C. C. P\u201e \u00a7 657.)</p>\n<p id=\"b630-5\">The notice of motion for new trial is not set forth in the transcript. At the end of the statement on motion for new trial is what purports to be an \u201cAssignment of Errors.\u201d The first assignment has no relation to the case of either of the appellants. The second is, \u201c Irregularity in the proceedings of the jury, and misconduct of the jury,\u201d etc. When the motion for new trial is made on these grounds, it must be made upon \u201c affidavits.\u201d (C. C. P., \u00a7 648.) In the present case the motion is not supported by any affidavit purporting to set forth facts constituting irregularity or misconduct, within the meaning of these words as used in subdivisions one and two of Section 657.</p>\n<p id=\"b630-6\">The third assignment of plaintiff is. \u201c Nominal and insufficient damages, appearing to have been given by the jury under the influence of passion and prejudice.\u201d Section 657 provides that a new trial may be granted for the cause of \u201c excessive damages, appearing to have been given under the influence of passion or prejudice.\u201d But there is no provision which authorizes the setting aside of a finding because of the \u201c passion or prejudice\u201d of a jury, exhibited by the rendition of a verdict for insufficient damages; and as the whole matter is statutory, the last is not proper as an independent ground for setting aside a verdict.</p>\n<p id=\"b630-7\">It may be, that, under the fifth statutory ground for a new trial\u2014\u201c insufficiency of the evidence to justify the verdict\u201d\u2014 a party might urge that a jury found against the evidence in finding a less sum than the evidence established as the amount of damages sustained. But in such case the \u201c statement must specify the particulars in which the evidence is alleged to be insufficient,\u201d and where (as is the case before us) no such specifications are made, the statement \u201c must be disregarded.\u201d (C. C. P., \u00a7 659.)</p>\n<p id=\"b630-8\">The fourth and fifth assignments seem to be based upon the last clause of the sixth subdivision of Section 657 of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"609\">*609</page-number>Code of Civil Procedure; that the verdict \u201c is against law,\u201d in that the jury did not obey the instructions of the Court in regard to damages. As we understand the case no specific damage was proven. Certain injuries to the person of plaintiff were proved, and the Court charged the jury as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b631-5\">\u201c The proper amount of damages in case of an assault and battery generally depends much upon the aggravating or mitigating circumstances connected with it. The elements of damages in ordinary cases may be thus summarized:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b631-6\">\u201c 1. Loss of time and labor from the date of the injury until the party recovers therefrom.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b631-7\">\u201c 2. The expense of medical, surgical, and other attendants, and the value of clothing injured or destroyed.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b631-8\">\u201c 8. Diminished capacity to work at the trade or business of the party injured.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b631-9\">\u201c 4. Bodily pain and mental anguish.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b631-10\">\u201c The damages may also include a fair compensation for injuries actually sustained by the battery, including probable future disability and suffering.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b631-11\">\u201c If the act was wanton or reckless, or the defendant was actuated by malice, or perpetrated the wrong in total disregard of the law, and the plaintiff was in no way to blame, the plaintiff should recover not only for the pecuniary losses sustained, but for his mental anxiety, public degradation, and the wounded sensibility which an honorable man might be supposed to feel for a violation of the sacredness of his person; for pains to the feelings as well as to the body; and in addition thereto, exemplary or vindictive damages, in the discretion of the jury, as an example and punishment, where such damages are recognized as proper.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b631-12\">There was no evidence as to the money value of the loss of time or labor by plaintiff; or of any expenses for medical attendance, etc.; or of any diminished capacity to work.</p>\n<p id=\"b631-13\">For these things, then, the jury could assume, only, that nominal damages had been suffered. The jury were told, also, that plaintiff was entitled to recover \u201cfor bodily pain and mental anguish,\u201d etc., and further, if the assault was \u201cwanton or reckless,\u201d etc., exemplary or vindictive damages.</p>\n<p id=\"b631-14\">The jury may have considered the bodily pain and mental <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"610\">*610</page-number>anguish unimportant factors in the assessment, and while we may believe that the jury should have found a larger verdict, we cannot say they disregarded the instructions of the Court (even if we assume <em>the fads </em>to show express malice), since, for aught that appears, they did find something by way of exemplary or vindictive damages.</p>\n<p id=\"b632-3\">Order reversed and cause remanded.</p>\n<p id=\"b632-4\">Eoss and McKee, JJ., concurred.</p>\n<p id=\"b632-5\">After the foregoing decision was rendered, a rehearing was had in bank, upon which the following decision was rendered:</p>\n<author id=\"b632-6\">The Court:</author>\n<p id=\"b632-7\">We are satisfied with the views expressed by Department One of this Court in its opinion in this case, filed March 20, 1882 (9 Pac. C. L. J. 273), and for the reasons therein given the order appealed from is reversed and the cause is remanded.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
