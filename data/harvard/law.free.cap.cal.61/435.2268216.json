His plea confessed the previous conviction of petit \u2022larceny, but was \u201cnot guilty\u201d to the charge of robbery. At the trial he exercised ten peremptory challenges, and after-wards interposed a like challenge to another juror, which the Court below refused to allow. This was an error demanding the reversal of the judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b458-9\">The only punishment that could be imposed on the defendant upon his conviction was imprisonment for life (Penal Code, \u00a7\u00a7 667-671); and in such cases the defendant is entitled to twenty peremptory challenges.
