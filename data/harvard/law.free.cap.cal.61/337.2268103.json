Subsequently, on objection of the respondent to the justification, on the ground that the Court Commissioner had not taken the oath of office, the Court ordered the sureties to appear and justify before the Court, which was done accordingly.</syllabus>\n<syllabus data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b359-8\"><em>Held: </em>The action of the Superior Court with reference to the justification of the sureties, was clearly within its jurisdiction.</syllabus>\n<syllabus data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b359-9\">Id.\u2014Substitution of New Undertaking on Appeal\u2014Case Distin<em>guished.\u2014McCoriky </em>v. <em>Superior Court, </em>56 Cal. 84, distinguished.</syllabus>\n<summary data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b359-10\">Application for writ of prohibition.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b359-11\">The facts with regard to the justification of sureties were, substantially, as stated in the syllabus.</summary>\n<p data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b359-12\"><em>Gray &amp; Hall, </em>for Petitioner.</p>\n<p data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b359-13\"><em>John W.

In <em>McConky </em>v. <em>The Superior Court, 55 </em>Cal. 84, no undertaking for costs on appeal had been filed either in the Justice\u2019s or Superior Court; nevertheless, the latter Court was proceeding to hear the appeal. Prohibition issued, this Court saying: \u201c Whether a proper undertaking for the payment of costs on appeal may be substituted in the Superior Court for one insufficient in form filed with the Justice, is not a question which the exigencies of this case demand of us to decide.\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"338\">*338</page-number>(56 Cal. 84.) In the case now before us the Superior Court permitted the appellant to file an undertaking in lieu of the undertaking insufficient in form. It was held by the Supreme Court of this State prior to the passage of the Act in terms authorizing the substitution (Stats. 1861, p. 589), that an appellant might file a new undertaking in place of one held insufficient in the Appellate Court. <em>(Stark </em>v. <em>Barrett, </em>15 Cal. 360.) And this under a statute like Section 978 of the Code of Civil Procedure. (Practice Act of 1851, \u00a7 348.)</p>\n<p id=\"b360-4\">With respect to a question of practice, like that here presented, we do not feel authorized, at this late day, to disturb a ruling intended to assist parties to a hearing in the appellate Court. The action of the Superior Court with reference to the <em>justification of sureties </em>was clearly within its jurisdiction.</p>\n<p id=\"b360-5\">Demurrer sustained and proceeding dismissed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
