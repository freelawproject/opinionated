The following are the facts:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b521-6\">It was conceded that Joseph Galloway, on the twentieth of November, 1852, was seised in fee of the demanded premises. On that day he conveyed them to William M. Muir, who, on the twenty-second day of November, 1852, conveyed them to his mother, Jane T. Galloway. Mrs. Galloway died on the eleventh of April, 1865, leaving surviving Joseph Galloway, hp,r husband; the plaintiff, William W. Muir, her son by a former husband, and Joseph W. Galloway, a son by her surviving husband. It was further conceded that upon the death of his mother, the plaintiff became entitled under the statute of descents and distributions of this State, to an undivided one third of the demanded premises, as tenant in common with Joseph Galloway, his step-father, and Joseph W. Galloway, his half-brother; that the plaintiff derives title under Jane T. Galloway, his mother, and his right to recover was made out on the trial, unless the title of Mrs. Galloway was divested by her own act in her life-time, in conveying it away or his right to recover has been lost by lapse of time.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b521-7\">The contention of the defendants was, that Jane T. Galloway did not die seised of the demanded premises, and on the trial to show that she had parted with her title; they offered in evidence a deed executed by herself and Joseph Galloway, her husband, conveying the premises to Mathew H. Furman, who afterwards, on the fourteenth day of March, 1854, conveyed the same to Joseph Galloway.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b521-8\">Joseph Galloway died on the twentieth day of July, 1877, and his son, Joseph W., entered into the possession of the demanded premises. This action was commenced against him in October, 1877, and pending it he died, and his widow, Annie B. Galloway, was. appointed administratrix, and thereafter was regularly substituted as one of the defendants.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b521-9\">When the defendants offered to read in evidence the deed <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"500\">*500</page-number>of Galloway and wife, Jane T., to Furman the plaintiff objected on the ground that the certificate of acknowledgment was defective in that it did not show that the wife' was examined without the hearing of her husband.

The case was tried before a jury; the verdict being rendered for the plaintiff on the twentieth day of October, 1880. In due time thereafter, and upon the twenty-ninth day of October, 1880, the defendants filed with the clerk and served on the plaintiff\u2019s attorney a notice of their intention to move for a new trial of this action, designating therein the grounds upon which the motion would be made, and stating that the same would be made upon affidavits, and upon a statement of the case.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b522-11\">On November 8, 1880,.the Judge extended the defendants\u2019 time to prepare and serve proposed statement on motion for a new trial ten days. On November 18th the time to prepare and serve their proposed statement as aforesaid was extended by the Judge ten days. \u2022</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b522-12\">November '28th was Sunday. November 27, 1880, the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"501\">*501</page-number>Judge made an order allowing defendants ten days further time from November 29, 1880, within which to prepare and serve their proposed statement as aforesaid.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b523-5\">On the ninth of December, 1880, the defendants prepared a draft of their statement to be used on the hearing of said motion for a new trial, and served said draft of statement on the plaintiff\u2019s attorney, who thereupon gave a receipt; but without waiver as to the time of service.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"21\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b523-6\">The statement was afterwards settled and allowed by the Judge of the Court below, the plaintiff\u2019s attorney insisting upon his objection as to the .time of the service of the same. Defendants\u2019 motion for a new trial was then heard and denied. After the decision in department a petition for hearing in bank was presented and denied.</summary>\n<p data-order=\"22\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b523-7\"><em>James C. Cary, </em>for Appellants.</p>\n<p data-order=\"23\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b523-8\">It was error in the Court to reject the deed offered. The words employed are of the same import and signification as the words omitted.</p>\n<p data-order=\"24\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b523-9\">When the officer certified that the wife, \u201con a private examination, separate and apart from her husband,\u201d acknowledged the deed, he substantially certified that the examination was had \u201cwithout the hearing of her husband,\u201d and the certificate is good, being in substantial conformity to the statute. This requirement of\u201d the law for a separate examination of the wife is not of modern invention. We first meet with it in fines and recoveries. \u201cIf there be,\u201d says Blackstone, (2 Shars. Black, p. 350) \u201cany <em>feme covert </em>among the cognizors or parties levying, the fine, she is privately examined whether she does it willingly and freely, or by compulsion of her husband.\u201d Or, as he expresses it in another place, where a married woman conveys by fine or like matter of record, \u201cshe must be secretly examined to learn if her act be voluntary.\u201d \u201c The examination,\u201d says Lord Coke (2 Coke-Litt. Sec. 669), \u201cof <em>a, feme covert </em>ought to be secret, and the effect is to examine her whether she be content to levie a fine of such lands of her owne voluntary will, and not by threats, menaces, or any compulsorie meanes.\u201d</p>\n<p data-order=\"25\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b523-10\">\u201c While the requirements of every law,\u201d said the Court in <em>Canal Co. </em>v. <em>Russell, </em>68 111. 431, \u201cmust be substantially ob<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"502\">*502</page-number>served, this in regard to acknowledgments of conveyances by <em>femes covert </em>has. long been considered by the profession and the general public as inconvenient and absurd; and so disgusted with it had the public become that by an Act in force .July 1,1872, the people acting by their representatives in the General Assembly, annulled the obnoxious and cumbersome and unnecessary .requirements of former statutes.\u201d</p>\n<p data-order=\"26\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b524-5\">Although the form of the certificate is thus exactly prescribed in set phrase it has never been held necessary to adhere to the exact words of the form given. \u201cI do not take a literal, strict adherence to the very words of the Act,\u201d said the Court in <em>Watson </em>v. Bailey, 2 Binney, 470, \u201cto be essentially necessary in. these ..cases, but the substantial\u2019 requisites by which the rights of married women were intended to be guarded by the Legislature, should be pursued.\u201d</p>\n<p data-order=\"27\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b524-6\">As to the sufficiency of the certificate he also cited: <em>Henderson v</em>. <em>Grewell, </em>8. Cal. 581; <em>Webster </em>v. <em>Hall, </em>2 Har. &amp; McH. 19; S. C., 1 Am. Dec. 370; <em>Canal Dock Co. </em>v. <em>Russell, </em>68 Ill. 436; <em>Gregory </em>v. <em>Ford, </em>5 B.

The form of the certificate in debate.here has been sanctioned by common usage from the passage of the Act concerning conveyances, in the year 1850, down to. the year 1856, two years after the date of the certificate, in question. The. Court will take notice of this usage. <em>(McKeen </em>v. <em>Delancy, </em>5 Cranch. pp. 22, 27, 28; <em>Troup </em>v. <em>Haight, </em>Hopk. 272.)</p>\n<p data-order=\"29\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b524-8\">It amounts to a practical construction of the law and may be properly alluded to as resting upon matter of record and upon a practice of public notoriety. (See <em>Jackson </em>v. <em>Gumaer, </em>2, Cow. 567; <em>McFerran </em>v. <em>Powers, </em>1 Serg. &amp; R. 105.)</p>\n<p data-order=\"30\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b524-9\">The statement was filed in time. The Judge gave thirty <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"503\">*503</page-number>days and the law\" gave one by excluding Sunday the 28th. Section 1054, O. C. P., provides that the Judge may extend the time to file a statement on motion for a new trial, thirty days in addition to that allowed by law, and Section 12 of the same Code provides that the time in which an act is to be done, is computed by excluding the first day and including the last, unless the last day is a holiday and then it is also excluded.</p>\n<p data-order=\"31\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b525-5\">It is claimed, however, that it is only when the last day of the thirty, which the Court or Judge may grant, falls on a Sunday, that it is excluded, that if it falls on .any intervening Sunday of the thirty days, say the last day of an order extending the time less than thirty days, it must be included in computing the thirty days. This contraction of Sections 12 and 1054 C. G. P., is altogether too narrow and technical.</p>\n<p data-order=\"32\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b525-6\">If the Judge under Section 1054 may grant thirty days as an entirety, he may of course grant any number of days less than thirty. The real point then is as to the construction of an order granting ten days where the last day for performance falls on Sunday. Under the order dated the 18th, the defendants had all of Monday, the 29th, to file the statement, thus excluding Sunday the 28th and the tenth day, from the count, as no day for any legal purpose. \u201cSunday,\u201d said Gould, J,. in <em>Avery </em>v. <em>Stewart, </em>2 Conn. 69, \u201ccan not for the performance of a contract or the exercise of a legal right be regarded as a day in law, and for that purpose should be considered as stricken from the calender.\u201d It occupies no space of time in law.</p>\n<p data-order=\"33\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b525-7\">If excluded in computing the ten days allowed by the judge, as it certainly must be, why should it be included in the count of the thirty days which the judge is authorized to grant. If excluded in construing the order of the judge, why should it be included in counting the thirty, and thus make null the order of extension ? If disregarded as a legal day for one purpose why not for all ? If excluded in counting the ten days extension, clearly it should be excluded in computing the thirty days which the judge was authorized to grant.</p>\n<p data-order=\"34\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b525-8\">The law, not the judge, gave this extra day by excluding it from the computation of the ten days allowed by the order. If the law then excluded Sunday the 28th as no day, as if <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"504\">*504</page-number>\u201cstricken from the calendar,\u201d the judge had the right under Section 1054, O. O. P., to grant ten days exclusive of it from Monday the 29th to file the statement. The judge in fact granted no more than thirty days, that is he gave three extensions of ten days each; the law allowed one day and the statement was filed within the thirty days, Sunday the 29th being excluded from the reckoning.</p>\n<p data-order=\"35\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b526-5\">Section 659, Subd. 3 of O. C. P., provides that a party desiring to move for a new trial must within ten days after service of the notice, \u201cor such further time as the Court or Judge may allow, prepare a draft of the statement and serve the same or a copy thereof upon the adverse party.\u201d</p>\n<p data-order=\"36\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b526-6\">Section 1054 C. C. P., provides that \u201cwhen an act to be done as provided in this Code relates to * * * the preparation of statements, * * * or to the service of notices, other than of appeal, the time allowed by this Code may be extended, upon good cause shown, by the Court or Judge, * * * but such extension shall not exceed thirty days, without the consent of the adverse party.\u201d The extension, altogether, can not exceed thirty days under this Section. <em>(Bryan </em>v. <em>Maume, </em>28 Cal. 238.)</p>\n<p data-order=\"37\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b526-9\">Section, 12 C. C. P. provides: \u201cThe time in which any act provided by law is to be done is computed by excluding the first day and including the-last; unless the last day is a holiday, and then it is also excluded.\u201d The Judge can not, under section 1054, make any order which would operate to extend the time more than thirty days in the aggregate. Otherwise, he could, by orders, increase the time to thirty-five days, in the -following manner: Suppose that on the eighth day of November, 1880, the judge had extended the time six days, which would expire on Sunday, the 14th; and on the next day, Monday, the 15th, by another order he extends the time six days, which would expire on Sunday, the 21st; on Monday, the 22d, by still another order the judge again extends the time six days, which would expire on Sunday, the 28th; and on Monday, the 29th, by a further order, he extends the time six days, which would expire on Sunday, the fifth day of December; and on Monday, the sixth day of December, he grants another extension of six days, which would, if every Sunday of the interim is to be considered a last <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"505\">*505</page-number>day, subvert the obvious intention of the statute, by increasing the limit of extension from thirty to thirty-five days, and an attorney could in any case secure thirty-five instead of thirty. There can not be five last days in the thirty days extension contemplated by Section 1054, in the sense in which \u201c last day \u201d is used in Section 12, C. O. P.</p>\n<p data-order=\"38\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b527-5\">As to the insufficiency of the certificate of acknowledgment. In <em>McLeran </em>v. <em>Benton, </em>48 Cal. 472, referring to the acknowledgment of Foley and wife to Brannan and others, ruled upon in <em>Ewald </em>v. <em>Corbett, </em>32 Cal. 493, the Court says: \u201cIt is not certified therein that she was examined by the Notary without the hearing of her husband, nor that she was made acquainted by the Notary with the contents of the instrument. In each of these respects the acknowledgment is radically defective. The decision in <em>Ewald </em>v. <em>Corbett, </em>is fully sustained by numerous decisions of this Court and we are satisfied beyond a doubt of its correctness. We expressly affirm that case on this point because the Judge of the District Court after having excluded the deed when offered in evidence stated when he came to the decision of the cause that he excluded from consideration both the agreement and the deed, though he was of the opinion that the decision of that point in <em>Ewald </em>v. <em>Corbett, </em>was incorrect.\u201d</p>\n<p data-order=\"39\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b527-6\">Were it proper to go outside of the settled law of this Court, a careful examination of the different cases in other States cited by appellants will clearly show that the instances, in which some words were held to be of the same import and signification with those omitted in the certificates therein referred to, are entirely different from the certificate under discussion. And notably in the case of <em>Deery </em>v. <em>Cray.</em></p>\n<p data-order=\"40\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b527-7\">The Court in effect there holds that privately examined, separate and apart, are equivalent in that case to \u201c out of the presence,\u201d but were not equivalent to \u201cout of the hearing of.\u201d See also <em>Leonis </em>v. Lazzarovich, 55 Cal. 52; <em>Barrett </em>v. <em>Tewksbury, </em>9 id. 14.</p>\n<p data-order=\"41\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b527-8\"><em>L. E.

C. P. 1,054.) The last day of the period of extension fixed by one of the orders being Sunday, it should be \u201c excluded.\u201d (CF. C. P. 12.) That is to say, it is not. to be computed as any portion of the time granted by the order, but is a supplementary day superadded by law.</p>\n<p id=\"b528-5\">2. The acknowledgment by Mrs. Jane T. Galloway of the execution of her deed of March 13,1854, is in words and figures following:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b528-6\">\u201c State of California, ) City and County of San Francisco, j ss\"</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b528-8\">\u201c On this thirteenth day of March, A.

Grant,</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b528-11\">\u201c Notary Public.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AYI\">When the acknowledgment was taken the Act \u201cconcerning conveyances,\u201d of April 6, 1850, was in force. (Stats. 1850, 249.) The 23d section of that Act reads as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b528-13\">\u201c The certificate shall be in the form, heretofore given, and shall set forth that such married woman waspersonally known to tifie, officer granting the same, to be the person whose name is subscribed to such conveyance as a party thereto, or was proved to be such by a credible witness, whose name shall be inserted in the certificate, and that she was made acquainted with the contents of such conveyance, and acknowledged, on examination apart from and without the hearing of her hus<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"507\">*507</page-number>band, that she executed the same freely and voluntarily, without fear or compulsion, or undue influence of her husband, and that she does not wish to retract the execution of the same. Every certificate which <em>substantially conforms </em>to the requirements of this Act shall he valid.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b529-4\">The only departure from the form prescribed by the statute in the acknowledgment, necessary to be considered, consists in the substitution of the words \u201con a private examination separate and apart from her husband,\u201d for \u201c on an examination apart from and <em>without the hearing </em>of her husband.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b529-5\">The \u201cexamination\u201d mentioned in the statute and acknowledgment means an inquiry in response to which the married woman shall declare that she has executed the deed \u201cfreely and voluntarily,\u201d etc. Such an examination to be \u201cprivate\u201d must necessarily be \u201c without the hearing of her husband.\u201d But all doubts are removed by the certificate of the officer. The private examination was \u201c separate and apart from her husband.\u201d It seems to us that it would be to give a strained and unnatural signification to the words employed to say that a private examination separate and apart from the husband might have been within his hearing.</p>\n<p id=\"b529-6\">The Court below erred in sustaining the objections to the deed.</p>\n<p id=\"b529-7\">Judgment and order reversed, and cause remanded for a new trial</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
