The power to require undertakings in such cases appears to be confined to witnesses who were examined before the committing magistrate; and it is only in case of a failure to give an undertaking when legally required to do so, that the Court can commit a witness to prison. Therefore it is ordered that the petitioner be discharged.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
