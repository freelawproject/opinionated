In this respect they are not distinguishable in principle from counties.</syllabus>\n<summary data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"history\" id=\"b293-11\">Appeal from a judgment for the defendant on demurrer to complaint in the Superior Court of the County of Sacramento.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"history\" id=\"b293-12\">Judgment was entered for defendant on demurrer. The complaint was as follows:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b293-13\">\u201c Plaintiff complaining alleges that the defendant is now, and for more than three years last past has been, a municipal corporation, duly incorporated and acting as such under the laws of and in the said State and County.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b293-14\">2. That as said municipal corporation, it always has been, and at the times hereinafter mentioned was and now is, the duty of said defendant to keep and maintain in good order the sidewalks in the city limits of said defendant.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b293-15\">3. That in violation and disregard of its said duty, the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"272\">*272</page-number>defendant so'negligently, carelessly and \u00fcnskillfully kept and maintained the sidewalk on the south side of K street, between 7th and 8th streets, in the said city limits, that the plaintiff, on the sixth day of June, 1880, while passing over and along said sidewalk, as he had a right to do, without fault on his part, fell and broke through said sidewalk. That said street and sidewalk had long prior to said June 6, 1880, been graded and accepted by the Street Commissioner of defendant and by defendant.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b294-4\">4. That by reason therefore, the plaintiff became and was bruised, wounded, injured and damaged, and prevented from attending to his business for a long time, to wit: six months, and was forced to and did pay, lay out and expend a large sum of money in and about being cured of his injuries so received, to wit: about eight hundred dollars, and was so badly injured that he will never permanently recover the use of his left leg, in all sustaining damage to the amount of ten thousand dollars.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b294-5\">5. That plaintiff duly presented his claim for said damages so received to defendant, on the eleventh day of April, 1881, but to pay the same or any part thereof the defendant refused and still refuses so to do.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b294-6\">6.

A. Anderson, </em>Attorney for Respondent.</p>\n<p data-order=\"27\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b296-13\">There is a long line of decisions holding the exemption of municipalities from any implied liability. In the absence of a statutory requirement, absolute in its terms, a municipal corporation is not a general warrantor of the safe condition <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"275\">*275</page-number>of the streets within its limits. (Shearman &amp; Redfield on Negligence, Sec. 146; <em>Griffon </em>v. <em>The Mayor, etc., </em>9 N. Y. 456; <em>Howes </em>v. <em>New Orleans, </em>25 La. Ann. 394, 481; <em>Kelley </em>v. <em>Milwaukee, </em>18 Wis. 83; <em>Winbigler </em>v. <em>Los Angeles, </em>45 Cal. 36.)</p>\n<p data-order=\"28\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b297-4\">For an exhaustive review of the questions of law involved in this case we refer to. <em>(Hill </em>v. <em>City of Boston, </em>122 Mass, pp. 345 to 383. Also, <em>Eastman </em>v. <em>Meredith, </em>36 N. H. 284 to 301.) In each of these cases it was held that plaintiff could not maintain the action against the town or city.</p>\n<p data-order=\"29\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b297-5\">At common law there is no liability upon a municipal corporation for injuries received by reason of defective ways. (Shearman &amp; Redfield on Negligence, Sec. 346; Cooley on Torts, p. 622, and cases cited in Note 1; 2 Dillon, Municipal Corporations, 3d Ed., Sec. 1000.) There being no remedy against the municipality at common law, there can be no action, unless the Legislature by statute imposes a liability upon the municipality. Upon an examination of the organic law governing the City-of Sacramento, no provision is found imposing such liability. (Statutes 1863, p. 415 <em>et seq; </em>Shear-man &amp; Redfield on Negligence, \u00a7 346.)</p>\n<p data-order=\"30\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b297-6\">The owner of the lot fronting the sidewalk where the accident occurred is liable. If the owner does any act which renders the street or sidewalk hazardous or less secure than it was left by proper authorities, he commits a nuisance, and is liable therefor to any person injured in consequence of his act. (Cooley on Torts, p. 626, and cases cited in note 3.)</p>\n<p data-order=\"31\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b297-7\">The City of Sacramento is not liable. The City of Sacramento is wholly the creature of the statute, and there is nothing in the statutes of this State making it liable for negligence in the repair of its streets or sidewalks. The rule is clearly laid down in the case of <em>Winbigler </em>v. <em>Los Angeles, </em>45 Cal. 36.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"32\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b297-8\">The Court:</author>\n<p id=\"b297-9\">We do not think that this case is distinguishable in principle from <em>Winbigler </em>v. <em>Los Angeles, </em>45 Cal. 36; \"and on the authority of that case the judgment in this case must be affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b297-10\">Judgment affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
