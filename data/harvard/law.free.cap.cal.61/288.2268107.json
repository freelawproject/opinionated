Rooney, J.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b310-12\">The complaint prayed judgment for two hundred and seventy dollars damages, for the restitution of the land, and for an injunction, and the Court decreed accordingly.

But in case there should be no proceeds, and that several weeks should elapse before there should be any proceeds, then the proceeds should be applied to the back expenses, until they more than pay the expenses, and then the plaintiff is entitled to one third of the surplus, after the said back expenses are paid. We think this construction will give validity to all parts of the contract, and will do violence to no part of it. It is well settled that contracts must, if possible, be construed so as to give effect to all of its parts, and force to all the language. (2 Parsons on Con., 503-506; C. G, \u00a7\u00a7 1643, 1652.)</p>\n<p data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b311-6\">Admitting that defendants failed to pay the money every week, as they took \"it out, this was only a partial violation of the lease, and did not give the plaintiff a right to rescind the lease, or recover the property back. The conditions of the lease are independent, and are not mutual and dependent, and they are not conditions precedent. A suit can be maintained for damages, for its violation. (2 Parsons on Con. 529, 530, 531, 679, and note.)</p>\n<p data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b311-7\">In such case the plaintiff is not entitled to have the contract rescinded, but must depend upon his suit for damages, for the violation of the agreement.</p>\n<p data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b311-8\">Generally, no contract can be rescinded by one of the parties, unless both can be restored to the condition in which they were before the contract was made. (Parsons on Con. 679, notes z and a.; <em>Watts </em>v. <em>White, </em>13 Cal. 321; <em>Miller </em>v. <em>Steen, </em>30 id. 402; <em>Bohall </em>v. <em>Diller, </em>41 id. 532.)</p>\n<p data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b311-9\">Courts do not favor forfeitures, and will always give relief when exact compensation can be had by defendant to the plaintiff.

The defendants have covenanted that plaintiff may re-enter, upon failure on their part to keep the terms of the lease; and appellants\u2019 authorities, on the point that \u201c both parties must be restored to the condition in which they were before the contract was made,\u201d before the contract can be rescinded, are not in point in this case.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b312-7\">Morrison, C. J.:</author>\n<p id=\"b312-8\">Plaintiff let to the defendants a certain mine, under a written contract or lease, which contained the following clauses:</p>\n<p id=\"b312-9\">\u201c The said parties of the second part are to prospect and work the said vein, lead, or lode, in a good and workmanlike manner, with as little damage to the land for agricultural purposes as a proper mining of the same will permit, and to pay to the party of the first part, or his assigns, every week, twenty per cent, of all the gold that they may take from said vein, lead, or lode, or from the angles or spurs thereof; that they are to work the same without expense to the party of the first part, and keep the same free from any liens or incumbrances for work or labor done on, or for materials furnished for, the working of said mine; that if the parties of the second part should take, during any week, gold sufficient to more than pay for the back expenses of working the said mine, then the party of the first part is to have one third of the gold they may get from said mine after paying said working expenses.</p>\n<p id=\"b312-10\">\u201c That, if the parties of the second part fail to keep the covenants aforesaid, then the party of the first part is at liberty to take full possession of said land and premises without recourse to law, as fully, to all intents and purposes, as if this lease had not been made. In witness whereof, the said con<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"291\">*291</page-number>traeting parties have hereunto set their hands and seals, the day and year first above written.\u201d</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b313-5\">The following special issues were submitted to the jury:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b313-6\">\u201c 1. Did the plaintiff and the defendants execute the contract set forth in the complaint ?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b313-7\">\u201c Answer\u2014Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b313-8\">\u201c 2. Have the defendants, since the date of said contract, taken out any gold from the mining claim referred to in said contract ?, and, if they have, then how much have the defendants so taken out ?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b313-9\">\u201cAnswer\u2014One thousand three hundred and forty-four dollars and eighty-five cents.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b313-10\">\u201c 3. Have the defendants paid, or offered to pay, to plaintiff, any portion of the gold taken by them from said claim since the date of said contract ?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b313-11\">\u201cAnswer\u2014No.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b313-12\">\u201c 4. If the defendants have taken out any gold from the claim referred to in the complaint, at what time and during what weeks did they take the gold, and how much each week?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b313-13\">\u201cAnswer\u20141881. Don\u2019t know; but during the time, July 23d to August 27th, one thousand three hundred and forty-four dollars and eighty-five cents was taken out.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b313-14\">\u201c 5. Have defendants taken out more than sufficient, during any one week, to pay all the back working expenses ?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b313-15\">\u201cAnswer\u2014No.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b313-16\">\u201c 6. Have the defendants taken enough to pay the back expenses, including all the gold they have taken out since they have had said lease ?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b313-17\">\u201cAnswer\u2014No.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b313-18\">\u201c 7. What was the total amount of gold the defendants have taken out .since th\u00e1y have had the lease ?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b313-19\">\u201cAnswer\u2014One thousand three hundred and forty-four dollars and eighty-five cents. ,</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b313-20\">\u201c 8. What was the total amount of back working expenses of working said claim ?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b313-21\">\u201cAnswer\u2014Three thousand one hundred and forty-six dollars a.nd eighty-five cents.\u201d Judgment for plaintiff on findings, for possession of the property and two hundred and sixty-eight dollars and ninety-seven cents damages.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b313-22\">The contention on behalf of- the defendants is, that as it <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"292\">*292</page-number>appears from the findings that defendants did not take out sufficient gold to pay the <em>back expenses, </em>therefore the plaintiff was not entitled to any part thereof.</p>\n<p id=\"b314-5\">We do not so understand the contract, and to give it such a construction would defeat one of its clauses. The plaintiff was entitled to twenty per cent, of all gold taken from the mine at all events,and in case the defendants should take out during any week sufficient to more than pay for the back expenses of working the mine, the plaintiff was to have one third of the gold taken from the mine after paying such working expenses. The construction given to the contract was the correct one, and the judgment is affirmed, with ten per cent, damages.</p>\n<p id=\"b314-6\">Thornton and Sharpstein, JJ., concurred.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
