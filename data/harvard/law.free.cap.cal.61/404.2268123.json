To the offer the defendant objected generally, without stating any ground of objection; and upon the overruling of the objection, he excepted.</p>\n<p id=\"b426-17\">The fact, for the proof of which the Almanac was offered, was one of those facts of which a Court may take judicial notice; formal proof of it was therefore unnecessary. It would-have been sufficient to have called it to the knowledge of the Judge at the trial; and if his memory was at fault, or his information not sufficiently full and precise to induce him to act upon it, he had the right to resort to an almanac, or any other book of reference for the purpose of satisfying himself about it (Sub. 8, \u00a7 1875, C. C. P.); and such knowledge would have been evidence. (\u00a7 1827, id.; <em>Page </em>v. <em>Faucet, </em>Cro. Eliz. 227.)</p>\n<p id=\"b427-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"405\">*405</page-number>Besides, a general objection to the admission of evidence is insufficient. <em>(People </em>v. <em>Apple, </em>7 Cal. 289; <em>People </em>v. <em>Glenn, </em>10 id. 33.) A party objecting to evidence must specify the ground of his objection <em>(People </em>v. <em>Manning, </em>48 id. 335); if he does not, there is no error in overruling his objection; and an exception taken to the ruling is not revisable on appeal <em>(Winans </em>v. <em>Hassey, </em>48 id. 635.)</p>\n<p id=\"b427-5\">Judgment and order affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b427-6\">Morrison, O.
