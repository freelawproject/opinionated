About the year 1870 said Cadwalader moved another frame house upon the eastern side of said land, and ran a fence dividing the one house from the other. The fence was not intended as a division fence or line, nor was it intended or erected as marking off fifteen, or any number of feet, for the house as aforesaid moved on to the eastern side of said land, or twenty-five or any number of feet for the house situated on the western side of said land. The fence was erected solely for convenience sake in renting said houses, and was not designed to be, nor was it considered as a boundary or division line.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b180-5\">2. September 22,1874, said Cadwalader sold and conveyed to the defendant the east fifteen feet of said west half of said lot three, so owned by said Cadwalader.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b180-6\">8.

That since said July 25, 1876, the plaintiff has paid\u2019 all the taxes\u2014State, county and municipal\u2014which have been levied and assessed upon said twenty-five feet conveyed to him by said Cadwalader, including the real estate hereinafter described in Finding Sixth.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b180-8\">5.

That by mutual mistake defendant has been in possession, without claim or right of title thereto, of the following described portion of said twenty-five feet conveyed as aforesaid <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"159\">*159</page-number>to plaintiff, viz.: (the land in controversy, heing the land lying between the true line and the fence above referred to.)</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b181-5\">7.
