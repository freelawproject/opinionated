The action was brought to recover this balance as money expended to the use of M. It was found by the Court that the property was rebuilt without the knowledge of M. under an agreement with S. that plaintiff should pay off M.\u2019s claim, purchase the prior mortgage, and rebuild the premises; and that S. should repay him his advances with interest.</syllabus>\n<syllabus data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b357-8\"><em>Held: </em>The plaintiff had ho authority to rebuild the improvements destroyed by fire, or to make other permanent improvements, but only to make such repairs as were necessary to preserve and protect the property from ordinary wear and tear.</syllabus>\n<summary data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"history\" id=\"b357-9\">Appeal from a judgment for the defendant, and from an order denying a new trial, in the Superior Court of Sacramento County.

The power is to he construed with reference to the subject-matter, and all the words used in conferring it are to be considered in ascertaining the authority conferred. He was told, in effect, \u201c not to expend any money thereon, but apply the proceeds of the rents to the payment of her loan.\u201d It was not the <em>duty </em>of defendant Ellen, nor of plaintiff as her agent, to rebuild the improvements destroyed by fire, nor to make other permanent improvements, hut only to make such repairs as were necessary to preserve and protect the property from ordinary wear and tear. If she had <em>power </em>to expend the amount received for rents in rebuilding and making permanent improvements, or even to expend more money for su\u00f3h purposes than the amount received for rents, <em>he </em>had no authority to do so much. His agency can not he construed so as to authorize him to borrow for her, of himself or anybody else, moneys to be applied in rebuilding or making new and permanent improvements. (2 Jones on Mort., \u00a7 1126, <em>et seq.; </em>Thomas on Mort. 83, 84; Coote on Mort. 746.) He was expressly prohibited from spending any money on the property, which must he held to be a prohibition upon the expenditure of any other money than such as the law made it her duty to expend, and to that extent, at least, the language is a limitation upon the power.</p>\n<p id=\"b358-6\">Even, however, if it be admitted that he had the power, he did not exercise it. On the contrary, the finding is that he expended the money in rebuilding, and making other permanent improvements, for his own benefit and that of the mortgagor, by whom he was to be repaid the same, with interest.</p>\n<p id=\"b358-7\">Judgment and order affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
