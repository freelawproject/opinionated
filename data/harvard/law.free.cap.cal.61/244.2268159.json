When she came, I heard the defendant swearing, and breaking the doors, windows and things in his own house. * * * This was going on for some time, \u201d etc. Motion was then -made to strike out the answer on the same ground of irrelevancy, which was likewise denied. We think exceptions to these rulings were not well taken.</p>\n<p id=\"b267-8\">The conduct of defendant towards the woman with whom he had lived as his wife and for whose murder he was on trial, was not irrelevant. Resulting as it seems to have done, at times, in quarrels and alienations between them of such a character as to, drive the woman from her house, they were in themselves, circumstances, in connection with the circumstances of the homicide, for the consideration of the jury. They tended to show the state of the defendant\u2019s feelings towards the woman and his treatment of her, and, in some degree to show a motive for taking her life. <em>(Hinds </em>v. <em>The State, </em>55 Ala. 145 ; <em>Murphy </em>v. <em>The People, </em>63 N.
