That was sufficient. It does not positively appear whether or not the juror McPeak was sworn to try the cause. So long as it does not appear that he was not sworn, it is safe to presume that the Court performed its duty. Taken as a whole, we think that the instructions given to the jury fairly stated the law applicable to the case.</p>\n<p id=\"b577-7\">Judgment and order affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
