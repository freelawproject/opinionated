Neither of those points is well taken. The find<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"238\">*238</page-number>ings of the Court below show that the plaintiffs were employed by an agent of the defendant who was authorized to employ them; that services were rendered the defendant by the plaintiffs, and that the value of such services was one thousand dollars. We think that the evidence was sufficient to sustain the findings of the Court, below, and the judgment and order are affirmed with ten per cent, damages.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
