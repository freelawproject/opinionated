(Mello), a general contractor specializing in large-scale public construction projects, received annual certificates of eligibility from DCAM.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b666-6\">In October, 2004, Mello submitted its annual application for certification. See G. L. c. 149, \u00a7 44D(2), as amended by St. 2004, c. 193, \u00a7 15. On August 19, 2005, DCAM issued a preliminary determination denying the application based in part on two negative contractor evaluations. <footnotemark>3</footnotemark> See G. L. c. 149, \u00a7 44D(4). As permitted by the statute, Mello timely requested reconsideration and submitted additional information and documentation to DCAM, including lengthy rebuttals of the allegedly biased evaluations. See <em>ibid. </em>On October 27, 2005, DCAM, refusing to disregard the negative evaluations, denied Mello\u2019s application for four reasons: (1) failure to achieve a minimum <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"627\">*627</page-number>average project rating required for certification; (2) receipt of two failing scores on the Berkley and Andover projects (see note 3, <em>supra); </em>(3) failure to disclose on its application the termination from the Norwood project; and (4) failure to disclose the invoking of a performance bond. <footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b667-5\">Following a hearing in January, 2006, the Attorney General issued a decision on April 6, 2007, affirming the denial of the application.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> See <em>ibid. </em>In July, 2007, Mello commenced this Superior Court action against DCAM, seeking monetary damages.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> On December 1, 2009, DCAM filed a motion to have the case proceed pursuant to a writ of certiorari under G. L. c. 249, \u00a7 4, which was allowed. The parties then filed cross motions for judgment on the pleadings. DCAM\u2019s motion for judgment on the pleadings was allowed, Mello\u2019s motion was denied, and the complaint was dismissed. Mello filed a timely notice of appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b667-6\"><em>Statutory scheme. </em>Under the Massachusetts competitive bidding statute, every contract for the construction of public buildings estimated to cost more than $100,000 \u201cshall be awarded to the lowest responsible and eligible general bidder.\u201d G. L. c. 149, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"628\">*628</page-number>\u00a7 44A(2)(D), as amended by St. 2004, c. 193, \u00a7 11. The Legislature has charged DCAM with the duty of certifying bidder eligibility in the first instance. See <em>Barr Inc. </em>v. <em>Holliston, </em>462 Mass. 112, 115 (2012). Without a certificate of eligibility, a contractor cannot bid on any public construction contracts. See G. L. c. 149, \u00a7 44D(1)(a).</p>\n<p id=\"b668-5\">Each year, a contractor must submit an application for certification to DCAM containing certain detailed information. See G. L. c. 149, \u00a7 44D(2). DCAM is required to evaluate the applicant \u201con the basis of the application and on relevant past performance according to procedures and criteria\u201d mandated by statute and the regulations and guidelines prescribed by DCAM. G. L. c. 149, \u00a7 44D(3), as amended by St. 1993, c. 46, \u00a7 106. Written performance evaluations involving a numerical rating system of eight work categories play a central role in DCAM\u2019s assessment process.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b668-6\">The contractor has the burden of establishing to DCAM\u2019s satisfaction that it is competent and responsible.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> See 810 Code Mass. Regs. \u00a7 4.04 (2005). DCAM has wide discretion in deciding whether to issue a certificate of eligibility. See 810 Code Mass. Regs. \u00a7 4.04(1) (DCAM reserves right not to certify contractor even if contractor meets DCAM\u2019s minimum over-all numerical rating for certification).</p>\n<p id=\"b668-7\">DCAM\u2019s requirements and conditions for certification are lengthy. Some events occurring within the five-year statutory look-back period require the mandatory denial of an application for certification, while others constitute justifiable cause for denial. Discretionary grounds for denial include, as herein relevant, the following events: termination for cause from a building project, a record of two project ratings that fall below the passing score established in DCAM\u2019s contractor certification <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"629\">*629</page-number>guidelines and procedures (guidelines) on more than one building project, and a record of an invoked performance bond. See 810 Code Mass. Regs. \u00a7\u00a7 4.04(9)(b), (i), (k). DCAM may also deny an application based on the provision of either false or misleading information or the failure to provide all required information. See 810 Code Mass. Regs. \u00a7 4.04(6).</p>\n<p id=\"b669-5\"><em>Discussion. </em>This appeal turns on the meaning of \u201cremedies at law\u201d that the aggrieved party may seek following the exhaustion of its administrative appeal. Mello contends that \u201cthe remedies at law\u201d referred to in the second paragraph of G. L. c. 149, \u00a7 44D(4), is the right to bring a civil action for money damages against DCAM with a full jury trial on the merits. We disagree. First, the Commonwealth has not waived sovereign immunity with respect to any claims arising from the denial of, or refusal to issue, a license or certificate. See G. L. c. 258, \u00a7 10(e); <em>Tivnan </em>v. <em>Registrar of Motor Vehicles, </em>50 Mass. App. Ct. 96, 102 (2000); <em>Smith </em>v. <em>Registrar of Motor Vehicles, 66 </em>Mass. App. Ct. 31, 32 (2006). We do not read the general language of G. L. c. 149, \u00a7 44D(4), allowing an applicant to seek \u201cremedies at law\u201d following the exhaustion of the statutory right of appeal to waive that immunity. See <em>Boston Med. Center Corp. </em>v. <em>Secretary of the Executive Office of Health &amp; Human Servs., </em>463 Mass. 447, 454 (2012), quoting from <em>Ware </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>409 Mass. 89, 91 (1991) (\u201cThe rules of construction governing statutory waivers of sovereign immunity are stringent\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b669-6\">Even if immunity were waived, the legislative intent necessary to infer an implied right of private action from the statute is absent here. See <em>Loffredo </em>v. <em>Center for Addictive Behaviors, </em>426 Mass. 541, 543 (1998). The text of G. L. c. 149, \u00a7 44D(4), cannot be construed to envision any private right of action for contractors injured by DCAM\u2019s certification decisions. Moreover, \u00a7 44D(4) provides an applicant with the remedy of an administrative appeal to the Attorney General and expressly empowers the Attorney General to institute enforcement proceedings, if warranted, against DCAM.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> In contrast to \u00a7 44D(4), G. L. c. 149, \u00a7 44D(7), the statutory section governing contractor <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"630\">*630</page-number>evaluations, provides contractors with a private right of action against any individual who acts in a wilful, wanton, or reckless manner in the course of completing a contractor evaluation. All of these factors squarely cut against recognizing a private right of action against DCAM in \u00a7 44D(4). See <em>Salvas </em>v. <em>Wal-Mart Stores, Inc., </em>452 Mass. 337, 372-373 (2008).</p>\n<p id=\"b670-5\">We are not persuaded by Mello\u2019s argument that a cause of action for money damages against DCAM exists at common law.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> Judicial remedies in the administrative arena are normally limited to the modification or annulment of the unlawful government action, or a remand order for reconsideration and/or further proceedings. See G. L. c. 30A, \u00a7 14(7); G. L. c. 249, \u00a7 4; <em>Gifford </em>v. <em>Commissioner of Pub. Health, </em>328 Mass. 608, 619-620 (1952); <em>Turnpike Amusement Park, Inc. </em>v. <em>Licensing Commn. of Cambridge, </em>343 Mass. 435, 438 (1962); <em>Boston Edison Co. </em>v. <em>Selectmen of Concord, </em>355 Mass. 79, 87, 90-91 (1968); <em>Longo </em>v. <em>Board of Appeal on Motor Vehicle Liab. Policies &amp; Bonds, </em>356 Mass. 24, 27-28 (1969); <em>Konstantopoulos </em>v. <em>Whately, </em>384 Mass. 123, 128-138 (1981); <em>Ingalls </em>v. <em>Board of Registration in Med., </em>445 Mass. 291, 294 (2005); <em>Clark </em>v. <em>Board of Registration of Social Wkrs., </em>464 Mass. 1008, 1009 (2013). Further, the merits of discretionary licensing decisions are commonly subjected to only a limited review by courts under the arbitrary and capricious standard. See, e.g., <em>Caswell </em>v. <em>Licensing Commr. of Brockton, </em>387 Mass. 864, 878 (1983); <em>Yerardi\u2019s Moody St. Restaurant &amp; Lounge, Inc. </em>v. <em>Selectmen of Randolph, </em>19 Mass. App. Ct. 296, 300-301 (1985).</p>\n<p id=\"b670-6\">Licenses are required to engage in many occupations and businesses. The loss of a license may have devastating financial and emotional consequences. Typically, however, there is no <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"631\">*631</page-number>right to money damages flowing from an improper licensing action. During the often long period of time between the suspension or revocation of a professional license and the decision of the reviewing court, the holder of the license is generally not entitled to a temporary stay and thus may not pursue his or her livelihood. See, e.g., G. L. c. 112, \u00a7 64; <em>Gurry </em>v. <em>Board of Pub. </em>Accountancy, 394 Mass. 118, 128-130 (1985).</p>\n<p id=\"b671-5\">We disagree with Mello\u2019s contention that G. L. c. 249, \u00a7 4, is inapplicable. Following the Attorney General\u2019s decision to take no action, see G. L. c. 149, \u00a7 44H, further judicial review of DCAM\u2019s decision was unavailable by motion or statute.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> Where, as here, there was no other reasonably adequate remedy, the proper review mechanism for Mello was an action in the nature of certiorari \u201cto correct errors in [quasi judicial administrative] proceedings.\u201d <em>Hoffer </em>v. <em>Board of Registration in Med., </em>461 Mass. 451, 456 (2012), quoting from G. L. c. 249, \u00a7 4. Since Mello improperly framed this action as one for money damages unavailable as a remedy at law, the judge was entitled to amend the complaint to conform to the pleadings and to order the matter to proceed in the proper form.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> See Mass.R.Civ.P. 1, as amended, 450 Mass. 1403 (2008) (rules of civil procedure are to be interpreted \u201cto secure the just, speedy, and inexpensive determination of every action.\u201d) Nothing DCAM did or failed to do in this litigation could have conferred jurisdiction on the Superior Court to hear an action for money damages where none otherwise existed. See <em>MacDougall </em>v. <em>Acres, </em>427 Mass. 363, 371 (1998).</p>\n<p id=\"b672-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"632\">*632</page-number>On the merits, we conclude, as did the judge, that Mello failed to establish that DCAM\u2019s decision to deny Mello\u2019s application was arbitrary or capricious. A decision is arbitrary and capricious if \u201cthere is no ground which \u2018reasonable men might deem proper\u2019 to support it.\u201d <em>T.D.J. Dev. Corp. </em>v. <em>Conservation Commn. of N. Andover, </em>36 Mass. App. Ct. 124, 128-129 (1994), quoting from <em>Cotter </em>v. <em>Chelsea, </em>329 Mass. 314, 318 (1952).</p>\n<p id=\"b672-5\">In denying Mello\u2019s application, DCAM could only have considered contractor evaluations that were reliable. See 810 Code Mass. Regs. \u00a7 4.06(3). Mello argues that all contractor evaluations completed by litigation opponents are inherently unreliable and must be completely disregarded by DCAM.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> Although there is surface appeal to that argument, we think that DCAM may permissibly consider any contractor evaluations possessing sufficient indicia of reliability.</p>\n<p id=\"b672-6\">We conclude that in this case, DCAM could properly have determined that the evaluations were reliable. Not only did the public officials disclose the litigation between the parties to DCAM, they also were involved in overseeing the projects and thus had direct personal knowledge of the performance issues discussed. Each certified that the information provided in the evaluation represented \u201ca true analysis of the contractor\u2019s performance record.\u201d See <em>General Outdoor Advertising Co. </em>v. <em>Department of Pub. Works, </em>289 Mass. 149, 192 (1935) (\u201cIt is to be presumed that public officers will discharge their duties honestly and in accordance with the rules of law. Every presumption is in favor of legality and good faith until the contrary is shown\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b672-7\">As noted by DCAM, the negative evaluations provided detailed descriptions and examples of Mello\u2019s alleged performance problems and work deficiencies. Berkley and Andover expressed specific dissatisfaction with, inter alia, Mello\u2019s alleged mishandling of issues in the beginning of the contracts, the unreasonable pursuit of change orders, the poor management of subcontractors, and the substandard on-site superintendents. Authors who gave Mello passing scores and overall positive evaluations, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"633\">*633</page-number>such as the Berkley project architect, offered similar criticisms of Mello\u2019s performance.</p>\n<p id=\"b673-5\">Finally, DCAM had before it the documentation from both the towns and Mello in support of their respective positions, and notwithstanding the absence of any statutory or regulatory duty, DCAM met with Mello prior to its final determination in order to discuss the negative contractor evaluations.</p>\n<p id=\"b673-6\">To the extent that Mello challenges DCAM\u2019s decision not to include in its over-all numerical rating the perfect evaluation issued by the North Attleboro Housing Authority (NAHA), DCAM could have, consistent with its expertise, concluded that the contract work did not fall within the scope of general building construction as defined by its guidelines.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> DCAM certainly was not bound by the town\u2019s characterization of the project work in its advertising.</p>\n<p id=\"b673-7\">In addition to the evaluations and over-all score, DCAM\u2019s final decision was also based on Mello\u2019s nondisclosures of relevant information. The failure to provide complete and accurate answers to all questions, standing alone, was grounds for denying Mello\u2019s application.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> See 810 Code Mass. Regs. \u00a7 4.04(6). In sum, DCAM based its decision on appropriate and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"634\">*634</page-number>relevant factors specified in the governing statute, and its regulations and guidelines.</p>\n<p id=\"b674-4\">\n<em>Judgment affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b666-7\">DCAM is the State agency within the Executive Office of Administration and Finance established to oversee public building projects and to administer the public bidding statutes. See G. L. c. 7, \u00a7\u00a7 4A, 39B, 40A.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b666-8\">To the extent Mello alleged in its complaint that 100 percent of its work was performed in the public sector, we note that three of the four ongoing projects Mello listed in its 2004 DCAM application appeared to be private development projects.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b666-9\">The preliminary denial was based on two written evaluations and one telephone interview concerning three public building projects: the new Berkley Middle School, the Andover public safety building, and the Norwood police and fire station. Mello received eighty-five out of 100 points from the architect on the Berkley project, but only forty-four out of 100 points from the superintendent of the Berkley public schools. DCAM averaged these scores to a sixty-five. Mello received forty-one out of 100 points from the Andover town manager. During a telephone interview with the Norwood reference listed on Mello\u2019s application, DCAM learned that Norwood had terminated Mello from the building project for cause on September 13, 2003, a fact not disclosed on Mello\u2019s application for certification. No written evaluation from Norwood factored into DCAM\u2019s decision. So far as appears from the record, DCAM did not ask Norwood to complete a formal telephone inquiry contemplated by its guidelines. See Section III.A.3 of DCAM\u2019s contractor certification guidelines and procedures (guidelines). As of the date of the negative evaluations and the telephone interview, Mello was in litigation or arbitration with these three towns.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b667-7\">In May, 2005, while Mello\u2019s application was under consideration, DCAM instituted a new contractor evaluation system. On its application, Mello listed twenty-five projects that it had completed within the previous five-year period. Mello\u2019s average project rating of fifty-four fell below the minimum score required for certification under both the old and amended regulations and guidelines (seventy and eighty respectively).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b667-8\">The parties have failed to provide this court with a copy of the Attorney General\u2019s decision, which, as Mello points out, was issued well beyond the thirty-day statutory period. Section 44D(4) of c. 149 invites an aggrieved party to seek \u201cremedies at law\u201d if the Attorney General fails to render a decision within thirty days. Mello claims that it delayed seeking its remedies due to the continuing representations of the assistant attorney general involved in the case that a decision would be forthcoming.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b667-9\">Mello\u2019s three-count complaint asserted (1) a statutory claim under \u201cG. L. c. 149, \u00a7 44D,\u201d (2) a negligence claim against DCAM for \u201cthe arbitrary and capricious denial of\u201d its application, and (3) a claim for declaratory relief. Before settling into a purported claim under \u00a7 44D(4), Mello did not specify under which of the seventeen subsections of \u00a7 44D it was proceeding. The negligence claim should never have been brought for the reason, if none other, of the lack of presentment. See G. L. c. 258, \u00a7 4. That claim was dismissed without any opposition from Mello. Furthermore, because Mello failed to address the propriety of the dismissal of the declaratory judgment count in its brief, we deem the matter waived. See <em>Sullivan </em>v. <em>Liberty Mut. Ins. Co., </em>444 Mass. 34, 35 n.l (2005).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b668-8\">DCAM develops the standard contractor evaluation forms and maintains certification files for all contractors. See G. L. c. 149, \u00a7 44D(7). Every public entity undertaking a building project is required to complete an evaluation and submit it to DCAM within seventy days of the completion of the project.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b668-9\"> \u201cResponsible\u201d is defined as \u201cdemonstrably possessing the skill, ability and integrity necessary to faithfully perform the work called for by a particular contract, based upon a determination of competent workmanship and financial soundness in accordance with the provisions of [G.

As part of her enforcement duties under G. L. c. 149, \u00a7 44H, the Attorney General <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"630\">*630</page-number>also investigates and decides bid protests. See <em>Brasi Dev. Corp. </em>v. <em>Attorney Gen., </em>456 Mass. 684, 691 (2010); <em>Fordyce </em>v. <em>Hanover, </em>457 Mass. 248, 252-254 (2010).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"10\">\n<p id=\"b670-8\">The line of cases allowing disappointed low bidders deprived of specific contracts to recover bid preparation costs and lost profits are inapposite and thus do not support a cause of action against DCAM. None involved a discretionary certification decision, and all arose under different sections of G. L. c. 149 or other competitive bidding statutes. See, e.g., <em>Paul Sardella Constr. Co. </em>v. <em>Braintree Hous. Authy., </em>3 Mass. App. Ct. 326 (1975), <em>S.C., </em>371 Mass. 235 (1976); <em>Bradford &amp; Bigelow, Inc. </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>24 Mass.

L. c. 30A and judicial review of adverse decisions). It is not necessary for us to decide whether' Mello had the right to file a complaint for declaratory judgment because it has waived that issue. See note 6, <em>supra.</em></p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"12\">\n<p id=\"b671-7\">In a certiorari proceeding, judicial review is confined to the record of the administrative proceedings below. See <em>Police Commr. of Boston </em>v. <em>Robinson, </em>47 Mass. App. Ct. 767, 775 (1999). The admission of extrinsic evidence urged by Mello would be contrary to certiorari practice and precedent. See <em>Durbin </em>v. <em>Selectmen of Kingston, </em>62 Mass. App. Ct. 1, 9 (2004). There was thus no error in the denial, pursuant to G. L. c. 30A, \u00a7 14(5)-(6), and Superior Court Standing Order 1-96, of Mello\u2019s motion to supplement the administrative record.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"13\">\n<p id=\"b672-8\">Mello was no stranger to legal actions.

Section VI.A. 1 of the guidelines define general building construction to mean \u201c[t]he undertaking of general contracts for the construction of buildings .... The contract must include a variety of construction practices and supervision of a minimum of three sub-trades.\u201d The NAHA project, which was estimated to cost $100,000, required Mello to replace and upgrade locks and locksets. We fail to see how lock work, which is also not a standard category certified by DCAM, falls within that definition.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"15\">\n<p id=\"b673-9\">Mello\u2019s president signed the application under the pains and penalties of perjury, certifying that all answers and statements were true and correct. Asked whether the firm was terminated in the previous five years from any contract prior to completing its work, he answered no. Asked whether a performance bond had been invoked against the firm, he answered no. In fact, Norwood terminated Mello prior to completion. To the extent Mello argued to DCAM that disclosure was not required since its termination occurred after \u201csubstantial\u201d completion, DCAM was not persuaded by Mello\u2019s gloss on the question. Mello also does not dispute that a bond had been invoked. The duty of full disclosure required Mello\u2019s president to report the termination and the invocation of the bond and, as directed by the application and guidelines, to attach a separate sheet explaining the circumstances surrounding those events. Where DCAM based its denial on admitted nondisclosures as opposed to the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"634\">*634</page-number>underlying actions, the facts that Mello ultimately prevailed in arbitration and Mello\u2019s performance bond surety did not take over the project were irrelevant.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
