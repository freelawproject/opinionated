L. c. 90, \u00a7 24(2)(aV2)(2) (subsection 2).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> After a jury trial, the defendant <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"636\">*636</page-number>was convicted of leaving the scene of an accident causing personal injury in violation of G. L. c. 90, \u00a7 24(2)(aV2)(l) (subsection l). <footnotemark>2</footnotemark> He was given a suspended sentence of six months, with two years of probation. On appeal, the defendant claims it was error for the judge to have instructed the jury on subsection 1 because it is not a lesser included offense of subsection 2, the evidence did not justify a lesser included instruction, and the evidence was insufficient to establish the defendant left the scene of the accident to avoid prosecution or evade apprehension. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b676-5\"><em>Background. </em>The following was the evidence adduced at trial. On April 1, 2010, at approximately 6:00 a.m., the defendant drove his girlfriend to the Wonderland subway station and dropped her off so she could take the subway to work. After completing this task, the defendant drove home.</p>\n<p id=\"b676-6\">At approximately the same time that morning, Blanca Moreno\u2019s (the victim) car broke down on Route 1A in Revere. According to the State Police accident reconstructionist, at approximately 6:15 a.m., the victim was running across the northbound lane of Route 1A against a red light when the defendant\u2019s car struck her as she neared the end of the crosswalk. The victim was launched onto the hood and up the windshield, and her elbow broke the glass. After that point of impact, the victim continued in the air and over a guardrail before she landed on the southbound side of Route 1A, eighty-seven feet from the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"637\">*637</page-number>point of collision. The defendant later reported that he swerved but did not apply his brakes before impact.</p>\n<p id=\"b677-5\">Visibility was low that morning, the defendant was driving within the posted speed limit of forty-five miles per hour, and his car left no skid marks at the scene of the accident. From these facts, the police concluded that the defendant \u201cmost likely\u201d did not see the victim, and he had insufficient time to stop before hitting her.</p>\n<p id=\"b677-6\">After the collision, the defendant kept driving but telephoned his girlfriend to tell her he thought he \u201chit something, somebody, I don\u2019t know.\u201d The defendant sounded \u201cupset\u201d and \u201ctightened.\u201d When his girlfriend asked if he had stopped, he said he was going home and did not \u201cknow what to do.\u201d After the conversation with his girlfriend, the defendant telephoned Kirk Palmer, a father figure in his life. The defendant frantically told Palmer that he hit something and his windshield was damaged. When Palmer asked him why he kept driving, the defendant said, \u201cI don\u2019t know, I didn\u2019t see anything.\u201d He sounded panicked and told Palmer he was scared. Palmer told the defendant to stop, look for damage, and to contact the police. He also told the defendant he would telephone the Revere police.</p>\n<p id=\"b677-7\">When the defendant arrived at home, he immediately told his mother to contact the police because he thought he hit something. The defendant\u2019s mother telephoned the Lynn police and handed the telephone to the defendant. After providing a police officer with identifying information, the defendant told the officer that he had caused an accident on Route 1A. In this conversation, the defendant sounded neither panicked nor frantic.</p>\n<p id=\"b677-8\">After Palmer spoke to the Revere police, he telephoned the defendant and told him he should come to the Revere police station. En route to the police station, the defendant saw the victim\u2019s body covered in a white cloth on Route 1A.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> This sight made the defendant \u201cvery nervous\u201d and he began to cry. At the police station, the defendant admitted that he hit a \u201cblur\u201d but claimed he did not know what he hit. He repeatedly stated that he panicked after the collision.</p>\n<p id=\"b677-9\"><em>Discussion. </em>1. <em>Lesser included offense. </em>The defendant claims <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"638\">*638</page-number>it was error for the judge, over objection, to instruct the jury on subsection 1 because it is not a lesser included offense of subsection 2. We disagree. \u201cA \u2018lesser included offense is one which is necessarily accomplished on commission of the greater crime.\u2019 \u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Roderiques, </em>462 Mass. 415, 420 (2012), quoting from <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Porro, </em>458 Mass. 526, 531 (2010). When analyzing the two crimes, we consider only the elements of the crimes and not the facts or conduct at issue in the case. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Vick, </em>454 Mass. 418, 431 (2009); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Roderiques, supra </em>at 421. \u201cA crime is a lesser-included offense of another crime if each of its elements is also an element of the other crime.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Ogden O., </em>448 Mass. 798, 808 (2007), quoting from <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Perry, </em>391 Mass. 808, 813 (1984).</p>\n<p id=\"b678-5\">The elements of subsection 2 include (1) operating a motor vehicle; (2) upon a public way; (3) knowingly colliding with or otherwise injuring any person; (4) going away without stopping and making known one\u2019s name, residence, and motor vehicle registration number; (5) in order to avoid prosecution or evade apprehension; where (6) the death of the victim was the result of the injuries sustained in the collision. G. L. c. 90, \u00a7 24(2) (a V2) (2). Although the Commonwealth must prove that the victim\u2019s injuries resulted in death, and that the defendant knew either that he collided with a person or that he caused injury to a person, <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Daley, </em>463 Mass. 620, 623-624 (2012), the Commonwealth is not required to prove the defendant knew or expected death would result.</p>\n<p id=\"b678-6\">Similarly, the statutory language of subsection 1 punishes whoever (1) operates a motor vehicle; (2) upon a public way; (3) knowingly collides with another person or otherwise causes injury to another person; and (4) goes away without stopping and making known his name, residence, and the registration number of his motor vehicle; where (5) the collision caused injury to the person that did not result in death. G. L. c. 90, \u00a7 24(2)(aV2)(l). As we have previously held, the two subsections are \u201calmost identical,\u201d except that subsection 2 \u201capplies only if the defendant\u2019s operation causes a death rather than [merely] injury[, and] it adds the element that the defendant \u2018goes away to avoid prosecution or evade apprehension\u2019 after <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"639\">*639</page-number>the collision.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Henault, </em>54 Mass. App. Ct. 8, 11 n.5 (2002).<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b679-5\">The defendant claims that subsection 1 cannot be a lesser included offense of subsection 2 because the two crimes are mutually exclusive. In other words, even though all the elements of subsection 1 can be found in subsection 2, the defendant argues that because the victim died, he cannot be convicted of merely causing personal injury to her. This would be true if the phrase \u201cnot resulting in the death of any person,\u201d found in subsection 1, is an element of the crime. For the reasons that follow, we hold that it is not an element of subsection 1.</p>\n<p id=\"b679-6\">At trial, the defendant and the judge discussed the existential, if not esoteric, question whether death encompasses personal injury. That discussion continues on appeal. For the defendant, one either dies or she does not. On the other hand, the Commonwealth maintains that the defendant\u2019s claim is wrong as a matter of fact because death is a particular type of personal injury. The judge expressed a similar view at trial. While both views may find support, such a legislative policy choice is not a matter for judicial resolution. Rather, the real question for us to resolve is whether the Legislature intended the crimes to be mutually exclusive because it added the phrase \u201cnot resulting in . . . death\u201d to subsection 1, and the phrase \u201cif the injuries result in . . . death\u201d to subsection 2, when the crime of leaving the scene of an accident was bifurcated into a misdemeanor and a felony. See note 4, <em>supra; </em>St. 1991, c. 460, \u00a7\u00a7 1, 2.</p>\n<p id=\"b679-7\">The answer to the question lies within the canons of statutory construction. \u201cThe general and familiar rule is that a statute must be interpreted according to the intent of the Legislature ascertained from all its words construed by the ordinary and approved usage of the language, considered in connection with the cause of its enactment, the mischief or imperfection to be remedied and the main object to be accomplished, to the end that the purpose of its framers may be effectuated.\u201d <em>Hanlon </em>v. <em>Rollins, </em>286 Mass. 444, 447 (1934). Although \u201c[njone of the words of a statute is to be regarded as superfluous,\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Woods Hole, Mar</em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"640\">*640</page-number><em>tha\u2019s Vineyard &amp; Nantucket S.S. Authy., </em>352 Mass. 617, 618 (1967), \u201c[w]e will not adopt a literal construction of a statute if the consequences of such construction are absurd or unreasonable. We assume the Legislature intended to act reasonably.\u201d <em>Attorney Gen. </em>v. <em>School Comm. of Essex, </em>387 Mass. 326, 336 (1982). See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Parent, </em>465 Mass. 395, 409 (2013).</p>\n<p id=\"b680-5\">When we review the language chosen by the Legislature, it becomes apparent that the main object of the 1991 amendment was to create a felony in cases involving death where a defendant leaves the scene with the specific purpose of avoiding prosecution or evading apprehension. Indeed, prior to the 1991 amendment, the crime delineated in G. L. c. 90, \u00a7 24(2)(a), was a misdemeanor without these components. See St. 1991, c. 460, \u00a7 1. We cannot conclude that the cause of the enactment carried with it the obligation, intention, or desire to make the absence of death an element in subsection 1. Rather, the language was chosen to differentiate it from the felony in subsection 2 without making it mutually exclusive.</p>\n<p id=\"b680-6\">An example of a similar, nonelement-creating differentiation can be found in the unarmed robbery statute. Pursuant to G. L. c. 265, \u00a7 19(6), as amended by St. 1981, c. 678, \u00a7 4, \u201cWhoever, <em>not being armed </em>with a dangerous weapon, by force and violence, or by assault and putting in fear, robs, steals or takes from the person of another, or from his immediate control, money or other property which may be the subject of larceny, shall be punished ...\u201d (emphasis supplied). Despite this, the Commonwealth is not obliged to prove the defendant was unarmed as an element of the crime. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Christian, </em>430 Mass. 552, 556 (2000). The \u201cnot being armed\u201d language in the statute merely differentiates it from the enhanced crime of armed robbery, which occurs when the defendant carries out the robbery with a dangerous weapon. <em>Ibid. </em>See G. L. c. 265, \u00a7 17.</p>\n<p id=\"b680-7\">Furthermore, to conclude that the \u201cnot resulting in . . . death\u201d language in subsection 1 is an element of the crime would lead to an absurd result. To hold as such, we would have to ascribe to the Legislature the intent to criminalize leaving the scene of an accident causing injury regardless of the purpose for leaving (pursuant to subsection 1), but to make it legal for someone to leave the scene of an accident causing death, if the purpose for <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"641\">*641</page-number>leaving the scene was not to avoid apprehension or prosecution (in the case of a defendant charged under subsection 2, were no lesser included offense instruction permitted in the circumstances). Such a construction would be absurd and unreasonable. See <em>Attorney Gen. </em>v. <em>School Comm. of Essex, </em>387 Mass, at 336.</p>\n<p id=\"b681-4\">Finally, the rule of lenity does not change the equation we face. Although the rule of lenity gives defendants the benefit of a plausible ambiguity, it \u201cdoes not mean that an available and sensible interpretation is to be rejected in favor of a fanciful or perverse one.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Roucoulet, </em>413 Mass. 647, 652 (1992). We decline to apply the rule for that reason.</p>\n<p id=\"b681-7\">2. <em>Lesser included instruction. </em>The defendant also claims that even if subsection 1 is a lesser included offense of subsection 2, the evidence did not justify the judge\u2019s giving of the instruction. More specifically, the defendant argues that because the victim died \u201cinstantly or within minutes of the collision,\u201d the jury could not have found the defendant guilty of subsection 1 (causing personal injury) without also finding him guilty of subsection 2 (causing death). We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b681-9\">A lesser included jury instruction may properly be given where \u201cthe evidence provides a rational basis for acquitting the defendant of the crime charged and convicting him of the lesser included offense.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Roderiques, </em>462 Mass, at 424, quoting from <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Souza, </em>428 Mass. 478, 494 (1998). However, where there is \u201cno evidence that would permit the jury to convict the defendant of the lesser included offense rather than the greater offense,\u201d giving such an instruction is error. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Porro, </em>458 Mass, at 537. To make this determination here, we must ask whether, on \u201cany hypothesis of the evidence,\u201d the jury could have found the defendant guilty of violating subsection 1 and not guilty of violating subsection 2. See <em>ibid; Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Roderiques, supra.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b681-10\">In some measure, the defendant\u2019s jury instruction claim mirrors his first argument regarding the relationship between personal injury and death, or lack thereof. However, we need not dwell on that subject, as the defendant\u2019s claim lacks merit because it ignores the other aggravating element of subsection 2. Here, the jury could rationally find that the Commonwealth failed to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"642\">*642</page-number>prove the aggravating element of a flight with the intent \u201cto avoid prosecution or evade apprehension.\u201d G. L. c. 90, \u00a7 24(2)(ai/2)(2). Compare <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Donohue, </em>41 Mass. App. Ct. 91 (1996) (where the victim died at the scene of a car accident, but the defendant left the scene because she panicked, rather than to avoid prosecution, she was charged with and convicted of violating subsection 1). The jury were entitled to credit the evidence that the defendant immediately contacted both his girlfriend and father figure to report the accident, directed his mother to telephone the police, and told the police he was responsible for the Route 1A collision. From this evidence of self-reporting, the jury could have believed the defendant fled out of panic and not to avoid prosecution or to evade the authorities. In fact, there was considerable evidence that the defendant panicked when he fled the scene. Although there was also evidence that the defendant was not panicked, a rational jury could discredit that testimony. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Porro, </em>458 Mass, at 537; <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Roderiques, </em>462 Mass, at 424-425. Accordingly, the evidence provided a rational basis for the jury to conclude that the defendant did not intend to avoid prosecution or evade apprehension, while also justifying his conviction of the lesser included offense.</p>\n<p id=\"b682-5\">3. <em>Sufficiency of the evidence. </em>Finally, the defendant claims there was insufficient evidence that he left the scene with the intent to avoid prosecution or evade apprehension. However, because subsection 1 does not contain such an element, and the defendant was acquitted of violating subsection 2 (where the element resides), we need not address the claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b682-6\">\n<em>Judgment affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b675-14\">General Laws c. 90, \u00a7 24(2)(a1/2)(2), inserted by St. 1991, c. 460, \u00a7 2, states in pertinent part:</p>\n<p id=\"b675-15\">\u201cWhoever operates a motor vehicle upon any way or in any place to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"636\">*636</page-number>which the public has a right of access or upon any way or in any place to which members of the public shall have access as invitees or licensees and without stopping and making known his name, residence and the registration number of his motor vehicle, goes away to avoid prosecution or evade apprehension after knowingly colliding with or otherwise causing injury to any person shall, if the injuries result in the death of a person, be punished . . . .\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b676-8\">General Laws c. 90, \u00a7 24(2)(aV2)(l), inserted by St. 1991, c. 460, \u00a7 2, states in pertinent part:</p>\n<p id=\"b676-9\">\u201cWhoever operates a motor vehicle upon any way or in any place to which the public has right of access, or upon any way or in any place to which members of the public shall have access as invitees or licensees, and without stopping and making known his name, residence and the registration number of his motor vehicle, goes away after knowingly colliding with or otherwise causing injury to any person not resulting in the death of any person, shall be punished . . . .\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b677-10\">The victim died at the scene before an ambulance arrived.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b679-8\">Also, a violation of subsection 2 may be punished as a felony whereas subsection 1 is a misdemeanor, and a suspended sentence may not be imposed under subsection 2.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
