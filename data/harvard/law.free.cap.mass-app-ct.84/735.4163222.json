In 2012, the judge allowed the defendant\u2019s motion to vacate the convictions. The defendant contended that the pleas had resulted from the ineffective assistance of counsel because his attorney <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"736\">*736</page-number>had failed to advise him of the exposure to deportation created by the pleas as required by <em>Padilla </em>v. <em>Kentucky, </em>559 U.S. 356 (2010) <em>{Padilla). </em>The Commonwealth appealed upon the ground that the judge\u2019s failure to conduct an evidentiary hearing and to provide supporting findings of fact and reasoning constituted an abuse of discretion and error of law. We agree. We now vacate the order and remand the case for further action.</p>\n<p id=\"b776-5\"><em>Background. </em>1. <em>Defendant\u2019s guilty pleas. </em>The Commonwealth charged the defendant with assault and battery by means of a dangerous weapon, G. L. c. 265, \u00a7 15A(b) (count one); and assault and battery on a child causing injury, G. L. c. 265, \u00a7 13J(Z?) (count two). The charges arose from allegations that the defendant had physically abused his nine year old daughter. The parties engaged in plea discussions and made recommendations to the judge for disposition. The \u201cTender of Plea\u201d form, otherwise known as the \u201cgreen sheet,\u201d shows that the defendant accepted the following disposition: (1) on count one, a finding of guilty and a sentence of one year of confinement, suspended for two years, upon certain probationary terms; and (2) on count two, a finding of guilty and a sentence of one year of confinement concurrent with the first sentence, also suspended for two years, but with no additional probationary terms.</p>\n<p id=\"b776-6\">The green sheet includes the following information concerning the potential deportation consequences of the guilty pleas: (1) the defendant\u2019s signature underneath his acknowledgment that \u201cconviction of this offense may have the consequence of deportation . . . pursuant to the laws of the United States\u201d; (2) plea counsel\u2019s certification that he had explained to the defendant the \u201cabove-stated provisions of law ... so as to enable [him] to tender his . . . plea of guilty . . . knowingly, intelligently and voluntarily\u201d; and (3) the judge\u2019s certification that he had informed the defendant that conviction of the charges \u201cmay have the consequences of deportation, exclusion from admission to the United States, or denial of naturalization.\u201d On July 7, 2005, the defendant pleaded guilty to both counts.</p>\n<p id=\"b776-7\">2. <em>Defendant\u2019s motions to vacate his guilty pleas. </em>In September of 2011, the defendant through new counsel moved to vacate his guilty pleas. By affidavit the defendant alleged that plea counsel had \u201cnever explained to [him] the immigration con<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"737\">*737</page-number>sequences of pleading guilty.\u201d By affidavit plea counsel reported that he had no record or independent memory of the case, but that his practice had been \u201cto go over the alien warnings on the green sheet with the client\u201d but not to \u201cprovide specific advice based on the charges.\u201d Motion counsel argued that plea counsel\u2019s ineffective assistance had prevented a tender of pleas knowingly, voluntarily, and intelligently.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> On November 7, 2011, the motion judge, who had been the plea judge, endorsed the motion as \u201c[djenied.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b777-5\">On January 20, 2012, the defendant submitted to the court the same motion (with its original September 1, 2011, date); the affidavits of the defendant and plea counsel; a copy of the criminal complaint, green sheet, and police report; and a memorandum of law. These papers appear to have been identical to the original motion papers. On February 2, 2012, <em>before </em>the Commonwealth had filed a response, the same judge endorsed the motion as \u201c[ajllowed.\u201d No hearing had occurred.</p>\n<p id=\"b777-6\">On February 16, 2012, the Commonwealth filed a comprehensive motion for reconsideration. It included a copy of the green sheet and challenged the integrity of the defendant\u2019s affidavit. The Commonwealth pointed out also that it had not received a sufficient opportunity to respond to the defendant\u2019s resubmitted motion. No hearing resulted. On February 29, 2012, the judge endorsed the motion for reconsideration as \u201c[djenied.\u201d The Commonwealth has appealed.</p>\n<p id=\"b777-7\"><em>Discussion. </em>1. <em>Procedure: vacation of the guilty pleas without an evidentiary hearing and findings. </em>The vehicle for the proposed withdrawal of a guilty plea is a motion for a new trial under Mass.R.Crim.P. 30(b), as appearing in 435 Mass. 1501 (2001). <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Furr, </em>454 Mass. 101, 106 (2009). <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Diaz, </em>75 Mass. App. Ct. 347, 350 (2009). Under <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"738\">*738</page-number>rule 30(b), the judge \u201cmay grant a new trial at any time if it appears that justice may not have been done.\u201d The rule authorizes the exercise of sound discretion. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. Berrios, 447 Mass. 701, 708 (2006), cert. denied, 550 U.S. 907 (2007). <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Williams, </em>71 Mass. App. Ct. 348, 353 (2008). The policy favoring the finality of just convictions imposes a \u201crigorous standard\u201d upon the discretionary allowance of motions under rule 30(b). <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Berrios, supra. </em>See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Lopez, </em>426 Mass. 657, 661-663 (1998). Allowance must rest upon \u201csubstantial reasons.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Tucceri, </em>412 Mass. 401, 406 (1992). See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Amirault, </em>424 Mass. 618, 637 (1997). The standard of review asks whether the motion judge committed an error of law or abuse of discretion. See, e.g., <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Grace, </em>397 Mass. 303, 307 (1986); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Walker, </em>443 Mass. 213, 224-225 (2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b778-5\">The motion judge\u2019s discretion includes the decision whether to conduct an evidentiary hearing. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Shuman, </em>445 Mass. 268, 278 (2005). The guideline for its exercise is \u201cwhether a substantial issue necessitating a hearing\u201d has arisen from the submitted affidavit material. <em>Ibid, </em>(citation omitted). If so, the established \u201cbetter practice\u201d has been to conduct an <em>evidentiary </em>hearing. Reporters\u2019 Notes to Rule 30(c)(3), Mass. Ann. Laws Court Rules, Rules of Criminal Procedure, at 1662 (LexisNexis 2013-2014). See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Stewart, </em>383 Mass. 253, 260 (1981); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Companonio, </em>420 Mass. 1003, 1003 (1995), <em>S.C. </em>445 Mass. 39 (2005); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Saarela, </em>15 Mass. App. Ct. 403, 406-407 (1983). These authorities were available to the judge at the time of both his rulings in February of 2012.</p>\n<p id=\"b778-6\">The judge should have held an evidentiary hearing before he ruled on the defendant\u2019s motion because evidence clearly conflicted with the defendant\u2019s claim of ineffective assistance of counsel. The defendant\u2019s affidavit contradicted (1) the green sheet certifications signed by the judge and the defendant\u2019s plea counsel; (2) the defendant\u2019s own green sheet acknowledgment; and (3) the plea counsel\u2019s affidavit. The contents of the resubmitted motion, indicated by the cover sheet, also show that the judge received those materials. Despite the conflicting evidence, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"739\">*739</page-number>the judge allowed the defendant\u2019s motion to vacate his pleas without the benefit of an evidentiary hearing and without the opportunity for opposition by the Commonwealth. The omission was an abuse of discretion depriving the Commonwealth of a fair opportunity to contest the motion and preventing the determination of material facts.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b779-5\">Further, as a matter of law, the omission of an evidentiary hearing inevitably caused a violation of rule 30(b)\u2019s requirement that the judge <em>\u201cshall </em>make such findings of fact as are necessary to resolve the defendant\u2019s allegations of error of law\u201d (emphasis supplied). It similarly precluded any written explanation in support of the final two rulings. Recorded reasoning serves multiple valuable purposes. It guides the decision maker to the merits, assures the parties of a deliberative result, enables informed appellate review, and promotes public knowledge of, and confidence in, the rationality of judicial work. See <em>In the Matter of the Enforcement of a Subpoena, </em>463 Mass. 162, 174 n.6 (2012), quoting from S.J.C. Rule 3:09, Commentary to Canon 3(B)(9), as appearing in 455 Mass. 1301 (2009) (court, in discussion of the judicial deliberative privilege, \u201cencourage[d] judges \u2018to explain the basis for their decisions on the record. ... By helping litigants to understand the basis for decisions in cases, the judge also promotes public understanding of judicial proceedings\u2019 \u201d).<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> The ultimate source of respect for a judicial order is the quality of its reasoning. An unreasoned <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"740\">*740</page-number>order forfeits that resource. Here the omission of findings and reasoning violates the standards of rule 30(b) and (c)(3), and places the one-word ruling under suspicion of arbitrariness.</p>\n<p id=\"b780-5\">2. <em>Merits: applicability of </em>Padilla <em>to defendant\u2019s claim. </em>By briefing and oral argument in this court, the defendant has contended that the District Court judge has implicitly applied the rule of <em>Padilla, </em>559 U.S. at 374-375, to his motion: that the failure of his counsel in 2005 to advise him of the risk of deportation resulting from a guilty plea denied him the effective assistance of counsel guaranteed by the Sixth Amendment to the United States Constitution. As recounted, a one-word ruling deprives us of the findings and reasoning necessary for any intelligent review of the merits of the claim and of the decision. Since the briefing and the oral argument of this case on February 11, 2013, two substantial decisions have shifted the doctrinal ground beneath a <em>Padilla </em>claim in Massachusetts. The Commonwealth has commendably acknowledged them by subsequent letters in accordance with Mass.R.A.P. 16(1), as amended, 386 Mass. 1247 (1982). Because today\u2019s order of remand may lead to a decision of the <em>Padilla </em>merits by the judge, or an alternate judge, we summarize the general effect of these intervening precedents: <em>Chaidez </em>v. <em>United States, </em>133 S. Ct. 1103 (2013), and <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Sylvain, </em>466 Mass. 422 (2013).</p>\n<p id=\"b780-6\">In <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Clarke, </em>460 Mass. 30, 44-45 (2011), approximately seven months before the contested rulings here, the Supreme Judicial Court concluded that the 2010 <em>Padilla </em>decision would apply retroactively to collateral attacks upon criminal pleas submitted from April 1, 1997 (the effective date of Federal legislation exposing such plea bargainers to immigration sanctions), onward.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b781-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"741\">*741</page-number>Soon after argument and submission of this appeal in February of 2013, the United States Supreme Court in <em>Chaidez </em>v. <em>United States, supra </em>at 1105, 1111, characterized the <em>Padilla </em>holding of 2010 as a \u201cnew rule\u201d available only prospectively for collateral attack upon pleas of guilt submitted in Federal District Court.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"AEe\">Seven months later, in <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Sylvain, supra </em>at the Supreme Judicial Court concluded that a noncitizen defendant pleading guilty to a sanctionable aggravated felony in a Massachusetts trial court could challenge a final <em>prz-Padilla </em>conviction by a motion to withdraw the plea.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> The holding rests upon two independent grounds. The first is that the State, as a separate sovereign, has the option to extend the remedial benefit of a newly announced Federal constitutional right retroactively within <em>its </em>own courts even though the Supreme Court has declined to extend the right retroactively to convictions final in <em>its </em>District Courts. <em>Id. </em>at 434-435. See <em>Danforth </em>v. <em>Minnesota, </em>552 U.S. 264, 266, 275, 280, 282, 289 (2008) (seven-justice majority).<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> As a second ground, the Supreme Judicial Court stated that art. 12 of the Massachusetts Declaration of Rights implicitly demands \u201cthat defense counsel provide defendants with accurate advice concerning the deportation consequences <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"742\">*742</page-number>of a guilty plea or conviction at trial.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Sylvain, supra </em>at 436. It regarded that State constitutional right as implicit and existent as of the time of Sylvain\u2019s challenged plea in 2007. <em>Id. </em>at 436-437.</p>\n<p id=\"b782-4\"><em>Conclusion. </em>For these reasons, we vacate the order allowing the defendant\u2019s motion pursuant to rule 30(b) to withdraw his guilty pleas. We remand the case to the District Court for an evidentiary hearing. The judge hearing the motion shall make specific subsidiary and ultimate findings of fact and provide separate reasoning and conclusions of law.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b782-5\">\n<em>So ordered.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b777-8\">We assume without deciding that the defendant can show \u201cmore than a hypothetical risk\u201d of deportation. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Barreiro, </em>67 Mass. App. Ct. 25, 26 (2006), quoting from <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Berthold, </em>441 Mass. 183, 185 (2004) (\u201cThe remedy clause of G. L. c. 278, \u00a7 29D, is triggered only when a defendant can . . . demonstrate that he \u2018may\u2019 become subject to one of the immigration consequences enumerated in the statute. We construe this requirement to mean that a defendant must demonstrate more than a hypothetical risk of such a consequence, but that he actually faces the prospect of its occurring\u201d).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b779-6\">In February of 2012, the judge did not have the benefit of the thorough analysis of the importance of an evidentiary hearing in the present circumstances (i.e., a motion to withdraw guilty plea by a noncitizen contradicting the plea tender paper certifications) appearing in <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Gordon, </em>82 Mass. App. Ct. 389, 393-396 (2012), in September of 2012. That analysis emphasized that the standard of rule 30(b) and (c)(3) \u201ccircumscribe[s]\" the motion judge\u2019s discretion to allow plea withdrawal in the presence of factual issues without an evidentiary hearing. <em>Id. </em>at 394-395. It reinforced the cited authorities available to the judge for the self-evident point that a substantial factual dispute in the motion documents demands an evidentiary hearing and findings as a prerequisite for vacation of a final conviction. <em>Id. </em>at 395.
