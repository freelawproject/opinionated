G. L. c. 266, \u00a7 30. At a bench trial, the defendant claimed as an affirmative defense that he lacked the requisite specific intent to steal because he honestly believed that the metal property was abandoned. This defense was unsuccessful. The trial judge determined that the defendant\u2019s stated belief that the pieces of metal were abandoned property \u2014 notwithstanding that these metal construction materials were being stored on private property posted with no trespassing signs \u2014 even if considered as honest in the defendant\u2019s subjective mind, was not objectively reasonable based on the case evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b428-8\">A majority of this court, as reflected by the expanded panel, affirms the conviction. We discern no error in the trial judge\u2019s determination of guilt. The record reflects that the judge understood the law of the affirmative defense of mistake of fact and abandonment in the context of a larceny charge, and correctly applied that law in finding the defendant guilty on the evidence presented.</p>\n<p id=\"b428-9\">The dissent discerns error in the judge\u2019s guilty finding only by postulating a new formulation of the affirmative defense of mistake and abandonment. That new formulation is that a defendant\u2019s subjectively held honest belief that property is abandoned need not be reasonable and may, indeed, be totally unreasonable. Neither that formulation, nor the dissent\u2019s criticism that the judge incorrectly rejected the abandonment defense in making his finding, supports a reversal of the larceny conviction in this case.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b428-10\">1. <em>Background of the trial and guilty finding. </em>The following is a brief summary of the trial evidence and entry of the guilty finding.</p>\n<p id=\"b429-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"389\">*389</page-number>The construction site from which the defendant took the pieces of metal was private property located in Pittsfield. The property was known as Amy Court. There was active, ongoing construction on a townhouse development, with large construction machines, a work trailer, the raising of a building, and the clearing of land. There were several \u201cno trespassing . . . private property\u201d signs posted throughout the site. The defendant drove his pickup truck onto Amy Court during midmoming. The defendant then took several lengths of steel pipe and metal plates and loaded them into the back of his pickup truck. An employee at the site inquired what the defendant was doing. The defendant replied that he was just picking up some junk steel. The defendant drove away from the Amy Court construction site. The police were notified. Shortly thereafter, a police officer stopped the defendant. The bed of the defendant\u2019s pickup truck still contained numerous pieces of pipe, plates, and other metal. When inquired of by the police officer where he had gotten the metal, the defendant first denied that any of the metal came from the Amy Court construction site.</p>\n<p id=\"b429-5\">The defendant later changed this story and admitted that the metal property was taken from the construction site. However, the defendant testified that he honestly believed the metal was abandoned. In finding the defendant guilty, the trial judge stated, \u201cAs far as I\u2019m concerned, the presence of the no trespassing sign puts you on notice that the property was not for you to take. Your honest belief at that point would not be relevant. So I find you guilty, sir.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b429-6\">The dissent sees this statement as error of law. We think not. \u201cWhen a case is tried without a jury, the legal framework in which facts are to be found is not generally stated with the precision and amplitude of instructions to a jury [and] it is presumed that the judge as trier of fact applies correct legal principles.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Kerns, </em>449 Mass. 641, 655 (2007), quoting from <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Milo M., </em>433 Mass. 149, 152 (2001). The dissent far too finely parses and interprets the judge\u2019s remark in such a way that would compel a reversal that is entirely unwarranted by the trial evidence. As the trial transcript reveals, the judge referenced the no trespassing signs as \u201cputting] [the defendant] on notice\u201d that the scrap metal was not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"390\">*390</page-number>abandoned. Add to this that the defendant lied when first confronted by the police, denying that he had taken the metal pieces from within the Amy Court construction site. These two incriminating pieces of evidence, when added to the totality of the other evidence at trial, support the judge\u2019s rejection of the affirmative defense of mistake of fact with regard to property abandonment.</p>\n<p id=\"b430-5\">Contrary to what the dissent writes, the judge\u2019s few words in brief comment concerning the posted no trespassing signs \u2014 which comment was tied to evidence that logically tended to demonstrate that the metal property behind the posted no trespassing signs was not abandoned and could not objectively be believed to be so \u2014 does not give rise to reversible error. Indeed, because the evidence in the light most favorable to the Commonwealth supported the guilty finding on the existing law of larceny and the affirmative defense of mistake on property ownership or property abandonment, this case could be affirmed without further address.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> However, the dissent would go much further in address and seeks to revamp the existing black-letter law governing this affirmative defense.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> We turn now to this issue concerning the state of the existing law.</p>\n<p id=\"b430-6\">2. <em>Mistake of fact with regard to abandonment. </em>As recast under the dissent\u2019s construction, a defendant\u2019s mistaken belief regarding property ownership or abandonment would compel a trial judge to instruct that the jury must acquit (or a judge sitting as fact finder must acquit), even if a defendant\u2019s subjectively expressed honest belief that property is abandoned is, objectively, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"391\">*391</page-number>totally unreasonable. Such acquittals under the dissent\u2019s theory would be compelled so long as a defendant claims \u2014 even without any reasonable basis to so believe \u2014 that the property had no owner or was abandoned. No Massachusetts case supports this newly defined affirmative defense wrought by the dissent. Indeed, the dissent\u2019s recast is not only out of sync with existing case law but also contrary to the model jury instructions, discussed <em>infra, </em>which define the elements of, and affirmative defenses to, the crime of larceny.</p>\n<p id=\"b431-4\">Finally, and of import, the dissent\u2019s recast of the affirmative defense of mistake concerning abandonment of property will lead to instructing a jury (and defining the law to be applied by a judge as fact finder) that the jury (or judge) <em>must </em>enter a not guilty verdict (or finding) \u2014 even if such an acquittal is contrary to the trial evidence, and even if the acquittal is virtually nonsensical because the defendant\u2019s belief that the subject property was abandoned is entirely irrational and unreasonable, if viewed objectively. We address each of the above-mentioned concerns in turn.</p>\n<p id=\"b431-5\">a. <em>The case law on this affirmative defense to larceny. </em>As previously observed, the dissent overlooks extant, well-established Massachusetts case law. Hence, we now turn to a number of Massachusetts cases stating that, where a defendant claims as an affirmative defense a mistake of fact concerning the ownership of property or abandonment, such mistaken belief must be both honestly held and reasonable under the circumstances.</p>\n<p id=\"b431-6\">In <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Anslono, 9 </em>Mass. App. Ct. 867 (1980), the court made clear that, if an affirmative defense is raised premised on a defendant\u2019s mistaken belief concerning ownership interest in property subject to a motor vehicle larceny prosecution (which, of course, encompasses an affirmative defense structured on a lack of any ownership by abandonment), <em>the defendant is entitled to an instruction directed to whether the defendant had both an honest and reasonable belief </em>concerning the property ownership issue. In <em>Anslono, </em>we wrote as follows on the issue:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b431-7\">\u201cOn the evidence, the judge was required to instruct the jury clearly and correctly, in a fair and impartial manner, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"392\">*392</page-number>on the substantive elements of the crime charged, with particular attention to the crucial question of the existence of a larcenous intent. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Porter, </em>10 Met. 263, 283 (1846). <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Carson, </em>349 Mass. 430, 435 (1965). <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Kelley, </em>359 Mass. 77, 92 (1971). <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Corcione, </em>364 Mass. 611, 618 (1974). . . .</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b432-5\">\u201cHis instructions on the question of larcenous intent . . . omitted entirely an instruction that the defendant was entitled to an acquittal <em>if he honestly and reasonably believed </em>that he had title to, and the right to sell, the motor vehicle. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Stebbins, </em>8 Gray 492,495 (1857). <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>White, </em>5 Mass. App. Ct. 483, 485-488 (1977).\u201d (Emphasis added.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b432-6\"><em>Anslono, 9 </em>Mass. App. Ct. at 867-868. Thus, the dual requirement of an honest <em>and </em>reasonable predicate for the affirmative defense of mistaken ownership or abandonment in a larceny prosecution is patent in <em>Anslono,</em><footnotemark><em>5</em></footnotemark><em> </em>Cf. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Titus, </em>116 Mass. 42, 44-45 (1874) (\u201c[I]f, at the time of first taking [lost goods] into his possession, [the defendant] has a felonious intent to appropriate them to his own use and to deprive the owner of them, and then knows or has the reasonable means of knowing or ascertaining . . . who the owner is, he may be found guilty of larceny\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b432-7\">Also imposing this dual requirement of subjective honesty and objective reasonableness is <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Vives, </em>447 Mass. 537 (2006). In a section entitled <em>\u201cHonest and reasonable claim </em>instruction,\u201d which concerns this affirmative defense, the Supreme Judicial Court repeatedly echoes the dual requirements:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b432-8\">\u201cWe recently had the opportunity to outline the definition of an affirmative defense in a criminal case and, more <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"393\">*393</page-number>importantly, the effects of such a label on the parties\u2019 respective burdens. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. Cabral, 443 Mass. 171, 178-182 (2005). ... See Model Penal Code and Commentaries \u00a7 223.1(3)(b) (1980) (\u2018It is an affirmative defense to prosecution for theft that the actor . . . acted under an honest claim of right to the property or service involved . . .\u2019). . . . [Here], the defendant\u2019s argument that <em>he honestly and reasonably believed </em>that he was collecting a debt was an affirmative defense.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b433-5\">\u201cThe label of affirmative defense does not relieve the Commonwealth of its burden of proof, however. Because <em>the honest and reasonable claim defense addresses an element of the crime charged, that of the defendant\u2019s intent to steal, </em>. . . the burden of proof cannot be shifted to the defendant.... The Commonwealth\u2019s burden to disprove <em>the affirmative defense of honest and reasonable claim </em>arises once the defendant has met his own \u2018burden of production.\u2019 . . . Thus, if any view of the evidence would support a factual finding that the defendant was acting as creditor to the victim\u2019s debtor, the defendant has met his burden of production and it is incumbent on the Commonwealth to disprove the defense.\u201d (Emphases added.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b433-6\"><em>Vives, </em>447 Mass, at 540-541.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> So it is, as <em>Vives </em>pinpoints, that this affirmative defense requires a duality of (subjective) honest belief and (objective) reasonableness concerning the ownership or abandonment of property \u2014 all as tied to specific intent and to proof of the crime of larceny.</p>\n<p id=\"b433-7\"><em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Larmey, </em>14 Mass. App. Ct. 281, 283-285 (1982), follows the same black-letter law pattern of requiring this legal duality for the larceny affirmative defense. In that case, the court held that the evidence supported a defense jury instruction <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"394\">*394</page-number>concerning both an \u201chonest <em>and </em>reasonable belief\u201d (emphasis added). <em>Id. </em>at 283, 285. Indeed, in <em>Larmey, </em>Justice Smith noted that on the trial record in that case, the larceny instruction requested by the defense was not \u201cdirectly on point\u201d in that it failed to include both the honest and reasonable belief requirements.</p>\n<p id=\"b434-5\">\u201cAs <em>framed by the defendant, the requested instruction was not directly on point as it did not assume an honest and reasonable belief on behalf of the defendant}[</em><footnotemark><em>7</em></footnotemark><em>] </em>but it was \u2018close enough\u2019 (see <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>White, </em>5 Mass. App. Ct. [483,] 488 [(1977)]) to require the judge to give the substance of an instruction that the defendant should be acquitted on so much of the indictments as charged him with robbery and stealing (larceny) <em>if the jury should find that the defendant honestly and reasonably believed that the money he took </em>from the victims had been stolen by them from the two women and that he intended to return it to them. There was sufficient evidence to warrant the submission of the defendant\u2019s theory to the jury, especially in view of the testimony of one of the victims in regard to the remarks of the defendant at the time of the incident.\u201d (Footnotes omitted.)</p>\n<p id=\"b434-6\"><em>Larmey, </em>14 Mass. App. Ct. at 285.</p>\n<p id=\"b434-7\">The case of <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>White, </em>5 Mass. App. Ct. at 486-488, is in accord with <em>Anslono, Vives, </em>and <em>Larmey. </em>So, it is noted in <em>Larmey </em>that \u201c[t]he requested instruction in <em>[White] </em>suffered from the same defect\u201d as was present in <em>Larmey, </em>in that the instructions did not explicitly state the requirement of an honest <em>and </em>reasonable belief on the part of the defendant. <em>Larmey, </em>14 Mass. App. Ct. at 285 n.6. Consistent with what the <em>Larmey </em>case states, in <em>White </em>the court held that \u201cthe defendant was entitled to an instruction to the effect that he should be acquitted on so much of the present indictment as charges him with robbery and stealing (larceny) if the jury should find that the defendant honestly and reasonably believed that the money he <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"395\">*395</page-number>took from [the victim] represented a debt actually due from [the victim] to the defendant.\u201d <em>White, </em>5 Mass. App. Ct. at 488.</p>\n<p id=\"b435-5\">b. <em>The existing larceny model jury instructions. </em>Contrary to the dissent\u2019s recast, Instruction 8.520 of the Criminal Model Jury Instructions for Use in the District Court (2009) (Model Jury Instruction 8.520) correctly indicates that a defendant\u2019s mistaken belief that property is abandoned is a valid affirmative defense to a charge of larceny, <em>only if the defendant\u2019s mistaken belief was both honestly held, from a subjective view, and objectively reasonable. </em>Model Jury Instruction 8.520 tracks the above-discussed, long-standing case law in this State, which requires both an honest belief <em>and </em>a reasonable basis for that belief as predicates for this affirmative defense to larceny.</p>\n<p id=\"b435-6\">Model Jury Instruction 8.520, which defines the elements of \u201cLarceny by Stealing\u201d and which, as material to this case, defines in Supplemental Instruction 7 the affirmative defense of mistake concerning property ownership (see note 8, <em>infra), </em>follows the precedential path of <em>Anslono, Vives, Larmey, </em>and <em>White </em>to the end of requiring not only an honestly held, but also a reasonable, mistaken belief involving ownership (or abandonment) of the subject property. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Gelpi, </em>416 Mass. 729, 731 (1994) (\u201cThe defendant argues that, based on the evidence tending to prove that he had no intent to steal because he had an honest and reasonable belief that the property was his, the jury should have been so instructed. . . . The defendant was entitled to have the jury consider this evidence\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b435-7\">What the dissent would do is split asunder the honestly held and reasonable belief elements in the case law and in the larceny model jury instruction. To do so would mean that a defendant\u2019s honest subjective belief no longer has any mooring to objective reasonableness. To measure how untenable the dissent\u2019s construction actually is, one might consider how a jury instruction would read in light of the new defense crafted by the dissent, as opposed to the present, and correct, instruction contained in Model Jury Instruction 8.520.</p>\n<p id=\"b435-8\">Under the current Model Jury Instruction 8.520, a proper instruction on mistake of fact regarding ownership and abandonment of property would read as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b435-9\">\u201cIf the defendant took another person\u2019s property <em>in an </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"396\">*396</page-number><em>honest and reasonable </em>belief that [the defendant] had a legal right to it [including by abandonment] then you must find the defendant not guilty, even if that belief was in fact mistaken, because [the defendant] lacked the intent to steal.\u201d<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b436-5\">In contrast to this established approach, the dissent\u2019s recast would, in effect, yield an instruction (and require a judge to apply the law) in something like the following mode:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b436-6\">\u201cIf the defendant took another person\u2019s property in an honest but mistaken belief that the property was abandoned \u2014 even if that belief <em>was objectively unreasonable </em>\u2014 then you the jury (or, you the fact-finding judge) must find the defendant not guilty, because the defendant lacked the intent to steal.\u201d<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b437-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"397\">*397</page-number>As is clear from the plain text of the latter theoretical jury instruction, the construction urged by the dissent has the prospect of yielding absurd verdicts of acquittal.</p>\n<p id=\"b437-4\">3. <em>Jury trial waiver. </em>The defendant elected a jury-waived trial, prior to which the trial judge conducted an oral colloquy in open court. The defendant now claims, for the first time on appeal, that this colloquy was inadequate to assess whether his jury waiver was knowing and voluntary. \u201cBecause he failed to make a timely objection, we review for a substantial risk of a miscarriage of justice.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Pimentel, </em>73 Mass. App. Ct. <em>777, </em>787 (2009). We see no such risk.</p>\n<p id=\"b437-5\">It has long been held that there is no \u201c \u2018rigid pattern\u2019 of factual determinations which a judge must make before concluding a defendant\u2019s waiver of the right to trial by jury was voluntary and intelligent.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Schofield, </em>391 Mass. 772, 775 (1984), quoting from <em>Ciummei </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>378 Mass. 504, 509-510 (1979). Although this court does not have before it a transcript of the contested colloquy, the defendant concedes in his brief that the judge explained the defendant\u2019s right to a jury trial; thoroughly addressed the difference between a jury trial and bench trial; acknowledged the defendant\u2019s signed jury waiver form; and confirmed that defense counsel discussed the significance of the jury waiver with the defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b437-6\">We further note that the printed jury waiver form, which is present in the record appendix, clearly states that the defendant had been informed of the following: (1) a jury consists of members of the community; (2) the defendant may participate in the jury\u2019s selection; (3) the jury\u2019s verdict must be unanimous; <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"398\">*398</page-number>(4) the respective roles of the judge and jury in a jury trial; and (5) how the role of the judge changes in a jury-waived trial. Again, this jury waiver form was signed by the defendant. It was likewise signed by the trial judge and defense counsel. Given all of the foregoing indications, we are satisfied that the defendant was adequately apprised of the significance of his jury waiver.</p>\n<p id=\"b438-5\">In any event, \u201c \u2018[t]he defendant, being competent, must simply have indicated a comprehension of the nature of the choice\u2019 between a bench and jury trial. <em>[Ciummei, supra </em>at 510.] Such comprehension of the choice may be based on information provided to the defendant by the judge, the defendant\u2019s counsel, the defendant\u2019s personal knowledge, or some other source.\u201d <em>Schofield, </em>391 Mass, at 776. Here, the judge\u2019s colloquy, combined with the signed waiver form, provides ample assurance that the defendant\u2019s waiver was voluntary and intelligent.</p>\n<p id=\"b438-6\">\n<em>Judgment affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b428-11\">We also address the defendant\u2019s ancillary claim that his jury trial waiver was not knowing and voluntary. As discussed in part 3, <em>infra, </em>this claim is not availing.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b430-7\">The question of property ownership and claim of right to property encompasses both straight legal ownership questions and abandonment. However, because this is an abandonment case, to shorten phrases, the single term \u201cabandonment\u201d will be predominantly used herein. However, the issue presented in the majority and dissent in this case encompasses claims of both right to property and abandonment; so, from time to time, the longer double terms will also be used herein.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b430-8\">Statements in the dissent suggesting that Massachusetts case law is not clear are without foundation. See, in particular, <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Anslono, 9 </em>Mass. App. Ct. 867, 867-868 (1980). See also <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Vives, </em>447 Mass. 537, 540-541 (2006); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Larmey, </em>14 Mass. App. Ct. 281, 283-285 (1982); and <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>White, </em>5 Mass. App. Ct. 483, 486-488 (1977). All of these cases address this affirmative defense of mistake of ownership and claim of right to property and the element of specific intent. The cases are further described in more detail in part 2 of this opinion, <em>infra.</em></p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b432-9\">Cf. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Sherry, </em>386 Mass. 682, 697 (1992), which states as follows: \u201cThe defense of mistake of fact, however, requires that the accused act in good faith and with reasonableness. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Presby, </em>14 Gray 65, 69 (1860); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Power, </em>7 Met. 596, 602 (1844); R. Perkins, Criminal Law 939-940 (2d ed. 1969).\u201d While the <em>Sherry </em>case is discussing mistake of fact in a rape prosecution, not a larceny prosecution, the direct dual requirements of mistake of fact have equal application in both offense proof questions.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b433-8\">The dissent discusses that larceny is a specific intent crime. Of course, specific intent is required to prove larceny. \u201cTo support a conviction of larceny under G.

See <em>post </em>at 406-409 &amp; nn.14-16. There are other inherent problems with this out-of-Massachusetts law survey in the dissent, in that certain States, with cases relied upon by the dissent, have quite different mistake-of-fact statutes. For example, <em>State </em>v. <em>Sexton, </em>160 NJ. 93 (1999), does not stand for the proposition that an unreasonable mistake of fact is exculpatory. Indeed, New Jersey\u2019s \u201cdefense of mistake\u201d statute requires that the defendant \u201creasonably arrived at the conclusion underlying the mistake.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 103. The court concluded that an alleged mistake of fact as to whether a gun was loaded could be a defense to reckless manslaughter, and that the jury should be instructed to determine whether the defendant\u2019s mistaken belief was recklessly formed. <em>Id. </em>at 106. See <em>State </em>v. <em>Abbey, </em>13 Ariz. App. 55, 57 (1970) (concluding that the State did not disprove the defendant\u2019s contractual claim-of-right defense, with no discussion of reasonableness).</p>\n<p id=\"b436-11\">Further complicating the dissent\u2019s reliance on out-of-Massachusetts law is that the text of other State larceny statutes differ markedly from our larceny statute, G. L. c. 266, \u00a7 30. For example, in <em>State </em>v. <em>Cavness, </em>80 Haw. 460, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"397\">*397</page-number>463 (Ct. App. 1996), the court analyzed Hawaii\u2019s trespass statute in light of another Hawaii statute, which mandates that the State must prove a minimum of recklessness when no mental state is specified in a statute (such as in the trespass statute). Accordingly, the court remanded for a new trial that would include the determination whether the defendant\u2019s belief in his right to be on the premises was reckless, stating that \u201can unreasonable belief may or may not be a reckless belief.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 466. Under the pertinent State statutes, reasonableness was not the relevant inquiry, and an unreasonable belief, if arrived at recklessly, would not excuse the defendant\u2019s conduct. See <em>People </em>v. <em>Zona, </em>14 N.Y.3d 488, 492-493 (2010) (citing New York\u2019s statute on larceny defenses, Penal Law \u00a7 155.15[1], which states that \u201cit is an affirmative defense that the property was appropriated under a claim of right made in good faith,\u201d and reasoning that the statute does not require reasonableness).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-3\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b438-7\">Milkey, J.</author>\n<p id=\"AC3\">(dissenting in part, with whom Sikora, J., joins). The defendant testified that he honestly believed that the items of scrap metal he took had been abandoned. On the law, he maintained that such a belief was sufficient to negate the specific intent necessary to prove larceny, regardless of whether his belief was objectively reasonable. The Commonwealth countered that even if the defendant honestly believed the property had been abandoned, that belief also had to be reasonable. The principal question raised by this appeal is which view of the law is correct. I agree with the defendant that an honestly held belief that property had been abandoned would be sufficient to negate the specific intent that is an essential element of the crime of larceny. Because the explanation that the judge offered for his guilty finding appears to rest on a contrary view of the law, the conviction should be vacated. I therefore respectfully dissent.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b439-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"399\">*399</page-number><em>Background. </em>Although this appeal ultimately turns on a pure question of law, the trial evidence lends useful context to the parties\u2019 respective legal positions. I therefore begin by briefly recounting the evidence.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b439-5\">The defendant makes his living by collecting and selling scrap metal. Thus, he regularly looks for abandoned metal items, e.g., by combing through what people leave by the curb on trash day. The defendant acknowledged that when he searches for \u201cstuff being dumped\u201d \u2014 which he claimed is \u201cso common in Pittsfield\u201d \u2014 he does not look for signs indicating private property.</p>\n<p id=\"b439-6\">The property at issue in this appeal consists of various metal items that the defendant took from land off of Amy Court in Pittsfield. Amy Court is a cul-de-sac that recently had been built to provide access to a thirteen-building, twenty-six-unit townhouse development. At the time of the incident, only one of the buildings had been constructed. The evidence at trial paints a picture of a typical residential construction site: a mixture of cleared land and woods, a \u201cjob trailer,\u201d dirt piles, heavy equipment, and the like. Amy Court had not yet been accepted by the city, and therefore was a private way. Several no trespassing signs had been placed on trees at the site, including one near the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"400\">*400</page-number>specific area in question. At the same time, the developer had also placed a sign at the site that advertised the development, and \u201cthe public was allowed to come in and see these sites and make a bid on them or check them out or anything else like that.\u201d It is uncontested that the developer had \u201chad a lot of trouble with people dumping garbage and so forth\u201d at the site.</p>\n<p id=\"b440-4\">As the defendant admits, on the morning of July 27, 2010, he drove his truck down Amy Court seeking scrap metal. He does not contest that there were no trespassing signs posted in the area, but he testified that he did not see them. Using a path off of Amy Court, the defendant accessed an area lying between the woods and one of the dirt piles at the site. According to his testimony, he thought that this area was owned by the city. There he found various metal items, including what the developer\u2019s employee described as \u201cmiscellaneous leftover pipes from doing the sewer lines and water lines.\u201d The defendant testified that he was aware that others had been using the site as a dumping ground and that he believed that the items he took had been abandoned. He placed the items into his truck so that he could sell them as scrap metal.</p>\n<p id=\"b440-5\">Kevin Lufkin, an employee of the developer, spotted the defendant\u2019s truck when it entered the site. His initial concern was that the defendant might have come to dump refuse there. Lufkin confronted the defendant as he was leaving. According to Lufkin, the defendant told him that he was \u201cjust picking up some junk steel\u201d and drove away. The defendant testified to a somewhat more extended version of the conversation. According to him, after he informed Lufkin what he was doing there, Lufkin told him, \u201cOkay, I don\u2019t have no problem with that. Just don\u2019t dump . . . .\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b440-6\">After Lufkin checked with his boss to make sure she had not given the defendant permission, he reported the incident (along with the defendant\u2019s license plate number) to police. The police located the defendant as he was in the process of selling a truckload of scrap metal. The testifying officer described the load as \u201call kinds of junk.\u201d The defendant denied that any of the material was stolen, admitted to taking some of the material from the development site,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> and stated his belief that that material had <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"401\">*401</page-number>been abandoned. The defendant then drove the truck back to the site with the police, and had further discussions with Lufkin there. Although the defendant continued to protest that he had not done anything wrong, he returned the material. The developer nevertheless pressed charges and a criminal complaint issued. Sitting jury-waived, the trial judge found the defendant guilty, and, as discussed <em>infra, </em>he explained his reasoning in brief detail.</p>\n<p id=\"b441-5\"><em>Discussion. </em>I begin by examining the explanation that the trial judge himself offered for his guilty finding.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> That explanation followed closely on the heels of the closing arguments in which the parties debated whether the defendant\u2019s professed belief had to be objectively reasonable (in addition to being honestly held). In finding the defendant guilty, the trial judge indicated that he was relying on the presence of a no trespassing sign as having put the defendant \u201con notice\u201d that the property was not his for the taking. He further stated that the defendant\u2019s \u201chonest belief at that point would not be relevant.\u201d By these statements, the judge expressly acknowledged the possibility that the defendant honestly believed that the property had been abandoned, while finding no need to decide that factual question (it being, in the judge\u2019s view, irrelevant in light of the no trespassing sign). Accordingly, when his explanation is viewed in context, it is plain that the judge accepted the Commonwealth\u2019s view that an honest belief in the right to take property has to be objectively reasonable in order to justify an acquittal, and that he concluded that a reasonable person would have known that the property had not been abandoned based on the posting of a no trespassing sign in the area.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> The judge\u2019s guilty finding is thus <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"402\">*402</page-number>bound up in the view of the law urged by the Commonwealth.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> For the reasons that follow, I believe that view is incorrect.</p>\n<p id=\"b442-5\">\u201cA fundamental tenet of criminal law is that culpability requires a showing that the prohibited conduct (actus reus) was committed with the concomitant mental state (mens rea) prescribed for the offense.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Lopez, </em>433 Mass. 722, 725 (2001), citing <em>Morissette </em>v. <em>United States, </em>342 U.S. 246, 250 (1952). \u201cThe mistake of fact \u2018defense\u2019 is available where the mistake negates the existence of a mental state essential to a material element of the offense.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Lopez, supra. </em>Application of this principle, in theory, is straightforward: \u201cOne merely identifies the mental state or states required for the crime, and then inquires whether that mental state can exist in light of the defendant\u2019s ignorance or mistake of fact. . . .\u201d LaFave, Substantive Criminal Law \u00a7 5.6(b), at 397 (2d ed. 2003).</p>\n<p id=\"b442-6\">\u201cLarceny is the taking without right of the personal property of another with the <em>specific intent </em>to deprive the other of the property permanently\u201d (emphasis added). <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Murray, </em>401 Mass. 771, 772 (1988). The \u201cmental state . . . required for the crime\u201d of larceny is thus a specific intent to steal; and to sustain a conviction, the Commonwealth must prove that the defendant \u201cconsciously intended certain consequences, in this case [permanent deprivation of the property from its rightful owner], to result from his actions.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Gunter, </em>427 Mass. 259, 269 (1998).<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b442-7\">The case law has long recognized that a defendant cannot be guilty of larceny if she \u201ctook the [property] under an honest <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"403\">*403</page-number>belief that she had a legal right to it.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Stebbins, </em>8 Gray 492, 495 (1857). See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Hurd, </em>123 Mass. 438, 439 (1877) (defendant would not be guilty if he \u201chonestly believed he had the right to take and sell the property\u201d). In short, it is axiomatic that one cannot \u201cconsciously intend\u201d to steal property that one honestly believes he or she has the legal right to take.</p>\n<p id=\"b443-5\">An individual who appropriates abandoned property has not committed larceny, because abandoned property by definition has no owner. See <em>Griffith </em>v. <em>New England Tel. &amp; Tel. Co., </em>414 Mass. 824, 828 (1993). A belief that property is abandoned is thus a belief in a legal right to take that property. See Torcia, Wharton\u2019s Criminal Law \u00a7 78, at 560-561 (15th ed. 1993) (\u201c[A] defendant is not guilty of larceny for taking the property of another if he mistakenly believed that the property was his own or was abandoned\u201d [footnote omitted]). See also <em>Morissette </em>v. <em>United States, supra </em>at 276. Although the Commonwealth need not prove the precise identity of the rightful owner, a larceny conviction thus requires \u201ca showing that a possessory or other property interest in the thing stolen is in someone other than the thief and proof that the thief knew that he had no right to the property taken.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Souza, </em>397 Mass. 236, 238 (1986), quoting from <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Kiernan, </em>348 Mass. 29, 50 (1964), cert. denied sub nom. <em>Gordon </em>v. <em>Massachusetts, </em>380 U.S. 913 (1965). It follows from these long-established principles that were a fact finder to conclude that a defendant honestly believed that the property he took had been abandoned, that fact finder could not simultaneously conclude that the defendant specifically intended to steal the property. The test is one of subjective intention, not objective reasonableness.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b443-6\">Nevertheless, as the majority accurately observes, the Com<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"404\">*404</page-number>monwealth\u2019s position that a defendant\u2019s belief must be objectively reasonable (in addition to being honestly held) finds some support in the case law. Specifically, there are cases that speak in terms of a defendant\u2019s \u201chonest and reasonable belief.\u201d See, e.g., <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>White, </em>5 Mass. App. Ct. 483, 486-488 (1977). <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>White </em>appears to be the first Massachusetts appellate decision that referenced the \u201chonest and reasonable\u201d formulation in the context of a defense to larceny. That case, however, did not present the question whether an honest but objectively unreasonable belief that one is entitled to take property is a defense to larceny.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> Several cases subsequent to <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>White </em>borrow its use of the \u201chonest and reasonable\u201d phrasing. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Gelpi, </em>416 Mass. 729, 730-731 (1994); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Vives, </em>447 Mass. 537, 540-542 (2006); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Anslono, 9 </em>Mass. App. Ct. 867, 867-868 (1980); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Larmey, </em>14 Mass. App. Ct. 281, 283-285 (1982); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Newhook, </em>34 Mass. App. Ct. 960 (1993).<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> However, in none of these cases did the defendant appear to have argued that reversal was warranted because the fact finder could have found that his belief, while perhaps objectively unreasonable, was nonetheless honestly <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"405\">*405</page-number>held.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> Thus, neither we nor the Supreme Judicial Court have had occasion previously to consider the specific question currently before us. The majority has not identified any Massachusetts case that squarely holds that a belief in the right to take property must be reasonable to negate the intent to steal.</p>\n<p id=\"b445-5\">The \u201chonest and reasonable\u201d formulation adopted in <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>White </em>appears to derive from cases that involve defenses to general intent crimes. A defendant charged with such a crime may under some circumstances argue that, although the Commonwealth has proved all essential elements of the crime, he should not be convicted because he believed, albeit mistakenly, that facts existed which would have excused or justified his conduct. See, e.g., <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Power, </em>7 Met. 596, 602 (1844); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Presby, </em>14 Gray 65, 68-69 (1859). In this context, a defense of this nature \u201crequires that the accused act in good faith and with reasonableness.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Sherry, </em>386 Mass. 682, 697 (1982). For example, the law does not excuse or justify criminal conduct based on an unreasonable belief in the need for force in defense of oneself or another. See, e.g., <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Haddock, </em>46 Mass. App. Ct. 246, 248-249 (1999).</p>\n<p id=\"b445-6\">However, with respect to specific intent crimes such as larceny, the context is markedly different. The question for the fact finder is not whether the defendant has behaved reasonably but instead whether he actually possessed the requisite mental state.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> As noted, by definition, one cannot consciously intend to steal <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"406\">*406</page-number>property that he honestly believed he had a legal right to take. Allowing a larceny conviction even where a defendant honestly believed that the property had been abandoned would be tantamount to substituting mere negligence for specific intent. With regard to the crime of receiving stolen property, the Supreme Judicial Court has recognized the inappropriateness of allowing negligence to stand in for a higher mens rea. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Dellamano, </em>393 Mass. 132, 138 (1984), quoting from <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Boris, </em>317 Mass. 309, 315 (1944) (holding that because guilty knowledge is element of crime of receiving stolen property, that crime \u201cis not proved by negligence nor by failure to exercise as much intelligence as the ordinarily prudent man\u201d). There is no reason why this same principle should not be applied to the specific intent crime of larceny.</p>\n<p id=\"b446-4\">We have previously explored this difference between specific and general intent crimes in the context of a mistake of fact defense that a defendant sought to raise in a rape case. As we explained in <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Simcock, </em>31 Mass. App. Ct. 184, 189 (1991), because rape is a general intent crime in Massachusetts, \u201c[a] requirement for an instruction based upon one\u2019s actual mistake as to consent without regard to its reasonableness would be difficult to justify.\u201d<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> At the same time, however, we noted that were Massachusetts a jurisdiction where a rape conviction required proof of specific intent, an \u201chonest belief (whether reasonable or not)\u201d would suffice to negate that intent and mandate an acquittal. <em>Ibid.., </em>citing <em>Regina </em>v. <em>Morgan, </em>1976 App. Cas. 182, 214 (English law). The same should follow in a prosecution for larceny, which does require proof of specific intent.</p>\n<p id=\"b446-5\">Although Massachusetts courts have not squarely addressed the question before us, courts in many other jurisdictions have <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"407\">*407</page-number>done so. There are at least fourteen jurisdictions whose courts have concluded that an honest belief in the right to take property, even if unreasonable, is inconsistent with an intent to steal.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> For example, in a case very similar to the one at bar, a California appellate court reversed a defendant\u2019s conviction of stealing materials from a construction site because the trial judge erroneously instructed the jury that even if they concluded that the defendant honestly believed the materials were abandoned, they should still convict unless such a belief was reasonable. See <em>People </em>v. <em>Navarro, </em>99 Cal. App. 3d Supp. 1,11 (App. Dept. Super. Ct. 1979) (if the jury \u201cconcluded that defendant in good faith believed that he had the right to take the beams, even though such belief was unreasonable as measured by the objective standard of a hypothetical reasonable man, defendant was entitled to an acquittal since the specific intent required to be proved as an element of the offense had not been established\u201d). In many other jurisdictions, courts have simply noted that an \u201chonest\u201d or \u201cgood faith\u201d belief in the right to take property is incompatible with an intent to steal, without discussing the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"408\">*408</page-number>issue of reasonableness.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> Neither the Commonwealth nor the majority has identified any case holding that a defendant may be found to possess the specific intent to steal property that he honestly believed he had the legal right to take.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> We are now the first appellate court anywhere to reach that conclusion.</p>\n<p id=\"b448-5\">The case law is consistent with the major commentators on the criminal law. As one leading treatise states, \u201c[tjhere is no such thing in the common law as larceny by negligence. One does not commit this crime by carrying away the chattel of another in the mistaken belief that it is his own, no matter how great may have been the fault leading to this belief, if the belief itself is genuine.\u201d Dripps, Boyce, &amp; Perkins, Criminal Law &amp; Procedure 868 (12th ed. 2013). Accord American Law Institute, Model Penal Code and Commentaries \u00a7 2.04 (1985); <em>id. </em>at \u00a7 223.1(3) (1980); LaFave, Substantive Criminal Law \u00a7 5.6(b) (2d ed. 2003); Robinson, Criminal Law Defenses \u00a7 62(b) (1984); Torcia, Wharton\u2019s Criminal Law \u00a7 78 (15th ed. 1993). See also Nolan &amp; Sartorio, Criminal Law \u00a7 686, at 722 (3d ed. 2001) (\u201cIf a person honestly but mistakenly believes that the property which he is taking from the victim by force or fear is his own, this element [intent to steal] is not present, and he cannot be <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"409\">*409</page-number>found guilty of robbery\u201d). See generally 50 Am. Jur. 2d Larceny \u00a7 42 (2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b449-5\">In sum, in my view, the nature of larceny as a specific intent crime and the overwhelming weight of authority support the defendant\u2019s view of the law. I therefore believe that where a defendant puts at issue his belief that the property he took had been abandoned, see note 12, <em>supra, </em>the Commonwealth must prove that the defendant \u201cknew that he had no right to the property taken,\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Souza, </em>397 Mass, at 238, quoting from <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Kiernan, </em>348 Mass, at 50, not merely that a reasonable person in the defendant\u2019s position would have known. To the extent there is contrary dicta in <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>White, </em>5 Mass. App. Ct. at 486-488, and subsequent cases, I believe such statements are erroneous and should be corrected.</p>\n<p id=\"b449-6\">None of this discussion is to suggest that the objective unreasonableness of a defendant\u2019s professed belief therefore would be beside the point. Under a proper view of the law, a fact finder would remain free to consider the reasonableness of a defendant\u2019s claims, and indicia of unreasonableness might well provide convincing evidence that a defendant\u2019s professed belief was not in fact honestly held. See <em>People </em>v. <em>Navarro, 99 </em>Cal. App. 3d Supp. at 11 (\u201c[I]f the jury thought the defendant\u2019s belief to be unreasonable, [they] might infer that he did not in good faith hold such belief\u201d).<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> Objective reasonableness and unreasonableness therefore would continue to play an important evidentiary role, and in a jury trial, the Commonwealth would be entitled to an instruction that the jury may weigh the objective reasonableness of a defendant\u2019s professed belief in considering whether it was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"410\">*410</page-number>genuinely held. However, if a fact finder did conclude that the defendant\u2019s belief, though objectively unreasonable, was honestly held, then \u2014 in my view \u2014 he would be entitled to an acquittal.</p>\n<p id=\"b450-5\">As noted, the judge in this case indicated that he was resting the guilty finding on his view that any belief by the defendant that the property had been abandoned would not have been reasonable in the circumstances. As a result, the defendant was convicted without any determination by the fact finder that he possessed the specific intent to steal. I therefore would vacate the judgment and set aside the guilty finding.<footnotemark>18</footnotemark></p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b438-8\">At the same time, I disagree with the defendant\u2019s contention that the judge specifically found that the defendant honestly held his professed belief. Instead, as discussed <em>infra, </em>the judge saw no need to resolve that question. Moreover, the evidence, when viewed in the light most favorable to the Commonwealth, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"399\">*399</page-number>was plainly sufficient to support a conviction of larceny. Therefore, the Commonwealth would be entitled to seek a retrial even if the conviction were vacated.</p>\n<p id=\"b439-8\">I concur in part 3 of the court\u2019s opinion (concerning the adequacy of the defendant\u2019s jury trial waiver).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b439-9\">The statements that follow present a neutral recounting of the trial evidence. I note, however, that in considering whether the defendant fairly raised his defense that he honestly believed he had a right to take the property, the defendant is entitled to have the evidence viewed in a light most favorable to him. Compare <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Kingston, </em>46 Mass. App. Ct. 444, 449-450 (1999). Cf. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Pike, </em>428 Mass. 393, 395 (1998) (in determining whether defendant is entitled to instruction on self-defense, \u201call reasonable inferences should be resolved in favor of the defendant, and, no matter how incredible his testimony, that testimony must be treated as true\u201d). For its part, the majority improperly views the trial evidence in a light favorable to the Commonwealth. For example, the majority, <em>ante </em>at 389-390, rejects the defendant\u2019s explanation for why his trial testimony was in fact fully consistent with earlier statements he had made to police (see note 3, <em>infra), </em>and concludes that the defendant \u201cchanged [his] story\u201d after he \u201clied when first confronted by the police\u201d (even though the trial judge made no findings on such issues). This amounts to appellate fact finding.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b440-7\">The police witness testified that the defendant initially \u201cadmitted to taking <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"401\">*401</page-number>the property, but he was adamant that it was from another location.\u201d The defendant did not dispute that he made such statements, but he claims that his denials were specific to certain steel plates found in his truck, and that the officer\u2019s testimony is not to the contrary. The defendant has consistently maintained that the steel plates were taken from a different location. Lufkin testified that the plates were from the site.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b441-9\">The presumption that a judge sitting without a jury has correctly instructed himself on the law applies only \u201cabsent contrary indication.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Kerns, </em>449 Mass. 641, 650 n.13 (2007).

Although we specifically commented that the defendant was entitled to an instruction that he should be acquitted of larceny if the jury concluded that he \u201chonestly and reasonably believed\u201d he was entitled to the money, the question whether an honest but unreasonable belief would likewise merit acquittal was not presented or considered, and the court\u2019s attention remained focused on the possibility of \u201can honest belief on the defendant\u2019s part.\u201d <em>Ibid. </em>Moreover, the \u201chonest and reasonable\u201d formulation was not accompanied by any analysis, explanation, or supporting citation to an appellate opinion.

Therefore, a defendant charged with a crime requiring proof of intent to steal would be entitled to an acquittal if he negligently or recklessly took someone else\u2019s property, notwithstanding the fact that negligent or reckless conduct is ordinarily considered \u201cunreasonable.\u201d <em>Ibid.</em></p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"17\">\n<p id=\"b449-7\">As in any other case where a defendant\u2019s state of mind is at issue, a jury in a case such as this one must assess the defendant\u2019s credibility in light of all the facts and circumstances and determine whether the Commonwealth has proved beyond a reasonable doubt that he possessed the requisite mens rea.
