L. c. 152, \u00a7 11D(3), an insurer brought an action in Superior Court against Shawn Hough, seeking to recoup excess workers\u2019 compensation benefits it had paid to him. Hough successfully defended against that action, and the sole question raised by this appeal is whether he is thereby entitled to attorney\u2019s fees. Because we agree with the Superior Court judge that the answer is \u201cno,\u201d we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b571-14\"><em>Background. </em>Hough was employed by Athol Table, LLC. Based on a 2002 workplace incident, Hough sought workers\u2019 compensation benefits. By decision dated September 29, 2006, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"532\">*532</page-number>an administrative judge of the Department of Industrial Accidents (DIA) ultimately ruled in favor of the employer\u2019s insurer, Associated Industries of Massachusetts Mutual Insurance Company (insurer). Although the administrative judge determined that Hough suffered from a permanent disability, she concluded that he failed to demonstrate that his disability was causally related to the 2002 incident. Hough initially pursued, but then abandoned, an appeal. Accordingly, the correctness of the administrative judge\u2019s decision is not before us.</p>\n<p id=\"b572-5\">Subsequent to the administrative judge\u2019s decision, the insurer filed an action in Superior Court pursuant to G. L. c. 152, \u00a7 11D(3), seeking to recoup the partial incapacity benefits that it had been ordered to pay by an earlier conference order. After trial, a Superior Court judge allowed Hough\u2019s motion for a required finding based on his inability to pay. The insurer does not challenge that ruling; in fact, the insurer acknowledged Hough\u2019s inability to pay after the close of evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b572-6\">Having successfully defended against the recoupment action, Hough argued that he was entitled to attorney\u2019s fees. Unable to identify a statute that expressly authorizes fee shifting in this specific context, Hough relied \u201cby analogy\u201d on various fee-shifting provisions set forth in the workers\u2019 compensation act, G. L. c. 152 (act).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Discerning no statutory basis for awarding fees, the judge denied Hough\u2019s request. Hough timely appealed.</p>\n<p id=\"b572-7\"><em>Discussion. </em>\u201cOur traditional and usual approach to the award of attorney\u2019s fees for litigation has been to follow the \u2018American Rule\u2019: in the absence of statute, or court rule, we do not allow successful litigants to recover their attorney\u2019s fees and expenses.\u201d <em>John T. Callahan &amp; Sons </em>v. <em>Worcester Ins. Co., </em>453 Mass. 447, 449 (2009). Even in the limited circumstances where exceptions to the American Rule have been recognized, they are narrowly construed. See <em>Wilkinson </em>v. <em>Citation Ins. Co., </em>447 Mass. 663, 669 (2006) (limiting circumstances under which insured party can recover attorney\u2019s fees in litigation against its insurer). Because the act expressly addresses fee shifting in a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"533\">*533</page-number>variety of circumstances, we begin our analysis there. See generally <em>Rotondi </em>v. <em>Contributory Retirement Appeal Bd., </em>463 Mass. 644, 648 (2012), quoting from <em>Hoffman </em>v. <em>Howmedica, Inc., </em>373 Mass. 32, 37 (1977) (recognizing that statutory language is \u201cthe principal source of insight into the legislative purpose\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"ARy\">Section 11D(3) of the act governs the procedure by which an insurer can pursue recoupment of excess benefits it paid pursuant to a conference order. Where, as here, the insurer cannot recover overpayments by unilaterally reducing the employee\u2019s ongoing benefits, the statute allows the insurer to pursue either of two procedural routes. Under the first, the insurer can seek recoupment administratively by filing a complaint with the DIA pursuant to G. L. c. 152, \u00a7 10. See G. L. c. 152, \u00a7 11D(3). Under the second, the insurer can file a complaint directly in Superior Court. <em>Ibid. </em>See <em>Home Depot </em>v. <em>Kardas, </em>81 Mass. App. Ct. 27, 31 (2011) (recognizing that, in addition to being able to pursue recoupment administratively, insurer is \u201centitled under G. L. c. 152, \u00a7 11D, to bring an action directly in the Superior Court to obtain an order of recoupment\u201d). In this case, the insurer sought recoupment via the latter route.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b573-6\">Both parties acknowledge that Hough would have been entitled to attorney\u2019s fees if the insurer had opted to pursue recoupment through the administrative path and was met with the same lack of success. That is because, by specific statutory provision, employees who prevail in a hearing before the DIA are entitled to a presumptive fee award of $3,500 plus necessary expenses (with the administrative judge authorized to adjust the fee upwards or downwards depending on the circumstances). G. L. c. 152, \u00a7 13A(5).<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> As Hough all but concedes, the particular <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"534\">*534</page-number>language used in \u00a7 13A(5) indicates that its applicability is limited to administrative proceedings. For example, the events that trigger a fee award are tied to \u201ca hearing pursuant to section eleven,\u201d and the amount of the fee award is to be set by the \u201cadministrative judge.\u201d There is no language in \u00a7 13A(5), or anywhere else in the act, that confers fees on employees who prevail in recoupment actions brought in Superior Court.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b574-4\">Thus, under the terms of the act, employees are expressly entitled to a fee award when they successfully defend a recoupment proceeding that the insurer initiated before the DIA, but there is no such entitlement when the insurer unsuccessfully sought recoupment directly in Superior Court.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> According to Hough, this incongruity makes no sense. In addition, Hough <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"535\">*535</page-number>maintains that as a practical matter, those who face recoupment actions are able to secure legal representation only because of the prospect that they will obtain attorney\u2019s fees if they prevail. Therefore, according to Hough, the unavailability of fee shifting in Superior Court recoupment actions would leave most defendants in those actions unrepresented.</p>\n<p id=\"b575-5\">We recognize that there is at least some force to such arguments. In the end, however, \u201c[i]t is not the province of this court to \u2018read into the statute a provision which the Legislature did not see fit to put there, whether the omission came from inadvertence or of set purpose.\u2019 \u201d <em>Provencal </em>v. <em>Commonwealth Health Ins. Connector Authy., </em>456 Mass. 506, 516 (2010), quoting from <em>General Elec. Co. </em>v. <em>Department of Envtl. Protection, </em>429 Mass. 798, 803 (1999). In fact, the Supreme Judicial Court has previously applied this general principle in circumstances closely analogous to those of the present case. See <em>Rival\u2019s Case, </em>383 Mass. 172, 173-176 (1981). In <em>Rival\u2019s Case, </em>the question was whether an employee who prevailed in his workers\u2019 compensation appeal, after having lost at earlier stages, was entitled to attorney\u2019s fees. <em>Id. </em>at 173-174. The act at the time allowed a prevailing employee an attorney\u2019s fees award on appeal only when the appeal was initiated by the insurer, not when the employee had to initiate his own appeal. <em>Id. </em>at 175-176. While recognizing that this hole in the statute may have been inadvertent and that it had anomalous policy consequences, the court upheld the denial of fees, observing that the \u201cLegislature has exercised its judgment concerning the award of counsel fees at various stages of workmen\u2019s compensation litigation, and we see no justification for substituting our own views on the subject.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 176-177. Here, as in <em>Rival\u2019s Case, </em>\u201cthe judgment whether to allow counsel fees is a legislative one.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 176. Of course, to the extent that the act reflects an inadvertent omission, the Legislature remains free to correct it.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b575-6\"><em>Conclusion. </em>Because no provision of G. L. c. 152 authorizes an award of attorney\u2019s fees for an employee who prevails in a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"536\">*536</page-number>recoupment action filed in Superior Court, we affirm the order of the Superior Court judge denying Hough\u2019s request for attorney\u2019s fees.</p>\n<p id=\"b576-5\">\n<em>So ordered.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b572-8\">Hough also asserted that his economic circumstances were so obviously dire that the insurer\u2019s recoupment action was frivolous. On this basis, he initially argued that he was entitled to fees pursuant to G. L. c. 231, \u00a7 6F. Hough has since abandoned that argument.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b573-7\">A prerequisite to either path is a ruling from an administrative judge or court \u201cwhich indicates that overpayments have been made.\u201d G. L. c. 152, \u00a7 11D(3), inserted by St. 1991, c. 398, \u00a7 32. In his brief, Hough argued \u2014 based on the doctrine of primary jurisdiction \u2014 that an insurer cannot pursue a recoupment action in Superior Court until the DIA has itself fully resolved whether recoupment is appropriate and, if so, how much. At oral argument, Hough abandoned this argument.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b573-8\">Section 13A(5), as amended by St. 1991, c. 398, \u00a7 35, is not specific to recoupment actions but applies more generally. Its full text reads:</p>\n<p id=\"b573-10\">\u201cWhenever an insurer files a complaint or contests a claim for benefits <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"534\">*534</page-number>and then either (i) accepts the employee\u2019s claim or withdraws its own complaint within five days of the date set for a hearing pursuant to section eleven; or (ii) the employee prevails at such hearing the insurer shall pay a fee to the employee\u2019s attorney in an amount equal to three thousand five hundred dollars plus necessary expenses. An administrative judge may increase or decrease such fee based on the complexity of the dispute or the effort expended by the attorney.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b574-8\">The other fee-shifting section cited by Hough, G. L. c. 152, \u00a7 12A, is plainly inapplicable. By its terms, the first sentence of \u00a7 12A awards fees to an employee who prevails in an appellate proceeding, not in an action before the Superior Court. Likewise, the second sentence of \u00a7 12A awards fees to a party that prevails in a Superior Court action taken pursuant to \u00a7 12 to enforce an administrative order. That sentence has no application here, because Hough was not seeking to enforce an administrative order. However, the sentence does underscore the Legislature\u2019s ability to provide for an award of fees in Superior Court when it chooses to do so. See G. L. c. 152, \u00a7 12(1), (3) (setting forth cost-shifting mechanism for enforcement of DIA orders).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b574-9\">This incongruity can be traced to the 1991 amendments to the act. Immediately prior to these amendments, there was no statutory provision that specifically addressed recoupment. However, the DIA entertained recoupment requests through its catch-all authority to hear administrative complaints \u201crequesting resolution of any other issue arising under this chapter.\u201d G. L. c. 152, \u00a7 10, as amended by St. 1987, c. 691, \u00a7 5. See <em>Pedro\u2019s Case, </em>3 Mass. Workers\u2019 Comp. Rep. 76 (1989). Although there was no attorney\u2019s fee provision specific to recoupment actions, \u00a7 13A(5), then, as now, generally allowed fee shifting when insurers unsuccessfully pursued administrative complaints. By inserting \u00a7 11D, the 1991 amendments both gave insurers the right to file recoupment actions in court, and specifically codified their already recognized right to pursue recoupment administratively. There were no corresponding new fee-shifting provisions inserted. See St. 1991, c. 398, \u00a7 32. Neither party has presented us with legislative history that sheds light on such changes.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b575-7\">In 1985, the Legislature in fact addressed the problem identified in <em>Rival\u2019s Case, supra. </em>Under the revision, prevailing employees are now entitled to attorney\u2019s fees in appellate proceedings no matter which party initiates the appeal. See G. L. c. 152, \u00a7 12A, as amended by St. 1985, c. 572, \u00a7 27.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
