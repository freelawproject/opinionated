Lot 7 contains approximately 23,550 square feet with 106 feet of frontage; lot 8 contains approximately 18,410 square feet with 106.2 feet of frontage; and lot 9 contains 6,467 square feet with 73.4 feet of frontage. Lots 8 and 9 together contain 24,877 square feet and 179.6 feet of frontage. When considered as a single parcel, the three lots together contain 48,427 square feet and 285.6 feet of frontage.</p>\n<p id=\"b192-6\">Shortly after the lots were created in 1925, lot 7 was sold separately from lots 8 and 9. Lots 8 and 9 have never been in separate ownership from one another, and the plaintiff concedes they have merged for purposes of zoning. Lot 7 remained in separate ownership from lots 8 and 9 until 1984 when Richard and Jane Cutter, who had taken title to lot 7 in 1967, took title to lots 8 and 9 as well. The three lots thereafter remained in common ownership and were conveyed to the Timperios by a single deed in 1994.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b192-7\">Weston first adopted its zoning by-law (by-law) in 1928, requiring a minimum lot size of 10,000 square feet in the district where lots 7, 8, and 9 are located. Subsequent amendments to the by-law increased the square footage, frontage, and setback requirements. By 1954, the minimum area requirement was 60,000 square feet, and the minimum frontage required was 200 feet. These were the requirements in effect in April of 1997, in the zoning district in which lots 7, 8, and 9 are located. In May <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"153\">*153</page-number>of 1997, the town increased the minimum street frontage requirement to 250 feet and also increased by 50 feet the requirement for lot width at the street setback line. The 1997 amendments were in place when the plaintiff\u2019s 2011 application for a variance and special permit, at issue in this case, was filed.</p>\n<p id=\"b193-5\">The Timperios\u2019 single-family home, originally constructed in 1929, is located on lot 7. Lots 8 and 9 are unimproved. In 1996, the board granted the Timperios a variance from certain setback requirements for an addition to their home, specifying that the variance was for lots 7, 8, and 9 as a single parcel containing 48,427 square feet. The Timperios also sought and received a finding pursuant to G. L. c. 40A, \u00a7 6, first par., applicable to approval of additions to preexisting nonconforming structures, that \u201cthe proposed addition to the preexisting nonconforming structure will not be substantially more detrimental to the neighborhood than the preexisting nonconforming structure and preexisting nonconforming lot.\u201d In the 1996 variance decision, the board expressed its view that, contrary to the Timperios\u2019 contention, a request for a variance for lot 7, alone, was not properly before the board.</p>\n<p id=\"b193-6\">The Timperios, however, desired a variance for lot 7, individually. Rather than appeal, they decided not to record the 1996 variance or seek a building permit pursuant to it, allowed it to lapse, and in 1997, reapplied for a variance and \u00a7 6 finding applicable to lot 7 only. During the 1997 proceedings, the Timperios made a request for a specific finding that lot 7 \u201cretained its separate status\u201d from lots 8 and 9. In an April 28, 1997, decision granting the variance, the board wrote that lot 7 \u201cwas separately owned in 1954 when the zoning was changed making it preexisting nonconforming. According to the opinion of Ms. Cutler (as Town Counsel advising the Board of Health), Lot 7 retain[s] its \u2018grandfathered\u2019 status as a single, protected lot for zoning purposes, even though the additional adjoining land (Lots 8 and 9) has since been acquired.\u201d The variance decision further notes that \u201cLots 8 and 9 are small and partially wet. Their value might be in a conveyance to the abutters . . . to the rear, to create frontage, presently lacking.\u201d Finally, the board specifically found that \u201cLot 7 retains its separate status as a preexisting nonconforming lot . . . .\u201d Neither the town, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"154\">*154</page-number>nor abutters, who had supported the variance for the addition, appealed from that decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b194-5\">Some fourteen years later, in 2011, Nicolas Timperio, trustee, desiring to construct a new home on lots 8 and 9, sought a variance from the by-law\u2019s sideline and centerline setback requirements, as well as a special permit and finding pursuant to G. L. c. 40A, \u00a7 6, first par., that \u201cthe proposed structure . . . will not be detrimental to the neighborhood,\u201d and a finding that \u201cthe lot\u201d (presumably lots 8 and 9) \u201cretains its status as a preexisting nonconforming lot.\u201d The board denied the application on the grounds that (i) lots 8 and 9 had merged with lot 7 for zoning purposes by virtue of the May, 1997, by-law amendments, and (ii) even if considered separately from lot 7, the parcel comprised of lots 8 and 9 did not meet the requirements for a variance, and \u201cthe proposed construction would be substantially detrimental to the public good and the neighborhood, and a substantial derogation from the intent and purpose of the Zoning By-law, as amended.\u201d Although the board\u2019s 2011 decision explicitly recognized its April, 1997, variance decision, the board noted that following the 1997 decision, in May of 1997, the town had further increased the required minimum street frontage and the requirement for lot width at the street setback line by 50 feet \u201cin order to address construction elements threatening Weston\u2019s rural character.\u201d The board concluded that, regardless of the April, 1997, board decision, lots 7, 8, and 9 had all merged by operation of law in May, 1997, because at the time the 1997 amendment was enacted, the three lots were held in common ownership, and even when considered in the aggregate, the parcel consisting of lots 7, 8, and 9 did not meet all of the 1997 minimum zoning requirements. The board further noted that, although still nonconforming, the merged parcel was less nonconforming than the lots considered separately.</p>\n<p id=\"b194-6\">Although Timperio\u2019s motion for summary judgment is not contained in the record appendix, so far as we can discern, on appeal to the Land Court, Timperio argued that the board\u2019s finding in the 1997 variance decision, that lot 7 retained its separate status, constituted a determination that lot 7 had not merged with lots 8 and 9, and, pursuant to principles of res judicata, the finding was binding on the board in deciding the plaintiff\u2019s 2011 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"155\">*155</page-number>application. The Land Court judge granted summary judgment to the defendants, concluding that at least in the circumstances of this case, the unappealed 1997 decision of the board was not entitled to res judicata due to the absence of formalities in proceedings before such boards and because the issue before the board in 1997 was whether lot 7 qualified for a variance, not whether lots 8 and 9 were buildable separately from lot 7. The plaintiff appeals.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b195-5\"><em>Discussion. </em>1. <em>Common-law merger. </em>It is well settled that \u201c[ujnder the common-law merger doctrine, when adjacent nonconforming lots come into common ownership, they are normally merged and treated as a single lot for zoning purposes.\u201d <em>Hoffman </em>v. <em>Board of Zoning Appeal of Cambridge, </em>74 Mass. App. Ct. 804, 811 (2009). Although the reasons for its April, 1997, finding are unclear, the board did not apply the merger doctrine to the Timperios\u2019 1997 variance application and specifically found that lot 7 \u201cretains its separate status as a preexisting nonconforming lot.\u201d Timperio urges that this finding required the board to continue to refrain from applying the merger doctrine in considering his 2011 application. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b195-6\">We start by reviewing the April 28, 1997, variance decision. Because \u201c[vjariances are not allowed as a matter of right and should be \u2018sparingly granted,\u2019 \u201d <em>Lussier </em>v. <em>Zoning Bd. of Appeals of Peabody, </em>447 Mass. 531, 534 (2006) (citations omitted), \u201cthe language of a variance \u2018is to be construed against the individual requesting the variance, rather than against the granting authority.\u2019 \u201d <em>Ibid., </em>quoting from <em>DiGiovanni </em>v. <em>Board of Appeals of Rockport, </em>19 Mass. App. Ct. 339, 347 (1985). In its 1997 decision, the board simply found that \u201cLot 7 retains its separate status as a preexisting nonconforming lot.\u201d The 1997 decision noted \u201cTown Counsel[\u2019s opinion] advising the Board of Health . . . [that] Lot 7 retained its \u2018grandfathered\u2019 status as a single, protected lot for zoning purposes, even though [it had come into common ownership with the adjoining lots 8 and 9].\u201d It is not clear, from either the board\u2019s 1997 decision or town counsel\u2019s separate opinion letter, whether town counsel <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"156\">*156</page-number>reached her opinion by analyzing the by-law, the common-law doctrine of merger, or the protections provided in G. L. c. 40A, \u00a7 6, fourth par., first sentence.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> Nor is the basis for the board\u2019s ultimate finding apparent, other than reliance on the opinion town counsel had provided to the board of health. The parties seem to agree that the board\u2019s 1997 finding equates to a finding that lot 7 had not \u201cmerged\u201d with lots 8 and 9. We assume without deciding that the parties are correct, and that, at least as of April 28, 1997, lot 7 had not merged with lots 8 and 9.</p>\n<p id=\"b196-5\">The plaintiff ignores the fact, however, that in its 2011 decision, the board did not purport to alter its 1997 finding. Rather, in determining that the three lots merged in May of 1997, the board focused on amendments to the zoning by-law that occurred after the date of the 1997 variance decision. In May of 1997, after the April, 1997, variance had issued, the town further increased to 250 feet the frontage requirements in the zoning district in which lots 7, 8, and 9 are located. Neither lot 7, standing alone, nor lots 8 and 9 combined, meet the 250 foot frontage requirement.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> When the increased frontage requirements were adopted, the Timperios undeniably owned all three lots. Thus, the board properly considered them merged in order to reduce zoning nonconformities. See <em>Seltzer </em>v. <em>Board of Appeals of Orleans, </em>24 Mass. App. Ct. 521, 522 (1987), and cases cited. We discern nothing in the 1997 variance decision that purports to perpetually exempt lot 7 from the merger doctrine in the face of subsequent by-law amendments. Nor does the plaintiff point to any language in the by-law that would exempt lots 7, 8, and 9 from being considered one lot in order to meet the requirements of the May, 1997, zoning amendment. See <em>Hoffman </em>v. <em>Board of Zoning Appeal of Cambridge, </em>74 Mass. App. Ct. at 812 (\u201cit is within the legislative power of the city to override the effects of the common-law merger doctrine and allow adjacent <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"157\">*157</page-number>nonconforming lots that come into common ownership to be treated as separate lots for zoning purposes\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b197-5\">Regardless of whether principles of res judicata would prevent the board from finding that the lots had merged before April 28, 1997, we are aware of no authority that would require the board to continue to apply its erroneous interpretation of the merger doctrine to conclude that lot 7 retained its \u201cseparate\u201d status even after the May, 1997, amendments to the by-law. Indeed, \u201c[t]he right of the public to have the zoning by-law properly enforced cannot be forfeited by the action of [a municipality\u2019s] officers.\u201d <em>Building Commr. of Franklin </em>v. <em>Dispatch Communications of New England, Inc., </em>48 Mass. App. Ct. 709, 715-716 (2000), quoting from <em>Building Inspector of Lancaster </em>v. <em>Sanderson, </em>372 Mass. 157, 162 (1977). We see no reason why this rationale would not apply to application of the merger doctrine.</p>\n<p id=\"b197-6\">2. <em>Statutory protection from merger. </em>Timperio also argues that G. L. c. 40A, \u00a7 6, fourth par., first sentence (reproduced in the margin),<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> precludes the board \u201cin perpetuity\u201d from finding that lots 8 and 9 merged with lot 7. We disagree. It is true that in <em>Rourke </em>v. <em>Rothman, </em>448 Mass. 190, 194 (2007), the Supreme Judicial Court stated that \u201cthe plain language of the first sentence of G. L. c. 40A, \u00a7 6, fourth par., grants a perpetual exemption from increased local zoning requirements to certain lots that were once buildable under local bylaws.\u201d That \u201cperpetual\u201d protection applies, however, only if the statutory criteria are met. \u201cThe purpose of the statutory grandfather provision is, to be sure, to \u2018protect[] a once valid lot from being rendered unbuildable for residential purposes,\u2019 <em>Sturges </em>v. <em>Chilmark, </em>380 Mass. 246, 261 (1980), but only if there is compliance with statutory conditions. The condition that the nonconforming lot \u2018not [be] held in common ownership with any adjoining land\u2019 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"158\">*158</page-number>represents a statutory codification of a principle of long-standing application in the zoning context: a landowner will not be permitted to create a dimensional nonconformity if he could have used his adjoining land to avoid or diminish the nonconformity.\u201d <em>Planning Bd. of Norwell </em>v. <em>Serena, </em>27 Mass. App. Ct. 689, 690 (1989), <em>S.C., </em>406 Mass. 1008 (1990).</p>\n<p id=\"b198-5\">In considering the application of the common ownership requirement of G. L. c. 40A, \u00a7 6, fourth par., to the 2011 variance application, it is the most recent instrument of record prior to the effective date of the zoning change that controls. <em>Adamowicz </em>v. <em>Ipswich, </em>395 Mass. 757, 762 (1985). The most recent instrument of record prior to the 1997 zoning change is the 1994 deed conveying all three lots to the Timperios. Since all three lots were in joint ownership at the time the by-law was amended in May of 1997, the protections of \u00a7 6, fourth par., first sentence, do not apply to lots 8 and 9, separate from lot 7; or to lot 7, separate from lots 8 and 9. Whatever the import of the board\u2019s 1997 finding that lot 7 retained its \u201cseparate status as a preexisting nonconforming lot,\u201d it does not equate to a finding that lot 7 was separately <em>owned </em>from lots 8 and 9, thereby somehow qualifying lot 7 for \u201cperpetual\u201d protection under \u00a7 6.</p>\n<p id=\"b198-6\"><em>Conclusion. </em>Simply stated, even assuming that the board made a binding finding in April of 1997 that lot 7 had not merged with lots 8 and 9 at that time, that finding did not protect lot 7 from merging with lots 8 and 9 at a later time, when the by-law was again amended, and the lots were held in common ownership. As the plaintiff has not demonstrated that the May, 1997, zoning amendment does not apply to lots 7, 8, and 9, we discern no reason to disturb the judge\u2019s decision affirming the board\u2019s denial of the plaintiff\u2019s 2011 application for a variance and special permit.</p>\n<p id=\"b198-7\">So much of the judgment as dismisses count II of the complaint is vacated, and the judgment shall be modified to declare that lots 8 and 9 are not protected by the provisions of G. L. c. 40A, \u00a7 6, fourth par., first sentence. As so modified, the judgment is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b198-8\">\n<em>So ordered.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b192-8\">The 1925 plan and all deeds relevant to the issue before us are recorded in the Middlesex County registry of deeds.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b192-9\">There is some suggestion in the record that the Timperios again separated ownership of lots 8 and 9 from lot 7 in April of 1998. The complaint alleges that by deed dated April 20, 1998, the Timperios conveyed lots 8 and 9 to Nicolas Timperio, trustee of the Newton Street II Trust, and on the same day conveyed lot 7 to a separate trust with Nicolas Timperio as trustee. The complaint further contends that on October 16, 2002, Nicolas Timperio, as trustee, conveyed lot 7 back to the Timperios as tenants by the entirety. In the affidavits in support of summary judgment, these transactions are not confirmed; Nicolas Timperio avers only that he is the sole trustee of the trust that owns \u201cthe real property that is the subject of the present lawsuit.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b195-7\">The plaintiff also seeks a declaration, pursuant to count II of the complaint, that lots 8 and 9 are protected by the provisions of G. L. c. 40A, \u00a7 6, fourth par., first sentence. See part 2, <em>infra.</em></p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b196-6\">In <em>Preston </em>v. <em>Board of Appeals of Hull, </em>51 Mass. App. Ct. 236, 243-244 (2001), issued after the board\u2019s 1997 decision in this case, we clarified that a lot that was separately owned when it became nonconforming, but which subsequently comes into common ownership with adjacent land, merges with the subsequently acquired land at least to the extent necessary to conform to the zoning requirements.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b196-7\">As we have noted, lot 7 has 106 feet of frontage.
