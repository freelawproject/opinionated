The plaintiffs previously filed a substantially similar case in the Delaware Court of Chancery. After four of the defendants moved to dismiss the Delaware claims for lack of personal jurisdiction, the plaintiffs voluntarily dismissed the Delaware suit in its entirety. Almost eight months later, the plaintiffs then filed this case in the Superior Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b116-11\">The primary issue on appeal is whether the plaintiffs are entitled to the benefit of the Massachusetts savings statute, G. L. c. 260, \u00a7 32, which permits claims that were timely when <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"77\">*77</page-number>originally filed to be refiled (despite the subsequent running of the limitations period) within one year after being dismissed \u201cfor any matter of form.\u201d We conclude that voluntary dismissals are not per se excluded from the scope of the savings statute. We also conclude, however, that the record does not establish that all the claims dismissed in the Delaware action were dismissed for a matter of form. Those claims that were not dismissed for a matter of form were properly dismissed by the Superior Court judge as untimely. Those claims for which a sufficient question of fact was raised in the Superior Court, at least at the pleading stage, as to whether they were voluntarily dismissed in the Delaware action because the plaintiffs had an objectively reasonable expectation that the claims would be involuntarily dismissed by the Delaware court for lack of personal jurisdiction (and hence dismissed for a matter of form) should not have been dismissed by the Superior Court judge as untimely. Finally, we reject the defendants\u2019 arguments that the complaint (a) contains insufficient allegations to establish the plaintiffs\u2019 standing under Cayman Islands law to assert a breach of fiduciary duty claim derivatively on behalf of Dutchess Private Equities Cayman Fund Ltd. (Dutchess Ltd.), (b) does not sufficiently allege duty or causation with respect to the claim of professional negligence against Sullivan Bille PC (Sullivan Bille), and (c) does not meet the plaintiffs\u2019 burden of a prima facie showing of personal jurisdiction over Dundee Leeds Management Services (Dundee Leeds).</p>\n<p id=\"b117-5\">1. <em>Allegations of the complaint. </em>In broad summary, the plaintiffs allege that they were induced to invest (and to remain invested) in two feeder hedge funds based on false representations concerning the investment strategy, criteria, and approach of the funds. In more detail, the Delaware and Superior Court complaints alleged the following.</p>\n<p id=\"b117-6\">The plaintiffs invested in two feeder funds: Dutchess Private Equities Fund, L.P. (Dutchess L.P.), a Delaware limited partnership, and Dutchess Ltd., a Cayman Islands exempt corporation. Three of the plaintiffs<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> (the Dutchess Ltd. plaintiffs) purchased <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"78\">*78</page-number>shares in Dutchess Ltd., while the other three plaintiffs<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> (the Dutchess L.P. plaintiffs) became limited partners in Dutchess L.P. The two feeder funds fed investor money to a master fund, Dutchess Private Equities Fund, Ltd., a Cayman Islands exempt corporation, which made all investments on their behalf.</p>\n<p id=\"b118-5\">The defendants are companies, professional service providers, and individuals who were involved with, and connected to, the feeder funds. Dutchess Capital Management, LLC (DCM), a Connecticut limited liability company, is the investment manager for both feeder funds, and is also the sole general partner of Dutchess L.P.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> Dutchess Advisors, LLC (Dutchess Advisors), also a Connecticut limited liability company, provides consulting services for the companies in which the master fund invested on behalf of the feeder funds. The two feeder funds, the master fund, DCM, and Dutchess Advisors all operated out of the same shared office in Boston.</p>\n<p id=\"b118-6\">The Dutchess family of entities share the three individual defendants as common key personnel. Defendant Douglas Leigh-ton, a Massachusetts citizen, and defendant Michael Novielli, a New York citizen, are cofounders, principals, and comanaging members of both DCM and Dutchess Advisors. They are also the sole directors of both Dutchess Ltd. and the master fund. In addition, they have full authority to conduct the affairs of Dutchess L.P. Defendant Theodore Smith, a Massachusetts citizen, holds various high-level offices within DCM, is the director of corporate finance for Dutchess L.P., and is the vice-president of business development for Dutchess Advisors.</p>\n<p id=\"b118-7\">Defendant Sullivan Bille is a Massachusetts professional corporation operating out of an office in Tewksbury. Sullivan Bille audited Dutchess L.P.\u2019s statements of financial condition as of December 31, 2005, and December 31, 2006, and provided unqualified audit opinions for those periods dated March 3, 2006, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"79\">*79</page-number>and April 17, 2007, respectively. Defendant Dundee Leeds is a Cayman Islands corporation operating out of an office in George Town, Grand Cayman. Dundee Leeds is the fund administrator for the two feeder funds, and is responsible for calculating the funds\u2019 net asset value (NAV) and providing that information to the funds.</p>\n<p id=\"b119-5\">Unable to improve upon the Superior Court judge\u2019s excellent summary of the substantive allegations of the complaint, we accordingly set it out here:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b119-6\">\u201cAccording to the complaint, the Dutchess defendants represented both orally and in writing that prospective investors\u2019 investments in the funds would be protected in three ways. First, companies targeted for investment would have a positive cash flow with which they could repay the funds. Second, the funds would invest only in freely trade-able and liquid companies that would permit the fluids to convert debt securities into newly-issued stock at less than market price. Third, the funds would lend money only to companies with sufficient assets to secure a substantial portion of the funds\u2019 investments. The Dutchess defendants assured investors that their due diligence would involve evaluating the business forecast, performance and stability of the target companies. They also asserted that they would refrain from any conduct that would create a conflict of interest between [DCM] and Dutchess Advisors (and their individual members and directors) on the one hand and the funds and their investors on the other hand.[<footnotemark>7</footnotemark>]</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b119-7\">\u201cThe gist of the plaintiffs\u2019 complaint is that the Dutchess defendants misrepresented their stated investment objectives and breached their fiduciary duties by making a series of questionable investments in two companies, Challenger Powerboats, Inc. [Challenger] and Siena Technologies <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"80\">*80</page-number>[Siena], starting in 2003. The complaint alleges that the Dutchess defendants departed from their standards and procedures concerning conflicts of interest when, beginning in 2003, they caused Dutchess L.P. and Dutchess Ltd. to invest approximately $30 million in Challenger and Siena for the purpose of enriching themselves personally through fees, stock grants and other compensation. They did so despite auditors\u2019 going concern qualifications for both companies year after year.<footnotemark>[8]</footnotemark> After the Dutchess defendants\u2019 efforts to salvage those companies failed, [DCM] by letter dated February 27, 2008, informed the plaintiffs that it would freeze their redemption rights in Dutchess L.P. and Dutchess Ltd. effective February 29, 2008. On April 16, 2008, the Dutchess defendants announced a $31 million write-down of three portfolios.[<footnotemark>9</footnotemark>,<footnotemark>10</footnotemark>]\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b121-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"81\">*81</page-number>The plaintiffs bring both derivative and direct claims.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> All plaintiffs make direct claims of fraud and negligent misrepresentation against DCM, Novielli, Leighton, and Smith (counts V-VII[2]). Derivatively, on behalf of both feeder funds, the plaintiffs claim that DCM, Novielli, Leighton, and Smith breached their fiduciary duties by not following the stated investment strategy and by enriching themselves at the expense of the plaintiffs (count I). Also in that capacity, they claim that the same defendants together with Dutchess Advisors were unjustly enriched (count IX). Finally, they bring a derivative professional malpractice claim against Dundee Leeds (count XI). The subgroup of Dutchess L.P. plaintiffs derivatively claim that DCM breached the covenant of good faith and fair dealing implied in the partnership agreement (count III), and that Sullivan Bille committed professional malpractice (count X). Directly, the Dutchess L.P. plaintiffs bring a claim against DCM for breach of contract (the partnership agreement) (count II).</p>\n<p id=\"b121-5\">2. <em>Procedural background, </em>a. <em>The Delaware suit. </em>On April 13, 2010, the plaintiffs filed suit in the Delaware Court of Chancery. The parties accept that all claims were timely asserted in the Delaware suit. Dutchess Advisors, Sullivan Bille, Dundee Leeds, and Dutchess Ltd.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> moved to dismiss for lack of personal jurisdiction. The remaining defendants raised no jurisdictional defense to the Delaware action.</p>\n<p id=\"b121-6\">We can infer<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> that, in response to the defendants\u2019 jurisdictional challenge, the plaintiffs filed a motion for jurisdictional discovery. We do so from the fact that the Delaware court denied such a motion \u201cexcept to the limited extent stated on the record with respect to Sullivan [Bille]. Plaintiffs shall have two weeks in which to file an answering brief in opposition to the underlying motions to dismiss or to amend their complaint.\u201d That order <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"82\">*82</page-number>was entered on October 21, 2010, after a hearing the same day.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b122-5\">Shortly thereafter, on November 4, 2010, the plaintiffs filed a proposed order of voluntary dismissal of all claims, pursuant to Delaware Court of Chancery Rule 41(a)(1),<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> and subject to court approval.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> No reason was given for the dismissal, but the proposed order stated that \u201c[pjursuant to Court of Chancery Rule 23.1(c),[<footnotemark>17</footnotemark>] the undersigned [plaintiffs\u2019 counsel] hereby represents that no compensation in any form has passed directly or indirectly from any Defendant to Plaintiffs or Plaintiffs\u2019 attorneys and that no promise to give any such compensation has been made.\u201d Apparently without any further procedure or pro<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"83\">*83</page-number>ceeding, the proposed order was approved by the court and entered the day after it was filed.</p>\n<p id=\"AZhi\">b. <em>The Massachusetts suit. </em>The plaintiffs then filed the complaint underlying this appeal in Superior Court on June 21, 2011. The parties accept for purposes of this appeal that the claims asserted in the Superior Court complaint accrued no later than April, 2008 \u2014 more than three years before the filing of the complaint. It is also not disputed that the claims raised in the Massachusetts action are substantially similar to ones raised in the Delaware suit.<footnotemark>18</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"A9u\">All defendants except for Dundee Leeds moved under Mass. R.Civ.P. 12(b)(6), 365 Mass. 754 (1974), to dismiss on the ground that the claims were barred by the applicable statutes of limitations.<footnotemark>19</footnotemark>,<footnotemark>20</footnotemark> The plaintiffs conceded that most of the claims are subject to three-year limitations periods under either Delaware or Massachusetts law,<footnotemark>21</footnotemark>,<footnotemark>22</footnotemark> but argued that the claims were nonetheless timely by virtue of the Massachusetts savings statute, G. L. c. 260, \u00a7 32, as appearing in St. 1973, c. 1114, \u00a7 340, which reads in relevant part,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AEp\">\u201cIf an action duly commenced within the time limited in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"84\">*84</page-number>this chapter ... is dismissed ... for any matter of form, . . . the plaintiff or any person claiming under him may commence a new action for the same cause within one year after the dismissal or other determination of the original action . . . .\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b124-5\">The plaintiffs argued that the savings statute applies because (1) the claims were timely when first asserted in Delaware; (2) the Delaware claims were dismissed for a matter of form, namely, lack of personal jurisdiction over some of the defendants; and (3) the same claims were filed in Superior Court within one year of the dismissal of the Delaware action.</p>\n<p id=\"b124-6\">The motions to dismiss were heard and allowed by a Superior Court judge sitting in the business litigation session. She mled as a matter of law that voluntary dismissals do not fall within the scope of the savings statute and that, therefore, all of the claims subject to three-year limitations periods were untimely filed in Massachusetts. She also concluded that the plaintiffs had failed to allege facts sufficient to establish standing to assert their breach of fiduciary duty claim derivatively on behalf of Dutchess Ltd. under Cayman Islands law (count I). Finally, she ruled that there is no personal jurisdiction in Massachusetts over Dundee Leeds and that, therefore, the professional malpractice claim against Dundee Leeds (count XI) should be dismissed. Judgment entered against the plaintiffs, and this appeal followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b124-18\">3. <em>Discussion, </em>a. <em>Savings statute. </em>Massachusetts has had a savings statute since the early 1770s, and its text has remained largely unmodified since then. See Province Laws 1770-1771, c. 9, \u00a7 3; St. 1793, c. 75, \u00a7 2; R.S. 1836, c. 119, \u00a7 15; R.S. 1836, c. 120, \u00a7 11; G.S. 1860, c. 154, \u00a7 15; G.S. 1860, c. 155, \u00a7 11; P.S. 1882, c. 196, \u00a7 12; PS. 1882, c. 197, \u00a7 13; R.L. 1902, c. 202, \u00a7 31; G. L. c. 260, \u00a7 32. From the beginning, the statute has allowed the refiling of a suit after the limitations period, provided the suit had been timely commenced previously and certain additional conditions have been met. \u201cThe plain purpose of the statute is to relieve a person who, in the exercise of due diligence, within the time limited by the general statute of limitations, has attempted to enforce a claim by suit, and has failed in such attempt by reason of some matter of form, which can be remedied in a new proceeding, and which <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"85\">*85</page-number>does not affect the merits of his case.\u201d <em>Cumming </em>v. <em>Jacobs, </em>130 Mass. 419, 421 (1881). \u201cThe statute is remedial, and its words are not to be construed unfavorably to the plaintiff.\u201d <em>Ibid. </em>\u201cThe provisions of G. L. c. 260, \u00a7 32, are to be constmed liberally, in the interest of determining the parties\u2019 rights on the merits.\u201d <em>Boutiette </em>v. <em>Dickinson, </em>54 Mass. App. Ct. 817, 818 (2002). The words of the statute \u201cnever have been held to have a technical meaning.\u201d <em>Loomer </em>v. <em>Dionne, </em>338 Mass. 348, 351 (1959), quoting from <em>Woods </em>v. <em>Houghton, </em>1 Gray 580, 583 (1854).</p>\n<p id=\"b125-5\">The 1793 version of the statute permitted the filing of a second suit where the first suit was \u201cabated, or the action thereby commenced [was] avoided by demurrer, or otherwise, <em>for informality of </em>proceedings\u201d (emphasis added). St. 1793, c. 75, \u00a7 2. Under R.S. 1836, c. 120, \u00a7 11, refiling was available where the first action was \u201cabated, or . . . otherwise avoided or defeated, . . . <em>for any matter of </em>form\u201d (emphasis added). This appears to be the earliest introduction into the statute of the phrase \u201cfor any matter of form.\u201d However, the change in phraseology was not a change in the law, <em>Allen </em>v. <em>Sawtelle, </em>7 Gray 165, 166 (1856), and the language was construed to mean that the first suit had been terminated for any reason that \u201cdid not concern the substance of the question in controversy between the parties, nor in any degree affect the merits of the suit.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 165. To like effect, the Supreme Judicial Court explained that the savings clause of a related statute of limitations (St. 1786, c. 52, \u00a7 1) \u201cdeclares that where the plaintiff has been defeated by some matter not affecting the merits, some defect or informality, which he can remedy or avoid by a new process, the statute shall not prevent him from doing so, provided he follows it promptly, by a suit within a year.\u201d <em>Coffin </em>v. <em>Cottle, </em>16 Pick. 383, 386 (1835).</p>\n<p id=\"b125-6\">The phrase \u201cfor any matter of form\u201d has remained in every version of the savings statute since 1836. See G.S. 1860, c. 155, \u00a7 11; P.S. 1882, c. 197, \u00a7 13; R.L. 1902, c. 202, \u00a7 31; G. L. c. 260, \u00a7 32. As noted earlier, the current statute provides that if a timely action \u201cis dismissed ... for any matter of form, . . . the plaintiff . . . may commence a new action for the same cause within one year after the dismissal or other deter<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"86\">*86</page-number>mination of the original action.\u201d<footnotemark>23</footnotemark> G. L. c. 260, \u00a7 32. This appeal turns on two questions: whether voluntary dismissals are per se excluded from the protection of the savings statute, and, if not, whether the voluntary dismissal in this case was for a matter of form. We take each question in turn.</p>\n<p id=\"b126-5\">i. <em>Are voluntary dismissals excluded from the savings statute? </em>The defendants argue that the statute extends only to suits that have been involuntarily dismissed by a court. The statute itself is silent, drawing no explicit distinction between voluntary and involuntary dismissals. G. L. c. 260, \u00a7 32. In this way, our statute stands in contrast to the savings statutes of other States, some of which explicitly exclude voluntary dismissals and others of which explicitly include them.<footnotemark>24</footnotemark> The defendants\u2019 argument therefore focuses on the phrases \u201cis dismissed\u201d and \u201cdismissal or other determination,\u201d both of which they contend imply court action, rather than voluntary dismissal. Our courts have not previously construed the statute this narrowly.<footnotemark>25</footnotemark> See, e.g., <em>Swan </em>v. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"87\">*87</page-number><em>Littlefield, </em>6 Cush. 417 (1850) (savings statute does not apply if voluntary nonsuit was on merits).</p>\n<p id=\"b127-4\">For example, in <em>Loomer </em>v. <em>Dionne, </em>338 Mass. 348 (1959), the plaintiffs\u2019 attorney sent to the deputy sheriffs a timely writ in Superior Court with directions to serve the defendant and make a real estate attachment. The writ described the action as in tort for personal injuries and consequential damages as a result of a motor vehicle accident. When plaintiffs\u2019 counsel attempted to enter the writ, he was told, correctly, that \u201cthe Superior Court no longer had jurisdiction of automobile tort actions\u201d; by statute, the District Court had exclusive original jurisdiction. <em>Id. </em>at 349. The plaintiffs\u2019 counsel for this reason then informed the defendant\u2019s counsel that he would commence suit instead in the District Court. By the time the District Court action was commenced, the statute of limitations had run. The Supreme Judicial Court held that the plaintiffs were entitled to the benefit of the savings statute even though the first action was voluntarily not pursued. The court explained,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b127-6\">\u201cthe error in bringing the action in the Superior Court, which lacked jurisdiction . . . , did not prevent the action from being \u2018duly commenced,\u2019 or from being \u2018avoided or defeated ... for any matter of form.\u2019 The first action notified the defendant that resort was to be made to the courts. There was no default or other neglect in the prosecution of a case legally pending in court as in <em>Cumming </em>v. <em>Jacobs, </em>130 Mass. 419 [1881], This is not a situation where the first action was intentionally brought in the wrong court.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b127-7\"><em>Id. </em>at 351-352.</p>\n<p id=\"b127-8\">Similarly, in <em>Duff v. Zonis, </em>327 Mass. 347, 349-350 (1951), the plaintiff\u2019s attorney, knowing that the statute of limitations would expire two days later (the first day being a holiday and the second a Saturday), prepared a timely writ in tort against the \u201cZonis Manufacturing Company\u201d without checking to make sure he had correctly named the defendant owner of the commercial truck involved in the accident with the plaintiff. The named company, which was listed as the owner on the truck\u2019s registration form, was in reality not a corporation but the busi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"88\">*88</page-number>ness name of a partnership. The deputy sheriff was unable to serve the writ, which was returned to the attorney and was never entered. The plaintiff subsequently brought suit against the properly named defendant partners after the statute of limitations had expired. The court held that the savings statute applied because the first action had been \u201cduly commenced\u201d within the limitations period, emphasizing a liberal construction of the statute. <em>Id. </em>at 350-352.</p>\n<p id=\"b128-4\">In sum, we see nothing in our case law to indicate that the savings statute applies only where the first action is involuntarily dismissed by a court. Instead, our cases indicate that we are to look to the specific facts and circumstances surrounding the termination of the first suit to determine whether <em>\u201cthe plaintiff </em>has been defeated by some matter not affecting the merits, some defect or informality, which he can remedy or avoid by a new process\u201d (emphasis added). <em>Woods </em>v. <em>Houghton, </em>1 Gray at 583, quoting from <em>Coffin </em>v. <em>Cottle, </em>16 Pick, at 386. The inquiry does not turn solely on whether the first suit was voluntarily or involuntarily dismissed, although that is certainly a factor to be considered.<footnotemark>26</footnotemark>,<footnotemark>27</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b128-5\">Our conclusion in this regard has the ancillary benefit of not creating a disincentive to plaintiffs who are frank and practical enough to acknowledge some defect of form in their suit and to voluntarily dismiss their claim as a result without further waste of scarce judicial resources. We see no reason to require further litigation simply to have the court dismiss involuntarily a claim the plaintiff is prepared to dismiss himself for the same defect of form.<footnotemark>28</footnotemark> See <em>Liberace </em>v. <em>Conway, </em>31 Mass. App. Ct. 40, 43 (1991) (\u201cIt would surely be anomalous to adopt a construction <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"89\">*89</page-number>of \u00a7 32 which deprived pendent claims of the statute\u2019s benefit and thereby pressed on the Federal courts retention of jurisdiction over those claims\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b129-5\">We turn next to the question whether the claims in this case were voluntarily dismissed for a matter of form.</p>\n<p id=\"b129-6\">ii. <em>Was the dismissal in this case for a matter of form? </em>Involuntary dismissal for lack of jurisdiction is dismissal \u201cfor a matter of form\u201d within the meaning of the savings statute. See <em>Ciampa </em>v. <em>Beverly Airport Commn., </em>38 Mass. App. Ct. 974, 974 (1995) (subject matter jurisdiction); <em>Boutiette </em>v. <em>Dickinson, </em>54 Mass. App. Ct. at 817, 818 (personal jurisdiction and subject matter jurisdiction); <em>Rodi </em>v. <em>Southern New England Sch. of Law, </em>389 F.3d 5, 18 (1st Cir. 2004) (\u201cA dismissal for lack of personal jurisdiction is the paradigmatic example of a decision not on the merits that can be cured by new process in a different court\u201d). In our view, a voluntary dismissal of claims made because of an objectively reasonable expectation that they would otherwise be involuntarily dismissed for lack of personal jurisdiction is also a dismissal for a matter of form within the meaning of the savings statute. The plaintiffs\u2019 reasons for dismissing the Delaware suit are a question of fact. See <em>Lawrence Sav. Bank </em>v. <em>Levenson, </em>59 Mass. App. Ct. 699, 709 (2003) (where plaintiff has claimed trial by jury, disputed issues relative to statute of limitations are to be decided by jury); <em>Khatchatourian </em>v. <em>Encompass Ins. Co. of Mass., </em>78 Mass. App. Ct. 53, 57 (2010) (plaintiffs\u2019 knowledge for purposes of statute of limitations is question of fact). Whether those reasons were a \u201cmatter of form\u201d within the meaning of G. L. c. 260, \u00a7 32, is a mixed question of law and fact. We review de novo the question whether the factual allegations properly before the judge on the motions to dismiss made plausible a resolution of that mixed question in the plaintiffs\u2019 favor. See <em>Iannacchino </em>v. <em>Ford Motor Co., </em>451 Mass. 623, 636 (2008).</p>\n<p id=\"b129-7\">As an initial matter, the defendants contend that they were entitled to judgment because the complaint was silent as to the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"90\">*90</page-number>existence of the Delaware suit, let alone the reasons for its dismissal. Therefore, they continue, the allegations of the complaint did not justify application of the savings statute. The defendants\u2019 argument fails because allegations relied on to toll the statute of limitations, or \u201csaving facts,\u201d need not be pleaded in a complaint. <em>Friedman </em>v. <em>Jablonski, </em>371 Mass. 482, 487 (1976). See <em>Passatempo </em>v. <em>McMenimen, </em>461 Mass. 279, 294 n.17 (2012). Instead, \u201c[i]f the defendants] pleaded the statute of limitations, the plaintiffs could allege the saving circumstance in reply to that defense.\u201d <em>Friedman, supra.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b130-5\">Here, the defendants raised the statutes of limitations in their motions to dismiss. At that point, \u201conce [a] defendant establishes that the time period between the plaintiff\u2019s injury and the plaintiff\u2019s complaint exceeds the limitations period set forth in the applicable statute, the plaintiff bears the burden of alleging facts which would take his or her claim outside the statute.\u201d <em>O\u2019Connor </em>v. <em>Redstone, </em>452 Mass. 537, 551 (2008), quoting from <em>McGuinness </em>v. <em>Cotter, </em>412 Mass. 617, 620 (1992). It was incumbent upon the plaintiffs, therefore, in opposition to the defendants\u2019 motions to dismiss, to allege facts supporting their entitlement to the savings statute. Those facts needed to be presented by \u201cpleadings, affidavits, or other documents presented to the motion judge for [her] consideration <em>in some proper man</em>ner\u201d (emphasis added). <em>Granahan </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>19 Mass. App. Ct. 617, 620 n.5 (1985).</p>\n<p id=\"b130-6\">It is important to identify what was and was not properly before the Superior Court judge. During the hearing, plaintiffs\u2019 counsel handed the judge a transcript of the Delaware hearing<footnotemark>29</footnotemark> and asked that she take judicial notice of its contents. Relying on <em>Rodi, </em>389 F.3d at 18-19, counsel asked the judge to take judicial notice (1) that some defendants moved to dismiss the claims against them for lack of personal jurisdiction in Delaware; (2) that during the hearing, the Vice Chancellor expressed extreme skepticism from the bench about the plaintiffs\u2019 jurisdictional theories; and (3) that the \u201cplaintiffs essentially didn\u2019t respond [to the motions] and decided to dismiss otherwise consistent with the court\u2019s discussion on the record that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"91\">*91</page-number>everybody, you know, that one of the options is to file in Massachusetts.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b131-5\">Even were we to accept the idea that Mass.R.Civ.P. 12(b)(6) permits consideration of matters outside the four comers of the complaint provided they are susceptible to judicial notice, see <em>Rodi, </em>389 F.3d at 12, judicial notice could not be taken of the plaintiffs\u2019 reasons for dismissing their claims \u2014 essentially questions of motivation and state of mind.<footnotemark>30</footnotemark> See <em>Day </em>v. <em>Crowley, </em>341 Mass. 666, 670 (1961) (undisclosed basis for prior decree cannot be judicially noticed). \u201cMatters are judicially noticed only when they are indisputably trae.\u201d <em>Nantucket </em>v. <em>Beinecke, </em>379 Mass. 345, 352 (1979). Moreover, \u201c[ajlthough we may take judicial notice of the docket entries and papers filed in separate cases, we may not take judicial notice of facts or evidence brought out in those separate actions.\u201d <em>Home Depot </em>v. <em>Kardas, </em>81 Mass. App. Ct. 27, 28 (2011). Thus, the contents of the Delaware transcript were not amenable to judicial notice. In addition, the judge was not required to consider materials, such as the Delaware transcript, that were not included with the papers on file, or attested to by way of affidavit, and were only handed to her informally during the hearing. The transcript of the Delaware hearing was not properly before the judge, and she correctly recognized that she could not take judicial notice of its contents.</p>\n<p id=\"b131-6\">Because the plaintiffs did not submit an affidavit stating the reasons why they dismissed the Delaware suit, the only remaining items that can be considered are the documents attached to the plaintiffs\u2019 opposition to the motion to dismiss, namely, the Delaware complaint, the Delaware order allowing only limited jurisdictional discovery, and the Delaware order of dismissal.<footnotemark>31</footnotemark> These documents do not state why the plaintiffs voluntarily dismissed the Delaware suit. However, their chronology demonstrates that the plaintiffs voluntarily dismissed their claims after some defendants moved to dismiss for lack of personal jurisdic<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"92\">*92</page-number>tion and after the court largely denied the plaintiffs\u2019 motion for jurisdictional discovery from those defendants. In addition, the voluntary dismissal was made without any consideration, shortly after the adverse discovery ruling, and before the plaintiffs\u2019 opposition to the motions to dismiss was due. This chronology raises a question of fact sufficient to survive a motion to dismiss that, as to the four defendants who challenged personal jurisdiction in Delaware, the plaintiffs dismissed their claims because they had an objectively reasonable expectation that the court would dismiss those claims on that ground. By contrast, the record is silent as to the plaintiffs\u2019 reason for dismissing their claims against the defendants who did not challenge jurisdiction. And, given that those defendants did not challenge jurisdiction, it is impossible to conclude or infer that the plaintiffs held an objectively reasonable belief that their claims against those defendants would be dismissed by the court for lack of personal jurisdiction.</p>\n<p id=\"b132-20\">As a result, the three-year claims against DCM, Novielli, Smith, and Leighton (who did not challenge personal jurisdiction in Delaware) are not entitled to the protection of the savings statute.<footnotemark>32</footnotemark> The three-year claims against Dutchess Advisors, Sullivan Bille, and Dundee Leeds<footnotemark>33</footnotemark> (all of whom moved to dismiss for lack of personal jurisdiction) are entitled to that protection at the motion to dismiss stage. Put another way, count I (breach of fiduciary duty) as brought derivatively on behalf of Dutchess Ltd. against DCM, Novielli, Smith, and Leighton; count IX (unjust enrichment) as against Dutchess Advisors; count X (professional malpractice) against Sullivan <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"93\">*93</page-number>Bille; and count XI (professional malpractice) against Dundee Leeds are not subject to dismissal at this point as time barred.</p>\n<p id=\"b133-5\">b. <em>Remaining issues. </em>We turn next to the defendants\u2019 additional arguments.<footnotemark>34</footnotemark> They are (1) that the plaintiffs lack standing under Cayman law to assert a claim for breach of fiduciary duty (count I) derivatively on behalf of Dutchess Ltd., (2) that the complaint fails to allege sufficiently both duty and causation with respect to the professional malpractice claim (count X) against Sullivan Bille, and (3) that the plaintiffs have failed to make a prima facie showing of personal jurisdiction over Dundee Leeds (count XI). We are unpersuaded.</p>\n<p id=\"b133-6\">i. <em>Derivative standing under Cayman law. </em>Because Dutchess Ltd. is a Cayman Islands corporation, Cayman law determines whether the plaintiffs have standing to bring a claim derivatively on its behalf. See <em>Harrison </em>v. <em>NetCentric Corp., </em>433 Mass. 465, 471 (2001) (\u201c[T]he State of incorporation dictates the choice of law regarding the internal affairs of a corporation\u201d). Under Cayman law,<footnotemark>35</footnotemark> derivative claims may not be pursued unless one of a few recognized exceptions applies, one of which is fraud on the minority. <em>Winn </em>v. <em>Schafer, </em>499 F. Supp. 2d 390, 396 (S.D.N.Y. 2007). See <em>Foss </em>v. <em>Harbottle, </em>(1843) 67 Eng. Rep. (Ch.) 189, 207-208. To fall within this exception, the alleged wrongdoers must have \u201ccontrol\u201d of the corporation, and commit a \u201cfraud\u201d against it. <em>Schultz </em>v. <em>Reynolds, </em>[1992-1993] C.I. L.R. 59, 72, 77, 79.</p>\n<p id=\"b133-7\">\u201cControl\u201d in this context is not limited to ownership of a majority of stock. Control can also be found where the wrongdoers have de facto control of the corporation. See <em>In re Tyco Intl, Ltd., </em>340 F. Supp. 2d 94, 99 (D.N.H. 2004) (applying English law); <em>Schultz, supra </em>at 80 (\u201c[Rjeality has to be taken into account in deciding control\u201d). \u201cFraud\u201d occurs either when \u201cdirectors who control a company have improperly appropri<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"94\">*94</page-number>ated to themselves money, property or advantages which belong to the company\u201d or when \u201cdirectors though acting \u2018in the belief that they were doing nothing wrong\u2019 ... are guilty of a breach of duty to the company . . . and as a result . . . obtain some benefit.\u201d <em>Schultz, supra </em>at 71, quoting from <em>Prudential Assur. Co. </em>v. <em>Newman Indus. Ltd. (No. 2), </em>[1981] 1 Ch. 257, 316 (Eng.). It is essential that the plaintiff show that the party who committed fraud in this sense benefit from his conduct. <em>Schultz, supra </em>at 72, 78-79.</p>\n<p id=\"b134-5\">The defendants do not challenge the motion judge\u2019s determination that the complaint sufficiently alleges benefit to Novielli, Leighton, and Smith. Nor do the defendants dispute that DCM had control over Dutchess Ltd. Instead, the defendants contend that the complaint does not sufficiently allege that DCM obtained a benefit, or that Novielli, Smith, and Leighton had control over Dutchess Ltd. \u201c[W]e examine the same pleadings as the motion judge and therefore proceed de novo. Those pleadings include . . . documents that are referenced in the complaint[] and that were provided to the motion judge. We accept as true the allegations in the complaint[] and draw every reasonable inference in favor of the plaintiffs. We consider whether the factual allegations in the complaint are sufficient, as a matter of law, to state a recognized cause of action or claim, and whether such allegations plausibly suggest an entitlement to relief.\u201d <em>Boston Med. Center Corp. </em>v. <em>Secretary of the Executive Office of Health &amp; Human Servs., </em>463 Mass. 447, 450 (2012) (citations and quotation marks omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b134-6\">Taken as a whole, the complaint sets out a hedge fund master-feeder system controlled, managed, and directed by the three individual defendants using various corporate entities. For example, Smith has held various high-level offices within DCM (which owns the voting shares of Dutchess Ltd.), is the director of corporate finance for Dutchess L.P. (one of the feeder funds), and is the vice-president of business development for Dutchess Advisors. Novielli and Leighton are the only two members of the board of directors of Dutchess Ltd. (the sister feeder fund). They are also the sole directors of the master fund. In addition, Novielli and Leighton are the principals and comanaging members of DCM, which in turn owns the voting shares of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"95\">*95</page-number>Dutchess Ltd.<footnotemark>36</footnotemark> DCM directs the investment program of the master fund, and it is also the investment manager of Dutchess Ltd. It is a reasonable inference to draw from these allegations that Novielli and Leighton have control over Dutchess Ltd. sufficient to withstand a motion to dismiss.</p>\n<p id=\"AeV\">Although the question is closer, we are also of the view that the allegations concerning Smith\u2019s involvement, taken in their totality, are sufficient to show his de facto control over Dutchess Ltd., at least for pleading purposes. In addition to his roles within the various interrelated entities, Smith acted in concert with Novielli and Leighton on both sides of a transaction designed to artificially inflate the value of the master fund, increase the value of their personal holdings, and increase the amount of management and performance fees that would inure to their benefit \u2014 all to the harm of Dutchess Ltd. Smith was also able to appropriate portions of the investments of Dutchess Ltd. for himself (and others) by forcing target companies to retain a consulting firm\u2019s services, resulting in fees for himself and in disregard of the best interests of Dutchess Ltd.</p>\n<p id=\"AQM\">The complaint also alleges that DCM benefited at the expense of Dutchess Ltd. by structuring sham transactions designed to increase DCM\u2019s management fees and fees on profits. Because DCM received a two percent management fee per year on the investments in Dutchess Ltd., and a twenty percent fee on Dutchess Ltd. profits, it benefited by creating falsely inflated values for Dutchess Ltd.\u2019s assets and profits.</p>\n<p id=\"AxV\">Because both control and benefit are sufficiently alleged, the plaintiffs have established derivative standing to sue DCM, Novielli, Smith, and Leighton on behalf of Dutchess Ltd. under Cayman law.</p>\n<p id=\"Auf\">ii. <em>Sufficiency of the allegations against Sullivan Bille. </em>Sullivan Bille argues that the complaint fails to state a cause of action for which relief may be granted because (1) Sullivan Bille <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"96\">*96</page-number>had no duty to determine whether Dutchess L.P. was acting in accordance with its publicly represented investment strategies, goals, and policies; and (2) even accepting that Sullivan Bille breached such a duty, there was no cognizable harm. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b136-5\">(a) <em>Duty. </em>Sullivan Bille\u2019s argument that it had no duty to determine whether Dutchess L.P.\u2019s investments were made in accordance with the investment strategies and protocols identified in the \u201cPrivate Offering Memorandum\u201d is a red herring, and depends upon ignoring the well-pleaded allegations of the complaint. The complaint alleges that Sullivan Bille\u2019s \u201caudit reports were false and negligently prepared . . . because the financial statements did <em>not </em>conform with GAAP [Generally Accepted Accounting Principles], contained material misstatements and omissions, failed to portray the true financial condition, and the audits had not been conducted in accordance with GAAS [Generally Accepted Auditing Standards].\u201d The complaint identifies two ways in which Sullivan Bille violated GAAP: (1) the investment valuations of Siena and Challenger were materially overstated, and (2) the financial statements prepared by Sullivan Bille failed to disclose that management did not comply with investment objectives and policies. Sullivan Bille does not dispute that it was required to comply with GAAP and GAAS. It argues, however, that GAAP and GAAS do not impose the duty alleged by the plaintiffs. This is a question for another day. The requirements of GAAP and GAAS and measuring Sullivan Bille\u2019s performance against them are issues that cannot be determined within the confines of the complaint. Both depend upon factual development not suitable to a motion to dismiss.</p>\n<p id=\"b136-6\">(b) <em>Causation. </em>Sullivan Bille\u2019s argument regarding causation is similarly ill suited for disposition on a motion to dismiss. Sullivan Bille argues that any false or negligently prepared financial statement would have been based on information provided to it by an agent of Dutchess L.P. Therefore, relying in part on the theory of in pari delicto,<footnotemark>37</footnotemark> Sullivan Bille argues the Dutchess L.P. plaintiffs (who bring suit derivatively) could not have justifiably relied on Sullivan Bille\u2019s audits. And because <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"97\">*97</page-number>the Dutchess L.P. plaintiffs could not rely on Sullivan Bille\u2019s audits, Sullivan Bille contends that the audits could not possibly have caused them harm. This argument is made without citation to any relevant Massachusetts law.</p>\n<p id=\"b137-5\">Even assuming, arguendo, the legal viability of Sullivan Bille\u2019s theory, it fails at this stage because it requires factual development. Causation is a question of fact usually left to the jury. <em>Mullins </em>v. <em>Pine Manor College, </em>389 Mass. 47, 58 (1983). Ordinarily, \u201c[wjhen an agent acquires knowledge in the scope of [his] employment, the principal... is held to have constructive knowledge of that information.\u201d <em>Sunrise Properties, Inc. </em>v. <em>Bacon, Wilson, Ratner, Cohen, Salvage, Fialky &amp; Fitzgerald, P.C., </em>425 Mass. 63, 66 (1997), quoting from <em>DeVaux </em>v. <em>American Home Assur. Co., </em>387 Mass. 814, 818 (1983). \u201cHowever, an agent\u2019s knowledge of his own unauthorized acts is not imputed to the principal when the agent has acted fraudulently toward the principal and is engaged in an independent fraudulent act from which the principal does not benefit.\u201d <em>Sunrise Properties, Inc., supra </em>at 67. Here, the complaint plainly alleges fraud on the principal (Dutchess L.P.) by its agents (DCM, Novielli, Leighton, and Smith), who are alleged to have acted in their own self-interest to the harm of the principal. Accepting these allegations as true (as we must), we cannot say that knowledge of any misleading financial statements would necessarily be imputed to Dutchess L.P.</p>\n<p id=\"b137-6\">iii. <em>Personal jurisdiction over Dundee Leeds. </em>To determine if the plaintiffs have made a prima facie showing of personal jurisdiction over Dundee Leeds, we accept the factual allegations of the complaint as true. Dundee Leeds does not dispute any factual allegation, and submitted no affidavit showing its lack of contacts with Massachusetts. See <em>Cepeda </em>v. <em>Kass, </em>62 Mass. App. Ct. 732, 737-739 (2004). At this stage of the proceedings, the plaintiffs have a burden of production, not persuasion. <em>Id. </em>at 738. Although the plaintiffs eventually will need to prove personal jurisdiction \u201cby a preponderance of the evidence at an evidentiary hearing or at trial,\" at the pleading stage all that is required is a prima facie showing. <em>Ibid. </em>We deal here only with specific jurisdiction; no argument is made that general jurisdiction over Dundee Leeds is proper in Massachusetts.</p>\n<p id=\"b138-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"98\">*98</page-number>Personal jurisdiction must be both authorized by State law and meet the requirements of due process under the United States Constitution. <em>Caplan </em>v. <em>Donovan, </em>450 Mass. 463, 465, cert. denied, 553 U.S. 1018 (2008), citing <em>Good Hope Indus., Inc. </em>v. <em>Ryder Scott Co., </em>378 Mass. 1, 5-6 (1979). At issue first is whether Dundee Leeds\u2019s contacts with Massachusetts are sufficient to confer jurisdiction under the long-arm statute, G. L. c. 223A, \u00a7 3. The application of that statute \u201crequires that (even if the fact pattern of the case is <em>constitutionally </em>acceptable) the circumstances of the particular case come within one of the <em>specific subsections </em>of c. <em>223A, </em>\u00a7 3.\u201d <em>Burtner </em>v. <em>Burnham, </em>13 Mass. App. Ct. 158, 161-162 (1982). If the defendant\u2019s conduct falls within one of the subsections of G. L. c. <em>223A, </em>\u00a7 3, then jurisdiction will be exercised unless doing so would be inconsistent with the Constitution. <em>Good Hope Indus., Inc., supra.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b138-5\">(a) <em>The long-arm statute. </em>The chief dispute is whether Dundee Leeds\u2019s conduct constituted \u201ctransacting any business\u201d in the Commonwealth, thereby subjecting it to personal jurisdiction under G. L. c. 223A, \u00a7 <em>3(a), </em>inserted by St 1968, c. 760. \u201cThe term \u2018transacting business\u2019 is broadly construed,\u201d <em>Haddad </em>v. <em>Taylor, 32 </em>Mass. App. Ct. 332, 335 (1992), and \u201canything but the most incidental commercial contact\u201d is sufficient. <em>Foster-Miller, Inc. </em>v. <em>Babcock &amp; Wilcox Canada, </em>848 F. Supp. 271, 276 (D. Mass. 1994), reversed on other grounds, 46 F.3d 138 (1st Cir. 1995). \u201cThe question what activities constitute the transaction of business . . . must be decided on the particular facts involved.\u201d <em>Stanton </em>v. <em>AM Gen. Corp., </em>50 Mass. App. Ct. 116, 117 (2000), quoting from <em>Droukas </em>v. <em>Divers Training Academy, Inc., </em>375 Mass. 149, 156-157 (1978). The claim must arise from business that the defendant transacted in the Commonwealth. <em>Tatro </em>v. <em>Manor Care, Inc., </em>416 Mass. 763, 767 (1994).</p>\n<p id=\"b138-6\">The complaint alleges that Dundee Leeds was the administrator for the two feeder funds and had \u201cfull access\u201d to the funds\u2019 investment data. Among other things, Dundee Leeds oversaw, made, and distributed net asset value (NAV) calculations for the two feeder funds, both of which operated out of offices in Boston. Accepting these facts as true (as we must), it is difficult to see <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"99\">*99</page-number>one could not reasonably infer that Dundee Leeds had regular communication with the funds\u2019 offices in Massachusetts, and that it gathered information that originated from the funds\u2019 offices in Massachusetts in order to prepare the NAV calculations. We are not required to imagine that Dundee Leeds performed its duties without regular contact with its two clients, who were located in Massachusetts.<footnotemark>38</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b139-6\">(b) <em>Due process. </em>Due process requires contacts with Massachusetts through some \u201cpurposeful[] avail[ment] ... of the privilege of conducting activities\u201d here. <em>Tatro, supra </em>at 772, quoting from <em>Asahi Metal Indus. Co. </em>v. <em>Superior Ct., </em>480 U.S. 102, 108-109 (1987). Any assertion of jurisdiction \u201cmust not offend \u2018traditional notions of fair play and substantial justice.\u2019 \u201d <em>Tatro, supra </em>at 773, quoting from <em>International Shoe Co. </em>v. <em>Washington, 326 </em>U.S. 310, 316 (1945). The assertion of specific jurisdiction also requires that the plaintiffs\u2019 claim arise out Dundee Leeds\u2019s contacts with the forum. <em>Tatro, supra </em>at 772.</p>\n<p id=\"b139-10\">A liberal reading of the complaint permits the inference that Dundee Leeds purposefully availed itself of the benefits of conducting business in Massachusetts by agreeing to oversee feeder funds based in Massachusetts, harvesting data from them, having an ongoing relationship with them, and providing asset calculations for them. Dundee Leeds \u201creasonably could have foreseen that significant managerial decisions, based on the information it had provided, would be made in Massachusetts.\u201d <em>Good Hope Indus., Inc., </em>378 Mass, at 11-12. See <em>Bulldog Investors Gen. Partnership </em>v. <em>Secretary of the Commonwealth, </em>457 Mass. 210, 218 (2010) (defendant knew it was communicating with Massachusetts residents and derived commercial benefit from the interaction). We also see nothing to suggest that exercising jurisdiction would be unfair or unduly burdensome to Dundee Leeds. Finally, the claim against Dundee Leeds arises from its relationship with its two feeder fund clients in Massachusetts.</p>\n<p id=\"b139-12\">4. <em>Conclusion. </em>For the reasons set out above, we vacate so much of the judgment as dismisses count I (breach of fiduciary duty) as brought derivatively on behalf of Dutchess Ltd., count <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"100\">*100</page-number>IX (unjust enrichment) as against Dutchess Advisors, count X (professional malpractice) against Sullivan Bille, and count XI (professional malpractice) against Dundee Leeds.

Novielli, Leighton and Smith joined Challenger\u2019s board of directors in June, 2006, eventually becoming the board\u2019s only members. According to the complaint, each year the auditors issued a \u2018going concern\u2019 qualification, expressing the view that the company might not be able to survive the year. Regardless of Challenger\u2019s financial difficulties, and what the plaintiffs argue was a series of bad acquisitions on Challenger\u2019s part, the Dutchess defendants continued to prop Challenger up with multiple cash infusions and loans totaling nearly $20 million of the funds\u2019 assets, $9 million of which was contributed between January 2007 and January 2008. The plaintiffs assert that Novielli, Leighton and Smith received substantial stock and cash from their involvement with Challenger, while the funds recovered only about $900,000. The facts alleged with respect to Siena are very much the same. According to the plaintiffs, Novielli and Leighton served on Siena\u2019s board of directors, and the funds entered into a series of loans for transactions that proved disastrous. Although Siena posted net losses of $4.2 million in 2004 and $15.5 million in 2005, the Dutchess defendants entered into two loan restructuring agreements whereby Dutchess L.R forgave $7.6 million of debt in return for an unsecured promissory note in a lesser amount, allowed Siena to borrow without the funds\u2019 consent, and waived certain of the funds\u2019 claims regarding Siena\u2019s loans.

However, no such dismissal pursuant to subpart (i) above shall be effective where the complaint is subject to a motion to dismiss and the plaintiff has chosen to file an answering brief rather than seeking to amend. See Rule 15(aaa). Unless otherwise stated in the notice of dismissal or stipulation, the dismissal is without prejudice, except that a notice of dismissal operates as an adjudication upon the merits when filed by a plaintiff who has once dismissed in any court of the United States or of any state an action based on or including the same claim.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"16\">\n<p id=\"b122-8\">Court approval was necessary because many of the claims were asserted derivatively.

At the time that any party moves or otherwise applies to the Court for approval of a compromise of all or any part of a derivative action, each representative plaintiff in such action shall file with the Register in Chancery a further affidavit in the form required by subpart (b) of this rule.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"18\">\n<p id=\"Au\">The Delaware complaint named an additional accounting firm defendant, Marcum &amp; Kliegman LLP (Marcum), a New York limited liability partnership.

But even were we to assume that Dundee Leeds\u2019s cursory argument regarding the savings statute satisfies the requirements of Mass.R.A.P. 16(a)(4), as amended, 367 Mass. 921 (1975), the argument was waived by not having been raised below. <em>Carey </em>v. <em>New England Organ Bank, </em>446 Mass. 270, 285 (2006).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"21\">\n<p id=\"AL7\">Specifically, the plaintiffs acknowledged that (1) count I (as brought on behalf of Dutchess L.P.), count II, and count III are subject to Delaware\u2019s three-year statute of limitations, Del. Code Ann. tit. 10, \u00a7 8106 (1999 &amp; Supp. 2012); and (2) count V, count VI, count VII[1], count VH[2], count IX, and count X are subject to Massachusetts\u2019s three-year statute of limitations for tort claims, G. L. c. 260, \u00a7 2A.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"22\">\n<p id=\"Ayz\">The only claims the plaintiffs did not concede were subject to a three-year limitations period are count I (breach of fiduciary duty) as asserted derivatively on behalf of Dutchess Ltd. and count XI (professional malpractice) against Dundee Leeds. And, at least for purposes of the motion to dismiss, the defendants appear to have acknowledged that those two claims are subject to a six-year limitations period under Cayman Islands law. See Cayman Is. Limitation Law (1996 Revision), \u00a7 4(1).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"23\">\n<p id=\"b126-6\">The defendants argue in cursory fashion that the claims subject to the Delaware statute of limitations (namely, count I [as brought by Dutchess L.P.], count II, and count IH) are subject only to the Delaware savings statute, Del. Code Ann. tit. 10, \u00a7 8118 (1999). If so, those claims would be untimely because Delaware\u2019s savings statute does not apply to voluntary dismissals. See <em>Graleski </em>v. <em>ILC Dover, </em>26 A.3d 213 (Del. 2011) (table). We need not reach the defendants\u2019 argument because the Massachusetts savings statute would not apply to those claims in any event.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"24\">\n<p id=\"b126-7\">For example, North Carolina and Georgia both expressly include voluntary dismissals in the protection of their savings statutes, Ga. Code Ann. \u00a7 9-2-61 (2007) (saving applies where \u201cplaintiff discontinues or dismisses\u201d case); N.C. Gen. Stat. \u00a7 1A-1, Rule 41(a)(1) (2011), whereas Pennsylvania and Montana explicitly exclude them, Mont. Code Ann. \u00a7 27-2-407 (2011) (excluding \u201cvoluntary discontinuance\u201d); 42 Pa. Cons. Stat.

However, as noted in <em>Duff v. Zonis, </em>327 Mass. 347, 352 (1951), \u201c[cjases in other jurisdictions are in conflict, many of them depending upon statutes and theories . . . which are less liberal than those prevailing in this Commonwealth.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"25\">\n<p id=\"b126-9\">Court action alone does not seem dispositive to us in any event. Otherwise, the fact that court approval was required to dismiss the Delaware action would alone suffice to defeat the defendants\u2019 argument.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"26\">\n<p id=\"b128-8\">We emphasize that nothing in our opinion should be taken to endorse the strategic initiation or dismissal of litigation for the purpose of taking advantage of the extension provided by the savings statute. There must be \u201cno indication in the record that the plaintiff attempted for dilatory purposes to prolong the limitations period by reliance on the statute.\u201d <em>Boutiette </em>v. <em>Dickinson, </em>54 Mass. App. Ct. at 819.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"27\">\n<p id=\"b128-14\">\u201c[A] touchstone for what constitutes dismissal for reasons of matter of form is whether, within the original statute of limitations period, the defendant had actual notice that a court action had been initiated\u201d (footnote omitted). <em>Liberace </em>v. <em>Conway, </em>31 Mass. App. Ct. 40, 44 (1991). There is no dispute that the defendants had notice of the Delaware action.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"28\">\n<p id=\"b128-19\">That said, plaintiffs wishing to avoid future litigation over whether their <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"89\">*89</page-number>voluntarily dismissed claims are entitled to the savings statute should either obtain an agreement with their opposing party to that effect, specify the reason for dismissal in their motion or notice of dismissal, or obtain an order from the court specifying the reason for dismissal.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"29\">\n<p id=\"b130-7\">The hearing regarded the motions to dismiss for lack of personal jurisdiction.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"30\">\n<p id=\"b131-7\">For an extensive list of matters on which a court may take judicial notice, see the tables in Young, Pellets, &amp; Poreda, Annotated Guide to Massachusetts Evidence \u00a7 201, at 43-54 (2012-2013 ed.).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"31\">\n<p id=\"b131-8\">Because the defendants do not raise it, we pass on whether these documents, which were not submitted by affidavit, were properly before the motion judge.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"32\">\n<p id=\"b132-31\">For clarity, we specify that the following counts of the complaint were correctly dismissed on statute of limitations grounds: so much of count I as was brought derivatively on behalf of Dutchess L.P.; count II; count III; count V; count VI; count VII[1]; count VII[2]; and count IX as against DCM, Novielli, Smith, and Leighton.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"33\">\n<p id=\"b132-36\">See note 22, <em>supra. </em>For purposes of this appeal, the claim against Dundee Leeds has been accepted to be subject to the Cayman Islands six-year limitations period. We include Dundee Leeds in the list of parties here only because it moved to dismiss for lack of personal jurisdiction in the Delaware action. Therefore, if it develops in the litigation on remand that the claim against Dundee Leeds, after a choice-of-law analysis, is instead subject to the Massachusetts three-year limitations period, the claim would nonetheless be eligible for the savings statute.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"34\">\n<p id=\"b133-8\">Of the remaining claims, only one (the unjust enrichment claim against Dutchess Advisors, count IX) is not challenged on some additional ground.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"35\">\n<p id=\"b133-9\">Cayman law is the common law of Britain and other Commonwealth countries, supplemented by Cayman Islands court decisions and statutes.
