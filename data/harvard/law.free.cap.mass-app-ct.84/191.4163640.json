The plaintiffs, Joseph and Susan Sano, owners of a unit without an adjacent balcony, commenced this action seeking a judgment declaring that the individual owners whose units are adjacent to each balcony are responsible for its repairs. The defendant trustees, each of whom owns a unit with an adjoining balcony, contend the repairs to the balconies are to a \u201ccommon area\u201d and the cost of repairs should be paid from the common fee assessments. On cross motions for summary judgment, a Superior Court judge ruled that the balconies and the beams supporting them are part of the units they serve and are not common areas. We affirm in part and reverse in part.</p>\n<p id=\"b232-8\"><em>Background. </em>The essential facts are not in dispute. Portland, comprising a single residential building on land located in Lynn, was organized in 1980 as a condominium, pursuant to G. L. c. 183A, inserted by St. 1963, c. 493. Putting aside the basement containing a single unit, each of the three main floors of the building has an identical rectangular layout with eight units per floor. The units on each floor are adjacent to a single central interior hallway, four on each side of the hallway. On the exterior of each floor, two balcony structures are affixed, one on each side of the building that is parallel to the central hallway. Although the record does not contain their dimensions, the floor plans recorded with the condominium master deed show that the center of each balcony is adjacent to the interior wall that separates two middle units, and the balcony then runs alongside each of the two middle units an equivalent distance. Each of the balconies is accessible only by sliding doors opening from each of the two middle units adjacent to them. The four comer units on each floor have no balcony adjacent to them.</p>\n<p id=\"b232-9\">Generally, four twelve-foot-long beams provide structural support to each balcony, and four of the twelve feet are located <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"193\">*193</page-number>on the outside of the condominium building while eight feet are located inside the building, running between the floor joists that are below the units adjacent to the balcony and above the ceilings of the units below the balcony. Currently, some of the support beams must be replaced because they are decaying and are positioned to direct water into the building. Replacement of the beams necessitates opening the ceilings of the units below the units adjacent to the balconies.</p>\n<p id=\"b233-5\">The master deed, under a heading entitled \u201cDescription of Units,\u201d provides, \u201cExhibit \u2018A\u2019 attached hereto and made a part hereof, contains a unit designation of each unit in the Condominium, its location, approximate area, and number of rooms. All units have immediate access to hallways adjacent thereto.\u201d<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Exhibit A is organized in chart form. Footnote three of exhibit A provides, \u201cEach unit has five rooms which include: [kjitchen, [djining, [ljiving, one bedroom and one bathroom. In addition, [the middle units] have a balcony.\u201d The parties agree that the square footage figures shown on exhibit A for those units that have a balcony include the square footage of the balcony. Indeed, the floor plans recorded with the master deed indicate that the square footage of the units adjacent to a balcony includes the balcony.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b233-6\">After incorporating by reference exhibit A, the \u201cDescription of Units\u201d in the master deed further provides that \u201c[t]he boundaries of each of the units with respect to the floors, ceilings, walls, windows, and doors thereof are as follows: (a) Floors: the plane of the upper surface of the floor joists, (b) Ceilings: the plane of the lower surface of ceiling joists, (c) Walls: the plane of the interior surface of the wall studs of plaster walls, as the case may be. (d) Doors: the plane of the exterior surface of the door, (e) Windows: the interior frame of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"194\">*194</page-number>the windows and the exterior surface of the glass.\u201d This description fails to mention the balconies.</p>\n<p id=\"b234-5\">The final sentence of the master deed\u2019s \u201cDescription of Units\u201d states, \u201cExhibit B attached hereto and made a part hereof gives the percentage interest of each unit in the Common Areas and Facilities of the Condominium.\u201d Pursuant to G. L. c. 183A, \u00a7 5, such percentage must be in the approximate relation that the fair value of the individual unit bears to the aggregate fair value of all the units. Exhibit B shows the units adjacent to the balconies as having a higher percentage interest in the common areas than units on the same floor without a balcony. The parties stipulated that all units that have access to a balcony pay a higher condominium fee than units that do not have access to a balcony.</p>\n<p id=\"b234-6\">The next section of the master deed provides a definition of \u201cCommon Areas and Facilities,\u201d including \u201c(a) [t]he land described in . . . this Master Deed\u201d; \u201c(b) [a]ll foundations, structural columns, girders, beams, supports, exterior walls, roofs, party walls and common walls between the units and not included as part of the units\u201d; \u201c(c) [a]ll conduits, plumbing, wiring, flues and other facilities which are contained within any unit but serve part of the condominium other than the unit within [which] such facilities are contained\u201d; and \u201c(d) [a]ll other items listed as such in [G. L. c.] 183A and located on the property.\u201d No mention of the balconies is included, nor are they specifically included in the definition of \u201cCommon areas and facilities\u201d (common areas) contained in G. L. c. 183A, \u00a7 1, as amended through St. 1998, c. 242, \u00a7 3. To the contrary, \u00a7 1 defines \u201cUnit\u201d to include appurtenant balconies if stipulated in the master deed as being owned by the unit owner.</p>\n<p id=\"b234-7\"><em>Discussion. </em>\u201cThe condominium statute is \u2018essentially an enabling statute, setting out a framework for the development of condominiums in the Commonwealth, while providing developers and unit owners with planning flexibility.\u2019 \u201d <em>Scully </em>v. <em>Tillery, </em>456 Mass. 758, 770 (2010), quoting from <em>Queler </em>v. <em>Skowron, </em>438 Mass. 304, 312 (2002). While the governing statute supplies a default definition of common areas, it allows condominium developers and unit owners to deviate from that definition in the master deed and thereby set the rules with regard to what <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"195\">*195</page-number>constitutes common areas and what is included as part of an individual unit. G. L. c. 183A, \u00a7 1. <em>Flynn </em>v. <em>Parker, </em>80 Mass. App. Ct. 283, 288-289 (2011). Consequently, the developers of the Portland building were not restricted by statute as to how they could treat the balconies. They were free to include them as part of the adjacent units or to treat them as common areas, notwithstanding the exclusive access by adjacent unit owners. See, e.g., <em>Belson </em>v. <em>Thayer &amp; Assocs., Inc., </em>32 Mass. App. Ct. 256, 257-258, 260 (1992) (master deed described patio-deck as limited common area to which adjacent unit owner had exclusive right of use, but by-law put onus on that owner for repairs and maintenance of patio-deck; conversely, by-law provided that repairs to building\u2019s balconies were common expenses, \u201cdespite the fact that each balcony is reserved for the exclusive use\u201d of each adjacent unit).</p>\n<p id=\"b235-5\">We must, therefore, examine the master deed to determine its intent \u201cwith regard to the division between individual and common property.\u201d <em>Flynn </em>v. <em>Parker, supra </em>at 289. \u201cIn addressing that question, \u2018[t]he intent of the parties is gleaned from \u201cthe words used, interpreted in the light of the material circumstances and pertinent facts known to them at the time [the deed] was executed.\u201d \u2019 \u201d <em>Ibid., </em>quoting from <em>Commercial Wharf E. Condominium Assn. </em>v. <em>Waterfront Parking Corp., </em>407 Mass. 123, 131 (1990).</p>\n<p id=\"b235-6\">Without doubt, the master deed is no model of clarity in terms of treatment of the balconies affixed to the building and on whom the responsibility for repair lies. It appears that the balconies were largely ignored in drafting the condominium documents. Even the condominium by-laws, recorded with the master deed, and the regulations adopted some time later which put some controls on the use of common areas and individual units, including limitations on what may be hung from exterior unit walls, doors, and windows, fail to mention the balconies or attempt to control their use in any way.</p>\n<p id=\"b235-7\">Nonetheless, we think what is in the master deed warrants the conclusion that the balconies are included as part of the adjacent units. We first note that the condominium statute\u2019s definition of unit is not modified in the master deed. The statute defines \u201cUnit\u201d as \u201ca part of the condominium including one or more <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"196\">*196</page-number>rooms, <em>with appurtenant areas such as balconies, terraces and storage lockers if any are stipulated in the master deed as being owned by the unit owner, </em>occupying one or more floors or a part or parts thereof, including the enclosed space therein, intended for any type of use, and with a direct exit to a street or way or to a common area leading to a street or way\u201d (emphasis supplied). G. L. c. 183A, \u00a7 1. We examine the master deed, therefore, to determine whether it \u201cstipulate^]\u201d that the balconies are owned by the appurtenant unit owners.</p>\n<p id=\"b236-5\">Exhibit A is incorporated by reference into the master deed and contains the designation of each unit in the condominium, as well as its location, square footage, and number of rooms. When describing the number of rooms, exhibit A uses the same language to indicate each unit \u201chas\u201d a kitchen, dining room, living room, bedroom, and bathroom, as it does to indicate that the middle units, \u201c[i]n addition,\u201d \u201chave\u201d a balcony. There is no indication that the ownership interest in the balcony is any different than the ownership interest in the kitchen or any other room in the unit. Moreover, the floor plans recorded with the master deed indicate that the square footage of the units with an adjacent balcony includes the balcony. We agree with the judge, therefore, that exhibit A describes the balconies as being part of their adjacent units.</p>\n<p id=\"b236-6\">The absence of the balconies from the boundary description of the units contained in the master deed, while curious, does not negate their inclusion in the square footage of the adjacent units and their inclusion in the unit descriptions in exhibit A. Other than oversight, we cannot explain why the drafters would choose to define the boundaries with respect to the floors, ceilings, walls, doors, and windows, but not the beginning or end of the balconies. We note, however, that c. 183 does not require a master deed to contain a boundary description of the units; as relevant here, it requires only unit designations, the numbers of rooms, approximate areas, and floor plans showing, among other things, the layout, location, unit numbers, and dimensions of the units. G. L. c. 183A, \u00a7 8. Nothing more was required in this regard to be included in the first unit deed to each unit pursuant to G. L. c. 183A, \u00a7 9, as in effect when Portland was organized as a condominium. The required information provided <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"197\">*197</page-number>here by the master deed indicates the balconies are part of the adjacent units. As the only express treatment of the balconies in the condominium documents includes them as the equivalent of rooms in the adjacent units and includes them in the square footage of the adjacent units, we conclude the judge properly ruled as a matter of law that they are part of the adjacent units<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> and that repairs to the balconies are therefore the responsibility of the owners of the units adjacent to them.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b237-5\">We reach a different result, however, as to the balcony support beams. The Sanos conceded in their summary judgment papers that the eight-foot portions of the twelve-foot support beams that run inside the building are common areas, but contended that the remaining four-foot portions are part of the adjacent units. While he acknowledged the Sanos\u2019 concession as to part of the support beams, the judge nonetheless ruled that because the beams support only the balconies, no part of them constitutes a common area.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> We disagree. Even assuming it is an undisputed fact that the beams lend no structural support to any part of the building beyond the balconies themselves, under the language of the master deed that fact has no bearing on the beams\u2019 classification.</p>\n<p id=\"b237-6\">The master deed specifically includes building components such as \u201cstructural columns\u201d and \u201cbeams\u201d in part (b) of the definition of \u201cCommon Areas and Facilities.\u201d While it could have done so, the definition does not distinguish between beams that support a common area and beams that support a portion of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"198\">*198</page-number>a unit. The judge reasoned that the concluding phrase of part (b) \u2014 \u201cand not included as part of the units\u201d \u2014 modifies the entire sentence rather than just \u201cparty walls and common walls.\u201d However, it is the \u201cgeneral rule of statutory as well as grammatical construction that a modifying clause is confined to the last antecedent unless there is something in the subject matter or dominant purpose which requires a different interpretation.\u201d <em>Bednark </em>v. <em>Catania Hospitality Group, Inc., </em>78 Mass. App. Ct. 806, 812 (2011), quoting from <em>Druzik </em>v. <em>Board of Health of Haverhill, </em>324 Mass. 129, 133 (1949). The rule\u2019s \u201ccommon and most powerful use occurs where a list of multiple, distinct antecedents precedes the modifying clause.\u201d <em>Ibid. </em>Here, where the list of items is separated by commas, the qualifier applies only to the immediate antecedent within the same phrase that was not separated by a comma. <em>Herrick </em>v. <em>Essex Regional Retirement Bd., </em>77 Mass. App. Ct. 645, 650 (2010). Thus, \u201cbeams,\u201d \u201csupports,\u201d and the like are not modified by the phrase \u201cand not included as part of the units.\u201d Where the definition of common areas includes beams generally, and fails to distinguish those beams that support a common area from those that support a portion of an individual unit, the balcony beams are properly considered a common area.</p>\n<p id=\"b238-5\">Our conclusion is buttressed by the fact that the beams are largely located within areas defined to be common areas: the exterior of the building and the area between the floor joists of the adjacent units and above the ceilings of the units below. Article XI of the condominium by-laws provides that \u201c[a]ll maintenance, repairs and replacements to the Common Areas and Facilities, whether located inside or outside of the units, . . . shall be made by the Trustees and be charged to all the Unit Owners as a common expense.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b238-7\"><em>Conclusion. </em>We affirm so much of the judgment as declares the balconies to be part of their adjacent units and not common areas. So much of the judgment as declares the beams supporting the balconies to be part of the individual units adjacent to each balcony shall be modified to declare such beams to be common areas.</p>\n<p id=\"b238-8\">\n<em>So ordered.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b233-7\">The four units on each floor that have no adjacent balcony each have two doors to the hallway. The units that have balconies adjacent to them each have only one means of access to the hallway.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b233-8\">The floor plans label each balcony structure as \u201cBalconies,\u201d and appear to have a line in the center of each, perhaps to indicate that the balconies are artificially divided in the middle. Footnote 3 of exhibit A refers to each unit having a singular \u201cbalcony,\u201d notwithstanding the label \u201cBalconies\u201d on the plans. Whether all or half of the square footage of the \u201cBalconies\u201d is included in the square footage of an adjacent unit is unclear, but irrelevant to our resolution of the appeal, and no party has asked us to resolve the issue.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b237-7\">Deciding as we do that the balconies are part of the adjacent units, the provisions of G. L. c. 183A dealing with \u201climited common areas and facilities\u201d do not bear on the matter. See <em>Podell </em>v. <em>Lahn, </em>38 Mass. App. Ct. 688, 693-694 (1995). We observe that the master deed\u2019s \u201cCommon Areas and Facilities\u201d section concludes with the following: \u201cAll of the units will have the benefit of the right to use the common areas and other facilities in common with others entitled thereto EXCEPT that each unit shall have as appurtenant to it the exclusive right to use one parking space and one storage bin as designated in the first unit deed to such unit.\u201d There is no comparable language, either in the common areas section or elsewhere in the master deed, assigning rights to the use of the balconies.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b237-13\">Article XI of the condominium by-laws provides that \u201c[a]ll maintenance of and repair to any [ujnit. . . shall be made by the owner of such [ujnit.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b237-14\">The trustees do not argue that the judge exceeded his authority by disagreeing with both parties below as to the eight-foot portion of the beams, or that the Sanos should be held to their concession.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-5\" type=\"concurring-in-part-and-dissenting-in-part\">\n<author id=\"b239-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"199\">*199</page-number>Trainor, J.</author>\n<p id=\"AJj\">(concurring in part and dissenting in part). I agree with the majority that the motion judge was correct in concluding that the balconies are a part of their adjacent units and not a common area. I would also observe, as did the judge, that the master deed specifically includes \u201cbalconies as part of the description of units through Exhibit A.\u201d Exhibit A is incorporated into the master deed. The units are described in exhibit A by unit number, location by building floor, square footage <em>(including </em>the balcony, where applicable), and the number of rooms, including the balcony for those units with an adjacent balcony.</p>\n<p id=\"b239-5\">The idea of an individual balcony which is exclusively part of the unit adjacent to it is a fiction created by the master deed, simply by drawing a line in the middle of the structure dividing it into two equal parts. Each balcony, in reality, is one structure shared by two units. I accept this fiction (and the majority acknowledges it), as we should in deference to the master deed. This fiction, however, implicates the relationship of the support beams to the balconies, as they are defined in the master deed. These support beams are part of the balconies themselves, each serving no other structural purpose but to support its balcony, and are therefore not \u201ccommon.\u201d The judge concluded that such beams are the exclusive responsibility of the adjacent unit owners. I believe the motion judge was correct and therefore respectfully dissent from that part of the majority opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b239-6\">While the majority\u2019s grammatical analysis of the master deed is interesting and even correct, it has little relevance to the question we are considering. Generally, common areas include the land described in the master deed and all other items listed as such in G. L. c. 183A and located on the property. Generally also, common areas will include all the structural elements of a building containing more than one unit.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b239-7\">The master deed here provides a traditional definition of common areas that includes the building\u2019s structural components <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"200\">*200</page-number>and facilities that serve more than one unit.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> \u201cStructural\u201d is defined in Webster\u2019s Third New International Dictionary 2266 (1993) as \u201cof or relating to the load-bearing members or scheme of a building as opposed to the screening or ornamental elements . . . [e.g.,] floor joists, rafters, wall and partition studs, supporting columns . . . foundations.\u201d This is why the individual unit boundaries are defined as the plane of the upper surface of the floor joists, for floors; the plane of the lower surface of the ceiling joists,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> for ceilings; and the plane of the interior surface of the wall studs, for walls. The wall studs and floor/ceiling joists are all interconnected weight-bearing structural components. The individual unit side of the boundaries is demarcated by the ornamental covering attached to the wall studs and floor/ceiling joists. This is why, for example, it was not necessary for the drafters of the master deed to define the boundaries of the balconies. Each balcony is entirely part of the individual unit, and it is neither within nor does it encapsulate any structural element. The balcony is entirely a part of the individual unit.</p>\n<p id=\"b240-5\">The judge was correct in not accepting the Sanos\u2019 concession that eight feet of the twelve-foot balcony support beams are common. Contrary to the majority conclusion, the balcony support beams are <em>not </em>a structural component of the building. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"201\">*201</page-number>Structural components support not only individual units, but also <em>simultaneously </em>support the entire building. This is the nature of modem construction technique.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> The balcony support beams are not a structural component of the building, as they support only the balcony itself and have nothing to do with the structural integrity of the building.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Removal of the balcony support beams would have no effect on the structural integrity of the building, whereas removal of wall studs or ceiling/floor joists would adversely affect the structural integrity of the building.</p>\n<p id=\"b241-5\">The majority makes much of the fact that because a portion of each support beam is located within the common area between the floor and ceiling, the beam itself is common. This analysis elevates form, or location, over substance. The master deed itself anticipates and makes provision for this situation. Clause (c) of the definition of \u201c[cjommon areas and facilities\u201d includes \u201c[a]ll conduits, plumbing, wiring, flues and other facilities which are contained within any unit <em>but serve part of the condominium other than the unit within [which] such facilities are </em>contained\u201d (emphasis added). This definition directly correlates with clause (b) in defining building structural components. Most plumbing, wiring, and conduits serve multiple units and are interconnected to the entire building. These components are common because they serve the entire building, or at a minimum more than one unit. They are <em>not </em>common because of their location, and they are <em>not </em>common if they serve only one unit regardless of where they are located.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> This is precisely why the fiction of individual balconies must be extended and applied to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"202\">*202</page-number>the beams which support them. To do otherwise would be illogical and inconsistent with the previous analysis.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b242-5\">Just as any \u201cfacility\u201d that serves only one unit is not a common area, the balcony support beams benefit only the unit whose balcony they support.
