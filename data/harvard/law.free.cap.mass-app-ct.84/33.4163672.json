Both names share the same Sex Offender Registry Board number.</p>\n</footnote>\n<opinion data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b74-5\">Vuono, J.</author>\n<p id=\"AfQ\">In 1991, the defendant was convicted by a jury of aggravated rape and related offenses in Superior Court. Upon his release from prison he was classified as a level three sex offender and became subject to the registration requirements of G. L. c. 6, \u00a7 178FV2. On April 21, 2011, following a jury-waived trial, the defendant was found guilty of failing to register as required, in violation of G. L. c. 6, \u00a7 178H(a).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> In a separate proceeding before the same judge, the defendant was convicted of being a second offender, in violation of G. L. c. 6, \u00a7 178H(fl)(2).<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Thereafter, in a proceeding before the same judge the defendant admitted to a violation of probation in connection with another conviction, the hearing on which had been pending.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b74-6\">The Commonwealth\u2019s theory of guilt was that the defendant knowingly provided a false address when he registered at the Springfield police department on March 31, 2010, and that, even if the defendant had been residing at the address he provided on that date, he subsequently changed his address and knowingly failed to provide notice to the police of that change.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b75-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"35\">*35</page-number>At trial, the defendant admitted that he had notice of his status and his obligations under the statute, including the requirement of reporting a change in his address. He claimed, however, that he was in compliance with the statute because the Hampden County district attorney\u2019s office had placed him in protective custody out of State during the time period specified in the indictment. The defendant filed motions for a required finding of not guilty at the close of the Commonwealth\u2019s case and at the close of all the evidence, which were denied. In the motion filed at the close of all the evidence, the defendant argued, in essence, that because the Commonwealth did not rebut his testimony about being placed in protective custody, the evidence was insufficient to prove that he knowingly violated the statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b75-5\">On appeal, the defendant claims that his motions for a required finding of not guilty should have been allowed.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> He also contends that the judge erred by (1) admitting in evidence documents maintained by the Sex Offender Registration Board (SORB) and the Superior Court probation department, and (2) failing to inquire into the reasons why the defendant wished to be represented by different counsel at the second offender trial. For the reasons that follow, we affirm the conviction.</p>\n<p id=\"b75-6\"><em>Background. </em>The evidence permitted the judge to find the following facts. While the defendant was in prison he signed an acknowledgment of his duty to register on three separate occasions.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> Each time the defendant signed an acknowledgment form, Judit Morales, the SORB liaison at the Hampden County sheriff\u2019s department, explained the statute\u2019s requirements to him. Additionally, prior to March of 2010, during periods when the defendant was not incarcerated, he registered as a sex offender with the Holyoke and West Springfield police depart<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"36\">*36</page-number>ments, and on one occasion he notified the SORB of his change of address.</p>\n<p id=\"b76-5\">By January 1, 2010, the defendant was living in Springfield. On February 12, 2010, he was placed on probation. He was supervised by probation officer Andrea Cadieux. At that time, the defendant reported that he was living at 700 State Street in apartment 315, in Springfield. The defendant later informed the probation department that he resided in apartment 215, and on a third occasion, in apartment 312. After the defendant missed a scheduled appointment with Cadieux on March 9, 2010, Cadieux attempted to contact the defendant using the addresses he had provided, but she was unsuccessful. Cadieux continued her efforts to contact the defendant during the month of April to no avail.</p>\n<p id=\"b76-6\">Meanwhile, on March 31, 2010, the defendant met with Detective Tracy Duda at the Springfield police department, where he completed a sex offender registration form.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> Detective Duda reviewed the statute\u2019s requirements as they appear on the form and read them aloud to the defendant.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> The completed registration form stated that the defendant was living at 619 State Street in apartment 3L in Springfield, but, as the defendant conceded at trial, he never lived at 619 State Street.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> According to the defendant, the number \u201c619\u201d was written in error and he actually was living at \u201c691\u201d State Street in the home of Shatina Boyd. The discrepancy in the numbers is immaterial because the evidence showed that the defendant did not live at either address on March 31, 2010. Boyd testified that the defendant <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"37\">*37</page-number>and his girlfriend, who was a close friend of Boyd\u2019s, moved into her apartment at 691 State Street near Christmas in 2009, and stayed two or three months before leaving \u201caround March.\u201d<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> Boyd further testified that near the end of the defendant\u2019s stay, he was not living with her all the time. Rather, he was going \u201cback and forth.\u201d During the month of April, the defendant did not reside with Boyd, who was evicted on April 8. The defendant did not provide notice of a change of address.</p>\n<p id=\"b77-5\">The defendant testified in his own defense. He stated that he had been shot on New Year\u2019s Day and again in early April, 2010, after which he became a material witness for the Hampden County district attorney\u2019s office. That office, the defendant asserted, moved him to a motel in Connecticut at \u201cthe end of March\u201d where he remained for \u201ca month or a month and a half.\u201d The defendant also stated that he testified before a Hampden County grand jury, but he did not specify when that occurred. According to the defendant, he was returned to Springfield at some point in April and remained homeless until he was arrested on April 30, 2010. The defendant identified his signature on the various registration and acknowledgment forms that had been introduced in evidence and admitted that he was aware of his obligations under the statute even though he could not read the forms himself.</p>\n<p id=\"b77-6\">1. <em>Sufficiency of the evidence. </em>As noted, the defendant claims there was insufficient evidence to support his conviction. Our review of the evidence, viewed in the light most favorable to the Commonwealth, see <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Latimore, </em>378 Mass. 671, 676-678 (1979), reveals a sufficient basis from which a rational finder of fact could have reasonably inferred that the defendant knowingly violated the statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b77-7\">At the outset, we observe that the judge was not required to believe the defendant\u2019s claim that he was placed in protective custody.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> Determinations of witness credibility lie exclusively within the province of the trier of fact. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Ianello, </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"38\">*38</page-number>401 Mass. 197, 202 (1987). The judge, as trier of fact, was entitled to reject part or all of the defendant\u2019s testimony. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Zanetti, </em>454 Mass. 449, 457 (2009). In this case, it is evident that the judge disbelieved the defendant. It is not surprising that he did so. The defendant\u2019s testimony was inconsistent on a number of key points. For example, he claimed that he was living at 691 State Street on March 31, 2010, but also testified that the district attorney\u2019s office had moved him to Connecticut at the end of March. At one point the defendant testified that he was in protective custody during the month of April, but he later stated that he was put in the motel in Connecticut right after he was placed on probation, which would have been in mid-February. The defendant further testified that he was arrested at the end of March, 2010, because he \u201cneeded to register\u201d and was brought to the Springfield police department by State troopers, one of whom he identified by name. This assertion contradicts the defendant\u2019s own chronology of events. Given the nature of the defendant\u2019s testimony coupled with the absence of any corroborating evidence, it was not unreasonable for the judge to have rejected the defendant\u2019s version of events.</p>\n<p id=\"b78-5\">We further observe that the Commonwealth was not required to present evidence to dispute the defendant\u2019s claim.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> The state of the evidence at the close of all the evidence is reviewed only \u201cto determine whether the Commonwealth\u2019s position as to proof deteriorated after it closed its case.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Morgan, </em>449 Mass. 343, 349 (2007), quoting from <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Sheline, </em>391 Mass. 279, 283 (1984). See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Dubois, </em>451 Mass. 20, 28 (2008), quoting from <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>O\u2019Laughlin, </em>446 Mass. 188, 203 (2006) (\u201cDeterioration only occurs where the Commonwealth\u2019s evidence of necessary elements \u2018is later shown to be incredible or conclusively incorrect\u2019 \u201d). \u201cWhere, as here, the evidence at trial <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"39\">*39</page-number>\u2018turns solely on the credibility of [the defendant\u2019s] witnesses,\u2019 the Commonwealth\u2019s case cannot deteriorate.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Gomez, </em>450 Mass. 704, 710-711 (2008), quoting from <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Platt, </em>440 Mass. 396, 404 (2003).</p>\n<p id=\"b79-5\">In any event, even if the defendant had been placed in protective custody at some point, there was ample evidence to support the conviction on the theory that the defendant was not living at 691 State Street on March 31, 2010. Indeed, Boyd\u2019s testimony alone suffices to establish beyond a reasonable doubt that the defendant knowingly provided a false address to Detective Duda on March 31, 2010.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b79-6\">There also was sufficient evidence to support the conviction on the ground that the defendant had changed his address without notifying the authorities. Even assuming that the defendant was returned to \u201cthe streets\u201d of Springfield at the behest of the district attorney, this fact did not relieve him of his obligation to report that he was now homeless and was no longer living at 691 State Street. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Scipione, </em>69 Mass. App. Ct. 906, 907 (2007).</p>\n<p id=\"b79-7\">2. <em>Admission of SORB and probation records. </em>The defendant\u2019s argument that the admission in evidence of records maintained by SORB and the probation department violated his right under the Sixth Amendment to the United States Constitution to confront witnesses is meritless. The SORB documents at issue consisted of verification forms and letters sent by SORB to the defendant at various addresses. The probation records consisted of an intake form and a letter sent to the defendant by Cadieux. In both instances, the person who created the documents at issue testified at trial and was subject to cross-examination. Thus, the defendant\u2019s right of confrontation was not implicated. Moreover, as we recently held in <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Fox, </em>81 Mass. App. Ct. 244, 245 (2012), even in the absence of a witness who created the records, the admission in evidence <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"40\">*40</page-number>of business records kept by SORB did not violate the defendant\u2019s constitutional rights where the records were kept in the ordinary course of SORB\u2019s affairs, were prepared and maintained by the public officials as required by the statute, and were not for the purpose of establishing an essential fact at trial. The records at issue undeniably satisfied these conditions.</p>\n<p id=\"b80-5\">We also reject the defendant\u2019s contention that the SORB records were inadmissible because they included references or were addressed to aliases (\u201cTony Johnson\u201d and \u201cAnthony Ramon\u201d) used by the defendant. The defendant did not object to the admission of the records on this basis, and even if he had objected, we discern no prejudice in view of the fact that the defendant acknowledged at trial that he had used those very same aliases.</p>\n<p id=\"b80-6\">3. <em>Request for new counsel. </em>On the morning of the day the subsequent offender trial commenced, defense counsel informed the judge that the defendant wanted to continue the case in order to hire his own attorney.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> Although the defendant was not given an opportunity to explain himself, the record does not disclose any valid reasons to discharge defense counsel. While the better course would have been to \u201cpermit [the] defendant to advance his reasons for wanting to discharge his attorney\u201d so that the judge could exercise his discretion \u201con an informed basis,\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Moran, </em>388 Mass. 655, 659 (1983), quoting from <em>Lamoureux </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>353 Mass. 556, 560 (1968), in order to demonstrate prejudice the defendant must present \u201ca valid reason to discharge his attorney.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Moran, supra </em>at 660. In the absence of any such reason, we have no basis for concluding that the judge abused his considerable discretion by not initiating further inquiry into the defendant\u2019s request.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Clemens, </em>77 Mass. App. Ct. 232, 237-238 (2010) (although judge failed to provide defendant adequate opportunity to explain his reason<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"41\">*41</page-number>ing, no abuse of discretion where there was lack of sufficient facts warranting new counsel).</p>\n<p id=\"b81-4\">\n<em>Judgment affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b74-7\">General Laws c. 6, \u00a7 178H(s), as amended through St. 2006, c. 303, \u00a7\u00a7 4 &amp; 5, provides in pertinent part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b74-8\"><em>\u201c(a) A </em>sex offender required to register pursuant to this chapter who knowingly: (i) fails to register; (ii) fails to verify registration information; (iii) fails to provide notice of a change of address; or (iv) who knowingly provides false information shall be punished in accordance with this section.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b74-9\">The indictment, tracking the pertinent language of G.

Detective Aberdale then changed the defendant\u2019s status in the sex offender registry inquiry system (SORIS) by placing him \u201cin violation,\u201d which meant that he could be arrested from that point forward.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"11\">\n<p id=\"b77-8\">Although Boyd had known the defendant since childhood, she did not know his true name.

I conclude that the evidence was insufficient to support the defendant\u2019s conviction; therefore, I dissent.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b81-6\">The Commonwealth alleged two things: that (a) on March 31, 2010, the defendant was not living at the address that he had provided to the Springfield police department, and (b) between March 31, 2010, and April 30, 2010, the defendant changed his address without notifying the authorities of the change.</p>\n<p id=\"b81-7\">The testimony at trial was that on March 31, 2010, the defendant met with Detective Tracy Duda of the Springfield police department\u2019s sex offender registry unit for the purpose of fulfilling his obligation to register as a sex offender. At that time, the defendant and his girlfriend were staying with the girlfriend\u2019s friend, Shatina Boyd, a tenant at 691 State Street, apartment 3L, in Springfield.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Duda helped the defendant fill out the sex offender registration form, reviewed the requirements with him, and read the requirements aloud to him. The defendant, a special education student who dropped out of school after repeating the seventh grade, was unable to read.</p>\n<p id=\"b82-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"42\">*42</page-number>The completed registration form contained several errors. The form listed the date of registration as the \u201cthird day of the 31st month\u201d of 2010, and listed the defendant as Tony Johnson, a name that had been associated with the defendant in the past. Most importantly, the defendant\u2019s address was listed, improperly, as <em>619 </em>State Street, apartment 3L, instead of <em>691 </em>State Street, apartment 3L.</p>\n<p id=\"b82-5\">Shortly after the defendant completed the registration form, he and his girlfriend were forced to leave 691 State Street because Boyd was evicted for having too many people and too much traffic in the apartment.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Boyd\u2019s testimony regarding the date when the defendant left her apartment, though somewhat confusing and contradictory, is consistent with the defendant\u2019s testimony that he was living at the apartment on March 31, 2010.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b82-6\">While the Commonwealth\u2019s evidence showed that the defendant did not live at 619 State Street, the address on the form, the Commonwealth\u2019s own witness, Boyd, substantiated that the numbers on the form were mistakenly reversed, by her testimony <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"43\">*43</page-number>that the defendant and his girlfriend had been staying at her apartment at 691 State Street. Thus, the evidence did not establish beyond a reasonable doubt that the defendant provided a false address. As to the question whether the defendant was living at Boyd\u2019s apartment on March 31, 2010, the date the form was filled in, while the Commonwealth\u2019s evidence established that the defendant was not living at Boyd\u2019s apartment on April 8 and thereafter, it did not establish beyond a reasonable doubt that the defendant was not living at that address on March 31. See note 4, <em>supra. </em>When asked, \u201cWhen is the last time he lived your residence?\u201d Boyd responded, \u201cI\u2019ll say the end of March . . . .\u201d Moreover, other than April 8, Boyd\u2019s testimony in general as to time periods was based on estimates and attempted reconstructions, none of which is sufficient to establish beyond a reasonable doubt that the defendant was not living at that address on the date he signed the form.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> The Commonwealth\u2019s evidence thus was not sufficient to prove the charge of giving a false address beyond a reasonable doubt.</p>\n<p id=\"b83-7\">In his defense at trial the defendant testified that during the first part of April, he suffered a gunshot wound and, thereafter, became a material witness for the Hampden County district attorney\u2019s office. He later testified as a Commonwealth witness before a Hampden County grand jury. During the time he was a material witness, for most of April, 2010, the defendant was in protective custody, living in a motel in Connecticut at the direction of a Hampden County assistant district attorney referred to by the defendant by name.</p>\n<p id=\"b83-8\">Finally, the defendant testified that, after he appeared before the grand jury as a Commonwealth witness, the district attorney\u2019s office returned him to Springfield. After his return to Springfield, he was homeless and living on the street prior to his arrest on April 30, 2010, on the current charges. The defendant\u2019s testimony on these key matters was essentially unchallenged.</p>\n<p id=\"b83-9\">Even if the Commonwealth\u2019s evidence established that the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"44\">*44</page-number>defendant failed to comply with the registration requirements, the Commonwealth has failed to make the necessary showing of criminal intent.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark>,<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> \u201cConcerning whether the defendant \u2018knowingly\u2019 provided false information, G. L. c. 6, \u00a7 178H <em>(a), </em>does not require the Commonwealth to prove that a defendant intended to deceive the board, but the Commonwealth must prove that he knew the information was false.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Rosado, </em>450 Mass. 657, 662 (2008), citing <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Fondakowski, </em>62 Mass. App. Ct. 939, 940 (2005) (sufficient evidence that defendant knowingly provided false information to board where he had home in Northampton but placed \u201cHOME-LESS\u201d as his address and \u201cAny-where I can live\u201d as his city). On this record, the evidence was insufficient to prove beyond a reasonable doubt that the defendant <em>knowingly </em>provided false information about his residence or <em>knowingly </em>failed to provide notice of his intent to change his address.</p>\n<p id=\"b84-13\">Accordingly, I would reverse the conviction of failure to register as a sex offender and direct the entry of a judgment of not guilty on that charge. While the order finding a violation of probation and imposing sentence on the offense on which the violation of probation was found is not part of this appeal, in my view, because the conviction of failing to register in the present case, which I believe should be reversed, was one of the main bases for finding a violation of probation, the sentence imposed upon the revocation of probation should also be reconsidered.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b81-8\">The defendant was found guilty on the charge of failure to register as a sex offender, second offense, and, immediately thereafter admitted to a pending charge of violation of probation.</p>\n<p id=\"b81-9\">On the violation of probation charge, the judge sentenced the defendant on count one of the underlying indictment (on which the defendant had previously only been sentenced to probation) to a term of no less than three and one-half years, nor more than four and one-half years, to be served in State prison. On count two, the judge ordered the defendant to serve a concurrent sentence of between three and one-half and four and one-half years in State prison. On the new conviction of failure to register as a sex offender, the judge sentenced the defendant to five years\u2019 probation, to be served from and after the committed portion of his sentences.</p>\n<p id=\"b81-10\">During the sentencing proceeding, the judge commented that the defendant had several times failed to comply with registration requirements but had not committed any new sex crimes in the last five years.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b81-11\">Neither the defendant nor his girlfriend paid Boyd any rent for staying at the apartment.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b82-7\">After Boyd was evicted, she moved in for several months with a friend who lived in a fourth-floor apartment at 691 State Street.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b82-8\">Boyd testified as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b82-9\"><em>Q.: </em>\u201cWhen did [the defendant] come to live with you?\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b82-10\">A.: \u201cAround Christmas time.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b82-11\"><em>Q.: </em>\u201cAnd turning your attention to April 8th of 2010, did the defendant . . . live with you at that time?\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b82-12\">A.: \u201cNo. I got evicted.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b82-13\">The court: \u201cAnd when is the last time he lived at your residence?\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b82-14\">A.: <em>\u201cI\u2019ll say the end of March, </em>when it started getting nice out, he wasn\u2019t living with me\u201d (emphasis supplied).</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b82-15\"><em>Q.: </em>\u201cWhen you say that he was living back and forth,, did he stay with you every day of the week?\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b82-16\">A.: \u201cTowards the end he was staying with me, and then he would leave and then he would come back. But I know he was with me from December to March.\u201d</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b83-10\">Further, given Boyd\u2019s testimony that, \u201c[a]t the end,\u201d after the initial two- or three-month period the defendant was living with her, he was moving \u201cback and forth,\u201d plus the confusion as to the exact date the defendant moved out (see note 4, <em>supra), </em>the conclusion that he was not living at Boyd\u2019s apartment on March 31 and that he knowingly gave a false address \u2014 facts the Commonwealth had to prove beyond a reasonable doubt \u2014 is even weaker.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b84-22\">The showing is insufficient when the evidence is evaluated at the close of the Commonwealth\u2019s case, that is, regardless of whether the fact finder credited the defendant\u2019s testimony. If the fact finder believed the defendant\u2019s testimony, the sufficiency of the evidence on the element of intent becomes even more questionable.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"AR\">With regard to the charge of failure to report a change of address, an additional question arises. General Laws c. 6, \u00a7 178E(/i), as appearing in St. 1999, c. 74, \u00a7 2, requires a sex offender \u201cwho intends to change his residence within a city or town\u201d to provide notice \u201cno later than ten days prior to establishing such new residence.\u201d However, the defendant here, who was evicted and was homeless, apparently had not \u201cestablish[ed] [a] new residence.\u201d General Laws c. 6, \u00a7 178FV2, provides that a homeless sex offender must appear at the local police department every thirty days to verify that the registration information is accurate. The date the defendant here would have been required to report to the police department to verify registration information was April 30, thirty days after the March 31 registration; however, that was the date he was arrested. Moreover, he was not tried under the theory that he failed to verify registration information thirty days after his March 31 registration.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
