After an evidentiary hearing at <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"209\">*209</page-number>which State Trooper David Pinkham was the sole witness, the judge concluded that Pinkham lacked constitutional justification to (1) open the door to the defendant\u2019s vehicle, (2) seize an item that was not an illegal weapon, and (3) remove the defendant from the vehicle and restrain him. We conclude that the judge erred in applying the law to the facts found and reverse.</p>\n<p id=\"b249-5\">1. <em>Background. </em>Charged with various drug and other offenses, the defendant moved to suppress the evidence seized during a motor vehicle stop that occurred in the early morning hours of January 2, 2011, in Holyoke. The defendant contended that Pinkham (1) impermissibly opened the door to his vehicle based on the observation of an item Pinkham believed was an illegal weapon, (2) improperly removed the defendant from the vehicle, and (3) used more force than the Fourth Amendment to the United States Constitution and art. 14 of the Massachusetts Declaration of Rights permit in a <em>Terry-type </em>stop.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b249-6\">2. <em>Facts. </em>In reviewing a decision on a motion to suppress, \u201cwe accept the judge\u2019s subsidiary findings of fact absent clear error \u2018but conduct an independent review of [her] ultimate findings and conclusions of law.\u2019 \u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Scott, </em>440 Mass. 642, 646 (2004), quoting from <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Jimenez, </em>438 Mass. 213, 218 (2002).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The assessment of witness credibility is the exclusive province of the motion judge. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Isaiah I., </em>448 Mass. 334, 337-338 (2007); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Ciaramitaro, </em>51 Mass. App. Ct. 638, 639 (2001).</p>\n<p id=\"b249-7\">We recount the judge\u2019s factual findings, which mirror the testimony of Pinkham in all respects:<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<blockquote id=\"b249-8\">\u201cOn January 2, 2011 at approximately 1:55 AM, Trooper <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"210\">*210</page-number>David Pinkham, a Massachusetts State Police officer for five years, was on the drunk driving detail in Holyoke. He was patrolling southbound on Route 116 (Race Street) when he saw a motor vehicle (Acura coupe) driving northbound on Main Street without a front license plate. Trooper Pinkham proceeded to follow the Acura, at which point he saw that the motor vehicle\u2019s back plate was a \u2018red\u2019 plate. [If cars have a \u2018red\u2019 plate then by law they are to have a plate both in the back and in the front.] He also noticed the plate light was out. At this point, the Trooper activated his lights and pulled the motor vehicle over on Mosher Street.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b250-5\">\u201cOnce the car stopped, the Trooper noticed the driver\u2019s head duck out of sight for a moment and then re-appear. The Trooper left his spot light on in his unmarked cruiser lighting the Defendant\u2019s car. He approached the driver\u2019s side of the car and noticed the Defendant was smoking. He asked the Defendant to put out the cigarette, which the Defendant did. At this point, the Defendant told the Trooper he knew why he was being stopped \u2014 it was because he did not have an inspection sticker. [The Defendant claimed he had been stopped earlier in the day for that same problem.] While speaking with the Defendant, the Trooper noticed that the front license plate was actually on the driver side dash window. The Trooper explained why he had stopped the Defendant \u2014 missing front plate and the non-illuminated back plate.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b250-6\">\u201cThe Trooper asked the Defendant where he was coming from that night. As the Defendant answered the question (he was coming from his brother\u2019s house), he handed the Trooper his driver\u2019s license. At this point the Defendant leaned over to the glove box to retrieve the registration. While the Defendant was leaning over, the Trooper noticed either a wooden or leather handle in the area between the driver\u2019s door and seat. [There was no additional description given to the Court. No other \u2018identifying\u2019 marks consistent with a nunchaku[<footnotemark>4</footnotemark>] was [sic] seen. In fact, the Trooper stated on cross examination that he wasn\u2019t sure it <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"211\">*211</page-number>was a nunchaku and that is why he opened the door to retrieve the item and make a \u2018positive Id.\u2019] Based on this quick visual, he believed that he saw a nunchaku, a per se dangerous weapon, but was not sure. The Trooper told the Defendant to put his hands on the steering wheel where he could see them. He had to tell the Defendant twice, as the first time he commanded it, the Defendant was in the process of handing over the car\u2019s registration. Once his hands were on the steering wheel, to further investigate precisely the item seen, the Trooper opened the car door and retrieved the \u2018weapon.\u2019 While opening the door, the Trooper saw the Defendant pull his right hand off the steering wheel and reach towards his right hip. The Trooper again told the Defendant to keep his hands on the wheel. The Trooper finally retrieved the item, which turned out to be a bull whip. He put the bull whip on the roof of the car, and told the Defendant to get out of the car all while physically escorting him out of the car. [The Trooper held the Defendant by the left arm as he was removing him from the car.]</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b251-5\">\u201cOnce out of the car, the Defendant again tried to reach back with his right hand towards his right hip. The Trooper at this time told him to place his right hand on top of his head. Instead, the Defendant held his right arm up and away from his body. The Trooper again told him to put his right hand on his head. The Defendant complied. At this time, the Trooper noticed the Defendant\u2019s body started to tense-up. The Trooper increased his grip on his left arm and secured it in hand cuffs. He then took the Defendant\u2019s right arm and attempted to secure in the handcuffs, ultimately succeeding. As he was checking the tightness of the left handcuff, he could again feel the Defendant trying to reach to his right side. He noticed the Defendant had something cupped in his right hand. He told the Defendant to drop it, which he did. It was eight packets of heroin rubber banded together. At this point the Defendant was under arrest for heroin. A search incident to arrest was performed. In the car, the Trooper found 2 vials of lidocane <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"212\">*212</page-number>[\u00edzc] commonly used as a cutting agent for cocaine, a box of about 50 pirated DVDs, and 80 packets of heroin. In the Defendant\u2019s back pocket $1,950.00 was found.\u201d[<footnotemark>5</footnotemark>]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b252-5\">3. <em>Discussion. </em>As we have noted in the past, analysis of events in the stop and frisk context \u201cis not only fact intensive and time dependent, <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Torres, </em>424 Mass. 153, 163 n.8 (1997), but also interconnected and dynamic.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Ciaramitaro, </em>51 Mass. App. Ct. at 642. We examine the facts not in isolation, but as they reasonably and objectively appeared in the context of the ongoing encounter. See <em>ibid. </em>We assess \u201cwhether there were facts and circumstances in the course of [the] particular traffic stop that, viewed objectively, would give rise to \u2018a heightened awareness of danger\u2019 on the part of the trooper, . . . recognizing that law enforcement officials may have little time in which to avert \u2018the sometimes lethal dangers of routine traffic stops.\u2019 \u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Stampley, </em>437 Mass. 323, 326 (2002), quoting from <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Gonsalves, </em>429 Mass. 658, 665, 671 (1999), <em>S.C., </em>432 Mass. 613 (2000). A police officer need point only to some fact or facts in the totality of the circumstances that would create a heightened awareness of danger as to warrant an objectively reasonable officer in securing the scene in a more effective manner. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Gonsalves, </em>429 Mass, at 665.</p>\n<p id=\"b252-6\">With these principles in mind, we consider the facts found by the judge. Here, Pinkham\u2019s observations that the vehicle lacked a front license plate and an illuminated rear license plate supported a stop of the vehicle for civil motor vehicle infractions, and the defendant does not claim otherwise. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Santana, </em>420 Mass. 205, 207 (1995); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Ciaramitaro, supra. </em>At the outset of that stop, and prior to its ordinary conclusion, Pinkham made observations that provided a specific and articulable factual basis to believe (1) the defendant was in possession of a nunchuck, a prohibited dangerous weapon, and (2) the weapon posed a safety threat. See <em>Com</em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"213\">*213</page-number><em>monwealth </em>v. <em>Cruz, </em>459 Mass. 459, 466-467 (2011) (exit order justified if police possess particularized suspicion of criminal activity or reasonable apprehension of danger). It was 1:55 a.m., Pinkham was alone, and prior to reaching the defendant\u2019s vehicle, he saw the defendant duck out of sight momentarily before reappearing. As he stood next to the vehicle, Pinkham saw a wooden or leather handle in the area between the driver\u2019s seat and door next to the defendant\u2019s leg. Based on his training and experience, Pinkham believed the item was a nunchuck, a prohibited dangerous weapon, as he had seen nunchucks fashioned similarly.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> Given the dual concerns raised by these observations, Pinkham was fully justified in investigating further and securing any such weapons. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Va Meng Joe, </em>425 Mass. 99, 102 (1997); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Johnson, </em>454 Mass. 159, 162 (2009). The police are \u201cnot required to gamble with their personal safety,\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Robbins, </em>407 Mass. 147, 152 (1990), and are entitled to take reasonable precautions for their protection. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Willis, </em>415 Mass. 814, 817 (1993).</p>\n<p id=\"b253-5\">Contrary to the defendant\u2019s claim, Pinkham was not required first to inquire regarding the item rather than opening the door and removing it himself. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Stephens, </em>451 Mass. 370, 383-384 (2008). Neither the Federal Constitution nor the Massachusetts Declaration of Rights is so inflexible as to prohibit Pinkham from removing the weapon from the defendant\u2019s reach before ordering him to get out of the vehicle \u2014 especially when the item lay between the defendant and the driver\u2019s side door to the vehicle. Given the item\u2019s location and proximity to the defendant, Pinkham\u2019s assessment of the safest manner of securing it is a matter of judgment that we will not second guess. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Stampley, </em>437 Mass, at 328-329 (in analyzing danger posed during ongoing encounter with someone who may be armed, \u201csplit-second precision\u201d not required); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Cabrera, </em>76 Mass. App. Ct. 341, 350 (2010).</p>\n<p id=\"b253-6\">We do not agree with the motion judge that Pinkham\u2019s lack of certainty that the item was a nunchuck precluded him from <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"214\">*214</page-number>opening the door to investigate further and secure it. Central to the judge\u2019s determination was her observation that Pinkham\u2019s testimony provided no additional description or identifying marks beyond the object\u2019s wooden or leather handle. The judge noted that Pinkham acknowledged \u201cthat he wasn\u2019t sure it was a nunchaku and that is why he opened the door to retrieve the item and make a \u2018positive [identification].\u2019 \u201d<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> The governing standard is reasonable suspicion, not certainty, and the scenario encountered by Pinkham presented both a reasonable suspicion of criminal activity and a reasonable apprehension of danger. \u201cWhile a mere hunch is not enough, ... it does not take much for a police officer to establish a reasonable basis to justify an exit order or search based on safety concerns, and, if the basis is there, a court will uphold the order.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Gon</em>salves, 429 Mass, at 664. Viewed from that vantage, we con-elude that Pinkham\u2019s opening the vehicle\u2019s door to gain immediate access to what he believed was an illegal weapon was a reasonable and proportional measure necessary to confirm or dispel his suspicion and secure the weapon if necessary.</p>\n<p id=\"b254-22\">Pinkham\u2019s authority to investigate did not end when he opened the vehicle\u2019s door and discovered that the item was not a nunchuk, but a bull whip. Although his discovery of this unusual item<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> dispelled the suspicion that the defendant was in possession of an unlawful weapon, when viewed together with the defendant\u2019s pulling his right hand off the steering wheel and reaching toward his right hip as Pinkham opened the vehicle\u2019s door, the discovery heightened rather than alleviated safety concerns. \u201cThe justification for an exit order does not depend on the presence of an \u2018immediate threat\u2019 at the precise moment of the order, but rather on the safety concerns raised by the entire circumstances of the encounter.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Stampley, supra </em>at 328. Pinkham had ordered the defendant to keep his hands on the steering wheel, and as Pinkham opened the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"215\">*215</page-number>door, the defendant moved his right hand toward his right hip. \u201c[C]ertain conduct may cause an officer to become concerned that an occupant of a vehicle has access to a weapon. That the occupant is not reaching for a weapon at the exact moment of the exit order does not lessen the danger posed by an officer\u2019s ongoing encounter.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 328-329.</p>\n<p id=\"b255-5\">Nor did Pinkham\u2019s safety concerns end when he placed the bullwhip on the roof of the vehicle. Rather, the defendant\u2019s ignoring of Pinkham\u2019s commands to keep his hands on the steering wheel and his movement of his right hand toward his right hip necessitated escalating protective measures that were reasonable, measured, and proportional to the rapidly unfolding encounter. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. Sinforoso, 434 Mass. 320, 323-324 (2001). We discern no disproportionality in Pinkham\u2019s escorting the defendant from the vehicle by holding his left arm. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Johnson, </em>454 Mass, at 163-164 (officers \u201cnot required to accept the risk of . . . ambiguity\u201d posed by defendant\u2019s disregard of commands). Nor do we take issue with Pinkham\u2019s subsequent command that the defendant put his right hand on his head. That command was a reasonable and proportional response to the defendant\u2019s further attempt to reach back with his right hand toward his waist as Pinkham escorted him from the vehicle. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Ciaramitaro, </em>51 Mass. App. Ct. at 644, citing <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Borges, </em>395 Mass. 788, 794 (1985) (degree of intrusion on defendant must be proportional to degree of suspicion prompting intrusion). Given the defendant\u2019s continued ignoring of commands to keep his right hand on his head, his movement of his right arm up and away from his body, and his tensing of his body, Pinkham\u2019s securing the defendant in handcuffs was a reasonable and proportional measure for safely ascertaining whether the defendant had access to other weapons. Finally, the defendant\u2019s continued attempt to reach to his right side, even when in handcuffs, and Pinkham\u2019s observation that the defendant had something cupped in his right hand, supported his order for the defendant to drop what was cupped in his hand.</p>\n<p id=\"b255-6\">In sum, we view the safety measures employed by Pinkham to be reasonable and proportional to the escalating risk he faced at each passing moment in this rapidly unfolding encounter. See <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"216\">*216</page-number><em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Willis, </em>415 Mass, at 819-820; <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Williams, </em>422 Mass. 111, 117-119 (1996); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Pandolfino, </em>33 Mass. App. Ct. 96, 98 (1992) (\u201cuse of cuffs, if necessary to accomplish a permissible inquiry, does not convert a <em>Terry </em>stop to an arrest\u201d). We reverse the order allowing the defendant\u2019s motion to suppress evidence because we conclude, as matter of law, that Pinkham\u2019s actions, including his opening the door to the defendant\u2019s vehicle, his removal of the bullwhip and the defendant from the vehicle, and the subsequent protective measures he employed were reasonable and proportional to the risks encountered and permissible under art. 14. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Rivera, 61 </em>Mass. App. Ct. 362, 366-367 (2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b256-5\">\n<em>Order allowing motion to suppress reversed.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b249-9\">See <em>Terry </em>v. <em>Ohio, </em>392 U.S. 1, 21-22 (1968). Because the Fourth Amendment permits an exit order to a driver as a matter of course in a routine motor vehicle stop, see <em>Pennsylvania </em>v. <em>Mimms, </em>434 U.S. 106, 109-110 (1977), we focus on the greater protections afforded under art. 14. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Gonsalves, </em>429 Mass. 658, 662-663 (1999) (under art. 14, police must have reasonable belief that officer\u2019s safety, or safety of others, is in danger before ordering driver out of motor vehicle in routine traffic stop).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b249-10\">Neither the Commonwealth nor the defendant takes issue with any of the facts found by the motion judge.

An assessment of the entire record furnishes additional grounds for affirmance.</p>\n<p id=\"b256-7\"><em>Standard of review. </em>The standard of our review of a suppression order is settled black letter law. We accept the motion judge\u2019s subsidiary findings of fact unless they show clear error, but carry out an independent review of her ultimate findings and conclusions of law. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Jimenez, </em>438 Mass. 213, 218 (2002); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Scott, </em>440 Mass. 642, 646 (2004). The ultimate findings nonetheless receive \u201csubstantial deference.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Carr, </em>458 Mass. 295, 298 (2010), quoting from <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Monteiro, </em>396 Mass. 123, 131 (1985). The motion judge decides the credibility and weight of the evidence. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Moon, </em>380 Mass. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"217\">*217</page-number>751, 756 (1990); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Yesilciman, </em>406 Mass. 736, 743 (1990). The duty of the appellate court is then to determine independently \u201cthe correctness of the judge\u2019s application of constitutional principles to the facts as found.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Mercado, </em>422 Mass. 367, 369 (1996). Finally, the reviewing court may affirm a suppression decision on any ground supported by the record, even if neither the parties nor the judge relied on it below. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Va Meng Joe, </em>425 Mass. 99, 102 (1997); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Eggleston, </em>71 Mass. App. Ct. 363, 367 n.4 (2008).</p>\n<p id=\"b257-5\">Under these standards, I find three independently adequate grounds for affirmance: the arresting officer lacked reasonable grounds (1) to open the car door, (2) to remove the defendant from the car, and (3) to handcuff and search him outside the car. At each stage he violated a constitutional standard. Any one of the violations requires suppression of the resulting evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b257-6\">1. <em>Entering the car to search for nunchucks. </em>In addition to the findings recited by the majority, the motion judge rendered the following ruling in support of the suppression order.</p>\n<p id=\"b257-7\">\u201cThere is no dispute that the Defendant was stopped for motor vehicle infractions, initially the missing front plate and unlit back plate. He was also charged with having no inspection sticker. The issue is whether the Trooper could open the car door and seize what was ultimately not a per se dangerous weapon and continue with the removal and search of the Defendant. I find the Trooper did not have the right to open the car door to further his investigation of the alleged weapon. The Trooper admittedly was not sure what the item was. He clearly stated all he saw was a handle, either wooden or leather. There were no distinguishing marks he testified to that would allow a reasonable person to state it was in fact a weapon. He should have issued the citation for the motor vehicle infractions, and let the Defendant leave.</p>\n<p id=\"b257-8\">\u201cFor the foregoing reasons the Defendant\u2019s motion to suppress evidence is allowed.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b257-9\">This concluding language reemphasized the judge\u2019s earlier findings that Trooper Pinkham\u2019s \u201cquick visual\u201d glimpse of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"218\">*218</page-number>wooden or leather handle between the driver\u2019s seat and door left him \u201cnot sure\u201d of the nature of the object attached to it. The judge found specifically, as the majority acknowledges: \u201cThere was no additional description given to the Court. No other \u2018identifying\u2019 marks consistent with nunchaku [were] seen. In fact, the Trooper stated on cross examination that he wasn\u2019t sure it was a nunchaku and that is why he opened the door to retrieve the item and make a \u2018positive Id.\u2019 \u201d <em>Ante </em>at 210-211.</p>\n<p id=\"b258-5\">On direct examination by the prosecutor, the trooper\u2019s pertinent testimony consisted of the following:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b258-6\">The witness: \u201cAt that time when I was looking down into the vehicle, I observed the handle of what I believed to be a nunchuck.

The judge received no information elaborating on his experience or familiarity with nunchucks<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> or similar weapons. At the outset of his testimony, he reported that he had received an eight-hour basic training block in dangerous weapons at the State Police Academy five years before the encounter with the defendant. He did not tie his suspicion in this case to the content of either his training or his specific experience. The judge heard nothing about the timing, frequency, or nature of that experience. Nor did the trooper specify any elements of the size, shape, color, or markings of the wooden or leather handle supporting his suspicion of its attachment to a prohibited inherently dangerous and somewhat exotic weapon.</p>\n<p id=\"b260-5\">Nor did the collateral circumstances support his particular suspicion. The stop did not occur in a \u201chigh crime area.\u201d No dispatch information reported any criminal events or connected the defendant\u2019s vehicle to any investigation. The stop rested on civil vehicular infractions. The defendant exhibited no verbal or physical hostility toward the trooper. He appropriately provided his license and registration. He had no objects in his hands. He made no movements toward the floor.</p>\n<p id=\"b260-6\">Under the standards of both the Fourth Amendment to the United States Constitution and art. 14 of the Massachusetts Declaration of Rights, in order to detain a motorist after a routine traffic stop and his production of a valid driver\u2019s license <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"221\">*221</page-number>and registration, a police officer must identify \u201cspecific, articulable facts\u201d in support of a reasonable suspicion that an occupant of the car is involved in criminal conduct or \u201cengaged in other suspicious conduct.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Torres, </em>424 Mass. 153, 158 (1997), quoting from <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Torres, </em>40 Mass. App. Ct. 6, 9 (1996). See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Cardoso, </em>46 Mass. App. Ct. 901, 901 (1998). The same objective standard governs an officer\u2019s detention and search of a person or vehicle on the belief of a danger to the officer\u2019s safety. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Silva, </em>366 Mass. 402, 406 (1974); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Cardoso, supra. </em>\u201cA mere \u2018hunch\u2019 is not enough. Simple good faith on the part of an officer is not enough.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Silva, supra </em>(Hennessey, C.J.). Accord <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Cardoso, supra.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b261-5\">This case presents a classic example of a failed hunch. The linchpin of the Commonwealth\u2019s case is the reasonableness of the trooper\u2019s suspicion of the presence of the nunchuck weapon inside the car door, both as the commission of a crime (possession of a statutorily forbidden weapon) and as a threat to the trooper\u2019s safety.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> The transcript demonstrates abundantly that the trooper never articulated a reasonable basis for so particular a suspicion. Amid the defendant\u2019s generally proper response to the trooper\u2019s stop, his earlier head dip and fidgety hands did not permit an intrusion into the car. The trooper acknowledged that, without reasonable basis for his suspicion of a concealed nun-chuck, he lacked probable cause to search the car, i.e., to open the door and to reach within it. Indeed, the trooper never explained why his glimpse of a wooden or leather handle signified the likely presence of <em>any kind </em>of a weapon rather than a retractable umbrella. In these circumstances the judge correctly applied the objective standard of reasonably based suspicion and ruled that the trooper lacked justification to open the door and to proceed any further with the detention, seizure, and search of the defendant and the vehicle.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b262-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"222\">*222</page-number>2. <em>Removal of the defendant from the car. </em>The motion judge reasoned that the unjustified intrusion into the car invalidated all subsequent conduct of the trooper and required the suppression of all resulting evidence. I agree. If somehow that intrusion did not violate constitutional standards, then the immediate removal of the defendant from the automobile did so. According to the majority, the trooper\u2019s discovery of the bull whip <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"223\">*223</page-number>rather than a nunchuck \u201cviewed together with the defendant\u2019s pulling his right hand off the steering wheel and reaching toward his right hip as [the trooper] opened the vehicle\u2019s door . . . heightened rather than alleviated safety concerns.\u201d <em>Ante </em>at 214.</p>\n<p id=\"b263-5\">The trooper acknowledged that he immediately transferred the bullwhip from the interior floor to the roof of the car and then placed an \u201cescort\u201d hold on the defendant\u2019s left wrist and left upper arm and drew him out of the car. He offered two explanations for the exit maneuver. The first was that the defendant twice moved his hands off the steering wheel and on one of those occasions toward his right hip. On both occasions he returned his empty hands to the steering wheel. The second was his desire to separate the defendant from the potentially dangerous bullwhip on top of the car.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b263-6\">Article 14 governs the use of exit orders. It \u201crequires that a police officer, in a routine traffic stop, must have a reasonable belief that the officer\u2019s safety, or the safety of others, is in danger before ordering a driver out of a motor vehicle.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Gonsalves, </em>429 Mass. 658, 662-663 (1999). Again, a \u201cmere hunch\u201d is not sufficient. \u201c[N]or is nervousness or fidgeting on the part of the driver or passengers in a stopped vehicle an adequate reason to order them out of the car.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Torres, </em>433 Mass. 669, 673 (2001).</p>\n<p id=\"b263-7\">Here, neither ground invoked by the trooper stands up under analysis. He conceded that on both occasions the defendant complied with his orders to return his hands to the steering wheel. On neither occasion did he see a weapon or a bulge suggesting the presence of a weapon on the defendant\u2019s person. The alleged concern about the bullwhip is improbable. Pinkham had moved it from the reach of the defendant. His removal of the defendant from the car brought the defendant closer to the object, not farther. Finally, defense counsel accurately pointed out the unlikelihood of an assault on an armed officer by a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"224\">*224</page-number>bullwhip-wielding motorist.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> The removal and the unwieldiness of the bullwhip nullified its use as a dangerous weapon. The forcible extraction of the defendant was unjustified. The evidence resulting from it requires suppression.</p>\n<p id=\"b264-5\">3. <em>Handcuffing and search of the defendant outside the car. </em>The forced removal from the car flowed directly into the handcuffing and search of the defendant. The majority characterizes those measures as \u201creasonable and proportional to the escalating risk [which the trooper] faced at each passing moment in this rapidly unfolding encounter,\u201d citing, inter alia, <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Pandolfino, </em>33 Mass. App. Ct. 96, 98 (1992) (\u201cuse of cuffs, if necessary to accomplish a permissible inquiry, does not convert a <em>Terry </em>stop to an arrest\u201d). <em>Ante </em>at 215-216. I see no realistic support for that characterization in the evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b264-6\">The trooper did not \u201cface\u201d an escalating encounter, he created it and then used it as justification for the cuffing and body search. During direct examination by the Commonwealth, the trooper testified that, as he removed the defendant from the car, he ordered the defendant to place his right hand on top of his head:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b264-7\">\u201cHe moved his hand toward the top of his head but started tensing his left arm, and I became concerned. I placed his chest against the rear quarter panel of the vehicle, actually the window portion, and I tried to gain control of his right arm, and he was starting to pull it away from me. So I secured his left arm and pulled his right arm in as he was attempting to pull it away from me.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b264-8\">\u201cI got it behind him and I could feel that he was shak<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"225\">*225</page-number>ing at that time. And for my safety, I placed handcuffs on him.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b265-6\"><em>Q.: </em>\u201cOkay. So he was handcuffed at this time. But you were feeling that he was tense? Is that the word you used?\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b265-7\">A.: \u201cCorrect. He did tense up when I originally was removing him from the vehicle, <em>and I had told him to stop resisting and relax while I was getting his right arm behind his back\u201d </em>(emphasis supplied).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b265-8\">He repeated the substance of this testimony during cross-examination and added that his main concern was the defendant\u2019s refusal to place his right hand on top of his head.</p>\n<p id=\"b265-9\">On redirect he provided additional explanation:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b265-10\"><em>Q.\\ </em>\u201cWhy did you ask him to put his hand over his head?\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b265-11\">A.: \u201cSo I could view, and if he had complied properly with it, I could take hold of his right hand and place it behind his back.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b265-12\">In short, the purpose of the exit maneuver was from the beginning to place the defendant in handcuffs and frisk him. The trooper could not credibly have intended to perform the escort grapple and then leave the defendant standing unsecured outside the vehicle.</p>\n<p id=\"b265-13\">Most fundamentally he undertook this course of action still without reasonable suspicion that the defendant had committed, was committing, or was about to commit a crime; or that the defendant posed a threat to his safety, within the meaning of the stop-and-frisk doctrine of <em>Terry </em>v. <em>Ohio, </em>392 U.S. 1, 27 (1968). When the defendant \u201ctensed up\u201d or held his right hand <em>away </em>from his body as the trooper forcefully maneuvered him into handcuffing position, the trooper portrayed those reactions as justification for the predetermined cuffing. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Moline, </em>439 Mass. 206, 210 (2003) (police cannot create the exigency leading to a warrantless arrest and then treat it as justification for the arrest). In the absence of justification for the seizure and search of the defendant and of the search of the car <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"226\">*226</page-number>as incidental to his arrest, the results of the searches are inadmissible.</p>\n<p id=\"b266-5\"><em>Conclusion. </em>The evidentiary realities of the suppression hearing present a coherent story. The encounter moved rapidly; it was not a confrontation of gradual observation and proportional judgment by the trooper. The trooper propelled the entire course of events. He possessed a hunch: in a late night civil infraction stop, he had come upon a drug dealer. Once he opened the car door, he passed beyond the point of no return in the pursuit of the hunch. He progressed through the intrusion into the car, the forcible extraction of the defendant, and the manhandling cuffing and body search. \u201cIt is apparent that [the trooper] played a good hunch and fished until he caught something.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Torres, </em>424 Mass. 153, 161 (1997). I would affirm the order of suppression.</p>\n<p id=\"b267-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"227\">*227</page-number>Appendix.</p>\n<p id=\"b267-5\">Excerpted direct testimony of Trooper David Pinkham during the Commonwealth\u2019s case.</p>\n<p id=\"b267-6\"><em>Q.: </em>\u201cSo after you informed him about the nature of the stop, you indicated that he provided you with a driver\u2019s license.

He stated he was coming from his brother\u2019s, and he was reaching over to grab the registration out of the glove box, which afforded me a view between his seat and the lower door sill of the vehicle on the driver\u2019s side, just below his left leg.</p>\n<p id=\"b267-8\">\u201cAt that time when I was looking down into the vehicle, I observed the handle of what I believed to be a nunchuck.

What did you do then?\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b268-22\">A.: \u201cAt that time I told him to keep his hands on the wheel. I opened the door to the vehicle to remove the weapon from his arm span, wing span. I reached down for the vehicle \u2014 for the weapon, at which time I observed him move his right hand from the wheel, bringing it back toward his hip.</p>\n<p id=\"b268-23\">\u201cI again told him to keep his hands on the wheel, a little firmer this time telling him not to move his hands, and to keep them on the wheel.</p>\n<p id=\"b268-24\">\u201cI continued to view his hands while I was reaching down. I grabbed the item, started pulling it up, and he again moved his hand. I again told him to place his <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"229\">*229</page-number>hands up on the wheel. I placed the item, which turned out to be a bull whip, on the roof of the vehicle.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b269-5\"><em>Q.: </em>\u201cOkay. At this point what did you do?\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b269-6\"><em>A.: </em>\u201cAt this point with the weapon in the area and him moving away from me against my commands, I had told him to exit the vehicle, taking ahold of his left arm in an escort position.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b269-7\"><em>Q.: </em>\u201cOkay. Did he comply?\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b269-8\"><em>A.: </em>\u201cHe started stepping out of the vehicle. As he did so, he reached his right hand looking like he was reaching behind him. I told him to place his hand on top of his head.</p>\n<p id=\"b269-9\">\u201cHe placed his hand out to his side and up some, away from his body \u2014 that was his right hand \u2014 while I was holding his left arm. I told him again to place his hand on top of his head.</p>\n<p id=\"b269-10\">\u201cHe moved his hand toward the top of his head but started tensing his left arm, and I became concerned. I placed his chest against the rear quarter panel of the vehicle, actually the window portion, and I tried to gain control of his right arm, and he was starting to pull it away from me. So I secured his left arm and pulled his right arm in as he was attempting to pull it away from me.</p>\n<p id=\"b269-11\">\u201cI got it behind him and I could feel that he was shaking at that time.

App. Ct. 311, 314-315 (1992) (driver had no license, police officer noticeably outnumbered, aluminum baseball bat under front passenger seat, and back seat passenger holding a large \u2018boom box\u2019 in which weapon could have been secreted).\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b262-8\">Also in <em>Cardoso, </em>the court observed that the motion judge issuing the suppression order \u201chad the advantage of hearing the trooper\u2019s testimony.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 901. The judge here possessed the same advantage, especially for assessing the presence of a hunch or a guess. The judge did not expressly disbelieve the trooper\u2019s subjective good faith, nor did she need to do so under the objective standard. However, this case illustrates a practical consequence of fact finding reviewed under the standard of <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Isaiah </em>I., 448 Mass. 334, 337 (2007), <em>S.C., </em>450 Mass. 818 (2008): \u201cAppellate courts may supplement a judge\u2019s findings of facts if the evidence is uncontroverted and undisputed and where the judge explicitly or implicitly credited the witness\u2019s testimony.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b262-9\">If, as here, the only witness at a suppression hearing is the searching or arresting officer, the silence of a motion judge on the subject of the witness\u2019s credibility may invite the appellate impression of the judge\u2019s implicit acceptance of testimony. A judge disbelieving testimony, as either inadvertent error or intentional misstatement, must make the discrediting finding or risk a misunderstanding by the reviewing court. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Daniel, </em>464 Mass. 746, 749 (2013) (motion judge\u2019s express disbelief of police testimony of heightened awareness of danger prevents ambiguity under standard of <em>Isaiah I., supra). </em>In this instance, I view the judge\u2019s assessment of the trooper\u2019s nunchuck testimony as skeptical, but clearly sufficient under the objective standard to refute the majority\u2019s imputation of an \u201cerror of law.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b263-8\">Trooper Pinkham testified (1) that \u201cwith the weapon in the area [bullwhip on the roof] and him moving away from me against my commands, I. . . told him to exit the vehicle, taking a hold of his left arm in an escort position\u201d; (2) that he was wary of the defendant\u2019s possible intentions to use the bullwhip; and (3) that he was \u201cnot going to allow a person to remain free with a wing span to gain access to another weapon or item which could harm me.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b264-9\"> Defense counsel: \u201cYou must have had a sigh of relief that it wasn\u2019t a dangerous weapon?\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b264-10\">The witness: \u201cIt\u2019s a weapon.
