L. c. 94C, \u00a7 32E(\u00bf&gt;)(2).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> On appeal, the defendant presents two challenges to the sufficiency of the evidence. He contends that the Com<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"443\">*443</page-number>monwealth failed to prove (1) that he constructively possessed the drugs found in the center console of the automobile which he was driving; and (2) that the weight of the crack cocaine exceeded twenty-eight grams because the Commonwealth\u2019s chemist improperly extrapolated the net aggregate weight of the crack cocaine from a sampling of the packets found in the console. For the following reasons, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b483-5\"><em>Background. </em>The evidence permitted the judge to find the following facts. In July, 2009, Springfield police were conducting surveillance of the defendant. On one occasion, they observed him driving a white Lexus sport utility vehicle (SUV). The registration of the SUV identified the owner as Matrisa Collins, the defendant\u2019s girlfriend, with whom he shared an address. On July 23, 2009, the police observed the defendant driving the SUV with no passengers. He drove to a store parking lot, where a female entered the passenger\u2019s side of the SUV. The SUV traveled a very short distance and then stopped. The woman got out and walked away.</p>\n<p id=\"b483-6\">These observations prompted the police to stop and search the SUV and, later, the defendant.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The officers recovered (1) a white tube sock in the center console containing (a) a plastic bag of thirty-six individual packets of apparent crack cocaine; and (b) a plastic bag containing a larger chunk of apparent crack cocaine; (2) sixty-six dollars in cash; (3) on the front passenger\u2019s side seat, the defendant\u2019s personal papers; (4) from the driver\u2019s side door pocket, a cellular telephone; and (5) from the defendant\u2019s pants pocket, $585 in cash.</p>\n<p id=\"b483-7\">At trial, a chemist from the University of Massachusetts drug laboratory testified that the substances were crack cocaine. She testified also to the net weight of the drugs, and to the process of extrapolated measurement of that weight. She randomly had chosen four packets from the thirty-six, or approximately ten percent of the total, and entered their weights into a computer program. The program then computed an average weight of the four packets and a standard deviation to produce an aggregate net weight of the thirty-six packets of 14.29 grams. Because the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"444\">*444</page-number>larger chunk weighed 17.58 grams, the total net weight of the substances reached 31.87 grams.</p>\n<p id=\"b484-5\"><em>Analysis. </em>1. <em>Constructive possession. A </em>challenge to sufficiency requires review of the evidence in the light most favorable to the Commonwealth. Under the settled standard, we ask whether <em>\u201cany </em>rational trier of fact could have found the essential elements of the crime beyond a reasonable doubt.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Latimore, </em>378 Mass. 671, 677 (1979), quoting from <em>Jackson </em>v. Virginia, 443 U.S. 307, 318-319 (1979). To establish constructive possession, the Commonwealth must prove a defendant\u2019s (a) knowledge of the contraband; (b) ability to control it; and (c) intention to exercise control over it. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Brzezinski, </em>405 Mass. 401, 409 (1989). <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Boria, </em>440 Mass. 416, 418 (2003). <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Gonzalez, </em>452 Mass. 142, 146 (2008). Mere presence is insufficient proof. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Albano, 373 </em>Mass. 132, 134 (1977). <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Romero, </em>464 Mass. 648, 653, 654 (2013). Rather, \u201cadditional inculpatory evidence\u201d beyond a defendant\u2019s presence in, and operation of, a vehicle is necessary. <em>Id. </em>at 654. Additional incriminating evidence can \u201ctip the scale in favor of sufficiency.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 653, quoting from <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Albano, supra. </em>Here the evidence passes the tipping point.</p>\n<p id=\"b484-6\">The defendant was the driver and the sole occupant of the SUV. He lived with the registered owner of the vehicle; the previous day, she had permitted him to use the SUV. Exclusive and continuous operation of the SUV both supported the inference of the defendant\u2019s knowledge of its contents and reduced the number of possible alternate possessors. Contrast <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Almeida, </em>381 Mass. 420, 422-423 (1980) (no constructive possession of weapon in center console of vehicle which defendant had borrowed that evening); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Romero, supra </em>at 650, 656-657 (no constructive possession where defendant driver had multiple passengers in vehicle, and had no specific connection to weapon).</p>\n<p id=\"b484-7\">In addition, the police had observed suspected drug dealing behavior: the brief visit of the female passenger, the short drive to nowhere, and the passenger\u2019s quick exit. During the search, the police found the defendant\u2019s personal papers on the passenger\u2019s side seat adjacent to the console. These circumstances <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"445\">*445</page-number>strengthen the link between the defendant and the location of the drugs. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Clark, </em>446 Mass. 620, 624 (2006) (constructive possession where [a] cocaine found in center console; and [b] defendant had control of vehicle; even though [c] the Commonwealth did <em>not </em>establish ownership of vehicle); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Lee, </em>2 Mass. App. Ct. 700, 704-705 (1974) (constructive possession supported by evidence of personal papers in apartment where police found heroin). Additional indicia of intent to control the drugs included the defendant\u2019s possession of $585 in cash as inferable sales revenue, and the cellular telephone in the driver\u2019s side door pocket as an infer-able instmment of deals and delivery.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b485-5\">In sum, the aggregate evidence exceeds the defendant\u2019s mere presence in, or operation of, the vehicle. It \u201ctip[ped] the scale in favor of sufficiency,\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Romero, supra </em>at 653 (citation omitted), and permitted the judge to find both knowledge of the presence of the drugs and the ability and intent to exercise control over them. The evidence placed this case in the category of automobile decisions in which a defendant\u2019s proximity, access, and collateral conduct (here, his sole occupancy of the vehicle, and the brief visit by a suspected buyer) permitted the inference of an intention to exercise control over contraband or forbidden weaponry in the vehicle. See, e.g., <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Sadberry, </em>44 Mass. App. Ct. 934, 936 (1998) (weapon under driver\u2019s seat; motion of concealment as police approached); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Bienvenu, </em>63 Mass. App. Ct. 632, 638 (2005) (defendant, who owned vehicle, in back seat in close proximity to drug dealing instrumentalities); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Cotto, </em>69 Mass. App. Ct. 589, 592-593 (2007) (defendant\u2019s proximity to weapon beneath his automobile seat and his foot movement pushing it out of sight raise circumstantial evidence above level of mere presence).</p>\n<p id=\"b485-6\">2. <em>Weight by extrapolation. </em>The defendant challenges the extrapolated calculation of the weight of the thirty-six packets of crack cocaine found in the console. An essential element of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"446\">*446</page-number>the crime of trafficking in a class B substance (such as crack cocaine) under G. L. c. 94C, \u00a7 32E(b)(2), as in effect at the time of the defendant\u2019s conviction, was that the weight of the substance amount to twenty-eight grams, or more, but less than one hundred grams. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Johnson, </em>410 Mass. 199, 201 (1991). Conviction of trafficking in an amount within that range brought a mandatory minimum term of imprisonment of not less than five years. G. L. c. 94C, \u00a7 32E(b)(2).<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Conviction of trafficking in an amount of fourteen or more grams, but less than twenty-eight grams, carried a mandatory minimum term of not less than three years. G. L. c. 94C, \u00a7 32E(b)(1).<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b486-5\">Massachusetts precedent permits extrapolation processes. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Johnson, supra </em>at 201 &amp; n.l (identifying Federal and State jurisdictions allowing similar method of computation); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Shea, </em>28 Mass. App. Ct. 28, 33 (1989) (permitting \u201crepresentative tests\u201d where \u201cnumerous suspected bags ... are received for official analysis, all with substances evidently alike \u2014 as to color, consistency, packaging, smell, etc.\u201d); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Coplin, </em>34 Mass. App. Ct. 478, 485 (1993) (accepting chemist\u2019s \u201crandom sampling\u201d of twenty out of 174 packets of cocaine to calculate average weight per package and to impute weight to other 154 packets).</p>\n<p id=\"b486-6\">Here, in closing argument, defense counsel questioned the validity of extrapolated measurement on the ground of the allegedly disparate sizes of the packaged crack cocaine units. That contention framed the issue for the judge as the trier of fact. Defense counsel had cross-examined the chemist aggressively about her conduct of the extrapolation. The question is whether the thirty-six packets presented an array of sufficiently proximate sizes to permit the use of an average weight from a representative sampling. The packets came in evidence as an exhibit. The judge was able to inspect the exhibit and to assess <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"447\">*447</page-number>the relative sizes of the individual packets in light of the defendant\u2019s claim of a disparity rendering extrapolation unreliable. We are in no position to usurp his fact finding. We trust lay jurors with similar judgments. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Connolly, </em>454 Mass. 808, 831-832 (2009) (by extrapolation, jury may determine that \u201clarge, hard ball\u201d weighed more than four ounces). Under the <em>Latimore </em>standard, we should respect the comparable determination of an experienced trial judge. In the light most favorable to the Commonwealth, the evidence permitted a rational trier of fact to find the aggregate weight of the packets and the larger chunk (an exhibit of undisputed weight) to amount to twenty-eight grams or more. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Latimore, </em>378 Mass, at 677.</p>\n<p id=\"b487-5\">This case offers a useful observation. The extrapolated weighing of multiple units of drugs is likely to present a recurrent issue. In cases in which an extrapolated figure places the charged weight marginally at or above a statutory gradient triggering a greater offense and a longer imprisonment,<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> defense counsel should develop and present any challenge to the extrapolation by pretrial discovery, and pretrial conference and memorandum.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> By analogy, to preserve objections to deoxyribonucleic acid <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"448\">*448</page-number>(DNA) analysis, a \u201cdefendant must file an appropriate pretrial motion stating the grounds for the objections, and must request a hearing in accordance with the principles set forth in <em>Canavan\u2019s Case, </em>432 Mass. 304, 309-312 (2000), and <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Lanigan, </em>[419 Mass. 15, 24-27 (1994)],\u201d to test the reliability of a scientific or technical premise for proffered evidence. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Murphy, </em>59 Mass. App. Ct. 571, 575 (2003), citing <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Sparks, </em>433 Mass. 654, 659 (2001). The presentation of the issue well in advance of trial will enable a judge to inspect a challenged exhibit and, if necessary, to order a hearing upon the validity of the extrapolation process.</p>\n<p id=\"b488-5\">In a case of weight only marginally above a statutory boundary, the pretrial conference may prove especially valuable to expose and to solve (by related papers or preliminary hearing, as necessary) such issues as the reliability of the randomness of the elements of the selected sampling by protocols or standards, the use of standard deviation factors, and the employment of computer algorithms, if any. We cite these questions as potential matters, and not as either a mandatory or an exhaustive agenda. This cautionary approach does not require the Commonwealth routinely to employ sophisticated statistical methods for the presentation of every representative sampling.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> Nor does it compel the prosecution to prove the precise weight of the drugs. It need only establish that the weight exceeds the relevant threshold.</p>\n<p id=\"b488-6\">Extrapolation serves valid purposes, including performance of the Commonwealth\u2019s duty to prepare cases in accordance with the defendant\u2019s constitutional right to a speedy trial and its duty to employ finite public resources efficiently,<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> and ac<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"449\">*449</page-number>complishment of the prosecution\u2019s entitlement to scientifically valid methods of proof. If the Commonwealth does submit statistical proof in lieu of precise total measurement, it should be prepared to demonstrate the reliability of its extrapolation, particularly in cases of results falling close to the line.</p>\n<p id=\"b489-5\">We do not pass beyond these general observations. The concurrence pushes forward to a discussion of \u201celementary precepts of statistics.\u201d <em>Post </em>at 451. However, nothing in the parties\u2019 briefs or the record appendix undertakes that effort. We do not have the benefit of specific evidence and an adversary dialogue, or reference to technical sources, concerning detailed statistical methods. While the effort of the concurrence is commendable, appellate discussion should not outdistance the supply lines provided by the work of the parties\u2019 attorneys and the trial judge. We should not travel too far out in front of the record and the briefs, and into territory of little or no precedent.</p>\n<p id=\"b489-6\">In this case, the decisive question is whether <em>\u201cany </em>rational trier of fact could have found\u201d that the aggregate weight of the seized drugs amounted to twenty-eight grams or more. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. Latimore, 378 Mass, at 677, quoting from <em>Jackson </em>v. <em>Virginia, </em>443 U.S. at 318-319. An experienced judge as fact finder received the testimony of the chemist, the physical collection of the challenged packets, and the arguments of counsel upon the disputed point. The <em>Latimore </em>standard entitles his finding to respect. We cannot vacate it upon the basis of statistical arguments never submitted to him or to us.</p>\n<p id=\"b489-7\">\n<em>Judgment affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b482-14\">The defendant was convicted also of possession of \u201ccrack\u201d cocaine with intent to distribute, subsequent offense, and prosecuted as an habitual offender.

I agree with the majority that \u201c[w]e cannot vacate [the judgment] upon the basis of statistical arguments never submitted to [the trial judge] or to us.\u201d Nevertheless, as explained <em>infra, </em>I have concerns about whether the Commonwealth\u2019s use of statistical methods here was proper. I <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"450\">*450</page-number>join in affirming the judgment only because the defendant failed to preserve the issue.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b490-4\">The Commonwealth offered testimony that the weight of the \u201ccrack\u201d cocaine exceeded the relevant statutory threshold for the crime charged, and that testimony was admitted without objection. Accordingly, there is no merit to the defendant\u2019s claim that the evidence of weight was insufficient as a matter of law. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Farnsworth, </em>76 Mass. App. Ct. 87, 98-99 (2010). What the defendant really appears to be suggesting is that this evidence never should have been admitted because the Commonwealth had not established the reliability of the underlying extrapolation methods on which such evidence relied. Given that existing case law establishes that there is nothing inherently problematic about the use of such methods,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> it was incumbent on the defendant to bring a timely challenge to the particular manner in which the Commonwealth used them here. The defendant did not raise such concerns prior to trial, nor did he even object to the introduction of the weight testimony at trial. The issue therefore has been waived. Compare <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Fernandez, </em>458 Mass. 137, 149-150 (2010) (no error in judge declining to hold full hearing, pursuant to <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Lanigan, </em>419 Mass. 15, 25-26 (1994), regarding drug field test where defendant did not raise issue until day trial commenced).</p>\n<p id=\"b490-5\">To the extent that the defendant now argues that the introduction of the evidence was an error that caused a substantial risk of a miscarriage of justice, the defendant carries the burden of proof. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Robinson, </em>83 Mass. App. Ct. 419, 427 (2013). In my view, the defendant has not made \u2014 and cannot make \u2014 such a showing based on the current limited record.</p>\n<p id=\"b491-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"451\">*451</page-number>Nevertheless, this case well illustrates some of the potential problems with the use of statistical methods.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark>1 offer the following observations in order to ensure that my supporting affirmance of the judgment is not misunderstood, and to lend some clarity to how the underlying issues properly should be analyzed.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b491-4\">According to the Commonwealth\u2019s certificate of drug analysis, the total weight of the thirty-six individual chunks of crack cocaine amounted to 14.29 grams (which, when added to the undisputed weight of the larger chunk, yielded a total weight of 31.87 grams). The Commonwealth effectively treats the 14.29 figure as the actual weight of the crack cocaine as measured using statistical methods.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> This is inaccurate. Weighing all of the crack cocaine is the only means of actually measuring its total weight. The extrapolation method employed here does not measure the total weight; instead, it serves only to estimate that weight based on the assumption that the few samples the chemist chose are representative. Under elementary precepts of statistics, that estimate would be more or less reliable depending on such <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"452\">*452</page-number>factors as the sample size employed, whether the selection of the samples was actually random (or instead infected by selection bias), and the extent of variation among the weight of the sampled population. See generally Witte &amp; Witte, Statistics \u00a7\u00a7 12.4-12.5 (9th ed. 2010). Statisticians typically express the degree of comfort that such estimates provide through concepts such as \u201cconfidence levels.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at \u00a7 12.4.</p>\n<p id=\"b492-4\">The 14.29-gram figure came in evidence unadorned by any explanation of its statistical reliability in the particular circumstances. The algorithms and underlying assumptions upon which the figure is based were not revealed, and the computer program that the analyst used to generate the estimate was treated as a so-called \u201cblack box.\u201d<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> The absence of any explanation of the validity and the meaning of the Commonwealth\u2019s estimate renders it difficult for a lay fact finder to evaluate the import of this evidence. In such circumstances, there is a danger that the fact finder simply will accept the estimated weight without appropriate scrutiny. Cf. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. Ferreira, 460 Mass. 781, 785 (2011) (substantial risk of miscarriage of justice where \u201c[t]he apparent simplicity of the mathematics belies the complexity of the conclusion regarding the probability of an accurate identification, and conceals the assumptions implicit in the conclusion\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b492-5\">In addition, there are at least two factors here that raise some particular concern about the appropriateness of relying on extrapolation methods. One involves lingering questions about whether the four samples were in fact randomly chosen.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> The other involves the degree of variability among the samples.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"453\">*453</page-number>Because of such concerns, I do not believe that we can say that the Commonwealth\u2019s invocation of its statistical methods was proper.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b490-6\">I concur in the majority\u2019s analysis of the constructive possession issue with one qualification. In light of the current ubiquity of cellular telephones, I believe it is time for an appellate court to acknowledge that the mere presence of a single cellular telephone in a defendant\u2019s possession is of no appreciable inculpatory value. There was no evidence that the cellular telephone here was a disposable telephone (commonly known as a \u201cburner\u201d).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b490-7\">See, e.g., <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Johnson, </em>410 Mass. 199, 200-201 &amp; n.l (1991); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Shea, </em>28 Mass. App. Ct. 28, 33 (1989); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Coplin, </em>34 Mass. App. Ct. 478, 485 (1993).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b491-7\">The current case law tends to mask these issues by treating the use of representative sampling the same regardless of whether the testing being done goes to the weight or the identity of the drugs. Compare <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Shea, </em>28 Mass. App. Ct. 28, 33 (1989) (approving use of sampling to prove that all nine packets contained cocaine), with <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Coplin, </em>34 Mass. App. Ct. 478, 485 (1993) (relying on <em>Shea </em>to approve estimation of total weight of 174 packets of cocaine). The analogy breaks down under scrutiny. There are commonsense reasons to assume that similar looking, similarly packaged substances found on someone are likely the same substance, a conclusion that does not rely on unvoiced statistical analysis.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b491-10\">The majority protests that, by including analysis that is not argued \u201cin the parties\u2019 briefs or the record appendix,\u201d I \u201coutdistance the supply lines provided by the work of the parties\u2019 attorneys and the trial judge.\u201d <em>Ante </em>at 449. Such statements suggest that the issues flagged here are fundamentally different from those raised by the defendant. That is inaccurate. Indeed, the majority notes that the defendant at trial \u201cquestioned the validity of extrapolated measurement on the ground of the allegedly disparate sizes of the packaged crack cocaine units.\u201d <em>Ante </em>at 446. To be sure, the defendant, both below and on appeal, exhibited a less than full understanding of the specific nature of the potential problems here (a shortcoming shared by the Commonwealth). There is nothing inappropriate about trying to shed some light on how such issues properly should be examined based on elementary precepts of statistics.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b491-11\">There are similar intimations by the majority. See <em>ante </em>at 443 &amp; 446 (referring to the Commonwealth\u2019s computer program as \u201cproducing] an aggregate net weight,\u201d and referring to extrapolation as a \u201cmethod of computation\u201d).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b492-6\">In response to a question whether she took \u201cthe average [weight] and multiplied] that average by thirty-six,\u201d the chemist stated that the computer software does that \u201cmore or less.\u201d She also stated that the program \u201cextended] a standard deviation,\u201d without further explanation.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b492-7\">Although the chemist characterized the samples she selected as \u201crandom,\u201d she agreed with defense counsel\u2019s characterization that her use of the term \u201crandom\u201d means, \u201c[Y]ou look[ed] at them and said, \u2018I will take this one, I will take this one, I will take this one.\u2019 \u201d There was no testimony that the laboratory had instituted measures to ensure that sample selection was in fact randomly generated.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b492-8\">The chemist characterized the thirty-six packets as being \u201cpretty consistent in size,\u201d and she offered that this was why she \u201cconsidered them one batch of thirty-six.\u201d In fact, the results showed a fairly significant amount of variation <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"453\">*453</page-number>in the weight of the \u201crandomly\" chosen packets, with the four samples weighing .2 grams, .3944 grams, .445 grams, and .53 grams. Thus, the crack cocaine in the largest packet sampled weighed more than two and one-half times that in the smallest packet sampled. To place these figures in context, the thirty-six packets would reach the requisite statutory threshold (in combination with the larger chunk of crack cocaine) if they averaged at least .29 grams each. Notably, a police witness testified that the bags found were packaged for sale at different prices. Therefore, the pronounced variation among the bags is hardly surprising.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"9\">\n<p id=\"b493-13\">To the extent that the majority concludes that the Commonwealth has demonstrated that the use of statistics was proper here, I respectfully disagree that we are able to offer such assurances on the current record. Of course, as the majority observes, there are undoubtedly many situations where the Commonwealth could rely on representative sampling without invoking rigorous statistical analysis. <em>Ante </em>at 448. However, it is far from clear that this is one of them. Although the trial judge had the thirty-six packets of crack cocaine before him, it does not appear that he was even in a position to identify which four of the packets actually had been weighed (the individual packets do not appear to be marked and the chemist did not point out which ones were sampled). Without an established benchmark, trying to estimate the weight of the packets by \u201ceyeballing\" them would be, at a minimum, difficult. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Montoya, </em>464 Mass. 566, 574-575 (2013). Contrast <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Connolly, </em>454 Mass. 808, 831-832 (2009) (in case that did not rest on statistical extrapolation, jury could determine that \u201clarge, hard ball\u201d of cocaine weighed more than four ounces, and hence more than one hundred grams).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
