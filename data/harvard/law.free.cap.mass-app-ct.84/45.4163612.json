McLaughlin, a former fire department captain retired on a disability pension, sought restoration to service. He appeals the entry of summary judgment in favor of the city with respect to his reinstatement claim under G. L. c. 32, \u00a7 8(2). Having successfully brought handicap discrimination and interference claims, however, which resulted in jury verdicts in his favor, McLaughlin avers that the trial judge improperly eviscerated the remedial scheme of G. L. c. 15IB and arbitrarily reduced the amount of his attorney\u2019s fees and costs.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b86-8\">On the other hand, the city contends that the Superior Court lacked jurisdiction over McLaughlin\u2019s discrimination claims and erroneously allowed McLaughlin to relitigate matters already decided before the Division of Administrative Law Appeals (DALA) and the Contributory Retirement Appeal Board (CRAB). The city additionally argues that McLaughlin did not prove a prima facie case of handicap discrimination or interference and, further, that the judge erred in giving certain jury instructions.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> We affirm in part and reverse in part.</p>\n<p id=\"b86-9\">1. <em>Background. </em>McLaughlin began working as a firefighter with the Lowell fire department (LFD) in 1974, ultimately attaining the rank of captain. On July 8, 1996, McLaughlin suf<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"47\">*47</page-number>fered an asthma attack after responding to a small outdoor mulch fire without wearing protective gear. Thereafter, McLaughlin applied for and was granted accidental disability retirement under G. L. c. 32, \u00a7 7, effective February 1, 1997. Since retiring, McLaughlin has not suffered another asthma attack, despite regular exercise and his ceasing the use of any asthma medication. In late 2000, with the support of his pulmonologist, Dr. Joseph Walek, McLaughlin sought reinstatement to his former position as captain with the LFD, pursuant to G. L. c. 32, \u00a7 8.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"ANJ\">2. <em>Procedural history. </em>In connection with McLaughlin\u2019s application for reinstatement, a three-member medical panel was designated and convened under the authority of the Public Employee Retirement Administration Commission (PERAC) pursuant to G. L. c. 32, \u00a7 8(1)(6). The medical panel, consisting of Dr. Dean Hashimoto, Dr. Ronald Dorris, and Dr. Donald Kaplan, examined McLaughlin separately on dates in September and December of 2001. Thereafter, each physician certified that McLaughlin could perform the essential functions of the position. By notice dated December 4, 2001, PERAC then instructed the Lowell retirement board (LRB) to advise the city to reinstate McLaughlin to service. However, on review of the narratives of the medical panelists, the LRB forwarded to PERAC a request for clarification by letter dated January 2, 2002, indicating that it was unclear whether the medical panelists properly reviewed the job descriptions for a fire fighter and captain, as opposed to a fire chief, and whether \u201cthe use of inhalers in any way limited McLaughlin\u2019s] functions as a fire fighter.\u201d See 840 Code Mass. Regs. \u00a7 10.11(2) (2008).<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> All three physicians reaffirmed their opinions (second medical panel). On January 17, 2002, PERAC so notified the LRB, and accordingly, on January 25, 2002, the LRB directed the city to reinstate McLaughlin as captain. At that time, there were no immediate vacancies for that position.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"Ath\">Thereafter, the city obtained and reviewed McLaughlin\u2019s PERAC file, apparently with McLaughlin\u2019s permission. On <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"48\">*48</page-number>May 14, 2002, the city petitioned PERAC to seek further clarification from the medical panel, opining \u201cthat the doctors d[id] not fully understand the job duties of a fire fighter, or the hazards that Mr. McLaughlin will encounter when fighting fires.\u201d<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> In connection with its request, the city enumerated seven concerns, including the permanence of McLaughlin\u2019s asthma diagnosis and that McLaughlin is absolutely prohibited from using an inhaler or taking any medication while fighting a fire.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> On June 7, 2002, PERAC denied the city\u2019s request for further clarification, and the city sought administrative review of the denial with DALA in accordance with G. L. c. 32, \u00a7 16(4). Following a hearing, in a decision dated July 22, 2003, the DALA magistrate ordered PERAC to remand the matter to the medical panel \u201cfor clarification concerning both Mr. McLaughlin\u2019s duties as a Fire Captain as well as the impact, if any, the departmental prohibition against the use of inhalers at fire scenes has on his ability to perform the essential duties of his position.\u201d<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> PERAC appealed DALA\u2019s decision to CRAB pursuant to G. L. c. 32, \u00a7 16(4). CRAB, by a decision dated March 31, 2004, adopted the DALA magistrate\u2019s twenty-two findings of fact and affirmed the DALA magistrate\u2019s decision; CRAB similarly ordered \u201cPERAC to request clarification from the medical panel as to whether\u201d each panelist\u2019s decision regarding McLaughlin\u2019s ability to perform the essential duties of his position would change in light of the following facts: (1) \u201ca Fire Cap<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"49\">*49</page-number>tain is required to report to all working fires and to assist in all aspects of fire suppression\u201d; and (2) \u201cthe use of inhalers at a fire scene is strictly prohibited.\u201d<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b89-5\">Pursuant to the orders of the administrative tribunals, PERAC requested clarification from the medical panel on June 8, 2004.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> Upon reconsideration, neither Dr. Hashimoto nor Dr. Dorris changed their opinions; however, Dr. Kaplan concluded to the contrary, specifically stating: \u201cMcLaughlin may very well suffer from bronchospasm when exposed to fumes at a fire and would require the use of an inhaler. Accordingly, he must be considered unable to fulfill the essential duties of his position.\u201d Thus, the third medical panel\u2019s decision was not unanimous. See 840 Code Mass. Regs. \u00a7 10.13(2)(b) (2002).<footnotemark>11</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b89-6\">On May 24, 2004, McLaughlin filed suit against the city in Superior Court. McLaughlin amended his complaint on February 9, 2006, to include the third medical panel\u2019s decision, which had been pending at the time the original complaint was filed. After the trial judge disposed of numerous motions in limine, the parties filed cross-motions for summary judgment with respect to McLaughlin\u2019s claims under G. L. c. 32, \u00a7 8, which <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"50\">*50</page-number>alleged that the city failed to reinstate him as captain and that the city imposed an unlawful retraining program as a condition of reinstatement. On November 29, 2010, the trial judge allowed the city\u2019s motion for summary judgment, concluding that Dr. Kaplan\u2019s assessment that McLaughlin was unable to perform the duties of captain was \u201cvalid, supported by the record, and not based on any unlawful or discriminatory considerations.\u201d<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> Consequently, the trial judge concluded, McLaughlin had no right to reinstatement because the third medical panel\u2019s decision lacked the unanimity required by 840 Code Mass. Regs. \u00a7 10.13(2)(b).<footnotemark>13</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b90-5\">McLaughlin\u2019s claims under G. L. c. 151B proceeded to trial by jury in December, 2010. On December 13, 2010, the jury found for McLaughlin on all remaining counts, including that McLaughlin was a handicapped person qualified to perform the essential duties of a captain and that the city intentionally interfered with McLaughlin\u2019s protected rights, and awarded $350,000 in damages. The trial judge entered judgment on the jury verdict on December 15, 2010, ordering that McLaughlin recover $350,000 plus interest, together with costs. On April 28, 2011, the trial judge allowed McLaughlin\u2019s posttrial motion for reasonable attorney\u2019s fees and costs and the city\u2019s motion for a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"51\">*51</page-number>remittitur of the damages award, which McLaughlin accepted. The trial judge denied the city\u2019s motions for judgment notwithstanding the verdict and for a new trial. On April 29, 2011, the trial judge issued an amended judgment, ordering that McLaughlin recover $200,000 plus interest, together with costs of $15,000 and attorney\u2019s fees of $235,000. The city filed its notice of appeal on May 27, 2011, and McLaughlin filed his notice of cross-appeal on June 8, 2011.</p>\n<p id=\"b91-5\">3. <em>Discussion, </em>a. <em>Reinstatement claims. </em>McLaughlin avers that the trial judge erred in granting summary judgment for the city by engaging in fact-finding on issues that McLaughlin had disputed at that juncture. Specifically, McLaughlin contends that record evidence, including admissions by the city, demonstrated that the use of an inhaler at a fire scene was neither impossible nor impermissible and, as such, the trial judge\u2019s findings to the contrary were improper. McLaughlin further argues that the trial judge erred in denying his motion for summary judgment based on the first medical panel\u2019s December, 2001, unanimous determination that he was able to perform the duties of a captain.</p>\n<p id=\"b91-6\">i. <em>Standard of review. </em>\u201cOn appellate review of a judge\u2019s decision on cross motions for summary judgment, we view the record in the light most favorable to the party against whom the judge allowed summary judgment, here [McLaughlin],\u201d <em>Marhefka </em>v. <em>Zoning Bd. of Appeals of Sutton, </em>79 Mass. App. Ct. 515, 516 (2011), to determine whether \u201call material facts have been established and [the city] is entitled to a judgment as a matter of law.\u201d <em>Augat, Inc. </em>v. <em>Liberty Mut. Ins. Co., </em>410 Mass. 117, 120 (1991). See Mass.R.Civ.P. 56(c), as amended, 436 Mass. 1404 (2002). \u201cWhen reviewing a grant of summary judgment we consider the pleadings, depositions, answers to interrogatories, and responses to requests for admission under Mass. R.Civ.P. 36, 365 Mass. 795 (1974), together with the affidavits, and ask if there is any genuine issue as to any material fact.\u201d <em>Federal Natl. Mort. Assn. </em>v. <em>Hendricks, </em>463 Mass. 635, 637 (2012).</p>\n<p id=\"b91-7\">ii. <em>G. L. c. 32, \u00a7 8. </em>General Laws c. 32, \u00a7 8(2)(a), as appearing in St. 1998, c. 252, \u00a7 2, provides in relevant part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b91-8\">\u201cIf, after two years of the date that a member is retired <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"52\">*52</page-number>under section ... 7 [relating to accidental disability], the regional medical panel determines that the retired member is qualified for and able to perform the essential duties of the position from which he retired . . . , said member shall be returned to said position, provided the position is vacant.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b92-5\">In short, \u201cG. L. c. 32, \u00a7 8(2), compels reinstatement of retired employees once properly cleared by the retirement board, and a vacancy exists.\u201d <em>Sullivan </em>v. <em>Brookline, </em>435 Mass. 353, 354 (2001). Although G. L. c. 32, \u00a7 8(2), is silent on the nature of the medical panel\u2019s determination with respect to the disability retiree\u2019s ability to perform essential job functions, a regulation promulgated by PERAC in 2000 permissibly imposes a requirement for unanimous panel action. See 804 Code Mass. Regs. \u00a7 10.13(2)(b) (set forth at note 11, <em>supra); Pulsone </em>v. <em>Public Employee Retirement Admin. Commn., </em>60 Mass. App. Ct. 791, 796 (2004). Moreover, on review of a medical panel\u2019s report, the retirement board is entitled to request from the medical panel \u201cadditional information\u201d or \u201cfurther clarification\u201d if the retirement board determines that the request is necessary. 840 Code Mass. Regs. \u00a7 10.11(2) (2008).<footnotemark>14</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b92-6\">On the facts before us, the medical panel unanimously determined that McLaughlin was able to perform the essential functions of captain in December, 2001, and again in January, 2002, following the LRB\u2019s request for clarification. It was not until after the city\u2019s second request for clarification in May, 2002 \u2014 which, inter alia, articulated a categorical prohibition on McLaughlin\u2019s use of inhaler or any other medication while actively engaged in fighting a fire and inquired whether, if so informed, the panel had a change of opinion in response thereto \u2014 that Dr. Kaplan ultimately determined that McLaughlin was unable to perform the essential duties of a captain, thereby disrupting <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"53\">*53</page-number>the unanimity of the medical panel\u2019s two prior determinations.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> McLaughlin urges, however, that Dr. Kaplan\u2019s third decision was deficient, and thus should be regarded as a nullity because he impermissibly relied on an LFD rule allegedly fabricated by the city in order to intentionally delay McLaughlin\u2019s restoration to service.</p>\n<p id=\"b93-5\">Specifically, McLaughlin contends that he properly disputed whether a fire fighter would be able to use an inhaler at a fire scene and whether any rule, regulation, or order from the LFD prohibited a fire fighter from doing so. In support, McLaughlin cites to that portion of the \u201cConsolidated Statements of Facts and Responses Thereto,\u201d which included reference to Lowell fire Chief William Desrosiers\u2019s deposition, and provided that fire fighters routinely exit a fire scene every twenty to thirty minutes to switch their oxygen tanks and remove their breathing apparatuses. While the city, in response, noted that fire fighters wear fresh air \u2014 not oxygen \u2014 tanks while combating active fires, it did not dispute that fire fighters routinely exit a fire scene every twenty to thirty minutes in order to switch their empty fresh air tanks. Given this agreed fact, McLaughlin\u2019s argument that this evidence raises a genuine issue of material fact with respect to the city\u2019s repeated assertions that \u201cthe performance of [McLaughlin\u2019s] duties as a firefighter would prevent him from using an inhaler at a fire scene because he cannot remove a face mask while fighting a fire in a smoky area\u201d has surface appeal, unless otherwise precluded. The LFD is not heard to dispute that McLaughlin could use an inhaler during a tank change away from the active fire fighting activities. Moreover, McLaughlin does not genuinely dispute the fact that he would not be allowed to remove his mask when actively engaged in fighting a fire, nor that the circumstances of the fire suppression activities might <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"54\">*54</page-number>prevent him from being able to exit at will. Nonetheless, we determine that McLaughlin is precluded from relitigating the issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b94-5\">iii. <em>Collateral estoppel. </em>To evaluate the validity of Dr. Kaplan\u2019s determination that McLaughlin is unable to perform the essential functions of a captain, we must revisit the decisions rendered by both the DALA magistrate and CRAB; we note, however, that McLaughlin never appealed from CRAB\u2019s ultimate determination. In July, 2003, the DALA magistrate reversed PERAC\u2019s decision denying the city\u2019s request for further clarification from the medical panel.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> Thereafter, McLaughlin appealed the decision of the DALA magistrate to CRAB, which adopted the DALA magistrate\u2019s findings of fact in full, explicitly stating: \u201cThis board also finds that the [LFD] prohibits the use of inhalers at a fire scene.\u201d CRAB then remanded the matter to PERAC, ordering PERAC to request that the medical panel reconsider its opinion that McLaughlin could perform the essential duties of a captain specifically in light of the departmental prohibition on inhalers. Although G. L. c. 30A, \u00a7 14, affords any person aggrieved by a final decision of an agency in an adjudicatory proceeding a judicial review thereof, McLaughlin did not seek judicial review within thirty days after his receipt of notice of CRAB\u2019s March 31, 2004, decision. See <em>Retirement Bd. of Salem </em>v. <em>Contributory Retirement Appeal Bd., </em>453 Mass. 286, 288-289 (2009) (discussing judicial review of CRAB decisions).</p>\n<p id=\"b94-6\">Instead, McLaughlin filed suit in Superior Court on May 24, 2004, seeking, as here relevant, a judgment declaring that he is fit to return to work and certain injunctive relief. A judge of the Superior Court (dismissal judge) dismissed McLaughlin\u2019s reinstatement claims without prejudice.<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> After the third medical panel rendered its divided decision upon reconsideration, which <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"55\">*55</page-number>resulted in the city\u2019s refusal to reinstate McLaughlin, McLaughlin amended his complaint, which survived the city\u2019s motion to dismiss.<footnotemark>18</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b95-5\">Consequently, while it is clear that McLaughlin challenged the validity of the third medical panel\u2019s decision, he challenged neither CRAB\u2019s decision ordering reconsideration of the second medical panel\u2019s decision nor the facts on which the third medical panel\u2019s decision was based. Nevertheless, McLaughlin alleged the following facts for the first time in his amended complaint:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b95-6\">\u201c41. On or about June 8, 2004, PERAC provided Drs. Dorris, Kaplan, and Hashimoto (\u2018the doctors\u2019) with a memorandum <em>falsely asserting that [the city] maintained a policy prohibiting the use of inhalers at a fire.</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b95-7\">\u201c42. Based upon this <em>false assertion, </em>the doctors were asked if their opinions of McLaughlin\u2019s ability to perform the essential duties of his position would change.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b95-8\">\u201c54. <em>[The city] falsely asserted that it had a policy against the use of inhalers at a fire and improperly demanded another clarification based upon this alleged fact. \u2019</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b95-9\">\u201c55. <em>Based upon [the city\u2019s] false assertion of a policy against the use of inhalers at a fire, </em>the third medical panel did not clear McLaughlin for reinstatement.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b95-10\">(Emphasis supplied).</p>\n<p id=\"b95-11\">On appeal, the city argues that McLaughlin\u2019s allegations that the city falsely asserted that it had a policy against the use of inhalers was an issue fully and finally litigated before DALA <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"56\">*56</page-number>and CRAB. According to the city, DALA\u2019s determination, adopted by CRAB, that \u201cthe use of inhalers at a fire scene is strictly prohibited\u201d must be given preclusive effect. We agree.<footnotemark>19</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b96-5\">\u201cThe judicial doctrine of collateral estoppel provides that \u2018[wjhen an issue of fact or law is actually litigated and determined by a valid and final judgment, and the determination is essential to the judgment, the determination is conclusive in a subsequent action between the parties, whether on the same or a different claim.\u2019 \u201d <em>Alba </em>v. <em>Raytheon Co., </em>441 Mass. 836, 841 (2004), quoting from <em>Martin </em>v. <em>Ring, </em>401 Mass. 59, 61 (1987). \u201cThe doctrine may be applied with respect to administrative agency determinations so long as the tribunal rendering judgment has the legal authority to adjudicate the dispute.\u201d <em>Alba </em>v. <em>Raytheon Co., supra. </em>\u201cThe guiding principle in determining whether to allow defensive use of collateral estoppel is whether the party against whom it is asserted \u2018lacked full and fair opportunity to litigate the issue in the first action or [whether] other circumstances justify affording him an opportunity to relitigate the issue.\u2019 \u201d <em>Martin </em>v. <em>Ring, supra </em>at 62, quoting from <em>Fidler </em>v. <em>E.M. Parker Co., </em>394 Mass. 534, 541 (1985).</p>\n<p id=\"b96-6\">It is well established that \u201c[a] party is precluded from relitigating an issue when:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b96-7\">(1) there was a final judgment on the merits in [a] prior adjudication; (2) the party against whom estoppel is asserted was a party (or in privity with a party) to the prior adjudication; (3) the issue in the prior adjudication is identical to the issue in the current litigation; and (4) the issue decided in the prior adjudication was essential to the earlier judgment.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b96-8\"><em>Porio </em>v. <em>Department of Rev., </em>80 Mass. App. Ct. 57, 61-62 (2011), quoting from <em>Green </em>v. <em>Brookline, </em>53 Mass. App. Ct. 120, 123 (2001).</p>\n<p id=\"b97-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"57\">*57</page-number>The first two factors are easily met. First, the administrative tribunals determined, on the merits, the propriety of PERAC\u2019s refusal to seek a second clarification from the medical panel at the city\u2019s request. This review required the tribunals to assess whether the first and second medical panels had relied on erroneous or incomplete information in arriving at their conclusions concerning McLaughlin\u2019s ability to perform the essential duties of a captain, because, in order for the medical panel to properly perform its function, it must fully comprehend the duties of the position to which the retiree is seeking reinstatement. McLaughlin\u2019s contention that the administrative decisions addressed a limited procedural matter, therefore, misses the mark. Furthermore, this decision became final when McLaughlin failed to perfect his appeal of GRAB\u2019S determination pursuant to G. L. c. 30A, \u00a7 14.<footnotemark>20</footnotemark> See, e.g., <em>Alba </em>v. <em>Raytheon Co., supra </em>at 838. Second, despite his urgings to the contrary, McLaughlin was a party in the prior case. McLaughlin, pro se, intervened and testified in the DALA proceeding. See <em>Frostar Corp. </em>v. <em>Malloy, </em>77 Mass. App. Ct. 705, 713 (2010) (noting that \u201can intervener may litigate fully\u201d and that \u201cthe interven[e]r is treated as if the interven[e]r were an original party\u201d [citations omitted]). Additionally, McLaughlin, by his attorneys, submitted written objections to CRAB.<footnotemark>21</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b97-5\">We must next \u201cconsider whether the findings made by [CRAB] <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"58\">*58</page-number>were identical to the issues raised in the Superior Court, and if so, whether those findings were essential, or treated as essential, to [CRAB\u2019s] order.\u201d <em>Alba </em>v. <em>Raytheon Co., </em>441 Mass, at 842. The DALA magistrate made a subsidiary finding, adopted by CRAB, that the LFD strictly prohibits the use of inhalers at a fire scene in support of her decision that the first and second medical panels relied on erroneous information in determining McLaughlin\u2019s ability to perform essential duties of a captain, thus justifying the city\u2019s request for further clarification. See <em>Green </em>v. <em>Brookline, </em>53 Mass. App. Ct. at 125-126 (subsidiary findings given preclusive effect). In the Superior Court, McLaughlin alleged that the LFD does not prohibit the use of inhalers and on appeal, he contends that he properly disputed the existence of that very rule, thereby rendering the trial judge\u2019s grant of summary judgment in favor of the city erroneous. For the purposes of preclusion, the issue resolved by the DALA magistrate and CRAB is identical to the issue raised by McLaughlin in the Superior Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b98-5\">Last, whether the LFD prohibited the use of an inhaler at the fire scene was essential to the findings of the DALA magistrate and CRAB, who considered numerous exhibits and heard the testimony of both Desrosiers and McLaughlin. See <em>Supeno </em>v. <em>Equity Office Properties Mgmt., LLC, </em>70 Mass. App. Ct. 470, 474-475 (2007). Without first assessing the existence of the LFD\u2019s purported rule, the administrative tribunals could not ascertain whether the first and second medical panels had relied on erroneous information in arriving at their conclusions and ultimately, whether remand to the medical panel was necessary. CRAB ordered PERAC to request clarification from the medical panel as to whether the fact that the city strictly prohibits <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"59\">*59</page-number>the use of an inhaler at a fire scene changes its opinion as to McLaughlin\u2019s ability to perform the essential duties of his position. That order reflects that CRAB\u2019s findings with respect to that prohibition were \u201cthe product of full litigation and careful decision,\u201d <em>Green </em>v. <em>Brookline, supra </em>at 126-127, quoting from <em>Commissioner of the Dept. of Employment &amp; Training </em>v. <em>Dugan, </em>428 Mass. 138, 144 (1998), and, therefore, should be treated as essential to CRAB\u2019s ultimate determination. <em>Alba </em>v. <em>Raytheon Co., supra </em>at 844. Contrast <em>Porio </em>v. <em>Department of Rev., </em>80 Mass. App. Ct. at 62 (plaintiff, who had been discharged by the department due to alleged budgetary concerns, was not precluded from pursuing age discrimination claim based on prior civil service appeal where the first action turned on job titles and seniority rights, the resolution of which concerned neither the legitimacy nor the motives underlying the department\u2019s cited concerns at issue in the subsequent action).</p>\n<p id=\"b99-5\">Here, all of the elements for applying collateral estoppel were met, and as such, a genuine issue of material fact did not exist with respect to the LFD\u2019s procedure. Dr. Kaplan hence based his decision on valid information concerning the essential duties of a captain, and the third medical panel did not unanimously opine that McLaughlin was able to perform the essential duties of a captain. Therefore, as matter of law, McLaughlin was not entitled to reinstatement. For the aforementioned reasons, the trial judge properly granted summary judgment for the city.<footnotemark>22</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b99-6\">b. <em>Discrimination claims. </em>Following a seven-day trial, the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"60\">*60</page-number>jury returned a verdict in favor of McLaughlin on two separate theories of employment discrimination \u2014\u25a0 discrimination on the basis of handicap, G. L. c. 151B, \u00a7 4(16), and interference with his protected rights, G. L. c. 151B, \u00a7 4(4A). The city\u2019s arguments on appeal are numerous, including that the Superior Court lacked jurisdiction over McLaughlin\u2019s discrimination claims for failure to exhaust the administrative process,<footnotemark>23</footnotemark> that the court erroneously allowed McLaughlin to relitigate matters decided before DALA and CRAB, and that McLaughlin failed to prove both a prima facie case of handicap discrimination and a claim of interference.</p>\n<p id=\"b101-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"61\">*61</page-number>Following the jury verdict in McLaughlin\u2019s favor, the city moved, inter alia, for judgment notwithstanding the verdict, Mass.R.Civ.P. 50(b), as amended, 428 Mass. 1402 (1998). In denying the City\u2019s motion for judgment notwithstanding the verdict, the trial judge stated, in relevant part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b101-5\">\u201cThe jury reasonably could have found that the [city] discriminated against [McLaughlin] by fabricating a rule prohibiting the use of inhalers in order to thwart [McLaughlin\u2019s] efforts to resume his prior position of fire captain in the Lowell Fire Department. Although the [city] articulated a legitimate, nondiscriminatory basis for its stated policy against inhalers, the jury was not compelled to accept the [city\u2019s] justification. It would be inappropriate for this court to supplant its own judgment for that of the jury\u2019s on this factual determination.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b101-6\">\u201cThis court has also rejected the [city\u2019s] argument that [McLaughlin] is not a qualified handicapped person as a matter of law in light of his failure to be reinstated by a unanimous medical panel. . . . Although the regional medical panel determines the plaintiff\u2019s ability to perform the essential duties of his position for purposes of reinstatement under G. L. c. 32, \u00a7 8, the failure to gain the unanimous approval of the panel does not foreclose discrimination claims based on conduct in connection with the reinstatement process. . . . Liability in this case is not grounded on an alleged failure to reinstate [McLaughlin], but rather on the [city\u2019s] creation of a rule against inhalers in order to undermine [McLaughlin\u2019s] ability to be reinstated.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b101-7\">While we do not lightly vacate a jury\u2019s verdict, we are compelled to conclude that the denial of the city\u2019s motion for judgment notwithstanding the verdict on both counts was error.<footnotemark>24</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b102-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"62\">*62</page-number>i. <em>Standard of review. </em>Review of the denial of a motion for judgment notwithstanding the verdict requires that we determine whether \u201canywhere in the evidence, from whatever source derived, any combination of circumstances could be found from which a reasonable inference could be drawn in favor of the plaintiff.\u201d <em>Raunela </em>v. <em>Hertz Corp., </em>361 Mass. 341, 343 (1972), quoting from <em>Kelly </em>v. <em>Railway Exp. Agency, Inc., </em>315 Mass. 301, 302 (1943). The city asserts that since the third medical panel did not unanimously opine that McLaughlin can perform the essential functions of his former job, he is not a \u201cqualified handicapped person\u201d under G. L. c. 151B, \u00a7 1(16), inserted by St. 1983, c. 533, \u00a7 2. We agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b102-5\">ii. <em>Handicap discrimination. </em>General Laws c. 15IB, \u00a7 4(16), states in material part that it is an unlawful practice \u201c[f]or any employer . . . to . . . refuse to hire, rehire or advance in employment or otherwise discriminate against, because of his handicap, any person alleging to be a qualified handicapped person, capable of performing the essential functions of the position involved with reasonable accommodation.\u201d The statute defines a \u201cqualified handicapped person\u201d as \u201ca handicapped person who is capable of performing the essential functions of a particular job, or who would be capable of performing the essential functions of a particular job with reasonable accommodation to his handicap.\u201d G. L. c. 151B, \u00a7 1(16).</p>\n<p id=\"b102-6\">The present discrimination claim is one of alleged \u201cdisparate treatment.\u201d See <em>School Comm. of Braintree </em>v. <em>Massachusetts Commn. Against Discrimination, </em>377 Mass. 424,428-429 (1979). \u201cA disparate treatment case is one in which the employer <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"63\">*63</page-number>\u2018purposefully uses\u2019 the protected status in making its employment decisions.\u201d <em>Porio </em>v. <em>Department of Rev., </em>80 Mass. App. Ct. at 61, quoting from <em>School Comm, of Braintree </em>v. <em>Massachusetts Commn. Against Discrimination, supra </em>at 428. McLaughlin avers that the city falsely created and asserted the departmental prohibition against the use of inhalers for the purpose of, or with the intended effect of, interfering with his attempt to seek reinstatement. \u201cWe have recognized a distinction between employment discrimination cases where the plaintiff alleges \u2018disparate treatment\u2019 and those cases involving a claim of \u2018disparate impact.\u2019 \u201d <em>Whalen </em>v. <em>NYNEX Info. Resources Co., </em>419 Mass. 792, 795 (1995). See <em>Smith College </em>v. <em>Massachusetts Commn. Against Discrimination, </em>376 Mass. 221, 227 (1978); <em>Cox </em>v. <em>New England Tel. &amp; Tel. Co., </em>414 Mass. 375, 384 (1993).</p>\n<p id=\"b103-5\">A claim of \u201cdisparate treatment\u201d requires a three-stage order of proof. <em>Labonte </em>v. <em>Hutchins &amp; Wheeler, </em>424 Mass. 813, 821 (1997), citing <em>McDonnell Douglas Corp. </em>v. <em>Green, </em>411 U.S. 792, 802 (1973). For recent articulations of the standard by the Supreme Judicial Court, see <em>Matthews </em>v. <em>Ocean Spray Cranberries, Inc., </em>426 Mass. 122, 127-128 (1997); <em>Abramian </em>v. <em>President &amp; Fellows of Harvard College, </em>432 Mass. 107, 116-118 (2000); <em>Knight </em>v. <em>Avon Prods., Inc., </em>438 Mass. 413, 420 n.4 (2003); <em>Sullivan </em>v. <em>Liberty Mut. Ins. Co., </em>444 Mass. 34, 39-40 (2005); and <em>Somers </em>v. <em>Converged Access, Inc., </em>454 Mass. 582, 594-595 (2009). First, the plaintiff bears the burden to show, by a preponderance of the evidence, a prima facie case of handicap discrimination. <em>Labonte </em>v. <em>Hutchins &amp; Wheeler, supra. </em>\u201cOnce a prima facie case is made, the burden [of production] shifts to [the employer] to offer a legitimate nondiscriminatory reason for its action.\u201d <em>Ibid. </em>\u201cIn the event that occurs, ... the burden then shifts back to the plaintiff to establish that the reason offered by the employer is not the real reason, but is in fact a pretext.\u201d <em>Boston </em>v. <em>Massachusetts Commn. Against Discrimination, </em>47 Mass. App. Ct. 816, 821 (1999). \u201cAt the third stage the employee must show that the basis of the employer\u2019s decision was unlawful discrimination.\u201d <em>Abramian </em>v. <em>President &amp; Fellows of Harvard College, supra </em>at 117. \u201cEvidence that the employer\u2019s reasons are untrue gives rise, therefore, to an inference that the plaintiff was a victim of unlawful discrimination . . . [but] <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"64\">*64</page-number>[t]he employer may counter the effect of this evidence by showing that, even if his articulated reason for the adverse action is untrue, he had no discriminatory intent, or that his action was based on a different, nondiscriminatory reason.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 118.</p>\n<p id=\"b104-5\">Here, McLaughlin failed in the first instance to establish a prima facie case of handicap discrimination. Because McLaughlin failed to demonstrate that he was a \u201cqualified handicapped person\u201d pursuant to G. L. c. 151B, \u00a7 1(16), the city\u2019s burden of articulating a legitimate, nondiscriminatory reason for its actions was never triggered, thus ending the inquiry. See <em>Beal </em>v. <em>Selectmen of Hingham, </em>419 Mass. 535, 545 n.6 (1995). As such, the trial judge erred in concluding that despite the city\u2019s articulated, nondiscriminatory reason for its actions, the jury, nevertheless, \u201ccould have found that the [city] discriminated against [McLaughlin] by fabricating a rule prohibiting the use of inhalers in order to thwart the plaintiff\u2019s efforts to resume his prior position of fire captain in the Lowell Fire Department.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b104-6\">To establish a prima facie case of employment discrimination on the basis of handicap, McLaughlin must produce some evidence that he (1) \u201cis \u2018handicapped\u2019 within the meaning of the statute\u201d; (2) \u201cis a \u2018qualified handicapped person\u2019 capable of performing the essential functions of his job either without accommodation or with a reasonable accommodation\u201d; and (3) \u201cwas subject to an adverse employment action because of his handicap.\u201d <em>Godfrey </em>v. <em>Globe Newspaper Co., </em>457 Mass. 113, 120 (2010). See <em>Whalen </em>v. <em>NYNEX Info. Resources Co., supra </em>at 796. On appeal, the city does not dispute that McLaughlin is \u201chandicapped\u201d within the meaning of the statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b104-7\">McLaughlin\u2019s first challenge in establishing his prima facie case was to demonstrate that he was qualified to perform the essential functions of his job, a matter on which two statutes bear. See <em>Carleton </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>447 Mass. 791, 807-810 (2006); <em>Everett </em>v. <em>357 Corp., </em>453 Mass. 585, 610 (2009). McLaughlin contends that an adverse determination of his qualification under G. L. c. 32, \u00a7 8, does not foreclose his action under G. L. c. 151B and, as such, the jury properly found him to be capable of performing the essential functions of a captain. We disagree, and instead conclude that McLaughlin had no reasonable expectation of proving that he was capable of performing <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"65\">*65</page-number>the essential functions of a captain after the third medical panel, upon further reconsideration, validly determined otherwise.</p>\n<p id=\"b105-5\">\u201cWhere two statutes relate to the same subject matter and are not irreconcilable, \u2018they should be construed together so as to constitute a harmonious whole consistent with the legislative purpose.\u2019 \u201d <em>Carleton </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, supra </em>at 809, quoting from <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Spearin, </em>446 Mass. 599, 604 (2006). As previously discussed, G. L. c. 32, \u00a7 8, governs a disability retiree\u2019s restoration to service, and, \u201cas amended through St. 1996, c. 306, \u00a7 16, requires reinstatement of a retiree determined by a regional medical panel to be qualified for and physically able to perform the essential duties of the position from which he retired.\u201d <em>Pulsone </em>v. <em>Public Employee Retirement Admin. Commn., </em>60 Mass. App. Ct. 791, 793 (2004). The 1996 statutory amendments removed the discretionary authority of the appointing authority \u2014 here, the city \u2014 to approve or reject the reinstatement of a disability retiree notwithstanding that the retiree had been cleared by a medical panel and a vacancy existed. <em>White </em>v. <em>Boston, </em>428 Mass. 250, 252 (1998). As <em>Pulsone </em>v. <em>Public Employee Retirement Admin. Commn., supra, </em>stated: \u201c[t]he legislative purpose of [these] amendments was to require disability retirees who are capable of returning to work to do so.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b105-19\">In prohibiting the appointing authority from interposing itself as the final arbiter of a disability retiree\u2019s right to restoration, the Legislature accordingly vested in the regional medical panel the exclusive authority to determine whether a disability retiree is qualified for and able to perform a position\u2019s essential duties. Additionally, in 2000, PERAC amended 840 Code Mass. Regs. \u00a7 10.13(2) to require that the regional medical panel\u2019s determination be unanimous, and this amendment has been held a valid exercise of PERAC\u2019s rulemaking authority contained in G. L. c. 7, \u00a7 50(a).<footnotemark>25</footnotemark> <em>Id. </em>at 796-798. \u201c[E]ven though [G. L. c. 32, \u00a7 8] standing alone does not express a \u2018manifest intent\u2019 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"66\">*66</page-number>to require unanimous action by regional medical panels . . . , the Legislature\u2019s subsequent approval of PERAC\u2019s regulations imposing such a requirement sufficed to endorse PERAC\u2019s exercise of its rulemaking authority as being in harmony with the statute.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 797. See <em>MRI Assocs., Inc. </em>v. <em>Department of Pub. Health, </em>70 Mass. App. Ct. 337, 342 n.8 (2007). With respect to G. L. c. 151B, \u00a7 4(16), the underlying public policies \u201care clear: to protect \u2018handicapped individuals from deprivations based on prejudice, stereotypes, or unfounded fear, while giving appropriate weight to such legitimate concerns of [employers] as avoiding exposing others to significant health and safety risks.\u2019 \u201d <em>Carleton </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>447 Mass, at 808, quoting from <em>Dahill </em>v. <em>Police Dept. of Boston, </em>434 Mass. 233, 240 (2001). Furthermore, the antidiscrimination statute expressly permits an employer to \u201ccondition an offer of employment on the results of a medical examination conducted solely for the purpose of determining whether the employee, with reasonable accommodation, is capable of performing the essential functions of the job.\u201d G. L. c. 151B, \u00a7 4(16). That G. L. c. 32, \u00a7 8, together with tire corresponding regulations ratified by the Legislature, compels reinstatement of a disability retiree only upon unanimous approval by the regional medical panel is \u201cconsistent with and promote[s] the Legislature\u2019s purposes and policies of protecting handicapped individuals from deprivations based on prejudice . . . while giving appropriate weight to . . . avoiding exposing others to significant health and safety risks.\u201d <em>Carleton </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, supra </em>at 810 (quotation omitted). We accordingly find no irreconcilable difference between G. L. c. 32, \u00a7 8, and G. L. c. 151B, \u00a7 4(16).<footnotemark>26</footnotemark> See <em>id. </em>at 809.</p>\n<p id=\"b106-9\">Furthermore, G. L. c. 151B, \u00a7 4(16), does not necessarily <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"67\">*67</page-number>require that a judge or a jury make a determination essential to a plaintiff\u2019s prima facie case where, as here, a deliberate statutory scheme of civil service law expressly resolves itself to such a determination. In <em>Carleton </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, supra, </em>standards promulgated by the division of human resources at the direction of the Legislature prohibited a municipal fire fighter candidate from using a nonimplantable hearing aid, the precise accommodation sought by the plaintiff, to meet hearing requirements necessary to the performance of the job\u2019s essential functions. <em>Id. </em>at 806. The Supreme Judicial Court held that a candidate unable to meet health and fitness requirements by operation of a standard which rendered a certain accommodation unreasonable had no expectation of proving that he was a qualified handicapped person within the meaning of the antidiscrimination statute. <em>Id. </em>at 810.</p>\n<p id=\"b107-9\">In other words, in <em>Carleton </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, supra, </em>a standard was issued pursuant to civil service law which bore directly on the reasonableness of a requested accommodation under G. L. c. 151B, \u00a7 4(16); although that determination ultimately implicated the plaintiff\u2019s expectation of proving that he was a qualified handicapped person within the context of his antidiscrimination claim, the court concluded that such a determination was not subject to review, particularly because it was \u201cbased on consultations with medical and occupational experts in the field; [was] not the product of prejudice, stereotypes, or unfounded fear; and [was] ratified by the Legislature.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 809-810. The civil service directives at issue here, promulgated both by the Legislature itself and PERAC at the Legislature\u2019s direction, bear directly on a determination of a disability retiree\u2019s capability to perform essential job functions. By the same logic, therefore, G. L. c. 151B, \u00a7 4(16), does not preclude the determination by the third medical panel in this instance.<footnotemark>27</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b107-21\">The Supreme Judicial Court\u2019s analysis in another recent case, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"68\">*68</page-number><em>Everett </em>v. <em>357 Corp., </em>453 Mass. 585, further informs our interpretation, although that case stands on slightly different procedural footing. There, the court concluded that the plaintiff, a former commercial truck driver seeking reinstatement following his discharge from a psychiatric hospital, did not meet his burden of demonstrating that he was a qualified handicapped person within the meaning of G. L. c. 151B because he did not comply with Federal Department of Transportation (DOT) regulations requiring a commercial truck driver to have a certificate, based on a medical examination, attesting to his physical and mental fitness to drive. <em>Id. </em>at 589 &amp; n.8, 610 &amp; n.33. The doctor\u2019s conclusion that he was not \u201chealthy to drive\u201d rendered him presumptively unqualified, a status which he failed to properly appeal to the DOT. <em>Id. </em>at 610. \u201cThe question of his qualifications for his job \u2014 a dispositive prong of his prima facie case \u2014 was not for the jury, or for the judge, but for the DOT, subject to review by the United States Court of Appeals.\u201d <em>Ibid. </em>The plaintiff\u2019s recourse in the face of the employer\u2019s alleged discrimination, therefore, lay with the administrative process, effectively precluding the plaintiff from litigating the propriety of the employer\u2019s reliance on the doctor\u2019s recommendation, <em>id. </em>at 609 (\u201cBecause DOT had exclusive authority over the qualification issue ... the judge was required to refer the issue to the agency\u201d), and irrationally allowing the jury to \u201cserve as the ultimate arbiter[] of the meaning and application <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"69\">*69</page-number>of DOT regulations.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 611, quoting from <em>Campbell </em>v. <em>Federal Express Corp., </em>918 F. Supp. 912, 919 (D. Md. 1996).</p>\n<p id=\"b109-5\">On the facts before us, there is no dispute that McLaughlin followed proper procedure in challenging the propriety of the third medical panel\u2019s determination under G. L. c. 32. See <em>Sullivan </em>v. <em>Brookline, </em>435 Mass, at 355 n.l (\u201cNeither G. L. c. 32, \u00a7 8 [2], nor \u00a7 16, provides administrative appeal from a regional medical panel\u2019s decision. The plaintiff was, therefore not subject to any exhaustion requirement [before bringing his complaint in Superior Court]\u201d). Similar to the plaintiff in <em>Everett </em>v. <em>357 Corp., supra, </em>however, McLaughlin was improperly permitted to litigate an issue \u2014 his qualification to perform essential job duties \u2014 based on facts that were not then subject to review.<footnotemark>28</footnotemark> Here, McLaughlin failed to obtain the requisite approval for reinstatement under G. L. c. 32, \u00a7 8(2). As previously discussed, the third medical panel did not unanimously opine that McLaughlin was capable of performing the essential functions of his job. The basis of that decision rested on the existence of a departmental prohibition against the use of inhalers, deemed valid following administrative review by both DALA and CRAB.<footnotemark>29</footnotemark> McLaughlin argues that the existence of this departmental prohibition \u2014 the fact to be given preclusive effect \u2014 is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"70\">*70</page-number>fundamentally different from his allegation that the city falsely asserted that prohibition for the purpose of, or with the intended effect of, interfering with his attempt to seek reinstatement. McLaughlin\u2019s view overly narrows the preclusive effect of DALA\u2019s and GRAB\u2019S determinations, however. What DALA and CRAB determined was that knowledge by the medical panel of the existence of the departmental prohibition was a factor critical to its ultimate determination. Simply put, the administrative proceedings concerned the full extent of information bearing on McLaughlin\u2019s ability to perform his essential duties. The validity of the prohibition was an issue fully and finally litigated before two different tribunals, from which no appeal was perfected. To the extent that McLaughlin contends that the city falsely asserted this prohibition, his remedy rested with the administrative appeal process afforded him pursuant to G. L. c. 30A, \u00a7 14.</p>\n<p id=\"b110-4\">Therefore, it was error to admit evidence tending to demonstrate that McLaughlin nevertheless met the definition of a qualified handicapped person within the meaning of the antidiscrimination statute. In this instance, absent other allegations indicative of impropriety, the third medical panel\u2019s determination under G. L. c. 32, \u00a7 8, constituted conclusive evidence of McLaughlin\u2019s status as an unqualified handicapped person for the purposes of G. L. c. 151B, \u00a7 4(16). Moreover, we are aware of no situation in which a judge or a jury may <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"71\">*71</page-number>properly substitute its decision for one within the authority of the regional medical panel under G. L. c. 32, \u00a7 8. See, e.g., <em>Ferraro </em>v. <em>Contributory Retirement Appeal Bd., </em>57 Mass. App. Ct. 728, 730, 731 (2003) (\u201c[w]hen a negative certificate of a medical panel member is deficient because an incorrect legal standard has been applied by a physician . . . [t]he appropriate remedy is a remand directing CRAB to submit the matter to a new regional medical panel\u201d). As such, here, the jury impermissibly \u201cserve[d] as the ultimate arbiters of the meaning and application of [PERAC regulations].\u201d <em>Everett </em>v. <em>357 Corp., supra </em>at 611 (quotation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b111-5\">Based on the above, the statutory scheme governing the reinstatement to service of a disability retiree operates to replace the fact-finding function of either judge or jury specifically with respect to whether the disability retiree is a qualified handicapped person under the antidiscrimination statute, a determination by which the court is bound where the facts underlying that determination are not subject to review. We conclude, therefore, that McLaughlin had no reasonable expectation of proving a prima facie case for handicap discrimination, namely, that he is \u201cqualified handicapped person\u201d within the meaning of G. L. c. 151B, \u00a7 1(16), and as such, the judge erred in denying the city\u2019s motion for judgment notwithstanding the verdict.<footnotemark>30</footnotemark>\u2019<footnotemark>31</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b111-6\">iii. <em>Interference. </em>General Laws c. 151B, \u00a7 4(4A), inserted by <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"72\">*72</page-number>St. 1989, c. 722, \u00a7 14, states, as here relevant: \u201c[i]t shall be an unlawful practice . . . [f]or any person to coerce, intimidate, threaten, or interfere with another person in the exercise or enjoyment of any right granted or protected by this chapter.\u201d There is no question that G. L. c. 15IB, \u00a7 4(4A), prohibits interference with an employee\u2019s right to work in an environment free of unlawful handicap discrimination. Where, on the present facts, action does not lie against the city under G. L. c. 151B, \u00a7 4(16), we conclude that the same conduct cannot impose liability on the city under G. L. c. 15IB, \u00a7 4(4A).<footnotemark>32</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b112-5\">The complaint alleged, and the jury found, that the city\u2019s conduct constituted discriminatory interference with McLaughlin\u2019s protected rights in violation of G. L. c. 151B, \u00a7 4(4A). At trial, McLaughlin represented that the interference consisted of the city\u2019s creation and/or assertion of the purported departmental prohibition on inhalers. On appeal, the city correctly contends that the evidence failed to prove interference, albeit for reasons less nuanced than those which we announce today.<footnotemark>33</footnotemark> We accordingly hold that the trial judge erred in denying the city\u2019s motion for judgment notwithstanding the verdict on this count.</p>\n<p id=\"b113-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"73\">*73</page-number>We are not aware of any case in which a Massachusetts court has addressed squarely the issue whether an employer may be held liable for interfering with an employee\u2019s protected right in the absence of unlawful discrimination. The challenges more readily confronted by courts in applying G. L. c. 15IB, \u00a7 4(4A), have instead related to the contours of the underlying relationship between the parties and the effects thereof. See <em>Lopez </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>463 Mass. 696, 706 (2012) (defendant \u201cneed not be an employer to be subject to an interference claim under \u00a7 4[4A]\u201d); <em>Thomas O\u2019Connor Constructors, Inc. </em>v. <em>Massachusetts Commn. Against Discrimination, </em>72 Mass. App. Ct. 549, 554-560 (2008) (employee of a subcontractor permitted to sue general contractor). We conclude that the broad language of G. L. c. 15IB, \u00a7 4(4A), easily reaches the employment relationship between McLaughlin and the city.</p>\n<p id=\"b113-5\">Of importance here, the Supreme Judicial Court has recognized that as the term is used in G.

At the very least then, interference with a plaintiff\u2019s right to be free from discrimination must be intentional. <em>Id. </em>at 709. In <em>Lopez </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, supra </em>at 711, the plaintiffs, minority police officers employed by various municipalities not named as defendants in the action, alleged that the Commonwealth and the division of human resources knowingly created and administered a Statewide multiple-choice examination which disproportionately disadvantaged minority candidates seeking promotions. The court rejected the defendants\u2019 contention that the term \u201cinterfere\u201d encompassed only acts specifically undertaken with the intent to deprive the plaintiffs a protected right, and in doing so, recognized that in cases of alleged disparate impact, \u201cthe element of intentionality is satisfied where it is shown that a defendant knowingly interfered with the plaintiffs\u2019 right to be free from discrimination.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 710-711.</p>\n<p id=\"b113-6\">For the purposes of G. L. c. 151B, \u00a7 4(4A), the Supreme Judicial Court determined that proof of discrimination premised on a theory of disparate impact may properly support a prima facie claim of interference. <em>Ibid. </em>(\u201cWe decide today that, like a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"74\">*74</page-number>claim under [G. L. c. 151B,] \u00a7 4(1), ... an interference claim under \u00a7 4(4A) may be established by evidence of disparate impact\u201d). Hence, implicit in the court\u2019s holding is the need for actionable discriminatory conduct, irrespective of the theory of discrimination on which that conduct is based. Absent actionable discriminatory conduct, there exists no basis on which to ground a claim of interference. Applying this principle here, therefore, McLaughlin\u2019s failure to demonstrate that the city subjected him to unlawful discrimination on the basis of his handicap effectively precludes him from proving that the city interfered with his protected rights under G. L. c. 151B.<footnotemark>34</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b114-5\">4. <em>Conclusion. </em>Consequently, for the reasons discussed above, we affirm the allowance of the city\u2019s motion for summary judgment, and reverse the denial of the city\u2019s motion for judgment notwithstanding the verdict.</p>\n<p id=\"b114-6\">\n<em>So ordered.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b86-10\">McLaughlin sought damages and injunctive relief in the Superior Court against the city and Lowell fire Chief William Desrosiers, alleging (1) violations of G.

Given these facts and the implications for the safety of the public generally, for other firefighters working with Mr. McLaughlin and for Mr. McLaughlin himself, of the determination as to whether Mr. McLaughlin is able to perform safely the essential duties of his position, it was arbitrary and capricious for PERAC to refuse [to] provide this information to the medical panel and to determine whether the information would affect the Panel\u2019s determination of Mr. McLaughlin\u2019s ability to perform the essential duties of his position.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"10\">\n<p id=\"b89-8\">A vacancy \u2014 apparently the first since January 4, 2002 \u2014 occurred on or about June 11, 2004, and was filled by another LFD employee, effective June 27, 2004.

Under sections 9(40) and 9(40A) of the [LFD] Rules and Regulations, and as a practical matter, firefighters must respond to the fire wearing appropriate gear, including having \u2018masks in proper position to enable them to immediately enter any smoke filled area.\u2019 Whether explicitly prohibited or not, a firefighter would have grave difficulty using an inhaler when surrounded by smoke. It would also be a challenge for a firefighter to attempt to escape a smokey [sic] area while in the midst of an asthma attack and, to the extent such firefighter would require assistance, it would divert much needed resources away from fire suppression efforts. Additionally, Lowell firefighters are generally prohibited from leaving the fire scene (see \u00a7 9[20]), which, depending on the nature of the fire, might also make it difficult for a firefighter to escape the smoke in order to use an inhaler. Under these circumstances, it is the firefighter\u2019s fitness to engage in fire suppression activities, rather than the use of the inhaler itself, that bears on the firefighter\u2019s ability to perform the essential duties of the position.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"13\">\n<p id=\"b90-7\">McLaughlin does not appeal from the entry of summary judgment with respect to the city\u2019s alleged unlawful retraining program, which required yet another medical evaluation as a condition of McLaughlin\u2019s reinstatement; this claim was rendered moot by the fact that McLaughlin did not first establish a right to reinstatement.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"14\">\n<p id=\"b92-7\">TitIe 840 Code Mass.

Although the issue is not properly before us, we note that while 840 Code Mass. Regs. \u00a7 10.11(2) entitles the LRB to request further clarification from the medical panel, it does not appear that the city is entitled to do the same. However, as discussed <em>infra, </em>McLaughlin did not seek judicial review within thirty days after his receipt of notice of CRAB\u2019s March 31, 2004, decision ordering PERAC to seek further clarification from the medical panel, as requested by the city.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"16\">\n<p id=\"b94-7\">In her written decision, the DALA magistrate found as follows, based on Desrosiers\u2019s testimony: \u201cPursuant to standard operating practice of the [LFD], the use of inhalers at a fire scene is strictly prohibited.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"17\">\n<p id=\"b94-8\">As noted by the dismissal judge, McLaughlin \u201c[was] not appealing CRAB\u2019s decision, nor a decision of a medical panel, but rather the city\u2019s refusal to reinstate him.\u201d When McLaughlin filed his complaint, however, the third medical panel had not yet rendered its decision, and accordingly, the city\u2019s purported reason for refusing to reinstate McLaughlin was, at that time, nonexistent.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"18\">\n<p id=\"b95-12\">The dismissal judge also denied the city\u2019s motion to dismiss the amended complaint, stating:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b95-13\">\u201cWhen McLaughlin filed his original complaint, the third Regional Medical Panel had not yet rendered its decision.

However, where the order gives the subordinate agency no discretion, but instead requires that it resolve the matter in the manner specified, the order is final and appealable.

See, e.g., <em>Treglia </em>v. <em>MacDonald, </em>430 Mass. 237, 241 (1999). An issue has been actually litigated in a prior action where \u201cthe issue was subject to an adversary presentation and consequent judgment that was not a product of the parties\u2019 consent.\u201d <em>Jarosz </em>v. <em>Palmer, </em>436 Mass. 526, 531 (2002) (quotations omitted). It does not require an evidentiary hearing or a trial; an issue may be considered to be actually litigated for <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"58\">*58</page-number>the purposes of collateral estoppel even where it is decided only on documentary submission and arguments of the parties. <em>Ibid. </em>With respect to the issue here, both McLaughlin and Desrosiers testified before DALA. Moreover, McLaughlin submitted written objections to CRAB, challenging two findings of fact made by the DALA magistrate, specifically, that a captain is required to wear a self-contained breathing apparatus while fighting fires, which he is not permitted to remove until proper ventilation of the fire scene has been achieved, and that the use of inhalers at a fire scene is strictly prohibited. CRAB considered the objections lodged, but ultimately determined that the LFD prohibits the use of inhalers at a fire scene. Accordingly, the adversary proceeding afforded McLaughlin is sufficient to constitute actual litigation. <em>Id. </em>at 531-532.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"22\">\n<p id=\"b99-7\">McLaughlin\u2019s contention that the trial judge erred in denying his motion for summary judgment where the medical panel unanimously found him fit to resume employment in December, 2001, and the uncontroverted record established that the city filled not one but two vacant fire captain positions in January, 2002 \u2014 one on January 5 and one on January 27 \u2014 is without merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b99-8\">Here, the LRB\u2019s request for clarification on January 2,2002, is not tantamount to a refusal to reinstate McLaughlin nor an improper exercise of discretionary authority. Contrast <em>White </em>v. <em>Boston, </em>428 Mass. 250, 252-254 (1998); <em>O\u2019Neill </em>v. <em>City Manager of Cambridge, </em>428 Mass. 257, 258-259 (1998). Instead, this court has recognized the general importance of a retirement board\u2019s right to seek supplemental clarification from the medical panel pursuant to 804 Code Mass. Regs. \u00a7 10.11(2), which cannot be exercised until after the medical panel has already rendered its decision. <em>Narducci </em>v. <em>Contributory Retirement Appeal Bd., </em>68 Mass. App. Ct. 127, 132-136 (2007).</p>\n<p id=\"b99-9\">Furthermore, that the city filled two vacancies on January 4, 2002, during the pendency of LRB\u2019s request for clarification does not constitute a violation <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"60\">*60</page-number>of G. L. c. 32, \u00a7 8, entitling McLaughlin to a summary judgment in his favor. Specifically, the city disputed through record evidence that it promoted two employees to captain on January 4, 2002, one with a start date of January 5, 2002, and the other with a start date of January 27, 2002. See note 5, <em>supra. </em>As previously discussed, G. L. c. 32, \u00a7 8(2), compels reinstatement of a retired employee \u201conce properly cleared by the retirement board, and a vacancy exists.\u201d <em>Facella </em>v. <em>Newton, </em>69 Mass. App. Ct. 459, 461 n.2 (2007), quoting from <em>Sullivan </em>v. <em>Brookline, </em>435 Mass, at 354. It was not until January 25, 2002, that the LRB directed the city to reinstate McLaughlin as captain. At that time, no vacancies existed.</p>\n<p id=\"b100-6\">To the extent that McLaughlin challenges the city\u2019s subsequent request for clarification on May 14, 2002, we note that the issue was resolved by DALA and CRAB, no appeal was thereafter perfected, and therefore the claim is not properly before us for review.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"23\">\n<p id=\"b100-7\">Specifically, the city contends that McLaughlin failed to file a predicate complaint with the Massachusetts Commission Against Discrimination (MCAD) prior to filing his complaint in Superior Court, as required by G. L. c. 151B, \u00a7 5. That much is undisputed. McLaughlin filed his original Superior Court complaint on May 24, 2004, his MCAD complaint on June 18, 2004, and his amended Superior Court complaint on February 9, 2006.</p>\n<p id=\"b100-8\">McLaughlin, however, points to G. L. c. 151B, \u00a7 9, inserted by St. 1950, c. 697, \u00a7 9, which permits an aggrieved person to seek temporary injunctive relief in the Superior Court \u201cprior to the filing of a complaint with the [MCAD].\u201d In its reply brief, the city concedes that McLaughlin could seek temporary injunctive relief in the Superior Court prior to filing his complaint with the MCAD; however, the city maintains that nothing in G. L. c. 151B, \u00a7 9, grants McLaughlin the authority to seek any relief other than a temporary injunction prior to filing a complaint. After hearing and argument, a judge denied McLaughlin\u2019s motion for a preliminary injunction on June 4, 2004, and the trial judge denied McLaughlin\u2019s second motion for a temporary restraining order or a preliminary injunction on or about April 27, 2007. As the city\u2019s claims may be more easily resolved on other grounds, we need \u201cnot today decide what subsequent procedural steps are required when a party seeks injunctive relief in the Superior Court prior to filing a complaint with the MCAD.\u201d <em>Lewis </em>v. <em>Area II Homecarefor Senior Citizens, Inc., </em>397 Mass. 761, 762 n.3 (1986).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"24\">\n<p id=\"b101-8\">A copy of the city\u2019s motion for judgment notwithstanding the verdict does not appear in the record appendix. The record is, at best, unclear whether the city reiterated in its motion for judgment notwithstanding the verdict its argument with respect to McLaughlin\u2019s claim of interference.</p>\n<p id=\"b101-9\">We discern that the city argued that no facts existed on which McLaughlin <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"62\">*62</page-number>could prove his claim of interference in its directed verdict motion, Mass.R. Civ.R 50(a), 365 Mass. 814 (1974), which the city renewed at the close of all evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b102-8\">On appeal, McLaughlin does not contend that the argument is unpreserved as a result of the city\u2019s failure to include it in its motion for judgment notwithstanding the verdict, and as such, we are left to infer that it has been properly preserved for appellate review.

See <em>Ladd </em>v. <em>Polidoro, </em>424 Mass. 196, 197-198 (1997) (issue not specified in written motion for directed verdict preserved so long as it had been raised at other points during trial and therefore was adequately brought to the judge\u2019s attention).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"30\">\n<p id=\"b111-7\">Our analysis is further informed, by analogy, to the line of cases applying the doctrine of estoppel to a claim of handicap discrimination based on an apparent contradiction arising out of a plaintiff\u2019s prior application for disability benefits or the plaintiff\u2019s prior acceptance of a worker\u2019s compensation settlement.</p>\n<p id=\"b111-8\">Courts have generally held, most often in light of motions for summary judgment, that \u201ca plaintiff\u2019s prior pursuit, and receipt, of benefits based on an assertion of \u2018total disability\u2019 does not automatically estop her from pursuing a claim of employment discrimination on the basis of disability under G. L. c. 151B, \u00a7 4(16), so long as a disputed issue of fact remains whether the plaintiff is able to perform the \u2018essential functions of the position involved.\u2019 \u201d <em>Russell </em>v. <em>Cooley Dickinson Hosp., Inc., </em>437 Mass, at 452. See <em>Labonte </em>v. <em>Hutchins &amp; Wheeler, </em>424 Mass. at 816; <em>Tompson </em>v. <em>Department of Mental Health, </em>76 Mass. App. Ct. 586, 594 (2010), cert. denied, 132 S. Ct. 512 (2011). Contrast <em>Beal </em>v. <em>Selectmen of Hingham, </em>419 Mass. at 543. Hence, to survive an argument of estoppel in this context, the plaintiff must be able to raise a question of fact by introducing some other evidence with respect to his or her qualification to perform a job\u2019s essential functions. Where, however, the plaintiff\u2019s previous action creates, under the terms of an applicable <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"72\">*72</page-number>statute, a presumption that he or she is unable to work and that presumption cannot be rebutted, the plaintiff is not a \u201cqualified handicapped person\u201d for the purposes of G. L. c. 151B, \u00a7 4(16). <em>Scott </em>v. <em>Encore Images, Inc., </em>80 Mass. App. Ct. 661, 667-668 (2011).</p>\n<p id=\"b112-7\">Therefore, a plaintiff may lose the fight to pursue a discrimination claim either because there exists no disputable issue of fact with respect to his prior claim of disability or because of his inability to rebut a statutory presumption of his inability to return to work. Likewise, McLaughlin lost his fight to pursue his discrimination claim by his failure to receive a unanimous medical panel determination.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"31\">\n<p id=\"b112-8\">Given this result, there is no need to address McLaughlin\u2019s claim that the judge failed to order appropriate relief under the statute, including reinstatement and back pay.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"32\">\n<p id=\"b112-9\">A claim of interference under G. L. c. 15 IB, \u00a7 4(4A), requires an analysis separate and distinct from that used to resolve a claim of retaliation under G. L. c. 151B, \u00a7 4(4). See <em>Lopez </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>463 Mass. 696, 708 (2012). We recognize that a retaliation claim does not depend on the success of the underlying discrimination claim. See <em>Sahli </em>v. <em>Bull HN Info. Sys., Inc., </em>437 Mass. 696, 699-700 n.8 (2002); <em>Smith </em>v. <em>Winter Place LLC, </em>447 Mass. 363, 364 n.4 (2006); <em>King </em>v. <em>Boston, </em>71 Mass. App. Ct. 460, 474 n.12 (2008).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"33\">\n<p id=\"b112-10\">This is not an instance where the city\u2019s brief fails to support an issue with legal authority as mandated by Mass.R.A.P. 16(a)(4), as amended, 367 Mass. 921 (1975). Contrast <em>Cameron </em>v. <em>Carelli, </em>39 Mass. App. Ct. 81, 85 (1995).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"34\">\n<p id=\"b114-7\">Because there is little case law on the application of G. L. c. 151B, \u00a7 4(4A), to a claim of interference, we look to the Massachusetts Commission Against Discrimination for guidance, even though its interpretation of G. L. c. 151B does \u201cnot carry the force of law.\u201d See <em>Mammone </em>v. <em>President &amp; Fellows of Harvard College, </em>446 Mass. 657, 675 (2006), quoting from <em>Cargill </em>v. <em>Harvard Univ., </em>60 Mass. App. Ct. 585, 594 (2004). \u201cBy including \u00a7 4(4A) in c. 151B, the Legislature intended to extend the statute\u2019s reach beyond employer-employee interactions to encompass discriminatory conduct by third parties to which an employee could be subjected.\u201d Massachusetts Commn. Against Discrimination vs. Thomas O\u2019Connor Constructors, MCAD, No. 98-BEM-3762 (Jan. 21, 2005). See <em>Thomas O\u2019Connor Constructors Inc. </em>v. <em>Massachusetts Commn. Against Discrimination, </em>72 Mass. App. Ct. at 556-557. As such, \u00a7 4(4A) is best understood as a device through which an individual falling outside the scope of the definition of \u201cemployer\u201d may otherwise be liable for conduct which the antidiscrimination statute aims to prevent. Additionally, we note that where the MCAD has imposed liability on an individual pursuant to G. L. c. 151B, \u00a7 4(4A), for interfering with the complainant\u2019s right to work free of unlawful handicap discrimination, the complainant first had established by substantial evidence a violation of G. L. c. 151B, \u00a7 4(16). See, e.g., Woodason <em>vs. </em>Norton Sch. Comm., MCAD, No. 98-BEM-624 (Feb. 19, 2003); Bendell <em>vs. </em>Lemax, Inc., MCAD, No. 95-BEM-807 (Mar. 6, 2003); Damon vs. Incre, Inc., MCAD, No. 95-BEM-2594 (July 2, 2003).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
