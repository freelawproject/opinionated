L. c. 265, \u00a7 17.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The charges arose from the theft at knifepoint of four dollars and two packages of cigarettes from a resident of a homeless shelter. In this appeal from his conviction, the defendant\u2019s sole contention is that the judge\u2019s discharge <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"761\">*761</page-number>of a deliberating juror was procedurally defective.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> We agree that the applicable protocols were not followed, and conclude that reversal is required.</p>\n<p id=\"b801-5\"><em>Background. </em>On December 17, 2009, at 12:31 p.m., the jury were sent out to begin their deliberations. After the jurors left the court room, the judge was informed that a court officer had observed a juror taking notes during the charge. The juror in question, no. 31 (Juror 31), was brought into the court room. In response to questioning by the judge, Juror 31 acknowledged that he had taken notes during the judge\u2019s instructions, explaining that he \u201cdidn\u2019t think [he] would actually have the chance to remember much of it, and [he] was trying real hard to stay awake.\u201d He also stated that, although he had not taken notes while witnesses were actually testifying, he had \u201cjot[ted] down a few things\u201d during breaks. He told the judge that he had not shared his notes with the other jurors and that he had never fallen asleep during the trial. He also said that on the first day of trial, the jury had asked one of the court officers whether they could take notes, but that no one had gotten back to them. He stated that they had discussed how they were \u201cgoing to remember all these things and the jargon and all that,\u201d and said that \u201cI guess we want[ed] to do the best job possible].\u201d He assured the judge that he would not have taken notes if he had been told not to do so.</p>\n<p id=\"b801-6\">Juror 31 provided the court with the single sheet of paper that contained his notes. It was marked for identification and reviewed by the judge and the attorneys. The judge observed that the sheet contained some notes about the judge\u2019s instructions, a few notes about the evidence, and a note pertaining to personal business. Counsel for both the defendant and the codefendant expressed their views that the note-taking was innocuous and asked that Juror 31 not be excused.</p>\n<p id=\"b801-7\">The judge then brought in the entire jury and told them that \u201cone of [their] number\u201d had taken notes during the judge\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"762\">*762</page-number>instructions and during the course of some testimony. He asked whether any of them had \u201cdone anything similar, taken any notes at all,\u201d and noted for the record that no one responded in the affirmative. He then asked, \u201c[H]as the individual, and he understands that I\u2019m going to ask this question, has the individual shared with you the contents of any of the notes that he\u2019s taken?\u201d After again noting for the record that no one responded in the affirmative, the judge told the jury to resume deliberations.</p>\n<p id=\"b802-5\">Sometime after 2:00 p.m., the jury sent the judge a note requesting that certain evidence be clarified.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> The judge called them into the court room and instructed them that their memory governed. At about 3:50 p.m., the jury sent the judge another note stating, \u201cWe the jury have not been able to come to a unanimous decision.\u201d The judge spoke with counsel and told them that the deliberations had not gone on long enough to warrant a <em>\u201cRodriquez </em>charge.\u201d<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> After discussing whether to let the jury continue to deliberate for a short time or send them home for the day, the judge brought in the jury and told them that, in view of the hour, he would not keep them any longer, and they would resume deliberations the following morning.</p>\n<p id=\"b802-6\">When the jury reconvened the next day, the judge asked whether anyone had any problems or concerns about continuing deliberations. No one responded, and they were sent out to deliberate. Less than an hour later, the jury asked a question, \u201cCan we be reminded of the four components of the law we are to apply and how those are to weigh on the verdict?\u201d With counsels\u2019 agreement, the judge reinstructed the jury on the four elements of armed robbery and reminded them that they must return a verdict of not guilty if the Commonwealth had not proven each element beyond a reasonable doubt. The jury resumed deliberations at 10:35 a.m.</p>\n<p id=\"b802-7\">At 11:30 a.m., the jury sent out another note, \u201cWe have a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"763\">*763</page-number>juror who does not feel comfortable continuing deliberations [due] to emotional distress.\u201d The juror in question was Juror 31. He was brought into the court room, and the judge made inquiry as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b803-5\">The court: \u201cMr. [Juror 31]?\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b803-6\">The juror: \u201cIt is me again.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b803-7\">The court: \u201cOne moment. All right, Mr. [Juror 31], I received a note from your foreperson.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b803-8\">The juror: \u201cCorrect.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b803-9\">The court: \u201cAnd let me tell you what he represented to me, quote, \u2018We have a juror who does not feel comfortable continuing with deliberations due to emotional distress.\u2019 \u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b803-10\">The juror: \u201cCorrect.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b803-11\">The court: \u201cThat juror is you of whom he speaks?\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b803-12\">The juror: \u201cCorrect.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b803-13\">The court: \u201cWhat is the level of your discomfort, sir, and let me ask you a question, are you at the point where you do not \u2014 you feel so uncomfortable that your thoughts and your ability to assess the evidence and weigh the evidence is being affected?\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b803-14\">The juror: \u201cYes, sir.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b803-15\">The court: \u201cAnd you feel it is being negatively affected?\u201d The juror: \u201cYes, sir.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b803-16\">The court: \u201cWhat is your request personally, you?\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b803-17\">The juror: \u201cI request that I be removed and one of the alternates be put in my stead.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b803-18\">The court: \u201cIs there anything else that you want to tell me, sir?\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b803-19\">The juror: \u201cYes, I do.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b804-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"764\">*764</page-number>The court: \u201cEven though \u2014 I don\u2019t want you to tell me anything about your deliberations, anything that is said about the facts or the case itself. And you haven\u2019t told me anything, so I\u2019m sorry, I should have put this question to you. Have you told me everything you want to tell me about your level of discomfort?\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b804-5\">The juror: \u201cYes.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b804-6\">The court: \u201cAnd have you expressed to your fellow jurors that you are so uncomfortable that you do not want to complete your jury service?\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b804-7\">The juror: \u201cI have told them and they noticed, and they have actually encouraged me to bring it to the attention of the court.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b804-8\">The court: \u201cBring it to me?\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b804-9\">The juror: \u201cYes.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b804-10\">The court: \u201cAll right, just one moment. I\u2019m going to have you taken back by [the court officer] to the jury room, but let me first say I commend you for coming forward and being very frank and honest with me.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b804-11\">The juror: \u201cAnd I appreciate it.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b804-12\">When the juror left the court room, the judge asked counsel for their views. The prosecutor volunteered that \u201cin all [her] years of experience, [she] never had this happen,\u201d to which the judge replied, \u201cNor have I.\u201d Both the judge and the prosecutor commented upon the directness of the juror\u2019s request to be replaced by an alternate, and the prosecutor expressed surprise at how knowledgeable the juror was about the process. The prosecutor then stated that it might make sense to replace Juror 31 with an alternate, but that she would defer to the judge. After reviewing Juror 31\u2019s juror questionnaire, counsel for the codefendant remarked that Juror 31 seemed to be very well educated, and that he appeared to be the only Hispanic juror. Nevertheless, he agreed with the suggestion that Juror 31 be replaced with an alternate.</p>\n<p id=\"b805-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"765\">*765</page-number>Counsel for the defendant did not agree; he asked that Juror 31 remain. He expressed concern that Juror 31 was the only Hispanic juror in a case where both defendants were Hispanic, and that deliberations already had gone on for over a day. The prosecutor rejoined that if the only Hispanic juror had gotten sick, the judge would have no alternative but to seat an alternate. The judge agreed with the prosecutor, stating that he did not see how Juror 31\u2019s \u201cremoval ... at this time for reasons that he expressed as well as his personal request in any way sets a scene for the defendants to be denied a fair trial.\u201d Over formal objection made by the defendant\u2019s attorney, the judge proceeded to excuse Juror 31 from further service.</p>\n<p id=\"b805-6\">Thereafter, the judge instructed the remaining jurors as follows. \u201cLadies and gentlemen, for good reason I have removed a juror from your panel. We are about ready to replace him with an alternate.\u201d The judge also instructed the jury that they were to start their deliberations anew, explaining that this was necessary because the alternate had not been present, would be offering his views, and they needed to deliberate collectively. The defendant did not object to the judge\u2019s instruction.</p>\n<p id=\"b805-8\">At 11:45 a.m., an alternate was selected, and the jury were sent out to deliberate. An hour or so later, the jury reported that they had reached a verdict. At 1:04 p.m., it was announced in court that both defendants had been found guilty of armed robbery.</p>\n<p id=\"b805-9\"><em>Discussion. </em>\u201cThe discharge of a deliberating juror is a sensitive undertaking and is fraught with potential for error. It is to be done only in <em>special circumstances, </em>and with <em>special precau</em>tions\u201d (emphasis supplied). <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Connor, </em>392 Mass. 838, 843 (1984). The special circumstances are set forth in two statutes, G. L. c. 234, \u00a7 26B,<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> and G. L. c. 234A, \u00a7 39.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"766\">*766</page-number>See Mass.R.Crim.P. 20(d)(3), 378 Mass. 891 (1979), which largely tracks G. L. c. 234, \u00a7 26B.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> \u201cAlthough differing in language, the standards under the two statutes have been considered interchangeable or synonymous.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Olavarria, </em>71 Mass. App. Ct. 612, 619 (2008). Both statutes have been construed to permit dismissal \u201conly [for] reasons personal to a juror, having nothing whatever to do with the issues of the case or with the juror\u2019s relationship with his fellow jurors.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Connor, supra </em>at 844-845. \u201c \u2018Allowing discharge only for personal reasons ensures that such action will not \u201caffect the substance or the course of the deliberations.\u201d \u2019 <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Swafford, </em>441 Mass. 329, 336 (2004), quoting <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Connor, supra </em>at 845 n.4.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Olavarria, supra </em>at 619.</p>\n<p id=\"b806-5\">The special precautions are set forth in our case law, most notably in <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Connor, supra. </em>\u201c[A] judge must hold a hearing adequate to determine whether there is good cause to discharge [the] juror.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 843-844. \u201cAt the hearing, the issues of the case and the juror\u2019s relationship to his fellow jurors are not to be discussed.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 845. \u201cIf the \u2018problem\u2019 juror is questioned, the judge should preliminarily inform him that he cannot be discharged unless he has a personal problem, unrelated to his relationship to his fellow jurors or his views on the case. Unless the juror indicates a belief that he has such a problem, all questioning should cease.\u201d <em>Ibid, </em>(footnote omitted). \u201cIn an appropriate case, after an appropriate hearing and on the basis of appropriate findings, a judge may be in a position to conclude, without the assistance of medical experts, that a juror has a mental or emotional aberration, personal to the juror and unrelated to the merits of the case or the jury\u2019s deliberations, and that there is, therefore, good cause to discharge the juror.\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"767\">*767</page-number><em>Id. </em>at 846. However, the judge \u201chas at most a limited discretion to determine that the facts show an inability to perform the functions of a juror, and that inability must appear in the record as a demonstrable reality.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 846-847 (quotation omitted). Finally, if and when a deliberating juror is discharged, the judge must instruct the remaining jurors \u201cnot only to begin deliberations anew (see G. L. c. 234, \u00a7 26B) but also that the reason for discharge is entirely personal and has nothing to do with the discharged juror\u2019s views on the case or his relationship with his fellow jurors.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 845-846.</p>\n<p id=\"b807-5\">Adhering to these procedures is especially important in cases where the jury is at an impasse. \u201cAlthough a mistrial may be expensive in both human and monetary costs, it is not to be avoided by intrusion into the jury\u2019s domain.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 844. If it is not scrupulously determined that there is good cause for discharge, there is a risk that \u201ca dissenting juror [will be] allowed to evade [his] responsibilities,\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Garrey, </em>436 Mass. 422, 431 (2002). There also is a risk that his replacement \u201cwill feel a substantial coercive effect\u201d when joining other jurors who already have agreed upon the guilt or innocence of the accused. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Olavarria, supra </em>at 619-620. Furthermore, if, after discharge, the requisite instruction is not given, there is a risk that the remaining jurors will speculate that the juror was dismissed in order to make it possible for a verdict to be reached.</p>\n<p id=\"b807-6\">In this case, the appropriate procedures were not followed as to either the hearing or the judge\u2019s instruction following Juror 31\u2019s discharge. During the hearing, the judge did not inform Juror 31 that he could be discharged only if he had a personal problem; nor did the judge determine that Juror 31\u2019s stated emotional distress resulted from personal issues unrelated to his views on the case or his relationship with his fellow jurors. Indeed, as the Commonwealth acknowledges, it appears from the record that the judge was not aware of the specific guidelines set forth in the <em>Connor </em>case. The Commonwealth nevertheless posits that the judge properly could discharge Juror 31 on the ground that he was unable to perform his function as a juror due to emotional distress. According to the Commonwealth, emotional distress was an appropriate, personal basis for dis<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"768\">*768</page-number>missal, because the juror\u2019s communications to the judge when questioned about note-taking indicated that he had \u201ca significant level of anxiety\u201d about serving as a juror even before deliberations began.</p>\n<p id=\"b808-4\">We are unpersuaded that the juror\u2019s remarks when questioned about his note-taking reflected any undue anxiety; they appear to be little more than an attempt to explain why he took notes when, whether he knew it or not, doing so was not permitted in that court room. But even if Juror 31\u2019s comments reflected some degree of concern about his ability to fulfil his duties conscientiously, the record is wholly inadequate to support the conclusion that he was suffering from severe emotional or mental distress \u2014 beyond the level that often accompanies deliberations \u2014 that would justify discharging him during the course of deliberations.</p>\n<p id=\"b808-14\">The facts of this case are significantly different from those in <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Leftwich, </em>430 Mass. 865, 872-874 (2000), cited by the Commonwealth. In <em>Leftwich, </em>prior to the start of the third day of deliberations, one of the jurors insisted upon speaking with the judge. During two subsequent colloquies, the juror informed the judge that she had spoken with her physician the prior afternoon because she was having great difficulty with stress, including difficulty breathing, and that she did not think she could continue to deliberate or be a fair juror. The judge <em>noted </em>that the juror was very emotionally distraught and was shaking \u201cfrom head to toe.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 873. Based upon the physical manifestations of stress observed by the judge, as well as the juror\u2019s own report of her distress, the judge determined that the juror was unable to continue deliberations and discharged her over the objection of the defendant. On appeal, the Supreme Judicial Court concluded that the judge did not err or commit an abuse of discretion in discharging the juror, because, even without summoning the juror\u2019s physician or a court psychologist to examine the juror, the judge had sufficient basis to find that the juror was suffering from such extreme emotional distress that she could not perform her function as a juror. Also significant to the court\u2019s <em>decision was </em>that there was \u201cnothing in the record to indicate that the jury were at an impasse, or that the juror\u2019s statements were \u2018euphemisms\u2019 for the fact that the juror was \u2018per<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"769\">*769</page-number>sistent in asserting a minority position during deliberations.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>at 874, quoting from <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Connor, </em>392 Mass, at 846.</p>\n<p id=\"b809-5\">Here, on the other hand, but for Juror 31\u2019s ready agreement to the judge\u2019s questions about the degree of the juror\u2019s distress and its effect upon his ability to assess and weigh the evidence, there is nothing in the record to establish that he was incapable of continuing to deliberate. His responses to the judge were rational and specific, including his request that he be \u201cremoved and one of the alternates be put in [his] stead.\u201d Furthermore, unlike the record in <em>Leftwich, </em>the record in the present case does contain indications of impasse. The jury reported being unable to reach a unanimous decision at the end of the first day of deliberations, and, despite seeking and obtaining supplemental instruction from the judge, they had yet to reach a verdict during the morning of the second day. Notably, after Juror 31 was discharged and replaced, the jury reached a verdict in little more than an hour, even though they were instructed to begin their deliberations anew.</p>\n<p id=\"b809-6\">On this record, we cannot discount the possibility that substantive disagreement about the case was at the root of Juror 31\u2019s emotional distress, and that both he and the other jurors (who, according to Juror 31, encouraged him to bring his request to the attention of the judge) were seeking a way for him to be excused. In sum, the discharge of Juror 31 \u2014 to which the defendant timely objected \u2014 was erroneously effectuated without a proper hearing and findings, was not an appropriate exercise of the judge\u2019s circumscribed discretion, and resulted in prejudice requiring reversal.</p>\n<p id=\"b809-7\">Separately and independently, the judge also erred in failing to instruct the jury that the reason for Juror 31\u2019s dismissal was entirely personal and unrelated to his views about the case or his relationship with the remainder of the jury. The judge merely said that the defendant had been discharged for \u201cgood reason.\u201d Because the defendant did not object to the judge\u2019s instruction, we review only to determine whether the error created a substantial risk of a miscarriage of justice. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Zimmerman, </em>441 Mass. 146, 150-152 (2004).</p>\n<p id=\"b809-8\">\u201cThere will be occasions where the circumstances surround<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"770\">*770</page-number>ing the dismissal of a deliberating juror will leave no room for speculation as to the reason for the discharge, such that the failure to give a <em>Connor </em>instruction is not error .... But such circumstances will be rare . . . .\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 151. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Rodriguez, </em>63 Mass. App. Ct. 660, 677 (2005). This case does not present the rare circumstances necessary to deviate from the general rule.</p>\n<p id=\"b810-5\">Although the Commonwealth asserts that we can be confident the remaining jurors were aware that Juror 31 was experiencing emotional distress and that he was discharged on that basis, it begs the question of the source of his emotional distress. Where the jury previously had informed the judge that they were unable to reach a verdict, it was particularly important that they be instructed that Juror 31\u2019s removal had nothing to do with his views on the case lest they speculate that he was removed because he was perceived to be an obstacle to their reaching a verdict. In the circumstances presented, the absence of a proper instruction created a substantial risk of a miscarriage of justice. See <em>id. </em>at 678. Contrast <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Peppicelli, </em>70 Mass. App. Ct. 87, 95-96 (2007).</p>\n<p id=\"b810-6\"><em>Conclusion. </em>For the foregoing reasons, the judgment is reversed, and the verdict set aside.</p>\n<p id=\"b810-7\">\n<em>So ordered.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b800-14\">The codefendant is not a party to this appeal.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b801-8\">The defendant\u2019s appeal was stayed while he pursued a motion for a new trial in the trial court.
