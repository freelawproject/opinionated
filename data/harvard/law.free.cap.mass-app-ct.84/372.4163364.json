L. c. 272, \u00a7 4B.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Both defendants argue that the jury instructions were erroneous with regard to the definition of \u201cinducement,\u201d that there was insufficient evidence as to inducement, and that the prosecutor\u2019s closing argument was improper. The defendant Melissa Halstrom contends that the instruction regarding deriving support from prostitution was erroneous. The defendant Anthony Gorgoglione argues that his motion to sever should have been granted and that the prosecutor\u2019s opening statement impermissibly referenced excluded evidence. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b413-11\"><em>Background. </em>We summarize the facts of the case, leaving additional facts for later discussion as needed. The case involved three minors, Gail, Beth, and Maureen (collectively, girls), ages <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"374\">*374</page-number>sixteen to seventeen, who the Commonwealth maintained were persuaded to participate in a prostitution business operated by Halstrom with the assistance of Gorgoglione. Gail had known Halstrom since 2005, when Halstrom dated her father. When Gail was \u201ckicked out\u201d of her house during her freshman year of high school in 2005, she stayed with Halstrom for about a month. She remained close to Halstrom and visited her frequently. In the summer of 2007, Gail again lived with her father. Gail also socialized with Halstrom. During this period, Gail lost her job at a coffee shop and was unable to find another position. After her father received an eviction notice, Gail told Halstrom that she was worried about her family\u2019s ability to pay the rent.</p>\n<p id=\"b414-5\">Upon learning of the eviction notice, Halstrom told Gail about her work as an escort, which she described as accompanying men to events. She said that the work was \u201cfun\u201d and \u201ceasy money.\u201d Halstrom said she was looking for girls, and \u201cit didn\u2019t matter\u201d if they were not eighteen. Halstrom said she would take pictures for a Web site and \u201cgo from there.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b414-6\">Gail, who, in her own words, was \u201c17 and a little desperate,\u201d agreed to have the pictures taken. She also introduced her friends Beth (a runaway) and Maureen (who stayed with Gail several nights a week) to Halstrom. After meeting Halstrom, Beth and Maureen expressed an interest in the escort business. Gail and Beth participated in a photography session in which Gorgoglione posed the girls and took photographs of them in lingerie. Gail and Maureen later participated in a similar photography session. Both sets of photographs appeared on the Web site set up by the defendants.</p>\n<p id=\"b414-7\">Halstrom then organized \u201cdates\u201d for the girls during which they had sex with men. Gail and Maureen maintained that they were first told that they would have to have sex with the men in a hotel room shortly before the first date. It was undisputed that Beth understood this fact from the outset. The defense suggested that the proposition that the girls misunderstood their roles was disingenuous at best, particularly in light of the nature of the photographs taken and displayed on the Internet.</p>\n<p id=\"b414-8\">Halstrom provided the girls with hotel names and keys, gave them drugs, took them to the hotels, paid for the rooms, and took $100 of the $300 charged per hour by each girl. In addi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"375\">*375</page-number>tion to taking the photographs, Gorgoglione also transported the girls to the hotels, and discussed their dates with them.</p>\n<p id=\"b415-5\">After a period of time, Maureen stopped participating. Beth, who had run away from her home in another State, turned herself in to the police in the beginning of September, 2007, prompting the investigation that resulted in the indictment and trial of the defendants in 2009.</p>\n<p id=\"b415-6\"><em>Discussion. </em>1. <em>Inducement. </em>Both defendants challenge the judge\u2019s instructions concerning inducement of a minor to become a prostitute. The defendants also challenge the sufficiency of the evidence as to inducement.</p>\n<p id=\"b415-7\">a. <em>Instruction </em>\u2014 <em>the meaning of \u201cinduce.\u201d </em>The judge instructed the jury that \u201c[ijnduce means to lead or move another to do something by influence or persuasion.\u201d Halstrom argues that the judge\u2019s instruction was deficient because it lowered the Commonwealth\u2019s burden of proof by conflating inducement with mere influence or contribution. Halstrom did not object or request other instructions. Our review is therefore for error creating a substantial risk of a miscarriage of justice. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Marinho, </em>464 Mass. 115, 122 (2013).</p>\n<p id=\"b415-8\">In the absence of a statutory definition, \u201cwe give [the words] their usual and accepted meanings, as long as these meanings are consistent with the statutory purpose. . . . We derive the words\u2019 usual and accepted meanings from sources presumably known to the statute\u2019s enactors, such as their use in other legal contexts and dictionary definitions.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Zubiel, </em>456 Mass. 27, 32 (2010), quoting from <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Zone Book, Inc., </em>372 Mass. 366, 369 (1977). See Singer &amp; Singer, Statutes and Statutory Construction \u00a7 46.4 (7th ed. 2007); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>O\u2019Keefe, </em>48 Mass. App. Ct. 566, 567 (2000).</p>\n<p id=\"b415-9\">Webster\u2019s Third New International Dictionary 1154 (2002) defines the word \u201cinduce\u201d to mean, in pertinent part, \u201cto move and lead (as by persuasion or influence) ... to inspire, call forth, or bring about by influence or stimulation.\u201d This construction, which the judge adopted in the jury instruction, also \u201cgains support from the language and construction of related statutes.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Welch, </em>444 Mass. 80, 87 (2005). In G. L. c. 272, \u00a7 4, as amended by St. 1998, c. 232, \u00a7 3, which punishes \u201c[w]hoever induces any person under 18 years of age <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"376\">*376</page-number>of chaste life to have unlawful sexual intercourse,\u201d the word \u201cinduce\u201d has been construed to mean \u201cto move and lead (as by persuasion or influence); prevail upon; influence, persuade.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Foley, </em>24 Mass. App. Ct. 114, 115 n.1 (1987) (quotation omitted). More recently, in <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Matos, </em>78 Mass. App. Ct. 578, 588 n.14 (2011), we noted with respect to the child enticement statute, G. L. c. 265, \u00a7 26C, that the word \u201cinduce\u201d \u201cappears to be used interchangeably with \u2018entice,\u2019 \u2018lure,\u2019 \u2018persuade,\u2019 \u2018tempt,\u2019 \u2018incite,\u2019 \u2018solicit,\u2019 \u2018coax,\u2019 or \u2018invite.\u2019 \u201d The word \u201cinduce\u201d also forms one of the statutory bases for a conviction of contributing to the delinquency of a minor under G. L. c. 119, \u00a7 63, as amended by St. 1996, c. 450, \u00a7 162, by \u201ctending to cause or induce such delinquency\u201d of a child. See <em>Matos, supra. </em>The usual and accepted meaning of the word \u201cinduce,\u201d as judged by common parlance and legislative usage, thus encompasses either influence or persuasion. With respect to G. L. c. 272, \u00a7 4A, the salient inquiry is whether by word or deed the defendant has influenced or persuaded \u201ca minor to become a prostitute.\u201d<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> There was no error in the instruction on this ground.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b416-5\">b. <em>Sufficiency </em>\u2014 <em>Halstrom. </em>Halstrom contends that there was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"377\">*377</page-number>insufficient evidence of inducement because the girls chose to be prostitutes, saw her lifestyle as desirable, and thus willingly and voluntarily engaged in prostitution for this reason. Viewing the evidence in the light most favorable to the Commonwealth, see <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Latimore, </em>378 Mass. 671, 677 (1979), the evidence presented was more than sufficient to permit the jury to find beyond a reasonable doubt that Halstrom intentionally cultivated an image intended to persuade the girls that being an escort was desirable, and that she facilitated their entry into the trade in myriad ways.</p>\n<p id=\"b417-5\">Halstrom befriended the girls at a particularly vulnerable time in each of their lives. She socialized with the girls at her apartment, served them champagne, and gave them dmgs. She told the girls the work was \u201cfun\u201d and \u201ceasy money.\u201d Gail and Beth saw that Halstrom had a nice car, nice furniture, and a well-kept apartment, which Halstrom said was paid for by her clients. Halstrom told Gail that she was \u201clooking for girls\u201d to join the escort service and that it \u201cdidn\u2019t matter\u201d if they were not eighteen.</p>\n<p id=\"b417-6\">Moreover, there was evidence that Halstrom did much more than passively market her lifestyle. Viewed in the light most favorable to the Commonwealth, the jury could have found beyond a reasonable doubt that she methodically led the girls into prostitution. At the outset, she gave a partial description of the services provided to two of the girls, withholding information as to the actual nature of the escort service. She then arranged for highly suggestive photographs to be taken of the girls, bought lingerie for them for two photography sessions, assisted in the girls\u2019 poses,<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> and said that she would be using the photographs \u201cfor her business.\u201d Whether the girls were misled by Halstrom\u2019s characterization of her business, or remained uninformed even after the photographs were taken, was for the jury. Even if the jury found, as Halstrom urged, that the girls were not misled, the jury were also permitted to find that the incremental exposure to all of the particulars of the business was part of a successful plan of gradual acclimatization.</p>\n<p id=\"b417-7\">Once the girls cooperated in the initial photography sessions, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"378\">*378</page-number>Halstrom then moved forward to set them up with dates. She gave the girls pseudonyms for the Web site, told the girls when their dates would be, recruited the dates, gave the girls the hotel number and room key, drove the girls to the hotel, provided condoms, and paid for the hotel room. She gave one or more of the girls Klonopin in advance of the first date and supplied them with the drug thereafter. She also gave them alcohol. When Beth became nervous about the dates, Halstrom gave Maureen the drug Klonopin and told her to \u201cmake [Beth] take her Klonopin.\u201d This evidence was sufficient to permit a rational jury to find that the girls\u2019 willingness and agreement to engage in prostitution was the product of Halstrom\u2019s inducement \u2014 that is, a carefully planned introduction to the trade, including the persuasive and enticing image that Halstrom created, her affirmative acts in setting up and preparing the girls for the dates, marketing them as part of her business, and providing them with drugs and alcohol to ensure their continued compliance and cooperation.</p>\n<p id=\"b418-4\">c. <em>Instruction </em>\u2014 <em>the timing of inducement. </em>Gorgoglione contends that the inducement instruction was erroneous because the instruction relieved the Commonwealth of its burden of proving that the two girls he was charged with inducing, Gail and Maureen, see note 2, <em>supra, </em>were not already engaging in prostitution. As to Maureen, there is no evidence that she was engaged in prostitution at any time prior to meeting Halstrom or Gorgoglione. Gail, however, equivocated on cross-examination as to whether her first act of prostitution occurred before or after meeting Gorgoglione. Gorgoglione did not object to the instruction. We therefore review for error creating a substantial risk of a miscarriage of justice. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Marinho, </em>464 Mass, at 122.</p>\n<p id=\"b418-5\">In <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Matos, </em>78 Mass. App. Ct. at 586, we held that \u201cthe language of the statute [G. L. c. 272, \u00a7 4A,] is plain and unambiguous and that it clearly expresses the Legislature\u2019s intent to penalize a person for inducing a minor, <em>who is not then so engaged, </em>to engage in the commercial enterprise of prostitution by offering for hire his or her body for indiscriminate sexual activity\u201d (emphasis added).<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> In <em>Matos, </em>the instruction <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"379\">*379</page-number>affirmatively precluded the jury from considering whether the minor was already engaged in prostitution at the time she was allegedly induced. <em>Id. </em>at 587-588. The present case is distinguishable in the sense that the instruction did not remove the question from the jury. However, the instruction stated only that the Commonwealth must prove \u201cthat the defendant induced or knowingly aided and assisted in inducing a minor to engage in prostitution.\u201d The omission of the phrase \u201cwho is not then so engaged\u201d would permit a rational juror to conclude that any act of prostitution, regardless of when it took place, was punishable. The instruction was erroneous because it omitted an element of the offense. <em>Ibid.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b419-5\">We do not think, however, that \u201cthe error materially influenced the verdict in the light of the evidence and law of the entire trial.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Velez, </em>82 Mass. App. Ct. 12, 19 (2012). The defense at trial was that the girls willingly chose to engage in prostitution and came to Halstrom ready to participate, and that neither defendant influenced, persuaded, or led them in any way. In the context of this defense, the timing of Gail\u2019s first date was largely immaterial, and Gorgoglione made no argument to the jury on this basis. More importantly, Gorgoglione was indicted as a coventurer. As a result, Halstrom\u2019s conduct in furtherance of the venture was attributable to him. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Zanetti, </em>454 Mass. 449, 455 (2009), abrogated in part on other grounds by <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Britt, </em>465 Mass. 87, 97-101 (2013). Under both the statute and the common law, one who gives aid or assistance to the venture \u201cis equally guilty with the perpetrator of the crime.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Dahlstrom, </em>345 Mass. 130, 132 (1962). It was undisputed that Gail engaged in prostitution for the first time after meeting Halstrom. The record therefore contains no \u201cevidence that could rationally lead to a contrary finding with respect to the omitted element.\u201d <em>Matos, supra </em>at 588, quoting from <em>Neder </em>v. <em>United States, </em>527 U.S. 1, 19 (1999).</p>\n<p id=\"b419-6\">d. <em>Sufficiency </em>\u2014 <em>Gorgoglione. </em>Gorgoglione posits that there was insufficient evidence that he knew that the girls were being recruited for purposes of prostitution (rather than simply as escorts), and that he therefore lacked the requisite intent to commit the crime charged. He further contends that the evidence <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"380\">*380</page-number>was insufficient to show that he induced either Gail or Maureen to engage in prostitution because they both made the decision to become prostitutes of their own accord without any influence by him. Because Gorgoglione was indicted both as a principal and as an aider and abettor, see G. L. c. 272, \u00a7 4A, we analyze both prongs of the indictment under a single standard, that is, \u201cwhether the evidence is sufficient to permit a rational juror to conclude beyond a reasonable doubt that the defendant knowingly participated in the commission of the crime charged, with the intent required to commit the crime.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Zanetti, </em>454 Mass, at 468.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b420-5\">Here, the evidence viewed in the light most favorable to the Commonwealth was sufficient to permit a jury to infer Gorgoglione\u2019s knowledge, intent, and influence \u201cfrom his knowledge of the circumstances and participation in the crime.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Norris, </em>462 Mass. 131, 139 (2012), quoting from <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Carnes, </em>457 Mass. 812, 823 (2010). Gorgoglione took photographs of the girls in lingerie, posed them alone and in pairs in a highly suggestive manner, and reviewed the photographs with the girls to determine which ones they liked. During the second photography session, there was conversation in the presence of both Halstrom and Gorgoglione about the rates charged, Halstrom\u2019s cut, and the clients that Gail and Beth had seen. Gorgoglione said that he would put the photographs on the Web site and that he \u201cran\u201d the Web site. The photographs later appeared on the Web site. Gorgoglione also picked up Gail and Beth from Halstrom\u2019s home and took them to a hotel. He discussed the escort business with Gail on the way home. Gorgoglione offered incentives to recruit other girls to the business, telling Gail that \u201c[i]f [the girls] got five girls to sign up, they would send [the girls] ... on vacation basically.\u201d The evidence, taken in the light most favorable to the Commonwealth, was sufficient to permit a jury to infer, based on Gorgoglione\u2019s actions, that he was a knowing participant in the effort to introduce the girls to prostitution, and that he shared Halstrom\u2019s intent to induce them to engage in prostitution.</p>\n<p id=\"b421-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"381\">*381</page-number>Relying on <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Matos, </em>78 Mass. App. Ct. at 589, Gorgoglione further contends that he is entitled to a required finding of not guilty because Gail\u2019s inconsistent testimony suggested that she had already been engaged in prostitution before she met him at the photography session.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> \u201c[I]t does not matter that some of the evidence could be characterized as equivocal or contradictory.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>James, </em>424 Mass. 770, 785 (1997), quoting from <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Ruci, </em>409 Mass. 94, 97 (1991). Her testimony presented \u201can issue of credibility, an issue that is solely within the province of the jury,\u201d and which we resolve in favor of the Commonwealth when a question of sufficiency is presented on appeal. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>James, supra. </em>Moreover, on the evidence, the jury could have found beyond a reasonable doubt that Gorgoglione, as an aider and abettor, shared the intent with Halstrom to persuade Gail to engage in the first act of prostitution, and was thus guilty of the crime charged regardless of whether the first instance of prostitution took place before or after he took the photographs. \u201cThe acts and declarations of one person engaged in a common undertaking are admissible against [and imputable to] the others so engaged on the premise that each person is the agent of the other.\u201d Nolan &amp; Sartorio, Criminal Law \u00a7 635, at 645 (3d ed. 2001).</p>\n<p id=\"b421-5\">2. <em>Deriving support from prostitution. </em>Halstrom contends that her due process rights were violated because the judge\u2019s instruction requiring \u201cthat the defendant shared in some way in what she knew were the earnings or proceeds from that person\u2019s prostitution\u201d lowered the Commonwealth\u2019s burden of proof under G. L. c. 272, \u00a7 4B.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> She contends that the judge\u2019s instruction erroneously omitted the element of deriving support or maintenance, in whole or in part, from the proceeds of prostitution and that this portion of the instruction is necessary in order <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"382\">*382</page-number>to avoid conviction of persons for conduct unrelated to pimping activity, as opposed to punishing \u201cpimps and purveyors.\u201d See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Thetonia, </em>27 Mass. App. Ct. 783, 786 (1989).</p>\n<p id=\"b422-4\">The statute permits conviction either for deriving support or maintenance from, or for sharing in, the proceeds of prostitution. \u201cThe word \u2018or\u2019 is given a disjunctive meaning unless the context and the main purpose of all the words demand otherwise.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Davie, </em>46 Mass. App. Ct. 25, 27 (1998), quoting from <em>Nuclear Metals, Inc. </em>v. <em>Low-Level Radioactive Waste Mgmt. Bd., </em>421 Mass. 196, 212 (1995), and <em>Eastern Mass. St. Ry. </em>v. <em>Massachusetts Bay Transp. Authy., </em>350 Mass. 340, 343 (1966). See Singer &amp; Singer, Statutes and Statutory Construction, <em>supra </em>at \u00a7 21.14. The instruction given confined the Commonwealth to the single theory of sharing proceeds, and to that extent favored Halstrom. Halstrom maintains, however, that this limited instruction heightened the risk that she was convicted of simply taking a gift or thing of value from a prostitute, contrary to the holding in <em>Thetonia. </em>Because there was no objection to the instruction on this basis, we review for error that creates a substantial risk of a miscarriage of justice. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Marinho, </em>464 Mass, at 122.</p>\n<p id=\"b422-5\">In <em>Thetonia,</em><footnotemark><em>10</em></footnotemark><em> </em>the evidence was that the defendant drove an acquaintance to and from work and waited for her \u201cwhile she plied her trade.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Thetonia, supra </em>at 786. The acquaintance supplied the defendant with gasoline money, and occasionally with drugs. <em>Id. </em>at 785-786. We held that these \u201cactivities are not what is commonly viewed as pimping.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 786. Halstrom, however, did not merely share proceeds based on conduct disassociated from pimping activities. The evidence was overwhelming that Halstrom actively recruited the girls, marketed them, placed their sexual services in the stream of commerce, and thereafter shared in the proceeds of prostitution. She did not deny this conduct. Her defense at trial was that the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"383\">*383</page-number>girls initiated their participation, and that she did not induce them, a factual question which the jury decided. Halstrom\u2019s pimping activity was explicit, and in that context the instruction was more than adequate.</p>\n<p id=\"b423-5\">3. <em>Motion to sever. </em>Gorgoglione argues that his due process rights were violated when a redacted statement made by Halstrom was admitted at the joint trial because the jury were permitted to consider Halstrom\u2019s inculpatory statement when considering Gorgoglione\u2019s guilt as an aider and abettor.</p>\n<p id=\"b423-6\">Absent a constitutional requirement, the decision whether to sever is lodged in the sound discretion of the trial judge. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Siny Van Tran, </em>460 Mass. 535, 543 (2011).</p>\n<p id=\"b423-7\">Halstrom\u2019s redacted interview did not implicate or inculpate Gorgoglione in any way. <em>Bruton </em>v. <em>United States, </em>391 U.S. 123 (1968), is therefore inapplicable. Further, no prejudice accrued to Gorgoglione because the judge instructed both contemporaneously and in the final charge that the statement could not be used as evidence against him. All three girls testified and directly implicated Gorgoglione. The judge did not abuse her discretion.</p>\n<p id=\"b423-8\">4. <em>Opening statement. </em>Gorgoglione contends, for the first time on appeal, that the prosecutor\u2019s opening statement improperly linked Gorgoglione to \u201cGoDaddy.com,\u201d a Web site registration service. Before trial, the Commonwealth moved to introduce billing and subscriber records produced by \u201cGoDaddy.com\u201d purporting to show that Gorgoglione paid for and registered the domain name of the Web site set up by the defendants. The judge excluded the records because the business records affidavit failed to authenticate them properly, but stated that she could see no reason to exclude the evidence if the prosecutor could later produce a proper affidavit and certificate. During her opening statement, the prosecutor stated that jurors would hear about \u201cthe records from GoDaddy.com that the [defendants\u2019] website was set up and paid for by an individual named Anthony Gorgoglione.\u201d At trial, the Commonwealth attempted to get, but was unsuccessful in obtaining, a proper affidavit, and the judge excluded the evidence. The judge instructed the jury that opening statements were not evidence and that the defendants were to be convicted only on admitted evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b423-9\">\u201cA prosecutor in his opening may explain the facts that he <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"384\">*384</page-number>expects to prove during the trial, so long as he has a good faith expectation that he will be able to do so with relevant and admissible evidence.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Jones, </em>439 Mass. 249, 260 (2003), quoting from <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Thomas, </em>429 Mass. 146, 157 (1999). Here, there is no indication that the prosecutor\u2019s opening statement was made \u201cother than in good faith.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>O\u2019Connell, </em>438 Mass. 658, 668 (2003). Accord <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Rosa, </em>73 Mass. App. Ct. 540, 544 (2009), quoting from <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Qualls, </em>440 Mass. 576, 586 (2003) (\u201cAbsent a showing of bad faith or prejudice ... the fact that certain evidence fails to materialize is not a ground for reversal\u201d). Accordingly there was no error.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b424-5\">5. <em>Closing argument. </em>Both defendants contend that the prosecutor\u2019s closing argument inflamed the passions and sympathies of the jury. Gorgoglione also argues that the prosecutor improperly used rhetorical questions and vouched for a witness\u2019s credibility. We review first for error, and reach the question of impact on the jury only if error is shown. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Smith, </em>460 Mass. 385, 398 (2011); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Mejia, </em>463 Mass. 243, 250 (2012).</p>\n<p id=\"b424-6\">a. <em>Sympathy. </em>In their closings, both defendants argued that the girls chose to engage in prostitution at Gail\u2019s urging, not Halstrom\u2019s, and relied on the girls\u2019 family history, background, and lifestyle, including previous drug use, as further basis for their decision. In response, the prosecutor stated, \u201cLadies and gentlemen, every single thing that the defendants would have you hold against these girls, it\u2019s not about sympathy.\u201d The prosecutor, without objection, further stated that the fact that the girls were minors, did not come from nuclear families, and were using alcohol and drugs made them particularly \u201csusceptible to these crimes.\u201d The prosecutor also stated, \u201c[Maureen] wanted to feel beautiful and ended up feeling dirty and ashamed of herself. [Gail] wanted money, and ended up eating Klonopin. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"385\">*385</page-number>And [Beth] didn\u2019t want to go home until life here made home look pretty good.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b425-5\">The prosecutor\u2019s arguments regarding the girls\u2019 home lives and their motivations were relevant to the Commonwealth\u2019s theory that they were \u201csusceptible\u201d to inducements to engage in prostitution. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Paradise, </em>405 Mass. 141, 152-154 (1989). The prosecutor\u2019s description of the impact of prostitution on the girls was taken nearly verbatim from their testimony, and was \u201ca reasonable and proper attempt to counter the suggestion in defense counsel[\u2019s] summation\u201d that the girls\u2019 conduct was voluntary, rather than the product of influence or persuasion by the defendants. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Parenti, </em>14 Mass. App. Ct. 696, 705 (1982).</p>\n<p id=\"b425-6\">b. <em>Vouching. </em>Gorgoglione argues that the prosecutor impermissibly vouched for the truthfulness of the girls, in part by using rhetorical questions which shifted the burden of proof to Gorgoglione. The prosecutor argued in closing that the girls had nothing to lie about because they had immunity, and explained inconsistencies in their prior statements on the basis that teenagers tend to lie about drinking and drug use, and that teenagers often lie to the police. Gorgoglione objected; thus, our review is for prejudicial error. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Francis, </em>450 Mass. 132, 141 (2007).</p>\n<p id=\"b425-7\">\u201cWhere credibility is at issue, it is certainly proper for counsel to argue from the evidence why a witness should be believed.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Siny Van Tran, </em>460 Mass, at 555, quoting from <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Thomas, </em>401 Mass. 109, 116 (1987). The use of rhetorical questions was a device used to refute the defendants\u2019 assertions that the girls were lying about why they engaged in prostitution, and did not constitute vouching. Nor was there any suggestion that Gorgoglione had any duty to present evidence on the issue of inducement. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Tu Trinh, </em>458 Mass. 776,786-788 (2011) (prosecutor\u2019s rhetorical questions did not shift burden of proof but explained why Commonwealth\u2019s witnesses\u2019 testimony was credible); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Rogers, </em>43 Mass. App. Ct. 782, 786 (1997) (same). The prosecutor did not act improperly in responding to the defendants\u2019 challenge to witness credibility.</p>\n<p id=\"b426-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"386\">*386</page-number><em>Conclusion. </em>For these reasons, we affirm the convictions in all respects.</p>\n<p id=\"b426-5\">\n<em>Judgments affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b413-12\">Halstrom appeals from three convictions of inducing three minors, whom we shall call Gail, Beth, and Maureen, to become prostitutes and three convictions of deriving support from or sharing in the proceeds of prostitution committed by a minor.

App. Ct. at 588 n.14. See, e.g., <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Shuman, </em>391 Mass. 345, 351-352 (1984) (requiring pleading, arguing, or something more than mere solicitation). In the entrapment context, \u201c \u2018the state cannot tolerate . . . having its officers, who are charged with the duty of enforcing the law, instigate crime by implanting criminal ideas in innocent minds and thereby bringing about offenses that otherwise would never have been perpetrated.\u2019 R. Perkins, Criminal Law 1031 (2d ed. 1969).\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 350-351. A stricter definition of inducement is therefore employed in cases involving entrapment to ensure that constitutional guarantees are not eroded by governmental misconduct. Here, quite different concerns are at play. The very purpose of the related statutes protecting minors from sexual exploitation is to punish those who would \u201cimplant ideas\u201d and to deter those who would solicit, suggest, or offer opportunities for sexual exploitation to vulnerable minors. In this context, where \u201cthe Legislature has expressed a clear intent to protect children from sexual exploitation by adults,\u201d we construe the statute in a manner consistent with the plain meaning of its language and that purpose. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Matos, supra </em>at 584.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b417-8\">The photographs showed the girls dressed in lingerie in sexually suggestive poses.
