L. c. 278, \u00a7 29D, in that he did not advise the defendant that the particular disposition of his case, i.e., an admission to sufficient facts, could have immigration consequences.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> , <footnotemark>6</footnotemark> After a nonevidentiary hearing, a judge (who was not the plea judge) denied the motion in an endorsement order. We reverse because the Commonwealth did not meet its burden of establishing that the defendant received the mandatory statutory immigration warning.</p>\n<p id=\"b244-5\">At the time of the defendant\u2019s pleas, G. L. c. 278, \u00a7 29D, required that defendants be advised by a judge, \u201cIf you are not a citizen of the United States, you are hereby advised that the acceptance by this court of your plea of guilty, plea of nolo contendere, <em>or admission to sufficient facts </em>may have consequences of deportation, exclusion from admission to the United States, or denial of naturalization, pursuant to the laws of the United States\u201d (emphasis added). G. L. c. 278, \u00a7 29D, as amended through St. 2004, c. 225, \u00a7 1. \u201cTo comply with the statute, the judge must give the alien warning, preferably by reading the single quoted sentence directly from the statute.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Hilaire, </em>437 Mass. 809, 819 (2002).</p>\n<p id=\"b244-6\">The defendant does not contend that the plea judge failed to provide an immigration warning of any sort. Rather, he contends that there is no evidence that he was informed that his particular pleas, i.e., an admission to sufficient facts, could have immigra<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"205\">*205</page-number>tion consequences and that he does not recall being so advised.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> The Commonwealth bears the burden of providing an \u201caffirmative record that the required advisement was given,\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Mahadeo, </em>397 Mass. 314, 318 (1986), and it retains that burden \u201cregardless of how much time has passed since the defendant\u2019s guilty plea.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Grannum, </em>457 Mass. 128, 132 (2010), citing <em>Commonwealth </em>v. Jones, 417 Mass. 661, 664 (1994). If there is no \u201cofficial record or a contemporaneously written record kept in the court file that the court provided the advisement as prescribed [by G. L. c. 278, \u00a7 29D], including but not limited to a docket sheet that accurately reflects that the warning was given as required by this section, the defendant shall be presumed not to have received advisement.\u201d G. L. c. 278, \u00a7 29D.</p>\n<p id=\"b245-5\">The docket sheet has an entry on the date of the plea that \u201calien warning (279 \u00a7 29D [sic<footnotemark>8</footnotemark>]) given defendant.\u201d In addition, the \u201cgreen sheet\u201d<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> reflects that the defendant did not accept the terms of the disposition until after the proposed probation period was negotiated down from one year to eleven months. We may infer that the one-month reduction was an attempt to avoid immigration consequences of which the defendant was aware. Finally, the green sheet contains the plea judge\u2019s certification that he provided an immigration warning. In short, the Commonwealth met its burden of creating an affirmative record <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"206\">*206</page-number>that the defendant received an immigration warning. \u201cAccordingly, the statutory presumption of nonadvisement, which is triggered only in the absence of \u2018a record\u2019 that the deportation advisement was given, G. L. c. 278, \u00a7 29D, is not operative here.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Rzepphiewski, </em>431 Mass. 48, 55 (2000).</p>\n<p id=\"b246-8\">This does not end the matter, however, because we must still determine whether the Commonwealth \u201cadequately established] that the judge gave the deportation advisement mandated by the statute.\u201d<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> <em>Ibid. </em>We conclude that it did not. There is no transcript of the plea colloquy.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> The only evidence of the content of the immigration warning that the defendant received is the plea judge\u2019s certification on the green sheet, which provides that the judge advised the defendant</p>\n<p id=\"b246-16\">\u201cthat if he . . .is not a citizen of the United States, a conviction of the offense with which he . . . was charged may have the consequences of deportation, exclusion from admission to the United States, or denial of naturalization, pursuant to the laws of the United States.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b246-21\">This warning did not comport with the amended statutory language;<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> among other things, it did not include the required reference to disposition by way of an admission to sufficient facts. See G. L. c. 278, \u00a7 29D.</p>\n<p id=\"b246-25\">There is nothing in the record to permit the motion judge (or us) to take the plea judge\u2019s contemporaneous certification at anything less than face value. For example, the Commonwealth did not supply an affidavit from the plea judge as to his memory of the substance of the colloquy, or of his regular and routine practice concerning the substance of the immigration warnings he delivered at the time of the defendant\u2019s pleas. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Podoprigora, </em>46 Mass. App. Ct. 928, 930 (1999) (motion judge was plea judge and noted his own standard practice <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"207\">*207</page-number>at time of plea); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Diaz, </em>75 Mass. App. Ct. 347, 351 (2009) (\u201cIn the circumstances of a record depleted by the passage of time, the plea judge\u2019s statement of customary practice can be necessary and probative\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b247-5\">Similarly, absent a record to support it, we cannot accept the Commonwealth\u2019s argument that the certification did not reflect the judge\u2019s actual warning, but was simply a by-product of the fact that the District Court was working through a backlog of obsolete green sheets. Although we recognize the chronic financial constraints on our trial courts, we cannot on that basis alone conclude that the judge\u2019s signed certification was incorrect. Nor, in the face of the plea judge\u2019s certification, can the Commonwealth rest upon the presumption that the judge complied with the amended statute. The \u201cpresumption of regularity that applies to collateral challenges to guilty pleas under\u201d Mass.R. Crim.P. 30(b), as appearing in 435 Mass. 1501 (2001), does not apply to challenges, such as this one, brought pursuant to G. L. c. 278, \u00a7 29D. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Grannum, </em>457 Mass, at 133.</p>\n<p id=\"b247-6\">For all of these reasons, the order denying the defendant\u2019s motion to withdraw his guilty pleas is reversed.</p>\n<p id=\"b247-7\">\n<em>So ordered.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b243-15\">The charges arose from an incident of domestic violence against the defendant\u2019s then wife.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b243-16\">The defendant apparently completed his probation without incident.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b243-17\">The defendant was a legal resident of the United States, but a citizen of Cape Verde.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b244-7\">The Commonwealth does not dispute that the 2005 charges were the defendant\u2019s first criminal matter. Nor does the Commonwealth dispute that the defendant\u2019s only other criminal matter is a later charge of operating under the influence. There is no dispute that the defendant, having been denied readmission to the United States, has met his burden of showing that he faces one of the immigration consequences enumerated in G. L. c. 278, \u00a7 29. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Hilaire, </em>437 Mass. 809, 813-814 (2002); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Grannum, </em>457 Mass. 128, 134 (2010).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b244-9\">The defendant\u2019s affidavit stated that he did not recall the judge advising him that his change of pleas might cause him to become inadmissible to the United States.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b244-11\">The defendant also argued that his counsel did not adequately inform him of the potential immigration consequences of his pleas.

Approximately eight months before the defendant tendered his pleas, G. L. c. 278, \u00a7 29D, was amended to require that defendants be advised specifically that an admission to sufficient facts may have certain immigration consequences. See St. 2004, c. 225, \u00a7 1, effective October 27, 2004. The amendment followed the Supreme Judicial Court\u2019s conclusion that the prior version of the statute, which did not include a warning about the potential consequences of admitting to sufficient facts, \u201cis inadequate, and even potentially misleading.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Villalobos, </em>437 Mass. 797, 803 (2002).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b245-13\">The statutory citation should be to G.
