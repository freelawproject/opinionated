For the reasons that follow, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b644-4\"><em>Background. </em>The judge heard the following facts. On August 23, 2010, at approximately 7 p.m., the defendant was involved in a motor vehicle accident on Main Street in Waltham. A witness testified that she saw the defendant drive a vehicle away from Gordon\u2019s Liquor Store and then travel diagonally across two lanes of traffic and into her lane, where it \u201csmashed into the driver\u2019s side headlight area of [her] car.\u201d Afterwards, her car was inoperable. The witness\u2019s boyfriend, who had been driving her car, called the police; the witness saw the defendant \u201crocking back and forth,\u201d saying, \u201cI\u2019m so fucked, I\u2019m so fucked.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b644-5\">Waltham police Officer Anthony Scichilone responded to the scene and observed the witness\u2019s motor vehicle stopped in traffic. He spoke with the defendant, who told him that the witness\u2019s car had struck him; however, according to the officer, the witness\u2019s car was in the proper lane. During the conversation, the officer noticed that the defendant had \u201ca moderate odor of alcohol coming from his breath, his eyes were bloodshot and glassy, he had slurred speech, and to me he looked impaired. ... He was unsteady on his feet and when he approached the sidewalk he stumbled off the sidewalk.\u201d Believing that the defendant was \u201cimpaired and intoxicated,\u201d Scichilone placed him under arrest. Thomas Moran, a Waltham police sergeant who booked the defendant, essentially corroborated Scichilone\u2019s testimony regarding the defendant\u2019s sobriety.</p>\n<p id=\"b644-6\"><em>Improper opinion testimony. </em>The defendant first argues that Sergeant Moran erroneously was permitted to testify to his opinion that the defendant\u2019s ability to operate a motor vehicle safely had been impaired due to the consumption of alcohol. Moran first testified that the defendant had trouble spelling his own name, was confused about whether he lived in an apart<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"605\">*605</page-number>ment, misspelled his mother\u2019s name, and incorrectly stated his zip code. A series of questions from the prosecutor followed:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b645-5\">The prosecutor: \u201cAnd after those observations that you made about his physical appearance, the smell, and the statements, did you come to any conclusions about his level of sobriety?\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b645-6\">The witness: \u201cI did.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b645-7\">The prosecutor: \u201cAnd what conclusion did you come to?\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"Ak3\">The witness: \u201cI \u2014\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b645-8\">Defense counsel: \u201cObjection, Your Honor.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b645-9\">The court: \u201cI\u2019ll sustain it to the form of the question as opposed to a conclusion . . . .\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b645-10\">The prosecutor: \u201cWhat opinion did you form?\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b645-11\">The witness: \u201cI formed the opinion that he was intoxicated and that his ability to safely operate a motor vehicle had been impaired due to the consumption of an alcoholic beverage.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b645-12\">Defense counsel: \u201cObjection, Your Honor.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b645-13\">The court: \u201cWell, [even to] the rendering of the opinion, right, noted and overruled.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b645-14\">Counsel did not clarify the objection, and the trial proceeded.</p>\n<p id=\"b645-15\">The prosecutor\u2019s question was proper: the officer\u2019s opinion about the defendant\u2019s level of sobriety was admissible. The officer\u2019s additional response, including his opinion about the defendant\u2019s ability to drive safely and the cause of any impairment, was not admissible, because, in so responding, the officer spoke directly to one of the ultimate issues in the case. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Jones, </em>464 Mass. 16, 17 n.l (2012) (\u201cIn a prosecution for operating a motor vehicle while under the influence of alcohol, lay witnesses, including police officers, may not opine as to the ultimate question whether the defendant was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"606\">*606</page-number>operating while under the influence, but they may testify to his apparent intoxication\u201d); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Canty, </em>466 Mass. 535, 544 (2013) (\u201c[A] lay witness in a case charging operation of a motor vehicle while under the influence of alcohol may offer his opinion regarding a defendant\u2019s level of sobriety or intoxication but may not opine whether a defendant operated a motor vehicle under the influence of alcohol or whether the defendant\u2019s consumption of alcohol diminished his ability to operate a motor vehicle safely\u201d). See also <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Acosta, </em>81 Mass. App. Ct. 836, 842 n.10 (2012) (\u201cOpinion testimony may \u2018touch\u2019 on an ultimate issue in the case, <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Cruz, </em>413 Mass. 686, 690 [1992]; <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Cyr, </em>425 Mass. 89, 96 [1997], if couched in appropriate language, but an expert cannot directly speak to, or express a point-of-view about, the issue of the defendant\u2019s guilt or innocence. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Tanner, </em>45 Mass. App. Ct. 576, 579 [1998]. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Grisset, </em>66 Mass. App. Ct. 454, 457-458 [2006]\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b646-5\">In this case, however, defense counsel did not explain to the judge the basis for her objection, and looking at the context, it is clear that the judge understood the objection to go to the form of the question and to the fact that the officer\u2019s answer was harmful to the defendant.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> If, in fact, counsel intended to raise the issue of the officer\u2019s testimony addressing one of the ultimate issues, she should have brought that issue to the judge\u2019s attention in order to have it addressed at the time. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Marshall, </em>434 Mass. 358, 365 (2001). \u201cAs a general matter, timely objection at trial is required to preserve a claim of error in the admission of evidence.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Lenane, </em>80 Mass. App. Ct. 14, 19 (2011). \u201cThe purpose of requiring an objection is to afford the trial judge an opportunity to act promptly to remove from the [fact finder\u2019s] consideration evidence which has no place in the trial.\u201d <em>Ibid., </em>quoting from <em>Abraham </em>v. <em>Woburn, </em>383 Mass. 724, 726 n.l (1981). Nor did counsel move to strike the improper portion of the answer. Cf. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Stewart, </em>450 Mass. 25, 36 (2007). \u201cGenerally, we do not consider issues which were not preserved at trial.\u201d <em>Com</em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"607\">*607</page-number><em>monwealth </em>v. <em>Young, </em>401 Mass. 390, 404 (1987), citing <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Marchionda, </em>385 Mass. 238, 242 (1982). Unpreserved claims of error are reviewed only to determine if they created a \u201csubstantial risk of miscarriage of justice.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Freeman, </em>352 Mass. 556, 563-564 (1967). See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Lennon, </em>399 Mass. 443, 448 n.6 (1987); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Alphas, </em>430 Mass. 8, 13 (1999).</p>\n<p id=\"b647-5\">We are persuaded that there was no substantial risk of a miscarriage of justice here. The impermissible portion of the officer\u2019s testimony was very brief, and the Commonwealth\u2019s case was very strong. In our view, it is highly unlikely that the booking sergeant\u2019s opinion on the ultimate issue was a decisive factor in the judge\u2019s finding. \u201cA trial judge sitting without a jury is presumed, absent contrary indication, to have correctly instructed himself as to the manner in which evidence is to be considered in his role as a factfinder.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Batista, </em>53 Mass. App. Ct. 642, 648 (2002). See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Tanner, </em>45 Mass. App. Ct. 576, 580 (1998).</p>\n<p id=\"b647-6\"><em>Jury waiver, </em>a. <em>Background. </em>The defendant next argues that the judge\u2019s failure to conduct a second jury waiver colloquy or to procure a second written waiver from the defendant for the subsequent offense phase of the trial constitutes reversible error. Before the trial on the underlying offense began, the judge conducted a thorough colloquy with the defendant, explaining to him his right to have his case tried by a jury. In the colloquy, the judge began with the words, \u201cI understand you wish to give up your absolute right to have a jury trial <em>in this </em>case\u201d (emphasis added). The defendant submitted a written waiver, giving up his right to a jury trial. The waiver carried the docket number of the complaint. The complaint itself listed only one criminal charge along with two civil motor vehicle infractions.</p>\n<p id=\"b647-7\">Later that same day, after the judge found the defendant guilty of the underlying offense, the judge said to defense counsel, \u201cAnd how are we going to proceed next?\u201d Counsel responded, \u201cWe\u2019re going to do a bifurcated trial.\u201d The judge then inquired, \u201cAnd satisfied with the prior waiver with the gentleman?\u201d and counsel answered, \u201c[Y]es.\u201d What followed, the evidentiary portion of the subsequent offense phase of the trial, occupies six pages of transcript. The arresting officer was recalled <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"608\">*608</page-number>to the witness stand and asked to identify the defendant. The prosecutor then offered five exhibits, including a certified copy of a prior conviction record, asking to have it marked as an exhibit with a number.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> The judge, stressing that this part of the trial was a \u201cseparate proceeding\u201d from the trial on the underlying offense, explained that the document would be marked as an exhibit with a letter, rather than a number. There was no objection. The next exhibit, consisting of \u201ccertified records from the Registry of Motor Vehicles,\u201d was admitted after a brief argument on its admissibility on the ground that it violated the defendant\u2019s right of confrontation under the Sixth Amendment to the United States Constitution. See <em>Melendez-Diaz </em>v. <em>Massachusetts, </em>557 U.S. 305 (2009). Two more exhibits, certified copies of convictions under seal, from the Framingham and Waltham Divisions of the District Court Department, respectively, were admitted over the same objection. The final exhibit, a certified copy of a conviction from Florida, was also admitted over objection, along with a copy of the Florida statute governing operating while under the influence.</p>\n<p id=\"b648-5\">The judge then offered to take a recess so that defense counsel could consult with her client. After a time, when defense counsel stated that she was ready, both the prosecutor and defense counsel gave closing arguments. Defense counsel reiterated her Sixth Amendment objections and also noted what she alleged were various infirmities in the authentication of the documents offered. The judge responded with questions, and considerable exchange took place among both counsel and the judge, most of it relating to the admissibility of the documents. The judge then stated that he was satisfied that the Commonwealth had proved \u201cbeyond a reasonable doubt three prior admissions to or convictions for operating under the influence of alcohol or comparable offenses.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b648-6\">b. <em>Discussion. </em>\u201cUnder G. L. c. 278, \u00a7 11A, a defendant \u2018charged with a crime for which more severe punishment is provided for second and subsequent offenses\u2019 who pleads guilty or is found guilty after trial, \u2018shall be further inquired of for a plea of guilty or not guilty to that portion of the complaint. . . alleging that the crime charged is a second or subsequent of<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"609\">*609</page-number>fense\u2019 before sentence is imposed. If the defendant pleads not guilty, he is \u2018entitled to a trial by jury of the issue of conviction of a prior offense . . . [or] may waive trial by jury.\u2019 \u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Pelletier, </em>449 Mass. 392, 396 (2007). The statute states specifically that the trial on the issue of conviction of a prior offense is \u201csubject to all the provisions of law governing criminal trials.\u201d See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Kulesa, </em>455 Mass. 447, 457 (2009). \u201cThe statute, in other words, requires a defendant to be tried in a two-step, bifurcated procedure: \u2018first, on the underlying substantive crime and, then, in a separate proceeding, on that component of the charge referring to the crime as a second or subsequent offense.\u2019 \u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Pelletier, </em>449 Mass. 392, 396 (2007), quoting from <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Miranda, </em>441 Mass. 783, 788 (2004). The same bifurcated proceeding takes place \u201cwhen a defendant pleads guilty to the underlying offense, the difference being that the first step is a plea hearing, rather than a trial.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Pelletier, supra.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b649-7\">The issue here is what is required of the judge when the defendant wishes a trial in both phases of the bifurcated proceeding, but waives his right to a jury. There are no reported cases directly on point. We are guided, however, by the reasoning of the Supreme Judicial Court in <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Pelletier, supra, </em>and by our own analysis in <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Hernandez, </em>42 Mass. App. Ct. 780 (1997). In <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Pelletier, supra </em>at 397-398, the court stated, \u201cWhere a defendant is pleading guilty, we do not read the statute as requiring that a judge conduct an entirely new plea colloquy during the second step of the bifurcated proceeding. The preliminary questioning conducted at the outset of the plea hearing on the underlying offense need not be repeated, so long as the judge makes clear, and the defendant understands, that the preliminary questioning applies equally to the plea on the subsequent offense portion of the charge as well.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b649-9\">In <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Hernandez, supra, </em>there were in fact two separate trials, on two separate complaints, where each complaint charged the defendant with possession with intent to distribute a class A substance and with distribution of a class A substance within 1,000 feet of a school. See <em>id. </em>at 781. Under <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"610\">*610</page-number>all the circumstances of that case,<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> we were satisfied that one colloquy at the outset was adequate to preserve the defendant\u2019s rights. <em>Id. </em>at 786 (\u201cIt is clear from this record that the colloquy between the judge and the defendant referred to the jury waivers in <em>both </em>trials\u201d). As we observed in <em>Hernandez, </em>to require a colloquy and written waiver prior to each proceeding \u201cwould elevate form over substance.\u201d <em>Ibid. </em>In the present case, there was one trial and one charge, split into two components only because the prior offenses related solely to the penalty phase of the trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b650-5\">We also have in mind that the initial colloquy was complete and the defendant does not challenge it. At the end of the first phase of the trial, the judge inquired about the second phase and the jury waiver. In response, counsel explicitly waived the jury for that second part of the trial. We are satisfied that this procedure was adequate to safeguard the defendant\u2019s rights in this case.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b650-6\">Moreover, the defendant here did not file a motion for a new trial and presented nothing, in affidavit form or otherwise, to indicate that he did not understand that he had a right to a jury trial on the subsequent offense portion of the charge, or that he would have chosen such a trial, or what he might have hoped to accomplish in such a trial. It is difficult to see that a jury trial might have made a difference for him. The nature of the subsequent offense portion of the trial that took place, which was largely a legal argument about the rules of evidence and the defendant\u2019s Sixth Amendment right to confrontation, would not have lent itself to credibility or other arguments one would expect to make to a jury. Therefore, even if there was error, we are persuaded that it was harmless beyond a reasonable doubt. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Nwachukwu, </em>65 Mass. App. Ct. 112, 118-119 (2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b650-7\">The published cases cited by the defendant do not help him. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"611\">*611</page-number>In <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Dussault, </em>71 Mass. App. Ct. 542, 543 (2008), in the initial phase of the trial, a <em>jury </em>found the defendant guilty of operating a motor vehicle while under the influence of intoxicating liquor. Thereafter, the judge failed to conduct a jury waiver colloquy or to procure a written waiver from the defendant for the subsequent offense portion of the trial, which was to be jury-waived. <em>Id. </em>at 547. In <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Zuzick, </em>45 Mass. App. Ct. 71, 73 (1998), we determined that there was \u201cno trial, either before a jury or the judge on [the subsequent offense] portion of the complaint.\u201d Neither <em>Ciummei </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>378 Mass. 504, 504-505 (1979), nor <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Pavao, </em>423 Mass. 798, 801-802 (1996), is applicable to the facts of this case, as neither involved a so-called bifurcated trial, and in neither case was there any colloquy at all.</p>\n<p id=\"b651-5\">\n<em>Judgment affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b644-7\">The Commonwealth moved to amend the complaint to reduce the fifth offense charge to a fourth offense, and the motion was allowed.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b646-6\">Defense counsel had objected earlier when Scichilone was asked to give an opinion about the defendant\u2019s sobriety.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b648-7\">None of the exhibits is included in the record before this court, and the defendant raises no issue as to any of them.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b650-8\">One trial immediately followed the other, and the first trial was very short. <em>Id. </em>at 786.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b650-9\">In the future, the better practice would be to require an explicit acknowledgment on the record from the defendant that he understands that he has a right to a trial by jury in each part of the bifurcated trial, and that he understands that he is waiving that jury trial right for both parts.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
