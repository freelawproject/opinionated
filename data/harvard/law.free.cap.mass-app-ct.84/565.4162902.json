Regs. \u00a7 3.03(3) (1999), should be applied to bar certain claims of Harvard University (Harvard), a self-insurer, for reimbursement of cost of living adjustments (COLA) from the Workers\u2019 Compensation Trust Fund (Fund), pursuant to G. L. c. 152, \u00a7 34B, as amended <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"566\">*566</page-number>by St. 1991, c. 398, \u00a7 61. The Fund appeals from a decision of the department\u2019s reviewing board (board), declining to enforce the regulation. We reverse the board\u2019s decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b606-4\"><em>Background. </em>General Laws c. 152, \u00a7 34B, provides that any person receiving workers\u2019 compensation benefits under G. L. c. 152, \u00a7 31 or \u00a7 34A, also receive an additional benefit in an amount intended to protect the employee from the effects of inflation. See <em>Sliski\u2019s Case, </em>424 Mass. 126, 135 (1997). The statute requires that insurers pay these COLA supplemental benefits (COLA benefits) concurrently with the employee\u2019s base benefits. Relevant here, insurers paying COLA benefits to employees whose injuries occurred on or before October 1, 1986, are entitled to be reimbursed for those amounts from the Fund, so long as the insured employer participates in the assessment provisions that supply the revenues for the Fund, pursuant to G. L. c. 152, \u00a7 65.</p>\n<p id=\"b606-5\">On July 22, 2010, Harvard filed claims seeking reimbursement from the Fund for COLA benefits it paid to five employees, Francis Beatty, Maria Carvalho, Adolphus Gordon, Helena Raposo, and Francis Yebba, from July 1, 2005, through June 30, 2010. The Fund denied Harvard\u2019s claims for reimbursement for COLA benefits Harvard paid from July 1, 2005, through July 21, 2008, as those payments were made more than two years before Harvard filed its claims for reimbursement. A department regulation, 452 Code Mass. Regs. \u00a7 3.03(3) (regulation), provided for reimbursement only for petitions made within two years of the date the payment of COLA benefits was due. The Fund did reimburse Harvard for COLA benefits paid from July 21, 2008, through June 30, 2010, as they fell within the two-year limitations period.</p>\n<p id=\"b606-6\">Harvard appealed, and an administrative judge sided with the Fund, finding that the two-year limitations period had a rational purpose \u2014 to ensure timely payments of COLA benefits and to protect the integrity of the Fund and its budget process from stale claims. The board reversed, ruling that the Fund was not charged with policing the prompt payment of COLA benefits, that the Fund has not consistently applied the two-year limitations period, and that the only entity that benefited from the regulation was the Fund itself. The Fund and Harvard filed <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"567\">*567</page-number>cross appeals for judicial review, pursuant to G. L. c. 152, \u00a7 12(2).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b607-6\"><em>Discussion. </em>Harvard, as the party challenging a properly promulgated regulation, bears the heavy burden of showing \u201cthat the regulation has no rational relationship to the goals or policies of the agency\u2019s enabling statute.\u201d <em>Miller </em>v. <em>Labor Relations Commn., </em>33 Mass. App. Ct. 404, 407 (1992). However, \u201c[t]he board, as the agency charged with administering the workers\u2019 compensation law, is entitled to substantial deference in its reasonable interpretation of the statute.\u201d <em>Sikorski\u2019s Case, </em>455 Mass. 477, 480 (2009). While \u201c[w]e will not substitute our judgment for that of [the board] if its interpretation of a statute is reasonable,\u201d <em>Alves\u2019s Case, </em>451 Mass. 171, 177 (2008), \u201cthis principle is one of deference, not abdication.\u201d <em>Leopoldstadt, Inc. </em>v. <em>Commissioner of the Div. of Health Care Fin. &amp; Policy, </em>436 Mass. 80, 91 (2002), quoting from <em>Protective Life Ins. Co. </em>v. <em>Sullivan, </em>425 Mass. 615, 618 (1997).</p>\n<p id=\"b607-7\">The question, then, is whether the board was reasonable in its determination that the regulation\u2019s two-year limitations period \u201cserves no rational purpose within the ambit of [G. L. c. 152, \u00a7 34B].\u201d Our analysis \u201cemploy[s] a two-part test to assess the validity of an administrative agency\u2019s properly promulgated regulation.\u201d <em>Massachusetts Teachers\u2019 Retirement Sys. </em>v. <em>Contributory Retirement Appeal Bd., </em>466 Mass. 292, 297 (2013). First, we consider whether the statute is unambiguous, and if it is, \u201cwe give effect to the Legislature\u2019s intent.\u201d <em>Ibid., </em>quoting from <em>Goldberg </em>v. <em>Board of Health of Granby, </em>444 Mass. 627, 632-633 (2005). \u201cSecond, if the Legislature has not addressed directly the pertinent issue, we determine whether the agency\u2019s resolution of that issue may \u2018be reconciled with the governing legislation.\u2019 \u201d <em>Ibid.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b607-8\">We begin with the language of the statute. General Laws c. 152, \u00a7 34B, requires that death and disability benefits be supplemented with a COLA benefit, to be paid concurrently and without the need for application by the recipient. Section 34B(c) sets out the insurer\u2019s right to reimbursement for COLA benefits and contains no time limit for the insurer to file a claim <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"568\">*568</page-number>for COLA reimbursement. Where the statute makes no reference to a limitations period, we consider \u201cwhether there is anything in the statute or its legislative history that indicates an express or implied legislative intent that such [actions] are not time limited.\u201d <em>State Bd. of Retirement </em>v. <em>Woodward, </em>446 Mass. 698, 707 (2006). See <em>Nantucket </em>v. <em>Beinecke, </em>379 Mass. 345, 348 (1979) (if Legislature had intended that actions not be time-limited, it would be natural for such intent to be expressed in statute).</p>\n<p id=\"b608-5\">Harvard maintains that use of the word \u201cshall\u201d in \u00a7 34B(c), providing that \u201c[i]nsurers shall be entitled to quarterly reimbursements for supplemental benefits,\u201d evinces a legislative intent that insurers are to receive COLA reimbursements without time limits. The phrases \u201cin no event\u201d and \u201cunder no circumstances\u201d have been so construed. See <em>State Bd. of Retirement </em>v. <em>Woodward, </em>446 Mass, at 708. But we are not persuaded that \u201cshall,\u201d in this context, signifies an unqualified right to reimbursement. Compare <em>Taylor\u2019s Case, </em>44 Mass. App. Ct. 495, 499 (1998).<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Section 34B(c) goes on to narrow the right to reimbursement by the date of injury and by the employer\u2019s participation in the Fund. In addition, \u00a7 34B(c) specifically links the insurer\u2019s entitlement to reimbursement to G. L. c. 152, \u00a7 65, inserted by St. 1991, c. 398, \u00a7 85, which sets out the funding mechanism for such reimbursements and imposes further requirements and restrictions on employers seeking to avail themselves of the Fund. See <em>E.I. Dupont de Nemours &amp; Co. </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>65 Mass. App. Ct. 350, 352 (2005). We therefore do not construe the express language of \u00a7 34B, in and of itself, as prohibiting the department from imposing time restrictions on COLA reimbursement claims. See <em>Goldberg </em>v. <em>Board of Health of Granby, </em>444 Mass, at 633, quoting from <em>Berrios </em>v. <em>Department of Pub. Welfare, </em>411 Mass. 587, 595-596 (1992) (agency \u201c \u2018has considerable leeway in interpreting a statute it is charged with enforcing\u2019 unless a statute unambiguously bars the agency\u2019s approach\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b609-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"569\">*569</page-number>We next consider whether the two-year limitations period can be reconciled with the statute\u2019s underlying purpose. See <em>Smith </em>v. <em>Commissioner of Transitional Assistance, </em>431 Mass. 638, 646 (2000); <em>Goldberg </em>v. <em>Board of Health of Granby, </em>444 Mass, at 633. As noted, G. L. c. 152, \u00a7 34B, calls for COLA benefits to be paid without application by the recipient and concurrently with the recipient\u2019s base benefits. It also entitles insurers to quarterly COLA reimbursements. Prompt payment and reimbursement of COLA benefits is plainly contemplated. Moreover, since the insurer\u2019s right to reimbursement in \u00a7 34B(c) is explicitly tied to c. 152, \u00a7 65, we read them together. See <em>E.I. Dupont de Nemours &amp; Co. </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>65 Mass. App. Ct. at 353-354 (interpretation of when entitlement to reimbursement ends was supported by manner in which Fund is financed).</p>\n<p id=\"b609-4\">General Laws c. 152, \u00a7 65, delineates, among other things, the process by which the Fund is to assess amounts to be paid into the Fund by participating employers. In particular, \u00a7 65 requires the department to establish the Fund\u2019s budget based on the department\u2019s annual estimates, made on or before July 1 of each year, of \u201cthe total amount of funds required to make payments during the following twelve months for the compensation payable pursuant to subsection (2) of this section.\u201d G. L. c. 152, \u00a7 65(4)(b).<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> It is the employer assessments that provide the Fund\u2019s revenue, and these are calculated annually, based on the losses paid by the participating employers in the preceding year, as reported to the department by May 1 of each year. G. L. c. 152, \u00a7 65(2), (3). As a consequence, an employer who chooses not to participate in the Fund must give its notice of nonparticipation by March 1, so that it will not be included in the assessments for the next year\u2019s funding. See <em>E.I. Dupont de Nemours &amp; Co. </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>65 Mass. App. Ct. at 354. This method of annual budgetary estimate based on anticipated reimbursements is the reason we have described the Fund as a \u201cpay-as-you-go\u201d system. <em>Id. </em>at 355.</p>\n<p id=\"b610-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"570\">*570</page-number>The department\u2019s stated reasons for promulgating the two-year limitations period in 452 Code Mass. Regs. \u00a7 3.03 were to avoid claims for COLA reimbursements more than two years from the date the COLA benefits were due, \u201cand to avoid prejudice to employers in the application of their assessments for reimbursement of claims.\u201d Hence, eliminating older reimbursement claims was intended to further the statutory goal of maintaining the Fund\u2019s pay-as-you-go design or, as the administrative judge put it, of protecting the integrity of the Fund and its budget process from stale claims and the risk of a shortfall. We think G. L. c. 152, \u00a7\u00a7 34B and 65, taken together, evince a clear legislative intent that the department is charged with administering the Fund and providing COLA reimbursements in a manner that promotes prompt payment, accuracy, and fairness in the budgetary and assessment process.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> See, e.g., <em>ibid, </em>(employer\u2019s election not to participate in Fund is irrevocable, thereby precluding reengagement in reimbursement mechanism).</p>\n<p id=\"b610-5\">This statutory purpose is to be contrasted with G. L. c. 152, \u00a7 37, addressed in <em>Alves\u2019s Case, </em>451 Mass. 171, on which Harvard relies. Section 37 provides for reimbursement for portions of workers\u2019 compensation benefits paid to reinjured employees and, as of 1991, imposes a two-year statute of limitations on reimbursement claims for injuries occurring after 1991. In <em>Alves\u2019s Case, </em>the Supreme Judicial Court declined to apply the two-year statute of limitations to the pre-1991 version of \u00a7 37 to bar the self-insurer\u2019s claim for reimbursement for benefits paid to an employee injured before 1991. <em>Id. </em>at 173-180. The court relied principally on express statutory language that the 1991 amendments were to apply prospectively. <em>Id. </em>at 172, 178-179. But also deemed significant was the purpose of \u00a7 37, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"571\">*571</page-number>which was to encourage employers to rehire injured workers, and the court reasoned that barring older reimbursement claims would undercut the incentive intended by the statute. <em>Id. </em>at 179. The case has limited application here, as \u00a7 34B mandates timely payment and reporting of COLA benefits, with the plain purpose of protecting benefit recipients against inflation and the pay-as-you-go design of the Fund\u2019s budgetary and assessment process. Wholly absent is the need to provide incentive to employers to participate by allowing stale COLA reimbursement claims to linger.</p>\n<p id=\"b611-5\">Harvard suggests, as did the board, that a procedure exists for funding older COLA reimbursement claims that were not included in the Fund\u2019s annual budget estimate and that result in a budget shortfall. General Laws c. 152, \u00a7 65(4)(c), permits the department to levy additional assessments against employers in order to raise revenues where claims exceed budget estimates within a given year.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> Harvard points to this option as eliminating the justification for imposing a time limit on filing COLA reimbursement claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b611-6\">In our view, levying additional assessments to fund stale COLA reimbursement claims places an unintended and wholly unnecessary burden on participating employers. It poses uncertainty and inconvenience on employers required to pay unanticipated assessments, over and above those levied annually. It also imposes needless administrative costs associated with developing supplemental budgets and obtaining supplemental funding, costs that may be borne by the participating employers that provide the Fund\u2019s revenues. G. L. c. 152, \u00a7 65(2).<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> Indeed, the board\u2019s observation that only the Fund benefits from the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"572\">*572</page-number>two-year limitations period appears to overlook the fact that it is the participating employers that in fact derive the benefit, as they are the source of the Fund\u2019s revenues and administrative costs.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b612-5\">In light of the Fund\u2019s statutory framework, we think it an appropriate function of the department to ensure that participating employers are assessed accurately and fairly, on an annual basis, in furtherance of the pay-as-you-go system intended by the Legislature, and to avoid uncertainty and needless administrative costs associated with supplementing the budget and levying additional assessments to pay stale claims in the event of a shortfall. A two-year limitations period strikes a reasonable balance between the insurer\u2019s entitlement to COLA reimbursement and the department\u2019s responsibility to estimate the Fund\u2019s budget on an annual basis and to levy assessments and administer benefits promptly and accurately. See, e.g., <em>Doe </em>v. <em>Harbor Schs., Inc., </em>446 Mass. 245, 256 (2006) (statutes of limitations \u201crepresent society\u2019s considered, although often far from perfect, compromise between\u201d plaintiffs\u2019 rights and society\u2019s need for finality). In accordance with G. L. c. 152, \u00a7 5, which instructs that the Commissioner of the department \u201cshall promulgate rules and regulations consistent with this chapter for carrying out the functions of the department,\u201d we believe the two-year limitations period serves as a considered compromise to further the intent of the statute and its funding mechanism, and presents \u201ca reasonable resolution of the [statute\u2019s] silence.\u201d <em>Massachusetts Teachers\u2019 Retirement Sys. </em>v. <em>Contributory Retirement Appeal Bd., </em>466 Mass, at 302.</p>\n<p id=\"b612-6\">The legislative history concerning the two-year limitations period confirms our view. In 1988, the department promulgated a regulation, 452 Code Mass. Regs. \u00a7 3.06 (1988), that imposed a two-year limitations period for COLA reimbursement claims. The 1988 version differed from the current regulation only in that the two years accrued from the date the COLA benefit was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"573\">*573</page-number>paid, rather than the date the benefit was due. The current form of the regulation, 452 Code Mass. Regs. \u00a7 3.03(3), became effective in 1999. In the interim, the Legislature amended the workers\u2019 compensation statute in 1991, see <em>Sliski\u2019s Case, </em>424 Mass, at 129-130, but did so without addressing the earlier regulation\u2019s two-year limitations period for COLA reimbursement claims. We may imply legislative intent from the fact that a two-year limitations period was in effect when the Legislature revisited \u00a7 34B, and took no steps to prohibit its application.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> See <em>Harborview Residents\u2019 Comm., Inc. </em>v. <em>Quincy Hous. Authy., </em>368 Mass. 425, 432 (1975); <em>Falmouth </em>v. <em>Civil Serv. Commn., </em>447 Mass. 814, 820 n.8 (2006); <em>Pavian, Inc. </em>v. <em>Hickey, </em>452 Mass. 490, 494 (2008).</p>\n<p id=\"b613-5\">Based on the foregoing, we determine that the two-year limitations period set forth in 452 Code Mass. Regs. \u00a7 3.03(3) is rationally related to the purpose of G. L. c. 152, \u00a7 34B, and should be applied to the COLA reimbursement claims in this case. While we understand the board\u2019s motivation to resolve the otherwise meritorious claims on essentially equitable principles, we conclude that its decision is inconsistent with the statute and regulation, and that the analysis of the administrative judge was essentially correct. Accordingly, the decision of the board is reversed.</p>\n<p id=\"b613-6\">\n<em>So ordered.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b607-9\">Harvard\u2019s appeal concerns the application of interest to its claims for COLA reimbursement, an issue we need not reach in light of our decision.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b608-6\">We note that \u201cshall\u201d is also used in G.
