After a grand jury witness, the victim\u2019s mother, admitted to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"644\">*644</page-number>fabricating her identification of the defendants as the perpetrators of the crime, a judge allowed the defendants\u2019 motions to dismiss the indictments without prejudice. The Commonwealth now appeals from the order allowing the motions to dismiss, claiming that the judge erred in ruling that the presentation of the witness\u2019s false identification impaired the integrity of the grand jury proceedings. Although we conclude that the judge committed no error in his assessment of the Commonwealth\u2019s conduct in presenting the evidence to the grand jury, we reverse because the evidence was otherwise sufficient to sustain the indictments.</p>\n<p id=\"b684-5\">1. <em>Background. </em>On November 20,2003, Alberto \u201cTito\u201d Gonzalez was killed by shots fired from a passing motor vehicle in New Bedford. In the immediate aftermath of the crime, the police investigation identified the defendants as possible suspects. The Bristol County district attorney, however, declined to present the case against these defendants (hereinafter, the Gonzalez case) to a grand jury. Almost five years later, a newly elected district attorney presented the Gonzalez case to three successive grand juries,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> culminating on January 23, 2009, in indictments of the defendants for murder in the first degree and carrying a firearm without a license.</p>\n<p id=\"b684-6\">On the eve of trial, the Commonwealth learned that Fernanda Gonzalez, the victim\u2019s mother, had fabricated her grand jury testimony identifying Pittman as the person who shot her son and Hunt as an accomplice. In accordance with established law,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> the Commonwealth promptly disclosed the witness\u2019s false statements to the court and the defendants. In response, the defendants filed motions to dismiss the indictments with prejudice, claiming that prosecutorial misconduct in the presentation of the false identification testimony impaired the integrity of the grand jury proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b684-7\">After a lengthy evidentiary hearing on the motions to dismiss, the judge allowed the motions without prejudice on the grounds <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"645\">*645</page-number>that the Commonwealth \u201cproceeded with reckless disregard for the truth of the identification evidence\u201d and that the false identification testimony \u201cprobably influenced the decision to indict.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b685-5\">Our analysis of the issues raised by the Commonwealth\u2019s appeal is informed by the evidence presented to the grand jury and to the judge at the hearing on the motions to dismiss. The following is a summary of the evidence presented at both proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b685-6\">a. <em>The grand jury testimony. </em>On November 20, 2003, at approximately 6:00 p.m., the victim, Alberto \u201cTito\u201d Gonzalez (Tito), was shot from a passing motor vehicle at the comer of Hillman and Spmce Streets in New Bedford. Fernanda Gonzalez (Fernanda), Tito\u2019s mother, was unloading groceries in front of her home on Spmce Street when the shooting occurred. Tito had just left their home to visit a neighbor who also lived on Spruce Street. As Tito walked in a northerly direction across Hillman Street, Fernanda observed a dark-colored vehicle turn right from Spruce Street onto Hillman Street. As the vehicle made the turn, she heard shots and observed that someone in the vehicle was firing at Tito. Tito bent over at the waist, stumbled a bit, and ran up Hillman Street. As he did so, he yelled at her to go into the house. She watched until Tito disappeared from sight as the vehicle pursued him up Hillman Street.</p>\n<p id=\"b685-7\">The police arrived on the scene within minutes after the shooting. They searched the area for Tito but were unable to locate him or find any evidence that a shooting had occurred. After the police left, Tito\u2019s family and friends organized a search of the neighborhood. At or around 8:00 p.m., almost two hours after the shooting, one of Tito\u2019s friends found Tito\u2019s body in the backyard of a residence on Hillman Street. He had suffered a fatal gunshot wound.</p>\n<p id=\"b685-8\">Later that night, a team of police officers from the New Bed-ford police department and the State police returned to the area to begin their investigation into the shooting. Their first lead came from an area resident who told them he had heard shots and had looked toward Hillman Street, where he saw a dark blue or green Ford Focus automobile racing up the street. This person also told the police that the driver was a black male <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"646\">*646</page-number>wearing a black \u201cdoo rag.\u201d He was unable to see the driver\u2019s face or whether other individuals were in the vehicle.</p>\n<p id=\"b686-5\">In their interviews with Tito\u2019s family and friends that night, the police elicited information suggesting a motive for the shooting and the possible identity of the perpetrators. The police were told that on October 19, 2003, a month prior to the shooting, Tito and some of his friends had been involved in a brawl at a local restaurant. The combatants were two groups of individuals, one group associated with Tito and the other with the defendants. During the fracas, Hunt suffered a serious head injury and was said to be angry and bent on taking revenge. Pittman, also present that night, was angry because of the injury to Hunt, his associate.</p>\n<p id=\"b686-6\">Prior to the fight, Pittman and Tito had been friendly; after the fight, their relationship became hostile. Pittman was also upset with Tito because he heard that Tito was bragging that his group had gotten the better of Pittman\u2019s group. Tito stopped associating with Pittman, and he told his friends he was afraid of Pittman and his group.</p>\n<p id=\"b686-7\">The hostilities continued into the weeks leading up to the shooting. Two days after the fight, Pittman, Hunt, and some of their fiends went to a house frequented by Tito and his fiends. The owner of the house, the sister of one of the combatants on Tito\u2019s side, refused to open the door and threatened to call the police. Pittman and his group left. Tito became aware of Pittman\u2019 s presence and ran out of the back door to avoid a confrontation.</p>\n<p id=\"b686-8\">After the fight, but before the shooting, Hunt went by Tito\u2019s house. He accosted Tito\u2019s downstairs neighbor, mistaking him for Tito. Hunt told the neighbor that he should tell Tito that he (Hunt) was coming back to get him. Because of this and other threats, one of Tito\u2019s friends gave Tito a gun for protection.</p>\n<p id=\"b686-9\">Members of the Gonzalez family and other individuals implicated the defendants more directly in testimony about events occurring on November 20, 2003, the day of the shooting. In the early afternoon of that day, Tito and some of his friends were visiting with another friend, who lived just up the street from Tito\u2019s residence. At or around 5:00 p.m., Tito received a call on his mobile telephone (mobile phone) from Pittman and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"647\">*647</page-number>several of his associates. Tito activated the speaker so that his friends could hear the conversation. They heard a voice, identified by Tito as that of Pittman, tell Tito that today was the day he was going to die. Pittman also warned Tito to \u201cbring your heater [gun] home with you tonight because we are going to kill you.\u201d Tito was told to come to the Bullard Street area where Pittman and his associates congregated and that if he did not do so, the group would go to his mother\u2019s house to get him. The shooting occurred just an hour or so later near Tito\u2019s residence.</p>\n<p id=\"b687-4\">After the shooting, Pittman called Tito\u2019s mobile phone while the family was still at the hospital. There was evidence before the grand jury that Pittman taunted Tito\u2019s sister about what had just happened to Tito, asking, \u201cHow do you feel now that he\u2019s dead? How does it feel that he is dead, that we killed him?\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b687-5\">In the hour after the shooting, Pittman, Hunt, and a third man, known to the police as Rakeem \u201cTy\u201d Wallace, appeared at the third-floor apartment of Corey Hubbard, one of their associates. They arrived in a dark-colored Ford Focus. The driver parked the vehicle in a concealed location near the apartment. Hubbard\u2019s second-floor neighbor heard loud footsteps headed to Hubbard\u2019s apartment and decided to go upstairs to see what was happening. Hunt had a gun in his hand. All of the men appeared to be nervous and scared.</p>\n<p id=\"b687-6\">During the conversation after the neighbor\u2019s arrival, Hunt implicated himself in the shooting, volunteering that he had to \u201cget out of here\u201d because \u201cwe\u201d \u201cjust took out the kid.\u201d There was evidence before the grand jury that Hunt said that they shot Tito \u201c[f]rom the car\u201d and that he (Hunt) had been driving. There was also evidence that Hunt handed the gun and the car keys to Hubbard, ordering him to get rid of the gun and clean out the vehicle. Hubbard then handed the car keys to the second-floor neighbor, who took the vehicle to a car wash and vacuumed up a shell casing he found in the back seat area. There was evidence, based on a police officer\u2019s notes from an interview, that later Hubbard wrapped the gun in a sock, tied it to a brick, and threw it into the ocean.</p>\n<p id=\"b687-8\">Within a few days of the shooting, the police linked Hunt to the Ford Focus seen leaving the scene of the shooting. They <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"648\">*648</page-number>learned that Hunt had rented a blue Ford Focus from a local car dealer, and that the vehicle had not been returned after the shooting. After the police issued a BOLO (\u201cBe On the Lookout\u201d) bulletin for the vehicle, a police officer spotted it at a gasoline station in Taunton. Hubbard, in whose apartment the defendants gathered in the immediate aftermath of the shooting, was operating the vehicle. A search of the vehicle revealed a black \u201cdoo rag\u201d in the center console and a spent shell casing inside the pocket of the front passenger side door. Investigators also discovered Pittman\u2019s fingerprints in the vehicle, as well as an electricity bill in Hunt\u2019s name, a receipt from the rental car company in his name, and a piece of mail addressed to him.</p>\n<p id=\"b688-4\">The prosecutor presented Fernanda as the only eyewitness to the shooting.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> She testified that she recognized Pittman as the person in the front passenger seat of the vehicle from which the shots had been fired. She said that she saw Pittman put his head outside the vehicle and fire a gun at her son. She also testified that she recognized Hunt as the passenger in the back seat of the vehicle.</p>\n<p id=\"AzQO\">For the purposes of our analysis, we note here, as the judge did in his findings, the factual gaps in the Commonwealth\u2019s presentation of Fernanda\u2019s identification testimony to the grand jury. The prosecutor presented her testimony without a single direct reference to her statement to police investigators on the night of the shooting that she could not identify the perpetrators.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Instead, the Commonwealth provided only the transcript and video recording of Fernanda\u2019s interview with New Bedford police Detective Gary Beaudoin, who recorded her statement that she <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"649\">*649</page-number>could now identify the perpetrators.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> The grand jury were left to review the video recording and transcript of that interview to grasp what they had not been told directly.</p>\n<p id=\"b689-5\">Apart from the failure to make any direct reference to Fernanda\u2019s earlier statement, the prosecutor also posed a carefully crafted question to Trooper Ann Marie Robertson, the State police investigator assigned to the case:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b689-6\"><em>Q.: </em>\u201cAnd, Ms. Gonzalez, Tito\u2019s mother, she was interviewed, obviously, the night of the shooting and had indicated or had come back for a further interview later on where she identified an individual she believed to be the shooter in the case; is that true?\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b689-7\">A.: \u201cThat is true.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b689-8\">This question and answer artfully dodged revelation of Fernanda\u2019s prior inconsistent statement on the night of the shooting that she could not identify the perpetrators, and created the impression that Fernanda never had wavered in her identification of the defendants.</p>\n<p id=\"b689-9\">b. <em>The motion to dismiss hearing. </em>We summarize the hearing evidence, keeping in mind that our task is to determine whether the judge erred in ruling that the prosecutor presented Fernanda\u2019s identification testimony with reckless disregard for the truth and that this lapse impaired the grand jury proceedings. The police first became aware of Fernanda\u2019s new claim that she could identify the perpetrators on February 14, 2004, some three months after the shooting. She appeared at the New Bed-ford police department, where she spoke to Beaudoin, the lead investigator in the case. Fernanda told him that she now remembered that Pittman was the person who shot her son. She claimed that she saw Pittman lean his body out of the car and fire shots at Tito. She explained her ability to provide this new information by claiming that she realized that Pittman was the person who had shot her son when, in January, 2004, she saw his image on television in connection with his court appearance in another matter. She described to Beaudoin how she had visited <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"650\">*650</page-number>the court on January 23, 2004, the day when Pittman was scheduled to appear, and that she had said to him, \u201cYou killed my boy.\u201d When confronted, Pittman denied any involvement in her son\u2019s death.</p>\n<p id=\"b690-5\">On February 14, 2004, she viewed a six-person photographic array and selected Pittman\u2019s photograph. Three days later, on February 17, 2004, Beaudoin interviewed Fernanda again and recorded her statement on video. Beaudoin doubted the veracity of Fernanda\u2019s claim that she had seen Pittman shoot her son. Beaudoin communicated his reservations to the assistant district attorney in charge of the case at that time. Although the crime involved an alleged murder with a purported eyewitness, the district attorney declined to open a grand jury investigation.</p>\n<p id=\"b690-6\">Prior to the presentment of the Gonzalez case to the grand jury in June, 2008, the district attorney\u2019s newly formed \u201ccold case\u201d prosecution team<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> received the entire investigative file on the Gonzalez shooting and had access to the original investigators and their reports. The prosecutor was aware, therefore, of Fernanda\u2019s original statement, her motivation to secure the defendants\u2019 arrest,<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> the investigators\u2019 concerns about the credibility of this new identification, and the prior district attorney\u2019s decision not to present the case to the grand jury. Nonetheless, the prosecutor took no steps to vet the plausibility or credibility of Fernanda\u2019s proposed grand jury testimony before presenting it to the jury. The witness preparation session on the eve of the hearing on Pittman\u2019s motion to suppress Fernanda\u2019s identification was the first time she was asked to explain how she saw what she now claimed to have seen on the night of the shooting.</p>\n<p id=\"b690-7\">2. <em>Discussion. </em>\u201cAlthough generally the adequacy or competency of evidence before a grand jury is not a matter for judicial inquiry . . . , we will consider whether the evidence before the grand jury was sufficient to support a finding of probable cause <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"651\">*651</page-number>. . . and whether the defendant has shown that the integrity of the grand jury proceedings was impaired . . . <em>.\u2019\u2019Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Mayfield, </em>398 Mass. 615, 619-620 (1986), and cases cited. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>O\u2019Dell, </em>392 Mass. 445, 446-447, 449-450 (1984). A motion to dismiss on this ground may be allowed only on a showing that (1) false or deceptive evidence was offered knowingly or with \u201creckless disregard of the truth\u201d of that evidence, <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Mayfield, supra </em>at 621; (2) the false evidence \u201cprobably influenced\u201d the grand jury\u2019s decision to indict; and (3) the evidence was presented with the intention of obtaining an indictment (hereinafter, the <em>Mayfield </em>factors). <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Silva, </em>455 Mass. 503, 509 (2009), citing <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Mayfield, supra </em>at 620-622.</p>\n<p id=\"b691-4\">In a thoughtful and carefully considered decision, the judge found and ruled that the prosecutor presented false and deceptive evidence to the grand jury, that the prosecutor did so as a consequence of a \u201creckless disregard for the truth,\u201d<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> and that this lapse impaired the integrity of the grand jury proceedings. In reviewing a decision of a motion judge after hearing on a motion to dismiss brought pursuant to <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>O\u2019Dell, supra, </em>\u201cwe accept the judge\u2019s subsidiary findings of fact absent clear error \u2018but conduct an independent review of his ultimate findings and conclusions of law.\u2019 \u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Scott, </em>440 Mass. 642, 646 (2004), quoting from <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Jimenez, </em>438 Mass. 213, 218 (2002). As the Commonwealth claims error only in the judge\u2019s findings and rulings on the first two <em>Mayfield </em>factors, we limit our discussion accordingly.</p>\n<p id=\"b691-5\">a. <em>Presentation of false or deceptive testimony. </em>As explained below, the judge\u2019s findings and rulings on the first factor \u2014 the presentation of false or deceptive evidence with \u201creckless disregard for the truth\u201d \u2014 are unimpeachable. Nonetheless, we describe the Commonwealth\u2019s missteps in some detail so as to give guidance on unintentional conduct that may run afoul of this prong of the <em>Mayfield </em>test.</p>\n<p id=\"b692-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"652\">*652</page-number>As to this first <em>Mayfield </em>factor, the judge cited two reasons for his ruling that the presentation of Fernanda\u2019s false and deceptive testimony was the product of a reckless disregard for the truth: (1) the prosecutor was aware of but omitted any direct reference to Fernanda\u2019s prior exculpatory statement that she could not identify the perpetrators; and (2) the prosecutor presented Fernanda\u2019s identification without qualification, despite compelling reasons to doubt the credibility of her claim. We conclude that there was no error in the judge\u2019s findings and rulings on this factor. The falsity of Fernanda\u2019s testimony is not open to question given the Commonwealth\u2019s admission of this fact in its disclosure to the defendants and the court.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> The judge could hardly find otherwise. Nor was there error in the judge\u2019s finding that the particular presentation of Fernanda\u2019s identification testimony, without the qualification of her earlier inconsistent statement, was deceptive. The judge properly could find, as he did, that the omission of a direct reference to the earlier statement created a false impression of Fernanda\u2019s value as an eyewitness.</p>\n<p id=\"b692-5\">We are satisfied that the judge correctly ruled that the Commonwealth\u2019s decision to avoid any direct reference to Fernanda\u2019s prior inconsistent statement that she could not identify the shooter evinced a reckless disregard for the truth.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> Our cases have not defined precisely the parameters of conduct that evinces a \u201creckless disregard of the truth\u201d in the context of grand jury proceedings. We think it appropriate, however, to rely here on interpretations of the concept in analogous settings, as in cases invoking the principles of <em>Franks </em>v. Delaware, 438 U.S. 154, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"653\">*653</page-number>155-156 (1978), to challenge the credibility of statements made in support of an application for a search warrant. The operative fact in the <em>Franks </em>line of cases, as here, is the government\u2019s reliance on false or deceptive information, either intentionally or with \u201creckless disregard for the truth,\u201d to justify the exercise of prosecutorial authority in a criminal proceeding. In <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Nine Hundred &amp; Ninety-Two </em>Dollars, 383 Mass. 764, 769 (1981), for example, the Supreme Judicial Court suggested that the ultimate determination of recklessness might be based on whether the affiant acted \u201cwithout reasonable grounds for believing the . . . false statement\u201d to be true. See, e.g., <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Ramos, </em>72 Mass. App. Ct. 773, 776-777, 780-781 (2008) (upholding a motion judge\u2019s ruling that a police officer acted with reckless disregard of the truth when he made material misstatements about facts that should have been known to him). We review the judge\u2019s rulings in light of this interpretation of \u201creckless disregard of the truth.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b693-5\">The judge correctly ruled that the Commonwealth\u2019s failure to present Fernanda\u2019s prior inconsistent exculpatory statement to the grand jury was attributable to its reckless disregard of the truth. Although the Commonwealth is \u201cnot required in every instance to reveal all exculpatory evidence to a grand jury,\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>McGahee, </em>393 Mass. 743, 746 (1985), a prosecutor is obligated to do so when the evidence \u201cwould greatly undermine either the credibility of an important witness or [the evidence is] likely to affect the grand jury\u2019s decision.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Clemmey, </em>447 Mass. 121, 130 (2006), quoting from <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Wilcox, </em>437 Mass. 33, 37 (2002). Fernanda\u2019s prior inconsistent statement, in which she unequivocally denied any ability to identify the perpetrators of the crime, was exculpatory in the sense that it \u201ccalls into question a material, although not indispensable, element of the prosecution\u2019s version of the events, or challenges the credibility of a key prosecution witness.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Bly, </em>448 Mass. 473, 485 (2007), quoting from <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Ellison, </em>376 Mass. 1, 22 (1978). Indeed, there is little question that the prosecutor would have been obligated to disclose it to the defendant as exculpatory. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Tucceri, </em>412 Mass. 401, 404-405 (1992), citing <em>Brady </em>v. <em>Maryland, </em>373 U.S. 83, 87 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"654\">*654</page-number>(1963). Thus, the judge committed no error in attributing this lapse to a reckless disregard of the truth.</p>\n<p id=\"b694-5\">The deception inherent in the Commonwealth\u2019s failure to make a full disclosure of Fernanda\u2019s exculpatory statement was exacerbated by the prosecutor\u2019s careful scripting of Trooper Robertson\u2019s testimony to create the impression that Fernanda\u2019s identification was consistent and reliable.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> The presentation of the evidence in this fashion skirted the Commonwealth\u2019s obligation under <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Clemmey, </em>447 Mass, at 130, to reveal exculpatory evidence that would \u201cgreatly undermine . . . the credibility of an important witness.\u201d We do not presume to dictate the form or manner in which evidence is presented to a grand jury. Nonetheless, we discern no error in the judge\u2019s ruling that the Commonwealth\u2019s failure to abide by its obligation to fairly present the evidence, including exculpatory evidence, was the product of a reckless disregard for the truth of the information provided to the grand jury.</p>\n<p id=\"b694-6\">The Commonwealth argues that the presentation of Fernanda\u2019s prior inconsistent statement in the video recording and the transcript of Beaudoin\u2019s interview of her on February 17, 2004, satisfied any obligation to present that evidence to the grand jury. We disagree. The grand jury would not necessarily understand from the video recording or the transcript that Fernanda\u2019s identification testimony was a stark reversal of her initial statements. Neither contains the contemporaneous police reports, the only documents that fully explicate the limits of Fernanda\u2019s ability to assist the police in their investigation on the night of the shooting. Also, Beaudoin\u2019s questioning of Fernanda about the change in her testimony did not disclose what she said to the officers on the night of the shooting, that is, it did not fully disclose the depth and breadth of her prior inconsistent statement.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> The Commonwealth, consistent with its duty to respect the integrity of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"655\">*655</page-number>grand jury process, cannot hide the ball and expect the grand jury to find it.</p>\n<p id=\"b695-5\">The judge also ruled that the prosecutor\u2019s decision to present Fernanda\u2019s testimony to the grand jury despite sufficient reasons to doubt her credibility even before her deception came to light arose from a reckless disregard for the truth. There was no error. Fernanda\u2019s statement to Serpa on the night of the shooting unequivocally denied any ability to identify the perpetrators. Nothing in this statement suggested uncertainty or doubt that might be subject to clarification at some later date. Thus, any later statement so starkly different in the witness\u2019s perception of the events would be highly suspicious for recent contrivance.</p>\n<p id=\"b695-6\">The timing of the new identification also strongly suggested recent contrivance. Based on the evidence presented at the hearing, the judge found that when Fernanda visited Beaudoin at the New Bedford police department on February 14, 2004, her mission was intensely personal. Her newly conceived identification was brought forward with the goal of avenging her son\u2019s death.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> In the months leading up to Fernanda\u2019s visit with Beaudoin, the Gonzalez family and Tito\u2019s friends were all convinced that Pittman and Hunt were involved in Tito\u2019s shooting. They were aware also that the police, although suspecting the defendants, had declined up to that point to make arrests. On these facts, the judge properly could conclude that the prosecutor\u2019s decision to ignore Fernanda\u2019s apparent motive to force the police to act against the defendants, coupled with the complete reversal in her ability to make an identification, exhibited a reckless disregard of the truth.</p>\n<p id=\"b695-7\">Also, as the judge found, the prosecutor overlooked an obvious inconsistency in Fernanda\u2019s identification testimony. It would have been physically impossible for her to see the shooting from her vantage point on Spruce Street just south of the intersection when, according to her statement, the shooting occurred after the vehicle turned the comer in a westerly direction onto Hillman Street. With a minimum of attention to detail, the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"656\">*656</page-number>prosecutor would have discovered this inconsistency sooner rather than later.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b696-4\">The prosecutor and his team were aware of the entire sequence of events leading to Fernanda\u2019s claim that she could now identify the individuals in the vehicle that night. The judge expressly discredited Trooper Robertson\u2019s testimony that she had no reason to doubt the validity of Fernanda\u2019s identification.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> The totality of circumstances surrounding Fernanda\u2019s newly claimed ability to identify the perpetrators, together with the Commonwealth\u2019s failure sufficiently to vet either the reliability or credibility of her statements, were sufficient to warrant the judge in ruling that the prosecutor acted without \u201creasonable grounds for believing the material, false statement\u201d to be true and that, as a result, he acted with reckless disregard of the truth in his presentation to the grand jury. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Nine Hundred &amp; Ninety-Two Dollars, </em>383 Mass, at 769.</p>\n<p id=\"b696-5\">With respect to the doubts concerning Fernanda\u2019s credibility, the Commonwealth argues that it cannot be compelled to accept the prior district attorney\u2019s and Beaudoin\u2019s skepticism of Fernanda\u2019s credibility because to do so would limit the prosecutor\u2019s exercise of his prerogative in presenting a case to the grand jury. We do not confuse a prosecutor\u2019s prerogative to make independent judgments in deciding which cases or which evidence will be presented to a grand jury with his or her duty to make fair and prudent judgments in exercising that prerogative. The failure to take any account of the facts undermining the reliability of Fernanda\u2019s identification was both unfair and imprudent and properly could be considered in assessing recklessness.</p>\n<p id=\"b696-6\">b. <em>Likely impact of the false testimony. </em>The second prong of the <em>Mayfield </em>test requires that we examine whether the judge properly concluded that the false identification \u201cprobably influenced\u201d the grand jury in its decision to return indictments against the defendants. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Mayfield, </em>398 Mass, at 621-622. Here, the judge ruled that \u201c[i]t is well-nigh <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"657\">*657</page-number>impossible for this court to safely say that the grand jurors would have indicted in the absence of the false identification testimony.\u201d He reasoned that Fernanda\u2019s testimony obviously was important to the grand jury because she was the only eyewitness to the crime. He noted that \u201cthe dangers present whenever eyewitness evidence is introduced against an accused require the utmost protection against mistaken identifications.\u201d See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Johnson, </em>420 Mass. 458, 465 (1995). The judge was correct to express concern about and be wary of \u201cthe pernicious effect of a false identification\u201d in establishing the requisite probable cause. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Silva-Santiago, </em>453 Mass. 782, 796-797 &amp; n.20 (2009). As to the weight to be accorded to other evidence presented to the grand jury, the judge acknowledged that such evidence existed but concluded that given \u201cthe totality of the circumstances, the defendants have met their burden of showing that the false identification testimony probably influenced the decision to indict.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b697-4\">The question on a motion to dismiss is not simply whether the false or deceptive testimony \u201cprobably influenced\u201d the grand jury in some abstract sense. Rather, the defendant must show not only that the evidence was material to the question of probable cause but also that on the entire grand jury record, the false or deceptive testimony probably \u201cwould have affected the decision to indict.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Silva, </em>455 Mass, at 508, citing <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Mayfield, </em>398 Mass, at 621-622. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Freeman, </em>407 Mass. 279, 283 (1990) (whether the statements \u201cviewed in the context of all the evidence presented to the grand jury, \u2018probably made a difference\u2019 in their decision to indict him\u201d). Thus, we are constrained to look beyond the Commonwealth\u2019s recklessness and focus our analysis on the question whether, \u201cif the grand jury had been told the true facts, it probably would not have indicted the defendants].\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Mayfield, supra </em>at 621, citing <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>McGahee, </em>393 Mass, at 746-748.</p>\n<p id=\"b697-5\">Viewing the entire grand jury record under this standard, we conclude that it is unlikely that the disclosure of the withheld information would have affected the grand jury\u2019s decision to indict the defendants. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>McGahee, supra </em>at <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"658\">*658</page-number>747. The revelation that Fernanda first disclaimed any ability to identify the perpetrators would not likely have undermined the value of other evidence tending to show that the defendants committed the crime. The defendants\u2019 admissions and post-shooting conduct were highly probative of their guilt independent of Fernanda\u2019s false claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b698-5\">As to Hunt, evidence was presented to the grand jury that he admitted to the shooting in the presence of others immediately following the crime. His statement that he had to \u201cget out of here\u201d because \u201cwe\u201d \u201cjust took out the kid\u201d is highly inculpatory. That admission is even more damaging in the context of the evidence of Hunt\u2019s appearance at Hubbard\u2019s apartment just after the shooting in possession of a handgun and that Hunt surrendered the weapon to Hubbard with instructions to get rid of it. The evidence that Hunt had been injured in the melee with Tito\u2019s group suggested a motive for the crime. Also, Hunt was linked to the vehicle used in the shooting by evidence that he rented the vehicle from a local car dealer and evidence that he gave a post-shooting directive to \u201cclean\u201d the car. The police searched this vehicle and found incriminating evidence, including a black \u201cdoo rag,\u201d said by a witness to the shooting to have been worn by the driver on the night of the shooting, and a spent shell casing, as well as other evidence linking Hunt to the vehicle.</p>\n<p id=\"b698-6\">Similarly, Pittman implicated himself in statements and actions before and after the shooting. The evidence tended to show that in the weeks following the fight in which Hunt was injured, Pittman engaged in a campaign of threats against Tito. There was evidence that, on the day of the shooting, Pittman told Tito that this was the day he was going to die. There was also evidence that after the shooting, and while the family was still at the hospital, Pittman called Tito\u2019s sister, taunting her with the question, \u201cHow do you feel now that he is dead? How does it feel that he\u2019s dead, that we killed him?\u201d There was also evidence that in the immediate aftermath of the shooting, Pittman appeared with Hunt, who, according to the evidence presented to the grand jury, was the self-confessed shooter and connected to the rental car involved in the shooting, at Hubbard\u2019s apartment, where they made plans to get out of town. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"659\">*659</page-number>Further, investigators found Pittman\u2019s fingerprints in the vehicle used in the shooting. Pittman also gave false statements to the police about his connection to Hunt, his contact with Tito on the day of the shooting, and whether he had ever been in the vehicle used in the shooting.</p>\n<p id=\"b699-5\">To be sure, Fernanda\u2019s false eyewitness testimony was important to the Commonwealth\u2019s case against the defendants. We are persuaded, however, that the defendants\u2019 statements and conduct, both before and after the crime, and the physical evidence linking them to the vehicle apparently used in the shooting are sufficiently inculpatory to relieve the Commonwealth of the adverse consequences that might otherwise flow from its conduct of the grand jury proceedings and that the evidence submitted to the grand jury, apart from Fernanda\u2019s identification testimony, was sufficient \u201cto establish the identity of the accused . . . and probable cause to arrest [them].\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>McCarthy, </em>385 Mass. 160, 163 (1982).

The Commonwealth claims that Fernanda allegedly told the police that she saw two black males in the vehicle that night.
