At issue is a State trooper\u2019s decision, based on G. L. c. 90, \u00a7 6, to stop a vehicle because it had a tinted plastic cover over its rear license plate. The statute requires that \u201cnumber plates shall be kept clean with the numbers legible and shall not be obscured in any manner by the installation of any device obscuring said numbers.\u201d G. L. c. 90, \u00a7 6, as appearing in St. 1968, c. 293. After briefing and an evidentiary hearing, which included introduction by the Commonwealth of a color photograph<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> showing the license plate and its cover, the judge found that the license plate was clear, with all numbers and letters visible and that \u201c[a]s such, the license plate was not obstructed when the defendant was stopped pursuant to\u201d G. L. c. 90, \u00a7 6. Because there was no other basis for the stop, the judge allowed the defendant\u2019s motion to suppress. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b812-5\">We set out the judge\u2019s findings and rationale:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b812-6\">\u201cBased on the credible evidence presented at an evidentiary hearing held on July 17, 2012, the Defendant\u2019s motion is allowed and the Court finds as follows:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b812-7\">\u201cOn June 9, 2011, while on a routine patrol in a marked cruiser, State Trooper Sweeney[] observed the Defendant operating a motor vehicle on Route 495 at approximately 4:40 p.m.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b812-8\">\u201cThe operator drove appropriately and no moving violations were observed.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b812-9\">\u201cTrooper Sweeney observed a plastic cover over the rear license plate of the Defendant\u2019s motor vehicle and immediately pulled the vehicle over for obstructing the vehicle license plate in violation of [G. L. c. 90, \u00a7 6].</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b812-10\">\u201cThe sole reason for the stop was for violation of [G. L. c. 90, \u00a7 6].</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b812-11\">\u201cTrooper Sweeney routinely performs such stops if there is a cover of any kind on a license plate.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b813-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"773\">*773</page-number>\u201cDuring the hearing, defense counself] presented Trooper Sweeney with a photograph of the license plate at issue with said plastic cover intact.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b813-5\">\u201cTrooper Sweeney agreed the photograph presented was a fair and accurate depiction of the plate, as it appeared at the time the Defendant was stopped.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b813-6\">\u201cThe Court finds that the photograph submitted depicts a clear license plate with all numbers and letters visible. As such, the license plate was not obstructed when the defendant was stopped pursuant to [G. L. c. 90, \u00a7 6],</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b813-7\">\u201cThere was no further evidence presented regarding the initial stop.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b813-8\">\u201cThe sole reason for the stop was for violation of [G. L. c. 90, \u00a7 6. Hjowever, the court finds that the plate was not obstructed. The stop was therefore not permissible.\u201d<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b813-9\"><em>Findings. </em>The Commonwealth argues that two of the judge\u2019s findings were clearly erroneous. \u201cA finding is clearly erroneous if it is not supported by the evidence, or when the reviewing court, on the entire evidence, is left with the firm conviction that a mistake has been committed.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Hilton, </em>450 Mass. 173, 178 (2007).</p>\n<p id=\"b813-10\">The Commonwealth first argues that it was clear error to find that the trooper agreed that the photograph accurately depicted <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"774\">*774</page-number>the license plate and its cover as they appeared when the defendant was stopped. However, when presented on cross-examination with a photograph of the rear of the vehicle, the trooper testified that it \u201clook[ed] like the vehicle that [he] saw on that particular day.\u201d He also testified that he believed the photograph showed \u201cthe actual car and the license plate on the vehicle on June 9th,\u201d the day of the stop. In light of this testimony, the judge\u2019s finding was not clearly erroneous.</p>\n<p id=\"b814-5\">It is true, as the Commonwealth points out, that the trooper testified on direct examination that he was unable \u201cto see the license plate\u201d when he looked at it from an angle across two lanes of traffic.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> It does not follow, however, that the judge\u2019s finding that the trooper agreed the photograph accurately depicted the car and license plate as it appeared when the defendant was stopped is clearly erroneous. Even if the trooper\u2019s direct testimony was in part inconsistent with his testimony on cross-examination, any conflict was for the judge to resolve.</p>\n<p id=\"b814-6\">\u201c[T]he determination of the weight and credibility of the testimony is the function and responsibility of the judge who saw the witnesses.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. Sanna, 424 Mass. 92, 97 (1997), quoting from <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Yesilciman, </em>406 Mass. 736, 743 (1990). \u201cIn other words, an appellate court will ordinarily not disturb the findings of a judge who saw and heard the witnesses, who was free to make credibility determinations and to accept all, some, or none of their testimony, unless there is a showing of clear error in those findings.\u201d Grasso &amp; McEvoy, Suppression Matters Under Massachusetts Law \u00a7 2-12, at 2-26 (2012-2013 ed.). See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Scott, </em>440 Mass. 642, 646 (2004). Moreover, where, as here, a judge states that her findings are based on the \u201ccredible evidence\u201d presented during the evidentiary hearing \u2014 and some of the evidence was conflicting \u2014 \u201cit is apparent that the judge credited only those portions of the testimony that were reflected in her findings and were relevant to the specific issues before her.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Daniel, </em>464 Mass. 746, 749 (2013).</p>\n<p id=\"b814-7\">The Commonwealth next argues that the judge\u2019s finding that the photograph shows a \u201cclear\u201d license plate was clearly er<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"775\">*775</page-number>roneous because the photograph shows the cover was tinted.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> We are not persuaded; the judge did not use \u201cclear\u201d as an antonym for \u201ctinted.\u201d A natural reading of the entire finding shows that the judge used \u201cclear\u201d to mean that the cover did not impede the visibility of the license plate, regardless of any tint. Moreover, our independent review of the photograph, see <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Hoyt, </em>461 Mass. 143, 148 (2011), leads us to the same conclusion. Although the cover has a bluish tint, it does not to any degree obscure or reduce the legibility of the license plate.</p>\n<p id=\"A_3\"><em>General Laws c. 90, \u00a7 6. </em>The Commonwealth argues, as a matter of first impression, that \u201c[rjegardless of whether the trooper could read the plate, . . . the stop was lawful because driving with a tinted number plate cover is prohibited under the plain language of G. L. c. 90, \u00a7 6, the plain language of an implementing regulation, 540 Code Mass. Regs. \u00a7 2.23, and the policy underlying both.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"A5g\">As in all matters of statutory construction, we begin with the language of the statute. \u201cIn interpreting the meaning of a statute, we look first to the plain statutory language. Where the language of a statute is clear and unambiguous, it is conclusive as to legislative intent and the courts enforce the statute according to its plain wording so long as its application would not lead to an absurd result.\u201d <em>Worcester </em>v. <em>College Hill Properties, LLC, </em>465 Mass. 134, 138 (2013) (quotations, citations, and ellipses omitted). The statute provides, in relevant part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"Adl\">\u201cEvery motor vehicle or trailer registered under this chapter when operated in or on any way in this commonwealth shall have its register number[<footnotemark>5</footnotemark>] displayed conspicuously thereon by the number plates[<footnotemark>6</footnotemark>] furnished by the registrar . . . one number plate to be attached at the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"776\">*776</page-number>front and one at the rear of said motor vehicle, . . . but if the registrar issues but one number plate it shall be attached to the rear of the vehicle so that it shall always be plainly visible. The said number plates shall be kept clean with the numbers legible and shall not be obscured in any manner by the installation of any device obscuring said numbers . . . .\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b816-5\">G. L. c. 90, \u00a7 6.</p>\n<p id=\"b816-6\">The statute does not by its terms prohibit the use of all license plate covers, nor does it mention tinted covers. Instead, consistent with its overall focus on visibility and legibility, the statute prohibits the \u201cinstallation of any device obscuring [the registration] numbers.\u201d \u201cDevice\u201d is certainly broad enough to encompass license plate covers.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> But a cover (tinted or not) does not violate the statute unless it obscures the registration numbers.</p>\n<p id=\"b816-7\">The regulation likewise does not impose a universal prohibition against license plate covers.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> Instead, it prohibits only those covers that reduce the legibility or substantially diminish the reflective quality of the license plate:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b816-8\">\u201c[N]o reflectorized number plate issued by the Registrar of Motor Vehicles and mounted on any motor vehicle or trailer shall be covered with any glass, plastic or similar material if such material reduces the legibility or substantially diminishes the reflective qualities of such plate.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b816-9\">540 Code Mass. Regs. \u00a7 2.23(1) (2008). As with the statute, the touchstones of the regulation (the full text of which may be found in the margin)<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> are the legibility and visibility of the license plate.</p>\n<p id=\"b817-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"777\">*777</page-number>Where, as here, the statutory and regulatory language is clear and presents no lacunae, we are not tempted by the Commonwealth\u2019s argument that we should discern a different legislative intent based on the section of G. L. c. 90 that governs windshields and windows, G. L. c. 90, \u00a7 9D. Although that section specifies the degree to which windows may be tinted, see G. L. c. 90, \u00a7 9D(4),<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> there is no reason to import that specification into the section of the statute that regulates license plates where the Legislature has not done so.</p>\n<p id=\"b817-5\">The order allowing the motion to suppress is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b817-6\">\n<em>So ordered.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b812-12\">The Commonwealth objected to the defendant\u2019s introduction of a black and white photograph depicting the rear of the car, and asked that the court admit instead a color version of the photograph, which it did.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b813-11\">If the judge had found that the trooper initiated the stop because the license plate appeared to him to be obscured (a question of fact), rather than that he routinely stopped vehicles that had \u201ca cover of any kind on a license plate\u201d (a mistake of law, as we shall discuss), this would be a different case. In those circumstances, the test would be whether \u201cthe facts and circumstances known to the officer [were] sufficient to create a reasonable suspicion ... in a reasonable . . . officer [that the tint was sufficiently dark as to obscure the license plate, in violation of \u00a7 6].\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Smigliano, </em>427 Mass. 490, 493 (1998). Compare <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Baez, </em>47 Mass. App. Ct. 115, 118 (1999). As to the difference between traffic stops based on a mistake of law versus a mistake of fact, see generally <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Rivas, </em>77 Mass. App. Ct. 210, 216 n.6 (2010), quoting from <em>United States </em>v. <em>Coplin, </em>463 F.3d 96, 101 (1st Cir. 2006): \u201c[There is a] material difference between traffic stops based on a police officer\u2019s mistake of law and those based on a police officer\u2019s mistake of fact. Stops premised on a mistake of law, even a reasonable, good-faith mistake, are generally held to be unconstitutional.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b814-8\">The trooper did not explicitly say that the reason he could not see the license plate was because of its cover.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"Aop\">In addition, the trooper testified the cover was tinted.
