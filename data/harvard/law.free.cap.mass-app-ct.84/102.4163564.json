Wilde Company, Inc. (taxpayer), appeals from a decision of the Appellate Tax Board (board) denying the taxpayer\u2019s petitions to abate the fiscal year 2007 real estate taxes on two individual parcels situated in the town of Holliston (town). The question presented is whether, based on the text of G. L. c. 58A, \u00a7 12A, the board was obliged to assign the burden of going forward with the necessary proof to the town\u2019s board of assessors (assessors), not the taxpayer, at the administrative hearing. The board refused. There was no error.</p>\n<p id=\"b142-13\"><em>Facts. </em>The taxpayer has been the lessee in possession of the parcels, both of which are improved with buildings for industrial and office use. Under its lease, the taxpayer has been required to pay more than one-half of the taxes on each of the parcels, see G. L. c. 59, \u00a7 11, known as 200 and 201 Summer Street. In fiscal years 2005 and 2006, the taxpayer contested the as<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"103\">*103</page-number>sessments,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> filing appeals with the board under the formal procedure.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Each time, the board decided that the taxpayer did not meet its burden to prove the parcels had been overvalued.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> This same scenario recurred in fiscal year 2007.</p>\n<p id=\"b143-5\">a. <em>Fiscal year 2007 appeal. </em>After the assessors refused to abate the taxes for fiscal year 2007, the taxpayer again filed petitions with the board under the formal procedure, contesting the 2007 assessed values \u2014 200 Summer Street at $3,211,800 and 201 Summer Street at $5,012,300 \u2014 both of which exceeded, by $49,800 and $134,800, respectively, the valuations from the prior two fiscal years. See note 1, <em>supra.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b143-6\">At the hearing before the board, the taxpayer advanced an argument that the assessors had the burden of proof to demonstrate the fiscal year 2007 assessments were warranted. This was required, the taxpayer urged, by G. L. c. 58A, \u00a7 12A, as amended by St. 1998, c. 485, \u00a7 2, which provides, in relevant part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b143-7\">\u201cIf the owner of a parcel of real estate files an appeal of the assessed value of said parcel with the board for either of the next two fiscal years <em>after a fiscal year for which the board has determined the fair cash value of said parcel </em>and if the assessed value is greater than the fair cash value as determined by the board, the burden shall be upon the appellee [assessors] to prove that the assessed value was warranted ...\u201d (emphasis supplied).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b143-8\">The taxpayer offered no proof for its theory of overvaluation. The board found for the assessors and sustained the assessed valuations. The board issued its findings of fact and report, citing, among other cases, the Supreme Judicial Court\u2019s decisions in <em>Schlaiker </em>v. <em>Assessors of Great Barrington, </em>365 Mass. 243, 245 (1974) (Schlaiker), and <em>General Elec. Co. </em>v. <em>Assessors of </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"104\">*104</page-number><em>Lynn, </em>393 Mass. 591, 598 (1984) <em>(General Electric).</em><footnotemark><em>4</em></footnotemark><em> </em>Simply put, the board concluded it had not determined the fair cash value of the parcels in the fiscal years 2005 and 2006 appeals and, thus, \u00a7 12A did not apply.</p>\n<p id=\"b144-5\"><em>Standard of review. </em>\u201cOur review of any decision of the board is limited to questions of law.\u201d <em>Towle </em>v. <em>Commissioner of Rev., </em>397 Mass. 599, 601 (1986). \u201cIn general, we grant substantial deference to an interpretation of a statute by the administrative agency charged with its administration.\u201d <em>Protective Life Ins. Co. </em>v. <em>Sullivan, </em>425 Mass. 615, 618 (1997). However, statutory interpretation is ultimately for the court; \u201cwe review . . . de novo.\u201d <em>Ibid.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b144-6\"><em>Discussion. </em>With regard to G. L. c. 58A, \u00a7 12A, the taxpayer focuses on the phrase \u201cdetermined the fair cash value\u201d and, relying largely on dictionary meanings, asserts that the noun \u201cdetermination\u201d is the equivalent of a \u201cdecision.\u201d<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> On this footing, the taxpayer contends that the board\u2019s decisions as to the fiscal years 2005 and 2006 appeals \u201c[Ijogically\u201d determined the fair cash value of the parcels within the meaning of \u00a7 12A.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b144-7\">We do not construe a statute\u2019s words in isolation or apart from the legal context within which they appear. \u201c[Tjhe meaning of language is inherently contextual.\u201d<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> <em>Moskal </em>v. <em>United States, </em>498 U.S. 103, 108 (1990). \u201cValue\u201d as \u201cdetermined\u201d by <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"105\">*105</page-number>the board is the fair market value of the real estate. See <em>Massachusetts Gen. Hosp. </em>v. <em>Belmont, 233 </em>Mass. 190, 206 (1919). \u201cThe whole matter lies in the realm of fact and is to be ascertained upon all the evidence.\u201d <em>Commissioner of Corps. &amp; Taxn. </em>v. <em>Worcester County Trust Co., </em>305 Mass. 460, 463 (1940). Essential to the inquiry is who bears the burden of persuasion and of going forward with the necessary proof at the evidentiary hearing. \u201cIt is well established that the burden of persuasion is on the taxpayer to show that its property was overvalued.\u201d <em>General Electric, 393 </em>Mass, at 598. The \u201cburden of persuasion\u201d in Massachusetts means \u201cburden of proof.\u201d<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> See <em>Powers </em>v. <em>Russell, </em>13 Pick. 69, 76 (1832); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Taylor, </em>383 Mass. 272, 281 n.10 (1981). Closely linked to this common-law rule is the presumption, also long settled, that the \u201cboard is entitled to \u2018presume that the valuation made by the assessors was valid unless the taxpayer[] sustained the burden of proving the contrary.\u2019 \u201d <em>General Electric, supra, </em>quoting from <em>Schlaiker, </em>365 Mass, at 245. The presumption,<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> and the fact that the taxpayer has the burden of going forward with proof, round out the context in which G. L. c. 58A, \u00a7 12A, must be construed. Section 12A essentially provides that the threshold burden of going forward with the evidence shifts to the local assessors <em>if </em>(a) in the prior two fiscal years, the \u201cowner\u201d filed an appeal for which the board \u201cdetermined the fair cash value\u201d of said parcel, <em>and </em>(b) the assessed value, contested by the taxpayer, is greater than the fair cash value so determined. Neither element is present here. In adjudicating the prior appeals, the board decided the taxpayer had failed to meet its burden to prove overvaluation. When a taxpayer fails to offer persuasive evidence of overvaluation, \u201ca conclusion [by the board] that a presumptively valid assessment must stand is by its nature not such an affirmative finding as to require substantial evidence to support it.\u201d <em>Schlaiker, </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"106\">*106</page-number><em>supra </em>at 245 n.2. \u201c[F]ailure to introduce sufficient evidence to warrant a finding for [the taxpayer] will result in a dismissal or a directed verdict.\u201d <em>General Electric, supra </em>at 599. The <em>Schlaiker </em>and <em>General Electric </em>cases encapsulate the governing rule: a board decision to sustain a presumptively valid assessed valuation does not constitute a \u201cdetermination of fair cash value\u201d of a parcel within the meaning of G. L. c. 58A, \u00a7 12A.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> This reading of \u00a7 12A fits the Legislature\u2019s policy that, where the proof is insufficient to find for the taxpayer, \u201cthe board should perform a more traditional appellate function, rather than make a de novo determination of value.\u201d <em>Assessors of Sandwich </em>v. <em>Commissioner of Rev., </em>393 Mass. 580, 586 (1984).</p>\n<p id=\"b146-5\">\n<em>Decision of the Appellate Tax Board affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b143-9\">For those years, 200 Summer Street was assessed at $3,162,000, and 201 Summer Street at $4,877,500.
