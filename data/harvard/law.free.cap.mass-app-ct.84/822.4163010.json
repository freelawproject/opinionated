After determining that the transfer would result in improved services and quality of life for P.D. and be in his best interest, an administrative magistrate of the Division of Administrative Law Appeals (DALA) approved the transfer. See G. L. c. 123B, \u00a7 3. The guardians appeal from a Superior Court judgment affirming that decision. Concluding, as we do, that the decision was supported by substantial evidence and free from error of law, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b863-10\"><em>Substantial evidence. </em>The magistrate\u2019s ultimate conclusion that the transfer would result in improved services and quality of life for P.D. was supported by substantial evidence. See G. L. c. 30A, \u00a7 14(7); <em>G.R. </em>v. <em>Department of Developmental Servs., ante </em>791, 794 (2014). In determining whether the transfer should proceed as in P.D.\u2019s best interest, the magistrate properly examined the over-all picture, comparing the supports and services available at the respective facilities to meet P.D.\u2019s unique needs. He also carefully considered the guardians\u2019 many objections, as required by the statute, and rejected them as invalid or unreviewable, or valid but outweighed by other factors or adequately addressed by DDS.</p>\n<p id=\"b863-11\">P.D. has lived at FDC for most of his life. His primary medical and psychiatric issues are sever pica (ingesting nonfood <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"824\">*824</page-number>items), skin picking, hyperactivity, a swallowing disorder, and both obsessive-compulsive disorder and bipolar disorder. These conditions are addressed in his individual support/service plan (ISP).</p>\n<p id=\"b864-5\">In his decision, the magistrate identified the seven distinct improvements in services and quality of life that DDS asserted would be available to P.D. atWDC, which the magistrate grouped into four categories: (1) reunification with former housemates and familiar FDC direct care and professional staff; (2) a greater variety and number of social, leisure, and recreational activities; (3) better medical and psychological services; and (4) more stability and predictability at a facility that will remain open after FDC closes. The magistrate agreed with DDS regarding the second alleged benefit and part of the third.</p>\n<p id=\"b864-6\">On balance, the magistrate\u2019s conclusion that the <em>tangible </em>benefit to P.D. from WDC\u2019s \u201cmore robust recreational, social and leisure offerings,\u201d in combination with the minor improvement in medical services, warranted the transfer.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> As the magistrate found, \u201cactivity in general tends to divert [P.D], from pica and skin-picking, and keeping him occupied is one of the forms of proactive intervention employed to address this behavior. ...\u201d The magistrate further found that \u201cit is possible that one or more of the additional activities Wrentham offers would augment this critical behavioral diversion. [P.D.]\u2019s ISP[<footnotemark>4</footnotemark>] is read properly as encouraging that a range of activities be offered to him. Wrentham\u2019s wider variety of recreational, social and leisure activities make it possible for this to be accomplished. In terms of offering additional opportunities for diversions from pica and self-injuring behavior, and in terms of meeting the ISP objective as to a participation in a broad range of activities, Wrentham\u2019s wider variety of recreational, social, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"825\">*825</page-number>and leisure activities show that the proposed transfer would improve P.D.\u2019s services and quality of life and that the transfer would be in his best interest.\u201d<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> In assessing the weight to be given to this one improvement, the magistrate concluded \u201c[because activities in general are <em>critical </em>to diverting P.D. away from pica and self-injuring behavior, and because P.D.\u2019s ISP identifies participation in activities as a functional need and as related to his sensorimotor and social development, this benefit stands out in the overall picture that emerges from the record, predominantly so in comparison to other asserted benefits that proved to be negligible or hypothetical\u201d (emphasis supplied). These findings provide substantial evidence in support of the transfer.</p>\n<p id=\"b865-5\">Although the magistrate found that the entire reunification benefit identified by DDS was \u201ctheoretical\u201d or \u201chypothetical,\u201d there may be benefits from the probable reunification with certain direct care and professional staff that provide additional support for the magistrate\u2019s decision. <footnotemark>6</footnotemark> As the magistrate noted, three of P.D.\u2019s familiar caregivers now work at WDC and two others, who apparently work in the multi-apartment Heffron Halls, have applied to work in apartment 3. The magistrate specifically found that \u201c[i]t would likely be of significant benefit to P.D. if these familiar Femald direct care staff were assigned to work with him at Heffron Hall B, apartment 3.\u201d While the magistrate correctly pointed out that there was no evidence that the two caregivers who have applied to work in apartment 3 will be transferred there, the undisputed evidence demonstrated that two others are already assigned to and working in apartment 3.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> This significant benefit to P.D. of the availability of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"826\">*826</page-number>these familiar direct care staff in apartment 3 supported the magistrate\u2019s ultimate determination.</p>\n<p id=\"b866-4\">Addressing the benefit of reunification with familiar professional staff, the magistrate found that \u201c[t]he assignment of both a QMRP [Qualified Mental Retardation Professional or \u2018Q\u2019] and a psychology assistant assigned [sic] to P.D. would ... improve the psychological services he receives currently, particularly if both of them have worked with P.D. and are familiar with his pica self-injurious behavior and psychological and medical profiles.\u201d However, the magistrate found that \u201c[i]t is not clear that this team will actually coalesce at Wrentham. It appears reasonably certain that Mr. [Rick] Tulipano [a former, familiar QMRP who works at Heffron Hall B] would be P.D.\u2019s assigned QMRP .... It is not certain, however, that Mr. [Anthony] Gabriesheski will remain assigned to P.D. if he is transferred to Wrentham.\u201d The record demonstrates, however, that as of the date of the hearing, Gabriesheski is slated to provide those services to P.D. in apartment 3.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark>,<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b866-20\">In short, an examination of the record established that the proposed transfer to WDC will most probably offer several benefits and improvements, in addition to those identified by the magistrate, including reunification or continuity of services with familiar direct care and professional staff and better psychological services, as well as those identified by the magistrate including a greater variety and number of activities <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"827\">*827</page-number>critical to diverting P.D. from pica and self-injurious behavior and improved medical services.</p>\n<p id=\"b867-5\"><em>Additional concerns expressed by the guardians. </em>The guardians based one of their arguments that the transfer was not in P.D.\u2019s best interest on an unduly limited excerpt from the magistrate\u2019s decision. In addressing the guardians\u2019 serious concern that the crowding situation will exacerbate P.D.\u2019s pica and self-injurious behavior, the magistrate did state that P.D. \u201ccannot be forced to fit into apartment 3.\u201d<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> However, the magistrate did not find that apartment 3 was unsafe or inadequate to meet P.D.\u2019s needs. He credited testimony from members of P.D.\u2019s ISP team who have successfully managed his neuropsychiatric issues that P.D. would adjust to the new residence with the assistance of staff.</p>\n<p id=\"b867-6\">Contrary to the guardians\u2019 assertions, the magistrate did not find that the proposed placement in apartment 3 \u201cpresented significant risks of undermining P.D.\u2019s stability and exacerbating his self-injurious and aggressive behaviors.\u201d Nor did the magistrate find, as the guardians assert, that the \u201cphysical design of the apartment presented significant risks to [PJD.j\u2019s safety.\u201d The magistrate found rather that it is \u201calmost impossible\u201d to predict whether the space constraints will affect P.D.\u2019s behavior and if so, how.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> Even the guardians acknowledge that DDS cannot absolutely guarantee P.D.\u2019s safety. Given the many variables and unknown facts, the magistrate appropriately directed DDS staff to evaluate the safety and adequacy of the space for P.D. as the transition is implemented (and if necessary, to craft <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"828\">*828</page-number>an effective solution to any problem noted within a reasonable time).<footnotemark>12</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b868-5\"><em>Statutory notice. </em>Even if the content of DOS\u2019s forty-five day notice failed to comply with G. L. c. 123B, \u00a7 3, and 115 Code Mass. Regs. \u00a7 6.63(2)(c) (2009), the guardians have not demonstrated possible prejudice to their substantial rights. See G. L. c. 30A, \u00a7 14(7); <em>Molly A. </em>v. <em>Commissioner of the Dept. of Mental Retardation, </em>69 Mass. App. Ct. 267, 287 n.28 (2007). See also <em>M.D. </em>v. <em>Department of Developmental Servs., </em>83 Mass. App. Ct. 463, 470-472 (2013) (M.D.). As the magistrate found, it did not matter how many details or points of comparison were included in the notice; the guardians were going to object to the proposed transfer to WDC.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> <em>Id. </em>at 471-472. Moreover, the purposes of the notice provision were met. See <em>id. </em>at 470-472. The guardians were able to submit a timely and comprehensive objection to the proposed transfer as required by the statute; and they have not identified any way in which the allegedly inadequate notice compromised their ability to prepare their case for an adjudicatory hearing. Finally, there was nothing improper in the magistrate\u2019s suggestion in his prehearing orders about how he would likely rule on the issue. The magistrate\u2019s eighty-three page decision, including eight pages of analysis on the notice issue alone, belies any contention that he failed to apply the provisions of the transfer statute to RD.\u2019s unique, individual circumstances.</p>\n<p id=\"b868-6\"><em>Process. </em>The guardians have failed to show any violation of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"829\">*829</page-number>the <em>Ricci </em>mandates<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> or DDS regulations in connection with the placement-planning process or the June 2, 2010, ITP/ISP modification meeting. DDS did not deny the guardians meaningful participation in the placement decision. The evidence established that DDS explored many different placement options for P.D. and consistently encouraged the guardians to participate in the planning process. The central role played by the ISP team in the selection process was clear. As DDS had advised the guardians in correspondence sent after <em>Ricci V </em>cleared the path to FDC\u2019s closure, in the absence of the guardians\u2019 participation, the ISP team would make the placement <em>recommendation </em>for P.D. No regulation required DDS to keep a record of the ISP team\u2019s informal communications about potential placements or to invite the guardians to participate in them. See <em>M.D., supra </em>at 475-476.</p>\n<p id=\"b869-5\">To the extent that the guardians complain that the placement decision was made without the meeting of the entire ISP team (of which they are a part), the record established that as required by regulation, DDS invited the guardians, among many others, to the formal ITP/ISP modification meeting.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> See 115 Code Mass. Regs. \u00a7\u00a7 6.21 and 6.25(4)(a) (2009). As evidenced by the attendance record, sixteen individuals attended that meeting. One of the guardians, Susan Surette, attended and was given the opportunity to ask questions about the placement process, the impact of the proposed transfer upon P.D.\u2019s ISP, and the ISP team\u2019s placement recommendation, including the alleged improvements available to P.D. at WDC, the appropriateness of apartment 3, the risks to P.D., and other possible placement alternatives. The final transfer decision was not made until after that meeting. See 115 Code Mass. Regs. \u00a7 6.25(7) (2009).<footnotemark>16</footnotemark>,<footnotemark>17</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b870-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"830\">*830</page-number><em>Federal law. </em>The magistrate did not err by ruling that DALA lacked jurisdiction to decide the guardians\u2019 Federal law claims. See <em>M.D., supra </em>at 466.</p>\n<p id=\"b870-5\">The magistrate properly analyzed the restrictiveness claim as it was framed by the guardians below under <em>Olmstead. </em>See <em>Olmstead </em>v. <em>L.C. ex rel. Zimring, </em>527 U.S. 581 (1999) <em>(Olm</em>stead). Since the guardians had rejected all community-based placements and DDS had proposed an interfacility transfer, no principle of <em>Olmstead </em>was violated. See <em>M.D., supra </em>at 466-467. The guardians\u2019 argument that <em>Olmstead </em>allows them to reject <em>any </em>undesired transfer is based upon a misreading of that case and fails for that reason. See <em>id. </em>at 467.<footnotemark>18</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b870-6\"><em>Conclusion. </em>We recognize and appreciate that the coguardians are motivated by their deep concern for P.D.\u2019s well-being. We know that P.D.\u2019s transfer to WDC will be a significant adjustment for him and for them. After careful consideration, we conclude that there was substantial evidence to support the magistrate\u2019s decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b870-7\">The judgment of the Superior Court affirming the decision of DALA to approve RD.\u2019s transfer is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b870-8\">\n<em>Judgment affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b864-7\">The magistrate found that the availability of twenty-four hour nursing in apartment 3 and acute care at WDC\u2019s May Center \u201cwould effect, at best, a minimal improvement in the medical services [P.D.] is receiving at Femald.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b864-8\">P.D.\u2019s ISP, a document approved by the guardians, identified P.D.\u2019s needs to expend physical energy in constructive ways; to exercise in the pool on a weekly basis; and to maintain his participation in a broad range of community activities as important to his affective, sensorimotor and social development. The magistrate also interpreted the ISP to not only encourage, but to direct, that P.D. be offered additional activities.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b865-6\">The magistrate found that P.D. enjoys walking, using the pool, his work program, eating, van rides, bingo, playing with mega-building blocks, flipping through magazines, music and singing, and receiving hugs and attention from familiar staff and family members. It is undisputed that WDC offers a much greater variety and frequency of recreational, social, and leisure activities than FDC.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b865-7\">The reunification benefit had three aspects (housemates, direct care staff, and professional staff). The magistrate was warranted in finding that the benefit of reunification with his housemates was theoretical. P.D. generally does not interact with his housemates and has not formed meaningful relationships with anyone other than his guardians and direct care givers.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b865-8\">Coguardian Susan Surette testified that she was aware that two familiar <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"826\">*826</page-number>direct care staff are working in apartment 3. According to Mary Ann Killilea, the guardians\u2019 own witness and P.D.\u2019s longterm caregiver, the availability of these two familiar direct care workers would benefit P.D.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b866-30\">The magistrate found that \u201c[a] more robust psychology staff is unquestionably critical to P.D.\u2019s well-being. . . . Gabriesheski is unquestionably one of P.D.\u2019s familiar professional caregivers, and he has played an important and direct role in the successful management of P.D.\u2019s behavioral problems at Pernald, including the reduction of P.D.\u2019s pica to \u2018basically zero,\u2019 by the time of the hearing in this matter. . . . P.D.\u2019s psychology services would improve if Mr. Gabriesheski remained as his psychology assistant and P.D.\u2019s former QMRP (Mr. Tulipano, who is already working at Heffron Hall B) joined P.D.\u2019s professional direct care team.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"9\">\n<p id=\"b866-39\">In the case of <em>E.G. </em>v. <em>Department of Developmental Servs., post </em>831, 833 n.7 (2014), the magistrate found that Gabriesheski\u2019s provision of services to E.G. will be a benefit to him. It seems highly unlikely that Gabriesheski will provide services to E.G., P.D.\u2019s anticipated apartment mate, but not to P.D.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"10\">\n<p id=\"b867-7\">In light of the ongoing transfers, both P.D.\u2019s residence at FDC and apartment 3 are half-full. Upon completion of the transfers, P.D. would live with the same number of men until recent changes were made, but in a smaller space. The magistrate found that seven residents with their direct care staff \u201cmay crowd this smaller space noticeably.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"11\">\n<p id=\"A08\">On the one hand, P.D. historically has had good relations with the group of men with whom he is scheduled to live, his former and present longterm housemates from FDC; he also enjoys being around people; and he has a one-to-one direct care worker shadowing him to keep him safe. On the other hand, he generally does not interact with his peers. He is also easily agitated around unfamiliar staff. At times, such as when P.D. is sad or frustrated, he can become uncooperative, unpredictable, and aggressive and may engage in self-injurious behavior.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"12\">\n<p id=\"b868-7\">An ISP meeting will be held thirty days after the transfer occurs. Any continuing concerns may be addressed at that time. Even if the magistrate\u2019s directive to DDS cannot be specifically enforced, a failure by DDS to properly implement the provisions of P.D.\u2019s ISP, including his right \u201cto safely move about his home\u201d and his safety needs identified in the ISP, may always be challenged. See 115 Code Mass. Regs. \u00a7 6.31(9) (2009).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"13\">\n<p id=\"b868-8\">That finding about the guardians\u2019 intentions was supported by substantial evidence. In their five-page, single-spaced objection letter, the guardians unequivocally stated that <em>\u201c[P.D.J\u2019s Individual Support Plan (ISP) can not be implemented at the WDC.\u201d </em>Tracing the history of the <em>Ricci </em>litigation, the magistrate further found that the guardians had done all they could to forestall the closure of FDC in the Federal courts and that, notwithstanding the decision of the United States Court of Appeals for the First Circuit in <em>Ricci </em>v. <em>Patrick, </em>544 F.3d 8 (1st Cir. 2008), cert. denied, 556 U.S. 1166 (2009) <em>(Ricci V), </em>effectively upholding the legality of the closure, they had continued to oppose it.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"14\">\n<p id=\"b869-6\">See <em>M.D., supra </em>at 467 n.8, for discussion of <em>Ricci </em>class members\u2019 rights. P.D. is a <em>Ricci </em>class member.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"15\">\n<p id=\"b869-7\">Contrary to the guardians\u2019 assertions, there was evidence that Mark Lewis, P.D.\u2019s service coordinator (otherwise known as a QMRP), was involved in the transfer decision. Lewis not only attested to his role in recommending P.D.\u2019s placement at WDC, he participated in the ITP/ISP modification meeting.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"16\">\n<p id=\"b869-8\">The evidence showed that DDS did in fact identify several possible options for P.D. during the earlier stages of the placement-planning process. The guardians rejected all group home placements proposed by DDS as inappropriate. At no point did the guardians indicate to DDS that they were <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"830\">*830</page-number>willing to consider another placement for P.D. in a different residence within the WDC or a placement at the Hogan Regional Center (the only two intermediate care facilities to remain open under DOS\u2019s consolidation plan).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"17\">\n<p id=\"b870-10\">The consideration of more than one alternative placement was discussed in <em>M.D., supra </em>at 476 &amp; n.29. We are not persuaded by the guardians\u2019 argument.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"18\">\n<p id=\"b870-11\">The guardians have also raised the same certification issue as was raised in <em>M.D., supra </em>at 468-469. As we held in that decision, the certification process has no application to this interfacility transfer. <em>Id. </em>at 468-469 &amp; n.11.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
