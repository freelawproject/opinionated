L.H. appeals from a decree and findings of the Probate and Family Court that she was not competent to make medical decisions and would benefit from a proposed treatment plan to use the antipsychotic drug Risperdal, and that she would consent to use of that drug were she competent. L.H. also appeals from the judge\u2019s subsequent allowance of a motion to reinstate and to modify the treatment plan to allow for the administration by injection of Risperdal. The two appeals were consolidated here.</p>\n<p id=\"b752-5\">L.H. argues on appeal that there was insufficient evidence that the administration of antipsychotic medication was appropriate. In addition, L.H. argues that her trial counsel rendered ineffective assistance. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b752-6\">For the reasons addressed in part 1, we conclude that the evidence in these substituted judgment proceedings and the probate judge\u2019s findings established by a preponderance that L.H. was in need of treatment with antipsychotic drugs. See G. L. c. 190B, \u00a7 5-306A. See generally <em>Guardianship of Erma, </em>459 Mass. 801, 802 n.2 (2011) (discussing substituted judgment in context of involuntary administration of antipsychotic drugs). For the reasons addressed in part 2, we decline to reach the ineffective assistance of counsel claims in these direct appeals. First, such claims are not fully developed on this trial record and were not further developed in a motion for new trial. Second, based on the extant record that underlies the direct appeals, nothing has been made to appear that the standard of prejudice would be met in this particular case. A showing of prejudice is the governing standard for ineffective assistance claims in civil cases involving fundamental liberty interests in the administration of antipsychotic medication, such as presented in this case. See generally <em>Poe </em>v. <em>Sex Offender Registry Bd., </em>456 Mass. 801, 813 (2010), quoting from <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Mahar, </em>442 Mass. 11, 15 (2004) (prejudice in ineffectiveness claims is \u201ca \u2018reasonable probability\u2019 that \u2018but for counsel\u2019s unprofessional errors, the result of the proceeding would have been different\u2019 \u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b753-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"713\">*713</page-number>1. <em>Procedural background and trial evidence. </em>At the time these proceedings commenced, L.H., a fifty-seven year old woman, was living at the Lowell Health Care Center (LHCC), where she had resided since being admitted in October, 2009, having previously been a resident in a nursing home in New York. In addition to mental health issues, L.H. suffers from multiple sclerosis (MS), among other physical ailments, and requires a wheelchair. Her medical history included prior treatment with antipsychotic medication. In past times, L.H. had been homeless.</p>\n<p id=\"b753-5\">On November 30, 2009, LHCC staff members Mark O\u2019Flaherty and John Handren (collectively, petitioners) filed a petition in the Probate and Family Court seeking appointment of a guardian for L.H. pursuant to G. L. c. 190B, \u00a7 5-303. The petition later was amended to include a proposed antipsychotic treatment plan. Because L.H. challenges the commencement of the proceedings in the first instance, we note that Dr. Anthony Joseph, a psychiatrist, completed and signed the statutorily required medical certificates and supporting documentation, all of which were filed with the court as the proceedings began. These documents, including the medical affidavit and treatment plan, detail L.H.\u2019s physical and mental condition at the time the proceedings were commenced and, we conclude, justified the petition undertaken.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b753-6\">A hearing was held on August 30, 2010. The witnesses included Dr. Joseph of LHCC; Dr. David Rosmarin, an independent forensic psychiatrist retained by L.H.\u2019s court-appointed counsel; L.H.; and her court-appointed temporary guardian.</p>\n<p id=\"b754-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"714\">*714</page-number>Dr. Joseph provided a psychiatric diagnosis of borderline personality disorder, mood disorder, anxiety, and excessive compulsiveness, among other mental ailments. He noted that behavioral modification treatment had been ineffective. This psychiatrist testified that treatment with an antipsychotic medicine was proposed to decrease L.H.\u2019s agitation and paranoia so that ensuing behavioral treatment could become more effective, with the goal of returning L.H. to a supportive living environment in New York. While acknowledging that the proposed antipsychotic medicine, Risperdal, had side effects, the psychiatrist stated his medical opinion that it would be the preferred drug for L.H., and that the medication\u2019s side effects relative to its over-all effectiveness were within tolerable ranges. Specifically, the psychiatrist opined on this point as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b754-4\">\u201cThe thing with Risperdal, the reason why I choose it is I\u2019ve observed that in some people it can work very well at a very low dose and you don\u2019t get any or many side effects, which I think is the main attraction here. ... So my first hope would be to try and treat the agitation and the paranoia with something that essentially has no side effects or actually has no side effects. So I see that potential in Risperdal. That\u2019s the logic.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b754-5\">Regarding L.H.\u2019s prognosis if left untreated, Dr. Joseph predieted that she would \u201ccontinue the way she is,\u201d and added that he \u201cwould be very concerned about what kind of facility she would end up in in New York, how long they would keep her.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b754-9\">The second psychiatric expert witness, Dr. Rosmarin, who had been retained by counsel for L.H., also stated medical opinions that tended to support the position that L.H. would benefit from the proposed treatment plan. Dr. Rosmarin had examined L.H. at length, and had spoken with LHCC staff in detail. This psychiatrist diagnosed L.H. as having a personality disorder with obsessive compulsive symptoms and suggested she could benefit from treatment with antipsychotic medicine, although at a lower dose than was proposed: \u201cThis lady needs very careful management but with a very careful behavioral plan in concert possibly with two kinds of medications. One would be a very low dose of antipsychotic. I don\u2019t have an objection to that.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b755-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"715\">*715</page-number>L.H. testified in opposition to the treatment plan and to the use of antipsychotic medications. L.H. acknowledged that she had been homeless, suffers from MS, requires the use of a wheelchair, and needs physical assistance in her living situation. However, she did not believe guardianship was warranted, and she protested the use of antipsychotic drugs. She stated that when she previously had been treated with the proposed anti-psychotic Risperdal, she had experienced severe side effects and \u201cwould rather be dead than go on [Risperdal] again.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b755-5\">The guardian testified he had met with L.H., consulted with LHCC staff, and spoken with L.H.\u2019s sister on three or four occasions. Based on those discussions, the guardian stated, \u201cI think she needs some supervision and she needs some medication.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b755-6\">At the conclusion of the hearing, the judge found \u201cthat the testimony of the two physicians that have been proffered to the court today are really not diametrically opposed. They both appear to me to agree that treatment is needed, continuation of the guardianship is warranted and that the treatment plan as proposed, actually by both physicians, in my opinion, involves both medical treatment, a psychotropic drug treatment, together with a behavioral treatment.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b755-7\">In his findings of fact, the judge acknowledged L.H.\u2019s stated preference against the proposed antipsychotic medication, but found, listing the <em>Rogers </em>decisional factors,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> including but not limited to possible side effects, \u201cthat if [L.H.] could rationally <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"716\">*716</page-number>evaluate the side effectfs] described . . . , she would choose the Treatment Plan subject to the explanation that the use of the drugs would be properly managed and that . . . efforts [would be made to] continue to monitor the dosage within the lowest optimum range.\u201d<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b756-4\">Accordingly, the judge authorized the proposed treatment plan (with modifications proposed by Dr. Rosmarin and accepted by Dr. Joseph) and appointed a permanent guardian and <em>Rogers </em>monitor for L.H. The judge scheduled the treatment plan for review on December 6, 2010, the date the order was set to expire. The plan expired on schedule on December 6, 2010.</p>\n<p id=\"b756-5\">On September 1, 2011, staff of LHCC, as the petitioners, filed a motion in the Probate and Family Court to reinstate the <em>Rogers </em>order and to modify it to allow an injectable form of the antipsychotic medication to be administered because L.H. was refusing to take Risperdal orally. The testimony at this hearing reflected L.H.\u2019s persistent mental disabilities. Dr. Joseph provided a diagnosis similar to his medical opinion at the August, 2010, hearing, i.e., that L.H. suffered from \u201catypical psychosis\u201d with symptoms manifested as \u201cparanoia, agitation, [and] dysphoria .... Poor insight and judgment around the treatment of her mental illness.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b756-6\">Dr. Joseph also supported the modification of the treatment plan modification to include injectable medication, stating, \u201cMost likely she would become much less paranoid, much less agitated and would have a much improved quality of life in terms of her sense of well being and satisfaction.\u201d The prognosis <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"717\">*717</page-number>without antipsychotic medication was as follows: \u201cWithout treatment, she would continue to be agitated, dysphoric with a very impaired quality of life and . . . it\u2019s very likely she would end up in a chronic state psychiatric facility, either here or in New York.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b757-5\">As she had at the August, 2010, hearing, L.H. strenuously objected to antipsychotic treatment, stating, \u201cI was refusing to take the Risperdal because of the unbearable side effects. . . . I\u2019d rather be dead than go through that.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b757-6\">The judge allowed the motion to reinstate the <em>Rogers </em>order and to continue the treatment plan, and to modify the order for treatment to allow for an injectable form of drug administration.</p>\n<p id=\"b757-7\">As previously noted, this appeal concerns both the petition for guardianship and the order for administration of antipsychotic medication, as well as the reinstatement order with the modification for administration of the drug by injection.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> In arriving at the substituted judgment decision, the judge carefully weighed the applicable factors set forth in <em>Rogers, </em>see notes 2 and 3, <em>supra, </em>including (1) L.H.\u2019s expressed preferences to decline treatment with Risperdal; (2) consideration of L.H.\u2019s family, including that the guardian, who endorsed the plan, had spoken with L.H.\u2019s sister; (3) the balancing of adverse side effects against the benefits of treatment; (4) the prognosis without treatment; and (5) the prognosis with treatment. The judge also considered other relevant factors, including L.H.\u2019s physical condition and living arrangement and the goal of greater physical independence. See <em>Rogers, </em>390 Mass, at 505-507. Based on our review of the evidence \u2014 a great part of which we have detailed <em>supra </em>\u2014 with acknowledgment of the judge\u2019s convincingly formulated findings and analysis concerning the treatment plan after having heard all the evidence and seeing L.H. testify in two hearings, we agree that the guardianship and the treatment with antipsychotic medication were appropriate, and if competent, L.H. would consent thereto.</p>\n<p id=\"b757-8\">2. <em>Ineffective assistance of counsel. </em>In this appeal, L.H. also <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"718\">*718</page-number>contends that she received ineffective assistance of counsel. She raises a number of flaws in counsel\u2019s performance, including that her attorney did not adequately cross-examine Dr. Joseph (and asked questions in such an undirected manner that Dr. Joseph added information adverse to L.H.\u2019s position); did not present Dr. Rosmarin, her psychiatric expert, in a persuasive way; allowed Dr. Rosmarin to state opinions that were not consistent with her position against the administration of antipsychotic drugs; and presented a weak closing argument in which counsel \u2014 although advocating the position that L.H. would benefit from behavioral (not drug) treatment \u2014 seemingly undermined that position by conceding that L.H. needed anti-psychotic medication, although in a lesser dose than Dr. Joseph had recommended. (As noted, the modified dosage was incorporated in the judge\u2019s findings and decree.)</p>\n<p id=\"b758-5\">We bear in mind Supreme Judicial Court precedent that patients faced with the administration of antipsychotic drugs under a substituted judgment standard are entitled to the effective assistance of counsel. \u201c[I]n a proceeding that involves a person\u2019s liberty or a fundamental liberty interest, in which a person has a right to appointed counsel, from whatever source,[<footnotemark>5</footnotemark>] the person is entitled to the effective assistance of counsel whether counsel is appointed or retained.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Patton, </em>458 Mass. 119, 128 (2010). We bear in mind that issues concerning the administration of antipsychotic medications present fundamental liberty interests. \u201c[A] competent person has a constitutionally protected liberty interest in refusing unwanted medical treatment.\u201d <em>Cruzan </em>v. <em>Director, Mo. Dept. of Health, </em>497 U.S. 261, 278 (1990). \u201cThe right to refuse treatment or to discontinue treatment is based on a person\u2019s strong interest in being free from nonconsensual invasions of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"719\">*719</page-number>person\u2019s bodily integrity.\u201d <em>Guardianship of Doe, </em>411 Mass. 512, 517, cert. denied, 503 U.S. 950 (1992). However, even accepting these principles, we do not deem it appropriate to reach and to try to resolve the ineffective assistance claim posed by L.H. on the limited record that underlies these direct appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b759-5\">First, the trial record alone \u2014 absent further development by a new trial motion \u2014 does not provide us the necessary background to evaluate the attorney\u2019s tactical choices, nor his interaction with L.H., the client. On the one hand, criticism of counsel\u2019s performance is warranted, including his weak direct and cross-examination practice and an ambivalent closing argument. But then, we do not have before us what rationale drove counsel\u2019s trial strategy, nor how that strategic approach was affected by L.H.\u2019s psychiatric expert, who seemed to share the opinion (with the petitioners\u2019 expert) that L.H. would benefit from the administration of Risperdal. Nor do we have before us information concerning counsel\u2019s dealings with an incapacitated client, and what strategic choices may have been considered by counsel in light of what would be the tone and the substance of the testimony. For example, was there consideration by counsel that to allow Dr. Rosmarin to speak about a reduced dosage of Risperdal might be a fail-back position to avoid the larger dosage advocated by Dr. Joseph? Evidence that may contradict an incapacitated person\u2019s testimony that she is adverse to any medication does not per se give rise to ineffective assistance of counsel or (as discussed infra) prejudice in the ultimate judgment. In short, absent what might have been probed in a new trial motion, we cannot discern on this record alone what tactical choices and what client issues may have factored into counsel\u2019s performance.</p>\n<p id=\"b759-6\">As stated in <em>Patton, </em>458 Mass, at 128, in cases such as this, where the record is inchoate, the preferred mode to give backdrop for appellate review might have been by a motion for new trial, which, if denied, could be joined with a direct appeal. Such a new trial motion was not filed or adjudicated in this case. As the court wrote in Patton:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b759-7\">\u201cThe principle that emerges from these cases is that in a proceeding that involves a person\u2019s liberty or a fundamental liberty interest, in which a person has a right to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"720\">*720</page-number>appointed counsel, from whatever source, the person is entitled to the effective assistance of counsel whether counsel is appointed or retained. In addition, the outcome of that proceeding may, but need not, be attacked collaterally through a claim of ineffective assistance of counsel in a motion for a new trial.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b760-4\">\n<em>Ibid</em>\n<footnotemark>\n<em>6</em>\n</footnotemark>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b760-5\">Second, and more significantly as to why we decline to reach the ineffective assistance of counsel challenge in these direct appeals, is that what does exist in the record does not reflect that a different result would have obtained, and that there was prejudice in the findings and orders. In this respect, although Supreme Judicial Court precedent looks to the <em>Saferian </em>criminal standard in assessing ineffective assistance of counsel in a civil case involving fundamental privacy issues and the administration of antipsychotic drugs in a <em>Rogers </em>context, the <em>Saferian </em>standard is modified to focus on prejudice. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Saferian, </em>366 Mass. 89, 96 (1974). The Supreme Judicial Court has so stated as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b760-6\">\u201cIn <em>Care &amp; Protection of Georgette, </em>439 Mass. 28, 33 n.7 (2003), we recognized that the language \u2018otherwise available, substantial ground of defense\u2019 is \u2018criminal law terminology that does not precisely fit\u2019 civil cases in which there is a statutory right to counsel. In civil cases, we instead \u2018prefer to use the term \u201cprejudice.\u201d \u2019 <em>Id. </em>We have defined prejudice in ineffectiveness claims as \u2018a \u201creasonable probability\u201d that \u201cbut for counsel\u2019s unprofessional errors, the result of the proceeding would have been <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"721\">*721</page-number>different.\u201d \u2019 <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Mahar, </em>442 Mass, [at 15], quoting <em>Strickland </em>v. Washington, 466 U.S. 668, 694 (1984).\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b761-5\"><em>Poe, </em>456 Mass, at 812-813.</p>\n<p id=\"b761-6\">In this case, even given counsel\u2019s less-than-stellar performance, the evidence and the record of the proceedings, in our opinion, does not come close to meeting this legal standard of prejudice. To the contrary, taking the record as is, there is much strength in the evidence that supports the judge\u2019s decisions on substituted judgment to administer antipsychotic medications.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark>,<footnotemark>8</footnotemark>,<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b761-7\">\n<em>Decree entered September 3, 2010, affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b761-8\">\n<em>Order reinstating and expanding Rogers order, entered September 9, 2011, affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b753-7\">L.H.\u2019s argument that the petition was not warranted at the outset is countered by the medical certificate and the related documents. The petitioners state in these documents that they seek appointment of a guardian because \u201c[L.H.] is unable to participate in Health Care decisions and is currently refusing all care which will cause declining health.\u201d Dr. Joseph stated L.H. is \u201cvery unaware of her situation and mental illness, rejects care, [and has] poor insight and judgment.\u201d He stated in his subsequent documentation that she suffers from \u201cmultiple sclerosis, atypical psychosis, [and] borderline personality disorder\u201d and manifests symptoms such as \u201cagitation, poor compliance with medical care, paranoia, believing that others lie about her and wish to hurt her.\u201d He explained that L.H. is an inpatient in a \u201cneurobehavioral unit\u201d who was referred to LHCC by the State of New York \u201cas facilities in that state [are] unable to meet her intensive behavioral needs.\u201d He stated that antipsychotic medication is necessary to \u201creduce her agitation and paranoia, and improve her quality of life.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b755-8\">Under <em>Rogers, </em>at least six factors must be considered by a judge in arriving at the substituted judgment decision:</p>\n<p id=\"b755-9\">\u201cFirst, the judge must examine the patient\u2019s expressed preferences regarding treatment. If made while competent, such a preference is entitled to great weight unless the judge finds that the patient would have changed his opinion after reflection or in altered circumstances. . . . Second, the judge must evaluate the strength of the incompetent patient\u2019s religious convictions, to the extent that they may contribute to his refusal of treatment. . . . Third, the impact of the decision on the ward\u2019s family must be considered. . . . Fourth, the probability of adverse side effects must be considered. . . . Fifth, the prognosis without treatment is relevant to the substituted judgment decision. . . . Sixth, the prognosis with treatment must be examined. . . . Finally, the judge may review any other factors which appear relevant.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b755-10\"><em>Rogers, </em>390 Mass, at 505-506 (citations omitted).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b756-10\">The judge\u2019s comprehensive substituted judgment analysis and findings track the <em>Rogers </em>factors. That is, the judge, in pertinent part, found as follows:</p>\n<p id=\"b756-12\">\u201cThe proposed Treatment Plan is presented in good faith by Anthony Joseph, M.D. and is for the purpose of treating mental illness and not for administrative convenience. . . . [L.H.\u2019s] preference regarding the use of anti-psychotic medication has been to reject it. This expression was made during her testimony. . . . [L.H.\u2019s] religious beliefs do not preclude the use of the proposed treatment. . . . [L.H.\u2019s] sister, and her family are supportive of her treatment. . . . Prognosis with medication: good. Medication should control agitation and provide her comfort. ... Prognosis without medication: Poor. Deterioration over time.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b756-21\">L.H. did not voice any religious objections to the drug or reference the opinions of kin, both of which are relevant factors in an analysis under <em>Rogers.</em></p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b757-9\">The second appeal was filed on September 23, 2011. The plan, as noted, expired on December 6, 2010. However, given the reinstatement of the treatment, the appeal is not moot. See generally <em>Guardianship of Erma, </em>459 Mass, at 804-805.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b758-6\">The right to counsel in guardianship proceedings is set forth in G. L. c. 190B, \u00a7 5-306A(a), inserted by St. 2008, c. 521, \u00a7 9, which provides in part:</p>\n<p id=\"b758-7\">\u201cNo guardian . . . of a minor or an incapacitated person shall have the authority to consent to treatment for which substituted judgment determination may be required, provided that the court shall authorize such treatment [upon specific findings].

Such review adds another safeguard against the unwarranted administration of antipsychotic drugs where ineffective assistance of counsel claims in the offing are not patent on the record compiled for direct appeal, and where no new trial motion is filed.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b761-9\">The petitioners, the staff at LHCC, did not file an appellate brief, leaving only, as a party brief, that filed by L.H.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b761-10\">We acknowledge the joint amicus brief of the Mental Health Legal Advisors Committee, the Disability Law Center, and the Center for Public Representation.

Nor does the majority accept that we should turn for \u201cguidance\u201d to the performance guidelines of the Committee for Public Counsel Services. So too, the majority does not accept as necessary turning for \u201cguidance\u201d to the law of other States (see, e.g., the heavy reliance in the dissent upon the decision of the New Jersey Supreme Court in <em>Matter of M.R., </em>135 N.J. 155 [1994], and the reliance on the law of other State cases in note 5, <em>post). </em>The majority, of course, agrees that the Massachusetts Rules of Professional Conduct operate ex proprio vigore in this case. But, even assuming that the standards of the ethical rules were not met by counsel \u2014 a point that we reject \u2014\u25a0 that would not change the final result because, based on the evidence, the controlling prejudice standard was not met, as discussed <em>supra. </em>Finally, the majority rejects the dissent\u2019s proposal that we should sua sponte order a new trial, when no new trial motion was filed in the Probate and Family Court.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b762-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"722\">*722</page-number>Agnes, J.</author>\n<p id=\"Abi\">(dissenting). With a significant loss of liberty and her own bodily integrity at stake, L.H., though represented by appointed counsel throughout these proceedings, was left without an advocate for her interests, and was forced to express those interests herself in the face of cross-examination, expert testimony, and argument against her by her own counsel. While L.H. repeatedly asserted that the side effects of the antipsychotic medication caused \u201canxiety [and] despair\u201d and felt like \u201ctorture,\u201d and that she would \u201crather be dead\u201d than take it, her counsel took the position of the adversary, Lowell Health Care Center (LHCC), specifically, two staff members of LHCC (collectively, petitioners). Just as L.H.\u2019s counsel and expert advocated, the August 30, 2010, hearing resulted in orders for her guardianship and for the involuntary administration of an anti-psychotic drug, Risperdal. The majority maintains that despite this predicament, L.H. was not deprived of the effective assistance of counsel because the record does not reveal whether her counsel\u2019s actions were strategic and, in any case, because there was ample evidence to support the Probate and Family Court judge\u2019s decisions. I disagree. When a client\u2019s interests are not represented by her attorney and a judge\u2019s decision relies upon testimony and argument arising from the client\u2019s attorney\u2019s deficient representation,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> the client suffers prejudice and is denied the effective assistance of counsel. Accordingly, I respectfully dissent.</p>\n<p id=\"b762-5\">a. <em>L.H. \u2019s attorney knew his client\u2019s interests. </em>Over the course of three hearings, L.H. made her position clear to counsel and to the judge. At an abbreviated hearing on August 16, 2010, L.H. expressed her unequivocal opposition to the administration of antipsychotic medications. At the hearing on August 30, 2010, she testified that she had taken a low dose of Risperdal a few years earlier for a several-month period and had experienced \u201csevere side effects\u201d including loss of bladder control, vision problems, pain, anxiety, and despair. She added, \u201cI\u2019d rather you kill me than go through that again.\u201d L.H. also indicated that as <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"723\">*723</page-number>far back as the 1980s, before she was diagnosed with multiple sclerosis (MS), she had taken an antipsychotic medication called Haldol, which also caused severe side effects. At the end of the hearing, L.H. asked to address the judge and restated her concerns about the side effects of antipsychotic medications. She stated, \u201cI\u2019d rather be dead. . . . [Pjlease don\u2019t let them hurt me .... I can\u2019t go back there. I\u2019m begging for my life.\u201d L.H. also testified at the reinstatement hearing on September 1, 2011, and described the side effects she had experienced from Risperdal. She said, \u201cI had extreme exacerbation of my anxiety and my migraine variance, which made me . . . catatonic.\u201d She added, \u201cI started chewing my mouth hours at a time,\u201d and \u201cI\u2019ve had . . . these reactions to similar medications before.\u201d She explained that her refusal to take Risperdal was \u201cbecause of the unbearable side effects,\u201d adding, \u201cI\u2019d rather be dead than go through that.\u201d She described her condition as follows: \u201cI\u2019m not psychotic, I am not paranoid. I am neurotic, I\u2019m anxious, I\u2019m traumatized.\u201d To conclude her testimony, she said, \u201cYour Honor, the reason I came here today, as sick as I am, is, again, when I was last here I told you I was on these medications before with disastrous consequences.\u201d In short, L.H. was familiar with the effects of antipsychotic medication and was strongly opposed to taking them.</p>\n<p id=\"b763-8\">b. <em>Right to refuse medical treatment. </em>Under Massachusetts law, every person has the right to accept or to reject medical treatment, even when the decision is contrary to the express wishes of qualified medical personnel acting in what they consider to be the person\u2019s best interests. See <em>Superintendent of Belchertown State Sch. </em>v. <em>Saikewicz, </em>373 Mass. 728, 738-739, 745 (1977); <em>Guardianship of Roe, </em>383 Mass. 415, 433-435 (1981); <em>Harnish </em>v. <em>Children\u2019s Hosp.

Ry. Co. </em>v. <em>Botsford, </em>141 U.S. 250, 251 (1891).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Moreover, there are \u201cfew legitimate medical procedures <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"724\">*724</page-number>which are more intrusive than the forcible injection of antipsychotic medication.\u201d <em>Guardianship of Roe, supra </em>at 436.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b764-5\">This right is enjoyed equally by those who may be incompetent as well as by the competent \u201cbecause the value of human dignity extends to both. ... To protect the incompetent person within its power, the State must recognize the dignity and worth of such a person and afford to that person the same panoply of rights and choices it recognizes in competent persons.\u201d <em>Rogers </em>v. <em>Commissioner of the Dept. of Mental Health, </em>390 Mass. 489, 499-500 (1983), quoting from <em>Saikewicz, </em>373 Mass, at 745-746. When, due to mental illness, a person lacks the capacity to consent to medical treatment, the methodology to preserve and to implement free choice and self-determination is substituted judgment. In proceedings both for guardianship and for treatment based on substituted judgment, a judge has an obligation to determine, whenever it is possible, the allegedly incapacitated person\u2019s \u201cdesires and intentions.\u201d <em>Guardianship of Zaltman, </em>65 Mass. App. Ct. 678, 685 (2006). In fact, the incapacitated person\u2019s personal preference is regarded as a \u201ccritical factor\u201d in the judge\u2019s decision:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b764-6\">\u201cAn individual\u2019s stated preference has traditionally been considered a \u2018critical factor\u2019 by courts in determining mat<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"725\">*725</page-number>ters of guardianship. . . . Even if [the ward] lacked the capacity to make [her own] treatment decisions at the time, [her] expressed preference \u2018must be treated as a critical factor in the determination of [her] \u201cbest interests,\u201d \u2019 . . . since it is the patient\u2019s true desire that the court must ascertain. . . . [Procedural intricacies and technical niceties must yield to the need to know the actual values and preferences of the ward.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b765-4\"><em>Id. </em>at 685-686 (citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b765-5\">The law acknowledges that there are differing degrees of incapacitation, that among those who are found to be incapacitated and in need of guardianship there are persons who have \u201cdecision-making capability\u201d as to some though not all of then-personal affairs, and that \u201ca mentally ill person may still possess the faculties to have an informed opinion about her treat-<em>Id. </em>at 687 (citations omitted). See <em>Matter of Spring, </em>8 Mass. App. Ct. 831, 838 (1979), <em>S.C., </em>380 Mass. 629 (1980) (\u201cwhen a person becomes incompetent to formulate a lucid judgment he is not thereby stripped of the right of choice enjoyed by others in the making of treatment decisions\u201d). In short, L.H. had a right to assert her refusal of treatment, and to have that refusal considered by the judge.</p>\n<p id=\"b765-7\">c. <em>Counsel\u2019s duty to represent L.H.\u2019s interests. </em>Although L.H.\u2019s right to counsel is based on provisions of the Massachusetts Uniform Probate Code, specifically, G. L. c. 190B, \u00a7\u00a7 5-106(a) and 5-306A(a), her counsel\u2019s obligations are defined by common and constitutional law, and rules established by the Supreme Judicial Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b765-8\">1. <em>Case law. </em>An observation in the very helpful amicus brief, submitted jointly by the Mental Health Legal Advisors Committee, the Disability Law Center, and the Center for Public Representation, deserves emphasis: \u201c[e]mpirical studies establish that the quality of counsel is the single most important factor determining the disposition of hearings related to involuntary medical care.\u201d<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> The emerging consensus of the State courts that have considered the issue in recent years is that the \u201cattorney\u2019s role is not to determine whether the client is competent to make <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"726\">*726</page-number>a decision, but to advocate the decision that the client makes.\u201d <em>Matter of M.R., </em>135 N.J. 155, 176 (1994).<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b766-5\">In <em>Matter of M.R., </em>the New Jersey Supreme Court explained why it is vital that the lawyer represent the stated interests of a client who may be under a disability:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b766-6\">\u201cAdvocacy that is diluted by excessive concern for the client\u2019s best interests would raise troubling questions for attorneys in an adversarial system.

Further, \u2018if counsel has already concluded that his client needs \u201chelp,\u201d \u2019 he is more likely to provide only procedural formality, rather than vigorous representation. . . . Finally, the attorney who undertakes to act according to a best-interest standard may be forced to make decisions concerning the client\u2019s mental capacity that the attorney is unqualified to make.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b767-5\"><em>Id. </em>at 176-177.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b767-6\">2. <em>Massachusetts Rules of Professional Conduct. </em>Supreme Judicial Court Rule 3:07, as appearing in 426 Mass. 1303 (1998), i.e., the Rules of Professional Conduct, directly addresses the obligations of counsel in cases \u201cwhen a client\u2019s capacity to make adequately considered decisions ... is diminished . . . because of . . . mental impairment.\u201d Mass.R.Prof.C. 1.14(a), as appearing in 452 Mass. 1301 (2008). Rule 1.14 provides that \u201cthe lawyer shall, as far as reasonably possible, maintain a normal client-lawyer relationship with the client.\u201d This means that when an attorney represents a client with diminished capacity due to mental illness, counsel still has the duties to provide competent representation, see Mass.R.Prof.C. 1.1, 426 Mass. 1308 (1998); to seek the lawful objectives of the client, see Mass.R.Prof.C. 1.2, 426 Mass. 1310 (1998); to act reasonably diligently and to represent her zealously, see Mass.R.Prof.C. 1.3, 426 Mass. 1313 (1998); to maintain communications with and advise the client, see Mass.R.Prof.C. 1.4, 426 Mass. 1314 (1998); and to maintain client confidences as far as reasonably possible, see Mass.R.Prof.C. 1.6, 426 Mass. 1435 (1998).<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b768-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"728\">*728</page-number>It should be noted that in circumstances in which a lawyer concludes that the client \u201cinsists upon pursuing an objective that the lawyer considers repugnant or imprudent,\u201d the Rules of Professional Conduct permit the lawyer to withdraw from the representation. Mass.R.Prof.C. 1.16(b)(3), (c), 426 Mass. 1369 (1998). See, e.g., <em>Red Dog </em>v. <em>State, </em>625 A.2d 245, 247 (Del. 1993) (attorney allowed to withdraw from representation of criminal defendant who made deliberate decision to accept death penalty). No motion to withdraw was filed in this case. Until a motion to withdraw is allowed, counsel\u2019s duty of zealous advocacy is paramount.</p>\n<p id=\"b768-5\">3. <em>Committee for Public Counsel Services performance standards. </em>A third source of important guidance to Massachusetts lawyers who face the challenge of representing a client with diminished capacity due to mental illness in substituted judgment proceedings is the Committee for Public Counsel Services (CPCS). Pursuant to G. L. c. 211D, \u00a7\u00a7 <em>6(b) </em>and 9, CPCS has promulgated \u201cperformance standards governing the representation of indigent adults in guardianship proceedings under G. L. c. 190B (including \u2018substituted judgment\u2019 matters) and in authorization to treat proceedings under G. L. c. 123\u201d (CPCS guidelines), which \u201cdescribe the steps which must, at a minimum, be taken by an attorney\u201d assigned to represent an adult client in guardianship proceedings as well as in proceedings seeking the authority to administer antipsychotic medication. Guideline 1 states that counsel for L.H. \u201cmust oppose the [substituted judgment] petition and present \u2018all reasonable alternatives\u2019 to the proffered treatment.\u201d <footnotemark>8</footnotemark>\u2019<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> Furthermore, guideline 12 states that counsel must \u201cact as a zealous advocate for the client, insuring <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"729\">*729</page-number>that proper procedures are followed and that the client\u2019s interests are well represented.\u201d<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b769-5\">Under both Mass.R.Prof.C. 1.14 and the CPCS guidelines, any differences notwithstanding, a lawyer in a guardianship case must oppose the petition and must zealously advocate for the client. More specifically, pursuant to guideline 12, the lawyer must \u201c(a) file any and all appropriate motions and legal memoranda, including but not limited to motions regarding the assertion of privileges and confidential relationships, and the admission, exclusion or limitation of evidence; (b) present and cross-examine witnesses, and provide evidence in support of the client\u2019s position; (c) make any and all appropriate evidentiary objections and offers of proof, so as to preserve the record on appeal; and (d) take any and all other necessary and appropriate actions to advocate for the client\u2019s interests.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b769-6\">The adversarial model does not place counsel for a mentally <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"730\">*730</page-number>ill or even incompetent client in an ethical quandary. In the adversarial model, there will be a decision by a neutral and detached judge that is the product of evidence produced with the aid of vigorous advocacy from a petitioner\u2019s counsel and a client\u2019s counsel, as well as input from the guardian ad litem. It is simply not the role of the client\u2019s counsel to assume responsibilities that belong to others.</p>\n<p id=\"b770-5\">d. <em>Counsel failed to represent L.H. \u2019s interests. </em>My analysis of counsel\u2019s representation focuses on two hearings: one held on August 30, 2010, and a second held on September 1, 2011. At both hearings, L.H.\u2019s counsel actively worked against her interests.</p>\n<p id=\"b770-6\">1. <em>August 30, 2010, hearing. </em>At this hearing, counsel for the petitioners informed the judge that in addition to a permanent guardianship, they also sought approval to treat L.H. with Risperdal. One of the petitioners\u2019 witnesses was Dr. Anthony Joseph, a psychiatrist. On cross-examination of Joseph, L.H.\u2019s counsel went farther than petitioners\u2019 counsel and elicited information about Joseph\u2019s role at LHCC, his interactions with L.H., her medical and psychiatric history, and the basis for his opinion that she required antipsychotic medication. When prompted by L.H.\u2019s counsel, Joseph gave examples of her paranoid behavior from his personal interactions with her, such as her belief that staff persons at LHCC had tried to harm her. Joseph also was given the opportunity to expand upon his own recommended treatment using antipsychotic medication and to explain how it would have only a few side effects.</p>\n<p id=\"b770-7\">Counsel for L.H. also called Dr. David Rosmarin as an expert witness. With Rosmarin\u2019s testimony, counsel severely damaged his client\u2019s position. Contrary to L.H.\u2019s explicit and consistent wishes, her counsel elicited from Rosmarin his view that she was not credible, that she presently was incapable of living independently in the community, that she needed to have a guardian, and that she needed behavioral treatment and antipsychotic medication. Rosmarin testified, in a narrative style, that L.H. suffers from MS, and added that she was \u201cintentionally uncooperative on physical exam\u201d and was \u201cmalingering additional effects of weakness.\u201d He noted that L.H. did not have significant cognitive impairment from MS, but \u201ccontrary to her testimony\u201d she was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"731\">*731</page-number>admitted to the mental health system in New York because her apartments \u201cwere uninhabitable from a hygienic point.\u201d Rosmarin testified further that L.H. has \u201cpsychiatric overlays\u201d to her MS, including a \u201cpersonality disorder\u201d that \u201cgrades into, briefly, paranoia.\u201d He added that she was either \u201clying\u201d about the abuse she suffered in an effort to get out of LHCC or paranoid. Rosmarin opined that L.H. needed a \u201cstrict behavioral program\u201d as opposed to her current program, which he believed was too willing to meet her \u201cbizarre\u201d demands. As for medications, Rosmarin opined that she needed \u201ca very low dose of antipsychotic [s]. \u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b771-6\">In his closing argument, L.H.\u2019s counsel conceded his client\u2019s position. He argued that \u201cshe needs behavioral treatment more than and perhaps instead of the antipsychotic medications.\u201d However, he then agreed with the judge that L.H.\u2019s expert indeed had testified that she also needed antipsychotic medication, adding only that Rosmarin favored a lower dose of it than Joseph.</p>\n<p id=\"b771-8\">The lack of opposition by L.H.\u2019s counsel and expert was the basis for the judge\u2019s determination. At the hearing, the judge stated that \u201cthe testimony of the two physicians that have been proffered to the court today are really not diametrically opposed. They both appear to me to agree that treatment is needed, continuation of the guardianship is warranted, and that the treatment plan as proposed, actually by both physicians, in my opinion, involve both medical treatment, a psychotropic drug treatment, together with a behavioral treatment.\u201d<footnotemark>11</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"AeG\">2. <em>September 1, 2011, hearing. </em>On September 1, 2011, the judge conducted a hearing on the petitioners\u2019 motion to reinstate the <em>Rogers </em>order, which had expired in December, 2010. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"732\">*732</page-number>Counsel for the petitioners informed the judge, without objection, that the original order was the result of an \u201cuncontested\u201d proceeding, and that LHCC wanted both to reinstate the order and to obtain approval for the administration of Risperdal by injection as opposed to orally because L.H. was \u201crefusing periodically\u201d to take her medication.</p>\n<p id=\"b772-5\">Counsel also failed to object to the hearsay testimony by Thomas B. Concannon, the guardian and <em>Rogers </em>monitor. When asked if he had \u201can opinion with regard to the proposed amendment to put the intramuscular Risperdal on the <em>Rogers </em>treatment,\u201d he answered, without objection, \u201cFrom talking to the social workers, I think it\u2019s worth trying.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b772-6\">The final witness to testify was L.H. After repeating some of her earlier complaints, and being assured by the judge that she had been heard, L.H.\u2019s lawyer addressed this remark to his client: \u201cYou need to understand that he\u2019s not listening to anything more. I told you you had to stop. I said stand up, speak up, shut up.\u201d The judge ruled that, based on the testimony of the three witnesses, the <em>Rogers </em>order was reinstated and expanded.</p>\n<p id=\"b772-7\">e. <em>Prejudice to L.H. by counsel\u2019s failure to represent her interests. </em>Ordinarily, a claim of ineffective assistance of counsel will not be considered for the first time on appeal. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Zinser, </em>446 Mass. 807, 811 (2006). However, \u201cwhen the factual basis of the claim appears indisputably on the trial record,\u201d the rule is more flexible. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Keon K., </em>70 Mass. App. Ct. 568, 573-574 (2007). See generally <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Frisino, </em>21 Mass. App. Ct. 551 (1986). See also <em>In re V.V., </em>349 S.W.3d 548, 587-588 (Tex. App. 2010) (noting \u201cshocking brevity\u201d of petitioner\u2019s parental rights termination trial; among counsel\u2019s numerous failings was failure to object to prejudicial evidence offered against client). As noted <em>supra, </em>counsel for L.H. (1) failed to object to prejudicial hearsay testimony by Concannon; (2) failed to object to Concannon\u2019s unqualified expert opinion that L.H. \u201cneeds some medication\u201d; (3) enhanced the weight of the testimony by Joseph on direct examination as to L.H.\u2019s incapacity and need for antipsychotic medication by filling in the missing gaps through cross-examination of Joseph;<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> (4) severely damaged the position he <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"733\">*733</page-number>outlined in his opening statement (opposition to the administration of any antipsychotics) by calling Rosmarin as a witness and allowing him to testify in a narrative form that (a) L.H. was not credible; (b) she required a guardian and needed the administration of antipsychotics (albeit in a dose lower than that recommended by Joseph); and (c) in most respects he agreed with and supported the assessment and recommendations made by Joseph; and (5) effectively conceded in an exchange with the judge that it would be appropriate for L.H. to be given some dose of an antipsychotic. Counsel, in effect, conceded the truth of the petitioners\u2019 case.</p>\n<p id=\"b773-5\">Just as \u201cunauthorized concessions of guilt\u201d may constitute presumptive prejudice for purposes of ineffective assistance claims in criminal cases, <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Velez, </em>77 Mass. App. Ct. 270, 277 n.9 (2010), prejudice should be found in guardianship proceedings involving a request for a <em>Rogers </em>order in which the client has unequivocally and consistently opposed the administration of antipsychotics, but L.H.\u2019s counsel, in effect, concedes that she would benefit from the administration of some dose of antipsychotic medication.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark>\u2019<footnotemark>14</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b773-6\">Nothing useful would be accomplished by remanding this case for a factual inquiry by the judge because the decisions made by L.H.\u2019s counsel were contrary to the express wishes of his client, and thus manifestly unreasonable. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Satterfield, </em>373 Mass. 109, 115 (1977) (there may be cases \u201cwhere the defense was so botched\u201d that there would be no value in factual inquiry as to prejudice).</p>\n<p id=\"b773-7\">f. <em>Conclusion. </em>In <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Saferian, </em>366 Mass. 89 (1974), the Supreme Judicial Court rightly warned that if the doctrine of ineffective assistance of counsel developed into a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"734\">*734</page-number>right to a new trial whenever it is demonstrated that counsel\u2019s performance was deficient when measured against that of the reasonably competent attorney, judges \u201cwould become Penelopes, forever engaged in unravelling the webs they wove.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 99, quoting from <em>Jorgensen </em>v. <em>York Ice Mach. Corp., </em>160 F.2d 432, 435 (2d Cir.), cert. denied, 332 U.S. 764 (1947). However, apart from whether I believe the outcome of a new trial would be different, the integrity of the adversarial process is at risk when counsel\u2019s deficiencies suppress the expression of his client\u2019s interests. As the Montana Supreme Court observed when addressing a similar issue in <em>Matter of K.G.F., </em>306 Mont. 1, 14 (2001):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b774-5\">\u201cHowever enlightened we, as a society, may have become in the intervening 75 years since <em>Buck </em>v. <em>Bell, </em>[274 U.S. 200 (1927),] we must nevertheless be cautious and critical of signs of paternalism legitimized by the <em>parens patriae </em>doctrine, where State actors purport to have an absolute understanding of what is in the best interests of an individual, whose liberty, dignity and privacy are at issue, and whose voice is muted by the swift and overriding authority of court-appointed professionals.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b774-6\">To ensure that the right to effective assistance of counsel does not become a hollow promise, it is imperative that we order a new trial when, as in this case, the record demonstrates that court-appointed counsel not only failed to advocate for his Ghent\u2019s interests, but became an advocate for the very position his client opposed.
