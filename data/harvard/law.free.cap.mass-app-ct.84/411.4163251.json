L. c. 152, \u00a7 1(7A), as inserted by St. 1986, c. 662, \u00a7 6. At issue in this case is whether a workplace investigatory interview causing employee Joseph Upton\u2019s emotional disability constituted a bona fide personnel action within the meaning of \u00a7 1(7A) of the workers\u2019 compensation act (act). An administrative judge of the Department of Industrial Accidents (department) concluded that it did and, accordingly, denied Upton\u2019s claim. The department\u2019s reviewing board (board) reversed; it reasoned that the interview did not constitute a personnel action because it did not alter Upton\u2019s employment status or his employment relationship. For the following reasons, we conclude that the interview was a personnel <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"412\">*412</page-number>action within the meaning of the act and therefore hold that Upton is not entitled to workers\u2019 compensation benefits for any resulting disability.</p>\n<p id=\"b452-4\"><em>Background. </em>The material facts are largely undisputed. They include a history of long-running litigation. Our summary draws from the uncontested subsidiary findings of the administrative judge and the facts settled by prior decisions of the Supreme Judicial Court and this court.</p>\n<p id=\"b452-5\">In 1991, at age twenty-four, Upton began work as a jail officer of the Suffolk County sheriff\u2019s department (sheriff). In 1999, two other jail officers assaulted an inmate while Upton was on duty. See <em>Sheriff of Suffolk County </em>v. <em>Jail Officers &amp; Employees of Suffolk County, </em>451 Mass. 698, 699 (2008) <em>(Sheriff of Suffolk County I). </em>A disciplinary hearing officer found that Upton had filed false and untimely reports about the assault; had provided false information regarding the incident to the sheriff\u2019s investigative division; and had failed to maintain the log book in his unit. Upton was terminated. <em>Ibid. </em>He grieved the termination to arbitration. In March of 2001, the arbitrator reduced the sanction to a six-month suspension without pay and ordered Upton\u2019s reinstatement with back pay and benefits for any time span beyond the six months, \u201cless any outside earnings and/or unemployment compensation.\u201d <em>Sheriff of Suffolk County </em>v. <em>Jail Officers &amp; Employees of Suffolk County, </em>465 Mass. 584, 586 (2013) <em>(Sheriff of Suffolk County II).</em></p>\n<p id=\"b452-6\">The sheriff appealed from the arbitration order to the Superior Court upon the ground that it violated \u201cwell-defined public policy.\u201d See <em>Sheriff of Suffolk County I, supra </em>at 699-700. A judge of the Superior Court confirmed the arbitrator\u2019s award; this court affirmed that judgment. <em>Sheriff of Suffolk County </em>v. <em>Jail Officers &amp; Employees of Suffolk County, </em>62 Mass. App. Ct. 915 (2004). Thereafter the Supreme Judicial Court denied the sheriff\u2019s application for further appellate review without prejudice and remanded the case to the Appeals Court for reconsideration in light of its decision in <em>Boston </em>v. <em>Boston Police Patrolmen\u2019s Assn., </em>443 Mass. 813 (2005), addressing public policy grounds for vacation of arbitration awards. See <em>Sheriff of Suffolk County I, supra </em>at 700. This court then affirmed the Superior Court judgment confirming the arbitrator\u2019s award. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"413\">*413</page-number><em>Sheriff of Suffolk County </em>v. <em>Jail Officers &amp; Employees of Suffolk County, </em>68 Mass. App. Ct. 903 (2007). Subsequently the Supreme Judicial Court granted the sheriff\u2019s application for further appellate review. In 2008, nearly nine years after the underlying incident, the Supreme Judicial Court affirmed the judgment of the Superior Court confirming the arbitrator\u2019s award.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> <em>Sheriff of Suffolk County I, supra </em>at 703.</p>\n<p id=\"b453-5\">In accordance with the arbitrator\u2019s order, the sheriff reinstated Upton, and he resumed work as a jail officer in August of 2008. Under the terms of the order, the sheriff owed Upton back wages, less any outside earnings and unemployment compensation accrued by him after termination. The sheriff prepared an \u201coffset earnings\u201d document detailing Upton\u2019s outside earnings during the relevant time period. In September, 2008, Upton signed this document under the pains and penalties of perjury. See <em>Sheriff of Suffolk County II, supra </em>at 587.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Shortly thereafter, the sheriff uncovered new information suggesting that Upton had failed to disclose all his posttermination earnings. On November 25, 2008, two investigators from the sheriff\u2019s office called Upton into a meeting to discuss this possible discrepancy. In accordance with the governing collective bargaining agreement, a representative from Upton\u2019s union attended the meeting as well.</p>\n<p id=\"b453-6\">Shortly after the meeting, Upton went to a hospital emergency room with complaints of shortness of breath, tingling in his arm, and pain in his chest. He was unable to return to work, and filed a claim for \u00a7 34 total incapacity benefits, and alternatively for \u00a7 35 partial incapacity benefits, medical benefits under G. L. c. 152, \u00a7\u00a7 13 and 30, \u00a7 50 interest, and attorney\u2019s fees and costs under \u00a7 13A. On May 18, 2009, an administra<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"414\">*414</page-number>tive judge denied his claim. Upton appealed, and a hearing went forward before the same administrative judge over four days in January, February, and March of 2010. In September of 2010, the administrative judge denied Upton\u2019s claim on the ground that his disability had resulted from a bona fide personnel action under \u00a7 1(7A).</p>\n<p id=\"b454-5\">Upton appealed, and the board reversed. It concluded that the investigative interview causing his injury was not a personnel action because it did not alter Upton\u2019s employment status or his employment relationship. It was not \u201cakin to \u2018a transfer, promotion, demotion, or termination,\u2019 \u201d and therefore, the board reasoned, did not constitute a personnel action under the act. The board ordered a de novo hearing upon the extent of Upton\u2019s disability. It is undisputed that Upton was unable to work for a period of time after the investigatory interview (i.e., the end of November, 2008, until October 20, 2010) and that that disability resulted from his emotional reaction to the investigative interview.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b454-6\"><em>Analysis. </em>Our task is to determine whether the workplace meeting resulting in Upton\u2019s emotional disability constituted a personnel action within the meaning of \u00a7 1(7A) of the act. We conclude that employer conduct need not alter an employee\u2019s status or his employment relationship to constitute personnel action under \u00a7 1(7A). Employer conduct such as supervisory criticism or questioning, which may lead to status-altering events such as termination or demotion, can constitute personnel action. We view the investigative interview injuring Upton to have been personnel action within the meaning of \u00a7 1(7A) and therefore hold that he is not entitled to workers\u2019 compensation benefits.</p>\n<p id=\"b454-7\">We begin with an examination of the words of the statute, \u201cbut not in isolation from the statute\u2019s purpose or divorced from reason and common sense.\u201d <em>DiGiacomo </em>v. <em>Metropolitan Property &amp; Cas. Ins. Co., 66 </em>Mass. App. Ct. 343, 346 (2006). As always, we interpret a statute \u201caccording to the intent of the Legislature ascertained from all its words construed by the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"415\">*415</page-number>ordinary and approved usage of the language, considered in connection with the cause of its enactment, the mischief or imperfection to be remedied and the main object to be accomplished, to the end that the purpose of its framers may be effectuated.\u201d <em>Hanlon </em>v. <em>Rollins, </em>286 Mass. 444, 447 (1934). In short, we study a provision\u2019s language and its purpose. See <em>Sullivan </em>v. <em>Brookline, </em>435 Mass. 353, 360 (2001), and cases cited. And, in circumstances of an administrative scheme, we weigh the view of the agency charged with implementation of the provision. See <em>Board of Educ. </em>v. <em>Assessor of Worcester, </em>368 Mass. 511, 515-516 (1975), and cases cited.</p>\n<p id=\"b455-5\">1. <em>Language. </em>In relevant part, G. L. c. 152, \u00a7 1(7A), recites that \u201c[n]o mental or emotional disability arising principally out of a bona fide, personnel action including a transfer, promotion, demotion, or termination except such action which is the intentional infliction of emotional harm shall be deemed to be a personal injury within the meaning of this chapter.\u201d If the Legislature had intended to define personnel action exclusively as transfer, promotion, demotion, or termination, it would have used the phrase \u201cconsisting of\u201d rather than \u201cincluding.\u201d The word \u201cincluding\u201d implies some additional actions and, infer-ably, activity leading up to such actions as the listed ones. As the administrative judge accurately observed, \u201c[a] personnel action can be a process.\u201d The climactic event of a transfer, promotion, demotion, termination, or other significant change of status seldom emerges from a procedural vacuum.</p>\n<p id=\"b455-6\">The board reasoned that the Legislature could have applied the phrase \u201cincluding but not limited to\u201d as the introduction to the described job actions if it had intended other events or procedures to fall within the meaning of \u201cpersonnel action.\u201d It had used that phrase to exclude from coverage \u201cvoluntary participation in any recreational activity, including but not limited to athletic events, parties, and picnics\u201d sponsored by the employer, \u00a7 1(7A), second sentence, inserted by St. 1985, c. 572, \u00a7 11. The absence of the words \u201cnot limited to\u201d contributed to the board\u2019s conclusion that the Legislature was limiting the meaning of personnel action only to conduct in the nature of transfer, promotion, demotion, and termination.</p>\n<p id=\"b455-7\">In our view, that interpretation gives too much weight to a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"416\">*416</page-number>minor difference in phrasing between two sentences inserted at different times and as part of different exceptions. \u201cThe various sentences of \u00a7 1(7A) were adopted piecemeal over time and are best understood not as an all-encompassing definition of compensable \u2018personal injury,\u2019 but, rather, as a series of legislative responses to specific court decisions and perceived needs for targeted reform.\u201d <em>Cornetta\u2019s Case, </em>68 Mass. App. Ct. 107, 114 (2007). The Legislature inserted the exclusion of a bona fide personnel action by St. 1986, c. 662, \u00a7 6, a year after the enacted exception for recreational activity and in response to the decision of <em>Kelly\u2019s Case, </em>394 Mass. 684, 684-685, 687 (1985) (permitting compensation for emotional injury resulting from notification of layoff and transfer).</p>\n<p id=\"b456-5\">A final point is in order. It is undisputed that the original \u201ctermination\u201d of Upton in 2000 constituted a personnel action and set in motion a marathon process of arbitration and adjudication over the ensuing years. The arbitrator\u2019s award of finite suspension and a computation of back pay comprised an integral part of that process. In 2008, the parties were still resolving the back pay element of the award by the determination of the genuine amount of Upton\u2019s independent income during the period of separation. The investigative interview sought to determine that amount and to implement finally the arbitral award of years before. It was an event within the boundaries of the original and continuing personnel action and not an afterthought or a remedial detail unrelated to the original termination sanction. It was the final remedial stage of the extended personnel action.</p>\n<p id=\"b456-6\">2. <em>Purpose. </em>The personnel action exception was one element of a sustained legislative pattern in the 1980s and 1990s \u201cto rein in compensation for work-related mental and emotional disabilities unassociated with physical injury.\u201d <em>Cornetta\u2019s Case, supra </em>at 117. On three separate occasions the Legislature restricted the coverage of such injuries. In 1985, it amended \u00a7 1(7A) to make it clear that the act bars recovery for purely emotional injuries unless the employee can prove that \u201can event or series of events in the workplace\u201d was \u201ca contributing cause\u201d of the injury. <em>Id. </em>at 116. In 1986, the Legislature heightened the standard of causation by requiring that the cited workplace <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"417\">*417</page-number>event be a \u201csignificant contributing cause\u201d of the employee\u2019s emotional injury. In the same legislation, it inserted the personnel action exception at issue here as a further limitation of employer liability for emotional injuries. Finally, in 1991 the Legislature raised the standard of causation once more by replacing the requirement that the event be a \u201csignificant\u201d contributing cause of the emotional injury with the requirement that it be the \u201cpredominant\u201d contributing cause. <em>Id. </em>at 117.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b457-5\">Further, it appears improbable that the Legislature would purposefully prohibit compensation for such serious and formal events as transfer, promotion, demotion, and termination, but then allow compensation for the preliminary and tentative events of investigation and fact finding about the employment relationship or performance. A formal change of employment status is far more likely to cause emotional or mental health consequences than supervision, criticism, and investigation. Those preliminary activities may cause concern for an employee, but they do not inflict the impact of a final job action. If the Legislature intended to bar coverage for emotional injury caused by status-altering action, it most logically intended to bar coverage for emotional injury caused by the preliminary and less serious processes of supervision, criticism, and investigation.</p>\n<p id=\"b457-6\">Finally, the extension of the exception to such preliminary process respects the legitimate efforts of the employer to regulate competence and integrity at the workplace without risk of workers\u2019 compensation liability for emotional consequences of good faith supervision. For sound reasons an employer may justifiably inquire into complaints or suspect behavior. The sheriff maintains a published set of standards and procedures governing departmental investigations of incidents and personnel. A parallel set of standards and procedures constitutes an article of the collective bargaining agreement between the sheriff\u2019s department and Upton\u2019s union. Obviously both the employer and the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"418\">*418</page-number>employee recognized and regulated such investigations as an inherent element of their relationship. Fairly conducted inquiries furnish the employee the opportunity to refute suspicion or criticism and the employer the information necessary for accurate personnel decisions. The Legislature did not plausibly intend to expose those processes to workers\u2019 compensation liability for the purely emotional consequences experienced by affected employees.</p>\n<p id=\"b458-5\">3. <em>Agency interpretation. </em>Although we accord substantial deference to an agency\u2019s interpretation of a statute which it must administer, see, e.g., <em>Bisazza\u2019s Case, </em>452 Mass. 593, 597 (2008), \u201cultimately the \u2018duty of statutory interpretation is for the courts.\u2019 \u201d <em>Higgins\u2019s Case, </em>460 Mass. 50, 53 (2011), quoting from <em>Moss\u2019s Case, </em>451 Mass. 704, 709 (2008). <em>Spaniol\u2019s Case, </em>466 Mass. 102, 106 (2013). The policy of judicial deference is not a practice of judicial abdication, see <em>Finkelstein </em>v. <em>Board of Registration in Optometry, </em>370 Mass. 476, 478 (1976), and we may reverse a decision of the board if it is not in accordance with the law. G. L. c. 30A, \u00a7 14(7)(c). The degree of deference depends on several factors, including (1) the agency\u2019s participation, if any, in the drafting of the act; (2) the duration of the agency\u2019s position, especially if it arose contemporaneously with the enactment; and (3) the consistency over time of the agency view. <em>Board of Educ. </em>v. <em>Assessor of Worcester, </em>368 Mass, at 515-516, and cases cited.</p>\n<p id=\"b458-6\">The present record furnishes no information about the department\u2019s participation in the enactment of the personnel action exception. The board\u2019s current interpretation of the exception did not arise contemporaneously with the enactment. The board has not held it previously or consistently. Before enactment, it had concluded that an employee was not entitled to compensation for emotional injury caused by notice of her impending transfer to another department. See <em>Kelly\u2019s Case, </em>394 Mass, at 685.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> After enactment, the board viewed a personnel action as activity additional to transfer, promotion, demotion, and termination; it could consist of such lesser activity as good faith <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"419\">*419</page-number>supervisory criticism. See <em>Beaudry </em>v. <em>Stop &amp; </em>Shop, 4 Mass. Workers\u2019 Comp. Rep. 239, 241 (1990) (\u201c [Whatever the legislative intent, [the exception] clearly reaches beyond the four events set out as illustrations of bona fide personnel actions\u201d). We do not find any prior case in which a majority of board members have adopted the current position.</p>\n<p id=\"b459-5\">In sum, the usual factors supporting deference for an agency interpretation are absent. Rather, the board\u2019s view in this instance appears to contradict the Legislature\u2019s visible and progressive restriction of workers\u2019 compensation for purely emotional injury in general and emotional injury attributed to good faith personnel actions in particular.</p>\n<p id=\"b459-6\"><em>Conclusion. </em>We therefore reverse the decision of the board and remand the case to the department for entry of an order denying the employee\u2019s claim for benefits by reason of any disability resulting from the interview on November 25, 2008.</p>\n<p id=\"b459-7\">\n<em>So ordered.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b453-7\"> Although the Supreme Judicial Court found that the arbitrator\u2019s findings on Upton\u2019s participation in the violations were not sufficiently clear, it concluded that the death of the arbitrator and the unavailability of several key witnesses made a remand impractical. <em>Sheriff of Suffolk County I, supra </em>at 702-703 &amp; n.3. The court therefore affirmed the Superior Court judgment confirming the arbitrator\u2019s award. <em>Ibid.</em></p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b453-8\">In the 2013 decision, the Supreme Judicial Court addressed the question whether Upton had a duty to mitigate damages during his separation from employment. It concluded that he did bear such a duty but that the sheriff had waived the issue by failure to raise it earlier in the administrative proceedings. <em>Sheriff of Suffolk County II, supra </em>at 585, 588-592.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b454-8\">The administrative judge adopted the impartial physician\u2019s opinion that the interview was the predominant contributing cause of Upton\u2019s emotional disability. He found also that the action was bona fide. The reviewing board accepted both of these findings, as do we.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b457-7\">In the course of its decision, the board acknowledged the legislative trend, but then omitted it from its interpretation of the personnel action exemption. It reasoned instead that the original \u201cbeneficent design\u201d of statutory coverage remained in force, with citation to <em>Young </em>v. <em>Duncan, </em>218 Mass. 346, 349 (1914). <em>Ibid. </em>It is unlikely that far earlier and general case law would override the later and specific statutory amendments recounted and interpreted by <em>Cornetta\u2019s Case, supra </em>at 112-118.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b458-7\">The subsequent reversal of the board\u2019s position by the Supreme Judicial Court, <em>Kelly\u2019s Case, supra </em>at 687-689, caused the Legislature to insert the personnel action exception.
