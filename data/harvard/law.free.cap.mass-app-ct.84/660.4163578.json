That morning, shortly after midnight, McGuire went to an area known for drug dealing, a parking lot of a local Dunkin\u2019 Donuts, to purchase \u201ccrack\u201d cocaine. Eventually, he met with Lance Savage, a drug middleman, and asked if Savage could secure one hundred dollars\u2019 worth of crack cocaine.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Savage called the defendant, who agreed to meet at a convenience store in Worcester. A short time later, the defendant and his girlfriend met Savage and McGuire at the prearranged destination and entered McGuire\u2019s car. Savage told the defendant that McGuire wanted \u201csix for a hundred,\u201d or six twenty-dollar \u201crocks\u201d of crack cocaine for one hundred dollars, but McGuire first wanted to \u201ctaste it.\u201d McGuire then drove the car to a secluded location and sampled the drug.</p>\n<p id=\"b701-6\">Satisfied with the \u201chit,\u201d McGuire said, \u201cLet me get the rest . . . .\u201d The defendant handed over the remaining rocks. Suddenly, McGuire pulled a gun from his left side and shouted for the occupants to \u201c[g]et the fuck out the |&gt;zc] car.\u201d The defendant and his girlfriend jumped out. Savage stayed in and a struggle ensued. The defendant shouted to Savage: \u201cGet him, ... get him. Pull him out the [szc] car.\u201d Soon both combatants were out of the car and still fighting despite McGuire\u2019s attempt to flee.</p>\n<p id=\"b701-7\">The defendant entered the fray. At one point, Savage, who was holding McGuire upright, heard the defendant say, \u201cGive me my drugs back, or I\u2019ll stab you,\u201d and he saw the defendant, who was positioned between McGuire\u2019s legs, extend his right arm toward McGuire. When McGuire said, \u201c[0]kay,\u201d Savage released him. Savage then jumped in the car and tried to get away, but the car would not start. As Savage got out of the car, he noticed the drugs on the driver\u2019s side seat and grabbed them. The defendant shouted at Savage, \u201cGive me that rock, or I\u2019ll <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"662\">*662</page-number>stab you.\u201d Savage handed over the drugs, and the defendant, along with his girlfriend, ran from the scene.</p>\n<p id=\"b702-5\">McGuire went to the driver\u2019s side of the car, bumped into Savage, got into the car, and uttered, \u201cI\u2019m dying, I\u2019m dying.\u201d Savage looked down and saw a pool of blood at his feet. Startled, he turned and ran in the same direction as the defendant. From a distance, he saw the defendant and his girlfriend turn into, but not enter, a brown rooming house. After unsuccessfully trying to enter the building, Savage went to an apartment of an acquaintance, but soon left to use a pay telephone from which he called the defendant. The two spoke briefly. Savage eventually returned to the acquaintance\u2019s apartment and picked up a coat, and then he went to Dunkin\u2019 Donuts and purchased some drugs for himself.</p>\n<p id=\"b702-6\">When he was walking away from Dunkin\u2019 Donuts, Savage saw another acquaintance and jumped into her car. As the car drove away, Officer Joseph Essex of the Worcester police department, who had been patrolling the area, stopped the car. Officer Essex testified that the \u201carea itself is a high crime area, known for drugs and prostitution,\u201d and that he saw the car pull over and Savage get into the back seat, a behavior similar to that of middlemen who \u201ctake the people who are driving up and down the street to get drugs.\u201d Essex approached the driver and asked her what she was doing. The driver told him that she was taking her friends (Savage and another man in the car) home. The driver, however, was unable to name either man. Officer Essex then asked the men to step out and he performed a patfrisk, a brief pat-down of the outer clothing, to check for weapons and to ensure officer safety. The officer, thinking it was. odd that Savage wore a bulky winter jacket in mild weather, unzipped the jacket. The officer saw blood on Savage\u2019s shirt and asked him what it was. Savage said that he had cut his hands earlier. Although there were no cuts on Savage\u2019s hands, Officer Essex did not ask any further questions and let the three go after checking for, and not finding, any outstanding warrants. About two hours later, Officer Essex was called to assist at the McGuire crime scene.</p>\n<p id=\"b702-7\">After securing the perimeter of that scene, Essex spoke with Sergeant Gary Quitadamo of the Worcester police department about the stop that Essex had made earlier involving Savage. Sergeant Quitadamo advised Essex to make a report of the stop <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"663\">*663</page-number>and directed a detective to be on the lookout for Savage. Not long after, Savage was arrested. During questioning by the police, Savage identified the defendant from a photograph.</p>\n<p id=\"b703-5\">Worcester police Officer Michael Foley was assigned to look for the defendant. While patrolling transportation hubs, Foley spotted an \u201cNYC Express\u201d van and approached the vehicle. When questioning the driver, Foley saw a man who resembled the defendant in the van. Foley returned to his cruiser to get a photograph to verify the identification; as he was doing so, the van was driven away. After confirming the identification, Foley followed the van, pulled it over, and arrested the defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b703-6\"><em>Jury empanelment. </em>During the second day of jury empanelment, the Commonwealth exercised a peremptory challenge against juror no. 68, a Hispanic male.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Counsel for the defendant questioned the challenge. He noted that juror no. 68 was one of two Hispanics in the remaining jury pool and there were no Hispanics on the jury. The judge responded, \u201cI think at this point, I think there\u2019s enough of a basis to ask for a neutral reason as to what was the basis for [the challenge].\u201d After the following exchange took place, the judge allowed the challenge to stand and excused the juror.</p>\n<p id=\"b703-7\">First prosecutor: \u201c[The juror] explained that his father works at the federal courthouse. My concern is that there could be some talk to dad, what\u2019s the real story with this, people who are in custody, people who aren\u2019t in custody \u2014 any sort of \u2018inside baseball.\u2019 I was concerned that just because he\u2019s going to probably tell his dad \u2018I\u2019m on a jury,\u2019 they might start chitchatting about it. So, I felt like I didn\u2019t want him on the jury, anyway; and he was part of the court system, really.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b703-8\">The court: \u201cWell, he said his father works as the janitor in the federal courthouse here in Worcester.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b703-9\">Defense counsel: \u201cThere\u2019s no issues of federalism in this case, judge.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b703-10\">Second prosecutor: \u201cBut courthouse procedures, and \u2014\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b704-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"664\">*664</page-number>First prosecutor: \u201cExactly \u2014 people coming in from custody, out of custody, court officers, all of that.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b704-5\">The court: \u201cI don\u2019t know; that doesn\u2019t cut it with me, commonwealth. I mean, there are all kinds of people that work in the court system. It would be one thing if his father was working as a clerk in the federal court, and they had discussions on a regular basis about how the court system works, but the fact that this man is a janitor in a court \u2022\u2014 he doesn\u2019t know anything more than anybody else, necessarily, about how this court works, particularly if it\u2019s federal. I don\u2019t find that as a legitimate reason for excusing him.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b704-6\">First prosecutor: \u201cNo; it has nothing to do with whether it\u2019s federal or state. It\u2019s just kind of the inside dealings of a courthouse, that there will be people who are in custody who will be coming into the courtroom, out of the courtroom \u2014 all of that. I\u2019m just concerned that if he goes home and chitchats about it, that there might be more speculation than anything else.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b704-7\">Defense counsel: \u201cWell, there\u2019s going to be an instruction not to discuss the case with anyone.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b704-8\">The court: \u201cI just don\u2019t find that explanation to be genuine. That doesn\u2019t exclude him. I can\u2019t say one way or the other as to whether or not he is being excluded because of his affiliation to being Hispanic, but I find the basis of the peremptory as being somewhat tortured, to say the least.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b704-9\">First prosecutor: \u201cThat\u2019s my notation: \u2018Dad at federal courthouse.\u2019 \u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b704-10\">The court: \u201cWell, I\u2019ll make a finding that is clear and reasonably specific that it is personal to that juror, and it\u2019s not necessarily based on the juror\u2019s affiliation. As to whether or not it\u2019s genuine, I have some \u2014 while I have some reservations about it, because I don\u2019t feel that it\u2019s a pretext because of his group affiliation, I\u2019m not going to strike the challenge, and I\u2019ll allow the challenge to stand. The commonwealth is on notice about it. Your objection is noted.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b705-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"665\">*665</page-number><em>Peremptory challenges. </em>The principles surrounding peremptory challenges are well known, see <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Douglas, </em>75 Mass. App. Ct. 643, 648-650 (2009), but difficult to implement, see <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Rodriguez, </em>457 Mass. 461, 488 (2010) (Rodriguez) (Marshall, C.J., concurring) (noting \u201cthe impossible task of scrutinizing peremptory challenges for improper motives\u201d), overruled on another ground by <em>Marshall </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>463 Mass. 529, 535 (2012). See Agnes, Peremptory Challenges in Massachusetts: Guidelines to Enable the Bench and the Bar to Comply with Constitutional Requirements, 94 Mass. L. Rev. 81 (Aug. 2012).</p>\n<p id=\"b705-5\">In a nutshell, \u201c[t]here is no dispute that Hispanic persons are members of a racial or ethnic group protected under art. 1 of the [Massachusetts] Declaration of Rights . . . and under the equal protection clause of the Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution.\u201d <em>Rodriguez, supra </em>at 467 n.15 (majority opinion) (citations, omitted). A peremptory challenge to exclude a juror because of his membership in a discrete group is prohibited. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Benoit, </em>452 Mass. 212, 217-218 (2008) <em>{Benoit), </em>citing <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Soares, </em>377 Mass. 461, 486-488, cert, denied, 444 U.S. 881 (1979), and <em>Batson </em>v. <em>Kentucky, </em>476 U.S. 79, 84-88 (1986).</p>\n<p id=\"b705-6\">While a peremptory challenge is presumed proper, it may be rebutted by a showing of (1) a pattern of excluding members of a discrete group; and (2) a likelihood that the exclusion occurred solely because of their membership in that group. <em>Benoit, supra </em>at 218. A pattern, however, is not required when \u201conly one or two members of a discrete group have been challenged and the venire contains only a few members of the group.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Garrey, </em>436 Mass. 422, 429 (2002). \u201cOnce an issue is raised concerning an improper use of a peremptory challenge, \u2018the judge must make a finding as to whether a prima facie showing of an improper use . . . has been made.\u2019 \u201d <em>Rodriguez, supra </em>at 471, quoting from <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Maldonado, </em>439 Mass. 460, 463 (2003) <em>{Maldonado). </em>When such a showing is made, the \u201cburden shifts to the Commonwealth to \u2018provide a group-neutral reason for [the challenge].\u2019 \u201d <em>Benoit, supra </em>at 219, quoting from <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Burnett, </em>418 Mass. 769, 771 (1994) <em>{Burnett).</em></p>\n<p id=\"b706-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"666\">*666</page-number>At that point, the prosecutor must provide \u201ca clear and reasonably specific explanation of his legitimate reasons for exercising the challenges.\u201d <em>Benoit, supra </em>(quotations and citation omitted). The judge is then \u201crequired to make an independent evaluation of the prosecutor\u2019s reasons and to determine specifically whether the explanation was bona fide or a pretext.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Calderon, </em>431 Mass. 21, 26 (2000). See <em>Maldonado, supra </em>at 464. An explanation will be found bona fide if it is both adequate and genuine. <em>Ibid.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b706-5\">\u201cAn explanation is <em>adequate </em>if it is \u2018clear and reasonably specific,\u2019 [and] \u2018personal to the juror and not based on the juror\u2019s group affiliation ....\u2019\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 464-465, quoting from <em>Burnett, supra. </em>\u201cChallenges based on subjective data such as ... a party\u2019s \u2018gut\u2019 feeling should rarely be accepted as adequate because such explanations can easily be used as pretexts for discrimination.\u201d <em>Maldonado, supra </em>at 465. \u201cAn explanation is <em>genuine </em>if it is in fact the reason for the exercise of the challenge. The mere denial of an improper motive is inadequate to establish the genuineness of the explanation.\u201d <em>Ibid. </em>The explanation must \u201creflect[] the challenging party\u2019s actual thinking.\u201d <em>Ibid.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b706-6\">The ultimate ruling on the challenge will be reviewed with \u201csubstantial deference to the [judge\u2019s] decision.\u201d <em>Burnett, supra. </em>However, the record must reflect \u201cconsideration of] both the adequacy and the genuineness of the proffered explanation.\u201d <em>Maldonado, supra. </em>\u201cThe appellate court must ... be able to ascertain that the consideration . . . was itself adequate and proper.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 466. Furthermore, the record must \u201cexplicitly contain the judge\u2019s separate findings as to both adequacy and genuineness and, if necessary, an explanation of those findings.\u201d <em>Ibid.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b706-7\">Here, the judge, to her credit, followed the required procedures when counsel sought an explanation for the challenge. After defense counsel noted that juror no. 68 was one of two Hispanics in the remaining jury pool and that there were no Hispanics on the jury, the judge, implicitly finding a prima facie showing of impropriety, asked the Commonwealth to provide a race-neutral reason for the challenge. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Van Winkle, </em>443 Mass. 230, 236 (2005) (\u201cWhere a venire contains a paucity of [a protected class,] a judge has broad discretion to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"667\">*667</page-number>require an explanation without having to make the determination that a pattern of improper exclusion exists\u201d [quotations and citation omitted]). See also <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Scott, </em>463 Mass. 561, 570-571 (2012) (\u201c[B]y requiring a prosecutor to provide an explanation for making a peremptory challenge, a judge may have implicitly found that a defendant has made a prima facie showing that challenge was improper\u201d). The prosecutor explained that she was concerned the juror might talk about the case with his father, a Federal court house janitor.</p>\n<p id=\"b707-5\">The Commonwealth claims that the judge\u2019s subsequent \u201cstatements clearly reflect her conclusion that the reason given was both adequate and genuine.\u201d We disagree. While the judge\u2019s statements that the reason was clear, specific, and personal to the juror indicate that she found the reason adequate, her statements do not indicate that she found the reason genuine. In fact, the judge expressly stated that she did not find the reason genuine. The Commonwealth suggests that the judge\u2019s ultimate finding that the challenge was not a pretext, in effect, was a finding that the proffered reason was genuine. This suggestion conflicts with the judge\u2019s statements and conflates the analysis. Cf. <em>Maldonado, </em>439 Mass, at 465-466. Further, given the apparent conflict between the judge\u2019s subsidiary finding that the reason was not genuine and her ultimate finding that the challenge was not a pretext for discrimination, an explanation was necessary. See <em>Benoit, </em>452 Mass, at 222 (findings should not simply state conclusions). Without such an explanation, we are left with a record reflecting a generally unacceptable basis for exclusion. See <em>Maldonado, supra </em>at 466.</p>\n<p id=\"b707-6\">We agree with the judge\u2019s original thoughts and concerns, adding that we are at a loss to understand how the juror\u2019s father, due to his employment as a janitor in a Federal court house, would be of any legitimate concern to the Commonwealth, especially since the juror would be instructed, as ably noted by defense counsel, not to discuss the case with anyone.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Lynch, </em>439 Mass. 532, 544, cert. denied, 540 U.S. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"668\">*668</page-number>1049 (2003) (jurors are presumed to follow the directions of the judge).</p>\n<p id=\"b708-5\"><em>Remaining issues. </em>We need not dwell on the defendant\u2019s remaining issues. Briefly, because there was some evidence from which the jury could have concluded that at least two persons were involved in the crime, the judge did not err in giving a joint venture jury instruction as outlined in <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Zanetti, </em>454 Mass. 449, 470 (2009) (Appendix). Nor did the judge err in dechning to give an intoxication instruction given the defendant\u2019s lack of a \u201cdebilitating\u201d condition. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Lennon, </em>463 Mass. 520, 523 (2012).<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b708-6\"><em>Conclusion. </em>\u201c[T]he defendant has an unquestionable right to be tried before a jury that has been selected in a manner that is free from discrimination, and this right was not adequately protected in the present case.\u201d <em>Benoit, supra </em>at 226. We recognize that in this day and age, with attorneys being sensitized to the issue at hand, that the vast majority of prosecutors act aboveboard and harbor no racial bias. However, even the appearance of such impropriety is problematic, given the important role that race and ethnicity play in the assessment of the jury selection process. See <em>id. </em>at 225.</p>\n<p id=\"b708-7\">\n<em>Judgments reversed.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"Ad7\">\n<em>Verdicts set aside.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b700-15\">The defendant also was charged with two counts of assault and battery by means of a dangerous weapon. The judge allowed the defendant\u2019s motion for a required finding of not guilty on one count (shod foot), and the jury convicted him on the other count (knife).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b700-16\">Specifically, the defendant argues that the judge should not have instructed the jurors on joint venture, but she should have instructed them on intoxication and reinstructed them on malice.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b701-8\">Savage testified at trial as a witness for the Commonwealth. In exchange, he agreed to plead guilty to a reduced charge of manslaughter with a sentence of time served. In addition, he agreed to plead guilty to two charges of assault and battery by means of a dangerous weapon, for which he would be placed on probation, a condition of which was undergoing drug evaluation and treatment.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b703-11\">The defendant also is Hispanic.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b707-7\">Indeed, the judge did just that, telling the jury: \u201cDon\u2019t talk about this case or any aspect of this case with anyone \u2014 your spouses, your family, your friends, your neighbors, your children, acquaintances, employers, employees, enemies, strangers, anybody out there, or even amongst yourselves. . . . All <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"668\">*668</page-number>right; and again, don\u2019t let anybody else tell you what they may have found, or seen, or heard.\u201d On the first day of trial, the judge again instructed the jury, stating: \u201cPlease do not talk to anyone . . . about any aspect of this case during the trial. . . .\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b708-9\">Given the posture of the proceedings, the judge\u2019s observations of the defendant, and the lack of a request by trial counsel, there was no need to order, sua sponte, a competency evaluation. Finally, the judge properly responded to a jury question and was not required to reinstruct on malice. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Stokes, </em>440 Mass. 741, 750 (2004).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
