L. c. 265, \u00a7 1), armed robbery (G. L. c. 265, \u00a7 17), and carrying a dangerous weapon (G. L. c. 269, \u00a7 10), arising from the shooting of Luis Rodriguez at a party in Haverhill. After an evidentiary hearing, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"259\">*259</page-number>a judge of the Superior Court allowed, in part, the defendant\u2019s motion to suppress statements made during an interview with police. Having obtained leave from a single justice of the Supreme Judicial Court, the Commonwealth brings this interlocutory appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b299-5\">Like the motion judge, we conclude that the nineteen year old defendant\u2019s will was overborne by improper police interrogation tactics. Those tactics included misrepresenting statements given by witnesses; informing the defendant that the interview was his \u201clast chance\u201d to tell his story; and assuring the defendant, who had been steadfast in denying that he had given the suspected shooter a gun, that he would not be culpable if the defendant had given the shooter the gun for a purpose other than to rob or kill the victim, and the shooter had acted like a \u201ccowboy.\u201d However, unlike the motion judge, we further conclude that suppression is required of all statements made once the defendant\u2019s will was overborne, and not merely selective statements pertaining to the gun.</p>\n<p id=\"b299-6\">1. <em>Standard of review. </em>The evidence before the motion judge consisted of the testimony of State Trooper Steven O\u2019Connor at the motion hearing, the video recording of the defendant\u2019s interview and a transcript thereof, and transcripts of the interviews of several witnesses who met with the police prior to their meeting with the defendant. All of these items have been transmitted to us. Accordingly, to the extent the judge\u2019s decision rests on the testimony at the motion hearing, we determine whether his subsidiary findings were warranted by the evidence, and, if so, accept them; but to the extent the decision is based on the recording and the transcripts submitted in evidence, we independently make judgments with respect to their contents without deference to the judge\u2019s findings. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Novo, </em>442 Mass. 262, 266 (2004).</p>\n<p id=\"b299-7\">2. <em>Background. </em>On Friday, April 16, 2010, Gena Quintana hosted a party at her Haverhill apartment, which was attended by three other women (Stephanie Michaud, Cassie Fournier, and Susan Sullivan) and four men (the defendant, Patrick \u201cButter\u201d Warren, Everett \u201cChey\u201d Leonard,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> and the victim, Luis <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"260\">*260</page-number>Rodriguez). The party continued into early Saturday morning, when, as the guests began to disperse, gun shots were heard. It later was determined that Rodriguez had been shot in the hallway outside Quintana\u2019s apartment; he died at the hospital later that day.</p>\n<p id=\"b300-5\">Upon learning of the shooting, the State police and the Haverhill police began an investigation, which included interviewing those present at the party. At some point during the weekend, Trooper O\u2019Connor left a telephone message for the defendant requesting an interview. The message included the comment that O\u2019Connor \u201cknew\u201d that the defendant was not the shooter. The defendant, urged by his ex-girlfriend\u2019s mother to get this \u201csquared away,\u201d ingested marijuana by smoking \u201chalf a blunt,\u201d and proceeded by himself to the police station in the late afternoon of Monday, April 19, 2010.</p>\n<p id=\"b300-6\">By the time the defendant was interrogated, the police already had conducted multiple interviews of the four female witnesses, and had interviewed Warren once. One witness, Michaud, eventually implicated the defendant and Leonard during her third interview with the police. She told the detectives that Rodriguez, who had just cashed his paycheck, asked for change for two fifty dollar bills while playing cards at the party. She later saw the defendant hand Leonard a gun in the bedroom of Quintana\u2019s apartment, at which point Leonard walked out into the hallway where Rodriguez and Warren were smoking. According to Michaud, when Sullivan, who was Leonard\u2019s girlfriend, entered the bedroom to say good bye, the defendant told her to stay there; his telephone rang, he walked from the bedroom into the living room, and then walked out the door into the hallway. Some minutes later, Michaud, who remained inside the apartment, heard shots and then saw Rodriguez stumble into the apartment. Michaud first estimated the interval between the defendant\u2019s departure and the shots as \u201cthree to four minutes,\u201d and later said, \u201cprobably like two minutes if that.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b301-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"261\">*261</page-number>3. <em>The interview. </em>The interview with the defendant, which was recorded with the defendant\u2019s consent, started at approximately 4:39 p.m. and ended at approximately 7:29 p.m. There was no break, and the defendant was not offered (and did not request) water or the opportunity to use the bathroom.</p>\n<p id=\"b301-5\">In addition to O\u2019Connor, Detective Glenn Fogarty of the Haverhill police department interrogated the defendant. Lieutenant Norman Zuk also was present for a time.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> O\u2019Connor took the lead, and, at times, Fogarty was actively involved; Zuk\u2019s participation was very limited.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> The defendant and the detectives were seated around a small table. Fogarty sat directly across from the defendant, and O\u2019Connor was seated to the defendant\u2019s left. Both officers were roughly two to four feet from the defendant, and both were in plain clothes. The defendant was unrestrained until he was arrested at the conclusion of the interview.</p>\n<p id=\"b301-6\">O\u2019Connor administered Miranda warnings,<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> and the defendant affirmed his understanding and willingness to speak with the police. The defendant was nineteen years of age. Although he had some prior involvement with law enforcement, there was no evidence that he previously had received Miranda warnings. He had no trouble speaking or understanding English, and did not appear to be suffering from any physical or mental illness or impairment. He was not asked and did not disclose the extent of his education.</p>\n<p id=\"b301-7\">About thirty minutes into the interview, the defendant told the detectives that he had gotten \u201chigh\u201d on marijuana before coming to the police station but that he had sobered up once he got there. O\u2019Connor testified at the motion hearing that the defendant displayed no adverse effects from the use of marijuana, and the motion judge credited this testimony.</p>\n<p id=\"b302-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"262\">*262</page-number>The manner of interrogation ranged from conversational and reassuring to aggressive and confrontational. After introductory matters, the defendant was asked to recount what he knew about the shooting. He explained that he had been speaking to Michaud in the bedroom when he decided to leave the party. He made his way to the apartment door, opened it, and shut it behind him, and immediately gunfire went off; for his safety, he ran down the stairs to where his friend Warren already was standing, and the two of them both ran out. A short time later, he went back upstairs to make sure that Quintana was all right and left when she told him she was fine. Later, Quintana called him at home to say that Rodriguez was throwing up all over her back stairs. The defendant went back to her house and spoke with Rodriguez, who was lying on the floor at the foot of the back stairs. Rodriguez was vomiting but said that he was \u201cgood,\u201d and that he was \u201cjust fucked up\u201d (had too much to drink). The defendant and Quintana went back upstairs where she called Rodriguez\u2019s \u201cboy\u201d to come and get him. The defendant left and learned only later that Rodriguez had been shot and ultimately died.</p>\n<p id=\"b302-4\">O\u2019Connor showed the defendant Leonard\u2019s photograph, and the defendant denied knowing him. O\u2019Connor then asked a series of questions concerning whether the defendant had given Leonard a gun at the party, to which the defendant responded that he didn\u2019t have a gun, and, if someone at the party said the defendant gave Leonard a gun, that person would be lying. At this point (approximately twenty-five minutes into the interview), the detectives played a portion of the recording of Michaud\u2019s third interview where she recounted seeing the defendant hand Leonard a gun in the bedroom. The defendant, whose demeanor was calm and self-assured to this point, began to sweat noticeably and repeatedly pulled up his shirt to mop his face. When later asked about his perspiration, the defendant stated that he felt nervous because the witness was lying about him.</p>\n<p id=\"b302-5\">O\u2019Connor then posited an alternative account of the night: Rodriguez had flashed money at the party, Leonard wanted to \u201croll\u201d him, the defendant gave Leonard a gun, Leonard went outside to rob Rodriguez, the defendant went outside with them, things got out of hand, Leonard \u201cscrew[ed] up\u201d and fired shots, and the defendant took off having had no intention of anybody <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"263\">*263</page-number>getting hurt. In response, the defendant vehemently denied discussing any robbery or giving Leonard a gun, and said that Michaud was lying.</p>\n<p id=\"b303-5\">As the interview continued, the officers aggressively challenged the defendant\u2019s account that he emerged from the apartment just as the shots were fired. O\u2019Connor repeatedly (and falsely) represented to the defendant that, in their interviews, all four women had said that he was out in the hallway for about three minutes before the shots were fired, and both O\u2019Connor and Fogarty falsely claimed that Warren, too, had placed the defendant in the hallway with Leonard and Rodriguez for a few minutes. The defendant appeared angered by these representations. At one point, he accused the officers of \u201cswitching shit up, like I\u2019m stupid or something, and I\u2019m not stupid, okay?\u201d When the officers played portions of the interviews of Quintana and Warren, and the recordings did not directly support what the officers had represented, the defendant again emphatically maintained that the shots rang out as soon as he closed the apartment door.</p>\n<p id=\"b303-6\">Approximately an hour into the interview, the officers introduced a new theme \u2014 that this was the defendant\u2019s \u201clast chance\u201d to \u201cdistance himself\u201d from the crime by admitting that he was present when Rodriguez was confronted in the hallway. The officers explained that they were not saying that the defendant was the shooter, but that he needed to take this opportunity to explain that he was simply in \u201cthe wrong place at the wrong time.\u201d Among other things, Zuk stated, \u201cThe District Attorney is going to see this. The Judge is going to see this, and ultimately the jury is going to see this, and when they hear you spinning this tale, you\u2019re not helping yourself. So, tell the story of what happened out there. If you didn\u2019t pull the trigger, now\u2019s the chance for you to tell your story.\u201d When the defendant replied, \u201cI didn\u2019t,\u201d Zuk continued, \u201cSo, I suggest you tell your story now, because everyone else already told it for you. So you can paint yourself in the best picture you can here, right now, and this is your last chance.\u201d In the same vein, O\u2019Connor insisted that the defendant \u201csaw what happened,\u201d and had to tell them in his own words \u201cbecause down the road, everyone else is going to put a picture in. It\u2019s not going to look good for you. This <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"264\">*264</page-number>is your chance to say, \u2018Look, this is what happened. This is how I felt. I didn\u2019t want it to happen.\u2019 \u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b304-5\">At this point, the defendant appeared less self-assured and began to waver in his account. He explained that it \u201cfelt like\u201d only two seconds that he was out in the hallway, conceded that he knew Leonard, and eventually admitted that he saw Rodriguez and Leonard fighting before the shots were fired; but he continued to insist that he was not the shooter, and was not involved in any robbery scheme.</p>\n<p id=\"b304-6\">Approximately one hour and forty minutes into the interview, the detectives turned again to the subject of the defendant handing Leonard a gun in the bedroom. They repeatedly suggested that even if the defendant had given Leonard the gun, the defendant would not be culpable if he was not the shooter, and Leonard had acted rashly. Fogarty introduced this theme, saying: \u201cIf you give [Leonard] a gun, and he goes out and acts like a cowboy, goes out and somebody gets killed, that\u2019s not your fault, is it?\u201d When the defendant denied giving Leonard a gun, Fogarty added: \u201cIf you give [Leonard] a gun, he goes out and acts like a cowboy and kills somebody. That\u2019s not your fault. You didn\u2019t pull the trigger, right? . . . I\u2019m asking hypothetically. If you give [Leonard] a gun, and he goes and does something stupid with it, that\u2019s not your fault. You didn\u2019t go and kill that guy, right?\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b304-7\">When the defendant persisted in denying that he gave Leonard a gun, Fogarty continued: \u201cNo. This was hypothetical, OK? If you gave [Leonard] a gun, and [Leonard] does something stupid, OK, that\u2019s not your fault that [Leonard] did something stupid, right? Just because somebody died, if you gave [Leonard] a gun that he killed somebody with, it doesn\u2019t mean that it\u2019s your fault, right?\u201d The defendant then tried to clarify and confirm what was being said to him. He posed a scenario where O\u2019Connor gave the defendant a gun, and the defendant \u201cgo[es] acting like a cowboy.\u201d \u201cIs that your fault?\u201d asked the defendant, to which O\u2019Connor responded, \u201cIf you shoot \u2014 no.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b304-8\">O\u2019Connor emphasized that they could prove the defendant gave Leonard the gun, but \u201cwhat we do know is that you had no intention that he was going to use it to kill somebody, just to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"265\">*265</page-number>scare someone. . . . We know that, and that\u2019s [why] we\u2019re trying to get you out of this jam so that no one thinks that you gave him a gun and said, \u2018Hey man, go kill him and get his money.\u2019 You gave him a gun and said, \u2018Go scare him and get his money.\u2019 \u201d O\u2019Connor then added (falsely) that Michaud\u2019s statement that the defendant had given Leonard a gun was made under oath, at which point the defendant repeated, \u201cUnder oath.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b305-4\">O\u2019Connor and Fogarty continued to stress that there was a distinction between handing over the gun with the intention that Leonard would use it to kill Rodriguez and handing it over with the intention that Leonard would use it only to scare and rob him. O\u2019Connor said, \u201cRight now, and for the judge or jury, it\u2019s whether you gave it to him to scare him or kill him.\u201d He went on, \u201cThere\u2019s no other question .... It happened. You cannot change that. It happened. But why did it happen? Did you want [Leonard] to kill him or just to scare him? That\u2019s where we want to go tonight. That\u2019s it. Kill him or scare him? Kill him, you\u2019re in this for a capital murder. Scare him, wrong place, wrong time, the cowboy screwed up. That\u2019s it.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b305-5\">When the defendant responded that he did not want anyone to get robbed or die, O\u2019Connor offered additional alternative explanations for providing the gun: Leonard \u201cneeded it for the next day,\u201d he \u201chad a beef with someone,\u201d he was \u201chaving a problem with this kid down the street \u2014 whatever situation it was, I don\u2019t know. And you said to [Leonard], \u2018Man, take this. Take care of yourself. Here\u2019s the gun, not to rob anybody, not to shoot anybody at the end of the night, but take this gun for protection,\u2019 for whatever he needed it for, OK?\u201d O\u2019Connor continued, \u201cMaybe there was no robbery planned, but you just give it to him for protection, and he gets in a beef.\u201d And then later, \u201cMaybe you didn\u2019t give it to [Leonard] to rob a guy. Maybe you gave it to him for another reason, for protection. And that\u2019s totally different than you give it to him to rob him. That\u2019s totally different. . . . We want to know what the reason was you gave it to him, because it happened. If you didn\u2019t give it to him to rob him, that\u2019s cool. That\u2019s fine. . . . There\u2019s a reason he wanted that gun. ... I don\u2019t know what it was, and if you can tell me the reason that he wanted it for, you\u2019re out of the picture.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b306-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"266\">*266</page-number>As the interview approached the end of its second hour, O\u2019Connor and Fogarty continued to probe insistently why the defendant gave Leonard the gun, and whether it was to rob Rodriguez or for Leonard\u2019s protection. The defendant finally said, \u201cNo. It was not to rob him,\u201d but professed not to know why Leonard needed a gun. O\u2019Connor shouted, \u201cSeparate yourself from the murder. Tell us why you gave it to him. Get away from the murder. Get away from it. It\u2019s easy to get away from it.\u201d The defendant, while also stating that the gun did not belong to him and that he had been holding onto it for Leonard, ultimately admitted that he did hand the gun to Leonard, and that it was \u201cfor protection.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b306-5\">As the detectives pressed for details, the defendant backed away from his admission, at one point hanging his head. O\u2019Connor again said, \u201cIf you gave it to him for protection that\u2019s totally different than you giving him the gun to rob him, but I want to hear this from you. You\u2019ve got to tell us why. You\u2019ve got to tell us why.\u201d The defendant eventually told the detectives unequivocally that he gave Leonard the gun \u201c[fjor protection for a beef that he had.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b306-6\">The remainder of the interview concerned how the gun was handed off to Leonard and whether it belonged to the defendant. The detectives also encouraged the defendant to assist them in finding the weapon, because \u201cyou\u2019re going to be whistling \u2018Dixie\u2019 if we can get [Leonard\u2019s] fingerprints off of this gun.\u201d The officers left the room for a time, during which the defendant was hunched over in his seat and looked exhausted. They returned to ask a few more questions and then placed the defendant under arrest for murder. The defendant reacted with apparent surprise, declaring that the arrest was \u201cbullshit,\u201d he was not the one who shot Rodriguez, and the officers \u201ckn[e]w it.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b306-7\">4. <em>Discussion. </em>The defendant has the initial burden to produce evidence to show that his statements were involuntary. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Tremblay, </em>460 Mass. 199, 206 (2011). Once the defendant produces such evidence (as the defendant did here by means of his motion, affidavit, and proffer), the Commonwealth bears the heavy burden of establishing that the statements were, in fact, voluntary. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Baye, </em>462 Mass. 246, 256 (2012). In meeting that burden, \u201cthe Commonwealth must prove <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"267\">*267</page-number>beyond a reasonable doubt that \u2018in light of the totality of the circumstances surrounding the making of the statements], the will of the defendant was [not] overborne,\u2019 but,\u201d instead, that the statements were \u201cthe result of a free and voluntary act.\u201d <em>Ibid., </em>quoting from <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Durand, </em>457 Mass. 574, 595-596 (2010).</p>\n<p id=\"b307-5\">\u201c[T]he issue of voluntariness turns on \u2018all the surrounding circumstances \u2014 both the characteristics of the accused and the details of the interrogation.\u2019 \u201d <em>Baye, supra, </em>quoting from <em>Dickerson </em>v. <em>United States, </em>530 U.S. 428, 434 (2000). Thus, the use of improper interrogation techniques by the police does not always mandate suppression; \u201c[hjowever, the more problematic the details of the interrogation, the more difficult it will be for the Commonwealth to prove beyond a reasonable doubt that the defendant\u2019s will was nevertheless not overborne.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 256-257. Here, the Commonwealth has failed to meet that burden.</p>\n<p id=\"b307-6\">The defendant was nineteen years old. While he had some prior experience with law enforcement, there is no suggestion that he had been interviewed in this manner previously; there was no evidence, for example, that he ever had received Miranda warnings. Before going to the police station, he smoked marijuana. However, the motion judge found, and we accept, that this \u201cwas insufficient to materially affect the voluntariness of the Miranda waiver or, in and of itself, the voluntariness of the subsequent statements made.\u201d Although not extreme in its length, the nearly three-hour interview, conducted without a break or a glass of water, was taxing and left the defendant visibly exhausted.</p>\n<p id=\"b307-7\">O\u2019Connor and Fogarty undeniably used several interrogation techniques that have been disapproved by our courts. We examine them in the order they were employed, and comment on the defendant\u2019s reactions.</p>\n<p id=\"b307-8\">a. <em>False statements. </em>\u201c[T]he \u2018use of false information by police during an interrogation is deceptive and is a relevant factor indicating a possibility that the defendant\u2019s statements were made involuntarily.\u2019 \u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Novo, </em>442 Mass, at 267, quoting from <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Selby, </em>420 Mass. 656, 664 (1995). While the use of false statements does not automatically render a suspect\u2019s confession involuntary, it is strongly disfavored, particularly when coupled with other impermissible <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"268\">*268</page-number>techniques. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>DiGiambattista, </em>442 Mass. 423, 434-435 (2004).</p>\n<p id=\"b308-5\">From the beginning of the interview, the detectives misrepresented the results of their investigation, contending that all four of the female witnesses and one of the male witnesses (Warren) had squarely placed the defendant in the hallway for a number of minutes before shots were heard. Later, they also informed the defendant, untruthfully, that Michaud had given her statement under oath. It is evident, however, that the defendant was skeptical of the detectives\u2019 accounts of the witness interviews, and we do not think they played a significant role in overbearing his will. On the other hand, the detectives\u2019 claim that Michaud\u2019s interview was under oath, appears to have struck a nerve with the defendant. This claim was made during the period when the detectives were assuring the defendant that, depending on the reason he provided the gun, he could be \u201cout of the picture.\u201d We cannot discount it as a contributing factor in bringing about his eventual admissions.</p>\n<p id=\"b308-6\">b. <em>\u201cLast chance\u201d theme. </em>The detectives\u2019 message that this was the defendant\u2019s \u201clast chance\u201d to tell his story was a plain misstatement of the defendant\u2019s rights to present a defense. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Novo, </em>442 Mass, at 267-270. By adding that the judge would see the interview statement and that the defendant was not \u201chelping [himjself,\u201d Zuk solidified the erroneous impression that what the defendant said at the interview would be dispositive \u2014 or at least overwhelmingly important \u2014 in assessing his culpability in court.</p>\n<p id=\"b308-7\">The \u201clast chance\u201d theme plainly had an impact on the defendant. Compare <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Durand, </em>457 Mass, at 596-597. In direct response to these remarks, he finally admitted that he had been in the hallway long enough to have seen Rodriguez and Leonard fighting before shots were fired. Nevertheless, the defendant retained sufficient composure at this stage of the interview that he was able to remain firm in his assertions that he was not the shooter and was not involved in any robbery scheme. Therefore, while the use of this tactic contributes to the totality of circumstances, we give it relatively little weight. Compare <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Novo, </em>442 Mass, at 267-269.</p>\n<p id=\"b308-8\">c. <em>Assurances. </em>The motion judge\u2019s decision was grounded in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"269\">*269</page-number>the detectives\u2019 use of \u201cthe interrogation technique employing the repetition of the theme that [the defendant] could get himself out of this jam; that he could [sjeparate [him]self from the murder, and that he could by providing a statement of the kind the officers were seeking, \u2018be out of the picture.\u2019 \u201d We agree that this effort, which began in earnest approximately one hour and forty minutes into the interview, carried with it the forbidden \u201cintimation that the defendant would be exonerated.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Meehan, </em>377 Mass. 552, 565 (1979).</p>\n<p id=\"b309-5\">\u201cWhat is prohibited, if a confession is to stand, is an assurance, express or implied, that it will aid the defense or result in a lesser sentence.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 564. Here, in order to extract an admission that the defendant had provided Leonard with a gun, the detectives falsely told him several times that Rodriguez\u2019s death would not be his \u201cfault\u201d if Leonard was the shooter and had acted \u201clike a cowboy\u201d; and when the defendant probed this assurance, O\u2019Connor told him that if, hypothetically, O\u2019Connor gave the defendant a gun, and the defendant acted like a cowboy, it would not be O\u2019Connor\u2019s \u201cfault\u201d if the defendant shot someone.</p>\n<p id=\"b309-6\">The detectives then minimized the defendant\u2019s involvement, stating that they knew the defendant \u201chad no intention that [Leonard] was going to use it to kill somebody\u201d and that is why they were trying to help him foreclose anyone from thinking that he gave Leonard the gun to kill Rodriguez and get his money. They mischaracterized the law of murder, drawing a false dichotomy between giving Leonard the gun \u201cto kill\u201d the victim and giving Leonard the gun \u201cto scare\u201d the victim. This theme reached its height when O\u2019Connor said, \u201cKill him or scare him? Kill him, you\u2019re in this for a <em>capital murder. </em>Scare him, wrong place, wrong time, the cowboy screwed up\u201d (emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b309-7\">These were especially egregious remarks. Knowledgeable persons might know that the death penalty had been abolished in the Commonwealth and that a \u201ccapital crime\u201d refers to a charge of murder in the first degree. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Perkins, </em>464 Mass. 92, 96 n.9 (2013). However, it could well be expected that the defendant would be misled into thinking that he would be exposed to capital punishment if he failed to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"270\">*270</page-number>admit that he gave Leonard the gun only to scare the victim.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> The remarks further suggested that if the defendant did make such an admission, he, as distinct from the \u201ccowboy\u201d who \u201cscrewed up,\u201d would not be culpable at all. At a minimum, the detectives misrepresented the defendant\u2019s exposure to charges of murder in the first degree on the theories of felony-murder or aiding and abetting (joint venture). See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Baye, supra </em>at 250 &amp; n.7.</p>\n<p id=\"b310-5\">The detectives continued in this vein, insisting that the defendant give them some other reason for providing the gun to Leonard. They drew another false distinction \u2014 between giving Leonard the gun \u201cto rob\u201d the victim and giving him the gun \u201cfor protection\u201d \u2014 and they again assured the defendant that if he told them the reason Leonard wanted the gun, the defendant would be \u201cout of the picture.\u201d Unlike his reaction to the detectives\u2019 false statements about the state of the evidence, where he appeared able to identify the tactics for what they were, the defendant was plainly swayed by this line of improper interrogation, and, ultimately, he admitted giving Leonard the gun \u201cfor protection.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b310-6\">5. <em>Extent of suppression. </em>It follows from the foregoing discussion that the motion judge properly ordered suppression of \u201cstatements following the introduction of the theme that the defendant could \u2018separate [himself] from the murder\u2019 or otherwise be less culpable.\u201d After the judge\u2019s ruling, the Commonwealth filed a motion for clarification asking the judge to identify the precise point in the interview at which the defendant\u2019s statement would be suppressed. The judge responded by identifying selective pages and lines to be suppressed,<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> beginning at page 120, line nineteen of the interview transcript, when, after the most coercive of the assurances had been made, the defendant finally began to abandon his firm and consistent position that he had not given Leonard a gun.</p>\n<p id=\"b310-7\">We agree that this is the point at which it fairly may be concluded that the defendant\u2019s will was overborne by the improper <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"271\">*271</page-number>tactics employed by the detectives. However, we conclude that the selective suppression of statements made thereafter is not a proper remedy. Other statements made after the defendant\u2019s will was overborne are no less tainted by the improper police tactics and cannot reasonably be said to be voluntarily made. Accordingly, all subsequent statements made by the defendant must be suppressed. See, e.g., <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Ashley, </em>82 Mass. App. Ct. 748, 756 (2012).</p>\n<p id=\"b311-5\"><em>Conclusion. </em>As modified to suppress all statements made by the defendant from and after line nineteen of page 120 of the interview transcript, the order partially allowing the defendant\u2019s motion to suppress, and the subsequent ruling on the Commonwealth\u2019s motion for clarification, are affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b311-6\">\n<em>So ordered.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b299-8\">Leonard also has been indicted in this matter, but is not a party to this <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"260\">*260</page-number>appeal. His counsel informed the judge at the hearing on the defendant\u2019s motion to suppress that he had not filed a motion to suppress statements made to investigators by Leonard because the Commonwealth had agreed that those statements would not be used at trial.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b301-8\">We refer to Fogarty, Zuk, and O\u2019Connor as officers or detectives.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b301-9\">Review of the video recording reveals that the transcript of the interview does not always correctly identify the officer who is speaking.

However, any mistakes are not material to the issues on appeal.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b301-10\">The motion judge rejected the defendant\u2019s contention below that the validity of his Miranda waiver and the voluntariness of his statements were undermined by misstatements in the warnings as recited by O\u2019Connor. The defendant, who did not seek interlocutory review, does not address the issue in this appeal.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b310-8\">The defendant averred in his affidavit, \u201cI understood capital murder to expose me to the death penalty.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b310-9\">The judge identified thirteen specific passages, some only a sentence or two long. Essentially, the judge suppressed any statements wherein the defendant admitted to the possession of the firearm used in the shooting.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
