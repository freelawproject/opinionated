(True Plastics). We agree with the trial judge\u2019s determination that the particular worker at issue in this case was furnished to meet short-term workload conditions <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"18\">*18</page-number>and, therefore, that she was a \u201ctemporary worker\u201d within the meaning of the policy. A worker is a \u201ctemporary worker\u201d within the meaning of the policy if the insured holds (at the time the worker is furnished) an objectively reasonable expectation that the worker is furnished to meet a short-term workload condition. We reject Central Mutual\u2019s argument that a short-term workload condition must necessarily be of finite duration.</p>\n<p id=\"b58-5\"><em>Background. </em>Marciala Sanchez was injured on October 14, 2004, while operating a molding machine at True Plastics. Sanchez was not an employee of True Plastics; she had been assigned to True Plastics by an employment agency, Dynamic Staffing, Inc.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Because of the accident, Sanchez made a claim for, and received, workers\u2019 compensation benefits under Dynamic Staffing\u2019s workers\u2019 compensation insurance policy. As was her right (and as contemplated under the workers\u2019 compensation scheme, G. L. c. 152, \u00a7 15<footnotemark>3</footnotemark>), she also sued True Plastics to recover for her injuries. True Plastics sought indemnification and a defense from Central Mutual, which brought the underlying action seeking a judgment declaring that it owed no duty under its CGL policy.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b58-6\">In essence, Central Mutual\u2019s position is that Sanchez was a leased employee (excluded under the policy), rather than a temporary employee (included under the policy). The parties submitted the case for decision as a \u201ccase stated\u201d<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> on a documentary record including written stipulations, deposition <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"19\">*19</page-number>transcripts, answers to interrogatories, affidavits, and exhibits. In this posture, our appellate review gives no deference to the trial judge\u2019s findings, and we are free to draw our own conclusions.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> See <em>Ranger Ins. Co. </em>v. <em>Air-Speed, Inc., 9 </em>Mass. App. Ct. 403, 406 n.10 (1980); <em>Guempel </em>v. <em>Great Am. Ins. Co., </em>11 Mass. App. Ct. 845, 848 (1981). Our independent review of the record discloses the following.</p>\n<p id=\"b59-5\">True Plastics is a manufacturer of made-to-order plastic components. It does not carry an inventory of its own; rather, it creates custom items in response to specific orders. One of its regular customers was Flexhead Industries, Inc. (Flexhead), which placed an order for 4,000 plastic pieces around September 20, 2004.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> This order was almost three times larger than any previous order Flexhead had placed with True Plastics. The pieces were to be delivered on a rolling basis as they were completed.</p>\n<p id=\"b59-6\">Once price and other terms of the order were finalized, David True (the owner of True Plastics) assessed whether his workforce could complete the order on its own or whether additional workers were required.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> Given the fluctuating nature of True Plastics\u2019s business and the fact that it could not control the timing of its customers\u2019 orders, the company regularly turned to staffing agencies when its own workforce did not suffice.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b59-7\">True did not believe that the Flexhead order could be completed using his own employees because they were already fully occupied filling other large orders. He therefore called Dynamic Staffing and requested a temporary worker for the Flexhead order. True estimated that it would take this one worker six or <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"20\">*20</page-number>seven weeks to complete the Flexhead order, but he did not disclose this estimate to Dynamic Staffing. True and Dynamic Staffing both simply understood that the worker would be assigned to True Plastics for an indefinite period until she was no longer needed.</p>\n<p id=\"b60-5\">Sanchez arrived at True Plastics on September 27, 2004, and she worked as a machine operator on other projects for a few days while she was trained and while waiting for the raw materials for the Flexhead order to arrive. Once the materials arrived, Sanchez worked exclusively on the Flexhead order until she was injured about three weeks later. By that time, Sanchez had completed nearly one-half of the Flexhead order, which was entirely consistent with True\u2019s estimate of how long the job would take. Because Sanchez was injured, True Plastics could not finish the remainder of the order, and it lost Flexhead as a customer.</p>\n<p id=\"b60-6\">True Plastics was insured by Central Mutual under a CGL policy that, subject to various exclusions, provided coverage for \u201cthose sums that the insured becomes legally obligated to pay as damages because of \u2018bodily injury.\u2019 \u201d At issue in this case is the \u201cEmployer\u2019s Liability\u201d exclusion in Section I of the policy. That provision excludes coverage for any employer liability for bodily injury to \u201c[a]n \u2018employee\u2019 of the insured\u201d arising out of the course of his or her employment. To determine whether a person is an \u201cemployee\u201d for purposes of the exclusion, one must turn to the \u201cDefinitions\u201d section (Section V) of the policy. Section V provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b60-7\">\u201c \u2018Employee\u2019 includes a Teased worker.\u2019 \u2018Employee\u2019 does not include a \u2018temporary worker.\u2019 \u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b60-8\">A \u201cleased worker\u201d is defined as</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b60-9\">\u201ca person leased to you by a labor leasing firm under an agreement between you and the labor leasing firm, to perform duties related to the conduct of your business. \u2018Leased worker\u2019 does not include a \u2018temporary worker.\u2019 \u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b60-10\">A \u201ctemporary worker\u201d is</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b60-11\">\u201ca person who is furnished to you to substitute for a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"21\">*21</page-number>permanent \u2018employee\u2019 on leave or to meet seasonal or short-term workload conditions.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b61-5\"><em>Discussion. </em>\u201cThe interpretation of an insurance contract and the application of policy language to known facts present questions of law\u201d for the courts to decide. <em>Herbert A. Sullivan, Inc. </em>v. <em>Utica Mut. Ins. Co., </em>439 Mass. 387, 394 (2003). We \u201cconstrue the words of the policy according to the fair meaning of the language used, as applied to the subject matter.\u201d <em>Jacobs </em>v. <em>United States Fid. &amp; Guar. Co., </em>417 Mass. 75, 76 (1994). When the words of the policy are not ambiguous, \u201cthey must be construed in their usual and ordinary sense,\u201d <em>id. </em>at 77, quoting from <em>Hanover Ins. Co. </em>v. <em>Ramsey, </em>405 Mass. 1101, 1101 (1989), taking into account \u201cwhat an objectively reasonable insured, reading the relevant policy language, would expect to be covered.\u201d <em>Ruggerio Ambulance Serv., Inc. </em>v. <em>National Grange Mut. Ins. Co., </em>430 Mass. 794, 798 (2000), quoting from <em>Hakim </em>v. <em>Massachusetts Insurers\u2019 Insolvency Fund, </em>424 Mass. 275, 285 (1997).</p>\n<p id=\"b61-6\">The insurance policy at issue in this case is a CGL policy designed to \u201cprotect an insured employer against liability for losses to third parties arising out of the operation of the insured\u2019s business.\u201d <em>Monticello Ins. Co. </em>v. <em>Dion, </em>65 Mass. App. Ct. 46, 47 (2005). \u201cInjuries to employees are typically excluded from coverage ... as the expectation is that the employer will have in place workers\u2019 compensation insurance (or self-insurance) in one of the forms made compulsory by G. L. c. 152, \u00a7 25A.\u201d <em>Ibid. </em>\u201cUnlike the Teased worker,\u2019 for whose benefit workers\u2019 compensation insurance was reliably maintained by the general employer (the labor-leasing agency), it is possible that the \u2018temporary worker\u2019 exception to the general exclusion of coverage for employees may have been intended as gap coverage to protect the special employer (i.e., the CGL insured) where the furnishing employer may lack coverage.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 49-50. \u201cIt appears that [the Insurance Services Office, Inc. (ISO),] added the definitions of \u2018employee,\u2019 Teased worker,\u2019 and \u2018temporary worker\u2019 in 1993 to \u2018cover the nontraditional employment relationship where a client company is using the services of employees of a staffing company.\u2019 \u201d AMCO Ins. Co. vs. Dorp<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"22\">*22</page-number>inghaus, U.S. Dist. Ct., No. 05-1296, slip op. at note 4 (D. Minn. Jan. 12, 2007), quoting <em>from American Family Mut. Ins. Co. </em>v. <em>Tickle, 99 </em>S.W.3d 25, 30 (Mo. Ct. App. 2003). See <em>General Agents Ins. Co. of America, Inc. </em>v. <em>Mandrill Corp., </em>243 Fed. Appx. 961, 967 (6th Cir. 2007).</p>\n<p id=\"b62-7\">The parties agree that if Sanchez was a \u201ctemporary worker\u201d as defined by the policy, i.e., a person furnished to meet short-term workload conditions, then Central Mutual is required to defend and indemnify True Plastics.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> The parties also agree that if Sanchez was not furnished to meet short-term workload conditions, then she was a \u201cleased worker\u201d and no coverage is afforded under the CGL policy. They part ways, however, over who has the burden of proof and whether Sanchez was furnished to meet short-term workload conditions. We address each issue in turn.</p>\n<p id=\"b62-9\">\u2018 \u2018An insured bears the initial burden of proving that the claimed loss falls within the coverage of the insurance policy. Once the insured does this, the burden then shifts to the insurer to show that a separate exclusion to coverage is applicable to the particular circumstances of the case. Finally, where the insured seeks to establish coverage through an exception contained within an exclusion to coverage, the burden shifts back to the insured to prove coverage for the claimed loss.\u201d <em>Boazova </em>v. <em>Safety Ins. Co., </em>462 Mass. 346, 351 (2012) (citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b62-18\">Central Mutual does not dispute that it bears the burden of establishing that the policy\u2019s \u201cEmployer\u2019s Liability\u201d exclusion applies. That burden includes proving that Sanchez was an \u201cemployee\u201d within the scope of the exclusion, see <em>Hanover Ins. Co. </em>v. <em>Talhouni, </em>413 Mass. 781, 785 (1992), which in turn requires that Central Mutual demonstrate that Sanchez satisfies the definition of \u201cemployee\u201d contained in the \u201cDefinitions\u201d section of the policy. The Manichean definition of \u201cemployee\u201d has two parts, one negative and one positive. The positive proposition states that \u201cleased workers\u201d are employees for purposes of the CGL policy. Because this provision expands the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"23\">*23</page-number>universe of persons excluded from coverage, the insurer has the burden of proving that a person falls within its scope. The negative proposition operates in the opposite way; it carves out an exception from the universe of persons excluded from coverage. Put differently, it extends coverage to persons who are \u201ctemporary workers.\u201d We have previously construed this provision as the \u201c \u2018temporary worker\u2019 exception to the policy\u2019s otherwise general exclusion of coverage for accidents to employees.\u201d <em>Monticello Ins. Co. </em>v. <em>Dion, </em>65 Mass. App. Ct. at 49. See <em>Scottsdale Ins. Co. </em>v. <em>Torres, </em>561 F.3d 74, 78-79 (1st Cir. 2009) <em>(Scottsdale II) </em>(referring to \u201ctemporary worker\u201d as an \u201cexception to the exclusion\u201d). So construed, True Plastics bears the burden of establishing that Sanchez was a \u201ctemporary worker,\u201d in other words, that she was furnished to meet short-term workload conditions.</p>\n<p id=\"b63-5\">The phrase \u201cshort-term workload condition\u201d is undefined and \u201cis a relative term [that] can include a wide variety of temporal periods.\u201d Perlmutter, The Law of \u201cLeased Worker\u201d and \u201cTemporary Worker\u201d under a CGL Policy, 45 Tort Trial &amp; Ins. Prac. L.J. 761, 793 (2010). If assessed against the facts retrospectively (i.e., from the point in time when the accident occurred), the phrase is ambiguous. See <em>Bituminous Cas. Corp. </em>v. <em>Mike Ross, Inc., </em>413 F. Supp. 2d 740, 745 (N.D. W. Va. 2006) ; Perlmutter, <em>supra </em>at 788. See also <em>Pacific Employers Ins. Co. </em>v. <em>Wausau Bus. Ins. Co., </em>508 F. Supp. 2d 1167, 1176 (M.D. Fla. 2007) (\u201cshort-term\u201d is ambiguous). If assessed prospectively, i.e., from the time the worker is furnished, then the phrase is not ambiguous because it only requires a factual inquiry into the reasonable expectation of the insured at the time the worker was furnished. See <em>Scottsdale Ins. Co. </em>v. <em>Carrabassett Trading Co., </em>460 F. Supp. 2d 251, 257 (D. Mass. 2006) <em>(Scottsdale I), </em>vacated and remanded on other grounds, 561 F.3d 74 (1st Cir. 2009).<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> Like the United States Court of Appeals for the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"24\">*24</page-number>First Circuit, we turn to the Federal District Court\u2019s analysis to illuminate the point:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b64-5\">\u201cA threshold question is whether the terms \u2018seasonal\u2019 and \u2018short-term\u2019 are to be measured at the time the agreement is made or at some point thereafter. For example, a worker might be supplied to meet an anticipated one-week shortage (and therefore be \u2018short-term,\u2019 as measured by the parties\u2019 expectations), but wind up working for three years (and therefore be \u2018long-term,\u2019 as measured in hindsight).\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b64-6\"><em>Scottsdale II, </em>561 F.3d at 79, quoting from <em>Scottsdale I, </em>460 F. Supp. 2d at 257. We see no reason to employ an analytical viewpoint that will result in an ambiguity in the policy language. We therefore hold that the phrase \u201cshort-term workload condition\u201d is to be assessed prospectively from the time the worker was furnished. Even if a worker\u2019s assignment ends up being lengthy, he or she will still be a \u201ctemporary worker\u201d within the meaning of the policy, provided the insured held an objectively reasonable expectation at the time that the worker was furnished to meet a short-term workload condition.</p>\n<p id=\"b64-7\">Central Mutual argues that \u201cshort-term\u201d workload conditions cannot be \u201cindefinite,\u201d but we disagree. A short-term workload condition need not necessarily be of finite duration. \u201c[W]e do not view [Sanchez\u2019s] \u2018indefinite\u2019 placement as necessarily incompatible with the possibility that [she] was addressing a \u2018short-term workload condition.\u2019 \u201d <em>Scottsdale II, </em>561 F.3d at 79.</p>\n<p id=\"b64-8\">With this legal framework in mind, it is clear that True Plastics has met its burden of proving that Sanchez was furnished to meet a short-term increase in True Plastics\u2019s workload caused by the Flexhead order, and was therefore a \u201ctemporary worker\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"25\">*25</page-number>under the CGL policy. David True\u2019s assessment that an additional worker, working five to six weeks, was needed to complete the Flexhead order was objectively reasonable. The order was unusually large, True Plastics\u2019s own employees were fully occupied filling other large orders, Sanchez completed one-half of the order in three weeks, and True Plastics was unable to complete the order after Sanchez was injured. Once the necessary raw materials arrived, Sanchez worked exclusively on the Flexhead order. The fact that True Plastics had a regular practice of meeting its fluctuating workflow with temporary employees does not mean that the Flexhead order was anything other than a \u201cshort-term workload\u201d condition or that Sanchez was furnished for any reason other than meeting that short-term condition.</p>\n<p id=\"b65-5\">\n<em>Judgment affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b58-7\">Sanchez was employed by Dynamic Staffing, which was responsible for paying her and for withholding workers\u2019 compensation and other taxes from her pay.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b58-8\">Any amounts recovered by Sanchez in such an action go first to repay the insurer, and Sanchez is only entitled to receive any excess. G. L. c. 152, \u00a7 15. In this way, the statutory scheme guards against duplicate recovery by the injured employee.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b58-9\">True Plastics counterclaimed, seeking a declaration that Central Mutual owed a duty to defend and indemnify with respect to Sanchez\u2019s claim.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b58-11\">Whether this was, precisely speaking, a \u201ccase stated\u201d is debatable. Among the documentary materials submitted to the trial judge were deposition transcripts, the substance of which was not stipulated or otherwise agreed to. See, e.g., <em>Caissie </em>v. <em>Cambridge, </em>317 Mass. 346, 347 (1944) (\u201cThe statement of agreed facts contains all the material facts upon which the rights of the parties are to be determined in accordance with the law. It thus constituted a case stated\u201d). Indeed, summary judgment had previously been denied on the ground that factual issues remained concerning whether Sanchez was a leased worker <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"19\">*19</page-number>or a temporary worker. Nonetheless, the parties agreed to submit the case for decision based on the documentary evidence, apparently willing to permit the trial judge to resolve any factual conflicts or tensions as he saw fit. Neither side objected below, or now on appeal, to the procedure employed.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b59-12\">That said, we acknowledge the Superior Court judge\u2019s thoughtful, lucid, and detailed analysis and factual findings. Although we draw our own independent conclusions, we note that they largely mirror those of the trial judge.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b59-13\">The written purchase order was dated September 24, 2004.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b59-14\">True Plastics had eleven full-time employees and two part-time employees.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"9\">\n<p id=\"b59-15\">True Plastics used labor staffing companies in 2001, 2002, 2003, and 2004, sometimes on a weekly basis.

In 2004, True Plastics used temporary workers every month, ranging from a low of 211 hours one month to 547.5 hours in October, the month in which Sanchez was injured.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"10\">\n<p id=\"b62-29\">It is undisputed that Sanchez did not substitute for a permanent employee, nor was she furnished to meet a seasonal workload condition. Accordingly, the only way Sanchez can be a \u201ctemporary worker\u201d is if she was furnished to meet a short-term workload condition.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"11\">\n<p id=\"b63-7\">Other jurisdictions have divided on whether the \u201ctemporary worker\u201d definition is ambiguous, but these cases have turned on the construction of the \u201cfurnished to\u201d language, which is not at issue here.
