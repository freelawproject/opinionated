King, appeals from his conviction and sentence for theft based upon false information submitted on applications for food stamps and Medicaid benefits. King contends that the state did not present sufficient evidence to support the conviction. He also contends that his trial <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"348\">*348</page-number>counsel was ineffective. Finally, King contends that the trial court abused its discretion in imposing certain conditions as part of a community control sanction.</p>\n<p id=\"b378-5\">{\u00b6 2} From the record before us, we conclude that the state presented sufficient evidence to support the conviction. We also conclude that King was denied the effective assistance of counsel. We further conclude that the trial court abused its discretion in sentencing, and that the sentence must be modified. Accordingly, the judgment of the trial court is modified, and affirmed as modified.</p>\n<p id=\"b378-6\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b378-7\">{\u00b6 3} King became paralyzed in 1993. Since that time, he has received Social Security benefits for his disability. Additionally, his three minor children receive benefits from Social Security as a result of King\u2019s disability.</p>\n<p id=\"b378-8\">{\u00b6 4} In late 1998, while King was hospitalized for complications of his paralysis, hospital personnel initiated an application for him to receive benefits for his medical expenses. Mary Stanfel, an employee from the Champaign County Department of Job and Family Services (\u201cthe Department\u201d) visited King in the hospital, interviewed him, and filled out an application for benefits. King signed the application on December 3, 1998. The application indicated that King lived with one of his minor children, and that both King and his son received Social Security benefits. As a result of the application, King began to receive food stamps and Medicaid benefits. King\u2019s entitlement to continue receiving these benefits was redetermined on a yearly basis, at which time he was required to meet with a representative from the Department and fill out a \u201credetermination form.\u201d Redetermination forms were completed, and signed by King, in November 1999 and 2000. King was aware that he was required to report any change of circumstance affecting his right to benefits within ten days of its occurrence.</p>\n<p id=\"b378-9\">{\u00b6 5} In February 2001, the Department became aware that King\u2019s son, Cody, was residing with King\u2019s ex-wife rather than with King, which would decrease the amount of King\u2019s food stamp benefits. When confronted by Sherry Benston, an investigator for the Department, King insisted that Cody was still residing with him and that he was just attending school in the mother\u2019s district. However, it was verified that Cody had been residing with his mother in another school district as of August 2000.</p>\n<p id=\"b378-10\">{\u00b6 6} The Department then learned that King also received, as payee, the Social Security benefit checks for both of his minor daughters. The daughters, at all times pertinent to this case, resided with King\u2019s ex-wife. It was determined that King used these monies to pay his child support obligation for the girls, and that he listed the checks as his income in the divorce documents. It was further <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"349\">*349</page-number>determined that while King reported his child support obligation as an expense on his benefits eligibility forms, he did not report the checks as income. According to the Department, the income from these checks would have reduced the amount of his benefits. The Department computed that, based upon the unreported income and Cody\u2019s change of residence, King was overpaid $1,535 in Medicaid benefits and $3,333 in food stamps.</p>\n<p id=\"b379-5\">{\u00b6 7} King was indicted on one count of theft, in violation of R.C. 2913.02(A)(3). Following a jury trial, King was convicted as charged. The trial court sentenced King to community control sanctions for a period of three years. King was ordered to pay restitution in the amount of $4,868. As part of the \u201cspecial conditions\u201d of the community control sanctions, the trial court ordered King to perform 80 hours of community service and also required King to obtain and maintain a \u201cconventional haircut\u201d and to \u201cremain clean shaven.\u201d From his conviction and sentence, King appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b379-6\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b379-7\">{\u00b6 8} King\u2019s first assignment of error states as follows:</p>\n<p id=\"b379-8\">{\u00b6 9} \u201cThere is a lack of sufficiency of evidence to support a conviction of appellant.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b379-9\">{\u00b6 10} King contends that the state did not present sufficient evidence to support his conviction for theft.</p>\n<p id=\"b379-10\">{\u00b6 11} In determining whether the evidence presented at trial is sufficient to support a conviction, a reviewing court must decide whether the evidence, \u201cif believed, would convince the average mind of the defendant\u2019s guilt beyond a reasonable doubt.\u201d <em>State v. Jenks </em>(1991), 61 Ohio St.3d 259, 574 N.E.2d 492, paragraph two of the syllabus. \u201cThe relevant inquiry is whether, after viewing the evidence in a light most favorable to the prosecution, any rational trier of fact could have found the essential elements of the crime proven beyond a reasonable doubt.\u201d Id.</p>\n<p id=\"b379-11\">{\u00b6 12} The elements of theft by deception are set forth in R.C. 2913.02, which provides:</p>\n<p id=\"b379-12\">{\u00b6 13} \u201c(A) No person, with purpose to deprive the owner of property or services, shall knowingly obtain or exert control over either the property or services in any of the following ways: * * * (3) By deception * * *.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b379-13\">{\u00b6 14} R.C. 2913.01(A) defines \u201cdeception\u201d as \u201cknowingly deceiving another or causing another to be deceived by any false or misleading representation, by withholding information, * * * or by any other conduct, act, or omission that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"350\">*350</page-number>creates, confirms, or perpetuates a false impression in another, including a false impression as to law, value, state of mind, or other objective or subjective fact.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b380-5\">{\u00b6 15} Thus, the state was required to prove that King, with purpose to deprive the Department of property, knowingly obtained public assistance benefits by deception, by deceiving, or causing the Department to be deceived by any false or misleading representation, by withholding information, or by any conduct, act, or omission that created or perpetuated a false impression.</p>\n<p id=\"b380-6\">{\u00b6 16} There is evidence in the record that King failed to correctly report his income at the time he signed the original application or at the time he signed his redetermination applications. Additionally, there is evidence that he failed to report the change in residence of his son, even when confronted by the Department with the issue. There is evidence that he was aware of the need to report his income from all sources and any change in his son\u2019s residency. The state introduced evidence that King obtained benefits after failing to be truthful about his income and his son\u2019s residency, and that the Department relied upon the information provided by King. Therefore, we conclude that the state presented sufficient evidence to support King\u2019s conviction for theft.</p>\n<p id=\"b380-7\">{\u00b6 17} The first assignment of error is overruled.</p>\n<p id=\"b380-8\">Ill</p>\n<p id=\"b380-9\">{\u00b6 18} The second assignment of error presented by King is as follows:</p>\n<p id=\"b380-10\">{\u00b6 19} \u201cAppellant was denied effective assistance of counsel by her failure to seek an instruction on mistake or accident.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b380-11\">{\u00b6 20} In support of his claim that defense counsel was ineffective at trial, King contends that counsel failed to seek jury instructions on \u201cmistake and accident\u201d with regard to the issue of the social security benefits checks which he received as payee for his daughters.</p>\n<p id=\"b380-12\">{\u00b6 21} To prevail on a claim of ineffective assistance of counsel, a defendant must show both deficient performance and resulting prejudice. <em>State v. Bradley </em>(1989), 42 Ohio St.3d 136, 538 N.E.2d 373, paragraph two of the syllabus. To demonstrate deficiency, a defendant must show that counsel\u2019s representation fell below an objective standard of reasonableness. Id. at 142, 538 N.E.2d 373. Trial counsel is entitled to a strong presumption that his or her conduct falls within the wide range of reasonable assistance. Id. Assuming that counsel\u2019s performance was ineffective, the defendant must still show that the error had an effect on the judgment. Id. Reversal is warranted only where the defendant demonstrates that there is a reasonable probability that, but for counsel\u2019s errors, the result of the proceeding would have been different. Id.</p>\n<p id=\"b381-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"351\">*351</page-number>{\u00b6 22} In this case, King testified that he asked Stanfel whether he needed to report his daughters\u2019 Social Security checks as income, and was told that he did not. Therefore, we conclude that King presented evidence upon which a jury arguably could find that his failure to report the Social Security checks as income was the product of a mistake. Given that there was evidence presented regarding mistake, we find that trial counsel\u2019s performance fell below the requisite standard for failing to request an instruction on mistake with regard to whether King was required to report the Social Security checks, and that King was prejudiced thereby.</p>\n<p id=\"b381-5\">{\u00b6 23} To the extent that this argument may be intended to include a claim that King was entitled to an instruction on mistake with regard to the issue of whether he failed to inform the Department that Cody had moved out of his house, we note that our review of the record reveals no evidence to support such an instruction with regard to this claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b381-6\">{\u00b6 24} Given that trial counsel failed to request a relevant jury instruction which was merited by the evidence presented, we conclude that trial counsel\u2019s performance was deficient. However, given that King was properly convicted with regard to the portion of the charge that found that he failed to report that Cody had moved out, and that he was overpaid $3,333 in food stamps, the conviction may stand as this amount is sufficient to support the conviction. Accordingly, the second assignment of error is sustained in part.</p>\n<p id=\"b381-7\">IV</p>\n<p id=\"b381-8\">{\u00b6 25} King\u2019s third assignment of error provides:</p>\n<p id=\"b381-9\">{\u00b6 26} \u201cThe trial court\u2019s sentence with reference to hair-cuts and shaving are [sic] unconstitutional and over-broad.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b381-10\">{\u00b6 27} King contends that the trial court\u2019s orders that he get a conventional haircut and remain clean-shaven are unconstitutional. He also claims that the order requiring him to perform 80 hours of community service is invalid, because it assumes that he would be capable of performing community service despite the fact that he is a paraplegic.</p>\n<p id=\"b381-11\">{\u00b628} A review of the sentencing transcript reveals that the trial court ordered King to get a \u201cconventional haircut\u201d and to remain clean shaven to \u201cchange how [King] views himself and change how others view [him].\u201d As the state notes in its brief, we have previously addressed exactly this issue with the Champaign County Court of Common Pleas in <em>State v. Alexander </em>(Oct. 6, 2000), Champaign App. No. 2000 CA 6, 2000 WL 1475578, wherein we held:</p>\n<p id=\"b382-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"352\">*352</page-number>{\u00b6 29} \u201c[T]he trial court abused its discretion in requiring [the defendant] to be clean shaven during his probationary period as the condition bore no relation to his rehabilitation, bears no relationship to the [theft] charge of which he was convicted, nor does it relate to conduct which is criminal. The condition, in short, \u2018unnecessarily\u2019 impinges on the defendant probationer\u2019s liberty.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b382-4\">{\u00b6 30} With regard to his claim that the order of community service is invalid, King contends that the sentencing order is not clear because it fails to recognize that he is not capable of performing all types of service given his disability. We note that the transcript of the sentencing hearing specifies that the order of community service will be arranged based upon King\u2019s physical limitations. Therefore, we find this argument to be without merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b382-5\">{\u00b6 31} The third assignment of error is sustained in part.</p>\n<p id=\"b382-6\">V</p>\n<p id=\"b382-7\">{\u00b6 32} King\u2019s first assignment of error having been overruled and his second and third assignments of error having been sustained in part, the judgment of the trial court is modified by striking from the special conditions of community control the orders \u201cthat Defendant shall have no facial hair and shall remain clean shaven\u201d and \u201cshall get a conventional haircut and keep it that way.\u201d The judgment is also modified so that the order requiring King to pay restitution is reduced by $1,535 (the amount 'of the overpayment for Medicaid benefits), from $4,868 to the amount of $3,333 (which is the amount that King was overpaid for food stamps). As modified, the judgment of the trial court is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b382-8\">Judgment affirmed.</p>\n<judges id=\"b382-9\">Grady and Frederick N.
