(\u201cEDB\u201d), is a retail and wholesale jeweler. It filed suit against defendants-appellees, Transnational Insurance Company (\u201cTransnational\u201d), International Jewelers Block &amp; Fine Arts Insurance Services (\u201cIJB\u201d), and E. Kinker &amp; Company, d.b.a. Kinker-Eveleigh Insurance Agency (\u201cKinker\u201d). It sought insurance coverage and/or damages for the failure to provide insurance related to the theft of jewelry from Brian Higgins, one of EDB\u2019s salespersons. The trial court granted appellees\u2019 motions for summary judgment and overruled EDB\u2019s motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b779-14\">{\u00b6 2} The record shows that on November 10, 1998, Higgins was driving through Georgia while returning from a sales trip when he decided to stop at a restaurant to eat. He pulled into the restaurant\u2019s parking lot and parked directly in front of the restaurant. He left three nylon bags containing trays of jewelry in the back seat of his Dodge Durango. He ate at a table by the restaurant\u2019s front windows so that he could see his SUV at all times.</p>\n<p id=\"b779-15\">{\u00b6 3} After eating, Higgins walked to the front of the restaurant to pay his check. He stated that he could see his vehicle as he approached the cashier\u2019s desk. After he paid for his meal with a credit card, an unidentified person told him that he had dropped some money. He became suspicious because he knew that he had not dropped any money, so he ran out to the parking lot where he <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"750\">*750</page-number>saw a white minivan sitting perpendicular to his SUV. He ran after the minivan and unsuccessfully tried to smash out its window, and the van sped out of the parking lot. Then Higgins noticed that his rear driver\u2019s side window had been \u201cpunched out\u201d and that his bags of jewelry were gone.</p>\n<p id=\"b780-4\">{\u00b6 4} At the time of the robbery, EDB was covered by a jeweler\u2019s block insurance policy that was issued by Commercial Underwriters Insurance Company (\u201cCUIC\u201d). It contained an unattended-vehicle exclusion. The policy provided that it insured against all risks of loss or damage to the insured property except \u201cMoss or damage to property while in or upon any Automobile, Motorcycle or any other vehicle unless, at the time of loss or damage occurs, there is actually in or upon such vehicle, the Insured, or a Permanent Employee of the Insured, or a person whose sole duty is to attend the vehicle, except as may be endorsed hereon.\u201d Coverage was ultimately denied based on this exclusion because Higgins was not \u201cactually in or upon\u201d the automobile at the time of the robbery.</p>\n<p id=\"b780-5\">{\u00b6 5} EDB did not receive the actual written policy until a few days after the robbery. In June 1998, Edward Lane, co-founder and president of EDB, had discussed insurance coverage for July 1998 through July 1999 with EDB\u2019s insurance agent, Richard Lonneman, who worked for Kinker. He met at the same time every year with Lonneman, who explained coverage and exclusions before any policies were issued. EDB frequently did not receive the policies themselves until several months later.</p>\n<p id=\"b780-6\">{\u00b6 6} Lane specifically declined the expensive unattended-vehicle coverage because it was company policy that vehicles should not be left unattended. In fact, the insurance polices issued to EDB in previous years had all contained unattended-vehicle exclusions with language similar to the policy issued by CUIC in 1998. Higgins testified that it was his understanding and an unwritten company policy that a vehicle was not unattended as long as it was in the salesperson\u2019s sight.</p>\n<p id=\"b780-7\">{\u00b6 7} After the June 1998 meeting, Lonneman contacted Brian McCluskey of IJB, a broker specializing in insurance for jewelers. IJB obtained a binder from Transnational and notified Lonneman that EDB\u2019s coverage was bound with Transnational effective July 1, 1998, through June 30, 1999. Lonneman forwarded the binder to EDB and notified EDB that Transnational was issuing the insurance policy.</p>\n<p id=\"b780-8\">{\u00b6 8} Transnational, however, was not licensed to do business in Ohio. Some confusion existed over whether Transnational would actually issue the policy, and numerous communications occurred between IJB and Transnational in July and August 1998, all without EDB\u2019s knowledge. Eventually, though, Transnational entered into a \u201cfronting\u201d arrangement with CUIC, which was licensed to do business in Ohio. Under that arrangement, CUIC issued the jeweler\u2019s block <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"751\">*751</page-number>policy. Transnational and CUIC entered into a reinsurance agreement in which all of CUIC\u2019s liability under the jeweler\u2019s block policy issued to EDB was reinsured by Transnational. Under this agreement, Transnational was required to fully reimburse and hold CUIC harmless for any covered claims that may have arisen under the policy CUIC issued to EDB. After the robbery, Transnational never claimed that the binder was not valid or stated that it was not obligated to provide insurance coverage to EDB. The sole reason coverage was denied was the unattended-vehicle exclusion.</p>\n<p id=\"b781-4\">{\u00b6 9} In this appeal, EDB presents three assignments of error for review, which we address out of order. EDB does not raise the central issue in the case, which is the validity of the unattended-vehicle exclusion, until its third assignment of error. In that assignment of error, it argues that the phrase \u201cactually in or upon\u201d the vehicle is ambiguous and therefore must be construed in its favor. It also argues that because appellees were not properly licensed in Ohio to issue jeweler\u2019s block insurance, the exclusionary clause was not enforceable by the insurer. This assignment of error is not well taken.</p>\n<p id=\"b781-5\">{\u00b6 10} An insurance policy is a contract, and the relationship between the insurer and the insured is purely contractual in nature. <em>Nationwide Mut. Ins. Co. v. Marsh </em>(1984), 15 Ohio St.3d 107, 109, 15 OBR 261, 472 N.E.2d 1061. The interpretation and construction of insurance policies is a matter of law to be determined by the court using rules of construction and interpretation applicable to contracts generally. <em>Gomolka v. State Auto. Mut. Ins. Co. </em>(1982), 70 Ohio St.2d 166, 167-168, 24 O.O.3d 274, 436 N.E.2d 1347. In insurance polices, as in other contracts, courts should give words and phrases their plain and ordinary meaning unless something in the contract indicates a contrary intention. <em>Olmstead v. Lumbermens Mut. Ins. Co. </em>(1970), 22 Ohio St.2d 212, 216, 51 O.O.2d 285, 259 N.E.2d 123; <em>Nationwide Ins. Co. v. Tobler </em>(1992), 80 Ohio App.3d 560, 564, 609 N.E.2d 1318.</p>\n<p id=\"b781-6\">{\u00b6 11} Where an insurance policy\u2019s provisions are clear and unambiguous, courts must apply the terms as written and may not enlarge the contract by implication to embrace an object distinct from that contemplated by the parties. <em>Gomolka, </em>supra, at 168, 24 O.O.3d 274, 436 N.E.2d 1347; <em>Bowling v. St. Paul Fire &amp; Marine Ins. Co., </em>149 Ohio App.3d 290, 2002-Ohio-4933, 776 N.E.2d 1175, at \u00b6 15; <em>Tobler, </em>supra, at 564, 609 N.E.2d 1318. However, where the provisions of an insurance policy are reasonably susceptible of more than one interpretation, courts must construe them strictly against the insurer and liberally in favor of the insured. <em>King v. Nationwide Ins. Co. </em>(1988), 35 Ohio St.3d 208, 519 N.E.2d 1380, syllabus; <em>Bowling, </em>supra, at \u00b6 15.</p>\n<p id=\"b782-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"752\">*752</page-number>{\u00b6 12} At issue in this case is the interpretation of the phrase \u201cactually in or upon the vehicle\u201d contained in the unattended-vehicle exclusion. EDB relies upon <em>Gottlieb &amp; Sons, Inc. v. Hanover Ins. Co. </em>(Apr. 21, 1994), 4th Dist. No. 64559, 1994 WL 144539, which is the only Ohio case we can find on the issue. In that case, the theft occurred when the employee had left jewelry in the trunk of his car while he briefly went into a hotel to inquire about a room. The court held that the phrase \u201cin or upon the vehicle\u201d in the unattended-vehicle exclusion was ambiguous. Therefore, it reversed the trial court\u2019s granting of summary judgment to the insurer. It remanded the case to the trial court to determine whether the employee \u201cwas within a reasonable geographic perimeter around the vehicle and had some reasonable relationship with the vehicle at the time the theft occurred.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b782-5\">{\u00b6 13} We disagree with the reasoning of <em>Gottlieb. </em>Most cases interpreting similar policy language have found the phrase \u201cin or upon the vehicle\u201d to be unambiguous. See Annotation, Construction and Effect of \u201cJeweler\u2019s Block\u201d Policies or Provisions Contained Therein (1994), 22 A.L.R.5th 579; Couch on Insurance (3d Ed.2003), Section 154:74. Based on exclusions with nearly identical language, courts have consistently \u201cdenied coverage to insureds who were not literally in or upon their vehicles at the time of the losses, even though the insureds may have been only a short distance away from the vehicle, watching the vehicle, or absent from the vehicle for only a short period of time.\u201d <em>Am. Stone Diamond, Inc. v. Lloyds of London </em>(S.D.Tex.1996), 934 F.Supp. 839, 843. Accord <em>Thomas Noe, Inc. v. Homestead Ins. Co. </em>(C.A.6, 1999), 173 F.3d 581; <em>Jerome I. Silverman, Inc. v. Lloyd\u2019s Underwriters, Inc. </em>(S.D.N.Y.1976), 422 F.Supp. 89; <em>Revesz v. Excess Ins. Co. </em>(1973), 30 Cal.App.3d 125, 106 Cal.Rptr. 166; <em>Williams v. Fallaize Ins. Agency, Inc. </em>(1996), 220 Ga.App. 411, 469 S.E.2d 752; <em>Phil G. Ruvelson, Inc. v. St. Paul Fire &amp; Marine Ins. Co. </em>(1951), 235 Minn. 243, 50 N.W.2d 629; <em>Wideband Jewelry Corp. v. Sun Ins. Co. of New York, Inc. </em>(1994), 210 A.D.2d 220, 619 N.Y.S.2d 339; <em>Royce Furs, Inc. v. Home Ins. Co. </em>(1968), 30 A.D.2d 238, 291 N.Y.S.2d 529.</p>\n<p id=\"b782-6\">{\u00b6 14} We agree with the reasoning of those cases. In our view, the phrase \u201cactually in or upon the vehicle\u201d is unambiguous. Therefore, we must apply the language of the policy as written. Under the plain language of the policy, no coverage exists because neither Higgins nor another EDB employee was actually in or upon the vehicle at the time of the theft.</p>\n<p id=\"b782-7\">{\u00b6 15} We realize this is a harsh result. Jeweler\u2019s block insurance is a special type of insurance designed to offer a single policy with adequate coverage for the risks inherent in the jewelry business. <em>Couch, </em>supra, at Section 1:57. No insurance policy insures against every loss, however. In this case, EDB specifically assumed the risk by declining unattended-vehicle coverage. \u201cThe mere fact <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"753\">*753</page-number>that the assured is compelled to assume a loss which has not been covered by the insurance will not justify courts, by a process of judicial construction, in stretching words beyond their usual meaning to compel an insurer to accept a risk not covered by the policy of insurance.\u201d <em>Ruvelson, </em>supra, at 251, 50 N.W.2d at 634.</p>\n<p id=\"b783-5\">{\u00b6 16} Nevertheless, EDB contends that the unattended-vehicle exclusion is not enforceable under R.C. 3901.17(H). R.C. 3901.17 generally discusses obtaining personal jurisdiction over a foreign insurer not authorized to transact business in Ohio. EDB contends that because appellees were not properly licensed in Ohio, section (H) of the statute applies. It states, \u201cNo contract of insurance effected in this state by mail or otherwise by any such insurer is enforceable by such insurer.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b783-6\">{\u00b6 17} However, the policy in this case was not issued by Transnational or the other appellees in this case. CUIC, which was licensed to do business in Ohio, issued the policy. Further, R.C. 3901.17(1) specifically provides that it does not apply to surplus-lines insurance under R.C. 3905.30 through 3905.36, which would include jeweler\u2019s block insurance, and to the \u201ctransaction of reinsurance by insurers.\u201d Consequently, the provision on which EDB relies does not apply in the present case.</p>\n<p id=\"b783-7\">{\u00b6 18} EDB refers to \u201crogue agents, brokers and insurers.\u201d The record does not support this scenario. Instead, it shows that reinsuring agreements are common in the industry and are a legitimate means of conducting business. EDB was covered by a valid insurance policy at the time of the robbery. That policy contained the same exclusion with virtually the same language that had been in the previous policies issued to EDB. The denial of the claim was not due to the invalidity of the policy but to the exclusion.</p>\n<p id=\"b783-8\">{\u00b6 19} Under the circumstances, we find no issue of material fact. Construing the evidence most strongly in EDB\u2019s favor, we hold that reasonable minds could reach but one conclusion \u2014 that coverage in this case was precluded by the unattended-vehicle exclusion. Appellees were entitled to judgment as a matter of law on EDB\u2019s breach-of-contract claim. Consequently, the trial court did not err in granting summary judgment in their favor. See <em>Harless v. Willis Day Warehousing Co. </em>(1978), 54 Ohio St.2d 64, 66, 8 O.O.3d 73, 375 N.E.2d 46; <em>Stinespring v. Natorp Garden Stores, Inc. </em>(1998), 127 Ohio App.3d 213, 215-216, 711 N.E.2d 1104.</p>\n<p id=\"b783-9\">{\u00b6 20} In its first assignment of error, EDB contends that the trial court erred in granting summary judgment in favor of appellees. It argues that it is negligence per se for a person or entity to conduct the business of insurance in Ohio without a proper license as required by former R.C. 3905.01, and that the trial court erred by refusing to apply this doctrine. Further, it argues that, in a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"754\">*754</page-number>dispute between an insured and various members of the insurance industry who were not licensed to conduct business in Ohio, the trial court erred in failing to apply R.C. 3901.17.</p>\n<p id=\"b784-4\">{\u00b6 21} It is undisputed that CUIC, which actually issued the policy in connection with the reinsurance agreement, was licensed to conduct business in Ohio. Further, the evidence showed that Lonneman and Kinker were both licensed to engage in the insurance business in Ohio. EDB\u2019s main complaint is that appellees had not obtained surplus-lines broker\u2019s licenses as required by R.C. 3905.30 through R.C. 3905.35.</p>\n<p id=\"b784-5\">{\u00b6 22} R.C. 3905.99 sets forth penalties of fines and imprisonment for violations of Ohio\u2019s surplus-lines law. At least two courts have held that the remedy set forth in R.C. 3905.99 is exclusive and creates no private right of action. <em>Highway Equip. Co. v. Alexander Howden Ltd. </em>(Bkrtcy.S.D.Ohio 1993), 153 B.R. 186, 202-203, affirmed (Aug. 15, 1995), S.D. Ohio No. 94-3372, 1995 WL 490125; <em>W. Res. Care Sys. v. Masters </em>(Sept. 28, 1999), 7th Dist. Nos. 97 CA 95 and 97 CA 104., 1999 WL 783951 We agree. See <em>Elwert v. Pilot Life Ins. Co. </em>(1991), 77 Ohio App.3d 529, 542, 602 N.E.2d 1219. \u201c[W]here a statute creates a new right or imposes a new duty, and prescribes a remedy for its violation, the remedy thus prescribed is exclusive.\u201d <em>Fletcher v. Coney Island, Inc. </em>(1955), 100 Ohio App. 259, 271, 60 O.O. 218, 136 N.E.2d 344.</p>\n<p id=\"b784-6\">{\u00b6 23} Further, even if we were to hold that appellees\u2019 alleged violations of Ohio\u2019s insurance licensing statutes were negligence per se, EDB was still not entitled to judgment as a matter of law. Proof of negligence per se is not proof of liability per se. EDB was still required to demonstrate that the appellees\u2019 negligence was the proximate cause of its damages. <em>Sikora v. Wenzel </em>(2000), 88 Ohio St.3d 493, 496-497, 727 N.E.2d 1277; <em>Pond v. Leslein </em>(1995), 72 Ohio St.3d 50, 647 N.E.2d 477.</p>\n<p id=\"b784-7\">{\u00b6 24} All of EDB\u2019s arguments regarding licensing are simply an attempt to circumvent the unattended-vehicle exclusion. The regulation of entities in the insurance business is to \u201cprevent or discourage the unregulated and unlicensed from carrying on\u201d the insurance business \u201cwithin the borders of Ohio * * *, thus protecting the public from surrendering its money in exchange for questionable or worthless pieces of paper denominated insurance policies.\u201d <em>State ex rel. Herbert v. Std. Oil Co. </em>(1941), 138 Ohio St. 376, 381, 20 O.O. 460, 35 N.E.2d 437. EDB was not the recipient of a worthless piece of paper. Appellees all acknowledged that the insurance policy issued by CUIC and reinsured by Transnational was a valid policy that would have covered EDB\u2019s loss but for the exclusion.</p>\n<p id=\"b785-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"755\">*755</page-number>{\u00b6 25} Policies issued in previous years to EDB all contained unattended-vehicle exclusions employing similar language. Lane testified that he specifically rejected the expensive unattended-vehicle coverage because EDB did not leave its vehicles unattended. EDB\u2019s misapprehension about what constituted an unattended vehicle cannot change the unambiguous policy language. The policy in effect at the time of the robbery and all previous policies clearly provided that coverage was excluded unless an EDB employee was \u201cactually in or upon the vehicle\u201d and did not merely have the vehicle in sight. Despite EDB\u2019s claim to the contrary, it got the coverage for which it had paid. Consequently, any alleged negligence by appellees in failing to obtain the proper licenses was not the proximate cause of EDB\u2019s loss and the trial court did not err in granting summary judgment in favor of appellees. See <em>Harless, </em>supra, at 66, 8 O.O.3d 73, 375 N.E.2d 46; <em>Stinespring, </em>supra, at 215, 711 N.E.2d 1104. We, therefore, overrule EDB\u2019s first assignment of error.</p>\n<p id=\"b785-4\">{\u00b6 26} In its second assignment of error, EDB contends that the trial court erred by refusing to grant its motion for summary judgment. It argues that the court should have applied the doctrines of promissory estoppel and negligent misrepresentation. This assignment of error is not well taken.</p>\n<p id=\"b785-5\">{\u00b6 27} The record shows that EDB did not meet its burden to demonstrate that it was entitled to judgment as a matter of law on the issues of promissory estoppel and negligent misrepresentation. See <em>Dresher v. Burt </em>(1996), 75 Ohio St.3d 280, 292-293, 662 N.E.2d 264; <em>Delman v. Cleveland Hts. </em>(1989), 41 Ohio St.3d 1, 4, 534 N.E.2d 835; <em>Talley v. Teamsters, Chauffeurs, Warehousemen &amp; Helpers, Local No. 377 </em>(1976), 48 Ohio St.2d 142, 146, 2 O.O.3d 297, 357 N.E.2d 44; <em>R. Corwin Pauly Jr. &amp; Assoc. v. Keko Corp., </em>146 Ohio App.3d 669, 2001-Ohio-4351, 767 N.E.2d 1203, at \u00b6 10; <em>Stinespring, </em>supra, at 215-216, 711 N.E.2d 1104; <em>Brose v. Bartlemay </em>(Apr. 16, 1997), 1st Dist. No. C-960423, 1997 WL 180287. These issues are another attempt to circumvent the clear and unambiguous terms of the policy. Consequently, the trial court did not err in overruling EDB\u2019s motion for summary judgment. We overrule EDB\u2019s second assignment of error and affirm the trial court\u2019s judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b785-6\">Judgment affirmed.</p>\n<judges id=\"b785-7\">Hildebrandt and Gorman, JJ., concur.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
