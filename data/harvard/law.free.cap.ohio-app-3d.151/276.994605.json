Hunter, has appealed a decision of the Wayne County Municipal Court that found him guilty of driving under suspension, operating a vehicle without a license, and falsification. This court affirms.</p>\n<p id=\"b310-6\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b310-7\">{\u00b6 2} On November 30, 2001, at approximately 2:00 a.m., appellant was driving along Canal Road in the Township of Wooster, when he was stopped by Trooper Barry Thompson. Trooper Thompson explained that he stopped appellant because appellant\u2019s exhaust system was causing the vehicle to make a loud noise. When asked for his identification, appellant informed Trooper Thompson that his name was \u201cDarrel L. Hunter\u201d and that he was born on September 15, 1966. A LEADS check revealed a warrant for \u201cDarrel L. Hunter\u201d issued by the Wooster Police Department. The Wooster police arrived at the scene, arrested appellant, and took him to jail still under the mistaken belief that appellant was \u201cDarrel L. Hunter.\u201d After arriving at the jail, appellant revealed his true identity and the police learned that appellant was under a Financial Responsibility Act suspension from January 5, 1999, to January 5, 2004. The police also learned that appellant\u2019s driver\u2019s license was expired. Appellant was then charged with driving without an operator\u2019s license, a violation of R.C. 4507.02(A)(1); driving under suspension, a violation of R.C. 4507.02(B)(1); and falsification, a violation of R.C. 4513.361. Appellant entered a plea of not guilty to the charges and filed a motion to suppress, challenging the basis for the initial traffic stop.</p>\n<p id=\"b310-8\">{\u00b6 3} On January 18, 2002, the Wayne County Municipal Court held an oral hearing on appellant\u2019s motion to suppress. The court denied the motion, and appellant subsequently entered a plea of no contest to the charges. The trial court accepted appellant\u2019s no contest pleas and sentenced him to six months in jail, a one-year license suspension, and a fine of $1,000 for driving under suspension; 90 days in jail and a fine of $500 for falsification; and six points on his license. The jail terms were to be served consecutively. Appellant has timely appealed, asserting two assignments of error.</p>\n<p id=\"b310-9\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b310-10\">Assignment of Error Number One</p>\n<p id=\"b310-11\">{\u00b6 4} \u201cThe trial court erred to the substantial prejudice of [appellant] in failing to disqualify himself in the proceeding.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b310-12\">{\u00b6 5} In appellant\u2019s first assignment of error, he has argued that the trial judge should have disqualified himself from appellant\u2019s case because the trial <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"281\">*281</page-number>judge had a personal bias and prejudice against appellant from past encounters. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b311-4\">{\u00b6 6} This court presumes that bias or prejudice on the part of the trial judge does not exist. See <em>Okocha v. Fehrenbacher </em>(1995), 101 Ohio App.3d 309, 322, 655 N.E.2d 744. In order to overcome this general presumption of integrity, a party must set forth evidence sufficient to demonstrate a trial judge\u2019s partiality. Id. If a party shows, however, that the trial judge exhibited bias or prejudice during a proceeding, then the trial judge must disqualify himself from the proceeding. See Canon 3(E)(1) of the Code of Judicial Conduct.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Furthermore, disagreement or dissatisfaction with a trial judge\u2019s opinions of law does not constitute bias or prejudice that mandates a judge\u2019s disqualification. See <em>In re Disqualification of Murphy </em>(1988), 36 Ohio St.3d 605, 522 N.E.2d 459.</p>\n<p id=\"b311-5\">{\u00b6 7} If a municipal court judge does not voluntarily recuse himself pursuant to Canon 3(E)(1) of the Code of Judicial Conduct, then either party may attempt to have a common pleas judge decide whether or not the municipal court judge should be disqualified. See R.C. 2701.031. In order to disqualify a municipal court judge, a party must comply with procedures as set forth in R.C. 2701.031, which provides:</p>\n<p id=\"b311-6\">{\u00b6 8} \u201c(A) If a judge of a municipal or county court allegedly * * * has a bias or prejudice for or against a party to a proceeding pending before the judge or to a party\u2019s counsel, or allegedly otherwise is disqualified to preside in a proceeding pending before the judge, any party to the proceeding or the party\u2019s counsel may file an affidavit of disqualification with the clerk of the court in which the proceeding is pending.</p>\n<p id=\"b311-7\">{\u00b6 9} \u201c(B) An affidavit of disqualification shall be filed under this section with the clerk of the court in which the proceeding is pending not less than seven calendar days before the day on which the next hearing in the proceeding is scheduled and shall include all of the following:</p>\n<p id=\"b311-8\">{\u00b6 10} \u201c(1) The specific allegations on which the claim of interest, bias, prejudice, or disqualification is based and the facts to support each of those allegations;</p>\n<p id=\"b311-9\">{\u00b6 11} \u201c(2) The jurat of a notary public or another person authorized to administer oaths or affirmations;</p>\n<p id=\"b312-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"282\">*282</page-number>{\u00b6 12} \u201c(3) A certificate indicating that a copy of the affidavit has been served on the judge of the municipal or county court against whom the affidavit is filed and on all other parties or their counsel;</p>\n<p id=\"b312-5\">{\u00b6 13} \u201c(4) The date of the next scheduled hearing in the proceeding or, if there is no hearing scheduled, a statement that there is no hearing scheduled.</p>\n<p id=\"b312-6\">{\u00b6 14} \u201c(C)(1) Except as provided in [R.C. 2701.031(C)(2)], when an affidavit of disqualification is presented to the clerk of a municipal or county court for filing under [R.C. 2701.031(B) ], the clerk shall enter the fact of the filing on the docket in that proceeding and shall provide notice of the filing of the affidavit to one of the following:</p>\n<p id=\"b312-7\">{\u00b6 15} \u201c(a) The presiding judge of the court of common pleas of the county;</p>\n<p id=\"b312-8\">{\u00b6 16} \u201c(b) If there is no presiding judge of the court of common pleas of the county, a judge of the court of common pleas of the county.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b312-9\">{\u00b6 17} \u201cR.C. 2701.031 * * * provides the exclusive means by which a litigant may claim that a municipal court judge is biased and prejudiced.\u201d <em>Walker v. J.W. Automotive </em>(June 29, 2001), 2d Dist. No. 18683, 2001 WL 726803; see, also, <em>Dale &amp; Madeline Bennington Creative Investors v. Robinson </em>(Feb. 7, 2000), 5th Dist. No. 1999CA00212, 2000 WL 222156, appeal not allowed (2000), 88 Ohio St.3d 1515, 728 N.E.2d 403.</p>\n<p id=\"b312-10\">{\u00b6 18} Pursuant to R.C. 2701.031(E) the presiding judge or a judge of the common pleas court has the authority to determine disqualification issues regarding judges of inferior courts. This court, however, has no authority to render a decision with regard to disqualification, <em>Nicolaci v. Littlejohn </em>(1989), 55 Ohio App.3d 147, 148, 563 N.E.2d 368,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> or to void a trial court\u2019s judgment on the basis of personal bias or prejudice on the part of the trial judge, <em>Beer v. Griffith </em>(1978), 54 Ohio St.2d 440, 441-442, 8 O.O.3d 438, 377 N.E.2d 775 (holding that the court of appeals was without authority to pass upon disqualification or to void the judgment of the trial court even if the judgment was erroneous); see, also, <em>State v. Greer </em>(Oct. 28, 1992), 9th Dist. No. 15217, at 18-19, 1992 WL 316350; <em>Holloway v. Holloway Sportswear, Inc., </em>3d Dist. Nos. 17-98-20 and 17-2000-18, at 8-9, 2001 WL 633792, appeal not allowed (2001), 93 Ohio St.3d 1451, 756 N.E.2d 115.</p>\n<p id=\"b312-11\">{\u00b6 19} In the instant case, appellant has contended that the trial judge showed bias and prejudice against appellant when, at the conclusion of the hearing on the motion to suppress, the trial judge told appellant that \u201cyou\u2019re not any more credible now than you were ten years ago.\u201d We decline to discuss, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"283\">*283</page-number>however, whether such a statement does indeed express bias or prejudice on the part of the trial judge. Appellant failed to make an objection to the trial court, nor did he file an affidavit of disqualification pursuant to R.C. 2701.031.</p>\n<p id=\"b313-5\">{\u00b6 20} Although appellant may have been unaware that the trial judge had an alleged personal bias or prejudice against him prior to the hearing on the motion to suppress, he was most certainly aware of any prejudice on the part of the trial judge after the hearing concluded. Appellant should have immediately filed an affidavit of disqualification after the suppression hearing.</p>\n<p id=\"b313-6\">{\u00b6 21} Because appellant failed to file an affidavit of disqualification and follow the procedures pursuant to R.C. 2701.031, he has waived the issue on appeal. <em>Sedlacko v. McCoy </em>(Feb. 25, 1999), 7th Dist. No. 96 CA 210, at * 6, 1999 WL 126925. And even if we assume that appellant somehow preserved this issue for review, this court would still refrain from determining whether the trial judge should have disqualified himself from the proceeding. As previously stated, an appellate court has no jurisdiction to vacate the trial court\u2019s judgment on an appellant\u2019s claim of judicial bias. <em>Beer, </em>54 Ohio St.2d at 441-442, 8 O.O.3d 438, 377 N.E.2d 775; see, also, <em>Nicolaci, </em>55 Ohio App.3d at 148, 563 N.E.2d 368; <em>State v. Ramos </em>(1993), 88 Ohio App.3d 394, 398, 623 N.E.2d 1336; <em>Kettering v. Berger </em>(1982), 4 Ohio App.3d 254, 255, 4 OBR 471, 448 N.E.2d 458; <em>Sims v. Sims </em>(Jan. 13, 2000), 8th Dist. No. 74425, 2000 WL 23184; <em>Walker, </em>supra. Accordingly, appellant\u2019s first assignment of error is without merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b313-7\">Assignment of Error Number Two</p>\n<p id=\"b313-8\">{\u00b6 22} \u201cThe trial court erred in denying [appellant\u2019s] motion to suppress because the trooper had no reasonable suspicion to initiate the traffic stop.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b313-9\">{\u00b6 23} In appellant\u2019s second assignment of error, he has argued that the trial court erred by denying his motion to suppress. Specifically, appellant has argued that Trooper Thompson had no reasonable suspicion to believe that appellant was engaged in criminal activity or committing a traffic offense when he stopped appellant. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b313-10\">{\u00b624} An appellate court\u2019s review of a trial court\u2019s ruling on a motion to suppress presents both questions of law and fact. <em>State v. Long </em>(1998), 127 Ohio App.3d 328, 332, 713 N.E.2d 1. In a hearing on a motion to suppress, the trial court assumes the role of the trier of fact and is in the best position to weigh the credibility of the witnesses. <em>State v. Hopfer </em>(1996), 112 Ohio App.3d 521, 548, 679 N.E.2d 321, appeal not allowed (1996), 77 Ohio St.3d 1488, 673 N.E.2d 146. Thus, an appellate court\u2019s review of the trial court\u2019s findings of fact looks only for clear error, giving due deference as to the inferences drawn from the facts by the trial court. <em>State v. Russell </em>(1998), 127 Ohio App.3d 414, 416, 713 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"284\">*284</page-number>N.E.2d 56, citing <em>Ornelas v. United States </em>(1996), 517 U.S. 690, 698-699, 116 S.Ct. 1657, 134 L.Ed.2d 911. Therefore, we are bound to accept the trial court\u2019s findings of fact if they are supported by some competent, credible evidence. <em>State v. Guysinger </em>(1993), 86 Ohio App.3d 592, 594, 621 N.E.2d 726. \u201cThe trial court\u2019s legal conclusions, however, are afforded no deference, but are reviewed <em>de novo.\u201d Russell, </em>127 Ohio App.3d at 416, 713 N.E.2d 56.</p>\n<p id=\"b314-5\">{\u00b625} In the instant matter, three witnesses testified at the suppression hearing: Trooper Thompson, John Fink, and appellant. Trooper Thompson testified that he stopped appellant\u2019s vehicle because of excessive noise coming from the exhaust system. Trooper Thompson stated that he initially heard the noise coming from appellant\u2019s car when appellant was approximately 20 or 25 feet away from his cruiser. Trooper Thompson explained that the noise coming from appellant\u2019s car was \u201ckind of a more loud rumble, not only rumble cause the Honda\u2019s don\u2019t have a real [d]eep noise to them it\u2019s a smaller engine[.]\u201d Trooper Thompson further explained that when he heard the noise he thought:</p>\n<p id=\"b314-6\">{\u00b6 26} \u201cJust basically at that time of the year the winter time when you\u2019re most time going to have your windows up, if you have an exhaust leak the exhaust isn\u2019t getting past your vehicle if you have any holes in your floorboard you\u2019re going to get exhaust fumes up in your car have carbon monoxide in there.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b314-7\">{\u00b6 27} John Fink, appellant\u2019s auto mechanic, testified that he checked appellant\u2019s vehicle on two separate occasions. On October 6, 2001, Fink put a muffler on appellant\u2019s car. Fink stated that after placing the muffler on the car, he started the car up and it was a \u201cquiet car,\u201d and that there were no problems with the operation of the vehicle\u2019s exhaust system at that time. On January 5, 2002, several months after appellant was arrested for the underlying crimes in the case sub judice, Fink inspected appellant\u2019s car. After inspecting the vehicle, Fink determined that the vehicle was \u201cin good working order,\u201d and the muffler that he initially put on the vehicle in October 2001 was still working properly. Appellant also testified that his vehicle was not making any loud noises on the night he was pulled over by Trooper Thompson.</p>\n<p id=\"b314-8\">{\u00b6 28} Although the testimony of Fink and Trooper Thompson posed a potential conflict, the trial court found the testimony of both witnesses to be credible, and stated: \u201cEven if Thompson was mistaken [about the loud noise coming from appellant\u2019s car], this court believes that he made this stop based upon hearing what he believed to be an exhaust leak.\u201d As some competent, credible evidence supports the trial court\u2019s factual findings, this court will not disturb those findings; thus, we need only determine whether those facts meet the applicable legal standard. See <em>Guysinger, </em>86 Ohio App.3d at 594, 621 N.E.2d 726.</p>\n<p id=\"b315-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"285\">*285</page-number>{\u00b6 29} The Fourth Amendment to the United States Constitution provides:</p>\n<p id=\"b315-4\">{\u00b6 30} \u201cThe right of the people to be secure in their persons, houses, papers, and effects, against unreasonable searches and seizures, shall not be violated, and no Warrants shall issue, but upon probable cause, supported by Oath or affirmation, and particularly describing the place to be searched, and the persons or things to be seized.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b315-5\">{\u00b6 31} Where an officer has observed a traffic violation, a stop is constitutionally valid. <em>Dayton v. Erickson </em>(1996), 76 Ohio St.3d 3, 11, 665 N.E.2d 1091. In addition, under the Fourth and Fourteenth Amendments to the United States Constitution, as well as Section 14, Article I of the Ohio Constitution, a police officer is justified in conducting a brief investigative stop of an individual if he has a reasonable and articulable suspicion that the individual is or has been engaged in criminal activity. <em>Terry v. Ohio </em>(1968), 392 U.S. 1, 21, 88 S.Ct. 1868, 20 L.Ed.2d 889; <em>State v. Andrews </em>(1991), 57 Ohio St.3d 86, 87, 565 N.E.2d 1271, certiorari denied (1991), 501 U.S. 1220, 111 S.Ct. 2833, 115 L.Ed.2d 1002. \u201cReasonable suspicion\u201d is more than an ill-defined hunch; it must be based upon a \u201cparticularized and objective basis for suspecting the particular person * * * of criminal activity.\u201d <em>United States v. Cortez </em>(1981), 449 U.S. 411, 417-418, 101 S.Ct. 690, 66 L.Ed.2d 621.</p>\n<p id=\"b315-6\">{\u00b6 32} Furthermore, the reasonableness of an investigative stop by a police officer must be viewed in light of the totality of the surrounding circumstances. <em>State v. Bobo </em>(1988), 37 Ohio St.3d 177, 524 N.E.2d 489, paragraph one of the syllabus, certiorari denied (1988), 488 U.S. 910, 109 S.Ct. 264, 102 L.Ed.2d 252. If a stop is determined to be in violation of an individual\u2019s constitutional right against unreasonable searches and seizures, then the evidence obtained as a result of the stop will be suppressed as fruit of the illegal search. See <em>Terry, </em>392 U.S. at 29, 88 S.Ct. 1868, 20 L.Ed.2d 889.</p>\n<p id=\"b315-7\">{\u00b6 33} Notwithstanding the Supreme Court\u2019s holding in <em>Terry, </em>an officer does not always need a reasonable suspicion, based on specific and articulable facts, to specifically conclude that an individual is engaged in criminal activity in order to conduct an investigatory stop. In other words, \u201cnothing in the Fourth Amendment requires that the \u2018specific and articulable facts\u2019 relate to suspected criminal activity.\u201d <em>State v. Norman </em>(1999), 136 Ohio App.3d 46, 53, 735 N.E.2d 953. The court in <em>Norman </em>further explained:</p>\n<p id=\"b315-8\">{\u00b6 34} \u2018Were we to insist that every investigative stop be founded on such suspicion, we would be overlooking the police officer\u2019s legitimate role as a public servant designed to assist those in distress and to maintain and foster public safety. That is, law enforcement officers may legitimately approach persons and vehicles for purposes other than criminal investigation.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b316-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"286\">*286</page-number>{\u00b6'35} In <em>Norman, </em>the appellate court affirmed the trial court\u2019s decision which denied a defendant\u2019s motion to suppress. The defendant in <em>Norman </em>argued essentially the same issue as appellant does in the instant matter: his arrest was the result of an illegal search and seizure on the part of the state of Ohio and the trial court erred by denying his motion to suppress.</p>\n<p id=\"b316-5\">{\u00b6 36} During the defendant\u2019s suppression hearing in <em>Norman, </em>the arresting officer testified that she noticed that the defendant\u2019s vehicle was stopped at a stop sign for an extended period of time; it was approximately 2:43 a.m. when the officer noticed the defendant\u2019s vehicle. After passing the defendant\u2019s stopped vehicle, and returning minutes later to see the vehicle still sitting stationary at the stop sign, the arresting officer activated her overhead lights and pulled alongside the vehicle to ask the defendant why he was waiting at the stop sign. When asked why the arresting officer approached the vehicle, the officer testified that \u201cshe was concerned for the safety of other motorists as well as the passengers of the stationary vehicle.\u201d <em>Norman, </em>136 Ohio App.3d at 49, 735 N.E.2d 953. The arresting officer also stated that she did not believe that the defendant was or had been engaged in criminal activity when she stopped him. Id. at 50, 735 N.E.2d 953.</p>\n<p id=\"b316-6\">{\u00b6 37} In holding that an officer may stop an individual based on reasonable suspicion that the individual\u2019s safety is at issue, the <em>Norman </em>court stated:</p>\n<p id=\"b316-7\">{\u00b6 38} \u201cPolice officers without reasonable suspicion of criminal activity are allowed to intrude on a person\u2019s privacy to carry out \u2018community caretaking functions\u2019 to enhance public safety. The key to such permissible police action is the reasonableness required by the Fourth Amendment. When approaching a vehicle for safety reasons, the police officer must be able to point to reasonable, articulable facts upon which to base her safety concerns.\u201d Id.</p>\n<p id=\"b316-8\">{\u00b6 39} In the case sub judice, Trooper Thompson claimed he was worried about appellant\u2019s safety because carbon monoxide from a faulty exhaust pipe could leak into appellant\u2019s vehicle, which could pose a serious threat to appellant\u2019s health and safety. During the hearing, Fink also implied that it was reasonable to worry over the safety of an improperly functioning exhaust system. When asked whether maintaining a satisfactory muffler and exhaust system should be a safety concern in the winter, Fink responded: \u201cIn the winter, yes, or any time for that fact.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b316-9\">{\u00b6 40} It is immaterial that Trooper Thompson was not focusing on potential criminal activity when he stopped appellant because \u201c[l]aw enforcement officers may legitimately stop cars for purposes other than criminal investigation.\u201d <em>State v. Thayer </em>(Aug. 31, 1990), 2d Dist. No. 2667, 1990 WL 125704; see, also, <em>Norman, </em>136 Ohio App.3d at 54, 735 N.E.2d 953 (\u201cunder appropriate circumstances a law enforcement officer may be justified in approaching a vehicle <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"287\">*287</page-number>to provide assistance, without needing any reasonable basis to suspect criminal activity\u201d). Moreover, the United States Supreme Court has recognized the legitimacy of such stops, stating:</p>\n<p id=\"b317-5\">{\u00b6 41} \u201cBecause of the extensive regulation of motor vehicles and traffic, and also because of the frequency with which a vehicle can become disabled or involved in an accident on public highways, the extent of police-citizen contact involving automobiles will be substantially greater than police-citizen contact in a home or office. Some such contacts will occur because the officer may believe the operator has violated a criminal statute, but many more will not be of that nature. <em>Local police officers </em>* * * <em>frequently investigate vehicle accidents in which there is no claim of criminal liability and engage in what, for want of a better term, may be described as community caretaking functions, totally divorced from the detection, investigation, or acquisition of evidence relating to the violation of a criminal statute.\u201d </em>(Emphasis added.) <em>Cady v. Dombrowski </em>(1973), 413 U.S. 433, 441, 93 S.Ct. 2523, 37 L.Ed.2d 706.</p>\n<p id=\"b317-6\">{\u00b6 42} We conclude that, in light of the surrounding circumstances, Trooper Thompson\u2019s reasons for stopping appellant\u2019s vehicle were sufficient to justify the stop. Trooper Thompson testified that because the winter weather forced drivers to keep their windows up, he feared that appellant might be in danger from the noxious gases that were emitted as a result of the potentially faulty exhaust system. It is clear that Trooper Thompson had specific and articulable facts sufficient to support his concern for appellant\u2019s safety. Furthermore, a law enforcement officer in Trooper Thompson\u2019s position would reasonably have had the same concerns for the safety of any driver upon hearing the driver\u2019s car making a noise similar to the sounds Trooper Thompson heard coming from appellant\u2019s vehicle.</p>\n<p id=\"b317-7\">{\u00b6 43} Even though we affirm the trial court\u2019s decision on the ground that a law enforcement officer may legitimately stop a vehicle if the officer has reasonable suspicion to conclude that an individual\u2019s safety is at risk, we are still mindful of the dangers expressed in <em>Delaware v. Prouse </em>(1979), 440 U.S. 648, 99 S.Ct. 1391, 59 L.Ed.2d 660.</p>\n<p id=\"b317-8\">{\u00b6 44} The Supreme Court in <em>Prouse </em>was faced with determining:</p>\n<p id=\"b317-9\">{\u00b6 45} \u201c[Wjhether it is an unreasonable seizure under the Fourth Amendment and Fourteenth Amendments to stop an automobile * * * for the purpose of checking the driving license of the operator and the registration of the car, where there is neither probable cause to believe nor reasonable suspicion that the car is being driven contrary to the laws governing the operation of motor vehicles or that either the car or any of its occupants is subject to seizure or detention in connection with the violation of any other applicable law.\u201d Id. at 650, 99 S.Ct. 1391, 59 L.Ed.2d 660.</p>\n<p id=\"b318-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"288\">*288</page-number>{\u00b6 46} The Supreme Court found that the spot license stops were extremely discretionary because there were no set guidelines for determining who should be stopped. Such discretionary stops, as the Supreme Court noted, were not justified by their marginal contributions to highway safety in light of other less intrusive means available to the state in regulating the highways. Id. at 660, 99 S.Ct. 1391, 59 L.Ed.2d 660. The <em>Prouse </em>court further noted: \u201cTo insist neither upon an appropriate factual basis for suspicion directed at a particular automobile nor upon some other substantial and objective standard or rule to govern the exercise of discretion \u2018would invite intrusions upon constitutionally guaranteed rights based on nothing more substantial than inarticulate hunches * * \u201d Id. at 661, 99 S.Ct. 1391, 59 L.Ed.2d 660, quoting <em>Terry, </em>392 U.S. at 22, 88 S.Ct. 1868, 20 L.Ed.2d 889. On this basis, the Supreme Court held:</p>\n<p id=\"b318-6\">{\u00b6 47} \u201c[EJxcept in those situations in which there is at least articulable and reasonable suspicion that a motorist is unlicensed or that an automobile is not registered, or that either the vehicle or an occupant is otherwise subject to seizure for violation of law, stopping an automobile and detaining the driver in order to check his driver\u2019s license and the registration of the automobile are unreasonable under the Fourth Amendment.\u201d <em>Prouse, </em>440 U.S. at 663, 99 S.Ct. 1391, 59 L.Ed.2d 660.</p>\n<p id=\"b318-7\">{\u00b6 48} The problems inherent in the random spot license and registration stops in <em>Prouse </em>are not present in the case at bar. The same reasonableness standard that is applied when an officer stops a vehicle because he believes the driver was engaged in criminal activity also applies to an officer who stops a vehicle for safety reasons. A law enforcement officer who stops a citizen in the belief that the driver\u2019s safety is at risk must still have a reasonable suspicion, based upon specific and articulable facts, to have such concerns. A stop by an officer who lacks a reasonable suspicion to conclude that the driver\u2019s safety is in danger is in violation of the driver\u2019s constitutional rights.</p>\n<p id=\"b318-8\">{\u00b6 49} In continuing to apply the reasonableness standard to safety stops, this court upholds the essential purpose of the proscriptions in the Fourth Amendment, which were intended \u201c \u2018 \u201cto safeguard the privacy and security of individuals against arbitrary invasions.\u201d \u2019 \u201d <em>Prouse, </em>440 U.S. at 653-654, 99 S.Ct. 1391, 59 L.Ed.2d 660, quoting <em>Camara v. San Francisco Mun. Court </em>(1967), 387 U.S. 523, 528, 87 S.Ct. 1727, 18 L.Ed.2d 930.</p>\n<p id=\"b318-9\">{\u00b6 50} On another matter, we address the trial court\u2019s reasoning for denying appellant\u2019s motion to suppress. We are not oblivious to the fact that the trial court denied appellant\u2019s motion to suppress on a different ground. The trial court\u2019s journal entry stated: \u201cThe court finds that the arresting officer has articulated sufficient facts to establish a reasonable suspicion that [appellant] was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"289\">*289</page-number>violating R.C. 4513.22. The stop of [appellant\u2019s] vehicle was, therefore, justified.\u201d Although we affirm the trial court\u2019s decision, we do so without concluding that Trooper Thompson stopped appellant based on the belief that appellant was violating R.C. 4513.22. The record clearly indicates that Trooper Thompson did not stop appellant because he believed appellant was engaged in possible criminal activity or violating any traffic laws. Rather, Trooper Thompson stopped appellant because he was concerned for appellant\u2019s safety. A trial judge cannot \u201clisten to the testimony of [an] officer, and then attempt to justify the stop on a basis which was not articulated by the officer.\u201d <em>State v. Cockrell </em>(July 25, 1994), 4th Dist. No. 93CA1957, 1994 WL 390360. Therefore, we reject the trial court\u2019s conclusion that the stop was constitutional based on a perceived violation of Ohio traffic laws.</p>\n<p id=\"b319-5\">{\u00b6 51} Although the reasoning behind the trial court\u2019s decision was erroneous, we will not reverse its decision. A reviewing court is not authorized to reverse a correct judgment simply because the trial court has stated an erroneous basis for that judgment. <em>Myers v. Garson </em>(1993), 66 Ohio St.3d 610, 614, 614 N.E.2d 742. Therefore, we find that appellant\u2019s second assignment of error is without merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b319-6\">Ill</p>\n<p id=\"b319-7\">{\u00b6 52} Appellant\u2019s assignments of error are overruled. The decision of the trial court is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b319-8\">Judgment affirmed.</p>\n<judges id=\"b319-9\">Baird, P.J., and Batchelder, J., concur.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b311-10\">. {la} This section provides:</p>\n<p id=\"b311-11\">{\u00b6 b} \"(1) A judge shall disqualify himself or herself in a proceeding in which the judge's impartiality might reasonably be questioned, including but not limited to instances where:</p>\n<p id=\"Auv\">{\u00b6 c} \"(a) The judge has a personal bias or prejudice concerning a party or a party\u2019s lawyer, or personal knowledge of disputed evidentiary facts concerning the proceeding}.]\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b312-12\">.
