(Attached as Appendix A.) The magistrate decided the requested writ of mandamus should be granted. Respondent-claimant, Mary L. Kolter, has filed an objection to the magistrate\u2019s decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b655-7\">{\u00b6 3} The magistrate concluded that the report of psychologist Warren Bertner, on which claimant relied, is not \u201csome evidence\u201d to support continued temporary total disability compensation because Bertner, a psychologist, expressed an opinion on medical issues. In his August 30, 2001 report, Bertner stated:</p>\n<p id=\"b655-8\">{\u00b6 4} \u201cIn my view * * *, Ms. Kolter has not yet reached MMI.</p>\n<p id=\"b655-9\">{\u00b6 5} \u201cI can not see Ms. Kolter returning to her job until her headaches are better controlled. Until these daily reminders of her ordeal are managed better she has more reason to be depressed. I also believe that these headaches are slowing her further recovery. * * *</p>\n<p id=\"b655-10\">{\u00b6 6} \u201cI do not see that Ms. Kolter\u2019s depression is in remission. * * *\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b655-11\">{\u00b6 7} As a psychologist, Bertner was qualified to express an opinion as to whether claimant\u2019s allowed condition of depression had reached maximum medical improvement. The fact that Bertner may have considered her depression to find its source in a medical condition, here, claimant\u2019s headaches should not necessarily preclude consideration of his report as to the psychological aspects of her claim. Thus, we find claimant\u2019s objection to be well taken.</p>\n<p id=\"b655-12\">{\u00b6 8} Upon a review of the magistrate\u2019s decision and an independent review of the file, this court adopts the magistrate\u2019s decision but rejects the conclusions of law that there was no evidence upon which the commission could rely to continue temporary total disability compensation. We grant a writ of mandamus to order respondent, Industrial Commission of Ohio, to vacate its order that denied Kohl\u2019s motion to terminate temporary total disability compensation and to enter a new order that grants or denies such compensation and sets forth the evidence upon which the commission relies.</p>\n<p id=\"b655-13\">Objection sustained and writ of mandamus granted.</p>\n<judges id=\"b655-14\">Tyack and Deshler, JJ., concur.</judges>\n<p id=\"b656-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"626\">*626</page-number>APPENDIX A</p>\n<p id=\"b656-5\">IN MANDAMUS</p>\n<p id=\"b656-6\">{\u00b6 9} In this original action, relator, Kohl\u2019s Department Stores (\u201cKohl\u2019s\u201d), requests a writ of mandamus ordering respondent Industrial Commission of Ohio (\u201ccommission\u201d) to vacate its order denying Kohl\u2019s July 19, 2001 motion to terminate temporary total disability (\u201cTTD\u201d) compensation, and to enter an order granting said motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b656-7\">Findings of Fact</p>\n<p id=\"b656-8\">{\u00b6 10} 1. On January 11, 1997, respondent Mary L. Kolter (\u201cclaimant\u201d) was employed as a \u201closs prevention supervisor\u201d for Kohl\u2019s at one of its department stores located in Columbus, Ohio.</p>\n<p id=\"b656-9\">{\u00b6 11} 2. On January 11, 1997, claimant chased a female shoplifter out the door and to the rear of the building where she was assaulted by two male accomplices with stun guns. She lay unconscious on the ground for approximately ten minutes before she was found. She was transported to the emergency room at Riverside Methodist Hospital.</p>\n<p id=\"b656-10\">{\u00b6 12} 8. Kohl\u2019s is a self-insured employer under Ohio\u2019s workers\u2019 compensation laws. Kohl\u2019s certified the industrial claim which was initially recognized for \u201cright foot sprain, right ankle sprain, right foot contusion, right ankle contusion.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b656-11\">{\u00b6 13} 4. In February 1997, claimant began treating with psychologist Warren L. Bertner, M.Ed. In a report dated June 23, 1997, Mr. Bertner opined that claimant was suffering from \u201cMajor Depression\u201d and \u201cPost-Traumatic Stress Disorder\u201d caused by her industrial injury.</p>\n<p id=\"b656-12\">{\u00b6 14} 5. On June 16, 1997, claimant was examined by Lisa P. Fugate, M.D., who opined that claimant \u201cmeets the criteria for post-traumatic stress disorder.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b656-13\">{\u00b6 15} 6. On July 18, 1997, citing the reports of Mr. Bertner and Dr. Fugate, claimant moved that her claim be additionally allowed for major depression and posttraumatic stress disorder.</p>\n<p id=\"b656-14\">{\u00b6 16} 7. On November 10, 1997, Mr. Bertner certified TTD on form C-84 due to posttraumatic stress disorder beginning February 5,1997.</p>\n<p id=\"b656-15\">{\u00b6 17} 8. Following a November 19, 1997 hearing, a district hearing officer (\u201cDHO\u201d) issued an order additionally allowing the claim for posttraumatic stress disorder but disallowing the claim for major depression. The DHO also awarded TTD compensation \u201cfrom 04/14/1997 through 11/19/1997 based on Dr. [sic] Bertner\u2019s C-84 on file and shall continue upon submission of proof supportive of temporary total disability.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b657-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"627\">*627</page-number>{\u00b6 18} 9. Kohl\u2019s administratively appealed the DHO\u2019s order of November 19, 1997. Following a January 21, 1998 hearing, a staff hearing officer (\u201cSHO\u201d) issued an order affirming the DHO\u2019s order.</p>\n<p id=\"b657-5\">{\u00b6 19} 10. Kohl\u2019s and claimant administratively appealed the SHO\u2019s order of January 21, 1998 to the commission. Following a March 19, 1998 hearing before the three-member commission, the commission issued an order stating that the SHO\u2019s order was being modified. The commission further allowed the claim for major depression based upon Mr. Bertner\u2019s June 23,1997 report. The order also stated that \u201ctemporary total compensation is to continue as previously granted.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b657-6\">{\u00b6 20} 11. In the meantime, during 1997 and 1998, claimant was treated by Miles E. Drake, Jr., M.D.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> At that time, Dr. Drake was an associate professor of neurology and psychiatry at the Ohio State University. Through a written interrogatory, Dr. Drake was asked to state the diagnosis of the condition for which he was treating claimant. Dr. Drake wrote: \u201cpost-concussion syndrome, sequelae of electrical injury to the central nervous system.\u201d Dr. Drake also linked the condition being treated to the industrial event of January 11, 1997.</p>\n<p id=\"b657-7\">{\u00b6 21} 12. On August 29, 2000, Mr. Bertner wrote:</p>\n<p id=\"b657-8\">{\u00b6 22} \u201cIn later 1997 she began to see Dr. Drake at OSU who evaluated her tremors, numbness, migraines, and physical coordination problems. I continued to see her for anxiety, depression, and post-traumatic stress. Dr. Drake placed her on anti-seizure medication like Depakote, and Tegretol. She was also placed on Remeron, Prozac, and Topamax. She continued to report migraines with the medication, but the medications brought them down to a less intense level.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b657-9\">{\u00b6 23} 13. On June 28, 2000, citing Dr. Drake\u2019s office notes and responses to interrogatories, claimant moved for an additional claim allowance.</p>\n<p id=\"b657-10\">{\u00b6 24} 14. Following an August 30, 2000 hearing, a DHO issued an order additionally allowing the claim for \u201cpost-concussion syndrome sequelae of electrical injury to the central nervous system\u201d based upon the medical evidence from Dr. Drake and Mr. Bertner\u2019s August 29, 2000 report.</p>\n<p id=\"b657-11\">{\u00b6 25} 15. Kohl\u2019s administratively appealed the August 30, 2000 DHO\u2019s order. Following an October 5, 2000 hearing, an SHO issued an order affirming the DHO\u2019s order of August 30, 2000.</p>\n<p id=\"b657-12\">{\u00b6 26} 16. In the meantime, on August 11, 2000, claimant was examined by psychologist Lee Howard, Ph.D., on behalf of Kohl\u2019s. Dr. Howard opined:</p>\n<p id=\"b658-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"628\">*628</page-number>{\u00b6 27} \u201cThere is really no <em>objective </em>evidence that would prohibit the claimant from returning to her previous type of employment. Any inability to do so would be based upon subjective complaints only.</p>\n<p id=\"b658-5\">{\u00b6 28} \u201c* * *</p>\n<p id=\"b658-6\">{\u00b6 29} \u201c* * * [T]he claimant has reached maximum medical improvement. She has had psychotherapy continuously for two and a half years and psychotropic medications. Her symptoms are minimal and/or significantly improved.\u201d (Emphasis sic.)</p>\n<p id=\"b658-7\">{\u00b6 30} 17. On October 2, 2000, Mr. Bertner authored a four-page report critical of Dr. Howard\u2019s August 11, 2000 report. Mr. Bertner concluded:</p>\n<p id=\"b658-8\">{\u00b6 31} \u201cI believe that Ms. Kolter continues to be depressed although less so. She admits to feeling better and this is documented.</p>\n<p id=\"b658-9\">{\u00b6 32} \u201cMs. Kolter\u2019s Post-traumatic Stress Disorder is under better control. She is having some flashbacks but these are now coming weekly rather than daily. She is not in full remission but shows slow improvement.</p>\n<p id=\"b658-10\">{\u00b6 33} \u201cMs. Kolter has not reached MMI in terms of her Depression or her PTSD her two previously recognized conditions. Both conditions continue to improve slowly.</p>\n<p id=\"b658-11\">{\u00b6 34} \u2019 \u201cMs. Kolter\u2019s neurological condition is neither mild nor the result of \u2018iatrogenic\u2019 factors. It may be the case that or[g]anic factors are handicapping her recovery but only so far clinical data supports this assertion.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b658-12\">{\u00b6 35} 18. On April 30, 2001, Debra A. Grayson, D.O., completed a C-84 certifying TTD beginning April 26, 2001. The C-84 form asks the examining physician to \u201c[ljist ICD-9 Codes with narrative diagnosis(es) for allowed conditions being treated which prevent return to work.\u201d In response, Dr. Grayson wrote \u201c296.20 Depression] Psychosis.\u201d Dr. Grayson listed \u201cDepression, PTSD\u201d for her objective clinical findings. The C-84 form poses the following queries:</p>\n<p id=\"b658-13\">{\u00b6 36} \u201cHas the work related injury(s) or disease reached a treatment plateau at which no fundamental functional or physiological change can be expected despite continuing medical or rehabilitative intervention? (Maximum Medical Improvement) * * * If no, indicate any barriers preventing normal recovery, or maximum medical improvement. * * *\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b658-14\">{\u00b6 37} In response to the first query, Dr. Grayson marked the \u201cNo\u201d box. In response to the second query, Dr. Grayson wrote \u201cNeeds To See Neuro.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b658-15\">{\u00b6 38} 19. On June 18, 2001, in response to a request for information from Kohl\u2019s workers\u2019 compensation service company, Mr. Bertner wrote:</p>\n<p id=\"b659-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"629\">*629</page-number>{\u00b6 39} \u201cI do not have a prospective date for Kolter to return to work. I am fairly confident that she will not return to Kohl\u2019s as a Loss Prevention Supervisor. I do not believe she will return to Kohl\u2019s in a light duty capacity. I do not believe that maximum medical recovery has been obtained. My opinion is based first on the slow recovery process she exhibits and the intrusion of what I consider to be neurological obstacles in her daily experience \u2014 confusion, migraine pain, unpredictability in her ability to execute the activities of daily life.</p>\n<p id=\"b659-5\">{\u00b6 40} \u201cIn order to better assess and treat Ms. Kolter\u2019s medical condition as opposed to a more behavioral/psychological approach, I have asked Ms. Kolter to transfer the physician of record from myself to Debra Grayson, M.D. I feel Dr. Grayson is better equipped to evaluate, treat and overcome Ms. Kolter\u2019s remaining obstacles to employment.</p>\n<p id=\"b659-6\">{\u00b6 41} \u201cMs. Kolter\u2019s condition in my opinion is not stable enough to allow her to return to gainful employment or be involved in a rehabilitation program.</p>\n<p id=\"b659-7\">{\u00b6 42} \u201cI believe that all of her medical conditions together preclude her resuming employment. She would personally prefer to work if she could. No outside obstacles unrelated to her attack stand in the way as far as I am aware.</p>\n<p id=\"b659-8\">{\u00b6 43} \u201cMy plan of treatment has been consistent with treating her anxiety and depression. Supportive cognitive-behavioral counseling has been utilized. As it has become clear to me that neurological pain as distinct from psychological trauma is a significant factor in her condition, I have counseled her to use a M.D. as her primary treating professional with myself as secondary.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b659-9\">{\u00b6 44} 20. On August 22, 2001, claimant moved that Dr. Grayson be recognized as her treating physician of record for her physical conditions and that Mr. Bertner be recognized as the treating doctor for her psychological conditions.</p>\n<p id=\"b659-10\">{\u00b6 45} 21. Following an October 31, 2001 hearing, a DHO issued an order granting claimant\u2019s August 22, 2001 motion. The DHO\u2019s order states:</p>\n<p id=\"b659-11\">{\u00b6 46} \u201cThe District Hearing Officer recognizes Dr. Grayson as the physician of record for the allowed physical conditions of the claim. * * *</p>\n<p id=\"b659-12\">{\u00b6 47} \u201cPsychologist Bertner remains authorized to treat the allowed psychological conditions of the claim.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b659-13\">{\u00b6 48} 22. Apparently, the October 31, 2001 DHO\u2019s order was not administratively appealed.</p>\n<p id=\"b659-14\">{\u00b6 49} 23. In the meantime, on June 22, 2001, claimant was again examined by Dr. Howard on Kohl\u2019s behalf. Dr. Howard reported:</p>\n<p id=\"b659-15\">{\u00b6 50} \u201cThis individual demonstrates normal mental status results and/or even improved mental status results when compared with the earlier evaluation. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"630\">*630</page-number>Thus, there is no evidence of any alteration in her mental functioning as a result of her injury.</p>\n<p id=\"b660-5\">{\u00b6 51} \u201c* * *</p>\n<p id=\"b660-6\">{\u00b6 52} \u201cHer MMPI test results over two different settings indicate that compensatory factors are contributing to the clinical picture beyond simple psychopathologieal factors and this is not amenable to traditional psychological or psychiatric techniques.</p>\n<p id=\"b660-7\">{\u00b6 53} \u201c* * *</p>\n<p id=\"b660-8\">{\u00b6 54} \u201cThe claimant is able to return to her previous type of work without restriction and/or modification. Any restrictions would be caused by physical symptoms and/or motivational factors.</p>\n<p id=\"b660-9\">{\u00b6 55} \u201c* * *</p>\n<p id=\"b660-10\">{\u00b6 56} \u201cThe claimant has reached maximum improvement based upon multiple factors listed in the discussion/conclusions above.</p>\n<p id=\"b660-11\">{\u00b6 57} \u201c* * *</p>\n<p id=\"b660-12\">{\u00b6 58} \u201cTreatment has been somewhat excessive over the last year or so. The claimant should have been gradually phased out by this late date and reinforced for return to work activities, exploration of vocational options, and/or BVR contact. Prolonged treatment such as this four years after the injury is likely fostering dependency as opposed to independent or functional behavior.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b660-13\">{\u00b6 59} 24. On July 19, 2001, citing Dr. Howard\u2019s June 22, 2001 report, Kohl\u2019s moved for a hearing \u201con the issue of MMI and termination of temporary total compensation.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b660-14\">{\u00b6 60} 25. On August 30, 2001, Mr. Bertner authored a four page report critical of Dr. Howard\u2019s reports of August 11, 2000 and June 22, 2001. Mr. Bertner\u2019s report states:</p>\n<p id=\"b660-15\">{\u00b6 61} \u201cDr. Howard disagrees that Ms. Kolter\u2019s head injury is of any importance. He reports on p.14 of his August, 2000 report that \u2018There is unlikely to be neuropsychological sequelae as a result of this mild head injury.\u2019 On p.14 of his June, 2001 report (# 9) he repeats his assertion and believes that therapy itself or compensatory factors are maintaining her difficulties. This conclusion is reached in spite of his listing her medications including a high dose of Depakote, and the use of Carbatrol and Topamax - antiseizure medication and pain medication. With this judgment he puts himself at odds with the last industrial hearing that included Post Concussion Syndrome as part of her claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b660-16\">{\u00b6 62} \u201cDr. Howard indicates what appear[s] to me [to be] inconsistent statements. He found Ms. Kolter to have reached MMI in August, 2000. He <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"631\">*631</page-number>then indicates on p.14 # 6 that she is actually doing better or so it appears to him from her earlier evaluation. I would like to believe that Dr. Howard is endorsing my view expressed in reports and on-going C-84s that my work with Ms. Kolter has shown slow but positive progress. I suspect in spite of his tally of my treatment sessions with her or his view that her condition will not respond to traditional psychiatric or psychological techniques that he is able to see that her activity level, comfort level, and mental status have improved in the last ten months.</p>\n<p id=\"b661-5\">{\u00b6 63} \u201cIn my view and possibly in Dr. Howard\u2019s -view, Ms. Kolter has not yet reached MMI.</p>\n<p id=\"b661-6\">{If 64} \u201cI can not see Ms. Kolter returning to her job until her headaches are better controlled. Until these daily reminders of her ordeal are managed better she has more reason to be depressed. I also believe that these headaches are slowing her further recovery. * * *\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b661-7\">{\u00b6 65} 26. Following an August 31, 2001 hearing, a DHO issued an order denying Kohl\u2019s motion to terminate TTD compensation.</p>\n<p id=\"b661-8\">{\u00b6 66} 27. Kohl\u2019s administratively appealed the DHO\u2019s order of August 31, 2001. Following an October 31, 2001 hearing, an SHO issued an order affirming the DHO\u2019s order. The SHO\u2019s order states:</p>\n<p id=\"b661-9\">{\u00b6 67} \u201cThe Staff Hearing Officer has reviewed the evidence on file, including the employer\u2019s videotape evidence viewed at today\u2019s hearing, and finds that in her 08/31/2001 order, the District Hearing Officer correctly decided the issues presented.</p>\n<p id=\"b661-10\">{\u00b6 68} \u201cThe Staff Hearing Officer affirms the finding that the claimant has not yet experienced maximum medical improvement for the allowed psychological conditions of the claim, based on psychologist Bertner\u2019s 06/18/2001 and 08/30/2001 reports so indicating. The employer contends that Dr. Howard\u2019s 06/22/2001 report, finding maximum medical improvement of the allowed psychological conditions, is the more accurate assessment of the claimant\u2019s extent of disability on a psychological basis, particularly in light of the claimant\u2019s activities documented on the videotape. The Staff Hearing Officer acknowledges that on the videotape, the claimant appears to be carrying out normal activities of daily living in contrast to some of the indications in psychologist Bertner\u2019s reports. However, the videotape essentially shows isolated periods of activity over the course of a total of five days between 03/06/2001 and 10/11/2001, and the Staff Hearing Officer is not persuaded that such periods of activity are sufficient in quality or quantity to negate psychologist Bertner\u2019s opinion that maximum medical improvement has not yet occurred. The Staff Hearing Officer further notes that Dr. Howard\u2019s 06/22/2001 report also indicates that there had been improvement <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"632\">*632</page-number>in the claimant\u2019s condition subsequent to the time of his prior examination of the claimant in November of 2000[sic], at which time he had also indicated that maximum medical improvement had been reached. For these reasons, the Staff Hearing Officer finds that the claimant remains entitled to temporary total compensation.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b662-5\">{\u00b6 69} 28. On November 29, 2001, another SHO mailed an order refusing Kohl\u2019s administrative appeal from the SHO\u2019s order of October 31, 2001.</p>\n<p id=\"b662-6\">{\u00b6 70} 29. On February 15, 2002, relator, Kohl\u2019s Department Stores, filed this mandamus action.</p>\n<p id=\"b662-7\">Conclusions of Law</p>\n<p id=\"b662-8\">{\u00b6 71} The main issue is whether Mr. Bertner\u2019s reports of June 18, 2001 and August 30, 2001, constitute some evidence that the psychological conditions of the claim have not reached maximum medical improvement (\u201cMMI\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b662-9\">{\u00b6 72} Finding that Mr. Bertner\u2019s reports lack some evidence upon which the commission can rely to support its finding that the psychological conditions of the claim have not reached MMI, it is the magistrate\u2019s decision that this court issue a writ of mandamus, as more fully explained below.</p>\n<p id=\"b662-10\">{\u00b6 73} R.C. 4123.56(A) provides for the payment of TTD compensation. It also provides that payment shall not be made for the period \u201cwhen the employee has reached the maximum medical improvement.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b662-11\">{\u00b6 74} Supplementing the statute, Ohio Adm.Code 4121-3-32(A)(l) states:</p>\n<p id=\"b662-12\">{\u00b6 75} \u201c \u2018Maximum medical improvement\u2019 is a treatment plateau (static or well-stabilized) at which no fundamental functional or physiological change can be expected within reasonable medical probability in spite of continuing medical or rehabilitative procedures. A claimant may need supportive treatment to maintain this level of function.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b662-13\">{\u00b6 76} In <em>State ex rel. Eberhardt v. Flxible Corp. </em>(1994), 70 Ohio St.3d 649, 653, 640 N.E.2d 815, the court states:</p>\n<p id=\"b662-14\">{\u00b6 77} \u201c* * * Maximum medical improvement is equatable with the concept of permanence. * * * It \u2018relates solely to the perceived longevity of the condition at issue [and not to] the claimant\u2019s ability to perform the tasks involved in his former position of employment * * *. [It is defined] as a condition which will, \u201c* * * with reasonable probability, continue for an indefinite period of time without any present indication of recovery therefrom.\u201d \u2019 (Citation omitted.) <em>Vulcan Materials Co. v. Indus. Comm. </em>(1986), 25 Ohio St.3d 31, 33, 25 OBR 26, 27, 494 N.E.2d 1125, 1127. Thus, so long as the claimant\u2019s condition has not stabilized, and further medical improvement can be expected, TTD benefits are payable.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b663-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"633\">*633</page-number>{\u00b6 78} In his June 18, 2001 report, Mr. Bertner opines that MMI has not been obtained. He states that his opinion is based upon the \u201cslow recovery-process she exhibits and the intrusion of * * * neurological obstacles in her daily experience \u2014 confusion, migraine pain, unpredictability in her ability to execute the activities of daily life.\u201d In order to better assess and treat claimant\u2019s medical condition, Mr. Bertner asked claimant to request that Dr. Grayson be recognized as the physician of record. Mr. Bertner ends his June 18, 2001 report by stating that it has become clear to him that \u201cneurological pain as distinct from psychological trauma is a significant factor in her condition.\u201d Mr. Bertner recommends that Dr. Grayson become claimant\u2019s primary treating doctor with himself as secondary.</p>\n<p id=\"b663-5\">{\u00b6 79} In his August 30, 2001 report, immediately following his opinion that \u201cMs. Kolter has not yet reached MMI,\u201d Mr. Bertner states:</p>\n<p id=\"b663-6\">{\u00b6 80} \u201cI can not see Ms. Kolter returning to her job until her headaches are better controlled. Until these daily reminders of her ordeal are managed better she has more reason to be depressed. I also believe that these headaches are slowing her further recovery. * * *\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b663-7\">{\u00b6 81} The magistrate notes that three years earlier, on September 28, 1998, Mr. Bertner -wrote:</p>\n<p id=\"b663-8\">{\u00b6 82} \u201cI have consistently certified her as depressed since January, 1997 and this condition continues. The part of her dysfunction which I suspect is neurologically based is under Dr. Drake\u2019s supervision and treatment.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b663-9\">{\u00b6 83} As his June 18, 2001 and August 30, 2001 reports indicate, Mr. Bertner\u2019s opinion that the psychological conditions have not reached MMI is premised upon his belief that claimant\u2019s headaches can be better controlled with proper medical treatment. The problem is there is no time relevant competent medical evidence of record showing that claimant\u2019s headaches can be better controlled or that any of her neurological conditions can be improved.</p>\n<p id=\"b663-10\">{\u00b6 84} The record here indicates that Dr. Drake did not treat claimant beyond 1998. And, as Kohl\u2019s points out, there is no evidence from Dr. Grayson regarding assessment of the postconcussion syndrome or the headaches that are presumably symptomatic of that condition.</p>\n<p id=\"b663-11\">{\u00b6 85} Significantly, Mr. Bertner is not competent as a licensed psychologist to himself opine upon the likelihood of improvement of the postconcussion syndrome or the headaches that are the focus of his MMI opinion. <em>Baker v. Ohio Bur. of Workers\u2019 Comp. </em>(2000), 140 Ohio App.3d 766, 749 N.E.2d 333.</p>\n<p id=\"b663-12\">{\u00b6 86} In the absence of competent medical evidence to support his presumption that claimant\u2019s headaches or other neurological symptoms of postconcussion <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"634\">*634</page-number>syndrome can be better controlled, Mr. Bertner\u2019s MMI opinion is premised upon his own speculation as to the likelihood that the so-called \u201cneurological obstacles\u201d can be controlled or improved. See State <em>ex rel. Simon v. Indus. Comm. </em>(1994), 71 Ohio St.3d 186, 189, 642 N.E.2d 1096 (the court refers to Dr. House\u2019s comments on the probability and extent of further improvement as \u201cspeculative\u201d). As such, Mr. Bertner\u2019s opinion that the psychological conditions \u2014 posttraumatic stress disorder and major depression \u2014 have not reached MMI does not constitute some evidence upon which the commission can rely.</p>\n<p id=\"b664-5\">{\u00b6 87} Given that Mr. Bertner\u2019s MMI opinion is not competent evidence, he cannot competently certify TTD based upon his MMI conclusion.</p>\n<p id=\"b664-6\">{\u00b6 88} The commission\u2019s order does not address Dr. Grayson\u2019s C-84 certifying TTD beginning April 26, 2001. As previously noted, Dr. Grayson marked the \u201cNo\u201d box on the C-84 to indicate that the industrial injury was not at MMI. She then added \u201cNeeds To See Neuro.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b664-7\">{\u00b6 89} While Dr. Grayson is presumably competent to examine and opine upon the postconcussion syndrome, she has not indicated that she has done so. She recommends that the claimant see a neurologist for an evaluation of the neurological conditions. Thus, Dr. Grayson\u2019s opinion on MMI is also speculative because it assumes, without neurological evidentiary support, that claimant\u2019s psychological condition will improve if claimant is treated by a neurologist.</p>\n<p id=\"b664-8\">{\u00b6 90} Without a competent certification of TTD in the record, there is no evidence upon which the commission can order TTD compensation to continue. Thus, the commission should have granted Kohl\u2019s July 19, 2001 motion to terminate TTD compensation. The TTD compensation should have been terminated effective August 31, 2001, the date of the district level hearing on Kohl\u2019s motion. <em>State ex rel. Russell v. Indus. Comm. </em>(1998), 82 Ohio St.3d 516, 696 N.E.2d 1069.</p>\n<p id=\"b664-9\">{\u00b6 91} Accordingly, it is the magistrate\u2019s decision that this court issue a writ of mandamus ordering respondent Industrial Commission of Ohio to vacate the October 31, 2001 order of its SHO denying Kohl\u2019s motion to terminate TTD compensation, and to enter an order terminating TTD compensation effective the date of the August 31, 2001 DHO\u2019s hearing.</p>\n<p id=\"b664-10\">/s/ Kenneth W.
