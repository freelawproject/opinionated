After the trial court overruled his motion to suppress, Graley pleaded no contest to the tampering count and was found guilty. The state withdrew the possession count. The trial court sentenced Graley to five years of community control sanctions.</p>\n<p id=\"b678-10\">{\u00b6 2} On appeal, Graley advances an assignment of error and issue for review as follows:</p>\n<p id=\"b678-11\">{\u00b6 3} \u201cThe trial court erred by overruling defendant\u2019s motion to suppress the evidence recovered from the illegal seizure and search of his person.</p>\n<p id=\"b678-12\">{\u00b6 4} \u201cIssue Presented:</p>\n<p id=\"b678-13\">{\u00b6 5} \u201cDid the police violate Mr. Graley\u2019s Fourth Amendment rights to be free from unreasonable search and seizure when they forcefully made him remove what was in his mouth after being stopped for a traffic violation?\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b678-14\">{\u00b6 6} The question presented in this appeal is whether Dayton Police Officer David House had probable cause to seize and search Graley for crack cocaine by forcing Graley to spit out what Officer House believed was crack cocaine in Graley\u2019s mouth.</p>\n<p id=\"b678-15\">{\u00b6 7} Graley concedes that Officer House may have had information sufficient to justify an investigative detention but contends that this information did not rise to the level of probable cause to search him.</p>\n<p id=\"b678-16\">{\u00b6 8} The evidence at the suppression hearing was as follows.</p>\n<p id=\"b678-17\">{\u00b6 9} On September 5, 2001, Dayton police officers were conducting surveillance at Mount Crest Courts, a Dayton Metropolitan Housing Authority property. Mount Crest Courts is a \u201chigh drug,\u201d \u201chigh crime\u201d area about which the police <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"649\">*649</page-number>have received complaints of \u201copen air drug sales occurring in the parking lots\u201d and \u201cdrugs * * * being used and sold * * * throughout the apartment complex.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b679-5\">{\u00b6 10} Around 8:00 p.m., Officer Kevin Phillips observed a 1986 grey Mercury Cougar pull into a parking lot. The driver, who was the sole occupant of the car, was Graley. Graley made contact with another man in front of 608 Mount Crest. The two walked around the building to a courtyard. After about two minutes, Graley returned to his car and drove away.</p>\n<p id=\"b679-6\">{\u00b6 11} Earlier that evening, Officer Phillips had observed a similar incident involving another person identified as Eric Crouse, who had driven into the parking lot, and the same man who had been standing in front of 608 Mount Crest and who had accompanied Graley around the building. Officer Phillips believed that what he had observed on both occasions were drug transactions.</p>\n<p id=\"b679-7\">{\u00b6 12} Officer David House had followed Crouse as he left the parking lot and had arrested him in front of his residence for possession of crack cocaine.</p>\n<p id=\"b679-8\">{\u00b6 13} As he was returning to Mount Crest Apartments after concluding his activities with Crouse, Officer Phillips radioed information about a grey vehicle leaving Mount Crest Apartments. Based on radioed information from Officer Phillips and from Detective Larrimore, who was following Graley\u2019s car, Officer House was able to get behind Graley\u2019s car as it went south on Smithville Road. Graley made an unsignaled left turn off Smithville onto East Second Street, for which Officer House eventually issued a citation to Graley, and Officer House made a traffic stop. According to Officer House, what then occurred is as follows:</p>\n<p id=\"b679-9\">{\u00b6 14} \u201cQ. Okay. Once the car stopped, what did you do?</p>\n<p id=\"b679-10\">{\u00b6 15} \u201cA. I immediately stopped my cruiser behind it, exited and started to approach Mr. Graley\u2019s window.</p>\n<p id=\"b679-11\">{\u00b6 16} \u201cQ. So did you approach the passenger or the driver side?</p>\n<p id=\"b679-12\">{\u00b6 17} \u201cA. The driver side.</p>\n<p id=\"b679-13\">{\u00b6 18} \u201cQ. Okay. Did you observe anything while you were approaching the driver side window?</p>\n<p id=\"b679-14\">{\u00b6 19} \u201cA. Yes. As I got alongside of his windows, I could see Mr. Graley bring his right hand up and place something in his mouth.</p>\n<p id=\"b679-15\">{\u00b6 20} \u201cQ. Okay.</p>\n<p id=\"b679-16\">{\u00b6 21} \u201cA. However, I could not see the object or see anything in his hand at that time.</p>\n<p id=\"b679-17\">{\u00b6 22} \u201cQ. All right. What did you do next?</p>\n<p id=\"b680-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"650\">*650</page-number>{\u00b6 23} \u201cA. Uh. Mr. Graley\u2019s window was down and immediately as I stepped alongside Mr. Graley\u2019s window, I also observed Mr. Graley move his tongue into his left cheek.</p>\n<p id=\"b680-5\">{\u00b6 24} \u201cQ. Okay. After you observed that behavior, what\u2019d you do next?</p>\n<p id=\"b680-6\">{\u00b6 25} \u201cA. Uh. I very frankly \u2014 I asked Mr. Graley \u2014 the first thing I said to him was: \u2018Sir, was that, in fact, a piece of crack cocaine that you just stuck in your mouth?\u2019</p>\n<p id=\"b680-7\">{\u00b6 26} \u201cQ. And did he make any responses?</p>\n<p id=\"b680-8\">{\u00b627} \u201cA. Uh. Mr. Graley mumbled keeping his mouth and lips pursed together: \u2018No.\u2019</p>\n<p id=\"b680-9\">{\u00b6 28} \u201cQ. Okay. What happened next?</p>\n<p id=\"b680-10\">{\u00b629} \u201cA. At that point in time, based on the previous arrest and the encounter of Mr. Crouse, uh, the surveillance of Officer Phillips, uh, and my experience knowing that crack cocaine is very oftenly [sic] hidden and destroyed by the mouth, uh, when contacted by police, uh\u2014</p>\n<p id=\"b680-11\">{\u00b6 30} \u201cQ. Let me ask you this: You said in your experience \u2014 in your ten years as a police officer, about how many times have you observed someone put crack in their mouth and try to destroy it?</p>\n<p id=\"b680-12\">{\u00b6 31} \u201cA. A few hundred easily.</p>\n<p id=\"b680-13\">{\u00b6 32} \u201cQ. Okay. And the actions of the Defendant, were those similar to those hundred times that you observed people trying to destroy the crack cocaine?</p>\n<p id=\"b680-14\">{\u00b6 33} \u201cA. Yes, it was.</p>\n<p id=\"b680-15\">{\u00b6 34} \u201cQ. Okay. All right. So you at this point think he\u2019s either chewing it or doing something to it in his mouth. WHiat do you do next?</p>\n<p id=\"b680-16\">{\u00b6 35} \u201cA. At that point in time, I \u2014 I believed that he was simply concealing it.</p>\n<p id=\"b680-17\">{\u00b6 36} \u201cQ. Okay.</p>\n<p id=\"b680-18\">{\u00b6 37} \u201cA. And so I asked Mr. Graley to step out of the vehicle, which he complied.</p>\n<p id=\"b680-19\">{\u00b6 38} \u201cQ. And once he was outside the vehicle, what happened?</p>\n<p id=\"b680-20\">{\u00b6 39} \u201cA. As he stepped out of the vehicle, I placed my hand underneath his chin and I asked Mr. Graley to open his mouth.</p>\n<p id=\"b680-21\">{\u00b6 40} \u201cQ. The\u2014</p>\n<p id=\"b680-22\">{\u00b6 41} \u201cA. The reason I placed my hand underneath his chin was in fact, quite often when you ask individuals that and they realize that basically it\u2019s discovered, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"651\">*651</page-number>the first reaction is to swallow or to start chewing the item. And I placed my hand close by in case he did attempt to start chewing that I could try to prevent that.</p>\n<p id=\"b681-5\">{\u00b6 42} \u201cMr. Graley, in fact, though, when I asked him to open his mouth, he did, in fact, open his mouth. However, he tilted his head backwards to where I still could not see into his mouth. At this point in time, I asked him to lower his chin so that I could see into his mouth. And then after this second request, Mr. Graley did, in fact, start manipulating the object in his cheek and start to chew.</p>\n<p id=\"b681-6\">{\u00b6 43} \u201cQ. Okay. Once you observed that behavior, what did you do?</p>\n<p id=\"b681-7\">{\u00b6 44} \u201cA. My left hand was still underneath of Ms chin. I reached up with my right hand behind his head and I ordered him to the ground, saying: \u2018Get on the ground, get on the ground.\u2019 And I took him to the ground. At that point in time, using my thumb and fingers of my left hand, I pinched his cheeks and jaw together underneath his teeth so that he couldn\u2019t chew.</p>\n<p id=\"b681-8\">{\u00b6 45} \u201cAnd I \u2014 laying on the pavement at this time, I continually ordered him to start spitting \u2014 to spit whatever he had in his mouth onto the ground.</p>\n<p id=\"b681-9\">{\u00b6 46} \u201cQ. Did he comply with that order?</p>\n<p id=\"b681-10\">{\u00b6 47} \u201cA. After about, I would say five to ten seconds, he did, in fact, spit.</p>\n<p id=\"b681-11\">{\u00b6 48} \u201c* * *</p>\n<p id=\"b681-12\">{\u00b6 49} \u201c* * *. At that time I observed a piece of white chunky material come out of his mouth and land on the payment [sic], I would say a distance of probably maybe eight inches from his mouth.</p>\n<p id=\"b681-13\">{\u00b6 50} \u201cQ. Okay. And to be clear, that substance was not there prior?</p>\n<p id=\"b681-14\">{\u00b6 51} \u201cA. No, it was not.</p>\n<p id=\"b681-15\">{\u00b6 52} \u201cQ. Okay. And could you \u2014 you described it as a white chunky material. In your experience as a police officer, what did you believe that to be?</p>\n<p id=\"b681-16\">{\u00b6 53} \u201cA. Crack cocaine.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b681-17\">{\u00b6 54} Thereafter, Officer House retrieved fragments of what Graley had spit out from the sidewalk and Graley\u2019s left hand. These fragments were found to be crack cocaine. During the takedown, Graley sustained an abrasion on his right cheekbone.</p>\n<p id=\"b681-18\">{\u00b6 55} In our judgment, the traffic stop was legitimate, and exigent circumstances existed for a warrantless search, and these issues are not open to question. Officer House observed a traffic violation, and Graley attempting to dispose of what Officer House believed to be crack cocaine.</p>\n<p id=\"b682-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"652\">*652</page-number>{\u00b6 56} The central issue in this appeal is whether Officer House entertained \u201ca reasonable ground for belief\u2019 that Graley possessed crack cocaine when he ordered Graley to open his mouth. <em>State v. Moore </em>(2000), 90 Ohio St.3d 47, 49, 734 N.E.2d 804. We conclude that he did.</p>\n<p id=\"b682-5\">{\u00b6 57} He and Officer Phillips had been conducting surveillance in a high-drug activity area. He had just arrested Eric Crouse for possession of crack cocaine after Crouse had been involved in a brief encounter with the man in front of 608 Mount Crest. As he was returning to the Mount Crest Apartments, he was alerted by Officer Phillips to the 1986 grey Mercury Cougar, whose sole occupant had just been observed by Officer Phillips \u2014 who had also observed the Crouse encounter \u2014 engaged in a brief encounter with the same man in front of 608 Mount Crest that Crouse had encountered.</p>\n<p id=\"b682-6\">{\u00b6 58} Upon approaching Graley, Officer House observed Graley put something in his mouth, which he knew from experience was a place where drugs are \u201chidden and destroyed.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b682-7\">{\u00b6 59} Finally, we find no constitutional infirmity in the manner in which the police compelled Graley to expel the crank cocaine from his mouth. See <em>State v. Fisher </em>(Feb. 13, 1996), Allen App. 1-93-71, 1996 WL 65487, citing <em>Schmerber v. California </em>(1966), 384 U.S. 757, 86 S.Ct. 1826, 16 L.Ed.2d 908.</p>\n<p id=\"b682-8\">{\u00b6 60} The assignment of error is overruled.</p>\n<p id=\"b682-9\">{\u00b6 61} The judgment will be affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b682-10\">Judgment affirmed.</p>\n<judges id=\"b682-11\">Fain, P.J., and Grady, J., concur.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
