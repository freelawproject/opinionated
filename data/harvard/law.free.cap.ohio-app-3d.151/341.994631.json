First, he contends that the trial court erred in imposing a prison sentence upon revoking his community control. Second, he asserts that the trial court erred in imposing-consecutive sentences following the community control violation.</p>\n<p id=\"b372-7\">{\u00b6 3} The present appeal stems from Bradley\u2019s guilty pleas to charges of theft and failure to appear. Following a hearing, the trial court sentenced him to three years of community control with several conditions, including the completion of a treatment program at Nova House. Bradley subsequently failed to complete the Nova House program, and the state sought revocation of community control. After conducting a hearing, the trial court revoked community control and imposed the consecutive prison sentences set forth above. Bradley then filed a timely notice of appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b372-8\">{\u00b6 4} In his first assignment of error, Bradley argues that the trial court lacked the authority to impose any prison term upon revoking community control. In support, he notes that the trial court failed to inform him, at the time of his original sentencing, of the specific prison term that he would face for a community control violation. According to Bradley, if a sentencing court wishes to reserve the option of imprisonment for a community control violation, it must pick a specific prison term from the statutory range and inform a defendant of that specific term when community control is imposed. If a sentencing court fails to do so, Bradley argues, it is prohibited from later imposing a prison sentence for a community control violation.</p>\n<p id=\"b372-9\">{\u00b6 5} Upon review, we find Bradley\u2019s first assignment of error to be persuasive. As we recognized in <em>State v. Carter </em>(1999), 136 Ohio App.3d 367, 368, 736 N.E.2d 915, \u201c[pjursuant to R.C. 2929.19(B)(5),<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> when a trial court sentences a defendant to community control sanctions, the court is required to advise the defendant that if the conditions are violated, the court may impose * * * a prison <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"343\">*343</page-number>term. Further, the court is required to advise the defendant of the specific prison term that will be imposed for violation of community control sanctions.\u201d (Footnote added.) This specific prison term must be within the authorized statutory range. Id. If a defendant thereafter violates the terms of his community control, R.C. 2929.15(B) mandates that the trial court \u201cshall not exceed the prison term specified in the notice provided to the offender at the sentencing hearing\u201d pursuant to R.C. 2929.19(B)(5).</p>\n<p id=\"b373-5\">{\u00b6 6} In the present case, the state concedes the trial court\u2019s failure to identify, at the time of Bradley\u2019s original sentencing, a specific term of imprisonment that it would impose for a community control violation. Nevertheless, the state suggests that the record demonstrates substantial compliance with this statutory requirement. In support, the state notes that the trial court informed Bradley, during his plea hearing, of the maximum prison sentence that could be imposed for each count. Bradley also acknowledged, during the plea hearing, that he could be \u201csent to prison\u201d for a community control violation. In addition, the state notes that the trial court informed Bradley, during his sentencing hearing, that if the Nova House would not accept him, then he \u201cmost likely\u201d would go to prison.</p>\n<p id=\"b373-6\">{\u00b6 7} In light of the foregoing facts, the state argues that Bradley had notice of \u201cthe time that could be served if he violated community control conditions.\u201d As a result, the state urges us to find substantial compliance with R.C. 2929.19(B)(5), despite the trial court\u2019s failure to inform Bradley, during the first sentencing hearing or in its sentencing entry, of the specific prison term that he would face for a community control violation.</p>\n<p id=\"b373-7\">{\u00b6 8} Upon review, we find the state\u2019s argument to be unpersuasive. As an initial matter, it is debatable whether substantial compliance with R.C. 2929.19(B)(5) is sufficient. See <em>State v. Grodhaus </em>(2001), 144 Ohio App.3d 615, 761 N.E.2d 80 (reasoning that R.C. 2929.19[B][5] means what it says and should be enforced exactly as written); <em>State v. Giles, </em>Hamilton App. No. C-010582, 2002-Ohio-3297, 2002 WL 1393559, \u00b610 (concluding that \u201cin the usual case, literal compliance with R.C. 2929.19(B)(5) is required as a precondition to imposing a prison sentence for a violation of community-control sanctions\u201d); but, see, <em>State v. Mynhier </em>(2001), 146 Ohio App.3d 217, 224, 765 N.E.2d 917 (finding substantial compliance with R.C. 2929.19[B][5], over a strong dissent, where the trial court informed the defendant, at his plea hearing and in its judgment entry, of the maximum prison sentence that he could receive for a community control violation, but not the specific sentence that he would receive).</p>\n<p id=\"b373-8\">{\u00b6 9} In any event, assuming arguendo that less than strict compliance with R.C. 2929.19(B)(5) may suffice, the record in the present case fails to establish even substantial compliance. As noted above, the statute provides that when a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"344\">*344</page-number>trial court imposes community control and wishes to reserve the right to impose a prison sentence for a violation, it \u201cshall indicate the specific prison term that may be imposed as a sanction for the violation[.]\u201d In addition, as we have recognized, R.C. 2929.15(B) mandates that the trial court \u201cshall not exceed the prison term specified in the notice provided to the offender at the sentencing hearing\u201d pursuant to R.C. 2929.19(B)(5). Thus, as we noted in <em>Carter, </em>a trial court may sentence a defendant to prison for a violation of community control only if he was informed, during the sentencing hearing, of the specific term to be imposed for the violation. <em>Carter, </em>136 Ohio App.3d at 369, 736 N.E.2d 915.</p>\n<p id=\"b374-5\">{\u00b6 10} In the present case, the trial court merely informed Bradley, during his plea hearing, of the minimum and maximum prison sentence that he could receive for each count. At that time, he also acknowledged that he could be \u201csent to prison\u201d for a community control violation. At no time, however, did the trial court ever inform him of the specific prison sentence that it would impose for a community control violation. In our view, informing a defendant of the statutory sentencing range in a plea hearing and telling him that he could go to prison for violating community control do not constitute substantial compliance with R.C. 2929.19(B)(5), which requires a trial court to identify the <em>specific sentence </em>that will be imposed for a community control violation.</p>\n<p id=\"b374-6\">{\u00b6 11} In reaching this conclusion, we observe that finding substantial compliance when a trial court fails to identify a specific sentence as required by R.C. 2929.19(B)(5) would render R.C. 2929.15(B) meaningless. As noted above, R.C. 2929.15(B) states that upon revoking community control and imposing a term of incarceration, a trial court shall not exceed the prison term specified in the notice given to the offender under R.C. 2929.19(B)(5). If we were to read R.C. 2929.19(B)(5) as not really requiring a trial court to give notice of the specific prison term that may be imposed as a sanction for a community control violation, then R.C. 2929.15(B), as written, would be impossible to enforce.</p>\n<p id=\"b374-7\">{\u00b6 12} As Judge Painter of the First District aptly recognized in his dissent in <em>Mynhier, </em>\u201cR.C. 2929.15(B) clearly contemplates a distinction between telling a defendant of a specific term and telling a defendant of a potential maximum term. If it meant that notifying the defendant of the maximum term was sufficient the above language [stating that the term imposed \u2018shall not exceed the prison term specified in the notice given at sentencing] would be superfluous. The legislature\u2019s intent was obviously this: the defendant has to be told, \u2018Comply with the terms of the community control sanctions or you go to jail for ___\u2019 Thus, by saying that, if the defendant violates, the most that can be given is what was originally specified, the legislature meant \u2018a deal is a deal \u2014 mess up and here\u2019s what happens.\u2019 Had the legislature wished the trial court to merely inform a defendant of the potential maximum, it could have said so. It did not \u2014 it said <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"345\">*345</page-number>just the opposite.\u201d <em>Mynhier, </em>146 Ohio App.3d at 226, 765 N.E.2d 917 (Painter, J., dissenting).</p>\n<p id=\"b375-4\">{\u00b6 13} Notably, in <em>Giles </em>another panel of the First District recently adopted Judge Painter\u2019s dissent, rejected the majority position in Mynhier;<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> and held that the \u201cmanifest purpose\u201d of the foregoing statutory language \u201cis to inform the offender of the actual, specific sentence that will be imposed if the court chooses to impose incarceration, not the statutory range of sentences that may be imposed.\u201d <em>Giles, </em>supra, 2002-Ohio-3297, at \u00b6 9, quoting with approval <em>Mynhier, </em>146 Ohio App.3d at 226, 765 N.E.2d 917 (Painter, J., dissenting); accord <em>Gro-dhaus, </em>144 Ohio App.3d at 618, 761 N.E.2d 80 (concluding that \u201cmerely informing an offender of the maximum prison term does not satisfy the requirements of R.C. 2929.19[B][5]\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b375-5\">{\u00b6 14} Based on the reasoning and citation of authority set forth above, we hold that the trial court erred in sentencing Bradley to terms of imprisonment upon the revocation of his community control. Prior to revoking community control, the trial court never informed him of the specific sentence that he would face for a community control violation, as required by R.C. 2929.19(B)(5). As a result, the trial court lacked the authority to impose any prison sentence as a sanction for Bradley\u2019s community control violation. Accordingly, we sustain his first assignment of error, reverse the judgment of the Champaign County Court of Common Pleas, and remand this cause for resentencing on the community control violation.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b375-6\">Judgment reversed and cause remanded for resentencing.</p>\n<judges id=\"b375-7\">Wolff and Grady, JJ., concur.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b372-10\">. {\u00b6 a} R.C. 2929.19(B)(5) provides:</p>\n<p id=\"b372-11\">{\u00b6 b} \"If the sentencing court determines at the sentencing hearing that a community control sanction should be imposed and the court is not prohibited from imposing a community control sanction, the court shall impose a community control sanction.
