On appeal, appellant contends that the trial court\u2019s finding was against the manifest weight of the evidence and that the court failed to consider the affirmative defense of parental discipline. We find that the actions forming the basis of the trial court\u2019s decision are not supported by the record and that any additional action taken by appellant against his stepdaughter falls within the confines of reasonable and proper parental discipline, an affirmative defense to the charges against him. Consequently, we must reverse the judgment of the trial court.</p>\n<p id=\"b448-11\">{\u00b6 2} Facts and procedural history pertinent to the issues raised on appeal are as follows. On January 5, 2002, appellant arrived home, finding his two daughters and two stepdaughters engaged in a disagreement that, according to house rules, had escalated to a prohibited level. Appellant then began to argue with his wife concerning her failure to control the children\u2019s behavior. Thereafter, appellant raised his voice towards the children, which \u201cscared\u201d his stepdaughter, Autumn.</p>\n<p id=\"b448-12\">{\u00b6 3} Appellant then resumed speaking to his wife about the situation. During their conversation, Autumn entered the room and picked up the telephone to call her biological father. However, when appellant observed this, she put the phone down and ran into another room. Appellant then picked up the phone and threw it against the wall. While Autumn initially testified that the phone hit the wall two feet from her, she later recanted and admitted that her back was to the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"419\">*419</page-number>phone and did not know how close the phone came to her. She further testified that she did not believe that appellant was trying to hit her with the phone and that the throw did not seem violent.</p>\n<p id=\"b449-5\">{\u00b6 4} Subsequently, appellant left the home in an agitated state, and prior to closing the front door, he commented: \u201cI want to bash your heads in the wall.\u201d Autumn stated that she did not believe that appellant was going to actually follow through with his statements, and the evidence shows that appellant has never used physical force to discipline the children.</p>\n<p id=\"b449-6\">{\u00b6 5} As stipulated by the parties, appellant stands in loco parentis with respect to his stepchildren.</p>\n<p id=\"b449-7\">{\u00b6 6} At the close of the state\u2019s case in chief, appellant made a Crim.R. 29 motion for acquittal, which was denied by the trial court. Thereafter, the court found appellant guilty of disorderly conduct. The trial court\u2019s decision was based upon appellant throwing the telephone and his statements as he left the residence. From this decision, appellant appeals, asserting three assignments of error for our review. Pursuant to App.R. 9(D), the parties opted to submit an agreed statement of the case, which was signed by appellant, the state, and the trial judge, in lieu of filing a transcript of the proceedings before the trial court.</p>\n<p id=\"b449-8\">{\u00b6 7} For purposes of brevity and clarity, we will discuss appellant\u2019s first two assignments together. Additionally,, because the first two assignments are dispositive of this appeal, we will not address the third.</p>\n<p id=\"b449-9\">Assignment of Error I</p>\n<p id=\"b449-10\">{\u00b6 8} \u201cThe trial court erred when it failed to consider the affirmative defense of parental discipline of a minor child.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b449-11\">Assignment of Error II</p>\n<p id=\"b449-12\">{\u00b6 9} \u201cThe trial court erred in finding Appellant guilty of disorderly conduct in violation of Ohio Revised Code \u00a7 2917.11(A)(1), as the judgment is against the manifest weight of the evidence.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b449-13\">{\u00b6 10} At the outset, we note that the state has failed to file an appellate brief in this matter. Therefore, according to App.R. 18(C), \u201cin determining the appeal, [this] court may accept the appellant\u2019s statement of the facts and issues as correct and reverse the judgment if appellant\u2019s brief reasonably appears to sustain such action.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b449-14\">{\u00b6 11} In his second assignment of error, appellant avers that the trial court\u2019s finding is against the manifest weight of the evidence. \u201cWeight of the evidence concerns \u2018the inclination of the greater amount of credible evidence, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"420\">*420</page-number>offered in a trial, to support one side of the issue rather than the other.\u2019\u201d<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> In making a determination on this issue, an appellate court \u201c[reviews] the entire record, weighs the evidence and all reasonable inferences, considers the credibility of witnesses and determines whether in resolving conflicts in the evidence, the [factfinder] clearly lost its way and created such a manifest miscarriage of justice that the conviction must be reversed.\u201d<footnotemark>1</footnotemark>\n<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b450-5\">{\u00b6 12} Appellant was found guilty of disorderly conduct, in violation of R.C. 2917.11(A)(1), which states that \u201c[n]o person shall recklessly cause inconvenience, annoyance, or alarm to another by * * * [e]ngaging in fighting, in threatening harm to persons or property, or in violent or turbulent behavior.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b450-6\">{\u00b6 13} In this case, the trial court found a violation of R.C. 2917.11(A)(1) based upon a series of actions that are not supported by the evidence. In doing so, the trial court held the following: \u201cThe defendant, who exclaimed that he was \u2018going to bash your head in,\u2019 then threw the phone in [Autumn\u2019s] direction. The Court finds this exclamation, in conjunction with the thrown phone, is sufficient to constitute inconvenience, annoyance, or alarm to Autumn.\u201d However, the evidence before this court reveals that the act of throwing the phone was temporarily disconnected from and independent of the statements made as he walked out of the residence. Moreover, the evidence indicates that Autumn\u2019s back was turned when the phone was thrown,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> and she believed neither that appellant was trying to hit her with the phone nor that his actions seemed violent. In addition, Autumn testified that she did not think that appellant would \u201cbash [her] head[ ] in.\u201d While the evidence supports that Autumn was scared when appellant raised his voice towards her, whether such action would constitute a violation of R.C. 2917.11(A)(1) is dubious at best.</p>\n<p id=\"b450-7\">{\u00b6 14} Additionally, the Ohio Supreme Court has recognized that proper and reasonable parental discipline is an affirmative defense, available to a parent faced with possible conviction for actions incurred while disciplining a child.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> According to the Revised Code, an affirmative defense is one \u201cinvolving an excuse or justification peculiarly within the knowledge of the accused, on <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"421\">*421</page-number>which he can fairly be required to adduce supporting evidence.\u201d<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> As stated by R.C. 2901.05(A), \u201c[t]he burden of going forward with the evidence of an affirmative defense, and the burden of proof, by a preponderance of the evidence, for an affirmative defense, is upon the accused.\u201d In <em>State v. Suchomski, </em>the Ohio Supreme Court recognized that a parent is not prohibited from disciplining his or her own child.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> Rather, the only prohibition is that \u201ca parent may not cause \u2018physical harm\u2019 as that term is defined in R.C. 2901.01(C). \u2018Physical harm\u2019 is defined as \u2018any injury[.]\u2019 \u2018Injury\u2019 is defined * * * as \u2018* * * [t]he invasion of any <em>legally protected interest </em>of another.\u2019 A child does not have any legally protected interest which is invaded by proper and reasonable parental discipline.\u201d<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> \u201cProper\u201d and \u201creasonable\u201d have been defined as \u201csuitable or appropriate\u201d and \u201cnot extreme or excessive,\u201d respectively.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b451-5\">{\u00b6 15} The evidence herein supports that appellant raised his voice at his stepdaughter in light of her breaking the house rules. Clearly, without any physical harm, the discipline meted out by appellant fell within the established parameters of proper and reasonable parental discipline. For these reasons, we find that the trial court\u2019s judgment was against the manifest weight of the evidence and any further action taken by appellant, even if construed as a violation of R.C. 2917.11, fell within the confines of reasonable and proper parental discipline.</p>\n<p id=\"b451-6\">{\u00b6 16} Accordingly, appellant\u2019s first and second assignments of error are sustained.</p>\n<p id=\"b451-7\">{\u00b6 17} Having found error prejudicial to appellant herein in the particulars assigned and argued, the judgment of the trial court is hereby reversed and the cause remanded for further proceedings in accordance with this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b451-8\">Judgment reversed and cause remanded.</p>\n<judges id=\"b451-9\">Shaw and Thomas F.
