The trial court\u2019s judgment <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"374\">*374</page-number>disqualified Ellen Simon, Smith\u2019s attorney. Smith assigns the following as error for our review:</p>\n<p id=\"b404-4\">{\u00b6 2} \u201cThe trial court erred and abused its discretion when it found that counsel violated Disciplinary Rule 7-104 and when it disqualified Plaintiffs counsel on that basis.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b404-5\">{\u00b6 3} Having reviewed the record and pertinent law, we reverse the trial court\u2019s decision and remand for proceedings consistent with this opinion. The apposite facts follow.</p>\n<p id=\"b404-6\">{\u00b6 4} Smith was a contracted employee of the Clinic from July 1, 1998, through June 30, 2000. The Clinic opted not to renew Smith\u2019s employment contract following a department committee meeting chaired by Dr. Robert Petras and attended by Dr. John Goldblum, Dr. Bruce Sebek, and others.</p>\n<p id=\"b404-7\">{\u00b6 5} Following termination of her employment, Smith retained Simon. Prior to filing a lawsuit, Simon interviewed several Clinic employees, including Drs. Goldblum and Sebek, without informing the Clinic. Subsequently, Smith sued the Clinic and Dr. Petras in the court of common pleas alleging wrongful termination, inter alia.</p>\n<p id=\"b404-8\">{\u00b6 6} Upon learning of these interviews, the Clinic moved to disqualify Simon for improperly contacting its employees in violation of the Code of Professional Responsibility\u2019s DR 7-104.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> On February 5, 2002, the trial court disqualified Simon. This appeal followed from that final appealable order.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b404-9\">{\u00b6 7} In her sole assigned error, Smith argues that the trial court abused its discretion by disqualifying Simon. Because Simon\u2019s conduct, which formed the basis for disqualification, did not prejudice the Clinic, we agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b404-10\">{\u00b6 8} A trial court possesses \u201cinherent power to regulate the practice before it and protect the integrity of its proceedings.\u201d<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> This power extends to overseeing the ethical conduct of attorneys as well as the dismissal or disqualification of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"375\">*375</page-number>attorneys who cannot, or will not, comply with the Code of Professional Responsibility when representing a client.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b405-4\">{\u00b6 9} We will not disturb a trial court\u2019s ruling on such matters absent an abuse of discretion.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> \u201cThe term discretion itself involves the idea of choice, of an exercise of the will, of a determination made between competing considerations. In order to have an abuse of that choice, the result must be so palpably and grossly violative of fact or logic that it evidences not the exercise of will but the perversity of will, not the exercise of judgment but the defiance of judgment, not the exercise of reason but instead passion or bias.\u201d<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b405-5\">{\u00b6 10} Despite the broad power vested in a trial court to supervise members of the bar practicing before it, disqualification is a drastic measure which a trial court should exercise only when absolutely necessary, such as \u201cin the event of truly egregious misconduct which is likely to infect future proceedings.\u201d<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> A violation of a professional ethics rule \u201cdoes not automatically necessitate disqualification of the attorney involved.\u201d<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> Rather, courts are uniform in holding that disqualification is improper where the moving party demonstrated a Disciplinary Rule violation but failed to demonstrate correlative prejudice.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b405-6\">{\u00b6 11} When determining whether a court properly disqualified an attorney due to a violation of DR 7-104, a reviewing court must consider \u201c 1) the client\u2019s interest in being represented by counsel of its own choice; 2) the opposing party\u2019s interest in a trial free from prejudice due to disclosures of confidential information; and 3) the public\u2019s interest in the scrupulous administration of justice.\u2019 \u201d<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b405-7\">{\u00b6 12} Here, the trial court determined that Simon sank below the minimum level of conduct by interviewing several Clinic employees, including Drs. Gold-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"376\">*376</page-number>blum and Sebek, without first notifying the Clime. On appeal, the Clinic argues that the trial court properly granted summary judgment, based upon Simon\u2019s alleged violation of DR 7-104 and the risk of some unnamed prejudice; however, because the record does not demonstrate the likelihood of prejudice, we conclude that the trial court erred.</p>\n<p id=\"b406-4\">{\u00b6 13} The Clinic asserts that the ex parte interviews tainted the proceedings so that a fair trial is improbable because whatever information is gleaned from those interviews is necessarily part of Simon\u2019s memory. It may be true that Simon cannot fully dismiss the substance of the interviews; however, obtaining information, per se, does not result in prejudice. Rather, the key inquiry is whether the information will likely prevent the fair administration of justice.</p>\n<p id=\"b406-5\">{\u00b6 14} The Clinic answers this question affirmatively and asserts that the mere risk of a tainted trial warrants Simon\u2019s disqualification. In support of this proposition, the Clinic refers us to <em>Royal Indemn. Co. v. J.C. Penney Co.</em><footnotemark><em>11</em></footnotemark><em> </em>and <em>Maple Hts. v. Redi Car Wash.</em><footnotemark><em>12</em></footnotemark><em> </em>We determine that the Clinic has misapplied these cases.</p>\n<p id=\"b406-6\">{\u00b6 15} In <em>Royal Indemn. Co., </em>the Supreme Court stated, \u201cThe most common basis for trial court disqualification of an attorney is the risk of a tainted trial due to an actual or potential conflict of interest.\u201d<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> While the Supreme Court acknowledged that risk of a tainted trial is grounds for disqualifying an attorney, it did not hold that any degree of risk warrants disqualification. In fact, the holding in <em>Royal Indemn. Co. </em>did not turn on the presence of risk; rather, the court merely stated dicta in leading to its conclusion that grounds other than risk may warrant attorney disqualification.</p>\n<p id=\"b406-7\">{\u00b6 16} In <em>Redi Car Wash, </em>we cited <em>Royal Indemn. Co. </em>and stated, \u201cUnder appropriate circumstances, an attorney may be disqualified from continued participation in ongoing litigation in the event of <em>truly egregious misconduct which is likely to infect future proceedings </em>* * *.\u201d<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> In its zeal, the Clinic wrongly equates this standard with, as it stated, <em>\u201ceven a risk </em>of a tainted trial due to the attorney\u2019s unethical misconduct.\u201d<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> These positions are clearly not analogous.</p>\n<p id=\"b407-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"377\">*377</page-number>{\u00b6 17} Upon reviewing this record, including the deposed testimonies of Drs. Goldblum and Sebek, we find no indication that Simon\u2019s conduct will likely prejudice the underlying proceedings. The Clinic goes to great lengths to establish that Simon violated DR 7-104; however, the Clinic fails to demonstrate that Simon caused correlative prejudice justifying her disqualification. Conduct amounting to a Disciplinary Rule violation does not necessarily correspond to circumstances warranting disqualification. We emphasize this point: absent prejudice, a violation of DR 7-104 does not necessitate the extraordinary remedy of disqualification.</p>\n<p id=\"b407-5\">{\u00b6 18} As we find no indication of prejudice, Smith\u2019s interest in being represented by the counsel of her choice and the scrupulous administration of justice compel us to reverse Simon\u2019s disqualification. Accordingly, Smith\u2019s assigned error has merit. We reverse the trial court\u2019s disqualification order and remand this matter for proceedings consistent with this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b407-6\">Judgment reversed and cause remanded.</p>\n<judges id=\"b407-7\">Anne L.

The first is whether disqualification is an appropriate sanction for violation of DR 7-104 in this case, and the second is, assuming it is an appropriate sanction, what is the appropriate standard of review?</p>\n<p id=\"b407-11\">{\u00b6 20} I recognize that an attorney\u2019s violation of a professional ethics rule does not automatically warrant a disqualification of the attorney; however, the paramount consideration in our review of a case of this distinction, I believe, is the inherent power of the court to protect the integrity of its proceedings. <em>Maple Hts. v. Redi Car Wash </em>(1988), 51 Ohio App.3d 60, 61, 554 N.E.2d 929, citing <em>Royal Indemn. v. J.C. Penney Co. </em>(1986), 27 Ohio St.3d 31, 34, 27 OBR 447, 501 N.E.2d 617. As the court stated in <em>Royal Indemn.:</em></p>\n<p id=\"b407-12\">{\u00b6 21} \u201cAppellants * * * contend that a trial court may only disqualify an attorney from continued participation in ongoing litigation where that attorney\u2019s continued participation might unfairly affect the outcome of the litigation. This contention too narrowly restricts the inherent power of the court to protect the integrity of its proceedings. The most common basis for trial court disqualification of an attorney is the risk of a tainted trial due to an actual or potential conflict of interest. <em>Glueck v. Jonathan Logan, Inc. </em>(C.A.2, 1981), 653 F.2d 746, at 748. However, this is not the only ground for disqualification. The trial <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"378\">*378</page-number>court\u2019s power to protect its pending proceedings includes the authority to dismiss an attorney who cannot, or will not, take part in them with a reasonable degree of propriety. <em>Laughlin v. Eicher </em>(D.D.C.1944), 145 F.2d 700. Similarly, attorney disqualification can be warranted in cases of truly egregious misconduct which is likely to infect future proceedings.\u201d Id., 27 Ohio St.3d at 34, 27 OBR 447, 501 N.E.2d 617.</p>\n<p id=\"b408-5\">{\u00b6 22} Furthermore, as this court has emphasized, \u201c[a] trial court has wide discretion in the exercise of its duty to supervise members of the bar appearing before it, and the court\u2019s ruling will not be disturbed absent a showing that the court abused its discretion.\u201d <em>Redi Car Wash, </em>51 Ohio App.3d at 61, 554 N.E.2d 929, citing <em>Royal Indemn., </em>27 Ohio St.3d at 35, 27 OBR 447, 501 N.E.2d 617.</p>\n<p id=\"b408-6\">{\u00b6 23} Thus, my view here is that unless the court has abused its discretion, i.e., acted arbitrarily, capriciously, or unreasonably, in disqualifying the attorney, our court must affirm the court\u2019s ruling. Because the record here does not reflect an abuse of discretion by the court, we should defer to its exercise of power in disqualifying the attorney, in an effort to protect the integrity of its proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b408-7\">{\u00b6 24} For these reasons, I respectfully dissent.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
