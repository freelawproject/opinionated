We rely on the plain language of the insurance policy in question and find no coverage, so we affirm the trial court\u2019s grant of summary judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b709-8\">{\u00b6 2} On August 2 1999, the motorcycles operated by Steven B. Blackwell and appellant, Eric Weyda, collided, causing Weyda personal injuries. Weyda sued Blackwell and sought damages from Blackwell and various insurers, including appellee, Pacific Employer\u2019s Insurance Company. Weyda claimed that he was entitled to recover benefits from the uninsured-motorist provision of the business automobile policy Pacific had provided Weyda\u2019s employer, Best Buy Co., Inc. The policy in effect at the time of the collision was a renewal policy for the period from July 1,1999, to July 1, 2000.</p>\n<p id=\"b709-9\">{\u00b6 3} Pacific and Weyda stipulated that, at the time of the collision, Weyda was operating a motorcycle owned by him and was not acting in the scope of his employment. Pacific moved for summary judgment. After the trial court granted summary judgment in favor of Pacific, Weyda dismissed, without prejudice, his claims against the remaining defendants.</p>\n<p id=\"b709-10\">{\u00b6 4} On appeal, Weyda asserts in his sole assignment of error that the trial court erred by concluding that because Weyda was not operating a \u201ccovered auto,\u201d he was precluded from receiving compensation under Pacific\u2019s uninsured-motorist coverage. Under Civ.R. 56, summary judgment is appropriate when (1) there is no genuine issue of material fact, (2) the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law, and (3) reasonable minds can come to but one conclusion and that conclusion is adverse to the nonmoving party.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> We review the trial court\u2019s grant of summary judgment de novo.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b709-11\">{\u00b6 5} Weyda argues that the policy exclusion Pacific relied on to deny coverage did not comply with the applicable version of R.C. 3937.18. We begin <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"680\">*680</page-number>our analysis by noting that the version of R.C. 3937.18, as enacted by Am.Sub. H.B. No. 261, effective September 3, 1997, applied to this case because both the original policy and the renewal policy were issued after the enactment of Am.Sub.H.B. No. 261, but before the effective date of any subsequent amendments to R.C. 3937.18.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b710-4\">{\u00b6 6} The pertinent version of R.C. 3937.18 states that underinsured- or uninsured-motorist coverage \u201cmay include terms and conditions that preclude coverage for bodily injury or death suffered by an insured under any of the following circumstances: (1) While the insured is operating or occupying a motor vehicle owned by, furnished to, or available for the regular use of a named insured, a spouse, or a resident relative of a named insured, if the motor vehicle is not specifically identified in the policy under which a claim is made, or is not a newly acquired or replacement motor vehicle covered under the terms of the policy under which the uninsured or underinsured motorist coverages are provided[.]\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b710-5\">{\u00b6 7} Pacific\u2019s policy defined \u201cyou\u201d as the \u201cNamed Insured shown in the Declarations.\u201d Endorsement 103, which provided for \u201cOhio Uninsured Motorists Coverage-Bodily Injury\u201d for \u201c \u2018a covered \u201cauto\u201d licensed or principally garaged in, or \u201cgaraged operations\u201d conducted in Ohio,\u2019 \u201d identified \u201cyou\u201d under \u201cwho is an insured.\u201d While it failed to define \u201cyou,\u201d it referred to the provisions of the coverage form, unless modified by the endorsement. The declarations and endorsement stated that the named insured was Best Buy Co., Inc.</p>\n<p id=\"b710-6\">{\u00b6 8} The uninsured-motorists endorsement stated that the insurer would pay \u201c \u2018all sums the \u201cinsured\u201d is legally entitled to recover as compensatory damages from the owner or operator of: (a) An \u201cuninsured motor vehicle\u201d as defined in Paragraphs F.3.a., b., and c. because of \u201cbodily injury\u201d: (1) Sustained by the \u201cinsured\u201d; and (2) Caused by an \u201caccident.\u201d \u2019 \u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b710-7\">{\u00b6 9} The exclusion found in the uninsured-motorist endorsement stated, in part, that the insurance did not apply to \u201c \u2018Bodily Injury\u2019 sustained by: (a) You while \u2018occupying\u2019 or when struck by any vehicle owned by you that is not a covered \u2018auto\u2019 for Uninsured Motorists Coverage under this Coverage Form[.]\u2019 \u201d This is known in insurance parlance as the \u201cother-owned-vehicle\u201d exclusion.</p>\n<p id=\"b710-8\">{\u00b6 10} The uninsured-motorist endorsement stated that it provided coverage only to covered \u201cautos.\u201d A covered auto for purposes of uninsured- or underin-sured-motorist coverage was designated by the symbol \u201c2.\u201d The symbol \u201c2\u201d constituted \u201c \u2018owned \u201cautos\u201d only.\u2019 \u201d \u201c \u2018Owned \u201cautos\u201d only\u2019 \u201d was defined by the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"681\">*681</page-number>policy as \u201c \u2018Only those \u201cautos\u201d you own * * \u201d \u201cAuto\u201d was defined as \u201ca land motor vehicle * * *.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b711-6\">{\u00b6 11} The policy also provided for a \u201cschedule of covered autos you own\u201d and indicated that a schedule was on file with \u201cCompany.\u201d Best Buy provided a list of vehicles it owned as part of the effective rate specifications both when it purchased and when it renewed the policy. Best Buy was required to maintain a record of autos it owned and to provide the list to Pacific at times set forth in the policy. Pacific was not provided information concerning Weyda\u2019s motorcycle.</p>\n<p id=\"b711-7\">{\u00b6 12} Neither party disputes that Weyda was an insured. Weyda, however, argues that the other-owned-vehicle exclusion in the policy failed to comply with R.C. 3937.18(J) and was, thus, unenforceable. Weyda argues that the statute allows exclusion only for noncovered autos owned by a named insured, and that because he was not a \u201cnamed insured,\u201d the exclusion could not be enforced. He also argues that because Pacific\u2019s endorsement did not require him to be occupying a covered auto under \u201cwho is an insured,\u201d as it did for anyone else other than an insured or family member, he was covered irrespective of what vehicle he was operating.</p>\n<p id=\"b711-8\">{\u00b6 13} Pacific argues that its exclusion complied with R.C. 3937.18(J) because \u201cyou\u201d and \u201cnamed insured\u201d were synonymous as defined by the policy and by <em>Scott-Pontzer v. Liberty Mut. Fire Ins. </em>Co.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Both included employees. Pacific also argues that the other-owned-vehicles exclusion excluded Weyda from coverage when he was occupying a vehicle owned by him that was not a covered auto under the coverage form. Best Buy was required to specifically list vehicles it owned for coverage under that form. Thus, according to Pacific, because Weyda\u2019s motorcycle was not listed in Best Buy\u2019s coverage form, Weyda was excluded from coverage.</p>\n<p id=\"b711-9\">{\u00b6 14} The Ohio Supreme Court determined in <em>Scott-Pontzer</em><footnotemark><em>6</em></footnotemark><em> </em>that \u201cyou,\u201d when defined as the \u201cnamed insured shown in the declarations\u201d in an auto insurance policy, was ambiguous. It concluded that when the named insured was a corporation and no individuals were listed as named insureds, the term \u201cyou\u201d necessarily referred to employees of the corporation because a corporation can act only through live persons.</p>\n<p id=\"b711-10\">{\u00b6 15} The other-owned-vehicle exclusion in Pacific\u2019s policy required that the vehicle be owned by \u201cyou.\u201d The policy defined \u201cyou\u201d as the named insured throughout. <em>Scott-Pontzer </em>has interpreted \u201cyou\u201d to mean an employee. Thus, we conclude that because \u201cyou\u201d and \u201cnamed insured\u201d as used in the policy were <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"682\">*682</page-number>synonymous, the exclusion in R.C. 3937.18(J) was enforceable for noncovered autos owned by an employee.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b712-5\">{\u00b6 16} There was no uninsured-motorist coverage for bodily injury sustained by Weyda when he was occupying a vehicle that was not a covered vehicle. We have reviewed the policy, including its schedule of forms and endorsements and its declarations, and the affidavit of Robert Garcia, the underwriting manager at the Chicago office of ACE USA. (Pacific is one of the insurance companies in the group.) Garcia\u2019s affidavit stated that, as part of its negotiations for the issuance and renewal of the policy and under the policy terms, Best Buy was required to maintain and to provide a listing of owned autos. Weyda\u2019s motorcycle was not specifically identified as a covered auto. Thus, we conclude that there was no uninsured-motorist coverage for his injuries. Accordingly, we affirm the trial court\u2019s grant of summary judgment in Pacific\u2019s favor.</p>\n<p id=\"b712-6\">Judgment affirmed.</p>\n<judges id=\"b712-7\">Hildebrandt and Gorman, JJ., concur.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b709-12\">. <em>Scott-Pontzer v.
