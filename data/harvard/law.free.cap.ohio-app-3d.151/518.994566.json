Kilbane, Judge.</author>\n<p id=\"b549-11\">{\u00b6 1} This is an appeal from an order of Judge Bridget McCafferty that found appellant Mark Youlten to be a sexual predator. Youlten claims that the evidence was insufficient because psychological tests did not rank him as a high risk for reoffending. We vacate the judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b549-12\">{\u00b6 2} On March 16, 1989, then 30-year-old Youlten pleaded guilty to one count of rape<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> and one count of gross sexual imposition<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> after he was indicted on 17 counts involving sexual contact and conduct with two brothers, ages three and seven, for whom he provided child care between October 1987 and June 1988. He received a prison sentence of five to 25 years and, on September 6, 2001, the state requested a sexual-predator hearing, which was granted. Youlten was referred to the court psychiatric clinic for examination, and a hearing was held on April 2, 2002. The state presented George W. Schmedlen, Ph.D., J.D., the court psychologist who examined Youlten, to testify about his findings, and also presented, inter aha, Schmedlen\u2019s written report, Youlten\u2019s institutional record, and his 1989 presentence report as exhibits, while Youlten presented documents showing his participation in sex-offender and related programs while in prison. The judge found that Youlten was a sexual predator.</p>\n<p id=\"b550-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"520\">*520</page-number>{\u00b6 3} In his sole assignment of error, Youlten claims that there was insufficient evidence to support a finding that he is a sexual predator. In order to prove that a defendant is a sexual-predator the state must show, by clear and convincing evidence, that he has been convicted of a sexually oriented offense and is likely to commit sexually oriented offenses in the future.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b550-5\">{\u00b6 4} \u201cClear and convincing evidence is that measure or degree of proof which is more than a mere \u2018preponderance of the evidence,\u2019 but not to the extent of such certainty as is required \u2018beyond a reasonable doubt\u2019 in criminal cases, and which will produce in the mind of the trier of facts a firm belief or conviction as to the facts sought to be established.\u201d<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b550-6\">{\u00b6 5} The judge is to consider all relevant factors in making the determination, including those specifically listed in R.C. 2950.09(B)(3).<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> As the Ohio Supreme Court has determined that predator hearings are civil in nature,<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> we review the challenge to determine whether there was sufficient evidence \u201cto satisfy the requisite degree of proof.\u201d<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> Whether the evidence presented is sufficient to sustain the burden of proof presents a question of law<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> which we review de novo without deference to the trial judge\u2019s conclusion.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b550-7\">{\u00b6 6} Dr. Sehmedlen referred to Youlten\u2019s medical records indicating that at around age 19 he had been a patient at Windsor Hospital for two lengthy stays and was diagnosed as suffering from schizophrenia, schizoaffective type, grand mal epilepsy, and borderline intelligence.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> Following two suicide attempts he was admitted to Fairhill Mental Health Center for three months in 1978 or 1979.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"521\">*521</page-number>In 1988, apparently after the victim\u2019s mother reported Youlten\u2019s alleged abuse, he threatened suicide and was hospitalized at Cleveland Psychiatric Institute for a month, where he was diagnosed as suffering from an \u201cadjustment disorder with depressed mood, alcohol and marijuana abuse, episodic, a personality disturbance with antisocial features and epilepsy.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b551-5\">{\u00b6 7} Dr. Schmedlen stated that the records indicated that, while in prison, Youlten obtained his GED, had shown no signs of a schizoaffective disorder or adjustment disorder, had received no mental health care while incarcerated, and \u201cmade an excellent adjustment at the institution.\u201d Prison records further revealed that for over two years he was active in a weekly sex-offender therapy group, he had adopted a very rigid set of religious values and rules and, although diagnosed as a pedophile, was open in his admission of offending, demonstrated remorse, and is \u201cmore aware of his thinking errors and is developing viable coping replacement thoughts.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b551-6\">{\u00b6 8} Dr. Schmedlen interviewed Youlten for about two and one-half hours over a two-day period and related that, in his early twenties, Youlten had enjoyed a two-and-one-half year relationship with a \u201cswinger\u201d that resulted in an engagement but the couple eventually broke up because, according to Youlten, this activity was \u201cnot for me.\u201d For over two years before his arrest he lived with a semiretired female engineer in her \u201clate 50\u2019s,\u201d who had been married before and had adult children. They married while he was in prison, she visited him three or four times per month, and they spoke on the telephone three times a day and had a very close relationship. She died of a massive stroke around 1993, and Youlten stated that he still missed her.</p>\n<p id=\"b551-7\">{\u00b6 9} He admitted to a brief homosexual relationship while in his early twenties with a 13- or 14-year-old but asserted that he is a heterosexual with no more interest in such conduct and denied any such contact while in prison.</p>\n<p id=\"b551-8\">{\u00b6 10} Youlten admitted to sexually abusing the two boys over a six-month period and infecting the three-year-old with chlamydia. \u201cI started sexually molesting [one of the victims] after a period of coaching. I always knew I was attracted to male children.\u201d Dr. Schmedlen reported that Youlten most definitely realizes that such conduct is \u201cnot legal, and wrong,\u201d and through treatment has \u201cgained the tools\u201d to work on the problem. \u201cI don\u2019t want to do it with a child. I will use my tools [learned in therapy] to curb it.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b551-9\">{\u00b6 11} Youlten was given the STATIC-99, an actuarial instrument designed to estimate the probability of sexual recidivism among adult males convicted of at least one sexual offense. The factors are historical in nature and cannot be changed by intervention. The results placed him in the \u201cmedium-low\u201d risk category.</p>\n<p id=\"b552-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"522\">*522</page-number>{\u00b6 12} The results of the Minnesota Sex Offender Screening Tool (MnSOST-R) placed Youlten in the \u201clow\u201d risk level. Unlike the STATIC-99, this test includes dynamic, changeable institutional variables such as discipline history while incarcerated, chemical dependency treatment, and sex-offender treatment to produce scores that are maximally predictive of sexual reoffending.</p>\n<p id=\"b552-5\">{\u00b6 13} Youlten was also given the two-part Abel Assessment for Sexual Interest test. The first part is a lengthy questionnaire about deviant behavior and current control of such inappropriate behavior, cognitive distortions, social desirability, and accusations, arrests and convictions for sexual misconduct. The second is a slide show during which a computer measures the time spent viewing each slide of males and females of different ages and a reshowing during which the viewer rates each on how arousing or disgusting it would be to be sexually active with the subject on the slide. It is, therefore, both an objective and subjective measure of sexual interest</p>\n<p id=\"b552-6\">{\u00b6 14} Youlten admitted that it was highly sexually arousing for him to have fantasies involving sexual touching of boys ages 13 years and under but stated \u201che had complete or nearly complete control over his behavior.\u201d He had a normal interest in adolescent and adult females and demonstrated a sexual interest in female children between the age of nine and 13 years.</p>\n<p id=\"b552-7\">{\u00b6 15} Based upon past history, Dr. Schmedlen diagnosed Youlten as suffering from pedophilia, sexually attracted to males, nonexclusive type,<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> but contended that he had only three of the nine factors indicative of risk for sexual reoffense recidivism.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> Dr. Schmedlen explained that pedophilia can be manifested in fantasies or through behavior. Because a person may have pedophilia fantasies and not act on them, he stated that he did not believe that the diagnosis \u201csays anything about the likelihood of actual action in the future.\u201d He testified that the likelihood of recidivism of people who had committed sexually oriented crimes with children is based upon certain behaviors \u201cseparate and apart from the diagnosis itself.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b552-8\">{\u00b6 16} While Dr. Schmedlen stated that a young child victim is a factor that is strongly predictive of the likelihood of recidivism, it was balanced by Youlten\u2019s acknowledgment that such conduct is illegal, his sexual offense treatment and related programs, and his training in methods to stop inappropriate thoughts and urges. Moreover, he contended that a person who is aware of his pedophilia interests \u201cis more likely to be able to control them.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b553-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"523\">*523</page-number>{\u00b6 17} When asked how he would rate Youlten as a risk for reoffending, Dr. Schmedlen considered him a medium-low category. He stated that Youlten was aware that what he had done was illegal, he didn\u2019t want to do it again, and he had learned control techniques such as \u201cthought stopping, where if he has the thought about an interest in a child, that stops the thought, that changes the \u2014 his mind goes somewhere else.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b553-5\">{\u00b6 18} Youlten, now 43 years of age, has been in prison for 13 years. He has received above-average work evaluations and is certified to help other inmates prepare for their GED tests. At his current prison he has been involved in many programs through institutional Mental Health Services, Unit and Religious Services. His completed sex-offender programs include Sex Education and Addiction, Social Skills, Victim Empathy, and Sexual Fantasy Restructuring, and he has participated in weekly Sex Offender Therapy Groups for over two years.</p>\n<p id=\"b553-6\">{\u00b6 19} While one does not condone Youlten\u2019s prior sexual conduct or his abuse of the boys entrusted to his care, a determination that an offender is a sexual predator is based upon a prediction of future sexual misconduct. The record reveals a concerted effort for rehabilitation and, in the opinion of Dr. Schmedlen, Youlten displays few risk factors (certain behaviors) indicative of re-offending and many factors favoring behavior modification.</p>\n<p id=\"b553-7\">{\u00b6 20} The judge found Youlten to have impaired intelligence even though his IQ test was from 1978, and Dr. Schmedlen found him more learning disabled than borderline intelligent. Furthermore, Youlten now has his GED and tutors others, and Dr. Schmedlen found his reasoning capacity and concept-formation abilities to be in the average range. The judge concentrated on his psychiatric admissions of 1978-79 and diagnoses of schizophrenia, while she overlooked the facts that no such mental condition was diagnosed after the abuse charges were made in 1988, that he did not require psychiatric care while in prison, and Dr. Schmedlen found his reality testing to be intact.</p>\n<p id=\"b553-8\">{\u00b6 21} She next determined that Youlten and his former wife were \u201cswingers,\u201d and rejected his claim that he did not like the activities and had changed over time. The \u201cswinger,\u201d however, was not Youlten\u2019s wife but his fianc\u00e9e when he was in his early twenties.</p>\n<p id=\"b553-9\">{\u00b6 22} Most important, the judge concentrated on the fact that Youlten is a pedophile who \u201cstill fantasized about children\u201d and \u201ccould still offend later in life.\u201d She stated that \u201c[c]ertainly it has not gone away or dissipated over time and probably most likely will escalate when he is in the presence of children.\u201d Dr. Schmedlen, however, explained that pedophilia is a long-term disorder and that it is not illegal to have fantasies about children as long as a person does not act on them. He recounted Youlten\u2019s awareness of his disorder and programs and methods he has utilized to strengthen his resolve and self-control.</p>\n<p id=\"b554-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"524\">*524</page-number>{\u00b6 23} If the legislature had evidence to support a claim that every convicted pedophile was a sexual predator, one could dispense with the hearing mandated by R.C. Chapter 2950. If the various prison programs offered to and successfully completed by sexual offenders serve no purpose, it is clear that tax dollars are being misspent. If the Court Psychiatric Clinic predator evaluation that Justice Lundberg Stratton stated, in <em>State v. Eppinger,</em><footnotemark><em>14</em></footnotemark><em> </em>\u201cmay be the best tool available to the court to assist it in making these determinations\u201d (predicting future behavior) can be ignored in favor of a judge\u2019s personal opinion that Youlten\u2019s sexual fantasies will most likely manifest into abusive behavior \u201cwhen he is in the presence of children,\u201d why have them done?</p>\n<p id=\"b554-5\">{\u00b6 24} Because of the \u201cprofound impact on a defendant\u2019s life,\u201d<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> one simply cannot find that every person who fantasizes about illegal sexual conduct is a sexual predator. On the totality of the record, there is, indeed, a possibility that Youlten will reoffend but no clear and convincing evidence that future sexual misconduct is likely or probable.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b554-6\">Judgment vacated.</p>\n<judges id=\"b554-7\">Patricia A.

Rogers, </em>Cuyahoga App. No. 80435, 2002-Ohio-3443, 2002 WL 1454071, citing <em>State v. Cook </em>(1998), 83 Ohio St.3d 404, 426, 700 N.E.2d 570. Therefore, the decision is reviewed by an appellate court to determine if the <em>weight </em>of the evidence supports it. <em>State v. Thompson </em>(2001), 92 Ohio St.3d 584, 752 N.E.2d 276, <em>State v. Childs </em>(2001), 142 Ohio App.3d 389, 755 N.E.2d 958. The matter for appellate review thus is not a \u201cquestion of law,\u201d as the majority opinion asserts.</p>\n<p id=\"b555-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"525\">*525</page-number>{\u00b6 27} Of course, deference must be given to the trial court\u2019s assessment of the evidence. Id. Nevertheless, a review of the record demonstrates that appellant\u2019s essential argument has merit, since the trial court\u2019s determination lacks an adequate foundation in the evidence. Although the trial court conducted a proper hearing pursuant to the guidelines set forth in <em>State v. Eppinger </em>(2001), 91 Ohio St.3d 158, 743 N.E.2d 881, the trial court did not take into consideration an important point: <em>Eppinger </em>cited with approval this court\u2019s comments in <em>State v. Thompson </em>(1999), 140 Ohio App.3d 638, 748 N.E.2d 1144. <em>Thompson </em>reminded trial courts that \u201cMegan\u2019s Laws\u201d were designed to protect the most vulnerable victims from the <em>likeliest </em>offenders. Appellant in this case does not meet the envisioned standard.</p>\n<p id=\"b555-5\">{\u00b6 28} Schmedlen testified that he had administered three assessment tests to appellant and had interviewed him twice. The tests utilized were the Abel Assessment for Sexual Interest, the Minnesota Sex Offenders Screening Tool, and the STATIC-99. Schmedlen testified that only the latter two are \u201cactuarial instruments used to assess risk for sexual reoffending.\u201d Appellant\u2019s scores on those tests were in a low category, indicating that over a period of 15 years, he was in the 16th percentile for likelihood of reoffending.</p>\n<p id=\"b555-6\">{\u00b6 29} On the first test, appellant admitted having a sexual interest in and fantasies involving young boys, but stated that he had \u201ccomplete or nearly complete control\u201d over <em>acting </em>on any such behavior. In addition, appellant expressed both an awareness that that interest was \u201cillegal\u201d and culturally improper and a remorse for his actions that led to his convictions.</p>\n<p id=\"b555-7\">{\u00b6 30} Appellant\u2019s statements had credibility, since they found corroboration in the \u201cSex Offender Program Summary\u201d contained in his prison record and the defense documents that demonstrated that appellant successfully had completed several sexual offenders programs. Moreover, according to Schmedlen, persons who either did not realize their deviant proclivities or who did not differentiate between fantasies and acts are at a significantly higher risk to reoffend; thus, appellant\u2019s awareness of his psychological problem was encouraging.</p>\n<p id=\"b555-8\">{\u00b6 31} The trial court, however, clearly relied upon only historical facts in making its decision in this case, and without apparent reason, did so to the exclusion of more recent evidence that related more relevantly to appellant\u2019s current likelihood to reoffend. Consequently, its decision is unsupported by the weight of the evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b555-9\">{\u00b6 32} For the foregoing reason, appellant\u2019s argument should be credited, and his assignment of error, although inappropriately stated, sustained. I, therefore, concur with only the result reached by the majority.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
