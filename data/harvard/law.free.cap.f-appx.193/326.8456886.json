Phillips contends his sentence is unconstitutional in light of <em>United States v. Booker, </em>543 U.S. 220, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005), and <em>Blakely v. Washington, </em>542 U.S. 296, 124 S.Ct. 2531, 159 L.Ed.2d 403 (2004), because it was based on facts that were not set forth in his indictment or proven beyond a reasonable doubt.</p>\n<p id=\"b348-23\">Phillips\u2019 claims based on alleged errors that occurred at sentencing may not be asserted in a \u00a7 2241 petition. <em>See Padilla v. United States, </em>416 F.3d 424, 425-26 (5th Cir.2005). Phillips\u2019 claims based on allegations that he is entitled to proceed under \u00a7 2241 are unavailing. <em>Id. </em>at 426-27.</p>\n<p id=\"b348-24\">APPEAL DISMISSED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b348-17\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
