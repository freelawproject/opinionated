He contends that his classification as an armed career criminal under the Armed Career Criminal Act (the \u201cACCA\u201d) was made in error because (1) he did not have three predicate convictions for violent felonies or serious drug offenses that had been \u201ccommitted on occasions different from one another,\u201d 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924(e)(1), and (2) in concluding to the contrary, the sentencing court engaged in improper fact-finding, in contravention of his Sixth <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"213\">*213</page-number>Amendment rights. As explained below, we reject Griffin\u2019s contentions and affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b235-5\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b235-6\">In August 2003, Detective Linwood Mercer of the Williamston (North Carolina) police received information that Griffin was selling crack cocaine from his residence. On August 29, 2003, Mercer executed a search warrant that authorized the search of both Griffin and his Williamston residence. In addition to seizing crack cocaine, marijuana, and drug paraphernalia in the search, Mercer recovered a 9-millimeter handgun with an obliterated serial number and fourteen rounds of .38 special Winchester ammunition.</p>\n<p id=\"b235-7\">On February 19, 2004, a grand jury returned a two-count indictment against Griffin, charging him with being a felon in possession of a firearm (Count One) and a felon in possession of ammunition (Count Two), both in contravention of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 922(g). The indictment specified that Griffin possessed the firearm and ammunition after \u201chaving been convicted of a crime punishable by imprisonment for a term exceeding one year.\u201d J.A. 6.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Griffin thereafter pleaded guilty to both counts of the indictment, without the benefit of a plea agreement. During his Rule 11 plea hearing, Griffin admitted that he had possessed the handgun and the ammunition as alleged, and that he had previously been convicted of a crime punishable by imprisonment for a term exceeding one year.</p>\n<p id=\"b235-8\">On October 26, 2005, the probation officer submitted to the district court his final presentence report (\u201cPSR\u201d) on Griffin, which indicated, inter alia, that Griffin had been previously indicted in the Martin County (North Carolina) Superior Court on three counts of \u201cStatutory Rape and Indecent Liberties.\u201d According to the PSR, these three charges arose from alleged sexual contact that Griffin had with a fourteen-year-old girl in March 2002 and May 2002, and again on April 22, 2003. The PSR indicated that, on July 18, 2003, Griffin pleaded guilty in Martin County to three North Carolina offenses of \u201cIndecent Liberties With a Child\u201d (the \u201csex offense convictions\u201d). The PSR further reflected that its information regarding the sex offense convictions was derived from unspecified \u201ccourt records.\u201d J.A. 48-49.</p>\n<p id=\"b235-14\">With respect to Griffin\u2019s felon-in-possession convictions in this case, the PSR recommended a base offense level of 26. Relying on the three previous sex offense convictions in Martin County, however, the PSR concluded that Griffin was an armed career criminal under the ACCA, and it thus set his base offense level at 34 and placed him in criminal history category VI. <em>See </em>USSG \u00a7 4B1.4 (2004). The PSR recommended a three-level reduction for acceptance of responsibility, <em>see id. </em>\u00a7 3E1.1, resulting in a total offense level of 31 and a Guidelines sentencing range of 188 to 235 months.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b235-15\">Griffin filed an objection to the PSR, contending that he was not an armed career criminal. Specifically, he maintained that the sex offense convictions were not for offenses committed on separate occasions, but for \u201ca continuous course of consensual conduct with the same victim.\u201d J.A. 56. The court overruled his objection, however, and sentenced him to two concurrent 188-month terms of imprisonment. This sentence complied with the mandato<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"214\">*214</page-number>ry minimum sentence of 180 months imprisonment prescribed by the ACCA, <em>see </em>18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924(e)(1), but it was more than the 120-month maximum provided for in his statute of conviction, absent the ACCA enhancement, <em>see id. </em>\u00a7 924(a)(2). Griffin has timely noted an appeal of his sentence, and we possess jurisdiction pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291.</p>\n<p id=\"b236-4\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b236-5\">In this appeal, Griffin makes two contentions concerning his sentence: (1) that the district court erred in determining that his three previous sex offense convictions were for crimes \u201ccommitted on occasions different from one another,\u201d <em>see </em>18 U.S.C. \u00a7 922(e)(1); and (2) that the court had unconstitutionally enhanced his sentence beyond the maximum authorized by the statute of conviction, on the basis of judicially-found facts derived from unspecified \u201ccourt records.\u201d We assess these contentions in turn.</p>\n<p id=\"b236-6\">A.</p>\n<p id=\"b236-7\">The district court\u2019s conclusion that Griffin\u2019s previous convictions were for crimes committed on occasions different from one another is a question of law that we review de novo. <em>United States v. Hobbs, </em>136 F.3d 384, 387 (4th Cir.1998). The ACCA mandates a minimum sentence of 180 months if a felon in possession of a firearm or ammunition has \u201cthree previous convictions ... for a violent felony or a serious drug offense, or both, committed on occasions different from one another.\u201d 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924(e)(1). Under our precedent, two offenses have occurred on occasions different from one another if they arose out of \u201cseparate and distinct criminal episode[s],\u201d each of which is \u201cisolated with a beginning and an end.\u201d <em>United States v. Letterlough, </em>63 F.3d 332, 335 (4th Cir.1995).</p>\n<p id=\"b236-8\">Griffin does not contend that his three previous sex offense convictions were not violent felonies for the purposes of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924(e)(1), but maintains that his previous convictions were for crimes that did not occur on occasions different from one another. In his view, his earlier sex offenses were part and parcel of a \u201ccontinuous course of consensual conduct.\u201d Unfortunately for Griffin, we rejected a similar contention in <em>Letterlough. </em>There, we concluded that the defendant\u2019s two drug transactions with the same person an hour-and-a-half apart were \u201cnot part of a continuous course of criminal conduct,\u201d but had been committed on occasions different from one another. <em>See Letterlough, </em>63 F.3d at 337 (alterations omitted). In so ruling, we observed that, if an accused completed a criminal act, had time \u201cto make a conscious and knowing decision to engage in\u201d another criminal act, and then chose \u201cto engage in another separate and distinct criminal transaction,\u201d the two crimes had occurred on occasions different from one another. <em>Id. </em>Each of Griffin\u2019s previous sex offense convictions arose from a separate and distinct criminal episode: an act of sexual contact that could be isolated with a beginning and an end. Moreover, Griffin committed his sex offenses in March 2002 and May 2002, and again on April 22, 2003. Griffin thus had sufficient time to make a \u201cconscious and knowing decision\u201d before engaging in each subsequent offense.</p>\n<p id=\"b236-9\">In contending that his previous convictions were not for offenses that occurred on occasions different from one another, Griffin raises the factors for \u201cseparate- and-distinct\u201d offenses spelled out in <em>Letter-lough </em>and revisited by us in <em>Hobbs. </em>In both cases we recognized that, \u201c[i]n engaging in this separate-and-distinct analysis, sentencing courts consider (i) whether the offenses occurred in different geographic locations; (ii) whether the offenses were <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"215\">*215</page-number>substantively different; and (iii) \u2018whether the offenses involved multiple victims or multiple criminal objectives.\u2019 \u201d <em>Hobbs, </em>136 F.3d at 388 (citing <em>Letterlough, </em>63 F.3d at 335-36).</p>\n<p id=\"b237-5\">Griffin suggests that his previous offenses did not occur on different occasions because none of the foregoing factors are satisfied. The factors spelled out in <em>Letterlough </em>and <em>Hobbs, </em>however, are not dis-positive; rather, they simply aid a sentencing court when \u201cthe factual permutations surrounding the ACCA ... create havoc.\u201d <em>Letterlough, </em>63 F.3d at 335. Specifically, the sentencing courts have applied these factors \u201cwhere defendants have claimed that their prior criminal acts took place on one occasion because they were committed within an extremely short time span.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 336-37 (concluding that two drug transactions more than an hour apart occurred on occasions different from one another); <em>see also Hobbs, </em>136 F.3d at 387 n. 5, 389-90 (assuming for purposes of appellate review that three burglaries occurred within an hour of each other and concluding they had occurred on occasions different from one another). Griffin, however, does not contend that his previous sex offense convictions were for crimes committed during an extremely short time span. Instead, he maintains they were part of a \u201ccontinuous course of consensual conduct,\u201d which took place over an extended period of time. Because the timing of Griffin\u2019s previous offenses is a dispositive point, we need not look to and analyze separately the factors specified in <em>Letterlough </em>and <em>Hobbs. </em>In these circumstances, the district court did not err in concluding that Griffin\u2019s three previous convictions arose from offenses that occurred on occasions different from one another. His challenge to his armed career criminal classification on this basis is thus without merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b237-6\">B.</p>\n<p id=\"b237-7\">Griffin next contends that the district court contravened his Sixth Amendment rights by enhancing his sentence on the basis of judicially-found facts. Because Griffin has raised this issue for the first time on appeal, we review it for plain error only. <em>See United States v. Olano, </em>507 U.S. 725, 731-32, 113 S.Ct. 1770, 123 L.Ed.2d 508 (1993). While Griffin was sentenced under the advisory Guidelines regime, his actual sentence\u2014188 months\u2014 was greater than the maximum sentence authorized by the statute of conviction. <em>See </em>18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924(a)(1) (authorizing maximum sentence of 120 months imprisonment). The court justified the imposition of a 188-month sentence by its finding that Griffin possessed three previous convictions for violent felonies, <em>see id. </em>\u00a7 924(e)(1) (requiring mandatory minimum sentence of 180 months for armed career criminal under ACCA), and Griffin asserts that this enhancement contravenes the Sixth Amendment.</p>\n<p id=\"b237-8\">Generally, as the Supreme Court held in its <em>Apprendi </em>and <em>Booker </em>decisions, \u201cany fact that increases the penalty for a crime beyond the prescribed statutory maximum must be submitted to a jury, and proved beyond a reasonable doubt.\u201d <em>Apprendi v. New Jersey, </em>530 U.S. 466, 490, 120 S.Ct. 2348, 147 L.Ed.2d 435 (2000); <em>accord United States v. Booker, </em>543 U.S. 220, 244, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005). If such a fact is one of a prior conviction, however, a sentencing court is entitled to make a relevant finding of fact. <em>See Apprendi, </em>530 U.S. at 490, 120 S.Ct. 2348; <em>Booker, </em>543 U.S. at 244, 125 S.Ct. 738. Nevertheless, the Sixth Amendment limits the sources on which a sentencing court may rely in finding facts relating to prior convictions. <em>United States v. Allen, </em>446 F.3d 522, 531 (4th Cir.2006). In finding such facts, a sentencing court may look <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"216\">*216</page-number>only to \u201c \u2018the terms of the charging document, the terms of a plea agreement or transcript of colloquy between judge and defendant in which the factual basis for the plea was confirmed by the defendant, or ... some comparable judicial record.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>(quoting <em>Shepard v. United States, </em>544 U.S. 13, 26, 125 S.Ct. 1254, 161 L.Ed.2d 205 (2005)).</p>\n<p id=\"b238-4\">The evidence concerning Griffin\u2019s sex offense convictions came from unspecified \u201ccourt records\u201d referenced in his PSR. And the PSR failed to indicate whether those \u201ccourt records\u201d were judicial records like those referred to in <em>Shepard </em>and <em>Allen. </em>In <em>United States v. Thompson, </em>however, we held that \u201c[t]he trial judge [is] entitled to rely upon the PSR\u201d to find prior convictions when \u201cit bears the earmarks of derivation from <em>Shepard-approved </em>sources such as the indictments and state-court judgments from his prior convictions,\u201d and when a defendant fails to raise \u201cthe slightest objection either to the propriety of its source material or to its accuracy.\u201d 421 F.3d 278, 285 (4th Cir.2005). Griffin\u2019s PSR bore the obvious earmarks of derivation from Shepard-approved sources. That is, the facts regarding his convictions (dates of commission and statutory violations) were the type normally found in a Shepard-approved source, <em>see id. </em>at 282-83, and the PSR indicated that the facts were gleaned from \u201ccourt records.\u201d Moreover, Griffin failed to object \u201cto the propriety of [the PSR\u2019s] source material or to its accuracy,\u201d <em>see id. </em>at 285; rather he objected only to the conclusion that his prior convictions arose from offenses committed on occasions different from one another. <em>Thompson </em>thus constrains us to conclude that the district court was \u201centitled to rely upon the PSR,\u201d <em>id., </em>and it committed no Sixth Amendment error in so doing. Griffin therefore cannot show that the district court plainly erred in its findings concerning his previous convictions.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> This aspect of his appellate contentions thus also fails.</p>\n<p id=\"b238-7\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b238-8\">Pursuant to the foregoing, we affirm Griffin\u2019s sentence. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before us and argument would not aid in the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b238-9\">\n<em>AFFIRMED.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b235-9\">. Citations herein to \u201cJ.A. _\u201d refer to the contents of the Joint Appendix in this appeal.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"A2l\">. The parties agree that, in the absence of the ACCA enhancement, Griffin's total offense level would have been 23, and his criminal history category would have been IV, resulting in a Guidelines sentencing range of 70 to 78 months.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b238-5\">. Griffin also argues that the three sex offense convictions should have either been alleged in the indictment or admitted by him in his plea colloquy. Griffin\u2019s contention on this point, however, is foreclosed by our ruling in <em>United States v. Cheek, </em>415 F.3d 349, 354 (4th Cir.2005) (holding that \"the Sixth Amendment ... does not demand that the mere fact of a prior conviction used as a basis for a sentencing enhancement be pleaded in an indictment and submitted to a jury for proof beyond a reasonable doubt\u201d).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
