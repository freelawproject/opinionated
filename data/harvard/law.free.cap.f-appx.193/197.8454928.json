On appeal, Wyllie claims that the district court erred by imposing a six-level increase to his base offense level pursuant to <em>U.S. Sentencing Guidelines Manual </em>\u00a7 3A1.2(c) (2004). After thoroughly reviewing the record, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b219-24\">A district court\u2019s factual determinations regarding application of the Sentencing Guidelines are reviewed for clear error, and its legal interpretations of the Guidelines are reviewed de novo. <em>United States v.

We find that the district court did not err in concluding that Wyllie created a sub<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"198\">*198</page-number>stantial risk of serious injury to a law enforcement officer when he used his vehicle to strike a police vehicle occupied by two officers in his attempt to evade apprehension. <em>See generally United States v.

We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b220-5\">\n<em>AFFIRMED.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
