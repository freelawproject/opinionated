Chan\u2019s motion to reopen was based on 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1003.44, which now allows aliens who meet certain requirement to seek relief from removal under the former \u00a7 212(c) of the Immigration and Nationality Act. Based on a prior finding that Chan had obtained permanent resident status through a material misrepresentation, the BIA determined that Chan could not demonstrate the required lawful permanent resident status to be eligible for relief under 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1003.44.</p>\n<p id=\"b343-14\">Chan argues that his misrepresentation was not \u201cmaterial\u201d and, therefore, the BIA erred in determining he was not a lawful permanent resident. In a February 2003 proceeding, from which Chan did not seek a petition for review, the BIA found that Chan\u2019s misrepresentation of his criminal history was material and that his adjustment of status had been obtained as a result of this misrepresentation. Chan has not shown that the BIA erred by relying on this prior finding in denying his motion to reopen. Given the prior finding that Chan\u2019s misrepresentation was material and ultimately resulted in his adjustment of status to permanent resident, he could not show that he was a \u201clawful\u201d permanent resident, which was required for eligibility for relief under 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1003.44. <em>See In re Koloamatangi, </em>23 I &amp; N. Dec. 548, 2003 WL 77728 (BIA 2003) (alien who obtains adjustment of status through fraud or other misrepresentation has not been lawfully admitted); <em>see also In re Longstaff, </em>716 F.2d 1439, 1441 (5th Cir.1983) (lawful admission denotes compliance with both procedural and substantive requirements). As Chan can not show he was eligible for such relief, the BIA did not abuse its discretion in denying Chan\u2019s motion to reopen. <em>See Zhao v. Gonzales, </em>404 F.3d 295, 303 (5th Cir.2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b343-15\">Chan also argues that the BIA\u2019s denial of the opportunity to apply for \u00a7 212(c) relief has denied him a due process right. There is no due process liberty interest in the possibility of \u00a7 212(c) relief. <em>See Nguyen v. District Director, Bureau of ICE, </em>400 F.3d 255, 259 (5th Cir.2005); <em>United States v. Lopez-Ortiz, </em>313 F.3d 225, 231 (5th Cir.2002). Due process only requires that an alien receive notice of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"322\">*322</page-number>charges against him, a hearing before an administrative or executive tribunal, and a fair opportunity to be heard. <em>Lopez-Ortiz, </em>313 F.3d at 230. Chan does not suggest that he did not receive notice, a hearing, and an opportunity to be heard. Therefore, his due process claim is without merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b344-4\">PETITION FOR REVIEW DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b343-11\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir.
