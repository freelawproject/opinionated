The district court sentenced Zuniga-Rios to 120 months\u2019 imprisonment on Count 1 and 60 months\u2019 imprisonment on Count 5, to be served consecutively, for a total of 180 months\u2019 imprisonment, five years of supervised release on each of Counts 1 and 5, to be served concurrently, and ordered payment of a $200 statutory assessment.<footnotemark>*</footnotemark> Zuniga-Rios\u2019 counsel has filed a brief pursuant to <em>Anders v. California, </em>386 U.S. 738, 87 S.Ct. 1396, 18 L.Ed.2d 493 (1967), stating that there are no meritorious grounds for appeal, but questioning whether the Government breached the terms of the plea agreement when it failed to motion, pursuant to USSG \u00a7 5K1.1, for imposition of a sentence below the applicable sentencing guidelines, and pursuant to 18 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 3553(e) (West 2000 <em>&amp; </em>Supp. 2005), to impose a sentence below the statutory mandatory minimum, based on Zuniga-Rios\u2019 substantial assistance. ZunigaRios was given an opportunity to file a supplemental <em>pro se </em>brief, but has failed to do so.</p>\n<p id=\"b218-11\">As a preliminary matter, by the explicit terms of the plea agreement he entered into with the Government, Zuniga-Rios waived his right to appeal his conviction or his sentence, save his right to raise a claim of prosecutorial misconduct or ineffective assistance of counsel. The record reflects that Zuniga-Rios knowingly and voluntarily agreed to this provision. To the extent his assertion on appeal is a challenge to his sentence, we decline to consider it. <em>See United States v. Blick, </em>408 F.3d 162, 168 (4th Cir.2005). To the extent his challenge is based on prosecutorial misconduct, we find no merit to his claim, as we find no unconstitutional motive in the Government\u2019s refusal to file a substantial assistance motion where, as here, the refusal is based on the defendant\u2019s wilful absconding and attendant unavailability to testify at trial. <em>See Wade v. United States, </em>504 U.S. 181, 185-86, 112 S.Ct. 1840, 118 L.Ed.2d 524 (1992).</p>\n<p id=\"b218-12\">In accordance with <em>Anders, </em>we have reviewed the entire record in this case and have found no meritorious issues for appeal. We therefore affirm Zuniga-Rios\u2019 conviction and sentence. This court re<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"197\">*197</page-number>quires that counsel inform his client, in writing, of his right to petition the Supreme Court of the United States for further review. If the client requests that a petition be filed, but counsel believes that such a petition would be frivolous, then counsel may move in this court for leave to withdraw from representation. Counsel\u2019s motion must state that a copy thereof was served on the client.</p>\n<p id=\"b219-5\">We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b219-6\">\n<em>AFFIRMED.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b218-9\"> The probation officer calculated a sentencing guideline range applicable to Zuniga-Rios of 87 to 108 months\u2019 imprisonment, plus a mandatory consecutive sentence of not less than five years on the firearm conviction, founded on a total offense level of 29 and a criminal history category of I. However, the statutory mandatoiy minimum sentence of imprisonment for a violation of 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 841(b)(1)(A) is 120 months, plus a mandatory consecutive sentence of not less than 5 years for a violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924(c). <em>U.S. Sentencing Guidelines Manual </em>(\"USSG\u201d), \u00a7\u00a7 5G1.1(b), 2K2.4, Chapter 5, Part A (2004).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
