On appeal, counsel filed an <em>Anders </em><footnotemark>*</footnotemark> brief, in which he states there are no meritorious issues for appeal, but suggests that Groves\u2019s sentence is unreasonable. The Government has moved to dismiss Groves\u2019s appeal based upon a waiver of appellate rights in her plea agreement.</p>\n<p id=\"b228-21\">We deny the Government\u2019s motion to dismiss because the waiver does not preclude our review of any errors in Groves\u2019s conviction that may be revealed by our review pursuant to <em>Anders. </em>We conclude, however, that Groves waived the right to proceed with the claim asserted in the <em>Anders </em>brief, and accordingly dismiss that portion of her appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b228-22\">In accordance with <em>Anders, </em>we have reviewed the entire record in this case and have found no meritorious issues for appeal. We therefore affirm Groves\u2019s conviction and sentence. This court requires that counsel inform Groves, in writing, of the right to petition the Supreme Court of the United States for further review. If Groves requests that a petition be filed, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"207\">*207</page-number>but counsel believes that such a petition would be frivolous, then counsel may move in this court for leave to withdraw from representation. Counsel\u2019s motion must state that a copy thereof was served on Groves. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b229-5\">\n<em>DISMISSED IN PART AND AFFIRMED IN PART.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b228-15\"> <em>Anders v.
