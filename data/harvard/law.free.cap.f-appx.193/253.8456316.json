He was sentenced to 78 months\u2019 imprisonment. Hammoud appeals both his conviction and sentence, contending that the evidence was insufficient to sustain a guilty verdict and that a two-level sentencing enhancement for obstruction of justice, <em>see </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3C1.1, was unwarranted. For the following reasons, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b276-19\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b276-20\">Hammoud owned a gift shop in Ft. Lauderdale, Florida, where he sold incense, lighters, knives, tasers, \u201call item[s] related to pipes,\u201d plastic bags, various types of cutting agent, scales, and other drug paraphernalia. J.A. 146. Hammoud first met Anthony Stroy in or about October 2003, when Stroy entered Hammoud\u2019s shop seeking \u201cparaphernalia to help [him] <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"255\">*255</page-number>distribute [his] cocaine.\u201d J.A. 36. Hammoud sold Stroy a $400 cocaine press and approximately $1400 in other goods, including electronic scales, roughly eight ounces of cutting agent, and roughly one thousand plastic baggies. (Cutting agent is used \u201cto stretch cocaine\u201d and increase the seller\u2019s profit, while a press, also called a compressor, is used to recompress cocaine once it is mixed with a cutting agent. J.A. 39.) Hammoud admits that he knew Stroy was a drug dealer when he made these sales. Hammoud packaged and shipped the items to Stray\u2019s address in Washington, D.C., in a box labeled \u201cincense.\u201d J.A. 57. He instructed Stroy to identify the contents as \u201ca dietary supplement\u201d should the police question him about the shipment. <em>Id. </em>While Stroy was at Hammoud\u2019s shop, Hammoud advised Stroy on what types of cutting agent and what ratios of cutting agent-to-cocaine to use to augment profits without customers detecting any difference in drug quality. He offered to help Stroy mix and recompress any cocaine that Stroy had, but Stroy had none with him. While driving Stroy to the airport that same day or the next, Hammoud loaned Stroy a canning machine, a device that conceals drugs and masks their odor. He also offered to introduce Stroy to some local drug dealers he \u201cdealt with [and] trusted\u201d who could sell Stray cocaine, though no introductions were ever made. J.A. 42.</p>\n<p id=\"b277-5\">Over the next several months, Hammoud mailed to Stroy six or seven more packages of cutting agent, each containing between eight and ten ounces. Hammoud did not insist on immediate payment from Stroy. He told Stroy to \u201cjust Western Union the money\u201d when Stroy had it; Stroy ultimately ran up a bill of roughly $2700. J.A. 48. In late 2003 or early 2004 Stroy unwittingly sold cocaine to an undercover Drug Enforcement Agency (DEA) agent, Special Agent Robert Valentine. Stroy, who intended to \u201cgo into business\u201d with Valentine, suggested that he and Valentine, with Hammoud\u2019s help, \u201cstretch the bricks [of cocaine] out and maybe make an extra $20,000 or so.\u201d J.A. 51. After Valentine expressed an interest in acquiring a press and cutting agent, Stroy called Hammoud to ask \u201cif it would be okay if my friend [Valentine] gave him a call.\u201d J.A. 52. Hammoud agreed, and he and Valentine subsequently spoke by phone.</p>\n<p id=\"b277-7\">Hammoud never met with Valentine, however. He met instead with Valentine\u2019s associate, a government informant named Michael Papanieolas, in July 2004. Hammoud supplied Papanieolas with free samples of cutting agent, including one labeled \u201cGreasy Snort\u201d and another labeled \u201cDW\u201d for \u201cDiamond White,\u201d and offered to take Papanieolas to his house to demonstrate how to mix and compress cocaine with the cutting agent. J.A. 70-71, 173-75. Hammoud further said that he knew drug dealers in the area. Hammoud used code words during this conversation: \u201cincense\u201d for cutting agent and \u201c18-year-old girls\u201d and \u201c20-year-old girls\u201d (meaning $18,000 and $20,000, respectively) to quote prices for kilograms of cocaine. J.A. 72-73. A week or two later, in August 2004, Papanicolas called Hammoud to order more cutting agent and a compressor. Papanieolas indicated that he was \u201ctrying to turn other drug dealers on to the mixture\u201d and that he wanted to be able to \u201cmix it\u201d himself. J.A. 81. Hammoud advised Papanieolas to \u201cput my incense with your incense\u201d (mix the cutting agent with the cocaine, in other words); Hammoud also said that Valentine \u201ccould show [Papanioeolas] how to do it,\u201d if need be. J.A. 81-82. Papanieolas then sent Hammoud a money order, and Hammoud shipped the compressor and cutting agent to a post office box in Virginia. Hammoud and Papanieolas spoke by phone again in September 2004 to plan a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"256\">*256</page-number>trip to Florida for Papanicolas, during which Hammoud would sell him a canner and more cutting agent and introduce him to cocaine suppliers.</p>\n<p id=\"b278-4\">In December 2004 a grand jury in the Eastern District of Virginia returned a one-count indictment against Hammoud for conspiring to distribute 500 grams or more of a mixture containing cocaine, in violation of 21 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 841(a)(1) and 846. Law enforcement officers arrested Hammoud in January 2005 and thereafter searched his shop, where they found \u201cvarious cutting agents, baggies used to sell street-level narcotics, electronic scales, [and] various items ... used to conceal drugs for street-level narcotics dealers.\u201d J.A. 133 (punctuation omitted). At the one-day bench trial in May 2005, the government presented testimony from four witnesses: two DEA agents, Papanicolas, and Stroy, Hammoud\u2019s alleged co-eonspirator turned government cooperator. The government also introduced recordings of conversations between Hammoud and government agents (Stroy and Papanicolas) and physical evidence seized from Hammoud\u2019s shop. After the government rested, Hammoud filed a Rule 29 motion for judgment of acquittal, which the district court denied. <em>See </em>Fed.R.Crim.P. 29. Hammoud then testified as the only defense witness. The district court returned a guilty verdict, imposed a two-level sentencing enhancement for obstruction of justice, <em>see </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3C1.1, and sentenced Hammoud to 78 months\u2019 imprisonment. Hammoud appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b278-5\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b278-6\">Hammoud challenges the sufficiency of the evidence supporting his conspiracy conviction. In evaluating a sufficiency challenge, we are obliged to sustain a guilty verdict \u201c \u2018if there is substantial evidence, taking the view most favorable to the Government, to support it.\u2019 \u201d <em>United States v. Burgos, </em>94 F.3d 849, 862 (4th Cir.1996) (en banc) (quoting <em>Glasser v. United States, </em>315 U.S. 60, 80, 62 S.Ct. 457, 86 L.Ed. 680 (1942)). We have defined \u201csubstantial evidence\u201d as \u201cevidence that a reasonable finder of fact could accept as adequate and sufficient to support a conclusion of a defendant\u2019s guilt beyond a reasonable doubt.\u201d <em>Id. </em>In conducting our review, we examine the cumulative weight of the evidence and leave undisturbed the factfinder\u2019s credibility determinations. <em>See id. </em>at 862-63.</p>\n<p id=\"b278-8\">The essential elements of the charged conspiracy are that: (1) an agreement to distribute cocaine existed between two or more persons; (2) the defendant knew of the conspiracy; and (3) the defendant knowingly and voluntarily joined the conspiracy. <em>See id. </em>at 857. Because the gravamen of a conspiracy charge is the agreement to violate the law, \u201cnot whether the conspirators have worked out the details of their confederated criminal undertakings,\u201d the government need not prove that a defendant knew <em>all </em>the details of the conspiracy. <em>United States v. Mills, </em>995 F.2d 480, 484 (4th Cir.1993); <em>see also Burgos, </em>94 F.3d at 858. Moreover, knowledge and participation in the conspiracy may be proved by circumstantial evidence. <em>United States v. Meredith, </em>824 F.2d 1418, 1428 (4th Cir.1987).</p>\n<p id=\"b278-9\">The evidence shows an agreement between Hammoud and Stroy to distribute cocaine. (Because Papanicolas participated in the drug ring only <em>after </em>becoming a government agent, Hammoud cannot be convicted for conspiring with him. <em>See United States v. Lewis, </em>53 F.3d 29, 33 (4th Cir.1995).) Hammoud repeatedly sold Stroy materials used in cutting, weighing, preparing, and bagging cocaine\u2014overt acts that he committed knowingly and willingly. <em>See Mills, </em>995 F.2d at 485 n. 1 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"257\">*257</page-number>(\u201c[Ejvidence of a buy-sell transaction is at least relevant (Le.probative) on the issue of whether a conspiratorial relationship exists.\u201d). Hammoud admits knowing that Stroy was a drug dealer when he sold Stroy the drug paraphernalia, and Hammoud\u2019s use of code words (for example, \u201cincense\u201d and \u201c18-year-old girls\u201d) confirms this knowledge. Additionally, Hammoud instructed Stroy how to mix the cutting agent with the cocaine to increase profitability, directed Stroy to deceive the police about the cutting agent\u2019s composition and use, loaned Stroy a device to transport and conceal drugs and cutting agent, extended him a line of credit, and offered to introduce him to local drug dealers. All of these actions advanced, or at least were intended to advance, the conspiracy\u2019s goal of distributing cocaine. <em>See, e.g., United States v. Askew, </em>403 F.3d 496, 502 (7th Cir.2005) (observing that sales on credit among alleged co-conspirators is common circumstantial evidence of a narcotics conspiracy). That Hammoud\u2019s sales of paraphernalia to Stroy increased as Stroy\u2019s drug sales increased is further evidence that Hammoud knowingly and willingly participated in the conspiracy. <em>See Meredith, </em>824 F.2d at 1428 (holding that defendant\u2019s sales of cutting agent and glassine bags to co-defendants furthered the heroin conspiracy by increasing \u201cthe ring\u2019s narcotics sales,\u201d and finding that such evidence was sufficient to sustain the conspiracy conviction). Given Hammoud\u2019s obvious connection to the conspiracy, it is immaterial that he never sold cocaine himself, for he otherwise facilitated its sale. <em>See United States v. Banks, </em>10 F.3d 1044, 1054 (4th Cir.1993) (\u201cIt is of course elementary that one may be a member of a conspiracy ... without taking part in the full range of its activities.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b279-5\">For these reasons, we conclude that Hammoud\u2019s conspiracy conviction was supported by substantial evidence and therefore must stand.</p>\n<p id=\"b279-7\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b279-8\">Hammoud also challenges his two-level sentence enhancement for obstruction of justice based on perjury, U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3C1.1. This enhancement applies if the sentencing court finds by a preponderance of the evidence that the defendant (1) gave false testimony (2) concerning a material matter (3) with the willful intent to deceive rather than as a result of confusion, mistake, or faulty memory. <em>United States v. Sun, </em>278 F.3d 302, 314 (4th Cir.2002). We have cautioned that such an enhancement \u201cdoes not automatically apply every time a defendant who testifies at trial is convicted,\u201d because a defendant\u2019s specific statements on the stand may have been true, not intentionally false, or immaterial. <em>Id. </em>(internal quotation marks and citation omitted). In evaluating an application of the guidelines, we review the district court\u2019s factual findings for clear error and its legal determinations de novo. <em>Id. </em>at 313.</p>\n<p id=\"b279-9\">Although Hammoud admitted knowing that Stroy was a drug dealer, he consistently denied all involvement in the drug distribution ring despite ample evidence that he knowingly attempted to increase the drug ring\u2019s profitability and facilitate the purchase, transport, and concealment of drugs. In particular, Hammoud testified that his cutting agent was worthless, merely carpet cleaner or \u201ckitchen incense\u201d that could not effectively be mixed with drugs. J.A. 172, 178. Stroy\u2019s and Papanicolas\u2019s testimony directly contradicted this contention, as did Hammoud\u2019s own words recorded during his telephone conversations with both men. Hammoud further testified, contrary to Papanicolas\u2019s testimony and the telephone recordings, that the press could never be used for cocaine. Based on these denials, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"258\">*258</page-number>the district court determined that Hammoud gave false testimony that concerned material matters. Having further determined that Hammoud gave such testimony with \u201cthe intent to mislead,\u201d the district court imposed a two-level enhancement for obstruction of justice. J.A. 244; <em>see </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3C1.1.</p>\n<p id=\"b280-4\">Hammoud\u2019s challenge to this enhancement is without merit. The district court did not err in finding that Hammoud committed perjury at trial. The materiality of Hammoud\u2019s testimony is, moreover, plain, as it concerned the heart of the case\u2014 whether Hammoud was a knowing and willing participant in the conspiracy. We further leave undisturbed the court\u2019s finding of a willful intent to deceive because the district court was in the best position to judge Hammoud\u2019s credibility. <em>See United States v. Jones, </em>356 F.3d 529, 537 (4th Cir.2004); <em>Sun, </em>278 F.3d at 314. Accordingly, we reject Hammoud\u2019s challenge to the sentence enhancement for obstruction of justice.</p>\n<p id=\"b280-5\">We therefore affirm the district court\u2019s judgment. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court, and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b280-6\">\n<em>AFFIRMED.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
