Murcia-Murgueitio alleged that he would suffer persecution at the hands of the National Liberation Army (ELN) based on his membership in the Conservative Party and as a member of a family whose members were persecuted by the ELN. Murcia-Murgueitio argues that the BIA and Immigration Judge erred both because he (1) established changed circumstances and (2) established that it is more likely than not that he will be persecuted upon his return to Colombia. We dismiss in part and deny in part MurciaMurgueitio\u2019s petition.</p>\n<p id=\"b898-14\">The BIA affirmed the denial of MurciaMurgueitio\u2019s application for asylum because Murcia-Murgueitio filed the application outside of the one-year statutory period and failed to establish changed circumstances to excuse the late filing. <em>See </em>8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1158(a)(2)(D). Section 1158(a)(2)(B) provides that an alien may apply for asylum if \u201cthe alien demonstrates by clear and convincing evidence that the application has been filed within 1 year after the date of the alien\u2019s arrival in the United States.\u201d 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1158(a)(2)(B). An alien may apply for asylum after one year of arrival if the alien \u201cdemonstrates ... either the existence of changed circumstances which materially affect the applicant\u2019s eligibility for asylum or extraordinary circumstances relating to the delay in filing an application.\u201d <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 1158(a)(2)(D).</p>\n<p id=\"b898-17\">We lack jurisdiction to review the denial of Murcia-Murgueitio\u2019s application for asylum as time-barred. Under section 1158(a)(3), \u201c[n]o court shall have jurisdiction to review any determination\u201d that an application was untimely or failed to establish changed or extraordinary circumstances to excuse the delay. <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 1158(a)(3). Although section 1252(a)(2)(D) permits courts to review alleged constitutional deprivations and questions of law, Murcia-Murgueitio has not presented an issue of that kind. <em>See id. </em>\u00a7 1252(a)(2)(D); <em>Chacon-Botero v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>427 F.3d 954 (11th Cir.2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b898-18\">The BIA affirmed the denial of MurciaMurgueitio\u2019s application for withholding of removal because Murcia-Murgueitio failed to establish that he would more likely than <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"877\">*877</page-number>not be persecuted as a member of his family. Because the BIA issued a separate opinion from the IJ, we review the decision of the BIA, except to the extent that the BIA expressly adopts the decision of the IJ, <em>A1 Najjar v. Ashcroft, </em>257 F.3d 1262, 1284 (11th Cir.2001), and reverse findings of facts \u201conly when the record compels a reversal,\u201d <em>Tan v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>446 F.3d 1369, 1374 (11th Cir.2006). \u201c[A]n alien is entitled to withholding of removal if [ ]he establishes \u2018that it is more likely than not that [ ]he would be persecuted on account of race, religion, nationality, membership in a particular social group, or political opinion upon removal to that country.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1375 (quoting 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 208.16(b)(2)).</p>\n<p id=\"b899-5\">Murcia-Murgueitio argues that he more likely than not will be persecuted upon his return to Colombia because he shares the same last name as his mother and aunt, who were targeted by the ELN, but substantial evidence supports the findings of the IJ. Although Murcia-Murgueitio bases his claim on the persecution that his mother suffered, he personally has never been threatened by the ELN. The record does not compel the conclusion that Murcia-Murgueitio will more likely than not suffer persecution upon his return to Colombia.</p>\n<p id=\"b899-6\">Murcia-Murgueitio\u2019s petition is</p>\n<p id=\"b899-7\">DISMISSED in part and DENIED in part.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
