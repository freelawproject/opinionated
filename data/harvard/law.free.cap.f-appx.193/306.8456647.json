First Kalalib asserts that the immigration judge (IJ) erred in requiring him to establish that his wife would suffer extreme hardship if he were deported in order to obtain a waiver of inadmissibility under 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1182(h). The IJ did not err in requiring Kalalib to meet the requirements of \u00a7 1182(h)(1)(B). He does not qualify for a waiver under subparagraph (A) under the statute\u2019s plain language because the IJ determined that he is inadmissible under both \u00a7 1182(a)(2)(A)(i)(D) and \u00a7 1182(a)(6)(C)(i). <em>See </em>\u00a7 1182(h)(1)(A).</p>\n<p id=\"b328-24\">In the alternative, Kalalib asserts that he did establish that his wife would suffer <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"307\">*307</page-number>extreme hardship upon his deportation, such that he is entitled to waivers of inadmissibility under \u00a7 1182(h) and (i). We are precluded from considering this issue by 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(a)(2)(B), which bars judicial review of the IJ\u2019s discretionary determinations under \u00a7 1182(h) and (i).</p>\n<p id=\"b329-5\">Kalalib also asserts two arguments that he failed to raise before the BIA: that the IJ violated his Due Process rights in finding that he had committed visa fraud and that the IJ ignored BIA precedent in denying his application for adjustment of status. Because Kalalib failed to exhaust these issues, we do not have jurisdiction to consider them. <em>See </em>\u00a7 1252(d)(1); <em>Roy v. Ashcroft, </em>389 F.3d 132, 137 (5th Cir.2004).</p>\n<p id=\"b329-6\">Finally, Kalalib asserts that the IJ erred in considering his prior arrests in exercising his discretion. This court lacks jurisdiction to review the bases for discretionary determinations under \u00a7 1182(h) <em>&amp; </em>(i) and \u00a7 1255. <em>See </em>\u00a7 1252(a)(2)(B)\u00ae.</p>\n<p id=\"b329-7\">The petition for review is DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b328-16\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
