Vega-Dominguez preserved his challenge to the application of mandatory Sentencing Guidelines for appellate review by objecting in the district court that his sentence violated <em>Blakely v. Washington, </em>542 U.S. 296, 124 S.Ct. 2531, 159 L.Ed.2d 403 (2004). <em>United States v. Rodriguez-Mesa, </em>443 F.3d 397, 404 (5th Cir.2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b374-14\">Vega-Dominguez\u2019s constitutional challenge to 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1326 is foreclosed by <em>Almendarez-Torres v. United States, </em>523 U.S. 224, 235, 118 S.Ct. 1219, 140 L.Ed.2d 350 (1998). Although Vega-Dominguez contends that <em>Almendarez-Torres </em>was incorrectly decided and that a majority of the Supreme Court would overrule <em>Almendarez-Torres </em>in light of <em>Apprendi v. New Jersey, </em>530 U.S. 466, 120 S.Ct. 2348, 147 L.Ed.2d 435 (2000), and its progeny, we have repeatedly rejected such arguments on the basis that <em>Almendarez-Torres </em>remains binding. <em>See United States v. Garza-Lopez, </em>410 F.3d 268, 276 (5th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. \u2014, 126 S.Ct. 298, 163 L.Ed.2d 260 (2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b374-17\">Vega-Dominguez argues that the district court committed reversible error under <em>United States v. Booker, </em>543 U.S. 220, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005), by sentencing him pursuant to a mandatory application of the Sentencing Guidelines, and that his sentence pursuant to mandatory Guidelines is a presumptively prejudicial structural error. Vega-Dominguez concedes that his claim of structural error is foreclosed by circuit precedent. <em>See United States v. Malveaux, </em>411 F.3d 558, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"353\">*353</page-number>561 n. 9 (5th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. \u2014, 126 S.Ct. 194, 163 L.Ed.2d 209 (2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b375-7\">The district court erred when it sentenced Vega-Dominguez under the mistaken belief that the Sentencing Guidelines were mandatory. <em>United States v. Valenzuela-Quevedo, </em>407 F.3d 728, 732 (5th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. \u2014, 126 S.Ct. 267, 163 L.Ed.2d 240 (2005). We agree with the Government\u2019s concession that it cannot show that Vega-Dominguez\u2019s 72-month sentence was harmless beyond a reasonable doubt. <em>See United States v. Walters, </em>418 F.3d 461, 464 (5th Cir.2005). The district court sentenced Vega-Dominguez near the bottom of the applicable range under the Sentencing Guidelines, and it gave no indication whether it would have imposed a different sentence under advisory guidelines. Accordingly, we vacate Vega-Dominguez\u2019s sentence and remand for resentencing.</p>\n<p id=\"b375-10\">CONVICTION AFFIRMED; SENTENCE VACATED; REMANDED FOR RESENTENCING.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b374-11\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
