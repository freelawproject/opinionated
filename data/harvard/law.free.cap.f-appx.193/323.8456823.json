Rowland appeals the district court\u2019s decision affirming the denial of his application for a period of disability and disability insurance benefits under the Social Security Act. He asserts that he was not afforded due process under the law and that documentation he submitted in support of his claims was not fully considered.</p>\n<p id=\"b345-18\">Rowland, however, does not brief his claims on appeal nor does he address the district court\u2019s determination that the administrative law judge\u2019s decision was supported by substantial evidence. Although this court liberally construes pro se briefs, <em>see Haines v. Kerner, </em>404 U.S. 519, 520, 92 S.Ct. 594, 30 L.Ed.2d 652 (1972), even pro se litigants must brief arguments in order to preserve them. <em>Yohey v. Collins, </em>985 F.2d 222, 224-25 (5th Cir.1993). Because Rowland fails to brief any of his claims on appeal, they are deemed abandoned. <em>Yohey, </em>985 F.2d at 224-25. Accordingly, the district court\u2019s judgment is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b345-19\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir.
