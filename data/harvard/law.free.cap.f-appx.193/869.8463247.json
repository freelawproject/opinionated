On appeal, he argues that the fact-finding to establish that his conviction for escape from confinement was a \u201cviolent felony\u201d under the Armed Career Criminal Act (ACCA) \u201cwent beyond a simple ministerial determination as to whether [he had] previously been convicted of a crime.\u201d According to George, determining the factual nature of a prior conviction, as required in this case, is reserved for a jury under <em>United States v. Booker, </em>543 U.S. 220, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005) and <em>Blakely v. Washington, </em>542 U.S. 296, 124 S.Ct. 2531, 159 L.Ed.2d 403 (2004).</p>\n<p id=\"b892-17\">To preserve a <em>Booker </em>error for appellate review, a defendant must either (1) refer to the Sixth Amendment, or <em>Apprendi v. New Jersey, </em>530 U.S. 466, 120 S.Ct. 2348, 147 L.Ed.2d 435 (2000) or the <em>Apprendi-line </em>of cases, (2) raise the right to have the jury decide the disputed fact, or (3) raise a challenge to the role of the judge as fact-finder with regard to sentencing. <em>United States v. Dowling, </em>403 F.3d 1242, 1246 (11th Cir.2005), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. \u2014, 126 S.Ct. 462, 163 L.Ed.2d 351 (2005). In the district court, George argued that <em>United States v. Webb, </em>139 F.3d 1390 (11th Cir.1998) and <em>United States v. Spell, </em>44 F.3d 936 (11th Cir.1995) <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"871\">*871</page-number>allowed the <em>court </em>to look beyond the judgment of conviction to the underlying conduct to see that George\u2019s escape conviction involved the failure to return from work release and, thus, was not a violent felony. He did not argue that <em>Booker, Blakely, </em>or <em>Shepard v. United States, </em>544 U.S. 13, 125 S.Ct. 1254, 161 L.Ed.2d 205 (2005) required a jury to determine whether his conviction was a \u201cviolent felony,\u201d nor that classification of his conviction as such violated his constitutional rights. Rather, he argued that <em>Webb </em>and <em>Spell </em>allowed the <em>court </em>to look beyond the conviction to the underlying conduct. George\u2019s \u201cattorney clearly understood the judge\u2019s role as the fact-finder by a preponderance of the evidence, and never challenged that.\u201d <em>Dowling, </em>403 F.3d at 1246. Therefore, George, despite objecting to the classification of his conviction for escape from confinement as a \u201cviolent felony\u201d for purposes of the ACCA, failed to preserve the constitutional issue below.</p>\n<p id=\"b893-5\">Where a defendant fails to preserve an issue below, this Court reviews for plain error. <em>United States v. Martinez, </em>407 F.3d 1170, 1173 (11th Cir.2005). We \u201cmay not correct an error the defendant failed to raise in the district court unless there is: (1) error, (2) that is plain, and (3) that affects substantial rights. If all three conditions are met, an appellate court may then exercise its discretion to notice a forfeited error, but only if (4) the error seriously affects the fairness, integrity, or public reputation of judicial proceedings.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(internal quotations and citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b893-6\">\u201cThe Armed Career Criminal Act (ACCA), 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924(e)(1), provides a mandatory minimum sentence of fifteen years for anyone who violates 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 922(g)[, by illegally possessing a firearm] after three convictions for a violent felony or a serious drug offense.\u201d <em>United States v. Greer, </em>440 F.3d 1267, 1269 (11th Cir.2006). <em>See also </em>18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924(e). Guideline \u00a7 4B1.4 implements \u00a7 924(e). <em>See </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4B1.4, comment, (n. 4).</p>\n<p id=\"b893-8\">In <em>Almendarez-Torres v. United States, </em>523 U.S. 224, 118 S.Ct. 1219, 140 L.Ed.2d 350 (1998), the Supreme Court held that a prior conviction is not a fact which must be alleged in the indictment or found by a jury beyond a reasonable doubt. <em>See United States v. Shelton, </em>400 F.3d 1325, 1329 (11th Cir.2005). In its subsequent decisions in <em>Apprendi, </em>as well as <em>Blakely </em>and <em>Booker, </em>the Supreme Court reaffirmed the holding in <em>Almendarez-Torres. See Shelton, </em>400 F.3d at 1329. In <em>Apprendi, </em>the Court held that \u201c[o]ther than the fact of a prior conviction, any fact that increases the penalty for a crime beyond the prescribed statutory maximum must be submitted to a jury, and proved beyond a reasonable doubt.\u201d <em>Apprendi, </em>530 U.S. at 490, 120 S.Ct. at 2362-63. The Court revisited <em>Apprendi </em>in <em>Blakely v. Washington, </em>clarifying \u201cthat the \u2018statutory maximum\u2019 for <em>Apprendi </em>purposes is the maximum sentence a judge may impose <em>solely on the basis of the facts reflected in the jury verdict or admitted by the defendant </em>[;]\u201d it did not disturb <em>Apprendi\u2019s </em>exception for prior convictions. <em>Blakely, </em>542 U.S. at 303, 124 S.Ct. at 2537 (emphasis in original). Subsequently, in <em>Booker, </em>the Court held that <em>Blakely </em>applied to the Federal Sentencing Guidelines and reaffirmed its holding in <em>Apprendi. Booker, </em>543 U.S. at 243-44, 125 S.Ct. at 755-56. Then in <em>Shepard, </em>the Supreme Court limited the types of evidence a district court can constitutionally consider to determine whether a prior burglary conviction qualifies as a \u201cviolent felony\u201d for purposes of the ACCA, where the statutory definition of burglary includes both violent and nonviolent conduct. <em>Shepard, </em>544 U.S. at 24-26, 125 S.Ct. at 1262-63.</p>\n<p id=\"b894-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"872\">*872</page-number>Upon review of the record and the parties\u2019 briefs, we find no reversible error. In George\u2019s case, he is not arguing that the district court consulted improper sources of evidence. Thus, <em>Shepard </em>does not apply. Indeed, we have held that <em>\u201cShepard </em>does not bar judges from finding whether prior convictions qualify for ACCA purposes; it restricts the sources of evidence that a judge (instead of a jury) can consider in making that finding.\u201d <em>Greer, </em>440 F.3d at 1275. Therefore, the district court did not commit constitutional error in determining that George\u2019s conviction for escape from confinement qualified as a violent felony.</p>\n<p id=\"b894-4\">Moreover, George is incorrect when he argues that \u201c[t]he fact of the conviction alone does not unambiguously establish that a conviction for [escape from confinement] is a violent felony for purposes of \u00a7 924(e)(1).\u201d We have held that \u201ca prior escape conviction qualifies as a \u2018crime of violence\u2019 under the career offender guideline.\u201d <em>United States v. Gay, </em>251 F.3d 950, 954 (11th Cir.2001). In <em>Gay, </em>we reasoned that: (1) the statutory offense of escape does not contain ambiguities that make the \u201ccrime of violence\u201d determination impossible from the judgment; (2) escape, by its nature, \u201cpresents a serious potential risk of physical injury to another[;]\u201d and (3) every other circuit that decided the issue found that escape had inherent potential for serious risk of physical injury to another. 251 F.3d at 953-955. It is true that the definition of \u201cviolent felony\u201d for purposes of the ACCA is not identical to \u201ccrime of violence\u201d for the purpose of classifying a defendant as a career offender under the guidelines. <em>See </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4B1.4, comment. (n.l) (\u201cIt is to be noted that the definition[] of \u2018violent felony1 ... in 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924(e)(2) [is] not identical to the definition[] of \u201ccrime of violence\u201d ... used in [U.S.S.G.] \u00a7 4B1.1 (Career Offender)....\u201d). Nevertheless, the pertinent part of the definitions are identical: \u201cconduct that presents a serious potential risk of physical injury to another.\u201d <em>See </em>18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924(e)(2)(B)(ii); U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4B1.2(a)(2). Therefore, classification of escape from confinement as a \u201ccrime of violence\u201d supports the conclusion that any error committed by the district court in finding that George\u2019s prior conviction for escape from confinement constituted a \u201cviolent felony\u201d for purposes of the ACCA was not plain. In fact, other circuits have held that \u201cwalk-away\u201d escapes are violent felonies for the purposes of the ACCA. <em>See, e.g., United States v. Childs, </em>403 F.3d 970, 971-72 (8th Cir.2005) (persuasive authority); <em>United States v. Maddox, </em>388 F.3d 1356, 1369 (10th Cir.2004) (persuasive authority). Thus even if the district court committed error, it was not plain error. The judgment of the district court is</p>\n<p id=\"b894-6\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
