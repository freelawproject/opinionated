We deny the petition for review.</p>\n<p id=\"b268-9\">We do not have jurisdiction to review the Board\u2019s decision not to sua sponte reopen proceedings. <em>Ali v. Gonzales, </em>448 F.3d 515, 518 (2d Cir.2006). In addition, we find the immigration judge did not abuse his discretion in denying the motion to reopen as untimely. <em>See </em>8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1003.23(b)(4)(ii) (2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b268-10\">Accordingly, we deny the petition for review. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b268-11\">\n<em>PETITION DENIED</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
