Johnson appealed one of the enhancements, and we remanded for further findings. The district court made those findings and adhered to its previous determination of the Guidelines range, but sentenced Johnson to 33 months, citing her good behavior in prison. Johnson appealed, for the first time raising a Sixth <em>Amendment/Blakely </em>claim, we affirmed citing circuit precedent, and the Supreme Court vacated and remanded for further consideration in light of <em>United States v. Booker, </em>543 U.S. 220, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b323-15\">As Johnson concedes, we review for plain error because she did not object to her sentence in district court on Sixth Amendment grounds. <em>United States v. Mares, </em>402 F.3d 511, 520 (5th Cir.2005). Hence she must show an obvious error that \u201caffect[s][her] substantial rights\u201d and \u201cseriously affect[s] the fairness, integrity, or public reputation of judicial proceedings.\u201d <em>United States v. Olano, </em>507 U.S. 725, 113 S.Ct. 1770, 123 L.Ed.2d 508 (1993). A <em>Booker </em>error affects a defendant\u2019s substantial rights if the sentencing judge, sentencing under an advisory scheme, would have reached a significantly different result. <em>Mares, </em>402 F.3d at 521.</p>\n<p id=\"b323-16\">Although, as the Government concedes, there was clear <em>Booker </em>error here, Johnson cannot show that the district judge would have given a lower sentence under an advisory scheme. In support of her contention otherwise, she points only to the sentencing judge\u2019s statement at sentencing on remand that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"ACu\">there are limits set out by the guidelines as to what I can sentence you since I have found the enhancement for obstruction of justice applicable. When you were here before, I sentenced you to 41 months. In view of your history [in prison].... Accordingly, I\u2019m going to reduce the sentence to the bottom of the guidelines and order you committed to the custody of the Bureau of Prisons for a term of 33 months.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b323-17\">This statement reveals no express desire to sentence Johnson below the Guidelines range. Although it could be read to reflect an implicit desire to do so, it is more <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"302\">*302</page-number>easily read as a statement of fact\u2014the Guidelines provide \u201climits,\u201d still true post-Booker\u2014explaining the choice of 33 months out of all possibilities. Moreover, there is no indication that a downward departure would have been justified under an advisory scheme after consideration of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a), given the record and the district court\u2019s reliance only on post-offense conduct to explain its 33-month sentence, <em>see United States v. Desselle, </em>450 F.3d 179, 182 (5th Cir.2006); <em>Mares, </em>402 F.3d at 519, and we read the district court\u2019s statement in light of that.</p>\n<p id=\"b324-4\">Consequently, the judgment of conviction and sentence are REINSTATED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"AyG\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
