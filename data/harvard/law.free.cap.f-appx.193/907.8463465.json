He appeals the district court\u2019s denial of his 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2241 petition for a writ of habeas corpus. He contends that the court erred in refusing to credit his federal sentence with 750 days of good time credit (\u201cGTC\u201d) earned while serving a Montana sentence.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b930-17\">An inmate receives credit for \u201cany time he has spent in official detention\u201d prior to when he begins serving the federal sentence if that official detention was on account of the \u201coffense for which the sentence was imposed.\u201d 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3585(b)(1). Section 3585(b) does not mention the transfer of earned GTC from state to federal sentences. <em>See id. </em>Section 4105(c)(1) provides, however, that persons transferred from foreign prisons transfer with the good time credit earned in serving the foreign sentence. 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 4105(c)(1).</p>\n<p id=\"b930-18\">Section 3585(b) is not ambiguous. It only authorizes the Bureau of Prisons (\u201cBOP\u201d) to give credit for time an inmate has spent in official detention. State GTC is not time spent in official detention as its redemption results in an early release from detention. Had petitioner completed his state sentence, Montana would have released him before the projected end of his sentence based on his earned GTC. The BOP could not have credited his federal sentence with the time he did not serve on the end of his sentence because it was not spent in official detention. Considering \u00a7 4105 in conjunction with \u00a7 3585(b) does not alter this conclusion. Section 4105(c)(1) specifically references credits for both time served and GTC, while \u00a7 3585(b) is limited to official deten<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"909\">*909</page-number>tion. Lastly, to the extent that \u00a7 3585(b) might be considered ambiguous, the BOP\u2019s interpretation of the statute, that GTC is not transferred, is reasonable and not clearly contrary to the law.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b931-5\">Petitioner contends, alternatively, that the rule of lenity requires that he be credited with GTC earned in Montana. Under the \u201crule of lenity,\u201d ambiguities in criminal statutes are resolved in favor of the defendant. <em>United States v. Maldonado-Ramirez, </em>216 F.3d 940, 943 (11th Cir.2000). The rule is not a \u201cdoctrine of first resort,\u201d but only applied when \u201c \u2018the traditional canons of statutory construction\u2019 fail to resolve an ambiguity.\u201d <em>Id </em>(citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b931-6\">As noted above, \u00a7 3585(b) is not ambiguous since the statutory text clearly does not address the transfer of GTC from state to federal sentences. Further, even if it were considered ambiguous, the BOP\u2019s interpretation of the statute is reasonable. As the statute was not ambiguous and any ambiguity could be resolved through reference to the BOP\u2019s interpretation, the rule of lenity is inapplicable.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b931-7\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b930-14\">. What petitioner is actually complaining of is the refusal of the Bureau of Prisons to credit his sentence with the GTC earned in Montana, not the failure of the district court to provide in the judgment (pursuant to which petitioner is serving his federal sentence) that he should be given credit for the Montana GTC.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b931-9\">. The Supreme Court has established a two-step process for reviewing an agency\u2019s interpretation of a statute which it administers. <em>Chevron U.S.A., Inc. v. Natural Res. Def. Council, Inc., </em>467 U.S. 837, 842-43, 104 S.Ct. 2778, 2781-82, 81 L.Ed.2d 694 (1984). First, if congressional purpose is clear, then interpreting courts and administrative agencies \"must give effect to the unambiguously expressed intent of Congress.\u201d <em>Id., </em>at 842-43, 104 S.Ct. at 2781. A second level of review, however, is triggered when \"the statute is silent or ambiguous with respect to the specific issue.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 843, 104 S.Ct. at 2782. A court may not substitute its own construction of a statutoiy provision for a reasonable interpretation by an administrating agency. <em>Id. </em>at 844, 104 S.Ct. at 2782. An agency\u2019s interpretation is reasonable and controlling unless it is \"arbitrary, capricious, or clearly contrary to law.\u201d <em>Alabama Power Co. v. Fed. Energy Regulatory Comm\u2019n, </em>22 F.3d 270, 272 (11th Cir.1994). In this case, we conclude that <em>Chevron </em>deference is due the BOP with respect to its decision to deny petitioner the relief he seeks.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"AxqE\">. In his brief to us, petitioner argues that the BOP's failure to credit his sentence with the Montanan GTC denied him due process of law and the Double Jeopardy Clause. Because he did not present this argument to the district court, we do not consider it here.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
