On appeal, Vargas argues that he was only a crew member aboard the vessel, with no interest or control in the drugs, and a limited knowledge of the scope of the criminal conspiracy, and therefore, the district court clearly erred in not granting him a minor-role reduction.</p>\n<p id=\"b890-14\">We review a district court\u2019s decision on whether to grant a minor-role reduction for clear error. <em>United States v. Rodriguez De Varon, </em>175 F.3d 930, 937 (11th Cir.1999) <em>(en banc). </em>Minor participants may receive a two-level reduction. U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3B1.2(a), (b). A minor participant \u201cmeans any participant who is less culpable than most other participants, but whose role could not be described as minimal.\u201d U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3B1.2, cmt. 5; <em>De Varon, </em>175 F.3d at 939.</p>\n<p id=\"b890-15\">The defendant has the burden of establishing his role by a preponderance of evidence. <em>De Varon, </em>175 F.3d at 939. For a sentencing court to determine whether to grant a minor-role reduction, it considers two principles. <em>Id. </em>at 940. First, the court must measure the defendant\u2019s role against the relevant conduct for which she is being held accountable. <em>Id. </em>We have noted that \u201c[ojnly if the defendant can establish that she played a relatively minor role in the conduct for which she has al<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"869\">*869</page-number>ready been held accountable\u2014not a minor role in any larger criminal conspiracy\u2014 should the district court grant\u201d a minor-role reduction. <em>Id. </em>at 944. The second prong of the minor-role reduction analysis permits a district court, \u201cwhere the record evidence is sufficient ... [, to] measure the defendant\u2019s conduct against that of other participants in the criminal scheme attributed to the defendant.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 934.</p>\n<p id=\"b891-5\">When making the minor-role determination, a district court should consider the \u201camount of drugs, fair market value of drugs, amount of money to be paid to the courier, equity interest in the drugs, role in planning the criminal scheme, and role in the distribution. This is not an exhaustive list, nor does it suggest that any one factor is more important than another.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 945. The district court has \u201cconsiderable discretion in making this fact-intensive determination.\u201d <em>United States v. Boyd, </em>291 F.3d 1274, 1277-78 (11th Cir.2002). \u201c[A] district court is not required to make any specific findings other than the ultimate determination of the defendant\u2019s role in the offense.\u201d <em>De Varon, </em>175 F.3d at 940. \u201cSo long as the basis of the trial court\u2019s decision is supported by the record <em>and </em>does not involve a misapplication of a rule of law,\u201d we should affirm. <em>Id. </em>at 945.</p>\n<p id=\"b891-6\">Upon review of the record and consideration of the parties\u2019 briefs, we discern no reversible error. Vargas was part of a five-member crew aboard a go-fast boat that was transporting 1508 kilograms of cocaine. At sentencing, Vargas was held accountable only for the 1508 kilograms of cocaine. Vargas introduced no evidence that he was less culpable than any of the other members of the go-fast boat\u2019s crew. Vargas\u2019s argument seems to be that, as a crew member, he was less culpable than the cocaine\u2019s owner or major drug traffickers. Vargas, however, was sentenced on the basis of being in possession with intent to distribute 1508 kilograms of cocaine, not on the basis of any larger drug trafficking scheme. Vargas admitted to being a crew member in possession of 1508 kilograms of cocaine, a significant amount. The district court concluded that Vargas did not carry his burden of proving that he was a minor participant in the conduct for which he was held accountable. We conclude that the district court did not clearly err in refusing to give Vargas a minor-role reduction.</p>\n<p id=\"b891-9\">AFFIRMED.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b891-7\">.
