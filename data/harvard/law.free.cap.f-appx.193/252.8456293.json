See Local Rule 36(c).</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b275-8\">PER CURIAM:</author>\n<p id=\"b275-9\">Daour Ndiaye, a native and citizen of Senegal, petitions this court for review of an order of the Board of Immigration Appeals (Board) affirming the immigration judge\u2019s denial of a motion to reconsider. The Board also found that the immigration judge did not abuse his discretion in denying Ndiaye voluntary departure.</p>\n<p id=\"b275-10\">First, we have considered Ndiaye\u2019s challenge to the discretionary denial of voluntary departure and conclude that we lack jurisdiction to review it. <em>See </em>8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1229c(f) (2000) (\u201cNo court shall have jurisdiction over an appeal from denial of a request for an order of voluntary departure....\u201d); 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(a)(2)(B)(I) (2000) (\u201c[N]o court shall have jurisdiction to review any judgment regarding the granting of relief under section ... 1229c [the section governing voluntary departure] \u201d); <em>Ngarurih v. Ashcroft, </em>371 F.3d 182, 193 (4th Cir.2004) (noting that \u201c[section 1229c specifically precludes review of a denial of a request for voluntary departure .... [and][l]ikewise, the general judicial review provision precludes review of orders granting voluntary departure\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b275-12\">Next, we have reviewed the record and the Board\u2019s decision and find that the Board did not abuse its discretion in denying Ndiaye\u2019s motion to reconsider. <em>See </em>8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1003.2(a) (2006); <em>INS v. Doherty, </em>502 U.S. 314, 323-24, 112 S.Ct. 719, 116 L.Ed.2d 823 (1992); <em>Jean v. Gonzales, </em>435 F.3d 475, 481 (4th Cir.2006). We therefore deny the petition for review for the reasons stated by the Board. <em>See In Re: Ndiaye, </em>No. A97-165-161 (B.I.A. Dec. 13, 2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b275-14\">We accordingly deny the petition for review. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b275-15\">\n<em>PETITION DENIED</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
