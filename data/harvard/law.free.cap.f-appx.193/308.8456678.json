As his sole point of error on appeal, Godin argues that under <em>Blakely v. Washington, </em>542 U.S. 296, 124 S.Ct. 2531, 159 L.Ed.2d 403 (2004), and the Sixth Amendment, only the facts admitted by him in conjunction with his guilty plea should have been used to enhance his sentencing range.</p>\n<p id=\"b330-21\">Under <em>United States v. Booker, </em>543 U.S. 220, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005), where a defendant\u2019s sentencing range is increased based on facts not found by a jury or admitted by the defendant, the sentence violates the Sixth Amendment. <em>United States v. Cain, </em>440 F.3d 672, 676 (5th Cir.2006). Because Godin preserved his Sixth Amendment argument for review on appeal by raising a <em>Blakely </em>objection in the district court, our review is for harmless error. <em>See United States v. Pineiro, </em>410 F.3d 282, 285-86 (5th Cir.2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b330-22\">There is nothing in the record that would support a determination that the district court would have imposed the same sentence absent its reliance, for sen<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"309\">*309</page-number>tencing guideline enhancement purposes, on facts not found by a jury nor found beyond a reasonable doubt and not admitted by the defendant. <em>Id. </em>The government concedes it cannot make the requisite showing of harmlessness. Accordingly, Godin\u2019s sentence is VACATED and the case is REMANDED for resentencing.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b330-23\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5 the Court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir.
