The City then moved for dismissal of Taurus\u2019s lawsuit or, in the alternative, summary judgment on the grounds that Taurus\u2019s challenges were moot. A magistrate judge held a hearing on Taurus\u2019s motion for a preliminary injunction and the City\u2019s motion for dismissal or, in the alternative, summary judgment. The magistrate judge\u2019s findings and his recommendations (that Taurus\u2019s motion for preliminary injunction be denied, that the City\u2019s motion for dismissal be granted in part on the basis of mootness, and that Taurus\u2019s claims for damages be stayed until resolution of another case in this court) were adopted in their entirety by the district court. Taurus appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b848-22\">This court has jurisdiction to consider the appeal of the denial of a preliminary injunction pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1292(1).</p>\n<p id=\"b848-23\">Taurus\u2019s argument that the amended ordinance is void <em>ab initio </em>is not supported <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"827\">*827</page-number>by record evidence demonstrating that the process by which the ordinance was enacted was legally deficient. Therefore, Taurus\u2019s claims for equitable relief that seek a declaration that the old ordinance is unconstitutional and an injunction preventing the City from enforcing the old ordinance against Taurus or, in the alternative, requiring the City to issue Taurus a permit under the old ordinance are moot.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> <em>See Coral Springs Street Systems, Inc. v. City of Sunrise, </em>371 F.3d 1320, 1328 (11th Cir.2004) (\u201c \u2018[wjhen a subsequent law brings the existing controversy to an end the case becomes moot and should be treated accordingly.\u2019 \u201d) (quoting <em>Coalition for the Abolition of Marijuana Prohibition v. City of Atlanta, </em>219 F.3d 1301, 1310 (11th Cir.2000)). We find no error in the district court\u2019s adoption of the magistrate judge\u2019s holding that no exceptions to the mootness doctrine apply because Taurus had no vested right to a permit under the old ordinance, as a result of either equitable estoppel or bad faith action on behalf of the City. <em>(See </em>R.2-59 at 8-9; R.2-62.) Thus, the district court properly dismissed as moot all claims for equitable relief under the old ordinance, and that dismissal is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b849-5\">The district court stayed Taurus\u2019s suit for damages until release of this court\u2019s en banc opinion in <em>Tanner Advertising Group, LLC, v. Fayette County, Georgia, </em>451 F.3d 777 (11th Cir.2006) (en banc). <em>Tanner </em>has now been decided by the en banc court. The case is remanded to the district court for further proceeding consistent with this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b849-6\">AFFIRMED AND REMANDED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b849-23\">. This holding resolves the jurisdictional question that was carried with this case.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
