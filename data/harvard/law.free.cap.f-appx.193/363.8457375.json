She appeals the imposition of two consecutive nine-month prison terms following the revocation of supervised release. She argues that the district court erroneously believed that the policy statements of the Sentencing Guidelines required or encouraged the court to impose consecutive sentences and that the court reversibly erred in imposing her revocation sentence because the circumstances do not warrant consecutive sentences.</p>\n<p id=\"b385-22\">Smith has not established that her sentence was imposed in violation of law. The total 18-month term of imprisonment imposed on revocation of supervised release did not exceed the statutory maximum. <em>See </em>18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3583(e)(3). Accordingly, the revocation sentence was neither \u201cunreasonable\u201d nor \u201cplainly unreasonable.\u201d <em>See United States v. Hinson, </em>429 F.3d 114, 120 (5th Cir.2005), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. \u2014, 126 S.Ct. 1804, 164 L.Ed.2d 540 (2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b385-25\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b385-18\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
