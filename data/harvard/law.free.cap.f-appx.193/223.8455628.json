Perdue was sentenced to the statutory mandatory minimum term as an armed career criminal, under 18 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 924(e)(1) (West Supp.2006), to 180 months of imprisonment. On appeal, Per-due asserts that his sentence as an armed career criminal violates the Double Jeopardy clause.</p>\n<p id=\"b246-8\">Perdue\u2019s argument is foreclosed by <em>United States v. Presley, </em>52 F.3d 64 (4th Cir.1995), in which this court held that the Armed Career Criminal Act does not violate the Double Jeopardy Clause. Nor does the use of prior convictions to enhance a defendant\u2019s sentence violate the holding in <em>United States v. Booker, </em>543 U.S. 220, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005). <em>See United States v. Thompson, </em>421 F.3d 278 (4th Cir.2005) (noting that, where the defendant does not dispute any facts related to his prior convictions, the district court\u2019s determination of the criminal history category does not violate the Sixth Amendment), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. \u2014, 126 S.Ct. 1463, 164 L.Ed.2d 250 (2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b246-11\">We therefore affirm Perdue\u2019s sentence. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b246-13\">\n<em>AFFIRMED</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
