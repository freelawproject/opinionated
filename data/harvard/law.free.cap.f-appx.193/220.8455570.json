R. Crim. P. 35(b). We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b242-21\">Wright pled guilty pursuant to a plea agreement that contained a provision whereby the Government would \u201cmove the Court to depart from the United States Sentencing Guidelines, pursuant to \u00a7 5K1.1 of those Guidelines, and Title 18, United States Code, Section 3553(e) and/or move the Court for reduction of sentence pursuant to Rule 35(b) of the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure.\u201d Wright asserts that prior to sentencing, the Government approached him, explaining that his assistance was not complete until his co-defendants had been apprehended and convicted. Wright further alleges that the Government promised to file a Rule 35(b) motion if Wright\u2019s co-defendants were captured and pled or were found guilty within one year after his sentence. Wright claims that because this motion has not been filed, the Government has breached the plea agreement. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b242-22\">On the day of Wright\u2019s sentencing, the Government filed a Motion for Downward Departure pursuant to USSG \u00a7 5K1.1 and 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(e) (2000), that requested <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"221\">*221</page-number>the court to depart downward in response to Wright\u2019s substantial assistance. The motion noted that Wright\u2019s cooperation was responsible for the decision of \u201cfive of his co-defendants to plead \u2018guilty\u2019 to the conspiracy charges contained in the indictment.\u201d We conclude the plea agreement required no more. By its explicit terms, the agreement simply did not obligate the Government to file a Rule 35 motion regardless of the extent of Wright\u2019s assistance. Moreover, neither the record nor any other documentation supports Wright\u2019s assertion that the plea agreement was amended to require the Government to file a Rule 35 motion. We therefore find that the Government fully fulfilled its obligations. Accordingly, we affirm. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b243-5\">\n<em>AFFIRMED.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
