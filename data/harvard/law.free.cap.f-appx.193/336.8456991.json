He argues that the district court erred in holding that he failed to state a claim under the Equal Protection Clause. Burden\u2019s motion to file a supplemental reply brief is granted.</p>\n<p id=\"b358-23\">Affording the dismissal the requisite de novo review, <em>Geiger v. lowers, </em>404 F.3d 371, 373 (5th Cir.2005), we hold that Burden has failed to allege facts that would tend to show that he was intentionally treated differently from similarly situated clients of the treatment program without a rational basis for the distinction. <em>See Vil</em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"337\">*337</page-number><em>lage of Willowbrook v. Olech, </em>528 U.S. 562, 564, 120 S.Ct. 1073, 145 L.Ed.2d 1060 (2000). He has therefore indeed failed to state an equal protection claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b359-5\">Burden\u2019s appeal presents no \u201cexceptional circumstances,\u201d and his motion for appointment of counsel is therefore denied. <em>Ulmer v. Chancellor, </em>691 F.2d 209, 212 (5th Cir.1982). Because his appeal is without arguable merit, it is dismissed. <em>See </em>5th Cir. R. 42.2; <em>Howard v. King, </em>707 F.2d 215, 219-20 (5th Cir.1983).</p>\n<p id=\"b359-6\">Burden is cautioned that the dismissal of this appeal as frivolous counts as a strike for purposes of 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(g), in addition to the strike for the district court\u2019s dismissal. <em>See Adepegba v. Hammons, </em>103 F.3d 383, 388 (5th Cir.1996). He is further cautioned that if he accumulates three strikes under \u00a7 1915(g), he will not be able to proceed in forma pauperis in any civil action or appeal filed while he is incarcerated or detained in any facility unless he is under imminent danger of serious physical injury. <em>See </em>28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(g).</p>\n<p id=\"b359-7\">APPEAL DISMISSED; MOTION FOR APPOINTMENT OF COUNSEL DENIED; MOTION TO FILE SUPPLEMENTAL REPLY BRIEF GRANTED; SANCTION WARNING ISSUED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b358-12\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
