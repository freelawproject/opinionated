The district court properly transferred the petition to this court. <em>See </em>REAL ID Act, Pub.L. No. 109-13, 119 Stat. 231, 311 (2005); 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252; <em>Rosales v. Bureau of Immigration and Customs Enforcement, </em>426 F.3d 733, 736 (5th Cir.2005), ce<em>rt. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. \u2014, 126 S.Ct. 1055, 163 L.Ed.2d 882 (2006). Pursuant to the REAL ID Act, we consider Rodriguez\u2019s \u00a7 2241 petition as a timely petition for review. <em>See Rosales, </em>426 F.3d at 736.</p>\n<p id=\"b335-12\">Rodriguez asserts that retroactive application of the repeal of Immigration and Nationality Act (INA) \u00a7 212(c), 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1182(c), to his case was impermissible; that the denial of INA \u00a7 212(c) relief to him violates due process; and that the denial of an INA \u00a7 212(c) merits hearing violates his due process. Rodriguez\u2019s arguments are without merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b335-13\">In <em>Hernandez-Castillo v. Moore, </em>436 F.3d 516, 517, 519-20 (5th Cir.), <em>petition for cert. filed, </em>74 U.S.L.W. 3572 (U.S. March 28, 2006) (No. 05-1251), we conclud-</p>\n<p id=\"ARqV\">ed that application of the Illegal Immigration Reform and Immigration Responsibility Act\u2019s repeal of INA \u00a7 212(c) to aliens who, like Rodriguez, went to trial and were convicted of an aggravated felony prior to the repeal of \u00a7 212(c), did not create an impermissible retroactive effect. Additionally, in <em>United States v. Lopez-Ortiz, </em>313 F.3d 225, 230-31 (5th Cir.2002), we held that eligibility for discretionary relief under INA \u00a7 212(c) is not an interest warranting constitutional due process protection.</p>\n<p id=\"b335-18\">Accordingly, Rodriguez\u2019s petition for review is DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b335-14\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
