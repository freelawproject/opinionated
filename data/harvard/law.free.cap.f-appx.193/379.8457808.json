He also asks that his voluntary departure period be either reinstated or extended.</p>\n<p id=\"b401-25\">First, we lack jurisdiction to review the Lozano\u2019s asylum claim because the BIA adopted the immigration judge\u2019s conclusion that the application was time-barred. <em>See </em>8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1158(a)(3). With regard to Lozano\u2019s eligibility for withholding of removal, even if we were to assume arguendo that Lozano suffered past persecution, the facts relied on by the immigration judge rebutted the presumption of future persecution; Lozano was able to relocate to different areas of Colombia to avoid reprisal from the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia (FARC). <em>See </em>8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1208.16(b)(l)(i)(B). Lozano does not challenge the immigration judge\u2019s finding in this regard and has therefore waived its review. <em>See Rodriguez v. INS, </em>9 F.3d 408, 414 n. 15 (5th Cir.1993). In light of the foregoing, the evidence does not compel a finding that he is entitled to withholding of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"380\">*380</page-number>removal. <em>See Efe v. Ashcroft, </em>293 F.3d 899, 906 (5th Cir.2002).</p>\n<p id=\"b402-4\">Similarly, the determination that Lozano is not entitled to relief under the CAT is supported by substantial evidence. <em>See Ontunez-Tursios v. Ashcroft, </em>303 F.3d 341, 353 (5th Cir.2002). Again, even if we were to assume arguendo that Lozano was physically tortured by FARC, the evidence does not support a determination that the Colombian government or public officials sanctioned that abuse, which is necessary to establish eligibility for CAT relief. <em>See </em>8 C.F.R. \u00a7 208.18(a)(1). Finally, we decline Lozano\u2019s request to reinstate or extend the period of voluntary departure. <em>Cf. Bocova v. Gonzales, </em>412 F.3d 257, 266 (1st Cir.2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b402-5\">PETITION DISMISSED IN PART AND DENIED IN PART.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b401-26\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir.
