Troublefield argues that the sentence was unreasonable in light of factors set forth in 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a) and, thus, was in contravention of <em>United States v. Booker, 543 U.S. </em>220, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005). Because the district court\u2019s exercise of discretion was not unreasonable, we AFFIRM.</p>\n<p id=\"b965-16\">I. BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b965-17\">Troublefield pled guilty to one count of conspiracy to distribute, and possess with the intent to distribute, cocaine and cocaine base and to three counts of distribution of cocaine base. Troublefield concedes that the sentence fell within the advisory guidelines range of 135 to 168 months imprisonment for a defendant -with an adjusted offense level of 30 and a criminal history category of IV. He maintains, however, that the district court should have sentenced him to a \u201cterm under the advisory minimum\u201d because he \u201cjust barely\u201d qualified for a criminal history category of IV and because \u201cthe nature of his qualifying offenses were very minor in comparison to [t]he charges\u201d in the present indictment. Appellant\u2019s Br. at 7.</p>\n<p id=\"b965-18\">II. DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b965-19\">We review the ultimate sentence imposed by the district court for reasonableness, and we \u201cconsider the final sentence, in its entirety, in light of the \u00a7 3553(a) factors.\u201d<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> <em>United States v. Valnor, </em>451 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"944\">*944</page-number>F.3d 744, 750 (11th Cir.2006) (citations omitted). \u201cReview for reasonableness is deferential.\u201d <em>United States v. Talley, </em>431 F.3d 784, 788 (11th Cir.2005) (per curiam). We \u201crecognize that there is a range of reasonable sentences from which the district court may choose, and when the district court imposes a sentence within the advisory Guidelines range, we ordinarily will expect that choice to be a reasonable one.\u201d <em>Id. </em>The party challenging the sentence carries the burden of proving that the sentence was unreasonable in light of both the record and the \u00a7 3553(a) factors. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b966-4\">Here, it is undisputed that the district court\u2019s calculation of the Guidelines range was accurate. Thus, the sole issue is whether Troublefield\u2019s 150-month sentence was reasonable in light of the factors set forth in 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a), and we conclude that it was. As an example, the district court noted that Troublefield engaged in criminal drug offenses after getting out of jail following each of his previous convictions and that, therefore, a substantial sentence was needed to deter recidivism and protect the public, each a factor listed in \u00a7 3553(a). Troublefield has failed to show that the sentence imposed was unreasonable.</p>\n<p id=\"b966-5\">III. CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b966-6\">Troublefield has appealed his 150-month sentence stemming from a guilty plea to three counts of distribution and one count of conspiracy to distribute and possess cocaine and cocaine base. Troublefield argued that the sentence was unreasonable in light of factors set forth in 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a) and, thus, in contravention of <em>Booker. </em>We conclude, however, that the district court\u2019s exercise of discretion was not unreasonable. AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b965-14\">. There is no question that the district court followed the appropriate steps to determine Troublefield\u2019s sentence, but we recite the now familiar standard anyway:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AYCh\">After <em>Booker, </em>sentencing requires two steps. First, the district court must consult the Guidelines and correctly calculate the range provided by the Guidelines. Second, the district court must consider several factors to determine a reasonable sentence: (1) the nature and circumstances of the offense and the history and characteristics of the defendant; (2) the need to reflect the seriousness of the offense, to promote respect for the law, and to provide just punishment for the offense; (3) the need for deterrence; (4) the need to protect the public; (5) the need to provide the defendant with needed educational or vocational training or medical care; (6) the kinds of sentences available; (7) the Sentencing Guidelines range; (8) pertinent policy statements of the Sentencing Commission; (9) the need to avoid unwanted sentencing disparities; and (10) the need to provide restitution to victims.</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
