Moreover, Pineda-Prencke argues that he can not safely relocate in Colombia and more likely than not would be persecuted <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"896\">*896</page-number>if he returned to Colombia because the ELN\u2019s threats were consistent and continuous and included threats against his son when he returned to Colombia because the ELN wanted to make Pineda-Prencke pay for his debts.</p>\n<p id=\"b918-4\">When the BIA issues a decision, we review only that decision, except to the extent that the BIA expressly adopts the IJ\u2019s decision. <em>Najjar v. Ashcroft, </em>257 F.3d 1262, 1284 (11th Cir.2001). Thus, we will review the BIA\u2019s and IJ\u2019s factual determinations under the substantial evidence test, and must affirm the decisions if \u201csupported by reasonable, substantial, and probative evidence on the record as a whole.\u201d <em>Al Najjar v. Ashcroft, </em>257 F.3d 1262, 1283-84 (11th Cir.2001) (quotation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b918-5\">An alien who arrives in, or is present in, the United States may apply for asylum. <em>See </em>INA \u00a7 208(a)(1), 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1158(a)(1). The Attorney General has discretion to grant asylum if the alien meets the INA\u2019s definition of a \u201crefugee.\u201d <em>See </em>INA \u00a7 208(b)(1), 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1158(b)(1). A \u201crefugee\u201d is defined as</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b918-6\">any person who is outside any country of such person\u2019s nationality or, in the case of a person having no nationality, is outside any country in which such person last habitually resided, and who is unable or unwilling to return to, and is unable or unwilling to avail himself or herself of the protection of, that country because of <em>persecution or a well-founded fear of persecution on account of </em>race, religion, nationality, membership in a particular social group, or <em>political opinion</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b918-7\">INA \u00a7 101(a)(42)(A), 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1101(a)(42)(A) (emphasis added). The asylum applicant carries the burden of proving statutory \u201crefugee\u201d status. <em>See Al Najjar, </em>257 F.3d at 1284.</p>\n<p id=\"b918-9\">To establish asylum eligibility, the petitioners must, with specific and credible evidence, establish (1) past persecution on account of a statutorily listed factor, such as political opinion or (2) a \u201cwell-founded fear\u201d that the statutorily listed factor will cause such future persecution. 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 208.13(a), (b); <em>Al Najjar, </em>257 F.3d at 1287. If the petitioners demonstrate past persecution, they are presumed to have a well-founded fear of future persecution unless the government can rebut this presumption by showing a fundamental change in circumstances in the country or the ability to avoid future persecution by relocating within the country. 8 C.F.R \u00a7 208.13(b)(1). If the petitioners cannot show past persecution, then they must demonstrate a well-founded fear of future persecution that is both subjectively genuine and objectively reasonable. <em>See Al Najjar, </em>257 F.3d at 1289. The subjective component can be proved \u201cby the applicant\u2019s credible testimony that he or she genuinely fears persecution,\u201d while the objective component \u201ccan be fulfilled either by establishing past persecution or that he or she has a good reason to fear future persecution.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(quotation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b918-10\">Although the INA does not expressly define \u201cpersecution\u201d for purposes of qualifying as a \u201crefugee,\u201d see 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1101(a)(42), we have stated that \u201cpersecution is an extreme concept, requiring more than a few isolated incidents of verbal harassment or intimidation.\u201d <em>Sepulveda v. U.S. Atty. Gen., </em>401 F.3d 1226, 1231 (11th Cir.2005) (quotations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b918-11\">\u201cTo establish the necessary causal connection between the political opinion and the feared persecution, the alien must present specific, detailed facts showing a good reason to fear that he or she will be <em>singled out </em>for persecution on account of such an opinion.\u201d <em>Sepulveda, </em>401 F.3d at 1231 (quotation omitted) (emphasis in orig<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"897\">*897</page-number>inal). Furthermore, we have approved of a \u201ccountry-wide requirement\u201d in which a refugee must first pursue an \u201cinternal resettlement alternative\u201d in their own country, or establish that this is not possible, before seeking asylum here. <em>Mazariegos v. U.S. Atty. Gen., </em>241 F.3d 1320, 1326-27 (11th Cir.2001).</p>\n<p id=\"b919-5\">Moreover, an alien is entitled to withholding of removal under the INA if he or she can show that his or her life or freedom would be threatened on account of race, religion, nationality, membership in a particular social group, or political opinion. <em>Mendoza v. U.S. Atty. Gen., </em>327 F.3d 1283, 1287 (11th Cir.2003); <em>see also </em>INA \u00a7 241(b)(3), 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1231(b)(3). As a general rule, however, if \u201can applicant is unable to meet the \u2018well-founded fear\u2019 standard for asylum, he is generally precluded from qualifying for either asylum or withholding of deportation.\u201d <em>Al Najjar, </em>257 F.3d at 1292-93 (quotation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b919-6\">Upon review of the record and the parties\u2019 briefs, we discern no reversible error. In this case, substantial evidence supports the BIA\u2019s and IJ\u2019s findings that Pineda-Prencke did not suffer past persecution on account of his political opinion, and thus, was not eligible for asylum on that basis. Pineda-Prencke sets forth the following incidents in which the ELN threatened him either by telephone or mail: (1) when he worked for the telephone company; (2) when the ELN sabotaged the event he organized on behalf of the community and vandalized his car; (3) when he made known his aspirations to run for city councilman; (4) when the ELN placed a sand cross in front of his home, flattened four tires on his car, and told him that the cross represented his and his family\u2019s graves; and (5) when his son and daughter were robbed upon their return to Colombia from the United States and his son received a telephone call from the ELN threatening him.</p>\n<p id=\"b919-8\">All of the incidents alleged by Pineda-Prencke, either individually or as whole, are distressing, but do not amount to persecution under the statute because they only involved threats with a few incidents of vandalism, and persecution is an extreme concept, requiring more than a few isolated incidents of verbal harassment or intimidation. <em>See Sepulveda, </em>401 F.3d at 1231. Moreover, neither Pineda-Prencke nor any of his family members were ever physically harmed. Also, the connection between some of the alleged incidents and the ELN is tenuous. For example, Pineda-Prencke failed to present evidence establishing that the robbery of his two older children was connected with ELN threats, rather than just a random act of violence. Moreover, the threats his older son received occurred several months after the robbery and never referred to the incident. Also, Pineda-Prencke failed to present any evidence that he had openly expressed a political opinion against the ELN or any other guerrilla organization. Neither his work with the telephone company nor his donating shoes to the police involved expressing any political opinions, and the only reason the ELN threatened him was because they did not want a telephone system installed that might make the police more accessible and because they mistakenly perceived the police presence at his shoe business as a clue that he was an informant. Moreover, when Pineda-Prencke worked for Solidarity and the Center for Higher Studies (\u201cCES\u201d), he did not express any political opinion, rather, he was either helping to improve the infrastructure of the community or organizing events for the residents. The only incident possibly related to Pineda-Prencka expressing his political opinion was when he made known his aspirations to run, for city council, which he ultimately did not do, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"898\">*898</page-number>and at no time, while he was deciding whether to run, did he express any opinion as to the ELN. Thus, Pineda-Prencke failed to connect the incidents to any substantial political activity and as a result, he failed to establish that he suffered past persecution on account of his political opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b920-4\">Likewise, substantial evidence supports the IJ\u2019s finding that Pineda-Prencke failed to establish a well-founded fear of future persecution in Colombia. As stated above, neither Pineda-Prencke nor his family were harmed prior to moving to the United States. Moreover, Pineda-Prencke failed to establish that the police were unable or unwilling to protect him and his family, Pineda-Prencke only filed a police report on one occasion and he never followed up with them. Additionally, even though the most recent country report from 2002 stated that the ELN is the second largest guerilla force in Colombia, the report also asserted that the ELN proclaimed support for peaceful resolutions, and since ELN\u2019s terrorist and criminal activities often affected civilians indiscriminately, the group had negligible popular support. Lastly, Pineda-Prencke never attempted to relocate internally, rather he moved to a different address within the same city. <em>See Mazariegos, </em>241 F.3d at 1326-27. Pineda-Prencke relies on the 2002 United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (\u201cUNHCR\u201d) report and the INS\u2019s reply to an inquiry about relocating in Colombia for the proposition that it was not viable for him to relocate within Colombia. However, the UNHCR report specifically referred to those asylum seekers who faced a serious risk of persecution as outlined under the CAT<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> and the INS\u2019s inquiry referred to asylum seekers who were specifically targeted not by one guerrilla group, as Pineda-Prencka was, and were consequently subject to threats from multiple groups located throughout Colombia. <em>(See </em>AR at 258-61).</p>\n<p id=\"b920-7\">Because Pineda-Prencke failed to establish past persecution or a well-founded fear of future persecution sufficient to support his asylum claim, as discussed above, he cannot establish that he is eligible for withholding of removal under the INA. <em>See Al Najjar, </em>257 F.3d at 1292-93. Thus, Pineda-Prencke failed to meet the burden of proof required for asylum and withholding of removal relief. Based on the foregoing, we deny his petition.</p>\n<p id=\"b920-8\">PETITION DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b917-14\">. Family members are \"derivatives\u201d as that term is used in 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 207.7 and will be granted asylum if Pineda-Prencke is granted asylum. <em>See abo </em>8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1158(b)(3)(A)(stating that \"[a] spouse or child of an alien who is granted asylum under this subsection may, if not otherwise eligible for asylum under this section, be granted the same status as the alien if accompanying, or following to join, such alien\u201d) (internal citations omitted).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"Ald3\">. It is clear from the issue on appeal and the law cited in Pineda-Prencke\u2019s appellate brief that he is only arguing the denial of his asylum and withholding of removal under the INA and does not challenge the dismissal of his withholding of removal under the United Nations Convention Against Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment (\"CAT\u201d). (See <em>generally </em>appellants\u2019 brief). His claim under CAT is thus deemed waived.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b920-5\">. To obtain relief under the CAT, the burden is on the applicant to establish that it is \"more likely than not\u201d she will be tortured in the country of removal. 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 208.16(c)(2).
