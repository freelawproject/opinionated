We review for substantial evidence the Board\u2019s finding that the Attorney General established by clear and convincing evidence, 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1229a(c)(3)(A) (2000); 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1240.8(a) (2006), that Uzoka was removable under 8 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 1227(a)(1)(A), (B) (West 2000 <em>&amp; </em>Supp. 2006), for seeking to procure a benefit under the Immigration and Naturalization Act by fraud or willful misrepresentation of a material fact and for overstaying his visa.</p>\n<p id=\"b274-9\">Having reviewed the decision of the Board and the administrative record, we conclude that the Attorney General sustained his burden of proof on both charges. We reject Uzoka\u2019s claim that he was denied due process by a former counsel\u2019s ineffective assistance, finding, as the Board did, that Uzoka did not substantially comply with the notice requirement of <em>Matter of Lozada, </em>19 I. <em>&amp; </em>N. Dec. 637 (B.I.A. 1988). Further, we agree with the Board that Uzoka would be unable to establish the prejudice necessary to sustain his due process claim, <em>see Rusu v. INS, </em>296 F.3d 316, 324 (4th Cir.2002) (holding that an alien, to prevail on an allegation of denial of due process, must establish prejudice from that violation), if we addressed the claim on its merits.</p>\n<p id=\"b274-11\">Accordingly, we deny the petition for review. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b274-12\">\n<em>PETITION DENIED</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
