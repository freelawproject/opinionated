At sentencing, the court imposed an eighty-three-month sentence. Ensminger appeals his sentence, arguing that the district court erred in determining that his prior North Carolina state conviction for involuntary manslaughter constituted a \u201ccrime of violence\u201d under <em>U.S. Sentencing Guidelines Manual </em>\u00a7\u00a7 2K2.1(a)(2), 4B1.2 (2004).</p>\n<p id=\"b221-7\">Whether a particular state offense is a federal crime of violence is a question of law reviewed de novo. <em>United States v. Pierce, </em>278 F.3d 282, 286 (4th Cir.2002). In <em>United States v. Payton, </em>28 F.3d 17 (1994), this court considered whether the defendant\u2019s South Carolina conviction for involuntary manslaughter constituted a \u201ccrime of violence\u201d for purposes of sentencing enhancement under USSG \u00a7\u00a7 2K2.1(a)(2), 4B1.2. The court noted that commentary to the USSG \u00a7 4B1.2 clearly listed manslaughter as a \u201ccrime of violence.\u201d <em>Payton, 28 </em>F.3d at 19. The court concluded that, although the commentary does not differentiate between involuntary and voluntary manslaughter, it includes both. <em>Id. </em>Accordingly, Ensminger\u2019s argument is foreclosed by <em>Payton.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b221-8\">We vacate Ensminger\u2019s sentence and remand to the district court, however, on a different basis. At sentencing, based on Ensminger\u2019s offense level and criminal history category, the Guidelines range was seventy-seven months to ninety-six months of imprisonment. The transcript of the sentencing proceedings reflects that the district court imposed a sentence of eighty-three months of imprisonment. The written judgment, however, states that Ensminger was sentenced to seventy-seven months of imprisonment. \u201c[T]he sentences to be served ... are those pronounced in the defendant\u2019s presence in open court and not those set out in the written judgments of the court.\u201d <em>Rakes v. United States, </em>309 F.2d 686, 687 (4th Cir.1962). Thus, the written judgment in the instant case should reflect the district court\u2019s oral pronouncement at sentencing. The remedy is to vacate the judgment and remand to the district court for the purpose of correcting the written judgment to conform to the oral sentence. <em>See id. </em>at 688; <em>see also United States v. Morse, </em>344 F.2d 27, 30, 31 n. 1 (4th Cir.1965) (the court \u201cshould carry out the true intention of the sentencing judge as this may be gathered from what he said at the time of sentencing\u201d); Fed.R.Crim.P. 36 (\u201cAfter giving any notice it considers appropriate, the court may at any time correct a clerical error in a judgment, order, or other part of the record, or correct an error in the record arising from oversight or omission.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b221-10\">Accordingly, we vacate the district court\u2019s judgment and remand for the limited purpose of having the district court reenter a written judgment conforming to the oral pronouncement at sentencing. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b221-11\">\n<em>VACATED AND REMANDED.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
