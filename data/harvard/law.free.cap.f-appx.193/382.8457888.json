Ybarra argues that the district court\u2019s written judgments of revocation conflict with the district court\u2019s oral pronouncement of sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b404-21\">After revoking Ybarra\u2019s terms of supervised release in both cases, the district court imposed a 12-month imprisonment term in both cases. At the sentencing hearing the district court specifically stated that the imprisonment terms were to run concurrently. However, the written judgment in the escape case states that the term is to run consecutively to the imprisonment term in the misprision case. The written judgment in the misprision case is silent regarding whether the term is concurrent or consecutive. Thus, the district court\u2019s oral pronouncement of concurrent sentences conflicts with the written judgments, which, when read together, require the imprisonment terms to run consecutively.</p>\n<p id=\"b404-22\">Therefore, because the language of the district court\u2019s oral pronouncement of sentence conflicts with its written judgments with regard to the concurrent nature of the sentences, the cases are remanded for the district court to amend the written judgments to conform to the district court\u2019s oral pronouncement of sentence. <em>See United States v. Martinez, </em>250 F.3d 941, 942 (5th Cir.2001).</p>\n<p id=\"b404-23\">REMANDED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b404-17\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir.
