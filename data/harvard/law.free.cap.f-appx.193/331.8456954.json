Gay, Jr., Assistant U.S. Attorney, Angela S. Raba, U.S. Attorney\u2019S Office, Western District of Texas, San Antonio, TX, for Plaintiff-Appellee.</attorneys>\n<attorneys data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b354-13\">Nancy Gosnell Revelette, EL Paso, TX, for Defendant-Appellant.</attorneys>\n<judges data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"judges\" id=\"b354-15\">Before DAVIS, BARKSDALE, and BENAVIDES, Circuit Judges.</judges>\n<opinion data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b354-16\">PER CURIAM: <footnotemark>*</footnotemark></author>\n<p id=\"b354-17\">In this consolidated appeal, Guillermo Garcia-Duarte challenges his guilty-plea convictions: (1) for attempting to enter, and entering, the United States without permission; and (2) for, on that same day of illegal entry, conspiracy, importation, and possession of 100 kilograms or more of marijuana. The district sentenced GarciaDuarte to concurrent, 120-month terms of imprisonment for each offense.</p>\n<p id=\"b354-18\">For the first time on appeal, GarciaDuarte asserts the district court erred in accepting his guilty plea to the illegal-reentry offense because the Government\u2019s factual basis was insufficient to support the required finding that he \u201centered\u201d the United States free from official restraint. He acknowledges our review is only for plain error. <em>See United States v. Marek, </em>238 F.3d 310, 315 (5th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>534 U.S. 813, 122 S.Ct. 37, 151 L.Ed.2d 11 (2001).</p>\n<p id=\"b354-19\">Although an illegal-entry offense is comprised of both physical presence in the United States and freedom from official restraint, <em>see United States v. Morales-Palacios, </em>369 F.3d 442, 446 (5th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>543 U.S. 825, 125 S.Ct. 159, 160 L.Ed.2d 38 (2004), we decline, especially on plain-error review, to accept GarciaDuarte\u2019s assertion that the Border Patrol Agent\u2019s viewing him through an infrared <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"333\">*333</page-number>unit constituted official restraint. Moreover, because Garcia-Duarte does <em>not </em>contest the sufficiency of the factual basis supporting his guilty plea with respect to his conviction for attempted entry, we reject his contention that the Government\u2019s factual basis was insufficient to support that plea. <em>See United States v. Harvard, </em>103 F.3d 412, 420 (5th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>522 U.S. 824, 118 S.Ct. 82, 139 L.Ed.2d 40 (1997).</p>\n<p id=\"b355-5\">Also for the first time on appeal, Garcia-Duarte asserts the court erred in relying on the \u201chearsay statements\u201d in the modified presentence investigation report (PSR) to enhance his sentence for the illegal-reentry offense, based on his having a prior felony drug-trafficking offense. He does not challenge the fact of the conviction; nor does he assert the conviction was not the kind that could be used to support the enhancement. Rather, he contends the PSR\u2019s recitation of \u201csecondhand\u201d facts describing the prior conviction is the \u201ckind of proof\u2019 that the Supreme Court has found inadequate to support a sentence enhancement. In support, he cites <em>Shepard v. United States, </em>544 U.S. 13, 125 S.Ct. 1254, 161 L.Ed.2d 205 (2005) and <em>Taylor v. United States, </em>495 U.S. 575, 110 S.Ct. 2143, 109 L.Ed.2d 607 (1990).</p>\n<p id=\"b355-6\">In <em>post-Shepard </em>decisions, this court has continued to hold: a district court may rely on information provided in the PSR in making sentencing determinations; and it is the defendant\u2019s burden to show \u201cthe information in the PSR relied on by the district court is materially untrue\u201d. <em>United States v. Betancourt, </em>422 F.3d 240, 248 (5th Cir.2005) (internal quotation omitted). As Garcia-Duarte does <em>not </em>dispute the accuracy of the PSR\u2019s recitation of his prior offense, he has not shown error, plain or otherwise, in the district court\u2019s reliance on the PSR. Further, because he was subject to a mandatory minimum sentence of 120 months of imprisonment, he cannot demonstrate that the district court\u2019s error, if any, affected his substantial rights. <em>See United States v. Ochoa-Cruz, </em>442 F.3d 865, 867 (5th Cir.2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b355-8\">Garcia-Duarte\u2019s constitutional challenge is foreclosed by <em>Almendarez-Torres v. United States, </em>523 U.S. 224, 235, 118 S.Ct. 1219, 140 L.Ed2d 350 (1998). Although he contends <em>Almendarez-Torres </em>was incorrectly decided and a majority of the Supreme Court would overrule it in the light of <em>Apprendi v. New Jersey, </em>530 U.S. 466, 120 S.Ct. 2348, 147 L.Ed.2d 435 (2000), we have repeatedly held it remains binding. <em>See United States v. Garza-Lopez, </em>410 F.3d 268, 276 (5th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. \u2014, 126 S.Ct. 298, 163 L.Ed.2d 260 (2005). Garcia-Duarte concedes his claim is foreclosed in the light of <em>AlmendarezTorres </em>and circuit precedent, but preserves it for further review.</p>\n<p id=\"b355-11\">\n<em>AFFIRMED.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b354-12\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
