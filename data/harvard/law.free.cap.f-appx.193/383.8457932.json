In May 2005, Al-Koba filed a petition under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2241 seeking judicial review of his removal order and alleging for the first time that counsel was ineffective because she failed to notify him of the consequences of failing to appear at his removal hearing and because she filed an untimely notice of appeal to the BIA. Al-Koba\u2019s petition was transferred to this court pursuant to the Real ID Act of 2005, Pub.L. No. 109-13, \u00a7 106(c), 119 Stat. 231, 311 (May 11, 2005), to be treated as a timely petition for review. <em>See Rosales v. Bureau of Immigration and Customs Enforcement, </em>426 F.3d 733, 736 (5th Cir.2005), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. \u2014, 126 S.Ct. 1055, 163 L.Ed.2d 882 (2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b405-24\">This court must consider its jurisdiction to review a case sua sponte if necessary. <em>Goonsuwan v. Ashcroft, </em>252 F.3d 383, 385 (5th Cir.2001). A court can review a final order of removal only when \u201cthe alien has exhausted all administrative remedies available to the alien as of right.\u201d 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(d)(1); <em>Ramirez-Molina v. Ziglar, </em>436 F.3d 508, 514 (5th Cir.2006). Examination of the record confirms that Al-Koba failed to raise his instant claim of ineffective assistance of counsel before the BIA on appeal or in a motion to reopen the proceedings. Consequently, this court lacks jurisdiction to entertain his petition. <em>See Goonsuwan, </em>252 F.3d at 386-90; <em>Roy v. Ashcroft, </em>389 F.3d 132, 137 (5th Cir.2004).</p>\n<p id=\"b405-25\">PETITION DISMISSED FOR LACK OF JURISDICTION.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b405-19\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
