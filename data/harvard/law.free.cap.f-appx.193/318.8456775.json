Gonzales, </em>432 F.3d 339, 344 (5th Cir.2005). When the BIA has adopted the IJ\u2019s decision, as here, we review the IJ\u2019s decision. <em>Williams-Igwonobe v. Gonzales, </em>437 F.3d 453, 455 (5th Cir.2006). The \u201csubstantial evidence\u201d standard requires that the agency decision be based on the record evidence and that the decision be substantially reasonable. <em>Carbajal-Gonzalez v. INS, </em>78 F.3d 194, 197 (5th Cir.1996). Under this standard, the IJ\u2019s determination <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"320\">*320</page-number>will be affirmed unless the \u201cevidence compels a contrary conclusion.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b342-4\">Al Nema has never lived in Iraq. His claim is based almost entirely on his father\u2019s having opposed the Ba'ath Party of Saddam Hussein in the early 1960s. After being tortured by Ba'ath loyalists in 1960, A1 Nema\u2019s family left Iraq for Kuwait, where all but Al Nema and one of A1 Nema\u2019s three sisters (who lives with her husband in Iraq) have since remained. At his hearing before the IJ, Al Nema testified that his father was beaten and tortured by Ba'ath officials in 1972 and 1985, when he returned to Iraq to renew his passport. Al Nema himself testified that, at the age of eight in 1979, he briefly visited Iraq with his grandmother. He stated that he was intimidated, interrogated, and slapped by border-checkpoint officials.</p>\n<p id=\"b342-5\">The IJ\u2019s conclusion that this testimony did not establish a clear probability of persecution, for purposes of A1 Nema\u2019s application for withholding of removal, was supported by substantial evidence. <em>Roy v. Ashcroft, </em>389 F.3d 132, 138-39 (5th Cir.2004); <em>Zhang, </em>432 F.3d at 344. Similarly, the IJ\u2019s determination that Al Nema had not established that he was likely to be tortured in Iraq, for purposes of his CAT claim, was supported by substantial evidence. <em>See Efe v. Ashcroft, </em>293 F.3d 899, 907 (5th Cir.2002). Al Nema failed to show how the decades-old incidents involving his father suggested <em>he, </em>Al Nema, would be persecuted.</p>\n<p id=\"b342-6\">The petition for review is DENIED. A1 Nema\u2019s motion to remand the case to the BIA is also DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b341-15\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
