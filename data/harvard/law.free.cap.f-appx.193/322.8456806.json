After her attorney withdrew from the case White and appellee agreed to settle her claim for $600. Based on this agreement, the court issued a 60 day order on September 12, 2005 to dismiss the case. Approximately 30 days later White moved to set aside the settlement agreement which the district court denied. On December 21, 2004 over 1 year later White filed a notice of appeal. This court dismissed White\u2019s appeal as untimely. On June 7, 2005 White filed a motion for reconsideration of the denial of her appeal with the district court. The district court treated White\u2019s motion as a Rule 60(b) motion for reconsideration of the court\u2019s denial of White\u2019s motion to set aside the settlement agreement and denied the motion. White then filed this appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b344-21\">The only issue before this court is whether the judge abused its discretion in denying White\u2019s motion for reconsideration pursuant to Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 60(b)(6).</p>\n<p id=\"b344-22\">White has filed a one page pro se brief and asserts in a conclusory statement that the settlement was not fair because it provided inadequate compensation for her injuries. This conclusory statement is inadequate to demonstrate that the district court abused its discretion in denying the motion for reconsideration.</p>\n<p id=\"b344-23\">The judgment of the district court is therefore AFFIRMED.</p>\n<p id=\"b344-24\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b344-19\">. Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the Court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
