We note first that Reed asserts that he did not receive timely notice of the district court\u2019s dismissal and that he signed his notice of appeal on the day after he became aware of the dismissal. We pretermit, however, any question concerning Reed\u2019s notice of appeal because this appeal lacks merit. <em>See United States v. Alvarez, </em>210 F.3d 309, 310 (5th Cir.2000).</p>\n<p id=\"b349-18\">\u201cNo action shall be brought with respect to prison conditions under section 1983 of this title, or any other Federal law, by a prisoner confined in any jail, prison, or other correctional facility until such administrative remedies as are available are exhausted.\u201d 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1997e(a). Exhaustion of administrative remedies is \u201cmandatory, \u2018irrespective of the forms of relief sought and offered through administrative avenues.\u2019 \u201d <em>Days v. Johnson, </em>322 F.3d 863, 866 (5th Cir.2003)(quoting <em>Booth v. Churner, </em>532 U.S. 731, 739, 741 n. 6, 121 S.Ct. 1819, 149 L.Ed.2d 958 (2001)).</p>\n<p id=\"b349-23\">Reed devotes the majority of his brief to arguing the merits of his claims, and he abandons the exhaustion issue. <em>See Yohey v. Collins, </em>985 F.2d 222, 224-25 (5th Cir.1993). Further, we conclude from a review of the record that Reed\u2019s pleadings demonstrate that he failed to exhaust his administrative remedies, and the district court did not err in dismissing the complaint. <em>See Days, </em>322 F.3d at 866.</p>\n<p id=\"b349-24\">The appeal is without arguable merit, is frivolous, and is therefore dismissed. <em>See Howard v. King, </em>707 F.2d 215, 220 (5th Cir.1983); 5th Cir. R. 42.2. Reed is cautioned that the dismissal of this appeal as frivolous counts as a strike under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(g) and that if he accumulates three strikes, he will not be able to proceed in forma pauperis (IFP) in any civil action or appeal filed while he is incarcerated or detained in any facility unless he is under imminent danger of serious physical injury. <em>See Adepegba v. Hammons, </em>103 F.3d 383, 388 (5th Cir.1996).</p>\n<p id=\"b349-25\">APPEAL DISMISSED; SANCTION WARNING ISSUED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b349-19\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
