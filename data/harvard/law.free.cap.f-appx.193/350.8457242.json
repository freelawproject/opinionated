Anguiano argues that his crime of indecency with a child by exposure was not an aggravated felony. The respondent argues that we lack jurisdiction under 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(a)(2)(C).</p>\n<p id=\"b373-10\">We have held that, under \u00a7 1252(a)(2)(C), jurisdiction will be precluded when the alien is removable for committing an aggravated felony. <em>See Nehme v. INS, </em>252 F.3d 415, 420 (5th Cir.2001). Anguiano\u2019s conviction under Tex. Penal Code Ann. \u00a7 21.11(a)(2) is an aggravated felony. <em>See United States v. Zavala-Sustaita, </em>214 F.3d 601, 607 (5th Cir.2000). Consequently, we lack jurisdiction to consider his petition. <em>See </em>\u00a7 1252(a)(2)(C); <em>Nehme, </em>252 F.3d at 420. In addition, we lack jurisdiction over the BIA\u2019s \u201cdiscretionary exercise of its power to review and reverse the IJ\u2019s grant of, rather than eligibility for, section 212(c) relief.\u201d <em>See Delgado-Reynua v. Gonzales, </em>450 F.3d 596, 600 (5th Cir.2006)percent. We therefore dismiss this portion of Anguiano\u2019s petition for review.</p>\n<p id=\"b373-15\">Anguiano also argues that the BIA should have remanded the matter to the immigration judge rather than ordering him removed. The BIA did not exceed the scope of its authority in so doing. <em>See Delgado-Reynua, </em>450 F.3d at 600-601. This portion of Anguiano\u2019s petition for review is therefore denied.</p>\n<p id=\"b373-16\">PETITION FOR REVIEW DISMISSED IN PART FOR LACK OF JURISDICTION; DENIED IN PART.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b373-11\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
