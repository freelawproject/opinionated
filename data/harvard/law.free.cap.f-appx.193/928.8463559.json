Defendant claims that the district court abused its discretion in refusing to award attorney\u2019s fees because it erred as a matter of law in finding that the appellee\u2019s lawsuit did not meet the frivolity standards of applicable case law.</p>\n<p id=\"b951-15\">Appellant misconstrues the nature of the district court\u2019s order. The district court did not commit error as a matter of law. On the contrary, the district court accurately stated the applicable case law, and the decision to deny the motion was an exercise of the district court\u2019s broad discretion to determine whether a prevailing party should be awarded attorney\u2019s fees. Having reviewed the record and the pleadings of the parties in the case, the district court reasoned that appellee\u2019s \u201ccontinued pursuit of his employment discrimination claim\u201d was not so unreasonable as to satisfy the governing standards of frivolity. This was an interpretation of the facts and circumstances surrounding the case, not an erroneous application or interpretation of the applicable case law. In light of the evidence, especially that with respect to comparator Kronsperger, we conclude that the district court did not abuse its discretion. Accordingly, the order of the district court must be</p>\n<p id=\"AqH\">AFFIRMED.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b951-16\">.
