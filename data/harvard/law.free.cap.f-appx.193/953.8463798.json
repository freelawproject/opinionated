First he argues that the district court erred in denying a minor-role reduction, pursuant to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3B1.2, and thereby frustrated Congressional and the Sentencing Commission\u2019s intent to give low-level participants in a drug trafficking offense reduced sentences. He also argues that the district court imposed unreasonable 135-month concurrent sentences because it failed to <em>sua sponte </em>consider that he faced a harsher sentence than similarly situated defendants, due to his illegal-alien status.</p>\n<p id=\"b976-15\">We find no clear error in the district court\u2019s determination that, with the exception of the captain of vessel, the remaining crew members played equal roles in transporting over 550 kilograms of cocaine, and that Ortega-Correra was equally responsible as the other crew members who helped transport the drugs. Thus, the court did not clearly err in denying the minor-role reduction.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b976-16\">Ortega-Correra also argues that his sentences are unreasonable, and, as grounds, argues for the first time that he was forced, \u201cthrough no action or fault of his own,\u201d into illegal-alien status that will cause him to \u201cface more time in prison than the average offender committing the same crime ... not [be] entitled to ... community confinement [at the end of his sentence], ... remain in prison, and in a higher level of security and restriction than similar offenders.\u201d He also argues that his sentences do not comport with the Supreme Court\u2019s edict in <em>United States v. Booker, </em>543 U.S. 220, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005), in that the district <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"955\">*955</page-number>court failed to give \u201cheightened attentiveness\u201d to factors listed in 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a), including whether the sentence was \u201csufficient but not greater than necessary\u201d and would \u201cavoid unwarranted sentence disparities.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b977-5\">On this record, we do not find the 135-month concurrent sentences unreasonable. First, the court was not required to explicitly consider each \u00a7 3553(a) factor, but did consider such factors as the large amount of drugs on the boat, and Ortega-Correra\u2019s role as a crew member. <em>See U.S. v. Scott, </em>426 F.3d 1324, 1329-30 (11th Cir.2005); <em>see also </em>18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a)(1)-(2) (factors to be considered include the nature, circumstances, and seriousness of the offense). Ortega-Correra\u2019s 135-month sentences were at the low end of the advisory Guidelines range, and significantly less than the statutory-maximum sentence of life imprisonment. <em>See U.S. v. Martinez, </em>434 F.3d 1318, 1322 (11th Cir.2006) (sentence at low end of the range and far below the statutory maximum sentence was not unreasonable).</p>\n<p id=\"b977-6\">Moreover, Ortega-Correra\u2019s argument, based on his illegal-alien status and raised for the first time on appeal, must also fail. Because the court was not required to discuss each \u00a7 3553(a) factor, <em>see Scott, </em>426 F.3d at 1329-30, it did not plainly err in failing to <em>sua sponte </em>discuss whether Ortega-Correra faced a harsher sentence due to his illegal-alien status. Ortega-Correra\u2019s argument, with only vague mention and citation of the Bureau of Prisons\u2019 policy statements, simply does not meet his burden of proving plain error or that his sentences are unreasonable. <em>See U.S. v. Barfield, </em>396 F.3d 1144, 1150 (11th Cir.2005); <em>see also U.S. v Talley, </em>431 F.3d 784, 788 (11th Cir.2005) (the burden rests with the defendant to prove unreasonableness). Upon review of the record and consideration of both parties\u2019 briefs, we discern no reversible error.</p>\n<p id=\"b977-8\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b976-12\">. We likewise reject Ortega-Correra\u2019s secondary argument, based on alleged frustration of Congressional and the Sentencing Commission\u2019s intent to give low-level participants in drug trafficking offenses lower sentences.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
