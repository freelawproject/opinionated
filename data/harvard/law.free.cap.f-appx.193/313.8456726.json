Perez asserts that he is the victim of persecution by a gang, the Mara Salvatrueha (MS), and that he has a well-founded fear of future persecution because of his membership in a social group consisting of young Salvadoran males. Perez contends that the evidence shows that he refused to join the MS, that the MS was aware of his opposition, that the MS had the power to punish its enemies, and that the MS was inclined to punish him. He contends that two threatening letters and an incident when he was as<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"315\">*315</page-number>saulted and threatened in a school bathroom show that he was the victim of persecution.</p>\n<p id=\"b337-5\">\u201cAlthough this Court generally reviews decisions of the BIA, not immigration judges, it may review an immigration judge\u2019s decision when, as here, the BIA affirms without additional explanation.\u201d <em>Moin v. Ashcroft, </em>335 F.3d 415, 417 (5th Cir.2003). \u201c[Tjhis Court must affirm the decision if there is no error of law and if reasonable, substantial, and probative evidence on the record, considered as a whole, supports the decision\u2019s factual findings.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Under this standard, \u201cthe alien must show that the evidence is so compelling that no reasonable factfinder could conclude against it.\u201d <em>Chun v. INS, </em>40 F.3d 76, 78 (5th Cir.1994). An IJ\u2019s findings on credibility are accorded \u201cgreat deference.\u201d <em>Efe v. Ashcroft, </em>293 F.3d 899, 904 (5th Cir.2002).</p>\n<p id=\"b337-6\">The Attorney General is authorized, in his discretion, to grant asylum to aliens who qualify as refugees. 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1158(b)(1). An alien is a refugee when he is outside of his country and \u201cis unable or unwilling to return to, and is unable or unwilling to avail himself or herself of the protection of, that country because of persecution or a well-founded fear of persecution on account of race, religion, nationality, membership in a particular social group, or political opinion.\u201d 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1101(a)(42)(A). The term \u201cpersecution\u201d requires a showing by the alien that \u201charm or suffering will be inflicted upon [him] in order to punish [him] for possessing a belief or characteristic a persecutor sought to overcome.\u201d <em>Faddoul v. INS, </em>37 F.3d 185, 188 (5th Cir.1994) (quotation marks omitted). \u201cBecause the level of proof required to establish eligibility for withholding of removal is higher than that required for asylum, failure to establish eligibility for asylum is dispositive of claims for withholding of removal.\u201d <em>Majd v. Gonzales, </em>446 F.3d 590, 595 (5th Cir.2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b337-8\">The immigration judge (IJ) did not err in determining that Perez had not shown that he was persecuted on account of his membership in a particular social group. \u201cTo establish that he is a member of a \u2018particular social group,\u2019 an applicant must show that he was a member of a group of persons that share a common immutable characteristic that they either cannot change or should not be required to change because it is \u2018fundamental to their individual identities or consciences.\u2019 \u201d <em>Mwembie v. Gonzales, </em>443 F.3d 405, 414-15 (5th Cir.2006). The characteristics of youth, nationality, and gender are too generalized and do not provide a meaningful basis for distinguishing Perez from other persons\u2014they lack particularity and are overbroad. <em>See Sanchez-Trujillo v. INS, </em>801 F.2d 1571, 1576-77 (9th Cir.1986).</p>\n<p id=\"b337-9\">The IJ found that Perez\u2019s testimony was not credible. Although discrepancies in Perez\u2019s testimony may have involved insignificant matters, as Perez suggests, they also provide substantial evidence supporting the IJ\u2019s finding on credibility. <em>See Efe, </em>293 F.3d at 904. Even if credible, Perez\u2019s testimony about the relatively mild incident in the school bathroom and the threatening notes does not compel the conclusion that the IJ erred in determining that Perez had not shown past persecution or a well-founded fear of future persecution. <em>See Majd, </em>446 F.3d at 595. Substantial evidence also supports IJ\u2019s finding that Perez can avoid future difficulties by relocating within El Salvador. <em>See Lopez-Gomez v. Ashcroft, </em>263 F.3d 442, 445 (5th Cir.2001). The petition is DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b336-16\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
