He contends that his procedural due process rights to a full and fair hearing were violated because Attorney Sharif was unfamiliar with the facts of the case and, therefore, unable to develop Alam\u2019s testimony and because Alam himself was ill on the date of the hearing.</p>\n<p id=\"b387-11\">This court reviews the BIA\u2019s affirmance of an Id\u2019s denial of a continuance for abuse of discretion. <em>Witter v. INS, </em>113 F.3d 549, 555-56 (5th Cir.1997). An IJ may grant a continuance upon a showing of good cause. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b387-15\">Alam\u2019s motion for a continuance based on either Attorney Zakaria\u2019s illness or Alam\u2019s \u201ccondition\u201d lacked good cause. Alam had already been granted three continuances. <em>See Bright v. INS, </em>837 F.2d 1330, 1332 (5th Cir.1988). Moreover, Alam\u2019s attorney of record, Ramji, was present at the hearing. <em>See Patel v. INS, </em>803 F.2d 804, 806-07 (5th Cir.1986). Thus, the IJ did not err when it denied the continuance, and Alam\u2019s claim, framed as a due process violation, fails. <em>See Ali v. Gonzales, </em>440 F.3d 678, 680-81 (5th Cir.2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b387-16\">Accordingly, Alam\u2019s petition for review is DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b387-12\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
