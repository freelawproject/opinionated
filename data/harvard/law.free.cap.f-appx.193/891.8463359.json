After careful review, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b914-15\">When the BIA issues an affirmance without opinion, the IJ\u2019s decision becomes the final order subject to review. <em>Mendoza v. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>327 F.3d 1283, 1284 n. 1 (11th Cir.2003). To the extent that the IJ\u2019s decision was based on a legal determination, our review is <em>de novo. Mohammed </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"893\">*893</page-number><em>v. Ashcroft, </em>261 F.Sd 1244, 1247-48 (11th Cir.2001). Factual determinations, however, are reviewed under the \u201chighly deferential substantial evidence test,\u201d which requires us to \u201cview the record in the light most favorable to the [IJ]\u2019s decision and draw all reasonable inferences in favor of that decision.\u201d <em>Adefemi v. Ashcroft, </em>386 F.3d 1022, 1026-27 (11th Cir.2004) <em>(en banc), cert. denied, </em>544 U.S. 1035, 125 S.Ct. 2245, 161 L.Ed.2d 1063 (2005). Under this standard, a denial of asylum may be reversed only if the evidence would compel a reasonable factfinder to find that the requisite fear of persecution exists. <em>See INS v. Elias-Zacarias, </em>502 U.S. 478, 481 n. 1, 112 S.Ct. 812, 815 n. 1, 117 L.Ed.2d 38 (1992); <em>see also Silva v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>448 F.3d 1229, 1236 (11th Cir.2006) (\u201cFindings of fact made by the Immigration Judge may be reversed by this Court only when the record compels a reversal; the mere fact that the record may support a contrary conclusion is not enough to justify a reversal of the administrative findings.\u201d (internal citations and quotations omitted)).</p>\n<p id=\"b915-5\">An alien who arrives in or is present in the United States may apply for asylum. <em>See </em>INA \u00a7 208(a)(1), 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1158(a)(1). The Attorney General has discretion to grant asylum if the alien meets the INA\u2019s definition of a \u201crefugee.\u201d <em>See </em>INA \u00a7 208(b)(1), 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1158(b)(1). A \u201crefugee\u201d is any person who is unwilling to return to his home country or to avail himself of that country\u2019s protection \u201cbecause of persecution or a well-founded fear of persecution on account of race, religion, nationality, membership in a particular social group, or political opinion....\u201d 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1101(a)(42)(A).</p>\n<p id=\"b915-6\">The asylum applicant carries the burden of proving statutory \u201crefugee\u201d status. <em>See Al Najjar v. Ashcroft, </em>257 F.3d 1262, 1284 (11th Cir.2001); 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 208.13(a). The applicant satisfies this burden by showing, with specific and credible evidence: (1) past persecution on account of a statutorily listed factor, or (2) a \u201cwell-founded fear\u201d that his or her statutorily listed factor will cause future persecution. 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 208.13(a), (b); <em>Al Najjar, </em>257 F.3d at 1287. \u201cTo establish asylum based on past persecution, the applicant must prove (1) that [ ]he was persecuted, and (2) that the persecution was on account of a protected ground.\u201d <em>Silva, </em>448 F.3d at 1236 (citations omitted). \u201cTo establish eligibility for asylum based on a well-founded fear of future persecution, the applicant must prove (1) a \u2018subjectively genuine and objectively reasonable\u2019 fear of persecution, that is (2) on account of a protected ground.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b915-8\">We have held that \u201c[a]n imputed political opinion, whether <em>correctly </em>or incorrectly attributed, may constitute a ground for a well-founded fear of political persecution within the meaning of the INA.\u201d <em>Al Najjar, </em>257 F.3d at 1289 (quotation omitted). \u201cAn asylum applicant may prevail on a theory of imputed political opinion if he shows that the persecutor falsely attributed an opinion to him, and then persecuted him because of that mistaken belief about his views.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(alterations and quotations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b915-9\">In the context of forcible recruitment, \u201cthe mere existence of a generalized \u2018political\u2019 motive underlying the guerrillas\u2019 forced recruitment is inadequate to establish (and, indeed, goes far to refute) the proposition that [the petitioner] fears persecution <em>on account </em>of political opinion, as [INA] \u00a7 101(a)(42) requires.\u201d <em>Elias-Zacarias, </em>502 U.S. at 482, 112 S.Ct. 812. It is not enough to show that the petitioner was or will be persecuted due simply to his refusal to cooperate with the guerillas. <em>See id. </em>at 483, 112 S.Ct. 812 (holding that persecution due to a refusal to join forces <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"894\">*894</page-number>with the guerillas is not persecution on account of a political opinion).</p>\n<p id=\"b916-4\">Here, substantial evidence supports the IJ\u2019s denial of asylum, as Vargas-Molina failed to present facts that demonstrated his entitlement to relief. Although Vargas-Molina alleged that on several occasions he was approached and threatened by AUC paramilitaries because he refused to join their group or cooperate with them in their objectives, he failed to state, let alone present evidence on, a political opinion, either in fact or imputed, in support of asylum. At best, the record shows that Vargas-Molina stated that he did not want to join the AUC because he was not a bad person and asked to be left alone. He did not testify about a political opinion or membership in a social group, and he offered no evidence that the AUC knew of his political opinions or would persecute him because of his political opinions, rather than just his failure to comply with their demands.</p>\n<p id=\"b916-5\">Vargas-Molina also failed to establish that he was targeted for recruitment by the AUC because of his membership in a particular social group. Vargas-Molina presented evidence that the AUC targets children under the age of 18 and former military personnel for recruitment. Although Vargas-Molina asserted that he was a target because he was an intelligent young man, this fact alone is insufficient to establish membership in a particular social group as defined by the INA. <em>See Matter of Vigil, </em>19 I. &amp; N. Dec. 572, 574 (BIA 1988) (rejecting argument that young men in certain countries constitute a particular social group when it comes to guerilla recruitment). In fact, Vargas-Molina does not fit within the age range of the target population since he began to receive threats from the AUC in 2002, when he was 28 years old.</p>\n<p id=\"b916-6\">In short, the record indicates that the threats Vargas-Molina experienced were based on his refusal to cooperate and join forces with the AUC, which, without more, is insufficient to establish persecution. <em>See Elias-Zacarias, </em>502 U.S. at 483, 112 S.Ct. 812. Vargas-Molina has not met his burden to show that the record compels a finding that he suffered past persecution, or that he had a well-founded fear of future persecution, based on his membership in a group protected under the INA, rather than solely on account of his refusal to cooperate. Accordingly, we deny the petition for review.</p>\n<p id=\"b916-7\">PETITION DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b914-8\">. Because we find that Vargas-Molina has not established a case for asylum under the INA, we do not address his arguments that he also satisfied the higher standard for withholding of removal under the INA. <em>See Al Najjar </em>v. <em>Ashcroft, </em>257 F.3d 1262, 1292-93 (11th Cir.2001).</p>\n<p id=\"AVt\">Pursuant to INA \u00a7 242(d)(1), 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(d)(1), this Court may only review a final order of removal if \"the alien has exhausted all administrative remedies available to the alien as of right.\" Thus, the failure to raise a claim with the BIA prevents this Court from exercising jurisdiction over it. <em>See Fernandez-Bernal </em>v. <em>Att\u2019y Gen. of the U.S., </em>257 F.3d 1304, 1317 n. 13 (11th Cir.2001). In order to raise a claim before the BIA properly, the alien must mention the issue in his brief and must discuss its merits, or at least the basis for the IJ\u2019s decision. <em>See Alim v. Gonzales, </em>446 F.3d 1239, 1253 (11th Cir.2006). Vargas-Molina did not appeal to the BIA from the denial of relief under the United Nations Convention Against Torture and Other Cruel, Inhumane or Degrading Treatment or Punishment (\"CAT\u201d), and therefore we lack jurisdiction to review that claim.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
