During the course of the litigation, Randolph\u2019s claims against St. Tammany Parish President Kevin Davis, the St. Tammany Parish Consolidated Government, the St. Tammany Parish Sheriff\u2019s Office, Peter Galvin, Warden Marlin Peachey, and Farrell Crandle were dismissed. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"294\">*294</page-number>Following the dismissal of his claims against Strain, Randolph appealed.</p>\n<p id=\"b316-4\">Randolph argues that the magistrate judge <footnotemark>**</footnotemark> erred by granting Strain\u2019s motion for summary judgment because he presented sufficient facts to support his claims. He also seeks leave to supplement the record on appeal to include evidence not before the magistrate judge.</p>\n<p id=\"b316-5\">Randolph\u2019s motion to supplement the record on appeal is denied. <em>See Theriot v. Parish of Jefferson, </em>185 F.3d 477, 491 n. 26 (5th Cir.1999). Randolph has not briefed any issues related to the dismissal of any defendant, except Strain. By failing to brief any issues related to the dismissals of the other defendants, he has abandoned these issues on appeal. <em>See Yohey v. Collins, </em>985 F.2d 222, 224-25 (5th Cir.1993).</p>\n<p id=\"b316-6\">A review of the record shows that Randolph failed to allege facts sufficient to establish that Strain was deliberately indifferent to Randolph\u2019s safety. Accordingly, Randolph failed to establish that Strain failed to protect him. <em>See Farmer v. Brennan, </em>511 U.S. 825, 833-34, 837, 114 S.Ct. 1970, 128 L.Ed.2d 811 (1994).</p>\n<p id=\"b316-7\">A review of the record also shows that Randolph failed to establish that Strain was deliberately indifferent to Randolph\u2019s serious medical needs. Randolph received medical treatment for the injuries he sustained after he was attacked by another prisoner. His allegations establish nothing more than a disagreement with the medical treatment provided. These allegations are insufficient to state a constitutional claim. <em>See Varnado v. Lynaugh, </em>920 F.2d 320, 321 (5th Cir.1991). Accordingly, the judgment is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b316-9\">JUDGMENT AFFIRMED; MOTION DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b315-16\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir.
