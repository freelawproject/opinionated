In No. 77-1575, plaintiffs challenge the Chronicle\u2019s termination of their distributorship contracts, while in No. 77-2635 they attack the newspaper\u2019s change in its distribution system. In both cases the district court denied plaintiffs\u2019 applications for preliminary injunctions,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> and this appeal followed. 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1292(a)(1).</p>\n<p id=\"b1167-19\">This court\u2019s review of a district court\u2019s grant or denial of a preliminary injunction is extremely narrow in scope. Such a grant or denial lies within the discretion of the district court, whose decision will be overturned only for abuse. A preliminary injunction is an extraordinary remedy, and the boundaries within which the district court must exercise its discretion are clearly marked. The court must find that the moving party has satisfied four prerequisites: (1) substantial likelihood that the movant will eventually prevail on the merits; (2) a showing that the movant will suffer irreparable injury unless the injunction issues; (3) proof that the threatened injury to the movant outweighs whatever damage the proposed injunction may cause the opposing party; and (4) a showing that the injunction, if issued, would not be adverse to the public interest. The movant has the heavy burden of persuading the district court that all four elements are satisfied. <em>Canal Authority v. Callaway, </em>489 F.2d 567 (5 Cir. 1974).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1168-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1108\">*1108</page-number>The district court concluded that there was no showing of irreparable injury by the plaintiffs in No. 77-1575 and that plaintiffs had failed to meet any of the four prerequisites in No. 77-2635. Because we agree with the district court that plaintiffs have not demonstrated that they will suffer irreparable injury unless a preliminary injunction is granted, we find no abuse of discretion and affirm the district court\u2019s decision in both cases. As we said in <em>Callaway, supra, </em>489 F.2d at 573, \u201conly those injuries that cannot be redressed by the application of a judicial remedy after a hearing on the merits can properly justify a preliminary injunction.\u201d <em>See also Lamarca v.
