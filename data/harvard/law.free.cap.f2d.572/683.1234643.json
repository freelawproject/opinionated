East, Senior United States District Judge for the District of Oregon, sitting by designation.</p>\n</footnote>\n<opinion data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b744-4\">PER CURIAM:</author>\n<p id=\"b744-5\">Our reading of the entire transcript of the trial in this case convinces us that Car-reon did not get a fair trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b744-6\">First, the principal witness against Car-reon was one Yerich, a former employee of Garrett Freight Lines. Certain television sets disappeared from Garrett\u2019s custody, and Yerich testified that he and Carreon and another were accomplices in stealing them, Yerich placing the televisions in Car-reon\u2019s truck, which was at the Garrett dock, and Carreon then taking them to his warehouse. If the jury believed Yerich, Car-reon\u2019s guilt was established; if the jury believed Carreon and did not believe Yerich, Carreon would be acquitted. Cross-examination of Yerich was crucial, but it was severely and improperly restricted by the court, mostly on its own motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b744-7\">Garrett had filed a civil action against Yerich, charging him with theft. However, the court refused to let defense counsel show just what that lawsuit was about:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b744-8\">Q. [By defense counsel]: Mr. Yerich, has Garrett Freight Lines filed a civil suit against you?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b744-9\">[Prosecutor]: Objection.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b744-10\">The Court: The objection is overruled.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b744-11\">Again, ladies and gentlemen of the jury, this goes only to the question of bias and prejudice of this witness and for that purpose alone. It has nothing to do with the guilt or innocence of the defendant. It is to be considered by you only in terms of bias and prejudice as to his position in that lawsuit as opposed to Defendant Carreon.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b744-12\">Have you been sued by Garrett?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b744-13\">The Witness: I have received a subpoena, but that was for the\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b744-14\">The Court: Have you had a suit filed against you by Garrett?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b744-15\">The Witness: Yes, I have.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b744-16\">The Court: All right.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b744-17\">Q. [By defense counsel]: As part of that lawsuit, are you charged with taking\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b744-18\">[Prosecutor]: Objection, your Honor.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b744-19\">The Court: Just a moment, Counsel. That\u2019s enough.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b744-20\">(R.T. 241-42.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b744-21\">The court also refused to permit Carreon to show what promises had been made to Yerich about that lawsuit:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b744-22\">Q. [By defense counsel]: Has anybody from Garrett Freight made you any promises with regard to the disposition of that lawsuit?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b744-23\">[Prosecutor]: Objection, your Honor.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b744-24\">The Court: The objection is overruled.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b744-25\">A. Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b744-26\">Q. What was that promise?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b744-27\">A. If I told them what had happened, not to anybody else, but just to the Garrett Freight Lines attorney, that they would drop the charges.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b744-28\">Q. And at that time\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b744-29\">The Court: Just a moment. That will go out. The jury is admonished to disregard it. That has nothing to do with this lawsuit. Garrett is not a party here, ladies and gentlemen of the jury. Please understand that. Garrett is not a party to this lawsuit. All right.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b744-30\">[Defense counsel]: Your Honor, the witness\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b744-31\">The Court: Just a moment, Counsel. Put a question.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b744-32\">[Defense counsel]: Would the Court please advise me of the grounds\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b744-33\">The Court: Put a question.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b744-34\">(R.T. 243-44.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b744-35\">Similarly, the court unduly restricted cross-examination about a Federal criminal case charging Yerich with theft from interstate commerce and pending while the present case was being investigated. Ye-rich was shown a statement that he gave to FBI Agent McGuire, and the following ensued:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b745-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"685\">*685</page-number>Q. [By defense counsel]: You made that statement approximately nine months after the theft took place; is that right?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b745-4\">A. Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b745-5\">* its * * * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b745-6\">Q. Did you make other statements about the theft of the television sets?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b745-7\">A. Yes, I did.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b745-8\">* * * * * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b745-9\">Q. At the time you made the statement to Mr. McGuire, had your federal case gone to trial?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b745-10\">[Prosecutor]: Objection, your Honor.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b745-11\">The Court: The objection is overruled to that question.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b745-12\">The Witness: No, it was just a little while after I was arrested for that.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b745-13\">Q. Was your federal case subsequently assigned to a judge?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b745-14\">A. Yes, it was.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b745-15\">Q. And it had a date set for your trial?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b745-16\">A. Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b745-17\">Q. Did you go to trial?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b745-18\">[Prosecutor]: Objection, your Honor.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b745-19\">The Court: The objection is sustained.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b745-20\">\u00a1t: <em>at </em># sj&lt; * #</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b745-21\">Q. Did you enter a guilty plea to a charge?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b745-22\">The Court: There is no question about \u2014 we will take judicial notice that the case was assigned to Judge Lydick, that Mr. Yerich appeared before Judge Lydick as the record indicates, entered a plea of guilty, and was sentenced as he has testified.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b745-24\">Q. At the time you entered that plea of guilty, did you know what the maximum punishment you would face for that crime\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b745-25\">[Prosecutor]: Objection.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b745-26\">The Court: The objection is sustained.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b745-27\">Q. After you entered your guilty plea, you were ordered to return to court for sentencing on January 7, 1975.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b745-28\">[Prosecutor]: Objection, your Honor.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b745-29\">The Court: The objection is sustained.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b745-30\">Q. Between the date of your guilty plea and the date of your sentencing, did you meet again with Mr. McGuire?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b745-31\">[Prosecutor]: Objection.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b745-32\">The Court: The objection is overruled.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b745-33\">The Witness: Yes, I did.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b745-34\">Q. At the time you met with Mr. McGuire, you were worried about your sentencing, weren\u2019t you?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b745-35\">[Prosecutor]: Objection, your Honor.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b745-36\">The Court: The objection is sustained.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b745-37\">Q. At the time you met with Mr. McGuire, you discussed cooperating with the government in exchange for leniency in your case, didn\u2019t you?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b745-38\">[Prosecutor]: Objection, assumes facts not in evidence.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b745-39\">The Court: The objection is overruled.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b745-40\">The Witness: No, I didn\u2019t.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b745-41\">Q. You did not discuss\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b745-42\">The Court: That is what he said, Counsel. Now, put a question.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b745-43\">Q. Mr. Yerich, were you aware at that time that the government was still trying to solve the theft of the television sets?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b745-44\">A. Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b745-45\">Q. You knew that there were no charges pending against Mr. Carreon in connection with that case at that time, didn\u2019t you?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b745-46\">[Prosecutor]: Objection, your Honor.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b745-47\">The Court: The objection is sustained.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b745-48\">Q. The statements you made to Agent McGuire in December was materially different from the statement you made in September, wasn\u2019t it?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b745-49\">A. Yes, it was.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b745-50\">Q.' At the time you made the second statement, you knew your first statement hadn\u2019t been good enough to justify bringing charges to anyone else to selling the TV\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b745-51\">[Prosecutor]: Objection, your Honor.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b745-52\">The Court: The objection is sustained.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b745-53\">Q. Realizing that you were facing sentence in your other case, you made this new statement; isn\u2019t that right?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b745-54\">[Prosecutor]: Objection, your Honor.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b745-55\">The Court: The objection is overruled.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b746-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"686\">*686</page-number>The Witness: Can you repeat the question?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b746-4\">(The question was read by the reporter.)</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b746-5\">The Witness: Yes, I talked to my lawyer and he said it would be the best thing for me.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b746-6\"><em>* </em>* * * * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b746-7\">Q. Was any decision made as to postponing your sentencing until after you had been able to testify for the government against Mr. Carreon?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b746-8\">[Prosecutor]: Objection, your Honor.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b746-9\">The Court: Objection sustained.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b746-10\">Q. Sentencing was postponed more than one time, wasn\u2019t it?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b746-11\">[Prosecutor]: Objection, your Honor.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b746-12\">The Court: The objection is sustained.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b746-13\">Q. In May did you meet with Special Agent McGuire and Mr. Rubalcava [the Prosecutor] in Mr. Rubalcava\u2019s office?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b746-14\">A. Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b746-15\">Q. Did you meet with them for the purpose of reciting for Mr. Rubalcava your new statement in connection with this case?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b746-16\">A. Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b746-17\">Q. After he heard your statement, did Mr. Rubalcava advise you that if you would testify to that in court, you could be permitted to face sentencing in your other case?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b746-18\">[Prosecutor]: Objection, your Honor.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b746-19\">The Court: The objection is sustained.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b746-20\">Q. It is a fact, is it not, that you were placed on probation?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b746-21\">[Prosecutor]: Objection, your Honor.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b746-22\">The Court: The objection is sustained.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b746-23\">Q. That at the time of your sentencing the government made a recommendation to the court that it place you on probation because you had promised to assist the government in this case.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b746-24\">[Prosecutor]: Objection, your Honor.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b746-25\">The Court: The objection is overruled.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b746-26\">The Witness: Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b746-27\">(R.T. 250-57.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b746-28\">Second, the court repeatedly interrupted defense counsel\u2019s opening statement and her closing argument, although objections had not been made by the prosecutor, made and sustained its own objections to several of defense counsel\u2019s questions, and treated counsel in such a way that the jury could readily have inferred that the court had a low opinion, not only of defense counsel, but of Carreon\u2019s defense.</p>\n<p id=\"b746-30\">What we said in <em>United States </em>v. <em>Harris, </em>9 Cir., 1974, 501 F.2d 1, is a good description of what happened in this case.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b746-31\">A thorough review of the record convinces us that the trial judge overstepped the bounds of judicial propriety by excessively interjecting himself into the proceedings below.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b746-32\">* * * * * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b746-33\">Aside from the limitations that the court placed on defense counsel during the cross-examination, the trial judge often came to the aid of the prosecutor by interrupting defense counsel and by participating unduly in the trial. . Substantially all of the trial court interruptions, intentionally or otherwise, aided in the prosecution.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b746-34\">* * * * * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b746-35\">Throughout the trial the court interrupted defense counsel, prevented defense counsel from pursuing evidentiary arguments, and abruptly ordered defense counsel to continue the interrogation of witnesses without explaining its various evidentiary rulings. The court\u2019s unusual manner created an atmosphere in which an objectively fair trial could not be conducted. <em>(Id. </em>at 9, 10, 11, fn. 20)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b746-36\"><em>See also, Davis v. Alaska, </em>1974, 415 U.S. 308, 316, 94 S.Ct. 1105, 39 L.Ed.2d 347; <em>United States v. Rodriguez, </em>9 Cir., 1971, 439 F.2d 782, 783-84.</p>\n<p id=\"b746-37\">The judgment is reversed and the case is remanded for a new trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b746-38\">EAST, Senior District Judge, dissenting:</p>\n<p id=\"Azk\">I respectfully dissent from the conclusion reached by the majority.</p>\n<p id=\"b746-39\">I conclude that the majority has too narrowly viewed the range of the District Court\u2019s judicial discretion in the field of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"687\">*687</page-number>cross-examination as to bias of prosecution witnesses. The jury was well apprised of Carreon\u2019s participation in the crime charged against him and for which he was previously convicted and sentenced to probation. Furthermore, the District Court fully admonished the jury that Yerich\u2019s testimony must be received with caution and weighed with great care, and that the circumstance of Yerich\u2019s prior conviction may be considered in determining the credibility to be given Yerich.</p>\n<p id=\"b747-5\">While the District Court did at times interrupt defense counsel and interpose its own questions to witnesses, I do not conclude that the District Court\u2019s trial participation deprived Carreon of reasonably effective defense counsel.</p>\n<p id=\"b747-6\">I believe that Carreon received a fair, if not a perfect, trial on the charge.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
