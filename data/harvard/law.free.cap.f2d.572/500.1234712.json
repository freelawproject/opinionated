State law controls the limitations period for actions under these sections. Plaintiff claims that in Georgia an action for assault is governed by a three-year common law limitations period. The district court found that the three-year common law period, if it ever existed, was no longer the law of Georgia. Rather, it found that Ga.Code Ann. \u00a7 3-1004, which provides a two-year limitations period for \u201cactions for injuries to the person,\u201d was applicable.</p>\n<p id=\"b561-5\">Since plaintiff was arrested on May 2, 1975 and released on May 5,1975, but did not bring this action until July 15, 1977, his action is time barred by the two-year limitations period of \u00a7 3-1004.</p>\n<p id=\"b561-6\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
