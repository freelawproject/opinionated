Appellant relies upon this court\u2019s decision in <em>United States v. McKinney, </em>379 F.2d 259 (6th Cir. 1967), which in turn cited with approval the concurring opinion of Judge Bell in <em>De Luna v. United States, </em>308 F.2d 140 (5th Cir. 1962).</p>\n<p id=\"b1451-10\">Upon review the court finds the facts in this case fully distinguishable from those in the cases cited and that any error by co-counsel\u2019s improper reference to defendant\u2019s failure to testify was fully cured by the instructions which the court gave in the case. The comment was isolated and not the result of any conduct on the part of the prosecution, and it was followed by a prompt and comprehensive instruction. Accordingly,</p>\n<p id=\"b1451-11\">IT IS ORDERED that the judgment of the district court is affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
