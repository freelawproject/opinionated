After a six-day jury trial in the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York, Frederick van Pelt Bryan, <em>Judge, </em>Nancy Reed and Morris Goldsmith were convicted of one count of conspiracy to distribute heroin and another count of distributing heroin. 21 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 812, 841(a)(1), 841(b)(1)(A) &amp; (B), 846. Reed was sentenced to two concurrent six-year terms of imprisonment. Her sentence was suspended, however, and she was placed on probation for five years. Goldsmith was sentenced to two concurrent four-year terms of imprisonment and three years of special parole. For the reasons that follow, we reverse Reed\u2019s conviction and remand for a new trial but affirm Goldsmith\u2019s conviction.</p>\n<p id=\"b474-19\">The government proved that on three separate occasions Reed and Goldsmith were involved in the sale of heroin to Garfield Hammonds, Jr., an undercover agent employed by the United States Drug En<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"415\">*415</page-number>forcement Administration (\u201cDEA\u201d), and that they negotiated with Hammonds for an additional purchase. Hammonds had been introduced to Reed and Goldsmith as \u201cG.G.\u201d by a paid confidential informant named Adelious McCray.</p>\n<p id=\"b475-5\">Because McCray disappeared shortly before trial,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> the government\u2019s case was based largely on testimony by Hammonds and fellow DEA Agents Richard Bell, Dwight Rabb, and Harvey Tuerack. According to their testimony, Hammonds, with the assistance of McCray, purchased one-eighth kilogram quantities of heroin from Reed and Goldsmith on the 9th, 23rd, and 29th of September, 1976, for $6,500, $6,300, and $6,500 respectively. When at one point Hammonds complained about the quality of the heroin, Reed told him that she had a \u201cconnection\u201d in New Jersey named Paul Levy who was a reliable source of good heroin, that she had introduced her cousin \u201cP.T.\u201d to Levy for purposes of making a two-kilogram purchase, and that she could arrange a similar transaction for Hammonds. During the two months that followed the third sale, Hammonds negotiated with Reed regarding the purchase of a kilogram of heroin for $100,000. When Hammonds vacillated, Reed told him that she had a source named James Crowley who could arrange the purchase of a pound of lesser-quality heroin for $36,000. On December 6, she produced a sample of the heroin that she said would come from Crowley. The transaction was never completed.</p>\n<p id=\"b475-6\">More than two and one-half months later, on the morning of February 23, 1977, Reed and Goldsmith were arrested in Reed\u2019s apartment in the Bronx by DEA Agents Bell, Tuerack and Ronald Jordison. The agents had neither arrest warrants nor a search warrant. While in the apartment, Agent Bell seized two personal telephone or address books belonging to Reed, copies of which were introduced by the government at trial. Because the arrest and the resulting seizure of the books are critical to deciding Reed\u2019s appeal, we will examine them in detail.</p>\n<p id=\"b475-9\">At approximately 7:30 a. m., Agents Bell, Tuerack, Jordison and Aponte met near Reed\u2019s apartment house. At about 7:45 a. m., Agents Bell, Tuerack and Jordison entered the apartment building and proceeded to Reed\u2019s apartment on the fourteenth floor; Agent Aponte waited below. Agent Bell testified as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b475-10\">We went up to the 14th floor, and we knocked on the door of the apartment, and identified ourselves as agents of the United States Government.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b475-11\">When I identified ourselves as agents of the Federal Government Drug Enforcement Administration, we were admitted to the apartment. Ms. Reed opened the door, I believe, and we told her that we had \u2014 we were arresting her and Mr. Goldsmith. Mr. Goldsmith was in the bedroom. He was in bed \u2014 I didn\u2019t see this, I did not arrest Mr. Goldsmith. * * * * * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b475-12\">Ms. Reed was in the living room or the dining area and with a tall female child [subsequently] identified as Ms. Reed\u2019s daughter. We explained to her who we were again. I placed Ms. Reed under arrest, and at that time I gave her her rights .</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b475-13\">Reed, on the other hand, gave the following account:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b475-14\">My daughter went to the door first, and they announced themselves as being police, so I came to the door and I opened the door. They rushed in, two ran immediately to the bedroom. Bell ran into my kitchen, came out of my kitchen with the phone books which he had taken out of my drawer and then he told me \u2014 he started reading the rights or whatever, and he told me I was under arrest, but that was all after he came into the apartment.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b476-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"416\">*416</page-number>When Reed pulled open the door she was dressed in a negligee and Goldsmith was asleep in the bedroom. Agent Bell testified that his gun was not drawn but that he was \u201cnot absolutely sure\u201d whether the other agents had drawn their guns. Agent Tuer-ack said, \u201cI had my hand on my weapon as I went through the door\u201d and that his gun \u201cmay have been\u201d visible to Reed as she stood at the door. Tuerack could not say whether Bell or Jordison had their guns drawn. The district court\u2019s version of Reed\u2019s arrest was: \u201cShe came to the door and they arrested her. Then they went into the apartment,\u201d and \u201cshe was arrested in full view when she opened the door.\u201d Agent Tuerack testified as follows regarding the Goldsmith arrest:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b476-4\">We rang the bell and Nancy Reed came to the door. Agent Bell arrested her. Agent Jordison and myself went into the bedroom where we found Morris Goldsmith asleep.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b476-5\">******</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b476-6\">I woke him up and I told him he was under arrest for violation of federal narcotics laws.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b476-7\">******</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b476-8\">I stopped at the door [of the apartment] for about five or six seconds [and then] went right into the bedroom.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b476-9\">At the pre-trial hearing, Goldsmith testified that, after coming home at 5:00 a. m. in a \u201creally intoxicated\u201d condition, he went to sleep.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b476-10\">The next thing I know two \u2014 well, when I woke up there was two guns on both sides of my head with the federal officer explaining to me that he was an agent and that I was under arrest.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b476-11\">Agent Jordison then advised Goldsmith of his constitutional rights.</p>\n<p id=\"b476-12\">There is also disagreement regarding Agent Bell\u2019s seizure of Reed\u2019s telephone and address books. Bell testified that, while in the living room-dining room section of the apartment, the following took place:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"A7f\">I observed \u2014 I turned around and on a telephone table was an open address book. I looked down at the book and recognized one of the names in the book, one of the nicknames, one of the aliases in the book, and I asked Ms. Reed was this her telephone book. She said yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b476-14\">I said, \u201cWell, I am going to take it,\u201d and she said, \u201cTake it.\u201d And I removed the two telephone books from the telephone stand and brought them down to the New York regional office . ******</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b476-15\">I expected that the phone books when I looked at them were evidence.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b476-16\">Although the precise sequence is unclear, Bell\u2019s testimony during the trial indicates that he first saw the books without noticing any names, then read Reed her rights, and then looked more carefully at the books and discovered the names of alleged narcotics traffickers. Bell testified further that the books were next to the telephone on a small telephone table along the wall in the living room-dining room area, and that the name that caught his attention was that of one \u201cSoda Pop,\u201d apparently the alias of a well-known narcotics trafficker in New York.</p>\n<p id=\"b476-17\">Reed\u2019s version is different. She claimed that Bell went into the kitchen and took one of the books from the kitchen drawer and another from her pocketbook, both pri- or to the time that he advised her of her rights.</p>\n<p id=\"b476-18\">The story of the seizure is complicated by the testimony of Thelma Routh, Goldsmith\u2019s mother. She testified that on the day of the arrest there was no telephone or telephone table in the living room-dining room area of the apartment; rather, she said, there was a wall phone in the kitchen under which there was no table. The sequence is further complicated by the fact that, although at one point Agent Bell said he had riot gone into any part of the apartment other than the living room-dining room area, at another point he said he went into the kitchen during the initial efforts to secure the apartment.</p>\n<p id=\"b476-19\">After the arrests, Agent Bell took Reed to the DEA office in New York and Agents Tuerack and Jordison took Goldsmith. Bell again advised Reed of her constitutional rights. She denied any involvement what<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"417\">*417</page-number>soever in narcotics until Agent Hammonds, \u201cG.G.,\u201d entered the room in which she was being questioned. At that point she admitted she had participated in the sales. She was then taken to the United States Attorney\u2019s office, where she was interviewed and again advised of her rights, after which she signed a written statement. The same pattern of events took place with Goldsmith. He denied being involved in narcotics until he was confronted by Hammonds, at which point he too admitted participating in the sales. He was brought to the United States Attorney\u2019s office, advised of his rights and interviewed; he then signed a written statement. Agents Hammonds and Tuer-ack testified at trial regarding Reed\u2019s and Goldsmith\u2019s oral statements; the signed statements were admitted into evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b477-5\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b477-6\"><em>Reed's Fourth Amendment </em>Claim<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"A8tx\">The Fourth Amendment to the United States Constitution provides as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b477-9\">The right of the people to be secure in their persons, houses, papers, and effects, against unreasonable searches and seizures, shall not be violated, and no Warrants shall issue, but upon probable cause, supported by Oath or affirmation, and particularly describing the place to be searched, and the persons or things to be seized.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b477-10\">Reed argues on this appeal that her arrest was unconstitutional under the Fourth Amendment, that the seizure of her personal telephone books was therefore unlawful, that the introduction of those books at trial was neither proper nor harmless beyond a reasonable doubt and, accordingly, that her conviction should be reversed and her case remanded for a new trial. The question thus presented is whether and under what circumstances the Fourth Amendment permits federal law enforcement officers to enter a suspect\u2019s home in order to effect a felony arrest for which the officers have both statutory authority<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> and probable <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"418\">*418</page-number>cause<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> but no warrant. Surprisingly, neither the Supreme Court nor the Second Circuit has squarely decided this issue. We hold that warrantless felony arrests by federal agents effected in the suspect\u2019s home, in the absence of exigent circumstances, even when based upon statutory authority and probable cause, are unconstitutional. Because Reed\u2019s was such an arrest, and because we do not believe beyond a reasonable doubt that the introduction of the telephone books, seized at the time of the arrest, was harmless error, we reverse her conviction and remand to the district court for a new trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b478-4\">Although the Supreme Court has expressly reserved this issue on a number of occasions,<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> the Court has offered important signals as to how it ought to be handled. In <em>Coolidge v. New Hampshire, </em>403 U.S. 443, 91 S.Ct. 2022, 29 L.Ed.2d 564 (1971), Justice Stewart, writing for the majority, noted that the Court had generally chosen to assume the validity of arrests and decide cases on grounds other than \u201cthe more fundamental question of when the police may arrest a man in his house without a warrant.\u201d 403 U.S. at 476, 91 S.Ct. at 2043. He also noted that a police entry into a home to effect an arrest is a \u201cvery substantial intrusion.\u201d 403 U.S. at 477, 91 S.Ct. 2022.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b478-5\">It is clear, then, that the notion that the warrantless entry of a man\u2019s house in order to arrest him on probable cause is <em>per se </em>legitimate is in fundamental conflict with the basic principle of Fourth Amendment law that searches and seizures inside a man\u2019s house without warrant are <em>per se </em>unreasonable in the absence of some one of a number of well defined \u201cexigent circumstances.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b478-9\">If we were to accept Mr. Justice White\u2019s view that warrantless entry for purposes of arrest . . [is] <em>per se </em>reasonable, so long as the police have probable cause, it would be difficult to see the basis for distinguishing searches of houses and seizures of effects. . . .</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b478-11\">. If we were to agree with Mr. Justice White that the police may, whenever they have probable cause, make a warrantless entry for the purpose of making an arrest . . then by the same logic <em>any </em>search or seizure could be carried out without a warrant, and we would simply have read the Fourth Amendment out of the Constitution.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b478-13\">403 U.S. at 477-80, 91 S.Ct. at 2045. The Court also noted that the case of <em>Warden </em>v. <em>Hayden, </em>387 U.S. 294, 87 S.Ct. 1642, 18 L.Ed.2d 782 (1967), in which the \u201chot pursuit\u201d justification for entry into a home without a warrant was developed, \u201ccertainly stands by negative implication for the proposition that an arrest warrant is required in the absence of exigent circumstances.\u201d 403 U.S. at 481, 91 S.Ct. at 2045.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b479-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"419\">*419</page-number>In <em>United States v. Watson, </em>423 U.S. 411, 96 S.Ct. 820, 46 L.Ed.2d 598 (1976), Justice White, writing for the majority, discussed the requirement of an arrest warrant with regard to an arrest effected in a public restaurant. The Court reserved the question \u201cwhether and under what circumstances an officer may enter a suspect\u2019s home to make a warrantless arrest,\u201d 423 U.S. at 418 n.6, 96 S.Ct. at 825 n.6, and held as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"afo-dedup-1\">Law enforcement officers may find it wise to seek arrest warrants where practicable to do so, and their judgments about probable cause may be more readily accepted where backed by a warrant issued by a magistrate. . . . But we decline to transform this judicial preference into a constitutional rule when the judgment of the Nation and Congress has for so long been to authorize warrantless public arrests on. probable cause.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b479-6\">423 U.S. at 423, 96 S.Ct. at 828. (citations omitted). Justice Powell concurred, noting that the decision was \u201cthe first square holding that the Fourth Amendment permits a duly authorized law enforcement officer to make a warrantless arrest in a public place even though he had adequate opportunity to procure a warrant after developing probable cause for arrest.\u201d 423 U.S. at 427, 96 S.Ct. at 829. He also argued that the decision created \u201ca certain anomaly\u201d:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b479-7\">Since the Fourth Amendment speaks equally to both searches and seizures, and since an arrest, the taking hold of one\u2019s person, is quintessentially a seizure, it would seem that the constitutional provision should impose the same limitations upon arrests that it does upon searches. Indeed, as an abstract matter an argument can be made that the restrictions upon arrest perhaps should be greater. A search may cause only annoyance and temporary inconvenience to the law-abiding citizen, assuming more serious dimension only when it turns up evidence of criminality. An arrest, however, is a serious personal intrusion regardless of whether the person seized is guilty or innocent. . . . Logic therefore would seem to dictate that arrests be subject to the warrant requirement at least to the same extent as searches.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"ALx\">423 U.S. at 427, 428-29, 96 S.Ct. at 830, (citations omitted). In view of \u201c[t]he historical momentum for acceptance of war-rantless arrests,\u201d however, he concluded that \u201ca declaration at this late date that warrantless felony arrests are constitutionally infirm would have to rest upon reasons more substantial than a desire to harmonize the rules for arrest with those governing searches.\u201d 423 U.S. at 430, 96 S.Ct. at 831. Justice Marshall, joined by Justice Brennan, dissented, believing that, \u201cby the reference to the seizure of persons, the Fourth Amendment was intended to apply to arrests,\u201d 423 U.S. at 436-37, 96 S.Ct. at 834, and that the Court had improperly hinged its decision not on whether the circumstances of the arrest fit into certain exceptions to the warrant requirement of the Fourth Amendment but on whether the arrest had been \u201creasonable.\u201d 423 U.S. at 444-45, 96 S.Ct. at 838. Accordingly, he believed that \u201cthe proper result is application of the warrant requirement, as it has developed in the search context, to all arrests.\u201d 423 U.S. at 453, 96 S.Ct. at 842.</p>\n<p id=\"b479-14\">The most recent Supreme Court case to broach this issue is <em>United States v. Santana, </em>427 U.S. 38, 96 S.Ct. 2406 (1976). There, Philadelphia narcotics officers received information that Santana possessed marked money that had been used in a narcotics purchase arranged by an undercover agent. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"420\">*420</page-number>The officers drove to Santana\u2019s residence and saw her \u201cstanding in the doorway of the house.\u201d 427 U.S. at 40, 96 S.Ct. at 2408 (footnote omitted). One officer testified that \u201cone step forward would have put her outside, one step backward would have put her in the vestibule of her residence.\u201d 427 U.S. at 40 n.1, 96 S.Ct. at 2408. The officers got out, shouted \u201cpolice,\u201d displayed their identification and approached her. She retreated into the house and the officers pursued her, catching her in the vestibule. Justice Rehnquist, writing for the majority, determined that the case presented the same issue that had already been resolved in <em>Watson, </em>namely, the validity of a warrantless public arrest:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b480-4\">While it may be true that under the common law of property the threshold of one\u2019s dwelling is \u201cprivate,\u201d as is the yard surrounding the house, it is nonetheless clear that under the cases interpreting the Fourth Amendment Santana was in a \u201cpublic\u201d place. She was not in an area where she had any expectation of privacy. \u201cWhat a person knowingly exposes to the public, even in his own house or office, is not a subject of Fourth Amendment protection.\u201d . . . She was not merely visible to the public but was as exposed to public view, speech, hearing and touch as if she had been standing completely outside her house. Thus, when the police, who concededly had probable cause to do so, sought to arrest her, they merely intended to perform a function which we have approved in <em>Watson.</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b480-8\">427 U.S. at 42, 96 S.Ct. at 2409. (citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b480-9\">Justice White concurred, believing that there was probable cause to arrest Santana and to believe that she was in the house and, accordingly, that \u201ca warrant was not required to enter the house to make the arrest, at least where entry by force was not required.\u201d 427 U.S. at 43 \u2014 44, 96 S.Ct. at 2410. Justice Stevens, joined by Justice Stewart, concurred, believing that the officers had \u201csufficient information to obtain a warrant for the arrest of Santana in her home,\u201d that the failure to obtain a warrant was justifiable because of the \u201csignificant risk\u201d that Santana could have disposed of the money before a warrant could have been obtained and that, in any event, even if the police action was not justifiable it was harmless because Santana had \u201cventured into plain view.\u201d 427 U.S. at 44 \u2014 45, 96 S.Ct. 2406. Justice Marshall, joined by Justice Brennan, dissented, noting that, although the Court seemed to be combining the plain view or \u201copen fields\u201d and the \u201chot pursuit\u201d doctrines to justify Santana\u2019s war-rantless arrest, thus making the decision a very narrow one, he could not join in the decision because it did not depend upon the presence of exigent circumstances. 427 U.S. at 46-47, 96 S.Ct. 2406.</p>\n<p id=\"b480-10\">The closest this Court has come to deciding this question squarely is the recent decision of <em>United States v. Jarvis, </em>560 F.2d 494 (2d Cir. 1977), <em>cert. </em>denied,-U.S.-, 98 S.Ct. 1511, 55 L.Ed.2d 532 (U.S. Mar. 20, 1978).<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> There, the Court considered <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"421\">*421</page-number>\u201cwhether under fourth amendment standards it was permissible to arrest [a suspect] in his home at midday, following a forcible entry, without a valid warrant . 560 F.2d at 498. Referring to the <em>en banc </em>decision of the District of Columbia Circuit, <em>Dorman v. United States, </em>140 U.S.App.D.C. 313, 435 F.2d 385 (1970), which determined that exigent circumstances were required if a warrantless arrest was to be effected in the home, the Court concluded that \u201c[u]nder [the <em>Dorman </em>] criteria the Jarvis arrest could not be upheld\u201d and that \u201c[t]here is therefore serious question whether the forcible entry into Jarvis\u2019 home without a valid warrant and in the absence of exigent circumstances meets the requirement of the statute [18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3052] or fourth amendment standards of reasonableness.\u201d 560 F.2d at 498. The Court declined to suppress the evidence that had been seized, however, because \u201c[t]he illegal arrest . . . was not a \u2018but for\u2019 cause for the introduction of [that] evidence . . . .\u201d <em>Id. </em>The Court noted further that \u201cno evidence [was] being challenged which could not have been obtained even without the illegal arrest\u201d and that it was not confronted with a case \u201cwhere the government \u2018exploits\u2019 an unlawful arrest\u201d but with a case in which \u201c \u2018the arrest made in good faith turns out to [be] illegal\u2019 \u201d because of an invalid arrest warrant. 560 F.2d at 499, <em>quoting United States v.

We here follow the lead of <em>Jarvis.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b481-9\">It is settled that \u201csearches conducted outside the judicial process,without prior approval by judge or magistrate, are <em>per se </em>unreasonable under the Fourth Amendment \u2014 subject only to a few specifically established and well-delineated exceptions.\u201d <em>Katz v.

In this case, however, we consider not the constitutionality of an arrest in a public place but that of an arrest in an intrinsically private place \u2014 the home. This calls to the fore significant interests which are not present when a suspect is arrested in a public place. \u201cWhen the stakes are this high, the detached judgment of a neutral magistrate is essential if the Fourth Amendment is to furnish meaningful protection . . . <em>Gerstein </em>v. <em>Pugh, </em>420 U.S. 103, 114, 95 S.Ct. 854, 863, 43 L.Ed.2d 54 (1975).</p>\n<p id=\"b482-5\">It is by now a commonplace that the Fourth Amendment protects citizens\u2019 reasonable expectations of privacy. <em>See Katz v.

Reed testified that the agents \u201crushed in\u201d immediately after she pulled the door open and then arrested her. The district court believed that Reed was arrested when she opened the door. No matter which of these <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"423\">*423</page-number>versions is the most accurate, Reed\u2019s arrest was effected not in a \u201cpublic\u201d place but in a place protected by the Fourth Amendment.

Rather, she was arrested inside her home.</p>\n<p id=\"b483-5\">It is, of course, not enough to say that Reed had a protected privacy interest in her apartment; we must also find that that interest was invaded by the government agents. We believe that it was.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> Merely being arrested is for most persons an \u201cawesome and frightening\u201d experience, an invasion of considerable proportion. ALI, Model Code for Pre-Arraignment Procedure, Commentary 290-91 (1975); <em>see Foley v.

To be arrested in the home involves not only the invasion attendant to all arrests but also an invasion of the sanctity of the home. This is simply too substantial an invasion to allow without a warrant, at least in the absence of exigent circumstances, even when it is accomplished under statutory authority and when probable cause is clearly present.</p>\n<p id=\"b483-11\">In <em>Accarino </em>v. <em>United States, </em>85 U.S. App.D.C. 394, 179 F.2d 456, 464 (D.C.Cir. 1949), <em>cited with approval in Miller v.

That additional right imposes additional requirements upon the power of arrest. . . . \u201cWe emphasize that no matter who the officer is or what his mission, a government official cannot invade a private home, unless (1) a magistrate has authorized him to do so or (2) an immediate major crisis in the performance of duty affords neither time nor opportunity to apply to a magistrate.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b484-5\">If nothing additional were required, a man\u2019s right of privacy in his home would be no more than his rights on the street; and the right to arrest without a warrant would be precisely the same as the right to arrest with a warrant.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b484-6\">We quite agree. <em>Cf.

(White, J., concurring and dissenting) (\u201ceffects enjoy derivative protection when located in a house or other area within reach of the Fourth Amendment.\u201d). The mere fact that the entry of the home is for the purpose of accomplishing an arrest rather than a search for or seizure of \u201cthings\u201d does not affect the need for a warrant in circumstances such as these. As was argued by the appellants in <em>Lankford </em>v. <em>Gelston, </em>364 F.2d 197, 205 (4th Cir. 1966) <em>(en </em>banc), \u201cfrom the standpoint of the victim, the invasion of the privacy of his home is unaffected by the object of the policeman\u2019s search.\u201d Indeed, it would be</p>\n<blockquote id=\"at7-dedup-0\">incongruous to pay homage to the considerable body of law that has developed to protect an individual\u2019s belongings from unreasonable search and seizure in his home, and at the same time assert that identical considerations do not operate to protect the individual himself in the same setting.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b484-7\"><em>People </em>v. <em>Ramey, </em>16 Cal.3d 263, 275, 127 Cal.Rptr. 629, 636, 545 P.2d 1333, 1340 (In Banc), <em>cert. denied, </em>429 U.S. 929, 97 S.Ct. 335, 50 L.Ed.2d 299 (1976). <em>See also United States v.

Accordingly, we hold that, in the absence of a warrant to arrest a suspect at home,<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> and in the absence of exigent circumstances, federal law enforcement officers are prohibited by the Fourth Amendment from entering the home of a suspect to effect a felony arrest for which they otherwise have both statutory authority and probable cause.</p>\n<p id=\"b484-10\">As in <em>Jarvis, </em>we join the District of Columbia Circuit regarding the various factors that may be used to determine whether \u201cexigent circumstances\u201d are present. These include (1) the gravity or violent nature of the offense with which the suspect is to be charged; (2) whether the suspect \u201cis reasonably believed to be armed\u201d; (3) \u201ca clear showing of probable cause ... to believe that the suspect committed the crime\u201d; (4) \u201cstrong reason to believe that the suspect is in the premises being entered\u201d; (5) \u201ca likelihood that the suspect will escape if not swiftly apprehended\u201d; and (6) the peaceful circumstances of the entry. <em>Dorman v.

This neither requires that federal agents obtain a warrant at the earliest possible moment, <em>see Cardwell v. United </em>States, 417 U.S. 583, 595-96, 94 S.Ct. 2464, 41 L.Ed.2d 325 (1974) (plurality opinion), nor is it likely to cause significant delay, see <em>McDonald </em>v. <em>United States, supra, </em>335 U.S. at 455, 69 S.Ct. 191; <em>Johnson v.

United States, </em>119 U.S.App.D.C. 356, 359, 342 F.2d 935, 938 (1965) (Burger, <em>J.). </em>It does, however, place on the government a reasonable burden of justifying a warrant-less entry and arrest. Here, inasmuch as <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"425\">*425</page-number>the DEA Agents had no contact whatsoever with Reed or Goldsmith for two and one-half months prior to their arrest, and since there is no suggestion of a change in the status of the investigation during that period, we cannot conclude that exigent circumstances were present. Accordingly, Reed\u2019s arrest was unlawful.</p>\n<p id=\"b485-4\">Because the arrest was unlawful, the government is precluded from justifying the seizure of the telephone books either on the basis of the \u201cplain view\u201d or \u201csearch incident to arrest\u201d exceptions to the search warrant requirement of the Fourth Amendment. Because the telephone books were seized illegally, they should not have been introduced at trial.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> <em>See Brown v.

Edmons, supra, </em>432 F.2d at 584-85.</p>\n<p id=\"b485-5\">We do not believe beyond a reasonable doubt that the introduction of the telephone books at trial was harmless error. Reed argued at trial that she had been entrapped by McCray, the DEA\u2019s paid informant. The prosecutor referred to the books in the following way when the district judge inquired as to their relevance:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b485-6\">Within those telephone books are telephone numbers for individuals named James Crowley, P.P. [sic], Paulie, Marlowe, and I believe that there are other names in those books of drug traffickers. * * * * * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b485-7\">The Government\u2019s claim for relevance is based upon the presence in those books of the names of the unindicted co-conspirators in this case that I have just named.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AVD\">At a suppression hearing during trial, the prosecutor characterized the books as \u201cdamaging evidence.\u201d In summation, the prosecutor made the following comments:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b485-8\">Let\u2019s say Special Agent Bell is wrong, no table, no phone, but we have the address books and when Nancy Reed testified I asked her, \u201cAre these your address books?\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b485-11\">She said, they were, although she said Bell was lying about where he got them. The point is these people sold narcotics. Those address books are Nancy Reed\u2019s and you are going to learn something about what is in them, and the telephone is where every telephone is.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b485-12\">sf: !(t sfc sfc $</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b485-13\">When considering the case against Nancy Reed, take a look at her address books. There are some interesting numbers in these address books. P.T.\u2019s telephone number, Paulie\u2019s telephone number, and you\u2019ll find James Crowley\u2019s telephone number. James Crowley, who is supposedly Goldsmith\u2019s source, is in Nancy Reed\u2019s address book.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b485-14\">Mr. Markfield [Reed\u2019s attorney] says that the Paul Levy deal is a figment of somebody\u2019s imagination. That telephone number in the address book isn\u2019t a figment of anybody\u2019s imagination. It is there several times in both books.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b485-15\">These colnments were quite clearly intended to discredit Reed\u2019s claim that she had been entrapped. Jury deliberations began at 2:00 p. m. on June 14, 1977. By 3:15 p. m., the jury requested that it be allowed to examine the books. On these facts, we are unable to declare our belief that the error did not affect the outcome. <em>Chapman v. California, </em>386 U.S. 18, 22-24, 87 S.Ct. 824, 17 L.Ed.2d 705 (1967); <em>see also Bumper </em>v. <em>North Carolina, </em>391 U.S. 543, 553, 88 S.Ct. 1788, 20 L.Ed.2d 797 (1968) (Harlan, J., concurring); R.

He claims that the agents knew he was con<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"426\">*426</page-number>cerned abo\u00fct his job, his bail status and the possibility of his state parole being revoked, and that they used that knowledge to their advantage by promising assistance to him in exchange for incriminating statements. We find this argument unpersuasive. Goldsmith was repeatedly advised of his constitutional rights. He was, in fact, told that if he cooperated reasonable bail terms would be recommended and that an effort would be made to contact state parole officers. He was also told, however, that the federal agents had little if anything to do with state parole revocation practices. The test is \u201cwhether an examination of all the circumstances discloses that the conduct of \u2018law enforcement officials was such as to overbear [the defendant\u2019s] will to resist and bring about confessions not freely self-determined . . . <em>\u2019.\" United States v. Ferrara, </em>377 F.2d 16, 17 (2d Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>389 U.S. 908, 88 S.Ct. 225, 19 L.Ed.2d 225 (1967), <em>quoted in United States v.

We agree with the district judge that Goldsmith\u2019s statements were voluntarily made, and, accordingly, we hold that they were properly admitted.</p>\n<p id=\"b486-4\">Goldsmith also argues that the district court abused its discretion by ruling at a pre-trial hearing that Goldsmith\u2019s prior conviction could be used to impeach him, contending that the conviction was too remote in time, that the crime involved was a violent one rather than one involving dishonesty and that the court made insufficient findings as to admissibility. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b486-5\">Goldsmith was convicted in New York in November of 1967 on charges of felonious possession of a dangerous weapon, grand larceny in the first degree, robbery in the third degree and assault in the first degree and was sentenced to twenty-nine years imprisonment; he was released on September 2, 1974. His federal trial started on June 8, 1977. Rule 609(b) of the Federal Rules of Evidence provides as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b486-9\">Evidence of a conviction under this rule is not admissible if a period of more than ten years has elapsed since the date of the conviction or of the release of the witness from the confinement imposed for that conviction, whichever is the later date, unless the court determines, in the interests of justice, that the probative value of the conviction supported by specific facts and circumstances substantially outweighs its prejudicial effect. However, evidence of a conviction more than 10 years old as calculated herein, is not admissible unless the proponent gives to the adverse party sufficient advance written notice of intent to use such evidence to provide the adverse party with a fair opportunity to contest the use of such evidence.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b486-10\"><em>See generally, </em>3 J. Weinstein &amp; M. Berger, Evidence \u00b6 609[03], at 609-70 (1976). As the district court correctly ruled, Goldsmith\u2019s conviction and his release both occurred within the ten-year period prescribed by the rule. Goldsmith did not argue below that the nature of the crime of which he was convicted had no bearing on his credibility as a witness; he is barred from raising it now.

Even if it had been raised, the conviction would have been admissible under Fed.R.Evid. 609(a)(1) and there would have been no need to consider admissibility under Fed.R.Evid. 609(a)(2).<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> <em>See United States v.

Although Reed failed to move prior to trial to suppress the telephone books, as is customarily required by Fed.R.Crim.P. 12(f), the district court determined that Reed had not waived the objection and considered the matter when it was raised during trial. The district court based its decision on the prosecutor\u2019s failure to disclose to Reed his intention to introduce at trial photocopies of the books, as required by Fed.R.Crim.P. 12(d), and his violation of an oral understanding that all evidence discoverable under Fed.R.Crim.P. 16 would be turned over to Reed. The district court was \u201cdistressed\u201d by this failure, and decided to rule on the merits of Reed\u2019s suppression motion. The district court declined to suppress the evidence, basing its decision on 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 878; <em>United States v. Santana, </em>427 U.S. 38, 96 S.Ct. 2406, 49 L.Ed.2d 300 (1976); <em>United States v. Watson, </em>423 U.S. 411, 96 S.Ct. 820, 46 L.Ed.2d 598 (1976), and the \u201cplain view\u201d doctrine.

The government does not attempt to argue that Reed consented either to the entry for purposes of making the arrest or to the seizure of the telephone books. Had the government chosen to make such an argument, it would have had a difficult time indeed meeting the heavy burden for showing the existence of genuine consent. <em>See United States v. Watson, supra, </em>423 U.S. at 424-25, 96 S.Ct. 820, <em>Schneckloth v. Bustamonte, supra, </em>412 U.S. at 248, 93 S.Ct. 2041; <em>Bumper v.

We do not believe that the fact that Reed opened the door to her apartment in response to the knock of three armed federal agents operated in such a way as to eradicate her Fourth Amendment privacy interest. <em>Cf.
