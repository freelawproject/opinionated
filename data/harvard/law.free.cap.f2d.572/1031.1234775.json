The parties agreed that the case would be tried by a United States magistrate who, according to the pretrial order, would \u201crender final judgment herein.\u201d R. at 57. The magistrate heard the case, found for the defendants, and plaintiff appeals. We dismiss the appeal for want of jurisdiction.</p>\n<p id=\"b1092-16\">The recent opinion of <em>Kendall v. Davis, </em>5 Cir., 1978, 569 F.2d 1330, clearly holds that a magistrate\u2019s decision rendered in a setting similar to that involved here is not directly appealable to this Court. Under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 636(b)(1) and (2), a magistrate may serve \u201cas a special master in any civil case, upon consent of the parties,\u201d but his findings and recommendations are to be supervised and reviewed by the district court, which then enters judgment. F.R.Civ.P. 53(e). The magistrate\u2019s decision prior to the district court\u2019s review is not a \u201cfinal decision of a district court\u201d within the meaning of 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291. \u201cBecause no final decision of a district court has been rendered in this case and because no other statute authorizes direct appeal of the magistrate\u2019s decision under these circumstances, we have no jurisdiction to hear this appeal.\u201d<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> <em>Kendall v. Davis, supra, </em>at 1331.</p>\n<p id=\"b1092-17\">As in <em>Kendall, </em>we therefore dismiss the appeal without prejudice to a future appeal following the district court\u2019s review of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1033\">*1033</page-number>magistrate\u2019s report and entry of final judgment by the district court.</p>\n<p id=\"b1093-4\">DISMISSED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1092-12\">. Legislation pending in Congress would alter this result. The Magistrate Act of 1977, S. 1613, would amend 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 636 by adding the following provision after subsection (b):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AuJH\">\u201c(c) Notwithstanding any provision of law to the contrary, upon consent of the parties\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"aha-dedup-0\">* * * * * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1092-13\">[A] United States magistrate may be empowered to direct the entry of a final judgment of the district court in accordance with rule 58 of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure for the United States district courts, when specially designated to exercise such authority by the court or courts he serves, and under such conditions as may be imposed by the terms of such special designation. An appeal from any such final judgment of the district court may be taken to the appropriate United States court of appeals in the same manner as an appeal from any other final judgment of a district court.\u201d This bill passed the Senate in July 1977, and is presently before the House of Representatives.</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
