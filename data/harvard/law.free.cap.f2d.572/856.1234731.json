(Fritz),<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> ruling that Fritz was entitled to the benefit of an earlier application with a filing date before the earliest date asserted by Weil, his filing date. We reverse and remand.</p>\n<p id=\"b918-5\">\n<em>Background</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b918-6\">The subject matter of the interference is defined by the sole count which reads as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b918-7\">A method for the inhibition of plant growth which comprises applying thereto an effective amount of 2 \u2014 chloroethylphosphonic acid [hereafter 2-CEPA].<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b918-8\">The chronology of applications is as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b918-9\">Party Fritz Party Weil</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b918-10\">Application Serial No. 617,860 (hereafter Fritz I) filed February 23,1967; abandoned December 1,1969 applicants: Fritz and Evans</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"Am6X\">Application Serial No. 693,698 (hereafter Fritz II) filed December 27,1967; abandoned April 2,1970 continuation-in-part of Fritz I applicants: Fritz and Evans (amendment approved March 27, 1970 adding Cooke as joint inventor</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b918-18\">Application Serial No. 826,663 filed May 21, 1969</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b918-19\">Application Serial No. 869,386 (hereafter Fritz III) filed October 24, 1969 continuation-in-part of Fritz II applicants: Fritz, Evans, and Cooke</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"aym-dedup-0\">Application Serial No. 221,803 (Fritz IV) filed January 28,1972 division of Fritz III applicants: Fritz, Evans, and Cooke</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b918-23\">The interference was declared on September 7, 1971, between Weil and Fritz III. In the declaration of interference, the patent interference examiner accorded Fritz III the benefit of Fritz I and II, making Weil the junior party. Fritz thereafter filed Fritz IV and moved to substitute Fritz IV for Fritz III.</p>\n<p id=\"b918-26\">Weil moved to shift the burden of proof,<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> i. e., to deny Fritz III the benefit of the filing dates of Fritz I and II under 37 CFR 1.231(a)(4),<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> on the ground that Fritz I and II \u201care not consistent regarding inventor-ship with the later-filed application [Fritz III].\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b918-27\">The primary examiner granted Fritz\u2019s motion to substitute Fritz IV, awarding that application the benefit of Fritz I, II, and III, and denied Weil\u2019s motion to shift the burden of proof, ruling that Fritz IV was entitled to the earlier dates under 35 U.S.C. \u00a7 120<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> because the inventorship in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"859\">*859</page-number>Fritz II had been properly corrected under 35 U.S.C. \u00a7 116.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> The primary examiner cited <em>In re Schmidt, </em>293 F.2d 274, 48 CCPA 1140, 130 USPQ 404 (1961), as \u201ccompletely apposite here.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b919-5\">Weil petitioned the Commissioner to review the action of the primary examiner in refusing to shift the burden of proof. The Commissioner, denying Weil\u2019s petition, stated: \u201cThe question of burden of proof is ancillary to priority and is reviewable at final hearing by the Board of Patent Interferences, and in the courts if desired.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b919-6\">Weil petitioned this court for a writ of mandamus ordering the Commissioner to grant the motion to shift the burden of proof. We denied that petition. <em>Weil v. Dann, </em>503 F.2d 562, 183 USPQ 300 (Cust. &amp; Pat.App.1974).</p>\n<p id=\"b919-7\">Fritz, the senior party, then took testimony-in-chief and Weil took rebuttal testimony. After Fritz\u2019s testimony-in-chief, Weil filed a second motion to deny Fritz IV the benefit of the filing dates of Fritz I and II on the following basis:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b919-8\">Testimony adduced from witnesses of the party Fritz et al., during its testimony-in-chief, has revealed, for the first time in this interference, that:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b919-14\">1. Long prior to the filing of the earliest of the aforementioned applications, Fritz et al contemplated a preferred mode of carrying out the method of the count;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b919-15\">2. The said preferred mode was the best mode contemplated by Fritz et al for carrying out the invention defined by the count; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b919-16\">3. Notwithstanding the mandate of 35 U.S.C. \u00a7 112, first paragraph<footnotemark>8</footnotemark>, Fritz et al did not disclose the best mode known to them in either of the aforementioned applications. [Footnote omitted.]</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b919-17\">******</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b919-18\">The count * * * pertains to a method of inhibiting plant growth by applying 2-chloroethylphosphonic acid [2-CEPA], * * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b919-19\">The [2-CEPA] is soluble in water and is normally applied to the plants in the form of an aqueous solution. * * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b919-20\">******</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b919-21\">The testimony reveals that by no later than the end of 1965, the party Fritz et al and others at Amchem regarded the 2-chloroethylphosphonic acid to be unstable and susceptible to decomposition when contained in water solution having a pH greater than about 4.5. The evidence <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"860\">*860</page-number>further shows Fritz et al contemplated that the application of the acid material to plants in water solution is preferably effected under certain operating conditions to prevent or avoid the detrimental effects of such decomposition. [Footnote omitted.]</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b920-4\">Specifically, it was contemplated by Fritz et al that solution conditions be used which would maintain the pH below about 4.5 and/or that a spray or application solution of 2-chloroethylphosphonic acid be applied to the plants promptly after formulating the spray solution, particularly if the solutions were made up with neutral or alkaline water.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b920-5\">Fritz et al-, and others at Amchem, clearly considered the pH sensitivity of water solutions of 2-chloroethylphos-phonic acid to be a significant factor in proper use of the acid in accordance with the method of the count. They determined a preferred operating condition well prior to their earliest application filing date. The testimony fully supports the contention herein, and the most exhaustive inspection of the two earliest Fritz et al applications will not locate any reference to the contemplated best mode of carrying out the method of the count.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b920-7\">Failure to advise potential users of the method of the count, in either of the first two Fritz et al applications, of important preferred operating conditions, i.e., maintaining solutions of 2-chloroethylphos-phonic acid at a pH of less than about 4.5 and using the solutions promptly, constitutes failure to disclose a known best mode, in contravention of the provisions of 35 U.S.C. \u00a7 112. This failure to disclose deprives Fritz et al of the right to receive the benefit of the filing dates of these applications under 35 U.S.C. \u00a7 120.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b920-8\">Consideration of Weil\u2019s second motion was deferred to final hearing.</p>\n<p id=\"b920-9\">\n<em>The Board</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b920-10\">The board sustained the primary examiner\u2019s denial of Weil\u2019s motion to shift the burden of proof (the first motion to deny the benefit of Fritz I and II). The board\u2019s opinion on this issue was:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b920-11\">Weil, in urging that Fritz is not entitled to benefit of Fritz I or Fritz II, asserts (main brief, page 14):</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b920-12\">Implicit from the rationale underlying the party Weil\u2019s position advanced above are two critical factors. First, there is a difference between (i) converting, as contemplated by 35 U.S.C. \u00a7 116, the inventorship in a <em>single, given </em>application, and (ii) obtaining, under the provisions of 35 U.S.C. \u00a7 120 the benefit of the filing date of an earlier filed application where the inventor-ship entity has been changed in the later filed application. Second, in obtaining the benefit of an earlier filed application, there is an important difference between joining (i) too many, and (ii) too few inventors in the earlier filed case.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b920-13\">and concludes (reply brief, page 8):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b920-14\">It is apparent that under these circumstances, absent entitlement to the first application [Fritz I], Fritz et al cannot benefit from the second application [Fritz II] because of its fatally defective declaration.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b920-15\">We disagree. From a study of the details of pertinent cases, and comparison of them to the situation here, it is our opinion that Fritz was properly accorded at least the filing date of Fritz II as his effective filing date, which date is prior to the effective filing date of Weil.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b920-16\">Both parties discuss in their briefs a significant case relating to the issue of conversion: <em>In re Schmidt, </em>48 CCPA 1140, 293 F.2d 274, 130 USPQ 404 (1961). This case holds that 35 USC 116 is \u201cremedial in nature and as such should be liberally construed in order that \u2018errors\u2019 may be readily rectified.\u201d <em>Schmidt </em>elaborates ([48 CCPA at 1148, 293 F.2d at 279,] 130 USPQ [at] 409-10):</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b921-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"861\">*861</page-number>It is, we believe, the correct interpretation of congressional intent that the expression \u201cerror * * * without any deceptive intention\u201d in section 116 was intended not only to replace the more cumbersome expression \u201cinadvertence, accident or mistake\u201d previously used but was intended to relieve applicants from the narrow application of the old terms as the courts had construed them. Every indicator of legislative intent points in that direction.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b921-5\">The term \u201cthe same inventor\u201d as used in section 120 does not have the literal, narrow technical meaning the solicitor would have us assign to it. It must be construed with all other relevant sections of the statute, including sections 116 and 256 and thus it embraces the possibility permitted by sections 116 and 256 that the earlier application may be corrected thereunder by changes in the name or names of the applicants under the conditions stated in section 116.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b921-6\">We hold, therefore, that appellant was entitled under section 116 to correct the errors in the intermediate application filed in the names of joint inventors and under section 120 was entitled as \u201cthe same inventor\u201d to the benefits of the filing dates of the earlier co-pending applications .</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b921-7\">We find nothing in the statute (35 USC 116), the decisions of our appellate tribunals or the Rules of Practice (37 CFR 1.45) which supports Weil\u2019s two basic contentions noted above. <em>Schmidt </em>makes it clear that the liberal provisions of 35 USC 116 apply equally to those conversions affecting benefit pursuant to 35 USC 120. Nor do we find authority for attaching any significance to the difference between joining \u201ctoo many\u201d or \u201ctoo few inventors.\u201d No reason is seen to exempt the instant case from the liberal provisions outlined in <em>Schmidt. </em>Compare, inter alia, <em>Patterson v. Hauck, </em>52 CCPA 987, 341 F.2d 131, 144 USPQ 481 (1965); and <em>Ex parte Lechtenberg, </em>146 USPQ 551 (Bd.App.1964). Manifest lack of diligence may provide basis for improper conversion. <em>Van Otteren </em>v. <em>Hafner, </em>47 CCPA 993, 278 F.2d 738, 126 USPQ 151 (1960). However, no such lack of diligence on the part of Fritz has been alleged by Weil or is evident here.</p>\n<p id=\"b921-9\">We therefore find no improper conversion on the part of Fritz which would deny him senior party status.</p>\n<p id=\"b921-10\">Next, the board considered Weil\u2019s second motion to deny the benefit of the \u2022 filing dates of Fritz I and II. The board\u2019s opinion on this issue was:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b921-11\">A party to an interference \u201cis entitled to the benefit of the filing date of a previously filed application when the requirements of 35 U.S.C. 120 are satisfied.\u201d <em>Martin v. Johnson, </em>[59 CCPA 769,] 454 F.2d 746,172 USPQ 391 (CCPA 1972). Compare <em>Kawai v. Metlesics, </em>480 F.2d 880,178 USPQ 158 (CCPA 1973). Section .120 requires that the application of whose filing date the benefit is sought discloses the invention \u201c . . .in the manner provided by the first paragraph of section 112 of [Title 35]\u201d and \u00a7 112, first paragraph, requires, inter alia, that \u201c[t]he specification . . . shall set forth the best mode contemplated by the inventor of carrying out his invention.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b921-14\">Weil would have us look into Fritz\u2019 benefit applications to determine whether the \u201cbest mode\u201d requirement of \u00a7 112 has been complied with. However, the prevailing authority is that the issue of \u201cbest mode\u201d is not \u201cancillary\u201d to priority and, therefore, this Board cannot consider the issue. <em>Thompson v. Dunn, </em>35 CCPA 957, 166 F.2d 443, 77 USPQ 49 (1948).<footnotemark>*</footnotemark> We note that Weil has not alleged that the enabling requirement of \u00a7 112, as discussed in <em>Martin [v. Johnson, </em>59 CCPA at 775, 454 F.2d at 751] 172 USPQ [at] 395, has not been met by Fritz.</p>\n<p id=\"b921-17\">Accordingly, Weil\u2019s motion * * * is dismissed as being drawn to subject mat<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"862\">*862</page-number>ter not proper for consideration by this Board pursuant to 37 CFR 1.258.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b922-4\">* * * * * *</p>\n<p id=\"b922-5\">From the record before us, and within the limits of our jurisdiction, we hold that Fritz is entitled to an effective filing date no later than the filing date of Fritz II. Thus, priority of invention was awarded to Fritz because Weil stood on his filing date which was later than that of Fritz II.</p>\n<p id=\"b922-6\">Reconsideration was denied, but the board commented on Weil\u2019s request for reconsideration as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b922-7\">We in no way held, as misconstrued by Weil, that we are \u201cin agreement [with Weil] that the party Fritz et al. is not entitled to the benefit of the first Fritz et al. application [Fritz I].\u201d We held, rather, that inasmuch as Fritz et al. are entitled to the benefit of Fritz II, the question of whether they are entitled to the benefit of Fritz I is of no moment in this case.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b922-8\">Nor has Weil cited authority to support his present contention that the holding in <em>Thompson v. Dunn </em>(cited in our decision should be limited to the involved application as opposed to a benefit application. Moreover, the prevailing authority is contra. In considering whether an application supports the counts, the same requirements apply whether it is the involved application or one whose benefit is sought. <em>Noyce v. Kilby, </em>57 CCPA 1156, 416 F.2d 1391,163 USPQ 550 (1969); cert. den. [400 U.S. 818, 91 S.Ct. 34, 27 L.Ed.2d 45] 167 USPQ 257 [(1970)].</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b922-12\">OPINION</p>\n<p id=\"b922-13\">\n<em>The Issues</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b922-14\">The issues are:</p>\n<p id=\"b922-15\">(1) Whether Fritz IV is entitled under 35 U.S.C. \u00a7 120 to the benefit of Fritz II\u2019s filing date in view of the amended inventive entity in Fritz II?</p>\n<p id=\"b922-16\">(2) Whether the \u201cbest mode\u201d question\u2014 the alleged nondisclosure in Fritz II of the \u201cbest mode\u201d as required by 35 U.S.C. \u00a7 112, first paragraph, and incorporated in 35 U.S.C. \u00a7 120 \u2014 is ancillary to priority (i. e., within the board\u2019s jurisdiction) where Fritz IV was accorded the benefit of Fritz II?</p>\n<p id=\"b922-17\">\n<em>The First Issue</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b922-18\">Noting that the board \u201crelied heavily\u201d on <em>In re Schmidt, </em>supra, Weil contends that \u201cthere is more to this issue than merely adding too many [sic, too few?] inventors to an application as will be hereinafter set out.\u201d Weil then attacks the board\u2019s decision with respect to this issue on three grounds.</p>\n<p id=\"b922-19\">The first ground is that the conversion declaration filed in Fritz II, which states that Fritz II is a continuation-in-part of Fritz I, is \u201cfatally defective\u201d because Fritz I was <em>\u201cnever converted to three inventors.\u201d </em>(Weil\u2019s emphasis.) As we understand it, Weil contends that the conversion declaration filed in Fritz II, amending the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"863\">*863</page-number>inventive entity to three applicants, is defective because it claims the benefit of Fritz I, filed by two applicants and never amended.</p>\n<p id=\"b923-5\">This argument must fall in light of 35 USC 120, supra note 6, as interpreted by this court in <em>In re Schmidt. </em>That case involved an application (Schmidt III) filed by Schmidt as sole applicant. Under \u00a7 120, Schmidt III claimed the benefit of Schmidt I, filed by Schmidt sole, and Schmidt II, filed by Schmidt and five others. During the prosecution of Schmidt III, affidavits were submitted which established that the five other applicants had joined in Schmidt II \u201cthrough error * * * without any deceptive intention\u201d (35 U.S.C. \u00a7 116, third paragraph, supra note 7). The inventive entity in Schmidt II was not amended in fact.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> Nevertheless, as stated in <em>Schmidt, </em>293 F.2d at 279, 48 CCPA at 1148, 130 USPQ at 409-10 (quoted supra in the board\u2019s opinion), Schmidt III was entitled in law to the benefit of the filing dates of Schmidt I and II under 35 U.S.C. \u00a7 120. The term \u201cthe same inventor\u201d in \u00a7 120 was broadly interpreted to embrace the possibility permitted by \u00a7 116, third paragraph. Even though Schmidt II was not amended in fact, the procedure employed was legally equivalent to such an amendment. <em>In re Schmidt </em>was decided correctly and it disposes of Weil\u2019s argument.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b923-7\">Weil\u2019s second ground of attack, as stated in his main brief on appeal, is: \u201c[Fritz II] is defective in that its <em>oath </em>or declaration does not aver that such subject matter common to the Fritz et al. I application and Fritz et al. II application is not barred by any activity more than one year prior to the Fritz et al. II application filing date.\u201d (Emphasis added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b923-8\">Weil\u2019s contention is not material to the question of Fritz IV\u2019s entitlement under \u00a7 120 to the benefit of Fritz II. The applicant\u2019s <em>oath </em>is not a requirement of \u00a7 112, first paragraph, but of 35 U.S.C. \u00a7 115; therefore, the sufficiency of Fritz II\u2019s oath is not material under \u00a7 120, which incorporates only the requirements of \u00a7 112, first paragraph.</p>\n<p id=\"b923-12\">Weil\u2019s third (and final) ground of attack is: \u201cThe count of the Interference is not patentable to the party Fritz et al. by reason that the invention described in the count was invented by another prior to the filing date of Fritz et al. Ill and as such is prior art in the sense of 35 U.S.C. 102(g).\u201d Weil generates this argument by linking three things: (1) the board\u2019s reconsideration opinion which stated that the question of whether Fritz IV was entitled to the benefit of Fritz I \u201cis of no moment in this case;\u201d (2) Weil\u2019s own \u201cunavoidable conclusion,\u201d from the board\u2019s foregoing statement, that Fritz I is by \u201canother inventor\u201d under 35 U.S.C. \u00a7 102(g); and, (3) <em>In re Bass, </em>59 CCPA 1342, 474 F.2d 1276, 177 USPQ 178 (1973).</p>\n<p id=\"b923-13\">Weil\u2019s argument is unsound because the board was <em>correct </em>\u2014 the <em>question of whether Fritz IV is entitled to the benefit of Fritz I is immaterial in this interference. </em>See note 11, supra. Weil has <em>no basis </em>for concluding that Fritz I is evidence that the invention of the count was made \u201cby another\u201d and therefore is prior art under 35 U.S.C. \u00a7 102(g). To the contrary, the amendment of Fritz II indicates that the subject matter of the count was invented by the three applicants (Fritz, Evans, and Cooke). Therefore, any disclosure in Fritz I of the invention of the count would be a disclosure of the three applicants\u2019 own invention. \u201cBut certainly <em>one\u2019s own invention, </em>whatever the form of disclosure to the public, may not be prior art against oneself, <em>absent, a statutory bar.\u201d In re Facius, </em>408 F.2d 1396, 1406, 56 CCPA 1348, 1358, 161 USPQ 294, 302 (1969) (emphasis in original).</p>\n<p id=\"b923-14\">We <em>affirm </em>the board on the first issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b924-3\">\n<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"864\">*864</page-number>\n<em>The Second Issue</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b924-4\">According to Weil\u2019s second motion (to deny Fritz IV the benefit of the filing dates of Fritz I and II), 2-CEPA is soluble in water and is \u201cnormally\u201d applied in an \u201caqueous solution.\u201d The motion alleged that Fritz, prior to Fritz I\u2019s filing, \u201cregarded [2-CEPA] to be unstable and susceptible to decomposition when contained in water solution having a pH greater than about 4.5\u201d and that Fritz contemplated using solutions \u201cwhich would maintain the pH below about 4.5 and/or that a spray or application solution of [2-CEPA] be applied to the plants promptly after formulating the spray solution, particularly if the solutions were made up with neutral or alkaline water.\u201d Weil urged that nondisclosure of these \u201cpreferred operating conditions\u201d constituted failure to disclose a \u201cknown best mode, in contravention of 35 U.S.C. \u00a7 112,\u201d depriving Fritz IV of \u201cthe right to receive the benefit of the filing dates of [Fritz I and II] under 35 U.S.C. \u00a7 120.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b924-5\">Fritz II, the material application (see note 11, supra), has Examples 35 and 42 which describe spraying certain plants with \u201caqueous solutions\u201d of 2-CEPA, without disclosure of pH sensitivity. Hence, this nondisclosure of the alleged \u201cpreferred operating conditions\u201d for 2-CEPA was the basis of Weil\u2019s second motion.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b924-6\">The board, citing <em>Thompson </em>v. <em>Dunn, </em>166 F.2d 443, 35 CCPA 957, 77 USPQ 49 (1948), understandably held that \u201cthe issue of \u2018best mode\u2019 is not \u2018ancillary\u2019 to priority\u201d and dismissed this motion on jurisdictional grounds as raising an issue \u201cnot proper for consideration by this Board pursuant to 37 CFR 1.258 [supra note 9].\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b924-8\">Weil attacks the board\u2019s decision as \u201cclearly erroneous in view of recent developments and a clear reading of 35 U.S.C. \u00a7 120.\u201d His principal argument is:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b924-9\">The statutory basis for applicant(s) to obtain the benefit of an earlier filing date is 35 USC 120. Section 120 states in part that the earlier application must disclose the invention in the manner provided by the first paragraph of Section 112, and Section 112 unequivocally states in clear and unambiguous terms that the \u201cspecification . . . shall set forth the best mode contemplated by the inventor of carrying out his invention.\u201d It is not seen how the Board can avoid this issue with this clear and unequivocal language in the statute. It is believed that this portion of the statute clearly conveys jurisdiction on the Board when the questioi) of best mode is raised when an applicant requests and is granted relief under the provisions of 35 USC 120.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"aa3-dedup-0\">Weil distinguishes <em>Thompson v. Dunn </em>on the ground that Thompson was not claiming the benefit of an earlier U.S. application.</p>\n<p id=\"b924-11\">Fritz, on the other hand, defends the board\u2019s decision by quoting the relevant portion of <em>Thompson v. Dunn, </em>which we designate as [A]:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b924-12\">[A]</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b924-13\">Counsel for appellee [Dunn] argue that as appellant [Thompson] considered the machine built by his associate McGihon to embody the best form of his invention and that, since appellant did not disclose <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"865\">*865</page-number>that machine in his application, he has not complied with Sec. 4888, R.S. (U.S.C., title 35, sec. 33) which requires that an inventor shall disclose \u201cthe best mode in which he has contemplated applying\u201d the principle of his invention. <em>That argument does not relate to priority of invention, but merely to appellant\u2019s right to obtain a patent. </em>[Fritz\u2019s emphasis.] Accordingly, it cannot properly be considered by this court in an interference proceeding. [35 CCPA at 964,166 F.2d at 447-48, 77 USPQ at 53.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b925-5\">And, in response to Weil\u2019s argument that <em>Thompson v. Dunn </em>is distinguishable, Fritz quotes this portion of <em>Mahan v. Doumani, </em>333 F.2d 896, 902, 51 CCPA 1516, 1522, 142 USPQ 19, 23 (1964), which we designate as [B]:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b925-6\">[B]</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b925-7\">The [parent] 1944 application [of appellee, Doumani], in order to support the counts, need not list the specific fuels of the counts as \u201cthe best mode contemplated by the inventor of carrying out his invention\u201d (35 U.S.C. \u00a7 112). Only a \u201cwritten description of the invention\u201d must be found in the 1944 application when considered in its entirety. See <em>Hall v. Taylor </em>(PA 7158), 51 CCPA 1420, 332 F.2d 844, 141 USPQ 821 [(1964)].</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b925-8\">At oral argument, Fritz\u2019s counsel also cited two sentences in <em>Squires v. Corbett, </em>560 F.2d 424, 433,194 USPQ 513, 519 (Cust. &amp; Pat.App.1977), which we designate as [C]:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b925-9\">[C]</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b925-10\">The \u201ccount\u201d * * * is merely the vehicle for contesting priority which, in the opinion of the Commissioner, effectively circumscribes the interfering subject matter, thereby determining what evidence will be regarded as relevant on the issue of priority. The \u201ccount,\u201d as distinguished from a party\u2019s \u201cclaim,\u201d need not be patentable to either party in the sense of being fully supported by either party\u2019s disclosure.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b925-15\">Based on [C], counsel urged that \u201clooking for best mode is like looking for surplus-age,\u201d that \u201cthere is no need to have best mode disclosed provided you have a written description of the invention * * * in the earlier application,\u201d and that the issue is what is meant by \u201cthe right to rely on a constructive reduction to practice \u2014 in an earlier-filed application \u2014 of the count?\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b925-16\">The second issue, as stated earlier, is whether the best mode question \u2014 the alleged nondisclosure in Fritz II of the best mode as required by 35 U.S.C. \u00a7 112, first paragraph, and incorporated in 35 U.S.C. \u00a7 120 \u2014 is ancillary to priority (i. e., within the board\u2019s jurisdiction <footnotemark>14</footnotemark>) where Fritz IV was accorded the benefit of Fritz II. We hold that it is.</p>\n<p id=\"b925-17\">Weil\u2019s second motion sought to deny Fritz IV the benefit of Fritz II\u2019s filing date. Thus, it, like Weil\u2019s first motion, was a motion to shift the burden of proof,<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> that is, it sought to shift the burden of proof from Weil to Fritz. The motion, if granted, would make Weil the senior party and Fritz the junior party because it would deny Fritz the benefit of Fritz II and Weil\u2019s application was filed before Fritz III.</p>\n<p id=\"b925-18\">Fritz had achieved senior-party status by accordation of the benefit of Fritz II\u2019s filing date under the provisions of 35 U.S.C. \u00a7 120, which incorporates the entire first paragraph of 35 U.S.C. \u00a7 112,<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> so Weil <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"866\">*866</page-number>based his attack on one of the requirements underlying that statutory benefit accordation procedure.</p>\n<p id=\"b926-4\">This court, in <em>Myers v. Feigelman, </em>455 F.2d 596, 600, 59 CCPA 834, 840, 172 USPQ 580, 584 (1972), held that the question of the burden of proof on a junior party in an interference was ancillary to priority because \u201cit is a question which is \u2018logically related\u2019 to the basic, jurisdiction-giving question of priority because it should be decided, logically, before the board or this court can pass on the sufficiency of the junior party\u2019s proofs.\u201d <footnotemark>17</footnotemark> The same reasoning, with even greater force, applies to the question of which party has the burden of proof.<footnotemark>18</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b926-5\">With regard to <em>Thompson v. Dunn; </em>supra [A], it is true, as [A] states, that the best mode disclosure requirement (in what is now \u00a7 112, first paragraph) relates to an applicant\u2019s \u201cright to obtain a patent.\u201d But [A] does not recognize that the best mode disclosure requirement has other functions, as in this case, where it is one of the conditions precedent in the \u00a7 120 benefit-accordation procedure,<footnotemark>19</footnotemark> a procedure that here determines which party has the burden of proof (a question that must be logically related to the jurisdiction-giving issue of priority). Hence, we hold that when a \u00a7 120 benefit is sought, the best mode disclosure requirement is ancillary to priority. Therefore, the conclusion of law in <em>Thompson v. Dunn, </em>supra [A], is overruled to the extent that it is inconsistent with our present holding.</p>\n<p id=\"b926-9\">For the same reason, the conclusion of law in <em>Mahan </em>v. <em>Doumani, </em>supra [B], also is overruled to the extent that it is inconsistent with our present holding.</p>\n<p id=\"b926-10\">Finally, Fritz argues that the board\u2019s decision is supported by <em>Squires v. Corbett, </em>supra [C], but the last sentence of [C] refers to \u201cphantom\u201d count practice and modified patent claim practice, special situations not present here. Furthermore, [C] must be considered with the ultimate conclusion of law in <em>Squires v. Corbett:</em></p>\n<blockquote id=\"b926-11\">We conclude that for an applicant to have a right to copy a patent claim he must have support for the full scope of the claim. See <em>Hunt v. Treppschuh </em>[523 F.2d 1386,] at 1389, 187 USPQ [426,] at 429 [Cust. &amp; Pat.App.1975]. This conclusion rests on the recognition that the right to make a claim in a pending application, even for purposes of interference, depends, as it does with all pending claims, on compliance, with the requirements of 35 U.S.C. \u00a7 112, first paragraph. There is no other standard. * * * [560 F.2d at 435, 194 USPQ at 520.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b927-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"867\">*867</page-number>Thus, our present holding is not inconsistent with <em>Squires v. Corbett.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b927-5\">In view of the foregoing, the board should not have dismissed Weil\u2019s second motion for lack of jurisdiction. Accordingly, we <em>reverse </em>the board on the second issue, and we <em>remand </em>for further proceedings, including consideration of Weil\u2019s second motion on its merits (we express no view on the merits of that motion) and consideration of the priority testimony (for completeness, i. e., to obviate another remand).</p>\n<p id=\"b927-6\">\n<em>Summary</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b927-7\">The board\u2019s decision on the first issue is affirmed; the board\u2019s decision on the second issue is <em>reversed </em>and the case is <em>remanded </em>for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b927-8\">\n<em>REVERSED AND REMANDED.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b918-12\">.

A party shall not be entitled to raise such non-patentability unless he has duly presented a motion for dissolution under \u00a7 1.231 upon such ground or shows good reason (e. g., that such nonpatentability became evident as a result of evidence extrinsic to an involved application) why such a motion was not presented; however, to prevent manifest injustice the Board of Patent Interferences may in its discretion consider a matter of this character even though it was not raised by motion under \u00a7 1.231.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b922-21\">(b) At final hearing a party shall not be entitled to urge consideration of a matter relating to the benefit of an earlier application of his own or of another party unless he has presented such matter in connection with a motion under \u00a7 1.231(a)(4), or shows good reason why it was not so presented.</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"10\">\n<p id=\"b923-15\">.
