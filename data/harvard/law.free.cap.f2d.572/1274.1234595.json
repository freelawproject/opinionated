We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b1334-18\">King was arrested on June 22, 1977, in Forrest City, Arkansas, and charged with possession of a 1974 Dodge van that had been stolen in Memphis, Tennessee, on June 8,1977. King\u2019s defense at trial was that he did not know the van was stolen. He testified that he obtained the van in Forrest City from Anthony Laird, who gave him a bill of sale and a \u201cpink slip.\u201d Laird allegedly told King that he had purchased the van in Arkansas with money won in a crap game.</p>\n<p id=\"b1334-19\">Laird testified at King\u2019s trial as a government witness. In addition to testifying that he did not give King a pink slip for the van, he described three prior occasions on which he participated with King in stealing and stripping other vehicles. According to Laird, in 1976 he and King \u201chot-wired\u201d a 1976 Mark IV in a Tupelo, Mississippi, parking lot and drove it to Memphis. Sometime later, Laird helped King and his brother strip two Buicks with Illinois license plates. Shortly before King\u2019s arrest, Laird went for a ride with King in a Lincoln Town Car; Laird asked King where he got \u201cthe wheels,\u201d and King responded, \u201cYou know what it is.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1334-20\">King argues on appeal that the trial court erred in admitting Laird\u2019s testimony regarding the other vehicles.</p>\n<p id=\"b1334-21\">Evidence of other crimes or acts is admissible under Rule 404(b) of the Federal Rules <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1275\">*1275</page-number>of Evidence<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> to prove motive, opportunity, intent, preparation, plan, knowledge, identity, or absence of mistake or accident. Knowledge that the vehicle was stolen is an element of the section 2312 charge, and King\u2019s sole defense was lack of knowledge. Laird\u2019s testimony was relevant to this issue, for it demonstrated that King had stolen cars in the past and was familiar with methods of stealing and stripping vehicles.</p>\n<p id=\"b1335-5\">Although relevant, evidence of other crimes must also pass the test of Rule 403,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> which allows the trial court to exclude evidence if the danger of unfair prejudice outweighs its probative value. King argues that the inherent prejudicial nature of other crimes evidence required exclusion of Laird\u2019s testimony, which he characterizes as \u201cvague and speculative\u201d <footnotemark>4</footnotemark> and therefore of minimal probative value.</p>\n<p id=\"b1335-6\">We find this argument unconvincing. Although Laird did not testify at great detail about the acts in question, his testimony was concrete and specific, not \u201cvague and speculative.\u201d Moreover, the trial court diminished the danger of unfair prejudice by giving a full and timely instruction to the jury on the limited purpose for which they could consider Laird\u2019s testimony.</p>\n<p id=\"b1335-7\">The trial court did not err in denying King\u2019s motion, and the judgment of conviction is affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1334-22\">.
