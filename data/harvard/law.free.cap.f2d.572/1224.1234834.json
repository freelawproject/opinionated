The district court entered a judgment of dismissal,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> and the United States brings this timely appeal. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b1286-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1226\">*1226</page-number>The parties stipulated all of the facts, which we summarize. At 6:00 a. m. on November 16, 1973, the four-member crew of Frisco Train No. 822 reported for duty at the crew\u2019s \u201chome\u201d terminal, namely, Chaffee, Missouri. The train departed Chaffee at 8:00 a. m. for a \u201cthrough\u201d trip to the St. Louis, Missouri, terminal at Lindenwood Yard, 138 miles north of Chaffee. St. Louis was the \u201caway-from-home\u201d terminal for the crew.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1286-4\">At 10:40 a. m., the train arrived at Crystal City, Missouri, which is 105 miles north of Chaffee and 33 miles south of St. Louis. Because Lindenwood Yard at St. Louis was congested and could not accommodate the train, Frisco elected to release the four crew members from duty at 11:45 a. m. at Crystal City. Adequate facilities for food and lodging were available to the crew at Crystal City.</p>\n<p id=\"b1286-5\">Crystal City was not a \u201chome\u201d or \u201caway-from-home\u201d terminal for this crew or for other crews assigned to trains operating from Chaffee to St. Louis, nor was it so specified or indicated in any collective bargaining agreement or bulletin for crews assigned to trains operating from Chaffee to St. Louis. However, Crystal City, according to provisions of the collective bargaining agreements did serve as a \u201chome\u201d or \u201caway-from-home\u201d terminal for another Frisco train crew assignment.</p>\n<p id=\"b1286-6\">Following a relief of nine hours and fifteen minutes, the crew of Train No. 822 returned to duty at 9:00 p. m.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> The train departed Crystal City at 10:50 p. m. and arrived at the \u201caway-from-home\u201d terminal, Lindenwood Yard, at 1:25 a. m. on November 17, 1973. At this time, a total of nineteen hours and twenty-five minutes had elapsed from the time the crew had commenced duty at Chaffee.</p>\n<p id=\"b1286-13\">The Government in this action contends that Frisco violated the Hours of Service Act by requiring the four crew members to remain on duty for more than twelve hours. It counts the time spent by the crew at Crystal City as duty time under the Act. Frisco argues to the contrary. On this appeal, we must determine whether Crystal City constituted a \u201cdesignated terminal\u201d under the provisions of the Act. If it does, the time spent there by the crew is not deemed \u201cduty\u201d time and Frisco is not in violation of the Act.</p>\n<p id=\"b1286-14\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b1286-15\">Under 45 U.S.C. \u00a7 62(a)(1),<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> it is unlawful for a common carrier, such as Frisco, to require or permit an employee who has been continuously on duty for twelve hours to go on duty or to continue on duty until the employee has had at least ten consecutive hours off duty. What constitutes time on duty is determined by 45 U.S.C. \u00a7 61(b)(3).<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Interim periods for rest at other than a designated terminal constitute \u201ctime on duty\u201d for purposes of the Act. The parties agree that an interim period available for rest for four hours or more at a \u201cdesignated terminal\u201d does not constitute \u201ctime on duty\u201d under the Act. Hence, if the Government establishes Crystal City as a place \u201cother than a designated terminal,\u201d the crew must be deemed on duty for more than seven hours beyond the twelve-hour duty time permitted by the Act and the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1227\">*1227</page-number>Railroad must accordingly be deemed guilty of violations of that Act. But if Crystal City qualifies as a designated terminal under the stipulated facts, the crew would be deemed on duty for purposes of the Act for less time than twelve hours and the facts would not establish any violation by the Railroad.</p>\n<p id=\"b1287-5\">The Government interprets the term \u201cdesignated terminal,\u201d as used in section 61(b)(3)(A), to mean a railroad terminal established in or under a collective bargaining agreement as the \u201chome\u201d terminal or \u201caway-from-home\u201d terminal for the particular crew assignment, provided that the terminal has adequate facilities for food and lodging. According to the Government, because Crystal City was not the \u201chome\u201d or \u201caway-from-home\u201d terminal for this particular crew assignment, it was not a \u201cdesignated terminal\u201d under the Act.</p>\n<p id=\"b1287-6\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b1287-7\">The statute does not define the term \u201cdesignated terminal.\u201d In its report on the 1969 legislation,<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> the Senate Committee on Commerce stated with respect to the provision now in question:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1287-8\">The phrase \u201cdesignated terminals\u201d in section 1(b)(3)(A) and (B) is intended to have that meaning commonly recognized in the railroad industry. The committee is advised that collective bargaining agreements provide a commonly understood definition for this term. As a minimum the committee intends that the term should mean generally a place where suitable food and lodging are available for employees. [S.Rep.No.91-604, 91st Cong., 1st Sess., 1969 U.S.Code Cong. &amp; Admin.News, pp. 1636, 1640.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1287-9\">Although the Senate Committee refers to collective bargaining agreements as providing the commonly understood definition of this term, the stipulation of the parties indicates that collective bargaining agreements between railroads and railroad unions rarely use the term \u201cdesignated terminal.\u201d The parties stipulated as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"Aky\">The collective bargaining agreements representing those crafts or classes of employees whose work involves them in the actual operations of trains, use the phrase \u201cdesignated terminal\u201d in only one instance in each of said agreements. Such agreements do, however, contain a number of references to \u201cdesignated home terminal\u201d and \u201caway-from-home terminal\u201d.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1287-12\">Portions of six collective bargaining agreements involving major railroads were stipulated into evidence. In one of the agreements, the term \u201cdesignated terminal\u201d is used in conjunction with \u201chome\u201d and \u201caway-from-home\u201d terminals for the purpose of allocating crew assignments. Otherwise, railroad terminals are referred to as \u201chome\u201d or \u201caway-from-home\u201d terminals or as \u201cestablished\u201d for various purposes, for example, to determine the rate of pay for \u201cheld\u201d time. The record establishes neither a common definition nor a consistent use of the term \u201cdesignated terminal\u201d in railroad collective bargaining agreements.</p>\n<p id=\"b1287-13\">The Government contends that testimony given by various railroad industry representatives and others before a subcommittee of the Senate Committee on Commerce, and before a House Committee considering a parallel bill, shows that the industry understood the statutory term of \u201cdesignated terminal\u201d to mean a \u201chome\u201d terminal or an \u201caway-from-home\u201d terminal. The Government relies primarily on testimony given by Mr. R. R. Manion, then vice president of the Association of American Railroads (AAR). In that testimony, Mr. Manion criticized the use of the term \u201cdesignated terminal\u201d in the new legislation, and interpreted that language to refer \u201cto terminals that are \u2018designated\u2019 in [collective bargaining] agreements.\u201d<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> The AAR also advanced an <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1228\">*1228</page-number>amendment to the proposed legislation that would delete the words \u201cother than a designated terminal\u201d and would substitute the words \u201ca place where reasonable facilities for food and rest are not available for employees.\u201d Hearings on S. 1938, <em>supra </em>at 153. The Senate did not adopt the AAR proposal.</p>\n<p id=\"b1288-4\">The comments and proposed amendments of industry representatives offer little assistance in determining Congressional intent. This sort of evidence often reflects an industry\u2019s construction of proposed legislation, taken in the worst light from that industry\u2019s standpoint. After examining the testimony referred to by the Government, the amendment proposed by the AAR, and other legislative history of the provision in question, we agree with the district court that the legislative history is unclear as to the meaning of the term \u201cdesignated terminal.\u201d The strongest evidence of Congressional intent must come from the language of the Act and from comments by the Congress.</p>\n<p id=\"b1288-10\">The excerpt from the Senate Committee report, quoted at p. 1227 <em>supra, </em>carries substantial weight with respect to the Congressional intent. Though the Congress did not define the term \u201cdesignated terminal,\u201d leaving the meaning to collective bargaining agreements, the Committee report emphasized that the term should mean generally \u201ca place where suitable food and lodging are available for employees.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1288-11\">The statute provides for \u201cinterim periods\u201d of rest. This term contemplates an intermediate stopping place for rest between the place where an employee \u201creports for duty\u201d and that where the employee is \u201cfinally released from duty.\u201d<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> Neither the \u201chome\u201d nor the \u201caway-from-home\u201d terminal was an interim point on the train journey here in question, although a \u201chome\u201d or \u201caway-from-home\u201d terminal could constitute an interim point on other train runs. We construe the statutory term \u201cdesignated terminal\u201d as connoting an <em>interim </em>rest point such as Crystal City, not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1229\">*1229</page-number>necessarily limited to \u201chome\u201d and \u201caway-from-home\u201d terminals as those terms are used in collective bargaining agreements.</p>\n<p id=\"b1289-5\">In reaching this conclusion, we are mindful that the purpose of the Act is to promote the safe operation of trains. <em>Atchison, Topeka &amp; Santa Fe Railway Co. v. United States, </em>244 U.S. 336, 342, 37 S.Ct. 635, 61 L.Ed. 1175 (1917); <em>Chicago &amp; Alton Railroad Co. v. United States, 2A7 </em>U.S. 197, 199-200, 38 S.Ct. 578, 62 L.Ed. 1242 (1918). The interpretation offered by appellant United States does not enhance safety but serves only to burden efficient railroading.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1289-6\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b1289-7\">The burden of establishing a violation of the Act by Frisco rested upon the United States. The applicable collective bargaining agreement did not use the language \u201cdesignated terminal.\u201d Frisco released the crew at an interim point in the train journey, Crystal City, for a rest period of more than four hours. The parties have stipulated that adequate facilities for food and lodging were available for the crew at Crystal City. Also, they have stipulated that for at least one Frisco crew assignment, Crystal City is specified under a collective bargaining agreement as a \u201chome\u201d or \u201caway-from-home\u201d terminal. Under these circumstances, the Government failed to prove any violation and we affirm the dismissal of the action.</p>\n<p id=\"b1289-8\">We recognize that the Ninth Circuit has applied a rationale contrary to ours in deciding <em>United States v. Atchison, Topeka &amp; Santa Fe Railway Co., </em>525 F.2d 1184 (9th Cir. 1975), <em>cert. denied, </em>425 U.S. 992, 96 S.Ct. 2204, 48 L.Ed.2d 816 (1976). We do note factual differences in these two cases. In any event, we believe that Chief Judge Meredith has reached a proper result in this case by giving the statute a reading which accords with congressional intent.</p>\n<p id=\"b1289-9\">Affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1285-21\">.

Congress introduced the term \u201cdesignated terminal\u201d into \u00a7 1(b)(3) of the Hours of Service Act, 45 U.S.C. \u00a7 61(b)(3), by the Act of December 26, 1969, Pub.L. 91-169, 83 Stat. 463 (1969), which was designed to update the safety provisions of the Hours of Service Act, originally enacted in 1907.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b1287-15\">. The Government quotes the following testimony of Mr. Manion:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1288-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1228\">*1228</page-number>The pending bills provide that interim periods available for rest shall be counted as time on duty except those lasting 4 or more hours at what are referred to as \u201cdesignated terminals.\u201d The term \u201cinterim period available for rest\u201d is not defined, nor is the term \u201cdesignated terminal.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1288-6\">The existing hours of service statute contains no provision relating to interim rest periods. The Federal courts, in construing the law, have determined that respite periods that are of sufficient duration and are afforded under suitable circumstances should not be counted as time on duty, and that the adequacy of a given rest period is a question of fact in light of all the circumstances. Periods of 2 hours, for example, have been held to be sufficient to be excluded from duty time.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1288-7\">The term \u201cdesignated terminal\u201d is used in the bills to identify the kind of place at which interim rest periods of appropriate length may be excluded from duty time and is distinguished from \u201cother than designated terminals\u201d where all interim periods for rest are counted as time on duty.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1288-8\"><em>The term has significance in relation to the provisions of collective bargaining agreements and refers to terminals that are \u201cdesignated\u201d in such agreements. </em>It does not determine the question whether a given place is one at which suitable rest can be obtained.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1288-9\"><em>Our view is that any place where reasonable facilities for food and rest are available to employees should qualify as the kind of place at which interim rest periods </em>\u2014 of <em>suitable length </em>\u2014 should <em>not count as time on duty. This concept should be substituted for the technical term \u201cdesignated terminal.\u201d </em>Food and rest are the essential physical requirements for a meaningful rest period, and may well be obtainable at places that are not \u201cdesignated\u201d in collective bargaining agreements.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1288-13\">Hearings on S. 1938 before the Subcomm. on Surface Transportation of the Senate Committee on Commerce, 91st Cong., 1st Sess., 138 (1969) (emphasis supplied).

The phrases \u201creports for duty\u201d and \u201cfinally released from duty\u201d as used in 45 U.S.C. \u00a7 61(b)(3) determine, respectively, the points in time when an employee\u2019s duty time commences and terminates. The stipulation of the parties does not state that crew members were finally released from duty upon their arrival at Lindenwood Yard at St. Louis. However, that the crew was finally released there is evident from the computations of duty time advanced by the parties.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"9\">\n<p id=\"b1289-10\">. According to comments of counsel at oral argument, Frisco could have avoided the Government\u2019s charge of violating the Act by transporting the crew 33 miles to St. Louis to rest for at least four hours and then transporting the crew back to Crystal City to continue the movement of the train into th\u00e9 St. Louis yards.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
