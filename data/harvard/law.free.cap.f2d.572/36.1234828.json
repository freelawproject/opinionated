Special Agent Alexander Dombroski, who had issued the summons. The summons had directed Morgan Guaranty Trust Company</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b97-20\">to appear before Special Agent A. Dom-broski, an officer of the Internal Revenue Service, to give testimony relating to the tax liability or the collection of the tax liability of the person identified above for the periods shown and to bring with you and produce for examination the following books, records, papers and other data: <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"38\">*38</page-number>Signature card, ledger sheets, or transcripts of accounts for any and all savings, or checking accounts and Certificates of Deposits in the names of Roger L. and/or Sandra J. Keech covering the period 1972 through 1975. Also, any records, to include application and record of repayments relating to loans, mortgages and letters of credit.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b98-4\">Mr. and Mrs. Keech (the taxpayers) were notified of the issuance of the summons and directed the bank not to comply. Exercising the right given them by I.R.C. \u00a7 7609(b), added by the Tax Reform Act of 1976, they intervened and stayed compliance with the summons.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b98-5\">Taxpayers submitted an opposing affidavit of counsel, alleging that the summons was not issued \u201cin good faith, in that said summons was issued solely in aid of a criminal investigation of the taxpayers.\u201d They contended that such a summons is \u201cimproper, unauthorized and unenforceable.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b98-6\">This claim is rested on three factual bases:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b98-7\">(1) The summons was issued by a Special Agent assigned to the Intelligence Division of the IRS, the function of which is the enforcement of criminal statutes relating to taxes; the Special Agent had issued eleven other summonses during the course of his investigation.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b98-8\">(2) The Special Agent had allegedly stated that he was conducting a \u201ccriminal investigation of Roger Keech.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b98-9\">(3) The summons stated that the investigation related to the four-year period 1972-75 but the taxpayers had been previously audited for 1972 and 1974 and these audits had been completed with a determination of no additional tax due.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b98-10\">For proof of the statement mentioned in (2), taxpayers relied on an affidavit of William G. Woolridge, a tax accountant in the employ of Chromalloy American Corporation (Chromalloy). Woolridge stated that on August 15, 1971, he had been present at the office of Arrow Group Industries, Inc. (Arrow), a Chromalloy subsidiary of which Roger Keech was president, and met with IRS agents including Special Agent Dom-broski, who were conducting an audit of Arrow. As Dombroski left the Arrow premises with Arrow records he had previously requested in connection with his investigation of Keech, an unnamed Arrow employee asked whether production of the records cleared up everything as between Dombro-ski and Arrow. Allegedly Dombroski \u201cresponded in the affirmative and further stated, in substance, that his only remaining interest was in his criminal investigation of Roger Keech.\u201d Taxpayers asked that the Government\u2019s enforcement petition should be dismissed or, in the alternative, that an evidentiary hearing be held to determine whether the summons was issued solely in aid of a criminal investigation, with discovery to precede this.</p>\n<p id=\"b98-13\">The Government countered with a supplemental affidavit of Dombroski and an affidavit of Charles Lazarus, an IRS agent in the Audit Division, which handles civil enforcement. Dombroski stated that in February, 1977, he had been assigned to the investigation of the 1973, 1974 and 1975 returns of the taxpayers jointly with the Audit Division; that the investigation had not yet progressed sufficiently to warrant a decision whether or not to recommend criminal prosecution; and that if he determined not to recommend this, the Audit Division would decide whether there were liabilities for additional taxes and civil fraud penalties. He admitted he had told an Arrow employee, Theodore Beindorf, that he regarded Arrow as having satisfied the sum<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"39\">*39</page-number>mons issued to it but that his investigation of Mr. Keech was ongoing. He denied having used the word \u201ccriminal\u201d although conceding that \u201cin point of fact the joint investigation is criminal as well as civil in nature.\u201d With respect to the third point in counsel\u2019s affidavit, he noted that he was only investigating the Keech\u2019s 1973, 1974 and 1975 returns,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> and that, in accordance with I.R.C. \u00a7 7605(b), the IRS had notified taxpayers that further information made it necessary to reexamine their books and records for 1974. He thus failed to understand the relevance of counsel\u2019s reference to the previous audit. Lazarus affirmed the Audit Division\u2019s participation in the joint investigation. He then stated that he was familiar with the file and that it contained</p>\n<blockquote id=\"Ay\">a) no determination of whether there exists unreported income attributable to the taxpayer for the years in question; b) no determination to recommend criminal prosecution of either Sandra J. Keech or Roger L. Keech and c) no determination of whether grounds exist to institute a civil action seeking to recover additional taxes and/or fraud penalties under the Internal Revenue Code,</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AI-\">and that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b99-5\">The bank records sought by the IRS summons issued to respondent may be necessary to determine all these issues.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b99-6\">His affidavit concluded with a paragraph which we quote in the margin.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b99-7\">The taxpayers submitted no further affidavits. After hearing argument Judge Carter granted the Government\u2019s petition and taxpayers appealed. Meanwhile enforcement has been stayed.</p>\n<p id=\"b99-11\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b99-12\">The question how far a summons issued under I.R.C. \u00a7 7602 is open to attack because of its relation to a criminal prosecution has been much litigated in recent years. Since we hopefully will receive further enlightenment on the subject as a result of the grant of certiorari, 434 U.S. 996, 98 S.Ct. 632, 54 L.Ed.2d 489 (1977), to review <em>United States v. LaSalle National Bank, </em>554 F.2d 302 (7 Cir. 1977), a summary of the doctrinal history will suffice.</p>\n<p id=\"b99-13\">There is nothing on the face of the statute, see note 1 <em>supra, </em>which prevents its utilization in aid of an investigation with a potential for criminal rather than merely civil prosecution of a taxpayer. Indeed, in its latest decision on the subject, the Supreme Court seems to us to have so declared, <em>Donaldson v. United States, </em>400 U.S. 517, 535, 91 S.Ct. 534, 27 L.Ed.2d 580 (1971). Current dubieties have their origin in a dictum in <em>Reisman v. Caplin, </em>375 U.S. 440, 449, 84 S.Ct. 508, 513,11 L.Ed.2d 459 (1964), where, in upholding the denial of injunctive and declaratory relief to a taxpayer\u2019s attorneys in a suit against the Commissioner of Internal Revenue and an accounting firm with respect to reports produced by the latter at the attorneys\u2019 request for use in civil and criminal litigation against the taxpayer, the Court said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b99-14\">Furthermore, we hold that in any of these procedures before either the district judge or United States Commissioner, the witness may challenge the summons on <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"40\">*40</page-number>any appropriate ground. This would include, as the circuits have held, the defenses that the material is sought for the improper purpose of obtaining evidence for use in a criminal prosecution, <em>Boren v. Tucker, </em>9 Cir., 239 F.2d 767, 772-773, as well as that it is protected by the attorney-client privilege, <em>Sale v. United States, </em>8 Cir., 228 F.2d 682.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b100-4\">If <em>Boren v. Tucker </em>constituted the limit of what the Court had in mind, the restriction placed on I.R.C. \u00a7 7602 would not be very great. There the court of appeals, after having propounded the question whether use of the word \u201ccorrectness\u201d in \u00a7 7602 would \u201cprevent examination [of a taxpayer\u2019s records] for purpose[s] of securing evidence for a criminal prosecution?\u201d, answered in the negative. Referring to what the court characterized as the taxpayer\u2019s \u201conly authority on this aspect of his position,\u201d <em>United States v. O\u2019Connor, </em>118 F.Supp. 248, 250 (D.Mass.1953), the opinion correctly characterized Judge Wyzanski\u2019s opinion in that case as holding only that the predecessor to \u00a7 7602 \u201cdid not authorize an agent to issue a subpoena, merely to aid the prosecution of a <em>pending </em>criminal action by the Department of Justice.\u201d <em>Boren v. Tucker, supra, </em>239 F.2d at 772 (emphasis in original).<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b100-5\">The argument for a restrictive reading of \u00a7 7602 was not advanced by <em>United States v. Powell, </em>379 U.S. 48, 58, 85 S.Ct. 248, 255, 13 L.Ed.2d 112 (1964). Although Mr. Justice Harlan declared that a court may not permit its process in enforcing a summons to be abused, his examples of \u201cabuse\u201d were: Such an abuse would take place if the summons had been issued for an improper purpose, such as to harass the taxpayer or to put pressure on him to settle a collateral dispute, or for any other purpose reflecting on the good faith of the particular investigation.</p>\n<p id=\"b100-6\">Nothing was said to indicate that an intention by the Commissioner to uncover criminal tax liability would reflect \u201con the good faith\u201d of the inquiry, and the rule of <em>ejus-dem generis </em>would dictate the contrary.</p>\n<p id=\"b100-8\">This was the background against which the Court decided <em>Donaldson v. United States, supra, </em>400 U.S. 517, 532-36, 91 S.Ct. 534, 27 L.Ed.2d 580, a case which like this involved the enforcement of a third party summons issued by a Special Agent. The Court referred to the dictum in <em>Reisman v. Caplin; </em>to subsequent decisions of courts of appeals approving \u201cthe use of a summons in an investigation that is likely to lead to civil liability as well as to criminal prosecution\u201d or \u201ceven where it is alleged that its purpose is to uncover crime, if no criminal prosecution as yet has been instituted\u201d; and to other decisions holding that \u201cwhere the sole objective of the investigation is to obtain evidence for use in a criminal prosecution, the purpose is not a legitimate one and enforcement may be denied.\u201d After giving as an instance of this \u201cthe case where a criminal prosecution has been instituted and is pending at the time of issuance of the summons,\u201d the Court said, 400 U.S. at 533, 91 S.Ct. at 543:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b100-9\">It is precisely the latter situation\u2014 where the sole object of the investigation is to gather data for criminal prosecution \u2014 that is the subject of the <em>Reisman </em>dictum. This is evident from the fact that the dictum itself embraces the citation of <em>Boren v. Tucker, </em>239 F.2d 767, 772-773 (C.A.9 1956), an opinion in which, at the pages cited, the Ninth Circuit very carefully distinguished <em>United States v. O\u2019Connor, </em>118 F.Supp. 248 (Mass.1953), a case where the taxpayer already was under indictment. The <em>Reisman </em>dictum is to be read in the light of its citation of <em>Boren, </em>and of <em>Boren\u2019s </em>own citation of <em>O\u2019Connor; </em>when so read, the dictum comes into proper focus as applicable to the situation of a pending criminal charge or, at most, of an investigation solely for criminal purposes.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b100-10\">The Court then went on to point out that Donaldson was not under' indictment; that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"41\">*41</page-number>no recommendation had been made for his prosecution; that whether he ever would be prosecuted would depend on the result of the audit; and that, as noted above, there is nothing in \u00a7 7602 restricting \u201cuse of the summons for investigation into criminal conduct.\u201d<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> The opinion concluded, 400 U.S. at 536, 91 S.Ct. at 544:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b101-5\">We hold that under \u00a7 7602 an internal revenue summons may be issued in aid of an investigation if it is issued in good faith and prior to a recommendation for criminal prosecution.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b101-6\">Other courts of appeals have subjected the <em>Donaldson </em>opinion to lengthy textual exegesis reminiscent of scholastic philosophers or Talmudists. The results are summarized in Judge Pell\u2019s opinion for the Seventh Circuit in the <em>LaSalle National Bank </em>case, <em>supra, </em>554 F.2d at 302, now before the Court on certiorari. In particular the two passages quoted have been thought to be in contradiction, or at least to be so unless the words \u201cissued in good faith\u201d in what the Court characterized as its holding are read to encompass investigations for the sole purpose of finding a basis for criminal prosecution rather than what Mr. Justice Harlan seems to have meant when he used those words in <em>Powell. </em>Courts taking this view have held that a warrant issued in an investigation \u201csolely for criminal purposes\u201d is not \u201cissued in good faith\u201d and \u201cis imper-</p>\n<p id=\"b101-12\">missible . . . even though there has been no recommendation for prosecution.\u201d <em>United States v. Zack, </em>521 F.2d 1366, 1368 (9 Cir. 1975). See, e. g., <em>United States v. LaSalle National Bank, supra, </em>554 F.2d at 308-09. The Government, by contrast, argues that a summons is valid as long as criminal prosecution has not been recommended by the IRS to the Department of Justice. Br. at 10.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b101-14\">If there were not good grounds for hope that the Supreme Court itself will soon clear away the underbrush, we would be inclined to reconcile the disparity between the quoted passages, if such there be,<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> on the basis that the stated holding, rather than the passage on 400 U.S. p. 533, 91 S.Ct. 534, was the real holding; that, so far as concerned use of a third party summons for criminal investigations, the Court was laying down an objective test, \u201cprior to a recommendation for criminal prosecution,\u201d that would avoid a need for determining the thought processes of special agents; and that the \u201cgood faith\u201d requirement of the holding related to such wholly different matters as those mentioned in <em>Powell. </em>This seems to us to be the thrust of the opinion when it is read as a whole, particularly the discussion of the broad availability of the summons for criminal investigations, 400 U.S. at 535-36, 91 S.Ct. 534. Such a view would also be consistent with the only ra<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"42\">*42</page-number>tionale that has ever been offered for preventing an otherwise legitimate use of an Internal Revenue Service fhird party summons, namely that Congress could not have intended the statute to trench on the power of the grand jury or to broaden the Government\u2019s right to discovery in a criminal case, see <em>United States v. </em>O\u2019Connor, <em>supra, </em>118 F.Supp. at 250-51. Such considerations are scarcely applicable when no responsible government official has yet made any determination with respect to the propriety of a prosecution.</p>\n<p id=\"b102-4\">However, so far as this case is concerned, we find no necessity for making such a decision for the period until the Court speaks again. Even if we were to subscribe to the reading given <em>Donaldson </em>by <em>LaSalle National Bank </em>and other cases, petitioners made no showing sufficient to call for an evidentiary hearing or discovery on whether the summons was to be used solely to develop evidence for prosecution.</p>\n<p id=\"b102-5\">We start from the premise that investigations of taxpayers that would develop evidence of criminal but not of civil tax liability must be rare; indeed, petitioners have pointed to none. To be sure, a taxpayer can violate I.R.C. \u00a7 7206(1) or the misdemeanor section, \u00a7 7207, by making a wilfully false statement even though no further tax is due. See <em>United States v. Tsanas, </em>2 Cir., 1978, 572 F.2d 340, 342-344. <em>Prima facie, </em>however, when the Audit Division and the Intelligence Division cooperate in an investigation, their interest is in establishing a deficiency which may be the basis for a civil recovery, with or without fraud penalties, a criminal prosecution, or both. Both Special Agent Dombroski and Agent Lazarus swore that this was the case here. Thus, the involvement of the Special Agent in the investigation (as was also the case in <em>Donaldson) </em>in no way detracts from the conclusion that the investigation served both criminal and civil purposes. All that was brought up against this was Wool-ridge\u2019s affidavit that the Special Agent had said to an Arrow employee, unnamed by him but named by Dombroski, that, after getting the additional records from Arrow \u201chis [Dombroski\u2019s] only remaining interest was in his criminal investigation of Roger Keech.\u201d Even assuming that Dombroski had in fact said this, which he denied, it would prove nothing that would justify rejection of the Government\u2019s petition. While under IRS procedures Dombroski\u2019s own interest was in determining whether he should recommend a prosecution, neither the making of such a recommendation nor the failure to make one would lessen the IRS\u2019 appropriate interest in determining whether the taxpayers were liable for deficiencies and penalties. Finally, we find Dombroski\u2019s answer to the taxpayers\u2019 third argument more than sufficient. The IRS is interested in only one year for which the Keeches have been previously audited, and as to that year the taxpayers, pursuant to statute, have been advised of the Service\u2019s need to reexamine their records to redetermine their tax liability. The mere need to reexamine previously audited books provides no evidence that solely criminal prosecution is intended. Even under the broadest reading of <em>Donaldson </em>as to the meaning of the phrase \u201cissued in good faith,\u201d a taxpayer must show something more than was done here in order to be entitled to discovery <footnotemark>9</footnotemark> and an evidentiary hearing.</p>\n<p id=\"b103-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"43\">*43</page-number>The order of the district court is affirmed. The stay of enforcement of the summons is extended for fourteen days from the filing of this opinion and if, within that period, an application for a further stay pending a petition for certiorari is filed with the Supreme Court, until such application is determined.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b97-11\">.

Given the present status of the joint investigation, there are two potential future dispositions. First, Special Agent Dombroski could decide to recommend prosecution, in which event my function would be to submit a Revenue Agent\u2019s Report stating the Audit Division\u2019s computation of any taxes due. This report would end my involvement in the matter at least until disposition of the criminal aspect of the investigation. Second, Special Agent Dombroski could determine that the facts disclosed by the joint investigation did not warrant the recommendation of a criminal prosecution, in which event he would issue a Discontinued Investigation Report. After the issuance of such a report, the matter would be returned to the Audit Division and to me for a determination of whether to recommend an assessment for additional taxes and/or seek civil fraud penalties.

[I]t is drawn so as to permit application of any of the rules in the proceedings whenever the district court deems them helpful.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b103-16\">3 Legislative History of Rules of Civil Procedure 161 (1947 Amendments). The decision of the district court to deny discovery in this case constitutes an exercise of discretion which even the taxpayers\u2019 cases recognize should not be reversed unless discretion was abused. See <em>United States </em>v. <em>Wright Motors Co., </em>536 F.2d at 1093-94. The Supreme Court also recognized in <em>Donaldson, supra, </em>400 U.S. at 528-29, 91 S.Ct. 534, that an application of the Rules which would destroy the summary nature of enforcement proceedings is not required. The specific discovery sought by the Keeches illustrates the drastic impact on IRS\u2019s investigations that the granting of such requests would create. Taxpayers asked that the court \u201corder the IRS agents involved in this investigation to appear for depositions by the taxpayers\u2019 counsel prior to the hearing, with all books, records, reports, memoranda, and other documents relative to the issue of the purpose for the issuance of the summons and the nature of the investigation of the taxpayers.\u201d Intervenors\u2019 Memorandum of Law at 13. Such discovery would seriously delay not only criminal but civil investigation. See <em>United States v. Salter, </em>432 F.2d 697, 700 (1 Cir. 1970). When these policy considerations are coupled with the Supreme Court\u2019s statement in <em>Powell, </em>397 U.S. at 58, 85 S.Ct. at 255, repeated in <em>Donaldson, </em>400 U.S. at 527, 91 S.Ct. [534] at 540 that \u201cthe burden of showing an abuse of the Court\u2019s process is on the taxpayer,\u201d it is thus clear that the taxpayer must make a substantial preliminary showing before even limited discovery need be ordered. Compare <em>United States v. Newman, </em>441 F.2d 165, 169 (5 Cir. 1971) (\u201c. . . the summoned party must raise in a substantial way the existence of substantial deficiencies in the summons proceedings. Only when so raised, is there any need for an evidentiary hearing or\u2014 in anticipation of it \u2014 the traditional discovery mechanisms with appropriate limitations.\u201d), with <em>United States v. Wright Motors, supra, </em>536 F.2d at 1094.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
