The compound itself has the following structural formula:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b373-12\">[[Image here]]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b373-13\">The sole reference relied upon by the examiner and the board as evidence of the unpatentability of appellant\u2019s claims is patent No. 2,344,356, issued to G. Hildebrandt on March 14, 1944. Hildebrandt discloses a class of \u00df-(meta-hydroxyphenyl)-isopropylamines<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> of the general formula:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b373-16\">[[Image here]]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b373-17\">wherein \u201cR designates hydrogen, an alkyl radical, for example methyl, ethyl, propyl, isopropyl, butyl, isobutyl, isoamyl, etc. or a cycloalkyl radical, for example cyclohexyl, ortho-, meta- or para-methylcyclohexyl, tet-rahydronaphthyl, decahydronaphthyl etc.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b373-18\">With respect to utility, Hildebrandt\u2019s specification states that \u00df -(meta-hydroxyphenyl)-isopropylamines in general possess \u201cfavorable therapeutic properties\u201d similar to \u00df -(parahydroxyphenyl)-isopropylemethylamine,<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> which is described as physiologically active, exerting effects similar to those of ephedrine.\u201d<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b373-19\">The only compound falling within the above general formula that is exemplified by Hildebrandt is \u00df-(meta-hydroxyphenyl)isopropylmethylamine, which happens to be the lower adjacent homologue of HEP. Hildebrandt\u2019s specification teaches how to make \u00df -(meta-hydroxyphenyl)-isopropylmethylamine as the free base, or as the hydrochloride salt thereof, and it also states that other \u00df -(meta-hydr oxyphenyl)-isopropylamines may be made by the same method. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"314\">*314</page-number>Claim 1 of the Hildebrandt patent reads:</p>\n<p id=\"AW2\">The chemical compounds \u00df-(meta-hydroxyphenyl)-isopropylamines of the formula</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b374-4\">[[Image here]]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b374-6\">wherein R is a lower alkyl radical.</p>\n<p id=\"b374-7\">We note in passing that appellants\u2019 application mentions the Hildebrandt patent in a discussion of the prior art, and points out that <footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<blockquote id=\"b374-8\">Our investigations of [prior art compounds, including the lower adjacent homologue of HEP] have shown that, in addition to the desired increase of the blood pressure in the peripheral circulation, a considerable increase of the blood pressure in the pulmonary circulation also occurs as a clinically uncontrollable side effect or, at the same time, causes brady-cardia.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b374-9\">According to appellants, such undesirable side effects are negligible when HEP is administered.</p>\n<p id=\"b374-10\">\n<em>Proceedings Below</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b374-11\">Claims 2, 3, and 4 stand rejected under 35 U.S.C. \u00a7 102(b), the examiner\u2019s contention being that Hildebrandt\u2019s description of a limited class of compounds encompassing HEP is sufficient under the statute to \u201cfully anticipate the claims in the instant [application] under the doctrine set forth in <em>In re Petering, </em>[49 CCPA 993, 301 F.2d 676,] 133 USPQ 275 [1962].\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b374-12\">In response to appellants\u2019 primary argument that the general formula of Hilde-brandt\u2019s specification cannot constitute an anticipation of every one of the one hundred and five or more compounds encompassed thereby, the examiner noted that the method disclosed by Hildebrandt for producing (3 -(meta-hydroxyphenyl)-isopropyla-mines would result only in the production of secondary amines,<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> thus limiting to fourteen the number of possible compounds taught by the reference. That number is further reduced to seven, said the examiner, if one considers the preference for lower alkyl secondary amines expressed in claim 1 of the reference.</p>\n<p id=\"b374-15\">With respect to the affidavit of appellant Roesch, submitted under 37 CFR 1.132 to substantiate the alleged superiority (i. e., greater effectiveness in increasing peripheral blood pressure without aforementioned side effects) of HEP as compared with the lower homologue of Hildebrandt, the examiner stated that \u201ca showing over the adjacent homolog is not sufficient to overcome the teachings of the prior art * * *.\"</p>\n<p id=\"b374-16\">A majority of the board affirmed the 35 U.S.C. \u00a7 102(b) rejection, noting that the structural formula of Hildebrandt\u2019s claim 1 contains but a single variable, R, defined as \u201ca lower alkyl radical,\u201d and that the expression \u201calkyl radical,\u201d as set forth in the specification, includes, inter alia, ethyl.</p>\n<p id=\"b374-17\">The dissenting board member, however, voiced the following opinion:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b374-18\">It is axiomatic to me that for a rejection to properly lie under 35 USC 102 a disclosure which <em>identically </em>describes the claimed invention must exist. Such is clearly now the view of the CCPA, as noted [in ?] <em>In re Arkley et a1, </em>59 CCPA 804, 455 F.2d 586, 172 USPQ 524 [1972] * * *. By having to select an ethyl radical from among the many possibilities which R in the structural formula given by Hildebrandt may be, in my view, does not give rise to the claimed compound being fully anticipated by the reference. The question is, as is emphasized by the Court [sic] even in the earlier case of <em>In re Ruschig et al, </em>54 CCPA 1551, 379 F.2d 990, 154 USPQ 118 [1967], is the claimed compound <em>described </em>in the reference, that is does its specification convey clearly to one skilled in the art the information <em>that </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"315\">*315</page-number><em>patentee invented that specific compound. </em>* * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b375-5\">If the view of the majority were to prevail it must be said that patentee also invented l-(3-hydroxyphenyl)-2-propy-laminopropane * * *, as well as l-(3hydroxyphenyl)-2-isoamylamine [sic] and could have claimed these specific compounds. Such a conclusion, on its face, must manifestly be held as being contrary to existing law. [Emphasis in original.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b375-7\">OPINION</p>\n<p id=\"b375-8\">As stated by the board, the issue herein is \u201cwhether the total disclosure of tne reference identifies the claimed ethylamine compound with sufficient specificity to constitute a description thereof within the purview of 35 USC 102(b).\u201d However, a more fundamental question presented by this appeal is whether the disclosure of a chemical genus may ever constitute a description of a specific compound falling within the ambit of the genus.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b375-9\">In essence, appellants are questioning the continued precedential value of <em>In re Petering, </em>301 F.2d 676, 49 CCPA 993, 133 USPQ 275 (1962), wherein this court affirmed the rejection of a claim to a specific compound, 6. 7-dimethyl-9-[\u00df -monohydroxyethyl]-isoalloxazine, not simply on the basis of the generic disclosure of isoalloxazine derivatives contained in the Karrer reference,<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> but because</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b375-11\">the pattern of Karrer\u2019s specific preferences [for the six variable substituents on the generic formula; see n, 8, supra] in-connection with his generic formula constitutes a description of a definite and limited class of compounds which may be defined with reference to the Karrer generic formula as follows: where X, P and R' are hydrogen, where Y and Z may be hydrogen or methyl, and where R is a member selected from the group consisting of-CH2OH, -CH2CH(OH)CH2OH, -CH2 CH2OH, -CH2(CHOH)3CH2OH and -CH2 (CHOH)4CH2OH. [Footnote omitted.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b375-16\">Id., 301 F.2d at 681, 49 CCPA at 1000, 133 USPQ at 279-80.</p>\n<p id=\"b375-17\">Since the \u201cpattern of preferences\u201d permitted only two alternatives for Y and Z, a limited number of variations for R, no alternatives for the other ring positions, and a large unchanging structural nucleus, it was held that Karrer described to one skilled in the art a limited class of some 20 compounds, including 6, 7-dimethyl-9-[\u00df-monohydroxyethyl]-isoalloxazine, \u201cas fully as if he had drawn each structural formula or had written each name.\u201d Id., 301 F.2d at 682, 49 CCPA at 1000, 133 USPQ at 280.</p>\n<p id=\"b375-18\">Appellants primarily rely on <em>In re Ruschig, </em>343 F.2d 965, 52 CCPA 1238, 145 USPQ 274 (1965), to support their contention that <em>In re Petering, </em>supra, has been \u201cvitiated.\u201d In <em>Ruschig, </em>two generic claims defining limited classes of benzenesulfonylureas were denied patentability on the basis of the broader generic disclosures of three references a U.S. patent to Martin et al., a French, and a Swedish patent,<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> which were alleged to have anticipated the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"316\">*316</page-number>claimed subject matter. In reversing the rejection, this court said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b376-4\">We did not intend our <em>Petering </em>opinion or decision to become a precedent for the mechanistic dissection and recombination of the components of the specific illustrative compounds in every chemical reference containing them to create hindsight anticipations with the guidance of an applicant\u2019s disclosures, on the theory that such reconstructed disclosures <em>describe </em>specific compounds within the meaning of section 102. Furthermore, we do not find the present case to be of the type we had before us in <em>Petering. </em>Even if we take the 10 examples of the French or the 12 examples of the Swedish reference, take them apart and recombine them into different compounds than those named, we do not get a small recognizable class with common properties. We would apparently get from the French patent some 130 and from the Swedish some 156 compounds. And in doing this we are not dealing with such closely related units as the H and CH2 and the five hydroxyalkyl components in <em>Petering </em>but with such widely differing R1 choices as p-acylaminobenzene, diphenyl, \u00df-naphthalene and dimethylbenzene, to name a few from the <em>thirteen </em>possible choices. And for the R3 choices there are such diverse radicals as ethyl, dodecyl, benzyl, and 6-naphthyl. We will not apply the <em>Petering </em>type of analysis to such a situation. * * * We hold similar views as to the board\u2019s indication that a specific <em>description </em>of compounds within claims 1 and 2 can be made out of the Martin disclosure. To do this the board selects p-chloro- and p-fro-mo- for R (as used in appellants\u2019 claim 2, supra) and ethyl or isoamyl for R2 to create, ex post facto, four undisclosed specific compounds out of a possible 259, according to appellants\u2019 apparently valid calculations. This is not the kind of <em>description </em>we found in <em>Petering </em>and we do not find here any \u201canticipation\u201d by the Martin patent of claims 1 and 2. [Emphasis in original.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b376-7\">Id., 343 F.2d at 974-75, 52 CCPA at 1250-51, 145 USPQ at 282.</p>\n<p id=\"b376-8\">We do not share appellants\u2019 view that <em>In re Ruschig, </em>supra, signaled this court\u2019s abandonment of the <em>ratio decidendi </em>of <em>In re Petering, </em>supra. That view certainly finds no express support in the language of the <em>Ruschig </em>opinion. Nor is it supported therein by implication, for the two cases are clearly distinguishable, as Judge Rich, speaking for the court in <em>Ruschig, </em>convincingly demonstrated. In any event, we believe the circumstances in the present case provide a far stronger foundation on which to support a finding of anticipation than did the circumstances in <em>Petering.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b376-9\">In order to find anticipation in <em>Petering, </em>it was necessary to derive a class of compounds of lesser scope than the genus actually disclosed in the reference on the basis of preferences ascertainable from the remainder of the disclosure, which included eight specific examples of isoalloxazine derivatives. In the present case, by contrast, Hildebrandt\u2019s preference for lower alkyl secondary amines is expressly set forth in claim 1. In addition, the properties possessed by the specific compounds claimed in <em>Petering </em>were diametrically opposite to the properties of the compounds disclosed in the prior art of record, whereas here the blood pressure lowering effect of HEP is also shared by the class of compounds disclosed by Hildebrandt.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b376-10\">When we consider also that claim 1 of the Hildebrandt patent, read in conjunction with the signification given the expression \u201calkyl radical\u201d in the specification, embraces a very limited number of compounds closely related to one another in structure, we are led inevitably to the conclusion that the reference provides a description of those compounds just as surely as if they <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"317\">*317</page-number>were identified in the reference by name. Since one of the compounds thus described is HEP, we agree with the examiner and the majority of the board that appellants\u2019 right to a patent thereon is barred under 35 U.S.C. \u00a7 102(b).</p>\n<p id=\"b377-5\">Presumably influenced by the views of the dissenting board member, appellants assert that <em>In re Arkley, </em>455 F.2d 586, 59 CCPA 804, 172 USPQ 524 (1972) \u201calso supports reversal herein.\u201d It is appellants\u2019 contention that the PTO\u2019s reliance on \u201cisolated passages of the reference,\u201d namely, claim 1<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> and the signification given the expression \u201calkyl radical\u201d in the specification, constitutes the sort of \u201cpicking and choosing\u201d which this court held improper in <em>Arkley.</em><footnotemark><em>12</em></footnotemark><em> </em>We disagree. The examiner and the board properly interpreted claim 1 of Hildebrandt in light of the specification. Indeed, they had no alternative since claim 1 itself does not define the expression \u201clower alkyl radical\u201d recited therein.</p>\n<p id=\"b377-6\"><em>In re Arkley, </em>supra, should not be interpreted as establishing a new test for determining whether an invention has been described in a reference within the meaning of 35 U.S.C. \u00a7 102. See Judge Baldwin\u2019s concurring opinion, id., 455 F.2d at 590, 59 CCPA at 810, 172 USPQ at 528. It was not this court\u2019s intention in <em>Arkley </em>to effect a change in the accepted definition of \u201canticipation,\u201d a term of art meaning \u201cthe disclosure in the prior art of a thing <em>substantially identical </em>with the claimed invention.\u201d [Emphasis added.] 1 A. Deller, Deller\u2019s Walker on Patents \u00a7 57 at 237 (2d ed. 1964). Thus, although appellants would have us hold that Hildebrandt fails as an anticipation because it does not contain a description of the subject matter of the appealed claims, <em>ipsissimis verbis, </em>we cannot countenance a result which so obviously exhalts form over substance.</p>\n<p id=\"b377-11\">Finally, appellants assert, as did the dissent below, that Hildebrandt could not have claimed the specific compound HEP and, therefore, has not described it. This argument incorrectly focuses on Hildebrandt\u2019s specification alone, rather than on the reference in its entirety. The record before us rather clearly evinces the PTO\u2019s reliance on Hildebrandt\u2019s claim 1, which sets forth the substance of the invention here in controversy. No more is required of a reference under the statute. Thus, whether Hildebrandt, for any number of reasons, would have been precluded from claiming HEP, per se, as of his filing date is irrelevant.</p>\n<p id=\"b377-12\">The record shows that claims 2-4 were treated by the PTO and appellants as standing or falling together. We have treated them accordingly here. <em>In re Tomanek, </em>376 F.2d 325, 54 CCPA 1509, 153 USPQ 451 (1967).</p>\n<p id=\"b377-13\">\n<em>AFFIRMED.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b373-14\">.

The difference between appellants\u2019 nomenclature and that of the reference is accounted for by the fact that appellants refer to their compound as a propane derivative and use Arabic numerals to denote substituent positions, whereas the compounds encompassed within the reference formula are termed amine derivatives, and Greek is used to specify substituent positions. It is undisputed that when one R in Hildebrandt\u2019s general formula designates hydrogen and the other R designates an ethyl radical, the resultant compound is HEP.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b373-22\">.

In both cases R1R2, and R3 may designate either identical or different hydrocarbon radicals or substituted hydrocarbon radicals. Thus, the general formula of Hildebrandt\u2019s specification represents secondary as well as tertiary amines, whereas Hildebrandt\u2019s claim 1 defines secondary amines only.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b375-12\">. ' In their reply brief before the board, appellants asserted that \u201ca <em>specific </em>compound is not fully met by a generic disclosure whether the genus embraces <em>2 </em>or <em>200 </em>compounds, not even if the genus embraces <em>14 </em>compounds.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b375-13\">.

In this respect the present case is also distinguishable from <em>In re Kalm, </em>378 F.2d 959, 54 CCPA 1466, 154 USPQ 10 (1967), wherein the CNS depressant activity of the compounds claimed by appellant was not merely complementary or in addition to properties possessed by the compounds of the Siemer reference, but differed <em>toto c\u00e1elo </em>therefrom.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"11\">\n<p id=\"b377-7\">. Appellants\u2019 argument that those skilled in the art look to the patent specification rather than the claims to apprise themselves of its teachings borders on the frivolous. The principle is well established that the claims of a patent cited as a reference are part of the disclosure of that reference and may properly be considered in determining the question of anticipation. <em>In re Field, </em>161 F.2d 372, 34 CCPA 1066, 73 USPQ 485 (1947).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"12\">\n<p id=\"b377-8\">.
