He was sentenced to 10 years\u2019 imprisonment plus a special parole term of 10 years. From this sentence Ramos appeals. The facts, obtained from the sentencing minutes of May 19, 1977, relating to the imposition of this sentence must be reviewed.</p>\n<p id=\"b420-25\">Prior to sentencing, Ramos, at the time of his guilty plea, had been advised by the Court that he was entitled to remain silent; that the maximum sentence is 15 years plus a $25,000 fine and a minimum special parole term of 3 years.</p>\n<p id=\"b420-26\">Ramos, then 22 years of age, was told by the Court that he might be entitled to treatment under the Youth Correction Act but that \u201cit is entirely in my discretion and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"361\">*361</page-number>I do not have to give reasons for not giving you that treatment\u201d. The Court suggested \u201cif you wish it\u201d Ramos should discuss it with his Probation Officer and that he (the Court) would take it into consideration if Ramos so desired. The advantages and disadvantages of such treatment were outlined. However, neither Ramos nor his counsel seem to have pursued the possibilities of this alternative.</p>\n<p id=\"b421-5\">On the day of sentencing, Ramos\u2019 counsel referred to the probation report, which so far as a prior criminal record is concerned, referred only to a traffic violation (conditionally discharged) and to letters from Ramos\u2019 family. He noted that Ramos was the support of his semi-invalid mother and sisters and then asked for leniency.</p>\n<p id=\"b421-6\">The probation report showed that Ramos had traveled to Chicago with some $14,000 supplied by an individual whose name Ramos gave to narcotics agents and who, as a result, was subsequently indicted. Ramos\u2019 participation was described \u201cas a \u2018mule\u2019 to transport heroin between Chicago and New York\u201d. For this service Ramos, in need of money, was to receive ISOO.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Upon his arrest at the time of attempting delivery, Ramos made statements implicating the other individual but as stated in the report \u201che subsequently refused to testify and is considered to be generally uncooperative\u201d. A \u201cperiod of incarceration\u201d was recommended, although his involvement in criminal activities was recent and he had no prior record except the traffic violation.</p>\n<p id=\"b421-7\">Counsel for Ramos told the Court that Ramos feared the consequences to his family if he testified at the trial of the individual for whom he was acting in transporting the heroin. Thereafter, in' colloquy in which Ramos\u2019 counsel, the Assistant United States Attorney and the Court participated, it became obvious that the Court placed great stress upon Ramos\u2019 cooperation with the Government by testifying. The Court said \"[i]f he is anxious to show his cooperation with the Government, his time is now to say to the Government \u2018I\u2019m willing to assist you in the trial\u2019.\u201d (32-A). Counsel for Ramos even \u201cadvised him that possibly a more heavier [sic] sentence could possibly result\u201d. (34-A). The Court, after stating that he had read the probation report [which contained references to Ramos\u2019 refusal to testify] and that he had considered Ramos\u2019 indictment waiver and guilty plea, referred to counsel\u2019s \u201cstatements with respect to his [Ramos\u2019] cooperation [which] are not very helpful to the Court\u201d and thereupon sentenced Ramos to 10 years\u2019 imprisonment plus a special parole term of 10 years.</p>\n<p id=\"b421-11\">This court cannot be unmindful of the fact that Ramos, on this record, appears to have been only a transporter <em>[i. </em>e., a \u201cmule\u201d] of the heroin, that he had given the name of the individual for whom he was acting, that his testimony had not been shown to be vital to the successful prosecution of that individual, that he was 23 years of age at the time of sentencing, and that he was not a user or distributor [in the sense of being a \u201cmiddleman\u201d] of narcotics.</p>\n<p id=\"b421-12\">In our task of reviewing countless appeals of narcotics convictions we have had to become aware of sentences meted out to convicted traffickers in narcotics. Although we are mindful of an appellate policy of giving the broadest discretion to the sentencing judge, we have read the sentencing minutes and the probation report and are more than somewhat in doubt that the length of the sentence was not influenced by Ramos\u2019 refusal to testify for [cooperate with] the Government. This doubt is created because the judge gave no reasons for selecting the particular sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b421-13\">The Proposed Rules on Sentencing of the Judicial Council of the Second Circuit (March 17, 1976) provide in section III(C):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AfJ\">\u201cWhen sentence is imposed, the court should:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b421-14\">(3) State for the record, in the presence of the defendant, the reasons for the particular sentence imposed and for rejecting available sentencing alternatives; . . . \u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b422-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"362\">*362</page-number>Likewise, the American Bar Association Standards Relating to Sentencing Alternatives and Procedures (Approved Draft, 1968) state that the court:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b422-4\">\u201c(ii) normally should state for the record in the presence of the defendant the reasons for selecting the particular sentence to be imposed. . . . \u201d \u00a7 5.6(ii).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b422-5\">The Third Circuit was faced with a not too dissimilar situation in <em>United States v. Garcia, </em>544 F.2d 681 (1976). Although Fifth Amendment rights, are not here involved (the question does not arise here because the stated reason for Ramos\u2019 failure to testify is fear of harm to his family), nevertheless the sentencing problem was before the <em>Garcia </em>court, which said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b422-6\">\u201cThe appellants were put to a Hobson\u2019s choice: remain silent and lose the opportunity to be the objects of leniency, or speak and run the risk of additional prosecution [here violence to his immediate family]. A price tag was thus placed on appellants\u2019 expectation of maximum consideration at the bar of justice: they had to waive the protection afforded them by the Fifth Amendment. This price was too high. We, therefore, cannot permit the sentences to stand.\u201d (footnote omitted). 544 F.2d 681, at 685.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b422-7\">We believe, since no \u201creasons for selecting the particular sentence to be imposed\u201d were stated by the Court, that Ramos\u2019 refusal to testify may have been an important factor in the sentence. The present sentence should be vacated and Ramos should be re-sentenced after hearings conducted before another judge.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b421-8\">. Ramos told the Probation Officer \u201cthat his family was in poor financial condition and he became involved in the offense \u2018out of desperation\u2019.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"concurrence\">\n<author id=\"b422-8\">FEINBERG, Circuit Judge</author>\n<p id=\"AFB\">(concurring in the result):</p>\n<p id=\"b422-9\">I agree with Judge Moore that the trial judge should have stated the reasons for his harsh sentence. See, in addition to the authorities cited by Judge Moore, ABA Project on Standards for Criminal Justice, Standards Relating to Appellate Review of Sentences \u00a7 2.3(c) (Approved Draft, 1968). Even before the recommendation of the Judicial Council in March 1976, we had emphasized the desirability of a statement of reasons by the sentencing judge, although we had not required it. See <em>United States </em>v. <em>Driscoll, </em>496 F.2d 252 (2d Cir. 1974); <em>United States v. Velazquez, </em>482 F.2d 139 (2d Cir. 1973); <em>United States v. Brown, </em>479 F.2d 1170 (2d Cir. 1973). In addition, we had held that even in the absence of an absolute requirement that reasons ordinarily be stated, particular circumstances might demand it. See <em>McGee v. United States, </em>462 F.2d 243, 247 (2d Cir. 1972). Accordingly, I concur in the result.</p>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-3\" type=\"concurrence\">\n<author id=\"b422-11\">LUMBARD, Circuit Judge</author>\n<p id=\"ATo\">(concurring):</p>\n<p id=\"b422-12\">Although I agree with my colleagues that the appellant\u2019s sentence should be vacated, I think something more must be said about why such an unusually severe sentence, imposed for the wrong reasons, can not be permitted to stand.</p>\n<p id=\"b422-13\">Ismael Ramos was apprehended by the police in January, 1977 and charged with possession of heroin. Following his arrest, he first cooperated with authorities in implicating Juan Balaguer as the principal in the sale of heroin for which Ramos was the messenger. Subsequently, however, he refused to testify against Balaguer at the latter\u2019s trial, citing his fear of reprisals against his family. The government made no attempt to have Ramos give his testimony under a grant of immunity.</p>\n<p id=\"b422-14\">On March 18, 1977, having waived indictment, Ramos pled guilty in the Eastern District to a one count information charging him with possession of 17 ounces of heroin with intent to distribute, in violation of 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 841(a)(1) (1970). He came before Judge Platt on May 19 for sentencing.</p>\n<p id=\"b422-15\">The presentence report shows that Ramos is a 23 year old with strong family ties and no prior criminal record, save one traffic violation. Further, the report expresses the opinion that the defendant only recently became involved in criminal activities and that his offense is largely attributable to his concern for the well-being of his siblings and chronically ill mother. At sentencing, Judge Platt engaged counsel for Ramos and the Assistant United States Attorney in a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"363\">*363</page-number>lengthy colloquy centering upon the defendant\u2019s refusal to cooperate with the United States Attorney\u2019s office concerning the prosecution of Balaguer \u2014 that is, his refusal to testify against his former confederate.</p>\n<p id=\"b423-5\">At one point during this discussion, Judge Platt offered to adjourn the proceeding to allow the attorney for the government one more try at persuading Ramos to change his mind. Ramos refused, however, and the court imposed a sentence of ten years\u2019 imprisonment to be followed by ten years\u2019 special parole. The statutory maximum is fifteen years\u2019 imprisonment. Contrary to Judge Moore\u2019s suggestion, I believe that the minutes of the sentencing hearing make abundantly clear Judge Platt\u2019s \u201creasons for selecting the particular sentence to be imposed\u201d: By imposing an unusually severe sentence he sought to pressure Ramos to give testimony against Balaguer and, failing that, to punish Ramos for his refusal. To impose such a sentence of <em>in terrorem </em>proportions is not only an abuse of the court\u2019s powers, it is also an interference with the efficient and speedy administration of criminal justice.</p>\n<p id=\"b423-6\">As the record stands, Ramos committed no offense in refusing to testify against Balaguer. But he speeded the disposition of the court\u2019s business by pleading guilty and thus making it unnecessary to have a trial of the charges. If, in addition, the government needed Ramos\u2019 testimony against Balaguer, it could have granted him immunity from further prosecution in connection with the heroin transaction and compelled his testimony.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Upon Ramos\u2019 continued refusal to cooperate, he then would have been subject to possible punishment for contempt of court. The government did not choose to pursue this course, however. On this record, therefore, there was no justification for the court\u2019s imposing so severe a sentence, in large part for refusing to testify for the government.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b423-10\">The effect on the administration of criminal justice of such an excessive sentence following a plea of guilty presents an additional reason for vacating Ramos\u2019 sentence. Had Ramos stood mute and insisted on his right to be tried, instead of pleading guilty, he would have been no worse off upon conviction. Indeed, from our knowledge of dispositions in such cases, he would undoubtedly have been much better off, as a ten year sentence, with ten year special parole to follow, is unheard of in eases such as Ramos\u2019. It follows that if Ramos\u2019 ten year sentence after a plea were permitted to stand, no one would plead guilty before Judge Platt or any judge who employed similar tactics to encourage cooperation with the government. Thus, many defendants, apprehensive about sentences on pleas of guilty, would choose to stand trial. Such a trend would lead to the trial of more criminal cases and would seriously threaten the ability of the district courts to try many of their criminal cases within the time limits required by the Speedy Trial Act of 1974.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b423-7\">. 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 6001, et seq. (1970).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b423-8\">. Our decisions in <em>United States v. Sweig, </em>454 F.2d 181 (2d Cir. 1972), and <em>United States v. Vermeulen, </em>436 F.2d 72 (2d Cir. 1970), cert. denied, 402 U.S. 911, 91 S.Ct. 1390, 28 L.Ed.2d 653 (1971), are not in point. In each of these cases we ruled only that the sentencing judge, in his discretion, may take into account as a mitigating factor the defendant\u2019s voluntary cooperation with the authorities. Nowhere have we suggested that the defendant\u2019s refusal to cooperate may be considered in increasing the sentence he would otherwise receive. It is one thing to extend leniency to a defendant who is willing to cooperate with the government; it is quite another thing to administer additional punishment to a defendant who by his silence has committed no additional offense.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b423-14\">. 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3161, et seq. (1975).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-4\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b423-11\">TIMBERS, Circuit Judge,</author>\n<p id=\"ax-dedup-0\">dissenting from denial of rehearing en banc:<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b423-12\">Less than a year ago, in <em>United States </em>v. <em>Robin, </em>553 F.2d 8 (2 Cir. 1977), the nine <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"364\">*364</page-number>active judges of this Court unanimously agreed upon certain guidelines to be considered \u201cin deciding whether to remand for retrial or resentencing before a different judge and to assure that no personal criticism of the original judge is involved.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 11.</p>\n<p id=\"b424-4\">Our unanimous decision in <em>Robin, </em>referred to above, emerged from en banc proceedings which in turn followed a 2-1 panel decision in which I dissented, 545 F.2d at 782-84, inter alia, on the ground that the majority\u2019s asserted reason for vacating the sentence \u2014 namely, that the defense had not been given sufficient time to examine the presentence report \u2014 surely would not impair the ability of <em>that judge </em>to reimpose sentence on remand. Judge Motley was the original sentencing judge in <em>Robin. </em>I dissented from Judge Moore\u2019s direction for the panel majority that \u201cresentencing will be before a different judge.\u201d 545 F.2d at 782. And while I was one of the nine active judges who later unanimously agreed upon the guidelines for remanding to a different judge for retrial or resentencing, 553 F.2d 8, I also was one of the three active judges who thought that those guidelines did not warrant assignment of the case to a judge other than Judge Motley for resentencing:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"Aq5\">\u201cJudges Oakes, Timbers and Meskill, while concurring in the foregoing principles, believe that their application to the facts of this case does not warrant assignment of the case to a different judge for resentencing upon remand.\u201d 553 F.2d at 11.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b424-5\">Now less than a year later, Judge Moore\u2019s panel majority opinion in the instant <em>Ramos </em>case, concurred in by Judge Feinberg, concludes that \u201csince no \u2018reasons for selecting the particular sentence to be imposed\u2019 were stated by the Court .... [t]he present sentence should be vacated <em>and Ramos should be re-sentenced after hearings conducted before another judge.\u201d </em>572 F.2d 362 (emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b424-6\">It strikes me as elemental that, <em>if </em>the true reason for vacating this sentence is that the sentencing judge erred in failing to give reasons for his sentence, then he should be given the opportunity to explain why he did what he did, by remanding the case to him for re-sentencing. To cut off this opportunity is demeaning to the trial judge \u2014 precisely one of the things we sought to guard against in our en banc opinion in <em>Robin : </em>\u201cto assure that no personal criticism of the original judge is involved.\u201d 553 F.2d at 11.</p>\n<p id=\"b424-8\">Significantly the panel opinions in the instant <em>Ramos </em>case are eloquently silent with respect to the unanimous <em>Robin </em>guidelines for remanding for resentencing by a different judge. I suggest that the reason for this is that, by the very nature of the case and the reasons for vacating the sentence, there could be no rational justification for not remanding to Judge Platt for resentencing.</p>\n<p id=\"b424-9\">For these reasons I respectfully dissent from the denial of rehearing en banc.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b423-15\">. The instant en banc proceedings took place prior to the filing of the panel opinions. The one active judge on the panel, prior to filing the panel opinions, circulated them to all of the other active judges so as to afford an opportunity for en banc consideration if any active judge desired it. An en banc poll was requested, with the result indicated in the order to which this dissenting opinion is appended.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
