She had sought this relief in a motion under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255 on the ground that the district court had failed to comply with Rule 11(c)(5) when it accepted her plea. Specifically, we held, on the authority of <em>United States v. Boone, </em>543 F.2d 1090 (4 Cir. 1976), that because she was not told, when she tendered her plea, that if she pleaded guilty she might be asked questions, and if she answered under oath, on the record and in the presence of counsel, her answers might later be used against her in a prosecution for perjury or false statement, her sentence must be vacated.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1068-16\">On petition for rehearing and after considering the government\u2019s petition and brief in support thereof and the prisoner\u2019s response and brief, we conclude to grant rehearing, withdraw our prior opinion and affirm the district court\u2019s denial of White\u2019s \u00a7 2255 motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b1068-17\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b1068-18\">White sought relief under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255. Unlike the facts in <em>Boone, </em>she did <em>not </em>appeal from the sentence imposed upon her conviction. Before her guilty plea was accepted, she was not given the specific admonition required by Rule 11(c)(5).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Although White was interrogated by the district court as part of an extended colloquy to establish the voluntariness of her plea, she was <em>not </em>sworn and interrogated under oath.</p>\n<p id=\"b1069-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1009\">*1009</page-number>While our original opinion proceeded on the assumption that a district court\u2019s failure to comply with Rule 11 would give rise to the same relief on collateral attack as on direct appeal, we are now persuaded to the contrary. Along with the Second, Fifth, Eighth and Tenth Circuits,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> we agree that <em>Davis </em>v. <em>United States, </em>417 U.S. 333, 346, 94 S.Ct. 2298, 2305, 41 L.Ed.2d 109 (1974) (quoting from <em>Hill </em>v. <em>United States, </em>368 U.S. 424, 429, 82 S.Ct. 468, 7 L.Ed.2d 417 (1962)), establishes that \u201c \u2018collateral relief is not available when all that is shown is a failure to comply with the formal requirements\u2019 of a rule of criminal procedure in the absence of any indication that the defendant was prejudiced by the asserted technical error.\u201d Absent a mistake of constitutional or jurisdictional dimensions, \u201cthe appropriate inquiry [under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255] was whether the claimed error of law was \u2018a fundamental defect which inherently results in a complete miscarriage of justice\u2019 ...\u201d 417 U.S. at 346, 94 S.Ct. at 2305 (quoting from 368 U.S. at 428, 82 S.Ct. 468). Accordingly, our inquiry here is not simply whether Rule 11(c)(5) was observed; the record establishes that it was not. Rather, our inquiry is whether White suffered prejudice of constitutional magnitude as a result of non-observance of the rule.</p>\n<p id=\"b1069-5\">We hold that she did not. It would be difficult enough to posit a case in which a defendant who otherwise concluded to plead guilty would be encouraged or discouraged to tender his plea by lack of knowledge that he may be interrogated under oath under penalty of perjury by the district court. Such knowledge, or the lack thereof, simply does not go to the voluntariness of the plea.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> But White\u2019s case is even stronger because she was <em>not </em>interrogated under oath by the district court. Even less could the voluntariness of her plea be adversely affected by knowledge of what might, but did not, happen. We therefore conclude that White is not entitled to relief under \u00a7 2255 as a result of the district court\u2019s failure to comply with Rule 11(c)(5).</p>\n<p id=\"b1069-10\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b1069-11\">In our previous opinion, we found no need to consider White\u2019s other grounds for relief under \u00a7 2255. In view of our present holding concerning the non-observance of Rule 11(c)(5), we address them now.</p>\n<p id=\"b1069-12\">Our reading of the record persuades us that White was sufficiently advised of her right to confront and cross-examine witnesses to comply with Rule 11(c)(3). <em>See United States v. Ready, </em>460 F.2d 1238 (4 Cir. 1972). We think also that the record reflects both the factual basis for the plea and that White understood the nature of the charge. <em>Cf. Henderson v. Morgan, </em>426 U.S. 637, 96 S.Ct. 2253, 49 L.Ed.2d 108 (1976). Finally, the mere fact that the sentence imposed upon White\u2014 four years with parole eligibility after fif<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1010\">*1010</page-number>teen months \u2014 exceeded that estimated by her attorney does not render her plea involuntary. There is no claim that there was an undisclosed and unfulfilled plea bargain for a lesser sentence, <em>Blackledge </em>v. <em>Allison, </em>431 U.S. 63, 97 S.Ct. 1621, 52 L.Ed.2d 136 (1977); or that her attorney gave her any assurances of a lesser sentence, <em>Wellnitz v. Page, </em>420 F.2d 935 (10 Cir. 1970).</p>\n<p id=\"b1070-4\">\n<em>AFFIRMED.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1068-13\">. The government calls to our attention the unpublished opinion of another panel of this court in <em>United States v. DeRose, </em>559 F.2d 1213 (4 Cir. 1977), holding, <em>inter alia, </em>that, in a direct appeal, the district court\u2019s failure to comply with Rule 11(c)(5) was harmless error \u201cbecause the defendant had made a plea bargain and had the assistance of retained counsel.\u201d It is beyond the scope of this appeal to determine if <em>Boone </em>and <em>DeRose </em>are in conflict and, if so, how the conflict should be resolved. For the district courts within the circuit and the practicing bar, however, we call attention to our Local Rule 18 relating to publication of opinions. It suggests that Boone, as a published opinion, is entitled to greater precedential value than <em>DeRose </em>which was unpublished, should any question arise as to which controls.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b1068-20\">. In pertinent part, Rule 11 provides:</p>\n<p id=\"b1068-21\">(c) Advice to Defendant.

In 1974, the Supreme Court, pursuant to 18 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 3771-72, transmitted to Congress a series of proposed amendments to the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure. Under these proposed amendments Rule 11(c) was expanded to include the specific types of information a district court must convey to a defendant in order to insure the voluntariness of his subsequent plea. As finally enacted, subsections (l)-(4) of Rule 11(c) contain the substance of the amendments proposed by the Supreme Court to insure voluntariness. Rule 11(c)(5) was not included in the original proposals transmitted to Congress but was added later by the House Judiciary Committee \u201cas a result of its change in subdivision (e)(6).\u201d 2 U.S.Code Cong. &amp; Admin.News, p. 679 (1975). As originally proposed, Rule 11(e)(6) contained a broad prohibition against the use in later proceedings of defendant\u2019s statements made at the Rule 11 hearing. The Committee amended this to make statements made by the defendant under oath, on the record, and in the presence of counsel admissible in a subsequent criminal proceeding for perjury or false statement. Since this exception created a potential risk to defendants, subsection (5) was added to Rule 11(c) to insure that defendants have notice of this risk. Fairness, not voluntariness, is the concept underlying Rule 11(c)(5).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
