Poe. Shortly after the complaint was filed the district court entered an order directing the Secretary to file the transcript of proceedings on a given date. When the Secretary had failed to file the transcript approximately ten weeks after the date set in its previous order the district court entered the order now under review in which it found the Secretary \u201cin default for pleading\u201d and in violation of the court\u2019s previous order. This order also granted the prayer of the complaint and remanded the case to the Secretary with directions to award the plaintiff benefits.</p>\n<p id=\"b197-24\">It is undisputed that the district court had no evidence before it when it directed the award of disability benefits. Of course, this condition was brought about by the failure of the Secretary to comply with the previous order of the court. This created a dilemma for the district court, particularly in view of this court\u2019s clear policy of requiring trial courts to treat social security cases with dispatch. See <em>Webb v. Richardson, </em>472 F.2d 529, 538 (1972).</p>\n<p id=\"b197-25\">We can fully appreciate the district court\u2019s feeling of frustration, as this court has experienced numerous delays because of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"138\">*138</page-number>the lack of responsiveness of the Department of Health, Education and Welfare to requests for the expeditious filing of legible and complete copies of records of administrative proceedings. Nevertheless we are constrained to reverse the judgment of the district court and remand this case. Rule 55(e), Fed.R.Civ.P. provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b198-4\">No judgment by default shall be entered against the United States or an officer or agency thereof unless the claimant establishes his claim or right to relief by evidence satisfactory to the court.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b198-5\">Though it was not attributable to any failure of the claimant, he has not established his \u201cclaim or right to relief\u201d in the present case by any evidence. Thus, it was error to enter judgment by default.</p>\n<p id=\"b198-6\">Claims for disability benefits are statutory proceedings and judicial review of final decisions of the Secretary in cases under the Social Security Act is controlled by 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 405(g), which provides, in part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b198-7\">The court shall have power to enter, upon the pleadings and <em>transcript of the record, </em>a judgment affirming, modifying, or reversing the decision of the Secretary . . (emphasis supplied).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b198-8\">A district court is without authority to affirm, modify or reverse a decision of the Secretary in such cases without considering the transcript of the record.</p>\n<p id=\"AWg\">We note also that \u00a7 405(g) provides that \u201c. . . the Secretary shall file a certified copy of the transcript of the record including the evidence upon which the findings and decision complained of are based.\u201d The question has not been raised in this case whether mandamus would lie to compel compliance by the Secretary with this provision of the statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b198-10\">The judgment of the district court is reversed. The cause is remanded to the district court with directions to remand it to the Secretary pursuant to \u00a7 405(g).</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
