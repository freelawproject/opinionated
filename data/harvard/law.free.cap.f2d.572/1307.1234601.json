He argues here that (1) the bringing of two of the three counts under which he was convicted was improper as the product of prosecutorial vindictiveness in violation of <em>North Carolina v. Pearce, </em>395 U.S. 711, 89 S.Ct. 2072, 23 L.Ed.2d 656 (1969) and <em>Blackledge v. Perry, </em>417 U.S. 21, 94 S.Ct. 2098, 40 L.Ed.2d 628 (1974), and (2) the jury instruction on the issue of whether the false statements had to be \u201cmaterial\u201d was defective as to all three counts. We affirm Thurnhuber\u2019s conviction on all counts.</p>\n<p id=\"b1368-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1308\">*1308</page-number>FACTS AND PROCEEDINGS BELOW</p>\n<p id=\"b1368-4\">Thurnhuber was originally indicted and tried on one count under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1014 for making a false statement on a Master Charge credit card application. When the jury was unable to reach a verdict in that trial, the district court, <em>sua sponte, </em>declared a mistrial. On the following day, the Government filed a superseding indictment charging Thurnhuber with three counts under \u00a7 1014. Count I referred to the same conduct described above. Counts II and III charged Thurnhuber with making false statements on a separate loan application.</p>\n<p id=\"b1368-5\">Evidence was introduced at the second trial to show, with respect to Count I, that in October 1973 Thurnhuber had applied for a Master Charge card at a Wells Fargo Bank in Modesto, California. On his application, Thurnhuber had identified himself as Hans von Burger and falsely claimed to be a retired airline pilot receiving $1,625.35 a month in retirement income from Lufthansa Airlines. As to Counts II and III, it was shown that Thurnhuber applied for a loan at the same bank in March 1974. On this loan application, Thurnhuber again gave his name as Hans von Burger and claimed to be receiving a monthly salary of $1,625.35. This time, however, he also stated that he had a note receivable from a real estate broker in the amount of $20,000.</p>\n<p id=\"b1368-6\">It was stipulated at the second trial that Thurnhuber had never been employed by Lufthansa, and the real estate broker testified that, while he was acquainted with Thurnhuber, he was not indebted to him. Thurnhuber was convicted on all three counts and sentenced to serve consecutive terms of two years each on Counts I and II, with two years on Count III to be served concurrently with Counts I and II. This appeal followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b1368-7\">I. \u201cMATERIALITY\u201d INSTRUCTION</p>\n<p id=\"b1368-8\">Thurnhuber claims the Government must prove that the false statement made in a bank credit application concerned a \u201cmaterial\u201d matter in order to convict under \u00a7 1014. That section, in pertinent part, provides that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1368-9\">[wjhoever knowingly makes any false statement ... for the purpose of influencing in any way the action of . any bank the deposits of which are insured by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation [is guilty of a federal crime].</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1368-10\">It contains no express requirement that the false statement be \u201cmaterial.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1368-11\">Several courts have held \u2014 apparently following the lead of <em>Kay v. United States, </em>303 U.S. 1, 5-6, 58 S.Ct. 468, 82 L.Ed. 607 (1938) (interpreting a predecessor of \u00a7 1014) \u2014that the gist of a \u00a7 1014 violation is the knowing attempt to influence through false statements. <em>See, e. g., United States v. Sabatino, </em>485 F.2d 540, 544-45 (2d Cir. 1973), <em>cert. denied, </em>415 U.S. 948, 94 S.Ct. 1469, 39 L.Ed.2d 563 (1974); <em>United States v. Goberman, </em>458 F.2d 226, 228-29 (3d Cir. 1972); <em>United States v. Kernodle, </em>367 F.Supp. 844, 851-52 (M.D.N.C.1973). Under this reading of the statute, consideration of materiality only serves to show that the defendant intended to influence and mislead \u2014 elements which could be established without reference to the materiality of the statements.</p>\n<p id=\"b1368-12\">On the other hand, at least one circuit has held that materiality of the matter concerning which the false statements were made is an essential, independent element of the offense. <em>See United States v. Kramer, </em>500 F.2d 1185, 1187 (10th Cir. 1974).</p>\n<p id=\"b1368-13\">In the instant case, the district court rejected the Government\u2019s proposed instruction which was modeled after that given in <em>United States v. Kernodle, supra. </em>It also refused Thurnhuber\u2019s proffered instruction, which was based on <em>United States v. Kramer, supra, </em>that materiality was a separate element of the offense. Instead, the court \u2014 in accordance with an alternative suggested by the Government \u2014 instructed the jurors that they must find the following in order to convict:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1368-14\"><em>First: </em>The act of making a false statement concerning a material matter upon an application ... for the purpose of influencing the action [of the bank].</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1369-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1309\">*1309</page-number>Thurnhuber now contends that this instruction was so ambiguous and misleading on the issue of materiality as to require reversal, and he argues that this circuit should follow the lead of the Tenth Circuit in <em>Kramer </em>in requiring the Government to prove materiality as an independent element.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1369-5\">Assuming <em>arguendo </em>that materiality is a separate element of \u00a7 1014 \u2014 thus providing Thurnhuber with a statutory interpretation most favorable to him at trial \u2014 we do not find that the instruction given by the district court was misleading. The instruction informed the jurors that they must find the \u201cact of making a false statement concerning a material matter.\u201d Thurnhuber disagrees with the trial court over whether the \u201cmateriality\u201d instruction should have been given in the same paragraph as the \u201cpurpose of influencing\u201d charge, or in a fourth, separate paragraph to be given in addition to the requirements that the statement be made for the \u201cpurpose of influencing\u201d the bank\u2019s action, that the defendant have acted knowingly and willfully in making the false statement, and that the bank at issue be federally insured. While \u2014 again on the assumption that materiality is a separate requirement \u2014 it would perhaps have been better for the trial court to have given a separate instruction particularizing the element of materiality, we cannot say that the instructions were misleading when viewed as a whole. <em>See United States v. Silla, </em>555 F.2d 703, 706 (9th Cir. 1977); <em>United States v. Kaplan, </em>554 F.2d 958, 968 (9th Cir. 1977); <em>United States v. Lemon, </em>550 F.2d 467, 470 (9th Cir. 1977).</p>\n<p id=\"b1369-6\">II. \u201cVINDICTIVE PROSECUTION\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1369-7\">In <em>North Carolina </em>v. <em>Pearce, </em>395 U.S. 711, 89 S.Ct. 2072, 23 L.Ed.2d 656 (1969), the Supreme Court held that, while there is no absolute constitutional bar to a judge\u2019s imposing a greater sentence upon retrial after a defendant had successfully attacked his conviction, due process does prohibit a judge from increasing a sentence in retaliation for the defendant\u2019s exercise of his statutory right to challenge his original conviction. The Court reasoned that due process requires both that such \u201cvindictiveness . must play no part\u201d in sentencing and \u201cthat a defendant [must] be freed of apprehension of such a retaliatory motive on the part of the sentencing judge.\u201d 395 U.S. at 725. It recognized that \u201c[t]he existence of a retaliatory motivation would, of course, be extremely difficult to prove in any individual case,\u201d 395 U.S. at 725 n. 20, 89 S.Ct. at 2080 n. 20. Wishing \u201cto assure the absence of such a motivation,\u201d 395 U.S. at 726, 89 S.Ct. at 2081, the Court held that a more severe sentence after retrial must be justified by actions of the defendant occurring after the original sentencing and appearing as part of the record so as to be subject to review. In the event that the state failed to present such justification, the defendant could not be given a sentence upon recon-viction greater than that which he had received after the first trial. 395 U.S. at 726, 89 S.Ct. 2072.</p>\n<p id=\"b1369-10\">In <em>Blackledge v. Perry, </em>417 U.S. 21, 94 S.Ct. 2098, 40 L.Ed.2d 628 (1974), the Court extended <em>Pearce's </em>concern for a sentencing judge\u2019s vindictiveness to situations involving retaliation by prosecutors.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> There, a defendant who had exercised-his statutory right to a trial <em>de novo </em>in a superior court following his conviction on a misdemeanor charge was reindicted for a felony. The Court ruled that, while there was \u201cno evidence that the prosecutor in this case acted <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1310\">*1310</page-number>in bad faith or maliciously in seeking a felony indictment against Perry,\u201d the rule of <em>Pearce </em>applied because of the grave \u201cpotential for vindictiveness\u201d inherent in the given facts. 417 U.S. at 28, 94 S.Ct. [2098] at 2102. Since the state failed to make the requisite showing that the more serious charge was justified for independent reasons, the presumption of vindictiveness prevailed. <em>See </em>417 U.S. at 29 n. 7,.94 S.Ct. 2098.</p>\n<p id=\"b1370-4\">Thurnhuber argues here that the presumptive rule of <em>Pearce </em>and <em>Blackledge </em>applies to the two additional counts brought against him by the prosecutor after his mistrial. He maintains that the Government was fully aware of the March 1974 incident when it sought the first indictment on the October 1973 application alone, and that the Government has presented no explanation sufficient to overcome its burden to prove that the bringing of the two additional counts was not vindictively motivated. The Government argues principally that, by filing an affidavit explaining that it brought the two additional counts only to strengthen its evidence on the intent element of the charges, it succeeded in overcoming the presumption of vindictiveness. In ruling on Thurnhuber\u2019s pretrial motion to dismiss Counts II and III as violations of <em>Pearce </em>and <em>Blackledge, </em>the district court held that any presumption of vindictiveness which might arise on these facts was overcome by the prosecutor\u2019s explanation of his actions. Thurnhuber argues that the district court\u2019s denial of his motion to dismiss was clearly erroneous.</p>\n<p id=\"b1370-5\">In <em>United States v. Ruesga-Martinez, </em>534 F.2d 1367 (9th Cir. 1976), we characterized <em>Pearce </em>and <em>Blackledge </em>as establishing</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1370-7\">beyond doubt, that when the prosecution has occasion to reindict the accused <em>because the accused has exercised some procedural right, </em>the prosecution bears a heavy burden of proving that any increase in the severity of the alleged charges was not motivated by a vindictive motive.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1370-8\">534 F.2d at 1369 (emphasis added, footnote omitted). Although a defendant\u2019s motion for a mistrial has been construed as the exercise of a procedural right for purposes of this rule, <em>see United States v. Preciado-Gomez, </em>529 F.2d 935, 937-41 (9th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>425 U.S. 953, 96 S.Ct. 1730, 48 L.Ed.2d 197 (1976); <em>United States v. Jamison, </em>164 U.S.App.D.C. 300, 505 F.2d 407, 415-16 <em>&amp; </em>n. 15 (1974), the mistrial which was declared in Thurnhuber\u2019s first trial was not granted in response to a motion by him. Rather, the court on its own motion declared the mistrial when the jury was unable to reach a verdict. Hence, since Thurnhuber did not attempt at his first trial to assert any procedural right, the prosecutor\u2019s action in adding the two counts before the second trial cannot be characterized as a \u201cretaliatory\u201d or \u201cvindictive\u201d response to an assertion of a procedural right by a defendant. And, since there was no such assertion, there can be no resulting dampening effect on the defendant\u2019s exercise of a procedural right. Without that close temporal \u2014 or otherwise apparent\u2014 link between the exercise of the right and the \u201cpenalty,\u201d there can be no \u201crealistic likelihood of \u2018vindictiveness,\u2019 \u201d <em>Blackledge, </em>417 U.S. at 27, 94 S.Ct. 2098, and there is, therefore, no need to invoke the broad presumptive rule of <em>Pearce </em>and <em>Blackledge. Cf. Chaffin v. Stynchcombe, </em>412 U.S. 17, 24-28, 93 S.Ct. 1977, 36 L.Ed.2d 714 (1973) (different sentencing bodies upon retrial); <em>Colten </em>v. <em>Kentucky, </em>407 U.S. 104,116-18, 92 S.Ct. 1953, 32 L.Ed.2d 584 (1972) (same).<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1371-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1311\">*1311</page-number>Thurnhuber\u2019s allegations of prosecutorial vindictiveness, therefore, must rest on an improper motive other than retaliation for the assertion of a procedural right. It is Thurnhuber, however, who bears the burden of showing improper prosecutorial conduct sufficiently grave to overcome an otherwise proper conviction. <em>See, e. g., United States v. Oaks, </em>527 F.2d 937, 940 (9th Cir. 1975), <em>cert. denied, </em>426 U.S. 952, 96 S.Ct. 3177, 49 L.Ed.2d 1191 (1976); <em>United States v. Scott, </em>521 F.2d 1188, 1195 (9th Cir. 1975), <em>cert. denied, </em>424 U.S. 955, 96 S.Ct. 1431, 47 L.Ed.2d 361 (1976); <em>United States </em>v. <em>Bennett, </em>539 F.2d 45, 54 (10th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>429 U.S. 925, 97 S.Ct. 327, 50 L.Ed.2d 293 (1976).</p>\n<p id=\"b1371-5\">To show improper conduct, Thurnhuber points to statements contained in the affidavit filed by the prosecutor after the mistrial was declared that he was \u201cupset and disgusted\u201d with the jury\u2019s inability to reach a verdict given what he thought to be overwhelming evidence of Thurnhuber\u2019s guilt. The district court received this evidence and, in addition, had before it the reasons cited by the prosecutor for delaying an indictment on Counts II and III until after the mistrial on Count I. In his affidavit, the prosecutor stated that he thought that the one-count indictment would be sufficient to present the Government\u2019s case, and that only when it became apparent that the jury was having difficulty with the intent element did he realize that it might be necessary to indict for the March 1974 incident as well.</p>\n<p id=\"b1371-6\">The district court accepted this explanation and ruled that, even if the prosecutor had the burden of overcoming Thurnhuber\u2019s claim of vindictive prosecution, he had succeeded in doing so by showing that proper prosecutorial zeal, rather than vindictiveness, had motivated his bringing of the two additional counts. We hold that the trial court\u2019s finding of no vindictiveness, which was reached even though the Jmrden of proof rested improperly on the prosecution, was not clearly erroneous. <em>See United States v. Hart, </em>546 F.2d 798, 801-02 (9th Cir. 1976) (en banc), <em>cert. denied, </em>429 U.S. 1120, 97 S.Ct. 1155, 51 L.Ed.2d 571 (1977).</p>\n<p id=\"b1371-9\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1369-8\">. This conflict over materiality will usually be only of academic interest. As in the present case, the usual situation will involve a statement which is clearly material. An individual is not likely to provide immaterial and unimportant information in the hope of influencing a bank\u2019s action. And an intent to influence is clearly a requirement of the statute.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b1369-11\">. Even before the Supreme Court\u2019s decision in <em>Blackledge, </em>several- courts, including ours, had extended the reach of <em>Pearce </em>to encompass prosecutors as well as judges. <em>See, e. g., United States v. Gerard, </em>491 F.2d 1300, 1305-06 (9th Cir. 1974); <em>United States ex rel. Williams v. McMann, </em>436 F.2d 103, 105 &amp; n. 5 (2d Cir. 1970), <em>cert. denied, </em>402 U.S. 914, 91 S.Ct. 1396, 28 L.Ed.2d 656 (1971); <em>Sefcheck v. Brewer, </em>301 F.Supp. 793, 795 (S.D.Iowa 1969).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b1370-6\">. An additional contention raised by Thurnhu-ber on appeal is that the presumption is aimed at the <em>appearance </em>of a vindictive penalty as well as at the <em>actuality </em>of vindictiveness. He reads <em>Pearce </em>and <em>Blackledge </em>to reason that an appearanc\u00e9 of vindictiveness causes apprehension in defendants; that such apprehension in turn \u201cchills\u201d defendants\u2019 exercise of procedural rights; and that it is that chill at which the rule is directed. Although we hold that the <em>Pearce-Biackledge </em>presumption is not triggered in this case because no procedural right was exercised by Thurnhuber, it should be noted additionally that the presumption is not based, as Thurnhu-ber argues, merely on the perceptions of defendants. It arises only as a shield against the possibility of <em>actual </em>vindictiveness and not against those situations which simply appear to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1311\">*1311</page-number>the defendant to be vindictively motivated. Language to the contrary is inconsistent with Supreme Court precedent which holds that the presumption is triggered only when the circumstances under examination actually present a \u201crealistic likelihood of vindictiveness,\u201d <em>Blackledge, </em>417 U.S. at 17, 94 S.Ct. 2098, and raise a \u201creasonable\u201d and \u201clegitimate\u201d fear of retaliation in defendants, <em>Chaffin v. Stynchcombe, </em>412 U.S. at 22-23, 25, 93 S.Ct. 1977.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
