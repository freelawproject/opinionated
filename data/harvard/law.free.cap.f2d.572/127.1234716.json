His widow, Mary Smakula, filed a claim with the Social Security Administration on September 8, 1970, for \u201cwidow\u2019s black lung benefits\u201d under the Federal Coal Mine Health and Safety Act of 1969, as amended, 30 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 901 <em>et seq. </em>(1970). After protracted proceedings, including three <em>de novo </em>administrative hearings, an administrative law judge (ALJ) awarded Mrs. Smakula black lung benefits in a decision of December 23, 1975<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> (Tr. 130-40; App. 27a-37a). <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"129\">*129</page-number>The Appeals Council, acting for the Secretary, reversed the ALJ\u2019s decision and denied Mrs. Smakula\u2019s claim for benefits (Decision of Jan. 15, 1976, Tr. 125-28; App. 39a-42a). The District Court for the Middle District of Pennsylvania entered summary judgment for the defendant and against the plaintiff (App. 55a) (Civ. No. 74-802, opinion filed Jan. 11, 1977, App. 56a-58a). On appeal to this court, we have determined that (a) the Secretary\u2019s final decision was not supported by substantial evidence, (b) the district court judgment should be reversed, and (c) the case should be remanded with directions to award widow\u2019s black lung benefits to Mrs. Smakula.</p>\n<p id=\"b189-5\">Section 411(a) of the Federal Coal Mine Health and Safety Act of 1969, 30 U.S.C. \u00a7 921(a) (Supp. V, 1975), provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b189-6\">\u201c(a) The Secretary shall, in accordance with the provisions of this part, and the regulations promulgated by him under this part, make payments of benefits in respect of total disability of any miner due to pneumoconiosis, and in respect of the death of any miner whose death was due to pneumoconiosis or who at the time of his death was totally disabled by pneumoconiosis.\u201d <footnotemark>2</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b189-7\">The duly adopted regulations establish a set of evidentiary presumptions which facilitate survivors\u2019 proof that deceased miners\u2019 disability or death was due to pneumoconio-sis. These presumptions enable claimants to obtain benefits despite the absence of a clinical diagnosis of pneumoconiosis as the exact cause of total disability or death.</p>\n<p id=\"b189-8\">The regulations governing determination of pneumoconiosis disability claims are set forth in 20 C.F.R. \u00a7\u00a7 410.410-410.430 (1977).</p>\n<p id=\"b189-10\">A miner is deemed to have been totally disabled if \u201cat the time of death . pneumoconiosis prevented, him from engaging in gainful work\u201d requiring comparable skills. 20 C.F.R. \u00a7 410.412. However, the fact that a miner persisted in attempting to work up to the date of his death does not automatically preclude a determination of total disability. The Social Security Administration and several courts of appeals have considered a working miner to be totally disabled if his employment immediately prior to death was characterized by \u201csporadic work, poor performance and marginal earnings.\u201d Social Security Ruling 73-36 (1973); <em>Felthager v. Weinberger, </em>529 F.2d 130 (10th Cir. 1976); <em>Farmer v. Weinberger, </em>519 F.2d 627 (6th Cir. 1975).</p>\n<p id=\"b189-11\">In addition to proving that the deceased miner was totally disabled at the time of his death, the survivor must causally relate the disability to mine-related pneumoconiosis. The existence of pneumoconiosis may be conclusively proven by various clinical tests, <em>see </em>20 C.F.R. \u00a7\u00a7 410.414(a), 410.428, or by resort to presumptions which require evidence only of \u201ca totally disabling chronic respiratory or pulmonary impairment,\u201d <em>see id. </em>\u00a7\u00a7 410.414(b), (c). Such a chronic lung impairment may be evidenced by medical tests, medical history, personal physician\u2019s statements, spouse\u2019s affidavits, and \u201cin the case of a deceased miner, other appropriate affidavits of persons with knowledge of the individual\u2019s physical condition, and other supportive materials.\u201d <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 410.414(c). The presumption may be rebutted by specific evidence that a lung impairment was not pneumoconiosis. <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 410.414(b)(2).<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b190-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"130\">*130</page-number>The regulations governing claims for death due to pneumoconiosis are set forth in 20 C.F.R. \u00a7\u00a7 410.450-410.462. Basically, claimants must satisfy two requirements-\u2014 the existence of mine-related pneumoconiosis and pneumoconiosis as a cause of death. Pneumoconiosis may be conclusively evidenced by certain medical diagnostic techniques. <em>See id. </em>\u00a7\u00a7 410.454(a), 410.428. Alternatively, pneumoconiosis may be presumed, in the absence of contrary evidence, from proof of the \u201cexistence of a chronic respiratory or pulmonary impairment from which the miner was totally disabled . prior to his death.\u201d <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 410.454(b)(1).<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> The existence of such an impairment may be adduced from medical tests, medical history, a spouse\u2019s affidavits, and \u201cother appropriate affidavits of persons with knowledge of the individual\u2019s physical condition, and other supportive materials.\u201d <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 (c). The regulations thus clearly contemplate that lay evidence of a miner\u2019s chronic respiratory impairment may support a presumption that he suffered from pneumoconiosis prior to his death.</p>\n<p id=\"b190-4\">The regulations also create presumptions regarding pneumoconiosis as a cause of death. 20 C.F.R. \u00a7 410.462(a) provides that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"ajt-dedup-0\">\u201c[I]f a deceased miner was employed for 10 years or more in the Nation\u2019s coal mines and died from a respirable disease, it will be presumed, in the absence of evidence to the contrary, that his death was due to pneumoconiosis arising out of employment in a coal mine.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b190-5\">To apply this cause of death presumption, 20 C.F.R. \u00a7 410.462(b) prescribes evidentiary rules for three distinct circumstances concerning the likelihood that death was due to a respirable disease.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> First, if there is a \u201cmedical ascription\u201d of the cause of death as due to a \u201cchronic dust disease,\u201d death will be presumed due to a respirable disease. However, where the medically ascribed cause of death is not reasonably consistent with the possibility of pneumoconiosis as the cause of death, death will not be presumed due to a respirable disease. But in certain cases there may not be a dispositive medically ascribed cause of death. For this third type of situation, the regulations provide that if \u201call the evidence\u201d suggests the decedent suffered from a respirable disease and that he died from indeterminate or multiple causes and if it is not medically feasible to separate the various possible causes of death, death will be presumed due to pneumoconiosis.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b190-11\">Mrs. Smakula contended that her husband was both totally disabled due to pneumoconiosis at the time of his death and that he died as a result of pneumoconiosis. In his December 23, 1975, decision, the ALJ concluded that on the basis of the complete administrative record Mr. Smakula had not been totally disabled at the time of his death within the meaning of 20 C.F.R. \u00a7 410.412 and Social Security Ruling 73-36. However, the ALJ also concluded that Mr. Smakula suffered from a respirable disease which \u201ccontributed significantly to his death\u201d and that he satisfied the \u00a7 410.462(b) presumption of death due to pneumoconiosis (Tr. 136-39; App. 33a-36a). The Ap<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"131\">*131</page-number>peals Council affirmed the ALJ\u2019s finding that Mr. Smakula was not totally disabled at the time of his death. However, the Council disagreed with the ALJ\u2019s conclusion as to cause of death, finding instead that the only medically ascribed cause of death was a coronary occlusion and not a respira-ble disease. The Appeals Council\u2019s decision concluded, in denying benefits under the \u00a7 410.462(b) presumption:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b191-5\">\u201cIn the absence of specific medical findings to the contrary, the Appeals Council accepts the evidence of the death certificate that the miner died of a coronary occlusion.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b191-6\">(Tr. 126; App. 40a)</p>\n<p id=\"b191-7\">This court must affirm the decision of the Appeals Council as the final decision of the Secretary if it is supported by substantial evidence. 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 405(a) (1970); <em>Richardson v. Perales, </em>402 U.S. 389, 91 S.Ct. 1420, 28 L.Ed.2d 842 (1971).</p>\n<p id=\"b191-8\">The Appeals Council\u2019s denial of disability benefits was based on its adoption of the ALJ\u2019s findings of fact. We have reviewed the ALJ\u2019s comprehensive survey of the evidence bearing on Mr. Smakula\u2019s work history at and immediately prior to his death and conclude that his determination that the deceased was not totally disabled was supported by substantial evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b191-9\">There was uncontroverted testimony and documentary evidence that Mr. Smakula ceased work in the mines on doctor\u2019s orders for a two-year period between 1954 and 1956 (Tr. 117-18, 175-76). However, when the family\u2019s savings had been depleted, Mr. Smakula returned to the mines, where he worked continually from mid-1956 until his death in May 1957 (Tr. 182-83). While Mr. Smakula may have been totally disabled, within the meaning of the regulations, during his two-year period of unemployment, 20 C.F.R. \u00a7 410.412(b) requires that the miner have been totally disabled from gainful work at the time of death. The ALJ correctly focused on whether Mr. Smakula\u2019s work performance and earnings during his last year of employment were so sporadic as to characterize him as disabled. Although the claimant testified that her husband\u2019s respiratory ailments forced him to miss work regularly, the ALJ found the widow\u2019s recollection in this regard vague and uncorroborated (Tr. 134; App. 31a). In contrast, Mr. Smakula\u2019s earnings records revealed a steady income, reflective of continuous work and complete performance up until his death. Moreover, Mr. Smakula\u2019s supervisor did not indicate that his work performance was less than normal. (See Tr. 132-36; App. 129a-133a.) Thus, there was substantial record evidence that Mr. Smakula\u2019s work was neither sporadic nor inadequate and that his earnings were normal, rather than marginal. Having been fully employed for a period of approximately 12 months prior to his death, Mr. Smaku-la was not totally disabled at the time of his death.</p>\n<p id=\"b191-11\">The Appeals Council also determined that Mr. Smakula\u2019s death was not due to pneu-moconiosis. This finding flatly contradicted the ALJ\u2019s conclusion that death was due to a respirable disease. We note that even if there was evidence in support of either conclusion, this court must affirm the Secretary\u2019s decision if it is supported by substantial evidence in the administrative record. <em>See Romanot </em>v. <em>Mathews, </em>422 F.Supp. 632, 635 (E.D.Pa.1976) (Higginbotham, J.).</p>\n<p id=\"b191-12\">The divergent conclusions of the Appeals Council and the ALJ stem in large measure from their different evaluations of Mr. Smakula\u2019s death certificate (41a). The only evidence that Mr. Smakula died from heart failure was contained in the death certificate signed by a Dr. Barrett, now also deceased, which stated that \u201ccoronary occlusion\u201d was the sole cause of death (Tr. 108). The certificate listed no other contributing conditions. However, the certificate did not indicate that any autopsy or other physical examination had been made of the body. Not only is the certificate\u2019s information sparse and unverified by clinical findings, but testimony at the hearing cast grave doubt on its reliability.</p>\n<p id=\"b191-13\">Mr. Peter Kerpan, a mortician and longtime friend of Mr. Smakula, testified that he was called to the colliery wash house and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"132\">*132</page-number>arrived within 15 to 20 minutes of Mr. Smakula\u2019s collapse. He noted that the body had not been disturbed in any way and that, based on his experience, no one had as yet physically examined the decedent (Tr. 190-91). Mr. Kerpan also testified that after immediate removal of the body to his mortuary until the time of burial, no doctor examined the body (Tr. 189-90). Late in the afternoon of the day Mr. Smakula died, Mr. Kerpan located Dr. Barrett, the deputy coroner, and brought him a death certificate for signature (Tr. 192-93). Dr. Barrett filled in \u201ccoronary occlusion\u201d as the cause of death, signed the certificate, and handed it back to Mr. Kerpan (Tr. 194). As far as Mr. Kerpan knew, Dr. Barrett never examined Mr. Smakula\u2019s body and had no basis for determining the cause of death as a coronary occlusion (Tr. 195). Mr. Kerpan also testified that, in his experience, which included the occasion to embalm many miners who had died suddenly (Tr. 199), standard procedure by the coroner\u2019s office was not to bother with examination of the bodies and perfunctorily attribute cause of death to a heart attack.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b192-4\">Based on Mr. Kerpan\u2019s testimony, which was found to be highly credible (Tr. 137; App. 34a), the ALJ concluded that \u201cthe [death] certificate did not truly contain the cause of death.\u201d <em>Id. </em>The ALJ therefore disregarded the death certificate in determining Mr. Smakula\u2019s cause of death (Tr. 138, App. 35a). The Appeals Council, in reversing the AU, did not even remark on the ALJ\u2019s reliance on this portion of Mr. Kerpan\u2019s testimony to discredit the death certificate. The Council\u2019s decision simply accepted, without explanation, the certificate\u2019s stated cause of death. No other evidence in the record supported either the reliability of the death certificate or its conclusion that death was due to a coronary occlusion. We believe that in light of the ALJ\u2019s having credited Mr. Kerpan\u2019s persuasive and unchallenged testimony, the death certificate was unreliable and did not constitute substantial evidence that Mr. Smakula died of a coronary occlusion.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> <em>See Craig v. Weinberger, </em>522 F.2d 394 (6th Cir. 1975).</p>\n<p id=\"b192-10\">With the death certificate disregarded as probative of the cause of Mr. Smakula\u2019s death, the crux of claimant\u2019s appeal is whether the evidence recognized by the ALJ as establishing a respirable disease as a cause of death satisfied the evidentiary presumptions of 20 C.F.R. \u00a7\u00a7 410.454 and 410.-462. We do not read \u00a7 410.462(b) as exclusively requiring that the medically ascribed cause of death be a respiratory or chronic lung disease. Section 410.462(b) specifically provides for the situation where all the evidence suggests the influence of a respirable disease but it is medically unfeasible to attribute death to a particular cause. While the medical ascription of cause of death, be it on a death certificate, an autopsy report or a report of an examining physician, may be conclusive, if reliable, an inconclusive or unreliable ascription should not foreclose a widow from marshalling all relevant evidence to establish that her husband died from a respirable disease. In short, an untrustworthy medical ascription is analogous to the situation of an indeter<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"133\">*133</page-number>m\u00ednate medical ascription. In both circumstances the regulations anticipate reference may be made to all relevant evidence of the miner\u2019s physical condition. <em>See Wallace v. Mathews, </em>554 F.2d 299 (6th Cir. 1977).</p>\n<p id=\"b193-5\">The Appeals Council\u2019s decision would impose a burden on the claimant to produce contemporaneous-to-death medical evidence positively verifying that death was due to a respirable disease. This would be an impossible burden in cases where the contemporaneous clinical diagnosis is either indeterminate or untrustworthy. Thus, we read \u00a7 410.462(b)\u2019s reference to \u201call the evidence\u201d as identical to the scope of \u201crelevant evidence\u201d admissible under \u00a7 410.454(c) to prove the existence of pneumoconiosis. Medical tests, as well as medical histories and lay person\u2019s knowledge of physical conditions, are all relevant to determining whether a miner died as a result of a respirable disease.</p>\n<p id=\"b193-6\">There was uncontroverted evidence<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> that during 1957 a Dr. Kubasko had examined Mr. Smakula and advised him that he had developed miner\u2019s asthma (Tr. 61, 80, 110). Several years prior to his death, Mr. Smakula had also been under medical treatment for a chronic respiratory ailment (Tr. 83-85).<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> Mrs. Smakula further recalled that on doctor\u2019s orders her husband was forced to quit working in the mines in 1954 (Tr. 175-76). Mr. Smakula remained at home for two years, returning to the mines only because family savings had been depleted and he could not secure other employment (Tr. 177).<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> Throughout the last few years of his life, Mr. Smakula\u2019s physical condition deteriorated, especially his endurance, mobility and weight (Tr. 57-58, 60, 72-73, 78-81, 104-05, 109-10, 176, 178-83, 187). He was often wracked by coughing spells and lung congestion (Tr. 179-80, 187).<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> Moreover, according to Mrs. Smakula, no doctor had ever attributed her husband\u2019s progressive respiratory difficulties to a heart ailment (Tr. 75).</p>\n<p id=\"b193-11\">.Mr. Smakula\u2019s death was sudden and his body was never subjected to thorough medical examination. However, Mr. Kerpan testified that during embalming he encountered considerable black fluid while draining the lungs (Tr. 206-07). To Mr. Kerpan, who was experienced in embalming miners, the large amounts of fluid represented anthracosis (Tr. 207-09).<footnotemark>13</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b193-12\">In sum, there was considerable relevant evidence in the record, from persons familiar with Mr. Smakula\u2019s physical condition, before and after death, to indicate that he suffered from a chronic respirable disease. And an inference may be drawn that it was a significant contributing factor in his death. Thus, the ALJ\u2019s findings were certainly supported by substantial evidence. The Appeals Council misapprehended the regulations\u2019 requirements as to consideration of relevant evidence and, therefore, incorrectly insisted on a contemporaneous-to-death medical diagnosis of a respirable disease as the cause of death. As a result, their conclusion denying applicability of the \u00a7 410.462(b) presumption was not supported by substantial evidence in the administrative record.</p>\n<p id=\"b194-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"134\">*134</page-number>We reverse the district court\u2019s January 11, 1977, judgment in favor of the defendant and against the plaintiff, and we remand the case so that the district court may direct the grant to Mrs. Smakula of widow\u2019s black lung benefits in accordance with this opinion.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b188-18\">. Mrs. Smakula\u2019s claim was initially denied by administrative personnel (Tr. 97-98, 101). After a requested hearing, an ALJ denied benefits <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"129\">*129</page-number>on March 16, 1972 (Tr. 31-36). The Appeals Council remanded for reconsideration in light of amendments to the Act (Tr. 28). After a second de <em>novo </em>hearing, the ALJ again denied benefits (Tr. 6-11; App. 10a-16a). The Appeals Council affirmed the denial of benefits (Tr. 3). The district court vacated the denial of benefits and remanded for reconsideration of the evidence of the claimant\u2019s entitlement to benefits (Memorandum Opinion No. 74-802, M.D.Pa., Sept. 30, 1975; reproduced at App. 18a-25a). At this point, the ALJ held the third hearing, after which he re-examined his findings and awarded Mrs. Smakula benefits.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b189-13\">.

During his two-year absence from the mines, while confined to his home, Mr. Smaku-la most probably would have qualified, on the present record, as totally disabled due to pneu-moconiosis. The fact that he did not so qualify at death was not due to the improvement of his respiratory condition but rather to the provision in the regulations barring a working miner, however sick, from being considered totally disabled. In fact, Dr. Kubasko advised Mr. Smakula to cease work in 1957 because of his miner\u2019s asthma (Tr. 61, 80, 110).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"12\">\n<p id=\"b193-14\">.
