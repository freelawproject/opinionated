On appeal, he argues that he was denied a fair trial because the trial court improperly interjected itself in the government\u2019s behalf during the trial by: (1) instructing the prosecutor to ask certain questions during the government\u2019s cross-examination of Morris, and (2) commenting on the evidence in his instructions to the jury.</p>\n<p id=\"b245-19\">We have carefully reviewed the cross-examination of Morris and find that the trial court did not exceed its proper role by becoming another advocate for the government. <em>See United States v. Gregory Date Lowe, </em>No. 77-1680 (8th Cir. February 1, 1978); <em>United States v. McColgin, </em>535 F.2d 471, 474-475 (8th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>429 U.S. 853, 97 S.Ct. 145, 50 L.Ed.2d 128 (1976); <em>Kramer v. United States, </em>408 F.2d 837, 841 (8th Cir. 1969).</p>\n<p id=\"b245-20\">While the trial court\u2019s comments on the evidence approached the limits of permissible comment, they did not exceed those limits. <em>See United States v. Brandom, </em>479 F.2d 830 (8th Cir. 1973); <em>Scruggs v. United States, </em>450 F.2d 359, 363 (8th Cir. 1971), <em>cert. denied, </em>405 U.S. 1071, 92 S.Ct. 1521, 31 L.Ed.2d 804 (1972); <em>Weare v. United States, </em>1 F.2d 617, 618 (8th Cir. 1924).</p>\n<p id=\"b245-21\">The judgment of conviction is affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
