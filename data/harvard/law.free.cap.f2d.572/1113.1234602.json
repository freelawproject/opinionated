We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b1175-4\">Prior to 1960, Plaquemines Parish had a ten-member police jury and a ten-member school board, both of which were elected from ten single-member district or wards. In 1961, Plaquemines abandoned the police jury system and adopted a Parish Commission Council charter which provided for a five-member council to be elected at large. No change was made in the School Board\u2019s composition or method of election at that time.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1175-16\">Louisiana law then required:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1175-17\">The membership of each parish school board shall be as follows:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1175-18\">There shall be elected by the qualified ' voters of each police [parish] jury ward of the several parishes of the state a member of the school board of such parish for each police juror in said ward.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"ARV\">La.Rev.Stat. \u00a7 17:52 (as it read before 1975).</p>\n<p id=\"b1175-19\">In 1967, the Parish Council adopted Ordinance 81<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> pursuant to La.Rev.Stat. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1116\">*1116</page-number>\u00a7 33:1224 (as it read before 1968)<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> which provided for apportioning the parish into five single-member election wards so that there would be five school board members. It is the School Board\u2019s contention that once there were five wards then La.Rev.Stat. \u00a7 17:52 came into operation and one School Board member would be elected from each ward. Ordinance 81 also provided that no elections would be held until, due to attrition by death or term expirations, one or more of the newly created wards had no representative on the school board. This provision resulted in no school board elections between 1967 and 1970.</p>\n<p id=\"b1176-15\">In June 1970, when elections were needed to fill three openings on the school board, the school board adopted a resolution which retained the five-member board and the wards created by Ordinance 81. However, the Resolution provided elections would be \u201cat-large\u201d with one member residing in each of the five wards. One specific part of the Resolution provided:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1176-16\">WHEREAS, State Reapportionment Laws provide that the School Board may create such special School Board Election Districts as it deems desirable and that all or part of its members may be elected from such Districts, and one or more of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1117\">*1117</page-number>its members may be elected at large from each such Districts .</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1177-5\">Appendix p. 19. This paragraph essentially tracks the provisions of 1968 La. Acts No. 561, \u00a7 1, La.Rev.Stat. \u00a7 17:71.1 through 17-.71.6.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> On June 29, 1969, the Attorney General of the United States had interposed an objection to No. 561 under the authority granted him by \u00a7 5 of the Voting Rights Act of 1965.</p>\n<p id=\"b1177-6\">By letter dated August 20, 1970, the School Board notified the Attorney General of its Resolution of June, 1970. Additional information was mailed to the Attorney General by letter dated September 29,1970, and contained a five page memorandum purporting to demonstrate the validity of the election change and the election held pursuant to that change in August, 1970. On December 2,1970, the Attorney General, through an assistant, responded, explaining that due to \u201chis earlier objection to the enabling legislation and federal court decisions affecting at-large election problems, we doubt that the Attorney General of the United States has authority to object or indicate that he has no objection to such a change in Plaquemines Parish.\u201d (Appendix p. 23).</p>\n<p id=\"b1177-7\">On April 14, 1972, the objection to No. 561 was withdrawn on the express condition that the State Attorney General would notify all parishes that they must independently submit any proposed implementation of the statute. It came to the attention of the Department of Justice in August, 1975, that Plaquemines Parish had been following its 1970 Resolution all along. The Assistant Attorney General wrote advising the School Board:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1177-8\">If the School Board desires to legally implement the changes [made by the 1970 Resolution] . . ., it is necessary . that they be submitted to either the Attorney General of the United States or the United States District Court for the District of Columbia for review pursuant to section 5 of the Voting Rights Act of 1965, 42 U.S.C. 1973c.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1177-12\">Appendix p. 25. Counsel for the School Board replied, by letter dated September 5, 1975, that the 1970 Resolution had merely reduced the number of members on the School Board from ten to five, pursuant to La.Rev.Stat. \u00a7 17:52, and this change had been submitted to the Attorney General on August 20 and September 29, 1970, but no objection had been interposed by the Attorney General within sixty days. This prompted suit by private plaintiffs in January, 1975.</p>\n<p id=\"b1177-13\">Section 5 of the Voting Rights Act of 1965 requires that the Attorney General object to a plan within sixty days after it is submitted. The School Board\u2019s contention that its plan, mailed September 29, 1970, must be presumed to have been received by the United States Department of Justice by October 2, 1970 is without merit. The result, if this contention were meritorious, would be that the Attorney General\u2019s response of December 2,1970, was given more than sixty days after the plan\u2019s submission, and therefore, the submission must be deemed approved under \u00a7 5. The School Board contends that because its plan was mailed on September 29, 1970, it must be presumed to have been received by the Department of Justice on or before October, 2, 1970, and that the Attorney General\u2019s December 2, 1970, response was mailed beyond the sixty day limit. Therefore, it concludes, the plan must be deemed approved under \u00a7 5 of the Voting Rights Act. Both defendants\u2019 contention and its conclusion are faulty. The September 29 letter sent by defendants was offered into evidence by <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1118\">*1118</page-number>plaintiffs and upon it the Department of Justice time stamp clearly showed receipt on October 5, 1970. The speed of the United States Postal Service is not an irrebutta-ble presumption. The documentary evidence is undisputed and, therefore, rebuts any inference of a more speedy delivery. The district court properly found the Attorney General\u2019s reply was mailed within the mandatory sixty-day reply period.</p>\n<p id=\"b1178-4\">The district court further found the defendants\u2019 1970 submission was premature and could not be considered by the Attorney General because the Attorney General had interposed an objection to the statute, La.Rev.Stat. \u00a7 17:71.1 <em>et seq., </em>under which reapportionment was authorized. The School Board argues that it had the authority to change to at-large elections of its members under La.Rev.Stat. \u00a7 17:71 <em>et seq.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1178-5\">The facts of this case strongly indicate the School Board was changed to a five-member body in 1967 in order to comply with La.Rev.Stat. \u00a7 17:52 which required the School Board to have the same number of members as the Commission Council (as substituted for the police jury). The defendants suggestion that because the Commission Council is elected at-large, \u00a7 17:52 requires the School Board to be elected at-large is not persuasive. The statute is totally silent as to the manner of election. Its provisions deal with the number of members and not method of selection.</p>\n<p id=\"b1178-6\">The School Board\u2019s argument also overlooks its clear reliance upon La.Rev.Stat. \u00a7 17:71 in passing the resolution of June, 1970.</p>\n<p id=\"b1178-7\">The United States Supreme Court, in <em>East Carroll Parish School Board v. Marshall, </em>424 U.S. 636, 96 S.Ct. 1083, 47 L.Ed.2d 296 (1976), considered the Attorney General\u2019s objection to La.Rev.Stat. \u00a7 17:71 and stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1178-8\">Moreover, since the Louisiana enabling legislation was opposed by the Attorney General of the United States under \u00a7 5 of the Voting Rights Act, the [police] jury did not have the authority to reapportion itself.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1178-11\">424 U.S. at 639, note 6, 96 S.Ct. at 1085. The Supreme Court\u2019s conclusion that the police jury did not have the authority to reapportion itself pursuant to an opposed statute is equally controlling upon the School Board. The School Board changed to an at-large election under La.Rev.Stat. \u00a7 17:71 at a time when the Attorney General had interposed an objection. The reapportionment action by the School Board was, therefore, ineffective and the submission of such a plan to the Attorney General was properly found by the district court to be premature.</p>\n<p id=\"b1178-12\">In its brief as amicus curiae, the United States argues that a three-judge court was required pursuant to 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1973c to determine the issues in this case.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> When Congress passed the Voting Rights Act of 1965, it provided for a three-judge court in 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1973c because in cases involving a clash between state and federal authorities, hearing by a three-judge court with a direct appeal to the Supreme Court would hopefully lessen federal-state friction which was bound to arise due to this intrusion into a traditionally state-controlled province.</p>\n<p id=\"b1178-13\">In <em>Bailey v. Patterson, </em>369 U.S. 31, 82 S.Ct. 549, 7 L.Ed.2d 512 (1962), recognizing this same policy governed Congress when it passed 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2281 <em>et seq. </em>(provided for three-judge courts in certain instances), the Supreme Court held that if the constitutional issue presented is insubstantial or frivolous, it is not necessary to convene a three-judge court. Because the policy considerations are identical, we agree with the district court\u2019s holding that the <em>Bailey </em>precedent can be applied to actions brought, under \u00a7 5 of the Voting Rights Act which are insubstantial or frivolous.</p>\n<p id=\"b1178-14\">Defendants\u2019 contentions that they are not covered by \u00a7 5 of the Voting Rights <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1119\">*1119</page-number>Act, that they made an effective submission of an election plan to the Attorney General, and that the Attorney General did not object to this submission are without merit. As the district court stated, \u201cIn all important respects, this conclusion is controlled by Supreme Court precedent or cannot be seriously contested.\u201d <em>Broussard v. Perez, </em>416 F.Supp. 584, 589 (E.D.La.1976). We, therefore, hold that defendants\u2019 arguments are insubstantial under <em>Bailey </em>and it was not necessary to convene a three-judge court under \u00a7 5 of the Voting Rights Act.</p>\n<p id=\"b1179-5\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1174-10\">.
