Wise, </em>550 F.2d 1180 (9 Cir. 1977). It is true, as appellants contend, that each of these agreements contains as part of paragraph 9(a) the language: \u201cAt ABC\u2019s election and cost a file-screening copy shall be retained notwithstanding subparagraph 9(c).\u201d Here, as in <em>Wise, </em>there was no evidence as to whether ABC exercised its option, or, if it did, whether it resold that print. We held in <em>Wise </em>that in the absence of such proof the Government had failed in its burden of proving absence of a first sale.</p>\n<p id=\"b275-26\">This question was not raised in the district court or in the initial briefs filed by appellants in this court. We have had some difficulty in locating the agreements, but find they were introduced in evidence as exhibits. In view of the fact that the Government did not prove the source of appellants\u2019 prints, but relied upon its proof that no first sales had been made to anyone, we are obliged to hold, as we did in <em>Wise, </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"216\">*216</page-number>that there was a failure of proof with respect to these three films. It is necessary accordingly to reverse the convictions under Counts Six, Eight, and Nine and remand for a new trial on these counts. If the Government is unable to produce proof of the source of appellants\u2019 prints of \u201cThe Way We Were,\u201d \u201cForty Carats,\u201d and \u201cThe Take,\u201d these counts will be subject to dismissal.</p>\n<p id=\"b276-4\">In view of the reversal of the convictions on Counts Six, Eight, and Nine, it is necessary to remand also for resentencing.</p>\n<p id=\"b276-5\">The convictions on Counts One, Two, Three, Four, Five, Seven, and Ten<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> are affirmed; the convictions on Counts Six, Eight, and Nine are reversed. The cause is remanded for a new trial on the counts which are reversed and for resentencing on the counts which are affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b276-6\">The motion for leave to file appellants\u2019 petition to reconsider their petition for rehearing and addendum thereto, filed herein on January 9, 1978, is denied.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b275-27\"> Honorable William J. Jameson, Senior United States District Judge for the District of Montana, sitting by designation.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b276-18\">. Appellants contend that the agreement for telecast of \u201cThe New Centurions\u201d (Count Ten) was also identical in its provisions to the agreement for \u201cFunny Girl\u201d (Count Seven in <em>United States </em>v. <em>Wise). </em>We find, however, that the agreement for \u201cThe New Centurions\u201d did not contain the paragraph 9(a) language, quoted <em>supra, </em>but rather contained language similar to the agreement for \u201cCamelot\u201d (Count III in <em>Wise), </em>which was found to be a license and not a sale. 550 F.2d at 1191.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
