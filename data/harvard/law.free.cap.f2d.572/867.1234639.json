(Oskey), the intervenor-appellee, for termination of its relationships with its base period suppliers and the assignment of new, permanent suppliers. We vacate the stay order below and remand the case for a determination of Sun\u2019s claims on the merits.</p>\n<p id=\"b928-12\">We briefly summarize the history of the case. On September 24, 1974, FEA Region V issued an order terminating Oskey\u2019s relationships with its base period suppliers (Farmland, OKC, and Century) on the basis that they were \u201cunworkable.\u201d On September 26, 1974, Region V ordered Sun and other refiners to supply Oskey its base period allocation. Sun appealed from the September 26 order to the FEA Office of Exceptions and Appeals, which on February 20, 1975, invalidated the September 26 order. <em>Sun Oil Co. v. Oskey Gasoline and Oil Co., </em>2 CCH Fed.Energy Guidelines \u00b6 80,535. Similar appeals filed by Texaco, Champlin, Mobil, Shell, and Union were granted. <em>Texaco, Inc. </em>v. <em>Oskey Gasoline and Oil Co., </em>2 CCH Fed.Energy Guidelines \u00b6 80,564 (Apr. 8, 1975); <em>Shell Oil Co. </em>v. <em>Oskey Gasoline &amp; Oil Co., </em>2 CCH Fed.Energy Guidelines \u00b6 80,565 (Apr. 8, 1975). On February 28, 1975, Region V reestablished Farmland, OKC, and Century as Oskey\u2019s suppliers.</p>\n<p id=\"b928-14\">Oskey, now essentially back in its former position, filed an Application for Exception requesting a permanent assignment of new suppliers other than its base period suppliers. On April 9,1975, FEA granted Oskey\u2019s Application for Exception in modified form. Oskey Gasoline and Oil Co., 2 CCH Fed.Energy Guidelines \u00b6 83,114. Both Farmland and Sun, among others, were assigned to supply Oskey under a Region V order of April 30, 1975, pursuant to the April 9 decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b928-15\">Meanwhile, on March 11, 1975, Farmland filed an action in the United States District Court for the District of Kansas challenging the validity of FEA\u2019s February 20, 1975 order and seeking a stay of Region V\u2019s February 28,1975 order under which Farmland was to supply Oskey some 6.77 million gallons of motor gasoline during 1975. On May 2, 1975, the Kansas court issued a temporary injunction restraining enforcement of FEA\u2019s order of February 20, 1975, and subsequent orders based thereon. <em>Farmland Industries, Inc. v. Goldstein, </em>Civ.No. 75-57-C2 (D.Kan. May 2, 1975). FEA decided not to appeal the Kansas court\u2019s decision and Region V rescinded its assignment orders of February 28 and April 30, 1975.</p>\n<p id=\"b929-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"869\">*869</page-number>On June 19,1975, FEA Region V issued a Notice of Temporary Assignment directing Sun to supply a portion of Oskey\u2019s base period allocation, setting forth a proposed permanent assignment order to Sun, and soliciting Sun\u2019s comments, pursuant to 10 C.F.R. \u00a7 205.33. On July 21,1975, Sun filed written comments on the proposed permanent assignment order, contending that the proposed assignment would be improper because FEA was attempting to bind Sun to the decision in the Kansas litigation, although Sun was not a party to that action. On August 1, 1975, Region V issued an assignment order making permanent Sun\u2019s assignment to provide Oskey over 18 million gallons of motor gasoline per year. On October 14,1975, the FEA Office of Exceptions and Appeals denied Sun\u2019s appeal from the August 1 order. 2 CCH Fed.Energy Guidelines \u00b6 80,705.</p>\n<p id=\"b929-5\">On August 21, 1975, the present action was filed in the United States District Court for the Southern District of Texas. Sun contended that the August 1 order was not supported by substantial evidence and that the order violated due process. Oskey was permitted to intervene. On December 11, 1975, Sun filed a motion for judgment on the pleadings. After the Kansas court denied a motion by Oskey to join Sun as a party in the Kansas action,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Oskey, on December 10, 1976, moved the Texas court to transfer the Texas action to Kansas or, in the alternative, to stay the proceedings in Texas. In its Memorandum and Order of August 29, 1977, the Texas court denied Oskey\u2019s motion to transfer and granted Os-key\u2019s motion to stay, pending resolution of the Kansas action. The Texas court did not reach the merits of Sun\u2019s motion for judgment on the pleadings.</p>\n<p id=\"b929-11\">FEA and Oskey contend that the decision of the Texas court is not conclusive or final within the meaning of 28 U.S.C. \u00a71291.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Oskey points out that the Texas court has merely deferred Sun\u2019s motion pending the Kansas decision, and asserts that the case is pending on the Kansas court\u2019s docket, to be tried when it is reached on the court\u2019s calendar. After the Kansas court makes a final determination of the validity of the February 20, 1975 order, the argument goes, Sun may seek review of the August 1, 1975 order in the court below.</p>\n<p id=\"b929-12\">The problem with this argument is that no party to the Kansas action shows any interest in challenging the temporary injunction issued May 2, 1975. The assignment orders of February 28,1975, and April <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"870\">*870</page-number>30, 1975, were withdrawn after the injunction issued. FEA did not appeal from the Kansas court\u2019s decision and has adopted it by conforming its August 1, 1975 assignment order to the injunction. Oskey is pleased with the August 1 assignment order (as is Farmland, we presume), and Sun is not a party to the Kansas action. The result is that the temporary injunction issued by the Kansas court has been in effect nearly three years.</p>\n<p id=\"b930-4\">We believe the Texas court\u2019s order staying the proceedings pending a determination by the Kansas court effectively terminated the action below. A number of courts of appeals have recognized that a stay of proceedings may have a terminal effect and have pragmatically addressed themselves to the problem. In <em>Hines v. D\u2019Artois, </em>531 F.2d 726 (5th Cir. 1976), where the district court order stayed a civil rights action until plaintiff initiated and completed an EEOC proceeding which might take from eighteen months to five years, the court treated the stay order as appealable under section 1291:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b930-5\">A \u201cpractical\u201d construction requires that when a plaintiff\u2019s action is effectively dead, the order which killed it must be viewed as final. Effective death should be understood to comprehend any extended state of suspended animation.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b930-6\">531 F.2d at 730.</p>\n<p id=\"b930-7\">The decision in <em>Hines </em>invoked the Supreme Court\u2019s command in <em>Cohen v. Beneficial Industry Loan Co., </em>337 U.S. 541, 546, 69 S.Ct. 1221, 1226, 93 L.Ed. 1528, 1536 (1949), that the requirement of finality is to be given a \u201cpractical rather than a technical construction.\u201d The <em>Hines </em>court also took note of the decisions in <em>Gillespie v. United States Steel Corp., </em>379 U.S. 148, 85 S.Ct. 308, 13 L.Ed.2d 199 (1964), and <em>Idlewild Bon Voyage Liquor Corp. v. Epstein, </em>370 U.S. 713, 82 S.Ct. 1294, 8 L.Ed.2d 794 (1962), where a stay order in effect directing the parties to go to state court, institute an action, and obtain a ruling on the state law was held appealable as a final order under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291. The courts in <em>Amdur </em>v. <em>Lizars, </em>372 F.2d 103, 105-06 (4th Cir. 1967), and <em>In re Grand Jury Proceedings, </em>525 F.2d 151, 155 (3d Cir. 1975), similarly held appealable indefinite stays which had the practical effect of a dismissal of the proceedings. <em>See generally </em>Wright, Miller &amp; Cooper, 15 Fed. Practice and Procedure \u00a7 3914, at 564. <em>See also Kelley v. Metropolitan County Board of Education, </em>436 F.2d 856, 862 (6th Cir. 1970), <em>cert. denied </em>409 U.S. 1001, 93 S.Ct. 322, 34 L.Ed.2d 262 (1972); <em>McSurely v. McClellan, </em>138 U.S. App.D.C. 187, 194, 426 F.2d 664, 671 n. 47 (1970) (\u201cThere is undoubted appellate jurisdiction to review the grant of an indefinite stay in a civil proceeding.\u201d)</p>\n<p id=\"b930-11\">Neither of the cases cited by FEA is controlling. In <em>Rodgers v. United States Steel Corp., </em>508 F.2d 152, 159 (3d Cir. 1975), the stay was not appealable as a final order under section 1291 because it was by its terms tentative, the district court having made clear its intent to reconsider the stay in approximately six months. In any event, review was sought of collateral orders. We are not concerned with a collateral order in this case. In <em>Cotler </em>v. <em>Inter-County Orthopaedic Ass\u2019n, </em>526 F.2d 537, 540 (3d Cir. 1975), the stay did not finally dispose of the entire case, the court noting that \u201c[t]he \u00a7 10(b) claim may be old and feeble at the end of the state court litigation, but it will not be dead.\u201d Even though the stay was determined to be non-appealable, mandamus issued to set the stay order aside.</p>\n<p id=\"b930-12\">Sun argues that the stay order as framed effectively disposes of the entire matter on the merits.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> As we have noted, the Texas court did not reach the merits of Sun\u2019s motion for judgment on the pleadings. Nor do we believe that the court below has in any way determined the validity of the FEA assignment order of August 1, 1975. It is apparent that Sun has a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"871\">*871</page-number>serious due process argument. Sun must prove the allegations relating to its due process claim in the district court and obtain a ruling there before seeking review in this court, which is not well equipped to conduct evidentiary hearings. <em>See United States v. State of Ohio, </em>487 F.2d 936, 938 (Em.App.1973), <em>aff\u2019d sub. nom. Fry v. United States, </em>421 U.S. 542, 95 S.Ct. 1792, 44 L.Ed.2d 363 (1975), <em>cert. denied </em>421 U.S. 1014, 95 S.Ct. 2422, 44 L.Ed.2d 683. This disposition accords with our recent decision in <em>Allied Paper Inc. v. United Gas Pipe Line Co., </em>561 F.2d 821 (Em.App.1977), vacating a stay order and remanding for a determination whether the parties entered into a contract binding under federal law.</p>\n<p id=\"b931-6\">The stay order is vacated and the case is remanded to the district court with directions to take all appropriate action to expedite a hearing on the merits.</p>\n<p id=\"b931-7\">VACATED and REMANDED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b929-6\">. After this litigation commenced in Texas, Os-key, at the direction of the Texas court, sought to join Sun as a party in the Kansas action. The Kansas court concluded that joinder was not appropriate since the issues before it and the litigation pending in the Texas court \u201cappear to be completely separate and independent.\u201d <em>Farmland Industries, Inc. v. Goldstein, </em>Civ.No. 75-57-C2 (D.Kan. Oct. 27, 1976), at 3 (A. 187). The Texas court, on the other hand, indicated that the Kansas litigation would be dispositive of Sun\u2019s suit in Texas, due to the interdependence of the FEA orders challenged. <em>Sun Oil Co. </em>v. <em>FEA, </em>Civ.No. 75-H-1458 (S.D. Tex. Aug. 27, 1977), at 4-5 (A. 227).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b929-7\">. Our jurisdiction arises from section 211(b)(2) of the Economic Stabilization Act of 1970, 12 U.S.C. \u00a7 1904 (note), as incorporated in the Emergency Petroleum Allocation Act of 1973, 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 754 (1975). Sun suggests that under section 211(b)(2), which gives this court \u201cexclusive jurisdiction of all appeals from the district courts of the United States in cases and controversies arising under this title . . .\u201d, finality is not as stringent a requirement as under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291, which expressly refers to <em>final </em>decisions of the district courts. Sun does not press the point strongly. The scope of review of this court under section 211(b)(2) is properly restrained by the same policy considerations that accrue to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291 jurisprudence. As Justice Frankfurter has written:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"A-lc\">Finality as a condition of review is an historic characteristic of federal appellate procedure. It was written into the first Judiciary Act and has been departed from only when observance of it would practically defeat the right to any review at all. Since the right to a judgment from more than one court is a matter of grace and not a necessary ingredient of justice, Congress from the very beginning has, by forbidding piecemeal disposition on appeal of what for practical purposes is a single controversy, set itself against enfeebling judicial administration.

We see no reason to depart from the finality requirement as developed under section 1291.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b930-8\">. \u201c[B]y stating that Sun\u2019s claims will be dismissed if the Kansas court makes the temporary injunction permanent, the court below has held that the application of the temporary injunction to Sun does not deny it due process of law.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b930-15\">Reply Brief for Appellant 6.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
