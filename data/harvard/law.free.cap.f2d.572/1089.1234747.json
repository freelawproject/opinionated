In such capacity he was authorized under the provisions of Title 7, U.S.C.A. \u00b6 2017, <em>et seq. </em>and Regulations pursuant thereto, 7 CFR 272.1 <em>et seq., </em>to accept and redeem coupons under the food stamp program of the Department of Agriculture in accordance with such statutes enacted by Congress and the Regulations issued by such Department. His wife, appellant Molly (Mollie) Smith, worked for him as cashier in the store. She was an employee and did not own an interest in the L &amp; M Market.</p>\n<p id=\"b1150-19\">On October 29, 1973, Lester pleaded guilty and was convicted of the offense of knowingly acquiring and possessing food coupons at the L &amp; M Market in a manner not authorized by the Food Stamp Act of 1964, Title 7, U.S.C., \u00a7 2011 et seq., in exchange for merchandise, in violation of Title 7, U.S.C., \u00a7 2023(b) and was placed on probation for a period of one year. Molly was not a party to that proceeding and was not involved therein.</p>\n<p id=\"b1150-20\">Thereafter, the Department of Agriculture, acting through the Food and Nutrition Service (FNS) determined that the firm of Lester Smith, doing business as L &amp; M Market, was disqualified from the Food Stamp Program' for a period of one year because of his participation in six violative transactions described in a letter of charges <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1091\">*1091</page-number>issued by FNS on May 10, 1974.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Lester Smith then sought administrative review of the decision of the FNS under the provisions of 7 CFR 273.1 <em>et seq., </em>and, failing in this effort, sought judicial review under 7 CFR 273.10. Again, he was unsuccessful.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1151-4\">Lester Smith, d/b/a L &amp; M Market, was allowed under the Regulations to continue to accept food stamps during the pendency of his administrative and judicial reviews. Finally, when he had exhausted his administrative and judicial appeals, the FNS sought to implement and enforce its previous order disqualifying him from accepting food stamps for one year, beginning May 10,1976. This was accomplished by sending an agent to the L &amp; M Market to pick up the food stamp authorization card previously issued to Lester Smith d/b/a L &amp; M Market. When the agent arrived at the store, Lester was not there. His wife, Molly Smith, told the agent the authorization card had been lost. The agent then asked her to sign a statement to that effect. She signed the statement as a representative of Lester Smith. The statement was also signed by Lester Smith, who returned to the store while the agent was still there. The statement is as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1151-5\">\u201cSTATEMENT</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1151-6\">\u201cThis is to certify that I have lost, misplaced, or unintentionally destroyed United States Department of Agriculture Authorization Card No. 210851-8, which granted the right to accept Food Stamp Coupons for eligible foods in my store, L &amp; M GROCERY &amp; MARKET. 7501 NW 22 Avenue. Miami. Florida 33147.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1151-7\">\u201cAs the owner and/or duly authorized representative of this store, I wish to surrender and relinquish all the rights, privileges, and benefits granted by the above mentioned Authorization.

Lester Smith is the only person shown to be disqualified for one year, beginning M\u00e1y 10, 1976, from accepting food stamp coupons.</p>\n<p id=\"b1151-20\">While in the store, the agent remarked to Lester that he was only \u201cdoing his job,\u201d whereupon, Lester said, \u201cDon\u2019t worry about me. I have an ace in the hole.\u201d This statement by Lester becomes important when considered with subsequent events discussed below.</p>\n<p id=\"b1151-21\">On June 28, 1976, appellant Molly Smith obtained a charter from the State of Florida for a corporation known as Progressive Marketing Company, Incorporated, which was authorized, among other transactions, to operate grocery stores, markets, and other retail outlets. The charter shows that the corporation was to have 50 shares of capital stock without nominal or par value and was to have capital of $500. The charter shows further that Molly Smith had \u201cagreed to take\u201d 10 shares of stock, and that the 3 directors and officers were:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"ACuU\">Mollie Lee Smith, President</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AC4p\">Columbus Smith, Secretary/Treasurer</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"aja-dedup-0\">Rosa Bell Smith, Vice-president<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1151-22\">Lester Smith d/b/a L &amp; M Market executed and delivered a bill of sale to the corporation on June 28, 1976, whereby in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1092\">*1092</page-number>consideration of $10 and O G and VC<footnotemark>5</footnotemark>\n<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> he sold \u201cThe entire stock, inventory, and equipment of L &amp; M Market (inventory attached)\u201d to the corporation.</p>\n<p id=\"b1152-4\">The inventory attached to the bill of sale is dated 3-8-74, more than 2 years prior to the date of the bill of sale. It only lists various items of furniture and equipment, such as cases, freezers, cooler, shelving and counters. The stock of goods and merchandise on hand were not listed or mentioned in the inventory. The trade name, goodwill, and business of L &amp; M Market were not mentioned in the bill of sale or inventory-</p>\n<p id=\"b1152-5\">On June 29, 1976, appellant, Mollie Lee Smith, in her capacity as president, filed an application for the corporation with the FNS of the Department of Agriculture for authority to participate in the food stamp program at the same address and in the same building used and occupied by Lester Smith d/b/a L &amp; M Market.</p>\n<p id=\"b1152-6\">No food stamps were accepted at the store between May 10, 1976, and June 29, 1976, the date of the filing of the corporation\u2019s application. However, food stamps were accepted after June 29, 1976. Molly Smith testified that she thought the corporation was eligible to receive the coupons after it filed its application for authority to participate in the program.</p>\n<p id=\"b1152-7\">Lester and Molly Smith continued working in the store after the transfer to the corporation in the same manner as they had worked for Lester Smith d/b/a L &amp; M Market. There was no change in the appearance of the building. The old \u201cL &amp; M Market\u201d sign painted on the front of the building was not changed. Newspaper advertisements in the <em>Miami Times </em>of July 15 and July 31, 1976, which are in evidence, appeared in the name of \u201cL &amp; M Market.\u201d Both advertisements contained the statement \u201cWe accept Food Stamps\u201d and gave the address of the old L &amp; M Market.</p>\n<p id=\"b1152-8\">The FNS denied the application of the corporation on August 8, 1976, stating its reasons, in pertinent part, as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1152-12\">\u201cMrs. Mollie Lee Smith, President</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1152-13\">Progressive Marketing Co., Inc. d/b/a</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1152-14\">L &amp; M Grocery</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1152-15\">7501 N.W. 22nd Avenue</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1152-16\">Miami, Florida 33147</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1152-17\">Dear Mrs. Smith:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1152-18\">This is to notify you that your application for participation as an authorized retailer in the Food Stamp Program dated June 29, 1976, is denied. This determination is based on the fact that:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1152-19\">It is our finding that approval of your request for authorization to participate in the Food Stamp Program would not effectuate the purpose of the program. Although you state that your corporation has purchased L &amp; M Grocery, you have not provided a bill of sale to show that the store has changed ownership. Furthermore, L &amp; M Grocery, under the ownership of your husband, Lester Smith, was disqualified from the Food Stamp Program for a period of one year effective May 10, 1976, because of the participation of you and your husband in six violative transactions as outlined to your husband in our letter of charges of May 10, 1974. Therefore, we view your application as an attempt to circumvent the disqualification determined by the U. S. Department of Agriculture, and your application is denied.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1152-20\">After receiving this denial, the corporation requested administrative review and furnished the FNS with a copy of the above-described bill of sale and also an affidavit of Molly Smith dated June 29, 1976, that she was the sole stockholder of the corporation; that it had purchased the business formerly known as L &amp; M Grocery &amp; Market formerly owned by her husband, Lester Smith; and that Lester Smith had no interest in the corporation.</p>\n<p id=\"b1152-21\">In the meantime, Lester and Molly Smith continued to accept food stamps at the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1093\">*1093</page-number>store, notwithstanding the fact that the application of the corporation had been denied. Undercover agents of the FNS purchased items of merchandise at the store from Lester and Molly Smith with food stamps on September 14 and 16, October 19 and 20, and on November 11, 1976.</p>\n<p id=\"b1153-4\">Based on the foregoing purchases, the appellant, Lester Smith, was indicted on 5 counts of unlawfully accepting food stamps, and appellant, Molly Smith, on 3 counts of unlawfully accepting food stamps, all in violation of Title 7, U.S.C., \u00a7 2023(b). The appellants were tried together before a jury. At the close of the evidence, and after hearing the court\u2019s charge and argument of counsel, the jury returned a verdict of guilty with respect to Lester Smith on counts 1, 3, 5, and 8, and not guilty as to count 6. With respect to Molly Smith, the jury returned a verdict of guilty as to count 2, and not guilty as to counts 4 and 7. Whereupon, the court sentenced Lester Smith to one year confinement on counts 1, 3, 5, and 8, to run concurrently, with confinement of 3 months in a jail-type institution and the remainder of the sentence suspended, and after discharge he was to be placed on probation for 2 years. The court withheld a sentence of confinement of Molly Smith as to count 2 and placed her on probation for 2 years. Both Lester and Molly Smith appealed their convictions to this court.</p>\n<p id=\"b1153-12\">Each of the counts in the indictment as to both appellants are alike and charge that on a designated date one or the other appellant (naming him or her) did knowingly, wilfully and unlawfully accept, acquire, and possess food coupons (issued by the Food and Nutrition Service of the Department of Agriculture) of a value less than $100.00, in a manner not authorized by the Food Stamp Act of 1964, Title 7, United States Code, Section 2011, <em>et seq., </em>or the regulations issued pursuant to said Act by accepting $40.00 in Food Stamp Coupons from a Special Agent of the United States Department of Agriculture in exchange for merchandise after having previously been lawfully disqualified from participation in the Food Stamp Program for a period of one year commencing May 10, 1976; all in violation of Title 7, United States Code, Section 2023(b)<footnotemark>6</footnotemark>.</p>\n<p id=\"b1153-13\">As pointed out above, prior to October 29, 1973, when Lester Smith pleaded guilty to a charge of violating the Food Stamp Act of 1964, he had made application to the FNS for authority to participate in the food stamp program and was granted such authority as Lester Smith d/b/a L &amp; M Market in accordance with Title 7, U.S.C., \u00a7 2017 and the Regulations pursuant thereto.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1154-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1094\">*1094</page-number>On May 10, 1976, he was disqualified from further participation in the food stamp program under the authority of Title 7. U.S.C., \u00a7 2020 and the Regulations issued thereunder.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1154-5\">During oral argument before us, counsel for the Government contended that authority to participate in the food stamp program is granted to a \u201cretail food store,\u201d namely, a physical building structure and not to a person or other legal entity. He made the same argument as to the disqualification of a \u201cretail food store.\u201d We do not agree. Section 2017, <em>supra, </em>requires that a person or other legal entity must file an application for authorization to participate in the program, and, in connection therewith, must furnish certain information. Obviously, this could not be done by a building, but must be done by the person or firm doing business in the building. The Regulations are even clearer in this regard than the Statutes. Such Regulations refer to applicants as \u201cfirms.\u201d<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1154-15\">The Regulations also refer to retail food stores as \u201cfirms\u201d in connection with their disqualification to participate further in the program and with reference to requests for review. See 7 CFR 272.6 and 7 CFR 273.-5.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1155-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1095\">*1095</page-number>We hold that the term \u201cretail food store\u201d in the Statutes and Regulations involved here means the owner and operator of a firm doing a retail food business in a building at a designated location, whether the owner is a sole proprietorship, a partnership, a corporation, or some other legal entity.</p>\n<p id=\"b1155-5\">Applying these principles to the instant case we conclude that the retail food store involved here was Lester Smith doing business as L &amp; M Market as sole proprietor, in a building located at the designated address. In such capacity, he alone was authorized to participate in the food stamp program. He alone pleaded guilty to the charge of violating the Pood Stamp Act in 1973 and by reason thereof he alone was disqualified from participating in the program as L &amp; M Market for one year beginning May 10, 1976.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1156-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1096\">*1096</page-number>We now reach the question of whether or not the convictions and sentences of the appellants should be affirmed. We consider first the case against Lester Smith.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> There is no question about the fact that he was disqualified for one year beginning May 10, 1976, from accepting food stamps as the owner and sole proprietor of L &amp; M Market. It is also undisputed that he accepted food stamps in the L &amp; M Market building during the year of his disqualification on the dates alleged in the indictment. The only question is whether he accepted the food stamps in the capacity of Lester Smith d/b/a L &amp; M Market or in the capacity of an employee of Progressive Marketing Company, Incorporated. There is sufficient evidence, though it is not overwhelming, to support a belief and finding by the jury beyond a reasonable doubt that the transfer of the L &amp; M Market to the corporation was not an arm\u2019s length transaction, but was Lester Smith\u2019s \u201cace in the hole,\u201d and was a sham and a subterfuge to avoid Lester Smith\u2019s disqualification. The FNS so stated in its letter of August 8, 1976, quoted above, in which it denied the application of the corporation. In that letter, which was introduced into evidence by the appellants, the FNS stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1156-4\">\u201c_ - - (W)e view your application as an attempt to circumvent the disqualification determined by the U. S. Department of Agriculture. ...\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1156-6\">The pertinent facts surrounding the transfer of L &amp; M Market to the corporation are fully described above and will not be repeated here. The jury could have concluded that the transfer was not a bona fide transaction, though the Government\u2019s case could have been stronger in that regard. Under such circumstances, the transfer was a nullity as far as this case is concerned and the continued operation of the store after the alleged transfer must be deemed to have been by the owner Lester Smith d/b/a L &amp; M Market. Therefore, the jury correctly found him guilty of violating the Food Stamp Act of 1964 as charged in counts 1, 3, 5 and 8 of the indictment. His conviction and sentence should be affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b1156-10\">The case against Molly Smith is quite different to that against Lester Smith. It will be recalled that she was not the owner of L &amp; M Market and had never been authorized or qualified to participate in the food stamp program. She was not disqualified for a period of one year from participation in the food stamp program, nor for any other period of time, as she had never been a participant in the program. She worked as an employee of Lester Smith d/b/a L &amp; M Market in the L &amp; M Market building. Yet she was indicted and found guilty as to count 2 of the indictment which charged:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1156-11\">\u201cCOUNT II</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1156-12\">On or about September 16, 1976, at Miami, Florida, in the Southern District of Florida, the defendant, MOLLY SMITH, did knowingly, wilfully and unlawfully accept, acquire and possess food coupons (issued by the Food and Nutrition Service of the United States Department of Agriculture) of a value less than $100.00, in a manner not authorized by the Food Stamp Act of 1964, Title 7, United States Code, Section 2011, <em>et seq., </em>or the regulations issued pursuant to said Act by accepting $38.00 in Food Stamp Coupons from a Special Agent of the United States Department of Agriculture in exchange for merchandise after having previously been lawfully disqualified from participation in the Food Stamp Program for a period of one year commencing May 10, 1976; all in violation of Title 7, United States Code, Section 2023(b).\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1156-13\">As may be seen from the indictment, Molly Smith was charged with unlawfully accepting food coupons \u201cin a manner not authorized by the Food Stamp Act of 1964,\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1097\">*1097</page-number><em>\u201cby accepting </em>$38.00 in food stamp coupons in exchange for merchandise <em>after having previously been lawfully disqualified from participation in the Food Stamp Program for a period of one year commencing May 10, 1976.\u201d </em>(Emphasis supplied.)</p>\n<p id=\"b1157-5\">There was no evidence that Molly Smith was ever disqualified from participation in the food stamp program for a period of one year as charged in the indictment. The signing of the statement regarding the lost authorization card by her in a representative capacity was not enough to disqualify her for one year along with Lester Smith. The district attorney argued that this part of the indictment was surplusage and that Molly Smith could be convicted on the words \u201cin a manner not authorized by the Food Stamp Act of 1964\u201d in the indictment. We do not agree. This would amount to taking the words out of context. The main thrust of the indictment and the gravamen of the charge was accepting food stamps during a disqualification period. The indictment was specific on this point. It described and detailed the \u201cmanner not authorized\u201d when it said \u201cby accepting\u201d the coupons during a one-year period of disqualification. It was incumbent on the prosecution to prove the allegations in the indictment beyond a reasonable doubt. It wholly failed to do so. The trial court should have granted Molly Smith\u2019s motion for acquittal. Her conviction and sentence must be set aside and the case against her dismissed.</p>\n<p id=\"b1157-6\">Accordingly, we affirm the judgment of conviction and sentence of Lester Smith. We set aside and vacate the judgment of conviction and sentence of Molly Smith and remand that part of the case to the trial court with instructions to dismiss the case against her.</p>\n<p id=\"b1157-7\">AFFIRMED in part and REVERSED in part.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1151-10\">.

Such authorization card shall be retained by the firm until superseded, surrendered, or revoked as provided in this part.</p>\n<p id=\"b1154-21\">(f) FNS shall deny the application of any firm if it determines that such firm\u2019s participation will not effectuate the purposes of the program. FNS will not consider the participation of a retail food store as effectuating the purposes of the program unless its food sales include staple foods for home preparation which are most needed in the diets of eligible households. If FNS determines that a firm does not qualify for participation in the program, a notice to that effect shall be issued to the firm. Such notice shall be delivered by certified mail or personal service. If such firm is aggrieved by such action, it may seek administrative review of such action as provided in \u00a7 272.8.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"10\">\n<p id=\"b1154-22\">. \u201c\u00a7 272.6 Disqualification of retail food stores, meal services and wholesale food concerns.</p>\n<p id=\"b1154-23\">(a) Any authorized retail food store, authorized meal service, or authorized wholesale food concern may be disqualified from further participation in the program by FNS for a reasonable period of time, not to exceed three years, as FNS may determine, if such firm fails to comply with the Food Stamp Act or the provisions of this part; except that, if the disqualification is based on failure of such firm to pay a monetary claim determined by FNS pur<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1095\">*1095</page-number>suant to \u00a7 272.7, such disqualification may be continued until such claim is paid.
