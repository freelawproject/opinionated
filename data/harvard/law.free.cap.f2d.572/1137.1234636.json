The main thrust of defendant\u2019s argument centers on whether information supplied to federal agents by an agent of the Florida Board of Pharmacy, which information is statutorily prohibited from use in a Florida criminal prosecution, may be used to furnish the probable cause necessary to support a federal search warrant. We do not reach this question. With the challenged information excised from the warrant application, enough facts were furnished the magistrate to support the administrative search warrant under the lesser standard of statutory probable cause required for such searches, a constitutionally permissible standard under <em>United States v. Biswell, </em>406 U.S. 311, 92 S.Ct. 1593, 32 L.Ed.2d 87 (1972). We therefore affirm the conviction.</p>\n<p id=\"b1198-17\">Defendant Schiffman was convicted in a nonjury trial for conspiracy to possess and distribute controlled drugs and distribution of controlled drugs, and for furnishing false information in records required by law to be kept. 21 U.S.C.A. \u00a7\u00a7 841(a)(1), 843(a)(4).</p>\n<p id=\"b1198-18\">The events leading to defendant\u2019s conviction began on April 7, 1976, when officers of the Hialeah, Florida, Police Department arrested Michael Borka for the sale of certain controlled drugs (Seconal and Dexod-rine). The drugs were still in the manufacturer\u2019s original 1000-count bottles, which contained the manufacturer\u2019s lot numbers. The police found manufacturer\u2019s bottles for other drugs (Tuinal) in Borka\u2019s apartment. The police department contacted the Federal Drug Enforcement Administration Compliance Section. Borka told the police and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1139\">*1139</page-number>DEA Agent Corbitt that the ultimate source of his drugs was a man who owned a pharmacy and planned to buy another.</p>\n<p id=\"b1199-5\">DEA Agent Corbitt then began an investigation of Borka\u2019s pharmaceutical bottles. From the lot number, he traced two Tuinal bottles to the manufacturer, Lilly, Inc. From Lilly, Corbitt learned the names of the four wholesale distributors in Miami to whom the drugs had been shipped only one month before Borka\u2019s arrest. Agent Cor-bitt went to these four distributors to determine which retail outlets had purchased the drugs. He learned that only seven of approximately 400 local pharmacies had purchased that drug within the requisite time frame. Of those seven, he was able to determine that the drugs were probably 'coming from one of two pharmacies, Sharon Drugs or Washington Pharmacy. His investigation focused on Sharon Drugs, defendant\u2019s pharmacy, when he inadvertently learned during a separate investigation that the owner of Sharon Drugs owned a second pharmacy and was going to purchase a third. This information tied in with Bor-ka\u2019s description of his ultimate source.</p>\n<p id=\"b1199-6\">On April 23, 1976, pursuant to 21 U.S. C.A. \u00a7 873 and standard DEA policy, which both call for cooperation with local authorities, Corbitt informed Agent Vernon Bell of the Florida Board of Pharmacy of his investigation. Bell agreed with Corbitt that Sharon Drugs was the most likely suspect, since he thought that Washington Pharmacy could handle the quantity of drugs it was buying in the regular course of its business, while Sharon Drugs could not.</p>\n<p id=\"b1199-7\">That same afternoon, Bell went to Sharon Drugs and examined defendant\u2019s records, as he is allowed to do under the Florida law regulating pharmacists. Fla.Stat. Ann. \u00a7 465.131 (West Supp.1976). Bell informed Corbitt that Sharon Drugs could not account for a large amount of the drugs it had purchased.</p>\n<p id=\"b1199-8\">Corbitt then applied for and obtained an administrative search warrant from a federal magistrate. After being presented with the warrant and read his <em>Miranda </em>rights, Schiffman executed a waiver of rights form and gave an oral and written statement to Corbitt in which he admitted his guilt. Corbitt conducted an inventory and accounting, deducting the prescriptions written from the amounts purchased. The investigation showed that over 90% of defendant\u2019s drug purchases were unaccounted for.</p>\n<p id=\"b1199-10\">Defendant moved to suppress the \u201cfruits\u201d of the search, including his admission and the trial testimony of a witness allegedly discovered because of defendant\u2019s statements. Denying the motion to suppress, the district court found defendant guilty on all three counts. Defendant appeals solely on the ground that the court erred in denying the motion to suppress.</p>\n<p id=\"b1199-11\">Defendant argues that the information furnished to federal agent Corbitt by state agent Bell could not be used to supply probable cause for the search warrant. Florida Statute \u00a7 465.131 authorizes the Florida Board of Pharmacy to conduct warrantless inspections of pharmacies within Florida. The Supreme Court of Florida has held that information obtained from warrantless inspections under that section cannot be used to aid criminal prosecutions under Florida\u2019s drug laws. <em>Olson v. State, </em>287 So.2d 313 (Fla.1973). Before we need decide what use federal authorities may make of information received from the Florida Board of Pharmacy, we must first determine whether the information from state agent Bell was necessary to the validity of the federal warrant. This Court has previously held that even though the application for a search warrant may contain prohibited information, if the other facts set forth in the application would sustain the warrant, its issuance will not be condemned. <em>See United States v. Hunt, </em>496 F.2d 888, 894-895 (5th Cir. 1974).</p>\n<p id=\"b1199-12\">\n<em>Probable Cause Under \u00a7 880(d)</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b1199-13\">The warrant here was issued under 21 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 880(d) of the Federal Drug Abuse Prevention and Control Act of 1970. This section permits the judicial issuance of warrants for administrative inspections, and seizures appropriate to such inspections, on a showing of probable cause. The Act <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1140\">*1140</page-number>defines probable cause differently from that which the courts have required for fourth amendment search warrants.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1200-4\">For the purposes of this section, the term \u201cprobable cause\u201d means a valid public interest in the effective enforcement of this subchapter or regulations thereunder sufficient to justify administrative inspections of the area, premises, building, or conveyance, or contents thereof, in the circumstances specified in the application for the warrant.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1200-5\">21 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 880(d)(1).</p>\n<p id=\"b1200-6\">The initial inquiry is whether the warrant application, with the information provided by the state agent excised, provides sufficient facts to satisfy this statutory standard of probable cause. The critical paragraph of the application, after reciting that Sharon Drugs was registered as a retail pharmacy with the DEA, recited:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1200-7\">2. The establishment has not been previously inspected by the Drug Enforcement Administration. Probable cause does exist, because the registrant\u2019s purchasing records (Federal Order Forms) indicates large purchases of Schedule II drugs, (Tuinal 200 mg and Tuinal 100 mg) <em>which a State investigation, initiated on April 23, 1976 was unable to account for either by the firm\u2019s dispensing records or inventory.</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1200-8\">The italicized words are those to be eliminated from consideration of the validity of the application. The application then stated that this is a \u201cscheduled inspection undertaken as a part of a statutorily authorized inspection program designated to assure compliance with the Comprehensive Drug Abuse Prevention and Control Act of 1970</p>\n<p id=\"b1200-9\">The test is whether these facts show \u201cprobable cause,\u201d defined as a valid public interest sufficient to justify an administrative search of the premises.</p>\n<p id=\"b1200-10\">The precise question is whether large purchases of controlled drugs by a registered retail pharmacy alone create such a valid public interest. We hold that they do.</p>\n<p id=\"b1200-11\">The Comprehensive Drug Abuse Prevention and Control Act of 1970 was enacted to provide a system for the control of drug traffic and to prevent the abuse of drugs. Congress recognized that many controlled drugs have \u201ca useful and legitimate medical purpose,\u201d but that, at the same time, improper use of these and other drugs has a detrimental effect on people\u2019s health. <em>See </em>21 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 801(l)-(2). The statutory scheme envisioned by the Act is one of control through registration of and record-keeping by all those within the \u201clegitimate distribution chain,\u201d and prohibition of transactions outside the legitimate distribution chain. <em>See </em>[1970] U.S.Code Cong. &amp; Admin.News 4566, 4569. All those who manufacture, distribute or dispense any controlled substance must be registered with the Attorney General. 21 U.S.C.A. \u00a7\u00a7 822-823. Registrants are required to keep certain records, which must be made available for inspection. <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 827. The statute informs registrants the Government is authorized to inspect their establishments in accordance with the rules and regulations promulgated under the statute. <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 822(f). Thus, a potential registrant is put on notice that, as a condition of engaging in the manufacture or distribution of drugs, he subjects himself to the regulatory system imposed by the Act including administrative inspections by the DEA as authorized by \u00a7 880.</p>\n<p id=\"b1200-13\">With this general program of control, Congress then provided for administrative inspections upon a showing of probable cause defined as \u201ca valid public interest in the effective enforcement of this subchap-ter or regulations thereunder sufficient to justify administrative inspections . in the circumstances specified in the application for the warrant.\u201d 21 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 880(d)(1).</p>\n<p id=\"b1200-14\">Two cases have held that the quantity of drugs purchased satisfies this probable cause requirement. In <em>United States v. Greenberg, </em>334 F.Supp. 364, 367 (W.D.Pa. 1971), a district court found the valid public interest met by the \u201csuspicious actions\u201d in the registrant\u2019s purchases of \u201cextraordinary quantities\u201d of drugs. In <em>United States v. Montrom, </em>345 F.Supp. 1337 (E.D.Pa.1972), <em>aff\u2019d without opinion, </em>480 F.2d 918, 919 (3d Cir. 1973), the court found that a valid <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1141\">*1141</page-number>public interest was established by allegations of the registrant\u2019s \u201cmammoth purchases.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1201-4\">Defendant Schiffman would contend there is a difference between \u201cextraordinary\u201d and \u201cmammoth\u201d purchases and \u201clarge\u201d purchases. There is no meaningful distinction between allegations of \u201cextraordinary,\u201d \u201cmammoth,\u201d and \u201clarge\u201d purchases. All three words are essentially synonymous, employed in a comparative sense to show that the registrant was purchasing a sufficient quantity of drugs to be of concern in the enforcement of the Act.</p>\n<p id=\"b1201-5\">Defendant contends that the warrant application in no way shows that \u201clarge\u201d purchases might not have been normal for the particular pharmacy. A pharmacy might have large purchases simply because it is a large store with a high volume of business. We need not decide whether an allegation of apparently normal but nonetheless large purchases would justify the issuance of a warrant. A fair reading of the present application is that Agent Corbitt was using the word \u201clarge\u201d in its comparative sense, i. e., larger than would be expected of that type pharmacy, and that the magistrate understood it as such. Corbitt\u2019s testimony at the motion to suppress tends to confirm this. He stated that a 1000-unit bottle would be \u201can unusual purchase\u201d for most pharmacies, and that his investigation of the distributor\u2019s records \u201cindicated to [Corbitt] that the pharmacy was purchasing more drugs than it could legitimately dispose of.\u201d Search warrant applications are to be interpreted in a commonsense and realistic fashion. <em>United States v. Ventresca, </em>380 U.S. 102, 108, 85 S.Ct. 741, 13 L.Ed.2d 684 (1965). Giving the words a commonsense interpretation, the application sets forth sufficient facts to establish statutory probable cause.</p>\n<p id=\"b1201-6\">Although this Court has never reached the issue and we do not reach it here, several courts have held that there is a \u201cvalid public interest\u201d in ensuring compliance with the recordkeeping requirements of the Act, and that a warrant may be issued simply because a substantial period of time has passed since the last inspection. <em>United States v, Goldfine, </em>538 F.2d 815, 818-819 (9th Cir. 1976);. <em>United States v. Prendergast, </em>436 F.Supp. 931, 932 (W.D.Pa. 1977); <em>United States v. Greenberg, </em>334 F.Supp. 364, 367 (W.D.Pa.1971). Support for this position can be found in <em>Camara v. Municipal Court, </em>387 U.S. 523, 87 S.Ct. 1727, 18 L.Ed.2d 930 (1967). The Supreme Court there said that probable cause to inspect would exist if reasonable legislative or administrative standards for conducting an inspection are satisfied, and that such standards could \u201cbe based upon the passage of time.\u201d 387 U.S. at 538, 87 S.Ct. at 1736. DEA regulations say it is the intent of the agency to conduct inspections of distributors of controlled substances once every three years. 21 C.F.R. \u00a7 1316.13 (1977). In the present ease, the warrant application alleged that defendant\u2019s pharmacy was registered under the Act and had never previously been inspected.</p>\n<p id=\"b1201-8\">\n<em>Constitutionality of \u00a7 880(d) Probable Cause</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b1201-9\">The \u201cvalid public interest\u201d standard of probable cause established by \u00a7 880(d)(1), although clearly less stringent than the probable cause required for the constitutional issuance of a criminal search or arrest warrant by <em>Spinelli </em>v. <em>United States, </em>393 U.S. 410, 89 S.Ct. 584, 21 L.Ed.2d 637 (1969), and <em>Aguilar v. Texas, </em>378 U.S. 108, 84 S.Ct. 1509, 12 L.Ed.2d 723 (1964), nevertheless is constitutional under the Supreme Court\u2019s administrative search cases.</p>\n<p id=\"b1201-10\">The warrant provisions of \u00a7 880 were inserted in the Act. in response to <em>Camara v. Municipal Court, </em>387 U.S. 523, 87 S.Ct. 1727, 18 L.Ed.2d 930 (1967), and <em>See v. City of Seattle, </em>387 U.S. 541, 87 S.Ct. 1737, 18 L.Ed.2d 943 (1967). <em>See </em>[1970] U.S.Code Cong. &amp; Admin.News 4566, 4623. In those cases, the Court held that a warrant is needed for administrative fire, health, and housing inspections of residences and businesses, but that the standard of probable cause in such situations would be a \u201cflexible standard of reasonableness.\u201d In <em>See, </em>the Court reserved decision on the constitutionality of licensing statutes which authorized warrantless inspections. 387 U.S. 546, 87 S.Ct. 1737.</p>\n<p id=\"b1202-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1142\">*1142</page-number>In <em>Colonnade Catering Corp. v. United States, </em>397 U.S. 72, 90 S.Ct. 774, 25 L.Ed.2d 60 (1970), the Supreme Court suggested an answer to the question it had reserved in <em>See. </em>The Court indicated that Congress could authorize warrantless inspections of liquor dealers because of the history of regulation of the liquor industry, \u201clong subject to close supervision and inspection.\u201d 397 U.S. at 77, 90 S.Ct. at 777. It found, however, that the relevant statute did not authorize forcible entries without a warrant.</p>\n<p id=\"b1202-4\">In <em>United States v. Biswell, </em>406 U.S. 311, 92 S.Ct. 1593, 32 L.Ed.2d 87 (1972), the Court upheld warrantless inspections of dealers in firearms under the Gun Control Act of 1968. The Court noted that federal regulation of interstate traffic in firearms is \u201cnot as deeply rooted in history as is governmental control of the liquor industry,\u201d but that federal regulation was still important. 406 U.S. at 315, 92 S.Ct. at 1596. The Court deemed inspection \u201ca crucial part of the regulatory scheme,\u201d since it assures that weapons are distributed through \u201cregular channels,\u201d and prevents sales to \u201cundesirables.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 315-316, 92 S.Ct. at 1596. The Court noted that the inspection scheme poses only a limited threat to the dealer\u2019s justifiable expectation of privacy, because the statute informs him of the scope and purpose of the inspections, and when the dealer \u201cchooses to engage in this pervasively regulated business and to accept a federal license,\u201d he does so knowing that his business will be subject to inspection. <em>Id. </em>at 316, 92 S.Ct. at 1596. The Court held that under this situation Congress could constitutionally authorize warrantless regulatory inspections so long as they are carefully limited in time, place, and scope.</p>\n<p id=\"b1202-5\">The pharmaceutical industry is a \u201cpervasively regulated business\u201d like the liquor and gun industries. <em>United States v. Mon-trom, </em>345 F.Supp. 1337, 1340 (E.D.Pa.1972), <em>aff\u2019d without opinion, </em>480 F.2d 918, 919 (3d Cir. 1973). Dealers in drugs, like dealers in firearms, are required to be federally licensed. The dealer accepts the license knowing that \u00a7 880 authorizes inspection of his business. Inspections are essential to the federal regulatory scheme to ensure that drugs are distributed only through \u201cregular channels\u201d and not diverted to illegal uses.</p>\n<p id=\"b1202-7\">The inspections pose only a limited invasion of the dealer\u2019s privacy interest, since the statute limits them in time, place, and scope. The inspection may be made only during normal business hours. \u00a7 880(d)(2). The inspection may only be of \u201ccontrolled premises,\u201d defined as places where controlled substance or records required by the Act are kept. \u00a7 880(a)(1). The inspectors may only inspect controlled substances, equipment used in handling those drugs, required records, and other documents needed to verify the records. \u00a7 880(b)(1). Other limitations are contained in \u00a7 880(d)(l)-(4). These restrictions have been found to satisfy <em>Biswell. United States v. Montrom, </em>345 F.Supp. 1337, 1340-1342 (E.D.Pa.1972), <em>aff\u2019d without opinion, </em>480 F.2d 918, 919 (3d Cir. 1973). <em>See also United States ex rel. Terraciano v. Montanye, </em>493 F.2d 682, 683 (2d Cir.) (in upholding New York\u2019s warrantless drug inspection statute, the court suggested that New York consider amending its statute to incorporate the safeguards found in 21 U.S. C.A. \u00a7 880), <em>cert. denied, </em>419 U.S. 875, 95 S.Ct. 137, 42 L.Ed.2d 114 (1974).</p>\n<p id=\"b1202-8\">The warrant requirement of \u00a7 880 provides registrants with less protection than a requirement of <em>Aguilar-Spinelli </em>probable cause, but it provides more protection than a registrant would have if warrantless inspections had been authorized, which the cases indicate might be constitutional.</p>\n<p id=\"b1202-9\">The \u201cvalid public interest\u201d language of \u00a7 880 follows the definition of probable cause for an administrative search warrant suggested by the Supreme Court\u2019s opinion in <em>Camara v.
