It appeals from an interlocutory order denying its motion to dismiss for lack of <em>in personam </em>jurisdiction.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The plaintiffs in the action are Edy Clover Productions, Inc., a New Jersey corporation doing business in New Jersey, and its president Marc Goodman, a New Jersey resident. The complaint alleges that a game show named \u201cThe Magnificent Marble Machine,\u201d broadcast by the National Broadcasting Company, Inc. (NBC), from a New York transmitter to television receivers in New Jersey, infringes a copyrighted television script owned by the plaintiffs. The affidavits on file establish that Heatter-Quigley produced the allegedly infringing series in California and furnished it to NBC, knowing that it would be so broadcast. We affirm the order of the district court.</p>\n<p id=\"b180-18\">It is clear that a state has an interest in protecting its residents from interstate transmissions which infringe their copyrights. The state has, therefore, an interest in providing a forum. It is also clear that a producer of a television program, who knows that the production will be transmitted interstate, can anticipate that infringement may result at places re<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"121\">*121</page-number>mote from the place of production. There is, therefore, no unfairness in requiring the producer to answer such a charge in the state in which it arises. <em>See Empire Abrasive Equipment Corp. v. H. H. Watson, Inc., </em>567 F.2d 554 (3d Cir. 1977).</p>\n<p id=\"b181-5\">The order appealed from will be affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b180-19\">. The case is before us pursuant to a certificate under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1292(b).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
