WRIGHT, Circuit Judge:</author>\n<p id=\"b288-18\">A jury found appellant guilty of conspiring to import heroin and conspiring to possess it with intent to distribute. He argues on appeal that the trial judge erred in admitting in evidence a quantity of heroin and an altered automobile gasoline tank, both of which were seized in warrantless searches. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b288-19\">FACTS:</p>\n<p id=\"b288-20\">On December 15, 1975, agents of the Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) arrested appellant and a co-conspirator, Bowen, as they sat in a 1975 Cadillac in a parking lot in Arizona. Bowen had been driving the Cadillac and Johnson had been driving a 1969 Chevrolet, parked nearby.</p>\n<p id=\"b288-21\">After the two were arrested, DEA agents searched both cars and found approximately five kilograms of heroin in a tennis bag and suitcase in the Cadillac\u2019s trunk. Appellant\u2019s driver\u2019s license was in a pair of trousers in the suitcase. An initial inventory search of the Chevrolet produced no drugs.</p>\n<p id=\"b288-22\">The vehicles were seized for forfeiture, 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 881 and 49 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 781 and 782,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"229\">*229</page-number>and removed to a government facility for safekeeping.</p>\n<p id=\"b289-5\">Bowen and Johnson were convicted of possession of heroin with intent to distribute and this court upheld the legality of their arrests and the initial searches and seizures. <em>United States </em>v. <em>Bowen and Johnson, </em>Nos. 76-2369 &amp; 76-2484, unpub. memorandum (9th Cir. Feb. 8, 1977), <em>cert. denied, </em>431 U.S. 957, 97 S.Ct. 2680, 53 L.Ed.2d 274 (1977).</p>\n<p id=\"b289-6\">In the two weeks following the vehicle seizures, DEA agents received numerous inquiries about the Chevrolet from Johnson and his attorney. At a hearing on December 29, 1975, DEA Agent Murphy was asked repeatedly whether drugs had been found in the Chevrolet. Being curious that so much interest was displayed in that vehicle, Murphy ordered the DEA\u2019s evidence technician, Walquist, to make a second, more exhaustive search of it.</p>\n<p id=\"b289-7\">On December 29 and 30, Walquist performed a search, without a warrant, to see if contraband had been hidden in the vehicle.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The search was exceptionally thorough<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> and resulted in the discovery of an altered gasoline tank containing a package with five more kilograms of heroin.</p>\n<p id=\"b289-14\">After photographing the car, the tank, and the heroin, the agents replaced the drugs with dummy packages filled with a non-narcotic substance. They replaced the fuel tank and, with a magistrate\u2019s approval, affixed an electronic tracking device to the underside of the vehicle.</p>\n<p id=\"b289-15\">Rather than proceeding with a forfeiture action, the government released the car to Johnson on January 13, 1976, and agents followed him and the radio beacon as he drove from Arizona to Los Angeles. They lost contact in heavy traffic, but eventually located the Chevrolet in a locked, \u201ctenants only\u201d garage beneath an apartment house. The agents could see the front of the parked car from the street through the garage gate.</p>\n<p id=\"b289-16\">A lock on the gate to which only building tenants had keys, limited access to the garage from outside the building. There also was access to the garage from the building lobby through an unlocked door, but the entry door from the street to the lobby was equipped with locks. Television surveillance equipment monitored the lobby.</p>\n<p id=\"b289-17\">Without a warrant,<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> one agent found the door to the lobby unlocked and walked <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"230\">*230</page-number>through to the garage. Other agents waited until a tenant activated the garage gate and then followed his car inside. The agents found the altered fuel tank against a wall behind the car. The dummy drug packets were gone.</p>\n<p id=\"b290-4\">At trial, the government introduced ten kilograms of heroin, the photographs of the car and its contents, and the altered fuel tank. Johnson\u2019s motions to suppress the evidence obtained in the course of the war-rantless searches of December 29 and 30, and January 13 were denied.</p>\n<p id=\"b290-5\">THE DECEMBER 29 SEARCH:</p>\n<p id=\"b290-6\">The parties recognize that, since the seizure for forfeiture was legal,<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> we must look for guidance to the Supreme Court\u2019s decision in <em>Cooper v. California, </em>386 U.S. 58, 87 S.Ct. 788, 17 L.Ed.2d 730 (1967).</p>\n<p id=\"b290-7\">In <em>Cooper </em>the Court considered a search of a car impounded under state forfeiture statutes analogous to the federal statutes in this case. <em>Cooper </em>held admissible the evidence seized from an automobile glove compartment during a warrantless search one week after the defendant\u2019s arrest and the car\u2019s seizure.</p>\n<p id=\"b290-8\">The rationale of <em>Cooper </em>is unclear.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> The search was not incident to arrest, nor was it undertaken in light of exigencies giving rise to the traditional \u201cautomobile exception\u201d to the Fourth Amendment\u2019s general search warrant requirement.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> It is debatable whether the <em>Cooper </em>search was validated because it was a noninvestigatory inventory or because agents of the government, with lawful possession of the vehicle pending forfeiture, had the right to search it at will. <em>Compare Chambers v. Maroney, </em>399 U.S. 42, 49 n.7, 90 S.Ct. 1975, 26 L.Ed.2d 419 (1970), <em>with South Dakota v. Opperman, </em>428 U.S. 364, 369, 96 S.Ct. 3092, 49 L.Ed.2d 1000 (1976). <em>See also Cady v. Dombrowski, </em>413 U.S. 433, 452-53, 93 S.Ct. 2523, 37 L.Ed.2d 706 (1973) (Brennan, J., dissenting).</p>\n<p id=\"b290-13\">The language in <em>Cooper </em>leaves room for disagreement. Cognizant of the fact that \u201clawful custody of an automobile does not of itself dispense with constitutional requirements of searches thereafter made of it,\u201d 386 U.S. at 61, 87 S.Ct. at 791, the Court explained that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b290-14\">[h]ere the officers seized the petitioner\u2019s car because they were required to do so by state law. They seized it because of the crime for which they arrested petitioner. They seized it to impound it and they had to keep it until forfeiture proceedings were concluded. Their subsequent search of the car \u2014 whether the State had \u201clegal title\u201d to it or not \u2014 was closely related to the reason petitioner was arrested, the reason his car had been impounded, and the reason it was being retained. The forfeiture of petitioner\u2019s car did not take place until over four months after it was lawfully seized. It would be unreasonable to hold that the police, having to retain the car in their custody for such a length of time, had no right, even for their own protection, to search it. It is no answer to say that the police could have obtained a search warrant, for \u201c[t]he relevant test is not whether it is reasonable to procure a search warrant, but whether the search was reasonable.\u201d <em>United States v. Rabi-</em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"231\">*231</page-number><em>nowitz, </em>339 U.S. 56, 66, 70 S.Ct. 430, 435, 94 L.Ed. 653 [1950].</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b291-5\">386 U.S. at 61-62, 87 S.Ct. at 791.</p>\n<p id=\"b291-6\">Appellant contends that <em>Cooper </em>approved a noninvestigatory inventory search aimed at protecting police during the period in which a seized vehicle must be held, and that it is untenable in light of subsequent Supreme Court opinions to argue that <em>Cooper </em>created a general exception to the search warrant requirement for vehicles seized for forfeiture. His position is supported by language in <em>Cooper </em>stating that it would be unreasonable to deny police the right to search the vehicle \u201ceven for their own protection,\u201d and it is reinforced by the Supreme Court\u2019s own subsequent characterization of <em>Cooper </em>as an inventory search case.</p>\n<p id=\"b291-7\">In <em>Cady v. Dombrowski, </em>413 U.S. 433, 93 S.Ct. 2523, 37 L.Ed.2d 706 (1973), the Court approved a warrantless search of a car removed from a highway accident scene and parked at a private garage. The Court reasoned that, because the driver\u2019s pistol may have remained within the vehicle and because the driver was himself unable to secure the car, the police search was justified. \u201c[T]he safety of the general public . might be endangered if an intruder removed a revolver from the trunk of the vehicle.\u201d 413 U.S. at 447, 93 S.Ct. at 2531. In relying on <em>Cooper, </em>the <em>Cady </em>majority described it as a case involving an inventory search conducted \u201cto guarantee the safety of the [vehicle\u2019s] custodians.\u201d 413 U.S. at 447, 93 S.Ct. at 2531.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b291-8\">Similarly, in <em>South Dakota v. Opperman, </em>428 U.S. 364, 96 S.Ct. 3092, 49 L.Ed.2d 1000 (1976), the Supreme Court approved an inventory search of a locked car, impounded for overtime parking, in which valuable items of personalty were visible. In the course of the inventory, officers- discovered drugs in the glove compartment. The Court upheld their admission because it considered police inventory searches reasonable when conducted pursuant to standard procedures in furtherance of \u201ccommunity care-taking functions.\u201d 428 U.S. at 368, 96 S.Ct. 3092.</p>\n<p id=\"b291-13\">The <em>Opperman </em>opinion supported its holding with three reasons: protection of the owner\u2019s property while in police custody, protection of police from disputes over lost or stolen property, and protection of police from potential danger. 428 U.S. at 369, 96 S.Ct. 3092. Describing <em>Cooper </em>as \u201cthe first\u201d inventory search case,<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> it understood that search to have been based on notions of police safety.</p>\n<p id=\"b291-14\">The court in <em>Opperman </em>thought automobiles distinguishable from places given more substantial Fourth Amendment protection because of the considerable noncriminal contact police have with automobiles, because automobiles are subject to extensive regulation, and because one\u2019s expectation of privacy as to his automobile is generally not high. 428 U.S. at 367-68, 96 S.Ct. 3092. However, the Court did note that, while local police often inventory cars as part of their everyday caretaking functions, \u201c[t]he contact with vehicles by federal law enforcement officers, usually, if not always, involves the detection or investigation of crimes unrelated to the operation of a vehicle.\u201d 428 U.S. at 369 n.4, 96 S.Ct. at 3097.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b292-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"232\">*232</page-number>Hence, the Supreme Court\u2019s post- <em>Cooper </em>decisions do support appellant\u2019s characterization of <em>Cooper\u2019s </em>holding as limited to inventory searches. Both the <em>Cady </em>and <em>Opperman </em>Courts emphasized that, on the facts before them, there was \u201cno suggestion whatever that this standard procedure, essentially like that followed throughout the country, was a pretext concealing an investigatory police motive.\u201d <em>South Dakota v. Opperman, </em>428 U.S. at 376, 96 S.Ct. at 3100, <em>citing Cady v. Dombrowski, supra.</em><footnotemark><em>11</em></footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b292-4\">Cases in this circuit also characterize <em>Cooper </em>as an inventory search case. <em>See, e. g., United States v. Jamerson, </em>549 F.2d 1263 (9th Cir. 1977). <em>Jamerson </em>involved an inventory search of a stolen car prior to its release to the owner. While acknowledging that <em>Cooper </em>referred to the authorities\u2019 lawful possession of the car, the panel termed that search an inventory and emphasized the police safety rationale supporting it. 549 F.2d at 1270.</p>\n<p id=\"b292-5\">The <em>Jamerson </em>panel expressly reserved the question \u201cwhether a warrantless search of the vehicle for evidence of the suspected crime after the car had been impounded would have been valid.\u201d 549 F.2d at 1265 n.l <em>(citing Cardwell v. Lewis, </em>417 U.S. 583, 94 S.Ct. 2464, 41 L.Ed.2d 325 (1974); <em>Cady v. Dombrowski, supra; </em>and <em>Chambers </em>v. <em>Maroney, </em>399 U.S. 42, 90 S.Ct. 1975, 26 L.Ed.2d 419 (1970)). Because <em>Jamerson </em>was an inventory search case and because of the cases cited by the panel we are led to conclude that the court did not concern itself with the searches of cars seized for forfeiture, but was instead commenting only on inventory and exigent circumstances justifications for warrantless automobile searches.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b292-13\">Nevertheless, panels in this circuit have adopted an expansive view of the <em>Cooper </em>holding when considering searches of cars seized for forfeiture. They have held that, once a vehicle is validly seized for forfeiture, a subsequent search of it is lawful. <em>See, e. g., United States v. Karp, </em>508 F.2d 1122, 1124 (9th Cir. 1974), <em>cert. denied, </em>422 U.S. 1007, 95 S.Ct. 2628, 45 L.Ed.2d 669 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"233\">*233</page-number>(1975) (dictum); <em>United States v. McCormick, </em>502 F.2d 281, 284 (9th Cir. 1974) (\u201cWe do not doubt that if the seizure of the car . was valid, the later search . was also valid.\u201d); <em>United States v. Arias, </em>453 F.2d 641, 643 (9th Cir. 1972).<footnotemark>13</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b293-5\">This interpretation of <em>Cooper </em>rests on the premise that government agents, having obtained possession by a lawful seizure under forfeiture statutes, may search a vehicle at will. The interpretation springs from extraneous language in <em>Cooper </em>which seems to have approved the search because it was \u201cclosely related to the reason petitioner was arrested, the reason his car had been impounded, and the reason it was being retained.\u201d 386 U.S. at 61, 87 S.Ct. at 791.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b293-6\">This interpretation is well illustrated by <em>United States v. Arias, supra. </em>In <em>Arias </em>government agents lawfully seized a station wagon which they believed was used to facilitate the consummation of a crime involving contraband. After an initial search yielded nothing, the authorities subjected the vehicle to a \u201cmore thorough probe, pursuant to [forfeiture statutes] conducted at a federal facility.\u201d 453 F.2d at 642-43.</p>\n<p id=\"b293-13\">As in this case, the second search in <em>Arias </em>was intrusive, warrantless, and investigatory. Drugs were discovered in the car\u2019s rear quarter panel. With little discussion, the court approved the search after establishing that the vehicle had been properly seized for forfeiture under 49 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 781 and 782.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b293-14\">In <em>United States v. McCormick, supra, </em>this court limited earlier Ninth Circuit cases which upheld warrantless vehicle <em>seizures </em>pursuant to forfeiture statutes.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> It did <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"234\">*234</page-number>not, however, tamper with the rule that a lawful seizure validates a post-seizure investigatory search.<footnotemark>17</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b294-4\">This circuit is not alone in its interpretation of the law governing searches of lawfully seized vehicles. <em>See, e. g., United </em>States v. <em>Panebianco, </em>543 F.2d 447, 456 (2d Cir. 1976); <em>United States v. Zaicek, </em>519 F.2d 412, 414 (2d Cir. 1975); <em>United States v. La Vecchia, </em>513 F.2d 1210, 1215-16 (2d Cir. 1975); <em>United States v. Capra, </em>501 F.2d 267, 280 (2d Cir. 1974), cert. <em>denied, </em>420 U.S. 990, 95 S.Ct. 1424, 43 L.Ed.2d 670 (1975); <em>United States v. Shye, </em>473 F.2d 1061, 1065-66 (6th Cir. 1973); <em>United States v. Edge, </em>444 F.2d 1372, 1375 (7th Cir. 1971); <em>United States v. Stout, </em>434 F.2d 1264, 1267 (10th Cir. 1970); <em>United States v. Ortega, </em>471 F.2d 1350, 1360 (2d Cir. 1972), <em>cert. denied, </em>411 U.S. 948, 93 S.Ct. 1924, 36 L.Ed.2d 409 (1973).</p>\n<p id=\"b294-5\">Although we apply it, we recognize the rule\u2019s shortcomings. In effect, it allows a vehicle search to proceed once a valid seizure, with or without a warrant, has been accomplished.</p>\n<p id=\"b294-6\">The standard of probable cause to support a seizure for forfeiture is less precise and rigorous than that required to obtain a search warrant in ordinary circumstances.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b294-7\">If agents have probable cause to believe that a car is or has been used for carrying contraband, they may summarily seize it pursuant to the federal forfeiture statutes .</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b294-8\"><em>United States v. Capra, </em>501 F.2d at 280. <em>See also United States v. Arias, </em>453 F.2d at 643.</p>\n<p id=\"b294-12\">Indeed, a vehicle may be seized even in the absence of probable cause to believe it contains contraband if there is nonetheless probable cause to believe that it was used \u201cto facilitate the transfer of contraband.\u201d <em>United States v. La Vecchia, </em>513 F.2d at 1216.</p>\n<p id=\"b294-13\">In this case the circumstances of the seizure, coupled with appellant\u2019s post-seizure inquiries, would provide probable cause for the subsequent search, but there were no exigent circumstances justifying the search without a warrant. The car was in the custody of government agents with little danger of its being moved or tampered with during the time required to obtain a warrant. However, the propriety of the seizure of the Chevrolet has been established. Under our rule that a seizure for forfeiture makes subsequent searches reasonable, the search can be upheld.<footnotemark>18</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b294-14\">It is of no consequence that the government released the car to Johnson rather than proceeding with forfeiture for, when the vehicle was searched, it was in the custody of federal agents under the authority of forfeiture statutes. <em>Lockett v. United States, </em>390 F.2d 168, 172 (9th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>393 U.S. 877, 89 S.Ct. 175, 21 L.Ed.2d 149 (1968), <em>limited on other grounds, United States v. McCormick, </em>502 F.2d at 284. <em>See also United States v. La Vecchia, </em>513 F.2d at 1216.</p>\n<p id=\"b294-15\">The Supreme Court\u2019s reasoning in <em>Cady v. Dombrowski, supra, </em>and <em>South Dakota v. Opperman, supra, </em>lends some support to the argument that the rule goes too far.<footnotemark>19</footnotemark> But, because the law on this point is unclear, we <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"235\">*235</page-number>choose to follow Ninth Circuit precedent and that of several other circuits. The search of the Chevrolet on December 29 and 30, 1975 was proper.</p>\n<p id=\"b295-4\">THE JANUARY 13 GARAGE SEARCH:</p>\n<p id=\"b295-5\">Because the search of the seized Chevrolet was lawful, we need not consider the propriety of the apartment garage search. While that may have been improper, <em>see United States v. Hufford, </em>539 F.2d 32, 34 (9th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>429 U.S. 1002, 97 S.Ct. 533, 50 L.Ed.2d 614 (1976) (dictum), the evidence obtained clearly was cumulative.</p>\n<p id=\"b295-6\">If there was error on that point, it was harmless beyond a reasonable doubt in light of the other, overwhelming evidence of guilt. <em>Chapman v. California, </em>386 U.S. 18, 24, 87 S.Ct. 824, 17 L.Ed.2d 705 (1967); <em>United States </em>v. <em>Lopez </em>(slip op. 210) (9th Cir. January 23,1978).</p>\n<p id=\"b295-7\">CONCLUSION:</p>\n<p id=\"b295-8\">The judgment of the district court is affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b288-10\">. 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 881.

There is no contention that this was anything but an investigatory search. The vehicle had been inventoried after seizure and no contraband had been found. Had the evidence in question been uncovered during the noninvesti-gatory inventory, there would be little doubt of its admissibility. See <em>South Dakota v. Opper-man, </em>428 U.S. 364, 376, 96 S.Ct. 3092, 49 L.Ed.2d 1000.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b289-12\">. Walquist testified that on December 29 he received instructions to \u201cthoroughly go through the vehicle again to see if there may be some narcotics in it.\u201d He began at the front and checked \u201ceverything [he] could think that could possibly hold narcotics in the front of the vehicle.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b289-19\">He then searched the interior, removed the rocker panels, and checked beneath the floor and behind the seats. He combed the engine compartment as well and finally noticed traces of oil on the straps and bolts holding the fuel tank. Because these are normally dry and rusty, he determined to return the following day with additional tools and remove the fuel tank.</p>\n<p id=\"b289-20\">Walquist informed his superiors, then returned and removed the tank.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b289-21\">. Shortly after their arrival in Los Angeles, the agents informed an Assistant United States Attorney that they would apply for a warrant to search the residence into which Johnson was expected to take the dummy packets. At the time, they were not sure where that would be. Government counsel told them that she would not apply for such a warrant because she believed that such a search would be tainted by the earlier search of the impounded Chevrolet, which she considered illegal.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b290-9\">. The warrantless seizure of the Chevrolet was lawful because it was undertaken in the face of exigent circumstances. That issue was litigated in Johnson\u2019s previous appeal. Generally, warrantless seizures of vehicles are proper in certain, well-defined circumstances. <em>See United States v. McCormick, </em>502 F.2d 281, 285 (9th Cir. 1974), <em>applying Coolidge </em>v. <em>New Hampshire, </em>403 U.S. 443, 91 S.Ct. 2022, 29 L.Ed.2d 564 (1971). <em>See also </em>49 U.S.C. \u00a7 782, <em>quoted at n.1, supra.</em></p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b290-10\">.

See Note, Warrantless Searches and Seizures of Automobiles, 87 Harv.L.R. 835, 847 (1974) (criticizing the \u201cpolice protection\u201d justification for inventory searches). The \u201cpolice protection\u201d rationale has been criticized because seized vehicles are seldom dangerous instru-mentalities and because it might logically be extended to encompass searches far more intrusive than garden variety inventories.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"9\">\n<p id=\"b291-10\">. In <em>Cooper v. California, supra, </em>the Court upheld the inventory of a car impounded under the authority of a state forfeiture statute. Even though the inventory was conducted in a distinctly criminal setting and carried out a week after the car had been impounded, the Court nonetheless found that the car search, including examination of the glove compart- , ment where contraband was found, was reasonable under the circumstances.</p>\n<p id=\"b291-16\"><em>South Dakota v. Opperman, supra, </em>428 U.S. at 373, 96 S.Ct. at 3098 (footnote omitted).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"10\">\n<p id=\"b291-17\">. The <em>Opperman </em>Court explained that the constitutional search warrant requirement is linked to the need to establish probable cause before a search, which is unrelated to the reasons for police inventories. 428 U.S. at 370 n.5, 96 S.Ct. 3092. Justice Powell, concurring with the majority, emphasized that, in the con<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"232\">*232</page-number>text of inventory searches, there is no danger of hindsight evaluations of reasonableness and that officers conducting inventories exercise little discretion. 428 U.S. at 383, 96 S.Ct. 3092.</p>\n<p id=\"b292-7\">Warrantless investigatory searches of vehicles seized for forfeiture stand on a different footing. Government agents use great discretion in deciding whether to seize a car and whether to search it, and how extensive the search should be. Consideration of the search\u2019s propriety in these cases will necessarily involve \u201chindsight evaluation.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"11\">\n<p id=\"b292-8\">. The implication of this language may be that post-seizure investigatory searches can be made only pursuant to a warrant which lists the items sought and the places to be searched.</p>\n<p id=\"b292-9\">This interpretation is strengthened by <em>United States v. Chadwick, </em>433 U.S. 1, 97 S.Ct. 2476, 53 L.Ed.2d 538 (1977). The Court invalidated a warrantless search of a locked footlocker taken from an automobile trunk at the time of arrest and removed to a federal facility. The Court commented:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"ANGW\">Once the federal agents had seized [the footlocker] at the railroad station and had safely transferred it to the Boston federal building under their exclusive control, there was not the slightest danger that the footlocker could have been removed before a valid search warrant could be obtained.7</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b292-11\">7 This may often not be the case when automobiles are seized. Absolutely secure storage facilities may not be available, <em>see South Dakota v. Opperman, supra; Cady v. Dombrowski, supra, </em>and the size and inherent mobility of a vehicle makes it susceptible to theft or intrusion by vandals.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b292-15\">433 U.S. at 13, 97 S.Ct. at 2484.</p>\n<p id=\"b292-16\">The reference to searches of seized vehicles cites two recent inventory search cases, emphasizing the reasons for permitting those searches. Neither the references nor the reasoning applies to investigatory searches of automobiles seized for forfeiture. Here, Johnson\u2019s car had been placed in a government facility at a military installation for safekeeping. The possibility that it would be disturbed by thieves or vandals was remote.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"12\">\n<p id=\"b292-17\">. <em>Cady v. Dombrowski, supra, </em>was an inventory search case. <em>Cardwell v. Lewis, supra </em>and <em>Chambers v.

Dicta in a few Supreme Court opinions indicate that some members of the Court may understand the justification for the search in <em>Cooper </em>to have been the possessory interest of the authorities, arising from the lawful seizure of the vehicle. <em>See, e. g., Chambers v.

In <em>Cooper v. California, </em>386 U.S. 58, [87 S.Ct. 788, 17 L.Ed.2d 730] (1967), the Court upheld the warrantless search of an automobile after it had been lawfully impounded pursuant to a California statute mandating the seizure and forfeiture of any vehicle used to facilitate the possession or transportation of narcotics. There, however, <em>the police were authorized to treat the car in their custody as if it were their own, and the search was sustainable as an integral part of their right of retention. </em>(Emphasis supplied.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b293-11\">Justice Powell, concurring in <em>South Dakota v.

Although the <em>Arias </em>panel did not cite <em>Cooper, </em>it based its holding on two Ninth Circuit cases, one of which relied on <em>Cooper. Lockett v.

Because the search of the seized Chevrolet was legal, we need not consider whether admission of the heroin found on December 30 or the pictures of the car and its altered fuel tank might be harmless error.

Its consequences can be far-reaching. In <em>United States v.
