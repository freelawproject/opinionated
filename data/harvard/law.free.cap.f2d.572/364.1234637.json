Haight, Jr., <em>J., </em>directing a verdict for defendant shipowner, Royal Netherlands Steamship Company, in this negligence action brought under 33 U.S.C. \u00a7 905(b). Examination of the record indicates that the district judge removed from the jury\u2019s consideration an issue of fact presented by ambiguous testimony. Since this was error, we must reverse for a new trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b425-17\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b425-18\">The facts are in large part undisputed and, with the exception already referred to, are admirably set forth in the trial judge\u2019s memorandum opinion granting judgment to defendant. We therefore state the facts briefly, reserving fuller discussion for what we regard as the crucial issue. Plaintiff was injured on December 27, 1972, while loading greasy drums of tallow in the hold of defendant\u2019s vessel. Plaintiff was employed by Northeast Stevedoring Company, which was performing stevedoring duties for defendant Royal. While loading a second tier of drums upon the first tier, plaintiff allegedly slipped on the greasy drums and fell. The theory of plaintiff\u2019s case was that his fall was caused by the absence of dunnage (pieces of rough lumber or plywood), which was supposed to be supplied by defendant. The insufficiency of dunnage had become apparent during the course of the work and had been called to the attention of Willie Joe Ashley, plaintiff\u2019s hatch boss, and Pete Spano, a stevedore foreman and Ashley\u2019s immediate superior. Both Ashley and Spano were employed by Northeast Stevedoring Company. They, in turn, called the problem to the attention of a ship\u2019s officer, since the dun-nage was supplied by the ship.</p>\n<p id=\"b425-19\">At this point, although only plaintiff and Ashley testified, the parties disagree as to what the record indicates next occurred. In his written opinion, the judge viewed the evidence as showing that the ship\u2019s officer advised Spano and Ashley, in substance,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"ajv-dedup-0\">that those in charge of the vessel were aware of the need for more dunnage; that more dunnage had in fact been sent for; and that the longshoremen should <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"366\">*366</page-number>hold off on working in the hold until the additional dunnage arrived.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b426-4\">As will be seen below, plaintiff characterizes this version of the facts as unwarranted. It is undisputed, however, that Spano told Ashley that the men in the hold should not be kept idle, should continue to work and \u201cdo the best they can,\u201d that Ashley relayed these instructions to plaintiff and his colleagues, and that thereafter plaintiff slipped and fell. On this theory of the facts, the judge directed a verdict for defendant at the end of plaintiff\u2019s case. This appeal followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b426-5\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b426-6\">Plaintiff sues under the 1972 amendments to the Longshoremen\u2019s and Harbor Workers\u2019 Compensation Act, which produced significant changes in the law governing remedies for longshoremen injured on their jobs. The amendments relevant here have been fully discussed in several recent decisions of this court, e. g., <em>Munoz v. Flota Merchante Grancolombiana, S.A., </em>2 Cir., 553 F.2d 837, 839-41 (1977); <em>Landon v. Lief Hoegh and Co., Inc., </em>2 Cir., 521 F.2d 756, 762-63 (1975), cert. denied, 423 U.S. 1053, 96 S.Ct. 783, 46 L.Ed.2d 642 (1976), and need not be extensively examined again. It is enough for our purpose to recognize, as the parties do, that a longshoreman may still recover for damages caused by the negligence of a shipowner, 33 U.S.C. \u00a7 905(b),<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> and that \u201cCongress suggested land-based principles of negligence as the standard of care for vessels boarded by dock workers.\u201d <em>Napoli v. Hellenic Lines, Ltd., </em>536 F.2d 505, 507 (2d Cir. 1976).</p>\n<p id=\"b426-10\">Carrying out that congressional intent, we held in <em>Napoli </em>that the standard for determining the liability of a ship to a longshoreman, who had fallen from unsecured plywood boards on a load of drums, was found in Section 343A of the Restatement of Torts, reproduced in the margin.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Since there was evidence in that case from which a jury might conclude that the shipowner had \u201cnotice of an obviously dangerous condition\u201d and that \u201cthe ship should reasonably have anticipated that Napoli would not be able to avoid the danger despite its .obviousness,\u201d id. at 509, we reversed for a new trial and a proper charge.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Still more recently, however, we emphasized that under \u201cland-based principles ... a shipowner cannot be held liable for a dangerous condition created by an independent stevedore unless he has actual or constructive knowledge that the condition exists.\u201d See <em>Ruffino v. Scindia Steam Navigation Co., Ltd., </em>559 F.2d 861, 862 (2 Cir. 1977). Accord: <em>Munoz v. Flota Merchante Grancolombiana, S.A., </em>supra; <em>Bess v. Agromar Line, </em>518 F.2d 738 (4th Cir. 1975).</p>\n<p id=\"b426-11\">We turn now to apply these principles to this case. As indicated above, it is undisputed that a ship\u2019s officer was notified of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"367\">*367</page-number>the shortage of dunnage, that the ship acknowledged its responsibility to supply dun-nage, and that at the time of the accident, it was attempting to do so. The trial judge, however, ruled as a matter of law that the ship \u201chad no reason to anticipate that the longshoremen would not await the additional dunnage . . .\u201d Appellant argues that on the record before the judge, this conclusion was unwarranted.</p>\n<p id=\"b427-6\">The key support for plaintiff came from his hatch boss, Ashley. The latter testified, in substance, that when the men in the work gang noticed that they needed dunnage, he spoke to someone on the ship, whom he identified as an officer. In the course of his testimony, Ashley first apparently quoted the officer as follows: \u201c[T]hey said we had wait and do the best we can until it [the dunnage] arrive.\u201d Then, becoming more specific, Ashley testified that the officer said: \u201cWe had to do the best we can until we get something that we could work with.\u201d The trial judge then asked the witness, \u201cWho said that?\u201d and Ashley replied: \u201cThis was come from the stevedore and the ship. We couldn\u2019t keep the 18 men standing by doing nothing until the plywood arrived.\u201d Ashley then testified that in the following hour, he saw the same officer walking \u201cback and forth on the ship constantly.\u201d It is true that in other parts of his direct testimony, Ashley quoted the ship\u2019s officer as stating merely that \u201cthey had ordered [the dunnage] and they had to wait for it.\u201d And in Ashley\u2019s cross-examination, a similar direction to Spano, Ashley\u2019s superior, was attributed to the ship\u2019s officer. This helps to explain why the trial judge viewed the evidence as supporting defendant rather than plaintiff. Thus, in several places in his opinion, the judge referred to the shipowner\u2019s \u201csuggestion\u201d that the men hold off working until the dunnage arrived. This characterization of the officer\u2019s statement was the basis of the judge\u2019s holding that the ship could not reasonably apprehend that work might continue and an injury occur.</p>\n<p id=\"b427-9\">However, as the above analysis of the record indicates, the evidence could have been interpreted differently. Even though the record was sparse and the testimony supporting plaintiff on this issue was ambiguous and unimpressive, it was enough to allow a jury to conclude that the ship\u2019s officer approved and joined in the direction that the men keep working, although the dunnage was not there. Had a jury so found, it might also have concluded, as we said in <em>Napoli, </em>\u201cthat the ship should reasonably have anticipated that [plaintiff] would not be able to avoid the danger despite its obviousness.\u201d 536 F.2d at 509. It is as true here, as it was in that case, that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b427-10\">. it might be argued that if this was the only place for . . [plaintiff] to work and carry out his job, the vessel might reasonably anticipate that he would use it despite its obvious danger, since the only alternatives would be to leave his job or face trouble for delaying the work. Should the jury be persuaded by this argument and find that the shipowner was negligent in not correcting the open and obvious danger but that the plaintiff was contributorily negligent, if would apply the doctrine of comparative negligence to reduce the shipowner\u2019s liability proportionately.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b427-12\">Id.</p>\n<p id=\"b427-13\">We do not know what the true facts are or what more probing examination at a new trial may obtain from the same witnesses or from others, like Spano, who did not testify. If the evidence shows only that a ship\u2019s officer told the longshoreman to stop working until the dunnage arrived, thereby fulfilling the ship\u2019s duty to the longshoreman, there would be no case for the jury. But if there is again evidence that a ship\u2019s officer, after being notified of the open and obvious danger of insufficient dunnage for a slippery cargo, had the men keep working or joined in the stevedore\u2019s decision to do so, then there would be a jury question.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b428-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"368\">*368</page-number>Judgment reversed and case remanded for a new trial.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b426-7\">. Section 905(b) provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b426-8\"><em>In the event of injury to a person covered under this chapter caused by the negligence of a vessel, then such person, or anyone otherwise entitled to recover damages by reason thereof, may bring an action against such vessel as a third party in accordance with the provisions of section 933 of this title </em>and the employer shall not be liable to the vessel for such damages directly or indirectly and any agreements or warranties to the contrary shall be void.

We do not agree with our dissenting brother\u2019s attempt to overrule <em>Napoli v. Hellenic Lines, Ltd., </em>536 F.2d 505 (2d Cir. 1976), nor with his analysis of <em>Munoz v. Flota Merchante Granco-</em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"368\">*368</page-number><em>lombiana, S. A., </em>553 F.2d 837 (2d Cir. 1977); we believe that the precedents he cites from other circuits are not relevant here. Even more significantly, not one of the many cases cited in the lengthy dissenting opinion states that a shipowner cannot be held negligent under the new law, when the shipowner both had knowledge of an open and obvious danger and also affirmatively joined in a stevedore\u2019s decision to keep the longshoremen working nonetheless.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b428-4\">MOORE, Circuit Judge</author>\n<p id=\"ava-dedup-0\">(dissenting):</p>\n<p id=\"b428-5\">The fallacy of the majority opinion is to be found in the last sentence thereof, namely, \u201cBut if there is again evidence that a ship\u2019s officer, after being notified of the open and obvious danger of insufficient dunnage for a slippery cargo, had the men keep working or joined in the stevedore\u2019s decision to do so, then there would be a jury question.\u201d The fallacy is that an order by a ship\u2019s officer to a stevedore in whose hands had been placed the exclusive control of the loading operation, and who had exclusive authority to direct its employees as to when and under what conditions they should work with respect to awaiting the arrival of additional dunnage and continuing work in the meantime under conditions known to stevedore and shipowner alike to be dangerous, placed negligence liability on the shipowner rather than on the stevedore whose employee was injured.</p>\n<p id=\"b428-6\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b428-7\">FACTS</p>\n<p id=\"b428-8\">Before a trial judge is faulted for an error it is well to consider the facts and the applicable law upon which he made his decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b428-9\">Plaintiff, Mario Lubrano, was a longshoreman employed by a stevedoring company, Northeast Stevedoring Company (\u201cNortheast\u201d). Northeast had been engaged by the shipowner, Royal Netherlands Steamship Company (\u201cRoyal\u201d) to load cargo into its ship, the \u201cS. S. CHIRON\u201d. Lubrano was Northeast\u2019s employee, hence was covered by Northeast\u2019s compensation insurance. Northeast was an independent contractor and had complete charge of, and responsibility for, the loading operation.</p>\n<p id=\"b428-11\">The cargo being loaded by Lubrano\u2019s gang consisted of metal drums containing tallow. The drums were slippery. Some dunnage (wooden boards) was supplied by the' shipowner as was its responsibility, but as the work progressed it became apparent to the stevedore that there was insufficient dunnage to cover the first tier of drums. The longshoremen called this deficiency to the attention of their boss, Willie Joe Ashley, who in turn so informed the stevedore\u2019s foreman, Spano. Ashley and Spano told one of the ship\u2019s officers of the necessity for more dunnage. Ashley was told that additional dunnage had been ordered and that \u201cyou had to wait until it arrived\u201d. (49a). The \u201cyou\u201d is clarified by Ashley\u2019s testimony. In answer to the question \u201cWho told you that you had to wait?\u201d he said, \u201cWell, the stevedore says that the ship\u2014 that the Dutch had ordered the lumber and it hadn\u2019t arrived so we had to continue working until it gets there. * * * When I say wait I don\u2019t mean that he said that we should stop work. We had to do the best we can until it got there\u201d. (50a). To make identification even more certain that it was the stevedore who gave the orders, there ensued the following:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b428-12\">\u201cQ. This was the stevedore who told you that?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b428-13\">A. Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b428-14\">Q. Who was the stevedore on that ship that day, which foreman?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b428-15\">A. Pete Spano.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b428-16\">Q. Petey Spano said to you, in about these words, that the ship had ordered the dunnage, you had to wait a while till the dunnage came, but meantime the men should continue working and do the best they could under the circumstances?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b428-17\">A. Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b428-18\">Q. Of course, Petey Spano was your boss, is that right?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b428-19\">A. That\u2019s right.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b428-20\">Q. So he having said that to you, you did what he told you to do, as best you could, right, you relayed the same in<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"369\">*369</page-number>structions to the men in the hold, they had to do the best they could, \u2018Keep working, do the best you can, those are the orders,\u2019 is that right?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b429-5\">A. That\u2019s right.\u201d (50a-51a)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b429-6\">However, Ashley had previously testified that when he had asked for more dunnage he was told (presumably by a ship\u2019s officer): \u201cWe [the stevedore] had to do the best we can until we get something we could work with.\u201d (42a).</p>\n<p id=\"b429-7\">Thereafter Lubrano was injured when he slipped on a greasy drum not covered by dunnage.</p>\n<p id=\"b429-8\">I find no basis in the record for the majority\u2019s conclusion that the shipowner, through an officer, had interjected itself into supervising the stevedoring operation by giving orders that the stevedore should continue to work on the drums despite absence of dunnage [it was Spano who told Ashley to do the best \u201cthey could under the circumstances\u201d]. The most that can be said for the words \u201cwe had to continue working until it gets there\u201d is that they constituted advice to the stevedore to keep working. However, this was not an order from someone in charge of the loading operation, and it was the stevedore\u2019s sole responsibility thereafter to direct its employees how, where and under what circumstances they were to continue to work. Even assuming an officer had said that the work should continue, this statement cannot be regarded as an attempt to take the stevedore\u2019s control of the loading operation and of its own employees out of its hands.</p>\n<p id=\"b429-9\">The focal point of error in the majority opinion is to be found in its contrary-to-fact assumption, which in turn is contrary to the law, that if there is evidence that a ship\u2019s officer \u201chad the men keep working or joined in the stevedore\u2019s decision to do so, then there would be a jury question\u201d.</p>\n<p id=\"b429-12\">The factual error is the assumption that the shipowner retained the power to direct the stevedore's employees after having given the stevedore, as an independent contractor, complete control over the loading operation. The error as a matter of law is in holding that a shipowner, having so relinquished the control to the independent contractor, must stand by to countermand the stevedore\u2019s directions lest it be charged with joining in. The law, as evidenced in the 1972 Amendments to the LHWCA and the many cases decided since the Amendments, is to the contrary.</p>\n<p id=\"b429-13\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b429-14\">LEGISLATIVE INTENT</p>\n<p id=\"b429-15\">Despite Congressional intent in enacting the 1972 Amendments to the LHWCA<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> thereby (1) to give substantially increased benefits to injured longshoremen and (2) to clarify the legal situation created by the so-called <em>Sieracki-Ryan </em>cases, the holding of the court today takes the law a long step backward toward the strict liability doctrine of yesteryear.</p>\n<p id=\"b429-16\">Under <em>Seas Shipping Co., Inc. v. Sieracki, 328 </em>U.S. 85, 66 S.Ct. 872, 90 L.Ed. 1099 (1946), by court-created law, the doctrine of strict liability to seamen was extended to longshoremen upon a theory of unseaworthiness.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> And shipowners were held to be liable for unseaworthy conditions even if the unseaworthiness was caused by the independent stevedore, rather than the vessel or a member of the vessel\u2019s crew. Some years later and possibly to ameliorate the result of this situation, it was held in <em>Ryan Stevedoring Co., Inc. v. Pan Atlantic S. S. Corp., 350 </em>U.S. 124, 76 S.Ct. 232, 100 L.Ed. 133 (1956), that the shipowner could recover from the stevedore damages for which it was liable, on the theory that the stevedore <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"370\">*370</page-number>had breached its implied warranty of workmanlike performance to the vessel.</p>\n<p id=\"b430-4\">The background and the necessity for the 1972 legislation cannot be more concisely or better stated than by Chief Judge Kaufman within the year in <em>Munoz </em>v. <em>Flota Mer-chante Grancolombiana, S. A., </em>553 F.2d 837 (2d Cir. 1977), who said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b430-5\">\u201cIn an effort to bring order out of chaos, Congress amended the Longshoremen\u2019s and Harbor Workers\u2019 Compensation Act (LHWCA) in 1972 to clarify and limit the circumstances under which the employee of a stevedore could recover damages from a shipowner for on-the-job accidents.\u201d 553 F.2d at 838.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b430-6\">* # * * * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b430-7\">\u201c . . . Congress, by its extensive overhaul of the LHWCA in 1972, sought to achieve several goals: adequate, increased and sure compensation for injured longshoremen, elimination of the rubric of liability without fault for shipowners, and encouragement of safety within the industry by placing the duty of care on the party best able to prevent accidents.\u201d 553 F.2d at 839.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b430-12\">The 1972 legislation was to remedy \u201cthe anomalous situation [which] arose in which the stevedore, whose participation in a workmen\u2019s compensation scheme precluded direct actions for negligence by his employees, became liable, nevertheless, in a court of law for the very injury that the compensation system was designed to remedy.\u201d 553 F.2d at 839-40.</p>\n<p id=\"b430-13\">Placing a high potential liability on either the shipowner or stevedore was not unjustified because the LHWCA then limited longshoremen\u2019s compensation to a maximum of $70 per week.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> However, a major concern was that the initial liability was on the wrong party \u2014 the shipowner was strictly liable for accidents where it had little or no control over the actual operations. Also, the administrative costs of high legal fees and burdens on the courts created a system that was in dire need of reform in 1972.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> The ultimate decision reached by Congress was not made lightly. Instead, the result reflects a delicate balancing by Congress of the interests of the various parties involved. The longshoremen received increased benefits, the shipowners are liable only if negligent, and the stevedore does not face the <em>Ryan </em>secondary suit.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b431-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"371\">*371</page-number>In analyzing the basis for the legislation, due consideration must be given to the express aim of Congress to force employers (stevedores) to be more responsive to safety considerations in their work.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> The stevedore has the primary responsibility to avoid accidents. <em>Riddle </em>v. <em>Exxon Transportation Company, </em>563 F.2d 1103 (4th Cir. 1977); <em>Marant v. Farrell Lines, Inc., </em>550 F.2d 142, 144 (3rd Cir. 1977); <em>Lucas v. \u201cBrinknes\u201d Schiffahrts Ges., </em>379 F.Supp. 759, 768-69 (E.D.Pa.1974); <em>Ramirez v. Toko Kaiun K. K., </em>385 F.Supp. 644, 653 (N.D.Calif.1974). The stevedore is in the best position to avoid the costs and causes of accidents, and on its shoulders rests the primary responsibility for the safety of longshoremen. Such responsibility is consistent with the promotion of safe working conditions and economic efficiency. The stevedore is also the party best able to spread the cost of accidents through insurance or through higher charges for work performed.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> <em>See generally, </em>G. Calabresi, <em>The Costs of Accidents </em>(1970).</p>\n<p id=\"b431-13\">Congress intended that the LHWCA should be applied uniformly nation-wide, and comparative negligence would apply, while assumption of risk would not apply, to longshoremen.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> Also, Congress intended <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"372\">*372</page-number>the application of negligence law to be based on land-based principles.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> The application, by analogy, of land-based principles does not require courts to develop rules of law for interpretation of the LHWCA which are identical to land-based tort law. To the contrary, land-based concepts must be used to fashion rules applicable to maritime situations and reflecting Congressional intent.</p>\n<p id=\"b432-4\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b432-5\">COURT INTERPRETATIONS</p>\n<p id=\"b432-6\">Courts have looked to the Restatement (Second) of Torts for guidance in formulating the land-based principles of negligence law. This circuit and other circuits have followed the modern rule of law provided by \u00a7 343A of the Restatement.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> However, \u00a7 343A must be read in light of the intent of Congress in enacting the 1972 Amendments. The basic rule found in \u00a7 343A is that no liability will arise for obvious defects, and is based on notions of assumption of risk.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> The escape clause provided in the last phrase of \u00a7 343A(l) is expressly designed to avoid in traditional tort situations the harsh consequences of assumption of risk and contributory negligence. The doctrine of assumption of risk is specifically excluded from LHWCA actions, and comparative negligence, not contributory negligence, is applied. Furthermore, in a land-based tort action, one who is held liable can receive contribution from another concurrent tortfeasor, while the LHWCA precludes contribution from the stevedore tort-feasor. In short, the special characteristics of the LHWCA preclude unthinking adherence to \u00a7 343A alone or to a literal reading thereof.</p>\n<p id=\"b432-11\">Section 343A also must be read together with \u00a7 409 of the Restatement. In fact, \u00a7 409 dealing specifically with \u201cIndependent Contractors\u201d should be the more applicable section. Section 409 states: \u201cExcept as stated in \u00a7\u00a7 410-29, the employer of an independent contractor is not liable for physical harm caused to another by an act or omission of the contractor or his servants\u201d. Restatement (Second) of Torts, \u00a7 409 (1965). Under this section, with certain exceptions, the landowner is not liable <em>per se </em>for the negligent acts of an independent contractor.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> \u201cIf \u00a7\u00a7 343-43A were applied to create a duty in the shipowner to apprise himself of, to warn the longshoremen of and to protect them [from] dangerous features of the independent contractor\u2019s \u2014i. e., the stevedore\u2019s \u2014 activity then the Restatement sections dealing with employer control of the activity of independent con<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"373\">*373</page-number>tractors, \u00a7\u00a7 409-26 would be rendered nugatory with respect to landowners-shipowners.\u201d <em>Hurst v. Triad Shipping Co., </em>554 F.2d 1237, 1249-50 n. 35 (3d Cir. 1977).<footnotemark>13</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b433-6\">When analyzed, prior cases, in this circuit and others, are consistent with the view that a longshoreman\u2019s claim against the shipowner normally should not be permitted when the ship has relinquished control of the operation which led to the injury. <em>See Ruffino v. Scindia Steam Navigation Co., Ltd., </em>559 F.2d 861 (2d Cir. 1977) and <em>Munoz v. Flota Merchante Grancolombiana, S. A., </em>553 F.2d 837 (2d Cir. 1977). In the present case, appellant argues that the exception of \u00a7 414 of the Restatement applies.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> However, there is no proof in the record of the retention of any control by the shipowner or facts from which any reference thereof might be drawn. Appellant contends that at any time the CHIRON\u2019s crew could have ordered the work halted, and that Royal breached a duty of reasonable care to ensure that the work was performed properly, but the appellant presented no evidence indicating that the crew of the CHIRON participated in, controlled or even had a right to control the operative functions of loading. The facts establish the contrary.</p>\n<p id=\"az2-dedup-0\">The stevedore was an expert in loading and unloading operations. Royal could reasonably expect that Northeast, which \u201cwas in a far better position than the shipowner to avoid the accident\u201d, would use its expert knowledge \u201cto adopt preventive measures and thereby to reduce the likelihood of injury\u201d. <em>Italia Societa v. Oregon Stevedoring Co., </em>376 U.S. 315, 323, 324, 84 S.Ct. 748, 753, 754,11 L.Ed.2d 732 (1964). The handling of tallow drums is the type of task that is within the expert competence of the stevedore.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> The court in <em>Slaughter v. S. S. Ronde, </em>390 F.Supp. 637 (S.D.Ga.1974), <em>affirmed, </em>509 F.2d 973 (5th Cir. 1975), noted that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b433-11\">\u201cit has also been held that \u2018The physical handling of an ordinary bale or bundle is the clearest example of a detail within the special competence and peculiar responsibility of the stevedoring contractor\u2019 and that such is \u2018clearly . . . not the province or responsibility of the ship\u2019.\u201d (Citation omitted) <em>Id. </em>at 645.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b433-13\">The stevedore can stop work, and has the responsibility to stop work, when dangerous conditions arise. The stevedore is also given the primary responsibility to comply with the mandatory requirements of the Safety and Health Regulations for Long-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"374\">*374</page-number>shoring, 29 C.F.R. 1918 <em>et seq.</em><footnotemark><em>16</em></footnotemark><em> </em>These regulations require that \u201c[sjlippery conditions shall be eliminated as they occur\u201d. 29 C.F.R. 1918.91(c). If the shipowner is to be liable only for negligence, it would be manifestly unfair to saddle the shipowner with unfortunate results which occurred after turning the work over to the stevedore. <em>Cf. Baum v. United States, </em>427 F.2d 215, 219 (5th Cir. 1970) (pre-amendments case where the shipowner was not in control of maintenance operations).</p>\n<p id=\"b434-4\">This court, in <em>Napoli v. Hellenic Lines, </em>536 F.2d 505 (2d Cir. 1976), addressed the problem of an obvious and dangerous condition, and, using the standard of \u00a7 343A, found the shipowner liable. However, <em>Napoli </em>is distinguishable on at least two important grounds.<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> First, the defect in <em>Napoli </em>was present when the stevedore began its duties. Here, the defect was not present when the longshoremen began work, but arose as the work progressed. Appellant argues that the danger was present when the work began because the failure to provide sufficient dunnage created a defect before loading began. However, no evidence in the record indicates that Royal created the danger by failing to provide dunnage. Merely turning over the CHI-RON without sufficient dunnage (a fact only developed during the stevedore\u2019s loading), did not create an open and obvious danger. The ship had some dunnage available when the work began, and Northeast did not even request more dunnage until after the work had well progressed. In spite of the request for more dunnage, the stevedore ordered the work to continue. The delay in providing dunnage resulted only in the slippery conditions continuing after they were initially created by the stevedore. The shipowner had no duty to supervise the stevedore to determine if conditions were safe for the longshoremen to continue work until that equipment should arrive.</p>\n<p id=\"b434-10\">Second, the shipowner in <em>Napoli </em>was acting as its own stevedore. The majority opinion glosses over this fact in a footnote, but the distinction is critically important. Because the shipowner acted as its own stevedore, <em>Napoli </em>did not involve consideration of \u00a7 409 which provides the standard of care for delegation of responsibility to the independent contractor, the stevedore.</p>\n<p id=\"b434-11\">One of the major premises behind the holding in <em>Napoli </em>is that when the shipowner acts as its own stevedore, the longshoremen cannot stop work when a dangerous condition arises which is the fault of the shipowner/stevedore.<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> If they did stop <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"375\">*375</page-number>work, the longshoremen might face dismissal. <em>Napoli, supra </em>at 509. When an independent contractor is the stevedore, the longshoremen can stop work without fear of losing their jobs. If a condition is found to be unsafe for the longshoremen, the stevedore can remedy the difficulty at the expense of the shipowner, and if the operations are delayed, the shipowner must normally pay for standby time. <em>See Ramirez v. Toko Kaiun K.K., </em>385 F.Supp. 644 (N.D. Cal.1974), <em>Hugev </em>v. <em>Dampskisaktieselskabet International, </em>170 F.Supp. 601 (S.D.Cal. 1959), <em>affirmed, </em>274 F.2d 875 (9th Cir. 1960).</p>\n<p id=\"b435-5\">In <em>Munoz, </em>this court cited the Fifth Circuit case of <em>Gay v. Ocean Transport </em>in distinguishing Napoli:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b435-6\">\u201c * * * We therefore prefer [to <em>Na-poli] </em>the guidance afforded by <em>Gay v. Ocean Transport &amp; Trading, </em>546 F.2d 1233 (5th Cir. 1977) where, in two related cases, the Fifth Circuit refused to hold a shipowner liable for injuries sustained by longshoremen as a direct result of their employers\u2019 negligence in failing properly to ventilate the hold and omitting adequately to secure pallets on the ship\u2019s deck. The Court recognized, as we do, that it would be inimical to the intent of Congress to charge the shipowner with the stevedore\u2019s wrong.\u201d (citations omitted) 553 F.2d at 841.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b435-8\">In <em>Munoz </em>the defect was latent, but in <em>Guerra v. Bulk Transport Corp., </em>the companion case to <em>Gay, </em>a longshoreman was injured when wooden pallets, stacked near a boom by the longshoremen, were struck by the boom and fell injuring plaintiff. The Fifth Circuit upheld the district court\u2019s determination that the shipowner was not negligent. The court stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b435-9\">\u201cEven though the crew of the vessel was aware of the dangerous condition presented by the stack of pallets, it was the stevedore who created the hazard in the first place and it was the stevedore that failed to tie the pallets down and then carelessly knocked one into the hold. This was not the type of danger that must be faced notwithstanding knowledge.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1242.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b435-12\">In applying \u00a7 343A, cases have found the shipowner not liable for obviously dangerous conditions, whether existing before control is relinquished to the stevedore or arising later with the knowledge of the shipowner, if the danger is such that the stevedore would be expected to correct the condition in discharging its responsibility, to the longshoremen and the condition is one where the shipowner could defer to the competence of the stevedore. <em>See Riddle v. Exxon Transportation Company, supra; Anuszewski v. Dynamic Mariners Corp., Panama, </em>540 F.2d 757 (4th Cir. 1976); <em>Fras-ca v. Prudential-Grace Lines, Inc., </em>394 F.Supp. 1092 (D.Md.1975). One commentator has explained these decisions:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b435-13\">\u201cThe consistent philosophy of these decisions is that in the ordinary situation shipowners are in no position to learn of unsafe conditions or methods arising during the stevedore\u2019s operations; when shipowners do learn of such dangers, ordinarily the stevedore and his employees will have an equal or greater awareness, so that the danger can be said to be open and obvious; and that the safety of stevedoring and other such operations is the primary and usually the sole responsibility of the stevedore.\u201d Robertson, \u201cNegligence Actions by Longshoremen Against Shipowners Under the 1972 Amendments to the Longshoremen\u2019s and Workers\u2019 Compensation Act\u201d, 7 Jour. of Mar. Law and Comm. 447, 473 (1976).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b435-14\">Here, the plaintiff and the other longshoremen did discover and realize the danger, as did their supervisors. The entire loading operation, having been put under the sole control of the stevedore, the shipowner was under no duty to countermand the stevedore\u2019s order nor even had a right <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"376\">*376</page-number>to do so. Furthermore, \u201cthe stevedore\u2019s employees were in a far better position to abate the danger than any of the members of the ship\u2019s crew\u201d. <em>Brown v. Mitsubishi Shintaku Ginko, </em>550 F.2d 331, 334 (5th Cir. 1977).</p>\n<p id=\"b436-4\">IV.</p>\n<p id=\"b436-5\">CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b436-6\">The stevedoring operation having been entrusted solely to the stevedore, it had the responsibility \u2014 not the ship \u2014 of observing the conditions of the loading as it progressed. It was Ashley [stevedore\u2019s employee] who saw that \u201cgrease is everyplace\u201d and that because of the grease \u201cthe men couldn\u2019t hold the drums sufficiently to really store them, it was unsafe\u201d. (42a). It was Ashley who said \u201cthe stevedore says that the ship \u2014 that the Dutch had ordered the lumber and it hadn\u2019t arrived so we had to continue working until it get there\u201d. (50a).</p>\n<p id=\"b436-7\">When, as here, the work was in the control of an independent stevedore, the condition arose as a result of the stevedore and longshoremen themselves, the shipowner had taken steps to provide the requested dunnage, and the stevedore ordered the loading operation to proceed, the district court committed no error in removing the case from the jury and directing a verdict. Holding the shipowner liable on a \u201cshould anticipate\u201d basis would allow the burden of safety to be shifted from the stevedore to the shipowner \u2014 a result not intended by Congress. The shipowner had no reason to anticipate, even taking the evidence most favorable to the plaintiff, that neither the stevedore nor the longshoremen themselves, would take sufficient measures to protect the longshoremen from slippery conditions, which they knew existed and which were a normal component of this type of loading operation.</p>\n<p id=\"b436-8\">A careful reading of the record discloses no fact upon which negligence by the shipowner, even by inference, could be based. The proof is clear, as found by the trial court, that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b436-9\">\u201c[t]here is no evidence whatsoever that those in charge of the vessel were pressuring the longshoremen to continue work without interruption, so that, for example, the vessel might sail with the tide or in accordance with a prearranged schedule. The decision to continue work, in the face of a known hazard, and despite the knowledge that the requested additional dunnage was on the way, was made by the stevedoring supervisors; and that decision was neither requested nor participated in by the defendant or its officers.\u201d (79a).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b436-10\">When the longshoremen discovered that the loading operation required more dun-nage, the shipowner set about to obtain it. As the trial court found,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b436-11\">\u201c[defendant had no reason to anticipate that the longshoremen would not await the additional dunnage, which would have enabled them to avoid the hazard; and there is no evidence that defendant\u2019s efforts to obtain more dunnage, in order to correct the danger, were less than they could have been in the circumstances.\u201d (footnote omitted) (81a).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b436-12\">Upon the facts presented in plaintiff\u2019s case, the trial court\u2019s conclusion is inescapable that \u201c[a] jury could not find for plaintiff on this state of the record without departing from the guiding principles of the statute.\u201d (footnote omitted) (81a).</p>\n<p id=\"b436-13\">For these reasons, I believe that the decision of the majority is contrary to the statute, the clearly-expressed intent of the Congress, the many decisions from the Third, Fourth, Fifth and Ninth Circuits, as well as the carefully considered decision of this court in Munoz: \u201cTo hold otherwise, in our view, risks return to the concept of liability without fault for shipowners, which Congress so emphatically and recently rejected\u201d. 553 F.2d at 841. In summary, in my opinion, the majority reached \u201ca result [which] would judicially revive the longshoremen\u2019s remedy for unseaworthiness, the very remedy that Congress repudiated through the 1972 Amendments to the Long<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"377\">*377</page-number>shoremen\u2019s and Harbor Workers\u2019 Compensation Act.\u201d<footnotemark>19</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b437-4\">Therefore, I would affirm.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b429-10\">.

The stevedore may balance the cost of accidents with the cost of instituting measures which will reduce accidents. By forcing stevedores to pay higher amounts of compensation to longshoremen under the 1972 Amendments, stevedores are forced to take into account the Congressionally determined cost of accidents. A stevedore will take precautions to reduce accidents to a point where the cost of reducing accidents in the form of additional safety measures equals the cost of accidents in terms of lost time and benefits which must be paid. The stevedore is then in a position to spread the cost of the compensation benefits or insurance through higher prices. The cost of stevedoring services will then reflect their true economic cost, including the cost of paying benefits to those injured on the job. Those stevedores who have worse safety records will have higher prices or will be forced to accept lower profits. Customer shipowners will tend to hire the relatively lower priced stevedores who have superi- or safety records.

It is not enough that he has merely a general right to order the work stopped or resumed, to inspect its progress or to receive reports, to make suggestions or recommendations which need not necessarily be followed, or to prescribe alterations and deviations. Such a general right is usually reserved to employers, but it does not mean that the contractor is controlled as to his methods of work, or as to operative detail. There must be such a retention of a right of supervision that the contractor is not entirely free to do the work in his own way.\u201d Restatement (Second) of Torts \u00a7 414, Comment c (1965).</p>\n<p id=\"b433-15\">In <em>Hurst v. Triad Shipping Co., supra, </em>the court rejected a \u00a7 414 argument for similar reasons. The court noted that in the few opinions holding the shipowner liable for injuries suffered because of improper stevedoring operations, the \u201cshipowners\u2019 participation in the operations is clear, direct, and of significant proportions.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1252 n. 38.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"15\">\n<p id=\"b433-16\">. Of course, the duty to exercise reasonable care may not be delegated if the work to be done is \u201cinherently dangerous\u201d. <em>Orr v. United States, </em>486 F.2d 270 (5th Cir. 1973); Restatement (Second) of Torts \u00a7 413; W. Prosser, Law <em>of Torts </em>\u00a7 71 at 472. Appellant does not contend that loading tallow drums is inherently dangerous. <em>Cf. Fitzgerald v. Compania Naviera La Molinera, </em>394 F.Supp. 413 (E.D.La.1975) (loading grain not inherently dangerous).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"16\">\n<p id=\"b434-5\">. \u201cThe responsibility for compliance with the regulations of this part is placed upon \u2018employers\u2019 . . ..\u201d 29 C.F.R. \u00a7 1918.2(a). It is clear from 29 C.F.R. \u00a7 1918.2(b) that the regulation only applies to stevedores and not to shipowners:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b434-7\">\u201cIt is not the intent of the regulations of this part to place additional responsibilities or duties on owners, operators, agents or masters of vessels unless such persons are acting as employers, nor is it the intent of those regulations to relieve such owners, operators, agents or masters of vessels from responsibilities or duties now placed upon them by law, regulation or custom.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b434-8\">Even under the LHWCA before the 1972 Amendments, the general principle was that \u201cliability for failure to comply with safety regulations should be imposed on the party exposing the injured employee to the dangerous condition\u201d. <em>Brock v. Coral Drilling, Inc., </em>477 F.2d 211, 215 (5th Cir. 1973). <em>See Burrage v. Flota Merchante Grancolombiana, S.A., </em>431 F.2d 1229 (5th Cir. 1970).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"17\">\n<p id=\"b434-12\">. This opinion does not take issue with <em>Napoli </em>because that case, on its facts, is little related to the problem here involved.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"18\">\n<p id=\"b434-13\">. The importance of this fact apparently arises from Illustration 5 to \u00a7 343A, where a person employed in an office slipped over a slippery waxed stairway whose condition was open and obvious. In that case she walked because \u201c[h]er only alternative to taking the risk was to forego her employment\u201d. In that situation the Restatement would permit the injured employee to recover in a negligence action against the office building owner. That is precisely the situation in <em>Napoli, </em>but quite unlike the situation here, where the longshoremen could stop work at any time.</p>\n<p id=\"b434-14\">The House Report did note that \u201cnothing in this bill is intended to derogate from the vessel\u2019s responsibility to take appropriate corrective action where it knows or should have known about a dangerous condition.\u201d 3 U.S. Code Cong. &amp; Admin.News 4698, 4704 (1972). The illustration concerning slippery conditions, immediately following this statement, may be <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"375\">*375</page-number>read to indicate that this responsibility relates mainly to the condition of the ship itself, not the activities of the stevedore. \u201c[G]iven the congressional concern about eliminating non-delegable duties, the quoted sentence could not possibly have been intended to establish a shipowner\u2019s duty to supervise such activities.\u201d <em>Hurst v. Triad Shipping Co., supra </em>at 1249-50 n. 35.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"19\">\n<p id=\"b437-26\">. <em>Frasca </em>v. <em>Prudential Grace Lines, Inc., supra, </em>394 F.Supp. at 1102 (granting judgment n.o.v.).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
