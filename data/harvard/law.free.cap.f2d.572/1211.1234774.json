Third parties had requested the disclosure of the information pursuant to the Freedom of Information Act (FOIA), 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552.</p>\n<p id=\"b1273-22\">After receiving notice of administrative decisions to disclose much of the requested information, General Dynamics filed suit in the federal district court seeking to permanently enjoin the disclosures. The court recognized that General Dynamics had a valid cause of action arising under FOIA and 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1905. After considering stipulated facts and affidavits filed in support of cross motions for summary judgment, the district court determined that the contested portions of the AAP\u2019s were within the scope of 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552(b)(3), which exempts from mandatory disclosure under FOIA information \u201cspecifically exempted from disclosure by statute.\u201d The basis of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1214\">*1214</page-number>the court\u2019s determination was its finding that disclosure of the information was prohibited by 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1905. The district court further found that the information in question was within the scope of 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552(b)(4), which exempts confidential commercial and financial information from the provisions of FOIA. The district court granted a permanent injunction prohibiting disclosure of the contested portions of the AAP\u2019s of both the Electric Boat and Con-vair Divisions of General Dynamics, apparently construing the FOIA exemptions as mandatory provisions requiring nondisclosure. <em>General Dynamics Corp. </em>v. <em>Dunlop, </em>427 F.Supp. 578 (E.D.Mo.1976).</p>\n<p id=\"b1274-4\">We find that the district court erred in construing the statutory exemptions of FOIA to be mandatory and in undertaking de novo review of the administrative determination to disclose the information in question. We reverse and remand for further proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b1274-5\">On June 24, 1975, a request for a copy of the Electric Boat Division\u2019s AAP was sent to the Maritime Administration. The Maritime Administration informed General Dynamics of this request and the procedures to be followed in objecting to the proposed disclosure. Electric Boat Division objected to the disclosure of parts of the AAP, asserting that the information was exempt from disclosure under FOIA, 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552(b)(4), and regulations of the Office of Federal Contract Compliance Programs (OFCC), 41 C.F.R. \u00a7 60-40.3(a)(l) and (2), as confidential commercial and financial information.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The Maritime Administration determined that disclosure of the information was proper despite Electric Boat\u2019s objections and this decision was upheld by the OFCC on appeal with certain minor exceptions for information relating to specific employees.</p>\n<p id=\"b1274-15\">The Convair Division AAP was requested from the Defense Supply Agency (DSA) on June 2, 1975. Convair Division objected to the disclosure of parts of the AAP on the grounds that the information was \u201cconfidential and proprietary data\u201d exempt from disclosure under FOIA. The DSA determined that the contested information did not fall within any FOIA exemption and therefore disclosure was mandated under the Act. The decision to disclose much of the information was affirmed on appeal to the OFCC, although that agency\u2019s determi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1215\">*1215</page-number>nation was apparently based on OFCC regulations rather than the provisions of FOIA.</p>\n<p id=\"b1275-5\">As a government contractor, General Dynamics is required by Executive Order 11246, 30 Fed.Reg. 12319 (1965), as amended by Executive Order 11375, 32 Fed.Reg. 14303 (1967), to take affirmative action to eliminate discriminatory employment practices. Regulations promulgated by the Secretary of Labor require that certain government contractors prepare and make available for administrative inspection AAP\u2019s providing information on past and projected employment of women and minorities. 41 C.F.R. \u00a7\u00a7 60-1.40, 60-2.1. The regulations delegate administrative responsibility for enforcing the Executive Order to the Director of the Office of Federal Contract Compliance Programs. 41 C.F.R. \u00a7 60-1.2. The Director, in turn, has designated certain \u201ccompliance agencies\u201d which have primary responsibility for monitoring compliance with the provisions of the Executive Order. 41 C.F.R. \u00a7\u00a7 60-1.3, 60-1.6. The Maritime Commission and the DSA are the compliance agencies for the Electric Boat and Convair Divisions, respectively.</p>\n<p id=\"b1275-6\">The provisions of FOIA are applicable to records submitted to the compliance agencies, and in addition the Secretary of Labor has promulgated regulations setting out guidelines for the disclosure of information received by the OFCC or its compliance agencies from government contractors. <em>See </em>41 C.F.R. \u00a7 60-40.1 et seq. These regulations are designed to implement FOIA and reflect the policy of the OFCC to disclose information to the public and cooperate with other agencies and private parties seeking to eliminate discrimination in employment.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1275-10\">The FOIA requires agencies to disclose upon request information not specifically exempt under 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552(b). <em>See Department of the Air Force v. Rose, </em>425 U.S. 352, 96 S.Ct. 1592, 48 L.Ed.2d 11 (1976); <em>EPA v. Mink, </em>410 U.S. 73, 93 S.Ct. 827, 35 L.Ed.2d 119 (1973). The Act expressly creates a cause of action in favor of parties requesting information to enjoin agencies from withholding that information. 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552(a)(4)(B). It is likewise clear that only information which falls within the exemptions listed in FOIA may be withheld by the agency despite a request for disclosure. However, the Act does not create a cause of action for submitters of information to enjoin an agency from disclosing information within the exemptions listed in \u00a7 552(b). In plain terms, FOIA is simply not applicable in reverse cases since the statute unequivocally states that the Act \u201cdoes not apply\u201d to matters of the type specified in the exemptions. 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552(b).</p>\n<p id=\"b1275-11\">Despite this clear statutory language, courts have reached conflicting decisions as to the permissive or mandatory nature of the exemptions and the existence of a cause of action, based on FOIA itself, to enjoin proposed disclosure of information within the exemptions. <em>See Westinghouse Electric Corp. </em>v. <em>Schlesinger, </em>542 F.2d 1190 (4th Cir. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1216\">*1216</page-number>1976) , <em>cert. denied, </em>431 U.S. 924, 97 S.Ct. 2199, 53 L.Ed.2d 239 (1977) (holding that a cause of action exists to enjoin disclosure of exempt information); <em>Union Oil Co. v. FPC, </em>542 F.2d 1036, 1045 (9th Cir. 1976) (language, subsequently withdrawn as premature, to the effect that FOIA exemptions mandate nondisclosure); <em>Pennzoil Co. v. FPC, </em>534 F.2d 627, 630 (5th Cir. 1976) (holding that exemptions are permissive); <em>Charles River Park \u201cA\u201d, Inc. v. HUD, </em>171 U.S.App.D.C. 286, 519 F.2d 935, 941 (1975) (holding exemptions permissive).<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1276-4\">In the most recent decision, <em>Chrysler Corp. v. Schlesinger, </em>565 F.2d 1172 (3d Cir. 1977) , <em>petition for cert. filed sub nom. Chrysler Corp. v. Brown, </em>46 U.S.L.W. 3438 (U.S. Dec. 27, 1977) (No. 77-922), the Third Circuit reviewed the legislative history of FOIA exemptions. In a well-reasoned opinion by Judge Gibbons the court held that both the Act and its legislative history clearly establish that there exists no statutory mandate of nondisclosure of exempt information nor any cause of action to prevent disclosure of such information.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> We agree. Any other construction would controvert \u201cthe basic policy that disclosure, not secrecy, is the dominant objective of the Act.\u201d <em>Department of the Air Force v. Rose, supra, </em>425 U.S. at 361, 96 S.Ct. at 1599.</p>\n<p id=\"b1276-6\">Such a construction is in harmony with the principal statement by the Supreme Court as to the effect of FOIA exemptions:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1276-12\">Without question, the Act is broadly conceived. It seeks to permit access to official information long shielded unnecessarily from public view and attempts to create a judicially enforceable public right to secure such information from possibly, unwilling official hands. Subsection (b) is part of this scheme and represents the congressional determination of the types of information that the Executive Branch must have <em>the option </em>to keep confidential, <em>if it so chooses. </em>As the Senate Committee explained, it was not \u201can easy task to balance the opposing interests, but it is not an impossible one either . . Success lies ' in providing a workable formula which encompasses, balances, and protects all interests, yet places emphasis on the fullest responsible disclosure.\u201d S.Rep.No. 813, p. 3. [89th Cong., 1st Sess. (1965)].</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1276-13\"><em>EPA v. Mink, supra </em>410 U.S. at 80, 93 S.Ct. at 832 (emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b1276-14\"><em>See also Department of the Air Force v. Rose, supra </em>425 U.S. at 361-62, 96 S.Ct. 1592.</p>\n<p id=\"b1276-15\">We find the district court erred in construing the exemptions as mandatory provisions requiring nondisclosure and affording a basis for injunctive relief.</p>\n<p id=\"b1276-16\">The district court alternatively held that 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1905 provided a cause of action to enjoin disclosure of information submitted to government agencies. Section 1905 is a criminal statute providing penalties for disclosure of a broad class of infor<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1217\">*1217</page-number>mation where disclosure is \u201cnot authorized by law.\u201d<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> In view of the limited circumstances in which a private cause of action may be implied from a federal criminal statute, <em>Cort v. Ash, </em>422 U.S. 66, 95 S.Ct. 2080, 45 L.Ed.2d 26 (1975), we endorse the view expressed in the <em>Chrysler </em>case that 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1905 does not afford submitters of information a cause of action for injunctive relief against proposed disclosures by administrative agencies. <em>See Chrysler Corp. </em>v. <em>Schlesinger, supra </em>at 1188. Furthermore, even assuming the applicability of \u00a7 1905, the statute\u2019s criminal sanctions for disclosure of information apply only to disclosures \u201cnot authorized by law.\u201d Here, OFCC regulations specifically provide for the disclosure of AAP\u2019s upon a finding that disclosure would be in the public interest and would not impede agency functions. <em>See </em>41 C.F.R. \u00a7 60-40.2.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> We find disclosure pursuant to the OFCC regulations is \u201cauthorized by law\u201d and not within the prohibition of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1905. <em>See Chrysler Corp. </em>v. <em>Schlesinger, supra </em>at 1186-88. <em>But see Westinghouse Electric Corp. </em>v. <em>Schlesinger, supra </em>at 1201-03; <em>Charles River Park \u201cA\u201d, Inc. v. HUD, supra </em>171 U.S.App.D.C. at 293-94, 519 F.2d at 942-43.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1277-5\">Faced with administrative determinations by the OFCC to disclose information pursuant to the regulations of that agency, General Dynamics did have the right to seek judicial review of the decisions under the Administrative Procedure Act, 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 701 et seq. Such action would not, however, entail de novo review by the district court but would instead require a determination on the administrative record of whether the agency\u2019s decision was \u201carbitrary, capricious, an abuse of discretion, or otherwise not in accordance with law.\u201d 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 706(2)(A). <em>See Camp v. Pitts, </em>411 U.S. 138, 93 S.Ct. 1241, 36 L.Ed.2d 106 (1973); <em>Citizens to Preserve Overton Park, Inc. </em>v. <em>Volpe, </em>401 U.S. 402, 91 S.Ct. 814, 28 L.Ed.2d 136 (1971).</p>\n<p id=\"b1277-8\">The procedure for review by the district court in reverse FOIA cases under the APA is made clear in the <em>Chrysler </em>case. First, the court must determine whether the contested information is within the scope of FOIA; second, assuming that it is, the court must decide whether the information falls within any FOIA exemption. If the agency has determined that no exemption is applicable the reviewing court must examine whether the agency has applied the correct legal standards in its determination. On the other hand, if the agency has found that an exemption is applicable but disclosure is nonetheless permissible and desired, the court must review the agency\u2019s decision in light of the governing legal standards (e. <em>g., </em>the agency\u2019s regulations) and the reasonableness of the agency\u2019s factual <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1218\">*1218</page-number>judgment. The court shall, however, determine on the basis of the administrative record whether the agency decision must be set aside as arbitrary or capricious. In doing so the district court cannot merely substitute its own judgment for that of the agency. When the record is deemed inadequate the court may require the agency to supplement the administrative record as to the reasons for its holding or remand to the agency for additional proceedings.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1278-4\">In the present case the administrative record fails to disclose the underlying bases of the disclosure order of the OFCC concerning the AAP of the Convair Division. We are left in doubt as to whether the agency felt the exemptions were applicable, and, if so, whether under its regulations such disclosure would be in the public interest and would not impede the discharge of agency functions. The rationale for the conclusion of the OFCC is not set forth. Under the circumstances we deem it necessary to remand the case to. the district court based solely on the inadequacy of the administrative record.</p>\n<p id=\"b1278-5\">In contrast to the determination regarding the AAP of Convair, the OFCC set forth the following major points in denying the Electric Boat Division\u2019s objections to the Maritime Administration\u2019s disclosure order: (1) Electric Boat failed to meet its burden under 41 C.F.R. \u00a7 60-60.4(d) to demonstrate that the information in question should not be disclosed under the standards set forth in 41 C.F.R. \u00a7 60-40.3; (2) disclosure of the information would not benefit competitors in submitting bids against Electric Boat on contracts; (3) FOIA exemptions are permissive rather than mandatory; and (4) disclosure of the information would benefit the public because</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1278-7\">[ijnternal and external dissemination of an employer\u2019s affirmative action program enables employees and potential applicants for employment to know and avail themselves of opportunities. Such dissemination enables interested persons to appreciate the detailed analysis performed by the contractor in establishing his equal employment program and the effort expended in achieving the goal.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1278-8\">Notwithstanding the more complete attempt to comply with its regulations, the OFCC\u2019s decision does not consider whether disclosure might affect or impede the overall effectiveness of the agency in discharging its functions. This is a standard of legal concern promulgated by the agency. Although it might be argued that the finding is implicit in the agency\u2019s order of disclosure, we think the importance of the question requires explicit evidence that the agency has in fact given consideration to this factor before ordering disclosure. The district court is at liberty to require the OFCC to supplement the administrative record in this regard or to remand the case to the agency for this determination. The district court on review must then decide whether the agency\u2019s determination is a lawful one under the standards of review set forth herein.</p>\n<p id=\"b1278-9\">The order of the district court granting injunctive relief is vacated and the cause is remanded to the district court for proceedings consistent with this opinion.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1274-6\">.

In addition to the disclosure requirements imposed by FOIA, the OFCC regulations mandate disclosure by the agency, upon specified findings, of a broad class of documents, including some information that would be exempt under FOIA.

The legislative history of the 1974 amendments to FOIA leave little doubt that Congress\u2019 intent was that the exemptions be considered permissive:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1276-11\">Congress did not intend the exemptions in the FOIA to be used either to prohibit disclosure of information or to justify automatic withholding of information. Rather, they are only <em>permissive. </em>They merely mark the outer limits of information that <em>may </em>be withheld where the agency makes a specific affirmative determination that the public interest and the specific circumstances presented dictate \u2014 as well as that the intent of the exemption relied on allows \u2014 that the information <em>should </em>be withheld. .</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1276-18\">A number of agencies have by regulation adopted this position that, notwithstanding applicability of an FOIA exemption, records must be disclosed where there is no compelling reason for withholding. This approach was clearly intended by Congress in passing the FOIA.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1276-20\">S.Rep.No. 93-854, 93d Cong., 2d Sess. 6 (1974).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b1277-6\">.

Under our holding, we think it clear that not only does \u00a7 1905 fail to provide a private cause of action, but for the reasons stated, contrary to the district court\u2019s holding, it does not afford a basis for exemption under \u00a7 552(b)(3).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b1278-6\">. In the present case the district court considered stipulated facts and a number of affidavits submitted by General Dynamics in support of its allegations that disclosure of the information contained in the AAP\u2019s would harm General Dynamics in its competitive position and in its labor relations. As indicated, we feel this was error in that the district court review should be only upon the administrative record. This does not preclude testimony or affidavits from the administrator setting forth reasons for the agency decision. <em>See Camp v. Pitts, </em>411 U.S. 138, 142-43, 93 S.Ct. 1241, 36 L.Ed.2d 106 (1973). In the present case, at least as it concerns the AAP of the Convair Division, as in the <em>Chrysler </em>decision, the agency record is too ambiguous for the court to comprehend the rationale of the agency\u2019s holding. Under the circumstances we feel a remand by the district court to the agency is the more appropriate procedure to be followed.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
