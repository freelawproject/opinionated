The district court sustained the motion to dismiss filed by the defendants, the United States Department of Transportation, and Norbert Tiemann, the Federal Highway Administrator, and this appeal followed. Plaintiffs also appeal the dismissal of a \u00a7 1983 suit for damages against three former State Highway Commissioners \u2014 Jack Stapleton, Sr., Roy E. Mayes, Sr. and Joseph H. Bruening \u2014 on the ground that the applicable state statute of limitations of three years had run.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Jurisdiction for the appeal of the denial of injunctive relief against the Department of Transportation and Tiemann is alleged under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1292(a)(1); ancillary jurisdiction is alleged as the basis for the appeal of the dismissal of the individual commissioners.</p>\n<p id=\"b244-5\">We affirm the dismissal for lack of subject matter jurisdiction.</p>\n<p id=\"b244-6\">In <em>Nall Motors v. Iowa City, Iowa, </em>533 F.2d 381 (8th Cir. 1976), <em>aff\u2019g, </em>410 F.Supp. 111 (S.D.Iowa 1975), this court held that 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 4602(a) precludes judicial review of actions taken pursuant to the substantive provisions of the Uniform Relocation Assistance Act, 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 4651. No subject matter jurisdiction exists to entertain a private cause of action for either equitable or legal relief under the Act.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> <em>See also Tullock </em>v. <em>State Highway Commission, </em>507 F.2d 712, 715 (8th Cir. 1974); <em>Paramount Farms, Inc. </em>v. <em>Morton, </em>527 F.2d 1301, 1304 (7th Cir. 1975); <em>Rhodes v. City of Chicago, </em>516 F.2d 1373, 1378 (7th Cir. 1975); <em>Will-Tex Plastics Manufacturing, Inc. v. Department of Housing &amp; Urban Development, </em>346 F.Supp. 654, 657-58 (E.D.Pa.1972), <em>aff\u2019d, </em>478 F.2d 1399 (3d Cir. 1973); <em>Ledesma v. Urban Renewal Agency, </em>432 F.Supp. 564, 566 (S.D.Tex.1977); <em>Boston v. United States, </em>424 F.Supp. 259, 264 (E.D.Mo.1976); <em>Nelson v. Brinegar, </em>420 F.Supp. 975, 978 (E.D.Wis.1976).</p>\n<p id=\"b244-11\">Without subject matter jurisdiction to hear the appeal of the district court\u2019s denial of an injunction, there can be no jurisdiction to entertain the ancillary claims against the three commissioners. In view of claims still pending in the district court, without certification under Fed.R.Civ.P. 54(b) the dismissals are not reviewable at this time.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b244-12\">The appeal is dismissed for lack of subject matter jurisdiction.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b244-7\">. Still pending in the district court are claims for injunctive relief against the State Highway Commission of Missouri and various claims under \u00a7 1983 against certain supervisory employees and current members of the State Highway Commission.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b244-8\">. <em>See also Barnhart v. Brinegar, </em>362 F.Supp. 464 (W.D.Mo.1973). Based on an analysis of the legislative history of 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 4602(a) the court concluded:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b244-9\">From this history, we believe one conclusion is irresistable \u2014 Congress intended section 102(a) [42 U.S.C. \u00a7 4602(a)] to preclude judicial review of federal and state agency actions under the real property acquisition</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b244-14\">practices of section 301 of the Act [42 U.S.C. \u00a7 4651].</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b244-15\"><em>Id. </em>at 472.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b244-16\">. Even assuming that the claim against the commissioners was properly before this court, we would be compelled to affirm the trial court\u2019s determination since we have held that the three year statute of limitations set out in Mo.Rev.Stat. \u00a7 516.130(1) is the appropriate period of limitations for civil rights actions against public officials. <em>See Peterson v. Fink, </em>515 F.2d 815, 817 (8th Cir. 1975). <em>See also Chambers v. Omaha Public School District, </em>536 F.2d 222, 228 (8th Cir. 1976).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
