Thomsen, United States District Judge for the District of Maryland, sitting by designation, prepared an opinion for a majority of the panel reaching a conclusion that the judgment of the Tax Court should be reversed. Senior Judge Albert V. Bryan prepared a dissenting opinion. After these opinions had been circulated but before they had been filed, a majority of the judges in regular active service voted for rehearing <em>en banc.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b488-9\">For the reasons stated in the dissenting opinion of Senior Judge Bryan prepared for the panel [see, infra, p. 431], as supplemented in an opinion prepared by Chief Judge Haynsworth for a majority of the <em>en banc </em>court, Chief Judge Haynsworth, Senior Circuit Judge Bryan, and Circuit Judges Russell, Widener and Hall join in an affirmance of the decision of the Tax Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b488-10\">Circuit Judges Winter and Butzner dissent for the reasons stated in the opinion of Judge Thomsen.</p>\n<author id=\"b488-11\">HAYNSWORTH, Circuit Judge:</author>\n<p id=\"b488-12\">The primary issue in this case is whether a parent is liable for the payment of income taxes as the result of transactions in which she gave to her son, his wife and their children three tracts of land upon the son\u2019s agreement to pay any applicable state and federal gift taxes. We affirm the decision of the Tax Court, <em>Edna Bennett Hirst, </em>63 T.C. 307 (1974), and hold that, under the circumstances of these gifts, Hirst did not realize any taxable income.</p>\n<p id=\"b488-13\">The facts are accurately and adequately stated in Judge Thomsen\u2019s opinion [see page 434, infra].</p>\n<p id=\"b488-14\">Any analysis of Mrs. Hirst\u2019s income tax liability as a result of these transactions must focus on two cases, <em>Turner v. Commissioner of Interna] Revenue, </em>49 T.C. 356 (1968), aff'd per curiam, 410 F.2d 752 (6th Cir. 1969); and <em>Johnson v. C. I. R., </em>495 F.2d 1079 (6th Cir. 1974) aff\u2019d 59 T.C. 791 (1973); <em>cert. den. </em>419 U.S. 1040, 95 S.Ct. 527, 42 L.Ed.2d 317. Basically, the government argues that <em>Johnson </em>is controlling, while the taxpayer contends <em>Turner </em>is still viable precedent. In our view, <em>Johnson </em>is distinguishable. <em>Turner </em>is the basis of our decision, as it was the basis of decision in the Tax Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b488-15\">In <em>Turner, </em>the donor made nine separate gifts of low basis securities, three to her children outright, and six to trusts for the benefit of her grandchildren. Each of these transfers was made on the condition that the recipient pay the resulting gift tax liability. The three individual donees contributed their respective shares of the gift taxes either from available cash or the sale of some of the donated securities. The six trust donees contributed their respective shares primarily from the sale of some of the donated securities, supplemented in two cases by loans, and in four by comparatively small amounts of current income. Aside from these small amounts of current income, there was apparently no basis for invoking Internal Revenue Code sections 671 and 677 which deal only with income <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"429\">*429</page-number>from trusts.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The Commissioner contended that each transfer was part sale and part gift and that the excess of the gift tax paid by each donee over the basis of the securities transferred to such donee constituted capital gain chargeable to the donor. In the Tax Court, and again on appeal to the Sixth Circuit, the Commissioner conceded that the transfers in trust were not sales. Thus, the principal problem confronted by the courts was whether the transfers to the three individuals could be classified as part gifts, part sales, resulting in the realization of capital gain, the same issue presented by the <em>Hirst </em>litigation.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The Tax Court in <em>Turner </em>regarded the transaction as a \u201cnet gift\u201d<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> in the amount of the value of the shares less the gift tax, a transaction which the court held had no income tax consequences to the donor. 49 T.C. at 363. The Sixth Circuit affirmed. 410 F.2d 752.</p>\n<p id=\"b489-5\">The taxpayer in Johnson<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> owned securities the fair market value of which exceeded $500,000. His basis was only $10,812.50. Two days prior to his establishment of an irrevocable trust for his children\u2019s benefit, Johnson obtained $200,000 from a bank on a thirty-day note \u201cwithout personal liability.\u201d The note was secured by stock. When Johnson created the trust, he transferred to it all of his interest in the stock. Apparently one month later, the trustees replaced Johnson\u2019s note with their own,<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> secured by the same shares of stock.</p>\n<p id=\"b489-11\">As a result of these transactions, the donors had $200,000 in cash, and the trust owned stock worth more than $500,000 but encumbered by a $200,000 note. The next year, Johnson paid approximately $150,000 in gift taxes.</p>\n<p id=\"b489-12\">The Tax Court in <em>Johnson </em>found the transactions were part of a plan of the donor to make the gift to the trust and to attempt to realize a substantial portion of the appreciated value of the stock for the donor without tax liability. It found that the donor retained the full amount of the loan obtained by him and used the proceeds for his own personal purposes. The Court held that the transfers were part gift, part sale, that the excess of the fair market value of the stock over the amount of the loan was a gift subject to gift taxes, that portion subject to the loan was a sale on which the taxpayer realized a capital gain to the extent the loan exceeded his basis in the stock.</p>\n<p id=\"b489-13\">The Tax Court\u2019s reasons for distinguishing <em>Turner </em>included the fact that the transfer in <em>Johnson </em>was not conditioned upon the donee\u2019s payment of the gift taxes, the donor reserved no interest in the trust corpus, the amount of the loans significantly exceeded the gift tax paid, and Johnson\u2019s transactions were part sale and part gift.</p>\n<p id=\"b489-14\">The Tax Court\u2019s judgment, but not its reasoning, was affirmed by the Sixth Cir<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"430\">*430</page-number>cuit. It found the substance of the transactions to be a gift of stock worth $500,000 in exchange for $200,000, $150,000 of which was used to pay the gift taxes of the donor. The court said its result could be reached by any of several routes. First, if viewed under section 61 of the Code the $200,000 was \u201cincome from whatever source derived;\u201d the use to which $150,000 of that amount was put was of no moment. Secondly, under \u00a7 2502(d) the gift tax is the donor\u2019s primary obligation<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> and under <em>Old Colony Trust Co. v. Commissioner of Internal Revenue, </em>279 U.S. 716, 729, 49 S.Ct. 499, 504, 73 L.Ed. 918 (1929) \u201c[t]he discharge by a third person of an obligation to him is equivalent to receipt by the person taxed\u201d so that here, effectively, the donee\u2019s payment of the donor\u2019s gift tax was income to the donor. Thirdly, under <em>Crane v. Commissioner of Internal Revenue, </em>331 U.S. 1, 67 S.Ct. 1047, 91 L.Ed. 1301 (1947), the donor shed his $200,000 debt, and realized income in that amount, particularly because Johnson received cash without any liability for repayment of the notes from his own assets.</p>\n<p id=\"b490-4\">The Sixth Circuit rejected as merely con-clusory the appellation \u201cpart sale and part gift\u201d employed by the Tax Court. Also rejected were the features by which the Tax Court distinguished <em>Turner, </em>because those lost their force to the extent the loan proceeds were ultimately used to pay the gift tax. The appellate opinion in <em>Johnson </em>stated that <em>Turner </em>has no precedential value beyond its peculiar fact situation.</p>\n<p id=\"b490-11\">We do not quarrel with the oft-stated proposition that the substance of a transaction rather than its form controls an individual\u2019s tax liability.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> Indeed, we believe that we adhere to that premise. In the present case, the Tax Court found that a gift was made.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> Surely this finding is not clearly erroneous in the familial and noncommercial context of the transfer of this land.</p>\n<p id=\"b490-12\">The predominant circumstance here is that this taxpayer did not intend to sell anything; she intended only to give her property to her progeny. She did not receive anything for herself; there was no economic gain of any kind accruing to her, except release from the normal tax burden of an owner of real estate.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b490-13\">Unlike <em>Turner </em>or the present case, <em>Johnson </em>involved a pre-transfer draw down of a portion of the appreciated value of the asset transferred, by the donor\u2019s borrowing against it immediately prior to its transfer to the donees. The gift to the trust was then made subject to the trust\u2019s paying the note. While the donor himself actually paid the gift tax, none of the $200,000 he bor<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"431\">*431</page-number>rowed was committed to payment of the tax. Thus as a result of his borrowing, and of the donee\u2019s repayment of the loan, $200,-000 was put in the donor\u2019s pocket. Although we may agree with the result in <em>Johnson, </em>that is not this case. Before the present transaction, Mrs. Hirst owed nothing, and by virtue of the transactions she received nothing. She was not better off after the transfer, with the donee undertaking the burden of the gift tax; she was simply not worse off.</p>\n<p id=\"b491-5\">As to the argument that the donee\u2019s payment of the gift tax was a discharge of the donor\u2019s debt, in effect producing income for her, it is no doubt generally true that another\u2019s discharge of an obligation is productive of income, but that is not universally the case. It depends upon the relationship between the parties and the existence of other obligations. For example, where a son has borrowed from a bank and his father pays off the son\u2019s loan without discharging any obligation to the son, the payment is not taxable income to the son, but a gift. The circumstances of the transaction determine the tax consequences. The predominant circumstances here dispel the notion of any gain accruing to Mrs. Hirst.</p>\n<p id=\"b491-6\">The judgment of the Tax Court is affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b489-6\">. The cases discussed in Footnote 3 of Judge Thomsen\u2019s opinion held that when there is a gift in trust subject to a condition that the applicable gift taxes be paid by the trust, the donor realizes taxable income under sections 671 and 677 to the extent that the trust pays the gift taxes out of accumulated or accruing income. Implicitly those cases hold that the donor derives no taxable income to the extent the trust pays the gift taxes out of other assets.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b489-7\">. In the instant case the taxpayer\u2019s son and daughter-in-law agreed to pay, and did pay, the applicable gift taxes on the gifts to all of the donees.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b489-8\">. <em>Turner </em>cited <em>Harrison v. Commissioner, </em>17 T.C. 1350 (1952) and <em>Lingo </em>v. <em>Commissioner, </em>13 T.C.M. 436 (1954) in both of which cases the donor had transferred property to a trust on the condition that the donee would pay the resultant gift taxes. In both cases the Tax Court held that in determining the value of the gifts subject to tax the gross value of the gifts should be reduced by the amount of the gift tax. The stated reason for this reduction was that the donee incurred the obligation to pay the tax as a condition of the gift; the donor did not intend to make anything other than a net gift.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b489-16\">. The taxpayer\u2019s wife was included as a party to the litigation. The case also involved two other taxpayers and their wives who transferred similar securities in similar transactions.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b489-17\">. More precisely, two notes were executed, one for the $200,000 principal and the other in the amount of $750 which represented the interest on the donor\u2019s note. When these two notes were executed, Johnson\u2019s \u201cdirect liability\u201d account, which the bank had created, was credited with $200,750, leaving a zero balance in that account.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b490-5\">.

See <em>Johnson v. C. I. R., </em>6th Cir., 495 F.2d 1079, 1082.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b490-7\">. <em>But cf. id. </em>at 1082-83 n.6. The Sixth Circuit in <em>Johnson </em>said \u201cwe would be hard put to justify\u201d the Tax Court\u2019s finding of a part gift, part sale on the facts of that case. Instead, it determined to look not to actual intent, as had the Tax Court in <em>Turner, </em>49 T.C. at 362, but simply to see whether the taxpayer received something of value as a result of the transfer. 495 F.2d at 1083.</p>\n<p id=\"b490-8\">In the present case, whether we consider the widow\u2019s intent in making the transfer, or what she may have received as a result of the transfer, our conclusion is the same; the transaction entails no income tax.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"9\">\n<p id=\"b490-9\">. Mrs. Hirst could have retained these undeveloped tracts of land without suffering any economic burden from the annual accrual of real estate taxes. She could have borrowed funds on the security of the lands and used the proceeds to pay both the taxes and interest. Had she done so, she would have retained for herself any subsequent appreciation in the value of the lands but would have reduced the amount of the estate she hoped ultimately to transmit to her son and his children by the aggregate amount of the loans she obtained to cover the taxes and the interest on the loans. Had she done that, no one would have contended that she incurred any income tax liability, but the ultimate effect would have been a transferral of the burden of payment of the real estate taxes to her son, her daughter-in-law and grandchildren. Hence, the fact that after the gifts she was no longer responsible for the payment of accruing real estate taxes is not such an economic advantage accruing to her that imposition of income taxes upon her should be warranted.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-3\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b491-7\">ALBERT V. BRYAN, Senior Circuit Judge,</author>\n<p id=\"Afa\">dissenting [from the decision of the panel]:</p>\n<p id=\"b491-8\">Upon the majority\u2019s faithful narrative of the facts, I would affirm the Tax Court, and wholly on the circumstances so recounted of Mrs. Hirst\u2019s conveyance, I dissent from the majority\u2019s assessment of <em>income </em>taxes against her.</p>\n<p id=\"b491-9\">Edna Hirst, an 81-year old widow, was land-poor. Her only cash money was invested in savings accounts totalling approximately $25,000.00. She owned her home absolutely, and also a one-half undivided interest in a six-room office building and a one-half undivided interest in three tracts of undeveloped land, with the outstanding interests vested in her husband\u2019s estate.</p>\n<p id=\"b491-10\">The unimproved land not only provided her no income but subjected her to annual real estate taxes. Because her available cash resources were too small to meet these burdens, she thought it best to distribute her property among those whom she naturally desired to have it eventually \u2014 i. e., her son, daughter-in-law and grandchildren. Inasmuch as this would entail gift taxes far beyond her means, she and her son agreed, before the gifts were perfected, that he would pay all assessable gift taxes. The Federal gift tax came to $68,277.00 and the State gift tax to $17,192.55, a total of $85,-469.55.</p>\n<p id=\"b491-11\">The gift taxes were fully satisfied, but nevertheless the Commissioner, now sustained by the majority, has complicated the transaction by assessing <em>income </em>taxes against the donor, Mrs. Hirst, on the total amount of gift taxes paid by her son. In justification it is said, contrary to the finding of the Tax Court, that the family arrangement must be viewed as consisting of two parts: (1) a gift to the extent of the value of the deeded real estate and (2) income to Mrs. Hirst to the extent of the amounts of the gift taxes assessable to her but paid on her behalf by her son.</p>\n<p id=\"b491-12\">As all masters in their respective fields of endeavor do relish a preference for problems of complexity rather than those embodying only run-of-the-mill components, the appellant Commissioner and my co-panelists turn this folksy, homespun transaction into an abstruse income tax enigma. Despite their sincerity, the plain question calling for answer here is starkly pointed up by plain facts, and it is just this: When Mrs. Hirst conveyed to her son and his family all of her real estate upon the sole understanding that her son (now used as including his wife) would pay all gift taxes assessable on the transfer, did Mrs. Hirst\u2019s act <em>in the circumstances </em>constitute a gift exclusively or a transaction giving rise to income to her?</p>\n<p id=\"b491-13\">For me these facts unalterably demonstrate that the transfer was a gift and nothing more; it did not result in income. The Tax Court\u2019s determination to this ef-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"432\">*432</page-number>feet, it seems to me, should be allowed to stand. The partition of the agreement into a gift and an income-producing transaction was not justified in the circumstances. That Mrs. Hirst realized <em>income </em>under the attendant circumstances is a conception violently refuted by the factual background of the transfer. Equally preposterous is the result: the imposition upon Mrs. Hirst of more than $16,000.00 in <em>income </em>taxes.</p>\n<p id=\"b492-4\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b492-5\">The Tax Court has found and concluded that Mrs. Hirst made no sale of any kind to her family; that the transaction was entirely a gift; and finally that there was no acceptable foundation upon which to attribute income to Mrs. Hirst. <em>Edna Bennett Hirst, </em>63 T.C. 307 (1974).</p>\n<p id=\"b492-6\">For this determination the Court looked to the substance of the agreement and did not theorize, as does the Commissioner, to descry in it income chargeable to Mrs. Hirst. The Court was sensitive to the inspiration and purposes of the agreement, giving weight to the ambience of its execution. The fact that this was a non-commercial, family transaction in which the donor received no funds with which to pay the gift or income tax assessed to her was of obvious significance. It is an incident compelled to be weighed within the measurement of the case.</p>\n<p id=\"b492-7\">As was said in <em>Commissioner of Internal Revenue </em>v. <em>Court Holding Company, </em>324 U.S. 331, 334, 65 S.Ct. 707, 708, 89 L.Ed. 981 (1945):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b492-8\">\u201cThe incidence of taxation depends upon the substance of a transaction. The tax consequences which arise from gains from a sale of property are not finally to be determined solely by the means employed to transfer legal title. <em>Rather, the transaction must be viewed as a whole, and each step, from the commencement of negotiations to the consummation of the sale, is relevant. </em>... To permit the true nature of a transaction to be <em>disguised by mere formalisms, </em>which exist solely to alter tax liabilities, would seriously impair the effective administration of the tax policies of Congress.\u201d (Accent added.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b492-10\">This resolve of the Tax Court is a finding of fact entitled to finality and to acceptance by the Court of Appeals without modification, since it is supported by adequate, indisputable evidence. The reports teem with decisions to the point. Again as a foremost authority is <em>Commissioner of Internal Revenue v. Court Holding Company, </em>supra, 324 U.S. 331, 333, 65 S.Ct. 707, 708, 89 L.Ed. 981 avouching the proposition in these words:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b492-11\">\u201cThere was evidence to support the findings of the Tax Court, and its findings <em>must </em>therefore be accepted by the courts.\u201d (Accent added.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b492-12\">It enlists <em>Commissioner of Internal Revenue v. Scottish American Investment Co., Ltd., </em>323 U.S. 119, 123-124, 65 S.Ct. 169, 171, 89 L.Ed. 113 (1944) wherein the command was laid down with even severer insistence:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"ad6-dedup-0\">\u201cThe Tax Court has the primary function of finding the facts in tax disputes, weighing the evidence, and choosing from among conflicting factual inferences and conclusions those which it considers most reasonable. <em>The Circuit Courts of Appeal have no power to change or add to those findings of fact or to reweigh the evidence. </em>And when the Tax Court\u2019s factual inferences and conclusions are determinative of compliance with statutory requirements, the appellate courts are limited to a determination of whether they have any substantial basis in the evidence. The judicial eye must not in the first instance rove about searching for evidence to support other conflicting inferences and conclusions <em>which the judges or the litigants may consider more reasonable or desirable. </em>It must be cast directly and primarily upon the evidence in support of those made by the Tax Court. If a substantial basis is lacking the appellate court may then indulge in making its own inferences and conclusions or it may remand the case to the Tax Court for further appropriate proceedings. But if such a basis is present the process of judicial review is at an end.\u201d (Accent added.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b493-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"433\">*433</page-number>There is no baselessness here. Nonetheless, the majority disregards or overlooks the compulsion of this language and goes beyond the limited scope of review.</p>\n<p id=\"b493-5\">But even if the Tax Court\u2019s resolution be hailed a conclusion of law and not a finding of fact, it is still impregnable. By way of prelude to a discussion on this point, a safe guide may be quoted from <em>Dobson v. Commissioner of Internal Revenue, </em>320 U.S. 489, 501-502, 64 S.Ct. 239, 247, 88 L.Ed. 248 (1943):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b493-6\">\u201cCongress has invested the Tax Court with primary authority for redetermining deficiencies, which constitutes the greater part of tax litigation. <em>This requires it to consider both law and facts. [W]hen the court cannot separate the elements of a decision so as to identify a clear-cut mistake of law, the decision of the Tax Court must stand. </em>In view of the division of functions between the Tax Court and reviewing courts it is of course the duty of the Tax Court to distinguish with clarity between what it finds as fact and what conclusion it reaches on the law. In deciding law questions courts may properly attach weight to the decision of points of law by an administrative body having special competence to deal with the subject matter. The Tax Court is informed by experience and kept current with tax evolution and needs by the volume and variety of its work. While its decisions may not be binding precedents for courts dealing with similar problems, <em>uniform administration would be promoted by conforming to them where possible.\u201d </em>(Accent added.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b493-8\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b493-9\">Decision in the present case was put upon <em>Richard H. Turner, </em>by the Tax Court, 49 T.C. 356 (1968), which had been affirmed per curiam, 410 F.2d 752 (1969), by the Sixth Circuit. The Tax Court here accurately summed the facts and stated the conclusions of <em>Turner </em>(as they relate to the individual donees therein) precisely depicting <em>Turner </em>and <em>Hirst </em>(the present) as matching each other:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b493-10\">\u201cIn <em>Turner </em>the donor made nine separate gifts of low basis securities, three to named individuals outright, <em>Each transfer was on condition that the recipient pay the resulting gift tax liability. </em>The three individual donees contributed their respective shares of the gift taxes either from available cash or the sale of some of the donated securities.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b493-12\">The <em>Commissioner argued that each transfer was part-gift and part-sale </em>and that the excess of the gift tax paid by each donee over the basis of the securities transferred to such do-nee constituted capital gain chargeable to the donor. . . . Thus, the principal issue dealt with by the Court was whether the <em>gifts to the three individuals </em>could be classified as part-sales, resulting in the realization of capital <em>gain </em>\u2014 an <em>issue identical with the one before us in the present case.</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b493-15\">\u201cIn deciding against the Government, the [Tax] Court reviewed the earlier cases and concluded that their \u2018rationales * * * are totally inconsistent with a finding that the transfer was a part sale, part gift\u2019. 49 T.C. at p. 362. To the contrary, the Court regarded the transaction as a \u2018net gift\u2019 in th,e amount of the value of the shares less the gift <em>tax </em>\u2014 a <em>transaction having no income tax consequences to the donor. </em>49 T.C. at p. 363. The decision was affirmed by the Sixth Circuit in a per curiam opinion. 410 F.2d 752.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b493-16\">\u201cWe cannot see any meaningful differences between the present case and <em>Turner, </em>and unless later decisions require us to reach a different result here we think we must follow it.\u201d (Accents added but footnotes omitted.) 63 T.C. 307, 312.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b493-17\">Later, the Tax Court followed <em>Turner </em>again in <em>Victor W. Krause, </em>56 T.C. 1242 (August 31, 1971) and its judgment was not thereafter disturbed in the courts. Moreover, in <em>Estate of Kenneth W. Davis, </em>\u00b6 71, 318 P-H Memo TC (December 30,1971), the Tax Court adhered to <em>Turner </em>and was affirmed, this time by the Fifth Circuit in <em>Estate of Kenneth W. Davis v. Commission</em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"434\">*434</page-number>er <em>of Internal Revenue, </em>469 F.2d 694 (1972). There has never been an overthrow of <em>Turner.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b494-4\">However, the Commissioner and the majority opinion assail <em>Turner </em>as disavowed by its own Circuit in <em>Joseph W. Johnson, Jr., </em>59 T.C. 791 (1973), affirmed as <em>Johnson </em>v. <em>Commissioner of Internal Revenue, </em>495 F.2d 1079 (6 Cir. 1974). On the contrary, study of <em>Johnson </em>in the Court of Appeals will utterly dispel any such claim for the effect of <em>Johnson.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b494-5\">Notably, it was decided by the same court as rendered <em>Turner, </em>and that Circuit refused to overrule or distinguish it on the law. If <em>Turner </em>was not the law, <em>Johnson </em>gave the Sixth a wide-open opportunity to say so; but neither that Circuit, nor any other court, to repeat, has renounced <em>Turner. </em>Certainly, we may not presume to hold that the Sixth Circuit <em>intended </em>to say in <em>Johnson </em>that <em>Turner </em>was overridden, for the Sixth explicitly and advisedly declined to say so.</p>\n<p id=\"b494-6\">True, <em>Johnson </em>said that <em>Turner </em>had \u201cno precedential value beyond its peculiar fact situation\u201d but this declaration actually reaffirms <em>Turner </em>on <em>its own </em>facts. Since, as previously noted, the facts now before us correspond with <em>Turner\u2019s, Johnson </em>does not authorize us to\" depart from <em>Turner, </em>especially in light of the just listed subsequent adoptions of <em>Turner. </em>The same is true of the cases that are disciples of <em>Johnson. </em>They are on <em>Johnson </em>facts which the <em>Johnson </em>court \u2014 the Sixth Circuit \u2014 has emphasized are peculiarly <em>Johnson\u2019s </em>and not <em>Turner\u2019s.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b494-7\">Thus we have the Tax Court and the Courts of Appeals following <em>Turner on its facts </em>in an unbroken line of cases; thus, we see, too, even the case on which the Commissioner and the Court now <em>rely </em>\u2014 Johnson \u2014refusing to depart from <em>Turner. </em>It seems strange, indeed, to me for us to be alone declaring it was untenable \u2014 especially when it appears that the <em>Johnson </em>court has been the only court to have dealt with the problem. Also it seems to me to be a complete disregard of the Supreme Court\u2019s directive for treatment of the Tax Court decisions both on the facts and on the law, especially when \u201cuniform administration would be promoted by conforming to them where possible\u201d. <em>Dobson v.

Judge Thomsen wrote an opinion in which Judge Butzner concurred. Judge Bryan wrote a dissent. After these opinions were circulated among the court, but before they were filed, the case was reheard en banc. Judge Haynsworth\u2019s present opinion is the result of that rehearing.</p>\n<p id=\"b494-12\">We dissent for the reasons stated in Judge Thomsen\u2019s opinion which follows:</p>\n<author id=\"b494-13\">THOMSEN, Senior District Judge.</author>\n<p id=\"b494-14\">The Commissioner of Internal Revenue appeals from a decision of the Tax Court, <em>Edna Bennett Hirst, </em>63 T.C. 307 (1974) (Raum, J.), which held that a transaction, in which two transferees (taxpayer\u2019s son and daughter-in-law) paid taxpayer\u2019s state and federal gift taxes resulting from three transfers of realty by taxpayer to them and their children, did not result in the realization by her of any taxable income. The payments by the son and daughter-in-law were made pursuant to a pre-transfer agreement between taxpayer and her son, set out more fully below.</p>\n<p id=\"b494-15\">A</p>\n<p id=\"b494-16\">The essential facts are not disputed. Taxpayer, a resident of Alexandria, Virginia, is an 81-year old widow. In 1967 she <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"435\">*435</page-number>had only one living child, her son Omer Hirst, who was married and had three children, Thomson M. Hirst, Deborah H. Nager and Edna Robin Hirst. At that time taxpayer owned the house in which she lived, a one-half interest in a six-room house being used as an office building and one-half interest in three tracts of undeveloped land. The remaining interests in the \u201coffice building\u201d and the three tracts were in her husband\u2019s estate. Taxpayer did not have any other substantial assets, except about $25,-000 on deposit in savings accounts.</p>\n<p id=\"b495-5\">The three tracts produced no income, but subjected taxpayer to real estate tax liabilities each year. To eliminate this burden on her limited liquid assets and to benefit the natural objects of her bounty, she decided to give her interest in the three tracts to her son and his family. Because such gifts would require the payment of substantial gift taxes, far in excess of taxpayer\u2019s liquid assets, she and her son orally agreed before the transfers were made that he would pay the resulting gift taxes. On April 11, 1967, taxpayer transferred her interest in one tract to Omer and his wife Ann, and her interest in another tract to two of the grandchildren and to her son as trustee for the third grandchild, a minor. On July 19, 1967, she transferred her interest in the third tract to two of the grandchildren and to the trust for the minor grandchild. All of the transfers were subject to the condition that Omer and Ann Hirst pay the applicable gift taxes. None of the tracts was subject to any mortgage, lien or other encumbrance.</p>\n<p id=\"b495-6\">In April, 1968, taxpayer filed a United States gift tax return listing the three parcels with adjusted basis and appraised value for each as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b495-7\">Donor\u2019s Adjusted Basis Value</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b495-9\">Tract 1 $4,654 $291,832.50</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b495-10\">Tract 2 3,723 119,404.50</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b495-11\">Tract 3 -0- 33,351.50</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b495-14\">Taxpayer computed her gift tax liability resulting from these transfers on a \u201cnet gift\u201d basis; she reduced the total value of the properties transferred by the sum of the state and federal gift taxes which her son and his wife \u201cagreed to pay as a condition to donor making the gift\u201d, and showed \u201ctotal net gifts\u201d of $359,118.95.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Omer Hirst and his wife paid the federal gift tax in the amount of $68,277, by check dated April 8, 1968, payable to the Internal Revenue Service.</p>\n<p id=\"b495-15\">The Virginia gift tax was paid by three checks, one dated April 22, 1968, for $15,-440, one dated July 15, 1968, for $253, and one dated June 6, 1969, for $1,499.55, all drawn by Omer Hirst. The checks were mailed on or about their respective dates and in each instance received shortly thereafter by the Virginia Department of Taxation, the payee. A computational error in the amount of the first check made the second check necessary; the third check was sent when taxpayer and her son decided not to contest the refusal of the Virginia authorities to agree that the value of the gifts should be reduced by the amount of the gift taxes paid by donees. The first two checks were not presented by the payee for payment until some time in February, 1969, at which time the drawee bank refused to honor them because of their stale dates, although sufficient funds were available. After learning that the checks had been dishonored, Omer Hirst instructed the bank to honor them when presented again. Soon thereafter the checks were presented and paid.</p>\n<p id=\"b495-16\">On her 1968 federal income tax return Mrs. Hirst, a cash basis taxpayer, made no reference to the payments made by donees in satisfaction of her gift tax obligations. In his deficiency notice to taxpayer the Commissioner determined that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b495-17\">\u201c[A]s the result of the gift of your one-half interest in three tracts of real estate <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"436\">*436</page-number>with a fair market value of $444,588.50, subject to the condition that the recipients would pay both the Federal and State gift tax, you have received taxable income as shown below:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b496-4\">Federal gift tax $68,277.00</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"Amd\">Virginia gift tax 17.192.55</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AVHd\">Total gift tax paid 85,469.55</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"Agx\">Less adjusted basis of % interest in real estate 8.377.00</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"a3x-dedup-0\">Realized gain 77,092.55</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"A7l\">Recognized gain \u2014 50% 38,546.28</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b496-5\">The Commissioner also made other adjustments which taxpayer concedes are correct except to the extent that they reflect automatic changes attributable to the inclusion of the $38,546.28 long-term capital gain in her taxable income for the calendar year 1968.</p>\n<p id=\"b496-6\">B</p>\n<p id=\"b496-7\">The principal issue for decision in this case is whether taxpayer realized income because the transferees of one of the three properties agreed to pay and paid the federal and state gift taxes resulting from the three transfers. If that issue is decided in favor of the Commissioner, the question arises whether the capital gain was realized in 1967 (the year of the transfers) or 1968 (the year when the gift tax returns were filed and the taxes shown thereon were paid).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b496-12\">The relevant statutes and regulations are set out in a statutory supplement at the end of this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b496-13\">The Tax Court prefaced its analysis by noting correctly:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b496-14\">\u201c * * * there can be no reasonable dispute that liability for the gift tax is placed by statute primarily upon the donor, section 2502(d) of the 1954 Code, and that payment of the tax by the donee must be regarded as discharging that liability of the donor. Moreover, the discharge of a solvent taxpayer\u2019s liability is ordinarily regarded as conferring a benefit upon him which may furnish the basis for taking it into account in the computation of taxable income\u201d. 63 T.C. at 310.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"Arr\"><em>Old Colony Trust Co. v.

The decisions therein are not inconsistent with the decision we have reached in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b497-5\">The Tax Court placed principal reliance upon <em>Commissioner of Internal Revenue v. Turner, </em>49 T.C. 356 (1968), aff d per curiam, 410 F.2d 752 (6 Cir. 1969). In <em>Turner, </em>the donor made nine separate gifts of low basis securities, three to named individuals outright, and six to trusts for the benefit of minors. Each transfer was made on condition that the recipient pay the resulting gift tax liability. The three individual donees contributed their respective shares of the gift taxes either from available cash or from the sale of some of the donated securities. The six trust donees contributed their respective shares primarily from the sale of some of the donated securities, supplemented in two instances by loans, and in four instances by a comparatively small amount of current income. Except for these small amounts of current income, there appears to have been no basis for invoking \u00a7\u00a7 671 and 677 of the Code, which, as noted above, deal only with income from trusts. In his statutory deficiency notice, the Commissioner took the position that each transfer was part gift and part sale and that the excess of the gift tax paid by each donee over the basis of the securities transferred to such donee constituted capital gain chargeable to the donor. See 49 T.C. at 360. However, the Commissioner conceded in the Tax Court that the transfers in trust were not sales. <em>Id. </em>at 362. On appeal to the Sixth Circuit, the Commissioner again conceded that the amounts paid by the trustees to the donor were not taxable to her. 410 F.2d at 753. Thus, the principal issue dealt with by the courts was whether the transfers to the three individuals could be classified as part gifts, part sales, resulting in the realization of capital gain, an issue similar to the one before us in the present case.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> The Tax Court regarded the transaction as a \u201cnet gift\u201d in the amount of the value of the shares less the gift tax, a transaction which it deemed to have no income tax consequences to the donor. 49 T.C. at 363. The decision was affirmed by the Sixth Circuit in a short per curiam opinion. 410 F.2d 752.</p>\n<p id=\"b497-8\">The issues in this case are similar to those in <em>Turner. </em>However, we are satisfied that the decision in <em>Turner </em>was wrong. Characterizing a transaction as a \u201cnet gift\u201d for <em>gift </em>tax purposes does not preclude treating the transaction as a taxable event giving rise to income for <em>income </em>tax purposes. Indeed, under the facts of the instant case, it requires such treatment.</p>\n<p id=\"b497-9\">The Sixth Circuit itself declined to follow <em>Turner </em>in <em>Johnson v. Commissioner of Internal Revenue, </em>495 F.2d 1079 (6 Cir.), cert. denied, 419 U.S. 1040, 95 S.Ct. 527, 42 L.Ed.2d 317 (1974). In <em>Johnson, </em>the donors transferred low basis stock to several trusts after having borrowed against the stock, using part of the borrowed funds to pay the gift taxes which resulted from the transfers and retaining the rest themselves. The trustees exonerated the donors from any obligation to repay the loans by substituting notes of the trusts for the notes of the donors. The Tax Court held, 59 T.C. 791 (1973), that the transfers in question were in reality part sales and part gifts, and were taxable to the donors as such. The Sixth Circuit affirmed the judgment but not the reasoning of the Tax Court, and in its opinion stated: \u201cThe substance of a transaction rather than its form must ulti<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"438\">*438</page-number>mately determine the tax liabilities of individuals,\u201d citing <em>Gregory v. Helvering, </em>293 U.S. 465, 470, 55 S.Ct. 266 (1935); <em>Commissioner of Internal Revenue v. Court Holding Co., </em>324 U.S. 331, 334, 65 S.Ct. 707, 89 L.Ed. 981 (1945). The court also stated: \u201cThe gift tax liability is the <em>donor\u2019s </em>legal obligation under section 2502(d) of the Code, and \u2018[t]he discharge by a third person of an obligation to him is equivalent to receipt by the person taxed\u2019.\u201d 495 F.2d at 1082, 1083 (emphasis in original). The court discussed <em>Turner </em>at length, and concluded: <em>\u201cTurner </em>has no precedential value beyond its peculiar fact situation, in view of the Commissioner\u2019s concessions in that case both in the Tax Court and on appeal to this Court.\u201d 495 F.2d at 1086.</p>\n<p id=\"b498-4\">In the case now before us for review, the Tax Court said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b498-5\">\u201cWe recognize that there is much force to the Government\u2019s position. The gift tax itself is imposed only upon the \u2018net gift\u2019, i. e., upon the gross amount of the property transferred minus the gift tax paid by the donee. In substance, a portion of the transferred property equal in value to the amount of the gift tax is not treated as having been part of the gift. But surely that portion did not vanish into thin air, and a strong argument can be advanced for the conclusion that it was exchanged for the donee\u2019s payment of the gift tax on the \u2018net gift\u2019, a transaction that may result in the realization of gain or loss depending upon the donor\u2019s basis in the property. * * * However, in the absence of any clear-cut overruling of prior law by a court of appeals, we are not prepared at this time to reexamine an intricate and consistent pattern of decision that has evolved over the years in this field, notwithstanding that there may be much to be said in favor of a more \u2018realistic\u2019 approach to the problem.\u201d 63 T.C. at 315.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b498-7\">Whatever may be said of the pattern of the prior decisions, it is our responsibility to apply to the facts of this case the appropriate statutes, regulations and legal principles. We must consider both the gift tax effect and the income tax effect of the transaction, so that the taxpayer is neither improperly taxed nor improperly escapes taxation.</p>\n<p id=\"b498-8\">The essential facts are that taxpayer\u2019s half-interest in the three tracts of unimproved land not only yielded her no income but were a drain on her liquid assets. To eliminate this burden, she and her son agreed in advance that she would transfer her interest in the three tracts to her son and his family, on condition that he and his wife would pay the resulting gift taxes, which they knew would far exceed taxpayer\u2019s liquid assets. Taxpayer transferred the properties and her son and his wife paid the gift taxes, which in the returns filed were computed on the net gift in the manner described in note 1, above.</p>\n<p id=\"b498-9\">By using that method of computing the gift tax, which both sides in this case agree was proper,<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> taxpayer avoided gift tax liability on that portion of the value of the transfers represented by the amount of the gift taxes. And, although taxpayer was primarily responsible for the payment of those gift taxes, they were in fact paid by two of the donees pursuant to the agreement made before the transfers.</p>\n<p id=\"b498-10\">The discharge of a solvent taxpayer\u2019s liability is ordinarily regarded as conferring a benefit which may result in income to the taxpayer. <em>Old Colony Trust Co. v. Commissioner of Internal Revenue, </em>279 U.S. 716, 729, 49 S.Ct. 499, 73 L.Ed. 918 (1929). The effect of what was done in this case is the same as though the son had paid the money directly to taxpayer-and she had used it to discharge her gift tax liabilities.</p>\n<p id=\"b499-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"439\">*439</page-number>In substance, taxpayer received the amount of the gift taxes in exchange for the transfer of the properties.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> To the extent that the gift taxes paid by donees exceeded taxpayer\u2019s basis in the properties transferred, she realized income subject to capital gain taxes. To the extent that the fair market value of the properties transferred exceeded the amount of the gift taxes paid, there was a gift.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> I.R.C. \u00a7 2512(b); Reg. 1.1001-l(e).</p>\n<p id=\"b499-5\">This result is not only required by the applicable law, it is fair both to the taxpayer and to the government. No part of the value of the property transferred has been taxed twice, and no part has escaped proper taxation.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> We intimate no opinion as to the income tax consequences of a transfer under facts different from those in the instant case.</p>\n<p id=\"b499-6\">C</p>\n<p id=\"b499-7\">Having found that income accrued to the donor, we now address the question of the year in which the income should be taxed. Under the controlling provisions then in effect,<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> the gift taxes resulting from the 1967 property transfers were due from the donor on or before April 15, 1968. The checks for the payment of the federal and state gift taxes (except for an adjustment of state taxes in the amount of $1,499.55, for which a check was sent in 1969) were delivered to the IRS and to the appropriate state agency in 1968. The Commissioner takes the position that the income to taxpayer resulting from the transaction (except for the $1,499.55) should be treated as having been realized in 1968. Taxpayer argues that the taxable event, if any, occurred in 1967 when the property transfers were made and her son promised to pay the resulting gift taxes.</p>\n<p id=\"b499-15\">We agree with the Commissioner that under the applicable law and the facts of this case, the taxable gain to Mrs. Hirst, a cash basis taxpayer, was realized when the gift taxes were paid. A promise to pay money in a future year does not represent income when the promise is made or received by the taxpayer unless the amount of the obligation is ascertainable in the taxable year and the promise can be readily converted into cash in the ordinary course of business.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> It follows that all but $1,499.55 of the gift taxes were taxable as a capital gain to taxpayer in 1968, and that the $1,499.55 was taxable in 1969.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b500-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"440\">*440</page-number>The decision of the Tax Court is reversed and the case remanded to it for calculation of the amount of additional income tax payable by Mrs. Hirst.</p>\n<p id=\"b500-4\">\n<em>Reversed and Remanded.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b500-5\">STATUTORY SUPPLEMENT</p>\n<p id=\"b500-6\">\n<em>Sections of the I.R.C. 1954, as amended before 1969, and Regulations thereunder, which bear directly or by analogy on the issues herein or in cases discussed herein.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b500-7\">Code \u00a7 61. <em>Gross income defined</em></p>\n<p id=\"b500-8\">(a) <em>General definition. </em>\u2014 Except as otherwise provided in this subtitle, gross income means all income from whatever source derived, including (but not limited to) the following items:</p>\n<p id=\"b500-9\">\u00edfc \u00a1}S $ Sk \u00ed(\u00a1 Sfc</p>\n<p id=\"b500-10\">(3) Gains derived from dealings in property;</p>\n<p id=\"b500-11\">(12) Income from discharge of indebtedness;</p>\n<p id=\"b500-12\">Jfc Sfc \u00a1}C ^ <em>% </em>!}!</p>\n<p id=\"b500-13\">Reg. 1.61-14(a) <em>Miscellaneous items of gross income</em></p>\n<p id=\"b500-14\">In addition to the items enumerated in section 61(a), there are many other kinds of gross income.
