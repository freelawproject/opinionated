DeWalt contends on appeal that the district court erred in rejecting his claim that three of his prior sentences were related cases pursuant to <em>U.S. Sentencing Guidelines Manual </em>\u00a7 4A1.2, comment, (n.3) (2003), because they were part of a common scheme or plan; the court found that only two of them were related. DeWalt also asserts that, in light of the Supreme Court\u2019s subsequent decisions in <em>Blakely v. Washington, </em>542 U.S. 296, 124 S.Ct. 2531, 159 L.Ed.2d 403 (2004), and <em>United States v. Booker, </em>543 U.S. 220, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005), the district court plainly erred in considering facts he did not admit when it adopted the probation officer\u2019s recommendations concerning the base offense level and criminal history.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b303-7\">We review DeWalt\u2019s constitutional claims for plain error because he did not raise them in the district court. Fed. R.Crim.P. 52(b); <em>United States v. Hughes, </em>401 F.3d 540, 547 (4th Cir.2005). To demonstrate plain error, DeWalt must establish that error occurred, that it was plain, and that it affected his substantial rights. <em>Id. </em>at 547-48. If a defendant establishes these requirements, our \u201cdiscretion is appropriately exercised only when failure to do so would result in a miscarriage of justice, such as when the defendant is actually innocent or the error seriously affects the fairness, integrity or public reputation of judicial proceedings.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 555 (internal quotation marks and citation omitted). As explained below, we conclude that no error occurred under <em>Blakely </em>or <em>Booker. </em>We agree that the court plainly erred when it failed to find that all three of the prior sentences in question were imposed in related cases because the offenses occurred on the same occasion. However, we decline to exercise our discretion to notice the error because DeWalt\u2019s sentence was within both the correct guideline range and the erroneous range used by the district court.</p>\n<p id=\"b303-10\">The factual basis for DeWalt\u2019s guilty plea described six sales of crack he made to an undercover agent between June 5, 2003, and August 7, 2003. At his guilty plea hearing, DeWalt stated that the factual basis was accurate. The total amount of crack DeWalt sold, 79.1 grams, was used to calculate a base offense level of 32 under USSG \u00a7 2D1.1(c)(4) (50-150 grams of cocaine base). DeWalt now maintains that he admitted distributing only the 40 grams of crack charged in Counts Five and Six. Citing <em>Blakely, </em>DeWalt asserts that his sentence is unconstitutional because it was based on drug amounts that were not charged in the indictment, and neither proved to a jury beyond a reasonable doubt nor admitted by him.</p>\n<p id=\"b303-11\">In <em>Booker, </em>the Supreme Court held that <em>Blakely </em>applied to the federal sentencing guidelines and that the mandatory guidelines scheme that provided for sentence enhancements based on facts found by the court violated the Sixth Amendment. <em>Booker, </em>543 U.S. at \u2014, 125 S.Ct. at 746-48, 755-56. When DeWalt ac<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"282\">*282</page-number>knowledged that the factual basis was accurate, he was unaware of the effect <em>Blakely </em>and <em>Booker </em>would later have on sentencing fact finding. Nonetheless, he was aware that the total quantity of crack set out in the factual basis would be used to calculate his guideline range. Therefore, no Sixth Amendment violation occurred in the calculation of his base offense level.</p>\n<p id=\"b304-4\">DeWalt also contests the entire calculation of his criminal history. He argues that the factual findings required to determine whether particular convictions are countable and how many points are assessed involve more than the mere fact of a prior conviction and therefore are subject to the requirements of <em>Blakely. </em>In effect, he argues that the prior conviction exception set out in <em>Almendarez-Torres v. United States, </em>523 U.S. 224, 118 S.Ct. 1219, 140 L.Ed.2d 350 (1998), may no longer be good law. This argument is foreclosed by the Supreme Court\u2019s reaffirmation of the <em>Almendarez-Torres </em>prior conviction exception in <em>Booker. See Booker, </em>543 U.S. at \u2014, 125 S.Ct. at 756 (\u201cAny fact (other than a prior conviction) which is necessary to support a sentence exceeding the maximum authorized by the facts established by a plea of guilty or a jury verdict must be admitted by the defendant or proved to a jury beyond a reasonable doubt.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b304-7\">In <em>Shepard v. United States, </em>544 U.S. 13, 125 S.Ct. 1254, 1263-64, 161 L.Ed.2d 205 (2005), the Supreme Court held that Sixth Amendment protections apply to disputed facts <em>about </em>a prior conviction, <em>id. </em>at 1262-63, as distinguished from the mere <em>fact of </em>a prior conviction. In DeWalt\u2019s case, no Sixth Amendment violation occurred because the court did not consider any facts that DeWalt had not admitted. The court relied on the record of DeWalt\u2019s prior convictions and sentences and, to determine whether specific prior offenses were related cases, the court relied on testimony given by DeWalt himself. <em>Cf. United States v. Washington, </em>404 F.3d 834, 843 (4th Cir.2005) (finding that district court\u2019s reliance on disputed facts about the defendant\u2019s prior conviction violated the defendant\u2019s Sixth Amendment right to trial by jury). We conclude that DeWalt cannot show plain error under <em>Booker </em>in the calculation of his criminal history.</p>\n<p id=\"b304-11\">The district court erred in determining, over DeWalt\u2019s objection, that only two of three prior sentences were imposed in related cases. Prior sentences are considered related and treated as one sentence under USSG \u00a7 4A1.2(a)(2) if there is no intervening arrest and the offenses (1) occurred on the same occasion, (2) were part of a common scheme or plan, or (3) were consolidated for trial or sentencing. USSG \u00a7 4A1.2, comment, (n.3). The prior sentences in dispute were imposed for three crimes committed during the evening of November 1, 1998, and ended after midnight on November 2, 1998. They were: misdemeanor resisting a public officer, felony larceny after breaking and entering, and felony larceny. DeWalt was sentenced for resisting a public officer on January 11, 1999. He was sentenced for the larceny offenses on November 1, 2001. The probation officer assigned two criminal history points for the sentence in each case.</p>\n<p id=\"b304-12\">In his sentencing memoranda and at the sentencing hearing, DeWalt maintained that the offenses were related because they were part of a common scheme or plan under USSG \u00a7 4A1.2, comment. (n.3).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> DeWalt testified at sentencing that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"283\">*283</page-number>he and a co-defendant obtained a stolen U-Haul truck at about 10:00 p.m. and loaded it with appliances they stole from six mobile homes at an Oakwood Homes sales lot. Around midnight, they fled when they were confronted by a security officer, but were quickly apprehended. The district court determined that the offenses of possession of the stolen truck and theft of the appliances were part of a common scheme or plan, and thus were related cases, while the resistance to arrest was unrelated. As a result of the court\u2019s ruling, DeWalt\u2019s criminal history score was decreased by two points. However, with fourteen points, DeWalt was still in category VI and the guideline range remained 151-188 months.</p>\n<p id=\"b305-5\">In the district court, DeWalt argued only that the prior offenses in question were related because they were part of a common scheme or plan. On appeal, he argues that all three offenses were related because they occurred on the same occasion, and were part of a common scheme or plan as well.</p>\n<p id=\"b305-6\">We are convinced that the three offenses occurred on the same occasion and thus were related cases under Application Note 3 to \u00a7 4A1.2. <em>See United States v. Moreno-Arredondo, </em>255 F.3d 198, 204 (5th Cir.2001) (the phrase \u201con the same occasion\u201d should be applied with its ordinarily understood meaning, not as a term of art); <em>United States v. Johnson, </em>961 F.2d 1188, 1188-89 (5th Cir.1992) (two simultaneous driving offenses and defendant\u2019s subsequent failure to identify himself to police officer occurred on single occasion); <em>United States v. Connor, </em>950 F.2d 1267, 1270 (7th Cir.1991) (common sense definition of \u201coccurred on a single occasion\u201d<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> requires finding that offenses committed on same date occurred on the same occasion); <em>United States v. Jones, </em>899 F.2d 1097, 1101 (11th Cir.1990) (holding that two bank robberies, one and a half hours apart, were <em>not </em>committed on the same occasion because they were temporally distinct), <em>overruled in part on other grounds, United States v. Morrill, </em>984 F.2d 1136 (11th Cir.1993) (holding that bank tellers, as a class, are not vulnerable victims). DeWalt\u2019s offenses occurred over several hours on the same night as part of one continuous criminal activity. We conclude that the district court erred in not finding that they occurred on the same occasion, and that the error was plain.</p>\n<p id=\"b305-9\">The government maintains that DeWalt began and ended the larcenies before he resisted the public officer and thus the offenses were not committed on the same occasion. This position is not supported by the record. DeWalt was arrested while he was in possession of the stolen U-Haul and still on the Oakwood Homes lot; the appliance theft had not been completed. The government also argues that the offenses were not related because they involved different locations and victims. This argument goes to whether the <em>Breckenridge </em>factors permit a conclusion that any of the offenses were part of a common <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"284\">*284</page-number>scheme or plan. Although DeWalt contends on appeal that the three offenses were all part of a common scheme, we need not reach that question.</p>\n<p id=\"b306-4\">Had the district court determined that all three offenses were related because they occurred on the same occasion, DeWalt\u2019s criminal history score would have been reduced from 13 to 11, and he would have been placed in criminal history category V rather than VI. With a final offense level of 29, DeWalt\u2019s guideline range would have decreased from 151-188 to 140-175 months. Because the 167-month sentence imposed by the district court falls within both ranges, we conclude that the error did not seriously affect the fairness, integrity, or public reputation of judicial proceedings. We therefore decline to exercise our discretion to notice the error.</p>\n<p id=\"b306-5\">Accordingly, we affirm the sentence. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b306-6\">\n<em>AFFIRMED</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b303-8\">. The probation officer recommended a base offense level of 32 under USSG \u00a7 2D1.1(c)(4) (50-150 grams of crack), and a three-level reduction for acceptance of responsibility, USSG \u00a7 3E1.1. With sixteen criminal history points, DeWalt was in category VI. The recommended guideline range was 151-188 months.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b304-8\">. The relevant factors in deciding whether offenses are part of a single common scheme or plan are whether the crimes: (1) were committed within a short period of time; (2) <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"283\">*283</page-number>were committed in close geographic proximity; (3) involved the same substantive offense; (4) were directed at a common victim; (5) were solved during the course of a single criminal investigation; (6) shared a similar modus operandi; (7) were animated by the same motive; and (8) were tried and sentenced separately only because of an accident of geography. <em>United States v. Breckenridge, </em>93 F.3d 132, 138 (4th Cir.1996) (citations omitted). Not all of these factors must be present for there to be a common scheme or plan, nor does the presence of a few of them require that finding. <em>Id.</em></p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b305-11\">.
