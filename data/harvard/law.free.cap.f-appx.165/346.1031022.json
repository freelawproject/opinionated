Gorton argues that the armed career criminal enhancement violated his constitutional rights because the predicate convictions were not charged in the indictment nor admitted at rearraignment. The argument is without merit. <em>See United States v. Guevara, </em>408 F.3d 252, 261 (5th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. \u2014, 126 S.Ct. 1080, \u2014 L.Ed.2d \u2014 (2006). Gorton properly acknowledges that his argument is foreclosed by <em>Almendarez-Torres v. United States, </em>523 U.S. 224, 235, 118 S.Ct. 1219, 140 L.Ed.2d 350 (1998), but seeks to preserve the issue for further review.</p>\n<p id=\"b368-26\">Gorton also contends that the district court erred in sentencing him pursuant to the mandatory Guidelines regime held unconstitutional in <em>United States v. Booker, </em>543 U.S. 220, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005). The sentencing transcript is devoid of evidence that the district court would have imposed the same sentence under an advisory regime, and, therefore, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"347\">*347</page-number>the Government has not borne its burden of establishing beyond a reasonable doubt that the district court\u2019s error was harmless. <em>See United States v. Walters, </em>418 F.3d 461, 464 (5th Cir.2005). Accordingly, Gorton\u2019s sentence is VACATED, and the case is REMANDED for further proceedings. <em>See id. </em>at 466.</p>\n<p id=\"b369-5\">AFFIRMED IN PART; VACATED AND REMANDED IN PART FOR FURTHER PROCEEDINGS.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b368-28\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
