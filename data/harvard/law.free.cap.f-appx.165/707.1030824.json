On appeal, Alvarez argues that there was conflict between the statutory definition and the guideline definition of \u201cserious bodily injury,\u201d and, as a result, he mistakenly pled guilty to a crime that he did not commit. He also argues that his sentence was enhanced improperly as a result of the conflicting definitions. His argument assumes that the Sentencing Guidelines definition of \u201cserious bodily injury,\u201d and not the statutory definition, controls this case. Although Alvarez acknowledges that Ashley Loucks, the woman to whom he sold the heroin and who subsequently suffered an overdose, \u201cprobably would have died,\u201d had she not been rescued by paramedics, he analyzes a litany of cases from other circuits, arguing that the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"708\">*708</page-number>facts here did not amount to \u201cserious bodily injury,\u201d as Loueks did not suffer a \u201cchronic or long term result.\u201d He contends that the injury suffered by Loueks was not sufficient to meet the standard set forth in U.S.S.G. \u00a7 1B1.1, comment. (n.l(L)), and, additionally, whether or not there was a \u201csubstantial risk of death\u201d was a fact that had to be found by a jury. As a result of the conflict between the statute and the guidelines, Alvarez argues, he did not understand his plea, and, therefore, the district court erred when it refused to allow him to withdraw his plea.</p>\n<p id=\"b730-4\">We \u201creview the denial of a request to withdraw a guilty plea for abuse of discretion, whereas ..'. the application of the Sentencing Guidelines are reviewed <em>de novo. \u201d United States v. Freixas, </em>332 F.3d 1314, 1316 (11th Cir.2003). A decision is not an abuse of discretion unless it is arbitrary or unreasonable. <em>United States v. Weaver, </em>275 F.3d 1320, 1328 n. 8 (11th Cir.2001) (citations and quotations omitted). After the district court has accepted the plea and before sentencing, a defendant may withdraw a guilty plea if \u201cthe defendant can show a fair and just reason for requesting the withdrawal.\u201d Fed. R.Crim.P. 11(d)(2)(B). In determining whether the defendant has met his burden for a withdrawal, a district court \u201cmay consider the totality of the circumstances surrounding the plea,\u201d including \u201cwhether the plea was knowing and voluntary.\u201d <em>United States v. Buckles, </em>843 F.2d 469, 471-72 (11th Cir.1988).</p>\n<p id=\"b730-5\">Section 841 provides, in relevant part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b730-6\">... [A]ny person who violates ... this section shall be sentenced as follows: In the case of [heroin,] ... if death or <em>serious bodily injury </em>results from the use of such substance[, such person] shall be sentenced to a term of imprisonment of not less than twenty years or more than life.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b730-7\">21 U.S.C. \u00a7 841(b)(1)(C) (emphasis added). \u201cSerious bodily injury,\u201d as used in the statute, is defined in \u00a7 802(25) as \u201cbodily injury which involves ... a substantial risk of death\u201d (the \u201cstatutory definition\u201d). 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 802(25).</p>\n<p id=\"b730-8\">The applicable guideline for violations of \u00a7 841(b)(1)(C) is U.S.S.G.- \u00a7 201.1(a)(2), which provides for a base offense level of 38 if \u201cserious bodily injury resulted from the use of the [heroin].\u201d U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2Dl.l(a)(2). The application notes for \u00a7 2D1.1 do not specify where the definition of \u201cserious bodily injury,\u201d as used therein, can be found. <em>See generally </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2D1.1, comment. The application notes to \u00a7 2D1.1 do, however, state that the guidelines use \u201cthe sentences provided in, and equivalences derived from, the statute (21 U.S.C. \u00a7 841(b)(1)), as the primary basis for the guideline sentences.\u201d U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2D1.1, comment, (n.10). The general definition for \u201cserious bodily injury\u201d put forth in the guidelines is \u201cinjury involving extreme physical pain or the protracted impairment of a function of a bodily member, organ, or mental faculty; or requiring medical intervention such as surgery, hospitalization, or physical rehabilitation\u201d (the \u201cgeneral guideline definition\u201d). U.S.S.G. \u00a7 1B1.1, comment. (n.l(L)). The guidelines note that the definitions set forth in \u00a7 1B1.1, comment, (n.l) are \u201cof terms that are used frequently in the guidelines and are of general applicability (except to the extent expressly modified in respect to a particular guideline or policy statement).\u201d U.S.S.G. \u00a7 1B1.1, comment, (n.l).</p>\n<p id=\"b730-9\">Although no court expressly has held that a statutory definition should be given preference over a general guideline definition, the Supreme Court has stated that the guidelines \u201cmust bow to the specific directives of Congress.\u201d <em>United States v. LaBonte, </em>520 U.S. 751, 757, 117 S.Ct. 1673, 1677, 137 L.Ed.2d 1001 (1997). The <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"709\">*709</page-number>Supreme Court also has held that \u201ccommentary in the Guidelines Manual that interprets or explains a guideline is authoritative unless it violates the Constitution or a federal statute.\u201d <em>Stinson v. United States, </em>508 U.S. 36, 38, 113 S.Ct. 1913, 1915, 123 L.Ed.2d 598 (1993).</p>\n<p id=\"b731-5\">Because the record demonstrates that Alvarez understood the facts to which he pled guilty, and those facts constituted \u201cserious bodily injury\u201d under his conviction statute and under the applicable sentencing guideline, the district court did not abuse its discretion in denying Alvarez\u2019s motion to withdraw his plea or err in determining his sentence. Accordingly, we affirm Alvarez\u2019s conviction and sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b731-6\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
