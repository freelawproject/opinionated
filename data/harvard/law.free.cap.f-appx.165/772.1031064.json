Pineda argues that (1) the evidence to support his conviction was insufficient, and (2) the sentencing court committed statutory error under <em>United States v. Booker, </em>543 U.S. 220, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005) when it found that the defendants \u201cmust be sentenced in accordance with the current guidelines.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b796-10\">Vazquez-Casares argues that (1) the evidence to support his conviction was insufficient; (2) the government was required to share the psychological test results of the government\u2019s star witness, Octavio Ugarte-Munoz, as <em>Brady v. Maryland, </em>373 U.S. 83, 83 S.Ct. 1194, 10 L.Ed.2d 215 (1963) material; (3) the district court erred by denying his motion to suppress even though the stop of Pineda\u2019s Camaro and Vazquez-Casares\u2019s arrest were illegally based on mere suspicion; and (4) the sentencing court constitutionally erred under <em>Booker </em>by inflicting punishment that the jury\u2019s verdict alone did not allow based on the drug quantity and the aggravating role enhancement, and that the sentencing court committed statutory error by applying the guidelines as mandatory.</p>\n<p id=\"b796-12\">I. <em>Sufficiency of the evidence</em></p>\n<p id=\"b796-13\">We review the sufficiency of the evidence <em>de novo </em>where a defendant properly preserved the issue by moving for a judgment of acquittal. <em>United States v. Perez-Tosta, </em>36 F.3d 1552, 1556 (11th Cir.1994). We must determine whether a reasonable fact-finder could conclude that the evidence established the defendant\u2019s guilt beyond a reasonable doubt. <em>United States v. Hansen, </em>262 F.3d 1217, 1236 (11th Cir.2001). We view the facts, and draw all reasonable inferences therefrom, in the light most favorable to the government. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b796-14\">To support a conspiracy conviction under 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 846 the government must prove that there is an agreement among two or more persons to violate the narcotics laws, and it \u201cmust prove knowledge, intent and participation beyond a reasonable doubt.\u201d <em>United States v. Parrado, </em>911 F.2d 1567, 1570 (11th Cir.1990) (citation omitted). Mere presence at the scene is not sufficient to meet this standard. <em>Id. </em>Direct evidence of a conspiracy is not required, however, as \u201c[a] defendant\u2019s knowing participation in a conspiracy may be <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"775\">*775</page-number>established through proof of surrounding circumstances such as acts committed by the defendant which furthered the purpose of the conspiracy.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b797-5\">Here, there was evidence that (1) Pineda was present when Vazquez-Casares placed a towel-concealed package into Ugarte-Munoz\u2019s vehicle, which was found to be methamphetamine, and Ugarte-Munoz was offered $5,000 to drive the package to Ocala, Florida; (2) Pineda and Vazquez-Casares followed UgarteMunoz\u2019s vehicle in a Camaro for approximately three hours and stopped nearby, whenever Ugarte-Munoz stopped; (3) Pineda was in the car while Vazquez-Casares made 12 calls to Ugarte-Munoz and Ugarte-Munoz called Vazquez-Casares 4 times so that instructions could be given to Ugarte-Munoz; (4) the methamphetamine smelled like soap and was wrapped in Wal-Mart bags; (5) soap with the same fragrance as the methamphetamine and wrapped in Wal-Mart bags was discovered tucked behind the wheel well of Pineda\u2019s Camaro; (6) Pineda gave an explanation for his destination inconsistent with Vazquez-Casares\u2019s explanation; (7) Pineda and Vazquez-Casares stated that they did not know Ugarte-Munoz even though they had been following him for miles and Vazquez-Casares repeatedly had spoken on the telephone with him; and (8) Pineda was carrying $600 in cash and a card with the drug supplier\u2019s phone number on it. Accordingly, once all reasonable inferences are drawn from this evidence in the government\u2019s favor, the evidence was sufficient to prove that Pineda and VazquezCasares knowingly participated in a drug conspiracy. <em>See Parrado, </em>911 F.2d at 1570.</p>\n<p id=\"b797-6\">II. Brady <em>error</em></p>\n<p id=\"b797-7\">We review a district court\u2019s denial of a motion for a new trial based on a <em>Brady </em>violation for abuse of discretion. <em>United States v. Kersey, </em>130 F.3d 1463, 1465 (11th Cir.1997). In order to state a <em>Brady </em>claim, a defendant must show that: (1) the government possessed evidence favorable to the defendant; (2) the defendant did not possess the evidence nor could he have obtained it himself with any reasonable diligence; (3) the prosecution suppressed the favorable evidence; and (4) had the evidence been disclosed to the defense, a reasonable probability exists that the outcome of the proceedings would have been different. <em>United States v. Hansen, </em>262 F.3d 1217, 1234 (11th Cir.2001). A \u201creasonable probability\u201d is \u201ca probability sufficient to undermine confidence in the outcome.\u201d <em>United States v. Bagley, </em>473 U.S. 667, 682, 105 S.Ct. 3375, 87 L.Ed.2d 481 (1985).</p>\n<p id=\"b797-9\">Here the evidence in question is a psychologist\u2019s examination and report which concluded that Ugarte-Munoz\u2019s had a very low risk of reoffending and that he was easily led by others since he had borderline intelligence and alcohol abuse problems. Even assuming that the prosecution had knowledge of Ugarte-Munoz\u2019s psychological report prior to trial, Vazquez-Casares has failed to show a reasonable probability that the result of his trial would have been different had he received the report in advance. Indeed, the jury could observe Ugarte-Munoz\u2019s diminished intellectual capacity for itself while he was on the stand, and UgarteMunoz was subjected to cross-examination concerning the inconsistencies in his statements and the benefit that he would receive from testifying. Thus, the court did not abuse its discretion by denying Vazquez-Casares\u2019s motion for a new trial. <em>Hansen, </em>262 F.3d at 1234.</p>\n<p id=\"b797-10\">III. <em>Denial of the motion to suppress</em></p>\n<p id=\"b797-11\">We accept the district court\u2019s factual findings regarding a motion to suppress as <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"776\">*776</page-number>true unless they are clearly erroneous, and we construe those facts in the light most favorable to the party that prevailed below. <em>United States v. Perkins, </em>348 F.3d 965, 969 (11th Cir.2003). We review the district court\u2019s application of the law to those facts <em>de novo. Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b798-4\">The Supreme Court has held that \u201can officer may ... conduct a brief, investigatory stop when the officer has a reasonable, articulable suspicion that criminal activity is afoot.\u201d <em>Illinois v. Wardlow, </em>528 U.S. 119, 123, 120 S.Ct. 673, 145 L.Ed.2d 570 (2000) (citation omitted). \u201cWhile reasonable suspicion is a less demanding standard than probable cause and requires a showing considerably less than preponderance of the evidence, the Fourth Amendment requires at least a minimal level of objective justification for making the stop.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 123, 120 S.Ct. 673 (internal quotation marks omitted). In making reasonable-suspicion determinations, reviewing courts must look at the \u201ctotality of the circumstances\u201d of each case to determine whether the detaining officer had a \u201cparticularized and objective basis for suspecting legal wrongdoing.\u201d <em>United States v. Arvizu, </em>534 U.S. 266, 273, 122 S.Ct. 744, 151 L.Ed.2d 740 (2002) (internal quotation marks omitted). This process \u201callows officers to draw on their own experience and specialized training to make inferences from and deductions about the cumulative information available to them that might elude an untrained person.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b798-5\">The totality of the circumstances in this case supports the district court\u2019s finding that law enforcement had reasonable suspicion to effectuate the stop of the Camaro Vazquez-Casares and Pineda were riding in because (1) in the officer\u2019s experience, it was typical for people transporting drugs to use a \u201ctrail car\u201d; (2) Drug Enforcement Agency agents had observed the Camaro following the load vehicle, which a confidential informant said contained methamphetamine, at a rate of speed consistent with the load car\u2019s and stopping when the load car stopped; (3) the confidential informant stated that a large quantity of methamphetamine was put into the load car by the passenger of a vehicle matching the description of the Camaro; (4) when the driver of the load vehicle was stopped for a traffic violation, a large quantity of methamphetamine was found in his vehicle, consistent with the confidential informant\u2019s information; and (5) the driver of the load car told law enforcement that he was given the methamphetamine by the passenger of the Camaro, a man named Omar, and that the Camaro was following him. Accordingly, as a determination that reasonable suspicion exists \u201cneed not rule out the possibility of innocent conduct,\u201d the district court properly found that there was reasonable suspicion for the traffic stop of the Camaro. <em>Arvizu, </em>534 U.S. at 277, 122 S.Ct. 744.</p>\n<p id=\"b798-8\">Law enforcement officers have probable cause to arrest when the facts and circumstances within their collective knowledge, or of which they have reasonably trustworthy information, \u201cwould cause a prudent person to believe that the suspect has committed or is committing an offense.\u201d <em>Craig v. Singletary, </em>127 F.3d 1030, 1042 (11th Cir.1997). After the initial stop, the Camaro passenger\u2019s identification showed that his name was Omar, which was consistent with the information given by Ugarte-Munoz upon his arrest. Accordingly, the officers had probable cause for the arrest, and law enforcement\u2019s search of Vazquez-Casares\u2019s person was a proper search incident to arrest. <em>See United States v. Robinson, </em>414 U.S. 218, 224, 94 S.Ct. 467, 38 L.Ed.2d 427 (1973).</p>\n<p id=\"b798-9\">Finally, an \u201cinventory search permits a thorough search of property lawfully in police custody as long as that search <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"777\">*777</page-number>is consistent with the police caretaking function.\u201d <em>United States v. O\u2019Bryant, </em>775 F.2d 1528, 1534 (11th Cir.1985) Accordingly, the search of the Camaro after Vazquez-Casares and Pineda were taken into custody was lawful. Therefore, the district court properly denied Vazquez-Casares\u2019s motion to suppress.</p>\n<p id=\"b799-5\">IV. Booker <em>sentencing error</em></p>\n<p id=\"b799-6\">Because Pineda and Vazquez-Casares objected to the drug amount in the district court, we review their sentence <em>de novo </em>and reverse the district court only if any error was harmful. <em>See United States v. Paz, </em>405 F.3d 946, 948 (11th Cir.2005). \u201cA non-constitutional <em>[Booker] </em>error is harmless if, viewing the proceedings in their entirety, a court determines that the error did not affect the [sentence], or had but very slight effect. If one can say with fair assurance ... that the [sentence] was not substantially swayed by the error, the [sentence] is due to be affirmed even though there was error.\u201d <em>United States v. Mathenia, </em>409 F.3d 1289, 1292 (11th Cir.2005) (internal quotation marks omitted). Furthermore \u201c[t]he non-constitutional harmless error standard is not easy for the government to meet.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b799-7\">It is uncontested here that the sentencing court committed statutory error by finding that the sentencing guidelines were mandatory. We cannot say that this error was harmless based solely on the district judges\u2019 sentencing defendants at the midpoint of the guidelines range and stating that the sentences were \u201csufficient to provide just punishment for the offense.\u201d <em>See United States v. Glover, </em>431 F.3d 744 (11th Cir.2005) (finding that <em>Booker </em>statutory error was not harmless where the district judge sentenced defendants in the middle of the guidelines range under a mandatory guidelines system because \u201cthe sentence alone tells us nothing about whether the district court would have imposed a lesser sentence under an advisory guidelines scheme.\u201d). We have required more than a sentence in the middle of the guidelines range to find <em>Booker </em>statutory error to be harmless. <em>See, e.g., Mathenia, </em>409 F.3d at 1292 (finding <em>Booker </em>statutory error to be harmless where the district judge stated that \u201cI would nonetheless consider the guidelines as \u2014 for their persuasive value or as advisory, and the sentence I would impose would be the same.\u201d). Accordingly, we vacate both Pineda and VazquezCasares\u2019 sentences on this ground.</p>\n<p id=\"b799-9\">Vazquez-Casares also claims constitutional <em>Booker </em>error. His claim of constitutional <em>Booker </em>error must be disregarded only if harmless beyond a reasonable doubt, a standard that is only met where it is \u201cclear beyond a reasonable doubt that the error complained of did not contribute to the [sentence] obtained.\u201d <em>See Paz, </em>405 F.3d at 948 (internal quotation marks omitted). Moreover, the government bears the burden of showing that the sentence did not affect the defendant\u2019s substantial rights. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b799-10\">Vazquez-Casares first claims that there was constitutional <em>Booker </em>error based on the drug quantity attributed to him. However, Vazquez-Casares stipulated during trial that there were \u201c1,789 grams of methamphetamine,\u201d which was the exact amount attributed to him in the PSI and at sentencing. Accordingly, there was no constitutional <em>Booker </em>error based on the drug quantity attributed to Vazquez-Casares at sentencing. <em>See Booker, </em>543 U.S. at 244, 125 S.Ct. 738 (\u201cAny fact (other than a prior conviction) which is necessary to support a sentence exceeding the maximum authorized by the facts established by a plea of guilty or a jury verdict must be <em>admitted by the defendant </em>or proved to a jury beyond a reasonable doubt.\u201d) (emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b799-11\">Next, Vazquez-Casares claims that there was constitutional <em>Booker </em>error <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"778\">*778</page-number>based on the role enhancement that he received. The government did not address this issue, much less show that VazquezCasares\u2019s sentence did not affect his substantial rights. Accordingly, as the district court applied a two-level enhancement based on its finding regarding Vazquez-Casares\u2019s supervisory role, it is not clear beyond a reasonable doubt that the error complained of did not contribute to Vazquez-Casares\u2019s sentence. Therefore, because Vazquez-Casares\u2019s sentence was erroneously based, in part, on an extra-verdict sentence enhancement imposed under a mandatory guidelines system, and the government did not show that this constitutional error was harmless beyond a reasonable doubt, we vacate Vazquez-Casares\u2019s sentence and remand for resentencing consistent with this opinion. <em>See Paz, </em>405 F.3d at 948-49.</p>\n<p id=\"b800-3\">CONVICTIONS AFFIRMED, SENTENCES VACATED AND REMANDED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
