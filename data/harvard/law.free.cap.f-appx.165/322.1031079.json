Petitioners argue that the credibility determination is not supported by substantial evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b345-16\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b345-17\">Ordinarily, we review decisions made by the BIA. However, where the BIA summarily affirms the IJ\u2019s order, we review the IJ\u2019s findings. <em>Soadjede v. Ashcroft, </em>324 F.3d 830, 832 (5th Cir.2003); <em>Efe v. Ashcroft, </em>293 F.3d 899, 903 (5th Cir.2002). We will not disturb factual findings of the BIA unless we \u201cfind not only that the evidence supports a contrary conclusion, but that the evidence <em>compels </em>it.\u201d <em>Chun v. INS, </em>40 F.3d 76, 78 (5th Cir.1994); <em>see also </em>8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(b)(4)(B). This \u201csubstantial evidence\u201d standard requires that the decision be based on the evidence presented and that the decision be substantially reasonable. <em>Carbajal-Gonzalez v. INS, </em>78 F.3d 194, 197 (5th Cir.1996).</p>\n<p id=\"b345-18\">We give great deference to an IJ\u2019s findings concerning a witness\u2019s credibility. <em>Efe, </em>293 F.3d at 903. In making a credibility determination, the factfinder should consider the totality of the circumstances and may base his decision on, <em>inter alia, </em>the witness\u2019s demeanor, the \u201cinherent plausibility\u201d of the witness\u2019s account, the internal consistency of the account, and the consistency of the account with other evidence. 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1158(b)(l)(iii).</p>\n<p id=\"b345-19\">The record does not compel this court to find Mr. and Mrs. Aggarwal credible on the basis of these factors. As the IJ discussed in his decision, there were inconsistencies within, as well as between, the Aggarwals\u2019 testimonies. In addition, the IJ found some of their assertions implausible. He also found Mr. Aggarwal\u2019s testimony to be vague and his responses guarded and generalized.</p>\n<p id=\"b346-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"324\">*324</page-number>II</p>\n<p id=\"b346-4\">Petitioners also ask this court to reevaluate our holding in <em>Soadjede v. Ashcroft, </em>324 F.3d 830 (5th Cir.2003), that procedures under which a single member of the BIA could summarily affirm a decision of an IJ does not deprive this court of a basis for judicial review and does not violate due process. <em>Id. </em>at 832-33. We review questions of law <em>de novo. Efe v. Ashcroft, </em>293 F.3d 899, 903 (5th Cir.2002). Petitioners\u2019 particular due process complaint that they did not receive an adequate explanation of the BIA\u2019s reasoning is unavailing. In <em>Soadjede, </em>we noted that the summary affirmance procedures of the BIA are similar to this court\u2019s and other courts\u2019 summary disposition procedures, which do not violate due process. 324 F.3d at 832; <em>see </em>5TH CIR. R. 47.6 (providing for affirmance without opinion under enumerated circumstances). Because the decision of the IJ in the instant case was correct and did not raise novel or substantial factual or legal questions, the decision met the criteria for summary affirmance. <em>See 8 </em>C.F.R. \u00a7 1003.1(d). Petitioners had \u00e1 full evidentiary hearing before an IJ and appeals to both the BIA and this court, satisfying due process. In addition, we have a reasoned basis for review because the oral decision and order of the immigration judge provides the basis for review. <em>Albathani v. INS, </em>318 F.3d 365, 376-78 (1st Cir.2003). Thus, we reaffirm our holding in <em>Soadjede.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b346-5\">\n<em>Ill</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b346-6\">For the foregoing reasons, we will not disturb the BIA\u2019s adverse credibility finding. Because Petitioners\u2019 asylum application depends on the Aggarwals\u2019 testimony, we conclude that they have not demonstrated their eligibility for asylum, withholding of removal, or relief under the Convention Against Torture and accordingly DENY their petition for review.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b345-12\"> Pursuant to 5TH CIR. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5TH CIR. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
