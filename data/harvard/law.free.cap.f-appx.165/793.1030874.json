No reversible error has been shown; we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b816-9\">Ingram raises a single issue on appeal: whether imposition of a sentence under a <em>post-Booker, United States v. Booker, </em>543 U.S. 220, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005), advisory application of the Guidelines, for offenses committed (and for which a guilty plea was entered) <em>pre-Booker, </em>violates <em>ex post facto </em>principles.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Ingram contends on appeal, as she did before the district court, that, at the time the offense was committed and at the time she entered her guilty plea, the \u201cstatutory maximum sentence\u201d she could receive, based.solely on her base offense level as defined by the Guidelines<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> (U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2Bl.l(a)), was six months.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> The district court enhanced her sentence 14 levels because the loss was more than $400,000 but less than $1,000,000 U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2B1.1(b)(1)(H), and two levels because the offense involved sophisticated means U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2B1.1(b)(8)(C). Ingram received a three-level reduction for acceptance of responsibility (U.S.S.G. \u00a7\u00a7 3El.l(a) and (b)). Ingram argues that retroactive application of Booker\u2019s remedial opinion, which effectively made the Guidelines advisory, increased her sentence in violation of <em>ex post facto </em>principles incorporated into the Due Process Clause.</p>\n<p id=\"b816-15\">We have considered and rejected this argument in <em>United States v. Duncan, </em>400 F.3d 1297 (11th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. \u2014, 126 S.Ct. 432, 163 L.Ed.2d 329 (2005).<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> As we explained in <em>Duncan, </em>400 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"795\">*795</page-number>F.3d at 1308, before <em>Booker, </em>\u201cthe recognized state of the law looked to the U.S.Code as establishing maximum sentences.\u201d The statutory maximum sentence for Ingram\u2019s offense has not changed; both before and after <em>Booker </em>the statutory maximum sentence for conspiracy to commit fraud (\u00a7 371) was five years and the maximum sentence for fraud (\u00a7 1341) was 30 years. The Code provided ample notice of the potential consequences of the criminal acts to satisfy <em>ex post facto </em>principles as encompassed by Due Process Clause.</p>\n<p id=\"b817-5\">Ingram seeks to distinguish <em>Duncan </em>by asserting that she relied on <em>Blakely </em>when entering her guilty plea whereas the defendant in <em>Duncan </em>was convicted and sentenced before <em>Blakely </em>was decided. Exactly what it is in <em>Blakely </em>that Ingram claims to have relied upon is not clear: <em>Blakely </em>stated clearly that \u201c[t]he Federal Guidelines are not before us, and we express no opinion on them.\u201d <em>Blakely, </em>124 S.Ct. at 2538 n. 9. And the district court judge, before accepting Ingram\u2019s guilty plea, explained fully her sentencing exposure and the uncertainties attending application of <em>Blakely </em>if that were to come about. Ingram acknowledged her understanding. Ingram had fair warning about the possible penalties she faced; no <em>ex post facto </em>principles encompassed by the Due Process Clause were implicated.</p>\n<p id=\"b817-6\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b816-10\">. Although the <em>Ex Post Facto </em>Clause of the Fifth Amendment speaks only to changes in law resulting from legislative or executive acts, the Supreme Court has extended similar principles to the Due Process Clause to cover \"unforeseeable [judicial] construction of a criminal statute.\" <em>Bouie v. Columbia, </em>378 U.S. 347, 84 S.Ct. 1697, 1703, 12 L.Ed.2d 894 (1964). And in <em>Rogers v. Tennessee, </em>532 U.S. 451, 121 S.Ct. 1693, 149 L.Ed.2d 697(2001), the Supreme Court explained that the Due Process Clause encompasses <em>ex post facto </em>principles of fair notice, fair warning and foreseeability; these principles are \"core due process concepts\u201d in the context of criminal penalties. <em>Id. </em>at 1699. <em>See United States v. Duncan, </em>400 F.3d 1297, 1307 n. 12 (11th Cir.), <em>cert. </em>denied \u2014 U.S. \u2014, 126 S.Ct. 432, 163 L.Ed.2d 329 (2005), assuming <em>arguendo, </em>without deciding, that Roger\u2019s recognition of the applicability of <em>ex post facto </em>fair warning principles under the Due Process Clause applies to the retroactive increase of the maximum punishment for a criminal violation.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b816-19\">. Guidelines calculations were made under the 2002 Guidelines Manual.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b816-20\">. It is not entirely clear to us how Ingram arrives at this six-month figure. Although it appears to be a miscalculation in the light of her criminal history category of II, we will assume <em>arguendo </em>the correctness of her calculation.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b816-21\">. <em>Duncan </em>rejected the argument that the part of <em>Booker </em>that applied <em>Blakely v. Washington, </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"795\">*795</page-number>542 U.S. 296, 124 S.Ct. 2531, 159 L.Ed.2d 403 (2004) to the federal sentencing guidelines applies retroactively (Justice Steven\u2019s majority opinion), but the part of <em>Booker </em>that made the guidelines effectively advisory (Justice Breyer's majority opinion) has no retroactive application. 400 F.3d at 1304. As we noted, <em>Booker </em>states expressly that both holdings apply to cases on direct review. <em>Id.</em></p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
