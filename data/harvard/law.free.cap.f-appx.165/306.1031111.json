Guadalupe Olmos-Tello, a native and citizen of Mexico, appeals an order of the Board of Immigration Appeals (\u201cBIA\u201d) affirming the decision of the Immigration Judge (\u201cU\u201d) denying his applications for adjustment of removal, waiver of removal under 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1182(h), adjustment of status under 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1255(i), cancellation of removal, and voluntary departure. Olmos-Tello argues that his status should have been adjusted under 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1255(i) even though he was unlawfully present in the United States because that statutory section was passed after the Illegal Immigration Reform and Immigrant Responsibility Act, which contains the \u201cunlawful presence\u201d provisions. He also contends that because he tried to legalize his presence in the United States by filing for a visa, he should not be precluded from the 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1255(i) adjustment.</p>\n<p id=\"b329-8\">The BIA did not act arbitrarily in determining that because Olmos-Tello was inadmissible under 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1182(a)(9)(C), he was ineligible for adjustment of status under 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1255(i). <em>See Mortera-Cruz v. Gonzales, </em>409 F.3d 246, 256 (5th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. \u2014, 126 S.Ct. 733, 163 L.Ed.2d 569 (2005). Consequently, the BIA\u2019s decision regarding adjustment of Olmos-Tello\u2019s status is entitled to deference. <em>See id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b329-11\">Olmos-Tello also asserts that he has presented a <em>prima facie </em>case for waiver of removal under 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1182(h)(1)(B). His application under 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1182(h)(1)(B) is immaterial, however, to the BIA\u2019s decision to deny an adjustment of status by operation of 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1182(a)(9)(C)(i)(I), because that was the basis on which he was found removable.</p>\n<p id=\"b329-16\">Olmos-Tello argues that his due process rights were violated when the IJ failed to consider whether he was qualified for a waiver or whether his application should be considered retroactively. Eligibility for such discretionary relief is not an interest warranting constitutional due process protection. <em>See </em>8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1255(i)(2); <em>United States v. Lopez-Ortiz, </em>313 F.3d 225, 231 (5th Cir.2002).</p>\n<p id=\"b329-17\">Finally, Olmos-Tello argues that this case should be remanded to the BIA for a full opinion so that he may address the grounds of the BIA\u2019s decision and so that this court may evaluate the basis of the BIA\u2019s decision. But, the BIA\u2019s summary affirmance procedures \u201cdo not deprive this court of a basis for judicial review and ... do not violate due process.\u201d <em>Soadjede v. Ashcroft, </em>324 F.3d 830, 832-33 (5th Cir.2003). Accordingly, Olmos-Tello\u2019s argument presents no basis for relief.</p>\n<p id=\"b329-18\">The petition for review is DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b329-12\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
