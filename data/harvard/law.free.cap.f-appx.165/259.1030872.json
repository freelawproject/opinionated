We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b282-17\">A district court\u2019s evidentiary rulings are reviewed for abuse of discretion. <em>United States v. Grimmond, </em>137 F.3d 823, 831 (4th Cir.1998). Pomranky\u2019s discontent with the substance of Wilkins\u2019 testimony ignores the plain language of Fed.R.Evid. 702, which allows for an expert to testify as to his specializied knowledge in a given area if the testimony will \u201cassist the trier of fact to understand the evidence or to determine a fact in issue.\u201d Fed.R.Evid. 702. Expert testimony about common practices of drug dealers is routinely admitted in drug cases in order to help the trier of fact understand the mechanics of drug trafficking. <em>United States v. Hopkins, </em>310 F.3d 145, 151 (4th Cir.2002) (accepting expert testimony that small caliber weapon was an indicia of drug dealing); <em>United States v. Gastiaburo, </em>16 F.3d 582, 589 (4th Cir.1994) (holding district court properly admitted testimony regarding tools of the drug trade). Wilkins\u2019 testimony is comparable to testimony we have already upheld as proper expert testimony with regard to drug trafficking. In addition, the testimony was relevant to show that the drugs and firearm were likely connected and that Pomranky was in<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"261\">*261</page-number>volved with drug distribution. <em>See United States v. Ward, </em>171 F.3d 188, 195 (4th Cir.1999) (holding that firearms are well-recognized \u201ctools of the trade\u201d in the illegal drug business).</p>\n<p id=\"b283-5\">In addition, the probative value of the testimony was not outweighed by the danger of unfair prejudice. <em>See </em>Fed.R.Evid. 403. The testimony was presented in a neutral, non-inflammatory manner. In the portion objected to, Wilkins did not mention Pomranky and did not offer an opinion as to whether Pomranky\u2019s gun possession was drug-related. In addition, even if the testimony was more prejudicial than probative, any error was harmless, because the challenged evidence amounted to the general principle that drug dealers often carry guns. Pomranky had ample opportunity to prove that this general principle did not apply to him, and his defense focused, not on discrediting this testimony, but on the fact that the drugs were not his and the firearm was possessed for target practice. If the jury had accepted Pomranky\u2019s version of events, the fact that Wilkins had observed that drug dealers often use firearms would not have swayed their verdict. Thus, admission of Wilkins\u2019 testimony, designed to aid the jury\u2019s understanding of the drug business, was not erroneous.</p>\n<p id=\"b283-6\">Accordingly, we affirm Pomranky\u2019s conviction. We dispense with oral argument, because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b283-7\">\n<em>AFFIRMED</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b282-12\"> Pomranky was also convicted of possession with intent to distribute cocaine base, but he does not contest this conviction.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
