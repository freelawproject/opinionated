This appeal is governed by the Antiterrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act of 1996 (AEDPA). A judge of this Court granted a certificate of appealability (COA) on:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b763-16\">Whether the district court erred by upholding the state court\u2019s decision that the trial court did not err by failing to produce certain documents alleged to have contained material subject to disclosure pursuant to <em>Brady v. Maryland, </em>[373 U.S. 83, 83 S.Ct. 1194, 10 L.Ed.2d 215 (1963)], without independently reviewing the documents to determine if the state court\u2019s resolution of the claim was a reasonable application of federal law.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b763-17\">No reversible error has been shown; we affirm.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b763-18\">On appeal, Best does not address the issue specified in our COA: whether the district court erred in upholding the state court\u2019s rejection of his <em>Brady </em>claim without independently reviewing the documents to determine if the state court\u2019s resolution of the claim was a reasonable application of federal law. Instead, Best argues solely the underlying merits of his <em>Brady </em>claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b763-19\">We are aware that Best is <em>pro se: </em>we are lenient when interpreting the arguments of <em>pro se </em>litigants. <em>See GJR Invs., Inc. v. County of Escambia, </em>132 F.3d 1359, 1369 (11th Cir.1998). But this leniency extends only so far. We will not act as <em>de facto </em>counsel for a <em>pro se </em>litigant. <em>See id. </em>Best has abandoned the issue on which we granted a COA. <em>See Atkins v. Singletary, </em>965 F.2d 952, 955 n. 1 (11th Cir.1992) (appellant abandons issue by failing to address it properly on appeal).</p>\n<p id=\"b763-20\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b763-14\">. Best argues that we should expand the scope of the COA to include his claim that the trial court\u2019s failure to instruct the jury on lesser included offenses violated his due process rights. This Court declined to grant a COA on this issue when ruling on Best's motion for a COA: and he has offered no basis for us to reconsider that ruling.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
