He argues that the district court abused its discretion in dismissing his complaint without giving him an opportunity to amend it and without considering his objections and his post-judgment motions.</p>\n<p id=\"b387-9\">Lampkin has not shown that the district court abused its discretion in dismissing his complaint as frivolous. The record indicates that he received substantial medical care for his bunions and back pain during his incarceration. He has not shown that he would have been able to allege additional facts which would have been nonfrivolous or sufficient to state a claim if he had been allowed to file an amended complaint. Unsuccessful medical treatment, medical negligence, malpractice, or disagreement with medical treatment does not constitute deliberate indifference to serious medical needs. <em>Banuelos v. McFarland, </em>41 F.3d 232, 235 (5th Cir.1995); <em>Varnado v. Lynaugh, </em>920 F.2d 320, 321 (5th Cir.1991). Because he has not shown that the defendants were deliberately indifferent to his serious medical needs, the district court did not abuse its discretion in dismissing his complaint as frivolous. <em>See Banuelos, </em>41 F.3d at 235; <em>Varnado, </em>920 F.2d at 321. Further, the district court implicitly considered his objections to the magistrate judge\u2019s report and considered and denied his post-judgment motions.</p>\n<p id=\"b387-13\">Lampkin\u2019s appeal is without arguable merit and, therefore, is dismissed as frivolous. <em>See Howard v. King, </em>707 F.2d 215, 219-20 (5th Cir.1983); 5TH CIR. R. 42.2. The district court\u2019s dismissal of his complaint and the dismissal of this appeal count as strikes under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(g). <em>See Adepegba v. Hammons, </em>103 F.3d 383, 387-88 (5th Cir.1996). Lampkin is cautioned that if he accumulates three strikes under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(g), he will not be able to proceed in forma pauperis in any civil action or appeal filed while he is incarcerated or detained in any facility unless he is under imminent danger of serious physical injury. <em>See </em>28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(g). Lampkin\u2019s motions for oral argument and extraordinary relief are also denied.</p>\n<p id=\"b387-14\">APPEAL DISMISSED; MOTIONS DENIED; SANCTION WARNING ISSUED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b387-10\"> Pursuant to 5TH CIR. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5TH CIR. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
