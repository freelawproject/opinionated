Due to the passage of the REAL ID Act while this appeal was pending, Betancourt-Ramirez\u2019s petition for a writ of habeas corpus is converted into a timely filed petition for review of the BIA decision. Because we conclude that Betancourt-Ramirez\u2019s conviction for possession of a controlled substance constituted an aggravated felony, his petition is DENIED.</p>\n<p id=\"b392-18\">BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b392-19\">\u2022 Luis Betancourt-Ramirez, a citizen and national of Mexico, entered the United States as an immigrant in 1970. On May 21, 1997, in Texas state court, BetancourtRamirez pleaded guilty to the possession of a controlled substance, a felony. On June 19, 2003, Betancourt-Ramirez was convicted of criminal negligent homicide in Texas state court. The Department of Homeland Security initiated removal proceedings against Betancourt-Ramirez on July 22, 2003, and an immigration judge ultimately determined that he was removable as an alien convicted of an aggravated felony under 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1227(a)(2)(A)(iii). The immigration judge found BetancourtRamirez\u2019s conviction for possession of a controlled substance \u2014 but not his criminal negligent homicide conviction \u2014 to be an aggravated felony.</p>\n<p id=\"b392-20\">Betancourt-Ramirez appealed to the BIA, which affirmed the immigration judge and dismissed his case. He then petitioned the district court for habeas relief. The district court, citing 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(a)(2)(C), concluded that it lacked jurisdiction over Betancourt \u2014 Ramirez\u2019s pe<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"371\">*371</page-number>tition, and therefore denied relief. Betancourt-Ramirez again appealed, and this court may review the decision of the district court pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291.</p>\n<p id=\"b393-5\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b393-6\">Betancourt-Ramirez originally sought habeas relief through the courts. However, the REAL ID Act, PUB. L. NO. 109-13,119 STAT. 231 (MAY 11, 2005) divested the federal courts of jurisdiction to hear habeas petitions attacking removal orders, effective as of the Act\u2019s passage. This court recently held in <em>Rosales v. Bureau of Immigrations &amp; Customs Enforcement, </em>426 F.3d 733 (5th Cir.2005), that habeas petitions on appeal as of May 11, 2005, such as Betancourt-Ramirez\u2019s, \u201care properly converted into petitions for review.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 736. Following <em>Rosales, </em>Betancourt-Ramirez\u2019s petition for habeas relief is thus converted into a petition for review of the underlying BIA decision, and because his petition addresses \u201cconstitutional claims or questions of law,\u201d this court has jurisdiction under 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(b)(2)(D) to reach the merits of his challenge. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b393-7\">On a petition for review of a BIA decision, we review the BIA\u2019s rulings of law de novo. <em>Lopez-Gomez v. Ashcroft, </em>263 F.3d 442, 444 (5th Cir.2001). We review the BIA\u2019s findings of fact for substantial evidence. <em>Tesfamichael v. Gonzales, </em>411 F.3d 169, 175 (5th Cir.2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b393-8\">The BIA held that Betancourt-Ramirez was an alien convicted of an aggravated felony within the meaning of 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1101(a)(43)(B), and was therefore ineligible for cancellation of removal. With regard to drug-related crimes, it is established law in this circuit that if a \u201cdefendant\u2019s prior conviction was a felony under applicable state law and was punishable under the [federal] Controlled Substances Act,\u201d then such a conviction qualifies as an aggravated felony for the purposes of \u00a7 1101(a)(43)(B). <em>United States v. Hernandez-Avalos, </em>251 F.3d 505, 508 (5th Cir.2001); <em>see also United States v. Hinojosa-Lopez, </em>130 F.3d 691, 693-94 (5th Cir.1997) (state felony punishable under Controlled Substances Act constitutes aggravated felony for purposes of Federal Sentencing Guidelines). There is no dispute here that Betancourt-Ramirez\u2019s 1997 conviction was for a felony in the state of Texas, or that possession of cocaine is punishable under the Controlled Substances Act. Under <em>Hemandez-Avalos, </em>Betancourt-Ramirez committed an aggravated felony for the purposes of \u00a7 1101(a)(43)(B), and he was therefore ineligible for cancellation of removal.</p>\n<p id=\"b393-10\">However, B etancourt-Ramir ez notes that in 1997, at the time he pleaded guilty to possession of a controlled substance, he would have been eligible to apply for cancellation of removal under Immigration and Nationality Act \u00a7 240A. He therefore argues that the BIA\u2019s retroactive application of <em>Hemandez-Avalos </em>is unconstitutional. This argument fails, however, as \u201cit is well settled that Congress has the authority to make past criminal activity a new ground for deportation.\u201d <em>United States v. Madriz-Alvarado, </em>383 F.3d 321, 334 (5th Cir.2004)(quoting <em>Ignacio v. INS, </em>955 F.2d 295, 298 (5th Cir.1992)). <em>Madriz-Alvarado </em>guides our analysis here; in that case, an alien challenged the application of 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1101(a)(48)(A), which defined the term \u201cconviction,\u201d as being unconstitutionally retroactive. The alien argued that at the time of his deferred adjudication, BIA precedent did not make such deferred adjudication a \u201cconviction.\u201d <em>Madriz-Alvarado, </em>383 F.3d at 334. The <em>Madriz-Alvarado </em>court denied habeas, however, noting that Congress had the broad authority to define the scope of immigration law, and could render an alien deportable \u201cfor past antisocial conduct that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"372\">*372</page-number>not only did not result in a conviction but was not even criminal when engaged in.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 335. Betancourt-Ramirez makes a nearly identical argument here, claiming that the definition of \u201caggravated felony\u201d under 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1101(a) as interpreted by <em>Hinojosa-Lopez </em>and <em>Hemandez-Avalos, </em>cannot be retroactively applied to his 1997 conviction. As with <em>Madriz-Alvarado, </em>Betancourt-Ramirez\u2019s constitutional challenge must be rejected.</p>\n<p id=\"b394-4\">CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b394-5\">Betancourt-Ramirez\u2019s 1997 conviction for possession of cocaine constitutes an aggravated felony for the purposes of 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1101(a)(43)(B). As a result, he is ineligible to apply for cancellation of removal, and his petition for review is DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b392-16\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
