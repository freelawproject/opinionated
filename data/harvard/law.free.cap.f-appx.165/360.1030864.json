A certificate of appealability was granted on the issue whether Heckler\u2019s counsel was ineffective for failing to file a notice of appeal. Heckler argues that he should be granted an out-of-time appeal because he expressly asked counsel to file a notice of appeal and counsel failed to do so.</p>\n<p id=\"b383-11\">To demonstrate ineffective assistance of counsel based on a claim that counsel failed to file a notice of appeal, a defendant must show that the failure to file fell below an objective standard of reasonableness and that it prejudiced the defendant. <em>See Roe v. Flores-Ortega, </em>528 U.S. 470, 484, 120 S.Ct. 1029, 145 L.Ed.2d 985 (2000). Failing to file a notice when requested to do so can constitute deficient performance. <em>Id. </em>at 477-78, 120 S.Ct. 1029. As to prejudice, the defendant need not demonstrate that he would have been able to raise meritorious issues on appeal. <em>Id. </em>at 486, 120 S.Ct. 1029. Rather, he must demonstrate only that there is a reasonable probability that, but for counsel\u2019s failure, he would have appealed. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b383-16\">The record establishes that Heckler lost his right to appeal because his notice of appeal was untimely. Heckler\u2019s <em>pro se </em>notice of appeal demonstrates that he wanted to appeal. The affidavit that Heckler filed to counter the Government\u2019s motion to dismiss his direct appeal does not address whether he expressly told counsel that he wished to appeal. In the affidavit that Heckler submitted with the instant motion, he attested under penalty of perjury that after he received his sentence he immediately told counsel that he wanted to appeal. Contrary to the Government\u2019s argument, Heckler\u2019s two affidavits are not contradictory inasmuch as he could have told counsel of his desire to appeal and, after not being able to contact counsel, could have also attempted to file his own notice of appeal via his codefendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b383-17\">A district court may deny a \u00a7 2255 motion without conducting a hearing only \u201cif the motion, files, and records of the case conclusively show that the prisoner is entitled to no relief.\u201d <em>United States v. Bartholomew, </em>974 F.2d 39, 41 (5th Cir.1992). The record does not conclusively show that Heckler is entitled to no relief on this claim. Contested factual issues may not be decided on the basis of affidavits alone <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"362\">*362</page-number>unless the affidavits are supported by other evidence in the record. <em>United States v. Hughes, </em>635 F.2d 449, 451 (5th Cir.1981). Given that the Government contests Heckler\u2019s claim, the denial of Heckler\u2019s 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255 motion is vacated and the case is remanded for an evidentiary hearing on Heckler\u2019s claim that he instructed counsel to file a notice of appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b384-4\">VACATED and REMANDED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b383-12\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
