Urbina argues that the district court committed reversible plain error when it enhanced his sentence pursuant to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2L1.2(b)(l)(A)(ii) based on his prior conviction, in Kentucky state court, for sexual abuse.</p>\n<p id=\"b325-17\">The Government argues that Urbina waived his right to raise this argument on appeal by \u201cknowingly and intentionally\u201d failing to raise the issue during sentencing. Alternatively, the Government seeks to enforce the waiver of appeal executed by Urbina in the plea agreement. We reject both contentions. <em>See United States v. McKinney, </em>406 F.3d 744, 746 (5th Cir.2005); Fed.R.CrimP. 11(b)(1)(N).</p>\n<p id=\"b325-18\">Under the 2004 version of \u00a7 2L1.2(b)(l)(A)(ii), a person convicted of illegal reentry faces a 16-level increase in their base offense level if, prior to deportation, they were convicted of a felony that is \u201ca crime of violence.\u201d The term \u201ccrime of violence means any of the following: forcible sex offenses ... or any offense under federal, state, or local law that has an element of use, attempted use, or threatened use of physical force against the person of another.\u201d \u00a7 2L1.2, comment. (n.l(b)(iii)).</p>\n<p id=\"b325-19\">When, as here, the statute to which Urbina pleaded guilty contained multiple, disjunctive subsections, a district court may \u201clook beyond the statute to certain \u2018conclusive records made or used in adjudicating guilt\u2019 in order to determine which particular statutory alternative applies to the defendant\u2019s conviction.\u201d <em>United States v. Gonzalez-Chavez, </em>432 F.3d 334, 337-38 (5th Cir.2005) (internal quotation and citation omitted). \u201cThese records are generally limited to the \u2018charging document, written plea agreement, transcript of the plea colloquy, and any explicit factual finding by the trial judge to which the defendant assented.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>(citing <em>Shepard v. United States, 544 U.S. 13, 125 </em>S.Ct. 1254, 1257, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"304\">*304</page-number>161 L.Ed.2d 205 (2005)). \u201cReliance on the PSR will not suffice.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b326-4\">Although the defendant in <em>Gonzalez-Chavez </em>was raising his challenge to the application of \u00a7 2L1.2(b)(l)(A)(ii) for the first time on appeal, we refused to consider facts contained in the PSR which related to the alleged conduct of the prior offense. <em>Id. </em>Because the record contained no other documents upon which it could rely to determine whether the prior offense fit under the definition of a crime of violence, we remanded the case for resentencing. <em>Id. </em>at 337-39.</p>\n<p id=\"b326-5\">The instant case is controlled by <em>Gonzalez-Chavez, </em>432 F.3d at 337-38. Accordingly, we VACATE the sentence and REMAND for resentencing.</p>\n<p id=\"b326-6\">Urbina also argues that the \u201cfelony\u201d and \u201caggravated felony\u201d provisions of 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1326(b)(1) and (2) are unconstitutional in light of <em>Apprendi v. New Jersey, </em>530 U.S. 466, 120 S.Ct. 2348, 147 L.Ed.2d 435 (2000). Urbina\u2019s argument is foreclosed by <em>Almendarez-Torres v. United States, </em>523 U.S. 224, 235, 118 S.Ct. 1219, 140 L.Ed.2d 350 (1998). Although Urbina contends that <em>Almendarez-Torres </em>was incorrectly decided and that a majority of the Supreme Court would overrule <em>Almendarez-Torres </em>in light of <em>Apprendi, </em>we have repeatedly rejected such arguments on the basis that <em>Almendarez-Torres </em>remains binding. <em>See United States v. Garza-Lopez, </em>410 F.3d 268, 276 (5th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. \u2014, 126 S.Ct. 298, 163 L.Ed.2d 260 (2005). Urbina properly concedes that his argument is foreclosed in light of <em>Almendarez-Torres </em>and circuit precedent, but he raises it here to preserve it for further review.</p>\n<p id=\"b326-12\">VACATE AND REMAND FOR RE-SENTENCING.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b325-13\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
