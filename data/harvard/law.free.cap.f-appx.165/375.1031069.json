Webb, Jr. (\u2018Webb\u201d), Texas prisoner # 1051215, appeals the district court\u2019s dismissal in part of his federal writ of habeas corpus pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254. Specifically, the district court dismissed Webb\u2019s ineffectiveness claim relating to the validity of his guilty plea as time-barred. Webb filed his federal petition for writ of habeas corpus to challenge his 60-year sentence for aggravated robbery. This court granted a certificate of appealability (\u201cCOA\u201d) on whether the district court erred in dismissing Webb\u2019s federal writ application in part as time-barred under the Antiterrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act (\u201cAEDPA\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b398-5\">Webb believes that the district court miscalculated the limitation period because the respondent had determined that he was four days late, and the district court had essentially given him four days\u2019 credit on the filing date of his \u00a7 2254 application (from July 29, 2003, to July 25, 2003). Webb misstates the record. The respondent determined that Webb was <em>five </em>days late. The district court and the respondent both determined that July 24, 2003, was the last day to file a timely \u00a7 2254 application. Webb has not identified any other error with respect to the district court\u2019s limitation calculation.</p>\n<p id=\"b398-6\">Webb also argues that he is entitled to equitable tolling of the AEDPA\u2019s time limitations period. Specifically, he asserts that he is entitled to equitable tolling from July 5, 2002, the date he delivered his state writ application to prison officials for mailing, to July 18, 2002, the date it was stamped by the Clerk as filed. Webb further argues that he is entitled to equitable tolling due to the limited resources available to pro se litigants and because he diligently pursued his 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254 relief.</p>\n<p id=\"b398-11\">The district court\u2019s determination that Webb is not entitled to equitable tolling was not an abuse of discretion. Equitable tolling of the AEDPA\u2019s one-year limitations period is appropriate only in \u201crare and exceptional circumstances.\u201d <em>Felder v. Johnson, </em>204 F.3d 168, 170-71 (5th Cir.2000) (internal quotation marks and citation omitted). Webb is under the impression that he is entitled to the mailbox rule regarding his state writ application. However, this court has declined to extend the mailbox rule to determine the filing dates for state habeas corpus petitions. <em>See Coleman v. Johnson, </em>184 F.3d 398, 402 (5th Cir.1999). Further, Webb\u2019s assertion that he diligently pursued his 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254 relief is not supported by the record. As the district court noted, Webb did not seek post-conviction relief until 11 months after his conviction had become final. Webb offers no explanation for his delay other than his conclusional allegation that he is a pro se litigant with limited resources. Webb has failed to demonstrate such rare and exceptional circumstances so as to warrant equitable tolling. <em>See Ott v. Johnson, </em>192 F.3d 510, 513 (5th Cir.1999). Accordingly, the district court did not abuse its discretion in rejecting his equitable tolling arguments. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b398-12\">Based on the foregoing, the judgment of the district court dismissing Webb\u2019s ineffectiveness claim relating to the validity of his guilty plea as time-barred is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b398-7\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
