On appeal, Vivas-Rengefo, who was charged with three codefendants, Paulino Jiminez-Biojo, Christian Balereso, and Alexandre Anchico, argues the district court erred by refusing to grant him a two-level, minor-role reduction, pursuant to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3B1.2. He as<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"784\">*784</page-number>serts his participation in the offense was minor when compared to the owners of the cocaine because he only transported it and did not have an equity interest. He also urges that because he was less culpable than the scheme\u2019s organizers and recruiters, he was entitled to the reduction and the district court erroneously based his sentence on how the court previously had handled similar cases.</p>\n<p id=\"b806-4\">We review a district court\u2019s factual findings regarding a defendant\u2019s role in the offense for clear error. <em>United States v. De Varon, </em>175 F.3d 930, 937 (11th Cir.1999) <em>(en </em>banc). \u201cSo long as the basis of the trial court\u2019s decision is supported by the record <em>and </em>does not involve a misapplication of a rule of law, we believe that it will be rare for an appellate court to conclude that the sentencing court\u2019s determination is clearly erroneous.\u201d <em>De Varon, </em>175 F.3d at 945.</p>\n<p id=\"b806-5\">The Guidelines provide for a two-level decrease where the defendant was a minor participant in any criminal activity. <em>See </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3B1.2(b). A minor participant is defined as \u201cany participant who is less culpable than most other participants, but whose role could not be described as minimal.\u201d U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3B1.2, comment, (n.3). To determine whether the adjustment applies, a district court first should measure the defendant\u2019s role against the conduct for which he has been held accountable. <em>See De Varon, </em>175 F.3d at 934. With regard to drug couriers, this Comet has indicated that its holding in <em>De Var\u00f3n </em>\u201c[did] not create a presumption that drug couriers are never minor or minimal participants, any more than that they are always minor or minimal,\u201d but \u201c[r]ather ... [established] only that the district court must assess all of the facts probative of the defendant\u2019s role in [his] relevant conduct in evaluating the defendant\u2019s role in the offense.\u201d <em>United States v. Boyd, </em>291 F.3d 1274, 1277 (11th Cir.2002). In drug courier cases, \u201cthe amount of drugs imported is a material consideration in assessing a defendant\u2019s role in [his] relevant conduct\u201d and \u201cmay be dispositive \u2014 in and of itself \u2014 in the extreme case.\u201d <em>De Varon, </em>175 F.3d at 943.</p>\n<p id=\"b806-8\">Second, where there is sufficient evidence, a court also may measure the defendant\u2019s conduct against that of other participants in the criminal scheme attributed to the defendant. <em>See id. </em>In making this inquiry, a district court should look to other participants only to the extent that they (1) are identifiable or discernable from the evidence, and (2) were involved in the relevant conduct attributed to the defendant. <em>See id. </em>at 944 (stating that \u201c[t]he conduct of participants in any larger criminal conspiracy is irrelevant\u201d). Moreover, \u201cthe amount of drugs imported is a material consideration in assessing a defendant\u2019s role in [his] relevant conduct.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 943.</p>\n<p id=\"b806-9\">Here, the relevant conduct attributed to Vivas-Rengefo at sentencing was the importation and possession of approximately 3,588 pounds of cocaine, which represented the amount of cocaine found on the vessel when it was intercepted with Vivas-Rengefo onboard. Indeed, VivasRengefo <em>admitted </em>at his plea colloquy that he was found on a vessel with 3,588 pounds of cocaine, <em>and </em>that he knowingly and intentionally possessed the cocaine and intended to distribute it. These activities demonstrate that he participated in transporting the drugs, and that his role was not minor in the relevant conduct of possession and conspiracy to possess with intent to distribute over five kilograms of cocaine. <em>See De Varon, </em>175 F.3d at 944. Therefore, the first principle of <em>De Var\u00f3n </em>precludes a minor role reduction.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b807-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"785\">*785</page-number>\u201cSo long as the basis of the trial court\u2019s decision is supported by the record <em>and </em>does not involve a misapplication of a rule of law, we believe that it will be rare for an appellate court to conclude that the sentencing court\u2019s determination is clearly erroneous.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 945 (emphasis in original). Here, we cannot find clear error in the district court\u2019s conclusion that VivasRengefo played an integral role in the charged offenses and, accordingly, was not entitled to a minor-role reduction, pursuant to our decision in <em>De Var\u00f3n.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b807-5\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b806-6\">. Given Vivas-Renfego's failure to carry his burden on the first prong, we need not reach <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"785\">*785</page-number>the second <em>De Var\u00f3n </em>prong, but we nevertheless observe that this second principle would also defeat the award of a minor-role reduction here. With the possible exception of co-conspirator Jiminez-Biojo, who claimed that he was the boat's captain, VivasVivas-Rengefo\u2019s conduct was identical to that of his codefendants. The conduct of others who were involved in the overall scheme of transporting and selling cocaine \u2014 the organizers or recruiters or those with an equity interest in the cocaine \u2014 is irrelevant to the assessment of Vivas-Rengefo\u2019s role, as he is not charged with a larger conspiracy to import or distribute drugs, and, in any event, these individuals are not identifiable from the evidence. <em>See DeVaron, </em>175 F.3d at 944.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
