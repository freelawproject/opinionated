For the reasons that follow, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b341-11\">I. FACTS AND PROCEEDINGS</p>\n<p id=\"b341-12\">Kelvin Paul Wells, Sr., litigated various civil cases within the 19th Judicial District Court of East Baton Rouge Parish, Louisiana.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> In at least two of the actions from which Wells\u2019s complaint arises, he was allowed to proceed <em>in forma pauperis </em>during a portion of the proceedings.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Subsequently, in both actions, the Louisiana courts revoked Wells\u2019s pauper status.</p>\n<p id=\"b341-15\">During the course of the previous litigation, Wells was cast with costs by the Louisiana courts and assessed with filing fees by defendants-appellees (the \u201cClerk\u201d). After his pauper status had been revoked, Wells attempted to file motions to proceed again <em>in forma pauperis. </em>On both occasions, the motions, which accompanied several other pleadings, were sent to the Clerk by facsimile transmission and were received on December 11 and 18, 2002, respectively. After receiving each of these transmissions, the Clerk acknowledged receipt of the filings and sent a notice that the original signed document and the applicable fees should be forwarded to the Clerk within five days, pursuant to La.Rev. Stat. \u00a7 13:850. When, on December 23, 2002, the originals and the outstanding balance due had not been delivered, the Clerk returned the pleadings to Wells.</p>\n<p id=\"b341-16\">The district court found that the Clerk\u2019s refusal to file the motion to proceed <em>in forma pauperis, </em>if it could be proven, was a violation of Wells\u2019s right to access the court under the Due Process and Equal Protection clauses of the Fourteenth Amendment. However, the district court determined that the Clerk was entitled to qualified immunity because the constitutional right in question was not so clearly established that a reasonable official would understand that the official\u2019s actions violated a constitutional right. On the basis of this finding, the district court granted the Clerk\u2019s motion for summary judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b341-17\">II. STANDARD OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b341-18\">This court reviews a district court\u2019s grant of summary judgment <em>de novo. </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"320\">*320</page-number><em>Cooper Tire &amp; Rubber Co. v. Farese, </em>423 F.3d 446, 454 (5th Cir.2005) (citing <em>Ford Motor Co. v. Tex. Dep\u2019t of Transp., </em>264 F.3d 493, 498 (5th Cir.2001)); <em>Bryan v. McKinsey &amp; Co., </em>375 F.3d 358, 360 (5th Cir.2004) (citing <em>Boston Old Colony Ins. Co. v. Tiner Assocs., Inc., </em>288 F.3d 222, 227 (5th Cir.2002)). In our review of a summary judgment, we apply the same standard as the district court. <em>Cooper Tire, </em>423 F.3d at 454. Summary judgment is appropriate if there are no genuine issues of material fact and the movant is entitled to a judgment as a matter of law. <em>Id. </em>(quoting Fed.R.Civ.P. 56(c)).</p>\n<p id=\"b342-4\">A court considering a motion for summary judgment must view evidence and inferences in the light most favorable to the nonmovant. <em>Bryan, </em>375 F.3d at 360; <em>Moreno v. Summit Mortgage Corp., </em>364 F.3d 574, 576 (5th Cir.2004). Moreover, \u201c[a] material fact is one that might affect the outcome of the suit under the governing law and a dispute about a material fact is genuine ... if the evidence is such that a reasonable jury could return a verdict for the nonmoving party.\u201d <em>Instone Travel Tech Marine &amp; Offshore v. Int\u2019l Shipping Partners, Inc., </em>334 F.3d 423, 427 (5th Cir.2003) (internal quotations omitted). The burden falls on the movant to demonstrate \u201can absence of evidence to support the nonmoving party\u2019s case.\u201d <em>Celestine v. Petroleos de Venezuella SA, </em>266 F.3d 343, 349 (5th Cir.2001) (citing <em>Celotex Corp. v. Catrett, </em>477 U.S. 317, 325, 106 S.Ct. 2548, 91 L.Ed.2d 265 (1986)). If the movant meets this burden, \u201ca nonmovant must bring forward sufficient evidence to demonstrate that a genuine issue of material fact exists for every element of a claim.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(citing <em>Fontenot v. Upjohn Co., </em>780 F.2d 1190, 1196 (5th Cir.1986)). Summary judgment is appropriate if the nonmovant \u201cfail[ed] to make a showing sufficient to establish the existence of an element essential to that party\u2019s case, and on which that party will bear the burden of proof at trial.\u201d <em>Celotex Corp., </em>477 U.S. at 322, 106 S.Ct. 2548. <em>See also Instone Travel, </em>334 F.3d at 427.</p>\n<p id=\"b342-7\">III. DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b342-8\">The district court ruled that the Clerk did violate Wells\u2019s constitutional right, but the right was not sufficiently well established to make the Clerk aware of the violation.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> As a result, the district court found the Clerk entitled to qualified immunity and granted summary judgment in favor of the Clerk. The district court\u2019s conclusion, with respect to the constitutional violation, depends on its finding that the Clerk, on December 11 and 18, 2002, refused to file Wells\u2019s pleadings, which included a motion to proceed <em>in forma pauperis, </em>due to Wells\u2019s failure to pay outstanding fees. The undisputed facts do not support this finding.</p>\n<p id=\"b343-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"321\">*321</page-number>In Louisiana, litigants in a civil action may file pleadings by facsimile. <em>See </em>La. Rev.Stat. \u00a7 13:850. However, with the privilege of using facsimile transmission comes additional duties, which are not attendant if a litigant simply files an original pleading with the court. For a facsimile pleading to be entitled to the same force and effect as an original pleading, the party filing the document must, within five business days, provide (1) the original signed document, (2) the applicable filing fee, if any, and (3) a transmission fee of five dollars. La.Rev.Stat. \u00a7 13:850(B).<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> If the party filing a document fails to comply with these conditions, \u201cthe facsimile filing shall have no force or effect.\u201d La.Rev. Stat. \u00a7 13:850(C). Nevertheless, when an original document has been presented within the allotted time, Louisiana specifically permits a litigant to file a motion to proceed <em>in forma pauperis </em>in lieu of paying applicable fees. <em>See Tenney v. Burlington Northern &amp; Sante Fe Ry. Co., </em>03-1260, p. 4 (La.1/21/04); 863 So.2d 526, 528 (holding that, where the litigant submitted the original pleading within the time allotted, \u201can application to proceed <em>in forma pauperis </em>satisfies the requirement of [La.Rev.Stat. \u00a7 ] 13:850 that applicable filing fees and a transmission fee be paid within five days of a facsimile filing\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b343-11\">In his complaint, Wells alleged that he had been denied access to the courts when the Clerk returned and ignored his pleadings. His motion for summary judgment did not identify any specific facts in support of his claim, but purported to adopt the entire record in the various state court proceedings and incorporate them as a \u201ctrue history of facts.\u201d By contrast, in the Clerk\u2019s statement of uncontested facts, the Clerk provided the district court with a lengthy history of the state court proceedings, all supported by record evidence. In response to the Clerk\u2019s statement and documentation, Wells failed to controvert any of the Clerk\u2019s facts, except to assert, again without specific support in the record, that the Clerk was attempting to \u201cmislead\u201d the court.</p>\n<p id=\"b343-12\">In the statement of uncontested facts, the Clerk maintained that Wells\u2019s pleadings, which were submitted by facsimile, were returned unfiled because (1) the applicable fees had not been paid and (2) the originals were not provided within five days as required by law. Wells did not controvert this statement, nor does he challenge it on appeal.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> The Clerk has <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"322\">*322</page-number>established that his refusal to file the pleadings was not simply due to Wells\u2019s purported inability to pay applicable fees, but was due to Wells\u2019s failure to provide the originals of the pleadings. Had Wells provided the originals, under the rationale of <em>Tenney, </em>the Clerk would have been obligated to file the pleadings regardless of any outstanding amounts due because Wells\u2019s motion to proceed <em>in forma pauperis </em>would have satisfied the payment requirements of La.Rev.Stat. \u00a7 13:850(B). However, having failed to submit the original signed documents, Wells prevented the Clerk from filing the pleadings.</p>\n<p id=\"b344-4\">While Wells may have shown that he was denied the ability to file pleadings by facsimile without providing the originals and applicable fees, he has failed to show that he was unconstitutionally denied access to the courts. To conclude, as the district court did, that the Clerk\u2019s refusal to file Wells\u2019s facsimile pleadings violated his constitutional right of access to the courts, would be to hold that litigants have a constitutional right to file pleadings <em>by facsimile. </em>There is no authority in support of such a holding, and, on these facts, this court will not hold that such a right exists.</p>\n<p id=\"b344-5\">IY. CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b344-6\">Because the undisputed facts in the record support a judgment as a matter of law in favor of the defendants-appellees, we AFFIRM.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b341-13\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b341-14\">. The district court\u2019s ruling on summary judgment sets out the details of the state court proceedings.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b341-19\"><em>. </em>In one, the Clerk filed Wells\u2019s motions to proceed <em>in forma pauperis, </em>despite the fact that Wells was in arrears for over $2000 at the time of filing. The motions were subsequently denied by the Louisiana courts.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b342-5\">. According to the district court, the only potential constitutional violations occurred in the prosecution of the divorce petition and subsequent contempt proceedings relating to the enforcement of the visitation agreement. These events took place on December 11 and 18, 2002, respectively. Wells does not contest this finding, and we limit our review to the two instances identified by the district court. The district court also declined to exercise supplemental jurisdiction over the state law claims. Wells does not contest this decision, and we, therefore, do not reach those claims.</p>\n<p id=\"AEc\">With respect to Wells's claims of racial and sexual discrimination, the district court pointed out that Wells had failed to identify any evidence of discrimination due to race. The district court held that Wells \"cannot show that he was treated differently from persons outside of his protected class.\" The same is true for his sex discrimination claim. The summary judgment evidence showed that the Clerk acted in accord with the policies of the office and the laws of Louisiana. Wells has failed to show anything different. Summary judgment is appropriate for those claims.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b343-5\">. La.Rev.Stat. \u00a7 13:850 provides, in part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b343-6\">A.
