Booker, </em>543 U.S. 220, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005), was unreasonable. He argues <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"732\">*732</page-number>that the district court in sentencing him was required to consider \u00a7 3553(a) factors, including the advisory statements found in Chapter 7 of the Guidelines.</p>\n<p id=\"b754-4\">When the district court imposes a sentence beyond the Chapter Seven Guideline range, we review for an abuse of discretion. <em>United States v. Aguillard, </em>217 F.3d 1319, 1320 (11th Cir.2000). Because Carpenter did not object to his sentence below, we review his argument for plain error. <em>Id. </em>Under plain error review, there must be (1) an error, (2) that is plain, and (3) affects substantial rights. <em>Id. </em>When these three factors are met, we may then exercise our discretion and correct the error if it seriously affects the fairness, integrity, or public reputation of the judicial proceedings. <em>United States v. Olano, </em>507 U.S. 725, 732, 113 S.Ct. 1770, 1776, 123 L.Ed.2d 508 (1993).</p>\n<p id=\"b754-5\">In <em>United States v. Booker, </em>the Supreme Court held that the mandatory nature of the Federal Sentencing Guidelines rendered them incompatible with the Sixth Amendment\u2019s guarantee to the right to a jury trial. 543 U.S. 220, 125 S.Ct. 738, 749-51, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005). The Court concluded that, to best preserve Congress\u2019s intent in enacting the Sentencing Reform Act of 1984, the appropriate remedy was to \u201cexcise\u201d two specific sections \u2014 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(b)(1) (requiring a sentence within the guideline range, absent a departure) and 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3742(e) (establishing standards of review on appeal, including <em>de novo </em>review of departures from the applicable guideline range) \u2014 thereby effectively rendering the Sentencing Guidelines advisory only. <em>Id. </em>125 S.Ct. at 764. The Court explained that, \u201c[wjithout the \u2018mandatory\u2019 provision, the Act nonetheless requires judges to take account of the Guidelines together with other sentencing goals\u201d contained in 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> <em>Id. </em>The Court indicated that both its \u201cSixth Amendment holding and ... remedial interpretation of the Sentencing Act\u201d must be applied to \u201call cases on direct review.\u201d <em>Id. </em>125 S.Ct. at 769.</p>\n<p id=\"b754-8\">In a <em>post-Booker </em>opinion, we stated that the district court, upon finding that a defendant violated a condition of supervised release, may revoke a term of supervised release and require the defendant to serve in prison all or part of the term of supervised release after considering the factors set forth in \u00a7 3553(a). <em>United States v. White, </em>416 F.3d 1313, 1318 (11th Cir.2005). We noted that one of factors a court must consider is the sentencing range established by the applicable Guidelines or policy statements issued by the Sentencing Commission. <em>Id. </em>However, we noted that \u201cthe Sentencing Commission has not yet promulgated any binding probation revocation guidelines; instead, the Sentencing Commission has opted for the flexibility of advisory policy statements, which are nonbinding on the courts.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(quotations and alteration omitted). Even before <em>Booker, </em>so long as there was some indication that the district court had considered the Guidelines before imposing a sentence outside of the Chapter 7 recommended range, the sentence would be upheld. <em>Aguillard, </em>217 F.3d at 1320. Moreover, just as the Sentencing Guidelines for revocation have always been advisory, <em>Booker </em>also allows for sentencing based on factors <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"733\">*733</page-number>in \u00a7 3553(a), applying the Guidelines as advisory. <em>See Booker, </em>125 S.Ct. at 743.</p>\n<p id=\"b755-5\">Section 7B1.4 of the Chapter Seven policy statements of the Guidelines, provides the range of imprisonment applicable upon revocation of probation or supervised release. U.S.S.G. \u00a7 7B1.4(a). A violation of a condition of supervised release constitutes a Grade C violation. U.S.S.G. \u00a7 7Bl.l(a)(3). The applicable range in Carpenter\u2019s case, where he committed a grade C violation of his supervised release and had an original criminal history category of I, was three to nine months\u2019 imprisonment. U.S.S.G. \u00a7 7B1.4(a). Under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3583(e)(3), \u201cthe court may, after considering the factors set forth in\u201d \u00a7 3553(a), revoke a term of supervised release if it finds by a preponderance of the evidence that the defendant violated a condition of supervised release and, if the offense that resulted in the supervised release is a class B felony,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> impose a term of imprisonment not to exceed three years.</p>\n<p id=\"b755-6\">In the instant case, Carpenter is unable to show that the district court committed plain error in sentencing him beyond the Chapter Seven Guideline range. First, the Guidelines ranges provided in U.S.S.G. \u00a7 7B1.4(a) are advisory, and, as such, the district court is not required to impose a sentence within the recommended range. <em>See White, </em>416 F.3d at 1318. Second, because Carpenter committed a Grade B felony, the 18-month sentence did not exceed the statutory maximum. <em>See </em>18 U.S.C. 3583(e)(3). Third, while the court is required to consider the factors in \u00a7 3553(a) before revoking supervised release, there is no requirement, contrary to Carpenter\u2019s assertion, that the court explicitly articulate its consideration of each and every one of the factors. We have held \u201cthat nothing in <em>Booker or </em>elsewhere requires the district court to state on the record that it has explicitly considered each of the \u00a7 3553(a) factors or to discuss each of the \u00a7 3553(a) factors.\u201d <em>United States v. Scott, </em>426 F.3d 1324, 1329 (11th Cir.2005). Fourth, the record reflects that the district court judge did adequately consider the Guidelines before imposing his sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b755-10\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b753-19\">.

Section 3553(a) provides that district courts imposing a sentence must first consider, <em>inter alia, </em>the nature and circumstances of the offense, the history and characteristics of the defendant, the need for the sentence to reflect the seriousness of the offense, promote respect for the law, and provide just punishment for the offense, and the kinds of sentences and sentencing range established by the Guidelines. <em>See </em>18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b755-7\">.
