Due\u00f1as argues that his sentence should be vacated and remanded because the district court sentenced him under the mandatory Guidelines scheme held unconstitutional in <em>United States v. Booker, </em>543 U.S. 220, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b396-25\">Because the district court sentenced Due\u00f1as under a mandatory Guidelines regime, it committed <em>Fanfan </em>error. <em>See United States v. Valenzuela-Quevedo, </em>407 F.3d 728, 733 (5th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. \u2014, 126 S.Ct. 267, 163 L.Ed.2d 240 (2005); <em>see also United States v. Walters, </em>418 F.3d 461, 463 (5th Cir.2005)(discussing the difference between Sixth Amendment <em>Booker </em>error and <em>Fanfan </em>error). \u201c[I]f either the Sixth Amendment issue presented in <em>Booker </em>or the issue presented in <em>Fanfan </em>is preserved in the district court by an objection, we will ordinarily vacate the sentence and remand, unless we can say the error is harmless under Rule 52(a) of the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure.\u201d <em>United States v. Pineiro, </em>410 F.3d 282, 284-85 (5th Cir.2005) (internal quotation marks and citation omitted). The Government concedes that Duenas\u2019s objection on the basis of <em>Blakely v. Washington, </em>542 U.S. 296, 124 S.Ct. 2531, 159 L.Ed.2d 403 (2004), was sufficient to preserve his <em>Fanfan </em>claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b396-28\">We conclude that the Government has not met its burden of showing beyond a reasonable doubt that the district court would have imposed the same sentence absent the error. <em>See Pineiro, </em>410 F.3d at 286; <em>United States v. Garza, </em>429 F.3d 165, 170-71 (5th Cir.2005). We therefore VACATE Duenas\u2019s sentence and REMAND for re-sentencing.</p>\n<p id=\"b397-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"375\">*375</page-number>Due\u00f1as also challenges the constitutionality of 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1326(b). His constitutional challenge is foreclosed by <em>Almendarez-Torres v. United States, </em>523 U.S. 224, 235, 118 S.Ct. 1219, 140 L.Ed.2d 350 (1998). Although Due\u00f1as contends that <em>Almendarez-Torres </em>was incorrectly decided and that a majority of the Supreme Court would overrule <em>Almendarez-Torres </em>in light of <em>Apprendi v. New Jersey, </em>530 U.S. 466, 120 S.Ct. 2348, 147 L.Ed.2d 435 (2000), we have repeatedly rejected such arguments on the basis that <em>AlmendarezTorres </em>remains binding. <em>See United States v. Garza-Lopez, </em>410 F.3d 268, 276 (5th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. \u2014, 126 S.Ct. 298, 163 L.Ed.2d 260 (2005). Due\u00f1as properly concedes that his argument is foreclosed in light of <em>Almendarez-Torres </em>and circuit precedent, but he raises it here to preserve it for further review. Accordingly, Duenas\u2019s conviction is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<p id=\"b397-7\">CONVICTION AFFIRMED; SENTENCE VACATED; CASE REMANDED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b396-21\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
