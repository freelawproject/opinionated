On appeal, he argues that mandatory minimum sentences conflict with the sentencing purposes of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a) and are unconstitutional in light of <em>United States v. Booker, </em>543 U.S. 220, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005). For the reasons set forth more fully below, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b781-6\">Sanchez pled guilty to the aforementioned charge before a magistrate and admitted to, <em>inter alia, </em>being the half-owner of eight kilograms of cocaine sometime during January 2003. The magistrate accepted Sanchez\u2019s plea as knowing and voluntary.</p>\n<p id=\"b781-7\">A presentence investigation report (PSI) set Sanchez\u2019s offense level at 32 based upon a finding of between 1,000 and 3,000 kilograms of marijuana equivalency, U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2D1.1(c)(3). Sanchez received a two-level enhancement for being a manager or supervisor in the criminal activity. Next, Sanchez was given a three-level reduction for acceptance of responsibility pursuant to U.S.S.G. \u00a7\u00a7 3E1.1(a) and (b), for a total offense level of 31. Sanchez was found to be at criminal history category II, which at offense level 31, provided for a guidelines range of 121-151 months\u2019 imprisonment. The mandatory minimum sentence was 10 years, or 120 months, pursuant to 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 841(b)(1)(A).</p>\n<p id=\"b781-8\">Sanchez objected to the two-level role enhancement, and also argued that the sentencing guidelines were unconstitutional in light of <em>Blakely v. Washington, </em>542 U.S. 296, 124 S.Ct. 2531, 159 L.Ed.2d 403 (2004). Sanchez also requested that, rather than being sentenced at the low-end of the guidelines, 121 months, he be sentenced to 120 months\u2019 imprisonment, the mandatory minimum. The government supported Sanchez\u2019s request, noting that a 120-month sentence would avoid any issues under <em>Blakely. </em>The court declined the invitation, and sentenced Sanchez to 121 months\u2019 imprisonment.</p>\n<p id=\"b781-10\">While Sanchez\u2019s case was pending on appeal, the Supreme Court issued its decision in <em>United States v. Booker, </em>rendering the guidelines advisory instead of mandatory, and the <em>government </em>filed a motion requesting that the district court certify that a remand was warranted in order to correct the error and resentence Sanchez. The district court granted the motion, and issued an order stating that it was inclined to resentence Sanchez. Subsequently, this Court granted the government\u2019s motion for a remand for resentencing.</p>\n<p id=\"b781-11\">At resentencing, Sanchez, in order to preserve the record, requested that the district court sentence him below the 120-month mandatory minimum, arguing that mandatory minimum sentences violated the Fifth, Sixth, and Eighth Amendments in light of <em>Booker. </em>The district court stated that it was bound by precedent and that, but for the guidelines, it probably would have sentenced Sanchez to the mandatory minimum. Accordingly, Sanchez\u2019s sentence was reduced one month to 120 months\u2019 imprisonment, the statutory minimum.</p>\n<p id=\"b781-12\">On appeal, Sanchez concedes that we previously have upheld the constitutionality of mandatory minimum sentences in drug cases, including after <em>Apprendi v. New Jersey, </em>530 U.S. 466, 120 S.Ct. 2348, 147 L.Ed.2d 435 (2000), but argues that, <em>post-Booker, </em>mandatory minimum sentences now infringe on a judge\u2019s discretion and duty to impose a sentence sufficient, but not greater than necessary, to achieve the sentencing goals based upon 18 U.S.C. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"760\">*760</page-number>\u00a7 3553(a). Sanchez argues that some sentences below mandatory minimums are sufficient, but not greater than necessary, to achieve sentencing purposes under \u00a7 3553(a), and, therefore, mandatory minimums create a conflict between Booker\u2019s remedial scheme and federal sentencing law. Thus, Sanchez argues that the rule of lenity requires this Court to proceed in a manner that favors defendants and permit \u00a7 3553(a) to \u201ctrump\u201d mandatory minimum sentences, thereby permitting courts to take the minimum into account, but sentence below what, in essence, would be an advisory minimum sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b782-4\">We review constitutional challenges to a sentence <em>de novo. United States v. Chau, </em>426 F.3d 1318, 1321 (11th Cir.2005). To the extent the question raised is one of statutory interpretation, review is also <em>de novo. United States v. Searcy, </em>418 F.3d 1193, 1195 (11th Cir.2005), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. \u2014, 126 S.Ct. 1107, \u2014 L.Ed.2d \u2014 (2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b782-6\">In <em>Booker, </em>the Supreme Court explicitly reaffirmed its holding in <em>Apprendi </em>that \u201c[a]ny fact (other than a prior conviction) which is necessary to support a sentence exceeding the maximum authorized by the facts established by a plea of guilty or a jury verdict must be admitted by the defendant or proved to a jury beyond a reasonable doubt.\u201d <em>United States v. Booker, </em>125 S.Ct. at 756. In a second, remedial opinion, the Court held that the guidelines were no longer mandatory, but advisory, and district courts should take the guidelines into account when considering all of the sentencing factors set forth at 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a). <em>Id. </em>125 S.Ct. at 764, 767-69. Nothing in <em>Booker, </em>however, eliminated or declared unconstitutional mandatory minimum sentences as provided for by Congress in drug crimes.</p>\n<p id=\"b782-7\"><em>Pre-Booker </em>and <em>Apprendi </em>we upheld the constitutionality of mandatory minimum sentences, noting that, \u201cwithin the congressionally established range for sentences, nothing in section 841(b)(1) restricts the discretion of a sentencing judge in fashioning an individualized sentence in light of the specific facts of the offense and history of the offender.\u201d <em>United States v. Holmes, </em>838 F.2d 1175, 1177 (11th Cir.1988) (rejecting argument that mandatory minimums violate due process). Post-Ap<em>prendi, </em>the Supreme Court upheld the constitutionality of mandatory minimum sentences. <em>Harris, </em>536 U.S. at 568-69, 122 S.Ct. at 2420. The Supreme Court in <em>Booker </em>made no mention of <em>Harris, </em>nor has it overruled it since.</p>\n<p id=\"b782-9\">Accordingly, while it is possible that <em>Booker\u2019s </em>remedial scheme could implicate mandatory minimum sentences in the future, until the Supreme Court holds that mandatory minimums violate the Fifth and Sixth Amendments of the Constitution, we are obliged to continue following <em>Harris </em>as precedent. As we recently stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b782-10\">It is not given to us to overrule the decisions of the Supreme Court. We have stated repeatedly, and with respect to the very issue presented in this appeal, that \u201cwe are not at liberty to disregard binding case law that is so closely on point and has been only weakened, rather than directly overruled, by the Supreme Court.\u201d This is so even if we are convinced that the Supreme Court will overturn its previous decision the next time it addresses the issue.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b782-11\"><em>United States v. Gibson, </em>434 F.3d 1234, \u2014-\u2014, manuscript op. at 22-23 (11th Cir.2006) (holding that, while wounded, the Supreme Court\u2019s decision in <em>Almendarez-Torres v. United States, </em>523 U.S. 224, 118 S.Ct. 1219, 140 L.Ed.2d 350 (1998) remains binding precedent) (citations omitted). Thus, unless and until the Supreme Court <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"761\">*761</page-number>holds that mandatory minimum sentences violate the Constitution, Sanchez\u2019s argument lacks merit.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> <em>See also United States v. Shelton, </em>400 F.3d 1325, 1333 n. 10 (11th Cir.2005) (\u201c[w]e emphasize that the district court was, and still is, bound by the statutory m\u00ednimums.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b783-5\">Lastly, to the extent that Sanchez is arguing that mandatory m\u00ednimums conflict with the statutory sentencing duties of a court under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a), this argument lacks merit. Congress specifically granted district courts the authority to sentence below a prescribed mandatory minimum sentence in limited circumstances, such as where a defendant provides substantial assistance to authorities, or in the case of a defendant with little to no criminal history who meets other criteria.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> <em>See </em>18 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 3553(e) and (f). The fact that Congress has chosen to set a sentencing floor for drug crimes does not conflict with \u00a7 3553(a), but rather provides a starting point for sentencing. As the Supreme Court noted in <em>Harris, </em>judicial discretion may be channeled when certain findings are made, and in the instant case, Sanchez admitted to the drug amount triggering his mandatory minimum. <em>See Harris, </em>536 U.S. at 567, 122 S.Ct. at 2419. While mandatory minimum sentences are open to criticism, such as the failure to take into account the unique circumstances of certain offenders, these issues and questions are best left to Congress. <em>Id. </em>at 568-69, 122 S.Ct. at 2420.</p>\n<p id=\"b783-8\">Based on the foregoing, we affirm Sanchez\u2019s 120-month sentence, which was required by statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b783-9\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b783-6\">. It is noted as well that Sanchez admitted during his plea colloquy to the amount of drugs used to trigger the mandatory minimum sentence of 120 months, precluding any possible <em>Booker </em>constitutional error, and was resentenced under the advisory guidelines scheme, precluding any possible statutory error.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b783-23\">. The government urges us to apply the doctrine of <em>expressio unius est exclusio alterius </em>(mention of one thing implies the exclusion of the other). This is one method of statutory construction, but does not carry the rule or force of law. <em>See United States v. Camacho-Ibarquen, 410 </em>F.3d 1307, 1312-13 (11th Cir.2005). While the government\u2019s argument may have merit, we decline to address the issue at this time.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
