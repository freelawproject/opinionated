New Jersey, </em>530 U.S. 466, 120 S.Ct. 2348, 147 L.Ed.2d 435 (2000), and its progeny.</p>\n<p id=\"b874-14\">I. <em>Admission of Co-Conspirator\u2019s Statement</em></p>\n<p id=\"b874-15\">McKinnies argues on appeal that the district court erred in admitting into evidence co-conspirator Aaron Bostic\u2019s (Aaron\u2019s) statement to non-co-conspirator Erica Young, because it was allegedly not made in furtherance of the conspiracy. Aaron\u2019s statement was: \u2018Yeah \u2018cause luckily that thing is I guess they didn\u2019t find it you know what I\u2019m talking about?\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b874-16\">We review the district court\u2019s evidentiary rulings for a \u201cclear abuse of discretion.\u201d <em>United States v. Tinoco, </em>304 F.3d 1088, 1119 (11th Cir.2002). There is no reversible error where the disputed evidence established the same facts from testimony already properly admitted into the record. <em>See United States v. Hock, </em>995 F.2d 195, 197 (11th Cir.1993).</p>\n<p id=\"b874-17\">Further, we review the district court\u2019s factual finding that a statement was made in furtherance of a conspiracy under the clearly erroneous standard. <em>United States v. Tokars, </em>95 F.3d 1520, 1538 (11th Cir.1996). A district court\u2019s factual finding that a statement was made in furtherance of the conspiracy is clearly erroneous if, after reviewing the record, we are \u201cleft with a definite and firm conviction that a mistake has been committed.\u201d <em>United States v. Van Hemelryck, </em>945 F.2d 1493, 1498 n. 3 (11th Cir.1991) (internal quotations and citation omitted). Although otherwise inadmissible as hearsay, a statement by a co-conspirator is admissible if the government proves, by a preponderance of the evidence, that the statement was made during the course of, and in furtherance of, the conspiracy. Fed. R.Evid. 801(d)(2)(E); <em>Van Hemelryck, </em>945 F.2d at 1497-98.</p>\n<p id=\"b875-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"853\">*853</page-number>The district court did not clearly err in finding that Aaron\u2019s statement to Young was made in furtherance of the conspiracy because Aaron testified that the statement was about the crack that he had loaned, or \u201cfronted,\u201d McKinnies. <em>See Tinoco, </em>304 F.3d at 1119; <em>Van Hemelryck, </em>945 F.2d at 1497-98. Additionally, the statement was merely cumulative of other evidence establishing that McKinnies had kept the crack in his impounded rental car, as Aaron testified about two conversations that he had with McKinnies in which McKinnies told him that the police had not found the crack in the impounded car. <em>See Hock, </em>995 F.2d at 197. Accordingly, the district court\u2019s admission of this statement was not an abuse of discretion constituting reversible error.</p>\n<p id=\"b875-5\">II. <em>Constitutionality of \u00a7\u00a7 841 and 846</em></p>\n<p id=\"b875-6\">McKinnies further argues that we erred, in <em>United States v. Sanchez, </em>269 F.3d 1250 (11th Cir.2001) <em>(en </em>banc), in holding that \u00a7 841(b) is not facially unconstitutional in light of <em>Apprendi </em>and its progeny. He urges us, instead, to adopt the Ninth Circuit\u2019s reasoning in <em>United States v. Buckland, </em>259 F.3d 1157, 1163-68 (9th Cir.2001), <em>reversed, </em>289 F.3d 558 (9th Cir.2002) <em>(en banc), </em>and asserts that <em>Blakely v. Washington, </em>542 U.S. 296, 124 S.Ct. 2531, 159 L.Ed.2d 403 (2004), strengthens his argument.</p>\n<p id=\"b875-7\">We typically review constitutional issues <em>de novo, </em>but where, as here, the defendant failed to raise his constitutional claim in the district court, we have discretion whether to address the issue. <em>See United States v. Wright, </em>392 F.3d 1269, 1280 (11th Cir.2004), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. \u2014, 125 S.Ct. 1751, 161 L.Ed.2d 615 (2005). A prior panel decision is binding precedent that only can be overturned by our Court sitting <em>en banc. Morrison v. Amway Corp., </em>323 F.3d 920, 929 (11th Cir.2003).</p>\n<p id=\"b875-11\">In <em>Apprendi </em>the Supreme Court held that any fact that increases the penalty for a crime beyond the prescribed statutory maximum must be submitted to a jury and proved beyond a reasonable doubt. <em>Apprendi </em>530 U.S. at 490, 120 S.Ct. at 2362-63. In <em>Sanchez, </em>we limited the scope of <em>Apprendi </em>to when judge-decided facts increase a sentence above the statutory maximum, stating that \u201c \u00a7 841 is impacted by <em>Apprendi </em>but only to the limited extent that judge-decided facts actually increase a defendant\u2019s sentence above the prescribed statutory maximum.\u201d <em>See Sanchez, </em>269 F.3d at 1268. We also relied on <em>Sanchez </em>to reject a facial challenge to 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 960 in <em>United States v. Tinoco, </em>304 F.3d 1088, 1098-99 (11th Cir.2002).</p>\n<p id=\"b875-12\">We reject McKinnies\u2019s request to declare \u00a7\u00a7 841 and 846 unconstitutional. First, McKmnies\u2019s sentence was imposed based upon the jury\u2019s finding that he conspired with intent to distribute 50 grams or more of crack. Second, <em>Sanchez </em>and <em>Tinoco </em>\u2014 our prior decisions that \u00a7\u00a7 841 and 960 are constitutional after <em>Apprendi </em>\u2014 are binding precedent. <em>See Morrison, </em>323 F.3d at 929. For all of these reasons, McKinnies\u2019s argument that \u00a7\u00a7 841 and 846 are unconstitutional must fail.</p>\n<p id=\"b875-13\">Upon review of the record and upon consideration of both parties\u2019 briefs, we find no reversible error.</p>\n<p id=\"b875-14\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
