White first argues that the district court erred \u201cin giving the United States Sentencing Guidelines greater weight than the other sentencing factors Congress delineated in 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553\u201d when determining his sentence. (Appellant\u2019s Brief, Statement of Issues) This argument is without merit. Section 3553(a) of Title 18 requires a court to consider a number of factors, including the sentencing guidelines, when setting a defendant\u2019s sentence. We have independently reviewed the record and find that the district court committed no error in its consideration of the \u00a7 3553(a) factors.</p>\n<p id=\"b277-20\">White next challenges the district court\u2019s application of the career offender sentencing enhancement in U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4Bl.l(a) based on numerous prior convictions.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> White does not dispute the fact <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"256\">*256</page-number>of the prior convictions; rather, he first argues that sentencing enhancements based on prior convictions should, in general, be unavailable where the fact of such conviction is neither alleged in an indictment nor admitted by the defendant. This argument, however, is foreclosed by <em>United States v. Thompson, </em>421 F.3d 278, 285-86 (4th Cir.2005), where we held that a sentencing court does not violate the Sixth Amendment by applying a guidelines enhancement based on the fact of a prior conviction so long as the facts relevant to the enhancement are inherent in the prior conviction. <em>Thompson </em>makes clear that the universe of facts that a court can rely on when applying a guidelines enhancement is not as limited as White suggests.</p>\n<p id=\"b278-4\">White next argues that the district court made specific findings of fact regarding his prior convictions that violate the Sixth Amendment. This argument is without merit. Our review of the record indicates that the district court did not engage in any improper fact-finding in this case. The record before the district court contained sufficient information regarding White\u2019s prior drug convictions to justify application of the career offender enhancement without violating the Sixth Amendment. The Pre-Sentence Report indicates that White had been previously convicted of two controlled substance offenses: (1) two state counts of distributing cocaine in 1992, and (2) one federal count of possession with intent to distribute cocaine in 1992. J.A. 83-84.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Each of these prior convictions qualifies as a \u201ccontrolled substance offense\u201d under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4B1.2(b) because each was \u201cpunishable by a term of imprisonment of more than one year\u201d<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> and each involved either the distribution of or possession with intent to distribute a controlled substance. Therefore, we find that the district court had sufficient information before it to sentence White as a career offender without engaging in fact-finding that violates the Sixth Amendment.</p>\n<p id=\"b278-8\">Accordingly, we affirm White\u2019s sentence. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b278-9\">\n<em>AFFIRMED</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b277-13\">. Under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4Bl.l(a), \u2018\u2018[a] defendant is a career offender if (1) the defendant was at least eighteen years old at the time the defendant committed the instant offense of conviction; (2) the instant offense of conviction is a felony that is either a crime of violence or a controlled substance offense; and (3) the defendant has at least two prior felony convictions of either a crime of violence or a controlled substance offense.\u201d U.S. Sentencing Guidelines Manual \u00a7 4Bl.l(a) (2005).
