Moore appeals <em>pro se </em>the district court\u2019s dismissal of his 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2241 habeas corpus petition. The district court found that Moore could not raise his claim in a \u00a7 2241 petition because he failed to show under the savings clause of 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255 that \u00a7 2255 was inadequate or ineffective to test the legality of his detention.</p>\n<p id=\"b835-13\">Moore presents two issues in this appeal. First, he contends that he was \u201ctried and convicted for acts ... which Congress did not make criminal\u201d because one of the institutions he was charged with robbing did not meet all three prongs of the definition a \u201cbank\u201d under the Federal Bank Robbery Act, 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2113(f). Second, he contends that the district court incorrectly dismissed his petition, because 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255\u2019s savings clause is \u201cfor actual innocence claims based on new evidence[,] ... particularly when, as here, [his] claim could not be presented in a \u00a7 2255 petition in the first instance since \u00a7 2255 does not allow for the presentation of such claims.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b835-15\">The availability of habeas relief under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2241 presents a question of law that we review <em>de novo. Darby v. Hawk-Sawyer, 405 F.3d 942, 944 (11th </em>Cir.2005). Typically, collateral attacks on the validity of a federal conviction or sentence must be brought under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255, which allows a prisoner to attack a federal conviction or sentence as, <em>inter alia, </em>a violation of the United States Constitution, or \u201cotherwise subject to collateral attack.\u201d <em>Id.; </em>28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255. However, that section severely restricts the circumstances in which a second or subsequent motion can be filed. <em>See </em>28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255 H 8. Moore admitted that he has already presented the central claim of this petition \u2014 the bank definition/actual innocence claim \u2014 in a \u00a7 2255 motion that was denied as a second or successive motion because it did not fit within the requirements of such a motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b835-16\">In filing this petition, Moore relies on a provision of \u00a7 2255 that permits a federal prisoner to file a petition under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2241. <em>See </em>28 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 2241(a), 2255. That provision, known as \u00a7 2255\u2019s \u201csavings clause,\u201d provides that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b835-17\">[a]n application for a writ of habeas corpus in behalf of a prisoner who is authorized to apply for relief by motion pursuant to this section, shall not be entertained if it appears that the applicant has failed to apply for relief, by motion, to the court which sentenced him, or that such court has denied him relief, <em>unless it also appears that the remedy by motion is inadequate or inef</em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"814\">*814</page-number><em>fective to test the legality of his detention.</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b836-4\">28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255 (emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b836-5\">However, the savings clause applies only when: (1) the petitioner\u2019s claim is based on a retroactively applicable Supreme Court decision; (2) the holding of that decision established that the petitioner was convicted of a \u201cnonexistent offense\u201d; and (8) \u201ccircuit law squarely foreclosed such a claim at the time it otherwise should have been raised at the petitioner\u2019s trial, appeal, or first \u00a7 2255 motion.\u201d <em>Wofford v. Scott, </em>177 F.3d 1236, 1244 (11th Cir.1999). Section 2255\u2019s strict limitations on successive motions alone \u201cdo not render that section \u2018inadequate or ineffective\u2019 within the meaning of the savings clause.\u201d <em>Darby, </em>405 F.3d at 945. The savings clause \u201cdoes not exist to free a prisoner of the effects of his failure to raise an available claim earlier.\u201d <em>Wofford, </em>177 F.3d at 1245. Finally, before a prisoner may argue actual innocence, he must \u201copen the portal\u201d to a \u00a7 2241 proceeding by demonstrating that the savings clause applies to his claim. <em>Id. </em>at 1244 n. 3.</p>\n<p id=\"b836-6\">Moore\u2019s present petition and its claim clearly does not fit within the savings clause, as interpreted in <em>Wofford. </em>Accordingly, we affirm the district court\u2019s dismissal of it.</p>\n<p id=\"b836-7\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
