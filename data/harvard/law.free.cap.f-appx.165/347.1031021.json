He argues that his 46-month sentence under 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1326(b) violates his constitutional right to due process. This argument is foreclosed by <em>Almendarez-Torres v. United States, </em>523 U.S. 224, 235, 118 S.Ct. 1219, 140 L.Ed.2d 350 (1998). Although Meabe-Morales contends that <em>Almendarez-Torres </em>was incorrectly decided and that a majority of the Supreme Court would overrule <em>Almendarez-Torres </em>in light of <em>Apprendi v. New Jersey, </em>530 U.S. 466, 120 S.Ct. 2348, 147 L.Ed.2d 435 (2000), we have repeatedly rejected such arguments on the basis that <em>AlmendarezTorres </em>remains binding. <em>See United States v. Garza-Lopez, </em>410 F.3d 268, 276 (5th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. \u2014, 126 S.Ct. 298, 163 L.Ed.2d 260 (2005). Meabe-Morales properly concedes that his argument is foreclosed in light of <em>Almendarez-Torres </em>and circuit precedent, but he raises it here to preserve it for further review.</p>\n<p id=\"b371-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"349\">*349</page-number>Meabe-Morales also argues that the district court erred by determining that he had a prior \u201cdrug trafficking offense\u201d and thereby enhancing his base offense level by 16 levels. Under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2L1.2(b)(l)(A)(i) (2004), the offense level for unlawfully entering or remaining in the United States is increased 16 levels if the defendant was deported or removed previously after being convicted of a felony drug trafficking offense that resulted in a sentence of 13 or more months of imprisonment. For the purpose of this enhancement, a \u201cdrug trafficking offense\u201d is defined as \u201can offense under federal, state, or local law that prohibits the manufacture, import, export, distribution, or dispensing of a controlled substance (or a counterfeit substance) or the possession of a controlled substance (or counterfeit substance) with intent to manufacture, import, export, distribute, or dispense.\u201d U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2L1.2, comment. (n.l(B)(iv)) (2004). Meabe-Morales\u2019s sentence was enhanced was based on his prior North Carolina conviction for the felony offense of \u201ctrafficking in marijuana\u201d by transporting in excess of 10 pounds of marijuana, under N.C. Gen.Stat. \u00a7 90 \u2014 95(h)(1) (2001). The state\u2019s label of the offense of transporting more than 10 pounds of marijuana as \u201ctrafficking\u201d is not controlling. <em>See Taylor v. United States, </em>495 U.S. 575, 592, 110 S.Ct. 2143, 109 L.Ed.2d 607 (1990). This offense does not fall within \u00a7 2L1.2\u2019s definition of a drug trafficking offense. <em>See Garza-Lopez, </em>410 F.3d at 273. Without that conviction, the 16-level enhancement is inapplicable. We accordingly VACATE Meabe-Morales\u2019s sentence and REMAND to the district court for re-sentencing.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b370-11\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
