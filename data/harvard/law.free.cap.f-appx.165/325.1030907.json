Rodriguez-Pecina argues that the district court reversibly erred under <em>United States v. Booker, </em>543 U.S. 220, 125 S.Ct. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"326\">*326</page-number>738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005), by sentencing him pursuant to a mandatory application of the sentencing guidelines.</p>\n<p id=\"b348-4\">There was no <em>\u201cBooker\u201d </em>error or Sixth Amendment violation because the only enhancement to Rodriguez-Pecina\u2019s sentence was for his prior conviction. <em>See Booker, </em>125 S.Ct. at 756, 769. Nevertheless, the district court committed <em>\u201cFanfan </em>\u201d error by sentencing Rodriguez-Peeina pursuant to a mandatory guidelines system. <em>See United States v. Walters, </em>418 F.3d 461, 463-64 (5th Cir.2005). A <em>Fanfan </em>error is not structural error. <em>See United States v. Martinez-Lugo, </em>411 F.3d 597, 601 (5th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. \u2014, 126 S.Ct. 464, 163 L.Ed.2d 352 (2005). The government concedes that Rodriguez-Peeina preserved his <em>Fanfan </em>claim, so we review the claim for harmless error. <em>See Walters, </em>418 F.3d at 464. There is no indication in the record that the district court would have imposed the same sentence had the guidelines been advisory rather than mandatory. Accordingly, we vacate the sentence and remand for resentencing in accordance with <em>Booker.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b348-7\">Rodriguez-Peeina also contends that the \u201cfelony\u201d and \u201caggravated felony\u201d provisions of 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1326(b)(1) and (b)(2) are unconstitutional on their face and as applied in his case in light of <em>Apprendi v. New Jersey, </em>530 U.S. 466, 120 S.Ct. 2348, 147 L.Ed.2d 435 (2000). Rodriguez-Pecina\u2019s constitutional challenge is foreclosed by <em>Almendarez-Torres v. United States, </em>523 U.S. 224, 235, 118 S.Ct. 1219, 140 L.Ed.2d 350 (1998). Although RodriguezPeeina contends that <em>Almendarez-Torres </em>was incorrectly decided and that a majority of the Supreme Court would overrule <em>Almendarez-Torres </em>in light of <em>Apprendi, </em>we have repeatedly rejected such arguments on the basis that <em>Almendarez-Torres </em>remains binding. <em>See United States v. Garza-Lopez, </em>410 F.3d 268, 276 (5th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. \u2014, 126 S.Ct. 298, 163 L.Ed.2d 260 (2005). Rodriguez-Pecina properly concedes that his argument is foreclosed in light of <em>Almendarez-Torres </em>and circuit precedent, but he raises it here to preserve it for further review. Accordingly, Rodriguez-Pecina\u2019s conviction is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<p id=\"b348-10\">CONVICTION AFFIRMED; SENTENCE VACATED; CASE REMANDED FOR RESENTENCING.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b347-25\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
