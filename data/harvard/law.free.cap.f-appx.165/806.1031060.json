Specifically, Stuckey was charged with, as an Internal Revenue Service (\u201cIRS\u201d) employee, knowingly doing or omitting to do acts with the intent to enable others to defraud the United States, in violation of 26 U.S.C. \u00a7 7214(a)(6), and, as an IRS employee, willfully disclosing return or return information to others, in violation of 26 U.S.C. \u00a7 7213(a)(1).</p>\n<p id=\"b828-24\">We review a district court\u2019s denial of a motion for judgment of acquittal <em>de novo. United States v. Hansen, </em>262 F.3d 1217, 1236 (11th Cir.2001). \u201cTo uphold the denial of a motion for judgment of acquittal, we need only determine that a reasonable fact-finder could conclude that the evidence established the defendant\u2019s guilt beyond a reasonable doubt.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(quotation omitted). In reviewing a challenge to the sufficiency of the evidence to support a conviction, \u201cwe apply a <em>de novo </em>standard of review, but resolve all reasonable inferences in favor of the jury\u2019s verdict.\u201d <em>United States v. Pineiro, </em>389 F.3d 1359, 1367 (11th Cir.2004). \u201cThe evidence is sufficient so long as a reasonable trier of fact, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"807\">*807</page-number>choosing among reasonable interpretations of the evidence, could find guilt beyond a reasonable doubt.\u201d Id (citation omitted). We will not disturb a guilty verdict if there is substantial evidence to support it, \u201cunless no trier of fact could have found guilt beyond a reasonable doubt.\u201d <em>United States v. Lyons, </em>53 F.3d 1198, 1202 (11th Cir.1995) (citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b829-5\">The charging statute provides that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b829-6\">If two or more persons conspire either to commit any offense against the United States, or to defraud the United States, or any agency thereof in any manner or for any purpose, and one or more of such persons do any act to effect the object of the conspiracy, each shall be fined under this title or imprisoned not more than five years, or both.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"A6R\">18 U.S.C. \u00a7 371. Federal law makes it illegal for an IRS employee to \u201cdo[] or omit[ ] to do any act with intent to enable any other person to defraud the United States.\u201d 26 U.S.C. \u00a7 7214(a)(6). Federal law also makes it illegal for an IRS employee \u201cwillfully to disclose to any person, except as authorized ... any return or return information.\u201d 26 U.S.C. \u00a7 7213(a)(1).</p>\n<p id=\"b829-7\">To convict for conspiracy, the government must prove beyond a reasonable doubt: \u201c(1) an agreement among two or more persons to achieve an unlawful objective; (2) knowing and voluntary participation in the agreement; and (3) an overt act by a conspirator in furtherance of the agreement.\u201d <em>United States v. Hasson, </em>333 F.3d 1264, 1270 (11th Cir.2003), <em>cert. denied, </em>541 U.S. 1056, 124 S.Ct. 2195, 158 L.Ed.2d 755 (2004) and 543 U.S. 1173, 125 S.Ct. 1366, 161 L.Ed.2d 154 (2005). The government must prove that \u201ca conspiracy existed, that the defendant knew of it, and that the defendant, with knowledge, voluntarily joined it.\u201d <em>Pineiro, </em>389 F.3d at 1368 (quotation omitted). The government may show participation in the conspiracy by circumstantial evidence, and it only needs to prove the defendant knew the general nature and scope of the conspiracy. <em>Id. </em>(citation omitted). An agreement may be based upon the reasonable inferences from the relationship of the parties, their overt acts and concert of action, and from the totality of their conduct. <em>See United States v. Guerra, </em>293 F.3d 1279, 1285 (11th Cir.2002), <em>cert. denied </em>537 U.S. 1141, 123 S.Ct. 934, 154 L.Ed.2d 837 (2003). A jury may choose not to believe a defendant\u2019s testimony, may reject the defendant\u2019s explanation, and may conclude that the defendant\u2019s false testimony is indicative of the defendant\u2019s guilt. <em>United States v. Allison, </em>908 F.2d 1531, 1535 (11th Cir.1990).</p>\n<p id=\"b829-9\">Because trial testimony, recorded telephone conversations, an incomplete tax form, among other items, were sufficient evidence from which a reasonable trier of fact could find Stuckey guilty beyond a reasonable doubt, we affirm her conviction.</p>\n<p id=\"b829-10\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
