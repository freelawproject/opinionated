For the following reasons, we deny the petition.</p>\n<p id=\"b357-10\">1. The IJ\u2019s finding that the grant of asylum to Mr. Drenova should be terminated is supported by substantial evidence. The record reflects that Mr. Drenova lied under oath when he stated on his asylum application that he had never used any aliases other than the name under which he applied. This concealment was material because investigation of Mr. Drenova\u2019s alias would have disclosed other facts relevant to his qualifications, particularly the fact that he entered the United States more than one year prior to his application for asylum, and thus the concealment naturally tended to influence the agency\u2019s decision. <em>Kungys v. United States, </em>485 U.S. 770, 772, 108 S.Ct. 1537, 1547, 99 L.Ed.2d 839 (1988).</p>\n<p id=\"b357-14\">2. We do not have jurisdiction to review the IJ\u2019s determination that Mr. Drenova is time-barred from presenting a new application for asylum. INA \u00a7 208(a)(3), 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1158(a)(3). The qualification of \u00a7 208(a)(3)\u2019s limitation on judicial review imposed by the recently enacted INA \u00a7 242(a)(2)(D) (8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(a)(2)(D)) is not applicable in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b357-15\">3. Mr. Drenova\u2019s claim that the IJ erred by not permitting him to file an application for withholding of removal is contradicted by the record. The record reflects that the IJ expressly afforded Mr. Drenova an opportunity to pursue an application for withholding and that Mr. Drenova did not do so.</p>\n<p id=\"b357-16\">PETITION DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b357-11\"> Pursuant to <em>5 th Cm. R. 47.5, the </em>Court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
