Booker, </em>543 U.S. 220, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005). The erroneous application of the guidelines as mandatory is technically a \u201cFanfan error.\u201d <em>See United States v. Martinez-Lugo, </em>411 F.3d 597, 600 (5th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. \u2014, 126 S.Ct. 464, 163 L.Ed.2d 352 (2005). The Government implicitly concedes that Hernandez preserved his Fanfan claim for appeal and that the issue is reviewed for harmless error. <em>See United States v. Walters, </em>418 F.3d 461, 463 (5th Cir.2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b395-12\">Hernandez argues that he is entitled to resentencing because application of the Sentencing Guidelines as mandatory constituted structural error. However, this issue is foreclosed. <em>See id. </em>Hernandez also contends that the record does not disclose that the district court\u2019s error was harmless. The Government argues that any error by the district court was harmless because the district court acted reasonably in taking into account the Sentencing Guidelines, the 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a) sentencing factors, and the presentence report when it sentenced Hernandez, and it notes that the district court did not express \u201cdismay or frustration\u201d in sentencing Hernandez within the guideline range. The sentencing transcript is silent with regard to whether the district court would have applied the same sentence had the Guidelines been advisory only. Furthermore, Hernandez\u2019s 77-month term of imprisonment is at the bottom of the applicable guideline range. Under such circumstances, the Government has not met its burden of proving the error harmless beyond a reasonable doubt. <em>See id. </em>We therefore VACATE the sentence and REMAND for resentencing in accordance with <em>Booker.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b395-17\">Hernandez\u2019s constitutional challenge is foreclosed by <em>Almendarez-Torres v. United States, </em>523 U.S. 224, 235, 118 S.Ct. 1219, 140 L.Ed.2d 350 (1998). Although Hernandez contends that <em>AlmendarezTorres </em>was incorrectly decided and that a majority of the Supreme Court would overrule <em>Almendarez-Torres </em>in light of <em>Apprendi v. New Jersey, </em>530 U.S. 466, 120 S.Ct. 2348, 147 L.Ed.2d 435 (2000), we have repeatedly rejected such arguments on the basis that <em>Almendarez-Torres </em>remains binding. <em>See United States v. Garza-Lopez, </em>410 F.3d 268, 276 (5th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. \u2014, 126 S.Ct. 298, 163 L.Ed.2d 260 (2005). Hernandez properly concedes that his argument is foreclosed in light of <em>Almendarez-Torres </em>and circuit precedent, but he raises it here to preserve it for further review. The judgment of conviction is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<p id=\"b396-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"374\">*374</page-number>CONVICTION AFFIRMED; SENTENCE VACATED; CASE REMANDED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b395-13\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
