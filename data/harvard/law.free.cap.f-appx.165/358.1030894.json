We affirm his conviction but vacate his sentence and remand.</p>\n<p id=\"b381-21\">Jimenez contends that his sentence must be vacated because he was sentenced pursuant to mandatory sentencing guidelines that were held unconstitutional in <em>United States v. Booker, </em>543 U.S. 220, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005). He asserts that the error in his case is reversible because the error is structural and is insusceptible of harmless error analysis. Contrary to Jimenez\u2019s contention, we have previously rejected this specific argument. <em>See United States v. Walters, </em>418 F.3d 461, 463 (5th Cir.2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b381-22\">The government concedes that Jimenez\u2019s objections preserved the sentencing issue for harmless error review. Jimenez contends that the government cannot show that the error that occurred at his sentenc<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"360\">*360</page-number>ing was harmless. We review Jimenez\u2019s challenge to his sentence for harmless error under Fed.R.Crim.P. 52(a). <em>See Walters, </em>418 F.3d at 463.</p>\n<p id=\"b382-4\">Jimenez was sentenced at the bottom of the guideline range, and the district court made no comment regarding the sentence. The record provides no indication, and the government has not met its burden of showing that the district court would not have sentenced Jimenez differently under an advisory guidelines system. <em>See United States v. Garza, </em>429 F.3d 165, 170-71 (5th Cir.2005). Thus, the error was not harmless as a matter of law. Accordingly, Jimenez\u2019s sentence is VACATED, and his case is REMANDED for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b382-5\">Jimenez\u2019s constitutional challenge to 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1326 is foreclosed by <em>Almendarez-Torres v. United States, </em>523 U.S. 224, 235, 118 S.Ct. 1219, 140 L.Ed.2d 350 (1998). Although Jimenez contends that <em>Almendarez-Torres </em>was incorrectly decided and that a majority of the Supreme Court would overrule <em>Almendarez-Torres </em>in light of <em>Apprendi v. New Jersey, </em>530 U.S. 466, 120 S.Ct. 2348, 147 L.Ed.2d 435 (2000), we have repeatedly rejected such arguments on the basis that <em>AlmendarezTorres </em>remains binding. <em>See United States v. Garza-Lopez, </em>410 F.3d 268, 276 (5th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. \u2014, 126 S.Ct. 298, 163 L.Ed.2d 260 (2005). Jimenez properly concedes that his argument is foreclosed in light of <em>Almendarez-Torres </em>and circuit precedent, but he raises it here to preserve it for further review. Accordingly, Jimenez\u2019s conviction is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<p id=\"b382-8\">AFFIRMED IN PART; VACATED IN PART; REMANDED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b381-14\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
