Herndon, for Defendant in Error.</attorneys><p data-order=\"29\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b172-10\" pgmap=\"172\">The plaintiff in error claims the premises in dispute by virtue of a decree of the County Court of Tazewell county, rendered at its September term, 1856. The plaintiff introduced as evidence a copy of the petition, notice, deed, etc. The notice was published for three successive weeks, but not for six weeks before presenting the petition, as the statutes required. Eev. Stat., page 558, sees. 103, 104. See copy of notice, the time, and printers\u2019 certificate, which are given in the statement of the case.</p><p data-order=\"30\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b172-11\" pgmap=\"172(43) 173(70)\">The Eevised Statutes, page 558, sec. 104, says: \u201c It shall be the duty of said Circuit Court\u2014now County Court\u2014at the time and place specified in said notice aforesaid, or at such other time as the court shall appoint, to hear and determine, etc., etc. The petition in this case was presented to the court at the time and place specified in the notice. The time was on the 3rd day of September, 1856,\u2014at no other time or place. Hence the notice lacked one day of being for six weeks before the presenting of the petition. The court did not order a different time, day or place. Rev. Stat., page 558, sec. 104.</p><p data-order=\"31\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b173-5\" pgmap=\"173\">The defendant in this case claims title to the land in dispute from the heirs of Benj. F. Jewett, deceased, and in the brief of the counsel of the plaintiff in error, it is admitted, in these words, that: \u201c Benj. F. Jewett died intestate on or about the 20th day of December, 1848, seized in fee simple of the premises in dispute, and that defendant in error has a chain of title, perfect and complete, from the heirs of said Jewett to the premises.\u201d The ancestor of the heirs, the debtor of the claimant, had been dead eight years and more before the presenting of the petition.</p><p data-order=\"32\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b173-6\" pgmap=\"173\">There are some questions arising in this case of much importance: and first, What is necessary to give jurisdiction to the court to sell decedent\u2019s lands ?</p><p data-order=\"33\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b173-7\" pgmap=\"173\">1st, He must be indebted ;</p><p data-order=\"34\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b173-8\" pgmap=\"173\">2nd, The personal estate must be exhausted before the lands can be sold ;</p><p data-order=\"35\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b173-9\" pgmap=\"173\">3rd, There must be a petition by the administrator, setting out the facts why the sale of lands is required; and</p><p data-order=\"36\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b173-10\" pgmap=\"173\">4th, There must be a publication for three successive weeks, commencing six weeks before the presentation of the petition to the court for an order of sale.</p><p data-order=\"37\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b173-11\" pgmap=\"173\">In this case all the above facts frima facie were made out but the last. The publication was made but for five weeks before the presenting of the petition.</p><p data-order=\"38\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b173-12\" pgmap=\"173(78) 174(13)\">The question now comes, if the publication was not such as required by law, Did the court get jurisdiction of the land? What is jurisdiction ? It is to hear and determine a case in the mode and manner pointed out by the statute that creates the court with its powers and duties. Our statutes did create the county and the probate court, with their powers and duties. Is the publication for jwe weeks, instead of six, which the law directs, a compliance with the law? Most assuredly it is not.</p><p data-order=\"39\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b174-5\" pgmap=\"174\">Is the judgment of the County Court of Tazewell county void for the want of jurisdiction ? It is void. Could the court sell the lands of Jewett had he not been indebted, had he been living, had there been no petition, had there been no notice, which is the truth in the case? He ver. All these things are necessary conditions to the court getting jurisdiction.</p><p data-order=\"40\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b174-6\" pgmap=\"174\">The Supreme Court of this State say, in 18 Ill. 551, \u201c But in making this decree, as in the case of constructive notice by publication, the requirements of the statute must be strictly complied with, and this must affirmatively appear on the record.\u201d \u201c When that notice is constructively given, the party claiming benefits under it must show a strict compliance with every' requirement of the statute. Hothing less will invest the court with jurisdiction.\u201d</p><p data-order=\"41\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b174-7\" pgmap=\"174\">The Supreme Court of Indiana, in the 7th volume of Indiana Eeports, at page 120, says, in reference to the time of a four weeks publication, this, \u201c The statute required the publication of notice four weeks in a newspaper. How when a statute prescribes a certain thing to be done, to constitute constructive notice of a suit or legal proceedings, does it not take all of that thing to make notice ? A part would seem to amount to nothing. The statute in this case said, publish four weeks in a newspaper, and the court will have jurisdiction. But the statute was not complied with, and it would seem to follow, that there was no jurisdiction. Ho discretion was left to the court as to what should constitute notice.\u201d 18 Ill. 551; 6 Smedes and Marshall, 259; 1 id. 351; 3 Cowan, 59; 16 Smith\u2019s R. 180; 11 Wendell, 648; 7 Ind. 120; 15 Ill. 394; 1 Hill, 130; 7 Barbour, 39; 3 id. 341; 19 Missouri, 454; 11 Howard, 437; 2 Yerger, 484; 7 Smedes and Marsh. 449; 32 Mississippi, 324; 3 Green, 374; 3 Iowa, 374; 10 Peters\u2019 R. 161; 11 Foster, 273.</p><p data-order=\"42\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b174-8\" pgmap=\"174(22) 175(120)\">The judgment in this case can be inquired into collaterally. It is admitted, for the sake of argument in this case, that orders, decrees, etc., of courts of limited, but not inferor j urisdiction, are not void where there is nothing on the face of their proceedings that show that the court exceeded its jurisdiction. But where it does appear affirmatively on the face of the proceedings that the court did not get or obtain the jurisdiction, or exceeded the jurisdiction, then its proceedings are void. In the first case there are presumptions in its favor; in the last there can be none. Then the record tells the whole true story. Look at the notice : it is for five weeks, not six. The said decree is void, and the judgment may be inquired into collaterally. 18 Ill. 551.</p><p data-order=\"43\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b175-5\" pgmap=\"175\">No person not a party to the suit-bill, petition, etc., can reverse it, can bring error, can appeal. The heirs in this ease were not made parties in this suit. They are not privies. It is true that in this case, Gibson v. Roll, the court did say or intimate that the heirs could support a writ of error, though not made parties defendants. I suppose the coprt only means to say that the heirs may support a writ of error\u2014not that they shall do so. Because the parties cannot support a writ of error, because they are not compelled to do so, they have the old and undoubted right to attack the County Court\u2019s judgment in a collateral way\u2014an ejectment. 25 Ill. 390; 16 Ill. 177; 19 Ill. 119.</p><p data-order=\"44\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b175-6\" pgmap=\"175(140) 176(23)\">County and probate courts are courts of limited jurisdiction, though not inferior ones. A fair presumptiom should be indulged in to sustain them, their judgments, proceedings, etc. Their proceedings, their judgments, are prima facie correct. However, some things must be apparent, must appear on the face of the proceedings, to give them full validity \u2014for instance: indebtedness, death of debtor, administration, petition and notice, etc. The Supreme Court say, in 23 Ill. 489, \u201c It is the existence of these facts which awakens the power of the court, which calls it into action. They are fundamental facts, and although the court had cognizance of the general fact, it not appearing by the record that the facts were such as to give the court jurisdiction in the particular case, we are not authorized to presume their existence.\u201d 23 Ill. 484; 19 Ill. 113; 16 Ill. 177; 18 Ill. 551; 2 Scam. 366; 2 Gilm. 583; 14 Ill. 369; 17 Ill. 276.</p><p data-order=\"45\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b176-5\" pgmap=\"176\">And lastly, Jewett died on or about the 20th of December, 1848. The application in this case to sell was made on the 3rd day of September, 1856. Jewett, then, was dead more than eight years before the presenting of the petition in this case. The statute of limitation, by analogy, if not absolutely, has run against the claim. Frauds too numerous are thus, after long lapse of time, perpetrated against estates.</p><p data-order=\"46\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b176-6\" pgmap=\"176\">Our own Supreme Court, in delivering its opinion in the case of McCoy v. Merron, says, \u201cIt seems to me that that certainty in the law so necessary to enable the citizen to know his rights of property\u2014by analogy to the lien of judgment and the limitation of entry upon and action for the recovery of lands\u2014requires the application to this case of the fixed period of seven years from the death of the ancestor.\u201d 18 Ill. 519; 23 Ill. 484.</p> <opinion data-order=\"47\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\"> <author id=\"b176-7\" pgmap=\"176\">Caton, C. J.</author> <p id=\"AYt\" pgmap=\"176\">The only question to be considered in this case, is the sufficiency of the notice to justify the action of the court. If the notice was insufficient to give the court jurisdiction to make the order for the sale of the real estate, then the sale under that order conveyed no title. This was the notice and certificate of publication:</p> <blockquote id=\"b176-8\" pgmap=\"176\">\" Administrator's Notice.\u2014Notice is hereby given that I will make application to the County Court of Tazewell county, on the third day of September, for a decree to sell all or so much of the real estate of Benjamin F. Jewett, deceased, late of Tazewell county, as will be sufficient to pay the debts of said estate. All persons interested are requested to appear and show cause, if any they have, why such decree should not be granted.</blockquote> <blockquote id=\"b176-9\" pgmap=\"176\">WILLIAM S.

Jewett, dee\u2019d.\u201d</blockquote> <p id=\"b176-11\" pgmap=\"176\">Accompanied by the following certificate :</p> <blockquote id=\"b176-12\" pgmap=\"176\">\u201cWe, Toung &amp; Underwood, printers and publishers of the \u2018Weekly Plain-dealer,\u2019 do hereby certify that the annexed advertisement was published in the \u2018 Weekly Plaindealer\u2019 for six weeks successively\u2014the first publication being on the 24th day of July, 1856, and the last publication on the fourth day of September, A. D. 1856. TOUNG &amp; UNDERWOOD,</blockquote> <blockquote id=\"b176-13\" pgmap=\"176\">Publishers and Printers,\u201d</blockquote> <p id=\"b177-4\" pgmap=\"177(423) 178(54)\">The statute requires the notice to be published for three successive weeks, the first publication to be at least six weeks before the presenting of the petition. Here there was less than six weeks between the 24th day of July, when the notice was first published, and the third day of September, when all persons interested were notified that the petition would be presented, and had the petition been presented on that day there is no doubt that the notice would have been insufficient. But the record shows that the petition was actually presented on the ninth day of September, when the six weeks had expired. Was then this notice sufficient to authorize the court to receive the petition on the ninth of September, and to act upon it ? Were parties interested bound to appear at all under a notice which showed on its face that they were notified so to do, at a time when the law imposed no obligation upon them to appear? We are inclined to think that the notice was void upon its face. The question is not whether, if the six weeks had expired on the third of September, the court could have received the petition afterwards, though that would be by no means clear. The one hundred and fourth section says, \u201c It shall be the duty of the Circuit Court, at the time and place specified in the notice aforesaid, or at such other time as the said court shall appoint, to hear and examine the allegations and proofs of such executor or administrator,\u201d etc. Now, this would seem to imply, that the petition must be presented on the day specified in the notice, and then the court may order another day for hearing the proofs. The statute does not say that the court may order another day for the presentation of the petition. The order authorized to be made would seem to follow the presentation of the petition, and is in the further progress of the cause. Until the petition is presented there is nothing upon which the court can act; there is no proceeding in which the court can make the order fixing the time for hearing the proof. When the notice is published as required by the statute, those interested are bound to appear and attend upon the court during the whole of that day, either to resist the application then, or to hear the order of the court fixing another time for hearing the proof; but if during that day no petition is presented, they may well presume that the purpose of presenting it is abandoned, and go about their business. It would be a great hardship to require them to attend during a whole term, lasting perhaps for several weeks, to see if some move would not be made in the matter.</p> <p id=\"b178-5\" pgmap=\"178\">We think the court decided properly in rejecting the deed, and its judgment is affirmed.</p> <p id=\"b178-6\" pgmap=\"178\">Judgment affirmed.</p> </opinion> </casebody> ",
