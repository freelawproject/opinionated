The practice to dismiss a bill is confined to cases where there is a want of equity upon the face of the bill, and it is manifest that no amendment can help it, or where there is a want of jurisdiction.</headnotes><headnotes data-order=\"3\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b35-20\" pgmap=\"35\">A court of chancery will entertain jurisdiction of a bill filed by the equitable holder of judgments against the heirs and administrators of a deceased judgment debtor, to compel a discovery of the assets of the intestate, and to subject them to the payment of the judgments.</headnotes><headnotes data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b35-21\" pgmap=\"35\">If it should appear that there are several judgments, each of which was obtained against the intestate jointly with different parties, the co-defendants in all of these judgments should be made parties to the bill,</headnotes><headnotes data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b36-3\" pgmap=\"36\">In those cases where the intestate was a surety, the complainant should be required to exhaust his remedy against the principals first; but in cases where the intestate was the principal debtor, and his co-defendants were his sureties, the amount of the judgments should be made out of the estate in the hands of the heirs which came to them by descent or devise.</headnotes><summary data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b36-4\" pgmap=\"36\">The record in this cause shows the following facts:</summary><summary data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b36-5\" pgmap=\"36\">The president, directors and company of the Bank of Illinois recovered judgments in the Lawrence Circuit Court, against Josiah R.

Kitchell, for Appellees.</attorneys><p data-order=\"29\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b39-5\" pgmap=\"39\">The complainant seeks to obtain a decree against the administrators and heirs of J. R. Wynn for the amount of four judgments against Wynn and others, on which executions had been issued and may again be issued ; and the only ground of asking the aid of equity is, that the complainant does not know the description of the real estate which has descended to the heirs of Wynn, and because Hiram Johnson, guardian of said heirs of Wynn, who are minors, is supposed to have the title papers of said lands.</p><p data-order=\"30\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b39-6\" pgmap=\"39\">The decree dismissing the bill was proper, 1st, for the want of equity; 2nd, for the want of sufficient proof.</p><p data-order=\"31\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b39-7\" pgmap=\"39\">The judgments exhibited, show that in the first George and Shaw, in the second George and Garland, in the third Jeffs, Garland and Allison, and in the fourth Allison and Organ, were jointly in the judgments with Wynn, but none of these co-defendants are made parties to complainant\u2019s bill.</p><p data-order=\"32\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b39-8\" pgmap=\"39\">On all the judgments executions have been issued, and they are all shown to be \u201c unreversed, unsatisfied and in full force,\u201d but no cause is alleged why they may not be collected by execution off some one or more of the co-defendants.</p><p data-order=\"33\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b39-9\" pgmap=\"39\">On the second judgment execution was issued July 10, 1848, and levied on one hundred and twenty acres of land and three town lots, which, so far as appears from the bill, are still subject to be sold under that levy.</p><p data-order=\"34\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b39-10\" pgmap=\"39\">On the third judgment execution was issued February 13, 1852, and levied on sixty-nine acres of land, which, so far as appears from the bill, is still lying under that levy.</p><p data-order=\"35\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b39-11\" pgmap=\"39\">It was agreed by the parties, that the exhibits should not be copied into the record, and that they proved the allegations of the bill as to the judgments, but the agreement does not. provide that any others are confessed, and there being no proof of the want of personal assets, or of the refusal of the administrators and guardians to pay, or to disclose the titles, the complainant therefore failed in his proof, and the decree was right.</p> <opinion data-order=\"36\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\"> <author id=\"b40-4\" pgmap=\"40\">Breese, J.</author> <p id=\"Ax-\" pgmap=\"40\">The practice, to dismiss a bill in chancery, on motion, has not generally obtained in the courts of Great Britain, or in this country, unless it be for want of equity, apparent on the face of the bill, and where it is manifest no amendment could help it, or for want of jurisdiction. -For a want of proper parties it is not the practice to dismiss on motion. When there is equity in the bill, and all the necessary parties are not before the court nor in the bill, the rule is, to hold the bill, in order that proper parties may be made to it.</p> <p id=\"b40-5\" pgmap=\"40\">The objection here was, that all the judgment debtors were not made parties. This was a good objection, but the court, instead of dismissing the bill, should have retained it in order that proper amendments might be made, and the proper parties brought in. This objection, made at the hearing, could be obviated, and therefore it was error to dismiss the bill. Story\u2019s Eq. Pleading, secs. 75, 76, (b). The cause will be remanded, with leave so to amend the bill as to make the judgment debtors parties ; and if, on the hearing, by the testimony, it should appear that the intestate Wynn was surety merely on the notes on which the judgments were obtained, the complainant should be required to exhaust his remedy against the principals therein, especially, so far as the levy on the land is concerned. If, however, it should appear that Wynn was the principal debtor, and the owners of the land on which the levy was made were sureties, then the complainant\u2019s demand should be made out of the estate of Wynn, in the hands of his heirs, which came to them by descent or devise, and they should be required to discover its extent and description. This would be equity, and this the court should do, and the bill seeks this discovery.</p> <p id=\"b40-6\" pgmap=\"40\">When the judgment debtors are before the court, they may, on taking an account, show enough to discharge the heirs of Wynn, by charging themselves. At any rate they are interested in stating the account, and are necessary parties. There is no doubt about the right of complainant to bring this suit in chancery, for the relief he seeks. Chadsey's Adm'rs v. Lewis, 1 Gilm. 137; Fry v. Bank of Illinois, 5 id. 336; Leach v. Thomas, 27 Ill. 457.</p> <p id=\"b41-4\" pgmap=\"41\">The decree is reversed, and the cause remanded, with leave to the complainant to amend his bill.</p> <p id=\"b41-5\" pgmap=\"41\">Decree reversed.</p> </opinion> </casebody> ",
