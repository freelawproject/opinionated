And the jury may also properly take into their consideration, in the estimation of damages, the articles which may have been proved to have been published by Dunaway injurious to the reputation of Thomas, if those articles were proven to have been made prior to, and in their statements were connected with, the publication complained of in the declaration.</summary><summary data-order=\"29\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b375-5\" pgmap=\"375\">4. \u2019 The filing of the plea of justification does not necessarily aggravate the damages, if the jury, from the testimony, believe that the defendant insisted upon such plea, believing in good faith that he could prove it.</summary><summary data-order=\"30\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b375-6\" pgmap=\"375\">5.

The pleading of inconsistent pleas under our statute is a matter of rigjit. The Statute of Illinois, page 823, Purple\u2019s edition, reads as follows: \u201c The defendant may plead as many matters of fact as he may deem necessary for his defense.\u201d</p><p data-order=\"67\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b378-6\" pgmap=\"378\">When the pleas of justification and general issue are both in, neither should be permitted to restrict the rights secured by either plea if pleaded alone. Neither should embarrass the other, either in the evidence to be admitted, or in the instructions to be given by the court. Such is a fair construction of our statute.</p><p data-order=\"68\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b378-7\" pgmap=\"378\">Our statute is a copy of the Virginia statute, which was passed in 1788, and reads thus: \u201cThe plaintiff in replevin, and the defendant in all other actions, may plead as many several matters, whether of law or fact, as he may think necessary for his defense.\u201d See Virginia Statutes at Large, printed in 1808, vol. 12, p. 745.</p><p data-order=\"69\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b378-8\" pgmap=\"378\">The Virginia statute has also been adopted by the States of Kentucky and Alabama, and the courts of those States have adopted the construction we contend for, that when the pleas of the general issue and justification are both in, the defendant has the same advantages he would have under each plea, if pleaded alone. When the statute of another State is adopted, we adopt the construction (if not against some public policy) which the courts of that State have given the statute. 2 B. Monroe, 213; 8 Leigh, 552, 553; 18 Alabama, 631; 20 Alabama, 413; 14 Ill. 425.</p><p data-order=\"70\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b378-9\" pgmap=\"378\">It is admitted that the New York and Massachusetts courts have created a system of law on this subject that is incon,-sistent with the position we assume. They have generally \u2022 decided, that where the general issue and justification are both pleaded, evidence in mitigation of damages is excluded, which would be admissible under the general issue if pleaded -alione; that the plea of justification is a reiteration of the slan-der, and in some cases, that the plea of justification may be \u00a1used to prove the publication.</p><p data-order=\"71\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b378-10\" pgmap=\"378\">The \u00a1New York and Massachusetts courts have always acted with .reference to the statute of Anne, or similar statutes, .which allowed double and inconsistent pleas, not as a matter *\u00a9f \u00a1right, but by leave of the court.</p><p data-order=\"72\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b379-4\" pgmap=\"379\">As to statute of Anne, see 1st vol. Chitty\u2019s Pleadings, pages 594, 595.</p><p data-order=\"73\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b379-5\" pgmap=\"379\">The New York statute is thus: \u201c The defendant in any action may plead as many several matters as he may think necessary for his defense, subject to the power of the court to compel him to elect by which plea he will abide, in cases where he may plead inconsistent pleas.\u201d Page 352 of vol. 2, N. Y. Statutes.</p><p data-order=\"74\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b379-6\" pgmap=\"379\">When the courts under such statutes grant the privilege of pleading double, there is perhaps some reason for controlling the party who has plead inconsistent pleas in his evidence. But that reason does not exist here, where the privilege of pleading double is matter of right, and not by leave of the court. See Pope v. Welse\u2019s Adm'r, 18 Alabama, 631.</p><p data-order=\"75\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b379-7\" pgmap=\"379\">2. If the foregoing position be correct, that Thomas had the same right to introduce evidence in mitigation of damages, and have it considered by the jury, that he would have had if the general issue alone had been pleaded, then the Circuit Court erred in rejecting Schooley\u2019s testimony and in its instructions to the jury. Any circumstances which disprove malice, and do not tend to prove the truth, may be given in evidence, under the general issue. Shehan v. Collins, 20 Ill. 325.</p><p data-order=\"76\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b379-8\" pgmap=\"379\">3. We cite the following cases as direct authority for the position that, matters of provocation and similar mitigating circumstances, and especially recent previous publications, may be given in evidence and considered by the jury in mitigation of damages, where the pleas of the general issue and justification are both pleaded. 15 B. Monroe, 198; 1 Md. R. 178; 2 Swann (Tenn.) 32; 13 Pick. 503.</p><p data-order=\"77\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b379-9\" pgmap=\"379\">4. We cite the following cases as direct authority for the position that evidence, showing that the defendant in an action for libel was not the fabricator of the charges, and that he received them from others under circumstances justifying the belief that the charges were true, may be admitted in evidence and considered by the jury in mitigation of damages, where the general issue and justification are both pleaded. 3 Washington Circuit Court Reports, 341; 1 Binney, 85, 90.</p><p data-order=\"78\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b380-4\" pgmap=\"380\">5. We insist, that under the plea of justification, when pleaded alone or with the general issue, all the facts and circumstances introduced in evidence to prove justification, but which fell short of proving it, should be allowed to be considered by the jury under cautionary instructions from the court, to prevent the misapplication of the evidence, in mitigation of damages. Such evidence could not be introduced under the general issue because that plea gives no notice, and its introduction would be a surprise upon the plaintiff; but when facts and circumstances are properly introduced under the plea of justification, which is notice, justice can be done in this case as in many other cases, only by allowing the jury to consider those facts and circumstances, where they fail to prove justification, either in aggravation or in mitigation of the damages.</p><p data-order=\"79\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b380-5\" pgmap=\"380\">The case in 2 Kern an, p. 67, well illustrates the position that justice cannot be done in many cases withoirt allowing the facts introduced to prove justification, but which fail to do it, to be considered in mitigation. The law upon the subject of slander and libel in New York, as created by their courts, became intolerable, and was abolished by statute, which allows, in an action for libel, upon notice, the introduction of the evidence of the truth of the charges, and the consideration of that evidence by the jury in mitigation of damages, though it fails to prove the justification. 15 Ill. 425; 4 Scam. 44.</p><p data-order=\"80\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b380-6\" pgmap=\"380\">In the case referred to in 15 Ill. 425, the court seem to have gone to the extent of what we contend for, in principle if not in language. They say that the failure to justify does not necessarily aggravate the damages, and that it is a question for the jury to decide in each case, whether the justification was interposed in good faith.</p><p data-order=\"81\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b380-7\" pgmap=\"380\">6. One of the instructions asked for by the defendant Thomas, was in these words: \u201cThe filing of the plea of justification does not necessarily aggravate the damages, if the jury, from the testimony, believe that the defendant insisted upon such plea, believing in good faith that he could prove it.\u201d</p><p data-order=\"82\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b380-8\" pgmap=\"380(11) 381(18)\">The refusal of the court below to give this instruction, is in direct conflict with the decision of the court in the case in 15 Ill., above referred to.</p><p data-order=\"83\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b381-5\" pgmap=\"381\">7. The damages were excessive, and though the courts are averse to reverse a case on this ground, we believe this to be an exceptional case.</p><p data-order=\"84\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b381-6\" pgmap=\"381\">8. The court below erred in not suppressing the depositions of John Weltner and William Dunaway.</p><p data-order=\"85\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b381-7\" pgmap=\"381\">These depositions were taken under a commission issued from the Oass Circuit Co.urt,directed to J. D. Springer, Esq., a justice of the peace of Fayette county, Pennsylvania.</p><p data-order=\"86\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b381-8\" pgmap=\"381\">There was no certificate of the official character of J. D. Springer, Justice, by the clerk of the \u201cproper court of record.\u201d 2 Scam. 348.</p><p data-order=\"87\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b381-9\" pgmap=\"381\">There is no evidence on the face of the certificate or otherwise, that the clerk of the Court of Common Pleas had any authority, under the laws of Pennsylvania, to give the certificate which is attached to the deposition; or that there was in said court any record evidence that Springer was a justice. Can the word \u201c proper,\u201d in the phrase \u201c proper court of record,\u201d be ignored ?

There was no error in overruling the motion to suppress the deposition of Weltner and the two Dunaways; appellant having appeared, by attorney, at the examination of the witnesses, and waived the putting of cross-interrogatories, thereby waiving his right to except \"to their formality. Appellant failed to except to the decision of the Cass Circuit Court in overruling the motion to suppress the depositions of the Dunaways and Weltner, as appears by the record, and a party cannot be permitted to assign for error in the Supreme Court, any decision or opinion of the Circuit Court, made during the progress of the cause, in the propriety of which, at the time of its occurrence, he silently acquiesced.

Durell, 11 Ill. 72.</p><p data-order=\"96\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b382-9\" pgmap=\"382\">The same facts stated in said depositions were proved by Jas.

A defendant in libel cannot show, in mitigation of damages, that he has been informed of libelous matter by another person, and if he could, Schooley was not the proper person by whom to prove what J. E. Dunaway had communicated to appellant, he being the best evidence, and having testified to the same facts on the trial. Coleman v. Southwick, 9 John. 45; Treat v. Browning and Wife, 4 Conn. 408; Mapes v. Weeks, 4 Wend. 659; Wolcott v. Hall, 6 Mass. 514; Bush v. Prosser, 1 Kernan, 347; Sheahan v.

There was no error in refusing the instructions 3, 4, 5, and 7. \"It is not error to refuse even a proper instruction, if the court gives other instructions, embracing the correct principle of law involved in the instruction refused. Bland v. The People, 8 Scam. 364.</p><p data-order=\"99\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b383-5\" pgmap=\"383\">All the evidence offered by the defendant below (except the testimony of Schooley to show that Thomas had heard the libelous matter from witness and J.

Dunaway) was admitted by the court, and by the plaintiff\u2019s instructions was fairly submitted to the consideration of the jury in estimating the amount of damages.</p><p data-order=\"100\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b383-6\" pgmap=\"383\">4. A court will not grant a new trial, or reverse a judgment on error, because of the admission of improper or the rejection of proper testimony, or for want of proper direction or misdirection of the judge who tried the case, provided the court can clearly see, by an inspection of the whole record, that justice has been done, and that the error complained of could not have affected the merits of the case, or influenced the verdict of the jury. Gillet v. Sweat, 1 Gilm. 475; Hill v. Ward, 2 Gilm. 285; Blanchard v. Morris, 15 Ill. 35; Young v. Silkwood, 11 Ill. 36; Greenup v. Stokes, 3 Gilm. 202; Wheeler v. Shields, 2 Scam. 349; Bland v. The People, 3 Scam. 364.</p><p data-order=\"101\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b383-7\" pgmap=\"383\">5. The damages must be outrageous, otherwise the court will not interfere. Tillotson v. Cheetham, 2 John. 74; Southwick v. Stevens, 10 John. 443; Coleman v. Southwick, 9 John. 45; 16 Ill. 405; 2 Gilm. 432.</p><p data-order=\"102\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b383-8\" pgmap=\"383\">6. The fact proposed to be proven by Schooley that he had informed appellant (Thomas) that appellee had deposited $1,000 after coming to this country, was immaterial under the pleading in this case; and the witness, J. E. Dunaway, had already testified that he had communicated the matter charged in the libel complained of to the appellant (Thomas) before the publication of the same.</p><p data-order=\"103\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b383-9\" pgmap=\"383(41) 384(17)\">7. In this State, the rule in relation to mitigating testimony in actions of slander and libel, is: 1st, That defendant may show the general bad character of the plaintiff; and, 2nd, Facts and circumstances which tend to disprove malice, but do not tend to prove the truth of the charge. 2 Gilm. 140; 20 Ill. 225.</p> <opinion data-order=\"104\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\"> <author id=\"b384-5\" pgmap=\"384\">Walker, J.</author> <p id=\"AE9\" pgmap=\"384\">It was insisted, upon the argument, that the Circuit Court erred in overruling the motion to suppress the depositions of Weltner and William Dunaway. After a careful examination of the record, we are unable to find that any exception was noted, or bill of exceptions signed, showing any objection to that decision. But it is insisted, that on the trial, at a subsequent term, when the depositions were offered to be read in evidence, an objection was taken, and is preserved in the record. This does appear from the bill of exceptions, but no specific grounds of objection seem to have been taken. It was only a general objection, and could only be applied to the substance, and not the form of the depositions. If they were relevant to the issue, they were properly admissible. Objections to form cannot be taken on the trial, and the objections urged against these depositions were only formal, and do not go to their materiality. This error is not well assigned.</p> <p id=\"b384-6\" pgmap=\"384\">It is also insisted, that the court erred in not permitting the witness, Schooley, to testify that appellant, before he made the publication, had been informed by Jesse Dunaway, that all the charges were true. Jesse Dunaway had already testified that he gave the information upon which the appellant made the publication. He had also already testified, that the facts were true, except as it related to depositing the thousand dollars with Mrs. Armstrong, of which he knew nothing. It is true that Tate testified, that Jesse Dunaway said to him, after the article was published, that the charges were not true; but there is no evidence that he denied giving the information to appellant. It would, therefore, seem to be a matter of no consequence, whether Schooley testified to that fact, as it does not seem to have been controverted, that Dun-away did give the information.</p> <p id=\"b384-7\" pgmap=\"384(17) 385(71)\">Schooley testified, that he informed appellant about the deposit of the thousand dollars. The publications made by appellee, in reference to appellant, were also- in evidence, and subject to the consideration of the jury. Appellant, therefore, seems to have had the benefit of all the mitigating circumstances, and unless the court misdirected the jury, he must have received its full benefit on the trial. As all this evidence was received without objection, no question can arise, whether it was admissible under the pleadings in the case.</p> <p id=\"b385-5\" pgmap=\"385\">It is again insisted, that the court erred in refusing to give appellant\u2019s third, fourth, fifth and seventh instructions. The third requested the court to inform the jury, that in estimating the amount of damages, if the plea of justification was not sustained, they should consider whether the publication was made by appellant, in the honest belief that it was true, and in estimating the damages, consider the articles published by appellee prior to that made by appellant, and upon which suit was brought. No reason is perceived why this instruction was not given, although it is contended, that under a plea of justification, nothing can be shown in mitigation.</p> <p id=\"b385-6\" pgmap=\"385\">The defendant, by pleading the general issue, in libel and slander, virtually admits that the plaintiff is innocent of the charge upon which suit is brought. But if, on the trial, it appears that defendant did publish the slanderous matter, he may, under that issue, show any circumstance .in mitigation, which tends to disprove malice, but does not tend to prove the truth of the charge. The publications made by appellee against appellant, prior to the publication sued upon, did not tend to prove the truth of the charge, and were, therefore, admissible to mitigate damages under the general issue. These publications, made by appellee, may have shown that they were highly calculated to provoke appellant, and that his act was not of such a wanton, reckless and malicious character as to require severe punishment.</p> <p id=\"b385-7\" pgmap=\"385(61) 386(106)\">The question still remains undetermined, whether a defendant may, after he has pleaded the truth of the charge, in justification of the publication, and after again repeating the charges and spreading it on the record, on failing to prove its truth, give evidence in mitigation. It seems to be the settled practice in Great Britain, followed by some of the courts in this country, that he cannot. In other courts, a different rule has obtained. It appears that the practice is not very well settled. But this court, in the case of Cummerford v. McAvoy, 15 Ill. 311, in which both pleas were filed, held, that the jury might consider the quo animo with which the charge was made. That the intention of the party in publishing the slander is the controlling consideration with the jury. It cannot be held that the publication of slanderous matter without malice, is to be punished with the same damages as if it were wantonly and maliciously done.</p> <p id=\"b386-4\" pgmap=\"386\">Again, in the case of Sloan v. Petrie, 15 Ill. 425, it was said, that a class of cases hold, that where the justification is not fully established, the circumstances proved may be considered in mitigating damages. Numerous authorities are referred to in that case, in'support of the'doctrine. The court also say, in case a plea of justification is filed, it is the province of the jury to determine whether the circumstances render it an aggravation. It would seem to be apparent, that the converse of that rule should also obtain, if the plea was filed in good faith, and evidence was introduced honestly for the purpose of proving the plea. In such a case the evidence should be considered in mitigation of damages.</p> <p id=\"b386-5\" pgmap=\"386\">If the jury believed, from all the circumstances in the case, that appellant relied upon and was satisfied of the truth of the statements made to him by Jesse Dunaway, and that he was not actuated solely by malignity, they would have been justified in giving less damages than if the publication had been wantonly made. If, on the contrary, he knew that the witness was unworthy of belief, and only resorted to his evidence to further injure and blacken the character of appellee, it would aggravate the damages instead of mitigating the offense. These are properly questions for the consideration of the jury, and' were presented by this instruction, which should have been given. In the view we have taken of the case, the fourth should also have been given. But nothing in the record is perceived which required the giving of the fifth.</p> <p id=\"b386-6\" pgmap=\"386(8) 387(106)\">The seventh instruction was properly refused. The bur-then of proving that appellee had appropriated the money for which the cattle were sold, had been assumed by appellant. Nor did it devolve upon appellee to show what disposition he had made of the money, when appellant proved that it came to his hands. The law does not presume that because money has been entrusted to an individual, that he has embezzled or appropriated it to his own use. Appellant has asserted in his plea that appellee had appropriated the money, and he must establish its truth or fail in his defense. It did not devolve upon appellee to disprove the charge.</p> <p id=\"b387-5\" pgmap=\"387\">Although some of appellee\u2019s instructions are not drawn with accurate precision, they were not, we think, calculated to mislead the jury, especially when all are considered together, as they no doubt were. No other error is perceived in this record. But for refusing to give the third and fourth of the appellant\u2019s instructions, the judgment of the Circuit Court must be reversed, and the cause remanded.</p> <p id=\"b387-6\" pgmap=\"387\">Judgment reversed.</p> </opinion> </casebody> ",
