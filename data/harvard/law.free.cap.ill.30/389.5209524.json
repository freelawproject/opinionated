I do not recollect whether I sold the alcohol to Neal, spoken of before, but I have strictly complied with the ordinances of the town of Salem, regulating such sale. I have reported all sales I made, and never sold at any time, nor to any person, without a prescription from a physician, or by satisfactory assurances that it was -for chemical, medicinal, mechanical or sacramental purposes. It was a strict rule of the house to sell no other way. Father is a physician, not now practicing; I have seen father refuse to sell even on the prescription of a physician, when he thought it was not in good faith.\u201d</p><p data-order=\"21\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b390-6\" pgmap=\"390\">This was all the evidence in the case.</p><p data-order=\"22\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b390-7\" pgmap=\"390\">The court instructed the jury for the People, as follows:</p><p data-order=\"23\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b390-8\" pgmap=\"390(30) 391(63)\">That if you believe, from the evidence, that the defendant by himself, or agent, sold spirituous liquors in less quantity than one gallon, within eighteen months prior to finding this indictment, then it devolves on defendant to show that he did so by authority of the corporation, and unless he has shown that each and every sale proved by the prosecution was made strictly in conformity to the corporation ordinance, you should find the defendant guilty for every sale not made in conformity to the provisions of the ordinance of the law.</p><p data-order=\"24\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b391-5\" pgmap=\"391\">The court was asked to instruct the jury for defendant, as follows:</p><p data-order=\"25\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b391-6\" pgmap=\"391\">That if the jury believe, from the evidence, that defendant acted in good faith in this case, and complied with the ordinance of the town of Salem regulating the sale of spirituous liquors, and sold the same for medicinal, chemical, mechanical or sacramental purposes, then the jury will find for the defendant.</p><p data-order=\"26\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b391-7\" pgmap=\"391\">Court modified the instruction by striking out the words chemical, mechanical or sacramental, and gave the instruction as modified.</p><p data-order=\"27\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b391-8\" pgmap=\"391\">Jury returned a verdict of guilty on one count.

White, for Defendants in Error.</attorneys> <opinion data-order=\"45\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\"> <author id=\"b392-12\" pgmap=\"392\">Breese, J.</author> <p id=\"An2\" pgmap=\"392\">It is unnecessary to pass upon the point raised as to the want of a venire for the grand jury, since we are of opinion, on the merits, that the judgment should be reversed. Power has been conferred by law, over this whole subject, to incorporated towns, which they may regulate by ordinance. That power has been exercised by the town of Salem, and restraining and regulating ordinances passed by its authorities.</p> <p id=\"b392-13\" pgmap=\"392\">To that authority was the defendant amenable, and to that alone. He could not be punished under those ordinances, and by the State laws also, which would be the case, should this prosecution be sustained.</p> <p id=\"b392-14\" pgmap=\"392(49) 393(42)\">Incorporated towns have the power to declare that the sale of spirituous liquors within their limits shall be deemed a nuisance, and punished as such. They have the exclusive privilege of granting licenses to sell such liquors, (Scates\u2019 Comp. 206,) and to prescribe the terms on which they may be sold within the limits of the incorporation, and no person need have any other license than the town ordinances. If he brings himself within their provisions, he cannot be, and ought not to be, punished. This the defendant succeeded in doing.</p> <p id=\"b393-5\" pgmap=\"393\">Another objection made is, that pure alcohol is not, in legal parlance, a spirituous liquor. It is not, in common parlance, so considered, although it is the basis of all spirituous liquors. We are not prepared to say, however, that selling pure alcohol is not selling spirituous liquor.</p> <p id=\"b393-6\" pgmap=\"393\">For the reason that this whole subject has been committed by law, to incorporated towns, and the town of Salem having acted upon it, by passing the necessary ordinances, an indictment for the offense alleged to have been committed in that town, cannot be maintained.</p> <p id=\"b393-7\" pgmap=\"393\">The judgment therefore must be reversed. One word as to the manner in which the cleric has made up this record. He has incorporated into it the affidavits of the witnesses claiming their fees for attendance. This is unwarranted, and cannot be tolerated, and costs cannot be taxed therefor.</p> <p id=\"b393-8\" pgmap=\"393\">The judgment is reversed. Judgment reversed.</p> </opinion> </casebody> ",
