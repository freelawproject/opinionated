That the wine bought by defendant was intoxicating liquor. That plaintiff (Sutter) was at the time of such sale a regularly licensed dram-shop keeper in the city of St. Louis and State of Missouri, and that the liquor was sold by him at his dram-shop in said city. Defendant then introduced the Revised Statutes of the State of Missouri, of 1856, and read in evidence the following section of chapter fifty-seven, entitled \u201c Dram-Shops,\u201d as follows : \u201c Seo. 2. A dram-shop keeper is a person permitted, by law, being licensed according to the provisions of this act, to sell intoxicating liquors in any quantity not exceeding ten gallons.\u201d Also section five of the same chapter, to wit: \u201c Seo. 5. If any dram-shop keeper shall sell any intoxicating liquors on credit, such sales, and all debts contracted therefor, shall be void and not recoverable by law.\u201d</p><p data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b163-5\" pgmap=\"163\">This was all the evidence in the case, upon which the court found for Sutter, $22.</p><p data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b163-6\" pgmap=\"163\">Anstedt moved for a new trial, because the finding was contrary to law and to evidence; which motion was overruled by the court, and to which decision of the court Anstedt excepted at the time.</p><attorneys data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b163-7\" pgmap=\"163\">W.

The sale is equally on a credit whether there is an express or implied agreement to pay at a future time.

All sales are presumed to be for cash unless a credit is proved.</p><p data-order=\"21\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b164-5\" pgmap=\"164\">2.

The fact that the appellee told the appellant he had better go home, when he had become drunk, does not prove that the wine when sold to him was sold on credit.</p><p data-order=\"23\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b164-7\" pgmap=\"164\">4. The statute was designed to prevent dram-shop keepers from selling liquor when they know the drinker has not the present means of paying for it.</p> <opinion data-order=\"24\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\"> <author id=\"b164-8\" pgmap=\"164\">Caton, C. J.</author> <p id=\"A9o\" pgmap=\"164\">There is no doubt in our minds that this wine was sold upon a credit, within the meaning of the statute of Missouri. It certainly was not sold for cash, nor is there anything to show that the plaintiff expected immediate payment for it. On the other hand, all the circumstances of the case show that he did not expect immediate payment. He delivered the liquor as called for by the defendant, and then allowed him to depart, without even asking him for the pay, but even advised him to go home, without any allusion to a settlement of the bill. Whether he expected the defendant would call the next day and pay for it, or whether he expected the credit would run for three months, is a matter of no consequence. If the liquor was delivered with the design that it should be paid for at a future time, whether a long, or a short, or an uncertain time, it was equally a sale on a credit.</p> <p id=\"b164-9\" pgmap=\"164\">The judgment must be reversed, and the cause remanded.</p> <p id=\"b164-10\" pgmap=\"164\">Judgment reversed.</p> </opinion> </casebody> ",
