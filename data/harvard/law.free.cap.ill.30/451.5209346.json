In the first, it is alleged, that on the 16th day of October, 1860, the defendant had possession and control of the \u201c Great Western Railroad,\u201d and had the right to use and operate the same, and run engines and trains, etc., thereon, and that he did so use the same; that the said road had been open for use more than six months prior to the committing of the grievances, etc.; that it was the duty of defendant to erect, and keep in good repair on each side of said road, fences, sufficient to prevent horses, cattle, sheep, and hogs from getting on said railroad, except at the crossing of public roads, and within the limits of towns, cities and villages, with opening gates or bars at farm crossings, etc., and to construct and maintain, at public road-crossings, suitable and sufficient cattle-guards, etc., and to erect and maintain such fences on all unenclosed lands within five miles of any settlement, etc., and except what owners of lands had fenced, or agreed with said company to fence, etc.; that, nevertheless, defendant failed to perform these various duties, by means whereof the horse of the plaintiff, of the value of $150, strayed and got on to said railroad on the day and year aforesaid, and on divers other days since, and that the defendant, by its servants, so carelessly, negligently, and improperly run, conducted, and directed the engines and trains of defendant, that by means thereof and through such carelessness, neglect and improper conduct of said servants, run the engine upon the horse of plaintiff, by and through the neglect of defendant to erect and keep in repair, etc., and did thereby kill the said horse for the want of good fences without the limits of cities, towns and villages, and within five miles of settlements on and along said road, and for the want of cattle-guards, etc.</summary><summary data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b450-5\" pgmap=\"450\">The second count alleges that the horse was killed by means of the gross willfulness, carelessness and neglect of the servants of defendant in running the engines and trains.</summary><summary data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b450-6\" pgmap=\"450\">Plea, Not guilty.</summary><summary data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b450-7\" pgmap=\"450\">Trial.

Some eight or ten feet from the road the fence on both sides bends east for a couple of pannels and joins cattle-guard in shape of a funnel, the guard being a few feet east of the general direction of the fence. This is outside of the city limits. The horse seemed to have been thrown from the track fifty or sixty feet east of guard ; signs of hair and blood from the guard to that point; there were indications that the horse was going east. According to recorded plats the city limits are one-fourth of a mile east of the depot. Peddecord &amp; Burrow\u2019s addition is part of the south-east one-fourth of south-east one-fourth of 11,16, 2, and lies north of the road, and extends east to the fence at the cattle-guard.</p><attorneys data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b451-5\" pgmap=\"451\">Wesley Lehn.</attorneys><p data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"Ac\" pgmap=\"451\">Rode horse to country the Tuesday evening before he was killed; horse broke loose and got away from defendant; next saw him where he was buried near the railroad, where he had been dragged thirty or forty feet south from the road to a point about thirty feet east of the fence ; open prairie from depot to where horse was killed; going east, might be seen three or four hundred yards\u2014coming west, might have been seen six hundred yards.

never was over the line where the road crosses it, and cannot positively say that the guard is on the line, but is of that impression ; knows that there is an established corner three-fourths of a mile north ; at this corner the fence spoken of is on the line; knows another established corner one-fourth of a mile south ; the line of the fence at this corner is something west of the corner, so that the general direction of the fence from the south end is a little east of north, and the cattle-guard would be a few feet west of the guard, but where the fence on each side approaches to within eight or ten feet of the track, then it bends eastward and towards the cattle-guard; the cattle-guard is evidently very close to the section line; cannot state that the guard, or any part of it, is upon the line or within the corporate limits.</p><attorneys data-order=\"23\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b452-7\" pgmap=\"452\">George Stewart.</attorneys><p data-order=\"24\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"A84\" pgmap=\"452\">Cattle-guard seven feet wide, two feet or twenty-six inches deep ;

Nelson, for Plaintiffs in Error.</attorneys><p data-order=\"44\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b454-14\" pgmap=\"454\">I. The instructions given by the court to the jury for Morthland, the plaintiff below, were improperly given, because inapplicable to the proof in the case, and therefore calculated to mislead the jury. Hill v. Ward, 2 Gilm. 293.</p><p data-order=\"45\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b454-15\" pgmap=\"454\">There is no evidence in this record to support the hypothesis upon which the first instruction for plaintiff below is predicated.</p><p data-order=\"46\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b454-16\" pgmap=\"454\">There is no evidence going to show any deficiency or absence of fences or cattle-guards at any point where defendant below was bound to erect and maintain them.</p><p data-order=\"47\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b454-17\" pgmap=\"454\">Slaughter is the only witness who speaks upon the subject of the company\u2019s fences. His language is: \u201c The company have no fences in the vicinity, and there is a settlement east within five miles.\u201d This being the whole evidence on this subject, is insufficient to warrant the first instruction for plaintiff below.</p><p data-order=\"48\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b454-18\" pgmap=\"454(9) 455(70)\">The company might \u201chave no fences in the vicinity,\u201d because the vicinity might be fenced by the land owners. It might be where it was not necessary, from the nature of the ground or method of the construction of the track, to make a fence. It might be, as in this case is shown by all the proof, within the limits of a city incorporated. Immediately west of where the horse was killed, was within the limits of Decatur.</p><p data-order=\"49\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b455-5\" pgmap=\"455\">Within those limits, there was a fence connected with a cattle-guard directly across the direction of the road, and the proof is utterly silent as to whether the road east of the cattle-guard, at the city limits, was fenced or not.</p><p data-order=\"50\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b455-6\" pgmap=\"455\">A defect of fence must be averred and proved in order to a recovery by plaintiff below. Ohio and Mississippi Railroad Company v. Brown, 23 Ill. 95, 96.</p><p data-order=\"51\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b455-7\" pgmap=\"455\">This first instruction assumes that there is proof showing a defect of fences when there is no such proof.</p><p data-order=\"52\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b455-8\" pgmap=\"455\">II. There is no proof whatever, that this killing was either negligently or willfully done. This court has already decided that proof of a killing is not proof of a negligent or willful killing. Chicago and Mississippi Railroad Company v. Patchen, 16 Ill. 198.</p><p data-order=\"53\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b455-9\" pgmap=\"455\">Therefore, the second instruction for plaintiff below is unwarranted under the proof, calculated to mislead, and therefore improperly given. 2 Gilm. 293.</p><p data-order=\"54\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b455-10\" pgmap=\"455\">III. The proof is insufficient to warrant the verdict. It is not shown that the horse did not get on to the track at one of the excepted places enumerated in the statute. This must appear both in the allegations and proof, and a failure of proof is fatal to plaintiff below. 20 Ill. 390; 23 Ill. 95, 96.</p><p data-order=\"55\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b455-11\" pgmap=\"455\">On the contrary, the point at which, and the manner in-which, he was struck, shows that he must have got on the track within the city limits, and received the injury on the guard, on the eastern limit of the city. If so, proof of negligence or willfulness in the act of running on him must be shown, and this is not done.</p><p data-order=\"56\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b455-12\" pgmap=\"455\">The last instruction asked by defendant below, and by the court refused, should have been given.</p><p data-order=\"57\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b455-13\" pgmap=\"455(11) 456(21)\">The duty to construct fences and guards is statutory, and a railroad company can only be held responsible for failure to construct and maintain them at those places specified in the act.</p><p data-order=\"58\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b456-5\" pgmap=\"456\">The limits of a corporate city, town or village is not one of those places; and a defective cattle-guard at the point where the road passed the eastern limit of the city of Decatur, cannot be urged as a ground of recovery for plaintiff below, because the company was not bound to have a guard of any kind there. 23 Ill. 95; Act 14th of February, 1855, p. 173, (Scates, Treat &amp; Blackwell\u2019s Stat. 953.)</p><attorneys data-order=\"59\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b456-6\" pgmap=\"456\">S. G. Malone, for Defendant in Error.</attorneys><p data-order=\"60\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b456-7\" pgmap=\"456\">The proof shows that there was a fence running north and south across the road at the cattle-guards, and that there was no fence at all made by the railroad company. Great Western R. R. Co. of 1859 v. Helm, 27 Ill. 198.</p><p data-order=\"61\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b456-8\" pgmap=\"456\">The court held, in the case of Galena and Chicago Union R. R. Co. v. Crawford, 25 Ill. 529, that when the road has not been fenced, etc., the plaintiff need only show the want of the fence, and the damage, etc.</p> <opinion data-order=\"62\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\"> <author id=\"b456-9\" pgmap=\"456\">Caton, C. J.</author> <p id=\"Adz\" pgmap=\"456(186) 457(151)\">There is a cattle-guard across the railroad at or within a few feet of the eastern limits of the city of Decatur. The evidence does not show, nor is it of the least importance, whether the road was fenced east of this point, for it had no connection with the accident. The evidence leaves no doubt on the mind that the plaintiff\u2019s horse got upon the track where it passes through the commons within the city limits, and when the midnight train going east came along, it became frightened and ran before the engine on the track, until it came to the cattle-guard at the city limits, when it was struck by the engine and pushed along upon the track fifty or sixty feet, and then was thrown from the track, and was so injured thereby as to become valueless. Upon these simple facts, of which no one who will examine the evidence can entertain a doubt, the question of liability depends. The law which requires railroad companies to fence their roads in certain places, has nothing to do with it, for the horse, beyond all doubt, got upon the track where no fence was required, and followed it until he reached the cattle-guard, at which obstruction he was overtaken and injured. Any omission to keep up fences or cattle-guards, if any was proved, did not tend in the most remote degree to produce the injury. The fault, or the misfortune, if you please, was altogether on the part of the plaintiff in allowing his horse to be loose on the common in the town where the road was not required to he fenced, and whence he strayed upon the track where he had no right to go, and from this cause resulted the injury. The plaintiff must himself bear the consequences of his own fault or his own misfortune. There is no proof of carelessness on the part of those in charge of the train. Illinois Central R. R. Co. v. Phelps, 29 Ill. 447.</p> <p id=\"b457-5\" pgmap=\"457\">The judgment must be reversed, and the cause remanded.</p> <p id=\"b457-6\" pgmap=\"457\">Judgment reversed.</p> </opinion> </casebody> ",
