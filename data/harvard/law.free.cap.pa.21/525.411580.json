Merrill, </em>for the County.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AaM\">\u2014 It was said that the University was a corporation; and it was contended that the defendant having been appointed by the trustees of the institution as <em>professor, </em>his position was an <em>office. </em>That in the case of Commonwealth <em>v. </em>Cuyler, 5 <em>W. &amp; Ser. </em>275, the decision in favor of the defendant was on the ground that his salary was not- received for his services <em>as a corporator, </em>but as a spiritual teacher, and was made up by voluntary contributions. This case and the case of Agnew reported with it, were made on the Acts of 1840 and 1841.</p>\n<p data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b527-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"527\">*527</page-number>But if the defendant be not liable to a tax of <em>two </em>per cent, on his income, as a salary or emolument <em>of </em>office, it was submitted whether he was not liable to taxation to the amount of <em>one </em>per cent, on his income from an occupation or profession.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b527-6\">Miller, contr\u00e1.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"ACY\">\u2014 It was contended that the defendant in the case stated was not an <em>officer. </em>That a railroad company was incorporated for pecuniary profit to its stockholders, but that there were no stockholders in the University of Lewisbfirg.

Starting with the principle that all persons ought to contribute to the expenses of government, we should rather presume the contrary. But it is said that the state does not tax the means of education, either secular or religious. True enough, yet it may tax those who make education their business and livelihood. This is certainly as reasonable as taxing the salaries paid by the public itself out of the taxes. The defendant is not however properly an officer of the corporation, but a person in its employment, and his salary ought to be taxed only one per cent, as for an occupation or profession: 5 <em>W. &amp; Ser. </em>275.</p>\n<p id=\"b527-10\">Judgment reversed, and judgment for plaintiff for six dollars.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
