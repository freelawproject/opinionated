Smith, and others, for levying and selling twenty hogs, which she alleged belonged to her, and which were sold by Smith, as sheriff, under an execution issued on a judgment obtained in January, 1852, in favor of Keeney, against John M. Good, <em>the husband of the plaintiff.</em></summary>\n<summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b349-17\">John M. Good, in 1847, was the owner of the real estate on which he and his wife resided. He failed in 1847, and by deed of voluntary assignment for the benefit of creditors, dated the 31st March, 1847, conveyed real estate to assignees who acted in trust, and distributed through an auditor about $13 or $14 in the hundred to Good\u2019s creditors, leaving him largely insolvent, and among his creditors was Samuel Keeney, one of the defendants. The real estate of John M. Good was sold by his assignees at public sale to Jacob Rheem for $1100, and by him sold to Maria Good, the de<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"350\">*350</page-number>fendant in error, on 16th October, 1848, for $1500, $50 to be paid in hand, and the balance in annual payments of $241.60, with interest. She gave the $50 to Rheem, but where she got it or how it was obtained was not shown on her part; but on the part of the defendants it was proved that in 1844 she got $50 from her mother. It was not shown that she had received in her own right any more money. After this alleged purchase by her was made, Good and his wife entered into an agreement, under seal, by which she appointed him her agent to carry on the distillery and the farm in her name, for which she agreed to pay him $20 per month for his services. The distillery was carried on, and stock was purchased, whiskey made and sold, and various payments made on account of the real estate, two of the instalments remaining unpaid to Rheem.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b350-6\">A witness on part of <em>plaintiff </em>testified that seventeen at least of the twenty hogs sold by the sheriff, had been purchased by Good, <em>as agent of his wife. </em>That he knew that Good was doing business for his wife.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b350-7\">Another witness testified that in January, 1852, Good purchased grain from him; that he charged it to him <em>as agent; </em>that he credited him on the strength of being the agent of his wife. Due-bill was given, signed by him as agent.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b350-8\">Several of the witnesses, produced on the part of the defence, testified that after the purchase from Rheem, they transacted business with Good, and did not understand from him that he was acting as agent of his wife. One of them, however, Kauffman, testified that he worked at the distillery for fourteen months; that the business was done in Good\u2019s name ; that he was hired by Good and paid by him; that he received <em>some money </em>from the wife on account of his wages. He further testified, <em>under </em>objection, <em>that (food told him, </em>whilst he was living there, that <em>he was doing business for his wife. </em>That he quit work there in 1851. That he had got small sums from Mrs. Good.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b350-9\">A policy of insurance, dated 16th July, 1849, was taken by Good as <em>agent </em>of his wife.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b350-10\">On the part of the plaintiff, points as follows were submitted :</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b350-11\">1. That upon the insolvency of a husband it is not unlawful that he should become the agent of his wife in the transaction of business, either upon her own capital or that furnished or intrusted to her by others. 2. And in this case, if Maria Good purchased the real estate upon her own credit, for the purpose of carrying on the business of distilling, and her husband John Good carried it on as her agent, and thereby the means of paying for the property were earned, it was a legal and rightful appropriation of the means and not fraudulent. 3. If the facts be as stated in the first and second points, and the hogs, the value of which is the subject of this suit, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"351\">*351</page-number>were purchased by and in the name and upon the credit of Maria Good, it was a lawful transaction; and the fact that they were paid for by the labor and exertions of John Good, her husband, acting as her agent, does not make it less so.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b351-6\">On the part of the <em>defendants </em>was submitted a point as follows :\u2014</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b351-7\">The plaintiff claims to be the owner of the property charged in the declaration to have been taken away, by purchase during her coverture and after the insolvency of her husband. Under such circumstances she must show by evidence which does not admit of a reasonable doubt, that she bought it with her own money, and paid for it with funds which were <em>not </em>furnished by her husband. No such evidence has been given in this case. The plaintiff therefore is not entitled to recover, and the verdict should be for the defendants.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b351-8\">Graham, J., answered in the <em>affirmative </em>the points submitted on the part of the plaintiff.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b351-9\">As to the defendant\u2019s point, he said,. \u201c We answer the first part of this point in the affirmative. The plaintiff must show by evidence which does not admit of a reasonable doubt that she bought the property with her own money, and paid for it with funds which were not furnished by her husband; but we decline saying to you that there is no such evidence in this case, and that therefore the plaintiffs cannot recover.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b351-10\">He added: \u201c You will inquire whether the agency was a fair <em>bond fide </em>transaction, entered into between the husband and wife for the purpose of enabling an insolvent man to support his wife and family. If it was, and if Mrs. Good paid the fifty dollars, hand money on the purchase of the real estate, out of her own means not furnished to her by her husband, and if the balance which has been paid on the real estate and the price of the hogs bought was made out of the business conducted honestly and fairly by her husband for the object stated, then the plaintiff may recover; but you must be satisfied of these facts by clear, satisfactory, and undoubted evidence on the part of the plaintiff.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"21\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b351-11\">\u201c On the contrary, if the agency of the husband was merely colourable; if the arrangement was entered into to enable the husband to secure his property from his creditors, with an understanding that the property was his and not his wife\u2019s, then the law would not lend its sanction to such arrangement, and the defendants would be entitled to your verdict.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"22\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b351-12\">Verdict was rendered for plaintiff for $247.24.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"23\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b351-13\">Error was assigned: 1st.

The declarations of the husband were admissible as part of the transaction. Whatever were the common law rights of the husband and wife, equity always protected the separate property of the wife from the improvidence or misfortune of her husband. The husband may be trustee for his wife ; and if property be settled to the separate use of the wife, and there be no trustee to support it, the husband will be considered trustee, though he was not a party to the instrument : 2 <em>Kent </em>162 The 6th section of the Act of 1848 provides that all property that shall accrue to a married woman shall be <em>owned, used, and enjoyed </em>by her as her own separate property; that it shall not be liable for his debts, and that he shall not transfer it. It is contended on part of the plaintiffs <em>in error, </em>that if the husband be insolvent he shall not aid his wife in the use of her property without the risk of subjecting it to his debts. But it was said that one object of the Act of 1848 was to enable a wife to have separate property, and if she pleased, do business in order to support her family.

J.</author>\n<p id=\"A4V\">\u2014 The plaintiff is the wife of John M. Good, who owned certain lands on which a distillery was built. Becoming insolvent in 1847, Good made an assignment for the benefit of his creditors. The assignee sold the land to one Rheem for $1100, and by Rheem it was subsequently conveyed to Mrs. Good, the present plaintiff, for the consideration of $1500. Of this sum, $50 were paid at the time the deed was made, and the bonds and mortgage of both the husband and wife were afterwards given for the balance. About $1000 of principal and interest seems to have been paid on the bonds. Immediately after the deed to Mrs. Good, she and her husband made a written agreement that the husband <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"354\">*354</page-number>should carry on the business of farming and distilling in her name, accounting to her for the profits, and receiving from her wages at the rate of $20 per month. While he was doing business under this agreement, \u00a3e bought a lot of hogs, brought them to the distillery, and fed them there for a time. The defendants levied on them as the husband\u2019s property, and the wife brought this action of trespass.</p>\n<p id=\"Arr\">Upon these facts the defendants asked the Court for a peremptory charge in their favor. This the Court refused, but on the contrary submitted the case to the jury, with instructions to find for the plaintiff if the agreement was an honest one, made for the purpose of enabling an insolvent man to support his family, and if the first $50 was paid with the wife\u2019s money, and the balance out of the profits of the business.</p>\n<p id=\"b354-7\">An insolvent man is well protected in Pennsylvania. The barbarous system of imprisonment for debt is totally abolished, and thrown aside among the rubbish of the dark ages. He can retain real property or goods to the value of $300, which his creditors may not touch. He cannot be prevented from applying the fruits of his personal industry to the maintenance and education of his family; for the wages of his labor are not liable to attachment. But after supporting his family, he must give the best exertions of his mind and body to his creditors. Tins is but his reasonable duty \u2014 a duty sanctioned by all laws, moral, civil, and divine. Ho effectual mode of evading it has yet been invented. The usual device of covering the property of the debtor under the name of some friend, or a member of his family, will only answer the purpose as long as it remains undiscovered. I need not say how deeply all such shams are branded by the law with the marks of its detestation.</p>\n<p id=\"b354-8\">Creditors may regard the mere possession and use of personal property by a debtor as evidence that no stranger has a right to it, unless it has once already been taken for his debts, and bought in for him at a judicial sale, or unless he has it as a borrower or other bailee. But by the act of 11th April, 1848, a married woman may have property in her own right which shall not be subject to levy for her husband\u2019s debts. Of such property possession is no test of title. The rule in Twyne\u2019s Case, cannot, in the nature of things, be applied to a wife\u2019s goods in favor of her husband\u2019s creditors, without either compelling a separation or rendering the law inoperative. He may ride in her carriage, eat at her table, sleep in her bed, and live in a house filled with her furniture, without making what he uses liable to be seized under an execution issued against him. Under such a system, what is to restrain an indebted man from keeping all he has in the name of his wife ? The one human being whose whole earthly interest is bound up in his own, is freed from the restraint of a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"355\">*355</page-number>rule which is necessary to prevent even strangers from becoming the instruments of his frauds. It is easy enough to let the wife make all the purchases; or the husband may make them himself professedly as her agent. And jf the burden of proving that the money was furnished by the husband is thrown upon the creditors, their hope of justice must always be a forlorn one. Thus administered, the act of 1848 would be the worst one ever passed, and the most poisonous to the morals of the people. It would hold out constant temptations to families in embarrassed circumstances to commit wrongs of the worst kind, and to uphold them by imposture and falsehood.</p>\n<p id=\"b355-6\">But there is nothing in the act of 1848 which makes such consequences at all necessary. To bring the property of a married woman under its protection, it is made necessary by the letter, as well as the spirit of the statute, to prove that she <em>owns </em>it.' She must identify it as property which was hers before marriage, or show how she came by it afterwards. Evidence that she purchased it amounts to nothing unless it be accompanied by clear and full proof that she paid for it with her own separate funds. In the absence of such proof, the presumption is a violent one that her husband furnished the means of payment. This was the rule laid down in Gamber <em>v. </em>Gamber (6 <em>Harris </em>363), and must be rigidly \u00e1dhered to. It applies to purchases of real estate as well as personal. No agreement of the husband and wife about the property of either, whether it be made in writing or by parol, can avail against creditors without proof which will render the fact indubitable that it was hers independent of all agreements between themselves. An arrangement to buy property on her credit, and have it managed and paid for by him as her agent, is too unsubstantial and too easily shammed to be at all satisfactory. All these things can be done by mere words, and words are but breath.</p>\n<p id=\"b355-7\">The hogs in question here were purchased and paid for by the husband himself. It is said he paid for them as his wife\u2019s agent out of the profits of her distillery. But what was the evidence of her title to that ? It was nominally conveyed to her, and she handed the first fifty dollars over to the grantor. There was no spark of evidence that the money she paid was her own: her counsel have not asked us to believe that these were the same fifty dollars which she had received four years before from her father\u2019s administrator. All the subsequent payments were met by the husband. Prom these facts we can make but one inference, and that is that Good paid for the land himself. It was therefore his to all intents and purposes, and all it produced was his. An agreement with his wife to manage his own property as her servant, and to account to her for the profits, will of course not protect it against his creditors.-</p>\n<p id=\"b356-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"356\">*356</page-number>We are unanimously and clearly of opinion that the defendants had a right to the instructions they prayed for. They were as well entitled to a verdict as if the plaintiff had given no evidence at all.</p>\n<p id=\"b356-6\">The suit should have been brought in the name of the husband and wife, to the use of the wife. The form of the action was not objected to, and is no reason for reversing the judgment. I mention it merely to show that it has not our approbation.</p>\n<p id=\"b356-7\">Judgment reversed and <em>ven. fa. de nov. </em>awarded.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
