The widow and children of a decedent, dying within this Commonwealth, have no right, by the fifth section of the Act of 26th April, 1850, to claim any portion of the proceeds of sale of real estate sold by order of Orphans\u2019 Court for the payment of debts where no election to retain either real or personal estate was made before the sale.</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"2\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b243-12\">2. The Act of 1850 allowing the widow or children of a decedent to retain either real orpersonal property belonging to his estate to the value of $300 is not to be construed to impair the lien of judgments against the decedent existing before its enactment, or to give to the widow the right to $300 worth of property as against such j'udgments existing at its passage: The Act of 1850 is not <em>retroactive, </em>and is to be construed in connection with the Act of 9th April, 1849.</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"3\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b244-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"244\">*244</page-number>3. A statute should not be held to operate retroactively unless its language admits of no other construction; and there is nothing in the Act of 1850, either by itself or in connection with the Act of 1849, evincing any intention to impair the value of liens existing before its enactment.</headnotes>\n<summary data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b244-6\">Appeal by Mary Neff, widow of Henry Neff, deceased, from <em>the </em>decree of the Orphans\u2019 Court of <em>York county, </em>decreeing distribution of the proceeds of sale of the <em>real </em>estate of the said deceased, which had been sold under an order of the Orphans\u2019 Court for the payment of debts. The time of the death of Neff was not stated on the paper-books; it was stated that he died <em>after </em>26th April, 1850, insolvent, leaving a widow and children residing with him at his death. The inventory of his personal property amounted to $95.50, which the widow retained; she further claimed $204.50 out of the proceeds of sale of real estate sold as aforesaid.

The <em>lien </em>is but collateral to the debt, and is one of the remedies for enforcing its payment: 5 <em>Barr </em>145; 4 <em>W. &amp; Ser. </em>218; 1 <em>Howard, </em>319-20.</p>\n<p data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b245-9\">By the Act of 1850 it is made the duty of the administrator to have the property appraised, and his omission to have this done should not prejudice the widow and children. They were not notified of the application to sell: 6 <em>Barr </em>91. By the Act of 1849, the sheriff is to have the appraisement made <em>if requested by the debtor ; </em>by the Act of 1850 it is made the duty of the administrator to have it made.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b245-10\"><em>Potts, </em>for appellees.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AGxG\">\u2014 The constitutional provision, violated by the construction contended for on part- of appellants, is the provision prohibiting the impairing <em>of contracts. </em>The statutes forbidding imprisonment for debt, are not unconstitutional, as they discharged only the person of the debtor, but left the obligation to pay in full force: 4 <em>Wheaton </em>122, Sturges <em>v. </em>Crowninshield; 1 <em>Howard </em>316-19. But \u201cif the defendant had made such an <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"246\">*246</page-number>agreement as to authorize a sale of his property, which should he levied on hy the sheriff for such a price as should be bid for it at a public sale, on reasonable notice, it would have conferred a right on the plaintiff, which the constitution made inviolate; and it can make no difference whether such right is conferred by the terms or law of the contract:\u201d 2 <em>Howard </em>613, McCracken <em>v. </em>Hayward. <em>If </em>the Act of 1850 disturbs vested rights, it is unconstitutional: 1 <em>Kent </em>455. In Deichman\u2019s Appeal, 2 <em>Wharton </em>397, the assets were <em>personal, </em>and the judgment was no lien on them when it began to operate.</p>\n<p data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b246-6\">It was further said that the claim should have been made <em>before the sale. </em>Until the election is made, it was said the administrator does not know what property to have appraised: Miller\u2019s Appeal, 4 <em>Harris </em>300; Hammer <em>v. </em>Freese, 7 <em>Harris </em>255. A retrospective statute, affecting vested rights, is void: 1 <em>Kent </em>454-5. A retrospective effect will not be given to a statute, so as to affect contracts or property: 5 <em>W. &amp; Ser. </em>198; <em>Dwarris on Statutes </em>681; 2 <em>Barr </em>23. There is no word or phrase in the Act of 1850 indicating a design to make it retroactive, while the word \u201c <em>hereafter\u201d </em>looks only to the future.</p>\n<decisiondate data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"decisiondate\" id=\"A8v\">May 19, 1853,</decisiondate>\n<opinion data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<p id=\"b246-7\">The opinion of the Court was delivered, by</p>\n<author id=\"b246-8\">Lewis, J.</author>\n<p id=\"ATi\">\u2014 Can the widow and children of an insolvent debtor claim any portion of the proceeds of his real estate sold under an order of the Orphans\u2019 Court for the payment of debts, where no election to retain either real or personal estate was made before the sale ? The most universal and effectual way of discovering the true meaning of a law when the words are dubious, is by considering the reason and spirit of it, or the cause which moved, the legislature to enact it: 1 <em>Bl. Com. </em>61. The words of the Act of 1850 are not dubious in this particular. But if they were so, this horn-book principle would enable us to arrive at their meaning without difficulty. Except where the real estate cannot be divided and set off to the debtor, the legislature have in no instance directed its proceeds to be left with him instead of the property itself. In common honesty the acquisitions of the debtor belong to the creditor. But the demands of necessity and humanity are sometimes so imperative as to overbear questions of <em>meum </em>and <em>tuum. </em>The laws which exempt from execution articles necessary <em>for the enjoyment </em>of life, like those which oblige communities to provide for persons who are unable to provide for themselves, rest upon this foundation. The law of our being, the nature of our climate, and our habits of life, render certain articles so indispensable to existence as intelligent beings, that the legislature have exempted them from execution, disregarding the claims of severe and exacting justice, in obedience to the higher obligations of humanity and necessity. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"247\">*247</page-number>This was done, not in order that the debtor might make merchandise of them, and expend the proceeds for the gratification of desires which had no claim upon the humanity or the sympathies of the public; but in order that the articles thus exempt from execution might be \u201cretained\u201d and \u201cremain for the use of the debtor and his family.\u201d It was not an absolute gift, but a <em>trust </em>for a particular purpose; and every attempt to convert this benevolent provision for the comfort of the debtor and his family into a claim for money, which may be expended without promoting that object, should be discountenanced as a perversion of the statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b247-6\">The object of the legislature was to prevent the sale of the property ; and every act or omission of the debtor or his widow and children, which amounts to an acquiescence in, or an affirmance of the sale, is in direct contravention of that object. The Act of 1850 was intended to give to the widow and children of the debtor the privileges which the debtor himself enjoyed in his lifetime, under the Act of 1849. Both statutes have relation to the same subject, and differ only in designating the individuals intended to be protected. We may therefore apply the established rule of construction, \u201cthat statutes in <em>pari materid, </em>or upon the same subject, must be construed with reference to each other; that is, that what is clear in one statute, shall be called in aid to explain what is obscure and ambiguous in another:\u201d 1 <em>Bl. Com. </em>60, <em>note </em>8. Under the Act of 1850, the family of the decedent may retain, at their election, either real or personal estate, of the value of $300 ; and it is the duty of the executor to have it appraised. But we do not see how this can be done under the Act of 1850, any more than under that of 1849, until the election of one or the other be made, and the property chosen be designated by the persons entitled to retain it. If any doubt should exist on so plain a question, the provisions of the Act of 1849 must be considered in connection with the Act of 1850. Under this view of the subject, the case before us was virtually decided in Weaver\u2019s Appeal, 6 <em>Harris </em>309. It was there held by this Court, in giving a construction to the latter statute, that no proceedings to appraise the property can be instituted, until the debtor signifies his election; and that his omission to do so at the proper time, was a waiver of all the advantages of the Act.</p>\n<p id=\"b247-7\">But there is another objection to the claim of the appellant. No statute is held to operate retroactively, unless its language admits of no other construction. There is nothing whatever in the Act of 1850, whether construed by itself, or in connection with the Act of 1849, which indicates the slightest intention to impair the value of liens which existed before its enactment.</p>\n<p id=\"b247-8\">These views of the case render it unnecessary to consider the constitutional question discussed in the paper-book.</p>\n<p id=\"b247-9\">The decree of the Court below is affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
