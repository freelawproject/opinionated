By marriage articles between James Wilson, her intended husband, and the guardians of Eliza Ege, then a minor, dated 21st July, 1817, Wilson covenanted to settle upon her, after her becoming of legal age, the one-half of her personal and real estate, for her use during life, with remainder to her offspring.

The marriage articles were not then on record; they were not recorded till 22d July, 1823.

The plaintiff demurred generally, and a joinder in demurrer was had. The plea of payment was also put in. The Court rendered a judgment on the demurrer <em>for </em>Eliza Wilson; upon which the plea of payment was withdrawn, and verdict was rendered against <em>James </em>Wilson, the husband, for $8649.31. A writ of error was sued out, and it was assigned for error, 1. The Court erred in receiving the plea of Eliza Wilson; \u2022 2. In giving judgment for the defendant instead of plaintiff. On 13th October, 1832, the judgment was <em>reversed </em>and judgment entered for the plaintiff.

This was to show that the <em>sei. fa. </em>to January Term, 1828, No. 40, was issued upon the mortgage in question.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b438-10\">, The plaintiffs offered to show that upon the faith of the record, judgments, and proceedings thereon, the lands in dispute had passed by conveyances to 48 purchasers who were then in possession, though not parties to the suit. This was rejected.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"21\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b438-11\">On part of the plaintiffs, John Foster, Esq., former cashier of the Harrisburg Bank, was examined to show that the marriage articles were known to the bank at the time of the taking of the mortgage of Wilson and wife; and he stated that the existence of the articles was known <em>to all the' directors. </em>Nothing of it, however, existed on the minutes of the bank.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"22\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b438-12\">A number of points were proposed on the part of the defendants.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"23\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b438-13\">Graham, J., observed to the jury, that the plaintiffs allege that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"439\">*439</page-number>there was nothing connecting the judgment in the Common Pleas with the mortgage in the recorder\u2019s office, and consequently that the title of Mrs. Wilson was not divested by the sheriff\u2019s sale. That if the former decision of this case was understood by him, the <em>lev. facias </em>on the mortgage was not only irregular, but void, and therefore the sale did not divest the title of Mrs. Wilson; and he instructed the jury that the verdict should be for the plaintiffs. This instruction was the principal matter assigned for error.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"24\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b439-6\"><em>Biddle </em>and Watts, with whom was <em>Miller, </em>for plaintiffs in error.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"25\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"A9CB\">\u2014It was contended that the marriage articles were invalid for want of proper parties. Eliza Ege was no party to them; 1 <em>Southard </em>84; 2 <em>U. S.

That if not binding on <em>her </em>part, they were not binding on <em>James Wilson.</em></p>\n<p data-order=\"26\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b439-7\">It was said on the part of the plaintiffs, that there was <em>notice </em>to the Harrisburg Bank of the marriage articles; but if the bank had notice, there was none to subsequent purchasers: 9 <em>Barr </em>399; 1 <em>Washington </em>4; 2 <em>Bin. </em>40; 8 <em>Ser. &amp; R. </em>496; 2 <em>Rawle </em>215; also <em>the Recording Act of </em>1755, sec. 1.</p>\n<p data-order=\"27\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b439-8\">It has been decided by this Court, that the mortgage executed by Wilson and wife <em>is valid-, </em>also cited 4 <em>Pa.

The <em>scire facias </em>was waived. By the plea put in the want of a <em>set. fa. </em>was supplied, and <em>by </em>it the record could be amended. The Supreme Court entered judgment on the demurrer for the plaintiff. Such a judgment should not he reversed <em>collaterally </em>: 4 <em>Rawle </em>401; 6 <em>Watts </em>410; 10 <em>Id. </em>101. There was but one mortgage on record between Wilson and wife and the Harrisburg Bank. The lands were described in the <em>levari </em>and <em>alias lev. facias: </em>2 <em>Jones </em>217; 10 <em>Barr </em>495-6; 4 <em>Watts </em>424; 1 <em>Rawle </em>225.</p>\n<p data-order=\"29\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b439-10\">The purchaser is protected by the 9th sect, of the Act of 1705, in case of the reversal of the judgment: also 4 <em>Watts </em>286, Tainter <em>v. </em>Warder; 6 <em>Watts </em>295.</p>\n<p data-order=\"30\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b439-11\">As to acquiescence of Wilson and wife. 1 <em>Rawle </em>162; 1 <em>Com.

Wilson covenanted in consideration of marriage, that the guardian of his intended wife should have a conveyance; and in violation of it he procured his wife to join him in a mortgage of land included in the settlement. It was contended that such a mortgage to one <em>having notice </em>of the settlement did not' affect the equity of the wife: 2 <em>Roper </em>27; <em>Atherly </em>49; <em>McQueen </em>252; 1 <em>Bro. C. C. </em>117; 18 <em>Ves. </em>275; 2 <em>Leigh </em>76.</p>\n<p data-order=\"35\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b440-6\">Eliza Ege was a witness to the marriage articles. Signing as a witness <em>with a knowledge of the contents </em>of the instrument is sufficient to bind a party: 1 <em>Wilson </em>118\u201419; 8 <em>Atkins </em>503; 1 <em>Ves. Sen. </em>8; 9 <em>Ves. Jr. </em>234.</p>\n<p data-order=\"36\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b440-7\">It was said that the marriage settlement was a valid settlement, and bound one-half of the real estate. That it was effectual against the Harrisburg Bank, which it was said had <em>actual notice </em>of the articles. The articles were recorded on 22d July, 1823. The assignment to Jacob Albert is dated 18th July, 1833, nearly ten years afterwards. It was said that a recording under the Registry Act was notice to all who take an interest in the property <em>after the date of the recording.</em></p>\n<p data-order=\"37\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b440-8\">It was said that the judgment against Mrs. Wilson was void for want of jurisdiction. That the land was not <em>described </em>in the record of the suit. The authority of the Court to act upon the particular subject should appear <em>by the </em>record; any writ of execution issued must be authorized by the record, and in proceedings <em>in rem </em>the judgment of the Court is required to be concerning the specific land.</p>\n<p data-order=\"38\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b440-9\">Mrs. AVilson as a <em>feme covert </em>could not waive the <em>scire facias. </em>She could waive nothing except in the way provided by law: 7 <em>Watts </em>228. It was contended that she could not appoint an attorney except to dispose of her lands, and it must be <em>duly acknowledged: </em>3 <em>Taunton </em>361. But the writing did not refer to any particular land. As to the <em>plea, </em>it was submitted whether there was anything in it which showed what lands were the subject-matter of the suit.</p>\n<p data-order=\"39\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b440-10\">It was further said, that <em>the record </em>not showing what land was the subject of the proceeding, the judgment of the Supreme Court did not cure the defect. The judgment was for <em>no sum: </em>16 <em>Ser. &amp; R. </em>348. The revival of it made it no better, as Mrs. Wilson <em>was a feme covert: </em>3 <em>Wharton </em>313; Dorrance <em>v. </em>Scott, 2 <em>Campb. </em>272; 2 <em>P. Wms. </em>144; 6 <em>Harris </em>79, Caldwell <em>v. </em>Walters.</p>\n<p data-order=\"40\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b440-11\">As to <em>the writs. </em>The prothonotary had no proper data foi describing the premises in the writ of <em>levari facias. </em>Ho application was made <em>to amend the record. </em>There was no judgment of the Court to warrant an execution describing the premises.</p>\n<p data-order=\"41\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b440-12\">A <em>void </em>judgment will not warrant an execution, and a sale under <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"441\">*441</page-number>it confers no title; Caldwell <em>v. </em>Walters, before cited. Such deficiency as existed in this record could not be supplied by parol proof: 10 <em>Watts </em>23.</p>\n<p data-order=\"42\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b441-6\">The agreements with Albert were invalid as to Mrs. Wilson by reason of her coverture: 6 <em>Wend. </em>13; 16 <em>Johns. </em>114; 17 <em>Id. </em>167; 6 <em>Barr </em>414; 2 <em>Jones </em>274; 12 <em>Ser. &amp; R. </em>403.</p>\n<decisiondate data-order=\"43\" data-type=\"decisiondate\" id=\"AOa\">September 6,</decisiondate>\n<opinion data-order=\"44\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<p id=\"b441-7\">The opinion of the Court, filed was delivered by</p>\n<author id=\"b441-8\">Lowrie, J.</author>\n<p id=\"ANR\">\u2014 This cause was before us last year, when all the points then raised were decided. We have now heard the same points again discussed, and, in relation to them, it is sufficient to say that we perceive no error in the conclusions to which we were led. by the former argument. To our minds it is clear that the mortgage in question and the proceedings under it, have not at all affected the title to the half of this land that was included in the marriage settlement, and this the plaintiffs below have properly recovered. They insist moreover that, because the judgment was void under which the other half- was sold, therefore they are entitled to that also. The judgment is certainly void for the reasons assigned here on the former argument.</p>\n<p id=\"b441-9\">Now, however, the defendants below allege and show that this property was the very property mortgaged by Wilson and his wife, and was in fact the subject-matter of the suit and judgment; that it was fully described in the writs of <em>lev. fa. </em>issued upon the judgment ; and that, after those writs were issued, the defendants in that suit, the ancestors of the present plaintiffs below, in order to obtain indulgence, procured Jacob Albert to buy the judgment and stay the proceedings; and they insist that, by reason of those facts, Wilson and his wife are both estopped from denying that the judgment sustained the <em>lev. fa., </em>and was good against the land described in it. This is the question of the cause, and we proceed to consider it.</p>\n<p id=\"b441-10\">We have lately decided, in Evans <em>v. </em>Mylert, that where a suit is brought against husband and wife on a mortgage of the wife\u2019s land, the husband may employ counsel to appear and confess judgment for both. In this case there was an appearance and judgment thus obtained; and Mrs. Wilson was thus made a party to the proceeding for all its legitimate purposes, up to its final termination. She could have been made a, party to a correction of the error in the-record, and she would - have been had it been discovered. As matter of fact, her rights under this mortgage were litigated and decided; but by reason of an omission, this does not appear as matter of record. As matter of record, therefore, there was no judgment, while as matter of fact one had been confessed, and could have been made perfect on the record by an amendment or correction. Have the defendants in that proceeding so acted that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"442\">*442</page-number>equity requires us to consider that as done which ought to have been done ? They did so when they procured a friend to buy the judgment for their benefit, as a good one: and we do no more than enforce the agreement of the parties, and prevent them from repudiating a transaction from which they have derived the stipulated advantage, when we refuse, under such circumstances, to hear their objection to the validity of the judgment. We must presume that if this question had been raised when a <em>lev. fa. </em>was issued by Albert, the Court would have found means <em>to </em>correct their judgement so as to be a good foundation for the writ. Where a judgment is not incurably defective, a plaintiff may preclude himself from taking advantage of its defects, by getting another to buy it for his benefit.</p>\n<p id=\"b442-6\">May a married woman thus bind herself by acting with her husband ? Why not ? The fact that she can be sued with her husband, entitles her, with him, to do all proper acts relative to the defence of her rights that are involved in the suit. It was proper for her interests that she and her husband should make an arrangement for time, in order to prevent a sacrifice of her property. Both are therefore bound to all the consequences of the arrangement. True, she did not bind herself by a separate acknowledgment, but that form of proceeding does not apply to such an act. True, also, a door is here open through which the wife may be imposed upon by her <em>husband; </em>but we find it open and would not shut it, for it is opened by the very confidence that ought to exist between husband and wife; and confidence will hold it open so long as pure affection is allowed to be a legitimate element of the marriage relation. In this relation we find the highest, and noblest, and purest, and therefore the most civilizing illustration of the confidence of human beings in each other; and such can never be reposed without the risk of imposition. Let it remain, for the good it does, and notwithstanding its dangers. When the law invades the sacred confidence of the marriage relation in order to save the wife from the faults or misfortunes of <em>the </em>husband, it, in some measure, loosens the bond whose principal virtue consists in its closeness.</p>\n<p id=\"b442-7\">We are of opinion that the defendants below made good their defence to one-half of this land. The other exceptions of the plaintiffs in error are not sustained.</p>\n<p id=\"b442-8\">Judgment reversed and new trial awarded.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
