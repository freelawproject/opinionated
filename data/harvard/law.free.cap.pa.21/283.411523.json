He observed that some of the children had received what are advancements. The amount received by <em>Rebecca </em>V. R. Fry differs as respects the mode in which it is charged from the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"286\">*286</page-number>amounts received by tbe others, the entry usually made as respected portions of the estate furnished to other heirs, and indicating an advancement, having been omitted in <em>her </em>case.

Extrinsic evidence of his intention is often to be resorted to. It was said that the father in this case contemplated dying intestate. It was contended that all he had entered in the family book as to his children, were intended by him as advancements. The bonds are entered in the family book in which the other entries are made. It was contended that the object of the father was one which was to operate after his death. The entry as to the bond of Charles, was a declaration that he did not intend to collect the debt himself. That all the acts, conduct, and writings of the intestate, at any time relating to the bonds in controversy, are evidence for the consideration of the Court. In relation to the matter of advancements, reference was made to 1 <em>Ser. &amp; R. </em>312; 4 <em>Ser. &amp; R. </em>329; 4 <em>Wharton </em>523; 5 <em>Watts </em>83; 6 <em>Watts </em>87; <em>Id. </em>257; 10 <em>Id. </em>56; 6 <em>Id. </em>171; 5 <em>W. &amp; Ser. </em>400; 6 <em>Barr </em>13; 2 <em>Pick. </em>340; 4 <em>Id. </em>24; 16 <em>Verm. </em>197; 4 <em>Wliar. </em>138. Whatever may be the nature of the original transaction between the father and son, it may be converted by the former into an advancement.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"41\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b286-7\"><em>Strong, </em>for appellee.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"42\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"A5s\">\u2014 An advancement is an <em>irrevocable gift by </em>a parent in his lifetime to his child, on account of such child\u2019s share of his estate after the parent\u2019s decease: 6 <em>Watts </em>87, Hengst\u2019s Estate; 1 <em>Harris </em>580, Yundts\u2019 Appeal. Intention to give is not sufficient; it must be consummated by action \u2014 and it was said that neither existed in this case. By taking the bonds, the father became creditor. The bonds were retained by him uncancelled at his death, and the burden of showing that the bonds were released lay upon the appellant. It was contended, from the entries on the bonds, and the inventory of property on the loose slip of paper, and in the family register, that the deceased did not intend that the bonds of Charles and Ezra should be considered at his <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"287\">*287</page-number>death as <em>advancements. </em>That though he did not intend to collect the bonds, that was not important; the material question was, whether he put it out of his power to do so. It was contended that the entries on the loose piece of paper were memorandums of his property, and not intended by him to operate as a release or as a conversion of the bonds into advancements. It did not show any delivery by him of the bonds, nor anything equivalent to a release of them: 1 <em>W. &amp; Ser. </em>394; 4 <em>Whar. </em>130; 1 <em>Harris </em>581.</p>\n<decisiondate data-order=\"43\" data-type=\"decisiondate\" id=\"AdNf\">June 21,1853,</decisiondate>\n<opinion data-order=\"44\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<p id=\"b287-6\">The opinion of the Court was delivered, by</p>\n<author id=\"b287-7\">Lewis, J.</author>\n<p id=\"Ads\">\u2014 An advancement is an irrevocable gift by a parent in his lifetime, to a child, on account of such child\u2019s share of the parent\u2019s estate. Where a father, on advancing a sum of money to a son, takes a bond for its repayment, with or without interest, it is a debt, and not an advancement. Where a father thus takes a bond for money loaned, but takes none for money paid for farming utensils for his son when he commenced farming, the presumption that the money secured by the bond is a debt, acquires additional strength. And where the father deliberately enters in a book called a \u201c family register\u201d both charges against the son, expressly directing that the money paid for farming utensils shall bear no interest, but remain charged until after his death, and then be deducted out of his son\u2019s share of the estate; but makes no such entry in respect to the debt secured by bond, the indications of his purpose are too clear for doubt.</p>\n<p id=\"b287-8\">A brief statement of the nature and amount of his estate (including under the term \u201cadvance\u201d the total amount of the debts against, and advancements to, his children), made on a small loose slip of paper found among his papers after his death, does not amount to a release of his bonds against his children, or convert them into advancements. The word <em>\u201c advanced\u201d </em>may mean a <em>\u201cgiving </em>beforehand without expectation of recompenseor, \u201c the furnishing of money or goods in expectation of reimbursement.\u201d It may have been appropriately used by General High to include all the advances made to his children, whether as <em>donations </em>or <em>loans. </em>It may have been properly used as <em>describing the existing </em>state of his affairs, and not as a word which <em>worked a change in them. </em>It must be understood in the first sense, because the paper itself is neither a deed, nor any other instrument by which a man passes his interest to another; but merely a schedule of his estate as it existed at the time. The object evidently was, merely to bring before his mind the existing condition and amount of his property, for the purpose of forming a proper judgment respecting the future disposition of it. The loose slips of paper on which a man makes calculations and estimates of his property, ought not to be converted into releases of debts justly due to him. They should not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"288\">*288</page-number>be used for this purpose, even if they bear indications of an intention to give or release them. An intention to give may be changed for good reasons, before it is carried out; and therefore should not be tortured by the courts into a present donation.</p>\n<p id=\"b288-6\">The decree of the Court below is affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
