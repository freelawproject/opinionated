All and every part of that will shall be considered as found in'this case as if here incorporated.

I give and bequeath to my grandson, Thomas Urie Culbertson, my gold watch, when he arrives at lawful age, and also I bequeath to him the stock which I hold in the Cumberland Yalley Railroad Company and the Harrisburg Bridge Company.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b311-12\">Opinion by Graham, J. \u2014 \u201c After a careful perusal of the whole will, I cannot resist the conclusion that old Mr. Urie, the testator, intended that all his grandchildren should be participants of his <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"312\">*312</page-number>bounty. And they all do participate, unless Ellen Culbertson, the plaintiff, and daughter of testator\u2019s deceased daughter, Catherine, is excluded. The testator makes his grandchildren his residuary legatees, and describes them as the children of his daughters, without designating any of the grandchildren by name.\u201d He quoted the 12th item, and proceeded as follows:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b312-6\">\u201c Mrs. Culbertson had two children: a son named Thomas Urie, and a daughter named Ellen, and the question presented is, whether the bequest by testator to <em>the child </em>of his deceased daughter, Catherine Culbertson, includes the son and excludes the daughter, or whether both were intended by their grandfather as objects of his bounty.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"Ai78\">\u201c A bequest to <em>the </em>child of a deceased daughter, when there were two children, would be not only ambiguous and uncertain, but unintelligible and void for uncertainty. It, therefore, becomes necessary to' resort to the rules of construction applicable to cases of this kind, and by a reference to adjudicated cases the question presented is easily solved.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b312-8\">\u201c In 2 <em>Jarman on Wills, </em>108, the rule is thus stated: <em>\u2018 </em>It often happens that a gift to children describes them as consisting of a specified number, which is less than the number found to exist at the date of the will. In such cases it is highly probable that the testator has mistaken the actual number of the children, and that his real intention is that all the children, whatever may be their number, shall be included. Such, accordingly, is the established construction, the numerical restriction being wholly disregarded.\u2019 Thus in Tompkins <em>v. </em>Tompkins, 2 <em>Vesey, Sr. </em>564, where a testator, after bequeathing twenty pounds to his sister, gave to her <em>three </em>children fifty pounds each, and the legatee had <em>four, </em>Lord Hardwicke held that they were all entitled. (See also the different cases in same book, pages 108-9.)</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b312-9\">\u201c In <em>Powell on Devises, </em>327, it is said, \u00a3 That a gift to children, 'as consisting of a definite number, is not invariably confined within that numerical limit; but has, in many instances, where the actual number of children existing at the making of the will has exceeded the number described, been extended to the whole.\u2019 (See also cases cited in same book, pages 327-8.)</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b312-10\">\u00a3\u00a3 In accordance with the foregoing rules of construction was the case of Yernor\u2019s Ex\u2019rs <em>v. </em>Fisher <em>et al., </em>reported in <em>Brightly\u2019s Reps. </em>412, decided in the District Court of Lancaster, and after-wards affirmed by the Supreme Court of this state. In that case testator devised two-thirds of a plantation to the <em>two </em>daughters of his deceased brother, and there were <em>three </em>daughters. Held, that the devise extended to all the daughters.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b312-11\">\u201c The cases cited would rule the present case, if the question depended alone on the 12th item of the will. But defendants\u2019 counsel contend that the 8th item removes the ambiguity of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"313\">*313</page-number>12th item, and designates the son to the exclusion of the daughter, as the person intended by the term child in the 12th item. The 8th item is as follows: \u2018 I bequeath to Thomas Urie Culbertson, the son of my deceased daughter Catherine, the sum of $500, in addition to his share of the residue of my estate as hereinafter given.\u2019</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b313-6\">\u201c The argument is, that as Thomas, the son, is here designated as a residuary legatee, and as the term child in the 12th item \u25a0 is singular, and cannot include Thomas and his sister Ellen, it must necessarily mean Thomas, who had been named in a preceding item as an intended residuary legatee.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b313-7\">\u201c I cannot concur in the views of defendants\u2019 counsel, in assigning the office of elucidating the 12th item to the 8th.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b313-8\">\u201c I think the testator intended nothing more by the 8th item than to give his namesake, Thomas Urie Culbertson, five hundred dollars more than the other residuary legatees, and he has declared this intention in plain and concise language. But Thomas still remains a residuary legatee, although his sister Ellen is included in the residuary clause; so that this construction fully meets the intention expressed in the 8th item of making Thomas a residuary legatee.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"21\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b313-9\">\u201c But does not the 8th item fortify plaintiff\u2019s claim as a residuary legatee ? It shows testator knew his daughter Catherine had a son named Thomas Urie Culbertson, and in that item he is named in full. But in the 12th item the residuary legacy is given to the <em>child </em>of his deceased daughter Catherine. If he knew his daughter Catherine had also a daughter, it is very improbable that testator would designate the son to the exclusion of the daughter by the word child, which is equally applicable to either, and particularly when in the next item (the \u00cd3th) he again designates his grandson by name, in giving to him a gold watch, &amp;e. Had testator intended that Thomas alone, to the exclusion of his sister, should participate in thb residuum of his estate, he would have designated him by name, as he did in the preceding and subsequent items, and not used the ambiguous term child, which is as applicable to a daughter as a son. He would have called him his grandson, Thomas Urie Culbertson (for it appears the old gentleman loved to designate his namesake by his name in full), or the son of his deceased daughter Catherine.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"22\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b313-10\">\u201c When testator commences the 12th item with the declaration that as to all the rest and residue of his estate, real and personal, after the payment of Ms debts, &amp;c., he gives the same to be divided equally \u2018 per capita,\u2019 between his grandchildren, and then designates all his grandchildren, except that in thus designating them he says, \u2018the child of my deceased daughter Catherine,\u2019 he must have supposed that Catherine had but one child, or intended <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"314\">*314</page-number>children; for no man who understood the English language would think of designating one of two, children to the exclusion of the other, by the word <em>child.</em></summary>\n<summary data-order=\"23\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b314-6\">\u201c This hypothesis is strengthened by the latter clause of the 12th item, in which he directs the mode in which the children of his daughter, Eleanor Law, are to be equalized, in the language of testator, \u2018 with the bequests with my <em>other </em>grandchildren,\u2019 showing evidently that testator supposed he had provided for all his grandchildren.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"24\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b314-7\">\u201c Again, (and we must look at the whole will in giving a construction to any part of it,) in the 9th item, the benevolence of old Mr. Urie, and his kind regard for his relations is evinced by giving a legacy of two hundred and fifty dollars to his sister, Catherine Jacobs, not because she needed it, but in the language of testator, \u2018 as a token of my affectionate remembrance.\u2019 This, it is true, would be entitled to no consideration in a case where the language of the will was plain and unambiguous; but in the present case it has upon my mind a tendency to show that the testator would not pass by his granddaughter, Eleanor Culbertson, when all his other grandchildren were liberally provided for, without some token of his affectionate remembrance. If her existence was obliterated from his remembrance at the time he made his will, by the imbecility of extreme old age or other causes, then the law kindly relieves against the omissions occasioned by the defects of recollection, and under the term child, as used in this will, places the plaintiff in the same position of testator\u2019s other grandchildren as one of the legatees under his will.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"25\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b314-8\">\u201c If the testator, at the time he made his will, knew and recollected that his deceased daughter, Catherine, left two children surviving her, and did not use the word <em>child </em>for <em>children, </em>for upon this position the defence must rest, then we have the singular and to my mind most unsatisfactory hypothesis, that a man of the intelligence of old Mr. Urie, with a full knowledge that his daughter Catherine had left two children, a son and a daughter, in his last will would use the word <em>child </em>to designate the son as the object of his bounty, and to exclude the daughter from any portion of his large estate,</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"26\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b314-9\">\u201c For the reasons stated, I consider Ellen Culbertson, now Irvine, entitled to recover as a residuary legatee under the will of the testator, and direct judgment to be entered for plaintiffs for three thousand dollars.\u201d</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"27\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b314-10\"><em>Watts, </em>with whom was <em>P aricar, </em>for plaintiffs in error.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"28\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"Amh\">\u2014 It was contended that it was only where there was an ambiguity in the language of the will applicable to the facts pertaining to it, that the rules of interpretation will construe a specific number of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"315\">*315</page-number>children or grandchildren with a greater or lesser number; and this is predicated on a mistake of the testator as to the facts. Here it does not appear that the testator was ignorant that his daughter, Catherine, had left <em>two </em>children, a son and a daughter. It was said that in this case ther\u00e9 was no ambiguity in the will itself, as the testator names his grandson as the object of his bounty. In the <em>eighth </em>clause of his will he bequeaths to him <em>by </em>name, $500, \u201c <em>in addition to his share of the residue of my estate as hereinafter given;\u201d </em>and in the thirteenth clause he names him again. It was \u25a0 further said, that there was no <em>equality </em>amongst any one family of his grandchildren. The testator had <em>five </em>daughters, for whose children he provided specifically <em>per capita, </em>but not equally.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"29\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b315-6\"><em>Hepburn, </em>for defendants in error.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"30\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AEo\">\u2014 It was said there- was no mistake as to the <em>eighth </em>and <em>thirteenth </em>items of the will; and it was said that if the testator meant no more in the <em>twelfth </em>clause than he had meant in the <em>eighth </em>and <em>thirteenth, </em>it was strange that he would use the word <em>child </em>when disposing of the larger portion of his estate, instead of distinctly indicating <em>the son. </em>It was contended that he had mistaken the number of his daughter\u2019s children; that his object was to give to his grandchildren, <em>as a class, </em>the residue of his large estate; and that according to a rule of construction, all of that class should take; that their taking will not be prevented by a mere numerical mistake: 2 <em>Jarman </em>108; also <em>the other </em>cases cited by <em>the </em>Court in this case; and also 1 <em>Cox 79; </em>2 <em>Br.
