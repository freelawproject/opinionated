His mother, the widow of George Beard, sen., survived till September, 1850. Mary Webb, the appellant, was the -sister of George Beard, jun., and the widow of James B. Webb, who died in June, 1838. The question was, whether the instrument executed April 1, 1828, between William Barber and James B. Webb, conveyed to the said Barber the said Mar-y\u2019s share of said dower fund. The auditor awarded to Mary Webb her share, but on exceptions the Court decided otherwise, and awarded her share to the executors of William Barber, deceased.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b248-9\">The proceedings in partition of the estate of George Beard, senior, from which the fund for distribution accrued, were consummated before the death of George Beard, <em>junior, </em>which occurred, as before stated, in 1817. Mary, his sister, the appellant, was intermarried with James B. Webb in 1820 or 1821.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b248-10\">The paper executed by James B. Webb was an agreement signed by W. Barber and Webb, dated 1st April, 1828, in which it was recited that Webb was entitled, in right of his wife Mary, to one-eighth part of one-third of the amount of the real estate of her father, which remains a lien upon said .real estate, for the benefit of the widow of said George Beard during her life; and also in the same right to one-seventh part of the share of her brother, George Beard, jun., deceased, of the dower fund aforesaid, the whole amounting to $4576.87, payable at the death of the widow. And in consideration of indebtedness by Webb to Barber, and of the endorsement by the latter of Webb\u2019s note in the York Bank, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"249\">*249</page-number>Webb assigned and transferred to Barber all his right and interest in right of his wife, in the said sum of money.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b249-6\">Barber\u2019s estate was sufficient to pay its debts, including the endorsement. The share of Mary Webb was not sufficient to pay the amount due by Webb\u2019s estate to Barber\u2019s estate.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b249-7\">Exception was filed to the decree awarding the money to Barber\u2019s executors.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b249-8\">Chapin, for appellant.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AKn\">\u2014 It was contended that the agreement or transfer became void, as against the surviving wife, on the death of Webb, her husband, during the life of the widow, for whose benefit the fund was, during that period, suspended; that a husband cannot, by any act of his alone, bar the wife\u2019s survivorship in her reversionary choses in action, expectant on the death of a tenant for life: Hornsby <em>v. </em>Lee, 2 <em>Mad. </em>16; 1 <em>Russ. </em>1, Purden <em>v. </em>Jackson; 3 <em>Russ. </em>65, Honner <em>v. </em>Morton; 3 <em>Id. </em>90; <em>Grlaney </em>137-150.</p>\n<p data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b249-9\">- In <em>Grlancy </em>121, the treatment is of choses in action <em>presently reducible </em>into possession, which was not the case in question. The case of Bates <em>v. </em>Dandy, 2 <em>Atkins </em>207, and note to 3 <em>Russ. </em>73, was determined on the ground that <em>the husband </em>might have recovered the fund: see <em>Glaney </em>121, and opinion of Lord Eldon, ip 3 <em>Russ. </em>73. In the case of Hartman <em>v. </em>Doudel, 1 <em>Rawle </em>279, the question as to the power of the husband to assign the <em>reversionary </em>interest of the wife was not raised. In this case the husband had not the power to reduce the fund into possession.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b249-10\">Mayer, with whom was Evans, for appellees.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"As3\">\u2014 In the English Chancery it has been settled that nothing but the actual receipt of the money during the coverture will bar the surviving wife <em>: Adams\u2019 Equity </em>142; 1 <em>Coll. </em>553; 11 <em>Simons </em>388; 13 <em>Id. </em>309; 2 <em>Coll. </em>254. But <em>in Pennsylvania </em>a different rule exists: Siter\u2019s Case, 4 <em>Rawle </em>468; 1 <em>Bin. </em>358, Yohe <em>v. </em>Barnet; 2 <em>Ser. &amp; R. </em>491, Lodge v. Hamilton; 1 <em>Rawle </em>279, Hartman <em>v. </em>Doudel; 2 <em>Wash. C. C. Rep. </em>408; 1 <em>Penn.

In that case, as in this, the wife\u2019s chose was reversionary and dependent on a life estate, and the husband was trustee of the tenant for life; yet it was held that his conversion of the fund, in fraud of the <em>cestui que </em>trust, was a reduction of it to possession that gave him the absolute title as against his wife. The principle of decision that runs through all the cases, is that a transfer for value is a reduction to possession, whether as to choses presently reducible, reversionary interests, or bare possibilities. However averse to tMs conclusion some of us might be if the question were an open one, we remember that our office is <em>jus dicere, </em>and not <em>jus dare; </em>and we bow to authorities which we are bound to respect.</p>\n<p id=\"b250-10\">The decree is affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
