A draft of the road was annexed.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b218-9\">The report was confirmed <em>nisi, </em>the road to be of the breadth of 28 feet.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b218-10\">Exceptions were filed in December, 1852: 1. The order calls for the laying out of a new road ending at a corner of lands of Jacob Reno and Esther Miller: the <em>report </em>lays out a road with no such termination; and, in fact, there was no corner of lands of Jacob Reno and Esther Miller, and the viewers have endeavored to correct the point of ending of a road laid out different from both petition and order. 2. The order directs the viewers to vacate a road, and lay out another in lieu thereof between different points, and in an entirely different direction; thus giving to one set of viewers the powers that can only be exercised by two juries. 3. A straight road is vacated \u2014 part of old Newport road laid out sixty years ago; and a change in. the same will be productive of great inconvenience to the public.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b218-11\">An additional exception was afterwards filed, to the effect, that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"219\">*219</page-number>the road reported was recommended to be opened of the width of 28 feet; whereas the old Newport road, part of which was vacated, was 33 feet wide.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b219-6\">In March, 1853, the report was set aside* because the portion of the road laid out did not end where the portion of the old road ashed to be vacated ends.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b219-7\">It was assigned for error, That the Court erred in setting aside the report on the second exception; and that they should have confirmed the report.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b219-8\"><em>Frazer, </em>for petitioners.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AJ8\">\u2014 The court set aside the report on the second exception, because the road laid out, <em>although it commenced at the beginning of the road vacated, </em>did not run <em>to the termination of the road vacated, </em>although it did run into the newly-laid-out road, leading from the old Philadelphia road at a corner of Catherine Yeates\u2019s land, to <em>a stone, </em>a corner of Henry Krider and late Levi Bushong, <em>the termination of the vacated road.</em></p>\n<p data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b219-9\">That is, the Court say, that the viewers must lay out the new road by courses and distances, to the point of termination of the vacated road, and not enter a road already laid out which leads and runs to that very point. That the viewers cannot adopt part of a road already laid out leading to the point of termination, although they may run over that same road, lay it out again, and thus comply with the law.</p>\n<p data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b219-10\">It was contended that it was not necessary to report a road on the bed of a public road already laid out, and leading to the point of termination of the road to be vacated. 8 <em>Barr </em>485 was cited.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b219-11\"><em>FRlmaher, </em>contr\u00e1.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AiE\">\u2014 The case in 2 <em>Bawle </em>421 was cited as deciding that, <em>\u201c </em>though road viewers are restricted to the space between the points specified in the order, yet they inay carry the road to the point designated, partly over the bed of a road already laid out and opened.\u201d But it was said that, in the present case, the viewers do not make <em>a part of their report </em>the road leading from the old Philadelphia road referred to as confirmed at April sessions, 1851; they <em>stopped </em>at the public road, which, it was alleged on the part of petitioners, leads to the point of termination prayed for. It was said, that the viewers should have reported as far as the said point of termination; but that, in fact, they had .not laid out any road for near two-thirds of the distance between the points of the road vacated.</p>\n<decisiondate data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"decisiondate\" id=\"A1D\">May 19, 1853,</decisiondate>\n<opinion data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<p id=\"b219-12\">The opinion of the Court was delivered, by</p>\n<author id=\"b219-13\">Black, C. J.</author>\n<p id=\"AZ6\">\u2014 The petition prayed that an old road might be vacated and a new one laid out to supply it, and so ran the order. The viewers reported in favor of the vacation, and, in lieu of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"220\">*220</page-number>old road, laid out another from the place of beginning, not to the terminus of the old road, but to another point intersecting another road, which did run to the terminus.</p>\n<p id=\"A3t\">If it was more advantageous to the public that the vacated road should be supplied in part by another already laid out, the viewers were right in adopting it. If the best route between the points laid down in the order was along the courses previously chosen for another public road, they were surely not bound to avoid it at the cost of more money to the township, and greater loss to the landowners or less convenience to the people. Neither was it necessary that the viewers should re-survey the road adopted. It could do no possible good, and works of supererogation are not required.</p>\n<p id=\"b220-7\">The order of the Quarter Sessions setting aside the report is reversed, and the report is reinstated.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
