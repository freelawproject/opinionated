It is a sound principle, that contracts are'to be construed and understood according to the clear intent of the parties\u00bb</p>\n<p data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b127-4\">In this case, as it regards the underwriters, the risk ended in Safety before reaching <em>Gottenburgh. </em>What reason can there be why the premium should not be returned in this case, as well as in the case of her safe arrival at that place ? The defendants can show no possible injury from the breaking up of the voyage without going to <em>Gottenburgh ; </em>on the contrary, they are saved from the risk of loss, which would have existed had she proceeded until her arrival at that port.</p>\n<p data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b127-5\">The meaning of the clause,. as to the return of <em>the fifteen </em>per cent., is, that if no loss happens before the vessel reaches Gottenburgh, and she does not go beyond that port, then so much of the premium is to be returned. The argument that this is an entire risk from <em>Malta </em>to <em>St. Petersburgh, </em>and therefore, it having commenced, the entire premium is to be retained, would apply to every case of an apportionment and return of premium. For certain purposes, for the benefit of the underwriters, the contract is considered entire; but for-other purposes, it is, also, considered as divisible. This is like a voyage at and from <em>New-York </em>to <em>Lisbon, </em>and at and from <em>Lisbon </em>back to <em>New-York, </em>and if the voyage ends in safety at <em>Lisbon, .so </em>much of the premium is to be returned.</p>\n<p data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"pAOe\">The principle is correctly laid down by <em>Park,</em><footnotemark><em>*</em></footnotemark><em> </em>which is supported by the case of <em>Stevenson </em>v. <em>Snow.</em><footnotemark><em>\u2020</em></footnotemark><em> </em>In case of a-deviation, though a return of premium cannot be demanded for the risk which has begun to run, yet it may be demanded for such part of the risk as has not commenced. Marshall<footnotemark>\u2021</footnotemark> \u201c if it be stipulated that there shall be a return of part of the premium for sailing with convoy and arrival, and in consequence of a breach of warranty, or the non-performance of some stipulation, or of a deviation, the underwriters be dis* charged before the ship can sail with convoy, the insured shall be entitled to the stipulated return of-premium, because the discharge of the underwriters is, to them, equivalent to. a sail-, ing with convoy and arrival.\u201d If we generalize this position, (and, to be. a principle of law, it must be generalized,) it-is-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"118\">*118</page-number>this: that wherever the commencement of a risk, for which a premium has been received, has been prevented; by any cause whatever; theinsiired is entitled to a'retum-bf. preunum.</p>\n<p data-order=\"21\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AfHJ\">,It\u2019is said that <em>Marshall </em>is not supported in his position, by the case he cites; but he is clearly supported by the case of <em>Stevenson v. Snow, </em>and <em>Marshall </em>himself is.no- weak authority.</p>\n<p data-order=\"22\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"Ao8U\"><em>Again, </em>in <em>Tyrie </em>v. <em>Fletcher,</em><footnotemark><em>*</em></footnotemark><em> </em>Lord <em>Mansfield </em>says,, \u201c that the underwriter receives the premium for running the risk of in.demnifying the insured, and to Whatever cause it be owing, if he does not run the risk, the consideration for which , the premium was paid; fails, and he, .therefore, ought to return it.\u201d' The present is -an -admitted case of deviation; Which wholly discharged the underwriters from the risk; and though no c\u00e1se precisely similar, as to the facts, is to be found,...yet the general\" principle which is to govern the decision is clear, and perfectly;i applicable. \u2022 \" .- \u25a0 ...

This-is an action to recover back part , of the - premium paid. bn two. policies \u00f3f insurance oil a voyage from <em>Malta </em>to <em>Si.' Fctersburgh. </em>The policy contains several.special stipulations,; \u00e1s to- touching and staying at intermediate, ports. The clause relating to the premium is as follows\u201c At and after the- rate' of forty -per cent,,- to return fifteen, per cent., if the vessel passes the <em>Gut of Gibraltar on or </em>before - the twentieth of <em>June </em>last/ and the risk ends without-loss ; <em>or fifteen per cent', if the risk' ends in .safety at </em>GottenpurghAnd -it is for the return of the' fifteen per cent, last mentioned; that this action is brought.</p>\n<p id=\"AkZ\">While on the voyage, and in the <em>English </em>channel; the supercargo received such information, as to induce him to abandon the voyage to <em>Fctersburgh, </em>aifd go to <em>Loydon.' </em>The argument; urged oh the part of the defendants against the return of premium, is,, that the arrival in safety at Gottenburgh, was the condition upon which- the premium was,to be returned-; and the \u2022 vessel, not having arrived there at all, the. condition.has not been; performed. This, does nbt appear to me to be a fair interpretation. of this provision in the .policy. It would be too rigid a construction, and obviously against the intention of the. parties. The premium is paid for the risk assumed and run by the underwriters. And, although- the\" policy covers .the whole: voyage, from <em>Malta, </em>to <em>St. Peiersburghy </em>if the assured 'should <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"119\">*119</page-number>choose to end it at the latter place, yet the stipulation as to the return of premium manifestly shows, that in the cont\u00e9mplation of the parties, circumstances might occur, which would render it advisable to end the voyage at <em>Gottenburgh. </em>The voyage must, therefore, be considered divisible, and the premium follows such divisibility. The risk from <em>Gottenburgh </em>to <em>St </em>Peters-burgh, was calculated at fifteen per cent., for that sum was to be returned, in case the risk on that part of the voyage was not run. The risk is the consideration for the premium, and it was matter of perfect indifference to the underwriters, whether the vessel arrived at <em>Gottenburgh </em>or not. The assured had the election of terminating the voyage there; and if it was broken off before, the vessel was never On the voyage from <em>Gottenburgh </em>to <em>St. Petersburgh, </em>and the policy never attached, so far as it relates to that part of the voyage. The arrival in safety at <em>Gottenburgh, </em>cannot be presumed to be the contingency upon which the fifteen per cent, was to be returned. It was the exoneration of the underwriters from all risk beyond <em>Gottenburgh, </em>which entitled the assured to a return of premium, according to the fair and reasonable interpretation of the policy. The plaintiff is, accordingly, entitled to judgment. \u25a0</p>\n<p id=\"b129-4\">Spencer, J. not having heard the argument, gave no opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b129-7\">Judgment for the plaintiff.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
