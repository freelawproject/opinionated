The defendant pleaded the general issue, and gave notice of set-off. It appeared, on the trial, that, in the fall of 1810, the plaintiff agreed to purchase of the defendan two acres of land, at 45 dollars per acre; and, towards payment, to let the defendant have a cow, valued at 16 dollars. The contract was by paroi. The defendant, a short time after the bargain, had the land surveyed, and offered to give the plaintiff a deed of it, on receiving a mortgage to secure the payment; but the plaintiff declined receiving the deed, until he had completed the payment.
