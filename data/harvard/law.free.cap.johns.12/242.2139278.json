On being cross-examined, as to which of the owners of the land he had heard acknowledge the existence of the mortgage, he said every one but <em>Brown; </em>and on being cross-examined as to the amount of the mortgage, he said, that the occupants, told him, that only forty acres were mortgaged, and that the slim was forty pounds.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"AFA_\">The defendant then gave in evidence a deed of the premises in question, from <em>Brown </em>to <em>Perine, </em>dated the 5th <em>February, </em>1792 ; a deed from <em>Perine </em>to <em>Lake, </em>date.d the .21st <em>March, </em>1793; a deed from <em>Lake </em>to <em>'Trull, </em>dated 15th <em>April, </em>1796; a deed from <em>Trull </em>to <em>Pierce, </em>dated 24th <em>June, </em>1806.; a. deed from the sheriff of <em>Washington </em>county conveying the title of <em>Fierce </em>to' <em>Cornell, </em>dated the 4th <em>August, </em>1810; a deed from <em>Cornell </em>to the defendant, dated the 1st <em>April, </em>1811.

The statute was made, to protect <em>bona fide </em>purchasers; ' and- the defendant must show himself to-be a purchaser for a valuable consideration, and without notice ; but, from thebvidence, it appears that the defendant, and those under whom, he claimed, had notice of the existence of this mortgage,</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b254-12\">Crary, contra.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AeAS\">The defence relied on in this case is a possession, for more than 20 years, under a claim of title. The lessors of the plaintiff claim under a mortgage, dated 39 years before the trial, The right of entry accrued to the mortgagee long before his attainder.- In presumption of law, the mortgagor still continued in possession. As nothing1 was done by the mortgagee, it must, after so great a lapse of time, be presumed, that the mortgage had been satisfied, and settled, before this attainder; and its having remained so long unregistered, fortifies that presumption, _ '</p>\n<p data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b254-13\">Again, a mortgage is no evidence \u00f3f title, if the mortgagee has never entered, and no interest has been paid for 20 years.<footnotemark>*</footnotemark></p>\n<footnote data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"footnote\" id=\"x999-1\" label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b254-6\"> Jackson v. <em>Hudson, </em>3 <em>Johns.

There xvas no witness who spoke of any acknoxvledgment of ,the several oxvners of the land, that there was any mortgage upon it, xvhich was in force and unpaid, except <em>Asa Rice; </em>and he does not identify the mortgage now in question. The one he heard spoken of xvas for 40/. ; and upon forty, instead of one hundred, acres of land. And he, too, contradicted himself, first saying he had heard all the oxvners aeknoxvledge the mortgage, and afterwards admitting that he had never heard <em>Brown </em>make any such acknoxvledgment. And, besides, his knowledge of the lot seemed to be imperfect, and recent, xvhen compared with the date of the mortgage. Under such circumstances, the jury might well question the accuracy of his memory. The acknowledgments spoken of by all, the other xvitnesses . were in reference to mere vague rumours, and by no means recognizing this as a valid subsisting mortgage, for which the owners of the land held themselves responsible. And their conduct shoxvs, that they did not consider it in this light. For, in the numerous sales made of the premises, no deduction in the purchase money appears to have been made on this account; and warranty deeds xvere given, xvithout any exception of the mortgage. No bond xvas shown; and the mortgage not having been registered, no discharge upon it was absolutely ne- \u25a0 cessary to invalidate it. Payment of the bond xvould operate as. a discharge of the mortgage. The presumption of the payment, and extinguishment of such an old outstanding mortgage, ought to be pretty liberally indulged. Where the mortgagee has never entered into possession of the mortgaged premises, txventy years xvithout any demand, or any interest having been paid, has alxvays been deemed a sufficient length of tim\u00e9 to xvarrant the\" presumption of satisfaction. (3 <em>Johns. </em>Rep. 386. 7 <em>Johns. Rep. </em>283. <em>Bull. N. P. </em>110.) The mortgage not having been registered, cannot be set off against subsequent <em>bona fide </em>purchasers, unless notice of the mortgage is brought home to them. What is said by the court in <em>Jackson </em>v. Given, (8 Johns. <em>Rep. </em>140.) is very much in point, that mere loose conversations will not warrant the inference of notice. And Lord Hardwicke, in <em>Hine </em>v. Dodd, (2 <em>Atk. </em>275.) said, that mere suspicion of notice was not\" enough to break in upon the registry <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"246\">*246</page-number>act; nothing short of fraud or dear and undoubted notice would do. The sam\u00e9 doctrine has been recognised in other cases. Under <em>these circumstances, </em>the jury were fully warranted in presuming, either an extinguishment of this mortgage, or a want of due notice of its existence. The motion for a new trial must accordingly be denied.</p>\n<p id=\"b256-4\">Motion denied..</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
