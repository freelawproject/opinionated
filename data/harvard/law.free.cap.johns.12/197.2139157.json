The plaintiffs, in this court, then stated an award of the arbitrators, that <em>Newton </em>should pay to them, 680 dollars and 36 cents, in two days thereafter, and notice of the award to Newton, and to the defendant, that neither of them had paid the money ; and that the defendant had not kept his said covenant and guaranty so by him rtiade, &amp;c.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"3\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b207-14\">To this count there was a demurrer and joinder.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b207-15\">I. <em>Hamilton, </em>in support of the demurrer.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"Aost\">He cited 1 <em>Chitty's Pl. </em>348. 1 <em>Saund.

The demurrer to the fourth count is well taken; the action is covenant, and it cannot be maintained but on a deed. The only averment or allegation of a deed is, \u201c and hereupon the defendant, on the 24th day of <em>March, </em>in the year aforesaid, entered into a guaranty, covenant, and agreement, in the words and figures followingthen the agreement is set out <em>in hcec verba, </em>with a \u00a1conclusion, that it was signed and sealed with the name of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"198\">*198</page-number>defendant, and the <em>locus sigilli, </em>purporting to be a literal oyer of the agreement.</p>\n<p id=\"AHsf\">jj. must appear that the contract was under seal, and the law will not intend that it was sealed, unless it be expressly averred to be so, and though the bond or d\u00e9ed, upon oyer, recite, \u201c in witness whereof we have hereunto set our hands and seals,\u201d yet that does not amount to such an averment, but. that the party must show that the bond or deed was actually sealed by the other. These principles will be found in <em>Cabel </em>v. <em>Vaughan, </em>(1 <em>Saun. </em>291. note 1,<footnotemark>*</footnotemark>) where all the cases are carefully and accurately collected. There are some words of art,' such as indenture, <em>deed, </em>or writing obligatory, which, of themselves, import that the instrument was sealed ; but if it be alleged that <em>J. S. </em>by his certain writing, demised or covenanted, without averring that it was sealed, the court will not intend that the writing was sealed. (Cro. <em>Eliz. 571. Ld. Ray. 2537. </em>8 <em>Com. Dig. Fait (A. </em>2.) Pleader, 2 W. 9. 14.)</p>\n<p id=\"b208-7\">In the case of <em>Warren </em>v. <em>Lynch, </em>(5 <em>Johns. </em>244.) this court decided that a scrawl for a seal, with an (L. S.) was not a seal, and deserved no notice, and that calling a paper a deed will not make it one, if it want the requisite formalities. - The <em>oyer </em>of the contract, therefore, set out in the count under consideration, can have no effect; for we cannot tell that the original differs from it, or possesses any of the properties of a seal.</p>\n<p id=\"AutY\">The other objections taken by the defendant\u2019s counsel are not tenable, but it is not now necessary to consider them, as-the count is bad for the reasons assigned.</p>\n<p id=\"b208-9\">Judgment for the' defendant, with leave to amend on the usual terms.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b208-6\"> Chitty, 348.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
