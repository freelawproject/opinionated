He also produced a deed from <em>Abraham Bellr </em>dated the 22d of <em>March, </em>1808, for the whole lot, and proved that he was in possession of the premises in question, under that deed, at the date of the deeds from <em>J'ulia Ann Williams </em>and her husband, to the <em>Bristols, </em>above mentioned. It appeared that, eight years ago. <em>Bell </em>purchased the possession of some person then on the lot, but without colour of title, and that, at that time, about fifteen acres had been cleared and improved; and that, at the time of the trial, about thirty acres had been cleared.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b463-7\"><em>Rice, </em>for the plaintiff,</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"A6K\">contended, that there was no adverse possession in this case, and that the person of whom <em>Bell </em>purchased the mere possession, must be considered to have held it for the rightful owner, <em>Williams. </em>He cited <em>Brandt </em>v. <em>Ogden, </em>(1 <em>Johns. Rep. </em>156.) <em>Smith </em>v. <em>Burtis, </em>(6 <em>Johns. Rep. 197.) Jackson </em>v. <em>Sharp, </em>(9 <em>Johns. Rep. </em>164\u2014166.) <em>Doe </em>v. <em>Campbell, </em>(10 <em>Johns.

In <em>Jackson </em>v. <em>Sharp, </em>the defendant entered without colour of title, for the benefit of the patentee. This case was, in this respect, like that of <em>Jackson </em>v. <em>Wheeler, </em>(10 <em>Johns. Rep. </em>164.) If the defendant entered on the 15 acres, claiming title to the whole, the case of <em>Jackson, ex dem. Putnam, </em>v. <em>Bowen </em>(1 Caines\u2019 <em>Rep. </em>358.) was in point, and decisive as to the adverse possession.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b463-13\"><em>Per </em>Curiam.</author>\n<p id=\"ANN\">The title of the. <em>Bristols, </em>two of the lessors <em>6% </em>the plaintiff, cannot be affected by the two deeds, previously executed <em>to Jehiel Day, for </em>the same premises, because neither of those deeds were recorded; .and it does not appear that the Bristols purchased,, with notice, or knowledge of those prior, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"454\">*454</page-number>deeds to <em>Day ; </em>and explicit proof of such notice, or knowledge,. is indispensable to supply the defect of a prior registry. Without such evidence-, the deed first registered must'prevail against a previous unregistered deed, or the statute, requiring the registry of those deeds, would be nugatory. But it appears from the case, that on the 22d of March, 1808, the defendant had purchased from one <em>Abraham </em>Bell, the whole of this lot, and that he was in possession of the premises in question, under that deed, at the dates of the two deeds to- the <em>Bristols. </em>It is,, therefore, evident, that the defendant entered and possessed under <em>BelPs </em>deed to him. This was an original entry, under colour of title, sufficient to make it a possession and- holding adverse to the title of <em>Williams </em>and his wife, and prevents the operation of the deeds given by them to the <em>Bristols ; </em>and having thus entered, and improved a part of the lot, with a claim to the whole, under this deed, he must be deemed in adverse possession of the whole lot.</p>\n<p id=\"b464-8\">If an adverse possession of part, with a claim of title to the whole lot, for twenty years, would bar the action of <em>ejectment% </em>and we have so decided in Jackson, <em>ex dem. Putnam and </em>others, v. <em>Bowen, </em>(1 <em>Caines, </em>358.,) then it will hardly be questioned, but that the existence of this possession will destroy the operation of the de,eds given to the <em>Bristols. </em>at the time; nor can the manner it was originally obtained by <em>Bell, </em>change the character of the possession; because the defendant held under q, deed in fee, and claimed the whole, in virtue of that deed.. Whether the person who sold to him had purchased the naked possession, or not, cannot avail. The lot was held and possessed adversely, at <em>the date </em>of those deeds, and that is sufficient. They must be deemed inoperative and void.</p>\n<p id=\"b464-9\">Judgment for the defendant..</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
