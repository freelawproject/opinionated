The defendant pleaded not guilty, with notice of special justification, to be given in evidence on the trial. At the trial, in <em>July, </em>1814, it was proved, on the part of the plaintiff, that, in <em>January, </em>1814, <em>Sham </em>was arrested, at <em>Adams, </em>distant about fifteen miles from <em>Sachet\u2019s Harbour, </em>by two persons, whose name's were <em>Hopkins </em>and Findley, and carried by them to <em>Sachet\u2019s </em>Harbour. The witness applied to the defendant to get <em>Sham </em>released, and the <em>ri </em>\u00b0 defendant said he had a man in the <em>provost </em>guard, by the name - \u2014 \u2014 of <em>Sham, </em>w ho had been brought there by <em>Hopkins; </em>that he had been confined four or five days, on charges of treason, and of being a spy; and that he, the defendant, should not release <em>Sham, </em>until he had seen Lieutenant <em>Hopkitis, </em>who was expected <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"258\">*258</page-number>to return to <em>Sachet's Harbour </em>in eight or ten days; that he, the defendant, was not acquainted with the civil law, but knew the martial law, and should be governed by it; that he should re- ^ gr\u00e9t to keep an innocent man in confinement, and, if he were satisfied of the innocence of <em>ShdW, </em>he would release him. <em>Sham </em>was brought before the defendant, by his order, and stated that' a person of the name of <em>Burr, </em>at <em>Sachet's Harbour, </em>knew. .Mm to be a citizen of the <em>U. States. Smith </em>made some excuse for not then sending for <em>Burr, </em>but said he would send for him the next day, and remanded <em>Sham </em>to the guard house; The witness understood from <em>Smith, </em>that he. was the commanding officer at <em>Sachet's Harbour, </em>The witness, about ten days after, saw <em>Sham </em>at large, in <em>Adams, </em>^</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"A8Z\">Another witness stated, that when <em>Smith </em>was applied to, as above stated* iu: behalf of <em>Sham, </em>he appeared to have forgotten Ht\u00f3* and observed, that he had been very much occupied; that he regretted to detain an innocent man; but that he must investigate the case, before he could, with propriety, discharge him. It was proved that A/ra?y, (a native of <em>Scotland,') </em>was a naturalized citizen of the <em>United States, </em>and resided, in the county of <em>St, Lawrence </em>at the time of his arrest. ,</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b268-9\">The defendant below, offered to prove* in justification* that on the 6th of <em>January, </em>1814, the plaintiff below ivas committed by <em>Hopkins </em>and <em>Findley\u2019, </em>then officers in the army of the <em>United </em>States, to the officer commanding the provost guard at <em>Sachet's Harbour, </em>and, by their order, was taken and kept by that officer, in his custody; that <em>Hopkins </em>and <em>Findley, </em>at the time of the commitment of the plaintiff, delivered to the officer of th\u00e9 guard, a writing signed by them, stating the bharg\u00e9s \u00e1gairist th\u00e9 plaintiff to be* \u201c exciting insurrection and mutiny among the good, citizens of the' <em>United States, </em>at the town of <em>Adams, </em>in the state <em>of New-York, </em>on the 6tb of January* 1814 ^ violating his parole as a prisoner of the enemy, and engaging in an illicit trade, to furnish the enemy with necessaries frdm the <em>United States:\" \u2018 \u201c </em>Being an enemy\u2019s spy in tim\u00e9 of war, between <em>Great Britain </em>and the <em>United </em>Statesunder which last charge, It was specified, \u201c making improper and suspicious inquiries Of, and concerning the tnitit\u00e1iy post at <em>Sachet\u2019s Harbour, </em>in the vicinity of the same; and. for. lurking in and; about said poist, without any apparent cause, of businesSi\u2019\u2019 Th\u00e9 defend-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"259\">*259</page-number>gilt further offered to prove, that the plaintiff was so committed, and so received,' and detained by the officer of the provost guard; that it was the same detention complained of; and that * the defendant could not legally prevent the said arrest and detention of the plaintiff.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b269-5\">The court below refused to admit the evidence thus offered by the defendant, in justification; but decided, that it might be received in <em>mitigation of </em>damages ; and witli tliat .direction the caus\u00e9 was left to the jury, who found a verdict for the plaintiff .for 7,79 dollars and 25 c.ents. The counsel for the defendant tendered a bill of exceptions to the opinion of the court below, on which the writ of error was brought to this coprt.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b269-6\"><em>Sterling, </em>for the plaintiff in error,</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AXs\">contended, that the evidence offered by the defendant, in justification, was improperly rejected by the court. The. defendant below was not answerable for the arrest of the plaintiff. It was made without the knowledge or consent of the defendant,, who knew nothing of the plaintiff, until he was committed to the custody of the officer of the provost guard. Was the-defendant hound to,discharge without any inquiry into the circumstances of the case ? It does not follow', because a person has a command, or control over the arresting officer, that he is responsible to the person arrested, without notice.of his1 being unlawfully detained. Legal notice to the defendant, must be the decision of a court martial, as to the innocency of the prisoner. According to the Jaws and usages of war, the defendant could not have discharged <em>Sham </em>without investigating the causes of his. commitment.</p>\n<p data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AkGr\">By the articles of xvar, (80, 81, 82.,) an officer commanding a guard, or provost marshal, is bound to receive and keep any prisoner committed to his charge by an officer of the army, provided such officer delivers an account in writing, signed by .him, of the crime with xvhich the prisoner is charged ; and such prisoner cannot be released \u201c xvithout proper authority.\u201d</p>\n<p data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b269-8\">The \u201c proper authority,\u201d mentioned in the articles of war, is not the will' and pleasure of the commanding officer, but the .decision of a regular court -martial. It may. he .said, perhaps, that .the defendant did not proceed, according to the articles pf .war, hut discharged the plaintiff, after,xv.ar.ds, on being convinced of his innocence, xvithout any court-martial having been held. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"260\">*260</page-number>If the defendant did so, he acted without proper authority,, and g,t his peril.</p>\n<p data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"A3_36\">But we contend, that the detention of the plaintiff was not unlawful The plaintiff was charged with being a <em>spy, </em>and with a breach of his <em>pcirole ; </em>these were offences within the jurisdiction of a court martial It is enough to justify the officer, that the <em>subject matter is </em>within the jurisdiction of the court. If the- Court has no jurisdiction as to <em>the person </em>of the party arrested, he must come in and plead it.<footnotemark>*</footnotemark> We do hot pretend that <em>citizens </em>are subject to courts martial for crimes; but if the <em>sub&lt;\u00a1ect matter </em>is Within the lufisdictioh of a court martial-the party . . T <em>n </em>.- must plead, that he is <em>&amp; citizen, </em>and not a soldie.r. In <em>Grant </em>v. <em>Gould,</em><footnotemark><em>\u2020</em></footnotemark><em> </em>it was admitted, that a court martial had a right to try and decide the question, whether <em>soldier </em>or hot. Such a power is inseparable from its jurisdiction/ It must, however, take care to decide the question on proper and sufficient evidence.</p>\n<p data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AB8\">But we contend, that the plaintiff^ as to his <em>person, </em>was subject to a court martial; he was an <em>alien, </em>born in the enemy\u2019s country, and, <em>prima facie, </em>was an alien enemy.</p>\n<p data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b270-9\">. Again, admitting that the plaintiff was! a naturalized citizen, <em>he </em>might, on the principles of natural and Unalienable allegiance, <em>be </em>treated as a spy. He might be treated according to the laws of his native country. The doctrine of perpetual allegiaiice has been recognised-by our courts. In the case of <em>Isaac Williams, </em>who was:tried in the circuit court of the <em>United States, </em>for the district <em>o\u00ed Connecticut, </em>in <em>September, </em>1799, Chief Justice <em>Ellsworth, </em>adopted the principle and the reasoning of Black-<em>stone, </em>relative to allegiance, or the political compact,1 and considered it as still the common law of this country. He accordingly rejected the evidence offered by the prisoner, to show that he was a naturalized citizen of <em>France.</em></p>\n<p data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b270-10\">A court martial had: power to try the question, whether <em>Shan </em>Was a <em>naturalized citizen </em>or not, Citizenship is a plea that might be urged by every person arrested as' a spy, and it must necessarily be.tried by the court martial before whom <em>he is </em>brought. It may be said the articles' of war of the <em>United States </em>speak only of officers and soldiers: so do the <em>mutiny acts, </em>in <em>England; </em>yet courts martial try the question, whether a p\u00e9rson is a soldier or not.</p>\n<p data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b271-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"261\">*261</page-number>Again, as io the policy of this doctrine: it is essential to the \u00b0 - . 7 rrir* . public safety* <em>Saluspopuh, supremo lex e$t&gt; </em>1 his is nota doctrine dangerous to liberty, or to the rights of citizens, qualified as it is with the requisites, that there must be a case of necessity, <em>aprobable cause, </em>for the arrest. <em>Silent leges inter arma. </em>In cases which are for the public good, a man may justify doing a wrong; as, in time of war, a person may erect bulwarks on the land of another.<footnotemark>*</footnotemark> A man may justify pulling down a house that is burning, to save the neighbouring houses. Cases of necessity and public exigency are exceptions to the general rules of common law. If the rights of public property may be violated, in time of war, for the public good, why may not the rights of person be violated also ? It is admitted on all hands, that if the plaintiff had been a <em>spy, </em>his detention would have been justifiable and proper. Now, the defendant did nothing more than every officer, in his situation, was bound to do; that is, to make inquiry into the truth of the facts charged against the prisoner, whom it was necessary to detain, until the fact of his being a spy, or not, could be ascertained. - It is impossible for the commanding officer to know whether the person arrested is a spy or not, without investigation.</p>\n<p data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b271-7\">But the plaintiff being an <em>alien, born in Scotland, -was, prima, facie, </em>an enemy; and there was, therefore, a probable cause for the detention.</p>\n<p data-order=\"21\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b271-8\">Again, had not the defendant a right to detain the plaintiff, in order to deliver him over to the civil power, there being a charge of treason against him? The 82d article of war requires every officer or provost marshal, to whose charge prisoners are committed, within twenty-four hours after such commitment, or as soon as relieved from his guard, to report, in writing, to the commanding, officer, the names of the prisoners, their crimes, and the names of the persons who committed them. \u2022</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"22\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b271-9\"><em>Storrs, </em>contra, <em>(Van Vechten, </em>same side.)</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"23\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"Akh\">The plaintiff being, a naturalized citizen of the <em>United States, </em>is, by our law, entitled to all the rights and privileges of a native citizen, without exception. Even in <em>England, </em>an alien naturalized by act of parliament, though incapable of holding certain offices, is in the same state as if he had been born in the king\u2019s ligeance,<footnotemark>\u2020</footnotemark> and is entitled to the same privileges and immunities. The doctrine of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"262\">*262</page-number>perpetual allegiance has no, application to this -case. The question is not between the government of the <em>United States </em>and.that of <em>Great Britain, </em>lout between this govetn$nent :and one of \u00a1it.\u00ae naturalized citizens. The policy of our \u00a1government has been to protect its naturalized citizens,, not only In this country, but everywhere; and, if they did not receive the same .protection as a native citizen, the act. of naturalization would he -.a cruel mockery.</p>\n<p data-order=\"24\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"ApfW\">\u25a0 Then, what .are the rights and \u00a1privileges of a native citizen! He is entitled, in every possible case, to proteption from military power. The laws, rules, and articles of war apply \u00a1exclusively to officers and soldiers, or-such persons as are subject to military jaw, These military \u25a0 courts martial are of very \u00a1special and -limited jurisdiction. Martial law, as it'is called, is, as Sir <em>Mat* then Hale</em><footnotemark><em>\u2021</em></footnotemark><em> </em>observes, in truth, no -law, .but something merely indulged as law.,<footnotemark>(a)</footnotemark> Tiie civil .or municipal law knows no such thing as a <em>military state </em>or military-court. \u00bfOur citizens, in this respect, are in the same state as \"if no war existed. Independent of the mutiny act\" in <em>England, or </em>of our act of congress relative to the-army, \u00f1o such thing as a court martial or military law is known. Without this special act, a court martial wopld not have power- even to try a <em>spy. </em>Being a spy-is an offence agairist the law of nations, and might .be tried by a court of common law. The second section of the act establishing rules and articles of war, passed <em>April </em>10, 1806, d\u00e9fines a spy. It-declares, 41 that, in time of war, all persons-not citizens of, or owing allegiance to, the' <em>United States of America, mho </em>shall be found lurking as spies, in or about the fortifications or encampments of \u2018the-armies of the <em>United States, </em>or any of them, shall suffer death, according to the law and usage of nations, by sentence of a general court martial.\u201d It cannot, surely, be -pretended that the plaintiff, a naturalized citizen, could lie treated as a spy. The plaintiff is entitled to all the benefits of our constitution \u25a0and bill of rights. . It is one of the very grievances enumerated in the declaration.of independence; that the-king had affected to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"263\">*263</page-number>render the military independent of, and superior to, the civil power. It is matter of astonishment, that in less than forty years, and in the life of the men who framed that instrument, it should be urged in a court of justice, that this military power can be exercised in this country: in <em>England </em>it would not even be debated.</p>\n<p data-order=\"25\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b273-4\">The bill of exceptions does not state even that the defendant offered to prove, that the plaintiff was lurking in or about the fortifications or camp at <em>Sachet's Harbour. </em>If the defendant meant to justify, he ought to have pleaded specially, or given notice of the precise facts he intended to prove. The notice states no more than what the defendant offered to prove, namely, that <em>Hopkins </em>and <em>Findley, </em>officers of the army of the <em>United-</em>States, committed the plaintiff to the officer of the guard, or provost marshal; and that the defendant, therefore, had a right to detain him, until he inquired into his case, or had the plaintiff tried by a court martial.</p>\n<p data-order=\"26\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b273-5\">If the two officers who arrested the plaintiff were trespassers, then the defendant was a trespasser: he must be deemed, by relation, a party to the original arrest; in judgment of law, he was present, and a party to the arrest\u2014every officer and soldier was under his absolute command and control. The plaintiff^ moreover, was brought into the presence of the defendant, and claimed his rights as a citizen, but the defendant ordered him back to the guard house. A moment\u2019s delay, after such a claim, for any cause, was unjustifiable. A military commander, after a claim of citizenship, cannot detain the party, or, if he does so, it is at his peril. The defendant said he knew nothing of the civil law, but should be governed by the martial law.</p>\n<p data-order=\"27\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b273-6\">Because courts martial have jurisdiction over spies, it does not follow that they have a right to detain and try every person charged as a spy. To make out a justification, the defendant should show that he had jurisdiction over the <em>person </em>of the plaintiff. If a military commander is allowed to be a judge, and to decide the question whether a person is a citizen or not, he has jurisdiction throughout, and may order a court martial, and have the party tried and executed. If such be the law, on what ground did this court issue a <em>habeas </em>corpus, in the case of <em>Stacy, </em>to a military commander, and order an attachment against him, in case he did not discharge the prisoner forthwith? If the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"264\">*264</page-number>commander, in'that instance,, had authority to try, this court could not discharge oh <em>habeas corpus.</em></p>\n<p data-order=\"28\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AW2\">But it issaid the defendant might detain the plaintiff, in order to hand him over.to the civil magistrate.. This is a new ground of justification. The defendant did not pretend to b\u00e9, a civil or peace officer. It is-the first time we have heard of military commanders being peace officers. An officer of the peace is bound to inquire, arid may justify an arrest, and detention, on <em>probable, cause. </em>A,mere citizen arresting another for a felony, does it at his peril. \" But what grounds, or probable caus\u00e9 have been shown by the defendant ? The plaintiff was arrested, fifteen miles' from <em>Sachet\u2019s </em>Harbour, and his. place of residence was more than one hundred miles from that place. . 1 ' ; .</p>\n<p data-order=\"29\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b274-5\">Again, the facts, in justification were before the jury.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"30\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"A6WZ\"><em>N. Williams, in </em>reply,</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"31\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"A6P\">said* the question-was,, whether\" the defendant was acting, as a ministerial officer, in a case in, which it was his duty to act. If he was, and he exercised his best judgment, he cannot, by any. principle of law, or doctrine of <em>relation, </em>be made a trespasser.<footnotemark>*</footnotemark> The\" defendant merely received a prisoner who had been arrested by officers who had a right to arrest. ' . ' '</p>\n<p data-order=\"32\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"A6x\">The detention of the plaintiff, before he was reported to the defendant, Cannot be imputed to the defendant. And,1 the defendant had a right, afterwards, to detain the plaintiff a reasonable time, to inquire into the case, and ascertain the truth of his claim to be discharged.<footnotemark>\u2020</footnotemark> And what is a reasonable time, must depend on the circumstances of the- case. <em>Now </em>the Court below decided that the defendant'had no right to detain the plaintiff at all, not that he detained him an unreasonable time.</p>\n<p data-order=\"33\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"Auo\">Admitting that the defendant had no right to decide the questioti, whether the plaintiff was a citizen or not; we say, that for that very reason,\" he had a right to detain him, until the: question could be decided by a court martial,\" or the proper authority. \u25a0</p>\n<footnote data-order=\"34\" data-type=\"footnote\" id=\"x999-1\" label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"AqCU\"><em> Lucking </em>v.

The action was for false imprisonment; and the defendant, under the general issue, gave notice of a justification; to support which, upon the trial, he offered to prove, that the plaintiff was committed to the <em>provost </em>guard by <em>Hopkins </em>and <em>Findley, </em>who were officers of the army of the <em>United States, </em>charging him, the plaintiff, in writing, with having excited mutiny among the citizens of the <em>United States, </em>violating his parole, as a prisoner, and engaging in an illicit trade, and furnishing the enemy with necessaries from the <em>United States, </em>and being an enemy\u2019s spy in time of war between <em>Great Britain </em>and the <em>United States. </em>It appeared in evidence, on the part of the plaintiff below, that he was a naturalized citizen of the <em>United </em>States, and was arrested by <em>Findley </em>and <em>Hopkins, </em>at a place called Adams, about fifteen miles distant from <em>Backet's Harbour, </em>where the army was stationed. Under these circumstances, the question presented to the court below was, whether the evidence offered on the part of the defendant, would amount to a justification. It was overruled as a justification, but admitted, or offered to be received, in mitigation of damages.</p>\n<p id=\"b275-5\">There can be no doubt but that the rights and the responsibility of the defendant must be governed by the rules of law, applicable to courts of special and limited jurisdiction. And it is a general rule, that where such a court has neither jurisdiction of the subject matter, nor of the person, every thing done is absolutely void, and all are trespassers who are concerned in the proceedings. None of the offences charged against <em>Shan </em>were cognizable by a court-martial, except that which related to his being a spy; and if he was an <em>American </em>citizen, he could not be charged with such an offence. He might be amenable to the civil authority for treason ; but could not be punished under martial law, as a spy. There was, therefore, a want of jurisdiction, either of the person or of the subject matter, as to all the offences alleged against the plaintiff. There; can be no doubt but that <em>Hopkins </em>and <em>Findley </em>were trespassers,; and the defendant\u2019s liability must depend upon the fact how far he has ratified and affirmed their acts, or has himself undertaken to exercise any restraint over the plaintiff. Had he barely refused to discharge him until tried by a court martial, I should <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"266\">*266</page-number>question' Whether he could be made a trespasser by such refusal, But he went further, and, in some measure, affirmed the arrest; for, on application being made to him in behalf of the plaintiff, he said, <em>he </em>had such a man in the provost guard, and that he should not release him,, until he saw <em>Hopkins ; </em>that he knew the martial law,, and must be,governed by it; thus claiming the right to hold.and try him by a court martial. Nor did the defendant stop here: he undertook to act affirmatively, and ordered the plaintiff to be-brought before him, , and after making some examination and inquiries, remanded him to the custody of the <em>provosf </em>marshal. This was a direct and positive exercise of authority and restraint.' ,</p>\n<p id=\"b276-8\">The damages recovered against, the defendant appear to me to be very -high ; but this is \u00e1 question, which cannot be taken into consideration by, this, court. The judgment must - be affirmed, unless the evidence offered by the. defend, ant could -have afforded a complet\u00e9 justification. The conduct, of the defendant in this case, does not appear to- have been harsh and oppressive. But it is the principle involved in it, which renders the question important. If the defendant was-justifiable in doing what he did, every citizen of the <em>United \u00a1States </em>would, ip time of war, be equally exposed to a like exercise of military power and authority: It was not pretended pn the argument, that if the plaintiff was a citizen he was amenable to a court martial for any of the offences alleged against him. And the defendant could- certainly have no legal right to detain him to try that question before a court martial. In this respect, lie acted at his peril. Suppose a <em>habeas corpus </em>had <em>been issued </em>from this court to bring up the plaintiff, would it have been a sufficient return by the defendant, that he detained him for the purpose of trying by a court martial whether he was a citizen or not. The defendant does, not stand in the situ* ation of a subordinate officer, bound to obey the command of Ills superiors. He was the commanding officer at <em>Sachet's Harbour, </em>and had a right, without doubt, to discharge the plaintiff. At' all events, <em>Hopkins </em>and <em>Findley </em>had no authority to compel him to detain him. Had the suit.been against the provost marshal, more difficulty would have been presented. For, under the rules and articles of war, he was bound to receive him; and he would -have exposed himself to punishment had he voluntarily released him. (1 <em>Sess. </em>9 <em>Cong. </em>ch. <em>20. </em>Ar. 30, 81.) The <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"267\">*267</page-number>situation of the provost marshal might be considered somewhat analogous to that of the pound-keeper in <em>Badkin </em>v. <em>Powell, (Cowp. 476.) </em>where it Was held, that he was not a trespasser merely for receiving a distress, though the original taking was tortious, because he was bound to take and keep whatever was brought to him\u00bb But the defendant cannot be protected under this principle. He had, as I have before shown, made himself the <em>party </em>detaining the plaintiff. The general rule which appears to be laid down in the books is, that where the subject matter of any suit is not within the jurisdiction of the court applied to for redress, every thing done is absolutely void, and the officer, as well as the party, becomes a trespasser. But when the subject matter is within the jurisdiction of the court, and the want of jurisdiction is to the person or place* then the officer is excused, unless the want of jurisdiction appears on the process. (10 <em>Coke, 76. Hard. </em>480.) But in the case of <em>Wise </em>v. <em>Withers, </em>(3 <em>Cranch, </em>331.) the liability, even of the officer, was extended by the supreme court of the <em>United States </em>beyond what this rule would seem to warrant. It was there held, that trespass lies against a collector of militia fines* who distrained for a fine imposed by a court martial upon a person not liable to be enrolled $ the court martial having no jurisdiction in such cases. The court said, it is a settled principle that the decision of such a tribunal, in a case clearly without its jurisdiction, cannot protect the officer who acts under it; that the court and officers are all trespassers. It is unnecessary, in the present case, to press the principle so far, as the defendant cannot, in any manner, be considered as standing-in the light of a ministerial officer. That a want of jurisdiction of the person renders the proceedings void, and makes the party procuring them a trespasser, is well settled. As in the case of <em>Perkin </em>v. <em>Proctor, </em>(2 <em>Wils. </em>382.) where it was held, that trespass lies against the assignees under a commission of bankruptcy, sued out against a person not liable to be declared a bankrupt. And in the case of <em>Mostyn </em>v. <em>Fabrigas, (Cowp. </em>175.) Lord <em>Mansfield, </em>in giving the opinion of the court, refers to a suit brought by a carpenter in the train of artillery, against Governor <em>Sabine, </em>who had barely confirmed the sentence of a court martial, by which the plaintiff had been tried and sentenced to be whipped, and the governor was held responsible, in an action of trespass, <em>because the plaintiff mas not liable to </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"268\">*268</page-number><em>martial Ian. </em>Although there is; no reason to believe, but. that: the defendant acted in good.faith, and under an honest impression,..that he.- was'discharging his duty, yet we think he,acted. without- authority*- and that the matter offered in evidence would not have afforded a justification. .The judgment of the court below must therefore be affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"43\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-10\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"AlN\">Spencer, J.,</author>\n<p id=\"AOj\">(dissenting.)

I shall content myself with merely .stating the grounds of my dissent. \"\u25a0</p>\n<p id=\"Akt6\">' It cannot be pretended that the plaintiff in error is at all responsible for- the arrest of AAdr\u00f3 .By. <em>'Hopkins: </em>and <em>Findley:, </em>and his first imprisonment in the provost guard. The 8.0th article of the act for the establishing rules and articles for the government of the. armies of the <em>United States, </em>provides, that no officer commanding a guard, or provost marshal, shall refuse to receive, or keep, any prisoner committed to his charge, by an offi-. eer belonging to- the forces of the <em>United .States, </em>provided the officer committing shall, at\"the same time, deli ver an account, in writing, signed by himself, of the crime with which the prisoner is charged. The 81st article forbids an -officer uomm\u00e9nding; a guard, or provost marshal, releasing any person committed to his charge, without proper authority/ for so doing. The 65th article authorizes\u2019any general .officer, \u2022 commanding an army, \u00a9r colonel, Commanding a separate department, to appoint g\u00e9nerai courts martial.</p>\n<p id=\"b278-5\"><em>Hopkins </em>and <em>Findley, </em>it - was offered to be shown, were, at the time of <em>Shaw\u2019s </em>commitment,, officers in the army of the <em>United States j </em>-that they committed him- to the officer of the guard, or provost marshal, and at the same time delivered to him an account in- writing, signed by them, of the crimes with which they charged <em>Shaiv, </em>among which was the .following,;, his \u201c being an -enemy\u2019s spy, in time of war between <em>Great Britain </em>and the <em>United States,\u201d </em>with a specification of his \u201c making improper and suspicious inquiries of and concerning the military post at <em>Sachet\u2019s Harbour, </em>in the vicinity of the same, and for lurking in and about the said post without any apparent cause or business,\u2019\u2019 . \u2018 \u2019\u25a0/</p>\n<p id=\"b278-7\">The bill of, exceptions furnishes ho evidence* direct, pre-' <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"269\">*269</page-number>sutnptive, or probable, that the plaintiff in error was, in the least, privy to the defendant\u2019s arrest by <em>Hopkins </em>and <em>Findley, </em>or his reception by the officer of the guard, or provost marshal. The 80th article virtually confers on any officer belonging to the forces of the <em>United States, </em>the power of committing, as prisoners, such as have committed offences cognizable by military law. Whether they are responsible for arresting persons not amenable to a military tribunal, is not the present question. It is enough to exempt the plaintiff in error from any liability for the acts of inferior officers, that they have the power to commit offenders for trial, and, especially, when the superior officer has not, in any manner, participated in the act of commitment. The article in question, by requiring the provost marshal to receive any prisoner, committed as the defendant in error was, presupposes the right of any officer to commit; and every officer possesses this right independently of his superior.</p>\n<p id=\"b279-4\">To maintain that the plaintiff in error is responsible for such an act, without any privity of his, is, in effect, to maintain that a commanding officer is responsible for every act of an inferior officer or soldier under his command; a doctrine too absurd to require refutation.</p>\n<p id=\"b279-5\">It appears from the bill of exceptions that the defendant was a naturalized citizen of the <em>United States, </em>born in <em>Scotland, </em>and then residing in the county of <em>St. </em>Lawrence, and as such, by the 2d section of the Act of Congress of the 10th of <em>April, </em>1806, was not liable to be tried as a spy ; and it has been contended, that as there was a want of jurisdiction over the person of the defendant, all who were concerned in arresting and detaining him were guilty of false imprisonment.</p>\n<p id=\"b279-6\">I am free to admit, that <em>Hopkins </em>and <em>Findley </em>were trespassers. Their act was self moved and voluntary, and at their peril; but I am not prepared to admit that the <em>provost marshal, </em>or the plaintiff, were trespassers. As to the provost marshal, we perceive that the 80th and 81st articles of war require him, under certain conditions, which, in this instance, were complied with, to receive prisoners committed to his charge; and he is forbidden to release them without proper authority for so doing. The case of <em>Badkin </em>v. <em>Powell and others, (Cowp. </em>476.) is expressly in point. There, an action of trespass was brought against two persons, for taking the plaintiff\u2019s horse and cart, as well as against thepound-keeper, for receiving them: the original taking <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"270\">*270</page-number>was admitted to be wrongful; and the .court held, that, as the pound-keeper was bound\u2019to take and keep whatever was brought \u00bfo him, at the peril of the person who brings it, he was not a trespasser ; and Lord <em>Mansfield </em>said, \u201cit would be.terrible were tie liable to an action for refusing to take cattle in, and were he also liable in another action for not letting them go.\u201d As to the plaintiff in error,fit is urged, that if he be not answerable for the original imprisonment, he made himself so by remanding <em>Shaw </em>to the custody of the provost marshal.</p>\n<p id=\"b280-3\">It appears, by the bill of exceptions, -that <em>Shawdtds </em>brought before the \"plaintiff in error, who was the commanding officer at <em>\u25a0Sackefs </em>Harbour, when the defendant stated, that a Mr. <em>Bun' </em>knew him to be a citizen of the <em>United States </em>,\u2022 the plaintiff in error made some excuse for not sending for <em>Burr </em>at that time, but said he would on the morrow, and then remanded the defendant in error to the guard; and, in about ten days thereafter, the\" witness,- who testified to the above facts, saw the defendant at <em>Adams. ' \u25a0 \u00bf ' </em>- , 1</p>\n<p id=\"A8U\">It is manifest, from the bill of exceptions, that the defendant iti error was brought before the. plaintiff in error, at his own request, and with a view of procuring his enlargement without a trial by a qourt martial; the act, then, of going before -the plaintiff, was for the defendant\u2019s benefit. Had the plaintiff in error been merely passive, and refused to: interfere, it seems'to me impossible to consider him as a <em>tort </em>feasor. It does not appear that the plaintiff in error had the power to appoint a general court martial. A spy can be tried only by a general court martial,,and such courts can be appointed only by a general officer commanding an army, or a colonel commanding a separate department. (Art. 65.) There is no proof that the plaintiff in error was a general officer commanding an army, or a colonel commanding a separate department. Before the plaintiff in error can be implicated for not -making the appointment, the defendant in error was bound to show he was the one or the other. If, however, the plaintiff in error had the power, and neglected to exercise it, the case of <em>Salmon </em>v. Percival, <em>(Cro. Car. </em>196.) is decisive, that c\u00e1se, and not trespass, would be the. proper and only remedy.\" .It comes, then, to this; had the plaintiff in error a legitimate right to discharge the defendant, who had been regularly committed for one of the highest offences, without being \u25a0subjected to a court martial;' and was he bound, upon the mere <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"271\">*271</page-number>allegation of the prisoner himself that he was a citizen, to exercise that power ?</p>\n<p id=\"b281-4\">I doubt very much, whether the power to discharge a person thus committed, without a trial, resides in any officer; it cannot, and ought not, to be inferred from the fact that the plaintiff in error professed his willingness to discharge the defendant, if innocent, nor from the fact that he subsequently discharged him without a trial. It is one thing for an inferior military officer to obey his superior, and it is another, and quite a distinct consideration, whether he was bound to obey. In analogy to proceedings in the civil tribunals, it is very certain, that a person committed by magistrates, charged with an offence, cannot be discharged from custody, and from the offence, without the intervention of a court, and an investigation into the offence before, at least, a grand jury. I cannot but consider the defendant\u2019s discharge as an act of power, exercised gratuitously and mercifully <em>; </em>not an act which could have been required.</p>\n<p id=\"b281-5\">I have already observed that the plaintiff in error, in ordering the defendant to be brought before him, evidently did so at the defendant\u2019s request, and for his benefit; and it appears that the result was, to accelerate the defendant\u2019s discharge from imprisonment : the remanding the defendant, under the circumstances of the case, amounted to no more than a declining to discharge him on his own allegation. This was not a new or distinct commitment. Had the plaintiff in error gone to the provost marshal, and heard the defendant\u2019s allegations, and declined interfering affirmatively, there could be no pretence to charge the plaintiff as a trespasser. l\u2019!he remanding -was, in effect, no more than a refusal, on the part of the plaintiff in error, to interfere at that time. It appears to me most unreasonable, that the defendant in error, at whose request, and for whose benefit, the act of bringing him before the plaintiff was done, shall make that act, and a declining to interfere, upon the mere naked assertion of the defendant, an independent and substantive act of imprisonment.</p>\n<p id=\"b281-6\">What is an officer, circumstanced as the plaintiff in error was, to do ? He finds a man, of whom he knows nothing, charged with an offence, in writing, and under the hands of two of ins officers, with a crime of the most heinous nature, a crime endangering a post of immense importance, a crime punished, as well by our laws as those of every nation, with death: the person thus im<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"272\">*272</page-number>plicated catisWhiip to be discharged from imprisonment, iipoH the allegation'that he is a citizen; the imprisonment is continued, until the commanding officer becomes satisfied that the allegation of citizenship is true, and then: the prisoner is enlarged. I see no fault, no violation of law, nothing unreasonable, in this procedure. <em>1 </em>To .hold, that a commanding officer is- bound to-know the fact of citizenship of every person committed by others as a spy,, and that he must instantly release, him, without an opportunity to make inquiry, and! become satisfied of the: fact, is most unreasonable, and I do not believe it to be law.</p>\n<p id=\"b282-10\">I have met with no case bearing out the court below in con? sidering the plaintiff a trespasser. I am sensible it has been de-c-ided by the Supreme Court of the <em>United States, </em>(3 <em>Cranch, </em>337.) that it is a principle, that the decision of a court martial, in a case clearly without its jurisdiction, Cannot protect the officer who executes it. This I do . not think applies to this case, even if the position was indisputable. To give a court complete jurisdiction, there miist be j\u00farisdiction- as well over the person as the offence, or, as applied to civil proceedings, over \u00a1the cause of action. In <em>Truscott </em>v. <em>Carpenter </em>and <em>Man, </em>(1 Lord <em>Raym. </em>229.) the court held, that neither the officer nor party are bound to take notice whether the cause of action arose out of the jurisdiction of the court ; and they condemned the resolution in the case of the <em>Marshalsea, </em>as a hard one, arid warranted by none df the books; and say, if the cause of action arose opt .of the jurisdiction of the court, the defendant ought to pleadjt;, and, if he does not, the affair of jurisdiction is o ver, and he-shall not take advantage of it in any collateral action against the plaintiff, or the officer who executes the process. The same doctrine will.be found in <em>Lutw. </em>937. 1560. and 1 <em>Freem. </em>322.</p>\n<p id=\"b282-11\">It appears to me, that the case of <em>Olict </em>v. <em>Bessey, </em>(2 Sir T. <em>Jones, </em>214.) has a strong bearing' on - this case. There the plaintiff had been arrested by process, without the jurisdiction of the court; he was.carried within the liberty, and delivered to the defendant, who was a gaoler of the liberty;, and the question was, whether false imprisonment lay.. \u25a0 The court, after many arguments,, held, that the action- did not lie against the gaoler, for he had done no wrong to the party, but that only which belonged to his office, which did'not oblige him to inquire whether the first arrest was tortious or not: even if he had\u2019 been informed of th,e tortious taking, he Ought to\" have detained the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"273\">*273</page-number>prisoner, being delivered to him with a good warrant for the arrest. The plaintiff here, is not strictly in the same situation as the provost marshal, not personally having the custody of the defendant. He had, however, a supervisory power over him; and what would justify the provost marshal for detaining the defendant, would justify him. I again repeat it, the plaintiff in error did not make the arrest, and he was under \u00f1o obligation to discharge the defendant in error, without a trial by a court martial. The commitment by <em>Hopkins </em>and Findley, was a warrant both to the plaintiff in error and the keeper of the provost guard, for his detention. It would, in my judgment, be most irrational and mischievous, that an officer, in the situation of the plaintiff in error, should be bound first to try, and, at his peril, exercise his judgment on the truth of the charge. The principle contended for pushes the absurdity further: the plaintiff in error is not even allowed to inquire Whether the defendant in error was exempted from a trial as a spy, or not, in consequence of his alleged citizenship. I cannot yield my assent to doctrines so unjust and unreasonable ; and am, therefore, of opinion, that the judgment below ought to be reversed, because the court did not allow the evidence offered to be a full justification.</p>\n<p id=\"b283-6\">Platt, J., not having heard the argument of the cause, gave no opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b283-7\">Judgment affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
