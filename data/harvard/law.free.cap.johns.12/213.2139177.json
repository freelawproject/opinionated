The cause was tried at the <em>Orange </em>circuit, in <em>August, </em>1313, before Mr. Justice <em>Yates. </em>The plaintiff gave in evidence <em>a, fi.fa. </em>issued out of this court, in favour of <em>Austin S' Andrews, </em>against <em>William W. Sackctt; </em>and another <em>fi.fa., </em>issued out of the court of common pleas of <em>Orange </em>county, in favour of <em>Edmund Griswoldy </em>against the said <em>Sackctt; </em>and also 1 , - \u2014 . 71 . e/Y&gt; . a deed from <em>Solomon </em>Sleight, shenii for the premises in ques-lion, dated <em>February </em>23, 1313, reciting.that the premises were sold by virtue of the executions. The counsel for the defendant objected that this evidence was not sufficient to entitle the plaintiff to recover; but that he ought also to produce exemplifications of the records of the judgments on which the executions issued; but this objection was overruled by the judge: and the counsel for the defendant excepted to his opinion. The plaintiff proved, that <em>Hasbrouck </em>was in possession in <em>May, </em>1313, and, as he informed the witness, under <em>Sachett.</em></summary>\n<summary data-order=\"3\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b223-15\">The defendant then produced evidence on his part, which he insisted was sufficient to prove the sale by the sheriff to be fraudulent; but the judge, delivered his opinion to the jury, that the evidence adduced by the defendant was not sufficient to impeach the sheriff\u2019s deed, as fraudulent; and that the plaintiff was entitled to recover; and the jury-, accordingly, found a verdict for the plaintiff: and the defendant\u2019s counsel tendered \u25a0\"a bill of exceptions to the opinion of the judge.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b223-16\"><em>H.

J.,</author>\n<p id=\"AV_i\">delivered <em>the opinion of the. </em>court. <em>The \u25a0title </em>upon which the lessors of the plaintiff placed their right to yecover, is made under a sheriff's sale, on executions against <em>William W. Sackett; </em>and the only question made upon the argument of this case, was, whether it was necessary to produce upon the trial the judgments against <em>Sackett, </em>or whether it was sufficient to produce the <em>executions only. I do </em>not find any case in which .this question has been directly decided. But .from the analogy it bears to principles well settled, and as a . safe and proper rule of practice, I think the judgments, as well as the executions, ought to have been proved.</p>\n<p id=\"b224-9\">The defendant was not a party to these judgments, and although it appears, that he held under <em>Sackett, it </em>may well <em>be </em>questioned whether he is to be chargeable with knowledge of the judgments, in the same manner as <em>Sackett </em>himself would be. As against strangers, there are many cases, in. which <em>the </em>execution is not sufficient, even to justify the officer in seizing property. It is a well-settled rule, that in trespass by a stranger against a sheriff, for taking goods under a <em>fi. fa. </em>the sheriff, in order to justify himself, must show the judgment as well as the execution. But if the suit be by the defendant in the execution) the judgment need not be shown, as the party is pre<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"215\">*215</page-number>sumed to be conusant of it. (2 <em>Johns. Rep. </em>46.) As against strangers, the execution, without the judgment, does not show a right to intermeddle with property. And if so with respect to personal property, there can be no good reason why the same rule should not be applied to real property. The occupant cannot bring trespass against the sheriff for levying upon, and selling, the land in his possession, and has no opportunity,therefore, of calling for the authority under which the sale is made, until an ejectment is brought against him to recover the possession. And, according, to the rule laid down in trespass, the execution does- not, of itself, show this authority.</p>\n<p id=\"b225-3\">But admitting the defendant to stand in the same situation as <em>Sackett </em>himself would, I should still think it necessary to prove1 the judgments. A tenant by <em>eleg\u00edt, </em>in order to recover possession of the land extended, must prove the judgment, as well as the <em>elegit. </em>(Buller, 104. 2 <em>Peak. Ev. </em>315.) And in the case' of <em>Carter </em>v. <em>Simpson, (7. </em>Johns. <em>Rep. </em>535.) this court decided) that proof of a purchase of property at a constable\u2019s sale, did not show such an interest in the purchaser as would enable him. to maintain <em>trespass </em>for an injury done to the property* without showing the authority under which the constable acted.- ft is not expressly said, that it was necessary to show the judgment. Though this is fairly to be intended, as the objection upon this* trial was, that'the execution and judgment ought to have been' produced. And if the judgment be necessary for the purpose of showing an interest in the\" purchaser under an execution, to personal property, this necessity is- certainly equally strong with respect to real property. It is, I believe, the general practice,, in cases like the present, to require the production- of the judgment as well as the-execution; and this* is- clearly the safest and best rule. We are accordingly of opinion that a new trial must be awarded, with costs to abide the event of the suit.</p>\n<p id=\"b225-5\">New trial granted.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
