The 8th section of the statute (sess. 32. <em>ch. </em>165.<footnotemark>*</footnotemark>) to organize the militia,- passed-the' 29th <em>March, [1809, </em>declares that the age and ability of any person to bear arms shall be determined by the captain or coitimanding oEcer of the com-pony, with the right, of appeal to the commandant of the regiment. If a person thus enrolled is not; discharged, and can be compelled to do military d\u00fcty, he must be equally liable to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"69\">*69</page-number>military service, when he enters <em>voluntarily. </em>Though the enrolment be erroneous, yet the officer acting under competent legal authority, cannot be liable to an action. This principle is laid down in <em>Wilkins </em>v. <em>Despard,</em><footnotemark><em>*</em></footnotemark><em> </em>and was recognised by Kent, J. in the case of <em>Henderson </em>v. Brown.<footnotemark>\u2020</footnotemark></p>\n<p data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b79-5\">In the present case there was a jurisdiction over the subject matter, and a right of appeal to the party aggrieved.</p>\n<p data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b79-6\">Again, the defendant having <em>voluntarily </em>joined the militia in the service of the <em>United States, </em>he was, <em>in fact, </em>a soldier of the <em>United States, </em>and the iaw of congress on the subject applied to him. He was employed in the service of the <em>United States, </em>and entitled to pay, and subject to the rules and articles of war.</p>\n<p data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b79-12\">The acts of infants are not9 in all cases, void.<footnotemark>\u2021</footnotemark></p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b79-14\"><em>Foot </em>and <em>Paine, </em>contra,</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AqSp\">insisted that the officers of the militia had no jurisdiction or authority whatever over persons under the age of 18 years, or over 45 years. If the defendant in error was not within the laws of this state or of the <em>United States, </em>relative to the militia, the argument on the other side wholly failed. These laws say only that all white mate citizens? above <em>eighteen, </em>and under forty-five years of age, shall be <em>enrolled, See. </em>There is no proof, in this case, that the defendant in error ever was enrolled. How, then, can he be deemed a <em>militia man ? </em>If persons not within the ages defined by the statute, being enrolled, may be subjected to military service, as well <em>may females, </em>who should be enrolled, or who should <em>volunteer, </em>unless they were discharged, or appealed to the commanding officer, be made subject to military duty.</p>\n<p data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b79-15\">Again, the <em>order </em>of the governor was to Captain <em>Lyon\u2019s </em>company, &amp;c.

The term <em>enrolling </em>is merely directory. Such as <em>voluntarily </em>enter the companies of light infantry, &amp;e., belong to the companies, as much as if they had been first enrolled.</p>\n<p data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b80-8\">The 69th section of the militia act authorizes the commandants of companies, when there is an order for a draft from the militia, to accept <em>substitutes </em>in place of the persons drafted.

W. Radcliff, Senator.</author>\n<p id=\"ARJ\">The real question in this cause is not whether an infant under the age of eighteen years,, enrolled in the militia, and neglecting <em>to </em>avail himself of his right to appeal to the commandant of his regiment, is or is not, until such appeal, liable to military service. It does not appear by \u2022the case, hor was it alleged oil the argument, that the defendant ever resided within the bounds of Captain <em>Lyon\u2019s, </em>company, or was even enrolled, or liable to be enrolled, therein. On the contrary, it does distinctly appear that another person belonging to that company, when it was about to march on a tour of duty to the frontiers; applied to this defendant,, and, foria reward stipulated between them, induced, him to agree, with\" the consent of the captain, expressly obtained for that purpose, to take his place in the ranks, as a substitute for the former.. This was the first moment at which he appears to have had any connexion <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"71\">*71</page-number>whatever with the company. The question, therefore, is, whe* ther an infant under the age of twenty-one years (no matter whether under eighteen or not) is bound by his <em>contract </em>to serve as a substitute in a company of militia, ordered out upon public duty.</p>\n<p id=\"b81-4\">The general doctrine, with respect to the liability of infants upon contracts, is perfectly well settled, and universally understood. It is, that no such contract is binding, unless made for necessaries, or authorized by statute. If, indeed, the infant choose to carry it into effect, he shall he permitted to do so, for his own advantage, and while he continues in the execution of it, it shall be deemed a valid performance. But the moment he chooses to recede from it, and acts upon a determination to do so, its obligation ceases, and he is wholly absolved, These principles are applicable here, and are perfectly decisive of the question before the court.</p>\n<p id=\"b81-5\">The defendant having voluntarily marched with the company <em>to </em>the place designated in the orders, the officers under whose command he acted, would, undoubtedly, be held justified for any restraint imposed, or discipline inflicted upon him while he continued in service. But the moment he chose to avail himself of his right to withdraw from that service, their right to control him ceased, and there was an end of the contract. It follows, that the plaintiff, acting under the advertisement of the colonel, could have no right to take him as a deserter, and, consequently, that the decision in the court below was, in all respects,\u2666correct.</p>\n<p id=\"b81-6\">It has been argued ihat the contract was made with the consent and approbation of the father, who even received a part of the consideration for it, and that it is, therefore, to be held obligatory. Put this was not an <em>enlistment </em>unler the laws of congress, allowing in certain cases the enlistment of minors with the consent of their parents, masters, or guardians. It cannot, therefore, be supported on that ground. Nor can the father\u2019s consent, in any view of the case, give it validity, or in any way affect the question. It was still the contract of an <em>infant, </em>and void, because relating to a subject on which he was incapable of binding himself. And even if it could be regarded as a' contract of the father, it would be equally void, as <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"72\">*72</page-number>against the son, and,, therefore, equally unavailing here; a parent having clearly no right to bind his s\u00f3n to <em>military service.</em></p>\n<p id=\"AxE\">The judgment of the court below ought, in my opinion, to b\u00e9 affirmed. ....</p>\n<p id=\"b82-7\">Cochran, J\u00f3n\u00e9s;,,WendEee', and S\u00edeWarv, -'Senators, 'were ' of the same opinion. \u2022 :. \\. , \u25a0\u25a0 ''</p>\n<author id=\"b82-9\">Sanford, Senator.</author>\n<p id=\"Ass\">A person not liable, to military duty, voluntarily enters the 'service, as a soldier, and being actually in, military service, deserts. .
