B. Yates, </em>for the plaintiff.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"Auhf\">The testator devised to his wife, <em>\u201c </em>all his estate, real and personal,\u201d without words denoting an estate of inheritance or fee. These words are to be understood as descriptive pf the things devised, not as denoting. the quantity of interest in the testator.<footnotemark>*</footnotemark></p>\n<p data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"A-5\">Again, the testator, in declaring his intention, in case his wife should die before him, devises all his estate, real and personal, , . . . ' . . 7. ^ r <em>to </em>.ms-'Cnildren, their <em>heirs ana a$s%gn$\u00bf </em>It is evident, that he fully understood the legal operation of those technical words;-. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"391\">*391</page-number>and meaning to give his children a fee; he used them as the apt' and proper words to express that intention. When, therefore, in the preceding part of the \u25a0 same clause, in the devise to his wife, he omits the words heirs and assigns, must we not suppose, that such omission was intenfiot\u00edal and advised, and that he did not mean to give his wife an estate in fee ? To construe the wo'rds, \u201c all my estate,\u201d as carrying an estate in fee, the intention to give such an estate must be clear and apparent.</p>\n<p data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b401-11\">There is no ground to suppose an estate in fee, by <em>implication, </em>from the words, \u201c after paying of my debts and funeral expenses.\u201d To carry a fee by implication, the charge must be on \u2022the <em>person </em>of the devisee, in respect to the estate devised to him.<footnotemark>*</footnotemark></p>\n<p data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b401-12\">The words, \u201c to be at her absolute disposal,\u201d refer to the agreement entered into between the testator and his wife, before their intermarriage. We must, therefore, have recourse to that contract, to aid the construction of these words used in the will. There can be no doubt that a devise may be made to take effect) with reference to another instrument.<footnotemark>\u2020</footnotemark> Now, if we look at the terms of this contract, it is manifest that they give only an estate for life. The object of the parties, was to make a joint fund out of their separate estates, to guard against the contingencies of life, and to be possessed and enjoy ed by the survivor. They do not look beyond the life of the survivor. The terms of the will are then to be restricted to the terms of the agreement. The words, \u201c absolute disposal,\u201d . mean, therefore, nothing more than that the wife, if she survived, should have the sole and exclusive enjoyment of the estate, during her life; unless they give the <em>power </em>also to dispose of the fee, by deed or devise.<footnotemark>\u2021</footnotemark> If she had such a power, she <em>has </em>never executed it.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b401-18\"><em>Sill, </em>contra.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AGRL\">It is much to be regretted, that courts of justice, in the construction of wills, ever abandoned technical rules, to look after the intention of the testator. Courts have said, in the construction of wills, that the intention of the testator is always to govern; yet, afterwards, in certain cases, they say, we have no doubt of the intention; yet, on account of certain technical words used, we cannot carry that intention into effect.</p>\n<p data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b401-19\">1.

Holyday,<footnotemark>*</footnotemark> to be the established principle, that the intention of the testator is to govern, and that it is immaterial what words are made use of, if, by sound construction, the intention to pass a fee is apparent; and that no technical words/ate necessary for that purpose. The testator gives all his estate to his wife, \u201c after payment of his debts and funeral charges.\u201d The estate is -thereby made subject to the payment of debts; and any words, which, according to the <em>English </em>decisions, yrill charge' the estate devised, with payment of debts or legacies, will carry a fee to the devisee, by implication.<footnotemark>\u2020</footnotemark></p>\n<p data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b402-13\">The case of Jacksdn v.

On the contrary, we declared,, in Jackson v. Bull, that it was a correct decision.J,</p>\n<p id=\"b402-15\">It appears to ine~ that the decision in Jackson v. Bull is not founded in principle. A fee is claimed, by implication, oa the ground that the testator meant to benefit the d\u00e8visee~ by the devise of the estate to. him~ Now, the devise~, whether the charg~ is personal, or, on the estate devised~ stands on no better or different ground ; it cannot be that he is bound to pay the debts and legacies, at all events, or beyond the estate devised ; for the devisee is not chargeabie beyond the estate devised t&amp; him.<footnotemark>\u01c0\u01c0</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b402-16\">2. The iestator gives. all his estate to his wife. \"to be at her abs~lute disposal, according to an agreement,\" &amp;c. Th~ word, \" estate,\" ~in1ess restrained by other words, will carry a fee.<footnotemark>**</footnotemark> But it is said, that by referring to the marriage articles, that ii~strurnent must govern, in ascertaining the intention of the testator. The testator \u00f1rst uses words in his will, which carry a fee, and then refers to the agreement made before marriage, without expressing what his intention was,- in those articles. That agreement cannot restrain, or abridge, the meaning of the words first used in the will, especially when the testator was an unlearned person. The words, \u201c to be at her absolute disposal,\u201d further show the intention to give a fee. \u2022 In <em>Jackson, </em>ex dem. Bush, v. Coleman,<footnotemark>\u2020\u2020</footnotemark> the testator gave to his wife, \"the use of all his real and personal estate, to use and dispose of at her pleasure,\u201d it was held, that the wife took an estate in fee.</p>\n<p id=\"b403-2\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"393\">*393</page-number>Again, the testator does not devise over his estate, in case his wife should survive him, but only in case she should die before him. His giving small legacies to each of his children, shows, also, an intention to disinherit them. As to the marriage articles, there can be little doubt that the intention of the parties was to create a joint estate, the whole of which should go to the survivor.</p>\n<author id=\"b403-3\">Platt, J.,</author>\n<p id=\"APHg\">delivered the opinion of the court. The only question is, whether <em>Mary, </em>the widow of <em>John Herrick, </em>sen., took an <em>estate for life, </em>or an estate <em>in fee, </em>under the will of her husband.</p>\n<p id=\"b403-4\">It is an established rule, that no <em>technical words </em>are necessary to devise a fee, and that the <em>intention </em>of the testator, to be cob lected from the whole will, is to govern ; but the phraseology and combinations of words used in wills, are infinitely various,, and, therefore, the application of any general rule is often very difficult.</p>\n<p id=\"b403-5\">The words used by the testator in this case are these: \u201c I give, bequeath, and devise unto my wife <em>Mary, </em>after payment of my debts and funeral charges, all my estate, both real and personal, that I may be in possession of at my decease, to be at her absolute disposal, according to an agreement made with her on\" the 27th day of <em>October', </em>1802.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b403-6\">I see no ground to contend that this devise falls within that class of cases which give a fee <em>by implication, </em>where the payment of debts is charged upon the <em>devisee personally, </em>or <em>specif * cally upon the land devised.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b403-7\">The intention, here, is clear, that the <em>residue </em>of the estate should go to the wife, after the debts and funeral charges were paid from the funds which the law provides; not that the1 whole estate should vest in the wife, subject to the payment of debts, as a condition of the devise. This doctrine is well examined, and most of the leading cases on this point are ably reviewed', in the case of <em>Jackson, </em>ex dem. <em>Townsend, </em>v. <em>Bull. </em>(10 <em>Johns. Rep. </em>148.)</p>\n<p id=\"b403-9\">The words <em>\u201c all my estate, both real and </em>personal,\u201d \u201c <em>to be at her absolute </em>disposal,\u201d are, undoubtedly, sufficient to vest <em>cs </em>fee,\u2022 unless those words are controlled and limited by the terms sf the written agreement to which the will expressly refers. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"394\">*394</page-number><em>(Jackson, </em>ex dem. <em>Bush, </em>v. <em>Coleman, </em>2 <em>Johns. Rep. </em>391. and. the cases there cited.)</p>\n<p id=\"b404-3\">There is no question that, <em>since </em>the statute of wills, as well as <em>before, </em>a will may be construed in connexion with another instrument of writing, to which it refers. <em>(Powell on </em>Devises, 22. 49. 52.) Hence it becomes - necessary to examine the \u2022marriage articles, in order to determine the question before us. It is inferrible, from that agreement, that the husband acquired property in right of his wife, 'and that they both contributed to the joint fund. What was the original proportion of each, does not appear. It may be, that the fund was composed <em>chiefly </em>of the property of th\u00e9 Wife.</p>\n<p id=\"b404-4\">The husband may, therefore, have obeyed a good conscience, in disinheriting his children in favour of his widow; arid I see nothing in the <em>agreement </em>to control the words in the <em>will. </em>When the agreement was made, the parties could not foresee whether the joint fund would consist of <em>real </em>or <em>personal </em>estate, when the event of survivorship should occur; they, therefore, say, \u201c the survivor shall <em>possess </em>and <em>enjoy </em>the <em>whole </em>of such joint property.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b404-5\">When the will was made, the testator spoke with reference to the actual condition of the' fund at that time ; and he thereby devises to his wife \u201c <em>all his estate, both real and personal,\u201d </em>\u201c <em>to be at her absolute disposal, according to the agreement,\u201d </em>&amp;c&lt; By the Will, the testator shows that, he understood and intended that the agreement was to give the full and complete benefit of survivorship in all his real and personal estate. The agreement and the will appear to me to be perfectly consistent; and thb words <em>ie </em>all my real estate, at her absolute disposal,\u201d are sufficient to carry a fee.</p>\n<p id=\"b404-6\">It is said by the counsel for the plaintiff, that, in using the Words \u201c <em>heirs and </em>assigns,\u201d in the devise to his children, the testator shows that he understood' the meaning and effect of those Words; and' that, in using other words in the devise to his wife, he manifests an intention not to give a fee.</p>\n<p id=\"b404-7\">I think this weighs but little in judging of the testator\u2019s intention ; for, although the word <em>heirs </em>is the most apt, it is not the <em>only </em>word to devise a fee.</p>\n<p id=\"b404-8\">The contingent devise to the children seems to me to afford a strong inference in favour of the widow\u2019s claim to the fee.</p>\n<p id=\"b404-9\">The testator says, \u201c It is my intention, that <em>if my said wife </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"395\">*395</page-number><em>shall decease before me, </em>that my real and personal estate shall b.e equally divided among my children, and their heirs and - assigns.\u201d Now, if he intended that his- wife should have only a life estate in the event of her surviving him, why did he not limit the remainder to his children ? It is true, his children would take, as heirs, the same estate which such a limitation would give them; but it is equally true, that the contingent de-. vise to them, on the event that his wife should die before him, was also inoperative and- superfluous. If the widow has not &lt;z <em>fee, </em>then the remainder, after her life-estate, is <em>undisposed of </em>by .the will; and <em>quoad hoc, </em>the testatorJias died <em>intestate. </em>Such a construction would defeat the intention of the testator.</p>\n<p id=\"b405-3\">In my opinion, therefore, the case shows a title out of the lessors of the plaintiff; and the defendant is entitled to judgr jnent.</p>\n<p id=\"b405-4\">Judgment for the defendant,</p>\n<footnote label=\"\u01c0\u01c0\">\n<p id=\"b402-26\"> 1 N.
