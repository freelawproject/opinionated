Why are the courts in <em>Ireland </em>and <em>Scotland </em>regarded as foreign ? It is: not 'because' they are transmarine, but because ' they are out of the jurisdiction of <em>England. </em>There is no relation between the jurisdiction of any court in this state and the circuit court of the <em>United States </em>in-the <em>Virginia </em>district. They are totally distinct and independent tribunals, in distinct and independent jurisdictions.

' To say that the proceedings Of a court under the government of the <em>United' [States, </em>could, in.any respect, be received and treated like those \u25a0 of a - foreign tribunal,' by \u00e1 court of. One of these states, would seem to involve dti absurdity. The present; however, is such a case, and, at the game time, it is ,perfectly, reasonable that jurisdiction should be retained,, to avoid the embarrassments which would inevitably ensue, if proceedings in the circuit court of the <em>United States </em>could arrest the progress-of a suit brought in this court*. \u2022</p>\n<p id=\"b110-9\">From the peculiar organization of the government of the <em>'United States, </em>composed of several independent sovereignties, associated for purposes specified in . the general compact, it is not at all surprising, that in exercising conc\u00fcrrent,powers; questions: should be: presented perfectly new,, and; of course, not sus*, ceptibie <em>of </em>elucidation by cases in the books, exactly analo- - gous. ,. _ ..; . s .. \u25a0</p>\n<p id=\"ARqe\">, F\u00f3r a correct decision of .those questions, therefore, principles in some measure applicable to each particular case must be resorted to. . .</p>\n<p id=\"b110-11\">The rul\u00e9 in the <em>English </em>courts is, that the pendency of a suit in \u00e1 foreign court, .by the sam\u00e9 plaintiff against the same 'defendant, for the sain\u00e9 cause of action, is n\u00f3 stay , \u00f3r bar. t\u00f3 a suit instituted in one of their courts. It is the definitive judgment, on the merits only which is by. them considered conclusive, azzd' we have frequently declared <em>so </em>as to suits instituted is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"101\">*101</page-number>the courts of our sister states. The reasons assigned by this court, in the case of <em>Bowne &amp; Seymour </em>v. <em>Joy, </em>(9 <em>Johns. Rep. </em>221.) appear to me to be perfectly satisfactory. Those reasons are, that the judgment, at least, if not- a recovery in one suit, might be pleaded <em>puis darrein continuance </em>to the other suit, and. if the two suits should even proceed, <em>pari passu, to </em>judgment and execution, a satisfaction of either judgment might be shown upon <em>audita querela, </em>or otherwise, in discharge of the other.</p>\n<p id=\"b111-4\">This court has no greater connexion or interference with the court of the <em>United States </em>for the fifth circuit and <em>Virginia </em>district, than it has with any of the other state courts. The same principles, consequently, are applicable, and may be urged with equal propriety, in favour of retaining jurisdiction here. They are tribunals, in this respect, as independent of each other as they are of foreign courts.</p>\n<p id=\"b111-6\">The case of <em>Imlay </em>v. <em>Ellefsin, </em>(2 <em>East, 453.) </em>relied on by the defendant\u2019s counsel, does not interfere with this doctrine, nor is it applicable to the present case. That was an application to the discretion of the court; the defendant, by leave of a judge at his chambers, was .holden to special bail on an affidavit made, and in support of a rule to discharge the defendant on common bail, a counter affidavit was received to show that he had before been holden to bail in <em>Norway. </em>The rule was refused, and Lord <em>Ellenborough, </em>iii giving the opinion of the court, says, \u201c The question here is, whether we have presented to us, with sufficient distinctness, that the defendant stands in the situation of having been holden to bail in <em>Norway, </em>so that the plaintiff has the same security for his demand, and might have all the benefit of prosecuting his suit there, which he has here.\u201d The court of K. B. not knowing what the laws of Nor<em>way were, </em>in. that respect, did not feel themselves warranted to take from the plaintiff the benefit he was entitled to from their laws.</p>\n<p id=\"AP7\">There is a manifest distinction between an application to be discharged on common bail, which (if granted) would not arrest further proceedings-in the cause, or a plea like the present, going to destroy the remedy in this court altogether, or, at least, during the pendency of another action in a foreign court. The former is a decision resting in the discretion of the court, who might, with propriety, advert to equitable circumstances in their <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"102\">*102</page-number>determination. But a question, like the present, not resting in discretion, and involving the jurisdiction of the court, the law appears to me to be too explicit to be misunderstood. -Nor can I perceive that the principles laid down by Lord <em>Fllenborough, </em>on a motion for a discharge on common bail, are at all applicable. The plea, in this instance, is bad, and there must be judgment of <em>respondeas </em>ouster.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
