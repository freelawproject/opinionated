There is an apparent contradiction between the case of <em>Jackson </em>v. <em>Stanley, </em>and the decision of the court in the case of <em>Jackson, ex dem Mancius, </em>v. <em>Lawton,</em><footnotemark><em>\u2020</em></footnotemark><em> </em>which contains the true doctrine on this subject, that the only way of avoiding a patent is by <em>scire facias, </em>or process in chancery. In the former case, <em>Kent, </em>Ch. J., to show that the difference in the Christian, name of the patentee being a latent ambiguity, extrinsic. evidence might be resorted to, to explain the mistake, relies on cases decided in regard to wills or devises. Without adverting to the difference between a <em>will </em>and a <em>patent, </em>we contend, that the cases cited would not authorize an alteration in a will, like the one contended for in the present case, and are, therefore, not applicable. They are two classes of cases : \u25a0, , ,</p>\n<p data-order=\"22\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b89-8\">1. Where there are two persons of the\" same name ; and,</p>\n<p data-order=\"23\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b89-9\">2. Where, for greater certainty,\"the description of the person controls, and the name is rejected.</p>\n<p data-order=\"24\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b89-10\">In class the first, are the cases in 5 <em>Co. </em>68., 2 <em>Atk. 373. </em>239., and 3 <em>Atk. </em>258. In the second class of cases, are to be found 6 <em>Term Rep. 671. </em>2 <em>Vesey, </em>216. 2 <em>Equ. Cas. Abr. </em>245. <em>Ambler, 175.</em></p>\n<p data-order=\"25\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b89-12\">There is another class of cases, where a person has a nickname, or name by reputation, where the party may plead that he is as well known by that as by his true name.<footnotemark>\u2021</footnotemark> The two classes of cases are perfectly reconcilable with the statute of frauds. They do not contradict the will. The attempt, in the present case, is not to explain or to render the description of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"80\">*80</page-number>the person certain,' but to,.substitute1 a new and \u00e1 different' \u25a0 naine.</p>\n<p data-order=\"26\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"A62\">Great latitude has. been allowed as to letting in evidence, in'\" regard to wills, so as to effectuate the <em>intent </em>of the testator.' But, in regard to <em>patents, </em>it-is presumed that the \u2019court would hardly go the same length, especially when 'the impolicy and dangerous tendency,: of admitting paroi evidence to explain \u2022 written instruments is generally acknowledged. \" ff.\"</p>\n<p data-order=\"27\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b90-7\">\u00c1s to. the admissibility'of the <em>books, </em>of the commissioners of' the land-office;: no doubt,' that' the' death of a person may be' proved in a court b'y <em>hearsay </em>testimony, orTy registers kept' b'y: persons appointed to r\u00e9cord births' and deaths'. \u2019. But, where hekrsay evidence is given, the other'party has a right to cross*\u2019 /examine.' The'commissioners' of the land.ofB.ee were .not a \" <em>/Court,, </em>nor were they directed or authorized to keCp siiph <em>books; </em>which cannot, therefore, be .evideWe -of themsely'esff The* coihmissioners had no power to decide'on\u2019th\u00e9 fact' of the death ' of the soldier, nor\u2019did they pretend i\u00f3 exercise any such powers:; for they granted patents indiscriminately \u2018 to all whom they supposed entitled to lands, without inquiry into the fact of their being alive or dead. These ballot books ar\u00e9 extremely loose. \u00e1nd inaccurate, and ndt entitled to the distinction of being re - ceived: as. evidence. ' , i. .\u2022 - \u2022\u25a0 .- \u2022 \" '</p>\n<p data-order=\"28\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b90-9\">Again, it is said that <em>Houseman </em>could not take the land grant-\u2019 ed, because'he was not a soldier in \u2019 the <em>line </em>\"of the army;' Bufc\u2019U if the patent is conclusive as to the. nkme or person \u2019of the patentee, it is equally so as to this point. Besides, this is a question which cannot \"be examined' in-this action. If the legislature, who ar\u00e9 the sole dispensers of their own bounty, have : thought proper togrant land' to any person, his title under the-; patent 'cannot be disturbed, as long \u00e1s the patent remains in-force. If his title' is to be impeached, the;patent must be avoided by a <em>scire facias, </em>or a suit in ecpiity. . \u25a0 \u2022 - - '</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"29\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b90-11\"><em>Henry, </em>in reply.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"30\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AxR5\">We\u2019 do not mean to contend-that\u2019 it is com-potent to show, by <em>paroi, </em>that the f\u00edame of the patentee is mistaken. The \"\u2022 question is, whether.! the patent'is not' Void, on the ground that- there was\" no such'person as the one named in the patent, in existence, at the time, capable of taking,'or,!ih,other words, that the patentee is a nonentity; for ho W is a <em>scire fa* cias </em>to issue to, or a bill i-n chancery be' filed against, amonen<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"81\">*81</page-number>fcity? We had only to prove the fact of non-existence. We offered to show that there never was a person of the name of <em>George Houseman </em>in the line of the army, or any person in existence to whom the patent in question could issue.</p>\n<p data-order=\"31\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b91-3\">Though the acts of the commissioners were not judicial, they were of that nature as rendered them, of necessity, evidence. Though a person was a soldier in the line of the army, it did not follow, of course, that he was entitled to the bounty-land, for he may have been a deserter. The commissioners having power to determine or designate the persons entitled to these bounty lands, must necessarily have the power to decide on the Identity of the person. The description or designation of the person entitled, was the <em>substratum </em>of the grant, for without such a designation of the person, no patent could issue. Suppose there had been two persons of the name of <em>George Houseman, </em>one alive and the other dead, the commissioners must have described the persons of each, and th\u00e9 particular lot of land to which each was entitled. And this description or designation of the persons would, necessarily, be evidence, otherwise, it could not be known to which of the two lots they were respectively entitled.</p>\n<p data-order=\"32\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b91-4\">No doubt, that where a patent can be repealed, the proper course is to issue a <em>scire facias </em>for the purpose. But where a patent has issued to a person not in being, it is, <em>ipso facto, </em>null and void. There is no need of any process to repeal it.</p>\n<footnote data-order=\"33\" data-type=\"footnote\" id=\"x999-1\" label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"pAV-\"><em> See Jackson, ex dem.

The ground: of that decision seems to be, that \u201c the omission or mistake of the <em>Christian </em>name of the grantee, rendered \u00a1the grant void.\u2019 -;- <em>(Humble </em>v. <em>Glover, Cro.

' f-.v-</p>\n<p id=\"b93-2\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"83\">*83</page-number>I think the old remedy of summoning the patentee before a <em>judicial tribunal, </em>for the direct and express purpose of showing cause why the grant should not be vacated, on the ground of fraud or mistake, is wisest and safest, if not the only constitutional mode of vacating such a grant. But whether the .legislature can dispense with all the forms of judicial proceedings, and <em>arbitrarily, </em>upon an <em>ex parte </em>application, defeat a patent by a legislative act, need not to be considered in this cas\u00e9, because the legislature have not attempted to assert the right of the state in. that mode. If, however, this case is not distinguishable, in its essential features, from the case of <em>Jackson </em>v. <em>Stanley, </em>(10 <em>Johns. Rep. </em>133.) 1 repose myself with entire satisfaction on the unanimous decision of this court, in the case of <em>Jackson, ex dem. Mancius, </em>v. Lawton, (10 <em>Johns. Rep. </em>23.) and the author!-' ties there cited. In that case-, the plaintiff claimed under a patent to <em>George </em>Mancius, for lot No. 128, in the <em>East Cayuga </em>reservation, dated the 28th of <em>October, </em>1811, The defendant, <em>Lawton, </em>offered to give in evidence a patent to <em>Stephen </em>Allen, for the same lot, bearing date the 5th of <em>March, </em>1312, and also offered to prove that <em>Allen </em>was the occupant of the land, having, by law, the preemptive right; that he had paid the appraised valu\u00e9 of the land, with interest, to the state; and that the first patent (to <em>Mancius) </em>was issued by mistake, which evidence was overruled at the trial, and this court sanctioned that decision. Chief Justice <em>Kent, </em>in delivering the opinion, of the court in that case, says, \u201c The patent granted to the lessors of the plaintiff being the elder patent, is the highest evidence of title. As long as it remains in force, it is conclusive as against a junior patent.\u201d \u201c Nor can the court take notice of any equitable claim upon the gov\u00e9rnment which a third person might have had in respect to the lands in question.\u201d \u201cIf the elder patent was issued by mistake, or upon false suggestions, it is <em>voidable only; </em>and unless letters pat\u00e9pt are absolutely void on the face- of them, or the issuing them was without authority, or was prohibited by statute, they can only be avoided in a regular course of pleading, in which the fraud, irregularity, or mistake, is directly put in issue.\u201d \u201c The regular tribunal for this purpose, is chancery, founded on a proceeding by <em>scire facias, </em>or by bill or information: It would be against precedent, and of dangerous consequences to titles; to permit letters patent (which <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"84\">*84</page-number>%e solemn grants of record) to be impeached collaterally; by <em>paroi </em>proof, in this action.\u2019\u2019 : \u25a0\u2019</p>\n<p id=\"Ac3\">\u2018 The rule is indisputable, that paroi, evidence cannot be received to contradict or vary a written instrument, of clear, certain, and unequivocal import. \u00c1 <em>latent ambiguity </em>may be explained by paroi proof, in order to elucidate and explain written words of doubtful sense ; as if a grant be made to <em>John Smith, </em>arid there be several persons of that name, paroi evidence is admissible, to explain which of the persons bearing the same name was intended. So, paroi evidence would be admissible to prove, that <em>George Houseman </em>and <em>George Hosmer kre </em>the same person. But ccrtainly.it is not explaining a latent ambiguity, to prove that a grant to <em>George Houseman, </em>a. real person, was intended for another person of the'name of <em>George Hosmer. </em>Such an extension of the rule would destroy 'the security of written conveyances, If a different person may be substituted by paroi proof, for the person certainly described as grantee in a deed, .there is no other essential part of the deed which might not be altered in the sain\u00e9 way. Such a relaxation in the established rules of evidence, would defeat the spirit arid policy of the statute of frauds, which requires; conveyances of land to tie in writing. Arid <em>oui \"bona? </em>It is not contended that <em>this </em>patent enures to the benefit of <em>George </em>Hosmer. The defendant is confessedly without any title to the land in question. To impeach <em>st </em>public grant' of record, m-'this collateral manner, operates as afi unfair-surprise \u00fcpoh the patentee; it would supersede and abolish the safe and easy remedy by <em>scire faciasl </em>which is sanctioned by the wisdom and experience of 'ages) and,, in my judgrnent, it would be a dangerous innovation) \u25a0 ' .</p>\n<p id=\"b94-7\">I am, therefore, of opinion, that the plaintiff is entitled t&amp; judgment..'

J.</author>\n<p id=\"ApN\">The \u2018defendant7 is-in possession under a title derived from <em>George Hosmer, </em>and-is not, therefore,, to be <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"85\">*85</page-number>considered as standing on the footing of a mere naked oeeupant. And if the evidence on his part was admissible, it would show, conclusively, not only that <em>George Houseman, </em>who claims to be the patentee, was not the person intended, but that <em>George Hosmer </em>was the real patentee. It is not necessary, to establish the latter branch of the alternative; for. the defendant may rest his defence upon showing a title out of the lessor of the plaintiff; and if he can show that the patent was void, or that the person who claims to be the patentee was not the person intended, it will be sufficient. v</p>\n<p id=\"b95-3\">The evidence offered was not for the purpose of contradicting the patent, but to explain a latent ambiguity, and identify the patentee. It is admitted that the premises are a part of the land set apart as bounty lands for the two regiments belonging to this state; and it. was not pretended, in the .argument, this <em>George Houseman, </em>came within , this description of persons. Had the patent described the patentee, as a soldier in Captain <em>Wendell\u2019s </em>company, in the first regiment, it would have been necessary for <em>Houseman </em>to have proved that he answered that description, \u25a0 although it would have been extrinsic evidence. And when the patent is silent as to description of the patentee, I can see no objection to the admission of extrinsic evidence to identify the patentee, any more than there, would be to testimony to identify and locate the land granted. This is not evidence repugnant to or contradicting the patent. \u00d1or is it, in fact, evidence which is necessarily to make void the patent, but only shows, that he who sets himself up as the paten tee .'is aft impostor. Can it be, that any man. has a right to go to the secretary\u2019s office* and if he can find a patent issued to a person of the same name which he bears, that he can avail himself of such patent, and that his identity is not to be questioned? It is perfectly immaterial whether the opposition to his claim comes from one of the same name with the patentee, or from any other person who has a'right to dispute his title; and that the defendant in ejectment has a right to show that the plaintiff has no title, cannot be denied.</p>\n<p id=\"b95-7\">Suppose it could have been shown that <em>George </em>Houseman, who claims the benefit of this patent, was <em>a. British </em>soldier during the whole revolutionary war, might not this have been done? That may be said to be an extreme case. But if the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"86\">*86</page-number>principle be sound upon which the testimony offered was. re-* jected, it would apply to the case I have put. For it would he nothing more than inquiring whether the lessor of the plaintiff was, in fact and in truth, the patentee, or person he pretended to be. - 1</p>\n<p id=\"AOO\">From the best-consideration which I have been able to give this case, ! cannot take it out of the principles which governed the decision in <em>Jackson </em>v. <em>Stanley, </em>(10 <em>Johns. Rep. </em>136.) The defendant there claimed title under <em>David Hungerford, </em>being the name of th$ patentee. But upon the trial evidence was admitted to show that it Was not <em>David Hungerford who </em>was intended as the <em>patentee; </em>and the competency of such evidence was sanctioned by the opinion of the whole court. Indeed, the very same evidence, to wit, the balloting book, which was decided in that case to be good evidence, has been here rejected. This evidence was admitted in that case for the express purpose of showing that the patent was void, because there was no such person as <em>David </em>Hungerford, who was entitled\" to military lands, but that <em>Daniel Hungerford </em>was the person' really intended. If this was not the principle which governed that case, I know not . upon, what ground, the plaintiff could recover. If, under the patent, the title- was. vested in <em>David Hungerford, </em>it- was not, nor could be, pretended that-the\" legislature could devest him of his title, and give it to <em>Daniel Hungerford, </em>the person really intended: as the patentee. The patent to <em>David must </em>first be got rid \"of, before the act of the legislature could take effect, and so it was considered\" by the court. Notwithstanding there was a person;'of the same name with the patentee:, who claimed title to the land, the court said the patent was void, because he was not the person intended, and that it was competent <em>to </em>show this by paroi\u25a0 evidence;. and if such evidence is admissible, that which was offered in the case now before us was conclusive to show that <em>George Houseman </em>was not the person intended as patentee. We'must, at all events, for the purposes of the present motion, assume that the proof would have established that fact.</p>\n<p id=\"b96-7\">I am persuaded, that no solid distinction can, in principle, be made between this case and that of <em>Jackson </em>v. <em>Stanley. </em>The-great question, -in both cases, is whether /jarof evidence-is ad-, missible to show that the person claiming to be the patentee <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"87\">*87</page-number>was not the person intended. If there be any substantial difference in the two cases, it is much in favour of the defendant in this case; because, the mistake there was in <em>the Christian </em>name, and it was admitted, on all hands, that <em>Daniel Hungerford, </em>who was the person really intended* could not take under that patent. But in the present case, the mistake is in the <em>surname, </em>and it may well be questioned whether <em>George Hosmer </em>inay not hold the'title under this patent. The law knows only of one Christian name, but a person may have divers surnames, and it would have been competent for the defendant to have shown that <em>George Hosmer </em>was known also by the name of <em>George Houseman. </em>(5 <em>Johns. Rep. </em>84. <em>Co. Lit. </em>3. a. 15 <em>Vin. </em>tit. <em>Misnomer, C. </em>5, 6. 413.) And it is expressly laid down as a rule on this subject, that in grants and obligations the mistake of the <em>surname </em>doth hot vitiate, because there is no repugnancy that a person should have two surnames. It is, however, unnecessary to say that the title vested in <em>George Hosmer; </em>it is sufficient for the defendant to show that it did not vest in <em>George Houseman; </em>and that the testimony offered, to establish that fact, was admissible, is, in my opinion, settled in the case of <em>Jackson </em>v. <em>Stanley. </em>I ain, accordingly, of opinion that a new trial ought to be granted.</p>\n<p id=\"b97-6\">Judgment for the plaintiff.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
