The letter delivered to the defendant did hot amount to a demand-; and if it did, it does not appear what answer was given. The refusal must be express and positive, to be evidence of a conversion. The trustee was not bound to' seek the plaintiff, and deliver him-the papers.

By the assignment of the bond: to the plaintiff, by the obligee, \"he acquired an interest in- it, which courts of law will protect; \u25a0and it is no answer to this action, to say, that the plaintiff might have sued directly on the bond, in the name of the obligee, or proceeded in equity for a specific performance. We are-to presume that the plaintiff had done every thing to. entitle himself to the deed, conditioned to be given, as the evidence to sustain the \"action and to prove the damages was overruled. . If the plaint .tiff became entitled to a performance of the condition, tfyp <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"488\">*488</page-number>damages sustained would be the value of the land. \u25a0 The ncirH suit,/therefore, must- be set aside.</p>\n<p id=\"A9iC\">As to the lease, the' conversion of .which form's a part of the .plaintiff\u2019s cause of .action,: it is proper to dispose of that also. From the plaintiff\u2019s, own showing, it was executed by him and the. defendant, .as the attorney to- <em>Kelchum, </em>wko confessedly \u25a0 owned one ..half of the demised premises,- as joint lessor to <em>Stoxcr.. </em>The defendant was not'bound, in this action, to .show his authority feomkre\u00ede\u00c1MW ;t(D: execute\" the lease in his behalf.
