A demand of payment of <em>Ryan, </em>on the 30th of <em>March, </em>1811, and refusal, and notice ..* . <em>tt </em>- 7 J thereof to <em>Herrick, </em>was proved.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"3\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"AaE\"><em>Ryan </em>applied to <em>Lawrence Carman Sr Co. </em>for the purchase of goods, which they refused to sell to him, without security for the payment. <em>Ryan, </em>afterwards, presented them the note in question, endorsed by the defendant, which they accepted, and delivered the goods to the amount of the note. <em>Ryan, </em>soon after, became bankrupt, and <em>Lawrence Carman Sr Co. </em>were in- . formed, that, to render the defendant liable to them, as an endorser, it was necessary that they, the payees, should previously endorse the note. They, accordingly, endorsed the note, and sold it to the plaintiff for 100 dollars, to whom they, at the time, communicated all the circumstances attending the note, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"160\">*160</page-number>as to the consideration, making, and endorsing thereof; and the \u00abdefendant agreed to take the note at his own risk,</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"AnCl\">The. suit, was .brought solely for the benefit of the plaintiff who never made any demand on <em>Lawrence Carman Sr Co,, not </em>gav-e them any notice of the. non-payment by <em>Ryan. . </em>The jury, under the direction of the court below, found a. verdict for the plaintiff, for the amount of the not\u00e9, with interest.

It does not appear that the plaintiff in-error endorsed the note for the purpose of giving <em>Ryan </em>credit xvith <em>L, Carman Sr Co., </em>or that he xvas in' anyxvise informed of the use to xvhich <em>Ryan </em>meant to apply the note. In the absence of any-proof to the contrary, xve must intend that <em>Herrick </em>meant only to become the second endorser, xvith all the rights incident to that situation, The fact of bis endorsing first, in point of time, can have no influ<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"161\">*161</page-number>ence&gt; for he must have known, and we are to presume he acted on that knowledge, that though the first to endorse, his endorsement would be nugatory, unless preceded-by that of the payees of the note,</p>\n<p id=\"b171-4\">Since the case of <em>Russell </em>v. <em>Langstaffe, (Doug. </em>514.) it is not to be doubted, that the endorsement of a blank note is a letter of credit for an indefinite sum; but the present is not that case. There can be no doubt, here, but that the note was filled up when it was endorsed by the plaintiff in error. Had it appeared that the plaintiff endorsed the note'for the purpose of giving <em>Ryan </em>credit with <em>Lawrence Carman &amp; Co., </em>then I should have considered him liable to them, or any subsequent endorser, and the plaintiff\u2019s endorsement might have been converted into a guaranty to pay the note, if <em>Ryan </em>did not, according to the decision of the supreme judicial court in <em>Massachusetts. </em>(3 <em>Mass. Rep. </em>274.) Under such a state of facts, there would be t),o objection to the right of the defendant in error to recover, as the endorser of <em>Herrick. </em>In <em>Bishop </em>v. <em>Hayward, </em>(4 <em>Term Rep. </em>470.) Lord <em>Kenyon </em>impliedly admits that there may be Circumstances under which a prior endorser \"may recover against a subsequent one.</p>\n<p id=\"b171-6\">We have already decided, that the payees of this note could not, directly or indirectly, recover on it, (10 <em>Johns. Rep. </em>224.) .and that decision is supported by the case of <em>Bishop </em>v. <em>Haywar</em>d.</p>\n<p id=\"b171-8\">' The defendant in error, having purchased this not.e at a discount, and with full knowledge of the facts, has virtually agreed not to resort to <em>Lawrence Carman &amp; Co. </em>in <em>any event; </em>and yet, if he can sustain this suit, he will, in effect, violate the agreement under which he became the purchaser of the note; because, upon this evidence, <em>Herrick, </em>if obliged, to pay, would have his remedy over against <em>Lawrence Carman &amp; Co.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b171-9\">The defendant does not stand before the court with the title or character \u00f3f a fair, <em>bona fide, </em>endorsee of a note, in the usual course of trade ; but rather in the light of a speculator, attempting, under the specious character of an endorsee, to recover a sum of money, to which those from whom he derives his title had, with his full knowledge,, no right. It may be <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"162\">*162</page-number>regarded as a general rule, that when an endorser cannot recover against a subsequent endorser,' no person acquiring a title under such prior endorser, and acquainted with all the facts, shall be allowed to recoven</p>\n<p id=\"b172-4\">Judgment reversed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
