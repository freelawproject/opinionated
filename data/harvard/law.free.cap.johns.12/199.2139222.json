It was proved by a surveyor, that the tract of land originally claimed fey <em>Cornelius Hornbeck, </em>under the deed from the trustees of <em>Rochester, </em>would include about 50,000 acres; and, as since set-tied along the line of a deed to one <em>Louw\u00a1 </em>who also claimed under the trustees of <em>Rochester, </em>about 30,000 acres.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"AsdB\">The defendant proved that he held his farm under <em>Lorntfs </em>deed. The defendant then gave, in evidence the patent of <em>Rochester, </em>dated the 25th <em>June, </em>1703. It was admitted that there had been a regular succession of trustees, by election and com veyance, as mentioned in the patent, from that day to the present, and that the trustees for the time being, transferred the property to their successors by deed, reciting the patent, and under the same trusts, Sc. That the defendant, at the time of the alleged trespass, was, and had been for 11 years before, a freeholder and inhabitant within the patent of <em>Rochester; </em>that the wood cut was for the necessary firewood of the defendant and his family, and was used by him as such on his farm. The defendant also proved by the book of minutes, kept by the trustees of <em>Rochester, </em>that all the lands were to be granted, with a re-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"200\">*200</page-number>serration of a right to the freeholders and inhabitants of tie' town of <em>Rochester, to </em>cut and carry away wood on lands not enclosed: and it was admitted that the <em>locus in quo </em>was not enclosed, or in fence.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b210-4\">A verdict was .taken, by consent, for the plaintiffs, for fen dollars, subject to the opinion of the court, on a case to be made: and it was agreed, that if <em>the </em>court should be of opini\u00f3n that the plaintiffs were entitled to recover, the verdict should stand ; but if the court were of opinion that the defendant had made out a justification for cutting necessary firewood, the verdict was to be set aside, and a new trial granted, with costs to abide the event of the suit; or' if the court should be of opinion against the defendant, he should be at-liberty to turn the case into a special verdict.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"Avi\"><em>Sudam, </em>for the defendant,</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"A2q6\">contended that the <em>proviso </em>in the deed from the trustees of the town of <em>Rochester, </em>operated as a covenant, running with the land in favour of the <em>cestui que trusts? </em>who were the freeholders and inhabitants \u00f3f Rochester.<footnotemark>*</footnotemark> It could not be made to them, but was. made to the trustees for their benefit. It may be considered as a covenant running with the <em>tend, or as </em>condition* or exception, or reservation, as might be m\u00b0st consonant to the intention of the parties.<footnotemark>\u2020</footnotemark> A reservation or proviso may be in any part of a deed. Though a- general grant to the freeholders and inhabitants of <em>Rochester </em>would be void \u201e . . \u201e , for uncertainty, yet a reservation out of a grant to trustees, for their benefit, would be good. The patent speaks of the free* holders and inhabitants for the time being, as <em>cestui que trusts.i </em>and persons interested. They are not strangers The intention of the trustees in making this proviso is manifest, and the court will feel disposed to carry that intention into effect. The privilege of cutting wood is. not personal, but an easement running with the land. Where a trust is clearly expressed in an instrument, or appears on the face of the deed, the rule is the same at law as in equity.<footnotemark>\u2021</footnotemark></p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b210-12\"><em>L.

It is there expressly decided, that the <em>proviso </em>in the deed of 1728, was null and void ; that the inhabitants of <em>Rochester </em>were not a body corporate, so- as to be competent to take an estate in fee. And if a grant to them would be void, a reservation to them, in a deed in fee to a third person, would be equally void. Nor would it be valid as a covenant to stand seised. The inhabitants of-<em>Rochester </em>were strangers to the deed. The present inhabitants, at all events, must be so considered. For they not being a body corporate s\u00f3 as to perpetuate the rights granted by the-patent, these rights must be restricted to the then inhabitants. They alone were the <em>cestui que </em>trusts. The. grantors in this deed were seised in fee as private individuals, and competent, under the patent, to convey the common land of the town of <em>Rochester. </em>(2 <em>Johns. Rep. </em>230.) Their deed, and all provisos and reservations, must receive the same construction, and be governed by the same rules, as the deeds of other individuals. The plaintiffs must, therefore, have judgment upon the verdict of the jury.</p>\n<p id=\"b211-8\">Judgment for the plaintiffs.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
