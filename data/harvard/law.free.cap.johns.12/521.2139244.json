On the same day, <em>Monell </em>called on Mr, <em>Jay, </em>and offered to pay him the money due on the mortgage, and the latter consented to receive it and cancel the mortgage; but <em>Monell </em>said he was ad-vised that he had a right to an assignment of the mortgage; that he should apply to the chancellor for- an order to stay the sale, and compel an assignment, and would deposite \u2022 the money, in one of the banks, complaining that he should lose his interest.

The object of the respondent\u2019s bill,- in the court below, was to effect a sale of the mortgaged premises by the master, to reeqvier, out of the proceeds, the sum due to him-; arid although the Subsequent purchase of the equity of redemption, by thd appellant^ <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"527\">*527</page-number>\u00a1could not destroy the respondent\u2019s priority for the payment of the amount due on his mortgage, according' to the decree by consent, (which certainly could not be altered in that respect,) yet the rights of the appellant and the other defendants, in the court below, being reserved to them respectively, the question as to priority remained open, and was a subject for future investigation by the court; and, until that was settled, the appellant had a right to better , his case, by purchasing the equity of redemption.</p>\n<p id=\"b537-3\">The decision of this cause, however, wholly depends upon the nature of the payment made to Mr. <em>Jay, </em>the solicitor of the respondent. If, then, bn an examination of the evidence, it should turn out to have been in extinguishment of the mortgage, the subsequent proceedings must be nugatory, as founded on an instrument which had ceased to operate, and the order of the court ofchancery ought to be reversed ; but if it should be a mere deposite, the order ought to be affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b537-4\">From the correspondence between Mr. <em>Burr </em>and Mr. <em>Jay, </em>no correct conclusion, as to the nature of the payment, can be drawn. The former states that <em>Monell </em>was disposed to redeem, and had offered to pay the principal, interest,, and costs, but. that Mr. <em>Lawrence </em>refused to receive it; this the latter denies, and says that he only refused, in behalf of Mr. <em>Lawrence, </em>to give an assignment of the mortgage, and was still ready tp receive the amount, and stop all further proceedings, but-without assigning the mortgage, which, he said, could only be requir\u00e9d for the purpose of defeating a trust for the benefit of Mr. <em>Sackettfs </em>creditors, a purpose which appeared to him iniquitous ; that, therefore, he saw no reason for delaying a sale of the premises; and the receipt, subsequently given'by him in the same cause for the amount, does not purport to be in extinguishment of the mortgage, although that would be the inference, in the absence of other testimony on the subject; but it appears, from the evidence of Mr. <em>Jay, </em>confirmed by- the testimony of <em>Jasper LyncK, </em>that this money was received at the instanbe of <em>Monell, </em>merely to save interest, and not with a view to redeem the mortgage. That this must have been the c\u00e1se, tjie subsequent conduct of the parties sufficiently evince.

The respondent, <em>William Lawrence, </em>having a mortgage .against <em>William W. Sacked f </em>and the defendant, <em>Monell, </em>having two judgments against <em>Sacked';'and </em>the defendant, <em>Wood, </em>having a deed of the mortgaged premises, from <em>Sacked, </em>in trust for all his creditors, the respondent filed his bill to foreclose the mortgage ; upon which, the parties, by their respective solicitors, on the 6th of <em>March, </em>1813, entered into an agreement, that the mortgaged premises-should be sold under the direction of a master in chancery, on, or after, the <em>15th </em>of <em>May, </em>then next, and the proceeds paid into the court of chancery 3 out of which <em>Lawrence </em>was to .be paid the sum due him 3 and the rights of <em>Monell, Woods, </em>and <em>Sacked, </em>to the surplus of such-proceeds, to be preserved to them, respectively. A decree was thereupon entered, pursuant to this agreement, and a reference- made to a master to ascertain the sum due on the mortgage, and to proceed to a sale of the mortgaged premises. Ac-, cording to the agreement, the master advertised the sale for' the 19th of <em>May. </em>After entering the decree, and before the day of sale, <em>Sacketds </em>interest in the mortgaged premises was sold under an elocution, issued upon \u00e1 judgment in favour pf <em>Edmund Gris-</em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"530\">*530</page-number><em>wold, </em>for about 90 dollars ; and of which judgment, <em>Monell </em>had become the proprietor; and upon this <em>sale,-'Monell </em>becomes the purchaser. His object will be seen by noticing the dates of the several encumbrances. The mortgage.is dated, the 1st of <em>August,, 1810. Monell </em>had two judgments, in his qwn naitie, against <em>Sackett. </em>The one, of <em>October </em>term,. 1811, for 1,114 dollars'; .and the other, of <em>October </em>term; 1812, for 375 dollars. <em>Griswold?* </em>judgment, under which the sheriff sold, was obtained in <em>June, </em>1812; and on the 30th of <em>July, </em>1812, <em>Sackett </em>conveyed to <em>John Woods, </em>the mortgaged\" premises and ofher l\u00e1nds, in trust for all the creditors of <em>Sackett. </em>This deed being prior in date to <em>MonelPs </em>las t judgment, his object probably was to secure hiinself,, arid overreach this; deed, by availing himself 'of Gm* <em>wold's </em>judgment, which was one month older .than the deed. This might have been an honest struggle to secure his own debt; and if his proceedings and conduct, in relation to that sale by the sheriff, were fair, his object'may.be. attained, if he can set aside the sale made by the master, under the, agreement, and the decree tif the court of chancery^</p>\n<p id=\"A2Xt\">The. regularity or fairness of the proceedings, under the sheriff\u2019s sale, are not how before us ; the appellant, for spine reason or other, appears to have been extremely solicitous to .become the purchaser of the mortgage, and to have the same.assigned to him. <em>Lawrence </em>was willing to receive the money due him, and <em>cancel </em>the mortgage, This, it seems, would not .answer <em>Monell's </em>purpose, and he insisted upon having the mortgage assigned to him. The objection, on. the part of <em>Lawrence, </em>against assigning the mortgage was, that it might be used to defeat the trust created .by the deed to <em>Woods, </em>for the general benefit of <em>Sackett'e </em>creditors. The mortgage money was, in point of fact, paid to <em>Lawrence </em>; the mortgage., however, neither cancelled nor assigned to <em>Monell. </em>And the first, .and one of. the principal questions in the cause is, whether this payment was made, and accepted, in .satisfaction and discharge of (lie mortgage, or only as u deposite, and s\u2019o as not to affect the sale by the master ? I am fully satisfied that it must be. viewed in the latter sense; \u25a0 and without prejudice to those proceedings, It is unnecessary rto scrutinize minutely, what actually passed between <em>Lawrence </em>and <em>Monell, </em>on the 7th of <em>May, </em>when there was some pretence of a tender of the money due on the mortgage. The .parties, ac? \u2022 cording t&lt;s their affidavits, appear to . have understood very dif\u00bb <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"531\">*531</page-number>ierently What passed on that occasion ; \u00e1nd were it necessary to decide between them, we should be bound, according to the rules of evidence, to give credit to the statement of <em>Lawrence, </em>as he is supported, in many particulars, by the testimony of <em>Lynch. </em>But this must be put entirely out of view; for the subsequent arrangement made with Mr. <em>Jay, </em>in relation to the money, was a waiver of any thing that might have had the appearance of a tender. It was the next day that the money was paid to Mr. <em>Jay </em>; upon which, after stating the title of the cause, he gave a receipt as follows: <em>u </em>Received, <em>May </em>8th, 1813, from Mr. <em>Geotge M(mellf </em>one of the defendants in this cause, 3,932 dollars and 90 cents.\u201d Nothing is to be collected from the receipt itself, as to the terms and conditions upon which the money was received. It was a mere naked deposite, and is open to explanation from other testimony, to show the understanding of the parties. It has been repeatedly ruled in the supreme court, that receipts may be* explained, and even contradicted, by paroi evidence. The' grossest abuses and frauds might be practised if bare receipts were to be deemed conclusive, and not open to examination# (1 <em>Johns. Cas. </em>145. 2 <em>Johns. Rep. </em>378. <em>5 Johns. </em>Rep. 72.) And the same principle has been fully recognised by other courts. (2 <em>Term Rep. </em>866. 5 <em>Ves. </em>87. 1 <em>Peters\u2019 Adm. R</em>ep. 179, 180.) The paroi evidence in this case, on the part of the respondent, does not contradict, the face of the receipt, but is in perfect harmony with itand we must have recourse to this evidence to explain its meaning, and ascertain the intent and object which the parties- had in view. \u25a0 Mr. <em>Moneli </em>certainly stahds contradicted by Mr; <em>Jay </em>and Mr. <em>Lynch,, </em>in many important particulars; he says he paid Mr. <em>Jay </em>the full sum due oil the mortgage ; (though he does nofsay it was so paid or received-in satisfaction of the mortgage;) that he offered to pay the costs, but they were not made out; that he left money with bis counsel, to pay the costs, and thereupon left the city, (Kew-York,) believing the cause was at an -end, and not having the slightest-suspicion that any further proceedings would be attempted therein. Mr; <em>Jay, </em>after stating the ineffectual attempts of Mr. <em>Moneli </em>to procure an assignment of the mortgage, says&gt; <em>Moneli </em>informed him that he should deposite in one of the banks, the sum,due upon the mortgage, and cause an application to be made to the chancellor On the subject. - That he, (Jay,) partly to oblige <em>Mondl, </em>and, partly, sooner to obtain the money <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"532\">*532</page-number>due his client; told, him he would beehive, if,, and when aX sal\u00e9 to\u00b0k place, he (Monell) should be repaid out of the proceeds \u2022 thereof; With interestXto the time of the sale. And thereupon, <em>M'q? nbll </em>paid' him the money, stating that he - did it to avoid .losing. the interest on the sanie. And that M\u00f3nell.then requested him to postpone the sale until the- 3d day of <em>June, </em>to which he con- - sented. That the sale was afterwards twice postponed, at the solicitation of Mr. <em>Burr, </em>,but whether by the desire of <em>\u25a0Monell, </em>does not appear. Mr&lt; <em>Jay </em>further says, that when-he received the money, he did-not consider <em>Monell </em>as haying re.deemed the; premises, but as making a deposite in hih hands,-, tq .be returned with interest, out of .the proceeds of the sale, if a ' sale should take place, or to b\u00e9 retained \"by Lawrence,^if; the Court should direct an assignment.-of the mortgage, .of'tihe. sale should be prohibited. Mr. <em>Lynch </em>says, he was-present when the money was paid, and <em>that-Monell </em>requested <em>Jay </em>to receive- ' it, Xmerely to save \"interest; and that it was,understood,, that it was 'to be repaid\"with' 'interest; 'after the sale.; and that Monell' requested the sale to be postponed until some time in <em>June* </em>It. is entirely .impossible to reconcile the affidavit of <em>Monell </em>with those,of <em>Jay, </em>and <em>Lynch; </em>.for if; as .the former' states, he paid, the money,, and went home, believing the .cause at an end, and having no suspicion that any further proceedings would be attempted, why, as the latter states, did'he solicit, and actually obtain a postponement of the Sale f or.why make any agreement for'the-, repayment of his money, with the\u2019 interest, out of\u2018the proceeds of the sale. There is not only two disinterested wit-' .nesses opposed 'to the affidavit of the party himself, but 'the \"whole course of the transaction furnishes a very strong presumption, that Mr. <em>Monell </em>must be labouring under some mistake,. ' with \u25a0 respect' to the terms upon, .which the money was left With Mr. <em>Jay'-, </em>His great and leading object was to obtain ion assignment* of the mortgage.- - This being utterly refused, he contemplated, according \" to his o wn declarations, an application to the chancellor on the -subject ;&gt; and it Was .probably' to give him' \u2019 time to'm'ake such-application that he. wanted the s\u00e1.l\u00e9 postponed. This appears to me to be a -fair and reasonable interpretation of.his conduct. \u25a0 There is nothing; contained in Mr. <em>Jay's </em>letter to Mr. <em>Burr, </em>inconsistent with the statement in his affidavit, \u25a0But admitting' that there is,, it- Would \u00f1\u00f3t affect the prese iR; \u25a0question, for fifese-letters \"were written before the final': arfr\u00e1nge<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"533\">*533</page-number>latent between Mr. <em>Jay </em>and Mr. <em>Moneli, </em>which might have been varied; and we may reasonably conclude it was varied; for <em>Moneli </em>thereby was to receive a substantial benefit, not in-eluded in the proposition to Mr. <em>Burr, </em>viz. the interest of his money, deposited with Mr. <em>Jay. </em>It is to the consummation of a contract that we are to look for its terms, and all previous negotiations are swallowed \u00fap and lost in the final arrangement. From this view of this branch of the case, we are bound, I think, to conclude that the payment made by <em>Moneli, </em>was no redemption, or extinguishment of the mortgage, but a mere deposite of money, to await further proceedings in chancery,, and to be disposed of as agreed between the parties, on the result of such proceedings being known. This payment, or deposite, therefore, could not affect the proceedings of the master, or operate as a stay of the sale and there was no special agreement that could have such effect; and, indeed, directly the contrary is to be inferred, for <em>Moneli </em>was to receive back his money, with, interest, after the sale; which shows, conclusively, that the sal\u00e9 .was to take place, unless stayed by order of the court. And the next inquiry is, whether any proceedings have taken place in the court of chancery, which would affect the sale made by the master. Mr. <em>Jay </em>having from time to time consented to the postponement of the sale, until the 1st of <em>July, </em>application, On the part of <em>Moneli, vj </em>as made to the chancellor, on the 7 th of <em>June, </em>to dismiss the bill; this was, however, d\u00e9nied : and on the 22d of the same month, another notice was given of a motion to stay the sale. On the'29th of the same month, an order was, entered, \u25a0 which, among other things, directed the sale of the mortgaged premises to be stayed; but this order was not served, or any notice thereof received, either by the master, or the solicitor of the respondent, until after the sale had abtually taken place. The chancellor, afterwards, ordered the master to abstain from giving any deeds for the mortgaged premises, until the further order of the court, and that the'respondent should show cause, at the <em>August </em>term, why the sales should not be vacated. But on cause being shown, the sales were confirmed,' and dee da ordered to be executed by the master, and the . proceeds of .the sales to be applied conformably to the decree, by consent, in <em>March, </em>last.</p>\n<p id=\"b543-5\">It has been contended, on the part of the appellant, that the Order of the 29th of <em>June, </em>to stay the s\u00e1le, suspended the au? <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"534\">*534</page-number>thority of the master,- and that all proceedings by him, after- &gt; wards, w.ere void, although, <em>no </em>notice of the order was given\u00bb This position is,, in my opinion, untenable\u00bb Had \"this been a final decree, which went to the-merits of the responder\u00edas claim, there might have been \u2019 some foundation for the argument; for all persons may be bound to take notice of decrees \"in- chancery,; as well as of judgments at-lavv; (2 P. <em>Wms. </em>483. 1 <em>Vern. </em>286.;)-but they cannot be bound to notice all interlocutory orders, .It is, true that \u00e1 court, of chancery looks , with a jealous :\u00e9ye M the, purchase of a right under, litigation,, and \"this for' the purpose df preventing a fraudulent eyssion of its decrees, by the parties* But where the sale is by an officer \"of tlie court, to whom-no such fraudulent motive . could be . imputed, the rights of third\" \"persons,, who \u2018 are innocent, <em>horia fide </em>purchasers, under '\"such sale, <em>ought to be </em>protected.. If a party is present in court, and has -knowledge of any order or proceeding, and. do\u00e9s any. act contrary thereto,- he -is guilty of and punishable1\u2019for, a contempt; but-it by \"no means follows that such proceedings are to -affect, -the rights, of third persons, who were ignorant thereof. \"Suppose a judgment at law. was obtained against \u00e1-person, - and an execution in the hands .of a sheriff in- a remote county, upder which he had duly- advertised ' for \u25a0sale, but-before the''day of sale an order to stay proceedings was -obtained, but-notice thereof nof given.-to the. sheriff, or the, plaintiff, -or bis, attorney, and the. sheriff should proceed and sell, could there be a doubt but that the' purchaser would acquire a valid title ; And should not\u2019g court pf equity, equally with;a court-of law, protect in-. hoc\u00e9rit, <em>bona fide </em>purchasers ? It Would, certainly , be -unprecedented* to, set aside the sale, without the purchasers\u2019 being1brought into court,-in some way,- and an \"opportunity afforded them of defending their rights, their titles having been consummated ; and without their having received dby notice of the\" order1 staying the-sale,, or of the present appeal, and there- being no complaint of inadequacy in\" the price paid by them, or of any unfair practice in the .sale, \u25a0 There i-s\u00a1 also, another objection to the, (node adopted by the appellant to obtain relief in the courtbelow, even if an application for relief could in any. way be sustained ; -it is an attempt'to set aside, -upon motion, a decree entered by\" consent of parties. This is \u25a0 against the established mode of proceedings in chancery. .The,case <em>o\u00ed Harrison </em>v. <em>Rumsey, </em>(2 Ves. 488.,) came before the court upon- petition '; and'Lord <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"535\">*535</page-number><em>Hardwicke </em>said he would by no means set aside a decree ob-tamed by consent of counsel on both sides, for it would be most dangerous, and it was ail established rule not to do it, nor would he make the precedent. There was, he said, a good while ago, an appeal of that kind, in the house of lords, who desired the party to bring an action against the counsel: if they could prove collusion on the counsel, it would be a different thing; and, in the case of <em>Bradish </em>v. <em>Gee, </em>(Ambler, 229.,) the same lord chancellor said, where a decree is made by consent of counsel, there lies not an appeal or rehearing, though the party did not really consent'; but his remedy is against his counsel. But if such decree was by fraud and covin, the party ma'y be relieved against it,' <em>not by rehearing, or appeal, but by original bilL </em>Independent of these difficulties, which \u00a1.consider insurmountable, the general equity of the case appears to me to be against the appellant. There has been no sug^estiop that the decree by consent was obtained by fraud or imposition, <em>or </em>that the .mortgaged premises were not sold for their full value ; and he is now seeking to set aside this sale, made pursuant to his own agreement, for the purpose of vesting in himself, solely, the title, and to prevent the equitable distribution of the surplus among the creditors of <em>Sackett. </em>in whatever light, therefore, the case is considered, T am of opinion that the order of the chancellor, confirming the sales by the master, ought to be affirmed.
