That the witnesses lived near the premises ; and that since 1792, and long before, the defendant and his father exercised the right claimed by them, to cut wood on the said premises, with the knowledge of the plaintiff, and they never heard the right questioned, until a short time before the commencement of the present suit. Two witnesses, for the plaintiff, testified, that they lived near the premises, and that the privilege claimed by the defendant and his grantor; to cut wood on the premises, had been a subject of controversy between^ them and the plaintiff, and those under whom he derived his title, for many years, and that actions of trespass had been brought before justices of the peace ; and that the plaintiff had uniformly and openly denied and resisted the privilege claimed by the defendant.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b369-4\">It was agreed by the case, that, if the court should be of opinion that the plaintiff Was entitled to recovery, an interlocutory judgment should be entered, and a writ of inquiry of damages issue thereon; otherwise, a judgment of nonsuit was to be entered.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b369-5\"><em>A.

There can be no apportionment in such a case. Suppose <em>Jacob Schermerhorn </em>had, by separate conveyances, par-celled out his 400 acres to forty different persons, with the same clause as to common of <em>estovers, </em>could all the different tenants exercise rights of common, originally granted to enc only ? <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"360\">*360</page-number>Again, all the rights or privileges gr\u00e1hted <em>to Jacob Scherinerhom, </em>and which; passed to: his, sons, have <em>been surrendered ; </em>and \u2018 jf pie defendant justifies, it must be under a new title, not under jj.jjg orjgjnaj grant to Ins ancestors-.. Here is not only a surren-' derby express stipulation.;, but a \u2022surrender./by operation..of law. The son accepted a new lease for the premises derived. from his. father.<footnotemark>*</footnotemark> The acceptance of the new lease, inconsistrent with a. former., operates, as a surrender of.such former deedu * - . . <em>1 , , . </em>\u25a0 it may be objected, perhaps, that there is no certain evidence of an actual .surrender, of the original lease... But the agreement for the new lease was. express, that the old one was to be surrendered. Such surrender was a condition precedent to granting the new lease. The manner of obtaining the new leases, connected with the agreement, shows, conclusively,1 that' the Condition oh which the., new leases were-to be given., Was' \u2022fulfilled. \u00a1But it will be said, that the. defendant, not being \"a party, is not estopped, . But where a surrender is. -nec\u00e9ssary to give- effect to. a new lease,:the parity who accepts the new. deed is incapacitated to deny the surrender of the old deed\u00bf</p>\n<p data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AmZa\">Again, it may,, perhaps, be said,, that the- new lease is not for the whole \u00f3f the premises contained in the old lease; and so cannot Operate as a surrender .of The. whole. Granting this, still the surrender is- good pro <em>tanto f </em>if so, it must op\u00e9ra te\\as a complete surrender of the right of common ; for to. what part can the right of common attach? By the surrender of a part, the common is extinguished and gone.<footnotemark>\u2020</footnotemark></p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"AkP\"><em>H.

The defendant,, being the-heir of <em>Ry \u00e9rs, </em>the' land descended to him,., with the . right-of common of estovers., A grant' of the land carries with it the right - of common, which is attached to the land. Then what; has been done to release this right of common ? The agreement made with the lord of the manor, was merely for the purpose of changing the nature of the rent; .to make it certain, to, avoid quarter1sales, and that each might hold in severalty. It was at the instance, and for the benefit, of the tenants, who wer\u00e9 parties-' to that agreement. The lord of the manor had no concern with the rights of commons. As no release of these rights to the' <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"361\">*361</page-number>lord of the manor, are produced, or shown, the court will not presume that they have been released.</p>\n<p data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b371-4\">Then what is the effect of the new lease to <em>Ryers Schermerkorn? </em>It was only for a part of the lands derived from his father. The premises originally granted comprised two islands in the <em>Hudson, </em>which are not included in the new lease.; if he surrendered a part, the right of common became apportioned, and he retained the right of common as to the part not surrendered. If so, the plaintiff must fail in this action, for the quantity or extent of the defendant\u2019s right is not to be settled in this case. If <em>Ryers </em>retained any part of the land to which the right of common remained attached, the law of apportionment will apply to that part. Common of <em>estovers </em>may be apportioned as well as any other common.</p>\n<p data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b371-5\">Again, the paroi evidence shows that the defendant has exercised this right of common for more than 20 years, under the eye of the plaintiff, and an acknowledgment of this right on his part. Common may be gained by long sufferance, as well as lost by long neglect.<footnotemark>*</footnotemark> The law, as in the case of ancient lights, presumes a grant, from the lapse of time.</p>\n<footnote data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"footnote\" id=\"x999-1\" label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"AkC\"><em> Co </em>Litt. 147. b. 164. b. 4 Vin.

The only question which it is deemed necessary to consider, is, whether the agreement with <em>Stephen Van </em>Rensselaer, and the acceptance of new leases by <em>Ryers Schermerkorn </em>and his two brothers, in pursuance of that agreement, have operated to devest him and his heirs of their original privilege of cutting wood in those parts of the 400 acre tract which are included in the new leases to <em>Johannes </em>and <em>Hendrick Schermerkorn ?</em></p>\n<p id=\"b371-8\">It is contended, by the plaintiff\u2019s counsel, that the acceptance of the new leases was, virtually, a surrender, in law, of the original lease, and of all rights which the new lessees had acquired under it.</p>\n<p id=\"b371-9\">According to Sir <em>Edward Coke, </em>\u201c a surrender is a yielding \u25a0up of an estate, for life or years, to him that hath the immediate estate in reversion or remainder, wherein the estate for life or years may drown, by mutual agreement.\u201d <em>(Co. Lit. </em>337. b.)</p>\n<p id=\"b371-10\">Here, it must be observed, that the original lease to <em>Jacob Schermerkorn </em>was a grant <em>in </em>fee, subject to rent. There was, therefore, no immediate estate of reversion or remainder in the lessor or his heirs, in which a lesser estate could merge or <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"362\">*362</page-number>drown; so that the doctrine of surrender, express or implied, has, strictly, no application to this case.</p>\n<p id=\"AzL6\">j think, however, that <em>law, </em>as well as <em>equity, </em>forbids the cjajm sej. yp fay the defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b372-4\">1st. On the ground that a release by <em>Byers, Johannes, </em>and <em>Hendrick^Schermerhorn, t\u00fa Stephen Van Rensselaer, </em>is, -legally, to be presumed; because the agreement to release; with the \"reasons and motives given for it; the acceptance of new leases for the premises in question, and exacting a general covenant of warranty against all claims, are acts utterly inconsistent with the existence of the old lease, so far as regards the lands included in the new leases. '\u2019</p>\n<p id=\"b372-5\">The agreement bound <em>Ryers Schermerhorn </em>and his brothers to release all claims to the 400 acre tract; and, upon condition of their so doing, <em>Stephen Van Rensselaer </em>covenanted to give new leases, in lieu of the old lease. Fair dealing, and the obligation of their contract, required them to extinguish all previous interest and claims, before they accepted new leases for the same land, with general warranty of title. Besides, the case agreed on expressly states, that the lessees accepted the new leases \u201c <em>in pursuance of the said </em>agreementwhich implies that, upon executing the new leases, all the previous conditions were complied with on the part of the lessees ; and, if so, the release must have been duly executed.</p>\n<p id=\"b372-6\">2dly. On the ground of <em>estoppel, </em>I think the defendant is barred of all claim under the original lease.</p>\n<p id=\"Aii\">The <em>locus in quo </em>was not, indeed, a part of the lands for which <em>Ryers Schermerhorn </em>accepted a new lease to himself; but the transactions embraced in the agreement with <em>Stephen Van Rensselaer, </em>were the subject of one entire contract, wherein the covenants and stipulations of each of the parties were, necessarily, dependent upon, and connected in interest with, the acts to be done by every other party. I consider, therefore, that, in executing that agreement, <em>Ryers Schermerhorn </em>contracted not only for a new lease to himself, for his particular part, but, also, that new leases should be given, in complete seve-. rally, for the other parts., to his brothers, <em>Johannes </em>and <em>Hendrick. </em>At the time of making that agreement, <em>Ryers </em>had a privilege (appurtenant to his other land) of cutting wood for fuel and fencing, on any part of the 400 acre\" tract; and, by that agreement, he consented and appointed that the landlord should <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"363\">*363</page-number>execute' new leases to <em>Johannes </em>and <em>Hendrick, </em>for particular parts of that tract, without reservation of his privilege. Those new leases have, accordingly, been executed, and include the 7 <em>locus m </em>quo.</p>\n<p id=\"b373-5\">Estoppel may be by matter <em>in pais </em>as well as by matter of record; as, by accepting an estate, making partition, &amp;c. <em>(Co. Lit. </em>352. a.) \u25a0 '</p>\n<p id=\"b373-7\">So, if a man take a lease of his own land, he is estopped from setting up his original title. <em>(Co. Lit. </em>47. b.) And, whether <em>Ryers </em>took \u00e1 new lease to himself, or directed, in writing,under seal, that his landlord should give new leases to his bro.thers, for the premises in question, he is equally estopped from asserting any claim in opposition to the new leases. -\u2018</p>\n<p id=\"b373-8\">From the view which we have taken, the paroi evidence in the case is irrelevant; and the plaintiff is entitled to judgment-</p>\n<p id=\"b373-9\">judgment for the plaintiff,</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
