Whenever a decision takes place in the supreme court, which is final, and of which a record can be made, and which shall decide the rights of property or personal liberty, in such case the statute gives jurisdiction to this court. <em>Coke</em><footnotemark><em>*</em></footnotemark><em> </em>says a writ of error lies when a man is grieved by any error in the foundation, proceeding, judgment, or execution. But without a judgment, or award in the nature of a judgment, no writ of error lies; and in <em>Metcalf's Case,</em><footnotemark>\u2020</footnotemark> he states the <em>exceptions </em>to the general rule, that error does not lie, but on a judgment, &amp;c. and which will comprehend the present case. So, a man may have a writ of error before all parts of the cause are decided, as on demurrer, before a writ of inquiry of damages is executed;<footnotemark>\u2021</footnotemark> or in <em>quo warranta, </em>where judgment is given for part of the liberties claimed, and the court take time to consider as to the other part.<footnotemark>\u00a7</footnotemark></p>\n<p data-order=\"22\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b45-4\">In <em>Ascue </em>v. <em>Fulijambe,</em><footnotemark><em>\u01c0\u01c0</em></footnotemark><em> </em>it was held that a writ of error would lie on an award of execution on the statute merchant, though no writ of error would lie on an erroneous acknowledgment of the statute, but an <em>audita querela. </em>So, a writ of error lies on a <em>fine and recovery, </em>though the word judgment, or any thing in the form of a judgment, is not to be found in the writ or proceedings.<footnotemark>**</footnotemark></p>\n<p data-order=\"23\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b45-5\">Where bail brought a writ of error, as well for error in rendering the judgment, as awarding the execution on the <em>scire facias, </em>though the writ qf error was quashed as to the judgment against the principal, yet it was allowed to stand good as to the judgment against the bail on the <em>scire </em>facias.<footnotemark>\u2020\u2020</footnotemark> So, where a writ of error was brought as well for the rendering of judg ment against the testator, as awarding execution against the executors,<footnotemark>\u2021\u2021</footnotemark> it was held good as to the award of execution.</p>\n<p data-order=\"24\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b45-6\">Whatever judgment the court below may have given on the proceedings certified by the justice, whether to quash, affirm, or reverse them, it is such a judgment that error will lie thereon.</p>\n<p data-order=\"25\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b45-7\">If the supreme court had jurisdiction of the cause on the affidavits, then ail the purposes which could have been effected by a <em>certiorari, </em>are as\" well effected by the affidavits. The court has the same view of the proceedings before the justice. Having elected to bring the matter before the supreme court by affidavit, the opposite party cannot thereby be deprived of his, right to have the decision qf th^t court reviewed.

There was no. evidence, in this case, of the loss 'of .the writ. The -language of <em>Hawkins,</em><footnotemark><em>\u2021\u2021</em></footnotemark><em> </em>where he, speaks of tfie proceedings being, <em>removed, </em>shows .that there .must be a writ.<footnotemark>\u00a7\u00a7</footnotemark> The-supreme court ought-have required a return to the certiorari, or have issued another writ.<footnotemark>\u01c0\u01c0\u01c0\u01c0</footnotemark> The record made by the justice <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"37\">*37</page-number>\u00aen view, ought to be made a <em>judgment, </em>and certified into the superior court.<footnotemark>*</footnotemark></p>\n<p data-order=\"31\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b47-3\">3.

The writ supersedes all proceedings in the court to which it is sent or delivered.<footnotemark>\u2020\u2020</footnotemark> When the justice received the writ, Ms jurisdiction ceased. His power of proceeding was at an end. And it would be monstrous 'if no court had jurisdiction of the matter-The supreme court had power to enforce a return to the. writ, by ail attachment. Where a court proceeds <em>summarily, </em>so that an issue in law or in fact is precluded, no writ of error can lie. Here is <em>no fact </em>confessed, or found, and without such fact, <em>ns </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"38\">*38</page-number><em>judgment of </em>tor, according to the definition, of \u2022 <em>Blackstone,</em><footnotemark><em>*</em></footnotemark><em> </em>which was not fully stated by the \u2022 other side, can be given.

There* There is <em>no judgment </em>of the supreme court, legally and technically speaking, in this case. The writ of <em>certiorari </em>was not returned, and there is nothing brought up here by the writ \u25a0 of error; for there could not, and ought not, to be a <em>record </em>in the case. It is inconsistent to allege that the affidavits are to stand in place of a return to the writ, and are the subject of a record ; for the dispute is about <em>the facts </em>set forth in the several affidavits,</p>\n<p data-order=\"37\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b49-5\"><em>Q. </em>A <em>discretionary </em>power, in cases like the present, is <em>necessarily </em>and properly reposed in the supreme court; nor can it be taken away, unless by an express act of the legislature.</p>\n<p data-order=\"38\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b49-6\">Again, the supreme court may travel out of the record, in order to do justice. The <em>force </em>may be traversed, and if the justice refuse to receive such traverse, the supreme court may hear affidavits of the facts, and order re restitution.<footnotemark>\u2020</footnotemark></p>\n<p data-order=\"39\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b49-7\">The cases cited to show that a <em>certiorari </em>might issue to the executor or administrator of the justice, can apply only to cases where a person has the <em>record in his custody. </em>But the executor could no more make up a record, or return to the <em>certiorari, </em>than the deceased justice himself. No person can make the return when the justice is dead. The supreme court having a general and supervisory power over all inferior jurisdictions, must, <em>necessarily, </em>have jurisdiction in such a case, <em>on motion, </em>without writ, since there was no other way of exercising their power. A careful examination of the cases cited in the court below, in support of this point, will show that they bear no other construction than that put upon them by the supreme court.</p>\n<p data-order=\"40\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b49-8\">3. The justice clparly acted officially, in awarding restitution; and he left a sufficient memorandum to show his proceedings, He acted in virtue of his office, and on the statute, and it was so considered by all the parties present.</p>\n<p data-order=\"41\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b49-9\">4. On quashing a conviction, an award of re-restitution is matter of course;<footnotemark>\u2021</footnotemark> if it is not, still it is a matter resting in the sound discretion of the court, and they have exercised that discretion in this case. It appears, that the justice made <em>Ehotjuell </em>give up the keys; this put him out of possession, and a re-restitution was then proper,</p>\n<p data-order=\"42\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b50-10\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"40\">*40</page-number>'\u25a0 Again, this writ. of error is brought by <em>Clas</em>on. But. the party complaining below was <em>De Peyster, </em>the person put out of possession by <em>Shotwell. Clason </em>must allege a prlvity of estate; but that can be no reason for \u00a1substituting himself as prosecutor, in the place of <em>De </em>Peyster. If <em>Clason, </em>with others, were Compelled? to appear in the cotirl below, they should all have been made parties in the writ of .error, or have \u2022 been summoned and severed, \\ .. \u25a0 &gt;</p>\n<p data-order=\"43\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b50-11\"><em>\u2022Murr, </em>in reply, contended, that the doctrine of summons and severance could not apply to a case of this kind, so entirely-new, and without precedent. Besides, it .-is too late, now to make the objection, as the non-joinder of others can only be .urged in- abatement. . That a writ of error lies in this case, is to. be shown from analogy, rather than from direct precedent there may be such an mjury'ih .this new proceeding of the court below, as, in every view of the' subject,' ought to be revised.. The powers and jurisdiction of this court are sufficiently ample,., wherever the decision of the court below is <em>final, </em>.and there peon-'be <em>direcord.</em><footnotemark><em>*</em></footnotemark><em> </em>Now,. here, is a <em>record </em>before the .court.; though without precedent, yet haviug form and fact.</p>\n<p data-order=\"44\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b50-12\">\u2022 . Ibis said that the .proceeding .of. . the: supreme . court was <em>summary. </em>It is that of which we complain... The statute has, prescribed the mode of proceeding in cases, of forcible entry and detainer and: if the; statute, h\u00e1d been,followed, in this case, there would have been a <em>record, </em>according to old precedents, \u2022bn which, it is. admitted, a writ of error might be brought\u00bb' '</p>\n<p data-order=\"45\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AIe\">On an <em>order </em>of, the court of . chancery, in; any stage of the suit, \u2022 an <em>appeal </em>may be 'instantly made 'to- this courtand we have never heard of the- inconvenience \u00a1arising from such a: course.

But if the affidavits are examined, it will be seen that, really, there was \u2022 nothing judicial\u2019 or official\" in his proceedings. The .party had himself taken his rempdy, with his own hand's, before the?justice arrived. And where' a party, having right, takes the -possession himself, that possession is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"41\">*41</page-number>good, and will not be disturbed. All the party can be liable <em>to, </em>is punishment for a breach of the peace.<footnotemark>(a)</footnotemark> As to the <em>complaint </em>said to have been made to the justice, it nowhere appears, that the justice went to the spot} in consequence of such complaint. The proceeding, as stated in the affidavit of <em>Briggs, </em>negatives all idea of the justice having acted <em>officially, </em>or as a justice of the peace, in a criminal proceeding. He merely advised the parties as to what ought to be done. The justice never acted on the complaint of <em>De Peyster. </em>All that he did was at the request of <em>Briggs, </em>and in order to protect him. The justice made no <em>record </em>of his proceeding; and it is not to be supposed that he would have proceeded legally and solemnly, under the statute, and have wholly neglected to make any official note or <em>record </em>of his proceedings. The shred of a return, so called, collected by <em>Shotwell, Briggs, </em>and the attorney for the plaintiff in the <em>certiorari; </em>ought not to be regarded. The supreme court have' censured an attorney for interfering to make a return for a justice.</p>\n<p data-order=\"47\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b51-5\">Again; the provision of the statute relative to attornments, shows that <em>Clason </em>was, all the time, virtually in possession <em>f </em>and that a <em>re-restitution </em>was impossible.</p>\n<p data-order=\"48\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b51-6\">The powers and jurisdiction of the supreme court are tobe found in those of the courts of <em>C. P., K. B., </em>and exchequer, in <em>England, </em>and in our statutes. No such proceeding as that of the court below can be found ever to have taken place in either of the three <em>English </em>courts mentioned. The case cited from <em>Siderfin </em>is the same as that of <em>The King </em>v. <em>Chaloner, </em>and eame up on <em>habeas corpus. </em>There is no mode of commencing or introducing a suit to the supreme court, upon motion, except what the ingenuity of counsel may discover.</p>\n<p data-order=\"49\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b51-7\">No doubt, the jurisdiction of the justice ceased on .the writ of <em>certiorari </em>being delivered to him ; but the supreme court did not, therefore, acquire jurisdiction of the cause. That court had jurisdiction over <em>the justice, </em>and might constrain him to make a return to the <em>certiorari </em>; but until the writ was returned into the clerk\u2019s office, the supreme court had no jurisdiction of <em>the </em>cause. These proceedings, therefore, were <em>coram non judice-. </em>Is this Court prepared to say, that suits may hereafter be com<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"42\">*42</page-number>menced, without writ, on affidavits ? The consequences of \u00c9uch a doctrine ought well to be considered. A wide, door would be opened to .perjury. ' \u00a1But the greater evils, Would- be, that facts would. be determined without the intervention of Jtiries ; and-parties would be deprived of the right of appeal# or of obtaining a review- of the decision of the supreme court, however erroneous -their judgment might be.</p>\n<footnote data-order=\"50\" data-type=\"footnote\" id=\"x999-1\" label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b44-7\"> 2 Caines' <em>Rep. </em>179, 183, 3 <em>Johns.

'\u25a0 \"\u2022 ; . / -</p>\n<p id=\"AJ\">The leading facts are few. On the fifth of <em>February, </em>ISIS, <em>George </em>De <em>Peyster went to Elijah Williams, </em>a justice! of the peace in <em>Westchester </em>county, .and -entered- a Complaint of -a forcible entry and detainer of his messuage and1 dwelling house, <em>by Gilbert Shotwell. </em>Upon this complaint, the justice immediately repaired to the premises, and found the family of <em>Samuel Briggs </em>in possession ;\u25a0 arid be also-found' that <em>De Peyster, </em>with <em>Thompson, </em>his attorney, and several other persons, had arrived there before him, and were occupied in emptying the house of its furniture, Briggs refused to -surrender the possession- of the house, and the justice directed him to be taken into custody^ which was done, accordingly, and in the presence, and with the sanction of the justice, the house, was completely cleared of <em>Briggs es </em>family and effects.</p>\n<p id=\"A8k\">This is the substance of the case, as taken from an unfinished record or return, which the justice' had prepared to the <em>certi</em>\"e-rap issued and delivered -to-h-imj-and-asiakenfrom \u00a1the justice <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"43\">*43</page-number>himself while <em>in extremis, </em>and lying on his deathbed. It is, therefore, to be considered as equal to an official statement under the magistrate\u2019s oath, for the return must have been drafted under the impression of that \u00a1sanction; and dying declarations are generally uttered and received as of equal solemnity. '</p>\n<p id=\"AR2\">But this imperfect return of the justice was aided and supported by a number of affidavits to the same effect, and so far from setting up a want of jurisdiction in the supreme court to take cognizance of the case, the record shows that <em>Isaac Clason </em>and <em>George De </em>Peyster, when called upon to answer, produced a number of counter affidavits; and submitted the case, upon the Conclusions to be drawn from the affidavits on the one side as well as on the other.</p>\n<p id=\"b53-5\">The supreme court made no further decision in the case, than to restore <em>Shotwell, </em>or <em>Briggs, </em>as his tenant, to the possession of the house and farm from which he had'been so irregularly expelled.. The justice stated that <em>Briggs </em>was cohvicted, under the statute, of a forcible detainer, but the supreme court did not touch that conviction. The record shows that they did nothing more than award re-restitution to <em>Shotwell, </em>and that nothing more was prayed forion his part ; and this fact becomes very material; for, as I shall show hereafter, re-restitution is a matter resting in the sound discretion of the court, and no writ of error lies upon a matter resting in discretion. If the supreme court had intermeddled with the <em>conviction </em>of the force, by either affirming or quashing it, error would .have lain upon <em>that </em>decision; but in this case the court did no such thing, nor does the record allege any act of the court, but the single act of ordering re-restitution to <em>Briggs. </em>The justice was authorized by the statute under which the complaint was made, to fine and imprison upon his own view and conviction of the force. Sncli a conviction would have been legal; but possession cannot be changed, without the intervention of a jury, and if the justice takes that step, on his own view, he does an unauthorized act. He did such an act in- this case, and it was that grievance, and that only, that the supreme court redressed. They confined their interference (I speak from the record' before us) to the unlawful change of the possession; and upon affidavits, as applicable to <em>that </em>fact, they awarded restitution to <em>Briggs. ; We </em>have, then, at present, nothing'to do with the conviction or the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"44\">*44</page-number>evidence \u25a0 of it. This is not the point before us, nor was it .the ground of application to the supreme court. The- whole prayer, in that court, was to be put back into possession, and the -whole complaint here is, that the supreme court, upon facts disclosed, by .affidavit, thought proper to- restore <em>Briggs </em>to his possession. ' - \u25a0 . . \u25a0 \u2022</p>\n<p id=\"b54-3\">I am prepared to show that this proceeding by affidavit was usual and regular.</p>\n<p id=\"Akk\">Even if the caus\u00e9 below had been placed on the legality, of the conviction of the force, and not on the legality of the <em>oust/r \u25a0 </em>of possession, the court had .sufficient matter before them to\" gi-v\u00e9 iSheni cognizance of-the case. A <em>certiorari </em>had heen. sued out 'and served, and the. justice made an imperfect, return, but before he completed it, he died. The court, in such a, case, was bound to be indulgent, and.to accept of the imperfect return, aided, as it was,, by the death-bed declarations of th\u00e9 justice. Such a course is essential to the due preservation of private, right, and is dictated by common Sense as well as by justice and humanity. It is the maxim of law, that the visita-\u2022 tian of Providence works no injuryk -The law-is not so technically nice as to sacrifice substance to shadow. It is a more reasonable syst\u00e9m. Jt is, indeed, \u00e1 collection Of written rea-son, and is never -assailed by ridicule,' except by those who either do not understand, or who mean to pervert it - If a judge at the circuit happened to die after taking the verdict, and before the return of the postea, the ancient law'allowed the' verdict to be returned by the. clerk, though if the judge had-been livingj. he tfas to make; the return. <em>(Jenk.

But all I need show, at present, is, that if the question be on the regularity . \u00f3f the possession gained,- (as it was. here,) it a\u00ed-' ways <em>muy, </em>and often <em>must, </em>depend upon matter of fact to be \"disclosed by affidavit. For thisAve have the case of \u2019 <em>The King </em>v. <em>Chaloner, </em>K. B. 15 <em>Charles </em>II. (1 <em>Sid. </em>156. 1 <em>Keb. </em>572. 585. 1 <em>Lev. </em>113. <em>Com. Dig. tit. Forcible Entry and Detainer, </em>D.) affprdi a precedent, complete and full to thq'yery <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"45\">*45</page-number>point. In that case, the K. B., as early as the year 1663, awarded a re-restitution, founded upon affidavits. The case was shortly this : the defendants- (being father and son) were convicted of a forcible detainer, upon the view of two justices of the peace, and fined and committed to gaol, and possession \"of their farm given to one <em>Smith. </em>These defendants were brought into the K. B. upon <em>habeas </em>corpus, and offered to submit to their fine, but to the end that the court might award restitution, it was shown by several affidavits that one of the defendants (the father) had been in possession for 13 ye\u00e1rs, and that Smith, pretending title, had procured the two justices to go -with him to the premises, and had used this contrivance to gala \u2022possession, for which conduct, the court directed a prosecution 'against <em>Smith </em>and the two justices, and, after several motions, the court awarded re-restitution to the two defendants, and held that the possession given to <em>Smith </em>was illegal, for that the justices, upon their own view, intermeddled with the possession. It was then moved that the conviction before the justices be quashed, and it was much debated whether <em>that </em>could be done on motion, without the conviction being duly removed into theK. B. by error. With this last point we have, at present, no concern. It may or may not have-been correctly decided. The case of <em>The King </em>v. <em>Elwell (Str. </em>794.) contains a different rule. But the case of <em>The King </em>v. <em>Chaloner </em>is strikingly analogous, and is a direct and unshaken authority on the principal point, viz. that the party who had been dispossessed of his farm by two justices, upon their own view, without a jury, and at the instance of a third person, who pretended title, was reinstated in his possession by the K. B. upon <em>motion and affidavit 's, </em>in all the books 5n which this case is reported or referred to, there is no disagreement on this point; It stands as good authority, and it completely vindicates the jurisdiction and course of proceeding exercised in this case by the supreme court. The present affords, indeed, the stronger reason; for in the case from <em>Siderfin </em>the two justices were living, and a regular and formal return of their proceedings could Mve been demanded and enforced. Here the injured party was deprived of that resource by the act of God, and could hope for nothing but the heads and fragments of a, return. It is scarcely necessary to observ\u00e9, that the bringing up of the body\u2019 of the #arty into the K. B. upon <em>habeas </em>corpus, was pot a removal of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"46\">*46</page-number>the r\u00e9cord; of conviction. Those are totally distinct .operation?. The party may be discharged on <em>habeas corpus, </em>and yet the\" Conyiefion below, remain undisturbed^, <em>(Holt, </em>Ch. <em>J. </em>in <em>Groenvelt </em>v. <em>Burwell, </em>1 <em>Ld. Raym. </em>454.) So, quashing a conviction, and \u2022awarding re-restitutioh are very distinct acts, without any n6* cessary connection. The conviction of the force may be legal, and yet the <em>ouster </em>of the possession lawless. -</p>\n<p id=\"b56-8\">There are many other cases to be found-in which the question of re-restitution has depended entirely upon facts disclosed by affidavit. Thus, in the cas\u00e9 Of <em>The King </em>v. <em>Stacey and others, </em>(1 <em>Sid. </em>287.) and again,' in the Case of <em>The King </em>v. <em>Bengough, </em>(3 <em>Salk. </em>287.) the inquisition of ;a forcible entry gnd detainer being removed into the K, B; re-restitution was awarded upon affidavit that, the defendant was not.permitted to traverse'the force. In such cases the- question of re-restittition must depend upon matter <em>aliunde. </em>The record sometimes will, and at other times will not, disclose sufficient for the court to determine whether the possession was lawfully changed, or, indeed, whether there was. <em>any </em>change of the. possession. In the .last \u2018cases cited), the refusal to receive'a traverse' of the force, did not appear by the record,-dnd the court were obliged) in Order to prevent manifest injustice, to receive proof of the fact, by affidavit; and if they are to receive affidavits on one side, they are bound to admit counter affidavits on- the other, and, the question Of a legal or illegal <em>ouster </em>of possession must depend upon the <em>credit </em>due' to the affidavits, of which credit the supreme court, and that-court only, can be the judge.</p>\n<p id=\"b56-9\">, I have thus shown, and, as 1 trust, to the satisfaction of \u00e9v\u00e9ry one, that the proceeding in the supreme cou rt, upon . the question of the restit ution of Briggs,; w as rpgularyand -supported by established usage. It is next , to be shqwn, that the application for re-restitution was an application to the sound discretion of the court; \u00e1s much so as an application, to hold to bail, dr to relieve Special bail, or to set aside a default, or to change the <em>venue, </em>or to award a new trial -, and if I establish, this point, it Will follow, of, course, that error cannot lie. \u2018 \"\u2022:,..\u2022 \u25a0 , ) \"' \u2022 '</p>\n<p id=\"b56-10\">The- ...general rule laid, down-in all the- abridgments and elementary works) .is this.; that -the,-IC,JB.. has \"a discretionary power oyer the point of r\u00e9-restitti\u00edion, and that this power flows from \u2022 an equitable construction Of\u25a0 the statutes concerning- fori <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"47\">*47</page-number>cihlc' entry and detainer. If, then, it shall appear that restitution was illegally awarded by the justice, or was illegally exeeuted under his order, the K. B. may set it aside, and grant re-r\u00e9stitution, if, upon the whole view of the case, they should deem it just and equitable ; but the defendant cannot demand this summary interference, as of strict right, <em>(ex rigore juris,) </em>for it rests upon the equity of the court. <em>(Viner, </em>tit. <em>Forcible Entry and Detainer, </em>O. 2. <em>Bacon, </em>h. t. G. <em>Hawkins, </em>h. t. b. 1. c. 64. \u00a7 63.) This doctrine, as I have stated it, is to be found in all the books which treat on this subject; It has existed for time immemorial, and has never been questioned, in a single instance, from the earliest periods of thq <em>English </em>law down to this day. It was expressly conceded in this ease by the opening counsel for the plaintiff. I will, notwithstanding, in order to make \u201cassurance doubly sure,\u201d east my eye over the leading cases; for this point being once well established, and it being also apparent, from the record itself, that this was the only point in the court below, and the only point before \u25a0us, the argument against the legality of the writ must force itself upon the mind with all the weight and certainty of a mathematical demonstration. .</p>\n<p id=\"b57-4\">The general role first, appears in <em>Dyer, </em>(2 <em>Dy. </em>122. b. pl. 24.) as early as the 2 and 3 <em>Ph. </em>&amp; <em>Mary, </em>that the K. B., notwithstanding the tender of a traverse to an indictment, under the statute to prevent forcible entries \u25a0 and detainers, might grant or stay restitution at their discretion. In <em>Fitz-William's </em>case, 45 <em>Eliz. </em>K. B. <em>(Cro. Eliz. </em>915. <em>Yelv. </em>32.) there is a practical illustration of the principle. That was an indictment under these statutes at the quarter sessions, and restitution was awarded to the party, after a <em>certiorari </em>had been delivered from the X. B, It was accordingly held to be irregular, as the delivery of the <em>certiorari </em>was a <em>supersedeas </em>to the power of the justices; but the court said the awarding of re-restitution was but matter in the discretion of the court, and as they conceived here had been an abuse, re-restitution was awarded. Again, in the case of <em>The King </em>v. <em>Ford, </em>4 J. 1. <em>(Yelv</em>. 99. <em>Cro. Jac. </em>151.) there was a conviction and restitution made by justices of the peace. The record being removed by <em>certiorari </em>to the X. B. the indictment was held ill; but on the question of re-restitutian, there were only three judges, out of five, for granting it, as <em>it </em>was a matter resting in their discretion, and there was a dif<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"48\">*48</page-number>fercnce of opinion as <em>to the equity of the ease. </em>In the case' \u00b0f <em>The King </em>v. <em>Burgess, 15 Ch. </em>II. K. B. <em>(T. Raym. </em>85.-1 <em>Keb. </em>343.) and which was 6\u00d3 years subsequent to the former case, we find the Justices <em>Twisden </em>and <em>Kelyng </em>laying down the sau,e role, that restitution was of duty, but that re-restitution, (meaning the summary interposition of the K. B.) was of grace and discretion. In the following age, during the'time of Lord <em>Holt, </em>we find it stated by him in <em>St. Leger </em>v. <em>Pope, 7 Wm. </em>III. <em>(Comb. 327.) </em>to be usual when an .inquisition of a forcible entry or detainer was; quashed to grant re-r\u00e9sti't\u00fction, but-that the court were not bound to do it, <em>ex m\u00e9rita justicias; </em>and, therefore, in <em>Rex v. Toslin, </em>10 <em>Wm. </em>III. K. B. <em>(Salk. 587.) </em>w\u00e9 meet with- an instance of an inquisition of forcible entry being quashed, but re-restitution denied. '</p>\n<p id=\"AA\">I will cite but one case more from <em>the .English </em>boolts: the case of <em>The King </em>v. <em>Marrow, </em>9 <em>G. </em>H. K. B. <em>(Cas. temp. </em>Hardw. 164.). decided, while Lord <em>Hardrwicke </em>was chief justice Of the <em>K. </em>B.,. and in which the rule is laid down with great certainty and precision. It was-the case of an indictment, of a forcible entry, removed by <em>certiorari </em>to the K. B., and on motion for re-restitution, Lord <em>It. </em>cited and adopted the observations in <em>Dalton, (Justice, </em>Ch. 134. p. 319.) that restitution, was a tiding in the discretion of the court, and that they could grant, or deny it, as the justice and reason of the case should\" require,</p>\n<p id=\"A-\">We have a cas\u00e9 to the same point decided in theisupreme court, in <em>August derm, </em>1803. I allude to the case, of <em>The People </em>v. <em>Shaw, </em>(1 <em>Caines, 125.) </em>and I cite it with the more satisfaction, because the opinion was delivered by a judge who is now a member of the senate,<footnotemark>*</footnotemark> and who must be able to appj.ec\u00a1ate an\u00bf\u00a1 render full justice to the accuracy of my illustration of this rule of law. In that case, there was an indictment for a forcible entry and detainer, a conviction, thereon, a delivery of possession to the - complainant, and a subsequent removal of the record into the supreme court. The court held the indictment erroneous, and set aside the proceedings, and awarded re-restitution; but, <em>Lewis, </em>Ch. J. in delivering the opinion of the court, observed, \u201c that ,from the general discretionary power which the. court had in these cases,- they might set a restitution aside, and award re-restitution, whenever it should appear that restitution had been illegally awarded. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"49\">*49</page-number>either'for insufficiency or defect in the indictment, <em>or other </em>caus'S.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b59-6\">I presume I have now produced, cases Sufficient to satisfy the most sceptical mind, that the supreme court had a discretion in this case, to determine whether it was fit and expedient to reinstate <em>Shotwell, </em>or <em>Briggs </em>as his tenant, in the possession of the house and farm from which he had been so violently ejected. And the importance of this power to the public: welfare may foe expressed in the words of Mr. Justice <em>Spencer, </em>when delivering the opinion of the court in <em>Lawton </em>v. <em>The Commissioners of Highways, </em>(2 <em>Caines, </em>179.) \u201c The necessity,\u201d he observes, \u201c of a superintending power, to restrain and correct partialities and irregularities which may be committed by inferior officers,x is so obvious and indispensable, that the court ought, by no means, to deny themselves a jurisdiction of such salutary influence.\u201d Being a matter resting in the sound discretion of the court, the exercise of that discretion is not the subject of review on a writ of error. This is another point, which I will now undertake to illustrate.</p>\n<p id=\"b59-9\">There seems to be no position more uniformly admitted, than that error will not lie on a matter resting in discretion. It is upon this ground that applications for new trials.; or for setting aside defaults and judgments; or for changing the venue ; or for time to plead, or to withdraw, or amend a plea ; or to hold to special bail; or to relieve or mitigate bail; or to award or deny a <em>mandamus </em>or a <em>precedendo ; </em>and applications on numberless other points arising in the progress of the suit, or in the ordinary details of the administration of justice, cannot be reviewed by a writ of error. There is this difference, as stated in the commentaries of <em>Blackstone, </em>(vol. III. 55.) between appeals from a court of equity, and writs, of error from a court of law : that the former may be brought upon any interlocutory matter, the latter-upon nothing but only a <em>definitice judgment. </em>It may not be amiss,,, however, to fortify this geiieral doctrine by a few adjudged cases. It might, indeed, be left to rest upon the fact, that there is no precedent in the books of a writ of error, in any such case, and this affords a strong presumption, in law, that no such writ will lie. It, is inconceivable that there should not be one instance to be found, \u00f3f error brought upon any of the numerous acts of discretion almost <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"50\">*50</page-number>'daily exercised by the courts, if it had been -: understood that error could have been sustained. The silence \"of the law oh this point, is eloquence Itself. 1</p>\n<p id=\"b60-7\">. But the books speak also in affirmative language. It is well known that an application for a <em>mandamus </em>is an application to the discretion of the court, who will grant or refuse it, as justice and equity shall require; and yet it has been held in the house of lords, in the case of <em>The King v. The Dean and Chapter of Trinity Chapel, Dublin, </em>(2 <em>Bro. P. </em>C. 554.) and again, in the case of <em>Pender </em>v. <em>Heale, </em>(3 <em>Bro. P. C. </em>178,) that a writ of error would not li\u00e9 upon the determination of the K. B. to grant or to refuse a <em>mandamus. </em>So, on appeal from an order in chancery, appointing a guardian on the ground that the selectian was not well made, the-house, of lords dismissed the appeal, because the chancellor had a discretionary power in the selec-tian of a guardian. <em>(Preston </em>v. <em>Ferrand, </em>2 <em>Bro. P. C. </em>179.) This doctrine is explicitly acknowledged, in the jurisprudence1 &lt;pf this country. Thus, in the case of <em>Burd </em>v. <em>Lessee of </em>Dans<em>dale, </em>(2 <em>Binney, </em>80.) the supreine court <em>o\u00ed Pennsylvania </em>decided, in a c\u00e1se of error from an inferior court, that on the refusal to grant a new - trial,, error did not lie, <em>though the </em>reasons of . the court, were reduced to writing, and entered of|record, for they observed \" that motions for new trial's were often founded upon equitable circumstances, in which much is left to the discretion i of the judge, The. high court of errors and' appeals in <em>Penn</em>s<em>ylvania </em>settled \u00e1 principi\u00e9 go verning this very case, as they are stated (2 <em>Binney, </em>91.) to have decided that a writ of. error did not lie on a decision of their supreme court! on a motion unconnected with the trial of a cause. So it was decided in the supreme court of the <em>United States, </em>in the case of the <em>Marine Insurance Company </em>v. <em>Hodgson, </em>(6 <em>Cranch, </em>206.) that the refu-. sal of an inferior court to allow a, plea t\u00f3 be amended; or a new pl\u00e9a to -be filed, or the refusal to grant a new trial, of to continue a cause, were matters which could not be assigned for error. * These! matters,\u201d. said Mr., Justice <em>Livingston, </em>in d\u00e9* Evening' the opinion of the court,depended so' much on the discretion of the court below, which must he' regulated more by the particular circumstances of every case, than by any precise and known rule of law,, and of which the superior court can never become fully possessed,' that there would be more danger' in revising matters of this kindy than what might result. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"51\">*51</page-number>how and then, from an arbitrary and improper exercise of this discretion.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b61-4\">Here we have a series of decisions in the highest tribunals to which we can resort for precedent, or for which we can inculcate a veneration. These decisions establish these two points, 1. That the award of re-restitution, under the statutes of forcible entry and detainer, is not <em>ex debito justicia, </em>but rests in soutid discretion; and, 2. That error will not lie on a decision depending on discretion. The argument, then, on the ground of authority, is conclusive. There is no escape from this conclusion. We must quash the writ of error, or we must, by a mere stretch of power, determine to\u2019 make new law for the ease.</p>\n<p id=\"b61-11\">But this rule is not only the positive law of <em>the </em>land, and as such, demanding our assent and obedience, but it is a rule founded on just and wise foundations of public policy, and it can be recommended to the good sense and to the good will of this court.</p>\n<p id=\"b61-12\">In the first place, such applications to the discretion of the court, are always supported by\u2018affidavits, and the court are called to weigh the credit of testimony, and to determine matters of fact. This court can never review such cases, without reviewing and judging upon the same testimony, which would <em>h e </em>assuming a jurisdiction never confided to it by the constitution. The appellate jurisdiction of the <em>English </em>house of lords, was the model in the erection of this court, and it was intended only to review the final judgments of the supreme court upon matter of law.. Every court of original and competent jurisdiction must be clothed with summary and discretionary powers over a vast field of undefined matter, constantly arising, and necessarily incident to the due administration of justice. This will be the case particularly with the highest court of common law, in which the deposite of great confidence, as well as of great power, becomes indispensable to the public safety.</p>\n<p id=\"b61-13\">Another reason why error cannot lie upon <em>these </em>cases of discretion is, that it lies only upon a decision that gives or concludes <em>the right </em>of the party, and such decisions, like the one now complained of, do neither. The question of re-restitution does not depend, necessarily, either on the legality or illegality of the <em>conviction </em>of a forcible entry or detainer. We have seen that the conviction may be good, and yet the mode of obtaining possession irregular; wc have seen that the conviction <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"52\">*52</page-number>maybe bad, and-yet re-restitution,. under the circumstances of the case, be denied. The question, of re-restitution need \u2022 \u25a0 x . ' i .not meddle with the question on \u25a0 the conviction. The one must appear by record, the other may appear-by affidavit, When the court award re-restitution, they do not determin\u00e9: the right of possession. They - decide only on the irregularity of taking possession under the -statute, in, the given, instance, and they leave the, party to go on immediately, and pursue, the possession in a mor\u00e9 regular way. . The court may eve\u00bb permit the party to renew the question of restitution by new affidavits. - The decision, -therefore,, does not touch' op 'prejudice the right of \"possession, nor is it definitive in the case. It is nota <em>res judicata, </em>which could be pleaded, in bar of a fresh application.\" Here was no judgment, in any technical sense.of the ferm., Here were no facts, either found by \u00e1 jury, or admitted by the-party,; We might as' well consider.-the decision of the court upon affidavits to' hold to -bail, or to c-hange the venue, or to set aside a default or an execution, as a judgment upon which error would lie. The-return attached to the writ of' error captains only a parcel of affidavits, made to,support-of to resist a special motion in the .supreme court. ' Every law-.ver, of the least technical learning, jhust know and feel the absurdity of calling the paper book before us, a record or judgment' containing the conclusions of law. How is it possible-for this court to sit- as jurors to determine on. the credit due to these-, contradictory affidavits1? And. yet, how cotild we otherwise know whether the' writ of re-restitution was dr;was not discreetly awarded ? Was such a writ,of error ever before heard of in the annals of any appellate jurisdiction ?1. We have seen that.the statutes, 'Of which so muck has1 been said, and that tl^is power, exercised by the supreme court, were in existence and activity, as far back as the reign of <em>Elizabeth; </em>and these statutes* have been- re-ena\u00e9ted here, when the .pow.eit in question, as grafted upon these statutes, was as ; well' known, and. settled as, <em>mf </em>branch of the law; \u00d1o alteration, nq. amendment, was made \u25a0 by the legislature. In \u25a0 short, \u00a1 the vefy. bringing of-a-writ o.f error in this case, will be thought by many to - bo a reflection-on this \u00a1court; It implies that its. character abroad is a character of infirmity,: It looks like an experiment to seq to-what extreme: depths of degradation-we tnight be conducted. But I have nd&gt; apprehension of s\u00edich results. The community are bound to. place\" higher confidence'in the talqitfs hpfi, learning qf the. pro^ <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"53\">*53</page-number>fessional, and in the understanding and firmness of the unprofessional part of this court. When a case arises which strikes at first principles\u2014.which touches the deep foundation of the law, I presume that <em>all </em>will zealously unite in protecting the, fair fabric of our jurisprudence.</p>\n<p id=\"b63-9\">. But we are told that the power exercised by the supreme court is dangerous to public liberty, and must now', for the first time, be controlled, even by the assumption of an unprecedented power in this Court. This language ought, at least, to have been supported by some strong case of oppression. Hard cases, I know, do sometimes make bad precedents. The imagination is inflamed with the passions, and the heart seduces the judgment. But here there was nothing done- which a good man ought to wish undone. Let us look, for one moment, into the merits of the case, and I am persuaded we shall find nothing in the decision which ought to aw\u00e1ken the sensibility, or disturb the moderation, of the court.</p>\n<p id=\"AXv\"><em>Samuel Briggs, </em>of the county of <em>Westchester, </em>happened,, on the fifth of <em>February, </em>1813, to be tenant to <em>Gilbert Shotwell; </em>and he w;as, on that day, with his family and goods, suddenly and violently, turned out of his house, into the street. The prosecutor, at whose instance this act was performed, was, ostensibly, <em>George De Peyster, </em>but, really, <em>Isaac Clason, </em>a merchant of the city of <em>New-York. </em>And how was this ejection of <em>Briggs </em>and his family effected ? If we do not applaud the end, we cannot but admire the means. In the evening of the preceding day, <em>De </em>Peyster, in company with <em>William A. Thompson, </em>his attorney, came to the house of the deputy sheriff, and, delivered to him a writ against <em>Briggs, </em>and requested him to serve it on the next day, at <em>Briggs's </em>house.- Let us mark this fact; it is disclosed by the deputy himself. In the afternoon of the next day, Or the fifth of <em>February, Briggs Was arrested </em>at his house, at the suit of <em>De Peyster, </em>in the sum of 3,069 dollars ; and to procure bail, he was taken to his father\u2019s residence, a distance of three and a half miles. While he was in this manner detached from home, the complicated plot was unfolded. <em>De Peyster, </em>in company with <em>Elijah Williams, </em>a justice, and <em>William A. Thompson, </em>the attorney, came to his house while absent, and began to turn his family and furniture out of doors. On his return, before they had finished the work, he remonstrated; but the justice and the .attorney said it <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"54\">*54</page-number>was done according to law, and the justice ordered him into custody, because he would not give his consent ; and he was taken by the collar and led into the street. This I believe to be the plain' unvarnished state of the case ; and the supreme court\u2019 deeming this proceeding altogether lawless, thought it their duty, in the exercise of a sound discretion, to reinstat\u00e9 . <em>Briggs' </em>in his possession. This is the act. now complained of. The court held it to be a clear point, that no change of possession can take place, under the- statute, until the justice has summoned a jury of twelve men, to determine, upon their oaths, the . existence of the -force. ' By dispensing with this admirable security of private right, the whole proceeding was irregular. If <em>Clason&gt; </em>had unduly lost th\u00e9 possession in the <em>October </em>preceding, as was. suggested, he .should,, have called -upon the aid of the law to regain that possession. ,It formed no apology for this oppressive and violent proceeding. The law has a tender regard for the asylum of a private dwelling; <em>debet sua cuique domus esse perfugium tutisiiinum\u00a1 </em>The court were not - to travel back to former transactions. They could only look., to, the character of the case before them, and it really appears to'me, that no man, whose moral sense is not perverted,- can think of it,, or can speak of it, without indignation. It is in vain to pretend that this was a mere private trespass, for which the. injured party had his private action. The. case wears a graver aspect. Here was a justice of . the peace,, who appeared clothed in the authority of a magistrate, 'and professing, to act upon a complaint made to him under the statute against forcible entry and detainer.; This was-avowed by him at the time. It was avowed by him in the record he had drafted. It was avowed by him with, his latest breath. -Here was,: also; an attorney, who was reading from' a book, and declaring the same thing. The poor, affrighted &gt; victim, would have made resistance to a mere private- trespass. But he was \u25a0 overawed by the sounding titles of law, and magistrate, and attorney ; and- those symbols of right to which - a good citizen is disposed to pay respect and obedience, were' shamefully . prostituted in this unworthy transaction. Was it not, then, the bounden duty of the supreme court to restore. <em>Briggs </em>to Ms possession, \u25a0 and thus to exercise the- discretionary power with which they were clothed,' and which bad beem sanctioned \"by the experience- of ages ? Were they to sit still and suffer <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"55\">*55</page-number>tlie forms of law to be so grossly abused ? Is there any thing, at least, in the act of the supreme court, so extraordinary, as to warrant this court, in its anxiety to redress it, to usurp a jurisdiction which the constitution never intended, and which is unknown to the law ?</p>\n<p id=\"b65-3\">But this court is advised to construe with great liberality its power of review, and it is even asserted, that its capacity to sustain writs of error is greater than that of the <em>English </em>house of lords. As I consider such doctrines to be alarming heresies, and dangerous to our constitutional rights, I must beg the patience of the court, while I bestow a few thoughts on their merit and tendency.</p>\n<p id=\"b65-4\">My position is, that a writ of error will not lie here, except upon a final judgment of the supreme court upon a question of law, and that our constitution and statute intended to go to the extent of the <em>British </em>usage on this point, and no further. This is evident, from the language of the constitution and the statute, and from the whole scope and structure of our judicial system. No other construction can preserve its value, its safety, its symmetry, and proportion. It appears to me also to be the dictate of sound policy, and, for reasons which cannot but be felt by every member, that this court should not exercise appellate powers but in cases of clear and undoubted jurisdiction. If writs of error ought to be more extensively applied than they now can be under the existing rules and usages of law, we have a legislature always ready and able to afford every requisite remedy; and this, I presume, will be admitted to be the legitimate mode, if any there be, of enlarging the powers of this court, so as to embrace cases depending on discretion. But if we had the right, we ought to weigh well the mischief of creating the precedent of writs of error upon mere collateral and discretionary proceedings in the supreme court. If an execution in ejectment be irregularly issued, the court will set it aside, and restore the possession. This is a very ordinary case of jurisdiction; <em>(Dacres </em>v. Doe, 2 Blacks. <em>Rep. </em>892. <em>Goodright </em>v. <em>Noright, Barnes, </em>178. <em>Anon. 2 </em>Salk. 583.) and yet, upon the new doctrine, a writ of error would lie even for setting aside an execution. It must equally lie in every stage of a cause, and upon all those numberless acts and decisions to which I have alluded, and which spring up almost spontaneously in the progress of a suit. The bounds of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"56\">*56</page-number>supreme court would \u2019equally be \u25a0 enlarged;. and <em>'that </em>tribunal. would be oppressed with writs of error from the collateral decisions in each of the numerous courts of common.pleas.; for. they all have a like discretion, so far as may be incident to the cognizance of causes. I-f every order, in every such case,, founded. upon affidavits, be <em>v. judgment </em>on which error may be brought, it- must lie as well from a county court to the supreme court,. .as from the. supreme court to this.. And what a harvest would: then .arise for the activity of the, .profession <em>T No </em>'considerate.man can contemplate, without terror, the abuses of such an innovation, : A Avise lawyer will, no dptlbt, provide competent organs, through which all private rights may be pursued, and all private injuries redressed, .but, he will never open, too wide and too freely, the door to the never-ceasing. spirit of litigation.: If he-does, law-suits will beconhe\" a public grievance; Justice will be strangled by the very means devised for her protection; The delay, vexation, and- expense of suits, will become intolerable. We are all,, no, doubt, apprized of the heavy tax to suitors which appeals to this court produce, not only by the sum. in which the losing party is amerced, but by the heavy <em>. extra </em>fees which each party is obliged to pay to their .learned counsel; If we become,, therefore, fcoo loud and: seductive in our calls for business, and if we' open to ,the sharp-sightedness of avarice new avenues to litigation, we shall, most assuredly, perplex and agitate the whole current of jus- / tice. The love of gain, and the obstinacy of contention, -are active - as well as deep-rooted .principles in the human breast. No man who can well afford it will desist from contending, with his antagonist \u00f3n every point, and on every motion capable of doubt, until he has taken his chance of a final decision in this court,. The lover of quiet will hate' such endless contention. The man, of moderate means-will become \" faint in the contest. Small claims will be relinquished as .not worth the expense. The diffident suitor will yield, to the presumptuous, and the rights of the poor-will frequently be crushed -under the'' ovefbeariug dppKession of the. rich; ' \u25a0 . .. . . \u2022 :</p>\n<p id=\"b66-7\">\u25a0Nor must we indulge the hope, that this ca'n be only an imaginary picture. I know better,.. The business in the, supreme court \u00a1depending upon' affidavits,, and not.involving any final decision on the merits, is almost inconceivable. The average number of cases must certainly exceed five hundred, and, probably, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"57\">*57</page-number>may a thousand, which are annually brought before that court upon special motion, and decided upon affidavits. Each of those cases are applications to the sound discretion of the court, and writs of error will lie on all those cases,' and bring up all those enormous piles of affidavits, with just the same propriety that it will lie in this case. And can there be any member\u2019 of this court who can even think of such ah enterprise, without feeling <em>the whole head sick and the whole heart faint ? </em>Can this court, for a moment, wish, and much less meditate,, to depart from the precedents set us by the wise men who have gone before ns, and of opening the door of review to such a flood of extraneous matter depending on the sound discretion of the courts of law? It would require our whole time for the whole year. Even then we should fail; for,we could neither sustain the labour, nor command the attention. The attempt would \u25a0 terminate in public misery, and in our own confusion and disgrace. I speak, as to wise, men, <em>the truth in soberness, </em>and, I hope, without offence. This court was never organized for such purposes. It is too numerous to consult together. It is pressed with other and higher duties. It cannot be familiar with the practice of the courts. It is not their art and science. It has not been their education and discipline. This tribunal is not competent to fulfil the judicial function, unless it follows the letter and spirit \u00f3f the constitution, and confines its jurisdiction to \u201cquestions of law\u201d arising on final \u201cjudgments.\u201d Such cases almost always present single, dry, elementary points, and \u2022are,, in some sort, appeals to the moral sense and the common, reason of mankind.</p>\n<p id=\"b67-3\">The spirit of litigation requires checks rather than excitements. We may all recollect the impediments which the legislature; a few years ago, very wisely threw in the way of the prosecution of one species Of writs of error, I mean <em>certioraris </em>to justice\u2019s courts. The statute required the supreme court to disregard all defects of form in matter of law, and to decide on the very right pf the case; and-it limited the plaintiff\u2019s costs, if successful, to 25 dollars, but subjected hint to full costs, if he failed; Yet ther\u00e9 are, annually, upwards pf 200 <em>certioraris </em>brought to a hearing before the supreme court, and many of them not of 5 dollars in value, and scarcely one of them that will defray ffie expense of the suit. It is probable that there ar\u00e9 hundreds <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"58\">*58</page-number>beside which are-ne ver brought to a hearing, but the parties are \u2018coerced into an -accommodation, for fear of the expense. We have also, at this very session, had eightcases brought up on writs of error from the supreme' court and argued; and there wereseverai more ready for argument, if the court could have afforded the time. \u00cd mention these facts to show that the facility of suing out -writs of error, and\" the extent of the right, is already amply .sufficient. There is also one other fact &gt;vhich T beg to bring to the attention .Of the court. The new revised laws of thelast, session have, given an- encouragement to writs of error; .which is not known in <em>England, </em>and' was never before known here, and which I did not discover until I saw the rule as drawn up. the .other day, in the case of <em>Spencer </em>v. <em>Southwick. </em>I con-fess the discovery struck me with astonishment :and concern. I allude to the revised act, passed the 12th of last <em>April, </em>granting <em>to (he </em>.plaintiff in: error his costs in error, at the discretion of the court, on <em>reversal </em>of the judgment below. This is making an unfortunate defendant in error pay, not for his vexatious or false Clamour, but for the.mistake of the court below, on a point of law, and\" in <em>England, </em>and in this country, until now, it has always been thought unjust. The common law gave no costs Upon any-writ of error, and the statutes of 3 <em>H. </em>VII. and 8 and 9 <em>Wm. </em>III. (which were adopted here without alteration in -the. former revision of our laws) extended only to Cases of aft firmance of judgments, and that very reasonably, said the court of K. B., in <em>Wyvil </em>v. <em>Stapleton, (Str. </em>615.) and that very reasonably, also, said this court, in the case of <em>Le Guen </em>v. <em>Gouveneur &amp; Kemble, </em>in the year. 1800,(1 <em>Johns. Cases, </em>523.) when they un'anft mously concurred in opinion, that, on reversing a ju dgment or decree below, there were no costs in error; for the court said \u00abit Would, be-unreasonable to compel a person in case of a reversal, to pay costs for the error of .the court below.\u201d It lias, however, in the newly-revised statute, been ordained otherwise, but I hope and trust that this court, in its wisdom, will, at last, hat the door against writs of error \u2018 in untried- cases, where we have neither guide nor landmark.</p>\n<p id=\"b68-5\">. There is .also another fact on this subject of .costs, which ren!ders the soiight-for ihnovatioffth\u00e9 more\" dreadful. I allude now to the- new fee bill; passed, last <em>April, </em>which has advanced the costs in-litigated cases, in all: the courts below, 25. per cent, and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"59\">*59</page-number>in this court, in all cases, more than 100 per cent\u00bf, and that by' force of these additional words : \u201c and other necessary entries or proceedings in a cause.\u201d The added words I mean are <em>or </em>proceedings. They are, apparently, very innocent and harmless, but the losing party will find that they are pregnant with power. I know the latent energy of those words. I have witnessed it in taxation. They make the party who fails, pay for all the voluminous cases distributed, at th\u00e9 rate of 1 shilling for every <em>72 </em>words. In this very case, loaded as it is with affidavits, (and if error lies, they were all necessary,) I make the costs of the 33 error books amount to upwards of 300 dollars ;<footnotemark>(a)</footnotemark> and all this an innocent party is to pay, and for what ? for the error of the court below. Under all these alterations as to costs, would not this novel invention of bringing writs of error upon affidavits, become the source of the most tremendous oppression ? And when I said .that I could recommend the old established, law to the good sense and the good will of this court, I ask now have I not succeeded ?</p>\n<p id=\"b69-4\">They are extremely moderate and guarded in <em>England, </em>on the subject of writs of error. I will give to the .court, on this point, an interesting fact. According to <em>Colle\u2019s </em>and <em>Brown\u2019s </em>parliamentary reports, (and which have collected all the cases to be found,) there were from the year 1697 to the year <em>1778, </em>(a period of eighty years, and that, too, the most happy and flourishing in the <em>English </em>history,) only <em>sixty-four </em>cases in error brought to a hearing in the house of lords. We must conclude from this fact, that writs of error are there confined within very legitimate bounds, and that the suitor never presumes to speculate in new paths, nor to make large demands upon the credulity of the court. '</p>\n<p id=\"b69-6\">Indeed, when we take into consideration the cautious and temperate sprint which pervades the English. administration of justice, and the diffidence -with which their learned judges exercise the power of review, it is nq longer a matter of wonder that their system of law should be as renowned for its stability as for its wisdom. And, since Providence has permitted that system to be established here, in all its maturity and perfection, it ought to be the just pride, as it is the bounden-duty, of this <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"60\">*60</page-number>court, to transmit it unimpaired to posterity, and especially te' preserve the reputation which is due to the judicial character of this state. \", . \u25a0</p>\n<p id=\"b70-8\">I have now finished the question which I undertook to examine, and the following prepositions appear to me to be true:</p>\n<p id=\"b70-9\">1. That it was the Usual and proper course for the supreme, court to examine, upon affidavits the regularity of the <em>ouster </em>of <em>Briggs. </em>\" , .</p>\n<p id=\"b70-11\">2. That it. rested in their sound discretion, under all the circumstances of the cas\u00e9, whether or not they would order the re-restitution of Briggs. : ,</p>\n<p id=\"b70-13\">3. That such an Order, is not the subject of a writ of error ; and : '</p>\n<p id=\"b70-15\">4. That in justice and good policy, it ought not to be subject to one. \u25a0 ,</p>\n<p id=\"b70-17\">I am, accordingly, of opinion that the writ of error ought to Be quashed, . \u201e :</p>\n<p id=\"b70-18\">Lewis, Senator, was of opinion that a writ of error was properly brought in this case; and that the decision of the supreme court ought to be reversed. ,</p>\n<p id=\"Ao9\">Wilkin, Senator, Was of the same opinion.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b58-4\"><em> Lewis, </em>formerly Ch.

' , , ' ,</p>\n<p id=\"A27\">It is said that the decision of the supreme court was not a judgment. - . . ' :</p>\n<p id=\"b70-24\">. In the books and language Of the common law, the term judgment is applied in a, limited, technical sensed to certain de<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"61\">*61</page-number>terminations of the courts, which are enrolled in certain estaWished forms and phrases. No other decision or sentence, however important or final it may be, is denominated a judgment. It is equally true, that in pure <em>English, </em>and in the ordinary sense of the term, it is applied to any determination of a 'cause by a court of justice. The judgment of the court is the-, final sentence or decree of the court. The expressions, <em>\u201c </em>errors, correction of errors, judgments in the supreme court, and questions of law,\u201d which occur in the constitution, are not there Used as terms of art. They are used in the ordinary and general sense of those expressions. The constitution ought not to be construed in this or any other part, with technical strictness and severity. It is not the act of a bench of judges, or a bar of lawyers. It is the public act of a numerous body, in which the representatives of the people speak in the language of the people, and address themselves to all mankind. Their language should, therefore, be understood according to the ordinary and usual sense of the terms which they employ.</p>\n<p id=\"b71-5\">The jurisdiction of this court is derived from the constitution, and the right of appealing to it is given by the constitution. - The court and its jurisdiction, and the right of appealing to it, are unknown to the common law. They owe their origin and existence to the constitution; and the constitution is entirely an innovation upon the .common law. Hence, the jurisdiction of this court is to be determined by the constitution itself, and not by expositions or definitions derived from the common law.</p>\n<p id=\"ACu\">I also reject from this, view.of the question, the statute con* cerning this court. The statute organizes the court, according to the\" constitution, with such jurisdiction as the constitution had prescribed. The nature and extent of its jurisdiction are to be sought and found in the constitution itself. The powers of this court are as much to be found in the constitution, as the powers of the governor, the council of revision, or any authority created by the constitution.</p>\n<p id=\"b71-11\">The constitution appears to me to provide, that the supreme judicial power of the state shall be vested in this'court; that it shall have appellate jurisdiction onlyand that it shall hear and finally determine all causes which hav\u00e9 been/Ietermined in the other, courts, and may be removed to this court for revision. These are not, indeed, the expressions of the constitution, but <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"62\">*62</page-number><em>i </em>ugfi them as perf\u00e9etly equivalent in. sense and meaning to th&lt;W used, in the constitution. The authors of the constitution obviously-meant, that one supreme tribunal should % erected,, ta which all courts then, existing, or which might afterwards be created, should be subordinate; and that the administration of justice in those courts should not be final, but, should be subject to the revision of this: supreme tribunal. The supreme cburfe and the court of chancery existed beforeand all their declsions, of every kind and name, were final. The object of those who formed the'constitution evidently, was* that those courts should no longer possess that final jurisdiction. They, therefore, erected this court with an appellate jurisdiction, as broad and ample as the jurisdiction of all other courts. They left the supreme court its name, but they deprived it of that supremacy from which its name was originally derived.</p>\n<p id=\"AVO\">\u25a0 The constitution, indeed, does , not , alter the forms of proceeding, or the modes of administering justice, which were before in' use. But if any form of proceeding, or mode of administering justice, would . have before \u00e9xeluded the right of appeal,.then that form of mode is now so far altered by the constitution, that an appeal must be allowed. The right of appeal, given by the constitution, cannot be abridged by the common ia w&gt; for so much Of that law as interferes with the right of op-4 peal, is abrogated by the constitution itself. -</p>\n<p id=\"b72-5\">\u2022All judgments of - the supreme court, by which I mean in the sense of the constitution, all final determinations of causes in that court,, are,- then, subject to an appeal and revision in this court, V -1</p>\n<p id=\"AYg\">But it is said, that if we depart/froin the technical definition of a judgment by the common, law, every decision or order of the supreme court will be subject to appeal. . This will not be the consequence.. Orders merely' interlocutory or auxiliary to the prosecution of a suit, are not determinations of a cause.. No appeal can take place until the cause has terminated in the supreme court. This was the\" common law respecting writs- of error. A writ of error did not remove the cause until final judgment had been rendered. \" This was not: altered by the conytitution, because it was not necessary to the right of appeal that it shoul\u00e9 be altered, ' The. party .against- Whom the -supreme court may&gt; decide has the benefit of the constitutional provision, if he .is allowed to remove jthe -cause after the. determination- of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"63\">*63</page-number>that court.. The rule of the common law, that a cause cannot be remoued by writ of error, \u00fantil after it has been determined in ,the inferior court, therefore remains unaltered. This is an answer to all that has been said concerning orders in the progress of a cause, rules upon parties and officers, and orders incidental to the main purpose of an action.</p>\n<p id=\"b73-6\">The proceedings of the supreme court, in this cause, were judicial proceedings, commenced, conducted, and terminated before them. One of the parties was called into court to answer the complaint of the other, and the court, having heard them both, decreed that the party who was in possession should be put out, and that the other should be put in. What may be the technical or most proper name for such proceedings, it is not here necessary to inquire or determine. It is enough that these proceedings have all the essential characteristics of a suit or action, and that the court have closed the litigation by a definitive decision between the parties. Whether the decision is denominated a judgment, an order, an award, a decree, or a sentence, is very immaterial. They would all be but different names for the same thing, and, perhaps, any of them may be applied to this decision without violence. By whatever terms these proceedings may be described, they were, in substance and essence a suit by one party to recover the possession of lands from another. By whatever name the decision may .be called, it is, in effect, a final judgment by which the suit is terminated, and the subject in controversy is awarded to one party against the other. The party who has been adjudged to lose his possession, may be aggrieved by this determination, and as' it is the final determination of a cause in the supreme court, he has a constitutional right.to bring the cause to this court for a final decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b73-7\">It is said that this is not a record. I believe it to be true that no record like this can be found in the books of the common law. \" But if a record be a history of the proceedings in a cause, then this is a record. It is the only record that can be made where proceedings like these take place. The constitutional right of the party to his appeal does not depend upon any <em>English </em>definition of a record. It depends upon the fact that his cause has been determined against him.</p>\n<p id=\"b73-8\">This question is, therefore, not to be determined by technical definitions and verbal criticism, or by the terms and phrases in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"64\">*64</page-number>which judgments have been, or may be, expressed, The true inquiry, is, whether the judicial proceeding .constitutes a cause -by itself, and has received its final decision in the supreme court. If soj the case contemplated by the constitution exists, -and1 the cause may be brought to this court for revision.</p>\n<p id=\"ALs\">It is truly said-, that the. proceedings of the supreme court in this, case were summary. This cannot affect the fight of appeal. . Whether the. proceedings were summary or plenary, that right-equally- <em>exists. </em>If the proceedings\" be an action, or have the effect of an action, ,the appeal must be allowed. Whatever may be the mode of proceeding adopted by the supreme court,. -whether formal and Usual, or extraordinary and summary, it can make no determination of the ca\u00edise which will not be subject. <em>to the </em>constitutional revision of. this court. Whether the mode of, proceeding has the sanction of antiquity, or is altogether new, the right of appeal exists in the party, and the appellate jurisdiction exists. in this 'court. If the mode of proceeding, adopted by the supreme court, be summary, or illegal, that mode of proceeding may be the very grievance of which. the party condemned has to complain.. All causes determined in the supreme .court, whatever may be the course-or mode, of proceeding, by which \u25a0 they may. be conducted or determined, are subject to the appellate jurisdiction of this court.</p>\n<p id=\"A9c\">It is also said, that if this, appeal be allowed, this court may be drawn into the trial of facts.' - The answer to'this, objection will be' found in the principles already stated, , If the supreme court entertain a cause in which they try and determine facts, it \u00a1does not follow that their -decision is final, The right of appeal still exists, and it. is made the duty of this court to hear and decide the cause upon an appeal. If the supreme court should try an issue of fact, without a jury, in an action of trespass or debt, it i would,be -the duty of this court, to entertain the cause Upon an appeal,, and either to decide that such a mode of trying the fact is illegal, or if. it tie-legal, then to try the fact upon the same evidence on which the supreme court judged and decided,</p>\n<p id=\"Ajm\">. Jt .is said, that the supreme court has a superintending au~ tliority, over all the courts of law. inferior to itself. This is true,, and it ought to .tie so, \u2022 The superintending authority, as it is called, is, in other words, an appellate jurisdiction, over off inferior' jurisdictions.#. It is. exerted when a party, aggrieved <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"65\">*65</page-number><em>by </em>a determination, or some proceeding of the inferior court, complains to the supreme court, and brings the cause before them for their decision. By whatever form or mode of proceeding this is done, it is, in substance, and effect, an appeal from one court to the other. The supreme court has no original jurisdiction in cases of forcible entries or detainers. The original jurisdiction in those cases is vested in the justices of the peace; but their proceedings may be removed to the supreme court. In this case the supreme court held, that no accident could deprive them of -their superintending authority, or appellate jurisdiction. An accident, like the death of th.e justice, might defeat the ordinary modes of proceeding, or render them ineffectual; but the party aggrieved was not, for that reason, to lose the redress which the supreme court might give him, upon an appeal to them. Their appellate jurisdiction must be exercised, because the exercise of It was required from them by the party. They therefore held, that if the writ of <em>certiorari </em>would not bring the cause to them, the cause must come in some other way. I do not now inquire whether they adopted a legal or proper mode of proceeding. They also held, that whether the judicial proceedings of the justice were recorded or not, they must still exert their superintending or appellate authority. Whether there was a technical record, or a technical judgment, before the justice, or not, were questions which the supreme court thought had no concern with the right of the party to his appeal, or their right to entertain the appeal, and revise the cause. When they speak of their own interference upon affidavits, they gay it is a matter of necessity. If it was a matter of necessity, it was so because the right of appeal from the justice to the supreme court could not be frustrated by any cause whatever. The supreme court, indeed, appear to have held, that nothing whatever could prevent the right of appeal, or the exercise of their own appellate authority. In all this, the supreme court took a just view of the nature of appellate jurisdiction; and they rightly concluded, that any particular or extraordinary mode of proceeding in the inferior court, could not deprive the superior court of its appellate jurisdiction.</p>\n<p id=\"Aiz\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"66\">*66</page-number><em>if </em>these views of the question- between the justice\u2019s court and supreme court were \u2022 correct, they are fully applicable to the question between the supreme court and this court.The appellate jurisdiction of this court is as ample as the appellate jurisdiction, or superintending authority of the supreme court over the inferior courts. If necessity will authorize, a sum\u00bb, to\u00e1ry. mode of proceeding, in the supreme court, to enable them to exercise their jurisdiction, it must be a strange necessity, if it should, at the same time, make that jurisdiction inai. It would be a necessity that there should be one appeal, and no more than ;one. It. would be, at otice, a necessity to give jurisdiction to the supreme court, and a..necessity to- take away jurisdiction from this court. The constitution ordains; that there shall be no such necessity in this state. If it be necessary that the supreme court should exercise its jurisdiction over such . proceedings, and in this manner, the necessary consequence is, that this court must exercise-its jurisdiction in the same case. I say the necessary consequence, because the necessity or obligation to entertain the cause in this- court is of the highest kind; since it is derived from the supreme law, the constitution itself.</p>\n<p id=\"b76-3\">It will be understood that I have, throughout, used the word appeal, in the-general sense of the term. The. technical distinctions between- the different modes, of appeal, whether by writ of . error, writ of <em>certiorari, </em>1 or otherwise, are foreign to the purpose of the present inquiry.</p>\n<p id=\"ACMk\">I am clearly of opinion, that this court has jurisdiction in this case, and that the cause is now properly before this court for its determination. ,</p>\n<p id=\"A8j\">The judgment of the justice seems to have been a conviction of <em>Briggs, </em>and nothing more. The strict duty of the supreme, court Was to reverse or affirm the judgment of the justice. If they reversed or. quashetjl the judgment or conviction of the justice, it was not a necessary consequence that the possession should be restored. The party prosecuting before the supreme court'could not demand restitution as his-right. The court might grant it-or not, as a matter of discretion.- The title is not here in question. The object-of the law, in such cases, is to protect persons who are in quiet possession, from violence. It appears that there had been, game struggle between these. parties, in which they wrested, or attempted to yfrest, fhe pos<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"67\">*67</page-number>Session from each other, at different times. In deciding Which of them shall have the possession, it seems proper, in such circumstances, to look back to the commencement of the contest, and to give preference to the party who had the first peaceable possession. The first quiet possession was in <em>Clason, </em>and his tenants; and it appears that <em>Shotmell's </em>possession was gained surreptitiously.</p>\n<p id=\"b77-3\">As it does not appear that the possession was changed by any judicial proceeding of the justice ; as the first peaceable possession was in <em>Clason ; </em>and as the case is, in many respects# involved in obscurity and contradiction, I am of opinion that the possession should not have been adjudged to Shotwell. To award the possession of land from one party to another, is a sentence highly important to both. The advantage of possession to either party may be great. \u2022 It is redress which, I think, ought not to have been given to <em>Shotmell, </em>as an act of discretion.</p>\n<p id=\"b77-4\">Entertaining this opinion upon the merits of the case, I do not find it necessary to consider or express an opinion whether the mode adopted by the supreme court, in hearing and deciding the cause, upon the affidavits of the parties and their witnesses, was proper or not.</p>\n<p id=\"b77-5\">My voice will accordingly be, that the judgment of the supreme court, awarding the possession to <em>Shotmell, </em>ought to be reversed.</p>\n<p id=\"b77-11\">Elmendorf, Bxoodgoqd, and Van Bur\u00e9n, concurred with Lewis and Sanford, Senators, that a writ of error lies in this case, and that the judgment of the supreme court ought to be reversed.</p>\n<p id=\"b77-12\">Cochran, Wendexl, and Stewart, Senators, were of opinion that the writ of error ought to be' quashed; and that, if it would lie, they were of opinion that the judgment of the supreme court ought to be affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b77-13\">Bishop, Bxoom, Cxarke, Dayton, Rouse, Smith, Str'a-Nahan, Swift, Tabor, and Van Bryck, Senators,<footnotemark>*</footnotemark> opinion that the writ of error was well brought, and judgment of the supreme court ought to be reversed. were of .i , that the</p>\n<p id=\"Au1\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"68\">*68</page-number>It was thereupon ordered and adjudged,<footnotemark>*</footnotemark> that- as well the judgment of the supreme .court in. this matter,\" as the award -of re-restitutidn thereupon made,\" be-reversed,, annulled, &amp;,G,\u00a1.; and that <em>Isaac Clason </em>be restoi\u2019ed'to the possession of the premises whereof re-restitution was awarded as. afores,aid,, and to. all things he-hath lost-by occasion of the judgment aforesaid, and the said award thereupon made ; and further, that the said <em>Isaac Clason </em>recover- against \u2022 .the said <em>Qilhert Shotmdl,, </em>ns well his costs- and -charges by him- -sustained and expended in and about his defence in the said supreme court, as his costs and charges by reason of -the prosecution of the writ of error in this court, to be taxed by the clerk of this court;;, and that the record be remitted, Ssb\u00bb \u25a0 . \u25a0</p>\n<p id=\"Afm\">judgment of reversal</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"AcQ\"><em> For reversing, </em>17. <em>For affirming, </em>5.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"A2uh\"> <em>April 7, </em>1814.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
