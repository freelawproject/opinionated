Please to write us, if the satisfactory security is received.\u201d On the 18th <em>July, </em>1811, the plaintiffs again wrote to the defendants, mentioning their last letter, and say, \u201c Please inform us whether the security is received, and the goods delivered, by the first convenient opportunity.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b311-7\">On the 18th <em>July, </em>the defendants wrote to the plaintiffs as follows : \u201c Mr. <em>Gillet, </em>sometime last week, wrote us that he would, in a few weeks, send about seven tons of ashes, which we could (if we thought proper) ship to New-York, to be delivered to you, subject to his order. We have now put on board the sloop <em>Cornelia, </em>captain Staat's, twenty-six casks of ashes, which we have directed him to send to an inspector\u2019s store, and deliver the bills to you, which you will have the goodness to receipt for, subject to Mr. <em>Gillet\u2019s </em>direction. It is probable, at the next trip of the sloop, we may have more to ship you for MrGillet. We send these now, in case he should require them to be shipped before the sloop goes down again, say the next month. You will, of course, not dispose of the ashes until you receive Mr. <em>Gillet's </em>orders.\u201d\u2014\u201c P. S.

On the 1st <em>November, </em>the defendants, in answer, wrote to the plaintiffs that they had received no communication from Mr. <em>Gillet </em>since the summer months; that they had. been informed that Mr. <em>Gillet </em>had gone to <em>Baltimore ; </em>that no more ashes, or other property, had been left by him with them; and they promise to make further inquiries as to the circumstances, &amp;c. of Mr. <em>Gillet, </em>and inform the plaintiffs. On the 12th <em>February, </em>1812, the plaintiffs\u2019 attorney wrote to the defendants, informing them, that the plaintiffs held them responsible for the value of the goods left in their hands; that ashes would then sell to advantage, and suggesting, for their consideration, the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"302\">*302</page-number>propriety of giving orders to'the plaintiffs t\u00f3 sell the ashes,\u2019 and appropriate the proce\u00e9ds towards'the payment of their claim or\u00ed the defendants.' This'Ietter was hot answered by'the defendants, and, o\u00eda the 3d of August,-1812, a formal demand was made, on behalf of the plaintiffs, on the' defendants,\" for the -goods placed in their handstand which they refused to deliver.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b312-4\">'\u00bf\u2022The-receipt-Af-the plaintiffs' -to the defendants, for the ashes, was .dated the 27th of <em>July, </em>1811, fof.\u201c twenty-six barrels of pot-ashes, and one barrel of caustic,\u00e1s per bill of <em>J. E. Bogert, </em>which are held by us for account \u00f3f M.'-Gillet.\u201d The ashes remained in the store <em>of Bogert, </em>the inspector, until <em>December, </em>1813, when he sold them, -according to the- directions of the statute, and paid the proceeds into the hands of-the state treasurer.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"At1\">- A witness for the-defendants, a clerk in their store, testified, that the captain of the sloop who brought' the goods for <em>Gillet, </em>offered to deliver them to the 'defendants, on their accepting two -drafts drawn on them by Gillet, each for three hundred- and ninety-seven dollars and \"sixty-six cents, one at four months, and the other at eight months, which th\u00e9 def\u00e9ndants refused to accept ; but observed, that they had some ashes of <em>G'illeBs </em>in store, and that they would receive^the goods on Storage, and retain them until they should receive sufficient ashes from him to pay the amount of the drafts* for which they would not, make theniselves liable. The goods were then delivered to the defendants, who gave the receipt for them above mentioned. The witness stated, that. <em>Gillet </em>made frequent applications to the defendants for the goods, but' they refused to deliver them, until they had received a sufficient quantity of ashes to secure the \u2019 amount of the drafts; and that, on the 18th of <em>July, </em>1811, having, received a sufficient quantity of ashes to secure the amount, they delivered the goods-to <em>Gillet, </em>and sent the ashes to the plaintiffs.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b312-6\">it appeared that the price of ashes in <em>New-York, </em>in <em>July </em>and <em>August, </em>1811, was n'inety-five d\u00f3li\u00e1rs p\u00e9r ton; and in <em>October </em>and <em>November, </em>of the same year, eighty dollars per ton. The amount for which they were sold by the inspector, was five hundred and eighty-three dollars and forty-two cents.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b312-7\">\u25a0 A verdict' was- taken for the plaintiffs, for nine hundred and \u00e9ighty-nine dollars and twenty-thf\u00e9e cents, subject to the opinion of the court, oh the case above stated-'</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b313-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"303\">*303</page-number>Slosson, for the plaintiffs.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"ARqs\">The goods of the plaintiffs were deposited with the defendants, to be delivered to Mr <em>'.Gillet, </em>only on the condition that the defendants received ample Seenrity ; and of the adequacy of that security, they alone were to be the judges. They were bound, by the tenor and effect of their engagement, to take for the plaintiffs, adequate and unconditional security. Under a perfect understanding, however, and full knowledge of all the circumstances, they took security, insufficient in itself, and clogged with the condition of being-subject to the order of <em>Gillet. </em>The defendants, in their letter, did not pretend that the potashes they sent were sufficient security ; yet, they delivered the goods to Gillet, which had been deposited with them.</p>\n<p data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b313-4\">By the delivery of the goods to <em>G., </em>in violation of the terms of the deposite, the defendants must be considered as having converted them to. their own use; and after a demand and refusal^ to deliver them to the plaintiffs, there can be no question that the action of <em>trover </em>lies. The case of <em>Syed </em>v. <em>Hay,</em><footnotemark><em>*</em></footnotemark><em> </em>in <em>England, </em>and of <em>Laplace </em>v. <em>Aupoix,</em><footnotemark><em>\u2020</em></footnotemark><em> </em>and <em>Bristol </em>v. <em>Burt,</em><footnotemark><em>\u2021</em></footnotemark><em> </em>in this court, show the principles of this action, and that it will lie in such a</p>\n<p data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b313-5\">But it may be said, perhaps, that the plaintiffs have-acquiesced in, or adopted, the acts of the defendants, their agents or bailees. But there can be no adoption, unless there has been a full and perfect disclosure of the facts. If there be a concealment of facts, the principal cannot be.bound by any supposed adoption.<footnotemark>\u00a7</footnotemark> Now, the defendants did misrepresent facts; we do not say, wilfully, or intentionally; but if there-was any erroneous statement, or concealment, which might mislead the judgment of the plaintiffs, they cannot be held to have adopted the conduct of the defendants. In their letter of the 18th of <em>July, </em>the defendants did explicitly hold out to the plaintiffs the expectation that more ashes were to be shipped to them, and that the twenty-six barrels were not the whole of the security they were to receive. That expectation, however, was never realized.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b313-8\"><em>Brinckerhoff and Wells, </em>contra.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AX-P\">The agency of the defendants was gratuitous. The bailment to them was a naked bailment; and it is merely a question as to <em>good faith </em>on their part. Has the agent honestly, and in good faith, exercised the power vested in him by his principal <em>l </em>The plaintiffs gave to the defendants a discretion in the exercise of their judgment/as to the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"304\">*304</page-number>su\u00ed\u00edicienGy \u00b0f ffie security to be received on the delivery of the goods to <em>Gillet. </em>\u2018If the defendants, have exercised their judgnient honestly and fairly, they ought not to be made ansxverable, if that security lias proved' deficient.</p>\n<p data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"pA_O\">On the 18th of <em>July, </em>they xvrote to the plaintiffs, and informed, them of what .they had done. If the plaintiffs were dissatisfied with their conduct, they ought immediately to have expressed 'their disapprobation, so'as to put the defendants on their guard, and to give.'them an opportunity of securing themselves,\" through <em>\u2019GillS, </em>in Case they had made themselves responsible to the plaintiffs, , Considering, the .circumstances tinder , which the defendants accepted of the agency, it was peculiarly the duty of the plaintiffs to have instantly answered the letter of the defendants, and expressed \u00c9h\u00e9ir opinion of their conduct. On the contrary, they continued silent until the 29th of <em>October, </em>xx'hicli, we contend, amounts to an assent to their acts. It is a general principle of laxv,<footnotemark>(a)</footnotemark> and which has been recognised by this court,<footnotemark>*</footnotemark> that where an agent, bv letter, gives an account .of what lie has done, and that letter is not answered by the principal, if lamounts to an approbation of the conduct of the agent.</p>\n<p data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"pA_ZV\">*\"~But ive contend that <em>trover </em>does not lie in this c\u00e1se. The gobd5 Were delivered to the defendants, with directions to del\u2018ver them over to <em>Gillet, </em>on receiving satisfactory security. The defendants having received security which they believed sufficient, ahd, delivered\u2019 over the goods, the property of the plaintiffs immediately ceased. Their only remedy, therefore, if any,, must be an action on the case against the defendants, as their agents* for exceeding their authority. In such an actian, the defendants, if they have not acted <em>bona fide, </em>would be liable only to the damages actually sustained by the plaintiffs. But in <em>trover </em>they must answer for the value of the goo^s.</p>\n<footnote data-order=\"21\" data-type=\"footnote\" id=\"x999-1\" label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"pAuk\"> <em>Term Rep. 260.</em></p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote data-order=\"22\" data-type=\"footnote\" id=\"x999-2\" label=\"\u2020\">\n<p id=\"pAqv\"> Johns.

That trover cannot be sustained in such a case; and, 2d. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"305\">*305</page-number>That the plaintiffs, after a knowledge of all the facts, adopted the defendants\u2019 acts.</p>\n<p id=\"b315-5\">The plaintiffs\u2019 counsel relies on thb case of <em>Seyd </em>v. <em>Hay, </em>(4 <em>T. R. </em>260.) as to the form of the action. In that case, the owner of goods on boardtof a vessel directed the captain not to land them on the wharf, which he promised not to do, but afterwards delivered them to the wharfinger, for the owner\u2019s use, under the pretence that the wharfinger had a lien on them for wffiarfage; the court held the delivery to be a conversion, there being no right to wharfage. The case of <em>Dufresne </em>v. <em>Hutchinson, </em>(3 <em>Taunt. Rep. </em>117.) decides, that if a broker, authorized to sell goods for a particular price, sells them at an inferior price, he is not liable in trover, and that the proper remedy is an action on the case. The court do not think it necessary to decide this point on the present occasion, nor do they intend to do so- It appears to me, however, that there is serious objection to the form of the action, without impugning the case of <em>Seyd </em>v. <em>Hay: </em>in that case the defendant was guilty of a direct breach of orders, contrary, too, to his promise 5 here, the defendants were authorized to deliver the goods to <em>Gillet, </em>on receiving property amply sufficient to secure the plaintiffs their demand: this necessarily referred it to their judgment, what was sufficient property; and for misbehaving in this trust, it seems to me that case, and not trover, is the appropriate remedy. At all events, the form of action ought not to deprive the defendants of any ground of defence.</p>\n<p id=\"b315-6\">On the 18th of <em>July, </em>1811, the defendants informed the plaintiffs, that they had, on the 17th of that month, delivered <em>Gillet </em>the last parcel of the goods, and that they had received from him 26 casks of ashes, which were placed, at the same time, under the plaintiffs\u2019 control, subject to <em>Gillet\u2019s </em>order as to their sale. The plaintiffs rest satisfied until the 29th of <em>October, </em>and then, for the first time, ask for information, what other property <em>Gillet </em>had placed in their hands when he took the last of the goods. The cases of <em>Codwise </em>v. <em>Hacker, </em>(1 <em>Caines\u2019 Rep. </em>539.) and <em>Towle </em>&amp; <em>Jackson </em>v <em>Stevenson, </em>(1 <em>Johns. Cases, </em>110.) are authority for saying, that when a principal, with a knowledge of all the facts, adopts the acts of his agent, though these acts are contrary to his duty and his instructions, he shall not after-wards impeach his conduct; and this principle is peculiarly apto a case like the present; for had the principal disap<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"306\">*306</page-number>proved, the defendants might, by their vigilance, for aught <em>w&amp; </em>j\u00ednoW) secured themselves. The lapse of time after' the information that the last parcel had been delivered, and that only 26 barrels of ashes had been deposited, was sufficient to denote to the defendants the plaintiffs\u2019 approbation of, or. acquiescence in, xvhat they had done; and besides, the defendants had a right to infer, that <em>Gillet </em>had communicated to the plaintiffs his orders as to the disposition of the ashes, and made arrangements xvith them as to the debt. It is a salutary rule, in relation! to agencies, that when the principal is informed of what has been done, he must dissent, and give notice in a reasonable time, or, otherwise, his assent to what ;has been done shall be presumed.</p>\n<p id=\"A46\">Judgment for defendants'.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
