The statute of 1782<footnotemark>*</footnotemark> converted all estates- tail into estates in <em>fee simple; </em>and the act of <em>23d-February, </em>1786,<footnotemark>\u2020</footnotemark> declares that all -persons seised in fee tail shall 'be adjudged to become seised \u201c in fee simple absolute.\u201d The first Statute abolishing estates tail restored estates as they existed before- the English statute <em>de donis conditionalibus ; (West. </em>2. 13 <em>Edw. </em>I. c. 1.) and such ..\u00a1estates became conditional fees, at the common law: if <em>Mary Hicks, </em>the first devisee,, had had issue; the estate would have become a fee simple absolute, but as she died without issue, the . land became vested in <em>StephenHicks, </em>the next devisee, as a fee conditional at common law; and while he- was possessed of such . conditional fee, the act of the 23d of <em>February,, </em>1786, converted it into a fee simple, absolute, and while seised , of such estate; he-devised it to <em>Mary, </em>the wife of the lessor.</p>\n<p data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b183-2\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"173\">*173</page-number>The question is, what was the operation and effect of the statute of 1782 on estates tail? We say, it converted them into <em>conditional </em>fees ; and that was the reason why, in the act of 1786, the word \u00ab absolute\u201d was added to the words fee simple. If this construction of that act is correct, then the land never escheated to the people, and the private act of 1787 could have no effect on the title of the lessors of the plaintiff. The act of 1782 operated only on estates then in existence, and not prospectively ; but the act of 1786 is different. It declares that all persons who are, or, if the act of 1782 had not been passed, would be, seised in fee tail, shall be deemed to be seised in fee simple absolute. If after 1782, <em>Stephen Hicks </em>was seised of a fee simple absolute, the act of 1786 prevented any <em>escheat, </em>and the claim of the defendant must fail.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b183-3\"><em>Slosson </em>and <em>Hoffman, </em>contra.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AkiY\">The special act of 1787, was manifestly passed with a view to vest the estate in <em>Richard Penn Hicks, </em>according to the intent of the devisor; and so far as principles of equity are to have influence, the court will be disposed to carry the act of the legislature into effect, as according with the intent of the devisor.</p>\n<p data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b183-4\">While the act of 1782 was in force, <em>Thomas Hicks, </em>the devisor, died; and it is said, that as that act was not prospective, and he died after it was passed, <em>Mary, </em>the first devisee, took an estate tail, which, by the act of 1786, was converted into a fee simple absolute. In construing statutes, the court will endeavour to give every part effect, according to the intent of the legislature. <em>Verba ita sunt intelligenda ut res magis valeat quam pereaU </em>The words of the act are all prospective, and apply to all cases which should thereafter arise.</p>\n<p data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b183-6\">The intent of the legislature is, as expressed in the title of the act, to abolish estates tail; and if there were any doubt of that intent, the title of the act might be taken in aid of the construction. It would be a very rigid construction to say} that the act was not prospective. The court will feel more disposed to consider it as wholly prospective, rather than retrospective, or as taking away existing rights.</p>\n<p data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b183-7\">But it is said, that the expression of the act of 1786, fee simple <em>absolute, </em>is different from the act of 1782, from which it is inferred; that the estates tail were, after the act of 1782, considered as fees <em>conditional\u25a0&gt; </em>It is true, that before the statute <em>dt </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"174\">*174</page-number><em>donis, </em>where 'there Was a conveyance or devis\u00e9 to aman and the heirs of his body, if he had heirs, the condition was performed, and the estate became absolute, or if he had no heirs; it- reverted' to the donor. ' . i</p>\n<p data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"ASH\">The act of 1782 uses the words fee simple. <em>Coke</em><footnotemark><em>*</em></footnotemark><em> </em>says, a fee simple is where a man has lands, &amp;c. to hold to-him and his heirs for ever,, The word <em>fee </em>denotes an estate of inheritance, and the word: <em>simple </em>added to it, denotes it to be an \u00e9stote absolute and general, and as contradistinguished from a fee conditional, or fee tail, The words in both acts mean precisely the same thing.</p>\n<p data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b184-6\">Then <em>Mary, </em>the'first devisee, being, by effect of the act'of 1782, seised of, a fee simple, or fee simple absolute, and dying without heirs; the estate escheated. Where a person dies Without heirs, the \u00e9state, on the principle of the feudal law, reverts to the sovereign or people, as <em>the ultimus Imres. </em>The estate, In such, case, becomes vested in the people,, without an inquest of.office.<footnotemark>*</footnotemark></p>\n<p data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b184-10\">1 There were ,other and sufficient r\u00e9asons for repealing the act of 1782, beside the one which lias been mentioned. By the 7th section of th\u00e9 act of 1786, repealing the former act, it is provided,\" \u201c that all descents and conveyances, which have happened or been made since the passing of the said act, thereby repealed,. shall take effect according t\u00f3 the said act.\u201d So that\" the legislature clearly intended to preserve entire the effect and operation of the act of I782.i The devise of <em>Thomas Iiicks, </em>Which took effect subsequent \u00a1to-the'passing of the act of 1782, was a conveyance. Every transfer of property, by the atit of the party, is a conveyance; or purchase. On the death of <em>Hicks, </em>the statute of 1782 Operated on the estate tail; converted it into an estate in fee simple; and by the law of escheat that, estate was vested in or conveyed to the people, for want of heirs.,</p>\n<p data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b184-13\">- It is hot to be presumed that, the legislature, by the act of 1786, meant to part with any right or estate in them. That is not to be taken by implication or inference; There must be clear and express words to warrant such a conclusi\u00f3n.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"Ajp\"><em>T. A. Emmet, </em>in reply.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"21\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AgHv\">By the act of 1787, the legislature expressly guard against any imposition; and convey only such right as may have vested1 in the state by escheat, reserving all rights existing in others. The act of 1786 was not passed to alter <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"175\">*175</page-number>or amend that of 1782, but to repeal it. The law maxim, as to r the construction of statutes, is not applicable to a repealed act, for it was no doubt repealed for its imperfection and insufficiency. There is an obvious difference in the language of the two statutes. The one acts only on existing estates tail, and the .other operates prospectively on all future estates. It was because the act of 1782 did not act prospectively, that the act of 1786 was passed. We admit, that the legislature may have intended, by the act of 1782J to abolish all estates tail, future as well as present; but not having used proper language to show that intent, it became necessary to pass another act for the purpose. The last act seems to have been passed to meet the very case of the devisor; for if the law of 1782 had not been passed, he would have been seised in fee tail.</p>\n<p data-order=\"22\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b185-5\">The 7th section of the act of 1786, repealing that of 1782, provides that \u201c all descents and conveyances which have happened, or been made, since the passing of the said act, hereby repealed, shall take effect according to the said act.\u201d It does not say all <em>escheats </em>shall take effect. The rights of the citizens are saved and preserved, but the rights of the people, as to escheats, are not saved.</p>\n<footnote data-order=\"23\" data-type=\"footnote\" id=\"x999-1\" label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b180-8\"> Sess. 9. c. 12. 1 Gr.

J.</author>\n<p id=\"A7S\">delivered the opinion of the court. (Spencer, J. dissenting.) The grounds upon which the plaintiff\u2019s counsel rested their argument, to show that the act of 1782 did not reach their case, were,</p>\n<p id=\"b185-7\">1st. That the act did not operate prospectively.</p>\n<p id=\"b185-8\">2d. That it did not give to the tenant jn tail, a fee simple absolute, but only operated as a repeal to the statute <em>de donis, </em>leaving the estate a conditional fee, as at common law.</p>\n<p id=\"b185-9\">With respect to the first objection ; it is true that the act is not' drawn with skill and accuracy; and, according to strict grammatical construction, may be liable to the criticism made by the plaintiff\u2019s counsel. But the sense and meaning of the act, and the intention of the legislature, cannot be mistaken. It is a well-established principle in the exposition of statutes, that every part is to be considered, and the intention of the legislature to be extracted from the whole, and when great inconvenience will result from a particular construction, that construction is to be avoided, unless the meaning qf the legislature be plain. (2 <em>Cranch, </em>386.)</p>\n<p id=\"AEp\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"176\">*176</page-number>It is a first principle in legislation, that all laws are to operate prospectively. And it appears to me that it would be doing .great violence to <em>the </em>intention of the legislature, <em>to </em>limit this act to estates tail then existing. This would be comparatively doing nothing. It would be obviously, against the general scope and object of the statute, which was to. abolish entails. It is a settled rule of construction, that when the words of a statute are obscure or doubtful, the intention of the legislature is to be resorted to in order to find Out the meaning of the words. This intention is sometimes to be collected from the canse or necessity of making the statute. And whenever the intention can be discovered, it ought to be followed, with reason and discretion* in the construction,1 although it seems contrary to the letter of the statute. (6 <em>Bac. Ab. </em>384.) If this be a. sound rule of interpretation, and Of which, there can be; no doubt, it must apply with great force to the ease before us. And,, indeed* the. intention of the legislature is so obvious, that it was not pretended to be denied by the plaintiff ?s, counsel in the argument. The act Of 1787, by which the premises, in question are given to <em>Richard Penn Hicks, </em>is a strong legislative construction of the act of 1782. For it was -obviously made for the express purpose of carrying into effect the will of <em>Thomas Hicks,, </em>according to the intention of the testator? It alleges, by way of recital, that were it not for the late acts abolishing entails, <em>Richard Pe\u00f1n Hicks </em>Would have become seised in fee tail general of the premises in question. But by such law the estate in fee tail general, devised to <em>Mary Hicks, </em>was-'converted into a fee simple* and she -having been born out of lawful wedlock could have no heirs, by means whereof the lands escheated to the people: It is n\u00f3 answer to \"this argument, that this is a private act, and the suggestion made by the party. This is true where the suggestions are matters of fact, but that is' not the case here. There was an alleged construction of a public act, and which the legislature were bound to look to and adopt or reject, as in their judgment the act would warrant. And if the act of 1782 did not extend to this case, most certainly the act of 1787'o\u00fcght not to have been passed. In my opinion, therefore, the act of 1782 must have a prospective operation, and apply to the will in question.</p>\n<p id=\"b186-3\">Nor <em>is </em>the Mother ground of argument, in my judgment, better founded. This seems to have been suggested by the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"177\">*177</page-number>difference in the phraseology between the acts of 1782 \u00e1fid 1786. By the former, the estate in fee tail is converted into a <em>fee simple, </em>and by the latter, into a <em>fee simple absolute. </em>This difference, however, does not extend throughout the act, for, in the second section of the act of <em>1786, </em>the term <em>fee simple </em>is used in the same sense with <em>fee simple absolute </em>in the first section. But if it were not so, it would make no difference in the construction of the two statutes* The terms <em>fee simple </em>and <em>fee simple absolute </em>have one and the same meaning. <em>Littleton, </em>(sect. 1.) says, a tenant in fee simple is he who hath lands or. tenements to hold to him and his heirs for ever: and it is called fee simple, or <em>feodum simplex, </em>because it signifies a lawful and pure inheritance. <em>Coke, </em>in his Commentary, adopts the same definition, and says, that <em>simple </em>is added to <em>fee </em>for the purpose of showing, that it is descendible to the heirs generally, without restraint to the heirs of the body, or the like. And he uses the terms, <em>simple </em>and <em>absolute, </em>as synonymous, when subjoined to fee. Thus, says he, the more apt division of a fee is into fee simple or absolute, conditional, and qualified or base. For the word simple properly excludeth both conditions and limitations that defeat or abridge the fee. It would be a very strained .construction of the act of 1782, to say it only converted fee tails into conditional fees, as at common law. The result of the opinion of the court accordingly is, that the act of 1782 operated prospectively, and of course extended to the will of <em>Thomas Hicks </em>,* that the fee tail general, devised to his sister, <em>Mary Hicks, </em>was, by the statute, converted into an estate in fee simple. And if so, it is not denied but that the defendant has shown a good title to the premises in question, and is entitled to judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b187-8\">Spencer, J., dissented.</p>\n<p id=\"b187-9\">Judgment for the defendant\u00bb</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
