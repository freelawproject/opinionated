Alexander, </em>their respective checks on the bank, for 200 dollars each, dated the 24th of <em>Aprils </em>and payable on the 1st of <em>June </em>then next, to abide the determination of - a wager- On the election; .the terms of which, as stated by the witness, were, that the defendant bet 100. dollars,- with the plaintiff, that <em>Stephen Van Rensselaer </em>would- have a majority of 5,000 voted over <em>Daniel D. Tompkins </em>;; and another 100 dollars, that <em>Stephen Van Rensselaer </em>would have, a majority of votes over <em>Daniel D\u00a1 </em>Tompkins.. On the official canvass of the Votes, for governor, being made known, <em>Alexander </em>was to deliver tile checks to the defendant, in c\u00e1se S. <em>Van Rensselaer </em>was elected governor by a majority of 5,000 votes; or to- the plaintiff,, in case <em>Daniel. D. Tompkins </em>was elected ; but if <em>S. Van Reniselaer </em>was elected by a majority of \"votes less than 5,000, the check of each -party was to be returned to him.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b386-18\">About the middle of <em>May,, </em>and before the official canvass, of votes was published, but after it was ;well.known, from public information of the result of the canvass, how the election liad terminated^ the defendant <em>gayAlexander </em>notice not to deliver up his check to the plaintiff. But immediately after the result of the canvass, was officially announced to the public, and <em>D.. D, Tompkins </em>was declared to have been elected gpvernor, <em>Alexander, </em>on being indemnified by the plaintiff, delivered the checks to him. \"</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b386-19\">At the time the- .'wager was laid, the defendant\" had deposited in the <em>Albany </em>bank, more than 200 dollars, and such deposite continued until after the resuk of the election was generally known, but before it was officially' declared; and the defendant withdrew the deposite, expressly for the purpose of defeating tjie payment of this check,, alleging that ,he had laid the bet .as the agent of a third .person, who had refused to assume it* <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"377\">*377</page-number>When the check was presented by the plaintiff, at the bank, payment was refused for want of funds.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"Ayz\">It was agreed that, if the court should be of opinion that plaintiff was entitled to recover, the defendant should give a <em>cognovit actionem </em>for 200 dollars, on which judgment should be entered ; otherwise, a judgment of nonsuit was to be entered.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b387-5\"><em>Van Vechten, </em>for the plaintiff,</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"APIZ\">relied on the case of <em>Yates </em>v. <em>Foot, (ante, </em>p. 1.) decided in the court of errors.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"pAMl\"><em>Hale, </em>contra,</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"A1m\">insisted, that the wager was illegal and void, and cited <em>Bunn </em>v. <em>Riker,</em><footnotemark><em>*</em></footnotemark><em> </em>and <em>Lansing </em>v. <em>Lansing.</em><footnotemark>\u2020</footnotemark></p>\n<footnote data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"footnote\" id=\"x999-1\" label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"pAF4\">4 <em>Johns.

The case does not state the particular counts contained in the declaration. It is presumed there are counts on the bet, and for money had and received.</p>\n<p id=\"b387-11\">It was admitted, on the argument, that the plaintiff had the qualifications of an elector of governor. This admission is decisive against the action upon the wager. It was held, in <em>Bunn </em>v. <em>Riker, </em>4 <em>Johns. Rep. </em>426., that where either of the parties was an elector, the wager was illegal, on the ground that it was corrupt, and against the fundamental principles of the constitution.</p>\n<p id=\"b387-12\">I can perceive no ground for the argument, that the money which the defendant had in the bank of <em>Albany </em>is to be -consir dered as the plaintiff\u2019s money. There was no appropriation of this money, either by the bank, or the defendant, to the plaintiff\u2019s use; and, before the plaintiff had a right to demand the sum won, the defendant had withdrawn his deposite from that bank. From wha.t motive this was done, is immaterial; it was not, in any sense, the plaintiff\u2019s money.</p>\n<p id=\"b387-14\">It appears to me to involve an absurdity to say that the plaintiff can maintain this action as for money had and received; when, confessedly, he cannot sustain an action upon the check which the defendant gave to him; on the ground that it is void, as being an illegal transaction. This case is very different from that of <em>Foot </em>v. <em>Yates, </em>in error. There, the party who had lost the bet sought to recover against the stakeholder; here, the party winning the bet seeks to recgver on the ground of the wager. It is very difficult, from the manner of deciding cases <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"378\">*378</page-number>in the court for the correction of errbrs, to ascertain the precise-principle. adopted by the-court. The Only opinion .reported in the case, is that of Sanford, senator. Whether that was adopted by the majority of the members, is uncertain. The substance of his opinion is, that courts: ought not to entertain suits, in such \u00bf case, either by the winner or loser ; and, so far as respected the loser, he considered the contract executed, and he applied .the maxim <em>fieri \u00f1on debet, sed factum </em>\u2018oalct.</p>\n<p id=\"b388-8\">It may be confidently affirmed* that no principle-was adopted* in that case, which countenances the present action.</p>\n<p id=\"b388-9\">Judgment for the defendant.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
