John IF. Woods.\u201d'</em></summary>\n<summary data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"AMg\">The plaintiff proved by a witness, that in <em>December, </em>1807, be went to <em>Greenbush, </em>and informed the defendant, that he had come to fulfil the agreement on his part, and. was then ready to convey the land at <em>Wldteborough,- </em>and to secure the 500 dollars for the difference, according to the terms of the Contract; and demanded a performance of the defendant, on his part; but the plaintiff did not tender or offer a deed for his land, nor say that he had a deed ready; nor did he tender any sum of money for the 500 dollars. The defendant said' he had changed his mind, and refused to do any thing in the business, and said that, the plaintiff must seek his remedy. The defendant made no objection to any encumbrance being on the plaintiff\u2019s land, but absolutely refused to perform the agreement.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"Arfk\">The defendant\u2019s counsel moved for a nonsuit, on the ground that the writing produced was not a contract, but a mere proposition, without consideration or reciprocity, which might be rescinded by either party, at his option ; but the judge overruled the motion. The defendant then proved, that, at the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"191\">*191</page-number>lime of the proposition or contract, there was a tenant on the property of the plaintiff, under a lease, and that about two years of the term was unexpired; and that the tenant was in possession in <em>December, </em>1807, when the plaintiff offered to convey, and demanded a performance of the contract on the part of the defendant.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b201-4\">The judge charged the jury, that if there was an outstanding lease on the plaintiff\u2019s property, which would have prevented his giving possession, in case the defendant had been willing to. carry the contract into execution, the plaintiff was not in a situ- ( ation to convey; and if they should be of that opinion, they ought to find for the defendant. And the jury found a verdict, accordingly, for the defendant.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b201-5\"><em>Kirkland, </em>for the plaintiff,</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AN85\">contended, that tlS'memorandum contained every requisite of a contract, or agreement.

It was a mere naked proposition, without any consideration. And the plaintiff had an option, as to performance. The defendant was not bound : the plaintiff therefore, could not be held liable. There were'not mutual promises, nor any consideration to support a contract. Both promises must be concurrent,, and equally obligatory.<footnotemark>\u2020</footnotemark></p>\n<footnote data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"footnote\" id=\"x999-1\" label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"Afc\"><em> 10 Johns.

It would seem to be a mere proposition, on the part of the defendant, and without mutuality. Nothing was to be done by the plaintiff; it was optional with him whether he would comply or not, on his part, and the.def\u00e9ndant derived no benefit or advantage whatever from the proposition. The case of <em>Cooke </em>v. <em>Oxley, </em>(3 <em>Term Rep. </em>653.) is very much in point <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"192\">*192</page-number>to show the contract void. In contracts, where the promise of tibi\u00f3 . \u201e , , , one party is the consideration for the promise of the other, the promises must be concurrent and obligatory upon both At the same time. (1 <em>Chitty, </em>297. 1 <em>Caines, 594.) </em>But the ground upon which the judge, at the trial, put the cause, is perfectly conclusive. For, admitting there was a consideration, and that the plaintiff was bound on his part, yet it appearing by the evidence, that he was not in a situation to perform, the contract might be rescinded by the other side. (2 <em>Com. Con. </em>52. 58, 59.) The proof in the case shows conclusively, that the property to be conveyed by the plaintiff to the defendant was under lease, and that the term would not expire until long after the bargain between these parties was to have been consummated <em>% </em>and this bringsjj within the principle decided by this court, in the case of <em>Jackson </em>v. <em>Wass, (11 Johns. </em>525.) The motion for a new trial must, therefore, be denied.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
