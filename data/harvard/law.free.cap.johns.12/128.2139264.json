The letters and other matters relative to the conduct and character of the master, in their knowledge, at the time the insurance was effected, ought to have been disclosed to the defendants.</p>\n<p data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AcG\">It is a general and well-s\u00e9ttled rule, that every fact and circumstance which could influence the mind of a prudent and intelligent insurer, in determining whether he will underwrite the policy, or not, is material, and ought to be communicated to him.<footnotemark>*</footnotemark> So, a suppression of circumstances, a knowledge of which might have induced the insurer to demand a higher premium, will vitiate the policy.<footnotemark>\u2020</footnotemark> Even doubtful rumours respecting the safety of a ship have been held material, and the concealment of them will avoid the policy.<footnotemark>\u2021</footnotemark></p>\n<p data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b141-8\">The safety and success of the voyage insured materially depend on the character and conduct of the master. It is of the <em>. </em>, . , , , greatest importance to the insurer to know whether the master be prudent, vigilant, and discreet; or improvident, careless, and extravagant, in the management of the business and property entrusted to his charge. The <em>barratry </em>of the master is one of the perils insured against, and the insurer is, therefore, interested in being informed of those habits of extravagance and carelessness, which naturally lead persons, in that situation, to the commission of barratry. That the master had a. fair cha<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"132\">*132</page-number>racter\u2019when he sailed:from <em>New-York, </em>is an additional reasqri for. requiring from \u25a0 the insured a communication.-of. the facts relative to his subsequent badconduet, as .the defendants, rely-i\u2019n\u00a7 on. that previous :fair Character, would fee more easily i\u00fadiiced to take upon themselves the ris,ks- of the. policy. It is the 'moral conduct of' the. master, in relation to his trust,, in which the insurers are interested, for it is against Ms fraudulent. Conduct that th\u00e9yrhaf\u00e9 insured. Whatever may fee his ter -or\".conduct, in this respect, his nautical, skill may be. the same. The bad character of the master, therefore, cannot be said- -to come within any implied- warranty; as' to seaworthiness.' ' _ \u2019 . -. \u2022 ... ..

So. far as any other quality entering, into his general character\u2019 goes-to his- fitness for the- employinent, it also enters into his nautical character\u2019and competency. It is, therefore,-a-paft of the implied warranty of .the assured, that the master shall have ordinary, integrity, or a good general character;, at the- placCTrom whence- the: vessel- s\u00e1i\u00eds,, or when the risk commences. 1 \" - \u2019 - - ' '</p>\n<p data-order=\"23\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b142-14\">The, extravagance of the master, in repairs, is nothingfor if Be expends more than he ought, th\u00e9 owners, not the insurers, pay the excess.

It is facts, not suspicions, which the' insured is bound to' disclose. It is'not every thing which inCreases; the risk, the Aoncealm\u00e9nt ofrwhich will vacate, the policy.<footnotemark>\u2020</footnotemark> In the case of <em>Haywood v.

To constitute such a concealment as will vitiate the policy, it must be of something palpably material to the risk, and about which there can be no doubt.</p>\n<p data-order=\"25\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b143-6\">Again, the insured could not certainly know, at the time the policy was underwritten, who was the captain, for they had previously written to their correspondents, <em>Cropper Sr Co., </em>authorizing them, in their 'discretion, to discharge <em>Cartwright, </em>and appoint another captain.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"26\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b143-7\"><em>Wells, </em>in reply.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"27\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"Agbm\">The assured had received such information of the conduct of Captain <em>Cartwright, </em>as had destroyed all their confidence in his integrity. It was not a matter of mere suspicion or rumour. It was believed by them to be true, and, they acted on that belief, as to the fact of his misconduct. In <em>Sperry </em>v. <em>The Delaware Insurance Company,</em><footnotemark><em>*</em></footnotemark><em> Washington, </em>J. held, that even if the materiality of the communication was doubtful, it ought not to be withheld, for it is the duty of the insured to give the other contracting party an opportunity of judging, equally with himself.</p>\n<p data-order=\"28\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b143-8\">The moral character of the captain is not included in the implied warranty of <em>seaworthiness, </em>which extends only to the nautical skill of the captain and crew. Yet this moral character may be very essential to be known by the insurers, in regard to the risk of <em>barratry </em>assumed by them. If, under the implied warranty of <em>seaworthiness, </em>the insured were to be considered as warranting the moral character of the master, that warranty would extend also to the <em>crew, </em>which will hardly be pretended. Such a doctrine would put an end to the business of insurance. All that we contend for is, that the insured shall not employ a master or agent whom <em>they know </em>to be destitute of integrity, or incompetent. As regards the implied warranty of seaworthiness, the knowledge or ignorance of the insured as to the fact, makes no difference.</p>\n<p data-order=\"29\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b143-11\">It is said to be a part of the implied warranty, that the mas* ter had a good general character at the place of departure Now the fact is, that the master, in this case, had lost all cha<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"134\">*134</page-number>racier before lie arrived at <em>Belfast. </em>If so, then, on the doetrine of 'the. plaintiffs,-there has been a'-breach, of'the warranty, which puts\" an end to tlje contract'.'

For so far as the representation extends, according to the truth of facts, the implied warranty of seaworthiness ceases on the part of the assured.</p>\n<p id=\"b145-5\">The case of <em>Shoolbred v. Nutt, (Park, </em>300. 1 <em>Marsh. </em>475.) was an insurance upon a ship from <em>Madeira </em>to <em>Charleston. </em>The ship had sailed from <em>London </em>to <em>Madeira. </em>The plaintiff procured insurance, without communicating to the underwriters two letters which he had received from liis captain the day before he effected the insurance, stating \u201cthat the ship had arrived at-<em>Madeira, </em>but was very leaky; and that the pipes of wine oh board of her had been half covered with water.\u201d But it was proved at the trial, that the leak had been completely stopped before she sailed from <em>Madeira. </em>Lord <em>Mansfield </em>decided, that it was enough that the ship actually sailed in good condition when the risk commenced, and that the assured wrere not bound to disclose the information contained in the letters.</p>\n<p id=\"b145-6\">The case of <em>Haywood </em>v. <em>Rodgers, (4 East, 590. </em>1 <em>Marsh. </em>476.) was an insurance upon a ship from <em>Trinidad </em>to <em>London. </em>The assured had received a letter from his captain, informing him, \u201c that he had been obliged to have a survey on the ship at <em>Trinidad, </em>on account of her bad character.\u201d But the survey which accompanied the letter gave the ship a good character; and it was held, that the non-disclosure of the letter and survey to the underwriters, did not vacate the policy, although it appeared in evidence, that such circumstance, if known, would have enhanced the premium. -\u25a0 \u2022</p>\n<p id=\"b145-8\">In all the numerous cases cited by the counsel for the defendants, to exemplify the rule that the assured is bound to disclose <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"136\">*136</page-number>every material fact within his knowledge, the risks to which the concealments related, were directly assumed, by the underWriters. \u2019</p>\n<p id=\"AR2U\">If the. letters charged to have been concealed in this case relatednierely to .the risk of u\u00f1seaw\u00f3rthiness, it is a sufficient. answer, that , the assured never- sought indemnity' against that risk; on'the contrary, it was an essential part of this contract, \u00bfhat the assured should, warrant every ingredient of sea wort hi-\u00edi\u00e9ss. . ' .</p>\n<p id=\"b146-8\">The- rule applicable to this subject is. expressed with great precision and accuracy by <em>Washington, </em>J. in the case of <em>Kohne </em>v. <em>Insurance Company of North America, </em>(1 <em>Marsh. </em>473. note <em>75. by Condy,) </em>viz. \u201c Th\u00e9 underwriter takes upon himself the risk-<em>which the assured^ is not willing to bear, </em>always under . the implied condition, that he shall, as to all facts within the privote knowledge of the assured, be equally informed as himself\u201d \u2022</p>\n<p id=\"AgJ\">In this view of the case, therefore, If appears to me, that the judge very properly charged the jury that the assured were not bound to disclose the letters and other facts in , regard to the character and conduct of the captain.</p>\n<p id=\"b146-12\">I am: also satisfied, that upon the question of seaworthiness, embracing the character of the captain, the. verdict is not against the weight of evidence. - - ' \u2022 .</p>\n<p id=\"AV8\">In examining this case, in the sebond point of view proposed ; that.is, as an <em>insurance against barratry, </em>it presents a contract of a complicated and extraordinary kind, \u201c making the underwriter-fas Lord <em>Mansfield </em>expresses it) become insurer of the, conduct of the, captain\" whom he does not appoint, and cannot dismiss, to the owners who can do either,\u201d It is hero worthy of remark, that the qualities and condition of the ship and her apparel may be certainly known by survey and inspection, but theffieart of man, and his moral structure, are in a great measure unsearchable by human discernment. \"To seek indemnification, 'therefore, against'human frailties, by insurance-against barratry,; is, a legitimate object; and favourable to commerce..</p>\n<p id=\"AGm\">I consider .the contract to be essentially this: that the assured shall, in good faith, employ, \u00e1 captain - of competent nautical skill and general good character; and if he do so, then, and not otherwise, - the insurer is,liable for barratry;</p>\n<p id=\"b147-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"137\">*137</page-number>Here it is important to ascertain, with precision, the true definition <em>of \u00abbarratry\u201d</em></p>\n<p id=\"b147-4\">According to Valin, <em>Pothier, Emerigon, </em>and <em>Le Guidon, </em>st Barratry comprehends every fault of the master by which a loss is occasioned, whether arising from fraud, negligence, unskilfulness, or mere imprudence.\u201d But in the <em>English </em>law, it has a more limited signification. No fault of the master amounts to barratry, unless it proceed from a fraudulent purpose; (2 <em>Marsh. </em>518.) or, in the language of Ch. J. <em>Lee, </em>(cited and recognised as law in <em>Phin </em>v. <em>Royal Exchange Assurance Com</em>pany, <em>7 Term Rep. </em>508.) <em>\u201c </em>Barratry must be some breacli of trust in the master, <em>ex maleficio </em>,\u2022\u201d or, as defined by Lord <em>Ellenborough, (Earl </em>v. <em>Rowcroft, </em>8 <em>East, </em>126. <em>Park, </em>121.) \u201c there must be fraud, or crime, to constitute barratry.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b147-7\">According, then, to the established meaning of the term <em>barratry, </em>in the <em>English </em>law, the underwriters, in this case, insured against the acts of the captain which might <em>he fraudulent </em>or <em>criminal, </em>and his <em>breaches of trust, ex maleficio. </em>Now, the question properly occurs, did the assured conceal from the underwriters any information material to that risk ?</p>\n<p id=\"b147-8\">The facts here charged to have been unduly concealed, are,</p>\n<p id=\"b147-9\">First, that the captain, on his outward voyage, several months before this policy was signed, touched at the <em>Havanna </em>for water, and there drew a bill on his owners, the assured, for about 800 dollars, which they refused to pay ;&gt; alleging, as a reason for such refusal, that the bill was not accompanied by a letter of advice from the captain.</p>\n<p id=\"b147-10\">Secondly, the written correspondence between <em>Harvey, Deaves &amp; Harvey, </em>of <em>Cork, Cropper, Benson &amp; Co. </em>of <em>Live</em>r<em>pool, </em>and the assured, of <em>New-York.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b147-12\">The inference attempted to be drawn from the transaction of the protested bill, seems to me so remote and equivocal as to deserve little consideration.</p>\n<p id=\"b147-13\">The letters of <em>Harvey, Deaves &amp; Harvey, </em>and <em>Cropper, </em>Benson &amp; <em>Co., </em>strongly imply a charge against Captain <em>Cartwright </em>of negligence and want of economy in the repairs of the ship, then at <em>Cork. </em>They say, \u201c we fear he is careless of his business, and that his amount of repairs and expenses will astonish us all.\u201d \u00ab His detention has been very great, yet he seems very easy <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"138\">*138</page-number>under it.\u201d But there is no charge nor -surmise in these letters, which goes to impeach the <em>honesty </em>of the captain. They do not' \u00abven intimate that he was .addicted to any practices that would naturally, lead him to commit a breach of trust,, <em>ex nialefcio ; </em>although the assured, by their fetters, of the 10th and 13th <em>\u25a0\u2022'May,,. </em>1311, seem to have yielded to the- suggestions against the captain, and directed their agents to discharge him, and to. era? ploy another ih.his stead, if their agents should think it.necessary for their interest; yet it.is fair to\"conclude, that the assured were thus actuated, merely fro,ni the! considerations stated in the letters of Harvey, <em>Deaves &amp; Harvey, </em>and <em>Cropper, Benson </em>&amp; Co.</p>\n<p id=\"AEa\">\u25a0. For aught'that appears, therefore,, the oply gro\u00fand-of dissatisfaction in the minds of the assured Or .their agents, was the <em>careless delay </em>and <em>want of economy in </em>the captain, which are characteristic of seamen; and which are' so' frequently united with strict.honour and fidelity in that class of \"men. . \" , .</p>\n<p id=\"b148-12\">My Conclusion, therefore, is, that,1 although the .'contents of those fetters might seriously affect the interest of the owners, who were, solely responsible for the port-charges referred to iir those letters, yet\u2019they did not relate to the risk of barratry as-' sumed by the'underwriters in this.-policy,; and that the opinion of .the judge-at the trial was correct, instating that theassured' were not bound, to communicate them.- ,</p>\n<p id=\"b148-15\">' The letters of the 10th andlSth'of 1811, were,written .by tlie assured in' <em>New-York, </em>to their agents, <em>Cropper, Benson &amp; Co. of Liverpool. </em>The policy was signed, at New-York on the 12th .Of Avgust,'181.1, the ship <em>Suffolk'being </em>then at <em>Belfast; </em>and although, Captain <em>Cartwright </em>Was named as master in the policy, that could only have been intended to identify the ship. The-question here is the same as if the po.licy had <em>been .blan/c </em>as,to the master. \u2022\u201c \u2022</p>\n<p id=\"b148-18\">The absolute right of the owners to. change, the master at .any time, without the knowledge or consent of the underwriters, is unquestionable. \u2019 The instructions which the assured had given to their \u00e1gents in <em>Liverpool, </em>in regard to the master, were prudent and discreet\". - ...</p>\n<p id=\"AGie\">.' Considering- that the\u2019 ship was in a foreign port ythat ,the assured were' under a'general\" and Unqualified obligation- to provide' a- suitable master, and that neither the, law nor usage required that they 'should consult with the underwriters as to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"139\">*139</page-number>the selection of a master, it was sufficient, in this case, if the assured and their agents acted discreetly, and <em>bona fide, </em>in retaining Captain <em>Cartwright.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b149-6\">It would be unreasonably severe, and would defeat almost every policy of insurance against barratry, if the assured, were held strictly bound to disclose every immoral act imputable to the master, and every unfavourable report respecting him, which had reached the ear of the assured previous to signing the policy. Such a rigorous application of the rule in the varied fortunes and vicissitudes of a seaman\u2019s life, would be impolitic and unjust.</p>\n<p id=\"ANC\">There must be some limits to this duty of making disclosures in such cases. It cannot be necessary that the assured should give to the underwriter a minute history of every thing which they have known or heard of, touching the moral character of the intended master.</p>\n<p id=\"b149-8\">If his general character be good, and the assured have no knowledge or information of any fapt <em>impeaching the honesty </em>of the master; the charge of undue concealment has no legal foundation.</p>\n<p id=\"b149-9\">In this case the unfavourable opinions expressed in the letters of <em>Harvey, Deaves &amp; Harvey, </em>and of Cropper, <em>Benson &amp; Co., </em>respecting Captain <em>Cartwright, </em>were repelled by the evidence of his good character as a sailing master in <em>New-York, </em>where he had been long known.</p>\n<p id=\"b149-10\">I cannot entertain a doubt of the propriety of allowing the plaintiffs to give in evidence their letter of the 13th of <em>May, </em>1811, because it formed part of the contents of a paper, an <em>extract </em>of which had been read in evidence by the defendants. It was, altogether, one entire communication, though composed of an original letter, and a copy of another letter,; and neither party had a right to read part, without the whole.</p>\n<p id=\"b149-13\">It was fully proved, (and admitted on the argument,) that the captain did commit barratry.</p>\n<p id=\"b149-14\">Upon the whole case, therefore, 1 am of opinion, that the plaintiffs are entitled to judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b149-15\">Judgment for the plaintiffs.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
