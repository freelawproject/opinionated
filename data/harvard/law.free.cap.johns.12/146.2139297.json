A pledge is a depos\u00edte of goods to be redeemed on certain terms.<footnotemark>*</footnotemark> It is not like a mortgage, which is to become an absolute interest, if not redeemed in a certain tiaie.<footnotemark>\u2020</footnotemark> The case of <em>M\u2018Clean </em>v. Walker<footnotemark>\u2021</footnotemark> is in point. The note was held to be a deposite or pledge, and that the property in it did not pass by the delivery, as in case of a mortgage; and the distinction laid down in <em>Cortelyou </em>v. <em>Lansing,</em><footnotemark><em>\u00a7</em></footnotemark><em> </em>by <em>Kent, </em>J., , t ' \u2019 \u2019 between a pledge or pawn and a mortgage, and as <em>to </em>the pawnor\u2019s right of redemption, are fully recognised. That case, too, was of a note delivered as security for a debt, and the learned judge, whose opinion is reported, lays it down as clear law, that where there is no specified time of redemption, the pawnee has no right to sell the pledge. The only power he has, is to receive the whole money from the maker of the note. If the pawnee sell the goods, <em>trover </em>lies.<footnotemark>\u01c0\u01c0</footnotemark> The defendant was not obliged to take any measures to collect the note. Where notes are deposited as collateral security merely, the law imposes no obligation on the holder to collect the money. An executor, though standing in a more intimate relation to his testator, has no power to release or compound a debt, for a less sum.<footnotemark>**</footnotemark> Neither can an assignee of a bankrupt or insolvent, \u2022without the consent of the creditors. Nor- can an attorney <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"148\">*148</page-number>compound or release a debt for a less sum, without' an .authority, express or implied, from bis client*</p>\n<p data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"A2vb\">This is the case of a simple pledge or pawn, and the'pawnee had no right, to sell or dispose' of the note, if at all, for less than the whole sum due on it; arid the defendant is answerable for the difference. ,</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"A7DL\"><em>Henry, </em>contra.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"A5i\">Where a pledge is of a dead chattel, it must, be returned in specie. Where it is of a thing, in itself, of no value, b\u00fat a mere evidence of debt, there the debt or money is to be returned; otherwise, the pawnee of a note could not receive the money of the maker. - \u2022</p>\n<p data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"A3SG\">. There is a distinction between a strict pledge and a mortgage, or an assignment of a debt. In the latter cas\u00e9,/ if,the money <em>is </em>not paid at the day,, the mortgagee may sell, the pledge. The note was left with the defendant as collateral security. \u2019 If was, therefore, mortgaged or assigned.. If so, the defendant had a right to receive the' tnoney due to him, and to give up the note* .....</p>\n<p data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b158-8\">The first, second, fifth, arid sixth counts in the declaration,, proceed on the ground of a property in the note; arid that the defendant was bouiid -to return it in. specie. . Those counts, clearly, cannot be maintained. The oilier two .counts are founded on' the misconduct of the defendant as a bailee or pawnee. Tliey state the note to be due . and unpaid when it was delivered, in 1803 ; but it appears from-the ri\u00f3te produced, .that it was,not payable until the 1st of <em>November,, </em>1801., There is; so far, a variance between the allegation in those counts and the proof. '\u2022 \u25a0</p>\n<p data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"Ar9\">The defendant having acted with good faith, ought not to be made liable ; nor should the court, under the circumstances of the case, be inclined to favour the plaintiff. .\" y</p>\n<p data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b158-11\">In <em>Salk,</em><footnotemark><em>*</em></footnotemark><em> </em>it is. laid down, that where, goods are pawned, redeemable ;at a certain day, the pawnee, in case, of failure of payment, at the day, may sell them. And in <em>Tucker </em>v. <em>Wilson,</em><footnotemark><em>\u2020</em></footnotemark><em> </em>where exchequer annuities, xy ere- pledged for a debt, it xvas held that -they might be sold, after \u25a0 notice; without: any, decree Of foreclosure of redemption. ' ' -</p>\n<p data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AU9\">- An assignment of a <em>chose in action </em>need not be by deed.<footnotemark>\u2021</footnotemark> there xvas a paroi assignment or mortgage of the note- in \u2019this case, 'the -property passed, and no. action lies on the ^counts <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"149\">*149</page-number>founded on the property of the plaintiff in the note. ' And if any action would lie against the defendant as an agent, there are -no counts in the declaration on that ground. An assignee of a bond or note has complete power over it, and may cancel it, or deliver it to the maker.</p>\n<p data-order=\"21\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b159-3\">In <em>Cortelyou </em>v. <em>Lansing, </em>the thing pledged was a certificate of <em>public stock, </em>for which no action could be maintained.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"22\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b159-4\"><em>Bleecker, </em>in reply,</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"23\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"Ahz3\">said, that the case was made subject to the opinion of the court.

J.</author>\n<p id=\"Aovf\">delivered the opinion of the court. The plaintiff and one <em>Murphy, </em>being indebted to <em>James </em>&amp; <em>M\u2018Cabe, </em>on a balance of account for merchandise, the plaintiff left with the defendant, as <em>collateral security, </em>a note drawn by <em>Seth Garlick </em>to him, for 600 dollars, dated the 1st of November, 1802. Some time in the year 1810, the defendant gave up the note to <em>Seth Garlick </em>for 300 dollars ; and this suit is brought to recover the difference between the amount of the note, and balance of accounts due to <em>James </em>&lt;\u00a7\u2022 <em>M\u2018Cabe.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b159-9\">That the note thus deposited with the defendant is to be considered and treated as a pledge, cannot admit of a doubt. It was delivered, with a right to detain it as collateral security, for the balance due <em>James </em>&lt;\u00a7* <em>M\u2018Cabe. </em>But the legal property did not pass. The general ownership remained with the plaintiff and the defendant only acquired a special property therein; and if so, he has clearly exceeded his authority, in disposing of it as he has done.</p>\n<p id=\"b159-10\">In the very able and learned examination of the rights and duties of a pawnee, in the case of <em>Cortelyou </em>v. <em>Lansing, </em>(2 <em>Caines\u2019 Cases in Error, </em>201.) most of the law on the subject of pledges has been collected. And I believe it may be safely <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"150\">*150</page-number>affirmed, that no p\u00e1se is. 69 be found, where the deposite , was for aa indefinite tim\u00e9, as it was in the' case, before us, thattlie sale of disposition of the pledge by the pawnee, withVout\"first . calling' iipoA the pawn\u00f3r. to redeem^, has been held good. It may be said.here,-as was said in that .case, that it is unnecessary to decide in what manner this call is to be made, Or how the pledge is to be disposed, of: in case of tlie pawnor\u2019s default to redeem; for in .this'case the pawnor was not called upon, in any manner Whatever, to redeem. It was urged, on the argument, that this' cquld not he done, because the plaintiff had absconded. If fiotihe to redeem could not have been given personally to the plaintiff, the disposition of the pledge; should have been' authorized and sanctioned by judicial pro*</p>\n<p id=\"AXc\">. \u2018 The authority of the defendant, w:ith respect to the note, could extend no further than to receiving the money- due upon it, without first calling Upon-the plaintiff, in some way, to. re-' deem. . The money, When received, Would be a. substitute for the note, and to be held upon the sa\u00edne*terms, and subject to' the same rights-and duties as the not\u00e9. And'if the \"defendant undertook -to compromise.with the drawer of tlie n\u00f3te, aiidreceived a Jess sum than was due, he did it at his peril, as he acted without authority.-, \u25a0\u25a0\u25a0\u25a0\u2022'.</p>\n<p id=\"AHm\">Althqughlt is admittedj iii; the case,; .that the defendant act\u00e9d in good faith, it is diffibiilt to discover the reason Of nis making:; the sacrifice he did, in accepting of less than one half the sum due upon the note;; for it is in proof, that the settlement was made \u25a0 with <em>\u00a1Seth: Gafliek, </em>personally,, and that he was, at the7 time, abundantly able to pay the full amount of the note. It was urgedj on the part Of the defendant, that the plaintiff might still call upon <em>Seth Gaflltk </em>for. the balance, due .upon the note, as the. payment made by him being.for a less sum than was due, it would not operate \u00e1s. a discharge of the note. Admitting, this to be cOfrectj .it will not exonerate, the defendant, if be . \u2022 lias so.disposed of the pledge as to make himself responsible.. A party may have, two remedies for an injury, and may elect which to pursue..</p>\n<p id=\"b160-7\">In whatever light,: therefore, the. base is viewed,- the plaintiff is entitled-to recover, and .must have judgment for <em>525 </em>dollars, being the difference between the amount of the note and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"151\">*151</page-number>the balance of account due from <em>Murphy </em>&amp; <em>Garlick </em>to <em>James </em>&amp; <em>M\u2018Cabe, </em>according to the stipulation of the parties. Several other questions would appear to arise out of the case as presented to the court, but they were abandoned on the arguznent.</p>\n<p id=\"b161-4\">Judgment for the plaintiff.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
