This section of the act directs, \u201cthat all . _ . 7 costs or suit, prison and jail fees, and charges of proceeding under the act, to obtain the discharge of the insolvent, shall be first paid; and then deducting all such costs, charges, and expenses, as shall be necessarily laid out and expended by the assignee or assignees, together with his or their commissions,\u201d &amp;c.; the residue shall be equally divided among the without preference.

The words of the act, \u201c all costs of suit,\u201d mean only the costs of suits brought by or against the assignee or assignees of the insolvent. There is no reason or justice in giving the prosecuting creditor any advantage oyer the other creditors. The act does not intend\" to encourage suits against insolvents. Its object, in this sec? tian, is merely.to indemnify the assignees for all the costs, charges, and expenses of all suits brought by\u2019 or against them, or necessarily incurred by them in the execution of their tryst. \u2018</p>\n<p id=\"b352-9\">Rule granted,</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
