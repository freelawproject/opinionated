Then, can the sheriff, before actual possession, maintain <em>trover </em>for the goods of the defendant, wrongfully taken away ? To maintain <em>trover, </em>an absolute or general property in the goods is sufficient, though the plaintiff has never had the actual possession.<footnotemark>\u2020</footnotemark> If a person has the right of possession, the law implies possession. As it respects <em>Claio, </em>the debtor, the sheriff had the absolute property against all the world.

The sheriff, by the delivery of the execution to him, acquires no interest in the property of the defendant ; he acts-under the authority of .the writ-, and as-the agent of'the law to execute its. judgment. He can acquire no interest -or property in the goods of the debtor.,, Until he has made an actual seizure.

But if the sheriff, in this case, returns <em>nulla bona, </em>would he be liable ? If not, he is not damnified, and cannot, therefore, have any right of action. As soon as the.goods are seized, the sheriff may have the amount endorsed on the execution, and will be so far discharged. But, in this case, could he make such an en-. dorsement ?</p>\n<p data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b415-5\">Again, a sheriff cannot sue for property which he cannot levy upon ; and he cannot levy an execution after the return day. In trover, the defendant may bring the goods into courts,<footnotemark>\u2021</footnotemark> if they ar\u00e9 susceptible of it. And, suppose the defendant had brought the net into court, could the plaintiff levy on it, or seize it, by virtue of the execution, after the return day ?</p>\n<p data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b415-7\">The cases under the bankrupt laws of England, depend on the. peculiar provisions of those laws.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b415-8\"><em>Vanderpool, </em>in reply.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"ApF\">I go on the ground of the common law, as it existed before the statute; for all the cases agree that, as between the sheriff and the party, the common law has not been altered by the statute, which protects <em>bona fide </em>purchasers only. By the common law the goods were bound from the <em>teste </em>of the execution, and the sheriff might take them out of the hands of a <em>bona fide </em>purchaser, <footnotemark>\u00a7</footnotemark> If so, must not the property or right off1 possession be in the sheriff before seizure? mi . . <em>i </em>T . *ii <em>r </em>i 1 his title to the possession commences with the <em>teste </em>o\u00ed the execution, by relation.

It is toolat\u00e9 to- question the construction which has been uniformly given; to the statute of <em>29 </em>Car. II. ch. 3. s. 16., which enacts, fe that no writ of <em>fi. fa., </em>or other \"writ of execution,, shall bind the property of the goods Of the party against whom' such- writ of execution is sued forth, but from the time that such writ shall be delivered to the sheriff,\u201d &amp;c. That cons true tian has been;, that the statute being Wade to protect purchasers, does not alter the. few, as bet-weep the- parties ;- and the common law, prior to the statute,\" Was, that the <em>fi, fa, </em>had relation to its <em>teste, </em>and bound the defendant\u2019s goods from \"that time 5 so that if the defendant had afterwards sold.,them, though <em>bona fide, </em>and for a valuable consideration, they were still liable to be taken \u2019 in execution. (2 <em>Tidd's Pr. 914, </em>915., and the note, 7 <em>T. R. </em>21., and the case <em>Of Parson </em>v. <em>Gill, </em>in the notes. 1 <em>Saund. </em>219. (f.) <em>10 </em>Vin. <em>Abr. 566. Comb. </em>145. 2 <em>Eq. Cas. Abr. </em>381.) To remedy the Unjust effect of -the relation of a <em>fi. fa. </em>-to its <em>test\u00e9; </em>which produced great mischief to purchasers, the statute was, passed. Our .statute (1 <em>R. L. </em>501. s. 6.) is substantially &amp; transcript of the <em>British </em>statute. <em>. -</em></p>\n<p id=\"b416-12\">The goods in question -were then bound by-the execution, in the plaintiff\u2019s hands, at the time the defendant, took them away. . * \u25a0 ' .</p>\n<p id=\"b416-13\">The only remaining inquiry is this; can- the pfeWtiff, -who. hever . levied on the goods, maintain, an action for the conversion of them, When they were, in. fact, taken tpi'tiously by the'defendant before the plaintiff received the, exec ution, on-the ground that they were bound by the -execution in consequence of the <em>teste </em>.being prior to-the defendant\u2019s taking them ?</p>\n<p id=\"b416-14\">To entitle a p\u00e1rty to-maintain <em>trover, </em>two things: Are necessary-': <em>1st, </em>Property in the pfem-tiff;. and, 2d. <em>\u00c1 </em>wrongful- conver|jopr by the d.efenfjaht. The-plaintiff\u2019s property mAyWs general,., <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"407\">*407</page-number>o\u00ed special. A carrier, bailee, or the person who finds a chattel, has, in regard to his possession, sufficient property to entitle him to maintain the action. A sheriff who has seized goods on a <em>fi. fa., </em>may maintain this action against any person who takes them away, and converts them, before a sale. (2 <em>Saund. </em>47.)</p>\n<p id=\"b417-4\">I have not met with a case which shows that an action of <em>trover </em>can be maintained by a sheriff, for goods tortiously taken out of the possession of the party, against whom the execution issued, before the execution cdmes to the hands of the sheriff, and where he has never levied on the goods. It has been repeatedly held, that neither before, nor since the statute, the words \u201c bound from the delivery of the writ to the sheriff,\u201d alter the property, of the goods; but it continues in the defendant until the execution is executed. This construction was given by Lord <em>Hards-, wicka </em>to the statute, in <em>Lowthal </em>v. <em>Tonkins, </em>(2 <em>Eq. </em>Cas. <em>Abr. </em>381.) This, also, was Lord <em>EllenboroagK\u2019s </em>opinion in <em>Payne </em>v. <em>Drew, </em>(4 <em>East, </em>536, 537.)</p>\n<p id=\"b417-6\">If the goods are rescued, the sheriff may return that they arex rescued,'and he will not be liable. (1 <em>Ventr. </em>52, 1 Brownlow, 132.) This shows that the property did not vest in him; indeed* the execution creates the lien, for the benefit of the creditor; and the sheriff is the mere minister of the law, to procure for the creditor, satisfaction of the debt; and to this end, the sheriff is invested with the right, after he has found the property and levied on it, to hold possession until a sale ; and if that possession is violated, he may maintain <em>trespass </em>or <em>trover.</em></p>\n<p id=\"Ac2M\">It has been uniformly held in this court, that an actual levy of a <em>f.fa. </em>was necessary. Thus, in <em>Devoe </em>v. <em>Elliot, </em>(2 Caines, 143.) it was decided, that where a sheriff has levied an execution, in due time, he may complete the same by sale, but cannot levy-after the return day. So again, in <em>Bliss </em>v. <em>Ball, </em>(9 Johns. <em>Rep. </em>132.) a levy was considered an essential requisite. The reason given by <em>Chitty, </em>(1 <em>Chit. Pl. </em>151.) why a sheriff, carrier, factor, &amp;c., may maintain trover, in consequence of their special property in goods taken out of their possession, is quite satisfactory, and reasonable. It is because they are responsible ever to their principal.</p>\n<p id=\"b417-10\">In the present case, the plaintiff, as we have seen, cannot be considered as having the general property; and, in my judgment, he never had a special property. In such a Gas&lt;?, that species of property ean alone arise from possession.</p>\n<p id=\"Az-k\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"408\">*408</page-number>The execution, I agree, had a retrospective operation. The goods, in this case, being bound from the <em>teste, </em>gave the sheriff a right to reduce the goods to possession, if he could have levied on them; but he could not find them. Would the sheriff be liable to the party in whose favour the execution was, under the facts in this case ? X conceive, most clearly, not; and it seems to me, that consideration furnishes a decisive criterion; for if the sheriff is not liable to the plaintiff in the execution, <em>oui bona </em>is he prosecuting this action ? Not to protect himself from any liability over, but to. gain to himself something which, for aught I see, would be his own, when recovered.</p>\n<p id=\"b418-4\">On the principle, therefore, that a levy was necessary to constitute a special property in the plaintiff, in the goods, and: that no levy has ever been made, the defendant is entitled to. judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b418-5\">Judgment for the defendant..</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
