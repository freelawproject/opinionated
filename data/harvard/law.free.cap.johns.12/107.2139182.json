The master testified that the <em>Hudson </em>sailed from. Riga,,An <em>Russia, </em>on the ninth of <em>October,, </em>1810, bound tq&gt; <em>New-York. Ixi the North Sea </em>she experienced boisterous weather, and began to leak; and.when off the coast of Ireland,-her leak had so much increased,' that it: was thought necessary to put into <em>-Kinsale,:t&amp; </em>repair, and. she arrived, at that place on the twelfth of November. She-was. there surveyed and repaired, without unlading her-cargd. On the twenty-eighth of <em>December,, </em>she set sail again for <em>New-York, </em>and after being at sea about -three days, and having proceededabout- 500- mile's on her. course, she encountered a very heavy gale of wind, and received a very heavy stroke of the sea, which, as, th\u00e9 master supposed, started ,a plank near her keel,, as she immediately began to leak very fast, so that she could not be kept free with both pumps - and the. gale and force of the sea was-so great, as would,- in the opinion of the master; have .endangered \u00e1ny v\u00e9ssel in the same situation. \u2022 $t\" became necessary to seek a port to refit, and the commander of an <em>English </em>frigate, who spoke the <em>Hudson, </em>sent his carpenter on board to examine -her, and adyigedthe master to abandon her, as the leak was so-bad.. - The master, however*, borefaway for <em>Kinsale, </em>which he again reached; ^on the: twelfth of <em>. January, </em>1811, where he .run-, the .ship into the' mud,, to prevent her sinking. Another survey of the vessel was then'made, and it was judged;: that from her; state, \u00e1nd the high price of labour and'materials at <em>Kinsale, </em>she could not be repaired for less than her value; which was also the opinion of the master,.as it Would be necessary to take off the; sheathing.

But if the timbers had not been rotten, she could not have been repaired but at gn enormous expense; owing to the high price of materials <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"109\">*109</page-number>and labour. The master further stated, that had he known the state of the vessel, at <em>Riga, </em>he would not-' have sailed from that place, at that -season, without having her thoroughly repaired, which might have been done at <em>Riga </em>for half the expense which the repairs would have cost at Kinsale,* but he had no, doubt, that, in ordinary weather, the vessel would have performed the voyage in safety, without repairs ; and that any other vessel,, however sound, could hardly have withstood the storms the <em>Hudson </em>experienced, From his subsequent knowledge of the vessel, he was led to believe, that when she left <em>Riga, </em>she was insufficient. for the voyage, though she might have be\u00e9n competent for a summer voyage; and at the time of her departure, her sails and rigging were in good order, and were so when she was sold at <em>Kinsale.</em></summary>\n<summary data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b119-3\">The master hired a <em>Baltimore </em>vessel, called the <em>Friendship, </em>-for 200 pounds sterling, at <em>Kinsale\u201e\u25a0 </em>to bring home the manufactured goods and iron, composing part of the <em>Hudson's </em>cargo. This vessel was not one fourth loaded, but the hemp could not have been taken out of the <em>Hudson, </em>in bales; and the rebinding and stowing it, in another ship, would have been equal to its \u2018value ; and in The state in which it was, the <em>Friendship, </em>in addition to the other goods, could not have taken more than thirty tons of the hemp. There were only two other <em>American </em>vessels at <em>Kinsale, </em>neither of which was bound to the <em>United States, </em>and they had cargoes. There were twelve, or more <em>American </em>vessels at <em>Corle, </em>which is 16 miles\u201efrom <em>Kinsale. </em>The master made no attempt to procure any of them to bring home the <em>hemp, </em>which he supposed'they would have done, on a freight; The hemp was landed and sold at auction at <em>Kinsale, </em>princi-. pally to <em>Cork </em>merchants, and the average price, as appeared by the account of sales, of <em>Harvey, Deaves 8c Harvey, </em>the merchants under whose direction it was sold, was sixty-one. pounds sterling per ton. It appeared that the hemp is packed and stowed in <em>Russia </em>by the means of machinery and screws, and that there were no such machinery or screws at <em>Kinsale, </em>so that it could not be shipped in the usual manner; and if stowed loose* it would not pay a freight. The.master acted by the advice and opinion of <em>Harvey, Denves \u00e9 Harvey,- </em>the merchants, and he also consulted the tvvo <em>American </em>captains there. He said the hemp could not have been sufficiently compressed- by jack-screws, 'about which he made no inquiry. It would have required two <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"110\">*110</page-number>or three vessels, of the size of the <em>Hudson, </em>to have brought jj0me vie hemp, without its being packed and stowed in the <em>Russian </em>manner.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"AEb\">The <em>Hudson, - </em>on her arrival at <em>.Kinsdle, </em>had performed about one third of li\u00e9r voyage. .

There can be no reasonable doubt of the seaworthiness of the vessel when the policy attached. The captain does not declare, satisfactorily, what her situation really was when she left <em>Riga; </em>but is explicit as to her ability to perform the voyage' had he experienced ordinary weatherand he says, that a perfectly sound vessel would hardly have withstood the storm he experienced, yet, if he had known her. situation, he would not have gone in her. This opinion, however, appears to be formed altogether on the discovery of the decayed timbers in her at <em>Kinsale. </em>The carpenter states that the rottenness of those timbers, in the part of the vessel described by the master, could- not make her unseaworthy, as little or no stress could come on the place where they were found:. The weight of evidence appears decidedly in favour of Tier seaworthiness, and, of course, warranted the verdict of the jury, and they having passpd upon it, their decision ought to be conclusive.</p>\n<p id=\"AhJ\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"112\">*112</page-number>The policy being on <em>freight, </em>it is urged that the master OUght to have sent home, the whole cargo by another vessel or vessels.</p>\n<p id=\"AT6\">That the master lias a right\" to hire another vessel and carry on the cargo, so as to entitle him to his freight, has at all times been allowed ; and the decision of this court, in <em>Schieffelin </em>v. <em>New-York Insurance Company, </em>(9 <em>Johns. Rep. </em>21.) establishes the principle that it is his duty to find another vessel by which to carry the goods to the place of destination, if it is in his' po wer to do so. It never was intended by this decision to make it incumbent on the master to procure a vessel elsewhere, out of the port of distress, or out of a port immediately contiguous ; and such limitation is perfectly correct, because the extension of this rule, as contended for, would be attended with insurmountable, difficulties and embarrassments to masters. In th\u00e9 present case he would have been obliged to travel \u00e1xteen miles, the distance between <em>Kinsale </em>and <em>Cork, </em>and what his conduct ought to be, if the distance had: been greater, could not be ascertained. It would be requiring an act, as a duty, the extent of which the master could not at all times know.or understand; A due regard, therefore, to the protection of masters of vessels, as well as the interest, of the assured, renders some limitation\" \"indispensable; and that must necessarily be by confining the inquiry or search for another vessel, to the same port, and no other, unless it be a port contiguous and at hand. In this case, no vessel could be obtained at <em>Kinsale; </em>he was, therefore, under- no obligation to procure one at <em>Cork; </em>and such being the true and correct definition of the master\u2019s duty, it was not necessary for the plaintiff to show that the attempt had been made to procure a vessel at <em>Cor</em>k.</p>\n<p id=\"b122-5\">Admitting, however, that it would be-the captain\u2019s duty, with an ordinary cargo, to procure a vessel at <em>Cork </em>to send it, on, no such obligation could possibly exist in this ^ose, as the situation of th\u00e9 cargo'rendered a reshipment improper.</p>\n<p id=\"AAAn\">It appears evident that the master, throughout the whole business, acted in good , faith. He consulted one of the most respectable mercantile houses at <em>Cork, </em>as well as two <em>American </em>captains, who were there at the same time, and who saw the situation of the cargo. They all concurred in advising the sale of the hemp, no doubt from a conviction that to carry it. to the place of destination would be detrimental to the owners. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"113\">*113</page-number>It appears that it would have required three or four vessels of the <em>Hudson\u2019s </em>size to take it, in consequence of its elasticity; and that the <em>Friendship </em>could have carried but thirty tons of it. The captain could not, therefore, be chargeable with negligence for not separating the article and shipping so small a part of it loose, and at an extra expense, when obliged to dispose of the residue. It would have been a measure manifestly against the interest of the owners, for all the witnesses agree that a reshipment of the hemp, in a merchantable condition, would have increased the expenses enormously ? and some of them declare that to stow it in a vessel, as it had before been in the <em>Hudson\u00a1, </em>would have made the expense equal to its value, for the want of proper machinery for the purpose, at <em>Kinsale; </em>and such must have been the opinion of the jury, under the directions given them, and expressed by their verdict, that those expenses would have amounted to a sum so extravagant, as to forbid a reshipment with such a cargo. It is, therefore, to say the least, extremely questionable whether the master, who acted in good faith, was not perfectly justifiable. Having, however, before shown that the inquiry ought to be confined to the same port, or one contiguous to it, it is not necessary to decide this cause on any other ground.</p>\n<p id=\"b123-3\">It is contended that the underwriters ought to be allowed the amount expended on account of a part of the cargo which reached its port of destination.</p>\n<p id=\"b123-4\">They, are certainly not entitled, upon any principle, to a deduction beyond a proportionate allowance for freight actually earned ; and to authorize such deduction, it was incumbent on the defendants to show that those articles had been delivered to the plaintiffs, at the port of destination, or to bring home to them notice of their arrival and seizure, but no delivery or notice to them appeared on the trial. They, therefore, cannot claim a compensation in this instance.</p>\n<p id=\"b123-5\">Judgment for the plaintiffs.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
