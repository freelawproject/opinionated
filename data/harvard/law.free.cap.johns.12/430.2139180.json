The defendant, <em>Chattle, </em>not being apprized of the variance between the <em>nisi prius </em>record, and the copy of the declaration, relied wholly on the plea of the statute of limitations, and had not so pleaded as to enable him to avail himself of a set-off, and other defence, and was thus completely surprised.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b441-5\"><em>P.
