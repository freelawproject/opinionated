Not a case is to be found, except the one cited from <em>Moselfs </em>reports, of an appeal to the <em>house of </em>lords, on a mere question of costs.<footnotemark>\u00a7</footnotemark> But that c\u00e1se is nb au,1 .. tnonty.</p>\n<p data-order=\"29\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AVd\">But it is said, though this- may be the rule in <em>England, </em>it is not the la'w here. The words of the statute are'broad and extensive; but in the construction of them, this court have decided, that an appeal will not lie from every - order of the court of chancery. No general rule has been, settled, by the adjudi-. cations of this court, that embraces this question. This court will consider the circumstances of each case, as it arises. Costs in the court of chancery are at discretion, and xvhere that discretion has been exercised, in principle,, there is an end to the-question. This court is modelled on that of the <em>English hous% \u2022of- lords, </em>as a court of appeals, arid the decisions of that tribunal have alxvays b\u00e9en regarded as precedents in this court. -It would not be expedient, or good, policy, for this court to hear appeals from decisions on matters of costs merely. The alloxvance or disalloxvance of them, by the chancellor, must depend on the consideration of a variety of circumstances in the court beloxv, which cannot be made to appear here. The court of chancery, in <em>England, </em>rarely grants a rehearing for costs only;<footnotemark>\u01c0\u01c0</footnotemark> and never Unless in case of mistake or palpable injustice; and even in those cases great caution is used in granting .a rehearing.<footnotemark>**</footnotemark> This court, as it cannot have the same knowledge of all the cir<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"504\">*504</page-number>curnsianc.es, ought to- exercise much, -greater caution in the air ioxving of appeals in mere, \u00a1matters- of costs. \u00a1 ' ;.\u2022\u2022\u2022.

Suppose, a bill filed against a faithless trustee, and it should be made to appear that lie was. guilty of gross fraud in relation to his trust, and the complainant should die before the final decree ; his personal representatives Come into court for a ^revival, and they are told that they may have their rights, but no costs which have accrued. It maybe that the costs amount to the value of t-hpir rights. \u25a0&gt; -</p>\n<p data-order=\"41\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b515-13\">An interlocutory order is granted upon motion, or petition, not on a hearing. A final decree does not depend on the time when it is .made, but on- its relation to the essence and merits of the cause, after a full hearing of all the parties, and when the object of inquiry has been ascertained and examined. The question as to costs was reserved, by the first decree, in the ..lifetime of <em>Ezekiel Travis </em>/ and will a silence on the subject, in the subsequent decree, deprive the appellants of their costs ?</p>\n<p data-order=\"42\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b515-14\">In courts of law, judgments are sometimes amended, where interest has been omitted.

The hosts which accrued prior to the \u2018 death of <em>Ezekiel Travis \u00a1\u00a1 </em>and, 2dly. The costs which have\u2019 arisen since the appellants became parties upon the bill of revivor. ' . ' . \u25a0</p>\n<p id=\"b516-6\">In examining ttiti claim for costs which arose prior., let thb abatement of .\u2018the . .suit, this oon'sideratioh: -is presented ; to.-wit, \u25a0that the duty of conveying the land, which was established by the decree tif fhe 27'th'of Oc&lt;o6\u2019e^T:808;: (\u00e1ndafter.wards affirmed: in this court,) became separated from the obligation to pay bests, (if any .such:obligation existed,); when the. suit abated by -the <em>death-of-Ezekiel Travis.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b516-7\"><em>The </em>conveyance of the, land was due exclusively- to the heirs arid devisees.;.; and1 the costs (if any .were .equitably dtife) could only be claimed by. the executors or admitiistr'atqrs, tif. <em>Ezekiel Travis. - , '\u25a0 \u25a0 .</em></p>\n<p id=\"ArW\">Upon examining \"the authorities cited on the argument, \u25a0 (Hall <em>v. </em>Smith, <em>1 Bro. Ch. Cas. </em>438. <em>White </em>v. <em>Haywood, </em>2 <em>Ves. </em>461. 1 <em>Dick. 173. </em>Kemp <em>v. Mackrell, </em>2 Ves. 580. <em>Morgan v. Scudamore, </em>3 <em>Ves. 195. Lloyd v. Powis, </em>1 <em>Dick. </em>16., and <em>Blower v. Mowets, </em>3 <em>Atk. </em>772.,) it appears to be an established \u2022rul\u00e9 in .equity, that where there has been no decree tor costs; and the' suit abates by the death of the .party,; the fight to, costs,. up to that time-, \u2022 is'extihg.uished, <em>unless-the costs'are payable out of a particular fund, or are connected with a duty towards the costs.</em></p>\n<p id=\"AKvM\">\u25a0 \u2018 According to the aflegatrans in the bill of revivor; in this case) which -was taken <em>pfb confessa, </em>the appellants claim only tin th\u00e9 - character of <em>heirs </em>and <em>devisees </em>of <em>Ezekiel Travis ; </em>it not being av\u00e9rred that .any person -had accepted or assumed the office of-executor or administrator. Fit follows, therefore, that th\u00e9 appellants havenoright to tfre costs which accrued in the \u2022lifetime of <em>Ezekiel </em>Travis;. because those .costs,, if tollo w \u00e1b\u00ede,, \u00e1re due to his <em>personal representatives\u25a0 </em>and .although th\u00e9. ex-ecutors might, have -been joined with the heirs and,devisees in the bill of \"revivor; yet it is cleat, that they . rimst;- (in shell\" \u00a1case,, be deemed parties for <em>entirely distinct objects. </em>The heirs and devisees sue for the conveyance of the land, and the executors for the costs tif the- original suit only. '</p>\n<p id=\"b517-2\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"507\">*507</page-number>To test the rule, therefore, let us suppose that, upon the death of <em>Ezekiel Travis, Waters </em>\"had voluntarily conveyed the land to the appellants; and the executors of <em>Ezekiel Travis </em>had then filed .their hill of revivor for costs of the original suit; could the suit have been revived - for the purpose of obtaihing those costs ? I think not. It would have been a bill of revivor <em>for costs only; </em>and as no decree had passed for costs, before the suit abated, the claim for posts <em>moritur cum persona.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b517-3\">Whether the executors alone attempt to revive the suit, or \u2022whether they join, with the heirs for that purpose, their object Wpuld be, in both cases,, <em>singly, for costs, </em>unconnected with any other duty as to them; not payable from any fund, and \u2022 not within any. \u00a1of the exceptions to the general rule, which is common to courts of law and equity* that where the suit abates before judgment or decree, the claim for costs is extinguished.</p>\n<p id=\"b517-4\">It would, therefore, have been useless to have directed the bill to lie over till the executors or administrators, if any, should be made parties:; nor was it necessary for <em>Waters </em>to plead or demur to the bill of revivor, for the want of proper parties, because the claim of the executors for costs must have been unavailing,: Besides, it is never necessary to plead or demur to a bill, if the bill itself contains no. equity, which is the, case in this bill of revivor, in regard to costs in the abated suit. ... -</p>\n<p id=\"b517-5\">Whether the appellants would have been entitled to the costs tyhich accrued since the death of <em>Ezekiel T^dvis, </em>if their proceedings had been regularly conducted for that object, I deem it unnecessary to decide, It is certain, however, that .a very broad discretion belongs to the chancellor in regard to costs, and that the right to costs is by no means a necessary consequence of the relief prayed for and obtained; on the contrary, there, are many cases, where equity grants the relief s.ought for, Upon condition of paying costs to the defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b517-7\">The rule of practice, in equity, is, that if the <em>final decree </em>be silent as .to costs, and the question of costs is not <em>expressly reserved, </em>the court will not listen to a subsequent application for costs, except it be on a reheating upon the merits, which is.sometimes applied for merely.for the purpose of introducing such a reservation as to costs. (Herle v. <em>Greenbank, </em>1 <em>Dick. </em>370.)</p>\n<p id=\"AjBb\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"508\">*508</page-number>A question has been made,, whether the decree of 'the 31st of <em>May,. </em>18:13,. <em>was'final </em>pf <em>interlocutory ? </em>.</p>\n<p id=\"A3XV\">According to <em>Harrison's Practice in Chancery, </em>(622.,) \u201cA decree is <em>final, </em>when all the circumstances and facts material and necessary lo. \"a complete explanation of the. matters in litigation .are brought before the court, and so fully and clearly ascertained by the pleadings on both' sides, that \u2018the j court is enabled', from them, to collect the respective merits of the parties litigant, and upon full consideration of the case made opt and relied upon by each, determines between them, 'according to equity and good conscience.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"AI-\">. \u2018.'.A decre\u00e9' <em>i^interlocutory, </em>when\"it happens.that some \u2022material circumstance or fact, necessary to be made known fo the court, is either not stated in the pleadings, or so imperfectly ascertained by them, that the court, by-reason, of-\u25a0 dipt defect, is unable to determine <em>finally </em>between the parties'; and,- there* fore,' a reference to,-or an inquiry before, a\"master, or a trial of the facts before a jury, becomes necessary t\u00f3.have the doubts occasioned by that defect removed. The court, in the mean time, suspends itsfinal, <em>judgment, </em>until,; by the.master\u2019is report, or the verdict of a jury, if is enabled to decide <em>finaliyM</em></p>\n<p id=\"A9F\">According to these definitions, it seems to me his honour, the chancellor,.' was correct in deciding; that .the order of the 31st of'May,. 1813, is to be regarded as <em>the final decree </em>in this cause. V ^ <em>'\u25a0 '</em></p>\n<p id=\"AT68\">By the <em>bill, Tryvis </em>.claimed1 a conveyance for the whole parcel of land originally contracted for, and insisted upon certain .'pay ments in\u2018money,; Ox;en, and turnips. , By the' <em>answer,. Waters </em>denied any payments made on account of the land ; and, as to part of. the premises in question, he alleged, as a defence, that lie had) with tire consent of <em>Ezekiel Travis, </em>conveyed 50 acres of it to one person, and 150 acres to another, (not naming who those persons were.) \u25a0 \u2022 \u2022' i..</p>\n<p id=\"Are\">All. the facts stated by way of excus\u00e9, or defence, in the an*. \u25a0 swer, were put at issue by a <em>general replication.. :</em></p>\n<p id=\"AhzX\">The chancelfor ordered a trial \u00f3f feigned issues; - to- ascertain, \u2022 \"... \u2022'</p>\n<p id=\"AyAi\">1st- .Whether <em>Travis </em>paid,'6Q pounds, in <em>M\u00e1yj-1787, </em>. as. part consideration of these lands ?. \u25a0 . -y . ..</p>\n<p id=\"AQ3l\">2d.

Whether, in <em>November, </em>1807,. <em>Travis, </em>in like manner, paid a yoke of oxen, valued at 16 pounds ? . .</p>\n<p id=\"AIH_\">The verdict upon each of these issues was in favour of Travis, thereby establishing the fact of those <em>three </em>payments, on account of this land, at the times there stated; but it must here be remarked, that the two other material facts put in issue by the pleadings,, were perfectly <em>unascertained, </em>when the chancellor made the decree of the 27th of <em>October, </em>1808.</p>\n<p id=\"b519-5\">By the appellant\u2019s case, it is expressly stated, that \u201c the defendant below made no proof of the conveyances alluded to in his answer, nor of the partition with <em>David Johnson, </em>nor qf any other conveyances, except that two discredited witnesses .said, in general terms, that <em>Waters </em>had sold so many acres of this land with <em>Travis\u2019s </em>consent.\u201d Nor was there any inquiry made, nor any evidence received, upon the interrogatories in the cause, in regard to the <em>quantity </em>or <em>value </em>of the <em>turnips </em>stated to have been delivered in part payment for the land.</p>\n<p id=\"b519-6\">By the <em>interlocutory </em>decree (as I consider it) of the 27th of <em>October, </em>1308, it was ordered, \u201c that the defendant convey to the complainant, in fee, and in severalty,, by a good and sufficient deed in the- law, so much of the lands contained in said lot, No. 39, not exceeding three fourths of one half of <em>the </em>said lot, as the said defendant hath not become incapacitated to convey, by reason of the partition, and of the release- and conveyances aforesaid; and that it be referred to a master to-take an account of the quantity of land, part of said lot, which is to be conveyed as aforesaid.\u201d And, further, that, the master state an account, charging the land at eight shillings per acre, with, interest,- and crediting the <em>three </em>several payments found upon the feigned issue, with interest; and, also, directing the master to report as to the amount of the <em>turnips </em>sold by <em>Travis </em>to <em>Waters.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b519-7\">This reference to the master, therefore, was not merely to calculate interest, and state an account upon/\u00aeed dataon the contrary, that reference involved an inquiry, by the master, whether <em>Travis </em>had, or had not, made a payment in turnips, oft account of the land ; and, if any, to what amount ? .It also involved, not .merely a survey, but an inquiry whether <em>Waters </em>had executed a deed or deeds of conveyance for any part, and how much, of the premises ip question, to any other person, as <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"510\">*510</page-number>sel forth in his answer; no such conveyance ever having been or exhibited.</p>\n<p id=\"pABH2\">ft is clear, therefoi*e, '.that,, -by the pleadings, - and-the facts found .by the verdict on the feigned issues., it did Lot fully appear how much had-been paid by <em>Ezekiel Travis,, </em>on account ef the land; nor did'it' appear how much of the land contracted-for, <em>Waters </em>remained capacitated to: convey. These essential facts remained to be ascertained by the. master\u2019s report, before <em>o. final decree </em>could bs pronounced,</p>\n<p id=\"b520-6\">The decree of the 31st of <em>May, </em>18.13,, was founded on the master\u2019s report, and the other interlocutory proceedings in. the .cause. It finally settled the respective rights of the. parlies, \u2022upon the whole merits; and consummated; the suit; by ordering <em>Waters, </em>upon payment to him of <em>13 </em>dollars and 34. cents, to convey to the appellants, the parcel of land in the said report, particularly mentioned arid described,\u2019!' in the proportions previously settled. \u25a0</p>\n<p id=\"b520-7\">This decree was taken by the appellants <em>ex parte, </em>as advised by their counsel.; and must be 'considered As. allowing-fhem' all that they asked for, No further equity was reserved. The appellants paid to <em>Waters </em>the balance repprted -to be due: to him,, pud he obeyed the decree in executing the conveyance to' them.</p>\n<p id=\"AYCX\">As 1 understand the practice; the solicitor for-the,- c\u00f3mplafof ant's was irregular- in entering that order or decree, <em>ec\u00f3:parte, 'in .v\u00e1caiio.n, zuithout notice to Ms adversary. Waters </em>might have obtained an order'to vacate if fqr irregularity but he! waived that objection; tho| is,'he admitted the. decree to be of the.same force and effect, as . if it had been entered, upon a hearing after regular .notice, ' <em>\u2019</em></p>\n<p id=\"A0r\">'According, therefore, to the -settled practice in chancery, \u25a0which, is similar'in ahalogd\u00fcs -pf\u00f3c\u00e9ecRbgs. ^t'-law,\"-the.dl\u00e1iniTor' costs was waived by .the appellants in taking a final decree'for the land.without reservation : and that claim could n^ver be\u2019re-'. vlved, but upon an application' to open- the final decree upon its. merits. Such an application was -never made: on the ,contrary, the-.appellants\" actually d'ematided,1 and accepted!- a performance' of that decree; . and after .the \u2022.decree wa.s- thus completely executed,\u2018a rehearing, If applied-for,!- would not (1 presume) have been gratited. . . \u2018 \" ' 1</p>\n<p id=\"b520-10\">j am not prepared to say, that an appeal-, will not lie, in any ,p|se?'tir <em>costs </em>But, in fhjs case, the-.motion for' icosts Is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"511\">*511</page-number>to be considered as an application' to be reinstated in a claim which had been waived ; or as a motion to excuse a <em>loches </em>or <em>default </em>of the party claiming costs: and, in that view, I think the order of the chancellor, refusing such <em>indulgence </em>upon a point of practice merely, is not a subject of appeal under our constitutian, and the statute regulating appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b521-4\">By that statute, \u201c any person aggrieved by any order or decree in chancery, may appeal,\u201d &amp;c.</p>\n<p id=\"b521-5\">To be \u201c <em>aggrieved,n </em>is to be \u201c <em>injured in one\u2019s right f </em>and a person who waives his claim, suffers <em>damnum absque injuria, </em>and cannot be legally said to be <em>\u201c aggrieved</em></p>\n<p id=\"b521-6\">The appellants have lost their right to claim costs, by their own <em>loches, </em>or default, in not asserting their claim according to the regular course of proceeding in chancery: and in the late, case of <em>Sands </em>v. <em>Hildreth, </em>in this court, it was decided, that if a party be concluded of his rights <em>by his own default </em>in the court below, this court will not sustain an appeal for the purpose of reinstating him.</p>\n<p id=\"b521-7\">I am, therefore, of opinion, that the order appealed from ought to be <em>affirmed.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b521-8\">Thompson, Ch. J., Van Ness, J., and Yates, J., were pf the same opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b521-9\">Arnold, Bicknell, Cantine, Rabcliff, .Stewart, Tibbits, and Verbryck, <em>Senators, </em>also concurred.</p>\n<author id=\"b521-10\">Spencer, J.,</author>\n<p id=\"ARZY\">said, that as to the preliminary question, he thought the <em>Engtish </em>House of Lords would not entertain an appeal for costs merely. It was, however, more a question of practice than principle; and though appeals ought not to be encouraged, he was inclined to the opinion, that, under the pro-, visions of our statute, an appeal might lie from a decree for Costs.</p>\n<p id=\"b521-11\">As to that part of the decree of the chancellor, relative to the costs which accr'tied during the lifetime of <em>Ezekiel Travis, </em>he thought it correct: but as to the costs subsequent to the bill of revivor, he was of opinion, that the decree, so far as respected the disallowance of those .costs, ought to be reversed.</p>\n<p id=\"AGQh\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"512\">*512</page-number>' Clark, Crosby, Prendergast, Ross, Swift, Tabor, Van Schoonhoven, and Wendell, <em>Senators, </em>concurred.</p>\n<p id=\"AYj\">A. majority ofthe court being of opinion, 'that the .decree-of; the court of chancery ought to be affirmed,- it was thereupon -ordered, Adjudged, and decreed, that; the decree, of th;e court of chancery be affirmed; that the petition and appeal be.-dismiss\u00e9d, and that the appellants pay fo the respondent\u2018his costs, to be taxed by the clerk of this Court; and -that the respondent have his execution..therefore out of the court of chancery; arid that the record be remitted, &amp;c.. ^ ' - \u25a0</p>\n<p id=\"A7uy\">Judgffient.dfaffirmance.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
