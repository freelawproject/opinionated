The plaintiff declared against the defendant, as maker of a promissory note, for 530 dollars, dated 9th December, 1805, payable 15 months after date plea <em>non assumpsit.</em></summary>\n<summary data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"AJO\">At the trial, the not\u00e9 Was proved. A witness testilled, that a short time previous to the date of the note, . r a barn belonging to the plaintiff was burned, and it was generally reported in the neighbourhood, that it had been Set on fire by the defendant. On the 9th December, 1805, the plaintiff and the defendant were together, at the house of the witnesss, when the defendant asked the plaintiff to proceed to business, and the plaintiff replied, that \u201c he did not know that they had any business.\u201d The defendant said, \u201c you know we have agreed to settle, and 1 am to give my note.\u201d The plaintiff said, he did not wish the defendant to do so, if he was innocent. The defendant asked the plaintiff what was th\u00e9: amount of his loss ; and was answered, twelve' Kut\u00eddr\u00e9d dollars.\u201d The defendant said, \u201c it was hard, for he Was innocent j\u201d and after some further conversation, the witness drew the note in question, which was subscribed by the defendant, but not' delivered io the plaintiff. No other consideration was mentioned than what was stated by the witness. After the note was made, the plaintiff said, it was best to keep the transaction a secret; and for that purpose the note sheuld remain with the witness, whose hands it has ever since continued. The defendant told the plaintiff, it would be in the power of plaintiff to do him an essential service, by publishing recantation of the charge against the defendant, as to burning the barn, and that the plaintiff believed him in<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"27\">*27</page-number>oecnt. The plaintiff promised to make such a publication in the <em>Canadarqua Gazette. </em>About six months after the date of the note, the plaintiff not having made the publication, some conversation took place between him and the defendant, in which the plaintiff said he should not make the publication, not conceiving it to be his duty to do so; that he did not know that he had any note against the defendant, and if there was any note in the hands of the witness, he might deliver it up to the defendant.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b39-4\">It was admitted, that a bill of indictment, on which the plaintiff\u2019s name appeared as a witness, had been found against the defendant, for burning the plaintiff\u2019s barn.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b39-5\">The defendant\u2019s counsel moved for a nonsuit, which was overruled by the judge, who told the jury that a voluntary note, though without consideration, was valid in law; that it was a vested gift, and that the defendant was under a legal obligation to pay it; and the jury, under the direction of the judge, found a verdict for the plaintiff.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b39-6\">A motion was made to set aside the verdict, and for a new trial.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b39-7\"><em>Cady, </em>for the defendant, contended,</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"A9Ai\">1. That the note was without consideration, or that the consideration had failed; 2. That the note never was delivered to the plaintiff; 3. That it was extorted from the defendant, by taking an undue advantage of his situation; 4. That the declaration of the plaintiff to the witness, that he did not know that he had any note against the defendant, and that if there was any note in the hands of the witness, he might deliver it up to the defendant, amounted to a surrender of the note, and was a waiver of \u2022 any right of action upon it: <em>S. </em>That the judge misdirected the jury.</p>\n<p data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"Amj\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"28\">*28</page-number><em>Sedagwick, </em>contra, insisted, that the maker of a promis- <footnotemark>*</footnotemark> \u2019 _ ., sory note was not allowed to aver a want or consideration ;* but that here the delivery of the note as a compensation for an injury, was a sufficient consideration.<footnotemark>\u2020</footnotemark> It cannot be said that the note is void, as given to sti\u00f1\u00e9 a prosecution for a felony; for there was no stipuIati\u00b0n on the part of the plaintiff not to prosecute, or to withhold his evidence.<footnotemark>\u2021</footnotemark></p>\n<footnote data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"footnote\" id=\"x999-1\" label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b40-4\"> 2 <em>Bl.

A parol promise to pay money, as' a gift, is no more a ground of action, than a promise to deliver a chattel, as a gift. It is the delivery which makes the gift valid. <em>Donatio perficitur possessione accipientis. (Noble </em>v. Smith, 2 <em>Johns. Rep. </em>52.) The ^question then was upon the delivery and consideration \u00a1of the <em>note; </em>for if there was no consideration for the note, it was a <em>nude pact, </em>and void as between the original parties to it. This is the true point in issue, and without giving any opinion upon it, to the prejudice of a future inquiry, a new trial' is awarded, with costs to abide the event of the suit.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
