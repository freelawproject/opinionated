They, immediately, hurried him along with them to the river, and pushed him into a boat, without his hat or great coat, which were afterwards brought to him. On being asked why they treated the plaintiff in that manner, <em>Alargan </em>said he had a bail-piece and authority to carry the plaintiff to <em>Connecticut. </em>The witness understood that <em>Pierpoint Edwards </em>ivas the bail, and had deputed <em>Alargan </em>to take the plaintiff, who had promised, the day before, to go along with him, having been called on by <em>Alargan, </em>with the bail-piece, for that purpose.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b159-14\">The defendant gave in evidence, the certified copy of the bail-piece, and the power above stated, which <em>Morgan </em>t had with him, at the time the plaintiff was taken; audit was proved that the defendant acted by the request of <em>Alorgan, </em>as his assistant. When <em>Morgan </em>demanded entrance, or that he would break the door, a voice answered from an <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"148\">*148</page-number>upper room, and' soon after the outer door was broken: r , open.'

The defendant and <em>Morgan </em>treated the plaintiff with great roughness, and the witness expostulated' with them' for treating the plaintiff so harshly. The plaintiff admitted that <em>Morgan </em>had the bail-piecey but declined going/ as he was on another bail-piece; and said he had made a. settlement with <em>Morgan, </em>who had no right to take him., The reason assigned by <em>Morgan, </em>for going to the plain\u2014 tiff\u2019s house in the night-time, and for hurrying him away/was the fear of a rescue, as <em>Parker </em>had taken the plaintiff on another bail-piece. \" .</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b160-9\">The counsel for the plaintiff objected . to the evidence, offered on the part of the defendants; but the objections were overruled by the judge. ,</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b160-10\">' It was' proved by a witness, who Was a counsellor of law- of the state of <em>Connecticut\u25a0, </em>that by the practice of the courts of that state, special -bail might,take their principal when they pleased, and surrender him into the custody of the sheriff, without any copy of the :bail,-piece,; that the paper offered in evidence, by the defendant, as, a bail-piece, was in the form used in the courts of <em>Connec</em>ticut. \u25a0</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b160-11\">\u00bf The judge charged the jury, that the defendant was justified by the authority under which he acted, to take-the plaintiff and carry him to <em>Connecticut, </em>to surrender him.. That-special bail had a right to enter, by force, into the house of the principal, after a reasonable demand of entrance and a refusal. That if the defendant had abused the authority under which he acted, he was liable for such abuse. That the questions of fact, whe<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"149\">*149</page-number>iher the defendant had made a demand to be admitted before, the door was broken, and whether undue and unnecessary force had been made, use of in attempting to make the surrender, were submitted to the jury for their decision. If the jury were of opinion, in favour of the plaintiff, as to either of those facts, they ought to find a verdict for the plaintiff, otherwise, for the defendant; that in his opinion, there was evis dence to justify a belief that <em>Edwards </em>had paid the mo- \u25a0 ney in the suit, in which he was bail for the plaintiff, in Connecticut, or had become liable for, the same; for had he not paid the money, or become answerable for the plaintiff, he would not have brought an .action on the judgment against the plaintiff in this state; and that though <em>Edwards </em>had sued the plaintiff for the same cause, and held him to bail, in this state, he was authorized to take the plaintiff on the bail-piece, and carry him to <em>Connecticut, </em>and surrender him there.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b161-5\">The jury found a verdict for the defendant.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b161-6\">A motion was made to set aside the verdict, and for a new trial, on the following grounds :</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b161-7\">1. That special bail cannot delegate their power:to take and surrender the principal, unless in case of neces-: sity, and such necessity must be clearly shown to exist.-</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b161-8\">2. That if the power could be delegated, yet, neither the bail nor his deputy can take the principal in a place, out of the jurisdiction of the state, in the court of which the recognisance has been taken.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b161-9\">3. That the bail in this case, having paid, and so discharged the judgment in the state of <em>Connecticut, </em>and having elected to proceed against the bail in this state, for the same cause of action and hold him to bail here, could not, afterwards, surrender him in the original action. .</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"21\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b161-10\">4. That special bail c\u00e1iinot break open the outer door of the house, td' take' the principal.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"22\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b162-7\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"150\">*150</page-number><em>Van Buren </em>and <em>Woodward, </em>for the plaintiff.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"23\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AG3a\">1.\" There \u00e1re no authorities in point, to show that the bail may delegate their power. The power of the.bail cannot, as is pretended by the defendant, be unlimited, so that they may take the principal at all times, in all places, and under all circumstances. It is evident, from the expression used by the court in <em>Boardman' and Hunt </em>v. <em>Fowler </em><footnotemark><em>*</em></footnotemark><em> </em>that the power of the bail to depute, is confined to a <em>case of necessity. </em>This seems to be the reasonable rule. The confidence of the principal in his bail is <em>personal; </em>and the power ought not, except <em>ex necessitate, </em>to be transferred to a stranger.</p>\n<p data-order=\"24\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b162-8\">2. The law supposes the principal to be alwaj's in the custody of his bail; but the power of the bail over the principal is not derived from any agreement between them, but from the court: and the court cannot authorize \u25a0the bail to take the principal, in a place where the court could not authorize an arrest. In an <em>anonymous </em>case, in Shower,<footnotemark>\u2020</footnotemark> it is said, if the principal abscond, and the bail cannot find him, they shall have a warrant, or tip-staff, to take him out of <em>White Friars, </em>or any other pre tended place of privilege, because he is a prisoner to the. court. No cases are to be met with, which are decisive on this point. The court must, therefore, decide on-principle, and with a view to the consequences which may result from the doctrine contended for, by- the defendant.</p>\n<p data-order=\"25\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b162-10\"><em>3. </em>The defendant had no right to break open the outer door of the plaintiff\u2019s house. A-man\u2019s house is regarded, by law, as his <em>castle,</em><footnotemark><em>\u2021</em></footnotemark><em> </em>and is <em>privileged, </em>except for the purpose of serving criminal process.</p>\n<p data-order=\"26\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b162-12\">4. The <em>bail, </em>in <em>Connecticut, </em>having brought an action' against the principal, on which he has held him to bail in \u25a0this state, has thereby waived his. right to surrender him,.. in the original suit. .The plaintiff must be considered,', in the custody of his bail here, and cannot be taken out of the state.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"27\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b163-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"151\">*151</page-number><em>E. Williams, </em>contra,</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"28\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AWR\">i. This court have decided, that \u201e , . , , bail may depute, <em>ex necessitate: </em>and the court will now presume, that the necessity, in this case, was shown at the trial.</p>\n<p data-order=\"29\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b163-7\">In <em>Fisher </em>v. Fallows,<footnotemark>*</footnotemark> Lord <em>Ellenborough </em>held, that the bail were entitled to recover, in an action of <em>assumpsit, </em>all the expenses he had been put to, in sending after the principal, for the purpose of surrendering him; he said, that if the principal absconds, so that he cannot be had, the bail may use every proper and necessary step to secure him. It is a necessary inference, from this decision, that the <em>English </em>courts consider the bail as having a right to depute another to take the principal. In the case of <em>Meddowscroft </em>v. <em>Sutton,\\ </em>the executors of bail were allowed to surrender the principal. Not a doubt was suggested of their right to make the surrender. This is a deputation, by operation of law; and it shows that the right of making the surrender is not personal, or to be exercised only by the bail themselves.</p>\n<p data-order=\"30\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b163-9\">2. Then can this power be exercised out of the state, in which the recognisance wras taken ? If this power must emanate from the court, in which the party was held to bail, then it could not be- exercised out of the jurisdiction of such court; and in the case of a recognisance of bail, in a court of <em>common pleas, </em>the bail could not take their principal, in another county; but a doubt has never been entertained, that on a bail-piece from any court of common pleas, the principal may be taken in any county in the state. But this power of bail does not depend upon any authority, or process of the court. It results from an implied contract, between the principal and bail, arising out of the relation between them; the principal having been, at his own request, taken from the custody of the sheriff, and delivered into the custody of his bail, where he is bound to remain, and, in contemplation of law, always does remain. This engagement follows the principal wherever he goes, and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"152\">*152</page-number>wherever the bail can find him. Thus, it has been well said,<footnotemark>*</footnotemark> \u201c The bail have their principal on a string, and may pull the string whenever they please, and render him in their own discharge; they may take him even upon a <em>Sun- </em>and confine him until the next day, and then surrender . . , him; the doing it on <em>Sunday, </em>is no service ol <em>process. </em>In <em>French\u2019s case,</em><footnotemark><em>\u2020</em></footnotemark><em> </em>the bail took their principal in the <em>city </em>of <em>London, </em>and committed him to the <em>Compter </em>there, in order to remove him by <em>habeas corpus, </em>and surrender him, in their discharge, in the court of <em>King\u2019s Bench,. </em>in which the original suit was brought; and before the surrender could be made, he was charged with a debt, at the suit of the <em>crown;- </em>but the court held, notwithstanding, the bail might take the prisoner, and surrender him in the King\u2019s Bench.</p>\n<p data-order=\"31\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b164-6\">The doctrine is this: the bail may take the principal, <em>when </em>and <em>where </em>he pleases; no time is so holy, on which it may not be done; no place is so sacred, into which he may not enter, for that purpose. He has the principal always on a string, and though extended to the remotest corner of the earth, he may pull it when he pleases. In <em>Wood </em>v. <em>Mitchell,</em><footnotemark><em>\u2021</em></footnotemark><em> </em>in the K. B., where the defendant had been convicted of felony, and sentenced to transportation, the court ordered an <em>exoneretur </em>to be entered on the bail-piece.</p>\n<p data-order=\"32\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AJh\">3. In <em>Sheers </em>v. <em>Brooks,</em><footnotemark><em>\u00a7</em></footnotemark><em> </em>Lord <em>Loughborough </em>said, when a party. is bailed, the bail have a right to go into the house of the principal, as much as himself; they have a right to be continually with him, and to enter, when they please, to take him.\u201d The bail had a right, then, to break the door. The judge, at the time, seemed to think, that there should be a reasonable demand of entrance, and a refusal, before breaking the door. This fact, if necess\u00e1ry to be shown, must have been found by the jury. The court will now intend, that it was proved.</p>\n<p data-order=\"33\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b164-12\">4. It does not satisfactorily appear, for what the suit was brought, against the plaintiff, by his bail, in this state. It may have been for the charges and expenses, the bail <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"153\">*153</page-number>has been put to, in attempting to make a surrender. If it Was for the amount of the original judgment, that fact ought to have been clearly and fully proved. There was no evidence, whatever, that the judgment had been satisfied or discharged. I shall not, therefore, argue this point.</p>\n<p data-order=\"34\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b165-3\">As to the abuse of the power, by the defendant, or the actual violence used against the plaintiff, the jury have decided on the fact; and there is no ground for granting a new trial, where the plaintiff could recover, at most, but <em>nominal </em>damages.<footnotemark>*</footnotemark></p>\n<footnote data-order=\"35\" data-type=\"footnote\" id=\"x999-1\" label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b162-6\"> 1 <em>John</em>s. <em>Cas. 314.</em></p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote data-order=\"36\" data-type=\"footnote\" id=\"x999-2\" label=\"\u2020\">\n<p id=\"b162-9\"> <em>Show. </em>202. <em>3 Vin. 498.

Several questions were made on the argument of this case. The first in order was, whether bail could depute or authorize another person in his stead, to take and surrender his principal. In <em>Boardman </em>v. Fowler, (1 <em>Johns. Cas. </em>314.) decided in this court, the surrender was made by an agent of the bail, and one of the objections taken to it was, that bail could not depute for this purpose. By the form of the' certificate, however, the principal appeared to have surrendered himself, and the court said they would presume it was done voluntarily. But if it had been necessary to decide the question, they were inclined to the opinion that special bail may depute, <em>ex necessitate. </em>The case of <em>Meadowscraft </em>v. Sutton, (1 Bos. &amp; <em>Pull. </em>62.) shows, that the executor of bail may surrender the principal. This may fall within the rule suggested in the last case; but they both go to establish the general principle, that the right to surrender results from the relation between the bail and principal; that it is to be effected as circumstances shall require, and is not-a personal power or authority, tobe executed by the bail only. Lord <em>Ellenborough, </em>in <em>Fisher v. </em>Fellows, <em>(5 Esp. Cas. </em>171.) allowed bail to recover against his principal the expenses of- sending after him to take him, for the purpose of making a surrender. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"154\">*154</page-number>The bail, says he, has a right to surrender the principal in his own discharge, and for his own security; and if the principal absconds, so that he cannot be had, the bail may take every proper and necessary step to secure him. It is not expressly stated, that the person sent after the principal was deputed to take <em>him; </em>but it is fairly to be presumed, that such was the fact. I see nothing, on general principles, against allowing this power to be exercised by an agent or deputy; and no case is to be found where the right has been denied. It is a general rule of law, even with respect to public officers, that their ministerial acts may be performed by deputy; and with respect to private individuals, the law recognises the act of an authorized agent as equal to that of the principal; and there is no principle of policy which renders it necessary to make this case an exception.</p>\n<p id=\"b166-6\">The next inquiry is, as to the right of bail to take the principal out of the state in which the recognisance was entered into. I do not perceive- how any question of jurisdiction can arise here. The power of taking and surrendering is not exercised:under any judicial process, but results from the nature of the undertaking by the bail. The bail-piece is not process, nor any thing in the nature of it; but is merely a record or memorial of the delivery of the principal to his bail, on security given. It cannot be questioned, but that bail in the common pleas would have a right to go into any other county in the state to take his principal; this shows that the jurisdiction of the court in no way controls the authority of the bail; and as little can. the jurisdiction of the state affect this right, as between the bail and his principal. How far the government would have a right to consider its peace disturbed, or its jurisdiction violated, or whether relief would not be granted on <em>habeas </em>corpus, where a citizen of this state was about to be carried to a foreign country, are questions not now before the court.</p>\n<p id=\"b166-7\">A recurrence to a few cases in the books, showing <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"155\">*155</page-number>the relation in which the law considers the bail as standing towards his principal, will render it obvious, that the power with which he is clothed is not one restricted in its exercise to any particular place. Sir <em>William Blackstone </em>(3 <em>Com. </em>290.) says, the security given for the appearance of a party arrested, is called bail, because the defendant is delivered to the surety, and is supposed to continue in his friendly custody, instead of going to gaol.</p>\n<p id=\"b167-6\">Bail, in the language of the books, are said (6 <em>Mod. </em>231.) to have their principal always upon a string, which they may pull whenever they please, and surrender him in their own discharge. They may take him up, even upon a Sunday, and confine him until the next day, and then surrender him. The doing so on <em>Sunday </em>is no service of process, but rather like the case where the sheriff arrests a party who escapes, for that is only a continuance of the former imprisonment. Lord <em>Hardwicke </em>says, (1 <em>Atk. 237. Ex parte </em>Gibbons,) it is the constant language of courts, that bail are their principals\u2019 gaolers, and that it is upon this <em>notion </em>that they have an authority to take them ; and that, as the principal is at liberty only by the permission and indulgence of the bail, they may take him up at any time. The same principle is recognised in <em>Shoxjuer, (Anonymous Case, </em>214.) where it is said by the court, that bail are but <em>gaolers, pro tempore; </em>and in case a man absconds, and his bail cannot find him, they shall have a warrant to take him out of any pretended place of privilege, in order to surrender him, because he is a prisoner to the court, and they may call him at pleasure. If the principal is to be considered as standing in the situation of a prisoner who has escaped from the arrest of the sheriff, according to the language of one of the cases, can there be any reasonable doubt but a sheriff, in such case, would have a right to pursue and arrest his prisoner in a neighbouring state; and, by parity of reasoning, bail must have the like authority. The cases I have referred to are suEciefit to show that the law' considers the principal as a prisoner, whose gaol <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"156\">*156</page-number>liberties are enlarged or circumscribed, at the will of his <em>\u00b0 </em>bail; and, according to this view of the subject, it would \u25a0 Seem necessarily to\" follow, that, as between the bail and his principal, the controlling power of the former over the latter ro.a)7 be exercised at all times and in all places ; and this appears to me indispensable for the safety and security of bail.</p>\n<p id=\"b168-6\">Another\" question presented was, whether the bail had a right to break open the outer- door of the plaintiff\u2019s house to make the arrest. The verdict authorizes us to presume, that a demand was made before entry; for this fact was submitted to the jury as being necessary to be shown by the defendant, to render the . entry lawful. That the bail may break open the outer door of the principal, if necessary, in order to arrest him,-follows, as a necessary consequence, from the doctrine,' that he has the custody of the principal; his power is analogous to that of the sheriff, who may break open an outer door to take a prisoner, who has escaped from arrest. But the case of <em>Shears </em>v. Brooks, (2 <em>H. Black. </em>120.) goes the whole length of this doctrine. Lord <em>Loughborough </em>there says, when a party is bailed, the bail have a right to go into the house of the principal, as much as he has himself. They have a right to be constantly with him, and to enter when they please, and take him. The right to break open the plaintiff\u2019s house, in the case before us, is fortified by the circumstance of his having been taken a few days before, on the bail-piece. His situation, in point of fact, as well as in judgment of law, was somewhat analogous to that of a party escaping from arrest.</p>\n<p id=\"b168-7\">One of the judges made an observation, in the case last referred to, which is very important, and shows, that, on all these points, the rights of the bail should be liberally considered. He said, that a determination, in that case, against the right of the bail to enter the house, would affect the liberty of the subject, as it would make it extremely difficult to procure bail.</p>\n<p id=\"b169-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"157\">*157</page-number>The objection, that the bail had discharged the judgment, and for his indemnity had arrested the plaintiff here) and held him to bail, is not supported by the requisite evidence to establish the fact. The loose declarations relative to a bail-piece against the plaintiff, in a cause for the same demand, was not such evidence as the case required, and was in the power of the party. There is nothing in the case to warrant us in saying that the time to surrender had elapsed. If that was the fact, it was susceptible of clear and positive proof; and if the plaintiff intended to rely upon that allegation, he was bound to support it by satisfactory evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b169-4\">Whether the authority to arrest was not abused by the exertion of undue force, or unnecessary severity, has been decided by the jury in favour of the defendant. This was matter of fact, proper for their determination, and was very fairly submitted to them. The verdict, therefore, on this point, ought not to be disturbed.</p>\n<p id=\"b169-5\">The motion for a new trial must be denied.</p>\n<p id=\"b169-8\">Spencer, J. not having heard the argument in the cause, gave no opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b169-9\">Rule refused.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
