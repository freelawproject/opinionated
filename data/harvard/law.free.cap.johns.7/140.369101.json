The defendant pleaded <em>non cep^ </em>and that the heifer was his property, &amp;c.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b152-11\">The cause was tried at the <em>Saratoga </em>circuit, before Mr., Justice <em>Van Ness.</em></summary>\n<summary data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b152-12\">At the trial, the plaintiff proved a regular bill of sale, and delivery of the heifer and other cattle, from. <em>Joseph </em>Pangburn, to the plaintiff, for the consideration of 100 dollars. While the cattle were in the possession of the plaintiff, the defendant took and drove away the heifer in question, alleging, that he took it for a debt due to him from <em>Joseph Pangburn.</em></summary>\n<summary data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b152-13\">The defendant moved for a nonsuit, and the judge decided that the plaintiff could not recover in this form of action. The plaintiff offered further evidence, to show that the defendant had no right, or claim of property whatever in the heifer i but the judge, being of opinion that the right of property could not be decided in this action, directed the plaintiff to be called, and he was nonsuited.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b152-14\">A motion was made to set aside the nonsuit, and for a new trial.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"AQm\"><em>J.

S., </em>and <em>J. H. </em>takes them, I may have replevin to recover the possession, because I have a right of possession, against every body but <em>j. S., </em>and y. <em>N. </em>is, therefore, a trespasser.-]: So replevin lies for goods, taken in execution, issued by an inferior jurisdiction. <em>Gomyns</em><footnotemark><em>\u00a7</em></footnotemark><em> </em>says, if a man tortiously takes the person or goods and chattels of another, and detains them, a replevin lies. \u201c Replevin lies of all goods and -chattels unlawfully taken.\u201d In <em>Viner,</em><footnotemark><em>\u00b6</em></footnotemark><em> </em>it is said, if a <em>trespasser </em>takes beasts, replevin lies of this taking, at <em>election; </em>and he cites the <em>Tear </em>Books, ,7 <em>Hen. </em>IV. 28 <em>b. </em>6 <em>Hen. </em>VII. 9. 19 <em>Hen. </em>VI. 60.

Blackstone</em><footnotemark><em>\u2020</em></footnotemark><em> </em>expressly confines the remedy, by replevin, to the case of a <em>distress. </em>It is true, that there are <em>dicta </em>in the books, that replevin lies for an unlawful taking. But this must be such an unlawful taking, as is referred to by the statute, which speaks only of a replevin in case of a <em>distress. </em>The position of <em>Gilbert, </em>that replevin lies for -goods taken on execution issued by an inferior jurisdiction, is clearly erroneous. There are numerous authorities to the contrary; and it has been expressly decided, that a replevin will not lie for goods, taken by execution, in any case.<footnotemark>\u2021</footnotemark></p>\n<p data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b154-21\"><em>Non cepit, </em>and property, were the only pleas which the defendant could plead. He says, first, that he has not taken the goods in such a manner as will entitle the plaintiff to an action of replevin; and he also pleads, that they are his property, to entitle himself to a writ <em>de retorno habendo. </em>He could not avow; for it would be inconsistent with the \u00f3ther plea; and property cannot be given in evidence under the general issue, but must be pleaded in bar or abatement.<footnotemark>\u00a7</footnotemark></p>\n<p data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b154-22\">If replevin is allowed to lie in every case of an unlawful taking, it will produce great inconvenience, vexation and expense. It may be brought for the taking of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"143\">*143</page-number>the most trifling article, and the proceedings may be \u201c removed into this court. \u25a0</p>\n<footnote data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"footnote\" id=\"x999-1\" label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b152-15\"> <em>Bull.

The opinion I expressed, on the trial of this cause, that replevin lies only in the case of an unlawful distress, was a mistaken one. The passage to that effect, in <em>Blackstone's </em>Commentaries, is not warranted by the books. This action is usually brought to try the legality . of a <em>distress; </em>but it will lie for any unlawful taking of a chattel. Possession by the plaintiff, and an actual wrongful taking, by the defendant, are the only points requisite to support the <em>action; </em>and none of the cases, defining the nature of the action, confine it specially to the case of a chattel, taken under pretence of a distress,</p>\n<p id=\"b155-8\">The old authorities are, that replevin lies for goods taken <em>tortioushj, </em>or by a <em>trespasser; </em>and that the party injured may have replevin, or trespass, at his election. This is so laid down by Gascoigne, J. in 7 <em>Hen. </em>IV. 28 b. and by Danby, J. in 3 <em>Edw. </em>IV. 16. and by <em>Brian, </em>J\u201e in 6 <em>Hen. </em>VII. 9. and these <em>dicta </em>are cited as good law, in <em>Ero. </em>tit. Replevin, <em>pi. 36. </em>39. and in <em>Roll. Abr. </em>tit. Replevin, B. The same rule was admitted, by the judges, in the case of <em>Mason </em>v. <em>Dixon, (Jones's </em>Rep\u201e 173.) and in <em>Bishop </em>v. <em>Montague, (Cro. Eliz. </em>824.) Similar language is held, in many of the modern authorities, cited by the plain nil ?s counsel, upon the argument j and particularly by Baron <em>Gilbert, </em>Baron <em>Cojnyns, </em>and Lord <em>RedesJale. </em>The opinion of the latter is reported by <em>Schoales </em>and <em>Lefroy, </em>in which he lays down the law, \",1'idi peculiar accuracy and precision. The provisions in our statute (11 sess. c. 5.) apply chiefly to cases of illegal <em>distress; </em>but there is nothing which coniines the remedy to that particular injury.</p>\n<p id=\"b155-11\">If this question be considered upon principle, it is proper this action should be maintainable, wherever <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"144\">*144</page-number>there is a <em>tortious </em>taking of a chattel out of the pos= \u201e \u00b0 \u25a0 . r session of another. A great variety or cases might be stated, in which no damages which a jury is legally competent to give, can compensate for the loss of a particular chattel.</p>\n<p id=\"b156-7\">The nonsuit must, therefore, be set aside, and a new trial granted, with costs to abide the event of the suit.</p>\n<p id=\"b156-8\">Rule granted.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
