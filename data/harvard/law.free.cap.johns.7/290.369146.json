The plaintiff produced an exempilfication of\u2022 letter8 patent, issued the 29th day of ~anuar9, 1791, from the people of the state of Hew-Thrk, giving, granting and confirming unto Lieutenant Hongost Tewahengrialzaken an Oneida Inthan, as a bounty for his ser,rices during the revolutionary war, the lot in question \"to have and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"291\">*291</page-number>hold the above described and granted premises, unto the said <em>Hongost </em>Tewahengriahaken, <em>his heirs and assigns, </em>as a good and indefeasible estate of inheritance, for ever.\u201d It was then proved that the patentee was dead; and that after his death, on the <em>2d day of April, </em>1808, <em>his two sons and heirs, Hongost </em>and <em>David, </em>sold the premises In question to the lessor of the plaintiff, and gave him a deed accordingly, which was duly proved and recorded.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b303-4\">The defendant objected to the plaintiff\u2019s recovering, on the ground, that the above heirs (being <em>Oneida Indians </em>and residing with the <em>Oneida </em>tribe) were <em>aliens; </em>and therefore could not take by descent, which objection was overruled. But the judge decided,.that a deed from the Indian heirs was not valid in this case, on the ground that Indians are prohibited by law from selling their lands ; and the plaintiff was nonsuited.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b303-5\">A motion was made to set aside the nonsuit, and for a new trial.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b303-8\"><em>Cady, </em>for plaintiff.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"Aes\">The <em>37th article of </em>the constitution, for the purpose of preserving peace and amity with the Indians within the state, declares, that no sales or purchases from them shall be valid, unless made under the authority, and with the consent of the legislature.</p>\n<p data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b303-9\">The act passed the 18th March, 1788, <em>(Greenleaf\u2019s </em>edit. vol. 2. p. 194.) 11th sess. c. <em>85. </em>is founded on the constitution, and merely adds a penalty for any violation of the constitution in this respect. The act of the 4th <em>April, </em>1801, among the revised laws, 24th sess. c. 14/. merely follows the constitutional prohibition, and adds a penalty. It does not enlarge or extend that prohibition. The framers of the constitution could never have had in view a sale by an individual indian, who was a freeholder. The' preamble to the article clearly shows that they contemplated the Indians as tribes or nations, with whom it was necessary to preserve peace, for the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"292\">*292</page-number>safety and tranquillity of the state. The acts of the legislature relate only to public lands. There is nothing in the constitution, or the acts of the legislature, fairly construed, that incapacitates an Indian, who is a freeholder, from alienating his lands.</p>\n<p data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b304-8\">By the act concerning tenures, (10th sess. c. 36. s. 1.) it is declared lawful for every freeholder to alienate or dispose of his lands or tenements, at his pleasure. The legislature have allowed Indians to become freeholders; and by issuing patents of lands to them, their heirs and assigns, they are, by the very terms of such patents, authorized to sell and dispose of the lands granted to them.</p>\n<p data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b304-9\">The unrestrained power of alienation is an inseparable incident to an estate in fee-simple; and when an estate once .becomes assignable, it for ever continues assignable. By granting an estate of inheritance, or fee-simple,, to this Indian, the' legislature have given him the power to sell.</p>\n<p data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b304-10\">It cannot be objected, that the Indians are aliens, for by the act of the 28th February, 1789, (12th sess. c. 42. <em>Greenleafs </em>edit. Laws, vol. 2. p. 279.) lands held by any inhabitant or citizen of the state, since the 7th January,. 1770, cannot be defeated by any pretence of alienism! nor can any plea or pretence of alienism be objected, as to lands acquired between the 3d September, 1783, and the time of passing that act. Though the patent was issued in this case in 1791, it can make no difference, as all lands to which soldiers who have died were enti- - tied, are declared to have been vested in them in 1783.</p>\n<p data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b304-11\">The legislature, by their act, 22d sess. c. 13. granted lands to <em>John </em>Dennie, an Indian, and took a mortgage from him.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b304-12\">Gold, contra.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"A9\">1.

According to the law of descents established by this state, or accordr -ing to the customs and usages of the indian tribe ?</p>\n<p data-order=\"21\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b305-11\">From the well known condition of the Indians, they are presumed to be wholly ignorant of our laws; they are <em>inopes </em>consilii, and considered as wholly incapable of contracting. If the tribes or nations, acting in their collective capacity, are considered as incapable of selling their land, without the consent of the legislature, <em>A fortiori </em>an individual must be regarded as incompetent.</p>\n<p data-order=\"22\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b305-12\">The act of the 4th April, 1801, (24th sess. c. 147.) speaks of purchases made of any <em>indian </em>or <em>Indians; </em>thereby clearly intending to prohibit purchases from an individual as well as from a tribe.</p>\n<p data-order=\"23\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b305-13\">Because an indian is a freeholder, it does not follow= that he has a right to convey. Infants, <em>femes </em>covert, or persons <em>non compos </em>mentis, may be freeholders; yet they are incapable of conveying their lands while under - such legal disability. The right of transmitting proper<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"294\">*294</page-number>ty by descent, is not derived from the law of <em>nature} </em>but from the positive and arbitrary laws of civil society,<footnotemark>*</footnotemark> which are variously modified in different states, accord- <em>\u2022 J </em>ing to principles of public policy or convenience.

In the 21st section&lt;of the act of the 4th <em>April, </em>1801, the lands of the <em>Brothertown Indians </em>are made descendible to their heirs, according to our law of descents j and the widow of a deceased indian is declared entitled to remain in the house of her husbatid, during her widowhood ; and the superintendants are to assign her as much land as they may think necessary; which is wholly different from the law of dower as to our citizens. . But these benefits and privileges are not extended to any other tribe of indians.

J. delivered the opinion of the court.</author>\n<p id=\"AtUG\">It is stated in the case, that the heirs of the indian patentee, under whom the lessor of the plaintiff claims, by a deed of the 2d of <em>April, </em>1808, are <em>Oneida </em>Indians, and resi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"295\">*295</page-number>ding with the <em>Oneida </em>tribe. The plaintiff shows the deed without proving the consideration, or showing any particular legislative sanction for the conveyance, and the question is, whether the deed be valid in law.</p>\n<p id=\"b307-3\">It is a fact too notorious to admit of discussion or to require proof, that the <em>Oneida Indians </em>still reside within this state, as a distinct and independent tribe, and upon lands which they have never alienated, but hold and enjoy as the original proprietors of the soil. Their political relation to this state is peculiar, and <em>sui generis. </em>If they are not <em>aliens </em>in every sense, because of their dependence as a tribe, and their right to protection, they cannot be considered as subjects born under allegiance, and bound, in the common law sense of the term, to all its duties. But this is a question which I do not wish or mean to discuss, and I have only alluded to the condition of the <em>Oneidas, </em>to show that they come within the general provision in our constitution and laws, relative to purchases of land from the <em>indians </em>within this state.</p>\n<p id=\"b307-4\">The 37th article of the constitution declares that no purchase, or contract for the sale of lands which may be made with or by the indians within this state shall be valid, unless made under the authority and with the consent of the legislature.</p>\n<p id=\"b307-5\">This provision has been generally supposed, and perhaps correctly, to refer to purchases from the indians, as a tribe or community; for indians generally hold their lands in common, and do not know of individual property in land. But the legislature, in their earli\u00e9st provision on the subject of these indian purchases, carry their prohibition to all purchases from <em>individual </em>indians, as well as from the tribe; for the act of the 11th sess. c. 85. declares it to be a public offence to purchase, or contract for the sale of lands within this state, <em>with any indian or indians </em>residing within the limits of this state. The same prohibition, in the same words, was included <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"296\">*296</page-number>in the revised laws of 1801; <em>(Laws, </em>vol. 1. p. 464.) and. the act of 1801 goes further, and declares, (sect. 2.) that no person shall maintain an action, on any contract,, against any <em>Stockbridge </em>or <em>Brothertown </em>Indian, or <em>against any indian, residing on any lands reserved to the Oneida, Onondaga or Cayuga Indians. </em>If no suit will lie against the indian himself on such contract, it is her cause the law will not recognise it as .valid, unless made under the sanction which has since been provided. It is difficult to reconcile this provision in the act, with the validity ofx the deed before us. The various regulations in the act of 1801, all show the sense of the legislature, that an indian, in his individual capacity, is, in a great degree, <em>inops consilii, </em>and unfit to make contracts, unless with the consent and under the protection of a civil magistrate. The law not only protects Indians from any ,suit upon their contracts, but it declares specially, that all alienations of land by the <em>Brothertown </em>and. <em>NewStockbridge Indians </em>are void. \u25a0 These are just and humane guards against the imposition and frauds which that unfortunate people have not the power to withstand.. The same provisions prevail in the <em>Spanish </em>colonies. None of the Indians within the <em>Spanish </em>dominions can dispose of their real property, without the intervention of a magistrate. But the act of the 32dsess. c. 63. relates to the very subject before us. It provides that the heirs of Indians, to whom lands have been granted by this state, for military services, shall be, and are made capable of taking and' holding any such lands by descent, in the same manner as if such heirs were citizens of this state, at the death of their ancestors; and that-every conveyance, thereafter to be executed by such patentee, or his heirs, to any citizen of this state, for any such land, shall be valid, if executed with the approbation of the surveyor-general. The act of the next, or. 33d sess. c. 25. contains directions for the surveyor-general, calculated to secure, the more effectually, jus<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"297\">*297</page-number>tice to the patentee and his <em>heirs; </em>and there is a proviso in each of these acts, that nothing in them shall be construed to confirm or affect any prior conveyance from such patentee or his heirs. Such conveyances remain as if those acts had not been <em>passed; </em>and from the construction which I give to the prior acts of the 11th session, and of 1801, such contracts and conveyances, if executed by <em>indians residing with their </em>tribe, were absolutely void. The case is within the letter, and certainly within the spirit, of the several statutes on this subject. These statutes ought to be construed liberally for this purpose. The principles of public policy, a sense of justice and humanity, the honour of the state, and the conclusions of law, require us to consider such contracts as made with persons unfit to contract without the advice of disinterested counsel. I allude now only to contracts made with individual Indians, and not to purchases made from the tribe, in their, national or collective capacity. The nation, by its chiefs in council, is to be presumed competent to judge of its rights, and to preserve <em>them; </em>and private purchases from the nation or tribe are declared void upon other grounds.</p>\n<p id=\"b309-3\">The motion on the part of the plaintiff to set aside the nonsuit, is, therefore, denied.</p>\n<p id=\"b309-8\">Judgment of nonsuit.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
