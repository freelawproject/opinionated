The first count was on a promissory note, dated .the 14th <em>February, </em>1806, for 164 dollars and 44 cents, payable six months after date. The other counts were for goods sold, &amp;c., the usual money counts, and an <em>insimul computasseni. </em>The defendant pleaded <em>non assumpsit, </em>and payment, with notice of a set-off.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b318-13\">The cause was tried at the <em>New- York </em>sittings, the 13th of <em>December, </em>1809, before Mr. Justice <em>Yates. </em>It is unnecessary to state all the facts proved at the trial.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b318-14\">After the evidence was closed, and after the defendant\u2019s counsel had summed up to the jury, and while the plaintiff\u2019s counsel were addressing the jury, the counsel for the defendant informed the judge, that he had just discovered, from the inspection of a paper in the possession of one of the plaintiff\u2019s witnesses, who had been examined, that the money due on a note of <em>Thomas Bur dell, </em>for 3,000 dollars, and which the plaintiff con<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"307\">*307</page-number>tended comprehended the sum due for the goods of the plaintiff sold by <em>Sayre </em>and <em>Toler, </em>and for which the present suit was brought, was not, in fact, received by the assignees of <em>Sayre </em>and <em>Toler, </em>until <em>December, </em>1807, after the commencement of the suit; and asked permission to give the paper, or evidence of that fact, to the jury; but the judge thought he could not admit the evidence, unless the plaintiff\u2019s counsel would consent; which being refused, the evidence was rejected, and the jury found a verdict for the plaintiff, for 742 dollars and 77 cents, being the balance due on the account of the plaintiff.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b319-4\">A motion was made to set aside the verdict, and for a new trial\u00bb</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b319-5\"><em>Baldwin, </em>for the defendants.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AYZ\">The evidence offered xvas material; for the suit was brought in <em>August, </em>1807, to recover the balance of a consignment of goods from the plaintiff to the defendants, and for which they took the note of <em>Burdell; </em>and the money, as would have been proved, was not received by the defendants until long after the commencement of the suit, so that the plaintiff had no cause of action, at the time the suit was brought.</p>\n<p data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b319-6\">The judge had a discretion to admit the evidence, under the peculiar circumstances of the case. It was decided in <em>Byron </em>v. <em>Alexander,</em><footnotemark><em>*</em></footnotemark><em> </em>that the judge had .such a discretion in a similar case. And it is on the ground of a refusal of the judge to exercise that discretion, that we apply for a new trial.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b319-7\"><em>D. B.

It was so much money received to his use. Whether the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"308\">*308</page-number>assignee received the money before or after the commencement of the suit, cannot affect the plaintiff\u2019s right of action. The evidence, therefore, if admitted, would not have prevented a recovery.</p>\n<footnote data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"footnote\" id=\"x999-1\" label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"AsQ\"><em> 2 Johns.

The judge, under the circumstances of the case, had a discretion to admit the evidence; and it ought, in sound discretion, to have1 been received. We think, therefore, that the defendants are entitled to a new trial, with costs to abide the event of the suit.</p>\n<p id=\"b320-8\">Motion granted.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
