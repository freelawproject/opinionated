The cause was tried before Mr. Justice Ya<em>tes, </em>at the <em>New-York </em>sittings, in <em>December, </em>1809.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b323-6\">The goods were furnished by the plaintiffs for the use of the ship, between the 16th and 27th <em>May, </em>1806, and were delivered to <em>Benjamin Lord, </em>the master and one of the defendants. The articles were ordered for the use of the ship, by <em>George Townsend, </em>since deceased. The articles were charged in the books of the plaintiffs to the <em>debet </em>of the \u201c ship <em>Eleanor, </em>Mr. <em>George Townsend </em>and owners.\u201d No time of payment was mentioned, but the usual credit on such goods is six months. The defendants, <em>Richard Loines, James Loines </em>and Benjamin <em>Lord, </em>and <em>George Townsend, </em>were the owners of the ship, at the time the articles were supplied by the plaintiffs.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b323-7\">The plaintiffs, on the 20th <em>October, </em>1806, took from <em>George Townsend, </em>who was the ship\u2019s husband, his promissory note, payable in 90 days, for the amount of the account, and gave him the following receipt. \u201c <em>New York, October </em>20, 1806, received of Mr. <em>George Townsend </em>his note of this date at ninety days, for two hundred and thirty-two dollars thirty-two cents, in full for supplies of ship Eleanor.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b323-8\"><em>Townsend </em>died the 2d <em>December, </em>1806, and continued to pay his notes until the time of his death; but his estate afterwards proved to be insolvent. The clerk of the plaintiffs testified, that when he delivered the goods, and when the note was taken from <em>Townsend, </em>and the receipt given, he did not know that either of the present defendants was owner or interested in the ship, and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"312\">*312</page-number>that he did not believe that the plaintiffs had any knowledge of that fact, at that time; but were referred to the defendants as part owners, by the administrator of <em>Townsend, </em>some time after his decease. It was proved that the ship <em>Eleanor, </em>in <em>May </em>16, 1806, was advertised in the gazette, for <em>Liverpool, </em>for freight or passage, and application was requested to be made to Capt. <em>Lord, </em>on board, or to <em>J. </em>&amp; <em>R. Loines, </em>or to <em>George Toxvnsend; </em>and this gazette was regularly taken at the store of the plaintiffs, during the year 1806 ; but it was not proved that either of the plaintiffs had \u00e1ctually seen or read the advertisement.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b324-10\">A verdict was taken for the plaintiffs, by consent, subject to the opinion of the court, on a case in which the above facts were stated.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b324-11\"><em>S. Jones, </em>jun. for the plaintiffs.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"Aeh\">The defendants were owners of the ship at the time the supplies were furnished, and must be liable, unless the plaintiffs have done some act to discharge them.</p>\n<p data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b324-12\">The taking the note of <em>Toxvnsend, </em>who was a part owner and ship\u2019s husband, and giving him a receipt in full, is no payment or discharge of the original debt.<footnotemark>*</footnotemark></p>\n<p data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b324-13\">The giving a further credit of 90 days, beyond the usual term, can have no other effect than to enlarge the time of payment, as it respects the parties liable in the first instance. The plaintiffs have shown, as far as it was possible, that when they took the note, they did not know that there were other owners.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b324-14\"><em>Wells, </em>contra.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"ABj\">The original liability of the defendants, as part owners of the vessel, is not denied; but we contend that the plaintiffs, by their own act, have discharged them. The entry in the books of the plaintiffs shows that they were aware of there being other owners; and the advertisement and public notoriety of the fact, repels any inference of want of knowledge on their part.</p>\n<p data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b324-15\">If they did not mean to look to <em>Toxvnsend </em>alone, why <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"313\">*313</page-number>did they not inquire of him, at the time, as to the other oxvners? The plaintiffs took the note in full pdyment for the <em>goods; </em>and meaning to take the risk of its payment. The extension of the term of credit also shows this intention. If this had been the note of a stranger or third person, it xvould be considered as giving a new credit, and a discharge of the original <em>debtors; </em>and <em>Townsend, </em>in this transaction, may be considered as a third person. Again, the rights, of the defendants are affected by the credit given to <em>Townsend; for </em>if they had been called on for payment at the end of the six months, <em>Townsend </em>would have paid his proportion ; but the loss, as it respects him, has been occasioned by the act of the plaintiffs.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b325-11\">Jones, in reply,</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"Ay5\">observed, that in <em>Reed </em>v. <em>White and </em>Others,<footnotemark>*</footnotemark> a <em>nisiprius </em>cas\u00e9, before Lord <em>Ellenborough </em>and a special jury, itxvas decided that if a person supplies stores to a ship owned by several persons, and takes in payment the bill of the ship\u2019s husband and part owner, and settles with him alone, and afterwards renexvs the bill, he discharges the other owners; but in that case the other owners, being ignorant of the dealings between the plaintiff and the ship\u2019s husband, had suffered him to receive large sums of money as freight, which they would otherxvise have <em>detained; </em>and the renexval of the bill showed clearly the intention of the plaintiff to adopt him as the single debtor.</p>\n<footnote data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"footnote\" id=\"x999-1\" label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b324-7\"> <em>Tobey </em>v. <em>Barber, 5 Johns.

The taking of the note of <em>Townsend, </em>and giving a receipt in full, is no extinguishment of the original debt, unless the note was paid. There is no evidence that the plaintiffs <em>knew </em>that the other defendants were part owners. The case of <em>Reed </em>v. <em>White </em>proceeds on the ground that the plaintiff had taken the ship\u2019s husband, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"314\">*314</page-number>exclusively br his debtor, knowing there were other owners, and after a settlement of accounts between them and the ship's husband.</p>\n<p id=\"A5ON\">The plaintifTh are entitled to judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"A3X\">Jud~ment for the plaintiffs~</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
