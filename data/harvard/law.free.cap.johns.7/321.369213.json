Witness my hand, at <em>Aurelius, November </em>9, 1803. <em>Jonathan </em>Whitney.\u201d The counsel for the defendant moved for a nonsuit, unless the plaintiff proved the consideration set forth in his declaration, and the averment, as to the same consideration, there stated; but the objection was overruled by the <em>Chief </em>Justice, who decided, that the words, \u201c value received,\u201d in the note, were <em>prima facie </em>evidence of the consideration, and cast the burden of proof on the defendants to disprove it; and; thereupon, the jury, under his direction, found a verdict for the plaintiff, for 84. dollars and 45 cents.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"Acg\">Rodman, for the defendant.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"ATg\">I rely on the case of <em>Lansing </em>v. <em>M'Killip.</em><footnotemark><em>*</em></footnotemark><em> </em>It was there decided, after a consideration of all the cases, that where two good considerations are stated in a written contract, both must be proved as laid, though the promise express to be for \u201c <em>value received.\u201d </em>The doctrine is laid down in <em>Hughes </em>v. <em>Hughes,</em><footnotemark><em>\u2020</em></footnotemark><em> </em>at a Par0- promise, though in writing, is not valid, unless the consideration be proved. The words, \u201c value <em>1 </em>received,\u201d do not, of themselves, import a consideration, but it must be averred and proved,</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b335-2\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"323\">*323</page-number><em>Cady, </em>contra.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AII\">In <em>Jackson, </em>ex dem. <em>Hudson, </em>v. <em>Alexander,</em><footnotemark><em>*</em></footnotemark><em> </em>the court decided, that the words \u201c value received\u201d in a deed, .imported a sufficient consideration ; and the <em>Chief Justice, </em>in taking notice of the case of <em>Lansing </em>v. <em>M'Killip, </em>observed, that it was determined on the ground, that the words \u201c value received\u201d imported a consideration ; though two of the judges intimated an opinion, that they did not dispense with the necessity of averring and proving a consideration. If, then, these Words import a sufficient consideration in a deed, there is no good reason why they should not have the same effect in a simple contract.</p>\n<p data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b335-3\">Again, the plaintiff was entitled to offer the note in \u00bfevidence, under the money count.<footnotemark>\u2020</footnotemark> This gets rid of the objection, as to the necessity of proving the special consideration laid in the first count.</p>\n<footnote data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"footnote\" id=\"x999-1\" label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b334-8\"><em> 3 Caines' Rep. </em>236.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"footnote\" id=\"x999-2\" label=\"\u2020\">\n<p id=\"AuE\"> <em>7 Term Rep. 350. note a. </em>1 Comyn on Contracts, 10 <em>to </em>13. <em>Chitty on Bills, </em>12 62.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"footnote\" id=\"x999-3\" label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"AGr\"> <em>3 Johns.

The note is expressed to be given for <em>value received, </em>and the question is, whether that is not evidence, <em>prima facie, </em>of a consideration. Whatever might have been the true import of the decision in <em>Lansing </em>v. <em>M'Killip, </em>(3 <em>Caines, </em>286.) in respect to this question, is not now very material, for since the case of <em>Jackson </em>v. <em>Alexander, </em>(3 <em>Johns. Rep. </em>484.) the court cannot consistently say, that the acknowledgment of value received is not evidence of consideration in a note, as well as in a deed. It is sufficient to cast upon the defendant the burden of proving that there was no consideration. This rule is rea- . sonable and convenient. Notes payable in specific chattels are very common, and to compel the plaintiffs, in every instance, notwithstanding the note is expressed to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"324\">*324</page-number>be for value received, to prove the true aM id~entical$ consideration at large, is imposing upon hIm a\u2022 great and unnec~ssary hardship. The confession bf value bythe maker clf the note ought to be sufficient in the first in' stance.</p>\n<p id=\"b336-6\">Had the plaintiff in this ease declared upon the note,stating it to have been given for value received, and had not set forth a special and\" particular consideration, the production and proof of the note would have been sufficient to have put the defendant upon his- defence.- But having specified in what that value consisted; he was-bound to prove the averment as laid. A particular\" value charged was materially different from-value in general; and so it was lately held, in England, in <em>Knill </em>v. Williams, (10 <em>East, </em>431.) On this ground the verdict must be set aside for misdirection, and a new trial awarded, with costs to abide the event; but the plaintiff is at liberty to amend his declaration, by striking out- the special consideration set forth.</p>\n<p id=\"b336-7\">New trial granted-.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
