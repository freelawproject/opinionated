The lease contained a reservation, covenant and proviso,, as follows: \u201c And the said lessor for himself doth also save and reserve the one equal fourth part of all mo- * <em>1 </em>neys arising, or that may arise, by, or from the selling, . . . .

It was then shown that the defendant Came into possession by a purchase made at public auction, under an execution issued on a judgment in this court, confessed by <em>John </em>Corliss, the father of the defendant, in favour of the defendant, for 5,500 dollars debt, and 13 dollars and <em>7 </em>cents costs, signed the 2d October, 1805. Exemplifications of the judgment and execution were produced. The sheriff was directed to levy 2,500 dollars of debt, and 16 dollars costs; and the sheriff returned on the <em>fieri </em>facias, that he had made the sum of 1,483 dollars, and that for the residue of the debt, the defendant in this cause accepted the note of the defendant in the execution, in full satisfaction thereof: And it was proved that <em>John </em>Cor<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"533\">*533</page-number><em>iiss </em>was discharged under the insolvent act, the 8th March, 1806, and the present defendant was a petitioning creditor, and made oath, on the 30th <em>December, 1805, </em>that the insolvent owed him 1,086 dollars and 40 cents ; another son of the insolvent was a petitioning creditor for <em>1,175 </em>dollars, and his son-in-law was also a petitioning creditor for 1,280 dollars.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b545-4\">The plaintiff then produced witnesses, in order to prove that the judgment was confessed by <em>yohn Corliss </em>fraudulently, and for the purposes of defeating the covenant and condition in the lease. After the evidence on both sides was closed, the judge, after stating or commenting on the evidence, directed the jury that they must find a verdict for the plaintiff, subject to the opinion of the court as to the construction of the covenant for quarter sales; ,and the only question of fact for the jury to determine was, whether the judgment confessed by <em>yohn Corliss </em>was fraudulent or not; and that they must, in delivering their verdict, say it was fraudulent, or not, as they found the fact to be. The jury found a verdict for the plaintiff for 6 cents damages, subject to the opinion of the court, as to the construction of the covenant; and they also found that the judgment confessed by <em>yohn Corliss </em>was not fraudulent.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b545-5\">A motion was made to set aside the verdict and for a new trial.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b545-6\"><em>Wendell, </em>for the plaintiff,</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"ATv\">contended that th\u00e9 covenant not to assign without the permission of the lessor was legal and proper.<footnotemark>*</footnotemark> Admitting that the defendant came into possession, under the sale, and that the judgment was not fraudulent, still the lease was forfeited; for the confession of the judgment was a voluntary act, and only another mode of transferring or disposing of the property. In <em>Doe </em>v. Carter,<footnotemark>\u2020</footnotemark> where the jury found the fact that the warrant to confess judgment was given for the purpose of disposing of the property; <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"534\">*534</page-number>it ,was held to be in fraud of the covenant, and the lessor might re-enter, under the clause of re-entry, for breach of the condition, and might recover the premises in ejectment, from a purchaser at a sheriff\u2019s sale. The same doctrine was laid down in <em>Doe </em>v. <em>Hawke.</em><footnotemark><em>*</em></footnotemark><em> </em>But whether the confession was voluntary or not, the tenant was bound to give notice to the landlord; and there being no notice in this case, there was a breach of the condition, by which the lease became forfeited.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b546-10\"><em>Z.

No <em>notice </em>of an <em>offer </em>could be made ; for no 'offer existed. The sale under the execution is a sale by act of law, not by the party. It is a compulsory sale.</p>\n<p data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b546-11\">The covenant is void, for it can never be performed; it is against public policy, and ought not to be supported.</p>\n<footnote data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"footnote\" id=\"x999-1\" label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"AUx\"> <em>Woodfall, 314. </em>340 2 Term Rep. 134. 137.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"footnote\" id=\"x999-2\" label=\"\u2020\">\n<p id=\"A6p\"> 3 <em>Term.

The jury have decided the question of fraud in favour of the defendant. The covenant only applied to voluntary sales, by the lessee. The case of Doe, <em>ex dem. </em>Mitchinsen, v. <em>Carter </em>(8 <em>Term Rep. 57.) </em>is in point. The subsequent decision on that case, (8 <em>Term Rep. </em>300.) was founded expressly on the fact of fraud in confessing a judgment, for the purpose of enabling the creditor to possess the lease. There must be judgment for the defendant.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
