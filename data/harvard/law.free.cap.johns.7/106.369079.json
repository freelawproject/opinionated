The cause was tried at the <em>Orange </em>circuit, in <em>Septem</em>1809, when a verdict was found for the plaihtiff.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b118-20\">The cause turned upon a question of fact, whether the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"107\">*107</page-number><em>locus m quo </em>was a public highway. It is not necessary , , ... r . , , to detail the evidence given m the case, as the substance of the testimony is stated in the opinion of the court; and it would not be well understood without an inspection of the map produced at the trial.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b119-9\"><em>Fisk, </em>for the defendant,</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"ASS\">relied on the fact, as proved by the testimony of the witnesses, that the <em>locus in quo </em>was a public highway, leading to the dock of the defendant.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b119-10\">Caines,</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"Aae\">contra, contended, that the <em>locus in </em>quo, though part of a public way, leading from the highway to where the <em>ferry </em>was formerly kept, was not a legal <em>highway, </em>which is without a <em>terminus a </em>quo, or <em>terminus ad quem. </em>A public way for a particular purpose, is not a highway. If a way has been used as a way to a ferry, and the place where the ferry is kept is changed, the right of way in the public is transferred from the old to the new ferry.<footnotemark>*</footnotemark> Where a right of way lies in usage, it must be shown to be constantly in the same place ; not in one place to-day, and in another place to-morrow.<footnotemark>\u2020</footnotemark> Again, the right is shown to the whole road, not to anv 0 <em>7 J </em>particular spot in the road. A right to any particular spot cannot be maintained, when the whole road has been transferred. When the road has been once changed to a different place, all rights under it, as an ancient road, are gone.</p>\n<p data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b119-19\">This road was never laid out and reserved as a public highway. The defendant purchased under the Goldens, and must be bound by their acts. A bargain and sale of land, with a way to it, does not pass the <em>way, </em>for the sale conveys only the <em>use; </em>and there cannot be a use of a way created <em>de novo.</em><footnotemark><em>\u2021</em></footnotemark></p>\n<footnote data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"footnote\" id=\"x999-1\" label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"AkG\"> <em>Cam.

Y. </em>vol. 1. p. 595.) declares, that every such road shall be taken and deemed a public highway,- although no record thereof has been made. The evidence in this case greatly preponderates in favour of the usage. The defendant produced seven witnesses, all of whom had known the road for above twenty years next preceding March, 1797, and all declare, that it had been used during all that time as a public highway, leading to the dock and landing of the defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b120-6\">The witnesses on the part of the plaintiff do not essentially contradict the defendant\u2019s witnesses. They principally go to prove that the road in question, at the intersection of Water-street, had been removed some feet more to the south than it was formerly, but they admit that it had not varied where it passed over the premises of the plaintiff; and they all concur in the declaration that there is no way of getting to the dock and landing in question but by means of this <em>road; </em>for that <em>First-street </em>has never been used, and ever has been, and still is, impassable. There is likewise one important fact established by the witnesses, and not contradicted by any, and that is, that from the year 1743 there had been a ferry kept at the defendant\u2019s landing, under a charter granted to <em>Alexander Golden; </em>and that before the war, during the war, and for some time after the war, there was no other ferry kept across the Hudson, at <em>New-burgh, </em>but the one at the defendant\u2019s dock.</p>\n<p id=\"b120-7\">The verdict ought, therefore, to be set aside, and a new trial granted, upon payment of costs.</p>\n<p id=\"b120-8\">New trial granted.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
