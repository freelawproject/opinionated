This measure had been determined on from the moment Mr. <em>L. </em>took the liberty of exercising the right of a freeman, in supporting such a candidate for governor as he deemed most suitable to fill the office. From that mo~ meat too, a fawning sycophant, by the name of David 7'/w~ ~nas~ (a misrepresentative in coDgress, and a major-general b~r commission,) had fixed his eye upon the office.

Under the circumstances, it was hoped Mr. <em>Thomas </em>would not succeed. It was hoped that the legislature would frown this creeping sycophant, this grovelling office-seeker, back to his duty at <em>Washington; </em>that they would spurn at his impudent attempt at reaching after blessings. But the hope of his disappointment did not rest on this ground alone. Doubts existed both as to his ability and his integrity. We are told that letters were circulated among the members of the legislature previous to taking the question on the appointment, in which it was stated, that this <em>David Thomas, </em>a few years since, was indicted by a grand jury of Washing\u2022\u00bb <em>ton </em>county, for receiving a quantity of counterfeit money, with intent to pass it. That on his trial, before the <em>petit </em>jury, one witness expressly swore to the fact; but this witness being an accomplice, his testimony was not deemed sufficient to convict the accused, and on this ground alone he was acquitted.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b277-7\">The publication of the libel, on the 2d February, 1808, by the defendant, was proved; and it was admitted, that the paper in which it was published had extensive circulation, and that the libel referred to the plaintiff.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b277-8\">The defendant read in evidence a record of the indictment, trial, and acquittal of the plaintiff, by which it appeared that the plaintiff was indicted at a court of <em>oyer </em>and terminer, held in <em>Washington </em>county, in the year <em>1797, </em>for knowingly receiving certain counterfeit bank bills from one <em>Samuel A. </em>Gibbs, with intent to pass them; on which indictment he was tried and acquitted by the jury.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b277-9\">The defendant then called several witnesses to show what took place at that trial. It appeared that <em>Gibbs </em>and some others, his associates, had been apprehended for passing <em>counterfeit </em>bills, and were confined in gaol in <em>Washington </em>county; and <em>Gibbs </em>sent for the plaintiff, (who ,was the only acting magistrate in Salem, where <em>Gibbs </em>was confined,) for <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"266\">*266</page-number>the purpose of making some disclosures. The gaoler was called out of the room and left the plaintiff with <em>Gibbs, </em>\u00bfut retui'necl in less than two minutes, and, in the opinion Gf the gaoler, who was a witness, it was not possible for <em>Gibbs </em>to have delivered the bills, as he pretended, to the plaintiff, during the absence of the witness. A witness proved, that <em>Gibbs </em>had said \u201c he would send the plaintiff to the state prison, if he should roast in hell for doing it and several other witnesses also testified to similar declarations of <em>Gibbs, </em>to show his malice against the plaintiff, and it was proved that he was a person of bad reputation, and destitute of veracity. <em>Gibbs </em>was the only witness on the trial of the plaintiff on the indictment.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b278-4\">Two newspapers entitled \u201c <em>The Republican Crisis,\" </em>one dated the 16th <em>February, </em>and the other the 22d <em>July, </em>1808, and also two papers called \u201c <em>The </em>Balance,\u201d dated the 2d and 13th <em>June, </em>1809, published by the defendant, were offered in evidence to show the malice of the defendant against the plaintiff. The defendant\u2019s counsel objected to reading any papers in evidence, which had been published since the commencement of this suit, but the objection was overruled by the judge. The first two-papers were then proved to have been printed at the press of the defendant; and no objection being made for want of -proving that the other two papers were also printed by the defendant, the whole were read in evidence.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b278-5\">It was proved that the plaintiff was a member of congress in the winter of 1808, when congress was in session, and that he came from <em>Albany </em>to <em>Washington </em>a short time before he was appointed treasurer of this state, and was in <em>Albany </em>at the time of his appointment, and immediately after entered on the execution of the duties of his office, and did not return again to <em>Washington; </em>and that a paper containing the charge against the plaintiff as to the indictment, &amp;c. was circulated and delivered to several members of the assembly, on the morning of the day of his appointment, and previous to the passage of the bill for that purpose,</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b279-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"267\">*267</page-number>The judge charged the jury, that the charges of sycophaacy, grovelling office-seeking, and misrepresentative m congress, were clearly libellous; but if the jury believed that the plaintiff had abandoned his post in congress in pursuit of the office of treasurer, and that such abandonment of his place, was a violation of his duty as a member of the house of representatives, the charges were substantially supported, and that it was not necessary for the defendant to prove them literally true. As to the other part of the libel, he observed, that it was undoubtedly true that the defendant had a right to publish a correct statement of the indictment against the plaintiff, and of his trial and acquittal ; yet, when he undertook to make such publication, it was his duty to give a true statement. That the defendant, in this case, put the plaintiff\u2019s acquittal solely on the ground, that Gibbs, the only witness who testified against him, stood in the light of an accomplice, when, according to the evidence, it appeared that his credit was otherwise materially impeached. His honour was, therefore, of opinion, that the plaintiff was entitled to recover, though he did not think the <em>innuendoes </em>in the plaintiff\u2019s declaration were warranted by a true construction of the libel; but that the jury had a right to judge, taking into consideration the whole libel and' the evidence, whether it was the intention of the defendant to charge the plaintiff with being guilty of the crime for which he had been indicted. That if they .found a verdict for the plaintiff, they ought to give him such damages as, under all circumstances, they should think him entitled to receive. The jury found a verdict for 400 dollars damages.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b279-5\">A motion was made to set aside the verdict and for a new trial.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b279-6\"><em>Z. R. Shepherd </em>and <em>Van </em>Vechten, for the defendant.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AHi\">1. The admission in evidence of newspapers published after the alleged libel, and subsequent to this action^ was im<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"268\">*268</page-number>proper. It may be said that they were admitted merely to show the intention or malice of the defendant. But malice or evil intention is the very essence of a.libel, and evidence of malice furnishes ground to the jury to enhance the damages. If the subsequent publications prove the malice of the defendant, and aggravated damages are given on account of the supposed malignity of the author, the plain-! tiff will recover damages also for the subsequent publica- \u25a0 tions, though not libellous.</p>\n<p data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b280-10\">But, publications since the commencement of the action cannot show the intention of the defendant in publishing the original libel; for the last publication may have been provoked or justified by the subsequent conduct of the plaintiff. Such evidence is irrelevant, and ought not to be admitted to prejudice the defendant. The subsequent publications, if examined, will not .justify any inference of malice; and it was improper to permit them to have any influence with the jury, so as to enhance the damages.</p>\n<p data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b280-11\">Again, the plaintiff must state his complaint specifically, so that the defendant may come prepared to meet it; but how can he be supposed to be prepared to meet subsequent publications not stated in the declaration. In <em>Mead </em>v. <em>Daubigny,</em><footnotemark><em>*</em></footnotemark><em> </em>Lord <em>Ellenborowgh </em>refused to admit evidence of other words spoken by the defendant, as were in themselves actionable, being clearly of opinion that such evidence was not admissible.</p>\n<p data-order=\"21\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b280-12\">2. The judge misdirected the jury. He, should not have left it to them to decide whether the plaintiff, by leaving congress, had violated his duty. Again, the defendant is not liable to an action for publishing a correct statement of what took place at the trial of the plaintiff ;<footnotemark>\u2020</footnotemark> and if the substantial fact is justified, the <em>innuendoes </em>in the declaration were immaterial. The <em>innuendoes </em>are not warranted by.the context; the jury ought, therefore, to have been directed to find for the defendant.</p>\n<p data-order=\"22\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b280-13\">The publication was substantially true; its object was to animadvert on the legislature; there was no evidence of malice towards the plaintiff.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"23\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b281-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"269\">*269</page-number>J. <em>Russell </em>and Skinner, contra.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"24\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AHf\">1. There are numerous decisions which show that other papers, libellous as well as not libellous, published after as well as before the action, may be given in evidence to show the intention of the defendant, or <em>quo animo </em>he spoke the words or published the libel; though the jury must give damages only for the libel charged in the plaintiff\u2019s declaration. This doctrine was laid down by Lord <em>Kenyon, </em>in <em>Mead </em>v. Daubigny,<footnotemark>*</footnotemark> and <em>Lee </em>v. <em>Huson,</em><footnotemark><em>\u2020</em></footnotemark><em> </em>and by Lord <em>Ellenborough, </em>in <em>Plunkett </em>v. <em>Cobbett,</em><footnotemark><em>\u2021</em></footnotemark><em> </em>and <em>Rustell </em>v. <em>Maquister.</em><footnotemark><em>\u00a7</em></footnotemark><em> </em>. The evidence is not admitted to increase the damages, but merely to prove the fact of publication, or the intention of the defendant.</p>\n<p data-order=\"25\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b281-7\">111T1 \u00ab 2. To decide whether the judge was correct in stating to the jury that the plaintiff was entitled to recover, the court must determine on what is the true construction of the libel. In the case of <em>Stiles </em>v. <em>Nokes,</em><footnotemark><em>\u00b6</em></footnotemark><em> </em>it was held libellous to publish a highly coloured account of judicial proceedings, interwoven with the party\u2019s own comments, conclusions and insinuations.</p>\n<p data-order=\"26\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b281-9\">If the <em>innuendoes </em>are not pertinent or material, they may be rejected as surplusage.<footnotemark>**</footnotemark> The truth or falsehood of innuendoes, is matter of fact for the consideration of the jury.<footnotemark>\u2020\u2020</footnotemark></p>\n<footnote data-order=\"27\" data-type=\"footnote\" id=\"x999-1\" label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b280-7\"> <em>Peake's </em>N. <em>P. </em>125.

The grounds taken in support of the motion for a new trial, are, 1. That newspapers pub\u00fcsh\u00e9d after the libel, were admitted in evidence, and without being proved to have been published by the defendant; 2. For the misdirection of the judge; 3. Because the verdict was against evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b281-15\">The papers supposed to have been improperly admitted in evidence were two newspapers, entitled \"<em>The Republican </em>Crisis,\u201d of the 16th of <em>February </em>and 22d <em>July, </em>1808. The libel was published in a paper of that title of the 2d of <em>February, </em>1808, and that paper, it was admitted, was published by the defendant, and it was also admitted that he was the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"270\">*270</page-number>editor and publisher of that paper from the 20th of Janua<em>ry </em>to the 1st or <em>December, </em>1808. It was proved by <em>Rey-nolds, </em>a printer, that on comparing the papers of the 16th of <em>February </em>and 22d of <em>July, </em>wiih the one containing libel, they were printed at the same press. This evidence proved the defendant to have been the printer of the two papers objected to, in as full a manner as was necessary. The papers, \u201c <em>Albany Balance, and New-York State </em>Journal,\u201d of the 2d and 13th <em>June, </em>1809, were not objected to, as the case states, for want of proving that they were printed by the defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b282-7\">The question, then, is, was it proper to give in evidence publications made after the libel. It has not been objected that they were libellous; and the plaintiff\u2019s counsel put their right to reading them on the ground that they afforded evidence of the defendant\u2019s malice in the original publication. . The <em>nisi prius </em>decisions on this point are somewhat contradictory. All of them agree that in actions .for written or verbal slander, other and posterior publications or words, not actionable, may be given in evidence to show malice. In <em>Rustell </em>v. <em>Maquister, </em>(1 <em>Campb. N. P. </em>48. <em>in the notes,) </em>Lord <em>Ellenborough </em>said, that although there had been formerly such a distinction, it was not founded on any principle; that any words, as well as any act of the defendant, may be given in evidence to show <em>quo animo </em>he spoke the words; but that the judge should tell the jury to give damages only for the words which were the subject of the action.</p>\n<p id=\"b282-8\">\u25a0 In <em>Mead </em>and <em>Daubigny, (Peake's N. P. </em>126.) and <em>Cook </em>v. <em>Field, </em>(3 <em>Esp. N. P. Cas. </em>33.) Lord <em>Kenyon </em>refused to permit words actionable, spoken afterwards, to be given in evidence. But in <em>Lee </em>v. <em>Huson, {Peake, </em>166.) in an action for a libel, the same judge suffered other libellous papers to be given in evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b282-9\">Perhaps this is not the occasion to lay down any rule on the subject, it not being necessary to this case, nor do the court mean to do it. But I should think it incorrect to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"271\">*271</page-number>suffer distinct libellous matter to be given in evidence ; for though the judge might instruct the jury not to give damages for such libels, yet it would imperceptibly influence their judgments as to the damages, and thus the defendant might be tv/ice punished for the same offence.</p>\n<p id=\"b283-5\">On the point of misdirection, the judges charge is objected to in three respects ; 1. In leaving a question of law to the jury, whether the plaintiff had violated his duty in leaving <em>Washington </em>and soliciting the office of treasurer;</p>\n<p id=\"b283-6\">2. That the <em>innuendoes </em>give a sense not warranted by the context in this, that the libel did not amount to the charge that the plaintiff was guilty of the crime of receiving a quantity of counterfeit money, with intent to pass the same knowing it to be counterfeit, and that on this ground the judge ought to have charged the jury to find for the defendant;</p>\n<p id=\"b283-7\">3. That the defendant\u2019s publication of the plaintiff\u2019s trial was substantially true; that its object was to animadvert on the legislature, and therefore it ought to have been submitted to the jury whether there was malice in the defendant towards the plaintiff, as evidenced by the libel.</p>\n<p id=\"b283-8\">It must be a matter of fact whether the plaintiff\u2019s leaving <em>Washington </em>and coming to Albany, for the office of treasurer, (if he did so,) was or was not a violation of duty; and this would depend upon the circumstance whether he had leave of congress to absent himself or not. Unexplained, it is to be presumed that he had such permission. It can-pot be pretended that a member of congress is so far bound to yield his personal attendance, that absence, with leave of the body to which he belongs, is a violation of duty. Congress have a right to enforce the attendance of members,, and they have a right to dispense with such attendance. Congress are the judges, and no man is obnoxious to the charge of abandoning his duty there, who leaves it by permission; but this question is at rest by the verdict of the jury.</p>\n<p id=\"b283-10\">An innuendo, as has been often decided, cannot add or enlarge, extend or change the sense of the previous words pnd the matter to which it alludes must always appear from <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"272\">*272</page-number>the antecedent parts of the declaration; but when the new matter stated in an <em>innuendo </em>is not necessary to support the action^ it may be rejected as surplusage. \u25a0 (1 Chitty, 383, 9 East, 93. <em>Roberts </em>v. Camden.)</p>\n<p id=\"b284-4\">The judge admitted the defendaiit\u2019s right to publish a correct account of the plaintiff\u2019s trial, but limited this right to the publication of a true history of it; and he stated, that the defendant had put the plaintiff\u2019s acquittal solely on the ground, that Gibbs, the only witness, stood in the light of an accomplice, when it appeared that his credit was otherwise materially impeached, and that on this ground the plaintiff was entitled to recover.</p>\n<p id=\"b284-5\">There is not a <em>dictum </em>to be met with in the books, that a man, under the pretence of publishing the proceedings of a court of justice, may discolour and garble the proceedings by his own comments and constructions, so as to effect the purpose of aspersing the characters of those concerned. In the case of <em>Stiles </em>v. <em>Nokes, (7 </em>East, 493.) the court laid down the true distinction; and whilst they admitted that a fair account of judicial proceedings might be published with impunity, they held that the writer could not introduce his own comments, insinuating the commission of perjury. It is impossible to read the libel in this case, without understanding that the defendant meant to insinuate that the plaintiff had received the counterfeit money with intent to pass it. But it is said that the animadversion was not on the plaintiff, but on the legislature, for appointing the plaintiff treasurer without investigation. How was the legislature blamable for making the appointment, unless the indictment and trial of the plaintiff, as published by the defendant, held up the plaintiff as probably guilty, notwithstanding his trial and acquittal ? If the only witness stated himself to be an accomplice, and was otherwise totally discredited, from the infamy of his character, and his malice tow-.rds the plaintiff, (and on these grounds the plaintiff was acquitted,) what investigation was to be made? I am perfectly satisfied that the libel contains a highly coloured ao <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"273\">*273</page-number>count of the proceedings, that it suppresses, for bad purposes, material facts, and that it conveys insinuations of the plaintiff\u2019s guilt, unauthorized by the trial and the facts which transpired at the time of the trial; and if so, the inference of maiffe was inevitable.</p>\n<p id=\"b285-4\">T' ese remarks have anticipated the last point raised, that the v \u25a0\u2022flier was against evidence. I will only add, that the vis'd\" \u00bbJ was, in my opinion, perfectly correct.</p>\n<p id=\"b285-9\">Motion denied.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
