It has been decided, (6 <em>Mod. </em>22. 1 <em>Burr. </em>434. 4 <em>Burr. </em>1963. 1 <em>Str. </em>652. 2 <em>Str. </em>826. 1 <em>Term Rep. </em>270, 271. <em>Cowp. </em>109. 214.) that after 18 and 20 years, a bond will be presumed to have been paid. The obligee ought to show a demand of payment, and an acknowledgment of the debt, within that time, to rebut this presumption.</p>\n<p id=\"b568-12\">Motion denied.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
