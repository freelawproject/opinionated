The debt must be extinguished by such release, which must be binding and conclusive, as Mrs. <em>De Diemar </em>was the residuary legatee, and administratrix with the will annexed. An administrator cannot release a debt without a <em>devastavit:</em><footnotemark><em>*</em></footnotemark><em> </em>and he makes himself liable for the whole debt. Is there any thing in this case to take it out of this general and well settled, rule of law ? The object of the agreement was to save the plaintiffs from costs, and to secure them, in case they should fail in recovering the debt, after a <em>bona fide </em>attempt for that purpose, in <em>England. </em>.There is nothing in the agreement which authorizes <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"410\">*410</page-number>the plaintiffs to do any thing more than could be legally done by an ordinary administrator. As the law imposes a strict line of duty, the instrument is to be construed strictly, in regard to the conduct of the plaintiffs ; and unless they can clearly show a power to compromise the debt, they must be made answerable for the amount. They must be judged according to the law of <em>England. </em>The insolvent law of this state (24th sess. c. 131. s. 10.) specially authorizes executors and. administrators to become petitioning Creditors of an insolvent.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"Af1N\"><em>Hopkins, </em>contra.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AAQp\">This is not like the case of an action against an administrator for a <em>devastavit; </em>but I .will consider it in that point of view^ Though, generally speaking, an executor 'or administrator cannot release or compound a debt; yet if it is done for the benefit of the estate he is not made liable. In <em>Blue </em>v. Marshall,<footnotemark>*</footnotemark> Lord Chancellor <em>Talbot </em>held that an administrator who had released a tenant, who was insolvent, from the arrears of rent, on his giving up the possesr sion, was not responsible. It is j ust and reasonable that a beneficial compromise, made by an executor or administrator, should be allowed. It is fit and convenient that they should have this power; being answerable for its exercise in a manner beneficial to the estate. It is true, there are old cases to the contrary; and it was once held^ that an executor, or administrator could not release the penalty of a bond on payment of the condition, without a <em>devastavit; </em>but the modern doctrine is more rational. In <em>Norden </em>v. <em>Levit,</em><footnotemark><em>\u2020</em></footnotemark><em> </em>the court strongly inclined to the opinion .that the compounding of an action of <em>trover </em>by an administrator was not a <em>devastavit. </em>\u25a0</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"A_Mh\"><em>Harison, </em>in reply.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AM5\">The case of <em>Blue </em>v. <em>Marshall </em>was in a court of <em>chancery, </em>where matters aro decided. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"411\">*411</page-number>,\u00a1on equitable principles. But we are in a court of law, where equitable circumstances are not taken into consideration. Whether the debtor was insolvent, or not, or whether the compromise was beneficial to the estate, or not, cannot be objects of inquiry in a court of \u25a0It is enough that the plaintiffs have released the debt, so as to prevent the possibility of any future claim on the debtor. The rule of law is clear and settled, that if an executor or administrator submit a debt of 2\u00d3 pounds to arbitration, and the arbitrators award only 10 pounds, it is a devastavit, and the executor or administrator is liable for the whole.</p>\n<p data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b423-6\">In <em>Norden </em>v. <em>Levit,</em><footnotemark><em>*</em></footnotemark><em> </em>the payment was affirmed in the house of lords, and the administrator held liable for a <em>devastavit. </em>It is said, that this is the doctrine of the old cases; yet no modern determinations in courts of law have been shown to the contrary. Indeed, the law is too well settled to admit of a doubt.</p>\n<footnote data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"footnote\" id=\"x999-1\" label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"A_8\"> <em>Bac. Abr.

It appears by the.-covenant, that she took out letters of administration in England, <em>by </em>agreement with the.other parties to the covenant, for the express and sole purpose of collecting <em>Pomeroy\u2019s </em>debt <em>i </em>and in consideration of her doing this, she received a release and indemnity from the other parties. They were only to pay her the distributive share of her father\u2019s estate, in case <em>Pomeroy </em>should neglect or refuse to account and pay his debt. By releasing that debt, \"she has disabled herself from a remedy at law under the covenant. The breach contemplated by_ the parties has not occurred. The old and strict rule of law is, that an administrator cannot release a debt without being-responsible for it; and though this rule has been relaxed in equity, as between the administrator or executor and the legatees or next of kin, (and, perhaps, the same relaxation ought to take place at law, if a court of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"412\">*412</page-number>law should take cognisance of claims between such parties,) yet here the plaintiff has not fulfilled the condition precedent to a right of action upon this covenant. If the whole scope and intent of the agreement be compared and taken together, its meaning appears evidently to be, that the. plaintiff <em>Cornelia </em>was to invest herself with, the power of an administratrix, for a specific purpose, which was not that, she should exercise her discretion in collecting, compounding or releasing the debt of <em>Pomeroy. </em>It was merely that she should he vested with legal authority to demand and receive the debt. The administrators here never meant that she should assume or exercise any other or further power. To entitle herself to a remedy at law under this covenant, she was bound to execute this trust upon strict legal principles. By compounding the debt, she has taken it to herself, and judgment must be rendered for the defendant. judgment for the defendant.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
