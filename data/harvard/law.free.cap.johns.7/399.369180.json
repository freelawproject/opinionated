The declaration contained 1 <em>J </em>I <em>two </em>counts, on two notes; the one dated the 3d of March, 1808, payable sixty days after date, without defalcation or discount, at, &amp;c. and endorsed the same day by the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"400\">*400</page-number>payee to the plaintiff. The other was on a like note, payable in 30 days. The declaration was of <em>August </em>term, 1808, and averred, that the notes having become payable, &amp;c. the plaintiff presented the same, &amp;c. to the defendant, and requested payment, &amp;c. and that the defendant did not then, nor at any time since, pay the said sum of money in the said notes mentioned, to the plaintiff, but then and there wholly refused, &amp;c. And though often requested, &amp;c. hath not paid the said sums of money in the said notes, &amp;c.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b412-6\">The defendant pleaded, in <em>August </em>term, the general issue, with notice. \u2019 ' \u2022</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b412-7\">The defendant afterwards put in a <em>plea puis darrein </em>continuance, in <em>November </em>term, which stated, that since the last continuance, and before the second <em>Monday </em>of November, to wit, on- the 25th of September, 1808, at, &amp;c. \u201c he paid to the said <em>Claiborne Chew </em>the said several sums of money mentioned in the declaration of the said <em>C. </em>Chew, and this he is ready to verify,\u201d &amp;c. To this plea there was a general demurrer, and joinder.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b412-10\">Mulligan, in support of the demurrer.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AYB\">Payment cannot be pleaded <em>puis darrein </em>continuance, without it is also stated to have been accepted in <em>satisfaction; </em>more-especially where it is on a promise or contract bearing interest. The action of <em>assumpsit </em>is for damages, and the plea should go in discharge of the damages.<footnotemark>*</footnotemark> The sum paid, in the present case, being less than what the plaintiff was entitled to recover, it must be shown that it was accepted in satisfaction.</p>\n<p data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b412-11\">A plea of <em>puis darrein continuance </em>confesses the cause of action,<footnotemark>\u2020</footnotemark> and it ought to be in discharge of the whole.</p>\n<p data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b412-12\">In the case of <em>Johnston </em>v. Brannan,<footnotemark>\u2021</footnotemark> the court recognise the general rule, that a plea of payment of a less sum, after the debt is due, is not good, unless it is stated to have been accepted in satisfaction. Where the, plains tiff has a vested right of action, it cannot be devested <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"401\">*401</page-number>by the act of the defendant alone. As to precedents, they may be found in <em>Lilly's Entries, </em>121.128. 393.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b413-4\"><em>Baldwin </em>and Hoffman, contra.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"A4r\">Where the party accepts the principal of his debt, he cannot, afterwards, sue for the interest.<footnotemark>*</footnotemark> There was, then, a complete discharge of the right of action. The plea states that the defendant paid the several sums mentioned in the plaintiff\u2019s declaration. That the plaintiff accepted the money in satisfaction is a necessary inference from the fact of a payment of the principal. Interest is an accessary, and follows the principal. Whatever would be a good defence before action, may be pleaded <em>puis darrein continuance.</em><footnotemark><em>\u2020</em></footnotemark><em> </em>There are numerous precedents of pleas in the form of the present. 2 <em>Rich.

The action is for damages which are and must be uncertain. In an action of debt, the plaintiff also claims damages for the detention, which are unliquidated. The defendant cannot himself liquidate and fix the damages, merely by payment of the debt Or principal: they must be assessed by a jury, or fixed by consent of parties. Damages are accruing from the time of the breach of the promise, and a tender of the principal, afterwards, is not good.</p>\n<p data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b413-6\">The conclusion in the declaration is for a larger suiu in damages. The plea should, therefore, state that the ' sum paid was accepted in satisfaction of the damages, so as to be a full answer to the declaration.</p>\n<footnote data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"footnote\" id=\"x999-1\" label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b412-8\"> 1 Ld. <em>Raym. </em>234. 2 Salk.622, 623. 4 <em>Mod. </em>250.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"footnote\" id=\"x999-2\" label=\"\u2020\">\n<p id=\"b412-9\"> 1 <em>Salk. 178. 2 .Stra. </em>1105.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"footnote\" id=\"x999-3\" label=\"\u2021\">\n<p id=\"Az9\"> 5 <em>Johns.

It must be taken to embrac\u00e9- the whole sum due on each note, which will of course include the interest ; and it was therefore not requisite to aver in the plea, that the sum was accepted in satisfaction. That would be turning a plea pf payment into a plea of accord and satisfaction. The allegation of payment of the demand implies the acceptance of the money by the plaintiff; and if the fact of payment had been traversed, and it had appeared in proof that the interest legally due on the notes had not been paid, the plea would have failed for want of proof; and if the fact was, that the plaintiff had thrown in the interest, then the plea ought to have stated that the sum paid was accepted in full satisfaction and discharge, as was done in the case of <em>Johnston </em>v. <em>Brannan, </em>(5 <em>Johns. Rep. </em>268.) The good sense and mean-, ing of the plea, as it stands, is, that the defendant had paid the amount of the,notes, and if they were notes carrying interest, that he paid the interest also.</p>\n<p id=\"b414-7\">Judgment for the defendant.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
