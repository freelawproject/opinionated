Stoddard, </em>jun. was arrested on a <em>cap. ad. resp. </em>and the other' defendant returned not found. The defendant pleaded <em>nil debet, </em>with notice that he should give in evidence, at the trial, that he was an infant at the time the note was made, on which the judgment was obtained.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b219-13\">The cause was tried at the <em>Abany </em>circuit, <em>April, </em>1810, before Mr. Justice <em>Thompson.</em></summary>\n<summary data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b219-14\">By the record of the judgment, produced at the trial, it appeared, that it was rendered the 24th <em>February, </em>1806, for 183 dollars damages, and 36 dollars and 60 cents costs; that the action was on a note made by the defendant the 21st <em>April, </em>1803, for 200 dollars, payable in two years; that the defendant pleaded the general issue, and gave notice that he should give in evidence the infancy of <em>R. Stoddard, </em>jun.; and the jury found a verdict for the plaintiff.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b219-15\">It was proved, that on the 30th <em>January, </em>1806, a person, as agent of the elder <em>Stoddard, </em>went to <em>Vermont </em>to settle with the plaintiff, the suit having been, commenced <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"208\">*208</page-number>there by an attachment of the property of the elder <em>Stoddard. </em>A settlement was accordingly made, and 10\u00ae dollars were paid, on which the plaintiff gave a receipt in full of all demands against the elder <em>Stoddard. </em>It was agreed, at the time, that the plaintiff might proceed in his suit, for the purpose of having the property attached sold, and that no defence was to be made to the suit.' <em>Stoddard, </em>jun. being present, it was questioned whether he was of age when he gave the note ; and he then, being of full age, agreed to pay 100 dollars, being the half of the rent of a farm, for which the note was given. It was proved that 30 acres of wheat had been attached ; and that in October, 1809, the plaintiff admitted he had received wheat enough to pay the rent due j the wheat belonged to <em>Stoddard, </em>jun. who promised to pay his part of the note.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b220-6\">An execution issued on the judgment was pro\" duced, by which it appeared, that 136 dollars and <em>60 </em>cents was endorsed, in part satisfaction, being the amount of the appraisement of the wheat in <em>May.</em></summary>\n<summary data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b220-7\">Under the charge of the judge, the jury found a verdict for the plaintiff.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b220-8\">A motion was made to set aside the verdict, and for a new trial, on the following grounds :</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b220-9\">1. That the discharge of one defendant was the discharge of both.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b220-10\">2. That the defendant, <em>Stoddard, </em>jun. was an infant when he made the note, on which the judgment was rendered in <em>Vermont.</em></summary>\n<summary data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b220-11\">3. That <em>Stoddard </em>the elder not being in <em>Vermont </em>when the suit was commenced, nor served with process, the judgment could not be enforced here.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b220-12\"><em>4. </em>That the verdict was against evidence.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b220-13\"><em>H.

By the discharge, therefore, of one, his action is lost.</p>\n<p data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b221-7\">e 2. The defendant, <em>Stoddard </em>the younger, was an infant when he made the note. To take away this legal objection, the new promise after he came of age must be the same as the original promise, and a confirmation of it; but here the new promise was to pay half the rent, not to pay the note. A promise to pay 100 dollars rent, is not a promise to pay a note for 200 dollars.</p>\n<p data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b221-10\">3. The elder <em>Stoddard </em>was in this state, and was never served with <em>process; </em>the suit was commenced by the attachment of property, without any personal summons or actual notice. No action, therefore, can be maintained in this state on the judgment recovered in <em>Vermont.</em><footnotemark><em>\u2021</em></footnotemark></p>\n<p data-order=\"21\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AIjZ\">, . . , . , , , 4. 1 here was evidence that the plaintiff\u2019s demand had been fully satisfied.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"22\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b221-14\">Rodman, contra.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"23\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AYF\">1. The receipt given to the elder <em>Stoddard </em>v/as to operate as a discharge under certain circumstances only. It was conditional, provided the suit proceeded, and no defence was made, so that the wheat might be sold under the judgment. These terms were not fulfilled; for a defence was made to the suit.</p>\n<p data-order=\"24\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b221-15\">2. As to the plea of infancy; one of the witnesses testified that the defendant promised after he was of age to pay his half of the note; and this promise was made for the express purpose of removing any doubts as to his liability.</p>\n<p data-order=\"25\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b221-16\">3. It appears from .the record, that both parties appeared to the suit, and it was defended. An appearance waives all objection of a want of notice or summons.</p>\n<footnote data-order=\"26\" data-type=\"footnote\" id=\"x999-1\" label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"A3lZ\"> 2 Salk. 574. <em>Co.

It is a well settled rule, that a <em>release </em>to one of several <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"210\">*210</page-number>obligors, whether they are bound jointly, or jointly and severally, discharges the others, and may be pleaded in <em>bar. </em>(Co. Litt. 232. a. and note 144. 2 <em>Saund. </em>48. a. But where two are bound jointly and severally, and the obligee covenants with one of the obligors only, not to sue him, it does not amount to a release, but is a covenant only, and the obligee may still sue the other obligor. (8 <em>Term Rep. 171.) </em>The settlement made in the case before us, is somewhat in the nature of an agreement <em>lease under seal </em>is necessary to be given to one of several debtors, in order that the others may avail themselves of it as a discharge. In the case of <em>Fitch </em>v. Sutton, (5 East, 232.) Lord <em>Ellenborough </em>says, it cannot be pretended that a receipt for part only, though expressed to be in full of. all demands, must have the same operation as a release. The same doctrine is fully recognised by this court, in the case of <em>Harrison </em>v. <em>Close and </em>Wilcox, (2 <em>Johns. Rep. </em>449.) in which it appeared, that the defendants having given the plaintiff a joint and several promissory note for <em>71 </em>dollars, the plaintiff agreed with one of them, if he would pay him 21 dollars and <em>55 </em>cents, he would not call on him for payment of the note, but would look to the other defendant for the residue. , The 21 dollars and <em>55 </em>cents were paid, but this was held not to be a satisfaction of the note, nor a bar to the plain-1 tiff\u2019s action. These authorities - are sufficient to show that, the receipt given by the plaintiff forms no objection, to the present action. not to prosecute the elder <em>Stoddard./ </em>But a technical re-</p>\n<p id=\"b222-13\">The appearance of the elder <em>Stoddard </em>to the suit' commenced against him in Vermont, cured\" all irregularity, if any had been committed, in the commencement of the suit, on account of his not being within the state. The other questions, suggested on the argument, were matters of fact submitted to the jury. The promise of the younger Stoddard, after he came of age, was sufficient to remove every objection on the ground of in<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"211\">*211</page-number>fancy, if that promise applied to the note, which in the opinion of the jury it did. And to what amount payments had been made, was to be determined between the evidence of Stewart, on the part of the defendant, and the testimony furnished by the appraisement of the wheat attached in <em>Vermont. </em>The jury, by their vejdict, have adopted the latter, which was perhaps the most correct <em>; </em>at all events, it was a proper subject for their determination.</p>\n<p id=\"b223-7\">The motion for a new trial must, therefore, be denied,,</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
