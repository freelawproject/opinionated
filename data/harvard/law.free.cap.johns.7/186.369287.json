The suit was commenced against <em>Herman Vosburgh, </em>and <em>John A. </em>Vosburgh, and the latter died since the commencement of the suit, leaving children.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b198-16\">The defendant then offered to prove, that he ha&lt;|. been in the actual possession of the premises in his own right for more than 30 years before the commencement of this suit, and that since the letting of the premises mentioned by the plaintiff\u2019s witnesses, <em>Van Alen </em>and <em>Van Vleeck, </em>two of the lessors, had disclaimed any right to the premises; but such disclaimer was not in writing, nor made to, or in the presence of the defendant.

A tenancy created by <em>parol </em>may be discharged by <em>parol; </em>and it ought to have been left to the jury as a matter of fact. The evidence offered by the defendant was not to show an outstanding title, but to repel the evidence of tenancy given by the plaintiff. Tenancy or not, is a matter of fact.</p>\n<p data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b199-6\">Another question is as to the extent of the recovery in this case.

Here the lessors had proved a title, and also a tenancy; and the defendant then offered to show a title out of the lessors; but having once acknowledged a tenancy, or the right of the landlord, he never can be allowed to set up any other title.<footnotemark>\u2021</footnotemark> <em>Parol </em>evidence of possession is not sufficient to rebut the evidence of tenancy, unless accompanied with some <em>paper </em>title, to give- colour to the right of possession.</p>\n<footnote data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"footnote\" id=\"x999-1\" label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"A_G\"> <em>Far </em>v. <em>Denn, </em>1 <em>Burr. </em>362.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"footnote\" id=\"x999-2\" label=\"\u2020\">\n<p id=\"AHq\"> 6 <em>Johns.

He died about the year 1777, and devised his real estate to his son <em>Cornelius Vosburgh. </em>He succeeded to the possession of the premises, and in 1789 sold them by deed to <em>-John L. Van </em>Alen, jun. He took possession, and used the premises for years, and then <em>Isaac I. Van Vleeck </em>took possession, and was in possession to 1799. These two last possessors are lessors of the plaintiff. In addition to this strong proof of title, it was shown, that in 1799 the defendant said he had taken the premises'of <em>Van </em>Vleeck, one of the plaintiffs, for one <em>year; </em>and that at another time he offered to give up the possession to <em>Van </em>Alen, another plaintiff, in the same way he had it \u00f3f <em>Van </em>Vleeck, but that at another time he refused, and denied the right of <em>Van Alert.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b200-7\">To meet this testimony, the defendant offered to show that the two lessors, <em>Van Alen </em>and <em>Van </em>Vleeck, had disclaimed any right to the <em>premises; </em>but this disclaimer was not in writing, nor made to or in the pre.senee of the <em>defendant; </em>and he offered further to prove, that he had been in the actual possession of the premises in his own right for more than 30 years before the bringing of the suit. This testimony was overruled. Such a disclaimer \"as was here set up could be of no validity 5 and such evidence, if admissible, would lead to fraud and perjury, and be destructive of title to property. (6 <em>Johns. Rep. </em>21.) The other evidence, which was overruled, went to deny and destroy the landlord\u2019s right,' which a tenant, assuming him to be a tenant, is not permitted to do; (3 <em>Johns. Rep. </em>504.) but it also went to disprove the fact of any <em>tenancy; </em>and in that view it ought to have been received, and it might have been material. On this single-point, then, the motion to set aside the verdict is granted, with costs 'to abide the event of the suit.</p>\n<p id=\"b200-8\">Rule granted.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
