In <em>Packman's </em>case,<footnotemark>*</footnotemark> it was held, that a gift made by covin, though void under the statute of 13 <em>Eliz. </em>c. 5. as against a creditor, remained good against the donor, or his administrator. The same point was decided in <em>Hawes </em>v. Leader,<footnotemark>\u2020</footnotemark> which is a case precisely analogous. But a creditor has no right to take the property, without any suit; and the defendant being a creditor as well as administrator, can make no difference. The chattels were not <em>assets </em>in the hands of the administrator, for the property was not sold before the administration was granted. They could be <em>assets </em>only in the hands of the plaintiff, as <em>executor de son </em>tort. The proper remedy for the defendant as creditor, or administrator, is by an action against the plaintiff as an executor <em>de son tort. </em><footnotemark>\u2021</footnotemark></p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b175-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"163\">*163</page-number><em>Skinner, </em>contra.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"A6-\">The judgment being void as fraudulent, the property became <em>assets </em>in the hands of the adininistrator. In <em>Belthel </em>v. <em>Stanhope,</em><footnotemark><em>*</em></footnotemark><em> </em>it was decided, that where a person makes a fraudulent gift of goods, and dies indebted, the gift is utterly void against ereditors, and the goods are <em>assets </em>in the hands'of the administrator. The case of <em>Waring </em>v. <em>Dewberry</em><footnotemark><em>\u2020</em></footnotemark><em> </em>shows that the rights of the administrator relate back to the death of the intestate. It can make no difference, therefore, that the property was sold after the death of the intestate, but before any administration was granted. The material inquiry is, in whom was the property when the intestate died. If, as I contend, it was in the intestate, it belonged to the administrator, who might bring <em>trespass </em>or <em>trover </em>for it. If the creditors have a right to this property, why may not the administrator recover it for them ? A creditor might inform him of the fact of its having been fraudulently conveyed, and request him to insert it in the inventory. In <em>Cadogan </em>v. <em>Kennett,</em><footnotemark><em>\u2021</em></footnotemark><em> </em>Lord <em>Mansfield </em>said that the statutes of the 13 and 27 <em>Eliz. </em>could not receive too liberal a construction, or be too much extended in suppression of fraud. The first statute was made for the protection of creditors; and any transaction, if done for the purpose of defeating creditors, though there may be a fair and full price paid, is fraudulent and void.</p>\n<footnote data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"footnote\" id=\"x999-1\" label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b174-5\"> C <em>Co.

But the case of <em>Hawes v. Leader </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"164\">*164</page-number><em>(Cro. Jac. </em>270. <em>Yelv. </em>196.) is an answer to this defence, , ,,, _ , , . and completely destroys it. In that case the intestate made a grant of his goods to <em>B. </em>by fraud between him and <em>B. </em>to cheat the creditors, and he kept possession of the goods, and died. <em>B. </em>then sued the administrator for the goods, and he pleaded this covin and fraud and the statute of 13 <em>Eliz. </em>which declares all such gifts and grants void as against creditors ; but, on demurrer, the plea was held bad, and judgment was rendered for the plaintiff, on the ground, among others, that the deed was void only as against creditors, but that it remained good as against the party himself, and his executors and administrators. This ground of the decision is mentioned by <em>Yelverton, </em>in his report of the case, with <em>quod nota; </em>and he was counsel for defendant, and his reports are among the best of the old authorities.</p>\n<p id=\"b176-9\">The defendant further sets up in his defence, that he was a creditor, as well as administrator of the intestate. This was not stated in his plea, but in his <em>rejoinder; </em>and it is stated rather as inducement than as matter of justification. It does not, however, alter the case. As creditor, he had no right to take the goods without suit. He was still a <em>trespasser; </em>and in his character of administrator he could not attack the judgment on the ground of fraud. His remedy, as creditor, would have been to have sued the plaintiff for his debt, and charged him as executor <em>de son tort. </em>This he could have done, notwithstanding he was <em>administrator; </em>and the case of <em>Ashby </em>v. <em>Child </em>(Styles, 384.) is expressly to this point. The plaintiff is therefore entitled to judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b176-10\">Judgment for the plaintiff.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
