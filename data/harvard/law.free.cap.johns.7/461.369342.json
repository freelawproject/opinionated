Nor was any request requisite to be specially averred and proved, for a request was not parcel of the contract. The contract is sufficiently set forth, and was a valid one. Any defect or inaccuracy in assigning the breach is aided after verdict, for the court will intend that damages could not\" have been given, if a good breach had not been shown.
