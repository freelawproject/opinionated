On the 1st of <em>January, </em>1807, she was stranded, in a <em>gale </em>of wind, on <em>Barnegat Shoals, </em>near <em>Sandy-I~Iook, </em>and on that day and during the four following days, the cargo was unladen and stored at Barnegat, except the iron and two casks, and a box containing looking glasses, &amp;c. which were put on board a sloop to be brought back to <em>New-Tork; </em>the schooner was afterwards wrecked and lost. Part of the cargo, consisting of beef, butter, candles, soap, apples, and potatoes, was sold at Barnegat, at public auction, on the 13th of February, 1807, and the residue of the beef, butter, potatoes, apples, &amp;c. was lost or stolen.</p>\n<p data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b540-7\">The sloop on board of which the two casks and boxes of hardware were put, was frozen up at Barnegat, and lay there until <em>April, </em>when she came up to New-Tork.

That the clause was expressly introduced for the purpose of guarding against all liability for a <em>technical </em>total loss, or particular average on the articles insured. It was neither a physical total loss9 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"529\">*529</page-number>or absolute destruction of the whole subject, nor a general average.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b541-4\"><em>Woods </em>and Hopkins, contra,</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"Ahv\">insisted, that by the enumeration in the margin of the policy, it was intended that the insurers should be liable for each article lost! and whether this loss was occasioned by sinking, or by theft, or in any other way, it could make no difference.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b541-5\">\n<em>Per Curiam.</em>\n</author>\n<p id=\"A4q\">The defendants are entitled to judgment. There was neither a case of general average, nor an absolute destruction of the property, and in no other event were the defendants to be responsible. The idea that for each <em>item </em>or article of the cargo which was totally lost, the defendants are liable, is not well founded. The insurance was upon so much cargo as an integral subject. In the <em>French </em>policies at <em>Marseilles </em>certain perishable articles are declared free of average, general and particular, which means that the underwriter is answerable only for an entire loss of the subject insured. And, therefore, where part of a cargo of wheat has been thrown overboard, in a case of extremity, the insurer has repeatedly been held not to be responsible.
