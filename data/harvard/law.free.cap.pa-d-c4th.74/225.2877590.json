This trial judge disagrees.</p>\n<p id=\"b240-7\">RELEVANT FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL HISTORY</p>\n<p id=\"b240-8\">Plaintiff\u2019s civil action complaint for personal injuries against Lisa M. Milillo (defendant), Ron Louden and Ron Alan Louden (same person, defendant Louden), and Valerie Elaine Monroe for negligent entrustment of a motor vehicle.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> On January 20, 2005, a default judgment was entered against defendant Monroe as a result of her failure to file an answer to the complaint. Discovery ensued and was completed. On March 2,2005, a jury trial commenced against the remaining defendants. Briefly, the relevant evidence the jury considered is as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b241-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"227\">*227</page-number>\u201cOn January 8, 2002,[<footnotemark>2</footnotemark>] plaintiff was a 29-year-old female[<footnotemark>3</footnotemark>] employed as a supervisor in the digitizing department at Main Line Embroidery,[<footnotemark>4</footnotemark>] an entity she had worked with for 14 years.[<footnotemark>5</footnotemark>] On that date, she received a phone call at her place of employment from the police notifying her that the alarm system at her mother\u2019s house had been triggered.[<footnotemark>6</footnotemark>] Plaintiff asked a co-worker, defendant Monroe, to drive her from their Essington, Pennsylvania,[<footnotemark>7</footnotemark>] work location to check on her mother\u2019s home located in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania.[<footnotemark>8</footnotemark>] Defendant Monroe agreed and they were headed in a southward direction on 4th Street[<footnotemark>9</footnotemark>] in Tinicum Township,[<footnotemark>10</footnotemark>] with plaintiff as an unrestrained[<footnotemark>11</footnotemark>] front seat passenger,[<footnotemark>12</footnotemark>] when the motor vehicle accident occurred.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b241-5\">\u201cDefendant Louden was driving a vehicle he and his wife, defendant Milillo, owned, on his way to a truck driving school located in Lester, Pennsylvania.[<footnotemark>13</footnotemark>] Moments prior to the motor vehicle accident, defendant Louden came to a rolling stop[<footnotemark>14</footnotemark>] before making a left hand turn onto Seminole Street, the cross street to 4th Street[<footnotemark>15</footnotemark>] (which does not have any stop signs for vehicles <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"228\">*228</page-number>going north and south).[<footnotemark>16</footnotemark>] As he entered 4th Street, defendant Louden\u2019s vehicle was traveling at approximately 10 miles per hour,[<footnotemark>17</footnotemark>] while defendant Monroe\u2019s approaching vehicle was traveling at a speed between 25 and 45 miles per hour. [<footnotemark>18</footnotemark>] Defendant Louden had almost completed the turn onto 4th Street when the accident occurred. The collision impact was to the front passenger side of defendant Monroe\u2019s Mazda 626[<footnotemark>19</footnotemark>] causing the airbags to deploy,[<footnotemark>20</footnotemark>] and to the right rear quarter panel of defendant Louden\u2019s Suzuki Side Kick.[<footnotemark>21</footnotemark>] The force of the collision broke the axle of defendant Louden\u2019s vehicle, making it inoperable.[<footnotemark>22</footnotemark>]</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b242-5\">\u201cAlthough an ambulance arrived at the scene of the accident, plaintiff refused immediate medical care.[<footnotemark>23</footnotemark>] Later that evening, she went to the emergency room at Thomas Jefferson University Hospital where her entire body was x-rayed and she was later discharged.[<footnotemark>24</footnotemark>]</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b242-6\">\u201cApproximately two weeks after the accident,[<footnotemark>25</footnotemark>] plaintiff sought the services of a chiropractor. She underwent <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"229\">*229</page-number>a MRI,[<footnotemark>26</footnotemark>] which was positive for a herniated disk or protrusion.[<footnotemark>27</footnotemark>] Plaintiff received treatment from the chiropractor until her medical benefits were exhausted, then ceased treatment because she could not financially afford the therapy.[<footnotemark>28</footnotemark>] She was advised by her chiropractor to take up Pilates, but failed to do so.[<footnotemark>29</footnotemark>] Approximately two to three months after the accident,[<footnotemark>30</footnotemark>] her neck pains subsided, but her back pain allegedly did not.[<footnotemark>31</footnotemark>] She used Aspercream on her back and took non-prescription pain medication.[<footnotemark>32</footnotemark>]</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b243-5\">\u201cBefore the accident, plaintiff claims that she did not suffer from any type of neck or back pain.[<footnotemark>33</footnotemark>] She was able to exercise, run, and do sit-ups, household chores and other physical activities without any pain.[<footnotemark>34</footnotemark>] Plaintiff claims, however, that since the accident, she continues to suffer from constant back pain;[<footnotemark>35</footnotemark>] that she cannot sit or stand for extended periods of time;[<footnotemark>36</footnotemark>] and that her ability to engage in physical activities has diminished.[<footnotemark>37</footnotemark>] Other than the chiropractic treatments, plaintiff did not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"230\">*230</page-number>seek any medical treatment for her accident-related injuries.[<footnotemark>38</footnotemark>]</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b244-5\">\u201cAs a result of the motor vehicle accident, plaintiff did not miss any work nor did her job responsibilities require any accommodations for her injuries.[<footnotemark>39</footnotemark>] Plaintiff did not suffer any lost wages.[<footnotemark>40</footnotemark>] She has since married, had a child, and now manages a moving company with her husband.[<footnotemark>41</footnotemark>] Her current responsibilities consist of secretarial and administrative duties.\u201d[<footnotemark>42</footnotemark>]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b244-6\">On March 8,2005, the jury rendered a verdict finding that defendant Louden was negligent but that his negligence was not a factual cause in bringing about plaintiff\u2019s injuries. The jury also found that plaintiff did not sustain a \u201cserious injury.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b244-7\">On March 14, 2005, plaintiff filed a post-trial motion requesting a new trial. Oral argument was scheduled and heard on April 26 and April 27, 2005. By order dated April 27, 2005, this trial judge denied plaintiff\u2019s post-trial motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b244-8\">Dissatisfied, on May 4, 2005, plaintiff filed the instant appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b244-9\">ISSUE</p>\n<p id=\"b244-10\">In response to an order issued in accordance with Pennsylvania Rule of Appellate Procedure 1925(b), plaintiff, on June 3, 2005, served unto this trial judge a concise statement of matters complained of on appeal and ar<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"231\">*231</page-number>gued that: \u201cthis honorable court committed an error of law and/or abuse of discretion in ruling that plaintiffs [sic] case was governed by \u2018limited tort.\u2019 Plaintiff\u2019s counsel preserved this issue by objecting to the court\u2019s ruling prior to the selection of the jury. Plaintiff also preserved this issue by objecting on the record outside the presence of the jury during the charging conference to a limited tort charge, and plaintiff again preserved this objection on the record at the sidebar conference immediately after the courts [sic] charge to the jury.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b245-3\">LAW AND DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b245-4\">For the reasons that follow, this trial judge opines that the denial of plaintiff\u2019s post-trial motion was proper and that this appeal is without merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b245-5\">At the outset, it is important to mention that, although the jury found defendant Louden negligent, they also found that defendant Louden\u2019s negligence was not a factual cause in bringing about plaintiff\u2019s injuries, and that plaintiff did not suffer a \u201cserious injury.\u201d Because this trial judge determined that the \u201climited tort\u201d option of the MVFRL applied, the jury did not consider what damages, if any, plaintiff suffered. This judicial determination is the basis of plaintiff\u2019s appeal and request for a new trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b245-6\">It is undisputed that the decision to grant and/or deny a request for a new trial lies within the sound discretion of the trial court. <em>Andrews </em>v. <em>Jackson, </em>800 A.2d 959, 962 (Pa. Super. 2002), <em>appeal denied, </em>572 Pa. 694, 813 A.2d 835 (2002). An appellate court may not disturb a trial court\u2019s ruling unless the trial court palpably abused its discretion and/or committed an error of law. <em>Neison </em>v. <em>Hines, </em>539 Pa. 516, 521, 653 A.2d 634, 636 (1995); <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"232\">*232</page-number><em>Andrews, </em>800 A.2d at 961. An abuse of discretion is not merely an error of judgment. If, in reaching a conclusion, the law is overridden or misapplied, or the judgment exercised is manifestly unreasonable, or the result of partiality, prejudice, bias, or ill will, as shown by the evidence of record, discretion is abused. See <em>Fanning </em>v. <em>Davne, </em>795 A.2d 388, 393 (Pa. Super. 2002), <em>citing Paden v. Baker Concrete Construction Co. Inc., </em>540 Pa. 409, 412, 658 A.2d 341, 343 (1995). However, an abuse of discretion may not be found merely because the appellate court might have reached a different conclusion. The court\u2019s action requires a showing of manifest unreasonableness, or partiality, prejudice, bias, or ill will, or such lack of support as to be clearly erroneous. <em>Fanning, </em>795 A.2d at 393.</p>\n<p id=\"b246-3\">A new trial is warranted where the jury\u2019s verdict is so contrary to the evidence as to shock one\u2019s sense of justice. <em>Neison, </em>539 Pa. at 521, 653 A.2d at 636. However, a new trial should not be granted because of a mere conflict in testimony or some irregularity which occurred during trial or because the trial judge, on the same facts, would have arrived at a different conclusion. <em>Harman ex rel. Harman </em>v. <em>Borah, </em>562 Pa. 455, 468, 756 A.2d 1116, 1122 (2000), <em>appeal denied, </em>567 Pa. 762,790 A.2d 1017 (2001). The moving party must demonstrate to the trial court that he or she has suffered prejudice from the mistake. <em>Id. </em>at 468, 756 A.2d at 1122.</p>\n<p id=\"b246-4\">Here, the pertinent statute is the Motor Vehicle Code. Generally, under the provisions of this code, insurance companies must present their insureds with an opportunity to choose between the \u201cfull tort\u201d option and the \u201climited tort\u201d option. 75 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 1705(a)(1). For a higher yearly premium, the \u201cfull tort\u201d option allows individu<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"233\">*233</page-number>als an opportunity to seek financial compensation for all medical and out-of-pocket expenses, as well as noneconomic loss, which is defined as pain and suffering and other non-monetary damages suffered as a result of a motor vehicle accident. 75 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 1705(a) (1)(B) (2004); 75 Pa.C.S. \u00a71702(2)(ii) (2004).</p>\n<p id=\"b247-5\">In contrast, the \u201climited tort\u201d option restricts damage recovery to only medical and out-of-pocket expenses unless the injuries fall within the \u201cserious injury\u201d definition. 75 Pa.C.S. \u00a71705(a)(1)(A) (2004). An insured who affirmatively chooses the \u201climited tort\u201d option and who has not sustained a \u201cserious injury\u201d is precluded from recovering noneconomic damages. <em>Berger </em>v. <em>Rinaldi, </em>438 Pa. Super. 78, 84,651 A.2d 553, 556 (1994), <em>appeal denied, </em>544 Pa. 641, 664 A.2d 971 (1995).</p>\n<p id=\"b247-6\">A <em>serious injury </em>is defined as \u201ca personal injury resulting in death, serious impairment of body function, or permanent serious disfigurement.\u201d See 75 Pa.C.S. \u00a71702. To meet a \u201cserious impairment of body function\u201d threshold requires answering two inquiries: (a) what body function, if any, was impaired because of the injuries sustained in a motor vehicle accident and (b) was the impairment of the body function serious? <em>Washington </em>v. <em>Baxter, </em>553 Pa. 434, 447, 719 A.2d 733, 740 (1998). These inquiries are not on the injuries themselves, but rather, on the effect the injuries had on a particular body function. <em>Id. </em>Factors that should be taken into consideration when determining whether an injury is serious include the extent of the impairment, the length of time the impairment lasted, the treatment required to correct the impairment, and any other relevant factors. <em>Id. </em>Except in the clearest of cases, the determination of whether \u201cserious injury\u201d exists should be made by the jury. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b248-2\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"234\">*234</page-number>Here, prior to the commencement of the jury trial, this trial judge heard argument on whether this matter was governed by the provisions of full tort or limited tort. Plaintiff argued that this case should not be governed by \u201climited tort\u201d provisions of the MVFRL because the declaration page of her Farmers New Century Insurance Contract dated December 10,2001, indicated in the \u201cCoverages\u201d section that the coverage was for a \u201cfull tort\u201d plan, that she had not signed any waiver form, and that the total amount of the annual premium paid supported her contention that she had selected the \u201cfull tort\u201d option. Defendants\u2019 counsel, however, provided this trial judge with a waiver form dated April 19, 2001, signed by plaintiff\u2019s mother. In response, plaintiff argued that the waiver form that her mother signed which selected the \u201climited tort\u201d insurance option was done without her knowledge for a totally different insurance policy, as evidenced by the different policy numbers. In their response, defendants argued that the different numbers were due to a clerical error and that plaintiff had previously admitted at a trial deposition that she and her mother owned only one insurance policy, which is the one that contained the signed waiver and the sign-down form indicating the limited tort selection.</p>\n<p id=\"b248-3\">This trial judge is aware that section 1705(a)(2) of the Motor Vehicle Code provides: \u201cWhere there are two or more named insureds on a policy, any named insured may make the full or limited tort election provided for in this section for all named insureds on the policy.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b248-4\">In addition to considering the arguments made, this trial judge carefully reviewed the waiver page and the amount of the annual premiums due, depending on the selection of either the full tort option or limited tort option. From these documents, it appeared that the basic <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"235\">*235</page-number>annual premium paid for the coverage selected was consistent with the premiums due for the \u201climited tort\u201d coverage, discounted. The amount plaintiff or her mother paid for the insurance premiums did not surpass the amount due for limited tort coverage, and was not near the amount due for full tort coverage. Despite plaintiff\u2019s professed lack of knowledge that her mother signed the waiver form for the policy, this trial judge is convinced that a valid waiver had been signed by plaintiff\u2019s mother and, consequently, that the \u201climited tort\u201d option provisions of the MVFRL govern the instant case. The \u201climited tort\u201d option chosen by plaintiff\u2019s mother binds any and all insureds on that policy, including plaintiff. This trial judge was not persuaded by plaintiff\u2019s argument that a valid waiver did not exist or that the waiver form was for a different insurance policy. Her argument, at times contradictory and inaccurate, was not convincing. In this trial judge\u2019s opinion, plaintiff has failed to support her appellate claim that an error of law and/or an abuse of discretion occurred when this trial judge determined that the \u201climited tort\u201d provisions applied in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b249-5\">CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b249-6\">Based on the foregoing discussion, statutes, rules, and case law, this trial judge is of the opinion that no error of law and/or abuse of discretion occurred in ruling that plaintiff\u2019s case was governed by \u201climited tort\u201d provisions of the Motor Vehicle Code and/or in denying plaintiff\u2019s post-trial motion for a new trial. This trial judge respectfully requests that plaintiff\u2019s appeal be dismissed and that the order dated April 29,2005, be affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b240-9\">.
