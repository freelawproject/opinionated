Presently before the court are: (1) plaintiffs\u2019 motion for partial summary judgment regarding the duty to defend, (2) defendant One Beacon\u2019s motion for partial summary judgment on the issue of control and scope of defense and (3) defendant Century\u2019s motion for partial summary judgment on the issue of control and coverage under a Century policy issued to D.M. International Inc.</p>\n<p id=\"b48-4\">BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b48-5\">In early 2001, Kvaerner began to be subjected to a substantial number of liability claims by persons alleging asbestos-related bodily injury resulting from claimed exposure to asbestos while working at sites where Kvaerner\u2019s predecessors allegedly performed construction or other activities. As of March 1, 2005 approximately 5,993 claims had been filed in nine states, including Pennsylvania, and approximately 3,429 claims remain active and open. New asbestos claims continue to be filed against Kvaerner at a rate of approximately 100 per month.</p>\n<p id=\"b48-6\">One Beacon\u2019s predecessor, General Accident Fire &amp; Life Assurance Corporation Ltd. issued Comprehensive <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"35\">*35</page-number>General Liability (CGL) ins\u00farance policies to Kvaerner predecessors for the 18-year period from 1964 to 1982. There are six polices in all.</p>\n<p id=\"b49-5\">Century\u2019s predecessor, the Insurance Company of North America, issued three general liability policies to Davy Inc. and one general liability policy to an entity known as D.M. International Inc., providing coverage for the four-year period from April 1,1982 through April 1, 1986.</p>\n<p id=\"b49-6\">Upon receipt of the bodily injury claims, Kvaerner requested that defendants provide a defense. As of this date, although defendants have paid Kvaerner\u2019s past defense costs incurred with respect to some claims through a certain date in 2004, defendants have not assumed the duty to defend. Presently, Kvaerner is being represented by house counsel and various law firms across the country.</p>\n<p id=\"b49-7\">Kvaerner now moves for partial summary judgment in the form of a declaration that, at least with respect to certain categories of asbestos claims, defendant insurers are obligated under their polices to defend it against the claims and/or to pay the defense costs. Defendants do not oppose the essential requests in Kvaerner\u2019s motion; however, defendants submit that additional issues should be determined by the court, specifically the scope and control of the defense. The parties submitted proposed form orders with their respective motions. At oral argument, the parties agreed to certain language which has been incorporated within the order to be issued contemporaneously with this opinion, obviating the need for discussion here. This opinion will discuss the remaining <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"36\">*36</page-number>issues: (1) scope of defense, (2) control over the litigation and (3) coverage under the Century policy.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b50-5\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b50-6\">A. <em>Standard of Review</em></p>\n<p id=\"b50-7\">Summary judgment may only be granted in cases where it is clear and free from doubt that the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law. <em>Davis v. Resources for Human Development Inc., </em>770 A.2d 353 (Pa. Super. 2001). If there are no material issues of fact in dispute or if the non-moving party has failed to state a prima facie case, summary judgment may be granted. <em>Dudley v. USX Corp., </em>414 Pa. Super. 160, 606 A.2d 916 (1992). Thus, a proper grant of summary judgment depends upon an evidentiary record that either (1) shows the material facts are undisputed or (2) contains insufficient evidence of facts to make out a prima facie cause of action or defense. <em>Rauch </em>v. <em>Mike-Mayer, </em>783 A.2d 815 (Pa. Super. 2001).</p>\n<p id=\"b50-8\">The trial court must confine its inquiry when confronted with a motion for summary judgment to the question whether a material factual dispute exists. <em>Township of Bensalem </em>v. <em>Moore, </em>152 Pa. Commw. 540, 620 A.2d 76 (1993). For summary judgment purposes, a material fact is one that directly affects the outcome of the case. <em>Kuney </em>v. <em>Benjamin Franklin Clinic, </em>751 A.2d 662 (Pa. Super. 2000). \u201cThus, the overall purpose of a motion for summary judgment is to dispose of those cases in which <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"37\">*37</page-number>there exists no factual issue to be decided at trial.\u201d <em>Harris by Harris </em>v. <em>Hanberry, </em>149 Pa. Commw. 300, 302, 613 A.2d 101, 102 (1992).</p>\n<p id=\"b51-4\">B. <em>The Scope of Defense</em><footnotemark><em>2</em></footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b51-5\">Interpretation of an insurance contract is a matter of law and is the province of the court, not the jury. <em>Madison Construction Co. </em>v. <em>Harleysville Mutual Insurance Co., </em>557 Pa. 595, 606, 735 A.2d 100, 106 (1999). \u201cIn interpreting the language of a policy, the goal is \u2018to ascertain the intent of the parties as manifested by the language of the written instrument.\u2019 \u201d <em>The Municipality of Mt. Lebanon </em>v. <em>Reliance Insurance Co., </em>778 A.2d 1228, 1231-32 (Pa. Super. 2001) (quoting <em>Madison Construction, supra </em>at 606, 735 A.2d at 106). \u201cIndeed, our Supreme Court has instructed that the \u2018polestar of our inquiry ... is the language of the insurance policy.\u2019 \u201d788 A.2d at 1232 (quoting <em>Madison Construction, supra </em>at 606, 735 A.2d at 106).</p>\n<p id=\"b51-6\">\u201cWhere ... the language of the [insurance] contract is clear and unambiguous, a court is required to give effect to that language.\u201d <em>Madison Construction, supra </em>at 606, 735 A.2d at 106 (quoting <em>Gene &amp; Harvey Builders Inc. v. Pennsylvania Manufacturers Association Inc. Co., </em>512 Pa. 420, 426, 517 A.2d 910, 913 (1986)). (other citations omitted) When construing a policy, \u201c[w]ords of common usage . . . are to be construed in their natural, plain and ordinary sense... and we may inform our understanding of these terms by considering their- dictionary definitions.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 608, 735 A.2d at 108. (citations omitted)</p>\n<p id=\"b52-2\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"38\">*38</page-number>While a court must not \u201cdistort the meaning of the language or resort to a strained contrivance in order to find an ambiguity^,]\u201d it must find that \u201ccontractual terms are ambiguous if they are subj ect to more than one reasonable interpretation when applied to a particular set of facts.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 606,735 A.2d at 106. \u201cWhere a provision of a policy is ambiguous, the policy provision is to be construed in favor of the insured and against the insurer, the drafter of the agreement.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(quoting <em>Gene </em>&amp; <em>Harvey Builders, supra </em>at 426, 517 A.2d at 913). (other citations omitted)</p>\n<p id=\"b52-3\">Finally, \u201c[i]n determining what the parties intended by their contract, the law must look to what they clearly expressed. Courts, in interpreting a contract, do not assume that its language was chosen carelessly.\u201d <em>Steuart </em>v. <em>McChesney, </em>498 Pa. 45, 51, 444 A.2d 659, 662 (1982) (quoting <em>Moore </em>v. <em>Stevens Coal Co., </em>315 Pa. 564, 568, 173 A. 661, 662 (1934)). Thus, we will not consider merely individual terms utilized in the insurance contract, but the entire insurance provision to ascertain the intent of the parties.</p>\n<p id=\"b52-4\">Here, a dispute centers upon the interpretation of the term \u201coccurrence\u201d found in five of the insurance polices issued by One Beacon covering the period from January 1,1967 to April 1,1992,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> and the four insurance policies <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"39\">*39</page-number>issued by Century covering the period from April 1, 1982 to April 1, 1986. Kvaerner argues that all the asbestos-related personal injury claims embodied in the underlying suits should be identified and corelated by construction sites and that each construction site should constitute an occurrence. One Beacon on the other hand argues that all the asbestos-related personal injury claims alleged by claimants were caused by a single occurrence, the continuous or repeated exposure to the asbestos and, thus, the underlying injuries result from one occurrence.</p>\n<p id=\"b53-5\">The policies define \u201coccurrence\u201d as \u201can accident, including continuous or repeated exposure to conditions, which results in bodily injury or property damage neither expected nor intended from the standpoint of the insured.\u201d Defendants\u2019 appendix III exhibit \u201cF\u201d definition. In addition to the above policy definition, the \u201cLimits of liability\u201d provisions are also instructive. They provide in pertinent part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b53-6\">\u201cFor the purpose of determining the company\u2019s liability, all <em>Bodily Injury </em>and <em>Property Damage </em>arising out of continuous or repeated exposure to substantially the same general conditions shall be considered as arising out of one Occurrence.\u201d Defendants\u2019 appendix volume III exhibit F, amendments limits of liability (single limit).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b53-7\">The general rule is that an occurrence is determined by the cause or causes of the resulting injury. See <em>Appalachian Insurance Co. v. Liberty Mutual Insurance Co., </em>676 F.2d 56 (3d Cir. 1982). Using this analysis, the inquiry is whether \u201cthere is but one proximate, uninterrupted, and continuing cause which resulted in all of the injuries and damage.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Consideration of the policy <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"40\">*40</page-number>language and application of the general rule to the facts of this case lead this court to conclude that the construction of furnaces at each construction site constituted a separate occurrence, in that at each construction site there was a new exposure and another occurrence. See <em>Stonewall Insurance Co. </em>v. <em>Asbestos Claims Mgmt Co., </em>73 F.3d 1178 (2nd Cir. 1995) (Installation of asbestos at each building was a separate occurrence because each installation created exposure to a condition which resulted in property damage neither expected nor intended.); see also, <em>Fina Inc. </em>v. <em>The Travelers Indem. Co., </em>184 F. Supp.2d 547 (N.D. 2002) (underlying asbestos claims constitute multiple occurrences).</p>\n<p id=\"b54-3\">Kvaerner\u2019s activities which triggered the underlying claims did not arise from a single, negligent practice that could be considered one cause, such as distributing a uniformly defective product from a single manufacturer or selling a product containing asbestos from one location. Instead, the exposure to asbestos arose from the construction of furnaces at different sites, at different times and for varying lengths of time. Consequently, the claimants that were exposed to asbestos at the same location and at the same time were exposed to \u201csubstantially the same general condition.\u201d Accordingly, the claims for each site should be considered one occurrence.</p>\n<p id=\"b54-4\">In urging justification for its position that the exposure to asbestos constitutes a single occurrence, One Beacon relies upon the omission of a sentence set forth in the first policy from subsequently issued insurance policies. That omitted sentence reads: \u201cAll such exposure to substantially the same general conditions existing at or emanating from each premises location shall be <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"41\">*41</page-number>deemed one occurrence.\u201d The court, however, finds that this omission does not demonstrate that the drafters of the insurance policy intended the result urged by One Beacon. Instead, the court accepts Kvaerner\u2019s explanation that the definition of occurrence contained within the five subsequently issued policies is consistent with the industry standard and that no change was intended by the insurer in defining the number of occurrences. See Appleman on Insurance Law and Practice (2nd ed.) \u00a7117.1.</p>\n<p id=\"b55-5\">Moreover, although the sentence was omitted from one section of the later policies due to a change in the industry standard, new language was added to the limits of liability sections which incorporate the substance of the pertinent sentence. The new paragraph under the section entitled limits of liability states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b55-6\">\u201cFor the purpose of determining the limit of the company\u2019s liability, all <em>bodily injury </em>and <em>property damage </em>arising out of continuous or repeated exposure to substantially the same general conditions shall be considered as arising out of one occurrence.\u201d See defendant One Beacon\u2019s appendix exhibit B.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b55-7\">This provision supports the conclusion that the asbestos exposure arising at each construction site constituted an occurrence. Accordingly, defendants\u2019 motion for summary judgment as it pertains to the scope of defense is <em>denied.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b55-8\">C. <em>Defendants Should Be Permitted To Control the Defense of Future Claims</em></p>\n<p id=\"b55-9\">Defendants also move for summary judgment on the issue relative to the right to control the defense of the claims. Defendants maintain that they have a right to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"42\">*42</page-number>control the defense consistent with the terms, conditions, exclusions and endorsements of the triggered policies. Conversely, Kvaerner argues that defendants have waived their right to control the defense of pending claims and that the existence of a conflict of interest will vitiate any right the insurers might otherwise have to control the defense of future claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b56-3\">This court will grant defendants\u2019 motion as it pertains to future claims, but deny defendants\u2019 motion as it pertains to the pending claims.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b56-4\">The insurance policies issued by defendants provide that they have a duty and a right to defend the claims made against Kvaerner. Specifically, the policies provide:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b56-5\">\n<em>\u201cDefense, settlement, supplementary payments</em>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b56-6\">\u201cWith respect to such insurance as is afforded by this policy, the company shall:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b56-7\">\u201c(a) defend any suit against the insured alleging such injury, sickness, disease or destruction and seeking damages on account thereof, even if such suit is groundless, false or fraudulent; but the company may make such investigation, negotiation and settlement of any claim or suit as it deems expedient.\u201d One Beacon policy no. **- *****, insuring agreement II.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b56-8\">Additionally, the policy contains a provision entitled \u201cAssistance and cooperation of the insured\u201d condition (no. 10) which states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b56-9\">\u201cThe insured shall cooperate with the company and, upon the company\u2019s request, attend hearings and trials, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"43\">*43</page-number>assist in effecting settlements, securing and giving evidence, obtaining the attendance of witnesses and in the conduct of any legal proceedings in connection with the subject matter of this insurance. The insured shall not, except at his own cost, voluntarily make any payment, assume any obligation or incur any expense other than for such immediate medical and surgical relief to others as shall be imperative at the time of the accident.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b57-5\">As to pending claims, Kvaerner argues that, by failing to step forward and honor their defense obligation from the outset, defendants have waived and forfeited any right to control the defense of the pending claims. This court believes that Kvaerner should continue to maintain the right to control the defense of the pending claims subject to defendants\u2019 supervision in order to maintain the consistency of the defense. If Kvaerner were to relinquish control of the defense of the pending claims, the effects of the hard work expended by its defense teams thus far in defending present claims would likely be so attenuated so as to be deemed a real loss. Hence, in the interests of consistency the right to control the pending claims should remain with Kvaerner.</p>\n<p id=\"b57-6\">As to future claims, Kvaerner argues that conflict of interests will vitiate any right the insurers might otherwise have had to control the defense of these claims. The court, however, does not find that there now exists a conflict of interest.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b57-7\">\u201cWhen a liability insurer retains counsel to defend an insured, the insured is considered the client. If a conflict of interest arises between an insurer and its insured, the attorney representing the insured must act exclusively on behalf of, and in the best interests of, the insured.\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"44\">*44</page-number><em>Rector, Wardens and Vestryman of St. Peter\u2019s Church </em>v. <em>Am. Nat\u2019l Fire Ins. Co., </em>2002 U.S. Dist. Lexis 625 (E.D. Pa. 2002) (citing <em>Builders Square </em>v. <em>Saraco, </em>1996 U.S. Dist. Lexis 19444 (E.D. Pa. Dec. 27, 1996)); see also, <em>Point Pleasant Canoe Rental Inc. </em>v. <em>Tinicum Township, </em>110 F.R.D. 166,170 (E.D. Pa. 1986).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b58-5\">A conflict of interest arises between an insured and insurer when the company\u2019s pursuit of its own best interests in the litigation is incompatible with the best interests of the insured. <em>Rector, Wardens and Vestryman of St. Peter\u2019s Church </em>v. <em>Am. Natl Fire Ins. Co., </em>2002 U.S. Dist. Lexis 625 (E.D. Pa. 2002) (quoting <em>St. Paul Fire &amp; Marine Ins. Co. v. Roach Bros. Co., </em>639 F. Supp. 134, 138-39 (E.D. Pa. 1986)). Courts have concluded that one appropriate resolution in this circumstance is for the insurer to obtain separate, independent counsel for its insured, or to pay the costs incurred by an insured in hiring counsel. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b58-6\">In support of its contention that it should be entitled to maintain control of the defense of future claims made against it, Kvaerner stresses the defendants\u2019 past conduct, such as their attempts to avoid or limit their coverage obligations, their assertion of a single occurrence theory and requiring that the complaints in the underlying claims spell out on their face the particular Kvaerner predecessor whose activities give rise to the claim. Kvaerner also argues that, if afforded the opportunity to control the defense, defendants would settle claims at a rate and in amounts that hasten the termination of their defense duties but at the same time raise Kvaerner\u2019s profile and make it a more inviting target for claimants.</p>\n<p id=\"b59-2\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"45\">*45</page-number>Kvaerner\u2019s reasons for maintaining control are based on a theoretical possibility that a conflict will arise. Kvaerner has not directed the court to any fact of record that would establish an actual conflict and suggest that the attorneys retained by defendants will subordinate their ethical obligation to Kvaerner to some sense of duty owing to the insurance carrier.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> To some extent, Kvaerner seeks to promote a per se rule that counsel provided to an insured by an insurance company is likely to disregard his ethical duty to his client. This court is unwilling to adopt such a rule based solely on Kvaerner\u2019s expectation that a conflict will arise. By so ruling, the court is not suggesting that conflicts do not arise. The court recognizes that situations exist which may warrant retaining independent counsel due to a conflict of interest between an insured and an insurer. The court, however, does not find that such a situation exists at this time. If, at a later time, an actual conflict arises between the insurer and the insured, Kvaerner, may, if it so chooses, move for the appointment of independent counsel. Accordingly, defendants\u2019 motion on the issue of control is granted in part. Defendants may assume control of claims filed after the date of this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b59-3\">D. <em>Coverage Under the Policy Issued to D.M. International</em></p>\n<p id=\"b59-4\">Century maintains that an error occurred in drafting the \u201cnamed insured\u201d endorsement to policy no. ************ issued to D.M. International Inc. Century argues that the parties did not intend to provide cov<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"46\">*46</page-number>erage to Davy Inc. or its subsidiaries under this policy but, rather, intended to provide coverage to D.M. International and its subsidiaries, and that a scrivener\u2019s error occurred. Kvaerner argues that Century has furnished no facts to demonstrate its claim of mutual mistake.</p>\n<p id=\"b60-5\">In order to justify reformation of a contract on the basis of \u201cmutual mistake,\u201d evidence of the mistake must be \u201cclear and convincing.\u201d <em>Jones </em>v. <em>Prudential Property and Casualty Insurance Co., </em>856 A.2d 838, 844 (Pa. Super. 2004). A mutual mistake exists only where \u201cboth parties to a contract [are] mistaken as to existing facts at the time of execution.\u201d <em>Smith </em>v. <em>Thomas Jefferson University Hospital, </em>424 Pa. Super. 41, 45, 621 A.2d 1030, 1032 (1993).</p>\n<p id=\"b60-6\">Here, Century fails to point to sufficient evidence to establish a mutual mistake, namely Kvaemer\u2019s awareness of the mistake in the named insured endorsement. Instead, Century relies upon internal inconsistencies within the endorsement, an alleged course of conduct established by the policies issued by Century\u2019s predecessor and an alleged redundancy in coverage if Kvaerner\u2019s position were adopted. Since no discovery has occurred to date, the finds that Century\u2019s partial motion for summary judgment on this issue is premature. Accordingly, Century\u2019s motion is denied without prejudice.</p>\n<p id=\"b60-7\">CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b60-8\">For the reasons discussed, the parties\u2019 respective motions for partial summary judgment are granted, in part, as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b60-9\">(1) The court finds that defendants, One Beacon Insurance Company and Century Indemnity Company, are <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"47\">*47</page-number>obligated under their respective insurance policies to defend plaintiff Kvaerner U.S. Inc. (KUSI), or to pay 100 percent of the reasonable and necessary defense costs incurred by KUSI after September 6, 2001, or any other date which may be agreed to by the respective parties after the entry of this order, with respect to any asbestos personal injury claim asserted against KUSI and covered under the subject insurance policies, if the complaint in the personal injury case can be read to permit proof, potentially, (a) that the asbestos claimant suffered an asbestos-related injury by reason of exposure to asbestos fibers, and that KUSI and one or more of its covered predecessors are liable therefore, and (b) that any part of the period from the claimant\u2019s first exposure to asbestos, to and including the date of manifestation of the claimant\u2019s asbestos-related injury, occurred during the effective period of one or more of One Beacon\u2019s or Century\u2019s policies.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b61-5\">(2) The court finds further that, in the event that an asbestos claimant\u2019s complaint can be read to permit proof as described in paragraph 1 above, KUSI may select any policy or policies under which a defendant is obligated as provided in paragraph 1 above, and may require that the defense, or the reimbursement of defense costs, be provided pursuant to such policy or policies. KUSI shall not be obligated to pay any portion of any defense costs with respect to any asbestos claim where part of the period from the claimant\u2019s alleged initial exposure to asbestos and including alleged manifestation of asbestos-related injury occurred or may have occurred during the effective period of one or more of One Beacon\u2019s or Century\u2019s insurance policies.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b62-2\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"48\">*48</page-number>(3) The court.further finds that:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b62-3\">(a) Insofar as a defendant\u2019s defense duty is triggered under any policy or policies, defendants may assume control of all <em>future </em>claims filed after the date of this opinion and consistent with the terms, conditions, exclusions and endorsements of the triggered policy or policies, and may undertake investigation, negotiation and settlement of any claim or suit as it deems expedient.

(KUSI), or to pay 100 percent of the reasonable and necessary defense costs incurred by KUSI after September 6,2001, or any other date which may be agreed to by the respective parties after the entry of this order, with respect to any asbestos personal injury claim asserted against KUSI and covered under the subj ect insurance policies, if the complaint in the personal injury case can be read to permit proof, potentially, (a) that the asbestos claimant suffered an asbestos-related injury by reason of exposure to asbestos fibers and that KU SI and one or more of its covered predecessors are liable therefore, and (b) any part of the period from the claimant\u2019s first exposure to asbestos, to and including the date of manifestation of the claimant\u2019s asbestos-related injury, occurred during the effective period of one or more of One Beacon\u2019s or Century\u2019s policies.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b63-5\">(2) The court finds further that, in the event that an asbestos claimant\u2019s complaint can be read to permit proof as described in paragraph 1 above, KUSI may select any <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"50\">*50</page-number>policy or policies under which a defendant is obligated as provided in paragraph 1 above, and may require that the defense, or the reimbursement of defense costs, be provided pursuant to such policy or policies. KUSI shall not be obligated to pay any portion of any defense costs with respect to any asbestos claim where part of the period from the claimant\u2019s alleged initial exposure to asbestos and including alleged manifestation of asbestos-related injury occurred or may have occurred during the effective period of one or more of One Beacon\u2019s or Century\u2019s insurance policies.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b64-3\">(3) The court further finds that:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b64-4\">(a) Insofar as a defendant\u2019s defense duty is triggered under any policy or policies, defendants may assume control of all <em>future </em>claims filed after the date of this opinion and consistent with the terms, conditions, exclusions and endorsements of the triggered policy or policies, and may undertake investigation, negotiation and settlement of any claim or suit as it deems expedient. This finding is made with the understanding that all defendants establish a framework that is consistent with the framework used to handle the past and present asbestos claims. (Pending claims shall continue to be handled by plaintiffs in the manner presently extant.)</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b64-5\">(b) In accordance with the provisions within the policy, plaintiffs are under a duty, with respect to all underlying claims defended by defendants, of assistance and cooperation with defendants in the defense of the claims;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b64-6\">(c) Defendants\u2019 duty to defend under any particular policy at issue ends once payments equal to the policy\u2019s occurrence limit have been made in reimbursement of asbestos settlements and/or in satisfaction of asbestos verdicts;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b65-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"51\">*51</page-number>(4) All underlying bodily injury claims arising out of <em>each </em>separate construction site or premise shall be deemed to be a separate, <em>single </em>occurrence.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b65-5\">(5) Century Insurance Company\u2019s partial motion for summary judgment is denied without prejudice.</blockquote>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b50-9\">. The parties agree that, for purposes of deciding this motion, a choice of law analysis is unnecessary since there appears to be a material agreement between Pennsylvania and Ohio authorities.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b51-7\">. Defendant Century takes no position on this issue.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b52-5\">. In the One Beacon policy no. **.***** covering the period from February 14, 1964 to February 15, 1967, the term \u201coccurrence\u201d is defined differently. In this policy, \u201coccurrence\u201d is defined as \u201can event, or continuous or repeated exposure to conditions which unexpectedly causes injury during the policy period. All such exposure to substantially the same general conditions existing at or emanating from each premises location shall be deemed one occurrence.\u201d One Beacon agrees that the second sentence of this endorsement\u2019s definition, found only in the first of the six One Beacon policies, supports plaintiffs\u2019 one occurrence per site argument.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b56-10\">. With regard to past claims, defendants concede, and the court agrees, that the issue pertaining to the right to control is moot since these claims have been resolved.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b59-5\">. After considering its options, defendants may opt to retain current counsel for Kvaerner.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
