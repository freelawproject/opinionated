Warfield for all the land sued for except the part claimed by T. E. Shirley and L. A. Scott, upon the following conclusions of fact, which we approve, except the last clause of the second finding:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b474-6\">\u201c1. The James H. Warfield survey No. 10, in Jones County, Texas, the land in controversy, made by virtue of certificate No. 984, issued by the Board of Land Commissioners of Harris County, on December 2, 1850, was patented on August 3, 1853, to the heirs of James H. Warfield, by patent No. 528, vol. 7.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b474-7\">\u201c2. James H. Warfield, the party to whom the certificate above mentioned was issued, enlisted in Kentucky as assistant quartermaster in the army of Texas, in 1836, and served as such in Texas from January 6, 1837, till July 1, 1837, and was a volunteer from a foreign country.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b474-8\">\u201c3. James H. Warfield, the party to whom the certificate issued, and to whose heirs the land in controversy was patented, died in Harris County, Texas, in 1839, and plaintiffs in this suit are the sole heirs of said James H. Warfield.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b474-9\">\u201c4. One Aug. C. Daws, on December 16, 1850, filed in the County <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"451\">*451</page-number>Court of Harris County, Texas, his application for letters of administration upon the estate of said James H. Warfield.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b475-3\">\u201c5. At the December Term of said court letters of administration were granted as prajred for by Daws.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b475-4\">\u201c6. By order of said County Court said administrator sold said James H. Warfield land certificate to pay costs of administration, said sale being made to W. B. Baker, the clerk of said court.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b475-5\">\u201c7. Said sale was reported to said court at its February term, 1851, and at same term approved by said court, and a deed was ordered to be made to said W. B. Baker, which was done February 25, 1851, the purchase money having been paid.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b475-6\">\u201c8. Jesse M. Kirkland, through whom defendants T. E. Shirley and L. A. Scott claim an undivided one-third of the land in controversy, received a deed to said one-third of said land on February 3, 1883, which was recorded in Jones County, Texas, March 5, 1883.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b475-7\">\u201c9. Defendants T. E. Shirley and L. A. Scott introduced a regular chain of deeds from W. B. Baker through Jesse M. Kirkland to themselves for one-third undivided interest in the land in controversy, which said deeds are duty recorded in Jones County.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b475-8\">\u201c10. Defendants T. E. Shirley and L. A. Scott, and those under whom they claim, have had possession of one-third of the land in controversy, claiming and holding same under deeds duty registered, and paying all taxes due on same, for five years prior to the institution of this suit.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b475-9\">\u201c11. Defendants other than Shirley and Scott have had no possession of the land claimed by them, but have paid taxes on two-thirds oi the land in controversy for five years prior to the filing of this suit.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b475-10\">\u201c12. Plaintiffs Susan V. Browder, Amanda M. Sypert, P. W. Hendrick, Bettie B. Bradley, Huldah B. Wood (by coverture), and plaintiffs Charles M. Warfield, Lords Minter Warfield, Alice Vivion Warfield, and George Merriwether (by infancy), are not affected by any statute of limitation.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b475-11\">From this judgment the defendants other than Shirley and Scott, designing title to an undivided two-thirds interest under the administration sale to W. B. Baker, prosecute this appeal. There is no evidence in the record that any of the parties claiming under said administration sale were purchasers for value, or without notice of its alleged invalidity, unless such inference be justified by the mere existence of their chain of title. The controversy, then, turns upon the effect of the administration proceeding, which culminated in that sale, as follows:</p>\n<p id=\"b475-12\">Petition, filed December 16, 1850.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b475-13\">\u201cTo the Hon.

Baker, Clerk County Court.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b479-10\"><em>Opinion. </em>\u2014From the foregoing conclusions of fact it appears that James H. Warfield, to whose heirs the land in controversy was granted, not only enlisted in the army of Texas, but also that he was an immigrant and died here in 1839. He was, then, a \u201ccitizen soldier\u201d who died after the war, rather than a \u201cvolunteer from a foreign country\u201d when he died. The certificate under which the land was located was granted to his administrator by virtue of his immigration. The ground, therefore, upon which the trial court held the administration of the Warfield estate to be void is not tenable, as was in effect decided in the case of Vogelsang v. Daugherty, 46 Texas, 466. Unless upon some other ground it was void, and therefore subject to collateral attack, the judgment must be reversed.</p>\n<p id=\"b479-11\">Expressions may be found in the opinion of our Supreme Court from which the conclusion might be drawn, that after the lapse of more than ten years from death to administration, as in this case, the presumption against the existence of debts would he sufficient to prevent the Probate Court from taking jurisdiction. The elaborate opinion of Justice Stayton, however, in the case of Martin v. Robinson, 67 Texas, 368, reviewing previous cases and construing the probate law of 1848, under which the administration in question was had, is in conflict with this view. In line with this opinion is the case of Lynne v. Sanford, 82 Texas, 58, and the two quite recent and elaborate opinions of Justice Denman in Crawford v. McDonald and Templeton v. Ferguson, 33 S. W. Rep., 325 and 329.</p>\n<p id=\"b479-12\">The petition for administration represented that Warfield had died in 1839, in Harris County, intestate, and that he was possessed of property and owed debts, and that letters were applied for at the request of a creditor. The order appointing an administrator upon such an application could not be declared void for want of jurisdiction, unless it <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"456\">*456</page-number>should otherwise appear from the record that the administration was unauthorized.</p>\n<p id=\"b480-3\">In Duncan v. Veal, 49 Texas, 603, Justice Moore, in considering an administration very similar to the one above set out, uses this language, which has since been quoted with approval: \u201cIt is too plain to require argument to demonstrate, that De Cordova administered upon the estate, not for the benefit of those in any way interested in it, but of those to be benefited by the costs to be hereby incurred, or who wished to profit by the sale of the certificate belonging to the decedent. The time and circumstances under which the pretended letters were granted render it obvious that, although nominally he obtained letters of administration on the estate of a deceased soldier of the Republic, he in fact administered upon that of his heirs; and, under the guise and pretense of administration, he attempted to sell and transfer to- the principal beneficiary of the pretended administration property of the heirs with which neither he nor his confederates had any right to intermeddle.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b480-4\">This difference, however, will be noted between the two administrations; the one there considered was expressly prohibited, the estate being that of a foreign volunteer who died in the war, while, as already seen, the Warfield estate was that of an immigrant who died after the war.</p>\n<p id=\"b480-5\">In Paul v. Willis, 69. Texas, 261, this language, which is also applicable to the case at bar, was used by Judge Collard: \u201cIt is apparent that this administration was obtained to consume the estate and misapply it under the semblance of legal authority and by the aid of the Probate Court.\u201d But it was there further stated that \u201csuch fact of itself would not render the administration void as to third parties, that is, the attempt to misapply the estate would not, but the fact does furnish a reason why the law will, after such lapse of time, presume and declare such administration void.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b480-6\">In Harwood v. Wylie, 70 Texas, 538, the same judge said: \u201cCourts should not hold an administration valid, even in a collateral attack, when it is shown to have been obtained for fraudulent purposes and by methods violative of express law.\u201d The court was there considering another administration of that notorious class taken out on the estate of a deceased soldier who perished at the Alamo, and hence expressly forbidden.</p>\n<p id=\"b480-7\">In both these cases, as in all others we have examined, the administration was declared null on collateral attack upon some other ground than that of manifest fraud in acquiring title to a decedent\u2019s estate through probate proceedings instituted for that purpose. It is well settled that a judgment is not subject to attack collaterally on the sole ground of fraud, the jurisdictional facts appearing or being presumable. The fact that such fraud may be inferred from the course and result of the proceeding, as in this case, without other proof, provided it does <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"457\">*457</page-number>not show a want of jurisdiction, should not, we think, constitute an exception to the rule.</p>\n<decisiondate id=\"b481-10\">Delivered February 15, 1896.</decisiondate>\n<p id=\"b481-5\">The conclusiveness of judgments against collateral attack rests upon that policy of the law which seeks to put an end to litigation and give repose to titles. It is also a reasonable rule, because a remedy by direct proceeding is provided, usually in more than one form. Parties and privies of whose rights jurisdiction is acquired should therefore be held to pursue the remedy so provided in avoidance of a fraudulent judgment, irrespective of how that fraud may be made to appear. It is shown by the proceeding itself, without resort to evidence aliunde, so much the easier the task of avoiding it.</p>\n<p id=\"b481-6\">Even where the remedy at law proves inadequate, equity affords relief against the beneficiary of a judgment so fraudulently procured, no rights of purchasers for value and without notice intervening, by declaring a constructive trust and requiring a restoration to the true owner of the .avails of the fraud so accomplished. Heidenheimer v. Loring, 6 Texas Civ. App., 560, and cases there cited in the opinion of Chief Justice Garrett, particularly the latter part of the opinion of Justice Stayton in Martin v. Eobinson, supra.</p>\n<p id=\"b481-7\">Such affirmative equitable relief, however, must be sought by appropriate averments, and is not available under the ordinary petition, as in this case, of trespass to try title. Fisher v. Wood, 65 Texas, 199. In view of the great lapse of time \u2014 nearly a half century \u2014 since the probate sale in question, it is not at all probable that anything could now be accomplished by such an equitable suit, so long neglected.</p>\n<p id=\"b481-8\">Our conclusion is that the judgment should be reversed and here rendered in favor of appellants.</p>\n<p id=\"b481-9\">\n<em>Reversed and rendered.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
