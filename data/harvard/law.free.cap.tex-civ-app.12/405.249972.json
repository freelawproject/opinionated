And if Mayer, Kahn &amp; Freiberg used the brand on the same grade of whisky that Flanagan did, the public would not be injuriously affected; if they did not, it was their own wrong, and they can not take advantage of it.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b430-5\">GARRETT, Chief Justice.</author>\n<p id=\"ABL\">In January, 1890, and for sometime</p>\n<p id=\"AyH\">prior thereto, S. J. Flanagan was a wholesale liquor dealer, doing business under the firm name of J. E. Magale, and as such dealer he bought and sold whisky manufactured by R. Monarch &amp; Co., of Owensboro, Ky. He devised a brand or trade mark for himself which he stamped on the barrels containing such whisky, above the brand of R. Monarch &amp; Co. The brand was \u201cMagale\u2019s,\u201d and when stamped on the packages would make the brand read \u201cMagale\u2019s Monarch- Whisky,\u201d or it might be applied to other brands of whisky manufactured by R. Monarch &amp; Co. The business had been established by J. F. Magale, who afterwards died. Flanagan succeeded to the business, and himself devised the brand or trade mark. The name of \u201cMagale\u201d gave the whisky value because of his general reputation for integrity and honesty in his dealings with his customers and in all business transactions. About January 18, 1890, Flanagan ceased to do business, and on that date entered into a contract with Freiberg, Klein &amp; Co. by which he undertook to assign to them said brand or trade mark in consideration of the payment by them to him at the end of each year of the sum of $250 per annum, and $4 a barrel for all of said \u201cMonarch\u201d whisky that might be sold in excess of 100 barrels during the year, for the term of five years, with the privilege on the part of said Freiberg, Klein &amp; Co. to renew the contract for another period of five years, at the end of which time said brand or trade-mark should become their property. Freiberg, Klein &amp; Co. afterwards became insolvent, and about January, 1893, with the consent and approval of Flanagan, they assigned their <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"407\">*407</page-number>contract with him to Mayer, Kahn &amp; Freiberg, in consideration of which the latter firm paid them the sum of $250, and agreed to pay Flanagan all sums that should become due him under the contract. Mayer, Kahn <em>&amp; </em>Freiberg paid Flanagan nothing.</p>\n<decisiondate id=\"b431-9\">Delivered February 20, 1896.</decisiondate>\n<p id=\"b431-3\">This suit was brought by Flanagan February 12, 1894, against both firms to recover of Freiberg, Klein &amp; Co. the sitm of $250 for the annuity of 1892, and $400 royalty on the sale of 200 barrels of whisky for that year; and of Mayer, Kahn &amp; Freiberg the sum of $500 for the years 1893 and 1894, and $800 royalty for 300 barrels sold. But if the court should be of the opinion that Mayer, Kahn &amp; Freiberg were not liable, they asked judgment against Freiberg, Klein &amp; Co. for the entire amount.</p>\n<p id=\"b431-4\">The latter suffered judgment by default. Mayer, Kahn &amp; Freiberg, after demurring both generally and specially, pleaded under oath, that the contract was against public policy and void, as calculated to deceive the customers of Freiberg, Klein &amp; Co. and their own and the public generally; also, that it was without consideration.</p>\n<p id=\"b431-5\">Judgment was rendered by default against Freiberg, Klein &amp; Co. for the sum of $250, and on trial without a jury, for $250 against Mayer, Kahn &amp; Freiberg.</p>\n<p id=\"b431-6\">The defendant in error, as the selector and seller of the whisky of R. Monarch &amp; Co., had the right to devise and use a brand or trademark to designate to the trade such whisky purchased by him from that firm as his firm should sell. 26 Am. &amp; Eng. Encyc. Law, 361. But the primary function of a trade mark is to indicate ownership and origin, and unless this is truthfully done, it becomes a means of fraud upon the public and will not be protected. And if a trade mark is a personal one, designating a particular person and his reputation and skill, it cannot truthfully be used by any other person, and consequently cannot be assigned. 26 Am. &amp; Eng. Encyc. Law, 371. The brand or trade mark, \u201cMagale\u2019s Monarch Whisky,\u201d was personal to the firm of J. F. Magale, since it derived its value from the known skill, integrity and honesty of the firm of J. F. Magale in selecting good whisky and selling it without adulteration. By their use of the trade mark, the plaintiffs in error deceived their customers with the representation that the whisky upon which it was used was selected and sold by the firm of J. F. Magale, Avhich was not the truth, and was not intended to be the truth by the contract of assignment. It would be against public policy to enforce such a contract. Again, since the defendant in error could not assign the trademark, the contract Avas without consideration, and could not be enforced on that account.</p>\n<p id=\"b431-7\">Since the plaintiff, Flanagan, cannot maintain his action, it is unnecessary to pass upon the other questions presented. The judgment of the court below will be reversed and judgment here rendered in favor of the plaintiffs in error.</p>\n<p id=\"b431-8\">\n<em>Reversed and remanded.</em>\n</p>\n<otherdate id=\"b432-7\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"408\">*408</page-number>Delivered March 19, 1896.</otherdate>\n<p id=\"b432-3\">ON MOTION FOR REHEARING.</p>\n<p id=\"b432-4\">GARRETT, Chief Justice. \u2014 Defendant in error himself composed the firm of J. E. Magale, and the brand, \u201cMagale\u2019s Monarch Whisky,\u201d indicated Monarch whisky selected and sold by the firm of J. F. Magale. When the brand was sold to the plaintiffs in error, there was no sale, of the business of J. F. Magale to them, nor was it intended that Flanagan, the constituent of the firm of J. F. Magale, should continue to select the whisky sold by plaintiffs in error, so the brand, when used by Mayer, Kahn &amp; Freiberg, would not speak truly, for it would not be upon the whisky selected and sold by the firm of J. F. Magale, nor was it intended to be so placed, but on the contrary to be put on whisky selected and sold by plaintiffs in error. Flanagan may have believed ever so much that he had the right to sell the brand for use by plaintiffs in error, and he may not have intended to deceive, and the court does not find that he did so intend, but the transaction could have no other effect than to deceive and mislead the customers of Freiberg, Klein &amp; Co. into the belief that they were buying Monarch whisky selected by the firm of J. F. Magale. Such being the effect, the law characterizes the transaction, and pronounces it against public policy.</p>\n<p id=\"b432-5\">We see no reason to change the result heretofore reached by the court, and the motion for rehearing will be overruled.</p>\n<p id=\"b432-6\">\n<em>Overruled.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b432-8\">Writ of error refused.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
