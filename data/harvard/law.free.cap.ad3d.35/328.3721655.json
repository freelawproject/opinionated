The proposed amended complaint was supplemented by copies of the signature cards from eight of the allegedly converted accounts thereby demonstrating \u201cgood ground\u201d to support that cause of action <em>(see </em>CPLR 3211 [e]; <em>cf. Island Surgical Supply Co. v Allstate Ins. Co., </em>32 AD3d 824, 825 [2006]).</p>\n<p id=\"b351-7\">\u201cOn a motion to dismiss pursuant to CPLR 3211, the amended complaint is to be afforded a liberal construction. The facts as alleged in the amended complaint are accepted as true, the plaintiff is accorded the benefit of every possible favorable inference, and the court\u2019s function is to determine only whether the facts as alleged fit within any cognizable legal theory\u201d <em>(Goldfarb v Schwartz, </em>26 AD3d 462, 463 [2006]; <em>see Leon v Martinez, </em>84 NY2d 83, 87-88 [1994]). Contrary to the defendants\u2019 contentions, the allegations of the amended complaint, including the allegation that, without the consent of the plaintiff Alfred Adams, the defendant Stephen C. Hickey transferred the proceeds of accounts co-owned by Mr. Adams and the decedent, Kathryn M. Neenan, into accounts in trust for the defendants, state a valid cause of action to recover damages for conversion <em>(see </em>Banking Law \u00a7 675; <em>Sperrazza v Kail, </em>267 AD2d 692 [1999]; <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"330\">*330</page-number><em>Gutkin v Manicone, 255 </em>AD2d 552 [1998]). \u201cGenerally, the deposit of funds into a joint account \u2018in the name of such depositor. . . and another person and in form to be paid or delivered to either, or the survivor of them\u2019 constitutes prima facie evidence of an intent to create a joint tenancy (Banking Law \u00a7 675 [a], [b])\u201d <em>(Matter of Fayo, </em>7 AD3d 795, 796 [2004]). Therefore, a decedent who deposited money in a joint bank account is \u201cpresumed to have conferred on the cotenant not only a mere expectancy, but rather a gift of a one-half interest in the deposited funds\u201d <em>(Matter of Bobeck, </em>143 AD2d 90, 92 [1988]; <em>see Matter of Kleinberg v Heller, </em>38 NY2d 836 [1976]).</p>\n<p id=\"b352-4\">The plaintiffs\u2019 remaining contentions are without merit. Adams, J.E, Ritter, Santucci and Lifson, JJ., concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
