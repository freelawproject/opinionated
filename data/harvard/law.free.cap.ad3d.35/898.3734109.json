In accordance with the plea agreement, defendant was sentenced to 10 years of probation, the terms of which provided, among other things, that defendant not violate any state, federal or local law during such probation. In July 2003, defendant was arrested and charged with sexual abuse in the second degree and endangering the welfare of a child, prompting the filing of a petition charging defendant with violation of his probation. Following a hearing, County Court terminated defendant\u2019s probation and sentenced him to an indeterminate term of imprisonment of lVs to 4 years. Defendant now appeals and we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b921-5\">Contrary to defendant\u2019s assertions, the People\u2019s evidence supported a finding of defendant\u2019s violation by a preponderance of evidence <em>(see </em>CPL 410.70 [3]). While it is true that some of the 13-year-old victim\u2019s testimony was inconsistent with her prior written statement and her testimony was contradicted by that of defendant\u2019s wife, we need note only that County Court\u2019s determination resolving witness credibility must be accorded \u201cgreat weight\u201d <em>(People v Barber, </em>280 AD2d 691, 694 [2001], <em>lv denied </em>96 NY2d 825 [2001]). Deferring to County Court\u2019s credibility determination, the evidence amply supports its finding of defendant\u2019s violation of probation. We have considered defendant\u2019s remaining argument concerning the purportedly harsh and excessive nature of his sentence and find it equally unavailing.</p>\n<p id=\"b921-6\">Mercure, J.P, Carpinello, Lahtinen and Kane, JJ., concur. Ordered that the judgment is affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
