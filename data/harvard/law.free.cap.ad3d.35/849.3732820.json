By decision and order on motion dated July 12, 2006, enforcement of the order dated May 5, 2006 was stayed pending hearing and determination of the appeal.</p>\n<p data-order=\"3\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b872-4\">Ordered that the order is reversed, on the law, with costs, the oral application is denied, and the fine is vacated.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<p id=\"b872-5\">Pursuant to Judiciary Law \u00a7 756, a contempt application must be in writing, must be made upon at least 10 days\u2019 notice, and must contain on its face the statutory warning that \u201cfailure to appear in court may result in . . . immediate arrest and imprisonment for contempt of court\u201d (Judiciary Law \u00a7 756). Since the defendant\u2019s oral application failed to comply with any of these procedural safeguards, the Supreme Court erred when it punished the plaintiff for contempt for failing to comply with its prior order <em>(see Matter of Angel Marie L., </em>8 AD3d 669 [2004]; <em>Matter of P&amp;N Tiffany Props. v Williams, </em>302 AD2d 466 [2003]; <em>Cappello v Cappello, </em>274 AD2d 538 [2000]).</p>\n<p id=\"b872-6\">Furthermore, under the circumstances of this case, that branch of the defendant\u2019s oral application which was to strike the complaint based upon the plaintiffs failure to comply with court-ordered discovery should have been denied in the absence of notice and an opportunity to be heard <em>(see Postel v New York Univ. Hosp., </em>262 AD2d 40, 42 [1999]). Miller, J.P., Krausman, Spolzino, Fisher and Dillon, JJ., concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
