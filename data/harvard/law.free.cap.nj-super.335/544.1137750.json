We conclude that a defendant who has raised issues during a pretrial motion to suppress sufficient to establish a colorable basis for a claim of selective enforcement, when considered in the light of the April 1999 <em>Interim Report of the State Police Review Team Regarding Racial Profiling Allegations </em>(hereinafter <em>\u201cInterim Report </em>\u201d), and then been convicted and sentenced, may assert a claim of selective enforcement in violation of the Federal or State <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"546\">*546</page-number>Constitutions while his direct appeal is pending.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> <em>See United States v. Armstrong, </em>517 <em>U.S. </em>456, 465, 116 <em>S.Ct. </em>1480, 1487, 134 L.Ed.2d 687, 699 (1996); <em>State v. Moore, </em>164 <em>N.J. </em>557, 753 A.2d 1151 (2000); <em>State v. </em>Ballard, <em>331 N.J.Super. </em>529, 539-43, 752 A.2d 735 (App.Div.2000); <em>State v. Smith, </em>306 <em>N.J.Super. </em>370, 376-78, 703 A.2d 954 (App.Div.1997); <em>State v. Kennedy, </em>247 <em>N.J.Super. </em>21, 25, 588 A.2d 834 (App.Div.1991). We also rule that since this case was still subject to direct appeal at the time defendant raised his claim of selective enforcement, the claimed infringements on his constitutional rights, if proven, were clearly capable of producing an unjust result and may be asserted as constituting the equivalent of \u201cplain error.\u201d <em>See R. </em>2:10-2.</p>\n<p id=\"b578-5\">Pursuant to leave granted, the State appeals from a discovery order entered in the Law Division on December 21, 1999 on the motion of defendant, Louis W. Williamson, for a new trial made while his direct appeal was still pending, based on a claim of newly-discovered evidence to support his claim of \u201cracial profiling\u201d or selective enforcement.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b578-6\">Defendant was a passenger in an automobile stopped for speeding on the New Jersey Turnpike on March 28, 1996 by Troopers Layton and Caffrey. All three occupants of the vehicle were African-American. As requested by Trooper Layton, the driver <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"547\">*547</page-number>produced his credentials, which were valid. Trooper Layton directed the driver to exit the vehicle and noticed that the driver appeared very fidgety and very nervous. When questioned, the driver advised Trooper Layton they were coming from New York where they were visiting friends. After questioning the driver, Trooper Layton proceeded to the passenger side of the vehicle, where the door was open and another passenger was outside the vehicle being questioned by Trooper Caffrey. Trooper Layton then looked inside the vehicle, where defendant was seated, and questioned defendant. Defendant advised Trooper Layton they were coming from either Delaware or Washington, D.C., visiting the other passenger\u2019s sick aunt and were heading back to North Carolina, information that was inconsistent with that provided by the driver.</p>\n<p id=\"b579-6\">When questioning defendant, Trooper Layton noticed a very large bulge in the crotch area of defendant\u2019s pants. Defendant was removed from the vehicle and a pat-down search of defendant for weapons disclosed a substantial quantity of a controlled dangerous substance. Defendant was arrested, charged, and indicted.</p>\n<p id=\"b579-7\">Prior to trial, and after a suppression hearing on March 27,1997 during which only Trooper Layton testified, defendant\u2019s motion to suppress was denied. Following a jury trial, defendant was convicted, on February 10, 1998, of first-degree possession of cocaine with intent to distribute, contrary to <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:35-5b(l), and third-degree possession of cocaine, contrary to <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:35-10a(l). On January 15,1999, the State\u2019s motion for imposition of an extended term pursuant to <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:43-6f was denied and defendant was sentenced to a fifteen-year term of imprisonment with a five-year period of parole ineligibility.</p>\n<p id=\"b579-8\">On January 29, 1999, the State filed a notice of appeal from denial of its motion for imposition of an extended term. On January 26, 2000, defendant\u2019s motion to file a notice of appeal <em>nunc pro tunc </em>was granted and defendant cross-appealed from his conviction and the sentence imposed.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b580-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"548\">*548</page-number>In April 1999, the <em>Interim Report </em>was released. On May 20, 1999, while the direct appeal was pending before us, defendant filed a <em>pro se </em>motion, pursuant to <em>R. </em>3:20-1, seeking a new trial contending the <em>Interim Report </em>constituted new evidence of selective enforcement based on racial profiling. The Office of Public \u25a0 Defender was appointed to represent defendant. On August 31, 1999, defendant filed a motion in aid of litigant\u2019s rights seeking certain internal records of the state police to support his claim for a new trial based on his allegation of selective enforcement. On December 10, 1999, Judge Friedman heard defendant\u2019s motion and granted most of the discovery sought. An order memorializing the court\u2019s decision was entered on December 21, 1999.</p>\n<p id=\"b580-5\">On December 21, 1999, the State moved before the trial court for a stay pending determination of its motion for leave to appeal. On January 3, 2000, the State filed a motion before this court seeking leave to appeal from the December 21, 1999 discovery order. On January 21, 2000, the trial court denied the State\u2019s motion for a stay. The State then moved to amend its motion for leave to appeal to include an appeal from the trial court\u2019s order denying a stay. On February 3, 2000, we granted the State\u2019s motion to amend its motion for leave to appeal, and granted a stay pending disposition of the State\u2019s motion for leave to appeal, which we reserved pending disposition of the consolidated appeals in <em>State v. Ballard, </em>331 <em>N.J.Super. </em>529, 752 A.2d 735 (App.Div.2000).</p>\n<p id=\"b580-6\">On June 6, 2000, we entered an order granting the State\u2019s motion for leave to appeal from entry of the December 21, 1999 discovery order to consider the State\u2019s argument that defendant waived his right to assert a claim of selective enforcement by his failure to properly and timely raise such a claim in his pre-trial motion to suppress.</p>\n<p id=\"b581-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"549\">*549</page-number>At the pre-trial suppression hearing, Trooper Layton testified his actions were the result of a feeling that \u201csomething [was] just not ... right.\u201d When Trooper Layton was asked by defense counsel whether race played any role in his decision-making, the following colloquy ensued:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b581-6\">Q. [Your suspicion that something was not right] [h]ad nothing to do with the fact that there were three African American individuals in a rental van; did it?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b581-7\">A. What? I don\u2019t understand the question.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b581-8\">Q. The fact that you were suspicious?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b581-9\">A. No, sir, not at all.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b581-10\">Q. Just the fact that they were nervous \u2014 or excuse me \u2014 the driver was nervous? A. At that point, correct.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b581-11\">Q. Just so the record is clear, all three individuals in the van were African-Americans; weren\u2019t they?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b581-12\">A. Yes, sir, they were.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b581-13\">In summation, defendant\u2019s counsel argued, in pertinent part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b581-14\">What we have here is three African-Americans late at night on the New Jersey Turnpike speeding. And without addressing whether they were really speeding or not, we have two troopers in a vehicle pacing them. The one trooper who testified here today testified that he couldn\u2019t see anybody but the driver. Pulled the driver over for speeding. Got the driver out of the vehicle for the purpose of producing credentials, and in the process of all this, the other trooper, who we haven\u2019t heard from, gets out and makes some inquiries.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b581-15\">The trooper who initially approached the driver notices a bulge in the pants of a passenger who\u2019s lying across the back seat of this minivan, and really, Judge, I don\u2019t see much more than that in terms of the totality of the circumstances, and it\u2019s really a question of whether that is enough to warrant herding the passengers out of the van and patting them down.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b581-16\">The trial court denied the motion to suppress, finding that Trooper Layton, having observed a large bulge in the crotch area of defendant\u2019s pants and fearing for his safety, was justified in conducting a pat-down search for weapons.</p>\n<p id=\"b581-17\">In granting the December 21, 1999 discovery order, Judge Friedman stated, in pertinent part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b581-18\">Following the imposition of sentence, the State of New Jersey, the Attorney General\u2019s Office issued on April 20,1999 what is referred to as the Interim Report about allegations of racial profiling on the turnpike. And ... admitted in that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"550\">*550</page-number>report that racial profiling does occur, although they say it is limited to a few renegade troopers, that it is not the policy of the State Police to have that.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b582-5\">With the admission by the Attorney General\u2019s Office that racial profiling is a fact, together with the decision of ... <em>[State v. Soto, </em>324 <em>N.J.Super. </em>66, 734 A.2d 350 (Law Div.1996)] ... [where] Judge Francis found that on the facts of his case ... there was colorable evidence of a <em>de facto </em>policy ..., not just a practice or procedure, of racial profiling; that is, of treating African Americans differently than other people, both in what they were stopped for, how they were stopped, how they were questioned, how they were searched, how they were requested for consent searches, how drug-sniffing dogs were brought to the scene.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b582-6\">Taking Judge Francis\u2019 findings in [State <em>v. Soto </em>], together with the admissions of the Attorney General\u2019s Office that had studied the problem in its Interim Report of April 20,1999, there is from that alone a colorable claim of selective enforcement and selective prosecution based, in part at least, on race which meets the criteria of [State <em>v. Kennedy, </em>247 <em>N.J.Super. </em>21, 588 A.2d 834 (App.Div.1991)], the landmark and seminal case on the subject, for the defendant to be entitled to discovery to find out exactly what the scope of this is.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b582-7\">Mr. Williamson is in State Prison because of these matters which he questions into, and immediately upon the publication of the Interim Report and the distribution of it, within less than 30 days, he made this application attaching some information about the acknowledgment of racial profiling by the Attorney General\u2019s Office.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b582-8\">The State argues that when defendant failed to assert a claim of racial profiling or selective enforcement in a pre-trial motion, he waived any right to further argue its merits, pursuant to <em>R. </em>3:10-2(c), which provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b582-9\">(c) <em>Defenses and Objections Which Must be Raised Before Trial </em>The defense of double jeopardy and all other defenses and objections based on defects in the institution of the prosecution or in the indictment or accusation, except as otherwise provided by <em>R. </em>3:10-2(d) (defenses which may be raised only before or after trial) and <em>R. </em>3:10-2(e) (lack of jurisdiction), must be raised by motion before trial. Failure to so present any such defense constitutes a waiver thereof, but the court for good cause shown may grant relief from the waiver.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b582-10\">We view the defense-preclusion rule outlined in <em>R. </em>3:10-2(c) as being applicable to \u201cdefenses and objections based on defects in the institution of the prosecution or in the indictment or accusation,\u201d namely, to \u201cselective prosecution\u201d claims. The claim asserted by defendant is grounded in \u201cselective enforcement,\u201d not \u201cselective prosecution.\u201d Moreover, even if <em>R. </em>3:10-2(c) was applicable to defendant\u2019s claim, the possible violation, by police officers, of constitutional rights encompassed in the Fourteenth Amend<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"551\">*551</page-number>ment of the federal constitution and in the New Jersey Constitution, <em>N.J. Const. </em>Art. I \u00a7 7, would certainly constitute \u201cgood cause ... [to] grant relief from the waiver[,]\u201d <em>R. </em>3:10-2(c), and would be considered \u201cone \u2018of sufficient public concern.\u2019 \u201d <em>Alan J. Cornblatt, P.A. v. Barow, </em>153 <em>N.J. </em>218, 230, 708 A.2d 401 (1998) (citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b583-6\">We conclude defendant did not waive his right to assert a claim of selective enforcement while his direct appeal was still pending even though such a claim was not explicitly asserted in a pre-trial motion. While we are satisfied there were sufficient inferences of selective enforcement raised at the suppression hearing, when considered in the light of the <em>Interim Report, </em>to permit defendant to raise the selective enforcement issue, in the form of a motion for a new trial, while his direct appeal was pending, there is yet another basis to permit defendant to assert this claim. Because the case was still subject to direct appeal, we conclude defendant was permitted to assert a claim of selective enforcement founded on racial profiling on the basis of \u201cplain error,\u201d since infringement of constitutional rights, if established, was clearly capable of producing an unjust result. <em>See R. </em>2:10-2.</p>\n<p id=\"b583-7\">We are in substantial agreement with the reason articulated by Judge Friedman for entry of a discovery order in his oral opinion delivered on December 10, 1999. However, on January 21, 2000, the Supreme Court issued an Administrative Order that provides, in pertinent part, that \u201cJudge Walter R. Barisonek of Union County, Law Division, is hereby designated as the sole judge to whom all motions for discovery raised in racial profiling by the New Jersey State Police shall be directed; ...\u201d Accordingly, we affirm the conclusion of Judge Friedman that discovery is warranted and, in accordance with the Administrative Order, remand the order of discovery to Judge Barisonek to reconsider the scope of discovery, in advance of consideration of defendant\u2019s motion. Upon completion of discovery, the Law Division, Burlington County, shall decide the merits of defendant\u2019s motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b583-8\">Affirmed and remanded. We do not retain jurisdiction.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b578-7\"> In <em>State v. Ross, </em>335 <em>N.J.Super. </em>536, 763 A.2d 281 (App.Div.2000), decided today, we ruled that a racial profiling or selective enforcement challenge to a warrantless search of a motor vehicle is preserved for direct appeal when racial profiling was not directly urged as a ground for suppression at the trial level. In <em>State v. Velez, </em>335 <em>N.J.Super. </em>552, 763 A.2d 290 (App.Div.2000), also decided today, we ruled that a defendant can raise a claim of racial profiling or selective enforcement for the first time on direct appeal after entry of a guilty plea after denial of his motion to suppress at least when, as there, the <em>Interim Report </em>was published after the judgment of conviction. We also concluded that entry of a guilty plea does not constitute a waiver of a profiling or selective enforcement claim if such claims were raised or are related to a claim asserted at the motion to suppress.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b578-8\"> The terms \u201cracial profiling\" and \u201cselective enforcement,\" in the context of this case, are synonymous and used interchangeably.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b579-9\"> In a separate opinion, also filed today. <em>State v.
