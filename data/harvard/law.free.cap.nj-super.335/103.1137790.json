Moore is serving his sentence at Southern State Correctional Facility <em>(SSCF) </em>in Delmont, a prison operated by the Department of Corrections (DOC). After his minimum custody status was revoked by the Institutional Classification Committee (ICC) for failure to participate in a substance abuse program, Moore filed an appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b137-9\">Moore challenges the reallocation of his minimum custody status on various grounds. He argues that (1) his rights were violated under the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) and the New Jersey Law Against Discrimination (LAD); (2) his due process rights were violated because he was denied a fair hearing; and (3) the ICC\u2019s determination was arbitrary and unreasonable.</p>\n<p id=\"b137-10\">The ICC of each correctional facility is responsible for, among other things, \u201c[r]eviewing the applications of inmates for changes in custody status.\u201d <em>N.J.A.C. </em>10A:9-3.1(a)3.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The ICC is also responsible for \u201c[m]onitoring the progress of inmates by scheduling periodic reviews to ensure that rehabilitative efforts are being maximized.\u201d <em>N.J.A.C. </em>10A:9-3.1(a)2. The DOC\u2019s substance abuse <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"106\">*106</page-number>treatment program is one of the rehabilitative efforts monitored by the ICC.</p>\n<p id=\"b138-4\">An inmate qualifies for a \u201ctherapeutic community program\u201d if, among other things, the inmate has an \u201caddiction severity index\u201d (ASI) of five or above, in which case the inmate is \u201cconsidered to be chronically addicted and in need of intensive substance abuse treatment.\u201d The ASI is \u201ca clinical diagnostic and research instrument which rates an offender\u2019s addiction level.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b138-5\">Moore received an ASI score of seven and was assigned on November 10, 1998, to the Persons Incarcerated Entering Recovery (PIER) program, a therapeutic community at SSCF. On November 18, 1998, his custody level status was reduced from medium to full minimum custody. On November 20, 1998, Moore refused to begin treatment, contrary to the clinical staffs opinion that additional treatment was required. Moore claims that he withdrew from the PIER program after being examined by a prison psychologist, Dr. Frankel, whose psychological report opined that the PIER program was too stressful for Moore due to his HIV status. Moore also asserted that, as a result of his deteriorating health, he had to resume use of medication prescribed for stress.</p>\n<p id=\"b138-6\">An inmate who declines an assignment to a treatment program is not subject to disciplinary action, but shall \u201c[n]ot be eligible for minimum custody or if already in gang or full minimum custody shall lose the custody status via the Objective Classification scoring instrument\u2019s T override.\u201d If the ICC determines that an inmate should be discharged from a therapeutic committee for an administrative reason <em>(e.g., </em>medical reasons), \u201cit shall reassign the inmate pursuant to <em>N.J.A.C. </em>10A:9-3.3, Classification Process,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> without viewing the discharge in a negative light.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b139-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"107\">*107</page-number>The ICC revoked Moore\u2019s full minimum custody status through an \u201cI\u201d override, due to his refusal to begin treatment, and reverted his custody status to medium. Moore sought leave to appeal out of time and we granted leave to file <em>nunc pro tunc. </em>Moore filed a \u201cnotice of motion in lieu of subpoena for an in-camera inspection of confidential psychiatric records\u201d of prison psychologist Dr. Frankel, arguing that he was denied the records for confidentiality reasons. The DOC asserted that the ICC never considered such a report because Moore\u2019s classification file did not contain such a report. We granted the DOC\u2019s cross-motion for a remand so Moore could be evaluated by a psychologist and the report considered by the ICC in determining his custody status.</p>\n<p id=\"b139-6\">On November 23, 1999, Dr. Frankel examined Moore and prepared a confidential psychological report in which he concluded that Moore \u201cis not a good candidate for the PIER program at SSCF due to the emotional and stress factors that he is struggling with.\u201d The ICC reconsidered whether Moore\u2019s custody status was appropriately reverted to medium and issued a \u201cK\u201d override, concluding that Moore\u2019s custody status should remain medium <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"108\">*108</page-number>based upon Dr. Frankel\u2019s report. Thereafter, the appeal was reactivated.</p>\n<p id=\"b140-4\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b140-5\">Moore argues that his custody status was improperly reverted to medium despite his claimed adverse health effects or the fact that he is HIV positive. He contends his rights under the ADA (42 <em>U.S.C.A. </em>\u00a7\u00a7 12101 to 12213) and LAD <em>(N.J.S.A. </em>10:5-4 and 4.1) were violated. Included within the LAD definition of handicapped is \u201csuffering from AIDS or HIV infection.\u201d <em>N.J.S.A </em>10:5 \u2014 5q. The LAD claim is raised for the first time on appeal and, thus, is without merit. <em>See N.J.S.A </em>10:5-13.</p>\n<p id=\"b140-6\">Moore alleges he filed a written complaint with the ADA Coordinator within thirty days of the alleged violation (see <em>N.J AC. </em>10A:l-3.3). Further, Moore asserts that the ADA received his complaint on December 17, 1998, although the record does not contain such letter or indication of receipt. Moore\u2019s appendix to his brief has a copy of an unsigned and unstamped letter. Assuming such a complaint was sent as asserted, there is no indication that Moore made any attempt to contact the ADA Coordinator within the two years since the ADA allegedly received it, to determine the status of the complaint. Moreover, there is no law which supports the proposition that the ADA applies or was intended to apply to custody status determinations. We decline to hold that the ADA applies to such determinations.</p>\n<p id=\"b140-7\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b140-8\">Moore also argues that he did not receive a fair hearing because the ICC did not allow him to present exceptions or to argue that he did not \u201crefuse treatment.\u201d Administrative due process is generally satisfied if \u201cthe parties had adequate notice, a chance to know opposing evidence, and the opportunity to present evidence and argument in response____\u201d <em>In re Dep\u2019t of Ins.\u2019s Order Nos. A89-119 &amp; A90-125, </em>129 <em>N.J. </em>365, 382, 609 A.2d 1236 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"109\">*109</page-number>(1992). In <em>Sandin v. Conner, </em>515 <em>U.S. </em>472, 484, 115 <em>S.Ct. </em>2293, 132 <em>L.Ed.2d 418 </em>(1995), the Supreme Court held that a change in a prisoner\u2019s conditions of confinement does not trigger the need for due process safeguards unless the change imposes \u201catypical and significant hardship on the inmate in relation to the ordinary incidents of prison life.\u201d We have followed <em>Sandin </em>in situations involving a change of custody status. <em>Muhammad v. Balicki </em>327 <em>N.J.Super. </em>369, 372, 743 A.2d 376 (App.Div.2000). <em>See also Blyther v. New Jersey Dep\u2019t of Corrections, 322 N.J.Super. </em>56, 730 A.2d 396 (App.Div.), <em>certif. denied, </em>162 <em>N.J. </em>196, 743 A.2d 848 (1999) (under <em>Sandin, </em>inmate does not have a liberty interest in remaining in general prison population nor does administrative assignment of gang leaders to the non-punitive Security Threat Group Management Unit program impose atypical and significant hardship on inmate in relation to ordinary incidents of prison life); <em>Lorusso v. Pinchak, </em>305 <em>N.J.Super. </em>117, 701 A.2d 974 (App.Div. 1997) (there is no liberty interest in prison job assignments to support prisoner\u2019s claim of due process violation); <em>White v. Fauver, </em>219 <em>N.J.Super </em>170, 530 A.2d 37 (App.Div.1987) (finding no constitutionally protected liberty interest in reduced custody status). \u201cA reduction in custody status is a privilege and not a right.\u201d <em>N.J.A.C. </em>10A:9-4.2.</p>\n<p id=\"b141-6\">In <em>Muhammad, supra, </em>327 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 371, 743 A.2d 376, the prisoner was placed on \u201creduced custody status,\u201d which we acknowledged \u201cenables a prisoner to enjoy more mobility and less supervision in the prison than the general prison population.\u201d However, under an amendment of the regulation at issue, Muhammad did not receive reduced custody status in 1999. We observed that, \u201c[wjhile the \u2018atypical and significant hardship\u2019 standard of <em>Sandin </em>may be difficult to define [citation omitted], it is clear to us that the loss of enjoyment of greater mobility than that accorded to the general prison population [and] less supervision ... do not fall within that standard____\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 372-373, 743 A.2d 376.</p>\n<p id=\"b141-7\">Here, the change in Moore\u2019s custody status did not trigger due process safeguards. The change did not impose \u201catypical and significant hardship <em>on </em>the inmate in relation to the ordinary <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"110\">*110</page-number>incidents of prison life.\u201d <em>Muhammad, supra, </em>327 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 372, 743 A.2d 376. There is no constitutionally protected interest in reduced custody status.</p>\n<p id=\"b142-4\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b142-5\">Moore also claims that the ICC arbitrarily decided to punish him for his inability to participate in the PIER program. It is well-established that an appellate court will not disturb the ultimate determination of an agency unless it was arbitrary, capricious or unreasonable or it was not supported by substantial credible evidence in the record as a whole. <em>Campbell v. Dep\u2019t of Civil Serv., </em>39 <em>N.J. </em>556, 562, 189 A.2d 712 (1963). <em>See also Brady v. Board of Review, </em>152 <em>N.J. </em>197, 210, 704 A.2d 547 (1997) (\u201cThe judicial capacity to review administrative agency decisions is limited.\u201d). The test is essentially one of rational basis. <em>Worthington v. Fauver, </em>88 <em>N.J. </em>183, 204, 440 A.2d 1128 (1982).</p>\n<p id=\"b142-6\">There is substantial credible evidence in the record to support the ICC\u2019s decision to revert Moore\u2019s custody status to medium. <em>See N.J.AC. </em>10A:9-3.3(a) and <em>N.J.AC. </em>10A:9-4.5(a). Although Moore argues that the ICC\u2019s decision was unreasonable because his objective classification scoring result was a negative two, <em>N.J.AC. </em>10A:3-4.5(a) provides that the objective classification score is one of several different factors that the ICC \u201cmay\u201d consider. The objective classification score is not, in and of itself, determinative of an inmate\u2019s custody status. Thus, in light of all the factors taken into consideration, the ICC\u2019s issuance of a \u201cK\u201d override was neither arbitrary nor unreasonable.</p>\n<p id=\"b142-7\">Affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b137-11\"> There are six categories of custody status within the DOC, two of which are relevant for purposes of this appeal:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b137-12\">\"Medium custody\" \u2014 inmates are assigned lo \"activities inside the security perimeter of the correctional facility under frequent and direct observation of staff.\" <em>NJ.A.C. </em>10A:9-4.3(c).</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b137-14\">\"Full minimum custody\" \u2014 inmates are assigned to \"[w]ork details, jobs or programs outside the main correctional facility, (on or olf the grounds of the facility) with minimal supervision; and/or [a] satellite unit of minimum security trailer unit.\" <em>NJ.A.C. </em>10A:9-4.3(e).</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b138-7\"> The ICC's reassignment of the inmate\u2019s classification status is based upon a consideration of factors listed in <em>N.J.A.C. </em>10A:3-3.3(a):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b138-8\">1.
