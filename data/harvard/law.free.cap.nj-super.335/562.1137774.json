In 1993, Congress amended the Gun Control Act of 1968,18 <em>U.S.C.A. </em>\u00a7\u00a7 921-928, by enacting the Brady Handgun Violence Prevention Act (\u201cBrady Act\u201d), <em>Pub.L. </em>103-159, 107 <em>Stat. </em>1536 (1993), which is codified in various sections of the Gun Control Act. The Brady Act provisions at issue in this appeal are codified as a note following 18 <em>U.S.C.A. </em>\u00a7 922, entitled \u201cnational instant criminal background check system.\u201d (\u201cNICS\u201d)</p>\n<p id=\"b599-8\">A key provision bearing on this appeal reads:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b599-9\">(b) Establishment of system. Not later than 60 months after the date of the enactment of this Act, the Attorney General shall establish a national instant criminal background cheek system that any licensee may contact, by telephone or by other electronic means in addition to the telephone, for information, to be supplied immediately, on whether receipt of a firearm by a prospective transferee would violate section 922 of title 18, United States Code, or State law.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b599-10\">[18 <em>U.S.C.A </em>\u00a7 922 Note.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b599-11\">Effective November 30, 1998, the end of the sixty-month deadline specified in the Brady Act, the Federal Bureau of Investigation (\u201cFBI\u201d) promulgated regulations implementing the NICS. 63 <em>Fed.Reg. </em>58303. The regulations are codified at 28 <em>C.F.R. </em>\u00a7 25.1 to 25.11.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b600-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"568\">*568</page-number>The regulations create a system for background checks of prospective gun purchasers (transferees) by a federal firearms licensee, defined as a person licensed by the federal Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, and Firearms (\u201cATF\u201d) as a manufacturer, dealer, or importer of firearms. 28 <em>C.F.R. </em>\u00a7 25.2. The licensee may seek such a background check from either the FBI through the FBI NICS Operations Center or, if the state has designated a Point of Contact for the handling of background checks, from a Point of Contact within the state. 28 <em>C.F.R. </em>\u00a7 25.6. Each state retains the option of choosing which alternative should govern background checks in that state. 28 <em>C.F.R. </em>\u00a7 25.6(a). A \u201cPoint of Contact\u201d or \u201cPOC\u201d is defined as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b600-4\">POC (Point of Contact) means a state or local law enforcement agency serving as an intermediary between an FFL and the federal databases checked by the NICS. A POC will receive NICS background check requests from FFLs, check state or local record systems, perform NICS inquiries, determine whether matching records provide information demonstrating that an individual is disqualified from possessing a firearm under Federal or state law, and respond to FFLs with the results of a NICS background check. <em>A POC mil be an agency with express or implied authority to perform POC duties pursuant to state statute, regulation, or executive order.</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b600-5\">[28 <em>C.F.R. </em>\u00a7 25.2. (emphasis added).]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b600-6\">In allowing each state to choose to process background checks either through its own Point of Contact or through the FBI\u2019s NICS Operations Center, the FBI perceived that its regulations would avoid the federalism objections that doomed the interim system in <em>Printz, supra, </em>footnote 1, as the FBI explained in its comments to the final version of the regulations. 63 <em>FedLReg. </em>58304-05.</p>\n<p id=\"b600-7\">New Jersey has chosen the Point of Contact mechanism, under which a request for a background check is processed as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b600-8\">(d) Access to the NICS through POCs. In states where a POC is designated to process background checks for the NICS, FFLs [federal firearms licensees] will contact the POC to initiate a NICS background check. Both ATF and the POC will notify FFLs in the POC\u2019s state of the means by which FFLs can contact the POC. The NICS will provide POCs with electronic access to the system virtually 24 hours each day through the NCIC [National Crime Information Center] communication network. Upon receiving a request for a background check from an FFL, a POC will:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b601-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"569\">*569</page-number>(1) Verify the eligibility of the FFL either by verification of the FFL number or an alternative POC-verification system;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b601-6\">(2) Enter a purpose code indicating that the query of the system is for the purpose of performing a NICS background check in connection with the transfer of a firearm; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b601-7\">(3) Transmit the request for a background check via the NCIC interface to the NICS.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b601-8\">(e) Upon receiving a request for a NICS background cheek, POCs may also conduct a search of available files in state and local law enforcement and other relevant record systems, and may provide a unique State Assigned Transaction Number (STN) to a valid inquiry for a background check.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b601-9\">(f) When the NICS receives an inquiry from a POC, it will search the relevant databases (i.e., NICS Index, NCIC, III) for any matching record(s) and will provide an electronic response to the POC____</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b601-11\">[28 <em>C.F.R. </em>\u00a7 25.6(d), (e), &amp; (f).]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b601-12\">Depending on the NICS response, the Point of Contact will give the requesting licensee one of three responses: \u201cProceed,\u201d \u201cDelayed,\u201d or \u201cDenied.\u201d 28 <em>C.F.R. </em>\u00a7 25.6(g)(2); 28 <em>C.F.R. </em>\u00a7 25.6(i).</p>\n<p id=\"b601-13\">The operating hours for NICS are 9:00 a.m. to 2:00 a.m., seven days per week. 28 <em>C.F.R. </em>\u00a7 25.2 (definition of \u201cNICS Operations Center\u2019s regular business hours\u201d). But NICS is available twenty-four hours per day for \u201ctoll-free electronic dial-up access.\u201d 28 <em>C.F.R. </em>\u00a7 25.6(b).</p>\n<p id=\"b601-14\">In an October 6, 1998, letter to FBI Director Louis J. Freeh, Governor Whitman designated the State Police as New Jersey\u2019s Point of Contact. This followed a September 21, 1998, memorandum to Governor Whitman\u2019s chief of staff, in which then-Attorney General Peter Verniero recommended that New Jersey choose the Point of Contact option and that the State Police be designated as this State\u2019s Point of Contact.</p>\n<p id=\"b601-15\">On September 30, 1998, the FBI issued guidelines to the states setting forth standards for Points of Contact and \u201crequirements\u201d and \u201crecommendations\u201d for implementing the Point of Contact system. The guidelines indicate that a Point of Contact must be available for background checks seven days per week, except for Thanksgiving and Christmas, and that a Point of Contact\u2019s operational hours \u201cshall be, as a minimum, 10:00 a.m. to 9:00 p.m. Monday through Saturday; and, normal retail business hours <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"570\">*570</page-number>within the state on Sundays.\u201d Also, the guidelines state that \u201c[t]he FBI will not charge Point of Contact states a fee for accessing the NICS.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b602-5\">The State Police issued Operational Procedures in October 1998 for the processing of NICS background checks through the State Police in its role as a Point of Contact. The procedures declare that the State Police\u2019s NICS service will be available by telephone on weekdays, except on state holidays, between 9:00 a.m. and 8:00 p.m. and on Saturdays between 10:00 a.m. and 5:00 p.m. These procedures do not provide for telephone service on Sundays as provided in the FBI Guidelines. Fax service is available every day for twenty-four hours. A $15 charge is made for each telephone or FAX request.</p>\n<p id=\"b602-6\">The State Police also adopted a User Agreement, which firearms licensees are required to sign in acknowledgment of having received the Operational Procedures.</p>\n<p id=\"b602-7\">On October 28, 1998, the State Police superintendent sent letters to state firearms licensees notifying them of the Point of Contact system and enclosing an instruction package and a User Agreement for their signatures.</p>\n<p id=\"b602-8\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b602-9\">On November 18,1998, appellants filed a timely appeal from the Governor\u2019s designation of the State Police as the Point of Contact in New Jersey. The notice of appeal named then-Attorney General Verniero and then-State Police Superintendent Williams as respondents. Appellants are Bullet Hole, Inc., a firearms dealership in Belleville, and Peter Hefferan, allegedly a \u201cprospective\u201d firearms purchaser. Each has filed a sworn or certified explanation alleging how each will be harmed by the $15 fee and the above hours of operation of New Jersey\u2019s Point of Contact.</p>\n<p id=\"b602-10\">In his November 11,1998 affidavit, Hefferan argued that he was planning to buy several handguns and a rifle in December 1998 and that because of his hours of work, he normally bought <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"571\">*571</page-number>firearms at night or on Sundays, times during which NICS access would not be available once the State Police procedures are in place. As a result, he asserts, it will be \u201cextremely difficult, if not impossible\u201d for him to purchase firearms. The $15 fee for NICS access through the State Police, he also claims, is unreasonable, was adopted without due process, and is \u201coutrageous.\u201d He asserts that he \u201cwill be immediately and irreparably injured if the State Police are allowed to be the New Jersey NICS Point of Contact under the rules promulgated by the State Police in November 1998.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b603-6\">In his undated certification, the owner of Bullet Hole asserted that: Bullet Hole was open from 9:00 a.m. to 9:30 p.m. during the week, from 9:00 a.m. to 5:00 p.m. on Saturdays, and from 12:00 p.m. to 5:00 p.m. on Sundays; that Bullet Hole was planning to expand its facility, which would increase its business \u201cfive fold\u201d; that the POC system and procedures adopted by the State Police would restrict Bullet Hole\u2019s hours and thereby prevent this expansion and eliminate 40% of Bullet Hole\u2019s business; and that Bullet Hole\u2019s consignment-sales business would be impaired by the $15 charge, as prospective sellers will go to out-of-state dealers. Bullet Hole contends that \u201c[mjany of the Bullet Hole, Inc. customers are blue collar workers who work in shifts. Often, the only time these individuals have to shop for firearms and related equipment is on Sundays. Additionally many of the Bullet Hole, Inc. customers shop in the later evening hours after work and having dinner with their families. The loss of these prospective customers -will cause the Bullet Hole, Inc. to suffer immediate and irreparable harm.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b603-7\">In December 1998, we denied appellants\u2019 motion to stay the State Police\u2019s procedures. In March 1999 appellants amended their notice of appeal to include Governor Whitman as a respondent.</p>\n<p id=\"b603-8\">Ill</p>\n<p id=\"b603-9\">We first address the appealability of the Governor\u2019s designation. Respondents do not contest its appealability. <em>R. </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"572\">*572</page-number>2:2-3(a)(2) does not expressly authorize appeals from such actions by a Governor, but in our view the rule encompasses those actions under the rubric of \u201cactions of any state administrative agency or officer,\u201d inasmuch as the Governor is indisputably the State\u2019s chief executive or \u201cadministrative officer.\u201d <em>Cf. New Jersey Builders Ass\u2019n v. Byrne, </em>80 <em>N.J. </em>469, 471, 404 A.2d 32 (1979) (accepting without discussion an appeal from a Governor\u2019s executive order); <em>Dalton v. Kean, </em>213 <em>N.J.Super. </em>572, 574, 517 A.2d 1224 (App.Div. 1986), <em>certif. denied, </em>107 <em>N.J. </em>110, 526 A.2d 181 (1987) (accepting without discussion an appeal from a Governor\u2019s Reorganization Plan dismantling the Department of Energy). We conclude that the Governor\u2019s designation was appealable and that we have jurisdiction.</p>\n<p id=\"b604-5\">IV</p>\n<p id=\"b604-6\">Appellants contend that New Jersey\u2019s adoption and implementation of the Point of Contact system for processing Brady Act background checks violate the separation-of-powers clause of the State Constitution. They assert that (1) the Governor encroached on the legislative sphere when she purported to regulate firearms by designating a state agency as a Point of Contact and by allocating state resources for that purpose; and (2) the Attorney General and State Police promulgated Point of Contact \u201cregulations\u201d without any enabling state legislation.</p>\n<p id=\"b604-7\">The authority of the Governor of New Jersey derives from Article V of the State Constitution. \u201cThe executive power shall be vested in a Governor.\u201d <em>N.J. Const, </em>art. V, \u00a7 1,111. The Governor supervises each executive department and its head, including the Attorney General. <em>N.J. Const, </em>art. V, \u00a7 4, K 2. The Governor is responsible for enforcing the laws of the State:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b604-8\">The Governor shall take care that the laws be faithfully executed. To this end he shall have power, by appropriate action or proceeding in the courts brought in the name of the State, to enforce compliance with any constitutional or legislative mandate, or to restrain violation of any constitutional or legislative power or duty, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"573\">*573</page-number>by any officer, department or agency of the State; but this power shall not be construed to authorize any action or proceeding against the Legislature.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b605-6\">[IV./. <em>Const, </em>art. V, \u00a7 1,1111.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b605-7\">The framers of the 1947 Constitution intended to create a \u201cstrong executive.\u201d <em>Kenny v. Byrne, </em>144 <em>N.J.Super. </em>243, 251, 365 A.2d 211 (App.Div.1976), <em>aff'd o.b., </em>75 <em>N.J. </em>458, 383 A.2d 428 (1978). One commentator has concluded that \u201c[t]he Governor of New Jersey is, at least functionally, the most powerful Chief State Executive in the nation.\u201d Jack M. Sabatino, <em>Assertion and Self Restraint: The Exercise of Governmental Powers Distributed Under the 19JJ New Jersey Constitution, </em>29 <em>Rutgers L.J. </em>799, 825 (1998). Thus the \u201cterse comprehensive\u201d grant of power in the Constitution \u201cmust be given life and meaning by investing him with the authority to implement his responsibilities.\u201d <em>Kenny, supra, </em>144 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 251, 365 A.2d 211.</p>\n<p id=\"b605-8\">The Constitution has also reserved powers for the Legislature, for example, the power to appropriate money from the state treasury. <em>N.J. Const, </em>art. VIII, \u00a7 2, If 2; <em>Communications Workers of America v. Florio, </em>130 <em>N.J. </em>439, 451, 617 A.2d 223 (1992).</p>\n<p id=\"b605-9\">Neither the Governor nor the Legislature may encroach on the powers of the other because:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b605-10\">The powers of the government shall be divided among three distinct branches, the legislative, executive, and judicial. No person or persons belonging to or constituting one branch shall exercise any of the powers properly belonging to either of the others, except as expressly provided in this Constitution.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b605-11\"><em>[N.J. Const, </em>art. Ill, 111.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b605-12\">The separation of powers prevents any one branch from aggregating unchecked power, which might lead to oppression and despotism. <em>Worthington v. Fauver, </em>88 <em>N.J. </em>183, 206, 440 A.2d 1128 (1982). Nonetheless, it is not to be applied in such a way as \u201cto restrict the legitimate operation of representative democracy.\u201d <em>Ibid. </em>The Supreme Court has cautioned against treating the branches as watertight compartments. <em>State v. Loftin, </em>157 <em>N.J. </em>253, 284, 724 A.2d 129, <em>cert. denied, </em>528 <em>US. </em>897, 120 <em>S.Ct. </em>229, 145 <em>L.Ed.2A </em>193 (1999); <em>In re Salaries for Probation Officers of Bergen County, </em>58 <em>N.J. </em>422, 425, 278 A.2d 417 (1971). Rather, the doctrine should be flexibly interpreted to encourage a \u201ccooperative accommodation among the three branches,\u201d <em>Communications </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"574\">*574</page-number><em>Workers, supra, </em>130 <em>N.J. </em>at 449, 617 A.2d 223, and their powers should be viewed as being \u201ccomplementary.\u201d <em>Knight v. Margate, </em>86 <em>N.J. </em>374, 389, 431 A.2d 833 (1981). Only when the challenged action impairs \u201cthe essential integrity\u201d of another branch will a court step in to enforce the constitutional boundaries. <em>Cupano v. Gluck, </em>133 <em>N.J. 225, </em>233, 627 A.2d 624 (1993) (quoting <em>Massett Building Co. v. Bennett, </em>4 <em>N.J. </em>53, 57, 71 A.2d 327 (1950)). <em>See also, </em>Sabatino, <em>supra, </em>29 <em>Rutgers L.J. </em>at 822-23.</p>\n<p id=\"b606-5\">Appellants in this case have cited no New Jersey case, and we have found none, in which a court has overturned a Governor\u2019s action as violating the constitutional separation between the executive and legislative branches. Appellants insist that we should do so here, because \u201cfirearms regulation is the exclusive responsibility of the Legislature\u201d pointing to the Legislature\u2019s enactment of the gun-possession provisions of the criminal code <em>(N.J.S.A. </em>2C:39-1 to -16) and of the firearms-licensing law <em>(N.J.S.A. </em>2C:58-1 to -18). They further invoke the Supreme Court\u2019s comment that \u201cthe subject of gun control is a comprehensive one that is almost invariably resolved on the basis of legislative intention.\u201d <em>In re Preis, </em>118 <em>N.J </em>564, 574, 573 A.2d 148 (1990).</p>\n<p id=\"b606-6\">Not only may the Governor not take any action to regulate guns, appellants continue, but in addition she may not commit funds to that effort, which they submit would infringe on the Legislature\u2019s exclusive power to appropriate money. This contention is based on an assumed premise: \u201cIt is assumed that in addition to the $15.00 fee for access to the New Jersey POC [Point of Contact], additional state monies are financing the overhead for the operation of the POC.\u201d But there is nothing in the record concerning the added costs, if any, of the Point of Contact system.</p>\n<p id=\"b606-7\">Respondents do not dispute that the regulation of gun sales lies squarely within the \u201clegislative power,\u201d <em>N.J. Const, </em>art. IV, \u00a7 1, 111. It does not follow, however, that the Governor may take no action in that area. Indeed, the Governor is required, by virtue of her duty to execute the laws, to take many kinds of actions to enforce legislation, whether by delegating enforcement duties to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"575\">*575</page-number>the Attorney General, by issuing executive orders, or by exercising whatever powers are reasonably implied and necessary to fulfill her constitutional duties. <em>Worthington v. Fauver, </em>180 <em>N.J.Super. </em>368, 375-76, 434 A.2d 1134 (App.Div.1981), <em>aff'd, </em>88 <em>N.J. </em>183, 440 A.2d 1128 (1982); <em>Kenny, supra, </em>144 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 250-52, 365 A.2d 211.</p>\n<p id=\"b607-6\">When, as here, the Governor purports to be acting consistently with express or implied authority from the Legislature, she \u201cexercises not only [her] own powers but those delegated by the legislature.\u201d <em>Worthington, supra, </em>180 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 376, 434 A.2d 1134. Her action should be \u201csupported by the strongest of presumptions and the widest latitude of judicial interpretation, and the burden of persuasion would rest heavily upon any who might attack it.\u201d <em>Ibid, </em>(quoting <em>Youngstown Sheet &amp; Tube Co. v. Sawyer, </em>343 <em>U.S. </em>579, 637, 72 <em>S.Ct. </em>863, 871, 96 <em>L.Ed. </em>1153, 1200 (1952)).</p>\n<p id=\"b607-7\">Among the laws the Governor has the duty to enforce is a provision of the act governing the State Police, <em>N.J.S.A. </em>53:1\u2014 20.6(a):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b607-8\">The Superintendent of State Police, with the approval of the Attorney General, shall, pursuant to the \u201cAdministrative Procedure Act,\u201d P.L.1968, e. 410 (C. 52:14B-1 et seq.), adopt rules and regulations authorizing the dissemination, by the State Bureau of Identification, of criminal history record background information requested by State, county and local government agencies, including the Division of State Police, in noneriminal matters, or requested by individuals, nongovernmental entities or other governmental entities whose access to such criminal history record background information is not prohibited by law. A fee not to exceed $25 shall be imposed for processing fingerprint identification checks; a fee not to exceed $15 shall be imposed for processing criminal history name search identification cheeks. These fees shall be in addition to any other fees required by law. In addition to any fee specified herein, a nonrefundable fee, the amount of which shall be determined by the Superintendent of State Police, with the approval of the Attorney General, shall be collected to cover the cost of securing and processing a federal criminal records check for each applicant.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b607-9\">As authorized by this section, the State Police have adopted regulations governing criminal background cheeks for non-criminal matters, such as hiring and licensing. <em>N.J.AC. </em>13:59-1.1 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"576\">*576</page-number>to -1.6.

They submit that the Governor\u2019s designation of the State Police as the Point of Contact for Brady Act purposes \u201cis fully consistent with <em>N.J.S.A </em>53:l-20.6(a) and with the regulations promulgated under this statute.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b608-8\">Though not cited by respondent, another section of the State Police law, while .not directly addressed to background checks, evidences the Legislature\u2019s intention that the State Police cooperate with the FBI and other law enforcement agencies:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b608-9\">The supervisor of the state bureau of identification shall cooperate with the bureaus in other states and with the bureau in the department of justice of the United States and shall develop and carry on an interstate, national and international system of identification within the requirements of the state bureau of identification.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b608-10\"><em>[N.J.S.A. </em>53:1-19.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b608-11\">A further source cited by respondents for the Governor\u2019s authority to designate the State Police as the Point of Contact is the firearms-licensing statute, <em>N.J.S.A </em>2C:58-1 to -18. Throughout <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"577\">*577</page-number>that statute the Legislature invested the superintendent of the State Police with the authority to administer the system for registering dealers and processing permits to purchase and carry guns. <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:58-1 to -4.</p>\n<p id=\"b609-6\">In his September 21, 1998, memorandum recommending that the State Police be designated as a Point of Contact, then-Attorney General Verniero referred to the goal of fostering New Jersey\u2019s own gun laws:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b609-7\">If New Jersey does not participate, there is the potential for individuals who have been disqualified and prohibited from purchasing firearms in New Jersey to go undetected, thereby circumventing our New Jersey firearm laws. This situation will occur because the FBI does not have access to all of the various State systems available to the State Police such as Administrative Office of the Courts Domestic Violence Central Registry Protection Order File, State Police Firearms Denied Person File, all New Jersey Non Felony Convictions, and all Pending Arrests. Designation of the State Police as the point of contact for the federally required NICS check will enhance the ability of the State to enforce its firearm laws by identifying individuals who may have become disqualified from purchasing firearms subsequent to the issuance of a firearm purchaser identification card or permit to purchase a handgun.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b609-8\">Governor Whitman cited that purpose in her designation letter: \u201cThis participation will enable New Jersey to support this federal initiative while also enhancing our ability to enforce existing State Firearm laws more effectively.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b609-9\">Governor Whitman\u2019s Point of Contact designation letter is similar to an executive order, a well-accepted tool of gubernatorial action notwithstanding the absence of any express constitutional authority for such a tool. And the Brady Act\u2019s invitation to the states to designate a Point of Contact arguably is similar to federal statutory authorizations of executive orders, which also have gone unchallenged. For example, many executive orders from New Jersey Governors have been authorized by federal law, either by requiring a state to act or by allowing discretionary action. Michael S. Herman, <em>Gubernatorial Executive Orders, </em>30 <em>Rutgers L.J. </em>987, 1004 (1999). In the latter circumstance (authorizations of discretionary action), \u201cthe authorizing federal law does <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"578\">*578</page-number>not really remove power from the state, but merely enables the states to take advantage of a program if they wish.\u201d <em>Ibid</em><footnotemark><em>2</em></footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b610-4\">We are satisfied that the Governor\u2019s Point of Contact designation was an appropriate exercise of the authority and powers of her office and did not violate the Legislature\u2019s \u201cessential integrity.\u201d Indeed, those actions complemented, and did not contradict, the Legislature\u2019s existing authorization of background checks for gun purchasers and of the State Police\u2019s role in that process.</p>\n<p id=\"b610-5\">V</p>\n<p id=\"b610-6\">In addition to their separation-of-powers challenge to the Governor\u2019s designation and the State Police\u2019s procedures, appellants contend in the alternative that two of the State Police\u2019s Operational Procedures qualified as \u201crules\u201d that were subject to the notice and hearing requirements of the Administrative Procedure Act.</p>\n<p id=\"b610-7\">The Operational Procedures set forth detailed mechanisms for Brady Act background checks via the State Police as Point of Contact. Because appellants specifically protest just two of the procedures, we limit our consideration of appellants\u2019 objections to those two: (1) the $15 fee for each request, and (2) the hours during which dealers may call for background checks (9:00 a.m. to 8:00 p.m. on weekdays, 10:00 a.m. to 5:00 p.m. on Saturdays, and not at all on state holidays or on Sundays).</p>\n<p id=\"b611-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"579\">*579</page-number>It is undisputed that the State Police is an \u201cagency\u201d to which the Administrative Procedure Act applies. <em>N.J.S.A. </em>52:14B-2. Hence, the State Police may not adopt \u201crules\u201d without first satisfying the notice and hearing steps of the Administrative Procedure Act, <em>see State v. Garthe, </em>145 <em>N.J. </em>1, 7, 678 A.2d 153 (1996). We thus must determine whether the two challenged Operational Procedures indeed are \u201crules,\u201d or instead are some lesser or other kind of agency action to which the Administrative Procedure Act rulemaking process does not apply.</p>\n<p id=\"b611-6\">The governing provision of Administrative Procedure Act is <em>N.J.S.A. </em>52:14B-2(e):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b611-7\">(e) \u201cAdministrative rule\u201d or \u201crule,\u201d when not otherwise modified, means each agency statement of general applicability and continuing effect that implements or interprets law or policy, or describes the organization, procedure or practice requirements of any agency. The term includes the amendment or repeal of any rule, but does not include: (1) statements concerning the internal management or discipline of any agency; (2) intra agency and interagency statements; and (3) agency decisions and findings in contested cases.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b611-8\">The standards for determining whether an agency decision or other activity is governed by the rulemaking strictures were articulated in <em>Metromedia, Inc. v. Director, Div. of Taxation, </em>97 <em>N.J. </em>313, 478 A.2d 742 (1984). An agency\u2019s action may be classified as a \u201crule\u201d</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b611-9\">if it appears that the agency determination, in many or most of the following circumstances, (1) is intended to have wide coverage encompassing a large segment of the regulated or general public, rather than an individual or a narrow select group; (2) is intended to be applied generally and uniformly to all similarly situated persons; (3) is designed to operate only in future cases, that is, prospectively; (4) prescribes a legal standard or directive that is not otherwise expressly provided by or clearly and obviously inferable from the enabling statutory authorization; (5) reflects an administrative policy that (i) was not previously expressed in any official and explicit agency determination, abdication or rule, or (ii) constitutes a material and significant change from a clear, past agency position on the identical subject matter; and (6) reflects a decision on administrative regulatory policy in the nature of the interpretation of law or general policy.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b611-10\"><em>Ud. </em>at 331-32, 478 A.2d 742.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b611-11\">The Court in <em>Metromedia </em>propounded this six-part test as a way to decide whether the action there at issue was a \u201crule\u201d or an \u201cadjudication,\u201d the latter being exempt from rulemaking by <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"580\">*580</page-number>virtue of <em>N.J.S.A. </em>52:14B-2(e)(3). But the Court has acknowledged that the test may appropriately be used to decide whether any kind of agency action (e.g., orders^ guidelines, directives) must be accompanied by formal rulemaking. <em>Doe v. Poritz, </em>142 <em>N.J. </em>1, 97, 662 A.2d 367 (1995); <em>Woodland Private Study Group v. State, </em>109 <em>N.J. </em>62, 67-68, 533 A.2d 387 (1987). Moreover, \u201cnot all of these factors need be present in order for agency action to constitute a rule. Rather, the various factors can be balanced even if some are present and others are not.\u201d <em>Woodland, supra, </em>109 <em>N.J. </em>at 66, 533 A.2d 387.</p>\n<p id=\"b612-5\">The two protested provisions appear in the \u201cFORWARD [sic]\u201d to the Operational Procedures, which in their complete context read as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b612-6\"><em>The NICS vnll be available telephonically weekdays from 9:00 am. to 8:00 p.m. and, Saturday from 10:00 a.m. to 5:00 p.m. (except state holidays). </em>In the future, the NICS Center reserves the right to expand the hours of telephonic coverage based upon operational experiences. A facsimile service will be available twenty four (24) hours a day, seven (7) days a week. <em>A charge of $15 will be incurred for each telephone transaction or facsimile. </em>Only one transaction per telephone call or facsimile will be permitted. <em>The NICS will not accept batched telephone calls or facsimiles [emphasis in original]. </em>A typical telephonic NICS transaction will take two (2) to three (3) minutes. Facsimile requests will be answered within three (3) business days (exclusive of the day on which the inquiry was made).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b612-7\">Appellants contend that these two clauses meet four of the <em>Metromedia </em>criteria and thus must be treated as \u201crules.\u201d First, they claim, the clauses govern \u201ca large segment of the regulated or general public, rather than an individual or a narrow select group\u201d (the first <em>Metromedia </em>factor). Appellants assert:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b612-8\">Certainly, anyone subject to regulations regarding the transfer of firearms in the State of New Jersey will be effected [sic] by the above described action of the Division of State Police and/or the Attorney General. All SFLs [State Firearms Licensees] in New Jersey will have had their potential hours of operation curtailed by the above described directive of the Division. Likewise, the Division of State Police\u2019s and/or Attorney General\u2019s above described actions will effect [sic] all prospective firearms transferees by limiting the time when they may purchase firearms and by imposing an additional $15 fee for access to the NICS.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b612-9\">Second, the two provisions, appellants argue, are \u201cintended to be applied generally and uniformly to all similarly situated persons\u201d (the second <em>Metromedia factor). </em>Thus, they point out, all licensed <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"581\">*581</page-number>sellers must contact NICS through the State Police, and every prospective purchaser must pay the $15 fee before the purchase can be approved.</p>\n<p id=\"b613-6\">Third, appellants contend that the two restrictions prescribe a legal standard or directive that is not otherwise expressed in or inferable from the enabling statutory authorization (the fourth <em>Metromedia </em>factor). They argue:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b613-7\">In fact, the restriction of the SFL\u2019s hours of operation and imposition of a $15 fee for access to NICS has no authority express or otherwise, under <em>N.J.S.A </em>2C:58-1, <em>et seq. </em>On the contrary, <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:58-3f expressly states that there shall be no additions or requirements required by the licensing authority for the issuance of a permit or identification card, other than those specifically set forth in that chapter. It was the express intent of the Legislature when setting up its \u201ccareful grid\u201d of regulatory provisions regarding New Jersey gun control laws that only the Legislature is to have the power to regulate the licensing and purchase of firearms.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b613-8\">Fourth and last, appellants maintain that the two clauses reflect an \u201cadministrative policy ... not previously expressed in any official and explicit agency determination, adjudication or rule\u201d (part of the fifth <em>Metromedia </em>factor). They reason that before these procedures were adopted, the State Police \u201cfollowed only those rules set forth\u201d in the firearms-licensing statute and State Police law, and that the Operational Procedures represent \u201cthe first time that the Governor, Division and/or Attorney General has attempted to supplement the \u2018careful grid\u2019 of regulatory provisions found in <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:58-1, <em>et seq., </em>absent expressed legislative authority to do so.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b613-9\">Based on these principles, we conclude that the Administrative Procedure Act was not violated by the implementation of the $15 fee, but that it was violated by the adoption of the New Jersey Point of Contact operating hours.</p>\n<p id=\"b613-10\">-A-</p>\n<p id=\"b613-11\">With respect to the $15 fee, respondents counter that the fee was authorized by a preexisting statute and regulation, and hence need not have been formally promulgated again under the Administrative Procedure Act. They cite the section of the State Police <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"582\">*582</page-number>statute that authorizes the State Police to charge $15 \u201cfor processing criminal history name search identification checks.\u201d <em>N.J.S.A. </em>53:l-20.6(a). And they note that a regulation implementing that statute had already been adopted: <em>N.J.AC. </em>13:59 \u2014 1.3(b) (\u201cA fee of $15 shall be collected by the [State Bureau of Investigation] for the purpose of processing criminal history name search identification checks\u201d). Thus, respondents reason, \u201cthe Division of State Police has already promulgated the rule which appellants demand\u201d (Rb27).</p>\n<p id=\"b614-4\">Appellants assert, however, that the fee allowed by <em>N.J.AC. </em>13:59-1.3(b) is not for the same kind of information sought by Brady Act requests. While the latter regulation concerns a fee for \u201ccriminal history name search\u201d data, a Brady Act search does not result in disclosure of that sort of data. Appellants state,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AS3o\">[W]hen a retailer contacts the POC, no criminal history name search information is disseminated.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b614-5\">When accessing the POC, the retailer never receives any information beyond one of three possible responses: \u201capproved,\u201d \u201cdenied,\u201d or \u201cpending.\u201d The retailer is not apprised of the prospective transferee\u2019s criminal history; therefore, the statute and code provisions regarding criminal history \u201cdissemination\u201d do not apply to situations when a retailer contacts the POC for approval of a sale.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b614-6\">\u201cCriminal history name search\u201d is not defined in the fee regulation, <em>N.J.AC. </em>13:59-1.3(b), or anywhere else in the regulations governing State Bureau of Investigation background checks. The kind of information accessed seems to be essentially the same as in a Brady Act NICS check, although the information given back in response, a simple \u201capproved-denied-pending,\u201d is much less comprehensive in the case of NICS searches. Thus, <em>N.J.AC. </em>13:59-1.1. describes the pertinent data (\u201ccriminal history record information\u201d) as \u201cconsisting of identifiable descriptions and notations of arrests, indictments, or other formal criminal charges, and any dispositions arising therefrom, including convictions, dismissals, acquittals, sentencing, correctional supervision and release.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b614-7\">We conclude that, assuming that the imposition of the fee is a \u201crule,\u201d no rulemaking procedures were necessary under the Administrative Procedure Act because the existing regulation \u201cfor <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"583\">*583</page-number>the purpose of processing criminal history name search identification checks,\u201d <em>N.J.A.C. </em>13:59 \u2014 1.3(b), is sufficiently broad to encompass authority to charge the same fee for NICS checks. We acknowledge that the purpose of the search, as well as the information received, are not identical in the case of an NICS search and a search under <em>N.J.S.A. </em>53:l-20.6(a). But they are sufficiently similar that the authority under <em>N.J.A.C. </em>13:59-1.3(b) should be deemed to encompass both. No useful purpose would be served in compelling the State Police to adopt a separate rule for the $15 NICS fee, assuming a rule were required, when a $15 charge is already authorized by the existing regulation for a similar purpose.</p>\n<p id=\"b615-6\">In the alternative, if the existing regulation does not authorize the $15 fee for NICS searches, we also consider whether the $15 NICS search fee is, without more, to be considered as a \u201crule,\u201d subject to the rulemaking procedures of the Administrative Procedure Act. Counsel have not referred us to, nor has our own research disclosed, any cases in which the charging of a fee has been held to constitute a rule, as to which the agency is required by the Administrative Procedure Act to engage in rulemaking in order for the fees and hours to be effective.</p>\n<p id=\"b615-7\">We note that many characteristics that might typically be associated with administrative rules are not present in the case of the $15 fee. Thus, the fee does not proscribe conduct by members of the public generally or by members of a specific group being regulated,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> nor does it prescribe conduct.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b616-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"584\">*584</page-number>The fee does not direct the taking of actions or proceedings by the agency,* **<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> nor does it have the purpose of describing or implementing substantive agency policy.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> The fee likewise does not embody a detailed set of procedures or eligibility requirements.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b616-5\">Manifestly, as well, the specifics concerning the fee are not inordinately difficult for the public to discover, even if not published in the New Jersey Administrative Code, and are probably well known to every retail firearms seller in New Jersey. To be sure, some administrative details respecting fees have been promulgated at least occasionally in the New Jersey Administrative Code,<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> but that does not answer the inquiry as to whether the adoption of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"585\">*585</page-number>the particular fee presented on this appeal constitutes rulemaking. Furthermore, the fee, without more, does not seem to us to be a \u201crale\u201d as the term is employed in <em>N.J.S.A. </em>52:14B-3, which reads:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b617-6\">In addition to other rule-making requirements imposed by law, each agency shall: (1) adopt as a rule a description of its organization, stating the general course and method of its operations and the methods whereby the public may obtain information or make submissions or requests....</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b617-7\">In the absence of more direct or specific authority, the <em>Metromedia </em>factors outlined above and the Supreme Court cases that have considered them are the best available decisional guideposts. We are satisfied that the first and second <em>Metromedia </em>factors are present. We reject the contention by appellants that <em>Metromedia </em>factors four, prescribing legal standards or directives not otherwise expressed in or inferable from the enabling statutory authorization, and five, an \u201cadministrative policy ... not previously expressed in any official and explicit agency determination, adjudication or rale,\u201d are germane in the present analysis when the issue is whether implementation of the $15 fee, without more, constitutes an exercise in rulemaking within the meaning of the Administrative Procedure Act.</p>\n<p id=\"b617-8\">Among the cases that have applied <em>Metromedia </em>is <em>Doe v. Poritz, supra, </em>142 <em>N.J. </em>at 96-99, 662 A.2d 367, where the Supreme Court concluded that the Attorney General\u2019s \u201cGuidelines\u201d for community notification under Megan\u2019s Law, <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:7-1, <em>et seq., </em>were not administrative rales within the meaning of the Administrative Procedure Act. The Court noted with respect to <em>Metromedia:</em></p>\n<blockquote id=\"b617-9\">Although in <em>Metromedia </em>we were concerned about the distinction between rule-making and adjudication, the factors are relevant whenever the authority of an agency to act without conforming to the formal rulemaking requirements is questioned. <em>Woodland Private Study Group, supra, </em>109 <em>N.J. </em>at 67, 533 A2d 387. The factors need not be given the same weight, and some factors will clearly be more relevant in a given situation than others: \u201cAll six of the <em>Metromedia </em>factors need not be present to characterize agency action as rulemaking, and the factors should not merely be tabulated, but weighed.\u201d <em>In re Solid Waste Util Customer Lists, supra, </em>106 <em>N.J. </em>[508] at 518, 524 A.2d 386.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b617-10\">[142 <em>N.J. </em>1, at 97, 662 A.2d 367.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b617-11\">In determining that the Guidelines\u2019s promulgation did not constitute administrative rale-making, the Court relied in part on the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"586\">*586</page-number>these circumstances: \u201c... the Guidelines were prepared in response to a specific statutory mandate and their contents are largely dictated either explicitly or implicitly by the language of the statute.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 98-99, 662 A.2d 367. This was in contrast with the facts presented in <em>Metromedia, supra, </em>where \u201cthe determination was not otherwise expressly provided for by the statute, nor was it clearly and obviously implied.\u201d 97 <em>N.J. </em>at 330, 478 A.2d 742.</p>\n<p id=\"b618-5\">In <em>State v. Garthe, supra, </em>145 <em>N.J. </em>1, 678 A.2d 153, the Supreme Court held that the action of the State Police in setting forth procedures to test breathalyzer machines did not constitute rule-making to which the requirements of the Administrative Procedure Act applied. The Court observed,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b618-6\">Obviously, not every action of a State agency, including informal action, is subject to the formal notice and comment requirements of <em>N.J.S.A. </em>52:14B-4. In making this qualitative determination, we have generally considered: (1) the segment of the public to be affected by the administrative action; (2) the generality of application of the agency action; (3) the prospeetiveness of the result; and (4) the novelty of any legal standard announced. <em>George Harms Constr. Co. v. New Jersey Turnpike Auth., </em>137 <em>N.J. </em>8, 18, 644 A.2d 76 (1994).</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b618-7\">[145 <em>N.J. </em>1, at 7, 678 A.2d 153.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b618-8\">Moreover, as the Court stated in <em>Metromedia, </em>\u201c... when the agency action is concerned with \u201cbroad policy issues\u201d that affect a large segment of the regulated or general public, rule-making as such is implicated.\u201d <em>Metromedia, supra, </em>97 <em>N.J. </em>at 330, 478 A.2d 742.</p>\n<p id=\"b618-9\">We thus conclude, in the alternative, that the $15 fee is not a \u201crule\u201d under the <em>Metromedia </em>test. As has been shown, it does not bear the characteristics of many administrative rules. The fee does not prescribe conduct or standards on the part of the public or the State Police. It neither implements nor embodies substantive policy. In addition, for persons who wish to engage in transactions respecting expensive merchandise, it is not a manifestly prohibitive charge, or one that would have the clear effect of limiting their participation in those activities. Moreover, the institution or non-institution of the fee requirement for NICS checks is not a matter of such public moment that the formal <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"587\">*587</page-number>procedures of the rulemaking process are necessary in order to protect citizens from arbitrary or uninformed agency action.</p>\n<p id=\"b619-6\">Accordingly, there is no merit to appellants\u2019 objection to the $15 fee for NICS searches, for each of the alternative reasons we have expressed.</p>\n<p id=\"b619-7\">-B-</p>\n<p id=\"b619-8\">Our conclusion with respect to the Point of Contact operating hours is different, for we are persuaded, in the particular circumstances this appeal presents, that their adoption constituted the adoption of a \u201crule\u201d within the meaning of <em>N.J.S.A. </em>52:14B-2(e), the relevant section of the Administrative Procedure Act, quoted above.</p>\n<p id=\"b619-9\">In our view, the mere adoption by an agency of hours of operation to serve the public does not in and of itself necessarily constitute rulemaking, for many of the same reasons the $15 fee does not. In the context of the particular facts presented by this appeal, however, the actual State Police Point of Contact operating hours that have been adopted can and should be distinguished. In at least two significant post <em>-Metromedia </em>decisions that considered what did or did not constitute rulemaking by an agency, the Supreme Court gave weight to the similarity of the administrative action in question to an authorizing statute or other authorizing source. Thus, in <em>Doe v. Poritz, supra, </em>142 <em>N.J. </em>at 97-98, 662 A.2d 367, with respect to the conformity of the Attorney General\u2019s Megan\u2019s Law community notification Guidelines to the statutory source, the Supreme Court stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b619-10\">The Guidelines are to a great extent merely a formalization of the classification requirements explicitly set forth in the statute. To the extent that the classification criteria, or any other requirements of the Guidelines, deviate substantially from the explicit or implied standards of the statute, those aspects of the Guidelines are subject to judicial review, <em>see, e.g., A.A. Mastrangelo, Inc. v. Department of Envtl. Protection, </em>90 <em>N.J. </em>666, 449 A.2d 516 (1982), as well as review by the Legislature, <em>N.J. Const, </em>art. V, \u00a7 4,116. We have, in this opinion, required revisions to the Guidelines which would tailor them more closely to the statutory language. <em>See supra </em>at 34-38. Therefore, the fourth factor, and the one we believe to be the most important of the six <em>Metromedia </em>factors in this instance, is not satisfied.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b620-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"588\">*588</page-number>And in <em>State v. Garthe, supra, </em>145 <em>N.J. </em>at 7, 678 A.2d 153, the Supreme Court stated with respect to the State Police breathalyzer test procedures:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b620-5\">Nor do we view those test procedures as setting forth \u201ca legal standard or directive that is not otherwise expressly provided by or clearly and obviously inferable from the enabling statutory authorization.\u201d <em>Metromedia, </em>supra, 97 <em>N.J. </em>at 331, 478 A.2d 742. The legal standards and directives for testing breathalyzers stem from this Court\u2019s decision in <em>Romano v. Kimmelman, supra </em>[96 <em>N.J. </em>66, 79-80, 474 A.2d 1 (1984)], that the machine must be in \u201cproper working order\u201d at the time of the test. 96 <em>N.J. </em>at 82, 474 A.2d 1. We are informed that the test procedures were derived from the manufacturer\u2019s recommendations. A number of prior decisions had referred to the standards and procedures used to test breathalyzer machines. <em>E.g., State v. Maure, </em>240 <em>N.J.Super. </em>269, 573 A.2d 186 (App.Div.1990), <em>aff'd, </em>123 <em>N.J. </em>457, 588 A.2d 383 (1991); <em>State v. Stinger, </em>281 <em>N.J.Super. </em>538, 658 A.2d 1299 (App.Div.1995).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b620-6\">By contrast to <em>Doe v. Poritz </em>and <em>Garthe, </em>the State Police Point of Contact operating hours differ significantly from the hours set forth in the originating or source measure, namely, the FBI guidelines. Appellants assert that by virtue of the State Police not allowing as much Point of Contact access as the FBI guidelines (Sunday hours, hours on most state holidays, and longer hours on other days), the rights of the gun-buying public are severely curtailed. We do not now determine that the New Jersey Point of Contact hours must be identical to the hours recommended by the FBI. Nevertheless, we are satisfied that the departure from the FBI-recommended standard strongly implicates the intent if not the literal language of <em>Metromedia </em>factors four and five (\u201c(4) prescribes a legal standard or directive that is not otherwise expressly provided by or clearly and obviously inferable from enabling statutory authorization; (5) reflects administrative policy that (i) was not previously expressed in official and explicit agency determination, adjudication or rule ...\u201d) and that the members of the public have a legitimate interest is being able to state their objections to or support for those hours through the means of the Administrative Procedure Act\u2019s rulemaking process. Accordingly, <em>Metromedia </em>factors one, two, four, and five are present, and in the circumstances of this appeal it is evident that the hours of operation for the Point of Contact services in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"589\">*589</page-number>New Jersey should have been considered in a formal rulemaking proceeding.</p>\n<p id=\"b621-5\">Given the deviation of the New Jersey Point of Contact hours from the FBI guidelines, we find no merit in respondents\u2019 suggestion that the hours-of-operation provision is not an Administrative Procedure Act \u201crule\u201d because operating hours concern \u201cthe internal management\u201d of an agency and thus are statutorily exempt. <em>N.J.S.A. </em>52:14B-2(e)(l) (exempting \u201cstatements concerning the internal management or discipline of any agency\u201d). Respondents argue that an agency should not have \u201cto promulgate a rule whenever it wishes to offer hours of operation above and beyond the normal 40-hour workweek.\u201d Such a mandate, they say, would impair the State Police\u2019s ability to \u201crespond to changing law-enforcement conditions.\u201d We are satisfied, however, that the hours of Point of Contact accessibility do not concern \u201cinternal management.\u201d Rather, they represent the Point of Contact\u2019s interface with the public, and they meet the Administrative Procedure Act\u2019s definition of a \u201crule,\u201d in that it is an \u201cagency statement of general applicability and continuing effect that implements\u201d law, namely, the Brady Act, as administered by the designated administrative authority in this State.</p>\n<p id=\"b621-6\">We are mindful of the need to maintain flexibility and responsiveness in the policies and actions of administrative agencies, including the State Police, and we do not reach our conclusions out of a blind desire to impose an inflexible reign of red tape and restrictive procedures to the detriment of that need. But the hours of operations involved here have an impact beyond the internal workings of the State Police. They have a clear effect on the public and represent a significant departure from the hours of operation recommended by the FBI.</p>\n<p id=\"b621-7\">As stated, we do not now rule that the State Police must adopt the same hours as those recommended by the FBI, nor do we hold that the State Police are free to reject those hours. All we determine in this opinion about the Point of Contact operating hours is that the State Police should forthwith institute rulemak<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"590\">*590</page-number>ing proceedings in accordance with the Administrative Procedure Act to adopt appropriate hours for Brady Act NICS checks. In order to avoid sudden disruption respecting those operations we stay the operation of this portion of our order and determination for a period of 120 days.</p>\n<p id=\"b622-4\">VI</p>\n<p id=\"b622-5\">To summarize, we conclude that the Governor had the constitutional power to designate the State Police as New Jersey\u2019s Point of Contact for Brady Act background checks, and appellants\u2019 appeal with respect thereto is without merit. We further conclude that the institution of the $15 fee for NICS checks did not constitute the adoption of a \u201crule\u201d without conformity to the procedures of the Administrative Procedure Act, and appellants\u2019 appeal with respect thereto is likewise rejected. We conclude, however, that the State Police\u2019s Point of Contact operating hours should have been the subject of the Administrative Procedure Act\u2019s rulemaking procedures, and that the present hours are invalid because they were not so adopted.</p>\n<p id=\"b622-6\">Accordingly, appellants\u2019 appeal contesting the Governor\u2019s designation of the State Police as the Point of Contact is denied, as is their appeal contesting the $15 fee. We conclude that the New Jersey Point of Contact operating hours are invalid as being adopted in violation of the Administrative Procedure Act, but as to that aspect of our determination that we stay the effect of this order for 120 days.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b599-12\"> As an interim measure, pending creation by the Attorney General of the United States of the mandated national instant criminal background check system (\"NICS\"), the Brady Act set up a system requiring state officials to administer the act. That interim feature was declared unconstitutional, as violative of sovereignty of the states, in <em>Printz. </em>v. <em>United States, </em>521 <em>U.S. </em>898, 933-35, 117 <em>S.Ct. </em>2365, 2383-84, 138 L.Ed.2d 914, 943-45 (1997). The interim system is not at issue in this appeal, which instead concerns the permanent NICS system.
