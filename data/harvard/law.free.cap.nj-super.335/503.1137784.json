J.C. filed the underlying tort action against the insureds, D.B. and her husband N.B., alleging that N.B. had committed repeated acts of sexual abuse on her infant daughter M.C. The abuse occurred over a period of four years in the insureds\u2019 home. The complaint sought damages from N.B. for his intentional conduct and from D.B. for her negligence in failing to prevent or warn of the harm. In the third-party complaint, D.B. asserted that she was entitled to coverage under the policy issued by Allstate Insurance Company (\u201cAllstate\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b536-12\">The Allstate homeowner\u2019s policy provided coverage for claims against the insureds for bodily injury arising from \u201caccidental loss\u201d and excluded coverage for bodily injury \u201cwhich may reasonably be expected to result from the intentional or criminal acts of an insured person or which are in fact intended by an insured person.\u201d It also imposed \u201cjoint obligations\u201d on the insureds, stating that the \u201cacts ... of an insured person will be binding upon another person defined as an insured person.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b537-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"505\">*505</page-number>The Law Division granted Allstate summary judgment. D.B. appeals, contending that she was wrongly denied coverage. She asserts that the policy is ambiguous and should be construed in her favor. Alternatively, she asserts that if the policy is clear, it should nonetheless be construed to provide coverage to meet her reasonable expectations and that the denial of coverage is against public policy. Since D.B.\u2019s arguments are unsound, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b537-5\">We consider first the provision extending coverage. This policy extended coverage to its insureds for claims of bodily injury arising out of \u201caccidental loss\u201d without defining that phrase. Although the failure to define \u201caccident\u201d may render a coverage provision ambiguous in some circumstances, <em>Property Cas. Co. of MCA v. Conway, </em>147 <em>N.J. </em>322, 326-30, 687 A.2d 729 (1997), there is no ambiguity in the context of this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b537-6\">In <em>Conway, </em>the Court was concerned with a question of insurance coverage with respect to the statutorily imposed vicarious liability of parents for their child\u2019s intentional damage to school property. <em>See N.J.S.A. </em>18A:37-3. The policy provided coverage for an \u201coccurrence,\u201d which it defined as an \u201caccident\u201d without defining the term accident; it excluded coverage for property damage \u201cwhich is expected or intended by the insured,\u201d and it contained a clause entitled \u201cSeverability of Insurance\u201d which stated, \u201c[t]his insurance applies separately to each insured.\u201d 147 <em>N.J. </em>at 325, 687 A.2d 729. The Court, applying the principle that the words of an insurance policy should be given their ordinary and plain meaning, defined an accident as \u201can unintended or unexpected event.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 327, 687 A.2d 729. Given that definition and the cited policy provisions, the Court determined that \u201cMy failing to define \u2018accident\u2019 [the insurance company had] introduced ambiguity into the definition of \u2018occurrence.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>at 326, 687 A.2d 729. The ambiguity arose because the policy \u201cd[id] not state whether the determination that an event is unexpected or unintended should be from the perspective of all those covered under the policy or from that of only the named insured.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 325, 687 A.2d 729. Consequently, the Court held that although <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"506\">*506</page-number>there was no coverage for the child because of the exclusion, there was coverage for the parents because from their perspective the incident was both unintended and unexpected. <em>Id. </em>at 326-30, 687 A.2d 729.</p>\n<p id=\"b538-5\">D.B.\u2019s circumstance is entirely distinguishable from that of the parents in <em>Conway </em>whose liability was vicarious. The cause of action against her was defined by the Court in <em>J.S. v. R.T.H., </em>155 <em>N.J. </em>330, 714 A.2d 924 (1998).</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b538-6\">[W]hen a spouse has actual knowledge or special reason to know of the likelihood of his or her spouse engaging in sexually abusive behavior against a particular person or persons, a spouse has a duty of care to take reasonable steps to prevent or warn of the harm. [A] breach of such duty constitutes a proximate cause of the resultant injury, the sexual abuse of the victim.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b538-7\"><em>[Id. </em>at 352, 714 <em>A.2d </em>924]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b538-8\">Thus, D.B. would only be liable for her own tortious conduct if she knew that the intentional and illegal activity was ongoing, or she had special reason to know that it was likely to occur, and she unreasonably failed to prevent or warn of the harm. Although the bodily injury for which she was being sued may have been unintended from her perspective, in light of the definition of the tort it was not unexpected; consequently, it was not an accident from her perspective and it was outside the coverage extended by the policy. <em>See Allstate Ins. Co. v. Steele, </em>74 <em>F.</em>3d 878, 880 (8th Cir.1996); <em>cf. Jessica M.F. v. Liberty Mut. Fire Ins. Co., </em>209 Wis.2d 42, 561 <em>N.W.2d </em>787, 790-91 (App.1997).</p>\n<p id=\"b538-9\">We consider next the exclusion. The absence of coverage is fortified by the exclusion from coverage of bodily injury \u201cwhich may reasonably be expected to result from intentional or criminal acts of jm insured person or which are in fact intended by an insured person.\u201d (Underlining added). D.B. contends this exclusion is ambiguous from her perspective. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b538-10\"><em>Conway </em>concerned a policy exclusion that referred to property damage \u201c \u2018expected or intended by <em>the </em>insured\u2019 \u201d and provided that the \u201c \u2018insurance applie[d] separately to each insured.\u2019 \u201d 147 <em>N.J. </em>at 325, 687 A.2d 729 (emphasis added). Here, the exclusion speaks of an intentional or criminal act of \u201can insured person.\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"507\">*507</page-number>(Underlining added.) N.B. was <em>\u201can\u201d </em>insured person and he committed acts that were both intentional and criminal. Furthermore, the policy imposes \u201cjoint obligations\u201d rather than providing separate coverage to each insured and expressly stated that the \u201cacts ... of a person defined as an insured person will be binding upon another person defined as an insured person.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b539-6\">In <em>Rena, Inc. v. Brien, </em>310 <em>N.J.Super. </em>304, 708 A.2d 747 (App.Div.1998), the policy insured the tenants and landlord of a building against fire loss. The tenants arranged for the building to be burned so that they could obtain the insurance proceeds. In considering the innocent landlord\u2019s claim under the policy, the court addressed the differing effect of exclusions that refer to acts of \u201cthe insured\u201d and those that refer to acts of \u201can insured.\u201d The court denied coverage to the innocent insured, finding no ambiguity in an insurance policy that excluded coverage for damage resulting from \u201c \u2018any fraudulent, dishonest or criminal act done by or at the instigation of any insured____\u2019\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 309, 708 A.2d 747. As reflected in the opinion, which thoroughly canvasses the relevant cases throughout the United States and the insurance texts, the phrases \u201cany insured\u201d and \u201can insured,\u201d in coverage exclusions have been interpreted almost uniformly, absent contrary statutory authority, as requiring the denial of policy benefits to innocent insureds. <em>Id. </em>at 321-25, 708 A.2d 747. If an unambiguous policy exclusion is enforceable against an innocent party, <em>a fortiori </em>it must be enforceable against an insured whose liability, as here, depends on fault. <em>Cf. id. </em>at 325, 708 A.2d 747.</p>\n<p id=\"b539-9\">In <em>Jessica M.F., </em>the court considered the liability of a spouse in D.B.\u2019s position under two homeowner\u2019s policies. One policy excluded coverage for bodily injury \u201c \u2018which is expected or intended by the insured,\u2019 or \u2018from the standpoint of the insured.\u2019 \u201d The other policy excluded coverage for such injuries \u201c \u2018expected or intended by an insured.\u2019 \u201d Both policies provided that coverage \u201c \u2018applies separately to each insured.\u2019 \u201d 561 N.W.2d at 790, n. 7. The court had no difficulty in finding that neither policy provided coverage. <em>Id. </em>at 791-94. It also rejected the severability-of<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"508\">*508</page-number>interest clause as a basis for coverage because the spouse was not innocent, 561 N.W.2d at 794, a ruling which accords with our Supreme Court\u2019s decision in <em>Conway. Cf. Howell v. Ohio Cas. Ins. Co., </em>130 <em>N.J.Super. </em>350, 355, 327 A.2d 240 (App.Div.1974).</p>\n<p id=\"b540-5\">D.B. also argues that if the language of the policy clearly excludes coverage it should be ignored because it did not meet her reasonable expectations. In <em>Werner Indus., Inc. v. First State Ins. Co., </em>112 <em>N.J. </em>30, 548 A.2d 188 (1988), the Court reiterated that the \u201cfundamental principle of insurance law is to fulfill the objectively reasonable expectations of the parties.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 35, 548 A.2d 188. And the Court also said, \u201c[a]t times, even an unambiguous [insurance] contract has been interpreted contrary to its plain meaning so as to fulfill the reasonable expectations of the insured[.]\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 35-36, 548 A.2d 188. In <em>Jessica M.F., </em>the court rejected the reasonable expectations argument for two reasons: \u201cone who purchases homeowner insurance does not contemplate coverage for sexual misconduct committed by one\u2019s [spouse]; and ... one who purchases homeowner insurance would not want to share that type of risk, (and the increased premiums that would result,) with other homeowner\u2019s policyholders.\u201d 561 N.W.2d at 794. <em>Accord Allstate Ins. Co. v. Steele, </em>74 F.3d at 881.</p>\n<p id=\"b540-6\">D.B.\u2019s last argument is that the exclusion is contrary to public policy and therefore should not be enforced. Since the propriety of exclusions for intentional and criminal acts have been consistently sustained as according with public policy, <em>see, e.g., Princeton Ins. Co. v. Chunmuang, </em>151 <em>N.J. </em>80, 95-97, 698 A.2d 9, (1997) and applied to other insureds when language similar to this policy\u2019s exclusion has been employed, see, <em>e.g., Rena, </em>310 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 321-25, 708 A.2d 747, we perceive no basis for D.B.\u2019s argument that a denial of coverage to her violates public policy.</p>\n<p id=\"b540-7\">Relying on <em>Conway, </em>D.B. also argues that the denial of coverage is against public policy because it decreases the likelihood that the victim will receive compensation. But in <em>Conway, </em>the Court only found that affording insurance protection to the parents of a child who damaged school property would not violate public policy. 147 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"509\">*509</page-number><em>N.J. </em>at 329-30, 687 A.2d 729. It did not hold that a clear exclusion of such coverage would be impermissible.</p>\n<p id=\"b541-5\">In <em>Ambassador Ins. Co. v. Montes, </em>76 <em>N.J. </em>477, 388 A.2d 603 (1978), the Court considered a claim on behalf of a person who was inadvertently killed in an arson fire set by the insured. Ambassador conceded that the policy\u2019s clause extending coverage applied and that the policy contained no exclusion for intentional acts by the insured. Nonetheless, it argued that the Court should deny coverage because \u201cpublic policy prohibits insurance indemnity for the civil consequences of an insured\u2019s intentional wrongdoing.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 482, 388 A.2d 603. The Court rejected Ambassador\u2019s position because that principle \u201cshould not come into play when the wrongdoer is not benefited and an innocent third person receives the protection afforded by the insurance.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 483, 388 A.2d 603. The Court considered that the wrongdoer would not benefit because the insurance company could seek reimbursement from him. <em>Id. </em>at 484-86,388 A.2d 603.</p>\n<p id=\"b541-6\">D.B.\u2019s situation is entirely distinguishable. She is not the victim; she is the insured and a wrongdoer. Moreover, unlike the situation in <em>Ambassador, </em>here the policy excludes coverage for intentional and criminal acts committed by any insured, and there is nothing in <em>Ambassador </em>that casts doubt on the right of an insurance company to exclude all coverage for such acts.</p>\n<p id=\"b541-7\">Furthermore, judicial insistence on insurance coverage for D.B\u2019s tort would be inconsistent with the policies reflected in the Court\u2019s opinion in <em>J.S. </em>The Court recognized that the imposition of liability on a spouse in D.B.\u2019s circumstance would tend to interfere with marital privacy and the insureds\u2019 interest in a stable marital relationship, <em>id. </em>at 345, 714 A.2d 924, but, the Court determined that protecting children from sexual abuse was more important. <em>Id. </em>at 346, 714 A.2d 924. Without insurance coverage, a spouse whose husband or wife is a child abuser is more likely to carry out the duties imposed by <em>J.S. </em>promptly. Insurance would provide such a spouse with an undue incentive to value the stability and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"510\">*510</page-number>privacy of the marriage over the well-being of the child-victim. <em>Jessica M.F., </em>561 N.W.2d at 795-96 (Shudson, Judge concurring).</p>\n<p id=\"b542-5\">Affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
