More specifically, the question now before us is whether an inoperable BB gun used in the commission of a robbery is a deadly weapon as defined by <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:43-7.2d. Although we acknowledge that an inoperable BB gun constitutes a deadly weapon for purposes of elevating a robbery to first-degree status pursuant to <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C: 15-lb and that it constitutes a firearm for purposes of so-called Graves Act mandatory sentencing under <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:43-6e, we <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"488\">*488</page-number>are nevertheless persuaded that it does not constitute a deadly weapon for NERA purposes.</p>\n<p id=\"b520-5\">Pursuant to a plea agreement, defendant pleaded guilty to an accusation charging him with first-degree robbery under <em>N.J.S.A </em>2C:15-1 in that he \u201cknowingly and purposely, in the course of committing a theft threaten[ed] the immediate use of a deadly weapon.\u201d At the plea proceeding, defendant admitted that he had entered a store for the purpose of theft and displayed a BB gun to the person behind the counter from whom he took cash. The prosecutor stipulated that the BB gun was inoperable at the time of the theft.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The State\u2019s undertaking was to recommend a sentence of ten years subject to NERA\u2019s eighty-five percent parole ineligibility period, namely eight and a half years. We further note that in explaining the plea agreement to the court and its NERA component, the prosecutor was under the stated misimpression that because the weapon was inoperable, the crime did not qualify for Graves Act sentencing. In any event, the negotiated NERA sentence was thereafter imposed, and defendant appeals, arguing that the inoperability of the weapon took this crime out of NERA\u2019s ambit.</p>\n<p id=\"b520-6\">Our agreement with defendant\u2019s argument is based on the text of <em>N.J.SA </em>2C:43-7.2d, which provides in full as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b520-7\">For the purposes of this section, \u201cviolent crime\u201d means any crime in which the actor causes death, causes serious bodily injury as defined in subsection b. of <em>N.J.S. </em>2C:11-1, or uses or threatens the immediate use of a deadly weapon. \u201cViolent crime\u201d also includes any aggravated sexual assault or sexual assault in which the actor uses, or threatens the immediate use of, physical force.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b520-8\">For the purposes of this section, \u201cdeadly weapon\u201d means any firearm or other weapon, device, instrument, material or substance, whether animate or inanimate, which in the manner it is used or is intended to be used, is known to be capable of producing death or serious bodily injury.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b520-9\">We focus on the second unnumbered paragraph, which defines a \u201cdeadly weapon\u201d that will render a first- or second-degree offense a violent crime subject to NERA. For NERA <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"489\">*489</page-number>purposes, \u201cdeadly weapon\u201d is defined as \u201cany firearm or other weapon, device, instrument, material or substance, whether animate or inanimate, which in the manner it is used or is intended to be used, is known to be capable of producing death or serious bodily injury.\u201d The interpretive question is whether the phrase \u201cwhich in the manner it is used or is intended to be used, is known to be capable of producing death or serious bodily injury\u201d qualifies only \u201cother weapon, device, instrument, material or substance\u201d (hereafter \u201cother weapon\u201d) or whether that modifying phrase also qualifies \u201cany firearm.\u201d We are persuaded that the text of this section, considering both its grammatical construction and punctuation, does not clearly point to either interpretation. Since the answer does not, therefore, lie in the plain meaning of the statute, we must resort to other constructional aids including legislative intent, applicable canons of construction, and both the text and judicial interpretation of other cognate and relevant legislation. Relying on these constructional aids, we conclude that both \u201cany firearm\u201d and \u201cother weapon\u201d are subject to the qualification. Hence, since an inoperable firearm used to threaten a victim is not itself capable of producing death or serious bodily injury,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> it may not be regarded as a deadly weapon for NERA sentencing purposes.</p>\n<p id=\"b521-6\">We have been guided in reaching this conclusion first by the canon of statutory interpretation that mandates strict construction of a criminal statute. <em>See generally State v. Galloway, </em>133 <em>N.J. </em>631, 658-659, 628 A.2d 735 (1993); <em>State v. Valentin, </em>105 <em>N.J. </em>14,17, 519 A.2d 322 (1987); <em>State v. Carbone, </em>38 <em>N.J. </em>19, 23-24, 183 A.2d 1 (1962). That canon has been, moreover, applied to NERA. <em>State v. Thomas, </em>322 <em>N.J.Super. </em>512, 518, 731 A.2d 532 (1999), <em>certif. granted, </em>162 <em>N.J. </em>489, 744 A.2d 1211 (1999). It is in the light of that overarching principle that we address the relationships among the complex of relevant statutes and parse their <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"490\">*490</page-number>legislatively intended meanings, considering, in this context, the import of <em>N.J.S.A </em>2C:ll-lc, which defines deadly weapon; <em>N.J.S.A </em>2C:15-lb, which elevates robbery to a first-degree crime if a deadly weapon is used or its use is immediately threatened; <em>N.J.S.A </em>2C:43-6c, the so-called Graves Act, which mandates a parole ineligibility term of between one-third and one-half of the base term if a firearm, as defined by <em>N.J.S.A </em>2C:39-lf, is used or possessed during the commission of stated crimes; and, finally, the firearm definition of <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:39-lf.</p>\n<p id=\"b522-5\">Our initial step in constructing this analytical framework is <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:39-lf, which defines firearm as</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b522-6\">any handgun, rifle, shotgun, machine gun, automatic or semi-automatic rifle, or any gun, device or instrument in the nature of a weapon from which may be fired or ejected any solid projectable ball, slug, pellet, missile or bullet, or any gas, vapor or other noxious thing, by means of a cartridge or shell or by the action of an explosive or the igniting of flammable or explosive substances. It shall also include, without limitation, any firearm which is in the nature of an air gun, spring gun or pistol or other weapon of a similar nature in which the propelling force is a spring, elastic band, carbon dioxide, compressed or other gas or vapor, air or compressed air, or is ignited by compressed air, and ejecting a bullet or missile smaller than three-eighths of an inch in diameter, with sufficient force to injure a person.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b522-7\">This definition has been construed as excluding a toy or fake firearm but as including a device designed as a firearm although inoperable at the time of its use in committing a crime. <em>State v. Gantt, </em>101 <em>N.J. </em>573, 584-585, 503 A.2d 849 (1986). It is thus clear that not only a BB gun but also an inoperable BB gun is a firearm as defined by <em>N.J.S.A </em>2C:39-lf. But that conclusion does not impel the further conclusion that it is also a firearm for NERA purposes.</p>\n<p id=\"b522-8\">In considering that proposition, we turn next to the Graves Act. <em>N.J.S.A </em>2C:43-6c prescribes two bases for imposition of its mandatory parole ineligibility term. The first is a conviction under <em>N.J.S.A </em>2C:39-4a of possession of a firearm with intent to use it against the person of another. It is plain that \u201cfirearm,\u201d as used in that prescription, incorporates the definition of <em>N.J.S.A </em>2C:39-lf since <em>N.J.S.A </em>2C:39-1 begins with the explanation that all its definitions govern Chapter 39. The second basis for imposition of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"491\">*491</page-number>a Graves Act sentence is defendant\u2019s conviction of one of the group of specified crimes if, during its attempt, commission or flight therefrom, he was \u201cin possession of a firearm as defined by <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:39-lf____\u201d This explicit reference to <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:39-lf leaves, of course, no doubt of the congruity between the Graves Act and the Chapter 39 definition in respect of firearms. And it is, of course, that congruity which is at the heart of the Supreme Court\u2019s holding in <em>Gantt, supra, </em>101 <em>N.J. </em>573, 503 A.2d 849, that a possession of an inoperable firearm subjects the defendant to a Graves Act sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b523-8\">NERA, however, is quite different. Section d does not incorporate, either expressly or by implication, the firearm definition of <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:39-lf. Nor does it make any reference to <em>N.J.S.A </em>2C:39-lv, which defines an imitation firearm. We regard this omission as critical. As we noted in <em>State v. Thomas, supra, </em>322 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 518, 731 A.2d 532, in the context of a NERA constructional problem, we must presume that the Legislature is familiar with its own enactments. When it intended to incorporate the reference to the Chapter 39 definition, as in the case of the Graves Act, it certainly knew how to do so. We must, therefore, assume that NERA\u2019s omission of a reference to the Chapter 39 definition was purposeful and hence that a qualification of that definition was within the legislative contemplation in enacting NERA. We view the legislative intent in that regard as based on its perception that while possession of an inoperable weapon during the commission of a serious crime should qualify a defendant for a Graves Act sentence, it need not, in implementation of its NERA purposes, impose that same onus on the use or threatened use of an inoperable weapon in commission of a first- or second-degree crime. The legislative intention to impose the severe penalty of parole ineligibility until eighty-five percent of the base term has been served was clearly intended to be limited to those truly violent crimes encompassed by its careful and circumscribed definition. It is, therefore, entirely consistent with the legislative scheme for the Legislature to have included inoperable <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"492\">*492</page-number>weapons within the Graves Act penalty but not within the NERA penalty.</p>\n<p id=\"b524-5\">We find further support for this conclusion in the disparity in the legislative approach to the concept of deadly weapons in other contexts as compared with its approach in NERA. <em>N.J.S.A </em>2C:li-le defines deadly weapon as</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b524-6\">any firearm or other weapon, device, instrument, material or substance, whether animate or inanimate, which in the manner it is used or is intended to be used, is known to be capable of producing death or serious bodily injury or which in the manner it is fashioned would lead the victim reasonably to believe it to be capable of producing death or serious bodily iiyury.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b524-7\">As we pointed out in <em>State v. Mosley, </em>335 <em>N.J.Swper. </em>144, 151, 761 A.2d 130 (App.Div.2000), this definition includes not only real weapons but also any device so fashioned as to reasonably lead the victim to believe it is a real weapon, <em>i.e., </em>a perceived weapon. And the perceived-weapon definition is not included in the NERA definition of deadly weapon \u2014 again, an omission which we must presume, and indeed has been held, to have been purposeful. <em>See State v. Pierre, </em>329 <em>N.J.Super. </em>588, 595-596, 748 A.2d 654 (Law Div.1999), <em>aff'd, </em>330 <em>N.J.Super. </em>7, 748 A.2d 1129 (App.Div.2000). We further point out that <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:15-lb elevates a robbery to a first-degree crime if the defendant is armed with, uses, or threatens the use of a deadly weapon. \u201cDeadly weapon\u201d for purposes of first-degree robbery includes a perceived weapon as defined by <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:ll-lc as well as a real weapon. <em>See State v. La France, </em>117 <em>N.J. </em>583, 595, 569 A.2d 1308 (1990); <em>State v. Hutson, </em>107 <em>N.J. </em>222, 227-228, 526 A.2d 687 (1987). Thus a toy or fake gun is sufficient to elevate a robbery to a first-degree crime but is not sufficient to justify imposition of a Graves Act sentence, which is reserved for the use of firearms, not all deadly weapons.</p>\n<p id=\"b524-8\">There is, moreover, further significance in the omission of the perceived weapon from the NERA deadly-weapon definition. The first portion of the deadly-weapon definition of <em>N.J.S.A </em>2C:ll-lc, that is, the real-weapon definition, is identical to the deadly-weapon definition of NERA and, therefore, includes the same qualification of \u201cknown to be capable of producing death or serious <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"493\">*493</page-number>bodily injury.\u201d Insofar as we have been able to determine, the question before us of whether that qualification in the non-NERA context modifies both firearm and \u201cother weapon\u201d or \u201cother weapon\u201d only has not arisen in a reported case in this jurisdiction, leaving us, therefore, without precedent on the scope of the qualification. We are satisfied, however, that the reason the question of scope of the qualification has not heretofore arisen is attributable to the perceived-weapon component of the <em>N.J.S.A </em>2C:ll-le definition of deadly weapon. That is to say, it is hardly necessary to consider whether a firearm for purposes of that definition must be one that is known to be capable of producing death or serious bodily <em>injury </em>\u2014 e.g., an <em>operable </em>firearm \u2014 since whether operable or not, an apparent firearm meets the perceived-weapon component of the definition. It is, therefore, that omission of that component from the NERA deadly-weapon definition that raises the issue of inoperable weapons in the first place.</p>\n<p id=\"b525-6\">We fully appreciate that our construction of NERA which applies the qualification of \u201cknown to be capable of producing death or serious bodily injury\u201d to both firearms and \u201cother weapons\u201d and, therefore, excludes inoperable firearms from the NERA definition, results in a more stringent definition of firearm and of deadly weapon than the Criminal Code had theretofore prescribed. But then again, NERA imposes a more stringent penalty for first- and second-degree crimes than the Criminal Code had theretofore prescribed. It is our obligation to strictly construe NERA that, in the end, has led us to the conclusion, for the reasons we have set forth, that an inoperable firearm is not a deadly weapon for NERA purposes. We do not, however, question the proposition that an operable firearm encompassed by the definition of <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:39-lf does meet NERA requirements. <em>See, e.g., State v. Cheung, </em>328 <em>N.J.Super. </em>368, 746 A.2d 38 (App.Div.2000) (NERA sentencing may be based on use of a BB gun); <em>State v. Meyer, </em>327 <em>N.J.Super. </em>50, 742 A.2d 614 (App.Div. 2000) (NERA sentencing may be based on use of a pellet gun).</p>\n<p id=\"b526-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"494\">*494</page-number>There are several additional matters we must address. First, we are aware that a trial court has reached a contrary conclusion, <em>State v. Perez, </em>331 <em>N.J.Super. </em>497, 752 A.2d 378 (Law Div.2000). To the extent that decision is contrary to ours, we overrule it. We farther note that we have received supplementary letters from the parties addressing the applicability of <em>Apprendi v. New Jersey, </em>530 <em>U.S. </em>466, 120 <em>S.Ct. </em>2348, 147 L.Ed.2d 435 (2000). For the reasons stated in <em>State v. Mosley, supra, </em>we reject the argument that NERA is structurally defective in the constitutional sense because of the post-conviction judicial fact-finding hearing which it prescribes.</p>\n<p id=\"b526-5\">Finally, defendant\u2019s statement at the plea proceeding provided a factual basis for conviction of first-degree robbery. The State stipulated to the inoperability of the BB gun, and hence there was no basis for imposition of a NERA sentence. There was, however, despite the prosecutor\u2019s misunderstanding, not only a basis for a Graves Act sentence but the mandatory requirement that a Graves Act sentence be imposed. A sentence imposed on conviction of a first-degree robbery by use of a firearm as defined by N.J.S.A 2C:39-lf, including an inoperable firearm, that does not carry a Graves Act mandatory parole ineligibility period is an illegal sentence. <em>See State v. Myers, </em>239 <em>N.J.Super. </em>158, 171, 570 A.2d 1260 (App.Div.), <em>certif. denied, </em>127 <em>N.J. </em>323, 604 A.2d 598 (1990); <em>State v. Bailey, </em>226 <em>N.J.Super. </em>559, 571, 545 A.2d 206 (App.Div.1988). An illegal sentence that has not been completely served may be corrected at any time without impinging upon double-jeopardy principles. <em>See, e.g., State v. Swint, </em>328 <em>N.J.Super. 236, </em>263, 745 A.2d 570 (App.Div.); <em>certif. denied, </em>165 <em>N.J. </em>492, 758 A.2d 651 (2000); <em>State v. Copeman, </em>197 <em>N.J.Super. </em>261, 265, 484 A.2d 1250 (App.Div.1984). We therefore deem the trial judge obliged, on remand for resentencing, to impose a Graves Act sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b526-6\">The judgment of conviction is modified to vacate the NERA parole ineligibility term, and we remand for resentencing in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"495\">*495</page-number>accordance with this opinion. In all other respects the judgment of conviction is affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b520-10\"> Prior to sentencing, the weapon was tested and its inoperability was confirmed.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b521-7\"> We are not here addressing the use of a firearm as a blunt instrument but only, as here, its use for the purpose of inducing the victim to believe it can shoot projectiles.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
