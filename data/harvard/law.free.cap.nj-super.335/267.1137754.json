Manzie committed the murder on September 27,1997. At that time, Werner was 11 and Manzie was 15. The Family Part waived jurisdiction, and Manzie was indicted. Manzie entered his guilty plea against the advice of his counsel and his family. The State agreed to dismiss the other nine counts of the indictment, which included charges of aggravated sexual assault, aggravated criminal sexual contact, and first degree robbery. The State agreed not to seek a mandatory sentence of life imprisonment without parole under <em>N.J.S.A </em>2C:ll-3b(3), which applies to the murder of a child under the age of 14 in the course of a sexual assault or criminal sexual contact. The State indicated, however, that it would seek a term of imprisonment up to life, as well as application of the No Early Release Act (NERA). NERA requires service of 85% of a sentence without parole in the event of conviction of a first or second degree \u201cviolent crime.\u201d <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:43-7.2a.</p>\n<p id=\"b301-8\">The trial court sentenced defendant to 70 years\u2019 imprisonment and applied NERA, ordering that Manzie not be eligible for parole until he has served 59 years and 6 months of his sentence. The sentencing court also imposed the 30-year mandatory period of parole ineligibility required in the murder statute, <em>N.J.S.A </em>2C:11-3b, noting, however, that \u201cthe paramount provision of the \u2018No-Early-Release-Law\u2019 shall govern.\u201d The court dismissed the other counts in the indictment.</p>\n<p id=\"b301-9\">Manzie appeals and makes the following contentions:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b302-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"270\">*270</page-number>POINT I</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b302-5\">THE LOWER COURT ERRED, FACTUALLY AND LEGALLY, IN DETERMINING AND WEIGHING THE AGGRAVATING AND MITIGATING FACTORS UNDER <em>N.J.S.A </em>2C:44-1.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b302-6\">POINT II</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b302-7\">THE LOWER COURT ERRED IN APPLYING THE NO EARLY RELEASE ACT, <em>N.J.S.A </em>2C:43-7.2, IN THE PRESENT MATTER SINCE THAT ACT DOES NOT APPLY TO MURDER UNDER <em>N.J.S.A </em>2C:ll-3.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b302-8\">The first contention is without sufficient merit to warrant discussion in a written opinion. <em>R. </em>2:ll-3(e)(2). We perceive no basis in the record to interfere with the trial court\u2019s sentence of 70 years\u2019 imprisonment.</p>\n<p id=\"b302-9\">The difficult issue is whether NERA applies to murder. <em>N.J.S.A </em>2C:43-7.2a and d provide:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b302-10\">a. A court imposing a sentence of incarceration for a crime of the first or second degree shall fix a minimum term of 85% of the sentence during which the defendant shall not be eligible for parole if the crime is a violent crime as defined in subsection d. of this section.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b302-11\">d. For the purposes of this section, \u201cviolent crime\u201d means any crime in which the actor causes death, causes serious bodily injury as defined in subsection b. of N.J.S. 2C:11-1, or uses or threatens the immediate use of a deadly weapon. \u201cViolent crime\u201d also includes any aggravated sexual assault or sexual assault in which the actor uses, or threatens the immediate use of, physical force.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b302-12\">For the purposes of this section, \u201cdeadly weapon\u201d means any firearm or other weapon, device, instrument, material or substance, whether animate or inanimate, which in the manner it is used or is intended to be used, is known to be capable of producing death or serious bodily injury.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b302-13\">The issue is one of legislative intent. <em>See State v. Ferencsik, </em>326 <em>N.J.Super. </em>228, 230-31, 741 A.2d 101 (App.Div.1999) (reviewing principles of statutory construction). The State argues that the statute is clear and unambiguous; murder is a violent crime as defined in subsection d because Manzie caused Werner\u2019s death. Indeed, we have applied NERA to other forms of homicide, such as reckless manslaughter, <em>State v. Newman, </em>325 <em>N.J.Super. </em>556, 561, 740 A.2d 153 (App.Div.1999) (holding that \u201cthe plain language admits only one interpretation \u2014 reckless manslaughter falls within [NERA] ... \u201d), <em>certif. denied, </em>163 <em>N.J. </em>396, 749 A.2d 370 (2000), and to vehicular homicide, <em>State v. Ferencsik, supra, </em>326 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 231, 741 A.2d 101 (stating that \u201c[w]e <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"271\">*271</page-number>perceive no ambiguity from language or context in the Act\u2019s definition of a \u2018violent crime,\u2019 \u201d as applied to vehicular homicide). Murder, however, is different.</p>\n<p id=\"b303-6\">NERA applies to crimes \u201cof the first or second degree.\u201d <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:43-7.2a. But the statute does not mention murder. Although murder is characterized as a crime of the first degree, <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:ll-3b(l), it is rarely, if ever, analyzed as a first degree crime because the murder statute establishes a discrete sentencing scheme which deviates substantially from the sentencing options applicable to first degree crimes.</p>\n<p id=\"b303-7\">The court may sentence a person convicted of a first degree crime to imprisonment \u201cfor a specific term of years which shall be fixed by the court and shall be between 10 years and 20 years.\u201d <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:43-6a(l). The presumptive sentence for a first degree crime is 15 years. <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:44-lf(l)(b). The statute establishing presumptive terms explicitly states that it does not apply to murder. <em>N.J.S.A </em>2C:44-lf(l). In sentencing for a first degree crime, a court may impose a period of parole ineligibility of up to one-half of the sentence. Because the maximum ordinary term for a first degree crime is 20 years, the maximum period of parole ineligibility is 10 years. <em>N.J.SA </em>2C:43-6b.</p>\n<p id=\"b303-8\">More severe ordinary terms may be imposed for certain first degree crimes such as aggravated manslaughter, <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:11-4a, and kidnapping, <em>N.J.S.A </em>2C:13-la and b. A person may be sentenced to a prison term between 10 and 30 years for aggravated manslaughter, <em>N.J.SA </em>2C:ll-4c, and to a prison term between 15 and 30 years for kidnapping. <em>N.J.SA </em>2C:13-le(l).</p>\n<p id=\"b303-9\">Murder, however, is unique. <em>See State v. Maguire, </em>84 <em>N.J. </em>508, 526, 423 A.2d 294 (1980) (holding that crime of murder is subject to discretionary term of life imprisonment, though it is described as a crime of the first degree); <em>State v. Serrone, </em>95 <em>N.J. </em>23, 27, 468 A.2d 1050 (1983) (holding that life imprisonment for murder is an ordinary term, not an extended term; therefore, consecutive life sentences may be imposed for double murder despite prohibition against imposition of two extended terms). It may result in a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"272\">*272</page-number>death sentence. <em>N.J.SA </em>2C:ll-3c. In non-capital murder, the <em>minimum </em>sentence is 30 years <em>without parole. N.J.S.A. </em>2C:11-3b(l). The court may sentence a convicted murderer to a term in excess of 30 years and up to life imprisonment, but 30 years of that sentence must be served before parole eligibility. <em>Ibid. </em>A sentence of life imprisonment without parole must be imposed in certain circumstances if the victim was a law enforcement officer, <em>N.J.SA </em>2C:ll-3b(2), or, as previously indicated, if the murder was committed during an aggravated sexual assault and the victim was under the age of 14. <em>N.J.SA </em>2C:ll-3b(3).</p>\n<p id=\"b304-5\">Parole ineligibility is an element which underscores the unique status of murder and further distinguishes it from first degree crimes. As previously noted, <em>N.J.S.A </em>2C:43-6b authorizes the imposition of a period of parole ineligibility of up to one-half of a prison term. This general provision applies to first degree crimes, but the State conceded that it does not apply to murder because the murder statute establishes a maximum 30-year period of parole ineligibility. Thus, even if a court imposes a 70-year prison term for murder, it may not rely on <em>N.J.SA </em>2C:43-6b to establish a 35 year parole ineligibility period.</p>\n<p id=\"b304-6\">The special status of murder with its own complete and integrated sentencing scheme, the fact that murder already requires the application of the severest sanctions, and NERA\u2019s express application only to \u201ca crime of the first or second degree\u201d create an ambiguity, based on language and context, regarding NERA\u2019s application to murder. <em>Cf. Alan J. Comblatt, P.A. v. Barow, </em>153 <em>N.J. </em>218, 231, 708 A.2d 401 (1998) (stating that \u201cif the language [of a statute] has more than one possible interpretation, the court will look beyond the language to determine the Legislature\u2019s intent\u201d); <em>Brock v. Public Service Elec. &amp; Gas Co., </em>149 <em>N.J. </em>378, 391, 693 A.2d 894 (1997) (noting that \u201cambiguity may be inferred from related legislation or other circumstance\u201d though the statutory language is otherwise clear); <em>Henry v. Shopper\u2019s World, </em>200 <em>N.J.Super. </em>14, 18, 490 A.2d 320 (App.Div.1985) (observing that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"273\">*273</page-number>\u201c[o]ften, the surest path to misconstruction is a literal reading of a statute\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b305-6\">In the face of ambiguity, we must look beyond the statute\u2019s language to determine the legislative intent. <em>Cornblatt, supra, </em>153 <em>N.J. </em>at 231, 708 A.2d 401. Legislative history, including legislative statements and the testimony of sponsors, are valuable interpretive aids. <em>See State v. McQuaid, </em>147 <em>N.J. </em>464, 480-82, 688 A.2d 584 (1997); <em>State v. Supervisory Employees Ass\u2019n, </em>78 <em>N.J. </em>54, 68-70, 393 A.2d 233 (1978); <em>Butler v. Amato, </em>224 <em>N.J.Super. </em>124, 128, 539 A.2d 1241 (App.Div.1988). The Legislators who sponsored NERA stated expressly and impliedly that it does not apply to murder. Senator John Bennett introduced \u00d1ERA as S. 855 on February 26, 1996. On April 24, 1996, S. 855 was the subject of a public hearing before the Senate Law and Public Safety Committee. <em>No Early Release Act: Hearing on S. 855 Before The Senate Law &amp; Public Safety Comm., </em>207th Legis., 1st Sess. (N. J.1996) (hereafter \u201cHearing\u201d). Senator Kosco, the committee chair, was a sponsor of the bill.</p>\n<p id=\"b305-7\">Assemblywoman Diane Allen, who sponsored the bill in the Assembly, was the first witness. Assemblywoman Allen explained that the bill\u2019s purpose is \u201cto insure that those violent offenders who commit the crimes like <em>manslaughter, attempted murder, kidnapping, aggravated assault, arson for hire, aggravated sexual assault, </em>and <em>vehicular manslaughter </em>are held accountable.\u201d Hearing, p. 3-4 (emphasis added). Murder was not on her list.</p>\n<p id=\"b305-8\">In his statement at the hearing, Senator Bennett expanded on his bill\u2019s rationale:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b305-9\">The current system of justice does not hold all violent offenders who commit first or second degree crimes accountable. Getting out of jail early is not accountability. Getting out of jail for manslaughter <em>with only serving one-third, or, in some cases, one-fifth of their sentence is not accountability. </em>Making crime victims and their families suffer the humiliation of early release is not accountability. The No Early Release Act is accountability. Offenders will have to serve a minimum of 85 percent of their sentence before they are eligible for parole, period. As my colleague Diane Allen said, \u201cNo excuses, no exceptions.\u201d We all believe that these criminals need to serve the time for their crimes. Frankly, the surviving victims <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"274\">*274</page-number>and their families are under a life sentence of pain. The criminals have to be sent a message. You can\u2019t work the system any more when our bill becomes law.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b306-5\">[Healing, p. 7 (emphasis added).]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b306-6\">Thus, Senator Bennett\u2019s motivation in sponsoring S. 855 was the perception that perpetrators of violent crimes were serving only between one-fifth and one-third of their sentences. It is apparent that this perception does not apply to murder because of its minimum sentence of 30 years\u2019 imprisonment without parole. Senator Bennett made this clear when he stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b306-7\">Mr. Chairman, I am honored that you are the prime sponsor of the No Early Release Act. We need to insure that those violent offenders who commit crimes, including manslaughter, attempted murder, kidnapping, aggravated assault, arson for hire, aggravated sexual assault, and vehicular manslaughter, are held accountable. <em>At this time we know that murder is exempted from our bill, became since 1982, it carries a mandatory minimum sentence of 80 years urithout parole. </em>But every violent category fits in, and if someone fails to tell us that the bill has missed a category, we will amend it.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b306-8\">[Healing, p. 8 (emphasis added).]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b306-9\">At the hearing, an Assistant Prosecutor representing the Monmouth County Prosecutor made a statistical presentation in favor of the bill, mirroring Senator Bennett\u2019s concerns. He stated in part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b306-10\">This piece of legislation represents a marked difference from the amount of time criminals actually serve in New Jersey. Although New Jersey law requires a criminal to serve at least one-third of their sentence before becoming eligible for parole, in reality, these criminals are only serving one-fifth of their sentence based on various programs of good time credit. Consequently, a criminal sentenced to a 20-year term of imprisonment will actually serve four years. And if you can just take a look at the charts presented by this Committee, a 20-year sentence represents only four years of incarceration for some of our most heinous crimes committed in the State of New Jersey.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b306-11\">[Hearing, p. 20.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b306-12\">The Assistant Prosecutor closed his remarks noting that \u201cfor a crime of the first degree, a defendant should be sentenced to a term of imprisonment between 10 and 20 years, not a term of 2 to 5 years.\u201d Hearing, p. 21. It is apparent that these concerns do not apply to the sentencing scheme for murder.</p>\n<p id=\"b306-13\">The bill passed the Senate on May 16,1996, but did not pass the Assembly until June 5,1997. The bill was amended in at least two <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"275\">*275</page-number>respects after the hearing. One of the amendments added subsection d, which defines a violent crime. It was never amended to provide expressly that it applied to murder.</p>\n<p id=\"b307-6\">Concededly, the general rule is that amendment of a statute after a sponsor\u2019s statement explaining the bill\u2019s intent may render that statement \u201ca less than definitive guide\u201d to the statute\u2019s interpretation. <em>State v. Supervisory Employees Ass\u2019n, supra, </em>78 <em>N.J. </em>at 70, 393 A.2d 233. S. 855, as originally introduced, applied to \u201ca crime of the first or second degree involving violence,\u201d but did not define \u201ccrime ... involving violence.\u201d The amended bill substituted the phrase \u201cviolent crime\u201d and added subsection d, which, in part, defined that phrase to mean \u201cany crime in which the actor causes death, [or] causes serious bodily injury.\u201d There is no doubt that under the original bill, a crime causing death, such as aggravated manslaughter and manslaughter, was a crime \u201cinvolving violence.\u201d Subsection d, therefore, neither added to or detracted from NERA\u2019s application to certain homicides. Subsection d\u2019s significance to NERA was its inclusion of sexual assaults as violent crimes. Additionally, it also narrowed the meaning of violent crime by limiting it to death, serious bodily injury, or the use or threatened use of a deadly weapon. Thus, the addition of subsection d does not affect our analysis and does not tend to dilute the pre-amendment value of the sponsors\u2019 statements.</p>\n<p id=\"b307-7\">Murder is the only crime for which life imprisonment is an available ordinary sentence. <em>See Serrone, supra, </em>95 <em>N.J. </em>at 25, 468 A.2d 1050. But, NERA does not define what would constitute 85% of life for the purpose of applying NERA\u2019s parole ineligibility period, though other sections of the Criminal Code define the parole ineligibility periods to be imposed in connection with extended-term life sentences. <em>See, e.g., N.J.S.A. </em>2C:43-7b and c (defining parole ineligibility periods of 25 and 30 years for certain life sentences imposed as extended terms).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The absence of such <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"276\">*276</page-number>a definition suggests that the Legislature did not intend that NERA would apply to murder.</p>\n<p id=\"b308-5\">We are persuaded that if the Legislature had intended NERA to apply to murder, it would have done so expressly and by amending the murder statute. <em>Cf. Township of Mahwah v. Bergen Cty. Bd. of Taxation, </em>98 <em>N.J. </em>268, 280, 486 A.2d 818 (1985) (holding that implied repeal of one statute by a later statute \u201crequires clear and compelling evidence of the legislative intent, and such intent must be free from reasonable doubt\u201d); <em>State v. States, </em>44 <em>N.J. </em>285, 291, 208 A.2d 633 (1965) (stating that \u201crepeals by implication are not favored and ... both laws should be given effect if reasonably possible\u201d). Applying NERA to a murder sentence would, in most cases, be tantamount to a life sentence without parole. In the past, when the Legislature intended such a result, it amended the murder statute. <em>See N.J.S.A. </em>2C:ll-3b(2) and (3). We deem it unlikely that the Legislature would disrupt by implication the sentencing scheme for murder, especially when the perception giving rise to NERA, service of inadequate real prison time for certain crimes, does not apply to murder. NERA and the murder statute may stand together, NERA applying to first degree crimes other than murder. <em>Cf. Kemp v. State of New Jersey, </em>147 <em>N.J. </em>294, 307, 687 A.2d 715 (1997) (applying the principle that \u201cif the inconsistency between a later act and an earlier one is not fatal to the operation of either, the two may stand together and no repeal will be effected\u201d (quoting 1A Norman J. Singer, <em>Sutherland Statutory Construction </em>\u00a7 23.09 at 338-39)).</p>\n<p id=\"b308-6\">Finally, and perhaps most significantly, imposition of a virtual life sentence without parole for murder would impact imposition of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"277\">*277</page-number>the death penalty. <em>N.J.S.A </em>2C:ll-3f provides that in the penalty hearing in a capital case, prior to the jury\u2019s deliberations, the trial court must inform the jury of the sentences which may be imposed for murder if the jury does not impose the death penalty. This is a critical element of the jury instructions in a penalty phase hearing. <em>See State v. Ramseur, </em>106 <em>N.J. </em>123, 311, 524 A.2d 188 (1987); <em>see also State v. Martini, </em>160 <em>N.J. </em>248, 272-74, 734 A.2d 257 (1999); <em>State v. Harris, </em>156 <em>N.J. </em>122, 195-98, 716 A.2d 458 (1998); <em>State v. Loftin, </em>146 <em>N.J. </em>295, 369-73, 680 A.2d 677 (1996); <em>State v. Martini, </em>131 <em>N.J. </em>176, 308-13, 619 A.2d 1208 (1993); <em>State v. Bey, </em>129 <em>N.J. </em>557, 601-04, 610 A.2d 814 (1992); <em>State v. Bey, </em>112 <em>N.J. </em>123, 179-80, 548 A.2d 887 (1988); <em>cf. Simmons v. South Carolina, </em>512 <em>U.S. </em>154, 114 <em>S.Ct. </em>2187, 129 L.Ed.2d 133 (1994) (holding that trial court\u2019s refusal to inform jury in a capital case that the alternative to death, a life sentence, would be without parole eligibility violated due process). In light of NERA\u2019s potential impact on a jury\u2019s evaluation of the appropriateness of the death penalty in a capital murder prosecution, we conclude it is unlikely that the Legislature would introduce NERA into the death-penalty equation without expressly considering and addressing its implications in that regard, <em>i.e., </em>without expressly amending the murder statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b309-6\">The State contends that Manzie may not challenge on appeal the applicability of NERA to murder because he did not challenge it below and, to the contrary, agreed below that NERA applied to murder. The record establishes that Manzie and his attorneys signed the Supplemental Plea Form For No Early Release Act Cases. In that form they acknowledged applicability of NERA to murder. The State further argues that NERA\u2019s applicability was the \u201clinchpin\u201d of the plea agreement with the State because the State agreed to abandon prosecution for the aggravated sexual assault of Eddie Werner, thereby avoiding a potential sentence of life imprisonment without parole as authorized in <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:11\u2014 3b(3).</p>\n<p id=\"b310-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"278\">*278</page-number>The simple response to the State\u2019s argument is that a defendant may not acquiesce in the imposition of an illegal sentence. <em>See State v. Horton, </em>331 <em>N.J.Super. </em>92, 97, 751 A.2d 141 (App.Div.2000) (holding that \u201ca court has the inherent power to correct an illegal sentence\u201d); <em>State v. Meyer, </em>327 <em>N.J.Super. </em>50, 55, 742 A.2d 614 (App.Div.2000) (holding that defendant, who conceded applicability of NERA when he entered guilty plea, could raise NERA\u2019s applicability on appeal because the issue involves the legality of a sentence), <em>certif. denied, </em>164 <em>N.J. </em>191, 752 A.2d 1292 (2000); <em>State v. Nemeth, </em>214 <em>N.J.Super. </em>324, 327, 519 A.2d 367 (App.Div.1986) (ruling that \u201cthere can be no plea bargain to an illegal sentence\u201d). In this regard, the State\u2019s reliance on <em>State v. Rumblin, </em>326 <em>N.J.Super. </em>296, 302, 741 A.2d 138 (App.Div. 1999), <em>certif. granted, </em>163 <em>N.J. </em>396, 749 A.2d 370 (2000), is misplaced. There, we determined that Rumblin was subject to NERA, though he pleaded guilty as an accomplice to a first degree robbery. The comment that, \u201cwe discern no valid grounds to allow him to now claim\u201d that NERA does not apply, though he had acknowledged its application in this Supplemental Plea Form was dictum. <em>Id. </em>at 302, 741 A.2d 138. In the present case, whether the State has a remedy because we have removed the alleged \u201clinchpin\u201d of its plea agreement is not before us.</p>\n<p id=\"b310-5\">We hold that NERA does not apply to murder; therefore, the 85% parole ineligibility period must be eliminated. In all other respects, the judgment is affirmed. We remand for further proceedings.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b307-8\"> The State argues that NERA must apply to murder; otherwise, a person convicted of a crime other than murder and sentenced to an extended term of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"276\">*276</page-number>life imprisonment under <em>NJ.S.A. </em>2C:44-3 and <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:43-7a will serve more time under NERA than a murderer not subject to NERA. This argument assumes that NERA applies to extended terms as well as ordinary terms. We have reservations regarding that assumption, in light of the perceived problem NERA is intended to address. In any event, comparing an extended term sentence with an ordinary term lacks analytical value.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
