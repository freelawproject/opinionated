We hold that the Act was never intended to cover public entities, when judgments against them are paid by public funds. In so holding, we respectfully disagree with our court\u2019s decision in <em>Graber v. Richard Stockton College of New Jersey, </em>313 <em>N.J.Super. </em>476, 713 A.2d 503 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"429\">*429</page-number>(App.Div.), <em>certif. denied, </em>156 <em>N.J. </em>409, 719 A.2d 641 (1998), which held to the contrary. We reverse and remand for further proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b461-6\">Plaintiff, while a full-time student at Montclair State, fell down the steps of the University\u2019s amphitheater. He claims that the fall was due to a broken and cracked staircase. He sustained several fractured ribs and a fractured elbow and was hospitalized for several days.</p>\n<p id=\"b461-7\">Plaintiff filed suit. The Attorney General, on behalf of Montelair State, filed an answer raising affirmative defenses under the New Jersey Tort Claims Act (TCA), <em>N.J.S.A. </em>59:1-1 to 59:12-3, and that Montclair State was immune under the Act, <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2A:53A-7. Relying on <em>Graber, supra, </em>313 <em>N.J.Super. </em>476, 713 A.2d 503, which held that a state college is afforded immunity under <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2A:53A-7, the motion judge dismissed the complaint, finding that plaintiff was a \u201cbeneficiary\u201d of the works of the University. <em>See N.J.S.A. </em>2A:53A-7a.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Since he concluded that plaintiffs action was barred by the Act, the judge did not reach Montclair State\u2019s tort claims defenses.</p>\n<p id=\"b461-8\">The principle of charitable immunity was deeply rooted in the common law of New Jersey. The immunity was first declared in <em>D\u2019Amato v. Orange Mem. Hosp., </em>101 <em>N.J.L. </em>61, 127 A. 340 (E. &amp; A. 1925), as a judicial expression of our state\u2019s public policy that a charitable hospital should not be held liable for injuries to its patients. This is so because \u201cpayment for board, medical services, and nursing in such case [goes] to the general fund to maintain the charity.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 65, 127 <em>A. </em>340. Thus, a primary justification for the immunity was preservation of the charitable fund: <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"430\">*430</page-number><em>Accord Simmons v.

The Legislature responded to these decisions by adopting the Act, <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2A:53A-7 to -11. <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2A:53A-7 provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b462-6\">a.

Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Newark, </em>95 <em>N.J. </em>530, 533, 472 A.2d 531 (1984) (quoting <em>Wiklund v.

However, the grant of immunity was intentionally limited. <em>DeVries v. Habitat for Humanity, </em>290 <em>N.J.Super. </em>479, 484, 676 A.2d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"431\">*431</page-number>152 (App.Div.1996), <em>aff'd, </em>147 <em>N.J. </em>619, 689 A.2d 142 (1997).

Christ Hosp., </em>21 <em>N.J. </em>588, 123 A.2d 10 (1956); <em>Rose v. Raleigh Fitkin-Paul Morgan Mem. Hosp., </em>136 <em>N.J.L. </em>553, 57 A.2d 29 (E. &amp; A. 1948); <em>Kolb, supra, </em>116 <em>N.J.L. </em>118, 182 A 822; <em>Simmons, supra, </em>112 <em>N.J.L. </em>129, 170 A. 237; <em>Boeckel v.

In rejecting the majority\u2019s view that the Act applied to municipally-operated Jersey City Hospital, Judge Lynch concluded:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b463-10\">The words describing those organizations upon whieh the statute confers either total or limited immunity (\u201cnonprofit corporation,\u201d etc.) have developed an established connotation in our law, i.e., <em>a private ckarity which depends on charitable contributions and whose funds are held in trust solely for the purpose of the charity. The statutory language is derived from the cases which conferred immunity upon private charities at common law. </em>A municipality is not such a corporation, society or association. It is organized under, and has the powers and duties provided for, in N.J.S.A. 40:42-1 et seq.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b463-11\"><em>[Winters, supra, </em>120 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 138, 293 A.2d 431 (Lynch, J.AD., concurring in part and dissenting in part) (emphasis added).]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b463-13\">Because Jersey City Medical Center derived its funds from the public, rather than from private bequests, the policy underpinnings to the Act, the preservation of private funds given by benefactors, was inapplicable. <em>Ibid.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b464-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"432\">*432</page-number>In agreeing with the views expressed by Judge Lynch in his dissent, the Supreme Court concluded that the $10,000 limit for recoveries against charitable hospitals, <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2A:53A-8, was inapplicable to Jersey City Medical Center and modified the judgment accordingly. <em>Winters, supra, </em>63 <em>N.J. </em>at 8, 304 A.2d 196. <em>See also Tramutola v. Bortone, </em>63 <em>N.J. </em>9, 304 A.2d 197 (1973) (modifying a judgment against Bayonne Hospital, concluding that the statutory $10,000 limitation of liability under the Act was not applicable to a claim against a municipal corporation for damages resulting from the improper operation of its hospital).</p>\n<p id=\"b464-5\">The legislative history to the Act supports the conclusion that the statutory words were intended to apply only to private charities. <em>State v. Hoffman, </em>149 <em>N.J. </em>564, 578, 695 A.2d 236 (1997) (\u201c[ejxtrinsic aids, such as legislative history, [and] committee reports, ... may be used to help resolve any ambiguity and to ascertain the true intent of the Legislature\u201d). Nowhere in the legislative history is there any suggestion that the Legislature intended to afford charitable immunity to public entities. Indeed, the entire legislative hearing conducted in 1959 on the bill, ultimately codified as the Act, focused on the necessity of preserving the defense of immunity to private institutions.</p>\n<p id=\"b464-6\">For example, a representative of hospitals maintained under religious auspices, testified concerning the drastic effect abrogation of the immunity will have on private Catholic hospitals. An insurance casualty underwriter predicted increases in insurance premiums charged to private charitable institutions as a consequence of the abolition of the charitable immunity doctrine. \u201cIn all the 159 pages of the hearing, not a single word of testimony referred to the possibility that the proposed bill referred to anything but private charitable hospitals.\u201d <em>Winters, supra, </em>120 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 142, 293 A.2d 431 (Lynch, J.A.D., concurring in part and dissenting in part). Further, during the Chairman\u2019s colloquy with a casualty underwriter, the Chairman made clear that \u201c[w]e are not talking about public schools. <em>We are talking about schools that are operated by religious and charitable organizations.\u201d </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"433\">*433</page-number><em>Public Hearing Before Assembly Judiciary Comm, on Assembly Comm. Substitute for Senate Bill No. S-20h, </em>107-08 (July 17, 1958) (emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b465-5\">In fact, when the Act was passed in 1959, the State of New Jersey already enjoyed sovereign immunity in the area of tort liability. It was not until 1970, that the immunity was abrogated by the Court in <em>Willis v. Department of Conservation &amp; Economic Development, </em>55 <em>N.J. </em>534, 264 A.2d 34 (1970). Prior to and after the abrogation of the sovereign immunity doctrine, there evolved a statutory hodgepodge of waivers of the immunity for local governments and some state agencies. <em>See Report of the Attorney General\u2019s Task Force on Sovereign Immunity, </em>31-34 (May, 1972) (the Kugler Report). However, because of the extant general rule of sovereign immunity favoring the State in 1959, we doubt the Legislature intended that public institutions, created by the State for educational purposes, be given charitable immunity under the Act as well.</p>\n<p id=\"b465-6\">All parties agree that Montclair State is a \u201cpublic entity,\u201d whose liabilities are subject to the provisions of the TCA. There is also no question that it is a nonprofit corporation and, governed by the provisions of <em>N.J.S.A. </em>18A:64-1 to -84 and <em>N.J.S.A </em>18A:3B-1 to -36, is created exclusively for educational purposes. There is also no doubt that, by the passage of the Higher Education Restructuring Act of 1994, <em>L. </em>1994, c. 48 <em>(N.J.S.A. </em>18A:3B-1 to -36), institutions of higher education were given greater autonomy over such functions as the development of institutional plans, supervision of their institutions, the setting of tuition and fees, and the establishment of admission standards. However, Montclair\u2019s income is derived from State funds, tuition, and, to an undetermined amount, charitable gifts. The Legislature appropriates the necessary funds to State institutions, payable monthly, <em>N.J.S.A. </em>18A:64-18.1. The institutions are responsible to control expenditures of the appropriated funds \u201cin accordance with the provisions of the State budget and appropriation acts of the Legislature,\u201d and for <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"434\">*434</page-number>reporting the receipt of funds and expenditures to the State Department of the Treasury. <em>N.J.S.A </em>18A:64r-6f.</p>\n<p id=\"b466-5\">Moreover, pursuant to <em>N.J.S.A </em>18A:3B-6h, Montclair has opted to be represented by the Attorney General. Thus, it is entitled to indemnification for any tort-claim settlements or judgments against it from the fund created by the TCA pursuant to <em>N.J.S.A </em>59:12-1. <em>See N.J.S.A </em>18A:3B-6h. Consequently, any judgment against it arising out of a personal injury claim will be paid from a public trust fund created by public tax dollars. Thus, we are not presented here with the diversion or diminishment of private charitable funds.</p>\n<p id=\"b466-6\">Nevertheless, in <em>Graber, supra, </em>313 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 485, 713 A.2d 503, the court held that Stockton State College was entitled to immunity under the Act despite its status as a public entity. This was so, the court reasoned, because Stockton State College met the definitional requirement of a charity: it was \u201ca nonprofit institution organized exclusively for educational purposes[.]\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 486, 713 A.2d 503. We respectfully disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b466-7\">The fact that the entity is a nonprofit institution created exclusively for educational purposes is not dispositive. After <em>Graber </em>was decided, we concluded in <em>Hamel v. State, </em>321 <em>N.J.Super. </em>67, 728 A.2d 264 (App.Div.1999), that a local school board, a public entity, was not entitled to protection under the Act despite the fact that it was a nonprofit organization and created exclusively for educational purposes, because it relied primarily on tax dollars and governmental subsidies, rather than charitable contributions. <em>Id. </em>at 76-77, 728 A.2d 264; <em>see also Winters, supra, </em>120 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 140, 293 A.2d 431 (Lynch, J.A.D., concurring in part and dissenting in part) (rejecting the notion that boards of education are afforded immunity under the Act, observing that \u201c[s]uch is not the law and, indeed, so far as I know, the contention has never been made\u201d). The threshold question must be whether the Legislature ever envisioned public entities, such as state colleges, as being within the protective reach of the Act. Because the Legislature \u201cdid not intend to expand, modify, or alter in any way the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"435\">*435</page-number>span of the pre-existing immunity,\u201d we conclude that it did not. <em>Anasiewicz, supra, </em>74 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 535, 181 A.2d 787. The policy underpinnings to charitable immunity at common law have no application to a public entity, whose liability judgments are paid by public funds.</p>\n<p id=\"b467-6\">Our conclusion is fortified by the fact that, in every reported case we have found prior to <em>Graber, </em>State institutions of higher learning have only asserted defenses under the TCA, despite the fact that the injured plaintiff may have been a \u201cbeneficiary\u201d under the Act. <em>See e.g., Lowe v. Zarghami, </em>158 <em>N.J. </em>606, 731 A.2d 14 (1999) (application of the late notice requirements under <em>N.J.S.A </em>58:8-8 in a malpractice action by patient against the University of Medicine and Dentistry of New Jersey (UMDNJ)); <em>Mittra v. University of Medicine &amp; Dentistry, </em>316 <em>N.J.Super </em>83, 719 A.2d 693 (App.Div.1998) (former student\u2019s action against UMDNJ dismissed for failure to give adequate notice of tort claim as required by the TCA); <em>Setrin v. Glassboro State College, </em>136 <em>N.J.Super. </em>329, 346 A.2d 102 (App.Div.1975) (student stabbed during racial unrest on campus did not sustain injury as a result of a \u201cdangerous condition\u201d under <em>N.J.S.A. </em>59:4-2). In none of these eases did the Attorney General raise the Act as a defense, suggesting a tacit acknowledgment that the only defenses available were under the TCA.</p>\n<p id=\"b467-7\">There is a sound policy reason for reaching such a conclusion. Unlike the Charitable Immunity Act, the TCA is not concerned with preventing the diminution of private trust funds. Its focus is on the protection of the public fisc, and the development of all-inclusive rules of the game so that public entities have a measure of predictability as to costs and liability. <em>See </em>Kugler Report, <em>supra, </em>comment to <em>N.J.S.A. </em>59:2-1. The TCA defines \u201cpublic entity\u201d broadly in order to \u201cprovide a basis upon which an established body of law may be uniformly applied.\u201d Kugler Report, <em>supra, </em>comment on <em>N.J.S.A. </em>59:1-3. Consequently, the TCA adopted the fundamental rule that public entities are absolved from tort liability except under conditions and circum<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"436\">*436</page-number>stances provided by the Act. Thus, even when a provision of the TCA establishes liability, that liability is ordinarily negated if the public entity possesses a corresponding immunity. <em>Rochinsky v. State, Dep\u2019t of Transp., </em>110 <em>N.J. </em>399, 408, 541 A.2d 1029 (1988). Also, the TCA sets forth conditions to liability. For example, it: (1) imposes strict notice requirements, N.J.S.A 59:8-8; (2) requires proof that the public entity\u2019s conduct was palpably unreasonable, <em>see e.g., </em>N.J.S.A 59:4-2; and (3) limits recovery for pain and suffering, <em>N.J.S.A </em>59:9-2d. Coupling the \u201cbeneficiary\u201d defense <em>(N.J.SA </em>2A:53A-7) and the limit to recovery <em>(N.J.S.A </em>2A:53A-8) under the Act with the immunities and conditions of liability imposed by the TCA may present an insurmountable burden for an injured litigant to overcome, and provides the public entity with an imbalanced array of defenses merely because it may be, for example, a nonprofit entity created exclusively for educational purposes.</p>\n<p id=\"b468-5\">Moreover, the Kugler Report and the provisions of the TCA itself disclose no reference to the Act. In our view, this is so because, in enacting the TCA, the Legislature did not envision that the TCA\u2019s resurrection of immunity and limitations on liability would supplement the defenses and limits imposed by the Act. Indeed, if this were so, the TCA would be in direct conflict with the Act insofar as the former provides unlimited liability, and the latter, if it were to apply to public entity hospitals, limits recovery to $250,000. <em>See N.J.SA </em>2A:53A-8.</p>\n<p id=\"b468-6\">We recognize that the defenses provided to a public entity under the TCA are not exclusive. <em>N.J.S.A </em>59:2-lb permits public entities to raise not only the tort immunities and defenses under the TCA, but also \u201cany defenses that would be available to the public entity if it were a private person.\u201d The <em>Graber </em>court relied on this provision in holding that the Act is one such defense, observing that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b468-7\">Pursuant to this section, courts have applied a wide range of statutory and common law defenses outside the Tort Claims Act to cases brought against public entities. <em>See e.g., Sykes v. Rutgers, </em>308 <em>N.J.Super. </em>265, 269-70, 705 A.2d 1241 (App.Div.1998) <em>and Davenport v. Borough of Closter, </em>294 <em>N.J.Super. </em>635, 639-42, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"437\">*437</page-number>684 A.2d 100 (App.Div.1996) (applying common law snow-removal immunity); <em>Del Tufo v. Township of Old Bridge, </em>278 <em>N.J.Super. </em>312, 319-323, 650 A.2d 1044 (App.Div.1995), <em>aff'd, </em>147 <em>N.J. </em>90, 685 A.2d 1267 (1996) (applying defense of contributory/comparative negligence); <em>Benjamin v.

In this ease, the immunity afforded under <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2A:53A-7 is available to Stockton as a nonprofit institution organized exclusively for educational purposes, even though it is also a public nonprofit college. <em>See also Tice v. Cramer, </em>133 <em>N.J. </em>347, 627 A.2d 1090 (1993) (stating that public entities are entitled to immunity both under the Tort Claims Act and as established at common law).</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b469-6\"><em>[Graber, supra, </em>313 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 486, 713 A.2d 503.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b469-7\">However, unlike the facts before us, in the cited cases there was no question that the scope of the pre-TCA immunity included public entities. <em>E.g., Tice v.
