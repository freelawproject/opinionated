On June 25, 1998, prior to publication of the <em>Interim Report of the State Police Review Team Regarding Allegations of Racial Profiling, </em>they were sentenced in accordance with the recommendation.</p>\n<p id=\"b586-8\">While their direct appeals were pending, defendant Chapman, subsequently joined by defendant Velez, moved to remand the case for further proceedings based on \u201cnewly discovered evidence of racial profiling.\u201d We denied the motion pending determination of the direct appeal. In the opinion on the direct appeal, we found no Fourth Amendment violation and that the CDS was found as a result of a valid consent to search. However, we permitted defendants to address the \u201cprofiling\u201d issue to this panel. <em>State v. Chapman, </em>332 <em>N.J.Super. </em>452, 457 n. 2, 471 n. 5, 753 A.2d 1179. Defendants now claim entitlement to pursue the issue and to discovery on the subject.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b586-9\">The critical issue before us is whether defendants can raise the profiling issue on direct appeal after the denial of their motion to suppress and a subsequent guilty plea. The State contends that they may not because defendants\u2019 guilty pleas constituted a waiver of the issue. The State further contends that, because <em>R. </em>3:5-7 concerns motions to suppress based on violations of the Fourth <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"555\">*555</page-number>Amendment, a \u201cprofiling\u201d claim raised therein would not be subject to preservation for appeal under <em>R. </em>3:5-7(d) as claims of \u201cprofiling\u201d or \u201cselective enforcement\u201d arise under the due process and equal protection clauses of the Fourteenth Amendment. <em>See State v. Ballard, </em>331 <em>N.J.Super. </em>529, 540-41, 752 A.2d 735 (App. Div.2000).</p>\n<p id=\"b587-6\">While we agree with the State that <em>R. </em>3:5-7 was adopted to address motions to suppress physical evidence obtained in violation of the Fourth Amendment, <em>see State v. Robinson, </em>224 <em>N.J.Super. </em>495, 498-504, 540 A.2d 1313 (App.Div.1988), \u201cprofiling\u201d claims also challenge stops, searches and seizures on constitutional grounds and have been raised incident to motions to suppress evidence obtained in violation of an allegedly unconstitutional stop, search or seizure. Thus, even though \u201cprofiling\u201d issues have their \u201croots in the equal protection and due process clauses [and] the claim of selective prosecution is somewhat foreign to Fourth Amendment interests and analysis,\u201d <em>State v. Kennedy, </em>247 <em>N.J.Super. </em>21, 29-30, 588 A.2d 834 (App.Div.1991), they have also been developed in New Jersey incident to motions to suppress under <em>R. </em>3:5-7. Indeed, in <em>State v. Smith, </em>306 <em>N.J.Super. </em>370, 703 A.2d 954 (App.Div.1997), this court considered both the denial of a request for discovery in support of a selective enforcement claim and the denial of a motion to suppress in an appeal following the entry of guilty pleas, and there was no suggestion advanced that defendants\u2019 guilty pleas constituted a waiver of the \u201cprofiling\u201d claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b587-7\"><em>R. </em>3:5-7 is also the vehicle for moving to suppress evidence unconstitutionally obtained in violation of the New Jersey Constitution, <em>N.J. Const, </em>art. I, H 7,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> and even if no Fourth Amendment issue is technically involved, a \u201cprofiling\u201d issue involves a claim of an unlawful search and seizure in violation of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"556\">*556</page-number>State Constitution cognizable under <em>R. </em>3:5-7. <em>See State v. Carty, </em>332 <em>N.J.Super. </em>200, 206-07, 753 A.2d 149 (App.Div.), <em>certif. granted, </em>165 <em>N.J. </em>605, 762 A.2d 219 (2000), holding that \u201carticulable suspicion is a necessary prerequisite under the New Jersey Constitution to requesting a consent to search after a routine stop for a traffic violation,\u201d and relying, in part, on the <em>Interim Report </em>in terms of the need and justification for the requirement. Thus, at least where the \u201cprofiling\u201d claim is asserted as part of the motion to suppress, it is preserved for consideration on appeal by virtue of <em>R. </em>3:5-7(d). We conclude that the \u201cprofiling\u201d issue is sufficiently raised in this case and that a remand is therefore in order for the Designated Judge hearing \u201cracial profiling\u201d claims to set the parameters of discovery. <em>See State v. Ballard, supra.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b588-5\">Generally, when a defendant voluntarily admits his or her guilt and acknowledges he or she has committed the crime, the plea constitutes a \u201cwaiver\u201d of all issues not preserved for appeal. <em>See, e.g., State v. Vasquez, </em>129 <em>N.J. </em>189, 194, 609 A.2d 29 (1992); <em>State v. Szemple </em>332 <em>N.J.Super. </em>322, 328-29, 753 A.2d 732 (App.Div.2000); <em>State v. Robinson, supra, </em>224 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 498, 540 A.2d 1313. However, certain rules permit defendants to preserve an issue for appeal without requiring him or her, or the State, to spend time and resources trying the case in order to preserve the issue for appeal. Hence, shortly after the United States Supreme Court decided <em>Lefkowitz v. Newsome, </em>420 <em>U.S. </em>283, 95 <em>S.Ct. </em>886, 43 <em>L.Ed.2d </em>196 (1975), our Supreme Court adopted <em>R. </em>3:5-7(d) which preserves for appeal issues rejected during a motion to suppress. <em>See State v. Robinson, supra, </em>224 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 499-501, 540 A.2d 1313.</p>\n<p id=\"b588-6\">The facts developed on the motion to suppress in this case were detailed in our prior opinion, 332 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 456-60, 753 A.2d 1179. Here, the factual assertions raised at the motion to suppress include claims that the request for a consent search was discriminately based on the trooper\u2019s discovery that the Velez brothers, passengers in the vehicle being driven by Chapman, were Colombians.</p>\n<p id=\"b589-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"557\">*557</page-number>The following was developed at the motion to suppress on the cross-examination of Trooper Ocentik by co-defendant Curran\u2019s attorney, after establishing that the Velez brothers were from Colombia and that the trooper \u201chad read a few books related to the Colombian drug cartels and had arrested Colombians for transportation or trafficking of narcotics about twenty times\u201d:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"ARX\">Q. When you turned to Trooper Hanley and said \u201cTwo Colombians,\u201d were you thinking at this point about the books you had read?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b589-6\">A. Yep, they quite possibly were in the back of my mind, yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b589-7\">Q. And were you thinking as well about the Colombians you had previously arrested in connection with narcotics trafficking?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b589-8\">A. Yeah. My past experiences are flashing by.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b589-9\">Q. Okay. So would it be fair to say then, Trooper, that at this point in time, at the point in time at which you observe and say to Trooper Hanley, \u201cTwo Colombians,\u201d drawing on your professional experience and your experience in reading these books about the Colombian drug cartels, your suspicions have become less general and more specific and you are now aiming more towards a narcotics investigation; is that fair to say?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b589-10\">A. Yeah, after I see Ruben sweating and he tells me he\u2019s from Colombia, yeah, that\u2019s fair to say.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b589-11\">And in his summation, counsel for defendant Chapman argued:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b589-12\">He\u2019s read books about Colombians, not about the wonderful culture of Colombia and its people, not about the music, not about the arts, not about their religion; about the drug cartel. One group of people within the race, and he admitted, Judge, on the stand under oath that it is possible that he does not doubt that when he learned that both Ruben and Roberto Velez were Colombians, that in his mind that book and the drug cartel came in mind. He thought about that, and that may have had an influence on his suspicions being further arisen or increased.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b589-13\">He acted on the basis that there were two whites, two Hispanics who happened to be from Colombia in New Jersey in a vehicle bearing California tags. Clearly, I submit to the Court, irrespective of his testimony, a profile consideration.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b589-14\">I submit to the Court it was based on the race of the two occupants in the back, and conduct by the government in that fashion, I submit to the Court, is a violation of their civil rights. And that was the motivating factor in all this inquiry that they now say resulted in the suspicion.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b589-15\">Hence, the \u201cprofiling\u201d issue, albeit technically constituting a claim of selective enforcement or selective prosecution, was sufficiently raised at the <em>R. </em>3:5-7 hearing and preserved under <em>R. </em>3:5-7(d), even though the proper vehicle for asserting a \u201cselective <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"558\">*558</page-number>enforcement\u201d or \u201cselective prosecution\u201d claim may generally be under <em>R. </em>3:10-2(c).<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b590-5\">Recently our Supreme Court \u201csummarily remand[ed]\u201d a matter for \u201creconsideration [of] the motions to suppress in connection with which the [Law Division was directed to] consider the \u2018Interim Report of the State Police Review Team Regarding Allegations of Racial Profiling published by the office of the Attorney General on April 20, 1999.\u201d <em>State v. Moore, </em>164 <em>N.J. </em>557, 753 A.2d 1151 (2000). We cannot tell from the Supreme Court\u2019s summary order itself if the case involved a claim of \u201cprofiling\u201d asserted for the first time on direct appeal. However, it is a published order of the Supreme Court, and we therefore obtained a copy of the petitions for certification filed by Moore and co-defendant Dickey.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> <em>See R. </em>1:36-3. <em>See also State v. Cruz Construction Co., </em>279 <em>N.J.Super. </em>241, 250, 652 A.2d 741 (App.Div.1995).</p>\n<p id=\"b590-6\">The State contends that <em>Moore </em>must be limited to reconsideration of defendant\u2019s Fourth Amendment claim and, at the most, to a re-evaluation of the trooper\u2019s testimony as it relates to that subject. The Supreme Court\u2019s remand in <em>Moore </em>for \u201creconsideration [of] the motion to suppress\u201d must have at least meant that the profiling material was relevant to the testing of defendants\u2019 Fourth Amendment claim. Here, the defendants assert that the evidence about profiling would be relevant to their Fourth Amendment claim. A remand for discovery is warranted on that basis alone. However, <em>Moore </em>cannot be read so narrowly.</p>\n<p id=\"b590-7\">Moore and Dickey had both challenged on their direct appeals the denial of their motions to suppress. Dickey argued that \u201cthe police\u2019s stop of defendant\u2019s vehicle was without objectively reasonable suspicion and violated defendant\u2019s rights under the Fourth <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"559\">*559</page-number>Amendment and the New Jersey Constitution.\u201d He also argued that \u201cthe police lacked valid consent to search the vehicle.\u201d Moore argued that \u201cthe trial court erred in denying defendant\u2019s motion to suppress.\u201d In our November 22, 1999 unpublished opinion, we summarily rejected all contentions, stating that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b591-6\">in the absence on the scene of an objection from defendants or the other occupant of the vehicle to the search of the jacket found in the car, it was objectively reasonable for the officer to conclude that the driver, Moore, had the apparent authority to consent to the search of the vehicle and its contents including the jacket.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b591-7\">We also noted that Dickey \u201crequested a remand for reconsideration of the suppression issue and to expand the record based on <em>State v. Soto, </em>(Law Div.1996 [published in 1999 at 324 <em>N.J.Super. </em>66, 734 A.2d 350])\u201d and a remand \u201cso that he may exercise discovery and seek to present and examine witnesses in an effort to establish a claim of selective enforcement of the traffic laws by the New Jersey State Police.\u201d However, \u201cwe [saw] nothing in <em>Soto, supra, </em>that would justify a remand.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b591-8\">In his petition for certification, Moore argued, among other things, that \u201cthe trial court erred in denying defendant\u2019s motion to suppress.\u201d Dickey argued the following:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b591-9\">POINT I THE STATE FAILED TO PRESENT CREDIBLE EVIDENCE TO SUPPORT THE STOP OF THE DEFENDANTS\u2019 AUTO. IN LIGHT OF THE ATTORNEY GENERAL\u2019S FINDINGS CONCERNING RACIAL PROFILING IT IS MORE LIKELY THAT DEFENDANTS WERE SINGLED OUT FOR A STOP AND CONSENT SEARCH BECAUSE THEY ARE AFRICAN-AMERICANS.

IV AND XIV; <em>N.J. CONST. </em>(1947), ART. I, PARAS. 1, 7.)</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b591-10\">A) Judge [M\u2019s] Credibility Finding Was Wrong And Should Not Be Permitted To Stand</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b591-11\">B) Judge [M\u2019s] Finding As To the Validity Of The Consent To [SJeareh Was Also Wrong</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b591-12\">C) Petitioner\u2019s Rights To Due Process And Equal Protection Were Infringed</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b591-13\">POINT II THE POLICE LACKED VALID CONSENT TO SEARCH THE VEHICLE</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b592-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"560\">*560</page-number>There can be no doubt, in light of <em>State v. Moore, supra, </em>that the Supreme Court did not limit the remand to consideration of Fourth Amendment issues. Hence, a defendant can raise a \u201cprofiling\u201d issue for the first time on direct appeal at least when, as here, the Interim Report was published after judgment was entered; and while <em>Moore </em>did not involve a guilty plea, a guilty plea does not constitute a waiver of a \u201cprofiling\u201d claim if it was raised or is related to a claim asserted at the motion to suppress.</p>\n<p id=\"b592-5\">Accordingly, the matter is remanded to the Designated Judge for consideration of the scope of discovery, and, thereafter, for further proceedings in Bergen County where the judgment of conviction was entered.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b586-10\"> Defendant Chapman did not file a supplementary brief on the profiling issue but without objection from the State participated at argument.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b587-8\"> In <em>State </em>v. <em>Johnson, </em>68 <em>N.J. </em>349, 353 n. 2, 346 A.2d 66 (1975), the Supreme Court stated that <em>\u201cR. </em>3:5-7, which establishes a procedure for the suppression of illegally seized evidence, applies to any search and seizure found to be unlawful, whether under federal or state law.\u201d <em>See also, e.g., State v.
