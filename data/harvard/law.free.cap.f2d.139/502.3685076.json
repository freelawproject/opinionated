Appellee filed the application for the registration of its mark on July 15, 1940. The word \u201cDesmond\u2019s\u201d was disclaimed apart from the mark shown in the drawing.</p>\n<p id=\"b566-30\">Appellant filed its notice of opposition to the registration of appellee\u2019s mark on November 13, 1940, alleging ownership of the registered mark above referred to, that the marks of the parties are confusingly similar, and prior use of its mark.</p>\n<p id=\"b566-31\">The answer of appellee denied all of the allegations of appellant\u2019s notice of opposition, and for further answer alleged in part as follows: \u201cAnd for further answer, applicant says that its trade mark \u2018Seasonaire\u2019 is so substantially different in appearance, in spelling, in sound and in significance or meaning from the mark \u2018Season Skipper\u2019 claimed by opposer, that they can and are used <em>onestly </em>and concurrently in trade without any reasonable likelihood of confusion. The word \u2018Aire\u2019 is the predominant part of applicant\u2019s mark <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"503\">*503</page-number>and the word \u2018Skipper is the predominant part of opposer\u2019s mark. * * *\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b567-5\">Both parties took testimony.</p>\n<p id=\"b567-6\">The Examiner of .Interferences held that the goods of the parties are in part identical, and all possess the same descriptive properties; that the marks of the parties are confusingly similar; that appellant is entitled to September 21, 1939, for first use of its mark, that being the date of its application for registration as aforesaid; and that appellee had not established use of its mark prior to said last named date.</p>\n<p id=\"b567-7\">The Examiner of Interferences in his decision stated as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b567-8\">\u201cThe goods of the parties are, in part, identical and are deemed clearly to possess the same descriptive properties.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b567-9\">\u201cWith regard to the marks, applicant contends that the disclaimed name \u2018Desmond\u2019s\u2019 associated with the notation \u2018Seasonaire\u2019 is the dominant feature. That the notation \u2018Seasonaire\u2019 alone is capable of denoting origin and would be primarily relied upon by many purchasers for this purpose is believed evidenced by the advertisements introduced in evidence by the applicant (Exhibits 6a, 6b, 6c, 7) in which the notation is separately displayed and also in the fact that the woven labels for \u2018Seasonaire\u2019 are separate from those bearing the applicant\u2019s name (Exhibit 5). California Prune &amp; Apricot Growers Association, Inc., v. Dobry [Flour] Mills, 101 F.2d 838 [26 C.C.P.A., Patents, 910] 40 [U.S.] P.Q. 616.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b567-10\">\u201cThe dominant feature of the mark sought to be registered and that relied upon by the opposer each commence with the term \u2018Season\u2019. Considering the marks as a whole it is believed that their resemblances, particularly in sound, predominate over their differences at least to an extent that there is reasonable doubt, on the question of likelihood of confusion in trade.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b567-11\">Opon a motion by appellee for reconsideration, the Examiner of Interferences adhered to his original decision and further stated: \u201cA further consideration of the record discloses that Registration No. 337,140, a copy of which is found in the record (paper No. 11), issued in the name of the opposer and discloses a mark having as the dominant feature thereof the notation \u2018Season Skipper,\u2019 the same as that here relied upon, for use in connection with \u2018men\u2019s overcoats and topcoats.\u2019 This registration issued prior to the earliest date established by the applicant and is deemed to be a statutory bar to issuance of a registration upon the application involved herein.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b567-13\">Upon appeal the commissioner was of the opinion that the marks of the parties are not confusingly similar, and therefore reversed the decision of the Examiner of Interferences.</p>\n<p id=\"b567-14\">In his decision the commissioner said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b567-15\">\u201cIt is my opinion, however, that the opposition should have been dismissed because of the dissimilarity of the marks.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"A8V\">*****</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b567-16\">\u201cApplicant, however, is not seeking to register the word \u2018Seasonaire\u2019 alone. The mark of the application is \u2018Desmond\u2019s Seasonaire,\u2019 and for the purpose of this proceeding it must be presumed that applicant will use the mark as registered. Lucien Lelong, Inc., v. Elgin American Manufacturing Co., 83 F.2d 690, 23 C.C.P.A. [Patents] 1139. And though the word \u2018Desmond\u2019s\u2019 is disclaimed, it is never-the-less a part of applicant\u2019s mark, and must be considered in determining the question of confusing similarity between the marks as a whole.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b567-17\">It is our opinion that the dominant part of appellee\u2019s mark is the notation \u201cSeasonaire\u201d and that the commissioner did not sufficiently consider evidence introduced by appellee in that regard.</p>\n<p id=\"b567-18\">Appellee\u2019s principal business is in the city of Los Angeles, California, and vicinity. It also makes sales of its goods in adjacent states. It advertised its goods extensively in the Los Angeles newspapers.</p>\n<p id=\"b567-19\">Appellee introduced in evidence as Exhibit 6a, an advertisement appearing in the April 27, 1939, issue of the Los Angeles Examiner. At the head of this advertisement there appears the following: \u201c *Seasonaire Another Desmond Discovery for Southern California.\u201d The star before the notation indicates a footnote at the bottom of the advertisement, which reads as follows : \u201cA trade-mark name registered exclusively by Desmond\u2019s.\u201d Nowhere in this advertisement is the notation \u201cSeasonaire\u201d connected with the word \u201cDesmond\u2019s\u201d but appellee\u2019s customers were informed that appellee\u2019s mark was \u201cSeasonaire.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b567-20\">In the issue of the Los Angeles Examiner of May 2, 1940, appears another <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"504\">*504</page-number>advertisement introduced in evidence as Appellee\u2019s Exhibit 6c. This advertisement is also headed by the notation \u201cSeasonaire,\u201d and the only mention of \u201cDesmond\u2019s\u201d appears at the bottom of the advertisement, as follows: \u201cLet\u2019s go to Desmond\u2019s.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b568-4\">In another advertisement in the same paper of July 4, 1940, Appellee\u2019s Exhibit B, the notation \u201cSeasonaire\u201d appears in describing a particular suit of clothes, but the only reference to the word \u201cDesmond\u2019s\u201d is at the bottom of the advertisement, reading: \u201cLet\u2019s go to Desmond\u2019s.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b568-5\">From these advertisements it is clear that the public was not informed that the word of \u201cDesmond\u2019s\u201d was a part of appellee\u2019s mark. On the contrary, appellee\u2019s customers were led to believe therefrom that appellee\u2019s mark was \u201cSeasonaire,\u201d standing alone.</p>\n<p id=\"b568-6\">The foregoing is in harmony with the answer of appellee to appellant\u2019s notice of opposition wherein,' as hereinbefore noted, appellee alleged that its trade-mark is \u201cSeasonaire,\u201d and that \u201cThe word \u2018Aire\u2019 is the predominant part of. applicant\u2019s mark.\u201d Another important circumstance to be considered is that separate woven labels were attached to appellee\u2019s goods, one consisting of the notation \u201cSeasonaire,\u201d alone, and the other consisting of the words \u201cDesmond\u2019s Southern California.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b568-7\">We would also observe that one of the labels filed by appellee with its application consists of the notation \u201cSeasonaire\u201d standing alone.</p>\n<p id=\"b568-8\">In view of the foregoing, it is our opinion that the commissioner placed undue weight upon the \u201cword \u201cDesmond\u2019s\u201d in the mark as applied for, because clearly appellee, by its own conduct, had made the notation \u201cSeasonaire,\u201d the dominant part of its mark. The commissioner, in his decision as hereinbefore quoted, held that, it must be presumed that appellee will use the mark as registered. This is true in the absence of testimony to the contrary but, even so, for the reasons aforesaid, the dominant part of appellee\u2019s mark is \u201cSeasonaire,\u201d a fact which the commissioner apparently overlooked.</p>\n<p id=\"b568-9\">The Examiner of Interferences, in arriving at his decision, cited our decision in the case of California Prune &amp; Apricot Growers Ass\u2019n v. Dobry Flour Mills, Inc., 101 F.2d 838, 840, 26 C.C.P.A., Patents, 910. In that case the appellee registered the mark \u201cDobry\u2019s Sunsweet,\u201d for wheat flour. The appellant filed a petition for cancellation alleging prior use of the mark \u201cSunsweet\u201d applied to fresh, dried, and canned fruits. The commissioner, reversing a decision of the Examiner of Interferences, had held that the petition for cancellation should be dismissed. In reversing his decision we said: \u201cWe have no hesitation in holding that the marks of the parties are confusingly similar, and that appellant has been damaged by the registration of appellee\u2019s mark. To hold otherwise would make it possible for one to appropriate a trade-mark which, through extensive advertising, had become a household word, by adding thereto the name of an individual. Many others might do likewise and the value of the trade-mark <em>to </em>the first adopter and user might be largely destroyed.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b568-11\">Appellee, in the case at bar, cited our decision in the case of Tetley &amp; Co., Inc., v. Bay State Fishing Co., 82 F.2d 299, 23 C.C.P.A., Patents, 969, to the point that appellee\u2019s mark must be considered as a whole, and it contends that when so considered there is no confusing similarity between its and appellant\u2019s mark.</p>\n<p id=\"b568-12\">We considered the case last above cited in the California Prune &amp; Apricot Growers Association case, supra, [101 F. 2d 838, 839] and in our decision stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b568-13\">\u201cThe commissioner relied largely upon our decision in the case of Tetley &amp; Co., Inc. v. Bay State Fishing Co., 82 F.2d 299, 23 C.C.P.A., Patents, 969, wherein it was held that the marks \u2018Budget Special,\u2019 applied to fish, and \u2018Tetley Budget Tea,\u2019 applied to tea, the words \u2018Special\u2019 and \u2018Tea\u2019 being disclaimed, were not confusingly similar. The commissioner quoted from our opinion wherein we said: \u2018In considering the mark of the opposer, the name \u201cTetley\u201d is to be given as much force and effect as any other part of the mark.\u2019 We think that, properly construed, this expression does not imply that every word in a mark is to be given the same force and effect as any other part of the mark. It is well established that one word or feature of a mark may be the dominant portion thereof, and be given greater force and effect than other parts of the mark in determining confusing similarity between it and another mark used upon goods of the same descriptive properties. Balti<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"505\">*505</page-number>more Paint &amp; Color Works v. Bennett Glass &amp; Paint Co., 40 F.2d 1009, 17 C.C.P.A., Patents, 1269.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b569-5\">\u201cThere is no conflict between this rule and the equally well-established rule that, in determining the question of confusing similarity between marks, they must be considered in their entirety.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b569-6\">It follows from the foregoing that it is our opinion that the Examiner of Interferences was right in holding that the marks of the parties here involved are confusingly similar. It appears from the evidence that appellee\u2019s business is conducted through retail stores owned by it in the city of Los Angeles and towns in the vicinity thereof. Through its advertising it had informed its customers that its trade-mark was \u201cSeasonaire,\u201d and that notation would be remembered by its customers, and would be regarded by them as appellee\u2019s mark. We can hardly conceive of a case where a party could, by its own conduct, more clearly have made a part of a mark the dominating portion thereof. This being true, we hold that the public would be likely to be confused in seeing attached to goods the respective marks, or hearing the oral use of the marks over the radio or in conversation.</p>\n<p id=\"b569-7\">One other question remains for consideration. Appellee contends that upon the record before us it must be held that appellee had used its mark \u201cDesmond\u2019s Seasonaire\u201d prior to any use shown by appellant of its mark. Appellant, as hereinbefore noted, alleged in its notice of opposition ownership of its mark registered on February 13, 1940, upon an application filed September 21, 1939. It also alleged use of its mark since long prior to 1939, but it introduced no evidence upon this subject; hence it is entitled to first use of its mark only from the date of its application, September 21, 1939.</p>\n<p id=\"b569-8\">Upon the question of first use by appellee of its mark, the Examiner of Interferences, in his decision, stated: \u201cWith regard to the question of priority, testimony submitted in behalf of applicant is conflicting and ambiguous in regard to the date of first use on garments sold in trade. For example, applicant\u2019s buyer stated that the mark was first used on clothing January 1, 1940 (Skinner, Q. 20), whereas its advertising manager states that the label (Exhibit 5) has been used \u2018continuously since March 1939\u2019 (Westmoreland, Q. 14). However, as the invoice for the woven labels bears the date January 12, 1940 and they were not used until the Spring of 1940 (Skinner, Q. 36), the testimony is deemed insufficient to establish a date of use prior to the earliest date to which the opposer is here entitled, viz., September 21, 1939, the filing date of the application which matured into the above identified registration.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b569-10\">It appears from the evidence that the first use by appellee of woven labels bearing the notations of \u201cDesmond\u2019s Southern California,\u201d and \u201cSeasonaire,\u201d respectively, was in 1940.</p>\n<p id=\"b569-11\">One of appellee\u2019s witnesses testified that these woven labels had been used since March 1939, but as it appears from the record that these labels were ordered on December 26, 1939, and were received on January 12, 1940, it seems clear that the witness was mistaken as to the date of first use of the woven labels.</p>\n<p id=\"b569-12\">There is also some evidence that a cardboard slip containing the word \u201cSeasonaire\u201d attached to appellee\u2019s goods was used by appellee prior to September 21, 1939. This cardboard slip was introduced in evidence as appellee\u2019s Exhibit 1. At the top of this slip appears the word \u201cDesmond\u2019s\u201d and also at the bottom thereof. About an inch below the word \u201cDesmond\u2019s\u201d found at the top of the slip appears the notation \u201cSeasonaire,\u201d and about an inch and a half below said notation appears a description of men\u2019s clothing, below which again appears the word \u201cDesmond\u2019s.\u201d We find nothing in this exhibit to indicate that appellee\u2019s trade-mark was \u201cDesmond\u2019s Seasonaire,\u201d but it indicates that as advertised the mark was \u201cSeasonaire\u201d applied to goods sold by Desmond\u2019s.</p>\n<p id=\"b569-13\">Clearly appellee may not rely upon the use of the notation \u201cSeasonaire\u201d standing alone to establish prior use of the mark applied for, viz., \u201cDesmond\u2019s Seasonaire.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b569-14\">Appellant introduced certain testimony with relation to some experimental tests which it claims should be considered as bearing upon the question of confusing similarity of the respective marks.</p>\n<p id=\"b569-15\">In view of our conclusion hereinbefore stated that the marks of the parties are confusingly similar, irrespective of said testimony, it is ttnnecessary for us to consider the question of its competency.</p>\n<p id=\"b570-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"506\">*506</page-number>For the reasons stated, we are in agreement with the decision of the Examiner of Interferences that appellant\u2019s notice of opposition should be sustained and the decision of the commissioner is reversed.</p>\n<p id=\"b570-4\">Reversed.</p>\n<judges id=\"b570-5\">BLAND, Associate Judge, concurs , in the conclusion.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
