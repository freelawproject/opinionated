The prisoner violated this by committing burglary in the first degree on the 11th of December, following. Under the circumstances it is not felt that the Board would be justified in reducing the sentence imposed.</p>\n<judges id=\"ADdK\">SENTENCE REVIEW DIVISION</judges>\n<judges id=\"A0Z\">Victor H.
