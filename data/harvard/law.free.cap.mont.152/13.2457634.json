While it is true that the thefts were of consequence and perhaps the sentences were justified, nevertheless the Division, with some reluctance, is of the opinion that the absence of a prior record should be considered and the sentence adjusted as directed.</p>\n<judges id=\"AqhW\">SENTENCE REVIEW DIVISION</judges>\n<judges id=\"Avkm\">Victor H.
