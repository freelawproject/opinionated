He is now 51 years of age and has served about 14% years. In view of the absence of a previous record, the total of the 3 sentences appears to be unusually long. This, combined with his age, the time he has served, and his record of good conduct in the Prison, make it appear reasonable to reduce his last sentence as directed.</p>\n<judges id=\"A_Rl\">SENTENCE REVIEW DIVISION</judges>\n<judges id=\"AsBt\">Victor H.
