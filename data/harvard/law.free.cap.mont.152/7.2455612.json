Additionally, the State of Nevada has filed a detainer against the prisoner and it further appears that his prison record states that he is very dependable and responsible, that his work i's superior, and his general conduct is excellent.</p>\n<judges id=\"Ae\">SENTENCE REVIEW DIVISION</judges>\n<judges id=\"AEDS\">Victor H.
