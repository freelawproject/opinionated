It appears that he has been dealt with quite leniently in the past but in view of his extensive record the Board is of the opinion that his sentence should not be reduced. He will be eligible for parole in August of 1968.</p>\n<judges id=\"AsH\">SENTENCE REVIEW DIVISION</judges>\n<judges id=\"A3E\">Victor H. Fall, chairman; Philip Duncan, Sid G.
