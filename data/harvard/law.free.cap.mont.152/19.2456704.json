He has been in prison only since November 28, 1967 and has not yet been there long enough for any valuable evaluation of adjustment. He will be eligible for parole consideration in November of 1968 and under these circumstances it is not felt the Board should reduce the present sentence.</p>\n<judges id=\"A4rb\">SENTENCE REVIEW DIVISION</judges>\n<judges id=\"AES\">Victor H.
