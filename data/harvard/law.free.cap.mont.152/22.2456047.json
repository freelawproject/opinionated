It would appear that his present sentence was very moderate considering his past record. His adjustment at the prison appears to be excellent but the Board is of the opinion that his present sentence should not be reduced. He will be eligible for parole consideration in August of 1969.</p>\n<judges id=\"AqL\">SENTENCE REVIEW DIVISION</judges>\n<judges id=\"AGfd\">Victor H. Fall, chairman; Philip C. Duncan, Paul G.
