There was a finding for the defendant and plaintiff claimed a report.</p>\n<p id=\"b182-9\"><em>There was evidence that </em>about the middle of November, 1957, the plaintiff left his room in a rooming house, to enter a hospital. He had not paid his rent for the previous five or six weeks and did not notify the landlady of his leaving. The landlady, after consultation with his brother and sister, removed his personal property from the room and attempted to notify the plaintiff by leaving a note on Ms door. The day the plaintiff left, she saw another man in the plaintiff\u2019s room, who told her the plaintiff said he could get in anytime. The plaintiff later claimed a footlocker was missing.</p>\n<p id=\"b182-10\">The report states: \u201cAfter the plaintiff re<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"177\">*177</page-number>turned from the hospital, sometime in December, 1957, the landlady testified that she returned all the goods that she had taken, to the plaintiff; that she gave some. . .to the plaintiff personally and she gave others to. . .Joe Young. . .as agent for the plaintiff.

Hurley suggested he discuss it with his landlady. The plaintiff said he would. Plaintiff never notified the police of the alleged loss.</p>\n<p id=\"b183-8\">In September, 1958, plaintiff\u2019s attorney, gave Hurley \u201ca list of articles which were allegedly stolen.\u201d Hurley sent the list to the defendant\u2019s claim manager. October 2, 1958, a form entitled \u201cNotice of loss\u201d was sent to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"178\">*178</page-number>plaintiff\u2019s attorney who returned it October 30, 1958.</p>\n<p id=\"b184-5\">The policy insured against loss by theft or mysterious disappearance and required \u201cnotice\u201d as soon as practicable, notice to the police, and a <em>\u2018 \u2018 </em>detailed proof of loss, duly sworn to. . .within sixty days after the discovery of the loss.\u201d \u201cThe policy also states that no action shall lie against the company, unless as a condition precedent thereto, there shall have been full compliance with all of the terms of this endorsement...\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b184-6\">The Court allowed all the plaintiff\u2019s requests for rulings. \u201cThe plaintiff claiming to be aggrieved by the finding for the defendant in the light of the evidence and the granting of plaintiff\u2019s requests for rulings\u201d the case was reported to the Appellate Division.</p>\n<p id=\"b184-7\">3 There was no error.
