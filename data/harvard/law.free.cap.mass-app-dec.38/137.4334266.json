The defendant who claimed a report, pleaded that the transaction was illegal because prohibited by provisions of the Securities and Exchange Act of 1934, as amended. Illegality is the only issue presented to us.</p>\n<p id=\"b144-10\">The reported evidence shows that the plaintiff was an \u201caccount executive\u201d employed by Walston and Company, (Walston) a firm engaged in the business of buying and seling <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"139\">*139</page-number>securities. The defendant was a customer of Walston\u2019s and a friend of the plaintiff\u2019s. For several years prior to 1960 the defendant purchased securities from Walston, frequently upon the advice or recommendation of the plaintiff. In this period he suffered a loss of between $5,000.00 and $8,000.00.</p>\n<p id=\"b145-5\">In December of 1960 the defendant ordered from Walston the purchase of shares of stock in a company described only as \u201cTT.S. Chemical and Milling\u201d.</p>\n<p id=\"b145-6\">About the same time the plaintiff gave the defendant two checks totalling $2,127.00, the exact amount of the purchase price of the shares of this stock. The proceeds of these checks, we assume, although it does not appear in the report, were used to pay Walston. Nothing has been paid the plaintiff by the defendant. The trial judge in his special findings found the transaction to be a legal loan and assessed damages in the amount of $2,127.00.</p>\n<p id=\"b145-7\">A provision of the Securities and Exchange Act, 15 IT.S.C. \u00a7 78g (c) prohibits a security broker or dealer such as Walston to directly or indirectly \u201cextend or maintain credit\u201d for any customer \u2014 (1) \u201cOn any security... <em>.registered on a national securities exchange </em>(emphasis supplied) in contraventiono f the rules and regulations which the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System shall prescribe. . .\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b145-8\">An \u201cexchange\u201d is defined in the <em>Act 15 U.S.C.A. s. 78c (a) (1) </em>as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b146-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"140\">*140</page-number>\u201cThe term \u2018exchange\u2019 means any organization, association, or group of persons, whether incorporated or unincorporated, which constitutes, maintains, or provides a market place or facilities for bringing together purchases and sellers of securities or for otherwise performing with respect to securities the functions commonly performed by a stock exchange as that term is generally understood, and includes the market place and the market facilities maintained by such exchange.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"ApI\">Wyzanski, J. in <em>Remar </em>v. <em>Clayton Securities Cooperation, </em>81 F. Supp. 1014, quoting from a Congressional Report, said the purpose of the Securities and Exchange Act was to provide \u201can effective method of reducing the aggregate amount oft he nation\u2019s credit resources which can be reducing the aggregate amount of the nation\u2019s credit resources which can be directed by speculation into the stock market\u201d and as a. by-product to make it impossible for the small speculator \u201cto spread himself too thin speculator\u201d.</p>\n<p id=\"b146-5\">The margin and borrowing restrictions promulgated by the Governors of the Federal Reserve System, which, for the purposes of this case we consider to be a matter of common knowledge, would seem to prohibit, if applicable, the transaction under consideration.</p>\n<p id=\"AMq_n\">But there was no evidence introduced tending to show that the shares of stock of U.S. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"141\">*141</page-number>Chemical and Milling were \u201cregistered on a national securities exchange\u201d. Having asserted illegality it was incumbent on the defendant to establish all the essential facts to show the transaction was prohibited.</p>\n<attorneys id=\"b147-6\">Samuel A.
