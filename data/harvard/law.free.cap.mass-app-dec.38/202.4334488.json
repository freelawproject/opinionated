The furniture consisted of a two piece sofa bed set; a chair recliner; two step tables and a cocktail table. After a trial there was a finding for the plaintiff and the defendant claimed a report.</p>\n<p id=\"b209-5\">The trial judge made the following findings of fact: \u201cI find that the plaintiff when a minor and engaged to be married, paid $235.00 to the defendant in partial payment of a living room set of furniture. Upon the engagement being broken three weeks later, the plaintiff dis-affirmed the contract. I find he disaffirmed the contract within a reasonable time and that it was not a contract for necessaries.\u201d There was no error, and there is no need of discussing the judge\u2019s actions on the defendant\u2019s requests for rulings of law.\u201d <em>Cadigan </em>v. <em>Strand Garage, Inc., </em>351 Mass. 703.</p>\n<p id=\"b209-6\">The report is to be dismissed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
