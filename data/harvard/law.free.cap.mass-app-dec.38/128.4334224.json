The defendant claimed a report. The only issue argued is whether the evidence was sufficient to warrant a finding that the defendant was the operator or owner of a motor vehicle that was in collision with the motor vehicle of the plaintiff\u2019s.</p>\n<p id=\"b135-10\">The reported evidence shows that on December 28, 1963, the plaintiff in the early morning, while it was still dark, snowing, and the wind blowing was operating his car on a state highway in Agawam, Massachusetts. It collided with the defendant motor vehicle that was parked at an angle so that a portion of its rear extended into the plaintiff\u2019s travel lane. The plaintiff was injured and his car damaged. We <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"130\">*130</page-number>quote from the report questions put to the plaintiff by his attorney and his answers.</p>\n<attorneys id=\"b136-11\">Ross and Ross of Springfield for the Plaintiff.</attorneys>\n<attorneys id=\"b136-13\">Robert E. Athas of Waltham for the Defendant.</attorneys>\n<p id=\"b136-5\">Q. \u201cAfter the accident did someone come over to you and talk to you?\u201d A. \u201cYes\u201d.</p>\n<p id=\"b136-6\">Q. \u201cWhat did he say to you?\u201d A. \u201cHe said that he was Mr. JaMonski.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b136-7\">The plaintiff asked him, \u201cHow come your car is parked in the road?\u201d He said <em>11 </em>My gasoline froze \u2019 \u2019.</p>\n<p id=\"b136-8\">Ho other evidence appears in the report as to the identify of the defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b136-9\">We have held this day in <em>Varisco </em>v. <em>Malovin, </em>District Court of Springfield, #180308, on similar facts, that the evidence was insufficient to warrant a finding that the defendant was the owner or operator involved in a collision with the plaintiff\u2019s motor vehicle. Hothing is to be gained by repeating our reasoning as set forth in that decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b136-10\">It was error to deny the defendant\u2019s request for a ruling on this issue. The finding for the plaintiff is to be vacated and judgment is ordered for the defendant.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
