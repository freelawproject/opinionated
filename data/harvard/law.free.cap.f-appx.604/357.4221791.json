R.App. P. 38 is GRANTED for the following reasons.</p>\n<p id=\"b1015-21\">Appellant Derek Wyatt (\u201cWyatt\u201d) challenges the bankruptcy court\u2019s order granting Appellee Mary McAlister\u2019s (\u201cMcAlis-ter\u201d) motion for sanctions pursuant to the court\u2019s inherent authority. While a state court judicial dissolution of their law firm \u2014 Wyatt &amp; McAlister, P.L.L.C. (\u201cW &amp; M\u201d) \u2014 was pending, Wyatt filed a bankruptcy petition for W &amp; M. Wyatt falsely asserted he had the authority to do so. \u25a0When it learned that Wyatt did not have such authority, the bankruptcy court granted McAlister\u2019s motion to dismiss. Though the bankruptcy court made clear that Wyatt had no authority to pursue the entity\u2019s bankruptcy without McAlister\u2019s agreement, Wyatt continued to press the issue with frivolous arguments. He filed a motion for a new trial, and when that was denied, appealed the dismissal to the district court, which affirmed the bankruptcy court and remanded for the consideration of sanctions. The bankruptcy court determined that the petition was filed to affect state court litigation and that Wyatt had acted in bad faith. The district court affirmed the sanctions.</p>\n<p id=\"b1015-22\">We GRANT McAlister\u2019s motions to dismiss for damages under Fed. RApp. P. 38, because Wyatt has filed a frivolous appeal. \u201cAn appeal is frivolous if the result is obvious or the arguments of error are wholly without merit.\u201d <em>Coghlan v. Starkey, </em>852 F.2d 806, 811 (5th Cir.1988). A brief worthy of sanctions \u201cfails to argue any case law, makes hardly any attempt to distinguish precedents relied upon below, argues the merits in the most conclusory fashion, and offers no independent legal <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"986\">*986</page-number>analysis different from that decisively rejected by the district court....\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 809. With the exception of one section that he removed, Wyatt\u2019s brief is identical to the one he presented to the district court. Nearly all of his arguments are unsupported by Fifth Circuit case law and he presents no explanation why the bankruptcy court\u2019s bad faith findings were incorrect. Consequently, the result in this case \u2014 that the bankruptcy court did not abuse its discretion \u2014 must be a foregone conclusion. Accordingly, we sanction Wyatt by awarding McAlister reasonable attorney\u2019s fees of $5,000 together with costs incurred in connection with this appeal.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b1015-19\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
