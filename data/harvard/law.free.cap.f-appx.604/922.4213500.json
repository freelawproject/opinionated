On appeal, Blue argues that he was improperly sentenced as a career offender under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4Bl.l(a) because his two prior convictions under section 893.13(1) of the Florida Statutes were not \u201ccontrolled substance offenses\u201d within the meaning of the career offender provision. Blue argues that a prior conviction can only be a \u201ccontrolled substance offense\u201d if it is \u201csubstantially similar\u201d to the federal drug trafficking definition. Unlike federal law, his convictions under section 893.13(1) did not have a mens rea element, so they could not be \u201ccontrolled substance offenses.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b951-5\">We review <em>de novo </em>the district court\u2019s decision to classify a defendant as a career offender under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4B1.1. <em>United States v. Gibson, </em>434 F.3d 1234, 1243 (11th Cir.2006). A prior panel\u2019s holding is binding on all subsequent panels unless and until it is overruled or undermined to the point of abrogation by the Supreme Court or by this Court sitting <em>en banc. United States v. Archer, </em>531 F.3d 1347, 1352 (11th Cir.2008).</p>\n<p id=\"b951-6\">A defendant is a career offender if, among other things, he has at least two prior felony convictions for a controlled substance offense. U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4Bl.l(a). A \u201ccontrolled substance offense\u201d</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b951-7\">means an offense under federal or state law, punishable by imprisonment for a-term exceeding one year, that prohibits the manufacture, import, export, distribution, or dispensing of a controlled substance (or a counterfeit substance) or the possession of a controlled substance (or a counterfeit substance) with intent to manufacture, import, export, distribute, or dispense.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b951-9\"><em>Id. </em>\u00a7 4B1.2(b).</p>\n<p id=\"b951-10\">Florida law punishes the sale, manufacture, delivery, or possession with intent to sell, manufacture, or deliver, of cocaine as a second-degree felony. <em>See </em>Fla. Stat. \u00a7 893.13(l)(a)(l). Doing the same within 1000 feet of a school is a first-degree felony, and doing .the same with marijuana within 1000 feet of a school is a second-degree felony. <em>See id. </em>\u00a7 893.13(l)(e)(l)-(2). First-degree felonies are punishable by up to 30 years\u2019 imprisonment, <em>id. </em>\u00a7 775.082(3)(b)(l); second-degree felonies are punishable by up to 15 years\u2019 imprisonment, <em>id. </em>\u00a7 775.082(3)(d).</p>\n<p id=\"b951-11\">We have previously determined that a conviction under section 893.13(1) is a \u201ccontrolled substance offense\u201d under \u00a7 4B1.2(b) in <em>United States v. Smith, </em>775 F.3d 1262, 1267-68 (2014).</p>\n<p id=\"b951-12\">As Blue recognizes, his arguments are foreclosed by <em>Smith. </em>Here, Blue was properly sentenced as a career offender because his prior marijuana and cocaine convictions were offenses under state law, punishable by a term of imprisonment exceeding one year,-and concerned the distribution or dispensing, or possession with intent to distribute or dispense, of a controlled substance. <em>See Smith, </em>775 F.3d at 1267-68; <em>see also </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4B1.2(b). We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b951-13\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
