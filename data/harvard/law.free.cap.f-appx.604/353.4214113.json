HIGGINSON, Circuit Judge: <footnotemark>*</footnotemark></author>\n<p id=\"b381-20\">Daniel Nunez appeals the sentence imposed following his guilty plea conviction for conspiracy to possess with intent to distribute more than 1,000 kilograms of marijuana in violation of 21 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 841(a)(1) and 846 (Count One), and conspiracy to launder monetary instruments in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1956(a)(2)(A) and (h) (Count Two). '</p>\n<p id=\"b381-21\">First, Nunez contends that the rationale in <em>Crawford v. Washington, </em>541 U.S. 36, 124 S.Ct. 1354, 158 L.Ed.2d 177 (2004), applies to the sentencing phase of a criminal prosecution and, thus, his Sixth Amendment right of confrontation was violated when the district court enhanced his sentence based on the Government\u2019s ex parte examinations and interviews, the probation officer\u2019s ex parte investigation, and information not disclosed in the pre-sentence report (PSR). Contrary to Nunez\u2019s contention, <em>Crawford </em>does not extend a defendant\u2019s confrontation rights to sentencing proceedings. <em>United States v. Beydoun, </em>469 F.3d 102, 108 (5th Cir.2006). The information .in the PSR was obtained from debriefings of cooperating sources and co-conspirators, surveillance operations, consensual monitored telephone conversations, wire intercepts, and multiple interviews with the agent in charge of the investigation. Thus, the PSR was supported by an adequate evidentiary basis with sufficient indicia of reliability. <em>See United States v. Fuentes, </em>775 F.3d 213, 220 (5th Cir.2014); <em>United States v. Gaytan, </em>74 F.3d 545, 557-58 (5th Cir.1996). Aside from denying that he was responsible for some of the marijuana loads attributed to him in the PSR and arguing that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"354\">*354</page-number>the U.S. Sentencing Guidelines Manual (\u201cU.S.S.G\u201d) \u00a7 2Dl.l(b) enhancements did not apply, Nunez did not present any rebuttal evidence to demonstrate that the information in the PSR was materially untrue, inaccurate, or unreliable. Therefore, the district court was free to adopt the PSR\u2019s findings without further inquiry or explanation. <em>See Fuentes, </em>775 F.3d at 220.</p>\n<p id=\"b382-4\">Nunez contends that \u201c[t]he unfairness of the process was exacerbated in this case by the court considering information, relating to the increases to the base offense level suggested by the Prob\u00e1tion Office, that was not contained in the PSI, and was not available to counsel for the Defendant prior to the hearing.\u201d Specifically, Nunez points to the fact that the district court applied a two-level increase pursuant to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2Dl.l(b)(12) based in part on Nunez\u2019s involvement with the Hargill stash house. While Nunez correctly notes that the PSR based the \u00a7 2Dl.l(b)(12) enhancement on Nunez\u2019s involvement with a different stash house, the PSR also provided that Nunez and the Nunez drug trafficking organization maintained several stash houses, including one in Hargill, Texas, as discussed at sentencing without objection based on inadequate notice. Accordingly, we find no merit to Nunez\u2019s contention that this information was not contained in the PSR.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b382-5\">Finally, Nunez contends that the district court violated the Ex Post Facto Clause when it enhanced his sentence under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2Dl.l(b)(12) and (b)(14)(E) because the enhancements did not go into effect until the November 2011 version of the Sentencing Guidelines. Because Nunez did not raise this argument in the district court, plain error review applies. <em>See United States v. Castillo-Estevez, </em>597 F.3d 238, 240 (5th Cir.2010).</p>\n<p id=\"b382-8\">The enhancements at issue became effective on November 1, 2010. <em>See Guidelines Manual, Supp. to Appendix C-Vol. III, </em>Amendment 748, pp. 374-75, 385 (Nov. 1, 2011); <em>Supplement to the 2010 Guidelines Manual, </em>\u00a7 2Dl.l(b)(12), (b)(14)(E). The conspiracies to which Nunez pleaded guilty covered the time period between August 2009 and February 6, 2012. Because the last overt conspiratorial act occurred after the November 1, 2010, effective date of the amendments to \u00a7 2D1.1, the district court\u2019s application of \u00a7 2Dl.l(b)(12) and (b)(14)(E) did not violate the Ex Post Facto Clause. <em>See Peugh v. United States, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 133 S.Ct. 2072, 2082-83, 186 L.Ed.2d 84 (2013); <em>United States v. Olis, </em>429 F.3d 540, 545 (5th Cir.2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b382-11\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b381-18\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b382-6\">. Nunez cites no caselaw and provides no legal argument to support his claim that the district court should have provided him notice that it was going to base the sentencing enhancement on the Hargill property. <em>See </em>Fed. R.App. P. 28(a) (\"The appellant\u2019s brief must contain ... appellant\u2019s contentions and the reasons for them, <em>with citations to the authorities </em>and parts of the record on which the appellant relies.\u201d (emphasis added)); <em>United States v. Beaumont, </em>972 F.2d 553, 563 (5th Cir.1992) (\"Failure of an appellant to properly argue or present issues in an appellate brief renders those issues abandoned.\u201d). Instead, Nunez embeds this notice deficiency argument within his confrontation-clause argument, which we have already discussed.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
