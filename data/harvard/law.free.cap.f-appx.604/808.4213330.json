The dismissal was explained as tied to his disregard of the court\u2019s orders and federal rules. Ferentinos argues that the district court abused its discretion in finding that Ferentinos had \u201cignored\u201d the district court\u2019s orders that his wife\u2019s estate and class-action claims needed to be counseled and to be filed separately. In addition, he argues that the district court abused its discretion in finding that lesser sanctions would not suffice, given that he had a limited amount of time to amend his complaint.</p>\n<p id=\"b837-5\">We review for an abuse of discretion the district court\u2019s decision to dismiss a complaint for failure to comply with a court order or court rules. <em>Betty K Agencies, Ltd. v. M/V Monada, </em>432 F.3d 1333, 1337 (11th Cir.2005). Discretion means that the district court may act within a \u201crange of choice,\u201d and we will not disturb the decision \u201cas long as it stays within that range and is not influenced by any mistake of law.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Although the standard of review is abuse of discretion, dismissal of an action with prejudice is a sanction of last resort and proper only in extreme circumstances. <em>Jones v. Graham, </em>709 F.2d 1457, 1458 (11th Cir.1983).</p>\n<p id=\"b837-6\"><em>Pro se </em>pleadings are held to a less stringent standard than pleadings drafted by lawyers and will be liberally construed. <em>Alba v. Montford, </em>517 F.3d 1249, 1252 (11th Cir.2008). Nevertheless, \u201cprocedural rules in ordinary civil litigation\u201d should not be interpreted \u201cso as to excuse mistakes by those who proceed without counsel.\u201d <em>McNeil v. United States, </em>508 U.S. 106, 113, 113 S.Ct. 1980, 1984, 124 L.Ed.2d 21 (1993). Furthermore, a court must not act as de facto counsel for pro se parties or rewrite a deficient pleading. <em>GJR Invs., Inc. v. Cnty. of Escambia, </em>132 F.3d 1359, 1369 (11th Cir.1998), <em>overruled on other grounds as recognized in Randall v. Scott, </em>610 F.3d 701, 709 (11th Cir.2010).</p>\n<p id=\"b837-9\">While dismissal is an extraordinary remedy, dismissal upon disregard of an order (especially where the litigant has been forewarned) is generally not an abuse of discretion. <em>Moon v. Newsome, </em>863 F.2d 835, 837 (11th Cir.1989). In applying Fed. R.Civ.P. 41(b), we have written that dismissal with prejudice is an extreme sanction and should only be imposed when \u201c(1) a party engages in a clear pattern of delay or willful contempt (contumacious conduct); and (2) the district court specifically finds that lesser sanctions would not suffice.\u201d <em>Betty K Agencies, Ltd., </em>432 F.3d at 1337-38.</p>\n<p id=\"b837-10\">A complaint must contain \u201ca short and plain statement of the claim showing that the pleader is entitled to relief.\u201d Fed. R.Civ.P. 8(a)(2). In addition, every allegation \u201cmust be simple, concise, and direct,\u201d and the complaint must \u201cstate its claims ... in numbered paragraphs, each limited as far as practicable to a single set of circumstances.\u201d Fed.R.Civ.P. 8(d)(1), 10(b). Although the complaint does not need detailed factual allegations, it must provide the grounds for relief, and \u201crequires more than labels and. conclusions, [or] a formulaic recitation of the elements of a cause of action.\u201d <em>Bell Atl. Corp. v. Twombly, </em>550 U.S. 544, 555, 127 S.Ct. 1955, 1965, 167 L.Ed.2d 929 (2007). To state a claim, the plaintiff needs to allege enough facts to make the claim \u201cplausible on its face.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 570, 127 S.Ct. at 1974. A \u201cshotgun pleading\u201d is one where it is \u201cvirtually impossible to know which allegations of fact are intended to support which claim(s) for relief.\u201d <em>Anderson v. Dist. Bd. </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"810\">*810</page-number><em>of Trs. of Cent. Fla. Cmty. Coll., </em>77 F.3d 364, 366 (11th Cir.1996).</p>\n<p id=\"b838-4\">The district court did not abuse its discretion in dismissing with prejudice Feren-tinos\u2019s 295-page amended complaint: a dismissal based on the judge\u2019s finding that Ferentinos \u201crepeatedly ignored\u201d orders that his wife\u2019s estate and class-action claims needed to be counseled and filed separately. Moreover, the district court did not abuse its discretion in finding that lesser sanctions would not suffice: Feren-tinos had been given more than sufficient opportunity to state a plausible cause of action in federal and state court and to cure the complaint\u2019s deficiencies. The district court also did not abuse its discretion in dismissing the amended complaint, based on the judge\u2019s determination that the amended complaint was a \u201cshotgun pleading\u201d \u2014 similar to the other pleadings Ferentinos earlier filed in federal and state court \u2014 and obviously did not comply with Fed.R.Civ.P. 8 and 10.</p>\n<p id=\"b838-5\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b837-7\"> Counsel for the Estate of Sandra Ferentinos did not file an appeal.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
