(Remy). Levy filed suit in district court, seeking unpaid overtime pay under the Fair Labor Standards Act (FLSA). His complaint alleged that he worked in excess of 40 hours per week without receiving the premium under the Act. In the proceedings below, both parties moved for summary judgment, and the district court granted Remy\u2019s motion, dismissing Levy\u2019s claim in its entirety.</p>\n<p id=\"b947-9\">After consideration of the parties\u2019 briefs and upon thorough review of the record, we find that the district court properly entered summary judgment. As the district court correctly found, \u201cbecause there is no genuine issue that Levy was a highly compensated employee within the meaning of the regulations, his past employment is exempt from the overtime provision of the FLSA under the administrative employee exemption.\u201d This exemption applies \u201cregardless of whether [Levy\u2019s] primary duty involved the exercise of discretion and independent judgment with respect to matters of significance.\u201d Accordingly, the judgment of the district court is</p>\n<p id=\"b947-10\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
