Pertinent to this appeal, Collins'raised termination claims under the Age Discrimination in Employment Act, 29 U.S.C \u00a7 623, and the Americans With Disabilities Act, '42 U.S.C. \u00a7 12112(a). On appeal, Collins argues the merits of the disposition of the underlying summary judgment claim, as well as the timeliness of his motion for reconsideration.</p>\n<p id=\"b937-14\">As we previously ordered, prior to the parties\u2019 filing of briefs in this ease, we limited Collins\u2019s appeal to his motion for reconsideration because he failed to file a timely appeal as to the district court\u2019s denial of his underlying motion for summary judgment. However, Collins does not argue in his brief that the district court abused its discretion<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> in denying the motion for reconsideration, so Collins has abandoned the only outstanding issue on appeal. <em>See Timson v. Sampson, </em>518 F.3d 870, 874 (11th Cir.2008) (\u201cWhile we read briefs filed by <em>pro se </em>litigants liberally, ... issues not briefed on appeal by a <em>pro se </em>litigant are deemed abandoned....\u201d). Moreover, even if we addressed the limited issue on appeal \u2014 whether the district court abused its discretion in denying Collins\u2019 motion for reconsideration \u2014 we would not conclude that there was an abuse of discretion.</p>\n<p id=\"b937-18\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b937-15\">. We review a district court\u2019s ruling on a motion for reconsideration for an abuse of discretion. <em>Richardson v.
