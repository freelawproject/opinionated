He appeals his sentence, arguing that the District Court committed procedural error: in determining the Guidelines sentence range, the court erred in increasing the sentence range on the ground that he used force against another person. He further ai\u2019gues that the altercation upon which the court relied was unrelated to the charged escape and therefore did not consist of relevant conduct.</p>\n<p id=\"b946-21\">We need not reach the merits of Nance\u2019s appeal. The District Court stated at sentencing that it would have imposed the same sentence based on the 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a) sentencing factors, regardless of the Guidelines sentence range. In light of this statement, any procedural error the court may have committed in calculating the sentence range was harmless. <em>United States v. Kapordelis, </em>569 F.3d 1291, 1315 (11th Cir.2009).</p>\n<p id=\"b946-22\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
