We have reviewed counsel\u2019s brief and the relevant portions of the record reflected therein, as well as Flores-Rodriguez\u2019s response. We concur with counsel\u2019s assessment that the appeal presents no nonfrivolous issue for appellate review. Accordingly, counsel\u2019s motion for leave to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"384\">*384</page-number>withdraw is GRANTED, counsel is excused from further responsibilities herein, and the APPEAL IS DISMISSED. <em>See </em>5th Cir.
