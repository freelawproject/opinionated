Anderson had been placed in administrative segregation due to the serious nature of these charges. Because the charges involved children, those operating the Jail were concerned for Anderson\u2019s safety; inmates charged with crimes against children are frequent targets of assault at the hands of other inmates.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b840-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"812\">*812</page-number>In the complaint he filed in the District Court, Anderson claimed that he had been placed in administrative segregation without a hearing, as required by the procedural component of the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> He also claimed that once placed in administrative segregation, he was \u201cpunished\u201d in violation of his rights under the substantive component of the Due Process Clause.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> That punishment allegedly included derogatory comments, cold stares, threats of violence, loss of food and recreation time, and being forced to wear shackles and leg irons, unlike other pretrial detainees.</p>\n<p id=\"b840-4\">The defendants moved the District Court for summary judgment. The court referred the motion to a Magistrate Judge, who recommended that the District Court grant the motion. The Magistrate Judge, in his Report &amp; Recommendation (\u201cR &amp; R\u201d), found that the evidence in the record failed to demonstrate (1) that Anderson\u2019s confinement in administrative segregation was so atypical of ordinary jail life as to create a liberty interest that entitled him to a due process hearing before being confined there, and (2) that the confinement constituted punishment. Anderson objected to Magistrate Judge\u2019s R &amp; R. \u201cIn his Objection, [he] contended] that the circumstances, surrounding his confinement\u201d, <em>i.e., </em>the pending criminal charges, were \u201cirrelevant[,] as the only pertinent issue [was] whether his \u2018punitive confinement\u2019 violated due process.\u201d Doc. 31 at 2. The District Court' overruled Anderson\u2019s objection, resolving the issue it presented in these words:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b840-8\">[A]s discussed in the Recommendation, there is no evidence that the named Defendants placed Plaintiff in administrative segregation <em>for the purpose of punishment, </em>as is required for Plaintiffs due process claim to succeed on the merits.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> The Court further agrees with the Magistrate Judge that Plaintiffs <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"813\">*813</page-number>placement in administrative segregation was based on several legitimate considerations. Consequently, because the Court finds that the evidence supports only that Plaintiffs confinement was based on several legitimate considerations, there is no evidence that Plaintiffs confinement was punitive and thus that it violated due process.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b841-5\"><em>Id. </em>(emphasis in original). The District Court therefore granted the defendants summary judgment. Anderson now appeals. We affirm.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b841-6\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b841-7\">Anderson challenges the District' Court\u2019s rejection of his procedural due process claim. In his Objection to the Magistrate Judge\u2019s R &amp; R, Anderson did not challenge the Magistrate Judge\u2019s findings and conclusions regarding that claim; thus, the District Court did not address it. Under the circumstances, Anderson may not challenge here the factual findings underpinning the District Court\u2019s rejection of his procedural due process claim. <em>Dupree v. Warden, </em>715 F.3d 1295, 1300 (11th Cir.2013).<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> We do consider, though, the court\u2019s <em>sub silentio </em>legal conclusion that the claim is insufficient, reviewing <em>it'de novo. Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b841-8\">To make out a denial-of-procedural-due-process claim under 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983, a plaintiff must establish three elements: (1) a deprivation of a constitutionally protected liberty or property interest; (2) state action; and (3) constitutionally inadequate process. <em>Grayden v. Rhodes, </em>345 F.3d 1225, 1232 (11th Cir.2003). A convicted inmate\u2019s confinement to administrative segregation for non-punitive reasons does not violate due process because such segregation is \u201cordinarily contemplated by a prison sentence.\u201d <em>Sandin v. Conner, </em>515 U.S. 472, 480, 115 S.Ct. 2293, 2298, 132 L.Ed.2d 418 (1995). We find no controlling precedent holding that the same is not true with respect to pretrial detainees as well. In short, confinement in administrative segregation under conditions substantially similar to those experienced by the general jail population does not implicate a liberty interest. <em>Id. </em>at 485-86, 115 S.Ct. at 2301. The evidence in this case is 'that Anderson\u2019s placement was similar to the placement of anyone facing charges such as Anderson\u2019s. The placement was not for punishment; rather, it was done to ensure Anderson\u2019s safety and to minimize the risk of violence between .inmates.</p>\n<p id=\"b841-12\">Even if we were to assume that Anderson was improperly denied a due process hearing antecedent to his placement, we must bear in mind that for any of the defendants to be held liable in damages, Anderson would have to prove that the defendant personally participated in the denial. That is, individual liability under \u00a7 1983 cannot arise vicariously through a theory of respondeat superior. <em>Monell v. Dep\u2019t. of Soc. Servs. of New York, </em>436 U.S. 658, 690-95, 98 S.Ct. 2018, 2035-38, 56 L.Ed.2d 611 (1978); <em>Holloman ex rel. Holloman v. Harland, </em>370 F.3d 1252, 1290 (11th Cir.2004). Without the liability-extending tool of respondeat superior, \u201c[sjupervisory officials cannot be held liable under \u00a7 1983 for the unconstitutional actions of their subordinates....\u201d <em>Gray v. Bostic, </em>458 F.3d 1295, 1308 (11th Cir. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"814\">*814</page-number>2006). The record contains no evidence indicating that either Sheriff Chapman or Commander Harris were personally involved in the placement at issue; in fact, there is no evidence that they even knew about it. As for Officer Atkinson, who classified Anderson for administrative segregation, there is no evidence that Anderson ever requested a hearing or, assuming he did, that Officer Atkinson denied it. Whatever requests he made were for new cell assignments, and, for the most part, they were granted.</p>\n<p id=\"b842-4\">Finally, as to all three defendants, Anderson cites no precedent, nor are we aware of any, that would have put them on notice that placing Anderson in administrative segregation without a hearing under the circumstances of this case would have denied him due process. Hence, they are entitled to qualified immunity.</p>\n<p id=\"b842-5\">We turn now to Anderson\u2019s substantive due process claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b842-6\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b842-7\">\u201cClaims involving the mistreatment of ... pretrial detainees in custody are governed by the Fourteenth Amendment\u2019s Due Process Clause instead of the Eighth Amendment\u2019s Cruel and Unusual Punishment Clause, which applies to such claims by convicted prisoners.\u201d <em>Cottrell v. Caldwell, </em>85 F.3d 1480, 1490 (11th Cir.1996). But the standards are the same, \u201cso deci-sional law involving prison inmates applies equally to cases involving ... pretrial detainees.\u201d <em>Id. </em>\u201c[T]he mistreatment standard is \u2018deliberate indifference\u2019 to a substantial risk of serious harm.\u201d <em>Farmer v. Brennan, </em>511 U.S. 825, 827, 114 S.Ct. 1970, 1974, 128 L.Ed.2d 811 (1994). The standard has both an objective and a subjective component. \u201cTo satisfy the objective component, the plaintiff must show a deprivation that is, \u2018objectively, sufficiently serious,\u2019 which means that the defendants\u2019 actions resulted \u2018in the denial of the minimal civilized measure of life\u2019s necessities.\u2019 \u201d <em>Cottrell, </em>85 F.3d at 1491 (quoting <em>Farmer). </em>\u201cEven when that objective component is established, an in-custody mistreatment claim fails unless the plaintiff establishes that the defendant had a \u2018sufficiently culpable state of mind.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>(quoting Farmer).</p>\n<p id=\"b842-9\">As is the case with his .procedural due process claim, Anderson had to establish that the defendant personally participated in the constitutional deprivation; Nothing in the record establishes, for summary judgment purposes, the objective and subjective elements of the claim against any of the three defendants. None were shown to be aware of, much less deliberately indifferent to, the conditions of confinement of which Anderson complains. Nor is there any evidence that he was placed in administrative segregation for punishment as opposed to a legitimate governmental interest. In short, the District Court properly granted summary judgment on this claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b842-10\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b839-11\">. Anderson\u2019s complaint in this case also sought injunctive relief. Since he was no longer incarcerated in the Walton County Jail and injunctive relief could not be granted, the court treated his complaint as seeking damages against the defendants in their individual capacities.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b839-21\">. Anderson entered the Jail on July 9, 2010. On July 14, 2010, he was placed in Cellblock <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"812\">*812</page-number>12, Room 24, in administrative segregation, for his safety and the safety and security of others. Inmates in Cellblock 12 received one hour per day recreation outside their cell and were free to move about the dayroom area. On April 27, 2011, Anderson was moved in Cellblock 12 from Room 24 to Room 27, and shared that cell with another inmate. On June 21, 2011, to accommodate a new recreation schedule in Cellblock 12, Anderson was moved to Room 25, sharing the cell with still another inmate. The new recreation schedule provided Anderson with four hours of recreation per day. On June 22, 2011, at his request, Anderson was reassigned and placed in Room 27 in Cellblock 12. Another reassignment occurred at Anderson\u2019s request on June 4, 2012; he was moved to Room 38 in Cellblock 3. He said that if he continued to have recreation time with the group he was assigned to in Cellblock 12, he would be \u201cjumped.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b840-6\">.On his confinement in the Jail, Anderson was initially placed on suicide watch in a padded cell. His complaint seeks relief for the five days he was confined there. On appeal, though, his brief does not take issue with the District Court's rejection of that part of his due process claim; hence, we do not address it.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b840-10\">. As a pretrial detainee, Anderson was not subject to punishment as if he were an inmate serving a sentence for a crime he had committed. His complaint alleged that the treatment he received constituted cruel and unusual punishment in violation of the Eighth Amendment. The Eighth Amendment (which is applicable to the States under the Fourteenth Amendment's Due Process Clause) is inapplicable to pretrial detainees. A pretrial detainee\u2019s remedy for treatment that constitutes cruel and unusual punishment is under the substantive component of the Due Process Clause. <em>Cottrell v. Caldwell, </em>85 F.3d 1480, <em>1490 </em>(11th Cir.1996). We therefore assume that Anderson brought his \u201cEighth Amendment claim\u201d under that component.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b840-11\">. <em>See Kibwika v. Broward Cnty. Sheriff\u2019s Office, </em>453 Fed.Appx. 915, 919 (11th Cir.2012) (per curiam) (holding that pretrial detainee cannot be punished, and \"[t]o determine <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"813\">*813</page-number>whether a restriction constitutes punishment, [the court] must decide whether the disability is imposed for the purpose of punishment or whether it is but an incident of some other legitimate governmental purpose\u201d).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b841-10\">.
