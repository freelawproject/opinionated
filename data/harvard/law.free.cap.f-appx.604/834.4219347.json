Initially, Copeland was sentenced to a total term of 264 months of imprisonment. On appeal from that sentence, we determined that the government had breached Copeland\u2019s plea agreement by not recommending a two-level reduction for acceptance of responsibility. <em>See United States v. Copeland, </em>520 Fed.Appx. 822, 826-28 (11th Cir.2013). Concluding that Copeland was entitled to specific performance of the plea agreement, we vacated the sentence and remanded to the district court for resen-tencing before a different judge. <em>Id. </em>at 828. On remand, the district court applied the reduction for acceptance of responsibility and imposed a total sentence of 204 months of imprisonment, below Copeland\u2019s advisory guideline range.</p>\n<p id=\"b863-12\">At his resentencing, Copeland objected to the district court\u2019s application of an enhancement for obstruction of justice under United States Sentencing Guidelines Manual (\u201cU.S.S.G.\u201d) \u00a7 3C1.1. In addressing the objection, the court concluded that the law-of-the-case doctrine barred Copeland\u2019s challenge to the application of the enhancement because Copeland had failed to raise this issue in his first appeal. In the alternative, the court found that the enhancement was appropriate because the facts showed that Copeland had attempted to intimidate a codefendant who was cooperating in the investigation of the fraudulent tax-refund scheme in which Copeland was involved. In this 'appeal, Copeland argues that the district court erred in both respects. After careful review, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b863-13\">We review the district court\u2019s application of the law-of-the-case doctrine <em>de novo. Alphamed, Inc. v. B. Braun Med., Inc., </em>367 F.3d 1280, 1285 (11th Cir.2004). We likewise review <em>de novo </em>the district court\u2019s compliance with our mandate from a previous appeal. <em>United States v. Amedeo, </em>487 F.3d 823, 829 (11th Cir.2007). When a district court imposes an enhancement for obstruction of justice under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3C1.1, we review the court\u2019s factual findings for clear error and its application of the Sentencing Guidelines to those facts <em>de novo. United States v. Massey, </em>443 F.3d 814, 818 (11th Cir.2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b863-14\">The law-of-the-case doctrine \u201cpreclude[s] courts from revisiting issues that were decided explicitly or by necessary implication in a prior appeal.\u201d <em>Schiavo ex rel. Schindler v. Schiavo, </em>403 F.3d 1289, 1291 (11th Cir.2005). Self-imposed by the courts, law of the case creates efficiency, finality, and obedience within the judicial system. <em>Amedeo, </em>487 F.3d at 829. The law-of-the-case doctrine applies to findings <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"836\">*836</page-number>made under the Sentencing Guidelines. <em>Id. </em>at 830.</p>\n<p id=\"Ar8d\">Notably, \u201c[u]nder the law of the case doctrine, a legal decision made at one stage of the litigation, unchallenged in a subsequent appeal when the opportunity existed, becomes the law of the case for future stages of the same litigation, and the parties are deemed to have waived the right to challenge that decision at a later time.\u201d <em>United States v. Escobar-Urrego, </em>110 F.3d 1556, 1560 (11th Cir.1997) (quoting <em>Williamsburg Wax Museum v. Historic Figures, </em>810 F.2d 243, 250 (D.C.Cir.1987)); <em>see also United States v. Fiallo-Jacome, </em>874 F.2d 1479, 1481-83 (11th Cir.1989) (concluding that a defendant had waived his right to raise an argument in a second appeal after resentencing that was not raised in the first appeal). Therefore, in <em>Escobar-Urrego, </em>this Court held that because the defendant \u201chad the opportunity to appeal the district court\u2019s decision that he imported 2,036 grams of usable cocaine but did not, that decision is the law of the case,\u201d precluding the defendant from \u201crelitigating the question of how much usable cocaine he imported\u201d unless an exception to law of the case applied. 110 F.3d at 1560-61.</p>\n<p id=\"b864-5\">In his first appeal, Copeland did not argue that the evidence failed to support the district court\u2019s application of the obstruction-of-justice enhancement under \u00a7 3C1.1.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> <em>See Copeland, </em>520 Fed.Appx. at 827-28. This issue could have been raised in the first appeal. The first district-court judge applied the enhancement during Copeland\u2019s initial sentencing, and, on re-sentencing, the new judge applied the enhancement primarily based on testimony from a cooperating codefendant presented at Copeland\u2019s detention hearing early in the case.</p>\n<p id=\"b864-7\">Because Copeland did not challenge the district court\u2019s initial decision to apply the enhancement when the opportunity existed in his first appeal, that decision is law of the case, and Copeland is deemed to have waived his. right to challenge the enhancement on resentencing and in this appeal. <em>See Escobar-Urrego, </em>110 F.3d at 1560; <em>Fiallo-Jacome, </em>874 F.2d at 1481-83. Nor does Copeland\u2019s current appeal satisfy any of the exceptions to the law-of-the-case doctrine, because it does not address new evidence or an intervening change in the law, nor does it raise the issue of manifest injustice resulting from our prior decision. <em>See Amedeo, </em>487 F.3d at 830.</p>\n<p id=\"b864-8\">Copeland contends that this Court\u2019s remand for resentencing before a different district-court judge wiped the slate clean and entitled the new judge \u201cto rule upon guideline objections anew.\u201d He cites to our opinion in <em>United States v. Martinez, </em>606 F.3d 1303 (11th Cir.2010), where we explained that \u201cwe have often held that a general vacatur of a sentence by default allows for resentencing <em>de novo.\u201d Id. </em>at 1304. In such a case of general vacatur, \u201cthe sentence \u2014 including any enhancements \u2014 has been wholly nullified and the slate wiped clean,\u201d permitting the district court to fully revisit the sentence upon resentencing. <em>Id. </em>(quotation marks omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b864-9\">But the circuit courts have \u201cbroad discretion to fashion an appropriate mandate on remand after the vacatur of a sentence,\u201d pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2106, so \u201cthe reviewing court remains free to modify or limit the issues for review on remand as it may deem appropriate.\u201d <em>Id. </em>And a district court abuses its discretion if it exceeds the scope of this Court\u2019s mandate. <em>United States v. Tamayo, </em>80 F.3d 1514, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"837\">*837</page-number>1520 (11th Cir.1996). We have explained that \u201c[t]he mandate rule is simply an application of the law of the case doctrine to a specific set of facts.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(quotation marks omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b865-5\">Whether the district court was permitted to consider Copeland\u2019s guideline objection anew on resentencing therefore depends on whether this Court\u2019s vacatur of his sentence was general or more limited. In resolving Copeland\u2019s first appeal, we held that the government breached the plea agreement, concluded that Copeland was entitled to specific performance of that agreement, and \u201cvacate[d] Copeland\u2019s sentence and remandfed] for resentencing before a different judge, consistent with this opinion.\u201d <em>See Copeland, </em>520 Fed.Appx. at 826-28. Thus, it appears as if this Court\u2019s mandate was limited to consideration of. Copeland\u2019s acceptance of responsibility, and did not constitute a general vacatur of his sentence permitting resentencing <em>de novo. See Martinez, </em>606 F.3d at 1304-05. Nothing so explicit was stated in the opinion,-however, leading the district court to helpfully make alternative determinations.</p>\n<p id=\"b865-6\">Nevertheless, we do not need to resolve whether the remand was general or limited, because even assuming that the district court was permitted to resentence Copeland <em>de novo, </em>Copeland has not shown that the district court erred in applying the obstruction-of-justice enhancement under \u00a7 3C1.1.</p>\n<p id=\"b865-7\">Section 3C1.1 of the Guidelines provides, in relevant part', that an upward adjustment of two levels is appropriate if \u201cthe defendant willfully obstructed or impeded, or attempted to obstruct or impede, the administration of justice with respect to the investigation, prosecution, or sentencing of the instant offense of conviction,\u201d and such conduct related to \u201cthe defendant\u2019s offense of conviction and any relevant conduct.\u201d U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3C1.1. Among the examples of covered conduct described in the commentary to \u00a7 3C1.1, the obstruction-of-justice enhancement applies to \u201cthreatening, intimidating, or otherwise unlawfully influencing a co-defendant, witness, or juror, directly or indirectly, or attempting to do so.\u201d <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 3C1.1 cmt. n. 4(A).</p>\n<p id=\"b865-9\">Here, one of Copeland\u2019s codefendants, Prientice Hooks, testified under oath at Copeland\u2019s detention hearing that he had been cooperating with the IRS and the Secret Service in their investigation of Copeland\u2019s tax-fraud scheme. Hooks testified that he had received prior threats from Copeland\u2019s associates, warning him that they would come after him if he divulged anything about Copeland to the authorities. Then, in September 2011, Hooks was walking alongside a road when Copeland hit Hooks with his vehicle and then drove off. The district court concluded that, based on Hooks\u2019s testimony, the government had shown by \u201ca preponderance of the evidence that the incident occurred largely as Mr. Hooks described it ..., specifically, that Mr. Copeland assaulted his former coconspirator, whom he knew or believed was cooperating against him.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b865-10\">Copeland contends that Hooks\u2019s testimony was undermined by other evidence in the record and was inconsistent with the police incident report prepared immediately after the incident. But because we review the district court\u2019s factual findings only for clear error, we must defer to the court\u2019s findings so long as they are \u201cplausible.\u201d <em>United States v. McPhee, </em>336 F.3d 1269, 1275 (11th Cir.2003). And \u201c[wjhere there are two permissible views of the evidence, the factfinder\u2019s choice between them cannot be clearly erroneous.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(quotation marks omitted). The district court\u2019s resolution of the factual inconsistencies identified by Copeland was plausible and, therefore, not clearly erroneous. <em>See id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b866-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"838\">*838</page-number>Based on the court\u2019s plausible factual findings, it was not erroneous to apply the obstruction-of-justice enhancement because the facts demonstrate that Copeland threatened or intimidated Hooks, or attempted to do so, because Copeland knew or believed that Hooks, a codefendant and potential witness, was assisting with the investigation of Copeland\u2019s tax fraud. <em>See </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3C1.1, cmt. n. 4(A). Accordingly, the district court did not err in applying the two-level increase for obstruction of justice. <em>See Massey, </em>443 F.3d at 818.</p>\n<p id=\"b866-4\">In short, by failing to challenge the obstruction-of-justice enhancement in his first appeal, Copeland is barred by law of the case from challenging the enhancement on appeal after resentencing. Alternatively, even if the district court was permitted to address Copeland\u2019s objection <em>de novo, </em>the court did not err in applying the \u00a7 3C1.1 enhancement.</p>\n<p id=\"b866-5\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b864-6\">. Although Copeland argued that the government breached the plea agreement by advocating for the obstruction-of-justice enhancement, he did not directly challenge the application of that enhancement, as he does in this appeal.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
