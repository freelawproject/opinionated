Trotter contends that the district court erred when it found that it did not have subject matter jurisdiction to review the state court\u2019s resolution of her domestic dispute.</p>\n<p id=\"b934-21\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b934-22\">Trotter endured a lengthy custody battle against the paternal grandparents of her daughter Kiara. After the Superior Court of Cobb County, Georgia entered an order granting Michael Ayres, Sr. and Teresa Covington-Ayres sole legal and physical custody of Kiara, Trotter appealed all the way to the United States -Supreme Court, where her petition for a writ of certiorari was denied.</p>\n<p id=\"b934-23\">Having exhausted direct appeals, Trotter sought a fresh start in the federal district court. But instead of a complaint, she filed a motion under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 60(b), naming the Ayreses as defendants and asking the court to declare that the custody order was \u201cvoid <em>ab initio </em>\u201d on the basis that it was procured through the fraudulent actions of Trotter\u2019s attorneys, Kiara\u2019s guardian ad litem, and the state court trial judge who entered the order, among others. She argued that the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"907\">*907</page-number><em>Rooker-Feldman</em><footnotemark><em>1</em></footnotemark><em> </em>doctrine did not bar the court from reviewing the state court\u2019s judgment because she sought relief not from legal error but from extrinsic fraud. The district court rejected that argument and dismissed the motion for lack of jurisdiction. This is Trotter\u2019s appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b935-5\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b935-6\">We review <em>de novo </em>a district court\u2019s determination of whether it has subject matter jurisdiction. <em>Sweet Pea Marine, Ltd. v. APJ Marine, Inc., </em>411 F.3d 1242, 1247 (11th Cir.2005). We may affirm a district court\u2019s decision for any reason supported by the record. <em>Cochran v. U.S. Health Care Fin. Admin., </em>291 F.3d 775, 778 n. 3 (11th Cir.2002).</p>\n<p id=\"b935-7\">The district court properly dismissed Trotter\u2019s action. To begin, Rule 60(b) is not the appropriate vehicle to initiate an action in federal court. <em>See Albra v. Advan, </em>490 F.3d 826, 829 (11th Cir.2007) (\u201c[Although we are to give liberal construction to the pleadings of <em>pro se </em>litigants, we nevertheless have required them to conform to procedural rules.\u201d) (quotation marks omitted). But even construing Trotter\u2019s Rule 60(b) motion liberally as a complaint, we cannot discern a basis for the court\u2019s subject matter jurisdiction. Trotter asserted that various individuals violated her due process rights, but the motion did not name those individuals as defendants. She did not assert any federal claims against the Ayreses. <em>See </em>28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1331. To the extent she asserted state law claims against them, she failed to allege diversity of citizenship or an amount in controversy exceeding $75,000. <em>See id. </em>\u00a7 1332.</p>\n<p id=\"b935-8\">And even if Trotter\u2019s allegations had presented a federal question or established diversity of citizenship, the district court would have lacked subject matter jurisdiction because of the <em>Rooker-Feldman </em>doctrine. That doctrine bars a state-court loser from later enlisting a federal district court to reverse her state-court loss. <em>See Exxon Mobil Corp. v. Saudi Basic Indus. Corp., </em>544 U.S. 280, 284, 125 S.Ct. 1517, 1521-22, 161 L.Ed.2d 454 (2005). It applies when: (1) the plaintiff was the loser in state court, (2) the plaintiff is complaining of an injury caused by the state court\u2019s judgment, (3) the state court\u2019s judgment was \u201crendered before the district court proceedings commenced,\u201d and (4) the plaintiff is \u201cinviting district court review and rejection\u201d of the state court\u2019s judgment. <em>Id. </em>We must also find that the claims barred by the doctrine were actually brought in state court or are \u201cinextricably intertwined\u201d with the state court\u2019s judgment. <em>Casale v. Tillman, </em>558 F.3d 1258, 1260 (11th Cir.2009) (quotation marks omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b935-12\">All of those conditions were met here. Trotter lost in state court and complained of an injury \u2014 the loss of custody \u2014 caused by the state court\u2019s judgment. The judgment was rendered well before she commenced proceedings in the district court, and she asked the court to review and reject it. Finally, to the extent we can discern Trotter\u2019s claims, it is clear that they were \u201cinextricably intertwined\u201d with the state court judgment because a ruling in her favor would have effectively nullified it.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> <em>See id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b935-13\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b935-9\">. <em>See D.C. Court of Appeals v. Feldman, </em>460 U.S. 462, 103 S.Ct. 1303, 75 L.Ed.2d 206 (1983); <em>Rooker v. Fidelity Trust Co., </em>263 U.S. 413, 44 S.Ct. 149, 68 L.Ed. 362 (1923).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b935-16\">. Trotter contends that the custody order is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"908\">*908</page-number>exempt from <em>Rooker-Feldman </em>because it was procured through fraud on the court. Even if this Court had recognized a fraud exception, to that doctrine, which it has not, Trotter\u2019s argument is little more than a claim that the state court result was wrong and the only possible reason for it was fraud. That argument is without merit.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
