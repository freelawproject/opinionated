On appeal, Jackson argues that, despite this Court\u2019s recent decision in <em>United States v. Smith, </em>775 F.3d 1262 (11th Cir.2014), <em>reh\u2019g denied, </em>(Feb. 18, 2015), the district court erred in finding that his prior convictions under Fla. Sta. \u00a7 893.13(l)(a) constituted controlled substance offenses for purposes of determining his base offense level in U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2K2.1(a)(4)(A). After careful review, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b942-8\">We review a district court\u2019s interpretation of the Guidelines and application of the Guidelines to the facts <em>de novo, </em>and review its findings of fact for clear error. <em>United States v. Barrington, </em>648 F.3d 1178, 1194-95 (11th Cir.2011). A factual finding is clearly erroneous when, upon review of the evidence, we are left with a definite and' firm conviction that a mistake has been made. <em>Id. </em>at 1195.</p>\n<p id=\"b942-9\">The Sentencing Guidelines provide for a base offense level of 20 if the defendant committed the offense currently before the sentencing court after having previously been convicted of a controlled substance offense. U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2K2.1(a)(4)(A). The term \u201ccontrolled substance offense\u201d carries the same meaning for purposes of \u00a7 2K2.1 as it does under the career offender guidelines in \u00a7 4B1.2. <em>See id. </em>\u00a7 2K2.1, comment. (n.l). Thus, a \u201ccontrolled substance offense\u201d is \u201can offense under federal or state law, punishable by imprisonment for a term exceeding one year, that prohibits the manufacture, import, export, distribution, or dispensing of a controlled substance ... or the possession of a controlled substance ... with intent to manufacture, import, export, distribute, or dispense. <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 2K2.1, comment. (n.l); <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 4B1.2(b).</p>\n<p id=\"b942-11\">Under Florida law, it is unlawful to \u201csell, manufacture, or deliver, or possess with intent to sell, manufacture, or deliver, a controlled substance.\u201d Fla. Stat. \u00a7 893.13(l)(a). For offenses under Fla. Stat. \u00a7 893.13 committed after, 2002, \u201cknowledge of the illicit nature of a controlled substance is not an element of [the] offense.\u201d Fla. Stat. \u00a7 893.101(2). In other words, a defendant may- be convicted under \u00a7 893.13(l)(a) even if he was unaware that the substance he possessed was a controlled substance. In <em>Smith, </em>we held that convictions under Fla. Stat. \u00a7 893.13(1) qualify as controlled substance offenses under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4B1.2(b) despite the Florida, statute\u2019s lack of a mens rea element. <em>Smith, </em>775 F.3d at 1266-68. Under the prior panel precedent rule, subsequent panels are bound by the holding of a prior panel unless and until it is overruled or undermined to the point of abrogation by a decision of the Supreme Court or of this Court sitting en banc. <em>United States v. Archer, </em>531 F.3d 1347, 1352 (11th Cir.2008).</p>\n<p id=\"b942-12\">Jackson\u2019s argument in this case is foreclosed by our holding in <em>Smith. </em>As for his claim that <em>Smith </em>was wrongly decided and should not be followed, we are unpersuaded. <em>Smith </em>is binding precedent and must be followed unless it is overruled or undermined to the point of abrogation by a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"915\">*915</page-number>decision of the Supreme Court or of this Court sitting en banc.</p>\n<p id=\"b943-5\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
