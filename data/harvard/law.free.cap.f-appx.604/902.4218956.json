Marmol challenges the denial of his motion for appointed counsel and the refusal to reduce his sentence of 293 months of imprisonment. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b930-21\">The district court did not abuse its discretion when it denied Marmol\u2019s motion for appointed counsel. Marmol was not entitled to have counsel assist him in seeking a reduction of his sentence, <em>see United States v. Webb, </em>565 F.3d 789, 794-95 (11th Cir.2009), and the district court reasonably denied his request as premature when he filed it two months before the effective date of Amendment 782. Marmol later failed to renew his request for appointed counsel when he filed his motion to reduce his sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b930-22\">The district court also did not abuse its discretion when it denied Marmol\u2019s motion to reduce his sentence. The district court left undisturbed its original determination that Marmol\u2019s offense involved 28.2 kilograms of cocaine. <em>See United States v. Bravo, </em>203 F.3d 778, 780 (11th Cir.2000). Based on the amended drug table, the district court correctly assigned Marmol an offense level of 36, U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2Dl.l(e)(2), which resulted in a revised sentencing range between 188 and 235 months of imprisonment, <em>id. </em>Ch. 5, Pt. A. The district court next considered the statutory sentencing factors and reasonably refused to reduce Marmol\u2019s sentence. <em>See </em>18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a); <em>Bravo, </em>203 F.3d at 781. Marmol possessed and conspired to import and to distribute a significant amount of cocaine, 21 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 963, 846, 841(a), and before being captured, he drove a vehicle on Biscayne Boulevard in Miami, Florida, against the flow of traffic at a high rate of speed. Based on this record, the district court was entitled to find that Marmol\u2019s term of imprisonment remained necessary to serve the purposes of sentencing.</p>\n<p id=\"b930-23\">Marmol challenges his sentence on three grounds, all of which are meritless. First, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"903\">*903</page-number>Marmol argues that the district court sentenced him above the \u201cstatutory limit,\u201d but Marmol faced a maximum statutory sentence of imprisonment for life. <em>See id. </em>\u00a7\u00a7 841(b)(1)(A), 960(b)(1)(B). Second, Marmol challenges the two-level increase of his base offense level for recklessly endangering the public in the course of fleeing from a law enforcement officer, <em>see </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3C1.2, but in determining eligibility for a reduction of sentence \u201call original sentencing determinations remain unchanged,\u201d <em>see Bravo, </em>203 F.3d at 781. Third, Marmol argues that the district court failed to consider his post-sentencing conduct, but the district court was not obligated to do so. <em>See </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7 1B1.10 cmt. n. l(B)(iii); <em>United States v. Smith, </em>568 F.3d 923, 927 (11th Cir.2009).</p>\n<p id=\"b931-6\">We AFFIRM the denial of Marmol\u2019s motion to reduce.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
