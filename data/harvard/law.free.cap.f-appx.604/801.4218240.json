In his 911 call, Patrick said that he and his friend Antonio Jones had barricaded themselves in a bedroom because several armed men had broken into the house. When the first officer arrived on the scene, he noticed a tall man leaving the residence with several items in his hands. The officer attempted to arrest the suspect, but he fled and outran the officer. The suspect did, however, drop the items he had been holding- \u2014 a car stereo and two handguns. In the meantime, more officers arrived and moved to secure the inside of the home. One of the front door\u2019s panels was kicked in, so when the officers approached the house they could see a man standing inside. That man was Cedrick Barriner. They instructed Barriner to exit the house with his hands in the air, and he did. They arrested him, patted him down, and found a bullet in one of his pockets. When they searched the home, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"803\">*803</page-number>they found, among other things, mail packaging with marijuana residue on it, a black handgun in a closet, and a bullet next to the handgun.</p>\n<p id=\"b831-5\">The State brought two criminal charges against Barriner. The first was for armed burglary of an occupied dwelling with an assault. <em>See </em>Fla. Stat. Ann. \u00a7 810.02(2)(a), (b) (West 2009). The second was for being a convicted felon in possession of ammunition. <em>See id. </em>\u00a7 790.23(1). On the first day of trial, the court granted Barriner\u2019s motion to sever the counts, and the case proceeded to trial on the armed burglary charge alone. The State relied on testimony from Jones, Patrick, and the officers who responded to the 911 call. Those witnesses testified to the facts we have already recounted. Barriner\u2019s defense strategy was to argue that he was innocent of any crime, and he took the stand to give his account of that night\u2019s events. According to Barriner, Jones had invited him inside, and they had smoked marijuana. Barriner said he had given Jones $500 for a pound of marijuana earlier that day,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> and when he asked about it, Jones said that he could not get any. Barriner then stood up to fight him, and Jones ran back to the bedroom and locked himself inside. Barri-ner followed Jones, knocked on the door, started \u201ctalking trash,\u201d and demanded that Jones give him his marijuana. Just as he was starting to leave, the police arrived. When cross-examined by the prosecutor about the bullet in his pocket, Barriner explained that he had picked it up as he was leaving the house.</p>\n<p id=\"b831-6\">At the close of evidence, the trial court\u2019s instructions to the jury included an explanation of the charged offense, which was armed burglary of an occupied dwelling with an assault, as well as explanations of all the lesser included offenses whose elements were alleged in the information and supported by evidence at trial. <em>See State v. Weller, </em>590 So.2d 923, 926 (Fla.1991) (\u201c[Florida] law requires that an instruction be given for any lesser offense all the elements of which are alleged in the accusatory pleadings and supported by the evidence adduced at trial.\u201d). The court\u2019s instructions thus gave the jurors three general options.</p>\n<p id=\"b831-10\">The first option was to find Barriner guilty as charged in the information. The court told them that they must return that verdict if they found all of the elements for an armed burglary of an occupied dwelling with an assault.</p>\n<p id=\"b831-11\">If the jurors could not conclude that he was guilty as charged in the information, the second option was to find Barriner guilty of \u201cother acts that would constitute a lesser included offense.\u201d The lesser included offenses were: (1) armed burglary of a structure, (2) burglary of a structure with an assault, (3) burglary of an unoccupied dwelling, (4) burglary of an occupied structure, (5) burglary of an unoccupied structure, (6) trespass of a structure, and (7) assault. The court told the jurors that they had to pick the verdict that reflected the \u201chighest offense which has been proven beyond a reasonable doubt.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b831-12\">The third option was to find Barriner not guilty. The court further instructed the jurors that \u201c[o]nly one verdict may be returned as to the crime charged,\u201d and that when they marked the verdict forms, the jurors were \u201cto place an X on the one line that represents the jury\u2019s verdict.\u201d Neither side objected to those instructions.</p>\n<p id=\"b831-13\">During its deliberations, the jury sent the trial judge a note. It read: \u201cDear <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"804\">*804</page-number>Judge, is the[re] a Florida statute that encompasses both an Assault and Tre[s]pass?\u201d With the jury outside the courtroom, the trial judge read the note to the attorneys. The prosecutor replied, \u201cI think the answer is no.\u201d Defense' counsel did not dispute that answer, saying: \u201cThey have to agree, Your Honor.\u201d<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Defense' counsel did not ask for time to research the.issue before giving his answer. The court then called the jurors into the.courtroom and told them: \u201cThe answer to your question is no.\u201d After a short deliberation, the jury found Barriner guilty of the lesser included offense of burglary of an unoccupied dwelling, in violation of Florida Statute section 810.02(3)(b). The court then entered judgment on the verdict.</p>\n<p id=\"b832-4\">The next day, the trial judge received a letter from one of the jurors. The letter stated that the jurors had been deadlocked, with three jurors believing Barri-ner was guilty as charged and three jurors believing he was guilty of only assault. It went on to explain that the jurors had submitted the question to the judge in the hope that they could reach a compromise by finding Barriner guilty under a statute that criminalized assault and trespass. When the judge told them there was no such statute, the jurors struck a different compromise by finding Barriner guilty of burglary of an unoccupied dwelling. The letter asserted that \u201call of the Jurors present had agreed that the Defendant should not serve more than 2 to 5 years in prison,\u201d and that they had picked burglary of an unoccupied dwelling because they thought it would result in such a sentence. The letter then explained that its author (who happened to be a lawyer) was dismayed when he returned home, looked up Florida Statute section 810.02(3)(b), and realized that it authorized a sentence far higher than he and the other jurors had intended. Defense counsel filed a motion to interview the juror, but the trial court denied it.</p>\n<p id=\"b832-7\">Having been found guilty in his trial on Count One, Barriner chose to plead guilty to Count Two, which had been severed. The trial court determined that, with those two convictions, Barriner qualified as a habitual felony offender under Florida Statute section 775.084(l)(a). It then sentenced him to twenty years in prison, giving him concurrent sentences of twenty years for each count of conviction.</p>\n<p id=\"b832-8\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b832-9\">Barriner challenged his conviction on direct appeal and failed. He then filed a motion in state court for post-conviction relief. One of the challenges he raised was a Sixth Amendment claim based on his trial counsel\u2019s (1) failure to conduct legal research on the question that the jury raised during deliberations and (2) decision to answer \u201cno\u201d to the jury\u2019s question.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> He argued that counsel should have instead asked the judge to clarify that the jurors could convict him of multiple lesser included offenses, and that counsel\u2019s failure to do so \u201cdenied the jury their right to exercise [their] pardon power.\u201d To bolster his argument on the prejudice prong, Barriner attached the juror\u2019s letter to the trial judge. Barriner argued that the letter established that he was prejudiced because <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"805\">*805</page-number>it showed there was a reasonable probability that, if the jury had been instructed that it was possible to convict him of both assault and trespass, it would have convicted him of those two lesser included offenses and not the lesser included offense of burglary of an unoccupied dwelling.</p>\n<p id=\"b833-5\">The state trial court denied Barriner\u2019s motion for post-conviction relief. As for his Sixth Amendment challenge, the court concluded that Barriner\u2019s claim failed under the two-prong test established in <em>Strickland v. Washington, </em>466 U.S. 668, 687-88, 104 S.Ct. 2052, 2064, 80 L.Ed.2d 674 (1984) (requiring defendants to show that trial counsel\u2019s representation was objectively unreasonable under the circumstances and prejudicial to their defense). The court assumed that Barriner had met the first prong, acknowledging that he \u201cmay have made a preliminary showing\u201d of deficient performance. The court pointed out that, while counsel had been \u201caccurate\u201d in answering that \u201cthere was no statute that encompassed both trespass and assault,\u201d counsel nevertheless \u201ccould have referenced [Florida case law] and requested a jury instruction that the Defendant could instead be found guilty of both trespass and assault.\u201d <em>See Stuckey v. State, </em>972 So.2d 918, 921 (Fla. 5th DCA 2007) (\u201c[A] jury can convict a defendant of one <em>or more </em>of the lesser included offenses-\u201d). But when the state court turned to <em>Strickland\u2019s </em>second prong, it concluded that Barriner- had not established prejudice. The court reasoned that \u201cit would be mere speculation as to whether the inclusion of the lesser included offenses would have resulted in a different verdict\u201d and in any event <em>Strickland </em>forbids a finding of prejudice based on \u201cthe \u2018luck of a lawless decision maker.\u2019\u201d <em>See Strickland, </em>466 U.S. at 695, 104 S.Ct. at 2068. The Florida district court of appeals affirmed the circuit court\u2019s decision in a one-line per curiam decision, and Barriner did not petition for review by the Florida Supreme Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b833-8\">Barriner then filed a petition for a writ of federal habeas corpus under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254. The district court determined that the state court\u2019s denial of Barriner\u2019s ineffective assistance claim, though on the merits, was not entitled to the deference normally afforded to state court decisions under the Antiterrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act of 1996 (AEDPA). <em>See </em>28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254(d). The district court withheld AEDPA deference on two grounds. First, it asserted that the state court had unreasonably applied clearly established federal law by using a prejudice standard that was more demanding than <em>Strickland\u2019s. See id. </em>\u00a7 2254(d)(1). Second, it determined that the state court had made an unreasonable determination of the facts by mischaracterizing Barriner\u2019s claim as \u201cpredicated upon the contention that the jury was not instructed [at all] on the lesser included offenses of assault and trespass.\u201d <em>See id. </em>\u00a7 2254(d)(2). The district court' pointed out that the record showed that the jury had been instructed on those two lesser included offenses, and that Barriner\u2019s claim was based on the argument that the jurors should have been instructed that they had the option to find him guilty of both of those offenses. The district court then reviewed Barriner\u2019s claim <em>de novo </em>and concluded that his right to effective assistance of counsel was violated. This is the State\u2019s appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b833-9\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b833-10\">To succeed on an ineffective assistance of counsel claim, a petitioner must establish both deficient performance and prejudice. <em>See Strickland, </em>466 U.S. at 687-88, 104 S.Ct. at 2064. We need not decide whether the district court was correct in its determination that AEDPA deference <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"806\">*806</page-number>does not apply to Barriner\u2019s ineffectiveness claim. <em>See </em>28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254(d). Even under <em>de novo </em>review, he has not established that his counsel\u2019s performance was deficient.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> <em>Cf. Allen v. Sec\u2019y, Fla. Dep\u2019t of Corr., </em>611 F.3d 740, 753 (11th Cir.2010) (\u201c[E]ven if no deference were due the state collateral trial court\u2019s decision on <em>[Strickland's </em>] performance element, we would conclude on <em>de novo </em>review that [the petitioner] had failed to establish it.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b834-4\">To establish deficient performance, Barriner \u201cmust show that counsel\u2019s representation fell below an objective standard of reasonableness.\u201d <em>Strickland, </em>466 U.S. at 688, 104 S.Ct. at 2064. That \u201ctest has nothing to do with what the best lawyers would have done. Nor is the test even what most good lawyers would have done. We ask only whether some reasonable lawyer at the trial could have acted, in the circumstances, as defense counsel acted at trial.\u201d <em>Waters v. Thomas, </em>46 F.3d 1506, 1512 (11th Cir.1995) (en banc) (quotation marks omitted). In other words, Barriner \u201cmust establish that no competent counsel would have taken the action that his counsel did take.\u201d <em>Chandler v. United States, </em>218 F.3d 1305, 1315 (11th Cir.2000) (en banc). That test \u201ccalls for an objective inquiry.\u201d <em>Castillo v. Florida, Sec\u2019y of DOC, </em>722 F.3d 1281, 1285 n. 2 (11th Cir.2013). Here, that means asking \u201cwhether any reasonable lawyer could have elected not to object for strategic or tactical reasons,\u201d not whether \u201cthe actual defense counsel was ... subjectively motivated by those reasons.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Though the test is an objective one, it \u201cevaluate[s] the conduct from counsel\u2019s perspective at the time.\u201d <em>Strickland, </em>466 U.S. at 689, 104 S.Ct. at 2065. Courts therefore must resist the urge to second-guess trial counsel\u2019s decision using the benefit of hindsight. <em>See Waters, </em>46 F.3d at 1514 (collecting cases).</p>\n<p id=\"b834-7\">Here, counsel\u2019s performance fell \u201cwithin the wide range of reasonable professional assistance.\u201d <em>Strickland, </em>466 U.S. at 689, 104 S.Ct. at 2065. Both attorneys stood before the trial judge faced with this legal question from the jury: \u201c[I]s there a Florida statute that encompasses both assault and trespass?\u201d The prosecutor correctly answered \u201cno.\u201d Defense counsel agreed. As the state trial court acknowledged in Barriner\u2019s state post-conviction proceeding, that was the correct answer to the jury\u2019s question. Agreeing with an accurate answer to a pure question of law is not deficient performance under <em>Strickland.</em><footnotemark><em>5</em></footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b835-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"807\">*807</page-number>Furthermore, even if defense counsel acquiesced in ari \u25a0 erroneous jury instruction, there was a sound strategic reason to do so. <em>See Gordon v. United States, </em>518 F.3d 1291, 1300 (11th Cir.2008) (\u201cCounsel may decide, for strategic reasons, not to object to an obvious error\u201d). Counsel could have made the logical inference, based on the jury question, that the jurors had decided that Barriner was guilty of assault and trespass, and they wanted to know if there was a statute that would allow them to convict him of both of the crimes that they specified in their question or they instead were required to pick one of the two'. So the circumstances at that time reasonably could have been interpreted as indicating that Barriner was facing the possibility of being convicted of either: (1) just trespass of a structure, (2) just assault, or (3) both trespass and assault. Faced with those options, counsel\u2019s answer was a reasonable strategic choice. A reasonable, competent lawyer could have concluded that the answer would result in Barriner being convicted of just one lesser included offense instead of two. That would have been the better result for Barriner because a conviction for both trespass and assault obviously carries the potential for a longer sentence than a conviction for just one of those offenses. It follows that counsel reasonably could have interpreted the question in a way that would have made a \u201cno\u201d answer the best one for his client. It matters not whether Barriner\u2019s trial counsel actually did. <em>See Castillo, </em>722 F.3d at 1285 n. 2.</p>\n<p id=\"b835-6\">Given the circumstances, there was no reason for counsel to think that a negative answer would increase the risk of Barriner being convicted of burglary of an unoccupied dwelling. Under Florida law, burglary of an unoccupied dwelling requires, among other things, an entry with the \u201cintent to commit an offense therein.\u201d Fla. Stat. Ann. \u00a7 810.02(l)(b), (3)(b) (West 2009). Neither trespass of a structure nor assault contains that entry-with-intent element. <em>See id. </em>\u00a7\u00a7 784.011, 810.08. In fact, that entry-with-intent element is the crucial difference between burglary and trespass of a structure. <em>Compare id. </em>\u00a7 810.02(1)(b) (including the element), <em>with id. </em>\u00a7 810.08 (omitting it). So the fact that the jury\u2019s question included the trespass-of-a-structure offense and omitted any burglary offense implied that the jurors had eliminated burglary as a possibility. Many \u201ccompetent counsel\u201d would have drawn that inference. <em>See Chandler, </em>218 F.3d at 1315. By contrast, there was nothing in the jury\u2019s question to suggest (as the lawyer-juror\u2019s letter eventually would) that the jurors had disregarded their oaths and decided to base their verdict on what they thought the proper sentence should be. <em>Cf. Sanders v. State, </em>946 So.2d 953, 958 (Fla.2006) (explaining that Florida jurors violate their oaths and the court\u2019s instruction if they choose their verdict based on the sentence length and not the evidence). Even if it might seem likely in hindsight that the jurors would settle on an offense other than one listed in their question, Strickland\u2019s test forbids that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"808\">*808</page-number>kind of second-guessing. <em>See Waters, </em>46 F.3d at 1514.</p>\n<p id=\"b836-4\">REVERSED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b831-7\">. When Jones was cross-examined by defense counsel, he denied that Barriner had paid him $500 for marijuana.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b832-5\">. In context, defense counsel\u2019s answer to the question, that the jurors \"have to agree,\u201d is implicitly agreeing that there is no statute and stressing the notion that the jury has to pick either assault or trespass instead of both. In other words, the jurors were required to agree on the one \"highest offense that ha[d] been proven beyond a reasonable doubt,\u201d as the trial court had instructed.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b832-11\">. Barriner\u2019s other challenges on direct appeal are not at issue in this appeal, so we need not describe them.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b834-5\">. Because trial counsel's performance was not deficient, we need not fully address the prejudice prong of <em>Strickland. See Cox v. McNeil, </em>638 F.3d 1356, 1362 (11th Cir.2011). The fact that we do not should not, however, be interpreted as a sign that we believe Barri-ner's theory of prejudice has merit. Like all petitioners, Barriner has the burden of establishing prejudice. <em>See Johnson v. Alabama, </em>256 F.3d 1156, 1176 (11th Cir.2001). We are not aware of any law or facts indicating that the trial judge would have, or under state law correctly could have, answered the jury\u2019s question any way other than the way he did. No one has pointed to any Florida statute that criminalizes both assault and trespass. The jury asked if there is one, and the judge\u2019s answer that there is not was correct.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b834-8\">. The district court asserted that counsel performed deficiently by answering the jury\u2019s question before he had \u201cresearched Florida law to ascertain whether the jury could find Petitioner guilty of both trespass and assault.\u201d To be sure, <em>Strickland </em>did establish that trial counsel has a general duty to make a \u201cthorough investigation of law and facts.\u201d 466 U.S. at 690, 104 S.Ct. at 2066. But it was speaking of investigation before the trial begins. <em>See id. </em>at 680-81, 104 S.Ct. at 2060-61. We are not aware of any decision from this Court or any other that extends <em>Strickland </em>so far as to require defense counsel, when faced with a jury question presenting a purely legal issue, to request additional time for legal research' before offering an answer to the trial judge. Because of the need to answer the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"807\">*807</page-number>jury\u2019s question promptly, most trial courts handle jury questions the same way that the state court did here: call the attorneys in, show them the question, get their thoughts, reach a conclusion, call the jurors in, and give them the answer. Most if not all counsel would have offered an immediate answer when presented with a jury question like this one. <em>Cf. Bates v. Sec\u2019y, Fla. Dep't of Corr., </em>768 F.3d 1278, 1295 (11th Cir.2014) (noting that good lawyers \u201dknow[] that judges and juries have limited time and limited patience\u201d and act accordingly). It was not deficient performance for counsel here to take the same approach that many other lawyers would have taken.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
