He argues that his plea, pursuant to <em>North Carolina v. Alford, </em>400 U.S. 25, 37, 91 S.Ct. 160, 27 L.Ed.2d 162 (1970), to a Mississippi rape charge was insufficient evidence that he violated the mandatory condition of his supervised release that he not commit another federal, state, or local offense.</p>\n<p id=\"b370-4\">A district court may revoke a defendant\u2019s supervised release if it finds by a preponderance of the evidence that he has violated a condition of his release. <em>United States v. Minnitt, </em>617 F.3d 327, 332 (5th Cir.2010); 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3583(e)(3). We review for abuse of discretion. <em>See Minnitt, </em>617 F.3d at 332. Revocation of supervised release does not require proof sufficient to sustain a criminal conviction. <em>United States v. Spraglin, </em>418 F.3d 479, 481 (5th Cir.2005). Instead, \u201c[a]ll that is required is enough evidence, within a sound judicial discretion,\u201d to satisfy the district court that the defendant has violated the terms of his supervised release. <em>Id. </em>(internal quotation marks and citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b370-5\">Mississippi procedure permits a defendant to enter an <em>Alford </em>plea, which allows him to maintain his innocence but concede the State had sufficient evidence to convict him. <em>See, e.g., Williams v. State, 119 </em>So.3d 404, 408 (Miss.Ct.App.2013). Here, Clifton confirmed that he was entering an <em>Alford </em>plea because, based on three days of trial testimony, he would likely be convicted. Given Mississippi\u2019s treatment of <em>Alford </em>pleas, Clifton\u2019s <em>Alford </em>plea was sufficient evidence to satisfy the district court that Clifton\u2019s conduct had not met the conditions of his supervised release. <em>See Spraglin, </em>418 F.3d at 481; <em>see United States v. Fleming, </em>3 F.3d 437, 1993 WL 347098, *1 (5th Cir.1993).</p>\n<p id=\"b370-6\">Clifton argues that his 48-month sentence, which was above the guidelines policy statement range of 30 to 37 months, was greater than necessary to achieve the 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a) factors. He contends that a sentence within the recommended policy statement range was warranted because prior to incarceration, he was a productive member of society, working at Wal-Mart, and supporting his family, and he had spent four years in state custody and was transferred into the Marshals\u2019 custody on the day he was supposed to be released.</p>\n<p id=\"b370-8\">This court generally reviews \u201ca sentence imposed on revocation of supervised release under a \u2018plainly unreasonable\u2019 standard, in a two-step process.\u201d <em>United States v. Warren, </em>720 F.3d 321, 326 (5th Cir.2013). In conducting this review, this court follows the procedural and substantive considerations that are employed in the review of original sentences, but provides more deference to revocation sentences than to original sentences. <em>See United States v. Miller, </em>634 F.3d 841, 843 (5th Cir.2011). As Clifton argues no procedural error, the issue is whether his sentence was substantively reasonable under abuse of discretion review. <em>See Warren, </em>720 F.3d at 326.</p>\n<p id=\"b370-9\">The district court may impose any sentence that falls within the appropriate statutory maximum term of imprisonment allowed for the revocation sentence. 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3583(e)(3). In so doing, the district court is directed to consider the factors enumerated in \u00a7 3553(a), including the nonbinding policy statements found in Chapter Seven of the Sentencing Guidelines. <em>United States v. Mathena, </em>23 F.3d 87, 90-93 (5th Cir.1994).</p>\n<p id=\"b370-10\">By statute, the maximum term of imprisonment to which the district court could sentence Clifton upon revocation of his supervised release was five years. <em>See </em>\u00a7 3583(e)(3). Thus, Clifton\u2019s sentence was within the statutory maximum. Additionally, the court considered the relevant <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"343\">*343</page-number>\u00a7 8553(a) factors when it discussed Clifton\u2019s policy statement range of imprisonment and Clifton\u2019s \u201chistory and characteristics.\u201d <em>See </em>\u00a7 3553(a)(1), (a)(4)(B). Thus, Clifton\u2019s sentence was not substantively unreasonable.</p>\n<p id=\"b371-5\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b369-33\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
