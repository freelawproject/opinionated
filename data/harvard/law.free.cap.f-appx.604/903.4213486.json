In dismissing Adams\u2019s complaint, the district court determined that he had abused the judicial process by failing to disclose numerous previous lawsuits on the court\u2019s standard complaint form, and that, in the alternative, he failed to state a claim of deliberate indifference. On appeal, Adams argues that his complaint stated a claim for relief because he alleged that Dr. Hale Burnside did not refer him to a specialist to perform surgery for an injury to his rotator cuff; did not prescribe special soap and lotion for an AIDS-related skin condition; did not prescribe a 3,000 calorie, high-fiber diet; and did not ensure that he received hot meals. Adams also contends that he was denied his Sixth Amendment right to appointed counsel in this case. He does not address the district court\u2019s conclusion that he abused the judicial process by failing to disclose prior lawsuits.</p>\n<p id=\"b931-23\">Upon a thorough review of the record, and after consideration of the parties\u2019 briefs, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b932-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"904\">*904</page-number>We review the district court\u2019s denial of appointed counsel and imposition of sanctions pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915 for abuse of discretion. <em>Bass v. Perrin, </em>170 F.3d 1312, 1320 (11th Cir.1999); <em>Attwood v. Singletary, </em>105 F.3d 610, 612 (11th Cir.1997). Although we liberally construe <em>pro se </em>pleadings, \u201cissues not briefed on appeal by a <em>pro se </em>litigant are deemed abandoned.\u201d <em>Timson v. Sampson, </em>518 F.3d 870, 874 (11th Cir.2008). Under \u00a7 1915, \u201c[a] finding that the plaintiff engaged in bad faith litigiousness or manipulative tactics warrants dismissal.\u201d <em>Attwood, </em>105 F.3d at 613.</p>\n<p id=\"b932-4\">The district court did not abuse its discretion in denying Adams\u2019s motion for appointment of counsel. Because this is a civil case, Adams \u201chas no constitutional right to counsel\u201d under the Sixth Amendment. <em>Bass, </em>170 F.3d at 1320. Moreover, his deliberate indifference claim does not involve legal or factual issues that are \u201cso novel or complex as to require the assistance of a trained practitioner.\u201d <em>Kilgo v. Ricks, </em>983 F.2d 189, 193 (11th Cir.1993). Furthermore, because Adams has offered no argument challenging the district court\u2019s dismissal of his complaint for abuse of the judicial process, he has abandoned this issue. Thus, we affirm both the denial of appointed counsel and the dismissal of Adams\u2019s complaint for abuse of the judicial process.</p>\n<p id=\"b932-5\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
