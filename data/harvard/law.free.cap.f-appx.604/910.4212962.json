Even if we read Duval\u2019s petition liberally to argue that his indictment was defective because it was not signed by the grand jury foreperson, he was not entitled to relief. Duval\u2019s knowing, voluntary, and unconditional pleas of guilty \u201cwaive[d] all nonjurisdictional defects in the proceeding.\u201d <em>United States v. Payne, </em>763 F.3d 1301, 1303 n. 1 (11th Cir.2014). The purported absence of the foreperson\u2019s signature was \u201ca mere technical irregularity,\u201d <em>Hobby v. United States, </em>468 U.S. 339, 345, 104 S.Ct. 3093, 3096, 82 L.Ed.2d 260 (1984), that did not affect the authority of the district court to enter its judgment. <em>See United States v. Cotton, </em>535 U.S. 625, 630, 122 S.Ct. 1781, 1785, 152 L.Ed.2d 860 (2002). Duval could have moved to dismiss the charges against him based on an alleged \u201cdefect in [his] indictment,\u201d but the motion had to be filed before trial. Fed.R.Crim.P. 12(b)(3). And a motion that challenged the jurisdiction of the district court had to be filed \u201cwhile [his] case [was] pending.\u201d <em>Id. </em>12(b)(2). Duval\u2019s case was no longer pending after <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"911\">*911</page-number>the 14-day period to appeal his conviction expired on April 25, 2014. See Fed. R.App. P. 4(b)(l)(A)(i); <em>Akins v. United States, </em>204 F.3d 1086, 1089 n. 1 (11th Cir.2000). In any event, the record establishes that the foreperson signed Duval\u2019s indictment, and the Clerk of the district court redacted the foreperson\u2019s signature before filing the indictment as a public record.</p>\n<p id=\"b939-5\">We AFFIRM the denial of Duval\u2019s petition.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
