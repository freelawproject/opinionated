The Magistrate Judge held that RMB had raised the bona fide error defense to the Isaacs\u2019 FDCPA claims.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The Isaacs con<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"820\">*820</page-number>tend that was error. The Isaacs also appeal the Magistrate Judge\u2019s order awarding costs and compelling them to attend a deposition after the initial discovery period. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b848-4\">T.</p>\n<p id=\"b848-5\">We review <em>de novo </em>a grant of summary judgment, viewing all evidence in the light most favorable to the nonmoving party\u2014 here, the Isaacs. <em>See Owen v. I.C. Sys., Inc., </em>629 F.3d 1263, 1270 (11th Cir.2011). Summary judgment is appropriate when the record presents no genuine issue of material fact and \u201cthe moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b848-6\">The FDCPA prohibits a debt collector from calling a consumer once notified that the consumer wishes the debt collector to cease communication. 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 1692c(c). It further proscribes calling a consumer \u201crepeatedly or continuously with intent to annoy, abuse, or harass,\u201d as well as calling \u201cwithout meaningfully] disclosing] ... the caller\u2019s identity.\u201d <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 1692d(5), (6). But the Act provides an affirmative defense from liability: the bona fide error defense. <em>Edwards v. Niagara Credit Solutions, Inc., </em>584 F.3d 1350, 1352 (11th Cir.2009). To assert the bona fide error defense, a debt collector must prove by a preponderance of evidence that its violation of the FDCPA was unintentional and was the result of a bona fide error, despite procedures reasonably adapted to avoid errors. 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 1692k(c). A bona fide error is a mistake that occurred in good faith. <em>Edwards, </em>584 F.3d at 1353.</p>\n<p id=\"b848-7\">The Isaacs contend that RMB violated the FDCPA in three ways: (1) continuing to call them despite receiving a cease-and-desist letter;. (2) calling them with the intent to annoy or harass; and (3) hanging up on Albert Isaac when he answered its calls without disclosing its identity. But based on the undisputed facts, the Magistrate Judge did not err in holding that all three alleged violations were the result of bona fide errors. First, RMB had two specifically trained employees who ordinarily processed cease-and-desist letters. Both employees were absent when RMB received the Isaacs\u2019 cease-and-desist letter \u2014 one on maternity leave and the other with an unexpected illness. Although the calls continued for seventeen days after RMB received the letter, as soon as the letter was logged the calls ceased without further action by the Isaacs.</p>\n<p id=\"b848-9\">Second, the Isaacs adduced no evidence that RMB called them with the intent to annoy or harass. RMB was attempting to collect debts owed by the Isaacs\u2019 adult daughter and Albert Isaac\u2019s mother. Those debtors gave the Isaacs\u2019 phone number to RMB. In any event, RMB\u2019s calls to the Isaacs were relatively infrequent and did not evidence intent to annoy or harass.</p>\n<p id=\"b848-10\">Third, RMB used a computer program to detect whether a call reached a live person or an answering machine. The caller would identify herself only if the program detected the call was answered by a live person. This software mistook Albert Isaac\u2019s unusually long introduction to be an answering machine\u2019s outgoing message, resulting in termination of the call without disclosure of the caller\u2019s identity. _</p>\n<p id=\"b848-11\">The Magistrate Judge properly held that RMB\u2019s policies and procedures were reasonably adapted to avoid the kinds of errors that occurred in this case, and that the errors did not occur in bad faith. <em>See Edwards, </em>584 F.3d at 1352-53. RMB presented a valid bona fide error defense.</p>\n<p id=\"b848-12\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b848-13\">The Isaacs also challenge the Magistrate Judge\u2019s order compelling Rosetta Isaac to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"821\">*821</page-number>attend a second deposition after the discovery period had ended and awarding RMB the cost of filing a motion to compel her attendance. In her first deposition, Rosetta Isaac refused to answer many of RMB\u2019s questions and repeatedly objected that the questions were irrelevant. We review the Magistrate Judge\u2019s actions for an abuse of discretion. <em>See Serra Chevrolet, Inc. v. Gen. Motors Corp., </em>446 F.3d 1137, 1146-47 (11th Cir.2006); <em>Chudasama v. Mazda Motor Corp., </em>123 F.3d 1353, 1366 (11th Cir.1997).</p>\n<p id=\"b849-5\">A deponent may refuse to answer ques- \u2022 tions only if \u201cnecessary to preserve a privilege, to enforce a limitation ordered by the court, or to present a motion\u201d to terminate the deposition for abuse. Fed.R.Civ.P. 30(c)(2) (a deposition objection \u201cmust be noted on the record, but the examination still proceeds\u201d). The Isaacs have never argued that any of these exceptions applied, so Rosetta Isaac wrongfully refused to answer nearly all of RMB\u2019s questions.</p>\n<p id=\"b849-6\">The Magistrate Judge thus had ample authority to compel her to attend another deposition, even after the discovery deadline, because she impeded the original deposition. <em>See </em>Fed.R.Civ.P. 37(a)(3)(B)(i) (court may compel a party to answer questions after she refuses to do so); Fed.R.Civ.P. 30(a)(2)(A)(ii) (court may grant leave for a second deposition); Fed. R.Civ.P. 29 (court may alter discovery procedures). The award of costs was also proper. <em>See </em>Fed.R.Civ.P. 37(a)(5)(A) (pro-, viding that if a motion to compel is granted, the court \u201cmust, after giving an opportunity to be heard, require the party or deponent whose conduct necessitated the motion ... to pay the movant\u2019s reasonable expenses incurred in making the motion, including attorney\u2019s fees\u201d). The Isaacs have never argued that an award of costs would be unjust. <em>See </em>Fed.R.Civ.P. 37(a)(5)(A)(ii), (iii) (court must not award costs if a deponent\u2019s nondisclosure was substantially justified or the circumstances otherwise make such an award unjust).</p>\n<p id=\"b849-8\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b847-15\">. The parties consented to the jurisdiction of the Magistrate Judge, so the order he issued is appealable.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
