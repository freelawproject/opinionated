Their complaint alleges that Wells Fargo fraudulently induced them to obtain a $600,000 home equity loan for which they were unqualified and one which they were unable to pay back. They contend that the statute of limitations clock began to run either in (1) April of 2007 when they closed on the loan, or (2) July 2008 when William Mar-tucci, Yamel\u2019s father, ceased making payments on the loan, which is when they either discovered or should have discovered the accrual of the fraud. Taking the allegations of the complaint as true and upon thorough review, we conclude that the district court was correct in dismissing the case pursuant to Federal Rule of Criminal Procedure 12(b)(6) because the Gonzalezes\u2019 complaint was filed more than four years after <em>either </em>scenario. Therefore, the judgment of the district court is</p>\n<p id=\"b936-19\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
