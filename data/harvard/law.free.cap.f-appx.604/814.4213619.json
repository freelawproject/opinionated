After a thorough review, we conclude that the -district court erred under \u00a7 2255(f)(4) because, after determining that Dauphin had not exercised due diligence in discovering that his attorney had failed to file an appeal, the court did not consider whether Dauphin had filed his \u00a7 2255 motion within one year of when a reasonable person in his situation, acting with due diligence, would have discovered that no appeal had been filed. As such, we vacate the court\u2019s denial of Dauphin\u2019s \u00a7 2255 motion as time-barred, and remand the case for further proceedings consistent \u25a0with this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b843-15\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b843-16\">In 2011, Dauphin pleaded guilty to bank robbery by force, in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2113(a) and (d), and brandishing a firearm during a crime of violence, in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924(c)(l)(A)(ii). He received a total sentence of 120 months\u2019 imprisonment. Dauphin did not. file an appeal and his convictions became final on July 27, 2011.</p>\n<p id=\"b843-17\">Dauphin filed his instant \u00a7 2255 motion on August 28, 2012, alleging, <em>inter alia, </em>that he was denied effective assistance of counsel because his attorney failed to follow his instructions to file an appeal. He maintained that the limitations period was subject to equitable tolling until July 2012, when he discovered that defense counsel had not filed an appeal. Dauphin explained that he had instructed his attorney to file an appeal and he did not discover that his attorney had failed to do so until \u201cnearly a year later.\u201d In any event, he <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"816\">*816</page-number>argued that he filed his \u00a7 2255 motion \u201cjust a little over a month\u201d after the one-year deadline, and \u201c[ujnder any circumstance^,] a 30 day delay in discovering that an appeal was not filed is not unreasonable[.j\u201d Thus, his \u00a7 2255 motion should be considered timely under \u00a7 2255(f)(4).</p>\n<p id=\"b844-4\">The magistrate judge issued a report and recommendation (R '&amp; R), concluding that Dauphin\u2019s \u00a7 2255 motion was time-barred because it was filed more than one year after the deadline for filing an appeal. In analyzing whether Dauphin\u2019s \u00a7 2255 motion was timely under \u00a7 2255(f)(4), the magistrate judge determined that, even if all of his allegations were taken as true, Dauphin did not demonstrate that he had exercised due diligence in discovering that his attorney had failed to file an appeal because he had not explained why he had waited until seven months after his last contact with counsel in December 2011 to check on the status of his appeal. Overruling Dauphin\u2019s objections, the district court adopted the magistrate judge\u2019s R &amp; R and further denied Dauphin a certificate of appealability (COA).</p>\n<p id=\"b844-5\">This court granted a COA on the issue of whether the district court procedurally erred by failing to consider if Dauphin\u2019s motion to vacate was timely under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255(f)(4) with respect to his claim that his defense counsel was ineffective for failing to file a direct appeal after being instructed to do so. The instant appeal followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b844-6\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b844-7\">As a preliminary matter, we must consider whether the COA issued in this case was defective. <em>See </em>28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2253(c)(1)(B), (2) (noting that neither an appellate court nor a district court judge may issue a COA of a final order in a \u00a7 2255 proceeding unless the applicant has made a substantial showing of the denial of a constitutional right). The COA \u201cshall indicate which specific issue or issues satisfy the showing required.\u201d <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 2253(c)(3).</p>\n<p id=\"b844-9\">Recently, we concluded that the COA issued in a \u00a7 2255 proceeding was defective because it failed to identify an underlying constitutional issue, as required by \u00a7 2253(c)(3). <em>Spencer v. United States, </em>773 F.3d 1132, 1137-38 (11th Cir.2014) <em>(en </em>banc). Nonetheless, we declined to vacate the COA and considered the merits of the appeal because (1) the parties already had litigated the issues before the district court and briefed and orally argued the issues before a panel of this court and then <em>en banc; </em>(2) the <em>en banc </em>court heard argument by an <em>amicus curie; </em>and (3) both parties urged the court not to vacate the defective COA. <em>Id. </em>But this court further cautioned:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b844-10\">We will not be so lenient in future appeals when a certificate fails to conform to the gatekeeping requirements imposed by Congress. Going forward, a certificate of appealability, whether issued by this Court or a district court, must specify what constitutional issue jurists of reason would find debatable. Even when a prisoner seeks to appeal a procedural error, the certificate must specify the underlying constitutional issue. ... A failure to specify that issue would violate the text enacted by Congress, <em>see </em>28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2253(c)(3), and will result in the vacatur of the certificate.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b844-11\"><em>Id. </em>at 1138.</p>\n<p id=\"b844-12\">Here, neither party has addressed the sufficiency of the COA. <em>Spencer </em>makes clear that the COA in this case is defective under \u00a7 2253(c)(3) because it does not specify an underlying constitutional issue jurists of reason could find debatable. <em>See id. </em>Given that the parties have already <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"817\">*817</page-number>fully briefed the relevant constitutional issues on appeal, however, we expand the COA to conform with <em>Spencer </em>as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AKB\">Whether the district court erred in failing to consider if Dauphin\u2019s motion to vacate was timely under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255(f)(4) because defense counsel\u2019s failure to file a timely notice of appeal, after being instructed to do so, resulted in the denial of Dauphin\u2019s Sixth Amendment right to effective assistance of counsel.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b845-5\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b845-6\">Turning to the merits, Dauphin argues that the district court erred by conflating its determination that he was not entitled to equitable tolling of the limitations period, as calculated under \u00a7 2255(f)(1), with its determination of the-limitations period under \u00a7 2255(f)(4). He maintains that, although the district court determined that he had not exercised due diligence in discovering that his attorney had failed to file an appeal, according to \u00a7 2255(f)(4), the limitations period began on the date that a hypothetical, rational prisoner, exercising a reasonable degree of due diligence, would have discovered that fact. Due to the conditions of prison life, Dauphin asserts that a presumption that a prisoner could not have discovered the non-filing of an appeal until 90 days after sentencing should apply.</p>\n<p id=\"b845-7\">We review <em>de novo </em>the district court\u2019s determination that a \u00a7 2255 motion to vacate is time-barred. <em>Jones v. United States, </em>304 F.3d 1035, 1037 (11th Cir.2002).</p>\n<p id=\"b845-8\">A prisoner in custody under a federal sentence may move the district court to vacate, set aside, or correct his sentence on the ground that: his sentence was imposed in violation of the Constitution or federal law; the district court lacked jurisdiction to impose the sentence; the sentence exceeded the maximum authorized by law; or the sentence is otherwise subject to collateral attack. 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255(a). The Antiterrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act (AEDPA) imposes a one-year statute of limitations for filing a \u00a7 2255 motion, which begins to run, relevant to this appeal, from the latest of:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"A0s\">(1) the date on which the judgment of conviction becomes final; \u2022</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b845-10\">(4) the date on which the facts supporting the claim or claims presented could have been discovered through the exercise of due diligence.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b845-11\"><em>Id. </em>\u00a7 2255(f). If a criminal defendant does not pursue a direct appeal, his conviction becomes final when the time for filing a notice of appeal expires. <em>See Mederos v. United States, </em>218 F.3d 1252, 1253 (11th Cir.2000).</p>\n<p id=\"AKV\">In <em>Aron v. United States, </em>we explained that, under \u00a7 2255(f)(4), the statute of limitations \u201cis triggered by a date that is not necessarily related to a petitioner\u2019s actual efforts or actual discovery of the relevant facts.\u201d 291 F.3d 708, 711 (11th Cir.2002). In conducting the inquiry under \u00a7 2255(f)(4), the district court should first consider whether the petitioner exercised due diligence. <em>Id. </em>If the court finds that he did so, then the one-year limitations period begins to run on the date he actually discovered the relevant facts because the dates of actual and possible discovery would be identical. <em>Id. </em>But:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b845-13\">[I]f the court finds that the petitioner did <em>not </em>exercise due diligence, the statute does not preclude the possibility that the petitioner\u2019s motion could still be timely under \u00a7 2255[f](4). For example, if the court concludes that, with the exercise of due diligence, the relevant facts could have been discovered two months earlier than the petitioner (who it finds did not exercise due diligence) <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"818\">*818</page-number>actually discovered them, then the motion would still be timely if filed within ten months of the date of actual discovery.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"Aym\"><em>Id. </em>(emphasis in original). Accordingly, if the district court finds that the petitioner did not exercise due diligence, it is required to speculate about the date on which the facts could have been discovered with the exercise of due diligence. <em>Id. </em>at 711 n. 1.</p>\n<p id=\"b846-5\">Due diligence \u201cdoes not require a prisoner to undertake repeated exercises in futility or to exhaust every imaginable option, but rather to make reasonable efforts.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 712. The due diligence inquiry is an individualized inquiry that \u201cmust take into account the conditions of confinement and the reality of the prison system.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b846-6\">In this case, the district court found that Dauphin did not exercise due diligence in discovering that his attorney had failed to file an appeal. But the court ended its inquiry there without considering when that fact could have been reasonably discovered with the exercise of due diligence, and using that date as the starting date for the limitations period under \u00a7 2255(f)(4). <em>See Aron, </em>291 F.3d at 711 &amp; n. 1.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b846-7\">Although there is no support in our case law for Dauphin\u2019s contention that he was entitled to a presumption that a reasonable person in his situation, exercising due diligence, would not have been able to discover that his attorney did not file an appeal until 90 days after sentencing or the appeal-filing deadline, it does seem that a reasonable person, particularly a prisoner, would require some amount of time after the appeal-filing deadline to realize that no appeal had been filed. But the district court made no determination as to what amount of time was reasonable in Dauphin\u2019s situation, and it made no determination as to whether Dauphin\u2019s \u00a7 2255 motion was filed within one year of the date on which that discovery would reasonably have been made. <em>See </em>28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255(f)(4); <em>Aron, </em>291 F.3d at 711 &amp; n. 1.</p>\n<p id=\"b846-10\">Accordingly, we vacate the district court\u2019s denial of Dauphin\u2019s \u00a7 2255 motion as time-barred and remand the case so the district court may conduct the proper inquiry under \u00a7 2255(f)(4).</p>\n<p id=\"b846-11\">VACATED AND REMANDED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b846-8\">. The magistrate judge's reliance on our unpublished decision in <em>Tucker v. United States, </em>249 Fed.Appx. 763 (11th Cir.2007) (unpublished), to the extent it is persuasive, seems misplaced. In <em>Tucker, </em>the magistrate judge concluded, after an evidentiary hearing, that a reasonable person in the petitioner's situation could have discovered that no appeal had been filed at any time after the appeal-filing deadline by contacting the court or his lawyer. <em>Id. </em>at 766. But in Dauphin's case, the magistrate judge made no such finding, and the court held no evidentiary hearing.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
