He argues that the district court erred in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"336\">*336</page-number>imposing a 16-level \u201ccrime of violence\u201d enhancement under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2L1.2(b)(l)(A)(ii) based on -his 2013 Georgia conviction for sexual battery against a child under 16 years of age and that the district court erred in treating his prior offense as an \u201caggravated felony\u201d under 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1326(b)(2). He asserts that (1) the offense does not have as an element the use, attempted use, or threatened use of physical force against another person; (2) the offense is not sexual abuse of a minor because it is not \u201csexual,\u201d as the offense does not have sexual gratification as an element; and (3) the offense is not a forcible sex offense for the same reasons.</p>\n<p id=\"b364-5\">Because Landaverde-Escalante did not object to the enhancement in the district court, review is limited to plain error. <em>See United States v. Chavez-Hernandez, </em>671 F.3d 494, 497 (5th Cir.2012). To demonstrate plain error, he must show a forfeited error that is clear\u2019or obvious and that affects his substantial rights. <em>See Puckett v. United States, </em>556 U.S. 129, 135, 129 S.Ct. 1423, 173 L.Ed.2d 266 (2009). If he makes such a showing, this court has the discretion to correct the error but only if it seriously affects the fairness,' integrity, or public reputation of judicial proceedings. <em>See id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b364-6\">We have not previously addressed whether a Georgia conviction for sexual battery of a minor constitutes sexual abuse of a minor for purposes of \u00a7 2L1.2(b)(1)(A)(ii). When case law is unsettled, we typically will not hold that an error is clear or obvious. <em>United States v. Trejo, </em>610 F.3d 308, 319 (5th Cir.2010); <em>United States v. Miller, </em>665 F.3d 114, 136 (5th Cir.2011). Landaverde-Escalante cites to an opinion of a Georgia federal district court, but he does not cite to an opinion of this court or any other circuit court supporting his claim. <em>See United States v. Hernandez-Gonzalez, </em>842 F.Supp.2d 1373, 1376-77 (M.D.Ga.2012). Given that the case law concerning this issue is unsettled, the district court did not plainly err in imposing a 16-level enhancement under \u00a7 2L1.2(b)(l)(A)(ii) based on the determination that Landaverde-Escalante\u2019s Georgia conviction for sexual battery of a minor constituted sexual abuse of a minor. <em>See Trejo, </em>610 F.3d at 319; <em>Miller, </em>665 F.3d at 136. Moreover, because we use the same analysis to determine whether a prior conviction constitutes sexual abuse of a minor for purposes of both \u00a7 2L1.2 and \u00a7 1326(b)(2), <em>see United States v. Najera-Najera, </em>519 F.3d 509, 512 n. 2 (5th Cir.2008), Landaverde-Escalante also has not shown plain error in the characterization of his offense as involving an \u201caggravated felony\u201d under \u00a7 1326(b). <em>See Puckett, </em>556 U.S. at 135, 129 S.Ct. 1423.</p>\n<p id=\"b364-10\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b363-31\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
