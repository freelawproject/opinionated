He also contends, without explanation, that the consecutive, eight-month sentence imposed following the revocation of his supervised release is unreasonable.</p>\n<p id=\"AZV\">First, Oviedo contends that the within-guidelines sentence imposed following his illegal reentry conviction is substantively unreasonable because it was greater than necessary to accomplish the sentencing goals set forth in 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a). Relying on <em>Kimbrough v. United States, </em>552 U.S. 85, 108-10, 128 S.Ct. 558, 169 L.Ed.2d 481 (2007), he argues that the guidelines range was too severe because U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2L1.2 is not empirically based and double counts a defendant\u2019s criminal record. He also argues that the guidelines range overstated' the seriousness of his non-violent reentry offense and failed to account for his benign motive for returning to the United States. Oviedo acknowledges that his argument that the lack of an empirical basis for \u00a7 2L1.2 precludes an appellate presumption of reasonableness is foreclosed by circuit precedent. <em>See United States v. Mondragon-Santiago, </em>564 F.3d 357, 366-67 (5th Cir.2009). Nevertheless, he seeks to preserve this issue for further review.</p>\n<p id=\"b359-23\">We consider \u201cthe substantive reasonableness of the sentence imposed under an abuse-of-discretion standard.\u201d <em>Gall v. United States, </em>552 U.S. 38, 51, 128 S.Ct. 586, 169 L.Ed.2d 445 (2007). \u201cA discretionary sentence imposed within a properly calculated guidelines range is presumptively reasonable.\u201d <em>United States v. </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"332\">*332</page-number><em>Campos-Maldonado, </em>581 F.3d 337, 338 (5th Cir.2008), To rebut the presumption of reasonableness, the appellant must show that the district court failed to account for a sentencing factor that should have been accorded substantial weight, gave substantial weight to an \u201cirrelevant or improper factor,\u201d or made \u201ca clear error of judgment in balancing [the] sentencing factors.\u201d <em>United States v. Cooks, </em>589 F.3d 173, 186 (5th Cir.2009).</p>\n<p id=\"b360-4\">We have consistently rejected Oviedo\u2019s \u201cempirical data\u201d argument. <em>See id. </em>at 366-67 &amp; n. 7; <em>United States v. Duarte, </em>569 F.3d 528, 530 (5th Cir.2009). We have also rejected arguments that double-counting necessarily renders a sentence unreasonable, <em>see Duarte, </em>569 F.3d at 529-31, and that the Sentencing Guidelines overstate the seriousness of illegal reentry because it is simply a non-violent international trespass offense, <em>see United States v. Aguirre-Villa, </em>460 F.3d 681, 683 (5th Cir.2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b360-5\">The district court considered Oviedo\u2019s mitigation arguments and request for a downward variance, as well as the Government\u2019s arguments in favor of a sentence at the high end of the guidelines range due to Oviedo\u2019s conviction for illegal reentry and his reentry shortly after his deportation. The district court ultimately concluded that a sentence in the middle of the applicable guidelines range was appropriate based on the circumstances of the case and the \u00a7 3553(a) factors. Oviedo\u2019s assertions that \u00a7 2L1.2\u2019s lack of an empirical basis, the double-counting of his prior conviction, the non-violent nature of his offense, and his motive for reentering justified a lower sentence are insufficient to rebut the presumption of reasonableness afforded to within-guidelines sentences. <em>See United States v. Gomez-Herrera, </em>523 F.3d 554, 565-66 (5th Cir.2008); <em>United States v. Rodriguez, </em>523 F.3d 519, 526 (5th Cir.2008). The fact that we might reasonably conclude that a different sentence was appropriate is insufficient to justify reversal. <em>Gall, </em>552 U.S. at 51, 128 S.Ct. 586; <em>United States v. Williams, </em>517 F.3d 801, 809 (5th Cir.2008). Therefore, Oviedo has failed to show that his 34-month within-guidelines sentence is substantively unreasonable. <em>See Campos-Maldonado, </em>531 F.3d at 338.</p>\n<p id=\"b360-7\">Next, Oviedo contends, without any explanation, that the consecutive, eight-month sentence imposed following the revocation of his supervised release is plainly unreasonable. We could deem this issue abandoned due to Oviedo\u2019s failure to adequately brief the issue. <em>See United States v. Cothran, </em>302 F.3d 279, 286 n. 7 (5th Cir.2002). Regardless, Oviedo\u2019s consecutive sentence argument fails.</p>\n<p id=\"b360-8\">We review preserved challenges to revocation sentences under a deferential plainly unreasonable standard. <em>United States v. Miller, </em>634 F.3d 841, 843 (5th Cir.2011). The presumption of reasonableness afforded to within-guidelines sentences also applies to within-guidelines revocation sentences. <em>See United States v. Lopez-Velasquez, </em>526 F.3d 804, 809 (5th Cir.2008).</p>\n<p id=\"b360-9\">Oviedo\u2019s eight-month sentence was within the range recommended by the policy statements and within the statutory maximum term of imprisonment that the district court could have imposed. <em>See </em>18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3583(e)(3); U.S.S.G. \u00a7 7B1.4(a). Further, we have repeatedly upheld as reasonable within-guidelines revocation sentences ordered to run consecutively to the sentence for the criminal offense leading to the revocation. <em>United States v. Ramirez, </em>264 Fed.Appx. 454, 458-59 (5th Cir.2008). Therefore, Oviedo has failed to show that his revocation sentence is plainly unreasonable. <em>See Miller, </em>634 F.3d at 843.</p>\n<p id=\"b361-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"333\">*333</page-number>Accordingly, the district court\u2019s judgments are AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b359-19\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent ex.cept under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir.
