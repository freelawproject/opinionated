They appeal the district court\u2019s dismissal of their complaint for failure to state a claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b949-24\">We review <em>de novo </em>a grant of a motion to dismiss under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 12(b)(6). <em>Glover v. Liggett Grp., Inc., </em>459 F.3d 1304, 1308 (11th Cir.2006). A court is permitted to consider documents extraneous to the pleadings without converting a motion to dismiss into a motion for summary judgment if (1) they are central to the claim and (2) their authenticity is not challenged. <em>SFM Holdings, Ltd. v. Banc of Am. Sec., LLC, </em>600 F.3d 1334, 1337 (11th Cir.2010).</p>\n<p id=\"b949-25\">The Willises do not deny that they executed mortgage documents containing a power of sale provision that gives the original owner of the security deed or its \u201csuccessors and assigns\u201d the right to foreclose in the event of default. Nor do they deny that they defaulted. Instead, their sole contention \u2014 upon which they assert claims of fraud, slander, wrongful foreclosure, in<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"922\">*922</page-number>tentional infliction of emotional distress, negligence, and unjust enrichment \u2014 is that Goldman Sachs Mortgage Company (GSMC) was never assigned the security deed and therefore cannot lawfully commence foreclosure proceedings. But that contention is belied by real estate records attached to the defendants\u2019 motion to dismiss, including a notarized \u201cCorporate Assignment of Mortgage\u201d from assignor M &amp; T Bank to assignee GSMC filed in Clayton County, Georgia, on March 3, 2011.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The Willises, confronted with that record of assignment, do not contest its authenticity or its validity. Instead, they persist in asserting that the assignment never happened without any explanation for how or why an allegedly nonexistent document came to exist in the record before the district court and this Court.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b950-4\">Simply put, the Willises\u2019 complaint \u201ctenders naked assertions devoid of further factual enhancement\u201d and fails to \u201cstate a claim to relief that is plausible on its face.\u201d <em>Ashcroft v. Iqbal, </em>556 U.S. 662, 678, 129 S.Ct. 1937, 1949, 173 L.Ed.2d 868 (2009) (internal quotation marks and alteration omitted). It does not survive Rule 12(b)(6).</p>\n<p id=\"b950-5\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b950-6\">. That assignment includes the following provision: \"Assignor hereby assigns unto [GSMC], the said Mortgage, secured thereby, with all moneys now owing or that may hereafter become due or owing in respect thereof, and the full benefit of all powers and all of the covenants and provisos contained therein.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b950-22\">. The Willises do not argue that the district court's consideration of documents extraneous to the pleadings was improper. Any such claim is therefore abandoned. <em>See Timson v. Sampson, </em>518 F.3d 870, 874 (11th Cir.2008) (stating that issues not briefed on appeal by <em>pro se </em>litigants are deemed abandoned).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
