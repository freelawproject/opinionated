Because relators failed to comply with the personal-knowledge requirement of S.Ct.Prac.R. X(4)(B), we dismiss the cause.</p>\n<p id=\"b606-12\">{\u00b6 2} Relators Lucian A. Dade, Karen Dade, and Eric Hansen are electors, residents, and taxpayers of respondent city of Bay Village, Ohio. The individual relators formed a committee and decided to circulate and file a petition proposing a charter amendment. Relator Committee for the Charter Amendment for an Elected Law Director is the committee formed by the individual relators.</p>\n<p id=\"b606-13\">{\u00b6 3} On August 29, 2007, the committee filed with respondent Joan T. Kemper, the clerk of council for the city of Bay Village, a petition containing 46 part-petitions and 907 signatures. The petition requested that respondent Bay Village City Council enact an ordinance to submit a proposed charter amendment to the electorate. The amendment is entitled \u201cA Proposed Charter Amendment to provide for the election of the Director of Law by the electorate, and to provide for the office of the Director of Law by amending Sections 4.2, 4.3, and 11.2 of the Bay Village City Charter.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b607-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"401\">*401</page-number>{\u00b6 4} On September 6, 2007, the city council held a special meeting to consider the petition and vote on an ordinance to submit the proposed charter amendment to the electorate at the November 6, 2007 election. The council defeated the ordinance and refused to submit the proposed charter amendment to the electorate at the November 6, 2007 election.</p>\n<p id=\"b607-5\">{\u00b6 5} On September 10, relators, the committee and its three members, filed this expedited election action for a writ of mandamus to compel respondents, Bay Village, the clerk of council, and the city council, to submit the proposed charter amendment to the electorate at the November 6, 2007 general election. Relators filed an affidavit of their counsel with the complaint. Respondents filed an answer, and the parties filed evidence and briefs.</p>\n<p id=\"b607-6\">{\u00b6 6} This cause is now before the court for its consideration of relators\u2019 mandamus claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b607-7\">S.Ct.Prac.R. X(4)(B)</p>\n<p id=\"b607-8\">{\u00b6 7} Respondents contend that this case should be dismissed because relators failed to comply with S.Ct.Prae.R. X(4)(B), which provides that affidavits supporting an original action other than habeas corpus filed in this court must specify the details of the claim, set forth facts admissible in evidence, and be made on personal knowledge:</p>\n<p id=\"b607-9\">{\u00b6 8} \u201cAll complaints shall contain a specific statement of facts upon which the claim for relief is based, shall be supported by an affidavit of the relator or counsel specifying the details of the claim, and may be accompanied by a memorandum in support of the writ. The affidavit required by this division shall be made on personal knowledge, setting forth facts admissible in evidence, and showing affirmatively that the affiant is competent to testify to all matters stated in the affidavit.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b607-10\">{\u00b6 9} Relators supported their complaint in mandamus with their counsel\u2019s affidavit, in which he stated that he had read and reviewed the complaint and that based upon his \u201cpersonal knowledge and information the fact[ ] statements and claims\u201d contained in the complaint \u201care true and correct.\u201d Relators\u2019 counsel also stated that based on his \u201cpersonal knowledge and information,\u201d the exhibits attached to the complaint \u201care true and accurate copies of the originals.\u201d The entire affidavit was prefaced by the statement that counsel upon his \u201cown personal information and knowledge, depose and state as follows.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b607-11\">{\u00b6 10} Concerning the personal-knowledge requirement of S.Ct.Prac.R. X(4)(B), we have long held that affidavits required in original actions filed in this court must be based on personal knowledge. See, e.g., <em>State ex rel. Sekermestrovich v. Akron </em>(2001), 90 Ohio St.3d 536, 538, 740 N.E.2d 252. Even before S.Ct.Prac.R. X(4)(B) expressly required that affidavits supporting the claim be <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"402\">*402</page-number>based on the affiant\u2019s personal knowledge, we dismissed original actions that did not include affidavits with a statement to that effect. See, e.g., <em>State ex rel. Shemo v. Mayfield Hts. </em>(2001), 92 Ohio St.3d 324, 750 N.E.2d 167. Although we dismissed most of these preamendment cases without prejudice, Justice Pfeifer cautioned that future violations of S.CtPrac.R. X(4)(B) may be subject to dismissal with prejudice:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b608-4\">{\u00b6 11} \u201cHowever, I would further caution relators, as well as other prospective relators, that future violations of S.CtPrac.R. X(4)(B) may be subject to dismissal with prejudice. * * * This case should provide prospective relators with sufficient warning regarding the potential consequences of not <em>fully complying </em>with the affidavit requirement of S.Ct.Prac.R. X(4)(B). Much like an umpire giving a pitcher a warning that the next pitch aimed at a batter\u2019s head may lead to his ejection, attorneys are similarly warned here.\u201d (Emphasis sic.) Id. at 325, 750 N.E.2d 167 (Pfeifer, J., concurring).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b608-5\">{\u00b6 12} Effective August 1, 2002, S.CtPrac.R. X(4)(B) was amended to incorporate the court\u2019s construction of the previous version of the rule to specify that the affidavit required must be made on personal knowledge. 95 Ohio St.3d CXXXVI. Following this amendment, we reiterated that \u201c \u2018[w]e have routinely dismissed original actions, other than habeas corpus, that were not supported by an affidavit expressly stating that the facts in the complaint were based on the affiant\u2019s personal knowledge.\u2019 \u201d <em>State ex rel. Evans v. Blackwell, </em>111 Ohio St.3d 437, 2006-Ohio-5439, 857 N.E.2d 88, \u00b6 31, quoting <em>State ex rel. Hackworth v. Hughes, </em>97 Ohio St.3d 110, 2002-Ohio-5334, 776 N.E.2d 1050, \u00b6 24. In <em>Evans, </em>we held that an affidavit of relator\u2019s counsel did not comply with the S.CtPrac.R. X(4)(B) personal-knowledge requirement because it stated that the facts in the complaint were \u201c \u2018true and correct to the best of his knowledge.\u2019 \u201d Id. at \u00b6 32. In <em>Hackworth, </em>the affidavit of relator\u2019s attorney stated that the facts in the complaint were \u201c \u2018true and accurate to the best of her knowledge and belief.\u2019 \u201d Id. at \u00b6 24. Both <em>Evans </em>and <em>Hackworth </em>were expedited election cases.</p>\n<p id=\"b608-6\">{\u00b6 13} As respondents contend, relator\u2019s counsel\u2019s affidavit stating that the statements and claims contained in the complaint are \u201ctrue and correct\u201d based on the attorney\u2019s \u201cpersonal knowledge and information\u201d or \u201cpersonal information and knowledge\u201d does not fully comply with S.CtPrac.R. X(4)(B) because it is not clear which allegations are based on personal knowledge and which allegations are based simply on information. That is, under this affidavit language, one paragraph of relators\u2019 66-paragraph complaint could be based on personal knowledge and the remaining 65 paragraphs could be based on information. Although relators claim that the intent of the phrases \u201cpersonal information and knowledge\u201d and \u201cpersonal knowledge and information\u201d in their counsel\u2019s affidavit was to make the adjective \u201cpersonal\u201d apply to both knowledge and information, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"403\">*403</page-number>and that in applying the common usage of the terms, they are synonymous, relators\u2019 counsel could have avoided any problem with the affidavit by simply amending the affidavit to state that it was based solely on his \u201cpersonal knowledge.\u201d The fact that he did not seek leave to do so implies that he could not swear that every pertinent allegation necessary to support the mandamus claim was, in fact, based on his personal knowledge.</p>\n<p id=\"b609-5\">{\u00b6 14} Consistent with <em>Evans, Hackworth, </em>and S.Ct.Prac.R. X(4)(B), we dismiss this cause because although respondents notified relators of this defect in both their answer to relators\u2019 complaint and in their merit brief, relators failed to seek leave to amend their mandamus complaint to correct the affidavit. See, e.g., <em>Evans, </em>111 Ohio St.3d 437, 2006-Ohio-5439, 857 N.E.2d 88, \u00b6 34. We recognize that \u201cthe fundamental tenet of judicial review in Ohio is that courts should decide cases on their merits.\u201d See <em>State ex rel. Becker v. Eastlake </em>(2001), 93 Ohio St.3d 502, 505, 756 N.E.2d 1228. But because our longstanding legal construction of S.Ct.Prac.R. X(4)(B) demands dismissal, we will not create an exception to that precedent.</p>\n<p id=\"b609-6\">Cause dismissed.</p>\n<judges id=\"b609-7\">Moyer, C.J., and O\u2019Connor, O\u2019Donnell, Lanzinger, and Cupp, JJ., concur.</judges>\n<judges id=\"b609-8\">Pfeifer and Lundberg Stratton, JJ., dissent.</judges>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b609-9\">Lundberg Stratton, J.,</author>\n<p id=\"AP96\">dissenting.</p>\n<p id=\"AGT5\">{\u00b6 15} It is well established that \u201cthe fundamental tenet of judicial review in Ohio is that courts should decide cases on their merits.\u201d <em>State ex rel. Becker v. Eastlake </em>(2001), 93 Ohio St.3d 502, 505, 756 N.E.2d 1228. I believe that the affidavit in this case meets the personal-knowledge requirement in S.Ct.Prac.R. X(4)(B) and that the majority\u2019s interpretation is too technical. Consequently, I respectfully dissent from the decision to dismiss, and I would consider the case on the merits.</p>\n<p id=\"b609-11\">{\u00b6 16} This case is not like <em>State ex rel. Evans v. Blackwell, </em>111 Ohio St.3d 437, 2006-Ohio-5439, 857 N.E.2d 88, or <em>State ex rel. Hackworth v. Hughes, </em>97 Ohio St.3d 110, 2002-Ohio-5334, 776 N.E.2d 1050, in which the affiants attested, respectively, that the documents were \u201ctrue and correct to the best of his knowledge\u201d and \u201ctrue and accurate to the best of her knowledge and belief.\u201d These phrases do not reflect personal knowledge gained through firsthand observation or experience. Rather, the phrases attested to by the affiants in <em>Evans </em>and <em>Hackworth </em>merely express a belief based on what someone else said or based on secondhand information that the affiants believed to be true. For <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"404\">*404</page-number>those reasons, the affidavits did not comply with S.Ct.Prac.R. X(4)(B), and dismissal was appropriate.</p>\n<attorneys id=\"Ab0\">Phillips &amp; Co., L.P.A., and Gerald W. Phillips, for relators.</attorneys>\n<attorneys id=\"AGy\">Taft, Stettinius &amp; Hollister, L.L.P., Stephen M. O\u2019Bryan, Patrick J. Krebs, and Majeed G. Makhlouf; and The McTigue Law Group, Donald J. McTigue, and Mark A. McGinnis, for respondents.</attorneys>\n<p id=\"b610-5\">{\u00b6 17} Here, relators\u2019 counsel used the requisite phrase \u201cpersonal knowledge.\u201d I do not believe that the reference to \u201cinformation\u201d or \u201cpersonal information\u201d removes the affidavit from compliance with the personal-knowledge requirement of S.CtJPrac.R. X(4)(B). As written, the adjective \u201cpersonal\u201d applied to both the affiant\u2019s knowledge and his information. In the common usage of the terms, they are synonymous. One accepted definition of \u201cinformation\u201d is \u201cknowledge of a particular event or situation.\u201d Webster\u2019s Third New International Dictionary (1986) 1160.</p>\n<p id=\"b610-6\">{\u00b6 18} The majority places significance on the fact that relators\u2019 counsel did not seek leave to amend his affidavit. However, it is likely that counsel believed that the affidavit complied with the rule and that it was unnecessary to move to amend merely to delete the word \u201cinformation\u201d when the affidavit included the requisite phrase \u201cpersonal knowledge.\u201d The fact that the affiant included the additional, but unnecessary, word \u201cinformation\u201d should not defeat the affidavit\u2019s validity.</p>\n<p id=\"b610-7\">{\u00b6 19} The majority\u2019s interpretation is a new construction of the rule. Because relators\u2019 counsel did use the phrase \u201cpersonal knowledge\u201d in his affidavit, applying this new interpretation to dismiss the relators\u2019 complaint in this case is unfair. To avoid unfairness, I believe that the court should prospectively apply this interpretation and caution attorneys that in future cases, this language will not be held to fully comply with S.Ct.Prac.R. X(4)(B), and the case will be subject to dismissal with prejudice.</p>\n<p id=\"b610-8\">{\u00b6 20} Consequently, I respectfully dissent and would consider the case on the merits.</p>\n<judges id=\"b610-9\">Pfeifer, J., concurs in the foregoing opinion.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
