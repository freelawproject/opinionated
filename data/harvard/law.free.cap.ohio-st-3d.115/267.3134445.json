We hold that the juvenile\u2019s right to counsel is a right that he may waive, subject to certain conditions.</p>\n<p id=\"b474-12\">Relevant Background</p>\n<p id=\"b474-13\">{\u00b6 2} Appellant, C.S., was brought before the Juvenile Division of the Licking County Court of Common Pleas on August 9, 2005. At that time, he was almost 14 years old.</p>\n<p id=\"b474-14\">A. The Incidents</p>\n<p id=\"b474-15\">{\u00b6 3} C.S.\u2019s appearance in court was for purposes of two cases. The first, No. A2005-0616, charged C.S. with two counts of grand theft, felonies of the fourth degree if committed by an adult. The second, No. A2004-0329, alleged that C.S. had violated conditions of his probation, which had been imposed in an earlier, unrelated assault case.</p>\n<p id=\"b475-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"269\">*269</page-number>{\u00b6 4} The facts of the theft case are largely undisputed; C.S. and one of his friends waived their rights to an attorney and made admissions to the police. Those admissions included statements that they had stolen two cars and had used them to traverse three central Ohio counties while committing various criminal acts from August 3, 2005, through August 7, 2005. Indeed, the magistrate hearing the case initially termed the boys\u2019 activities \u201ca regular crime spree.\u201d The crime spree allegedly included the theft of the cars and the destruction of one, the repeated burglarizing of a trailer (stealing electronic equipment and a firearm from it), the procurement and use of alcohol and cocaine-laced marijuana, engaging in sexual relations with an adult woman, and cruelty to animals (shooting a cow and a horse multiple times).</p>\n<p id=\"b475-5\">B. The Hearing</p>\n<p id=\"b475-6\">{\u00b6 5} At some point prior to an initial hearing held on August 9, 2005, C.S. and his mother received the common pleas court\u2019s notice and order to appear. The document, entitled \u201cOrder to Appear and Explanation of Rights,\u201d sets forth seven pages of information.</p>\n<p id=\"b475-7\">{\u00b6 6} Included on the first page of the document is a section captioned \u201cYour Right to an Attorney.\u201d That section clearly states that \u201c[y]ou have the right to be represented by an attorney at all stages of this proceeding\u201d and that an attorney will be appointed if \u201cyou cannot afford an attorney and you qualify under State guidelines.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b475-8\">{\u00b6 7} The document further states, \u201cYou should contact the Clerk\u2019s Office seven (7) days in advance of your scheduled hearing and the Clerk will advise you how to apply for a Court-appointed attorney.\u201d Given that C.S. does not appear to have been taken into custody until August 7 or August 8 and that his hearing was held on August 9, he could not have complied with that notice provision.</p>\n<p id=\"b475-9\">{\u00b6 8} On the page that follows, after a section that sets forth \u201cYour Rights in Court,\u201d the papers contain a section entitled \u201cWaiver of Attorney.\u201d That section states, \u201cThe undersigned have read the instructions concerning our right to an attorney and the right to a Court-appointed attorney, if applicable. Knowing and understanding these rights, we hereby waive our right to be represented by an attorney or Court-appointed attorney. We further understand that we can be represented by an attorney in the future simply by advising the Court of our intention to do so.\u201d Ms. S. and C.S. signed the lines designated for \u201cparent\u201d and \u201cjuvenile\u201d in that section.</p>\n<p id=\"b475-10\">{\u00b6 9} At the hearing, the magistrate stated in open court that he had \u201ctwo sets of rights papers\u201d \u2014 an apparent reference to the notice to appear and its explanation of rights. The magistrate verified that C.S. had received the papers, read <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"270\">*270</page-number>them, and understood the rights set forth on them and that C.S. and his mother had signed the papers.</p>\n<p id=\"b476-4\">{\u00b6 10} The magistrate also inquired of C.S. and his mother as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b476-5\">{\u00b6 11} \u201cTHE COURT: Do you understand that you have the right to be represented by an attorney at today\u2019s hearing?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b476-6\">{\u00b6 12} \u201cC.S.: Yes, sir.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b476-7\">{\u00b6 13} \u201cTHE COURT: If you cannot afford an attorney and you qualify under state guidelines, I will appoint an attorney to represent you. Do you understand that?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b476-8\">{\u00b6 14} \u201cC.S.: Yes, sir.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b476-9\">{\u00b6 15} \u201cTHE COURT: Do you wish to go forward with today\u2019s hearing without an attorney?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b476-10\">{\u00b6 16} \u201cC.S.: Yes, sir.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b476-11\">{\u00b6 17} \u201cTHE COURT: Ms. S., do you agree with C.S.\u2019s decision today to go forward without an attorney?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b476-12\">{\u00b6 18} \u201cMS. S.: Yes, sir.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b476-13\">{\u00b6 19} The magistrate then explained the charges against appellant, including the degree of the offenses charged. After each offense was stated, the magistrate asked C.S. whether he understood the charge. Each time, C.S. answered that he did.</p>\n<p id=\"b476-14\">{\u00b6 20} After each affirmative response, the magistrate asked whether C.S. admitted or denied the charge. C.S. admitted every charge. The magistrate then continued:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b476-15\">{\u00b6 21} \u201cTHE COURT: If you admit these charges today, C.S., that\u2019s basically the same as pleading guilty. Do you understand that?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b476-16\">{\u00b6 22} \u201cC.S.: Yes, sir.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b476-17\">{\u00b6 23} \u201cTHE COURT: As a result then we would not have an adjudicatory hearing or trial in either of these eases. Do you understand that?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b476-18\">{\u00b6 24} \u201cC.S.: Yes, sir.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b476-19\">{\u00b6 25} \u201cTHE COURT: Instead we would proceed directly to disposition, that is, for me to decide what punishment or conditions if any that should be imposed upon you. Do you understand that?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b476-20\">{\u00b6 26} \u201cC.S.: Yes, sir.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b476-21\">{\u00b6 27} \u201cTHE COURT: By entering that plea you will be \u2014 well, first of all, that disposition in your case in A2005-0616 could include a commitment to the custody of the Ohio Department of Youth Services for a minimum period of six months or <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"271\">*271</page-number>twelve months and a maximum period not to exceed age twenty-one. Do you understand that?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b477-4\">{\u00b6 28} \u201cC.S.: Yes, sir.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b477-5\">{\u00b6 29} \u201cTHE COURT: Do you understand what the Ohio Department of Youth Services is?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b477-6\">{\u00b6 30} \u201cC.S.: Yes, sir.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b477-7\">{\u00b6 31} \u201cTHE COURT: What is it?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b477-8\">{\u00b6 32} \u201cC.S.: Juvenile prison, sir.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b477-9\">{\u00b6 33} \u201cTHE COURT: That\u2019s correct. By entering that plea of admit you will be waiving or giving up certain Constitutionally guaranteed rights that you would otherwise enjoy. Among the rights that you will be giving up is the right to remain silent. Do you understand that?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b477-10\">{\u00b6 34} \u201cC.S.: Yes, sir.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b477-11\">{\u00b6 35} \u201cTHE COURT: You will also be giving up the right to call witnesses and to present evidence in your defense. Do you understand that?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b477-12\">{\u00b6 36} \u201cC.S.: Yes, sir.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b477-13\">{\u00b6 37} \u201cTHE COURT: And you\u2019ll be giving up the right to question and to cross-examine prosecution witnesses. Do you understand that?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b477-14\">{\u00b6 38} \u201cC.S.: Yes, sir.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b477-15\">{\u00b6 39} \u201cTHE COURT: Ordinarily, C.S., the State of Ohio would be required to prove these cases against you beyond a reasonable doubt. If you enter a plea of admit, however, the State of Ohio will not have to prove anything at all. Do you understand that?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b477-16\">{\u00b6 40} \u201cC.S.: Yes, sir.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b477-17\">{\u00b6 41} \u201cTHE COURT: Have there been any promises or threats of any sort to cause you to enter these pleas?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b477-18\">{\u00b6 42} \u201cC.S.: No, sir.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b477-19\">{\u00b6 43} \u201cTHE COURT: Ms. S., do you agree with C.S.\u2019s decision today to enter pleas of admission to these charges?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b477-20\">{\u00b6 44} \u201cMS. S.: Yes, sir.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b477-21\">{\u00b6 45} \u201cTHE COURT: Then, C.S., I\u2019ll accept the pleas of admission. Is there any statement about this situation that you wish to make?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b477-22\">{\u00b6 46} \u201cC.S.: No, sir.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b477-23\">{\u00b6 47} \u201cTHE COURT: Have you talked with your mother since you got arrested?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b477-24\">{\u00b6 48} \u201cC.S.: No, sir.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b478-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"272\">*272</page-number>{\u00b6 49} \u201cTHE COURT: Ms. S., did you have an opportunity to read the police report?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b478-5\">{\u00b6 50} \u201cMS. S.: No, sir.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b478-6\">{\u00b6 51} \u201cTHE COURT: I think it\u2019s safe to say, Ms. S. and C.S. * * * \u2014 it\u2019s safe to assume that there will be more * * * felony charges coming. I \u2014 I don\u2019t know when. It\u2019ll \u2014 it\u2019s going to be in the jurisdiction of Perry County. They\u2019ll transfer those cases up here so we\u2019ll deal with them, but in terms of the filing the complaints, it\u2019ll be the Perry County Prosecutor that has to file those complaints. But we\u2019ll cross that bridge when we come to it. I just wanted you to know that because of the burglaries, the firearm thefts, the discharging of the firearm, animal cruelty, underage consumption, drug \u2014 felony drug possession charges\u2014 what else? What am I missing? That\u2019s probably it. Underage alcohol, possession of marijuana, possession of cocaine, burglary, animal cruelty, theft of a firearm. That pretty much covers it, doesn\u2019t it?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b478-7\">{\u00b6 52} \u201cC.S.: Yes sir. B and E, sir.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b478-8\">{\u00b6 53} \u201cTHE COURT: And the B and E. Well, burglary. It\u2019ll be a burglary because it\u2019s a home. Did you do \u2014 oh, well, the trailer, was it \u2014 someone living in that trailer too?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b478-9\">{\u00b6 54} \u201cC.S.: It \u2014 it was a camper, sir.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b478-10\">{\u00b6 55} \u201cTHE COURT: Okay. So that\u2019d probably be a B and E so you\u2019d get a B and E and a burglary. So all together, once those all get filed, you\u2019re probably looking at another three years on top of that once you add all those together. So that \u2014 that\u2019ll be coming at some time, Ms. S. A regular crime spree. Steals two cars. Basically totals them both. Shoots a cow. Shoots a horse. Steals a gun. Breaks into a house. Smokes dope. Has sex with an adult woman. Alcohol. Cocaine. Hope it was worth it. Ms. S., is there anything that you wish to say?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b478-11\">{\u00b6 56} \u201cMS. S.: No, sir.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b478-12\">{\u00b6 57} \u201cTHE COURT: Do you know what I think, C.S., is the biggest injustice in this whole situation? Do you know?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b478-13\">{\u00b6 58} \u201cC.S.: No, sir.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b478-14\">{\u00b6 59} \u201cTHE COURT: Well, I\u2019ll tell you what I think is the biggest injustice in the whole situation. The biggest injustice * * * is that I can only give you a year in prison. Based on what you\u2019ve done over the past week, you ought to stay in prison until you\u2019re twenty-one years of age in my opinion, but I can\u2019t do that. To me, that\u2019s wrong. That\u2019s a disservice to every other taxpaying, law-abiding citizen of the state of Ohio that I can\u2019t lock you up [until you turn] twenty-one based on what you\u2019ve been doing for the past week. The biggest injustice in this case is that I can only give you a year in prison. * * * [T]he way this commitment works is I\u2019m going to commit you to [DYS] today for a minimum of a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"273\">*273</page-number>year. Okay. But at the end of that year, however, that doesn\u2019t mean you automatically get out. The end of that year means simply that your case goes before the review authority to decide whether or not you should get out on parole. They don\u2019t have to let you out. So based on the nature of the offense, based on the opinion of our probation director * * * and based on your conduct in [DYS], it\u2019s entirely possible that you will do more than a year. But the only thing that I can guarantee that you\u2019ll do is a year. * * * So you\u2019re lboking at another two and a half years on top of that once those charges are filed by Perry County. C.S., based upon your pleas of admission and the facts contained in the report in A2004-0329, I\u2019ll adjudicate you a probation violator as alleged in the motion. I\u2019ll order that you be released unsuccessfully in that \u2014 in that and all other cases. I\u2019ll order that you be released from probation unsuccessfully in all cases. Do you understand that?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b479-6\">{\u00b6 60} \u201cC.S.: Yes, sir.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b479-7\">{\u00b6 61} \u201cTHE COURT: In A2005-0616, based upon your pleas of admission and the facts contained in the report, I\u2019ll adjudicate you delinquent on both counts. * * * On both counts, I\u2019ll order you committed to the custody of the Ohio Department of Youth Services for a minimum period of six months and a maximum period not to exceed your twenty-first birthday. I\u2019ll order that those two counts run consecutive to each other for an initial minimum commitment of twelve months. And * * * the Department of Youth Services is to ensure that [C.S.\u2019s older brother] and C.S. are not in the same facility. I know that was your plan. Your plan was that they be in \u2014 you were \u2014 you were anxious to be arrested on these felonies so that you could go to [DYS] and be with your brother again. You\u2019re going to [DYS] but I\u2019ll ensure you\u2019re not in the same facility.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b479-8\">{\u00b6 62} C.S. and his mother were informed of their right to object to the magistrate\u2019s decision, see Juv.R. 40, and acknowledged receipt of the magistrate\u2019s decision. They waived objections and consented to the magistrate\u2019s decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b479-9\">{\u00b6 63} After the trial court accepted the magistrate\u2019s decision, C.S. appealed on various grounds. One of those claims is pertinent here. C.S. argued that the trial court violated his rights to counsel and due process as those rights are conferred by the Fifth, Sixth, and Fourteenth Amendments to the United States Constitution, Sections 10 and 16, Article I of the Ohio Constitution, R.C. 2151.32, and Juv.R. 4 and 29.</p>\n<p id=\"b479-10\">{\u00b6 64} After the court of appeals rejected that claim of error, we accepted C.S.\u2019s discretionary appeal, <em>In re C.S., </em>111 Ohio St.3d 1409, 2006-Ohio-5083, 854 N.E.2d 1090, to address two propositions of law. First, we address the meaning and effect of the portion of R.C. 2151.352 that states, \u201cCounsel must be provided for a child not represented by the child\u2019s parent, guardian, or custodian,\u201d whether the right to counsel conferred on a juvenile can be waived, and, if so, what <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"274\">*274</page-number>constitutes a valid waiver. Second, we decided whether strict compliance with Juv.R. 29 is required or whether substantial compliance is sufficient.</p>\n<p id=\"b480-4\">Analysis</p>\n<p id=\"b480-5\">{\u00b6 65} Our analysis here must be placed in the context of the juvenile courts, which occupy a unique place in our legal system.</p>\n<p id=\"b480-6\">{\u00b6 66} Juvenile courts are legislative creations, see <em>In re Agler </em>(1969), 19 Ohio St.2d 70, 72, 48 O.O.2d 85, 249 N.E.2d 808, \u201crooted in social welfare philosophy rather than in the <em>corpus juris,\u201d Kent v. United States </em>(1966), 383 U.S. 541, 554, 86 S.Ct. 1045, 16 L.Ed.2d 84. The juvenile courts were premised on profoundly different assumptions and goals than a criminal court, <em>United States v. Johnson </em>(C.A.D.C.1994), 28 F.3d 151, 157 (Wald, J., dissenting), and eschewed traditional, objective criminal standards and retributive notions of justice. Instead, a new civil adjudication scheme arose, with a focus on the state\u2019s role as parens patriae and the vision that the courts would protect the wayward child from \u201cevil influences,\u201d \u201csave\u201d him from criminal prosecution, and provide him social and rehabilitative services. <em>In re T.R. </em>(1990), 52 Ohio St.3d 6, 15, 556 N.E.2d 439; <em>Children\u2019s Home of Marion Cty. v. Fetter </em>(1914), 90 Ohio St. 110, 127, 106 N.E. 761; <em>Ex parte Januszewski </em>(C.C.Ohio 1911), 196 F. 123, 127.</p>\n<p id=\"b480-7\">{\u00b6 67} Not surprisingly then, the juvenile courts adopted proceedings that were less formal and more inquisitorial than adversarial, <em>In re T.R., </em>52 Ohio St.3d at 15, 556 N.E .2d 439, and a new lexicon that denoted differences between the two court systems, cf. <em>State v. Hanning </em>(2000), 89 Ohio St.3d 86, 89, 728 N.E.2d 1059 (noting that \u201cdelinquency\u201d does not equate to \u201ccriminal\u201d and that \u201crespondents\u201d are not \u201cdefendants\u201d). As one Ohio court explained, \u201cDelinquency has not been declared a crime in Ohio, and the Ohio juvenile act is neither criminal nor penal in its nature, but is an administrative police regulation of a corrective character; and while the commission of the crime may set the machinery of the juvenile court in motion[,] the accused was not tried in that court for his crime but for incorrigibility.\u201d <em>State v. Joiner </em>(C.P.1917), 28 Ohio Dec. 199, 20 Ohio N.P.(N.S.) 313, 319, 1917 WL 1173, *2, citing <em>Ex parte Januszewski, </em>196 F. at 127-128.</p>\n<p id=\"b480-8\">{\u00b6 68} Considered \u201ca monument to the enlightened conviction that wayward boys may become good men,\u201d <em>In re Agler </em>(1969), 19 Ohio St.2d 70, 71, 48 O.O.2d 85, 249 N.E.2d 808, juvenile courts were lauded as \u201c \u2018one of the most significant advances in the administration of justice since the Magna Carta.\u2019 \u201d <em>Cox v. Turley </em>(C.A.6, 1974), 506 F.2d 1347, 1354, quoting Roscoe Pound, Guide for Juvenile Court Judges (1957) 127. They were widely left to operate without legal oversight for the first half of the 20th century. See, e.g., Mark R. Fondacaro, Christopher Sloggin, and Traci Cross, Reconceptualizing Due Process in Juvenile Justice: Contributions from Law and Social Science (2006), 57 Hastings L.J. 955, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"275\">*275</page-number>956. But with time, much of the beneficence that underlay the genesis of juvenile courts eroded. And with that erosion came increased constitutional oversight.</p>\n<p id=\"b481-6\">{\u00b6 69} By midcentury, it was clear that the juvenile courts not only had the authority to impose significant penalties but that they frequently did so. Amid increasing disaffection with juvenile courts and some of their judges during the 1960s and 1970s, see, e.g., <em>McKeiver v. Pennsylvania </em>(1971), 403 U.S. 528, 534, 543-544, 91 S.Ct. 1976, 29 L.Ed.2d 647 (plurality opinion), came increasing recognition of due process rights and constitutional scrutiny of police action.</p>\n<p id=\"b481-7\">{\u00b6 70} By that era, the Supreme Court recognized that a juvenile could \u201creceive[] the worst of both worlds\u201d in the juvenile court system by being provided \u201cneither the protections accorded to adults nor the solicitous care and regenerative treatment postulated for children.\u201d <em>Kent, </em>383 U.S. at 556, 86 S.Ct. 1045, 16 L.Ed.2d 84. In a series of cases, the court addressed that concern.</p>\n<p id=\"b481-8\">{\u00b6 71} Although the court had recognized a due process interest in juvenile court proceedings as early as 1948, see <em>Haley v. Ohio </em>(1948), 332 U.S. 596, 601, 68 S.Ct. 302, 92 L.Ed. 224, the understanding that the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment applied to juvenile proceedings because of the juvenile\u2019s liberty interests was more fully developed in <em>Kent </em>(recognizing that \u201cthe admonition to function in a \u2018parental\u2019 relationship is not an invitation to procedural arbitrariness\u201d and holding that a juvenile is entitled to a hearing on the issue of whether juvenile court jurisdiction should be waived before being released to a criminal court for prosecution), and crystallized in <em>In re Gault </em>(1967), 387 U.S. 1, 87 S.Ct. 1428, 18 L.Ed.2d 527.</p>\n<p id=\"b481-9\">{\u00b6 72} <em>Gault </em>approvingly quoted the report of the President\u2019s Commission on Law Enforcement and Administration of Justice, The Challenge of Crime in a Free Society (1967) 86-86, which recommended that counsel be appointed to juveniles \u201c \u2018as a matter of course\u2019 \u201d and observed that \u201c \u2018[t]he most informal and well-intentioned of judicial proceedings are technical; few adults without legal training can influence or even understand them.\u2019 \u201d 387 U.S. at 38-39, 87 S.Ct. 1428, 18 L.Ed.2d 527, fn. 65. The court held that a juvenile and his parents must be informed of certain rights, including the juvenile\u2019s right to be represented by counsel and to have counsel appointed if his family cannot afford an attorney, the right not to be forced to incriminate himself, the right to written notice of the specific charges against him, and the right to confront and cross-examine witnesses. Id. at 31-56, 87 S.Ct. 1428, 18 L.Ed.2d 527. Soon thereafter, the court also recognized that the Due Process Clause required the state to prove beyond a reasonable doubt the charges against a juvenile. <em>In re Winship </em>(1970), 397 U.S. 358, 367-368, 90 S.Ct. 1068, 25 L.Ed.2d 368.</p>\n<p id=\"b481-10\">{\u00b6 73} In the wake of <em>Gault </em>and its progeny, we also found that \u201cnumerous constitutional safeguards normally reserved for criminal prosecutions are equally <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"276\">*276</page-number>applicable to juvenile delinquency proceedings,\u201d <em>State v. Walls, </em>96 Ohio St.3d 437, 2002-Ohio-5059, 775 N.E.2d 829, \u00b6 26, and overruled prior decisions that held to the contrary, see <em>In re Agler, </em>19 Ohio St.2d at 76, 48 O.O.2d 85, 249 N.E.2d 808.</p>\n<p id=\"b482-4\">{\u00b6 74} As a result of those cases, juveniles secured more of the rights afforded to adults, and juvenile court proceedings became more formal. <em>Hanning, </em>89 Ohio St.3d at 89, 728 N.E.2d 1059. Although some suggest that those changes, and the revisions to the juvenile delinquency laws themselves, indicate a criminalization of juvenile law, see, e.g., <em>In re Anderson </em>(2001), 92 Ohio St.3d 63, 66, 748 N.E.2d 67, fn. 2, we have found, see, e.g., <em>Hanning, </em>89 Ohio St.3d at 89-90, 728 N.E.2d 1059, that the General Assembly has adhered to the core tenets of the juvenile system even as it has made substantive changes to the Juvenile Code in a get-tough response to increasing juvenile caseloads, recidivism, and the realization that the harms suffered by victims are not dependent upon the age of the perpetrator. <em>Schall v. Martin </em>(1984), 467 U.S. 253, 264-265, 104 S.Ct. 2403, 81 L.Ed.2d 207; <em>Breed v. Jones </em>(1975), 421 U.S. 519, 536, 95 S.Ct. 1779, 44 L.Ed.2d 346.</p>\n<p id=\"b482-5\">{\u00b6 75} Despite the inherent tension in the juvenile court system between the goals of juvenile rehabilitation and protection of society, the Supreme Court has suggested that the system should remain. \u201c[0]ur decisions in recent years have recognized that there is a gap between the originally benign conception of the system and its realities. * * * That the system has fallen short of the high expectations of its sponsors [however] in no way detracts from the broad social benefits sought or from those benefits that can survive constitutional scrutiny.\u201d <em>Breed, </em>421 U.S. at 528-529, 95 S.Ct. 1779, 44 L.Ed.2d 346. Contemporary juvenile courts thus remain \u201c \u2018an uneasy partnership of law and social work.\u2019 \u201d <em>In re Agler, </em>19 Ohio St.2d at 73, 48 O.O.2d 85, 249 N.E.2d 808, quoting Whitlatch, The Juvenile Court (1967), 18 W.Res.L.Rev. 1239, 1244-1245. We, too, abide by the principles that underlie the founding of the juvenile courts, but we do so with pragmatism and an understanding of modern realities.</p>\n<p id=\"b482-6\">{\u00b6 76} For example, although we often characterize juvenile proceedings as civil rather than criminal, <em>Cope v. Campbell </em>(1964), 175 Ohio St. 475, 26 O.O.2d 88, 196 N.E.2d 457, paragraph one of the syllabus; <em>State v. Walls, </em>96 Ohio St.3d 437, 2002-Ohio-5059, 775 N.E.2d 829, \u00b6 25, we recognize that \u201c[w]hatever their label, juvenile delinquency laws feature inherently criminal aspects that we cannot ignore,\u201d id. at \u00b6 26, citing <em>Anderson, </em>92 Ohio St.3d at 65-66, 748 N.E.2d 67. See also <em>In re Gault, </em>387 U.S. at 23-25 and 50, 87 S.Ct. 1428, 18 L.Ed.2d 527 (noting the term \u201cdelinquent\u201d offers only slightly less stigma than the term \u201ccriminal\u201d and that a \u201ccommitment\u201d is an incarceration regardless of what it is labeled); <em>In re Winship, </em>397 U.S. at 365-366, 90 S.Ct. 1068, 25 L.Ed.2d 368 (\u201ccivil labels and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"277\">*277</page-number>good intentions do not themselves obviate the need for criminal due process safeguards in juvenile courts\u201d). \u201c[Jjuvenile delinquency laws feature inherently criminal aspects,\u201d and the state\u2019s goals in prosecuting a criminal action and in adjudicating a juvenile delinquency case are the same: \u201cto vindicate a vital interest in the enforcement of <em>criminal </em>laws.\u201d (Emphasis sic.) <em>Walls, </em>96 Ohio St.3d 437, 2002-Ohio-5059, 775 N.E.2d 829, \u00b6 26.</p>\n<p id=\"b483-5\">{\u00b6 77} Given the state\u2019s valid interests in enforcing its criminal laws against juveniles and, in at least some cases, in requesting that the juvenile court impose significant penalties in their dispositions, we must also remain cognizant of the nature of the juvenile\u2019s right to representation by counsel.</p>\n<p id=\"b483-6\">{\u00b6 78} In declaring that the juvenile facing commitment to an institution has a right to counsel \u201c \u2018at every step in the proceedings against him,\u2019 \u201d <em>In re Gault, </em>387 U.S. at 36, 87 S.Ct. 1428, 18 L.Ed.2d 527, quoting <em>Powell v. Alabama </em>(1932), 287 U.S. 45, 69, 53 S.Ct. 55, 77 L.Ed. 158, the Supreme Court reinforced its belief that the appointment of counsel for a juvenile is not a mere formality or \u201ca grudging gesture to a ritualistic requirement\u201d; it is a venerable right at the core of the administration of justice and due process. <em>Kent, </em>383 U.S. at 561, 86 S.Ct. 1045, 16 L.Ed.2d 84.</p>\n<p id=\"b483-7\">{\u00b6 79} Indeed, it was the understanding of the right to due process that drove the court\u2019s holdings in <em>Kent, Gault, </em>and <em>Winship. </em>Those cases make clear that the right to counsel in a juvenile case flows to the juvenile through the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment, not the Sixth Amendment. <em>Gault, </em>387 U.S. at 41, 87 S.Ct. 1428, 18 L.Ed.2d 527. And although modern juvenile proceedings share some indicia of the criminal courts, juvenile proceedings are not considered criminal prosecutions for purposes of Sixth Amendment analyses. <em>McKeiver, </em>403 U.S. at 553, 91 S.Ct. 1976, 29 L.Ed.2d 647.</p>\n<p id=\"b483-8\">{\u00b6 80} Because the juvenile\u2019s right to counsel is predicated on due process, it is malleable rather than rigid. As the Supreme Court has explained, \u201cFor all its consequence, \u2018due process\u2019 has never been, and perhaps can never be, precisely defined. * * * [D]ue process \u2018is not a technical conception with a fixed content unrelated to time, place and circumstances.\u2019 <em>Cafeteria [&amp; Restaurant </em>] <em>Workers [Union] v. McElroy </em>[1961], 367 U.S. 886, 895 [81 S.Ct. 1743, 6 L.Ed.2d 1230]. Rather, the phrase expresses the requirement of \u2018fundamental fairness,\u2019 a requirement whose meaning can be as opaque as its importance is lofty. Applying the Due Process Clause is therefore an uncertain enterprise which must discover what \u2018fundamental fairness\u2019 consists of in a particular situation by first considering any relevant precedents and then by assessing the several interests that are at stake.\u201d <em>Lassiter v. Dept. of Social Servs. of Durham Cty., North Carolina </em>(1981), 452 U.S. 18, 24-25, 101 S.Ct. 2153, 68 L.Ed.2d 640.</p>\n<p id=\"b484-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"278\">*278</page-number>{\u00b6 81} The flexibility of due process lies in its scope after it has been determined that some process is due, and due process doctrine recognizes that \u201cnot all situations calling for procedural safeguards call for the same kind of procedure.\u201d <em>Morrissey v. Brewer </em>(1972), 408 U.S. 471, 481, 92 S.Ct. 2593, 33 L.Ed.2d 484. A court\u2019s task is to ascertain what process is due in a given case, <em>McKeiver, </em>403 U.S. at 541, 91 S.Ct. 1976, 29 L.Ed.2d 647, while being true to the core concept of due process in a juvenile case \u2014 to ensure orderliness and fairness. We proceed in our analysis with that understanding at the fore.</p>\n<p id=\"b484-5\">{\u00b6 82} The fact that the right to counsel in a juvenile case arises from due process does not diminish its importance. A juvenile typically lacks sufficient maturity and good judgment to make good decisions consistently and sufficiently foresee the consequences of his actions. See, e.g., <em>Roper v. Simmons </em>(2005), 543 U.S. 551, 569-570, 125 S.Ct. 1183, 161 L.Ed.2d 1; <em>Planned Parenthood of Cent. Missouri v. Danforth </em>(1976), 428 U.S. 52, 102, 96 S.Ct. 2831, 49 L.Ed.2d 788 (Stevens, J., concurring in part and dissenting in part). Thus, \u201c[t]he juvenile needs the assistance of counsel to cope with problems of law, to make skilled inquiry into the facts, to insist upon regularity of the proceedings and to ascertain whether he has a defense and to prepare and submit it.\u201d (Footnote omitted.) <em>Gault, </em>387 U.S. at 36, 87 S.Ct. 1428, 18 L.Ed.2d 527.</p>\n<p id=\"b484-6\">{\u00b6 83} Given the importance of counsel in juvenile proceedings, the General Assembly codified a juvenile\u2019s constitutional right to appointed counsel in the wake of <em>Gault. </em>Indeed, through R.C. 2151.352, the legislature provided a statutory right to appointed counsel that goes beyond constitutional requirements. <em>In re Williams, </em>101 Ohio St.3d 398, 2004-Ohio-1500, 805 N.E.2d 1110, \u00b6 15, citing <em>State ex rel. Asberry v. Payne </em>(1998), 82 Ohio St.3d 44, 46, 693 N.E.2d 794.</p>\n<p id=\"b484-7\">{\u00b6 84} Former R.C. 2151.352 provided that a child \u201cis entitled to representation by legal counsel at all stages of the proceedings * * * and if, as an indigent person, any such person is unable to employ counsel, to have counsel provided for the person.\u201d The statute mandated that \u201c[i]f a party appears without counsel, the court shall ascertain whether the party knows of the party\u2019s right to counsel and of the party\u2019s right to be provided with counsel if the party is an indigent person.\u201d The statute further provides, \u201cCounsel must be provided for a child not represented by the child\u2019s parent, guardian, or custodian. If the interests of two or more such parties conflict, separate counsel shall be provided for each of them.\u201d Am.Sub.S.B. No. 179, 148 Ohio Laws, Part IV, 9519, effective January 1, 2002. (The current version is substantively similar; the last three quoted sentences are exactly the same.)</p>\n<p id=\"b484-8\">{\u00b6 85} We have also incorporated constitutional safeguards in our rules of procedure. According to Juv.R. 4(A), \u201c[e]very party shall have the right to be <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"279\">*279</page-number>represented by counsel and every child * * * the right to appointed counsel if indigent.\u201d Similarly, Juv.R. 29(B) mandates that \u201c[a]t the beginning of the hearing,\u201d the court inform unrepresented parties of their rights to counsel. Juv.R. 29(B)(3). The rules also recognize that, like an adult, a juvenile may waive his right to counsel. Juv.R. 3; Juv.R. 29(B)(3) and (4). This case directly implicates R.C. 2151.352\u2019s requirement that \u201c[cjounsel must be provided for a child not represented by the child\u2019s parent\u201d and those requirements that arise from the application of Juv.R. 29(D) to that right.</p>\n<p id=\"b485-5\">{\u00b6 86} C.S. avers that the fifth sentence of R.C. 2151.352 (the fourth of former R.C. 21512.352) \u2014 -which states that \u201c[cjounsel must be provided for a child not represented by the child\u2019s parent, guardian, or custodian\u201d \u2014 offends his constitutional right to counsel. The crux of C.S.\u2019s claim is that the statute implicitly, and improperly, permits a child\u2019s parent (or guardian or custodian) to substitute for an attorney in juvenile court proceedings. He argues that the juvenile\u2019s right to counsel \u201cas provided by the Sixth Amendment to the United States Constitution and Section Ten, Article One of the Ohio Constitution is fundamental\u201d and cannot be satisfied by any \u201crepresentation\u201d by the child\u2019s parent. He also contends that the statute cannot be construed as creating a nonwaiveable right to counsel and that the fifth sentence must therefore be severed from the statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b485-6\">{\u00b6 87} C.S.\u2019s theory of the statute\u2019s unconstitutionality entails a binary analysis. The first prong of his contention is that the statute requires that counsel <em>must </em>be appointed for the juvenile and that the right cannot be waived if the child is not represented by a parent, guardian, or custodian. The second prong of the attack asserts that the statute therefore conflicts with Juv.R. 3, which provides that the \u201crights of a child * * * may be waived.\u201d He argues that this perceived conflict \u2014 between a right that cannot be waived per R.C. 2151.352 and a right that can be waived per Juv.R. 3 \u2014 has led to divergent results in the courts, some of which have found that a parent, custodian, or guardian, rather than an attorney, can represent the juvenile.</p>\n<p id=\"b485-7\">{\u00b6 88} In reading the statute, we must consider the definition of \u201crepresent,\u201d giving effect to the usual, normal, and customary meaning of the word, R.C. 1.42, and being faithful to the language of and legislative intent behind the statute, <em>State v. S.R. </em>(1992), 63 Ohio St.3d 590, 594, 589 N.E.2d 1319.</p>\n<p id=\"b485-8\">{\u00b6 89} Taken alone, the ordinary use of the word \u201crepresent\u201d does not necessarily shed light on its intended meaning in this context. At the time the statute was enacted, as now, the word \u201crepresent\u201d had myriad meanings: \u201c[t]o act for,\u201d \u201c[t]o stand in the place of,\u201d Ballantine\u2019s Law Dictionary (3d Ed.1969) 1095, or \u201cto exhibit; to expose before the eyes,\u201d or \u201cto stand in his place; to supply his place; to act as his substitute,\u201d Black\u2019s Law Dictionary (4th Ed.1968) <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"280\">*280</page-number>1465. We believe, however, that the legislature\u2019s use of the word is clearer when taken in its constitutional context.</p>\n<p id=\"b486-5\">{\u00b6 90} As C.S. acknowledges in his brief, \u201cthe General Assembly\u2019s intent in enacting [the fifth sentence of the statute] was to protect the parties\u2019 due process rights in juvenile court in accordance with the then-recently issued decision, <em>In re Gault </em>[1967], 387 U.S. 1, 87 S.Ct. 1428, 18 L.Ed.2d 527.\u201d Clearly, the General Assembly\u2019s general intent in enacting R.C. 2151.352 was to ensure the juvenile\u2019s constitutional right to representation by an attorney \u2014 not representation by a parent, custodian, or guardian.</p>\n<p id=\"b486-6\">{\u00b6 91} In enacting this statute, we presume, the General Assembly was mindful of the common law. Cf. <em>Meyer v. Holley </em>(2003), 537 U.S. 280, 285, 123 S.Ct. 824, 154 L.Ed.2d 753. Because the common law does not permit parents to appear pro se on behalf of their minor children in civil cases,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> see, e.g., <em>Shepherd v. Wellman </em>(C.A.6, 2002), 313 F.3d 963, 970-971, a fortiori, the common law would <em>not </em>permit parents to act pro se on behalf of their children in a delinquency case.</p>\n<p id=\"b486-7\">{\u00b6 92} Moreover, at the time it enacted R.C. 2151.352, the Ohio legislature was well aware that this court has the exclusive authority to regulate, control, and define the practice of law, including prohibitions on lay representation, see <em>In re Unauthorized Practice of Law in Cuyahoga Cty. </em>(1963), 175 Ohio St. 149, 151, 23 O.O.2d 445, 192 N.E.2d 54, that we had held that \u201cno one, other than an attorney, may appear in court as a representative of another, whether or not such representative is to receive a fee for his services,\u201d id., and that we had defined the practice of law as including representation before a court, as well as other tasks, including \u201call advice to clients and all actions taken for them in matters connected with the law,\u201d <em>Land Title Abstract &amp; Trust Co. v. Dworken </em>(1934), 129 Ohio St. 23, 1 O.O. 313, 193 N.E. 650, at paragraph one of the syllabus. We did not then, and we do not now, countenance a parent who is not an attorney representing a child in court in the capacity of counsel.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b487-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"281\">*281</page-number>{\u00b6 93} Indeed, \u201c[i]t has long been recognized that the right to counsel is the right to the effective assistance of counsel.\u201d <em>McMann v. Richardson </em>(1970), 397 U.S. 759, 771, 90 S.Ct. 1441, 25 L.Ed.2d 763, fn. 4. Most parents are not attorneys and will not be able to provide effective counsel because they are not trained in the law. See <em>Gault, </em>supra; <em>Johnson v. Zerbst </em>(1938), 304 U.S. 458, 462-463, 58 S.Ct. 1019, 82 L.Ed. 1461; <em>Powell v. Alabama </em>(1932), 287 U.S. 45, 68-69, 53 S.Ct. 55, 77 L.Ed. 158; <em>In re Manuel R. </em>(1988), 207 Conn. 725, 739, 543 A.2d 719. Because even the best-intentioned parents will lack the skill and familiarity with law and procedure to adequately represent their children in delinquency proceedings, they may not do so.</p>\n<p id=\"b487-6\">{\u00b6 94} But that conclusion does not mean that we do not recognize the important role that a parent plays in the juvenile court process. In <em>Gault, </em>the court quoted a portion of the President\u2019s Crime Commission\u2019s Report: \u201c \u2018The presence of an independent legal representative of the child, <em>or of his parent, </em>is the keystone of the whole structure of guarantees that a minimum system of procedural justice requires.\u2019 \u201d (Emphasis added.) 387 U.S. at 39, 87 S.Ct. 1428, 18 L.Ed.2d 527, fn. 65. The General Assembly was also aware of the Supreme Court\u2019s recognition of the importance of parental involvement in delinquency cases.</p>\n<p id=\"b487-7\">{\u00b6 95} We believe that the fifth sentence of the statute reflects the General Assembly\u2019s understanding that <em>Gault </em>held that the juvenile may waive his rights, including his right to counsel, see <em>Gault, </em>387 U.S. at 41-42, 87 S.Ct. 1428, 18 L.Ed.2d 527, and that it codifies that right of waiver but only if the juvenile is advised by a parent in considering waiver. The Second District\u2019s assessment of the statute in <em>In re R.B., </em>166 Ohio App.3d 626, 2006-Ohio-264, 852 N.E.2d 1219, is similar.</p>\n<p id=\"b487-8\">{\u00b6 96} There, the court of appeals found that the provision meant that \u201c[i]f a child appears before the court who is not represented by the child\u2019s parent, guardian, or custodian, then the trial court \u2018must\u2019 provide counsel. Only if the child has some adult to advise him may the child knowingly and voluntarily waive his right to counsel. That construction of the statute serves an apparent purpose of assuring that a child\u2019s waiver of the right to counsel is knowing and voluntary, and it reconciles the quoted provisions, giving meaning to each.\u201d Id. at \u00b6 25. The Second District\u2019s approach is consistent with the holdings of other states\u2019 appellate courts in cases interpreting similar statutory language. <em>In re D.S. </em>(N.D.1978), 263 N.W.2d 114, 120 (\u201cWe conclude * * * that [statutory language stating that \u2018[cjounsel must be provided for a child not represented by his parent, guardian, or custodian\u2019] imposes a mandatory duty to provide counsel for a child at all stages of the proceedings under the Uniform Juvenile Court Act providing the child is not represented by his parent, guardian, or custodian [and that] this <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"282\">*282</page-number>right to counsel cannot be waived by a child who is not represented by his parent, guardian, or custodian\u201d); <em>A.C.G. v. State </em>(1974), 131 Ga.App. 156, 205 S.E.2d 435 (\u201cThe [juvenile\u2019s] right to counsel may be waived, however, unless the child is \u2018not represented by his parent, guardian, or custodian\u2019 \u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b488-4\">{\u00b6 97} We are also persuaded by the reasoning of the Supreme Court of Connecticut in its rejection of the notion of nonwaiver. As that court noted, \u201ca per se rule of nonwaivability might actually frustrate a principal goal of juvenile law of encouraging children to accept responsibility for their transgressions and take an active role in their rehabilitation. * * * Without minimizing the significance of this inevitable tension [between the juvenile courts\u2019 roles of protecting society and nurturing and rehabilitating juveniles], we are persuaded that allowing a child to make an informed and deliberate choice about legal representation, if properly supervised by the trial court, can advance both the goal of control and that of treatment. * * * To mandate the presence of counsel * * * might serve to reduce the child\u2019s own sense of involvement and might enhance his perception of his own role as merely that of spectator. * * * [W]e believe that the waiver of counsel decision, <em>in itself, </em>can be a significant rehabilitative moment for the child.\u201d (Emphasis sic.) <em>In re Manuel R. </em>(1988), 207 Conn. 725, 734-736, 543 A.2d 719.</p>\n<p id=\"b488-5\">{\u00b6 98} We hold that the word \u201crepresent\u201d in the fifth sentence of R.C. 2151.352 means to counsel or advise the juvenile in a delinquency proceeding. We further hold that in a delinquency proceeding, a juvenile may waive his constitutional right to counsel, subject to certain standards articulated below, if he is counseled and advised by his parent, custodian, or guardian. If the juvenile is not counseled by his parent, guardian, or custodian and has not consulted with an attorney, he may not waive his right to counsel.</p>\n<p id=\"b488-6\">{\u00b6 99} In a delinquency case, a judge, acting as parens patriae, has the inherent authority to appoint counsel for the juvenile to determine whether he should waive his rights. We decline, however, to require a judge to do so in each case.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b488-7\">{\u00b6 100} In light of the sixth sentence of R.C. 2151.352, we hold that a judge must appoint counsel for a juvenile if there is a conflict between the juvenile and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"283\">*283</page-number>his parent, custodian, or guardian on the question of whether counsel should be waived. Accord <em>United States v. M.I.M. </em>(C.A.1, 1991), 932 F.2d 1016, 1018-1019. In so doing, we recognize that no case in Ohio has held that a parent can waive the constitutional right of a juvenile in a delinquency proceeding, see <em>In re C.A.C., </em>2d Dist. Nos. 2005-CA-134 and 2005-CA-135, 2006-Ohio-4003, 2006 WL 2219570, \u00b6 48, and we make clear that no parent has that authority.</p>\n<p id=\"b489-5\">{\u00b6 101} Our holdings here comport with similar decisions in other state courts that have addressed this issue, with Juv.R. 3 (which expressly countenances waiver) and with the precepts of <em>Gault, </em>which were concerned with the fundamental fairness of juvenile proceeding for all parties concerned, including the juvenile, his parents, and the state.</p>\n<p id=\"b489-6\">{\u00b6 102} In rendering our decision, we reinforce the vital role a parent can play in a delinquency proceeding.</p>\n<p id=\"b489-7\">{\u00b6 103} \u201cThe law\u2019s concept of the family rests on the presumption that parents possess what a child lacks in maturity, experience, and capacity for judgment required for making life\u2019s difficult decisions.\u201d <em>Parham v. J.R. </em>(1979), 442 U.S. 584, 602, 99 S.Ct. 2493, 61 L.Ed.2d 101. <em>Gault </em>itself presented such a scenario, with a mother who was engaged fully in securing her child\u2019s best interests and whom the court recognized could help her son determine whether to waive his rights. See 387 U.S. at 42, 87 S.Ct. 1428, 18 L.Ed.2d 527. The value of the parent in such decision-making remains today in Ohio\u2019s juvenile courts, as juveniles decide whether to waive their right to counsel.</p>\n<p id=\"b489-8\">{\u00b6 104} Having determined that the right to counsel may be waived, we must determine the indicia of a valid waiver.</p>\n<p id=\"b489-9\">{\u00b6 105} In holding that the constitutional right to counsel may be waived by a juvenile, we apply the definition of waiver used in <em>State v. Foster </em>\u2014 an \u201cintentional relinquishment or abandonment of a known right.\u201d 109 Ohio St.3d 1, 2006-Ohio-856, 845 N.E.2d 470, at \u00b6 31. As in cases involving adults, there is a strong presumption against waiver of the constitutional right to counsel. <em>Johnson v. Zerbst </em>(1938), 304 U.S. 458, 464, 58 S.Ct. 1019, 82 L.Ed. 1461.</p>\n<p id=\"b489-10\">{\u00b6 106} An effective waiver of the right to counsel by a juvenile must be voluntary, knowing, and intelligent. <em>State v. Gibson </em>(1976), 45 Ohio St.2d 366, 74 O.O.2d 525, 345 N.E.2d 399, paragraph one of the syllabus. In a juvenile court proceeding in which the judge acts as parens patriae, the judge must scrupulously ensure that the juvenile fully understands, and intentionally and intelligently relinquishes, the right to counsel. Id. at paragraph two of the syllabus; see, also, <em>State v. Davis </em>(1978), 56 Ohio St.2d 51, 54, 10 O.O.3d 87, 381 N.E.2d 641; <em>Von Moltke v. Gillies </em>(1948), 332 U.S. 708, 722, 68 S.Ct. 316, 92 L.Ed. 309 (\u201cIt is the solemn duty of a federal judge before whom a defendant appears without counsel to make a thorough inquiry and to take all steps necessary to insure the fullest <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"284\">*284</page-number>protection of this constitutional right at every stage of the proceedings\u201d); <em>In re Manuel R., </em>207 Conn. at 737-738, 543 A.2d 719 (\u201cIt is now commonly recognized that courts should take \u2018special care\u2019 in scrutinizing a purported confession or waiver by a child\u201d), citing <em>Haley, </em>332 U.S. at 599, 68 S.Ct. 302, 92 L.Ed. 224.</p>\n<p id=\"b490-4\">{\u00b6 107} In the discharge of that duty, the judge is to engage in a meaningful dialogue with the juvenile. Instead of relying solely on a prescribed formula or script for engaging a juvenile during the consideration of the waiver, see <em>Iowa v. Tovar </em>(2004), 541 U.S. 77, 88, 124 S.Ct. 1379, 158 L.Ed.2d 209, the inquisitional approach is more consistent with the juvenile courts\u2019 goals, and is best suited to address the myriad factual scenarios that a juvenile judge may face in addressing the question of waiver.</p>\n<p id=\"b490-5\">{\u00b6 108} We agree with the Supreme Court of Nebraska\u2019s recent holding that a totality-of-the-circumstances analysis is the proper test to be used in ascertaining whether there has been a valid waiver of counsel by a juvenile. <em>In re Dalton S. </em>(2007), 273 Neb. 504, 514, 730 N.W.2d 816. See, also, <em>Fare v. Michael C. </em>(1979), 442 U.S. 707, 725, 99 S.Ct. 2560, 61 L.Ed.2d 197 (applying totality-of-circumstances test to juvenile\u2019s waiver of rights). The judge must consider a number of factors and circumstances, including the age, intelligence, and education of the juvenile; the juvenile\u2019s background and experience generally and in the court system specifically; the presence or absence of the juvenile\u2019s parent, guardian, or custodian; the language used by the court in describing the juvenile\u2019s rights; the juvenile\u2019s conduct; the juvenile\u2019s emotional stability; and the complexity of the proceedings. <em>In re Dalton S., </em>273 Neb. at 515, 730 N.W.2d 816. Accord <em>Michael C., </em>442 U.S. at 725, 99 S.Ct. 2560, 61 L.Ed.2d 197.</p>\n<p id=\"b490-6\">{\u00b6 109} In cases such as this one, in which a juvenile is charged with a serious offense, the waiver of the right to counsel must be made in open court, recorded, and in writing. Cf. <em>State v. Brooke, </em>113 Ohio St.3d 199, 2007-Ohio-1533, 863 N.E.2d 1024, paragraph two of the syllabus. If a written waiver has been executed, the juvenile court judge must consider the form used and the juvenile\u2019s literacy level to ensure that the juvenile has an intelligent understanding of the document and an appreciation of the gravity of signing it. See, e.g., <em>In re Shane </em>(Jan. 26, 2001), Darke App. No. 1523, 2001 WL 62550, *3.</p>\n<p id=\"b490-7\">{\u00b6 110} Though it is not dispositive, a key factor in the totality of the circumstances is the degree to which the juvenile\u2019s parent is capable of assisting and willing to assist the juvenile in the waiver analysis. See <em>Huff v. K.P. </em>(N.D.1981), 302 N.W.2d 779, 782. The juvenile court judge must be aware that not all parents may sufficiently counsel and advise, that is, \u201crepresent,\u201d their child in a delinquency proceeding.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b491-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"285\">*285</page-number>{\u00b6 111} The juvenile court judge must be guided by Juv.R. 29 in the process of considering a waiver of counsel and in accepting an admission. Juv.R. 29(B) mandates that the juvenile court judge must advise a juvenile, at the commencement of the adjudicatory hearing, of certain rights, including the rights to counsel. Juv.R. 29(D) further mandates that before an admission can be accepted, the juvenile court judge must be satisfied that the admission is voluntarily made with the understanding of the nature of the allegations and the consequences of the admission and that by entering the admission, the juvenile is waiving the rights to confront witnesses and challenge evidence, to remain silent, and to introduce his own evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b491-6\">{\u00b6 112} As many Ohio courts of appeals recognize, \u201cAn admission in a juvenile proceeding, pursuant to Juv.R. 29, is analogous to a guilty plea made by an adult pursuant to Crim.R. 11 in that both require that a trial court personally address the defendant on the record with respect to the issues set forth in the rules.\u201d <em>In re Smith, </em>Union App. No. 14-05-33, 2006-Ohio-2788, 2006 WL 1519688. But see <em>State v. Penrod </em>(1989), 62 Ohio App.3d 720, 723, 577 N.E.2d 424 (\u201cJuv.R. 29 has no counterpart in the Criminal Rules\u201d). Because of the similarity between Juv.R. 29 and Crim.R. 11, and because we have held that only substantial compliance with the text of Crim.R. 11 is necessary, <em>State v. Nero </em>(1990), 56 Ohio St.3d 106, 108, 564 N.E.2d 474, most courts of appeals have held that only substantial compliance with Juv.R. 29 is needed. See, e.g., <em>In re C.P., </em>Lorain App. No. 04CA008534, 2005-Ohio-1819, 2005 WL 901209, \u00b6 8; <em>In re Bays, </em>Greene App. Nos. 2002-CA-52 and 2002-CA-56, 2003-Ohio-1256, 2003 WL 1193787, \u00b6 7 (\u201cWhile the failure to inform a juvenile of her rights under Juv.R. 29(B) constitutes reversible error, this court has required only substantial compliance with the rule\u201d). We agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b491-7\">{\u00b6 113} We hold that in a juvenile delinquency case, the preferred practice is strict compliance with Juv.R. 29(D). We further hold, however, that if the trial court substantially complies with Juv.R. 29(D) in accepting an admission by a juvenile, the plea will be deemed voluntary absent a showing of prejudice by the juvenile or a showing that the totality of the circumstances does not support a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"286\">*286</page-number>finding of a valid waiver. For purposes of juvenile delinquency proceedings, substantial compliance means that in the totality of the circumstances, the juvenile subjectively understood the implications of his plea.</p>\n<p id=\"b492-5\">{\u00b6 114} We believe that our holdings here reflect and reinforce the constitutional right to counsel that flows properly to the juvenile in a delinquency case, while being true to the General Assembly\u2019s intent in enacting R.C. 2151.352.</p>\n<p id=\"b492-6\">{\u00b6 115} Taken together, R.C. 2151.352 and Juv.R. 29 serve as meaningful guideposts by which the juvenile courts\u2019 judges must determine whether the due process rights from which the right to counsel arises have been satisfied in a given case. In so holding, we remain faithful to the historical goals and aspirational ideals that gave rise to Ohio\u2019s juvenile courts while recognizing the modern realities in which those courts must function.</p>\n<p id=\"b492-7\">{\u00b6 116} We now turn to the facts of this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b492-8\">{\u00b6 117} Although the magistrate secured representations from C.S. and his mother that they had signed the \u201crights papers,\u201d the record is not clear as to the knowingness of the waiver and the intelligent relinquishment of rights. At the time C.S. waived his rights, with his mother\u2019s assent, there were clear portents of additional, significant charges that would have been felony offenses had they been committed by an adult. In fact, after C.S. had waived counsel, the magistrate specifically mentioned the possibility that additional felony charges could be forthcoming.</p>\n<p id=\"b492-9\">{\u00b6 118} There is ample evidence in the record to suggest that from the time C.S. first spoke to police until he waived his right to counsel in the courtroom, his focus was on being committed so that he could be close to his older brother, who had previously been committed to the custody of the Department of Youth Services. His rationale for the admission cannot be said to be intelligent, as evidenced by the judge\u2019s conclusion that the two youths should not be housed together.</p>\n<p id=\"b492-10\">{\u00b6 119} An important aspect of our consideration in this case is our concern that there was not any meaningful advice rendered to C.S. in his decision to waive counsel. We acknowledge that an inference can be drawn that this family, through its past dealings with the juvenile courts, may have had an understanding of the process in which C.S. was engaged. But we are not satisfied that there was a sufficient showing that Ms. S. was in a position to render any meaningful advice to her son in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b492-11\">{\u00b6 120} Ms. S. had not spoken -with her son since his arrest, and she had not had an opportunity to read the police report detailing his prodigious criminal activity before agreeing that he should waive his right to legal counsel. The magistrate did not ask about those facts until after he had secured the waiver of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"287\">*287</page-number>counsel and accepted C.S.\u2019s admissions. We would not condone an attorney\u2019s failure to meet with a client prior to advising him to waive his rights to counsel or appearing before a judge for a plea hearing, and we are not satisfied that any meaningful advice was offered by Ms. S. in this matter.</p>\n<p id=\"b493-6\">{\u00b6 121} Ms. S.\u2019s only inquiry during the hearing related not to the evidence against her son, to the controlling law, or to her son\u2019s rights. Rather, like her son, she was focused on whether C.S. could be placed in the same facility in which his brother was housed. Her focus on the place of confinement was not based on the services available to her son in a particular facility but, rather, on a pragmatic concern: her means of transportation were limited, and it would be easier for her to visit her children if they were in the same institution.</p>\n<p id=\"b493-7\">{\u00b6 122} In the circumstances before us, we are not persuaded that the waiver of counsel was valid. We thus vacate the court of appeals\u2019 judgment to the extent that it held that there was a sufficient showing of a valid waiver of counsel, and we remand the cause to the juvenile court. In so doing, we do not intimate any opinion on the disposition rendered by the magistrate.</p>\n<p id=\"b493-8\">{\u00b6 123} We recognize that this case presents one of the difficult ones for a juvenile court. Despite his youth, C.S. has a significant history of alcohol and drug abuse, violence, and other behaviors that are destructive both to himself and to the community. He is on a collision course with tragedy. The magistrate\u2019s clear frustration with C.S., and with the limits of the juvenile court system, is understandable, as is a significant period of incarceration. See <em>McKeiver, </em>403 U.S. at 546, 91 S.Ct. 1976, 29 L.Ed.2d 647, fn. 6, quoting the President\u2019s Commission on Law Enforcement and Administration of Justice, Task Force Report: Juvenile Delinquency and Youth Crime (1967) 9 (\u201cWhat should distinguish the juvenile from the criminal courts is greater emphasis on rehabilitation, not exclusive preoccupation with it\u201d). But that frustration, and the judge\u2019s broad discretion in imposing disposition, cannot override the need for the careful consideration of the fairness and due process rights that <em>Gault </em>demands and the application of those principles in all delinquency cases.</p>\n<p id=\"b493-9\">Judgment reversed and cause remanded.</p>\n<judges id=\"b493-10\">Moyer, C.J., and Pfeifer, Lundberg Stratton, and Cupp, JJ., concur.</judges>\n<judges id=\"b493-11\">O\u2019Donnell and Lanzinger, JJ., dissent.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b486-8\">.

To the extent that our courts of appeals have found that parents can adequately represent their children in a legal sense in delinquency proceedings, see, e.g., <em>In re Estes, </em>Washington App. No. 04CA11, 2004-Ohio-5163, 2004 WL 2260510, we expressly reject those holdings.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b488-8\">. In essence, the fifth sentence of R.C. 2151.352 is an \u201cindependent advice/interested adult\u201d standard that we have declined to adopt, absent legislative action, in other circumstances. See, e.g., <em>In re Watson </em>(1989), 47 Ohio St.3d 86, 89-90, 548 N.E.2d 210. Though there may be a number of policy reasons to support the legislative imposition of a bright-line rule requiring a juvenile to consult with an attorney before waiving his constitutional rights, see, e.g., Minnesota Juv.Delinquency Proc.R. 3.04(1); <em>State ex rel. J.M. v. Taylor </em>(1981), 166 W.Va. 511, 276 S.E.2d 199, we do not believe that it is required by the Due Process Clause of the United States Constitution.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b490-8\">. In some cases, a parent\u2019s failure to advocate for her child may arise from misguided Solomonic wisdom, see, e.g., <em>In re Johnston </em>(2001), 142 Ohio App.3d 314, 319, 755 N.E.2d 457 (juvenile\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"285\">*285</page-number>mother agreed to pay for child\u2019s counsel, but left the task of finding and retaining counsel entirely to her 16-year-old son), while in others, it may be virtually impossible to advocate effectively for the child because of parental responsibilities to the juvenile\u2019s victims, see, e.g., <em>In re Slider, </em>160 Ohio App.3d 159, 2005-Ohio-1457, 826 N.E.2d 356, because the parent herself is a victim, or the parent is otherwise in an antagonistic capacity, cf. <em>In re C.A.C., </em>Clark App. Nos. 2005-CA-134, 2005-CA-135, 2006-Ohio-4003, 2006 WL 2219570, \u00b6 42, or has \u201cher own agenda, or [is] advocating her own best interest, which may or may not also be the child\u2019s.\u201d <em>In re Howard </em>(1997), 119 Ohio App.3d 201, 206, 695 N.E.2d 1. In such circumstances, there is no fundamental fairness in permitting the parent to represent the child, even in the limited capacity of determining whether to waive counsel.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b493-12\">O\u2019Donnell, J.,</author>\n<p id=\"AdF\">dissenting.</p>\n<p id=\"b493-13\">{\u00b6 124} I concur with the analysis offered by Justice Lanzinger in her well-reasoned dissent. The majority opinion here correctly sets forth that the case <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"288\">*288</page-number>should be analyzed using a totality-of-the-circumstances test. However, in my view, the majority reaches an improper conclusion by giving undue weight to the mother\u2019s expressed desire to have both of her children housed in the same juvenile facility.</p>\n<p id=\"b494-4\">{\u00b6 125} The majority opinion, I think, invades the province of a parent\u2019s role in raising his or her child. In rearing a child, parents are called upon to make all important decisions regarding their child\u2019s growth and development. Those decisions have significant repercussions in every aspect of that child\u2019s life\u2014 enrollment in school, provision of medical and dental care, participation in athletic or other activities, religious affiliation, and a host of other relevant and meaningful issues involving medical, moral, social, legal, and other decision-making.</p>\n<p id=\"b494-5\">{\u00b6 126} Nothing in the record before us suggests incompetence or failure of this mother to act in the best interests of her child in this instance. The majority\u2019s overemphasis on the mother\u2019s desire to have her two children housed in a single penal facility leads to an improper outcome here. For these reasons, I concur with the opinion of Justice Lanzinger.</p>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-3\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b494-6\">Lanzinger, J.,</author>\n<p id=\"Avk\">dissenting.</p>\n<p id=\"b494-7\">{\u00b6 127} I would affirm the judgment of the Licking County Court of Appeals with respect to its holding that there was a sufficient showing of the valid waiver of counsel in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b494-8\">{\u00b6 128} The record reveals that C.S. acknowledged reading and signing a form that included the statement \u201cYou have the right to be represented by an attorney at all stages of this proceeding\u201d and informed him that an attorney will be appointed if \u201cyou cannot afford an attorney and you qualify under State guidelines.\u201d The waiver of attorney that C.S. and his mother signed stated, \u201cThe undersigned have read the instructions concerning our right to an attorney and the right to a Court-appointed attorney, if applicable. Knowing and understanding these rights, we hereby waive our right to be represented by an attorney or Court-appointed attorney. We further understand that we can be represented by an attorney in the future simply by advising the Court of our intention to do so.\u201d During a colloquy with the magistrate regarding his rights, C.S. answered \u201cyes\u201d to the question \u201cDo you understand that?\u201d at least nine times. The magistrate in juvenile court determined that a valid waiver of counsel was made in accepting the plea.</p>\n<p id=\"b494-9\">{\u00b6 129} Despite this record of the proceedings, the majority holds that the waiver of counsel was invalid because C.S.\u2019s mother was not \u201cin a position to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"289\">*289</page-number>render any meaningful advice to her son,\u201d even though she was present at the delinquency adjudication hearing. Majority opinion at \u00b6 119. This conclusion stems from one sentence in R.C. 2151.352.</p>\n<p id=\"b495-6\">{\u00b6 130} The words that the majority focuses on are \u201cCounsel must be provided for a child not represented by the child\u2019s parent, guardian, or custodian.\u201d R.C. 2151.352 is a statute that relates to all juvenile proceedings, not simply delinquency adjudications. The sentence merely explains that counsel must be available (i.e., be provided) at a juvenile proceeding if a child\u2019s parent, guardian, or custodian is not. There is no question that a juvenile is entitled to representation by legal counsel at all stages of juvenile proceedings. R.C. 2151.352; Juv.R. 4(A). As the majority rightly observes, a juvenile\u2019s right to counsel is not the same as the right to be \u201crepresented\u201d by a parent, guardian, or custodian. Yet by creating a new requirement that a parent offer \u201cmeaningful advice\u201d before a child may waive the right to counsel, the majority seems to consider parental and attorney advice to be equal, at least on the issue of waiver.</p>\n<p id=\"b495-7\">{\u00b6 131} The juvenile rules allow waiver of counsel in juvenile proceedings with consent of the court. Juv.R. 3. At the beginning of an adjudicatory hearing, the juvenile court shall \u201c[ijnform unrepresented parties of their right to counsel and determine if those parties are waiving their right to counsel\u201d; \u201c[ajppoint counsel for any unrepresented party under Juv.R. 4(A) who does not waive the right to counsel\u201d; and \u201c[ijnform any unrepresented party who waives the right to counsel of the right: to obtain counsel at any stage of the proceedings, to remain silent, to offer evidence, to cross-examine witnesses, and, upon request, to have a record of all proceedings made, at public expense if indigent.\u201d Juv.R. 29(B)(3) through (5).</p>\n<p id=\"b495-8\">{\u00b6 132} Before permitting a waiver of counsel, the court has a duty to make an inquiry to determine that the waiver is of \u201ca fully known right\u201d and is voluntarily, knowingly, and intelligently made. <em>In re Gault </em>(1967), 387 U.S. 1, 42, 87 S.Ct. 1428, 18 L.Ed.2d 527. We indicated in <em>In re Agler </em>that the right to counsel is personal to the juvenile. <em>Agler </em>(1969), 19 Ohio St.2d 70, 78, 48 O.O.2d 85, 249 N.E.2d 808. So too then is the corresponding right to waive counsel. The \u201cright to the assistance of counsel implicitly embodies a \u2018correlative right to dispense with a lawyer\u2019s help.\u2019 \u201d <em>Faretta v. California </em>(1975), 422 U.S. 806, 814, 95 S.Ct. 2525, 45 L.Ed.2d 562, quoting <em>Adams v. United States ex rel. McCann </em>(1942), 317 U.S. 269, 279, 63 S.Ct. 236, 87 L.Ed. 268.</p>\n<p id=\"b495-9\">{\u00b6 133} I agree that the totality of circumstances should be considered to ascertain the validity of the waiver but disagree with the majority\u2019s emphasis on C.S.\u2019s mother\u2019s intent. \u201cMeaningful advice\u201d from a parent was not required for a valid waiver until now, and any assistance that C.S.\u2019s mother offered him would have been considered part of the totality of the circumstances the court would <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"290\">*290</page-number>consider in determining whether C.S. validly waived the right to counsel. Nothing in rule or statute requires \u201ca sufficient showing that [the parent is] in a position to render * * * meaningful advice to her son.\u201d Majority opinion at \u00b6 119.
