We reverse the court of appeals because an insurer has no duty to defend when there is no applicable \u201cunderlying insurance.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b512-13\">Case Background</p>\n<p id=\"b512-14\">{\u00b62} In late 2003, appellee Ohio Department of Administrative Services (\u201cDAS\u201d) sued appellees CPS Holding Company, Ltd., and IQ Solutions, L.L.C. (collectively, \u201cCPS\u201d), in the Franklin County Court of Common Pleas. The complaint alleged that CPS, as a third-party administrator of a program to procure natural gas, had mismanaged state funds and failed to pay the natural gas suppliers pursuant to contract. Nine causes of action were set forth, including negligence, professional negligence, breach of implied warranty, breach of contract, breach of express warranty, conversion, unjust enrichment, recovery of public funds under R.C. 117.28, and piercing of the corporate veil.</p>\n<p id=\"b512-15\">{\u00b6 3} CPS requested that appellant, Cincinnati Insurance Company, as well as other insurance companies, provide a defense. Cincinnati Insurance had issued two policies to CPS: a common policy and a commercial umbrella liability policy. After declining coverage, Cincinnati Insurance filed a declaratory judgment action against CPS in the Cuyahoga County Common Pleas Court to determine its duty to defend. DAS was added later as a party. Cincinnati Insurance filed a motion for summary judgment, and the trial court granted judgment in its favor.</p>\n<p id=\"b512-16\">{\u00b6 4} On appeal, CPS abandoned any claim under Cincinnati Insurance\u2019s common policy but continued to argue that the insurer had a duty to defend under its umbrella policy because Gulf Underwriters Insurance Company\u2019s Specialty Errors &amp; Omissions Liability Insurance Policy (\u201cE <em>&amp; </em>O policy\u201d) <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"307\">*307</page-number>potentially provided coverage for CPS in the Franklin County lawsuit. The Eighth District Court of Appeals concluded that the claims against CPS fell within the scope of Gulfs duty to defend. The court of appeals then held that the clause \u201cinsurance available to the insured under all other insurance policies applicable to the \u2018occurrence,\u2019 \u201d as used in Cincinnati Insurance\u2019s umbrella policy, was ambiguous. <em>Cincinnati Ins. Co. v. CPS Holdings, Inc., </em>8th Dist. Nos. 85967 and 85969, 2006-Ohio-713, 2006 WL 368054, \u00b6 26. The court then construed this language liberally in favor of the insured to cover Gulfs E &amp; 0 policy as \u201cunderlying insurance.\u201d Id. \u00b6 26-27. We accepted Cincinnati Insurance\u2019s discretionary appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b513-5\">Contract Principles</p>\n<p id=\"b513-6\">{\u00b6 5} \u201cAn umbrella policy is a policy which provides excess coverage beyond an insured\u2019s primary policies.\u201d <em>Midwestern Indemn. Co. v. Craig </em>(1995), 106 Ohio App.3d 158, 164, 665 N.E.2d 712. See, also, <em>Cleveland Builders Supply Co. v. Farmers Ins. Group of Cos. </em>(1995), 102 Ohio App.3d 708, 657 N.E.2d 851. Umbrella policies are different from standard excess insurance policies, since they provide both excess coverage (\u201cvertical coverage\u201d) and primary coverage (\u201chorizontal coverage\u201d). <em>Am. Special Risk Ins. Co. v. A-Best Prods., Inc. </em>(1997), 975 F.Supp. 1019, 1022. \u201cThe vertical coverage provides additional coverage above the limits of the insured\u2019s underlying primary insurance, whereas the horizontal coverage is said to \u2018drop down\u2019 to provide primary coverage for situations where the underlying insurance provides no coverage at all.\u201d Id. at 1022.</p>\n<p id=\"b513-7\">{\u00b6 6} The duty to defend arises when a complaint alleges a claim that could be covered by the insurance policy. <em>Sharonville v. Am. Emps. Ins. Co., </em>109 Ohio St.3d 186, 2006-Ohio-2180, 846 N.E.2d 833, \u00b6 13. An insurer, however, is not obligated to defend any claim that is clearly and indisputably outside the contracted policy coverage. <em>Preferred Risk Ins. Co. v. Gill </em>(1987), 30 Ohio St.3d 108, 113, 30 OBR 424, 507 N.E.2d 1118.</p>\n<p id=\"b513-8\">{\u00b6 7} \u201cAn insurance policy is a contract whose interpretation is a matter of law.\u201d <em>Sharonville, </em>109 Ohio St.3d 186, 2006-Ohio-2180, 846 N.E.2d 833, \u00b6 6. In <em>Westfield Ins. Co. v. Galatis, </em>100 Ohio St.3d 216, 2003-Ohio-5849, 797 N.E.2d 1256, \u00b6 11, we stated, \u201cWhen confronted with an issue of contractual interpretation, the role of a court is to give effect to the intent of the parties to the agreement. <em>Hamilton Ins. Serv., Inc. v. Nationwide Ins. Cos. </em>(1999), 86 Ohio St.3d 270, 273, 714 N.E.2d 898, citing <em>Employers\u2019 Liab. Assur. Corp. v. Roehm </em>(1919), 99 Ohio St. 343, 124 N.E. 223, syllabus. See, also, Section 28, Article II, Ohio Constitution. We examine the insurance contract as a whole and presume that the intent of the parties is reflected in the language used in the policy. <em>Kelly v. Med. Life Ins. Co. </em>(1987), 31 Ohio St.3d 130, 31 OBR 289, 509 N.E.2d 411, paragraph one of the syllabus. We look to the plain and ordinary meaning <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"308\">*308</page-number>of the language used in the policy unless another meaning is clearly apparent from the contents of the policy. <em>Alexander v. Buckeye Pipe Line Co. </em>(1978), 53 Ohio St.2d 241, 7 O.O.3d 403, 374 N.E.2d 146, paragraph two of the syllabus. When the language of a written contract is clear, a court may look no further than the writing itself to find the intent of the parties. Id. As a matter of law, a contract is unambiguous if it can be given a definite legal meaning. <em>Gulf Ins. Co. v. Burns Motors, Inc. </em>(Tex.2000), 22 S.W.3d 417, 423.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b514-4\">{\u00b6 8} Ambiguity in an insurance contract is construed against the insurer and in favor of the insured. <em>King v. Nationwide Ins. Co. </em>(1988), 35 Ohio St.3d 208, 519 N.E.2d 1380, syllabus. This rule, however, will not be applied so as to provide an unreasonable interpretation of the words of the policy. <em>Morfoot v. Stake </em>(1963), 174 Ohio St. 506, 23 O.O.2d 144, 190 N.E.2d 573, paragraph one of the syllabus.</p>\n<p id=\"b514-5\">Application of Legal Principles</p>\n<p id=\"b514-6\">{\u00b6 9} With those principles in mind, we turn to the insurance policy at issue. The insuring agreement within Cincinnati Insurance\u2019s umbrella policy provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"A4T\">{\u00b6 10} \u201cWe will pay on behalf of the insured the \u2018ultimate net loss\u2019 which the insured is legally obligated to pay as damages <em>in excess of the \u2018underlying insurance\u2019 </em>or for an \u2018occurrence\u2019 covered by this policy which is either excluded or not covered by \u2018underlying insurance\u2019 <em>because of:</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b514-7\">{\u00b6 11} \u201c1. \u2018Bodily injury\u2019 or \u2018property damage\u2019 covered by this policy occurring during the policy period and caused by an \u2018occurrence\u2019; or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b514-8\">{\u00b6 12} \u201c2. \u2018Personal injury\u2019 or \u2018advertising injury\u2019 covered by this policy committed during the policy period and caused by an \u2018occurrence\u2019.\u201d (Emphasis added.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b514-9\">{\u00b6 13} CPS asserts that, pursuant to this provision, Cincinnati Insurance must defend the Franklin County litigation.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> DAS and CPS argue that a portion of the insuring agreement is ambiguous because it is unclear whether the two paragraphs following the words <em>\u201cbecause of\u201d </em>limit both the phrase \u201cin excess of the \u2018underlying insurance\u2019 \u201d and the clause \u201cfor an \u2018occurrence\u2019 covered by this policy which is either excluded or not covered by \u2018underlying insurance,\u2019 \u201d or limit just the latter clause.</p>\n<p id=\"b514-10\">{\u00b6 14} The first question that must be addressed is whether Gulfs E &amp; O policy qualifies as \u201cunderlying insurance.\u201d Cincinnati Insurance\u2019s umbrella policy defines \u201cunderlying insurance\u201d as \u201cthe policies of insurance listed in the Schedule <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"309\">*309</page-number>of Underlying Policies and the insurance available to the insured under all other insurance policies applicable to the \u2018occurrence\u2019. \u2018Underlying insurance\u2019 also includes any type of self-insurance or alternative method by which the insured arranges for funding of legal liabilities that affords coverage that this policy covers.\u201d The umbrella policy also provides that \u201coccurrence\u201d means \u201c[a]n accident, including continuous or repeated exposure to substantially the same general harmful conditions, that results in \u2018bodily injury\u2019 or \u2018property damage\u2019.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b515-4\">{\u00b6 15} Thus, three types of insurance policies qualify as underlying insurance: (1) any insurance policy listed in the Schedule of Underlying Insurance Policies attached to Cincinnati Insurance\u2019s policy, (2) unlisted insurance policies applicable to an \u201coccurrence,\u201d that is, an accident that resulted in \u201cbodily injury\u201d or \u201cproperty damage,\u201d and (3) self-insurance or alternative methods of coverage.</p>\n<p id=\"b515-5\">{\u00b6 16} Without referring to the definition of the term \u201coccurrence,\u201d which is found within the policy\u2019s definition of underlying insurance, the Eighth District interpreted the clause \u201cthe insurance available to the insured under all other insurance policies applicable to the \u2018occurrence\u2019 \u201d as susceptible of more than one meaning. The appellees make two arguments in support of this holding. CPS asserts that we should ignore the policy\u2019s definition of \u201coccurrence\u201d because the word is preceded by \u201cthe\u201d instead of \u201can\u201d and is simply a generic reference to the allegations of a complaint. DAS maintains that since the word \u201coccurrence\u201d refers only to an occurrence policy rather than a claims-made policy such as Gulfs E &amp; 0 policy, the definition of \u201cunderlying insurance\u201d is ambiguous.</p>\n<p id=\"b515-6\">{\u00b6 17} Neither argument, however, is persuasive. The policy clearly states that \u201cwords and phrases that appear in quotation marks have special meaning. Refer to Definitions (Section V)-\u201d \u201cWe have long held that a contract is to be read as a whole and the intent of each part gathered from a consideration of the whole. <em>Foster Wheeler Enviresponse, Inc. v. Franklin Cty. Convention Facilities Auth. </em>(1997), 78 Ohio St.3d 353, 361, 678 N.E.2d 519. If it is reasonable to do so, we must give effect to each provision of the contract. <em>Expanded Metal Fire-Proofing Co. v. Noel Constr. Co. </em>(1913), 87 Ohio St. 428, 434, 101 N.E. 348.\u201d <em>Saunders v. Mortensen, </em>101 Ohio St.3d 86, 2004-Ohio-24, 801 N.E.2d 452, \u00b6 16.</p>\n<p id=\"b515-7\">{\u00b6 18} Taking the definition of \u201coccurrence\u201d into consideration when interpreting the term \u201cunderlying insurance\u201d does not create ambiguity or render the term unclear. Nor does the use of the word \u201coccurrence\u201d mean that claims-made policies are excluded as underlying insurance. The purpose for including the term \u201coccurrence\u201d within the definition of \u201cunderlying insurance\u201d is to limit the umbrella policy\u2019s coverage to claims arising from accidents that resulted in bodily injury or property damage.</p>\n<p id=\"b515-8\">{\u00b6 19} The Gulf E &amp; 0 policy does not fall within one of the three types of \u201cunderlying insurance\u201d defined under Cincinnati Insurance\u2019s umbrella policy. It <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"310\">*310</page-number>is not self-insurance or listed in the Schedule of Underlying Policies. Neither is the policy an insurance policy \u201capplicable to the \u2018occurrence,\u2019 \u201d because it does not cover accidents that result in bodily injury or property damage.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<attorneys id=\"AaA\">Davis &amp; Young, Richard M. Garner, and Dennis R. Fogarty, for appellant.</attorneys>\n<attorneys id=\"AhM\">Robert P. Rutter, for appellees IQ Solutions, L.L.C., CPS Holdings, Inc., CPS Holding Company, Ltd., CPS Utilities, Linda and Robert Kendall, and NCP Limited Partnership.</attorneys>\n<attorneys id=\"ABa\">Marc Dann, Attorney General, Stephen P. Carney, Deputy State Solicitor, and William J. Cole and James M. Evans, Assistant Attorneys General, for appellee Ohio Department of Administrative Services.</attorneys>\n<p id=\"b516-5\">{\u00b6 20} CPS and DAS also argue that because the umbrella policy contains a special endorsement entitled \u201cExclusion of Designated Professional Services,\u201d which does not exclude the type of services CPS provided for DAS, CPS\u2019s alleged professional negligence is covered.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> This endorsement, however, is not an insuring provision but rather an exclusion of claims for \u201cbodily injury,\u201d \u201cproperty damage,\u201d \u201cpersonal injury,\u201d or \u201cadvertising injury\u201d caused by certain professional services. The complaint pending in the Franklin County Court of Common Pleas does not allege these type of claims. Therefore, this policy provision is clearly inapplicable.</p>\n<p id=\"b516-6\">{\u00b6 21} Because Cincinnati Insurance\u2019s umbrella policy provides excess coverage for only those policies listed within its schedule or those applicable to accidents resulting in bodily injury or property damage, the Gulf E &amp; 0 policy is not \u201cunderlying insurance.\u201d Cincinnati Insurance, therefore, does not have a duty to defend CPS in the Franklin County litigation. The judgment of the Cuyahoga Court of Appeals is reversed.</p>\n<p id=\"b516-7\">Judgment reversed.</p>\n<judges id=\"b516-8\">Moyer, C.J., and Pfeifer, Lundberg Stratton, O\u2019Connor, O\u2019Donnell, and Cupp, JJ., concur.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b514-11\">. CPS had also argued in the trial court that Cincinnati Insurance had a duty to defend because CPS had suffered an \u201coccurrence\u201d that was either excluded or not covered by underlying insurance. The trial court rejected this claim, and CPS did not appeal on this issue.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b516-12\">. {\u00b6 a} In its exclusion section, Gulfs E &amp; 0 policy clearly states: \u201cWe are not obligated to pay Damages or Claim Expenses or defend Claims for or arising directly or indirectly out of:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b516-13\">{\u00b6 b} \u201ca.
