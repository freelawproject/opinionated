The next day, searchers found Brittany\u2019s raped, battered body hidden in a nearby abandoned well. Appellant, Frederick A. Mundt, was convicted of the aggravated murder of Brittany and sentenced to death.</p>\n<p id=\"b228-14\">{\u00b6 2} The evidence at Mundt\u2019s trial revealed that Brittany\u2019s mother, Misty Hendrickson, became acquainted with Mundt in 1999. She and her daughters, Brittany and Lindsay, soon moved into Mundt\u2019s house in Lower Salem, Noble County. In 2004, Mundt and Hendrickson lived there with Brittany and Lindsay, and their infant son, Shay Mundt. Mundt\u2019s mother, Sarah Mundt, lived nearby with her boyfriend Tim Bowman and their adult daughters, Mundt\u2019s half-sisters, Timica, Teresa, and Mary Anne Bowman.</p>\n<p id=\"b229-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"23\">*23</page-number>{\u00b6 3} During the late morning or early afternoon of March 9, 2004, Mundt visited the Biolife Plasma Services Plasma Center in Parkersburg, West Virginia to sell his blood plasma.</p>\n<p id=\"b229-4\">{\u00b6 4} March 9, 2004, was a school day for Brittany Hendrickson. The school bus brought her home that day around 4:10 p.m., and her bus driver saw her go inside the house.</p>\n<p id=\"b229-5\">{\u00b6 5} Five or ten minutes later, Mundt\u2019s stepfather, Tim Bowman, arrived. Bowman and Sarah, along with their daughter Mary Anne and her date, had plans to play bingo that night in Woodsfield, Ohio. Bowman came to invite Hendrickson to join them. After checking with Mundt, Hendrickson accepted. Bowman was at Mundt\u2019s house for five to ten minutes; during that time, he saw Brittany and Lindsay at play.</p>\n<p id=\"b229-6\">{\u00b6 6} Hendrickson fed her daughters about 4:45 p.m. Half an hour later, Bowman arrived at Mundt\u2019s house to pick Hendrickson up.</p>\n<p id=\"b229-7\">{\u00b6 7} Hendrickson said goodbye and \u201ctold the kids to go upstairs with their dad [Mundt] when they [were] done eating.\u201d Although Bowman did not enter the house, he recalled hearing Hendrickson telling the girls to eat dinner and go upstairs.</p>\n<p id=\"b229-8\">{\u00b6 8} Around 8:00 p.m., Mundt arrived at the Bowman residence with Lindsay and Shay. Timica and Teresa Bowman were present. Mundt asked Timica if Brittany was there and said, \u201c[S]he ain\u2019t up home, and I have to find her.\u201d Leaving the children with Teresa, Mundt and Timica drove to Woodsfield.</p>\n<p id=\"b229-9\">{\u00b6 9} They arrived at the bingo hall around 8:30 p.m. Mundt approached Hendrickson and asked if Brittany was with her. Hendrickson replied, \u201cNo, I left her there with you.\u201d She got up, grabbed her coat, and left with Mundt and Timica. The three then drove back to Mundt\u2019s house. At 9:18 p.m., Hendrickson called the Monroe County Sheriffs Office to report Brittany missing. Officers immediately began to search for Brittany, a search that lasted into the next day.</p>\n<p id=\"b229-10\">{\u00b6 10} On March 10, a civilian volunteer taking part in the search noticed a sheet of tin covering the opening of an old well on property near Mundt\u2019s house. Moving the tin revealed a chunk of concrete wedged into the opening of the well. The surface of the well water was visible around the sides of the concrete chunk. The volunteer looked into the well and saw a pair of green shoes floating amid some debris. The volunteer reported his find and led sheriffs deputies to the well.</p>\n<p id=\"b229-11\">{\u00b6 11} The deputies recovered one of the shoes and brought it to Hendrickson, who identified it as Brittany\u2019s. Other officers removed the chunk of concrete and recovered Brittany\u2019s body from the well.</p>\n<p id=\"b230-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"24\">*24</page-number>{\u00b6 12} Shortly after the officers recovered her body, Agents Gary Wilgus and William Hatfield of the Bureau of Criminal Identification and Investigation (\u201cBCI\u201d) arrived at the crime scene. Wilgus noted numerous abrasions and contusions on Brittany\u2019s head. Her jeans were undone, and the leg bottoms partly covered her feet.</p>\n<p id=\"b230-5\">{\u00b6 13} Hatfield found bloodstains and hairs on the chunk of concrete from the well. Hatfield later weighed and measured the chunk; it was 36 inches long and 14 inches wide at its widest point and weighed 254 pounds.</p>\n<p id=\"b230-6\">{\u00b6 14} According to Hendrickson, Mundt stated on the morning of March 10 that \u201cthey will probably pin this on him * * * because he was supposed to be the last one to see her.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b230-7\">{\u00b6 15} Detective Sergeant Mark Warden and Lieutenant Seevers of the Washington County Sheriffs Office interviewed Mundt after Brittany\u2019s body was found. Mundt asked whether a condemned prisoner could \u201cchoose between lethal injection and the gas chamber.\u201d Warden then informed Mundt that Brittany\u2019s body had been found and that Warden \u201cfelt he was responsible for [her] death.\u201d Mundt denied it.</p>\n<p id=\"b230-8\">{\u00b6 16} Warden noted that Mundt\u2019s forearms were scratched. Mundt claimed that the family dog had knocked him down some steps while he was looking for Brittany. When Warden expressed disbelief, Mundt merely hung his head. Biolife Plasma Services personnel later testified that Mundt did not have those scratches on his arm when he sold plasma on the morning of March 9.</p>\n<p id=\"b230-9\">{\u00b6 17} Seevers asked Mundt whether Brittany could have been sexually assaulted. Mundt first said no, then asked, \u201cWell, how would I know?\u201d The officers then took a DNA swab and collected other trace evidence from Mundt\u2019s person. As Warden was cataloguing these items, Mundt asked: \u201cDo you think I should die?\u201d Warden replied, \u201cWell, do you think you should be put to death?\u201d Mundt said, \u201cYes.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b230-10\">{\u00b6 18} Dr. P.S.S. Sreenivasa Murthy, a pathologist and deputy coroner for Stark and Wayne Counties, conducted an autopsy on Brittany, assisted by Dr. Anthony Bertin, a urologist, who examined Brittany\u2019s genitalia.</p>\n<p id=\"b230-11\">{\u00b6 19} Dr. Murthy found that Brittany had extensive blunt-force head injuries. These included multiple lacerations and bruises, a skull fracture, and hemorrhaging and contusions of the brain. She also had blunt-force injuries to her trunk and extremities.</p>\n<p id=\"b230-12\">{\u00b6 20} Brittany\u2019s lungs were hyperinflated and contained excess fluid, leading Dr. Murthy to conclude that she had drowned in the well. But because Brittany was 47 inches tall while the water in the well was only 30 to 36 inches deep, Murthy concluded that Brittany\u2019s injuries had left her unable to stand up. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"25\">*25</page-number>Murthy also concluded that given the severity of her injuries, Brittany would have died within 10 to 15 minutes. Thus, Murthy concluded that she died both of drowning and of her multiple blunt-force injuries.</p>\n<p id=\"b231-6\">{\u00b6 21} Dr. Bertin, the urologist, observed that Brittany\u2019s panties were soaked with blood. Her vaginal opening was \u201cimploded,\u201d as if a large object had been forced into it. Her vaginal walls had been \u201cripped apart,\u201d with deep, full-length lacerations on both sides. In Dr. Bertin\u2019s opinion, a rigid object, approximately two and one-half inches in diameter, had been forced up Brittany\u2019s vaginal canal with \u201cconsiderable force.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b231-7\">{\u00b6 22} Diane Larson, a BCI forensic scientist, examined numerous evidentiary items. Those yielding significant DNA evidence included vaginal swabs taken during Brittany\u2019s autopsy, fabric cut from the crotch of Brittany\u2019s panties, a bloodstained bedsheet found on the bed in Mundt\u2019s master bedroom, and a bloodstained shirt found in Mundt\u2019s bathroom and identified as his.</p>\n<p id=\"b231-8\">{\u00b623} Larson found sperm cells on the vaginal swabs and on Brittany\u2019s panties. She identified a mixture of two DNA profiles on the sperm fraction of the vaginal swabs. One of the mixed profiles was consistent with Mundt; the other was consistent with Brittany. The proportion of the population that could not be excluded as a possible contributor to that mixture was one in 203,800.</p>\n<p id=\"b231-9\">{\u00b6 24} On the panties, Larson identified \u201ctwo clean separate DNA profiles.\u201d The major profile, or largest amount, came from sperm and was consistent with Mundt\u2019s DNA. The expected frequency of the major profile was one in approximately 39 quadrillion, 350 trillion persons. The minor profile was consistent with Brittany\u2019s DNA.</p>\n<p id=\"b231-10\">{\u00b6 25} On the bedsheet, DNA testing showed a mixture of two DNA profiles. The major profile was consistent with Mundt\u2019s DNA; the minor profile was consistent with Brittany\u2019s. The expected frequency of the minor profile was one in 146 million persons.</p>\n<p id=\"b231-11\">{\u00b6 26} Mark Losko, another forensic scientist at BCI, testified that testing on Mundt\u2019s shirt revealed a mixture of two DNA profiles. The major profile was consistent with Brittany\u2019s DNA. The expected frequency of that profile was one in 4.7 quadrillion persons. The minor profile was consistent with Mundt\u2019s DNA.</p>\n<p id=\"b231-12\">{\u00b6 27} After Mundt\u2019s arrest, his half-brother, Johnny Mundt, visited him in jail. Johnny testified that he asked Mundt \u201cif he done it.\u201d Mundt admitted that he had raped Brittany. Then he asked Johnny \u201cif I can get the stuff out of the house.\u201d Mundt told Johnny that \u201cthe stuff\u201d was behind the stereo. Johnny agreed to remove it.</p>\n<p id=\"b231-13\">{\u00b6 28} On April 24 and 25, 2004, while Mundt was incarcerated in the county jail, he had several telephone conversations with Johnny. In these conversations, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"26\">*26</page-number>Mundt repeatedly urged Johnny to remove and destroy certain \u201cstuff\u2019 or \u201ctrash\u201d located in the wall behind the stereo in Mundt\u2019s house. The sheriffs office recorded these conversations, and the state introduced them at trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b232-5\">{\u00b6 29} These recordings convey Mundt\u2019s sense of urgency and concern for secrecy because he continually expressed his anxiety about when Johnny was going to burn the \u201ctrash\u201d and whether he had burned \u201call of it.\u201d He warned Johnny that their conversation was being taped and reminded him several times not to let their mother see him burning the \u201ctrash.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b232-6\">{\u00b6 30} On April 24, Mundt asked Johnny: \u201cHey, did you get all that stuff out of there where the radio is? * * * Would you be able to get that out?\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b232-7\">{\u00b6 31} Mundt continued:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b232-8\">{\u00b6 32} \u201cYou going to burn that stuff? * * * Well, make sure Mom ain\u2019t down there when you get burning that. * * * I really \u2014 really hope you can do that for me.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b232-9\">{\u00b6 33} \u201cYou, uh, sure you can get that stuff out of there? * * * I\u2019m really a-hoping. * * * \u2019Cause I\u2019m really wanting that stuff out of there. You hear? * * * Make sure you get it all.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b232-11\">{\u00b6 34} \u201cYeah, I hope you do that, take \u2014 take that trash out. Out \u2014 out back of the stereo. I really need to get that out of the house. You hear? * * * Back behind the stereo, yeah. Where the wall\u2019s at? * * * Down in there. * * * You going to burn all that? * * * That would do me a lot of good.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b232-12\">{\u00b6 35} On the following day, Mundt talked to Johnny three more times. In the first of these conversations, Mundt asked: \u201cDid you get all that trash burnt?\u201d Mundt explained that the \u201ctrash\u201d was hidden in the wall to the left of the stereo \u201cwhere the insulation [was] moved,\u201d approximately two feet away from the drywall. He instructed Johnny to \u201cfind all that trash\u201d and \u201cget rid of that for me and burn it. * * * Don\u2019t have Ma and them up there.\u201d He also warned Johnny that \u201c[t]his telephone\u2019s taped.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b232-13\">{\u00b6 36} In their second conversation on April 25, Mundt pressed Johnny: \u201cDid you get it? * * * Did you get all of it? * * * Make sure you burn all that trash. * * * Mom and them can\u2019t see that.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b232-15\">{\u00b6 37} In his third April 25 conversation with Johnny, Mundt again asked: \u201cDid you make sure that other trash is burnt?\u201d He told Johnny to \u201cmake sure that burns up nice and good. * * * Make sure there ain\u2019t nothing left of it. * * * \u2019Cause they be up there looking through that next.\u201d Johnny said, \u201cThey\u2019re done up there, they ain\u2019t gonna go back up there.\u201d Mundt replied, \u201cDon\u2019t bet on it.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b232-17\">{\u00b6 38} According to Johnny, he eventually found \u201ca little hole\u201d in the corner of a room in Mundt\u2019s house. In that hole, Johnny found a pair of boxer shorts, a T-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"27\">*27</page-number>shirt, a pair of girl\u2019s socks, and a pillowcase, each spattered with blood. Johnny-put these items into a box and hid the box in another part of the house. The next day, he took the box home and burned it with the bloodstained items inside.</p>\n<p id=\"b233-6\">{\u00b6 39} On April 26, Mundt talked to Sarah Mundt from jail. The sheriffs office recorded this conversation. Sarah mentioned that Johnny had been burning things the night before, including a box. Mundt had his mother describe the box, then asked: \u201cHe burn it?\u201d Mundt pressed Sarah for details: \u201cDid you go up with him last night? * * * Did he pour gas on all that trash? * * * Did it burn?\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b233-7\">{\u00b6 40} On May 3, 2004, police searched Mundt\u2019s house again. In a second-floor room, between a floor joist and the exterior wall, they found the space where Mundt had hidden the bloodstained items.</p>\n<p id=\"b233-8\">{\u00b6 41} Police cut out a section of the floor joist from the hiding place. The joist tested positive for blood. Mark Losko, the BCI forensic scientist, found a mixture of two DNA profiles on the joist. The major contributor\u2019s DNA profile was consistent with Brittany\u2019s and would be found in one of 4.7 quadrillion persons. The minor contributor\u2019s DNA profile was consistent with Mundt\u2019s and would be found in one of 139 persons.</p>\n<p id=\"b233-9\">{\u00b6 42} On June 19, Mundt had yet another phone conversation with his mother from jail, and this too was recorded by the sheriffs office. Mundt urged his mother to remove his weights from his house: \u201cYou need to get those weights out of there. * * * They\u2019ll use that against me. * * * They\u2019ll try to say that I lifted those things down there. * * * Well, at least take some of the weights off the weight bench. * * * Did you take any weights off it?\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b233-10\">Verdict and Sentence</p>\n<p id=\"b233-11\">{\u00b6 43} At trial, the jury found Mundt guilty of four counts of aggravated murder, each with four death specifications; two counts of rape, R.C. 2907.02(A)(1)(b) and (A)(2); and one count of kidnapping.</p>\n<p id=\"b233-12\">{\u00b6 44} Before the penalty phase, the trial court merged the four aggravated-murder counts into a single count of aggravated murder under R.C. 2903.01(C) (murder of a child under 13) and merged the four specifications into two: murder to escape detection, apprehension, trial, or punishment for another offense, R.C. 2929.04(A)(3), and murder committed during a kidnapping, R.C. 2929.04(A)(7).</p>\n<p id=\"b233-13\">{\u00b6 45} The jury recommended that Mundt be sentenced to death for his aggravated-murder conviction. The trial judge sentenced Mundt to death. Mundt appeals his convictions and death sentence to this court as of right.</p>\n<p id=\"b233-14\">{\u00b6 46} Mundt presents 11 propositions of law for our consideration. We find no merit in any of his claims. Furthermore, we have independently reviewed the sentence of death, as R.C. 2929.05 requires, and find that the aggravating <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"28\">*28</page-number>circumstances outweigh the mitigating factors beyond a reasonable doubt. We have also conducted a proportionality review and conclude that the death sentence is proportionate with others we have affirmed. Therefore, we affirm Mundt\u2019s convictions and death sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b234-4\">I. Ineffective Assistance of Counsel</p>\n<p id=\"b234-5\">{\u00b6 47} In his first proposition of law, Mundt contends that his trial counsel rendered ineffective assistance of counsel during voir dire, the guilt phase, and the penalty phase.</p>\n<p id=\"b234-6\">A. Ineffective Assistance During Voir Dire</p>\n<p id=\"b234-7\">{\u00b6 48} Mundt makes three ineffective-assistance claims relating to the voir dire. First, Mundt claims that his trial counsel rendered ineffective assistance during the voir dire of juror Julie Watson by not asking her about statements on her juror questionnaire. Second, he claims that his counsel should have challenged juror Connie Gaydosik, either for cause or peremptorily, and also should have asked her about specific mitigating factors. Third, he claims that counsel prejudiced him by asking a hypothetical question on voir dire that, in effect, conceded his guilt.</p>\n<p id=\"b234-8\">1. Voir Dire of Julie Watson</p>\n<p id=\"b234-9\">{\u00b6 49} In <em>Morgan v. Illinois </em>(1992), 504 U.S. 719, 112 S.Ct. 2222, 119 L.Ed.2d 492, the United States Supreme Court held that a juror who will automatically vote for death without regard to mitigating factors is biased and may not sit in a capital case. Mundt contends that certain responses on Watson\u2019s jury questionnaire indicate that Watson may have been such a juror, at least in a case involving the rape and murder of a young child. Mundt therefore contends that defense counsel should have specifically questioned her about those responses on voir dire and that counsel\u2019s failure to do so constituted ineffective assistance.</p>\n<p id=\"b234-10\">{\u00b6 50} Mundt focuses on the following questions and answers from Watson\u2019s questionnaire:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b234-11\">{\u00b6 51} \u201c60. What is your opinion concerning capital punishment? * * * Please explain your choice.\u201d Given six options ranging from \u201cStrongly favor\u201d to \u201cStrongly oppose,\u201d Watson checked \u201cFavor,\u201d adding, \u201cWhen concerning child abuse, mu[r]der[,] rape.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b234-12\">{\u00b6 52} \u201c61. If you were told by the Court that you must follow a legal principle which was in conflict with your personal convictions, what would you do?\u201d Watson wrote: \u201cI do things the way I know in my heart I should.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b234-13\">{\u00b6 53} \u201c63. What factors do you think are relevant in deciding whether a person should be sentenced to the penalty of death or to the penalty of life <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"29\">*29</page-number>imprisonment without the possibility of parole?\u201d Watson wrote: \u201cAbuse or murder of child[,] rape.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b235-4\">{\u00b6 54} \u201c67. In what types of cases/offenses do you feel the death penalty should be imposed?\u201d Watson wrote: \u201cChild abuse/mu[r]der/Rape.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b235-5\">{\u00b6 55} \u201c69. \u201cAs a result of your having been asked to fill out this questionnaire, have you now formed an opinion about this case? If so, please explain.\u201d Watson wrote: \u201cI am assuming this is the Mundt\u2019s case. My family talked about this case. My nephew went to school with Brittany. This was very upsetting. I have 2 little girls of my own and lots of neice\u2019s [sic] and nephew\u2019s [sic]. I hate anything to happen to children. Child abuse/mu[r]der [and] rape are the worst things to me. Children are innocent. We as parents are put on this world to protect them.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b235-6\">{\u00b6 56} \u201c70. \u201cDo you know, or have you seen, heard, or read anything about this case?\u201d Watson checked \u201cYes\u201d and wrote: \u201cMy sister told me about it. I don\u2019t know much about it[;] to me it is horrible.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b235-7\">{\u00b6 57} \u201c71. Please add any additional remarks touching on any of the questions asked or any of the topics bearing on your serving as a juror in this case.\u201d Watson wrote: \u201cI will try to be fair in my opinion but I feel very strongly against child abuse, child mu[r]der and sexual abuse/rape.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b235-8\">{\u00b6 58} On general voir dire, Mundt\u2019s trial counsel informed the prospective jurors that Mundt was \u201ccharged with the rape, kidnapping and aggravated murder of a seven-year-old girl.\u201d He asked the jurors whether any of them had \u201csuch strong feelings regarding these crimes that it would be difficult to fairly and impartially weigh the facts at trial where those crimes have been alleged?\u201d Watson raised her hand and stated: \u201cMy daughter\u2019s seven and it\u2019s kind of violent and it bothers me, <em>but I think I\u2019ll be able to handle it.\u201d </em>(Emphasis added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b235-9\">{\u00b6 59} On individual voir dire, the trial judge asked Watson about pretrial publicity. She said that she did not watch much TV or read the newspaper, but added: \u201cMy sister talked about the case and it was upsetting what she told me, though. I don\u2019t know anything about it.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b235-10\">{\u00b6 60} Of the death penalty, she said: \u201cI never really considered it. * * * I don\u2019t have a major opinion about it.\u201d \u201cI really don\u2019t have an opinion. * * * Sometimes, yes, they probably do need the death penalty, yes. I\u2019m not towards it or against the death penalty, either way.\u201d Asked if she could weigh mitigating factors and return a life sentence, she said: \u201cI believe I could.\u201d When asked whether she could return a death sentence if the state proved that the aggravating circumstances outweighed the mitigating factors, she initially responded: \u201cI don\u2019t know. * * * Right now I couldn\u2019t tell you.\u201d Ultimately, Watson said that she could return a death sentence. However, she would decide the sentence only <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"30\">*30</page-number>\u201c[a]fter everything was done\u201d and would not sign a death verdict with which she disagreed merely because the other 11 jurors agreed to it.</p>\n<p id=\"b236-5\">{\u00b6 61} Mundt\u2019s trial counsel declined to ask Watson any questions on individual voir dire and did not challenge her for cause. Watson ultimately served on the jury.</p>\n<p id=\"b236-6\">{\u00b6 62} To establish ineffective assistance, Mundt must show (1) deficient performance by counsel, i.e., performance falling below an objective standard of reasonable representation, and (2) prejudice, i.e., a reasonable probability that but for counsel\u2019s errors, the proceeding\u2019s result would have been different. <em>Strickland v. Washington </em>(1984), 466 U.S. 668, 687-688, 694, 104 S.Ct. 2052, 80 L.Ed.2d 674; <em>State v. Bradley </em>(1989), 42 Ohio St.3d 136, 538 N.E.2d 373. In this instance, Mundt has not established either element of ineffective assistance of counsel required by <em>Strickland.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b236-7\">{\u00b6 63} We have consistently declined to \u201csecond-guess trial strategy decisions\u201d or impose \u201chindsight views about how current counsel might have voir dired the jury differently.\u201d <em>State v. Mason </em>(1998), 82 Ohio St.3d 144, 157, 694 N.E.2d 932. See also <em>State v. Group, </em>98 Ohio St.3d 248, 2002-Ohio-7247, 781 N.E.2d 980, \u00b6 139; <em>State v. Murphy </em>(2001), 91 Ohio St.3d 516, 539, 747 N.E.2d 765; <em>Bradley, </em>42 Ohio St.3d at 143-144, 538 N.E.2d 373.</p>\n<p id=\"b236-8\">{\u00b6 64} \u201cFew decisions at trial are as subjective or prone to individual attorney strategy as juror <em>voir dire, </em>where decisions are often made on the basis of intangible factors.\u201d <em>Miller v. Francis </em>(C.A.6, 2001), 269 F.3d 609, 620. \u201cThe selection of a jury is inevitably a call upon experience and intuition. The trial lawyer must draw upon his own insights and empathetic abilities. Written records give us only shadows for measuring the quality of such efforts. * * * [T]he selection process is more an art than a science, and more about people than about rules.\u201d <em>Romero v. Lynaugh </em>(C.A.5, 1989), 884 F.2d 871, 878. For these reasons, we have recognized that \u201ccounsel is in the best position to determine whether any potential juror should be questioned and to what extent.\u201d <em>Murphy, </em>91 Ohio St.3d at 539, 747 N.E.2d 765; see also <em>Bradley, </em>42 Ohio St.3d at 143, 538 N.E.2d 373.</p>\n<p id=\"b236-9\">{\u00b6 65} In some cases, asking few or no questions of a prospective juror \u201cmay be the best tactic for a number of reasons. For example, questioning by other parties may convince counsel that the juror would be favorable for the defense, and that further questions might only antagonize the juror or give the prosecution a reason to use a peremptory challenge or even grounds for a challenge for cause.\u201d <em>People v. Freeman </em>(1994), 8 Cal.4th 450, 485, 34 Cal.Rptr.2d 558, 882 P.2d 249.</p>\n<p id=\"b236-10\">{\u00b6 66} Upon review of the entire record, including Watson\u2019s voir dire as well as her responses to the questionnaire, defense counsel may have concluded that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"31\">*31</page-number>Watson \u201cwould be favorable for the defense.\u201d Watson\u2019s voir dire suggests that she was less than a strong supporter of capital punishment. She stated repeatedly that she had no opinion about the death penalty. Asked whether she could return a death sentence, Watson initially answered that she did not know, although she ultimately decided that she could. And she expressed an independent frame of mind: \u201cIf that\u2019s what I chose, yes, I could sign [a death-sentence verdict]. But if it\u2019s just everyone else, it\u2019s not what I chose, then I\u2019m not going to sign my name to it.\u201d Based on this record, Mundt has not established deficient performance on the part of defense counsel.</p>\n<p id=\"b237-6\">{\u00b6 67} Nor has he established prejudice. When a defendant bases an ineffective-assistance claim on an assertion that his counsel allowed the impanelment of a biased juror, the defendant <em>\u201cmust </em>show that the juror was <em>actually biased </em>against him.\u201d (Emphasis added.) <em>Miller v. Francis, </em>269 F.3d at 616, citing <em>Hughes v. United States </em>(C.A.6, 2001), 258 F.3d 453, 458. See also <em>Goeders v. Hundley </em>(C.A.8, 1995), 59 F.3d 73, 75, citing <em>Smith v. Phillips </em>(1982), 455 U.S. 209, 215, 102 S.Ct. 940, 71 L.Ed.2d 78; <em>Carratelli v. State </em>(Fla.App.2005), 915 So.2d 1256, 1260-1261.</p>\n<p id=\"b237-7\">{\u00b6 68} Although Mundt argues that Watson was biased, the record does not support that claim. Like the juror in <em>Miller v. Francis, </em>269 F.3d at 617, Watson \u201cnever stated that she could not be fair.\u201d Cf. <em>Miller v. Webb </em>(C.A.6, 2004), 385 F.3d 666, 679 (record supported actual-bias claim where juror expressly admitted bias).</p>\n<p id=\"b237-8\">{\u00b6 69} Nor does anything in the record suggest that Watson had a \u201cclose personal relationship,\u201d <em>Miller v. Francis, </em>269 F.3d at 617, with the victim or the victim\u2019s family. The record shows only that Watson\u2019s <em>nephew </em>attended school with Brittany. It would be speculative to assume either that this was a close relationship or that it had any influence on Watson. Cf. <em>Wolfe v. Brigano </em>(C.A.6, 2000), 232 F.3d 499, 502 (jurors who had close, ongoing relationships with victim\u2019s parents and had discussed case with them were biased) with <em>Miller v. Francis, </em>269 F.3d at 617-619 (distinguishing <em>Wolfe).</em></p>\n<p id=\"b237-9\">{\u00b6 70} Neither does Watson\u2019s discussion about the case with her sister establish bias. That discussion occurred before Watson was called for jury duty. Watson stated on voir dire that although she and her sister had discussed the case, she \u201cd[id]n\u2019t know anything really about it.\u201d Thus, the record does not establish that Watson had any extensive or detailed knowledge about the case as a result of the discussion. <em>Miller v. Francis, </em>269 F.3d at 616. Moreover, \u201c[j]urors need not be totally ignorant of the facts and issues involved in the case. * * * \u2018[I]t is beyond question that mere prior knowledge of the existence of the case, or familiarity with the issues involved, or even some preexisting opinion as to the merits, does not in and of itself raise a presumption of jury taint; such a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"32\">*32</page-number>standard would be certainly unsalutary, and likewise impossible to achieve.\u2019 \u201d <em>Miller v. Francis, </em>269 F.3d at 616, quoting <em>DeLisle v. Rivers </em>(C.A.6, 1998), 161 F.3d 370, 382.</p>\n<p id=\"b238-4\">{\u00b6 71} Mundt argues that Watson was biased because she was an automatic-death-penalty juror. To the contrary, however, neither Watson\u2019s questionnaire nor her voir dire responses support the conclusion that she was an automatic-death-penalty juror. Question 65 of the questionnaire asked prospective jurors to give their opinion of the statement \u201cPersons convicted of murder should be swiftly executed.\u201d Watson responded: \u201cI would have to know the case before I could have an opinion.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b238-5\">{\u00b6 72} On voir dire, after explaining the weighing process and the three life-sentencing options, the prosecutor asked Watson:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b238-6\">{\u00b6 73} \u201cIf these [the aggravating circumstances and mitigating factors] are of equal weight or the mitigating factors are of more weight than the aggravating circumstances, then your verdict would be one of the three of these [life sentences].</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b238-7\">{\u00b6 74} \u201cCould you do that?\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b238-8\">{\u00b6 75} Watson replied: \u201cI believe I could.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b238-9\">{\u00b6 76} This record does not establish that Watson harbored any bias. To the contrary, her responses indicated that she would be an open-minded juror. Accordingly, Mundt has not established actual bias or that he suffered prejudice because his attorneys allowed Watson to be seated as a juror. <em>Miller v. Francis, </em>269 F.3d at 616; <em>Hushes, </em>258 F.3d at 458. As Mundt has failed to demonstrate deficient performance of counsel, he has failed to meet the <em>Strickland </em>test, and we reject his claim that his counsel rendered ineffective assistance with regard to Watson.</p>\n<p id=\"b238-10\">2. Voir Dire of Connie Gaydosik</p>\n<p id=\"b238-11\">{\u00b6 77} Mundt contends that his counsel should have challenged Connie Gaydosik for cause on the grounds that she was biased in favor of the death penalty. Gaydosik had stated on her questionnaire that \u201c[i]n some cases,\u201d death \u201cis the only just punishment.\u201d And on voir dire, defense counsel asked Gaydosik whether death \u201cwould be the only just punishment\u201d where the jury found the defendant guilty of kidnapping and raping a seven-year-old, then killing her to escape detection. Gaydosik said, \u201cAs far as I\u2019m concerned, yes.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b238-12\">{\u00b6 78} However, immediately after this exchange, defense counsel then asked Gaydosik whether she would still regard death as the only just punishment if the aggravating circumstances of rape, kidnapping, witness-murder, and murder to avoid detection <em>did not </em>outweigh the mitigating factors beyond a reasonable <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"33\">*33</page-number>doubt. Gaydosik replied: \u201cNot if the mitigating factors outweighed \u2014 if I feel that they outweighed the aggravating circumstances.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b239-5\">{\u00b6 79} Gaydosik also said on her voir dire: \u201c[I]f you\u2019re going to sentence somebody to death or not to death, I\u2019d want to know everything I could about that person before I made a ruling on that.\u201d She said that she could consider mitigating evidence offered by the defense, that hearing mitigating evidence would be important, and that whether a murderer should be executed \u201cdepends on the circumstances.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b239-6\">{\u00b6 80} Counsel asked what Gaydosik would do if the aggravating circumstances outweighed the mitigating circumstances \u201cby a preponderance of the evidence.\u201d Gaydosik said: \u201cIt would depend on what mitigating factors had been presented to me that I had to consider before I could answer that honestly. * * * I mean, frame of mind, the circumstances of how it happened, what happened, all of that. * * * I would have to actually hear [the mitigating factors] to know how to be able to give you an answer on that.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b239-7\">{\u00b6 81} Finally, Gaydosik said that she would want to hear mitigating evidence before considering death, that she could return a life sentence if the state failed to prove that aggravating circumstances outweighed mitigating factors beyond a reasonable doubt, and that she would not require the defense to prove that mitigation outweighed aggravation. Whether a life sentence was appropriate, Gaydosik said, \u201cwould depend * * *; I\u2019d have to see everything proven to me.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b239-8\">{\u00b6 82} Taken as a whole, Gaydosik\u2019s voir dire responses made clear that she was not an automatic-death-penalty juror and would consider mitigating circumstances. These answers would not have supported a challenge for cause, and therefore defense counsel cannot be considered ineffective for failing to make such a challenge.</p>\n<p id=\"b239-9\">{\u00b6 83} Mundt further contends that defense counsel should have removed Gaydosik with a peremptory challenge. But \u201c \u2018[b]ecause the use of peremptory challenges is inherently subjective and intuitive, an appellate record will rarely disclose reversible incompetence in this process.\u2019 \u201d <em>Freeman, </em>8 Cal.4th at 485, 34 Cal.Rptr.2d 558, 882 P.2d 249, quoting <em>People v. Montiel </em>(1993), 5 Cal.4th 877, 911, 21 Cal.Rptr.2d 705, 855 P.2d 1277. Upon review, this record does not demonstrate \u201creversible incompetence\u201d in defense counsel\u2019s decision not to expend one of the six peremptory challenges on this juror.</p>\n<p id=\"b239-10\">{\u00b6 84} Mundt also contends that his counsel acted unreasonably by failing to question Gaydosik about specific mitigating factors. However, trial counsel is entitled to exercise broad discretion in formulating voir dire questions. See <em>Group, </em>98 Ohio St.3d 248, 2002-Ohio-7247, 781 N.E.2d 980, \u00b6 139; <em>Murphy, </em>91 Ohio St.3d at 539, 747 N.E.2d 765; <em>Bradley, </em>42 Ohio St.3d at 143-144, 538 N.E.2d 373. We further note that the parties are not entitled to ask about specific <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"34\">*34</page-number>mitigating factors during voir dire. See, e.g., <em>State v. Wilson </em>(1996), 74 Ohio St.3d 381, 386, 659 N.E.2d 292.</p>\n<p id=\"b240-5\">3. Allegation that Defense Counsel Conceded Guilt</p>\n<p id=\"AAX\">{\u00b6 85} Mundt argues that his counsel rendered ineffective assistance on voir dire by \u201csound[ing] like a prosecutor\u201d in questioning two jurors. Defense counsel asked the jurors to assume that they found Mundt guilty of \u201cpurposely raping an innocent seven-year-old girl,\u201d then carrying out \u201ca calculated scheme * * * to escape detection\u201d by kidnapping and killing her. Counsel then asked whether the jurors would consider a life sentence to be \u201ca real punishment\u201d in such a case. Mundt contends that this question, in effect, conceded his guilt.</p>\n<p id=\"b240-6\">{\u00b6 86} This contention is not well taken. Defense counsel\u2019s hypothetical question, asking jurors how they would proceed in the sentencing phase <em>if </em>they found Mundt guilty, was not a concession of guilt. Mundt\u2019s argument assumes that the jurors could not tell the difference, but this assumption is not founded in law or fact.</p>\n<p id=\"b240-7\">{\u00b6 87} Moreover, trial counsel\u2019s hypothetical question was designed to ascertain whether any jurors would automatically impose a death sentence upon conviction simply because the crime was heinous, without considering the mitigating factors. Their avenue of learning this was to ask a question emphasizing the heinous nature of the crime. Hence, defense counsel made a strategic decision to phrase the question in this fashion. Mundt has demonstrated neither deficient performance nor prejudice and does not demonstrate ineffective assistance of counsel.</p>\n<p id=\"b240-8\">B. Ineffective Assistance During the Guilt Phase of the Trial</p>\n<p id=\"Amv\">{\u00b6 88} During the guilt phase of the trial, Mundt contends, his trial counsel rendered ineffective assistance by failing to object in several instances to allegedly inflammatory evidence and alleged prosecutorial misconduct.</p>\n<p id=\"b240-9\">1. Testimony about Victim\u2019s Personality Traits</p>\n<p id=\"Avv\">{\u00b6 89} First, Mundt complains about the testimony of Homer Blair, Brittany\u2019s school-bus driver, and Tim Bowman. Blair testified that Brittany \u201cwas a well-behaved girl\u201d who \u201cseemed * * * real bright [and] * * * friendly\u201d and \u201cloved to go to school.\u201d Bowman testified that Brittany was \u201ccheerful\u201d when he last saw her, adding, \u201cShe was always in a good mood.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b240-10\">{\u00b6 90} This testimony regarding Brittany\u2019s behavior was not part of the state\u2019s burden at trial. Counsel\u2019s failure to object to it, however, did not amount to deficient performance. \u201cA competent trial attorney might well eschew objecting * * * in order to minimize jury attention to the damaging material.\u201d <em>United States v. Payne </em>(C.A.7, 1984), 741 F.2d 887, 891. See also <em>Hodge v. Hurley </em>(C.A.6, 2005), 426 F.3d 368, 385-386; <em>State v. Miller </em>(1988), 44 Ohio App.3d 42, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"35\">*35</page-number>44, 541 N.E.2d 105; <em>State v. Tokar </em>(Mo.1996), 918 S.W.2d 753, 768. Defense counsel could have reasonably calculated that the testimony at issue would do little harm because seven-year-old Brittany would be a highly sympathetic victim in any event.</p>\n<p id=\"b241-4\">{\u00b6 91} Nor was the failure to object prejudicial. The testimony at issue was brief, and the jury was instructed in both phases of trial not to let any consideration of sympathy or prejudice sway its verdict. Hence, it is unlikely that the outcome of the trial would have been different had the testimony been excluded.</p>\n<p id=\"b241-5\">2. Crime-Scene Testimony</p>\n<p id=\"b241-6\">{\u00b6 92} Next, Mundt challenges the testimony of BCI agent Wilgus. Wilgus described the condition of Brittany\u2019s body at the crime scene, and he authenticated five crime-scene photographs depicting the body.</p>\n<p id=\"b241-7\">{\u00b6 93} Mundt appears to argue that Wilgus\u2019s testimony lacked relevance and was used solely for its alleged inflammatory effect. This argument lacks merit. Wilgus\u2019s testimony established the condition of Brittany\u2019s body at the scene and thus corroborated the coroner\u2019s subsequent testimony. Wilgus provided relevant and material testimony and counsel\u2019s failure to object to it neither constituted deficient performance nor caused prejudice.</p>\n<p id=\"b241-8\">3. Identification of Victim\u2019s Photograph by Mother</p>\n<p id=\"b241-9\">{\u00b6 94} Next, Mundt argues that his trial counsel should have filed a motion in limine to prevent Misty Hendrickson from identifying a predeath photograph of Brittany during her testimony. Mundt does not contest the admissibility of the photograph. See <em>State v. LaMar, </em>95 Ohio St.3d 181, 2002-Ohio-2128, 767 N.E.2d 166, \u00b6 57 (predeath photo of victim admissible). However, because Hendrickson wept when she identified Brittany\u2019s photo, Mundt argues that using Hendrickson to identify the photo caused him unfair prejudice.</p>\n<p id=\"b241-10\">{\u00b6 95} Nothing in Ohio law precludes a murder victim\u2019s relative from identifying photographs of the decedent. Hence, Mundt\u2019s counsel did not err by failing to file a motion to prevent Hendrickson from doing so.</p>\n<p id=\"b241-11\">{\u00b6 96} Moreover, the defense had opened the subject of Hendrickson\u2019s emotional reaction to the murder. Before Hendrickson testified, the defense had repeatedly elicited testimony on cross-examination about her unemotional demeanor after her daughter disappeared. Having made an issue of Hendrickson\u2019s lack of emotion \u2014 a strategic decision whose merits Mundt does not dispute \u2014 the defense was in a poor position to ask the trial court to shield the jury from Hendrickson\u2019s emotional reaction to her daughter\u2019s photo. Hence, we cannot fault Mundt\u2019s counsel for failing to make such a request.</p>\n<p id=\"b242-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"36\">*36</page-number>4. Failure to Challenge Pathologist\u2019s Qualifications</p>\n<p id=\"AL\">{\u00b6 97} Mundt also complains that defense counsel enhanced Dr. Murthy\u2019s credibility by not objecting to his qualifications as an expert. This claim is wholly speculative. Mundt does not explain how the mere lack of an objection enhanced the doctor\u2019s credibility.</p>\n<p id=\"b242-5\">{\u00b6 98} Nor does Mundt explain how his counsel <em>could </em>have objected to Dr. Murthy\u2019s qualifications. A practicing pathologist since 1966, Murthy had performed between 5,000 and 6,000 autopsies and had testified as an expert over 100 times. He had been a deputy coroner in Cuyahoga County for five years. When he testified at Mundt\u2019s trial, he was serving as chief deputy coroner for both Stark and Wayne Counties. He had worked almost 12 years for the Stark County coroner and about five years for the Wayne County coroner. In the face of these qualifications, an objection would not have been well taken. Hence, counsel\u2019s failure to object did not constitute deficient performance.</p>\n<p id=\"b242-6\">5. Alleged Prosecutorial Misconduct during Direct Examination</p>\n<p id=\"AI\">{\u00b6 99} Mundt next complains that his counsel failed to object to the prosecutor interjecting herself as a prop into the trial. This claim stems from three incidents during Murthy\u2019s direct examination.</p>\n<p id=\"b242-7\">{\u00b6 100} In explaining the nature of a bruise, Murthy said: \u201cFor example * * * if I hit your face \u2014 .\u201d The prosecutor interjected, \u201cYou can use me as your victim, if you want.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b242-8\">{\u00b6 101} Later, Murthy was explaining that a given amount of force will injure a smaller person more severely than a larger, stronger one. To illustrate this, he remarked that \u201cMike Tyson may not show this injury. But you take a delicate person <em>like you </em>and a small child, the same force will result in larger injury.\u201d (Emphasis added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b242-9\">{\u00b6 102} Finally, when Murthy testified that Brittany was 47 inches tall, the prosecutor said: \u201cI\u2019m * * * 58 inches. Would that make her about 47 inches?\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"AHAs\">{\u00b6 103} Mundt asserts, without citation to authority, that the prosecutor committed misconduct in these incidents, and he made no attempt to explain how the prosecutor\u2019s actions were either improper or prejudicial. Those actions did not deprive Mundt of a fair trial. See generally <em>State v. Jackson </em>(2001), 92 Ohio St.3d 436, 442, 751 N.E.2d 946 (test of prosecutorial misconduct is whether challenged action deprives defendant of a fair trial).</p>\n<p id=\"b242-10\">6. Testimony about Defensive Injuries</p>\n<p id=\"A7V\">{\u00b6 104} Next, Mundt suggests that his counsel should have objected to Murthy\u2019s testimony that Brittany had defensive injuries, because Murthy\u2019s report did not characterize any of Brittany\u2019s injuries as defensive. However, Murthy <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"37\">*37</page-number>was testifying about a matter he had personally observed, the condition of Brittany\u2019s body. No rule of law precludes a witness from testifying to his personal observations simply because that witness did not also incorporate those observations into a written report. Accordingly, Mundt\u2019s suggestion has no merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b243-4\">7. Testimony about Victim\u2019s Size</p>\n<p id=\"b243-5\">{\u00b6 105} Mundt argues that Dr. Murthy created prejudice against Mundt with testimony that \u201cjuxtapose[ed]\u201d Brittany\u2019s \u201cphysical attributes\u201d with Mundt\u2019s. Murthy testified that because Brittany was a frail, petite little girl with delicate skin, her injury was more prominent than when the same force was applied to a \u201cbig, husky, strong male with thick skin.\u201d When Murthy spoke of a \u201cbig, husky, strong male with thick skin,\u201d he was not referring to Mundt. He was comparing Brittany\u2019s injuries to those that a hypothetical adult victim would have suffered if struck with the same force used on Brittany.</p>\n<p id=\"b243-6\">{\u00b6 106} Murthy\u2019s references to Brittany\u2019s small size and frailty constituted relevant evidence because they explained the severity of her injuries. A defense objection would have been sustained only if the trial court found the probative value of these references to be \u201csubstantially outweighed by the danger of unfair prejudice, or confusion of the issues, or of misleading the jury.\u201d Evid.R. 403(A).</p>\n<p id=\"b243-7\">{\u00b6 107} It is speculative, at best, whether the trial court would have so found, since the balancing required by Evid.R. 403(A) is within the broad discretion of the trial court. See <em>State v. Rahman </em>(1986), 23 Ohio St.3d 146, 152, 23 OBR 315, 492 N.E.2d 401; <em>State v. Allen </em>(1995), 73 Ohio St.3d 626, 633, 653 N.E.2d 675. Accordingly, \u201ccounsel could rarely (if ever) be deemed ineffective for failing to object under Evid.R. 403(A).\u201d <em>State v. Bays </em>(1999), 87 Ohio St.3d 15, 28, 716 N.E.2d 1126. Accord <em>State v. Bethel, </em>110 Ohio St.3d 416, 2006-Ohio-4853, 854 N.E.2d 150, \u00b6 171.</p>\n<p id=\"b243-8\">{\u00b6 108} Here, even had counsel objected, the trial court could have admitted this testimony without abusing its discretion. Hence, we cannot say that a reasonable probability exists that the trial would have had a different outcome had counsel objected. Thus, counsel\u2019s failure to object was not prejudicial according to the <em>Strickland </em>standard.</p>\n<p id=\"b243-9\">{\u00b6 109} Mundt further contends that Murthy made an excessive number of references to Brittany\u2019s fragility and the severity of her injuries; consequently, he argues, unfair prejudice outweighed the probative value of Murthy\u2019s testimony. It is speculative at best how the trial court might have ruled on such an objection if it had been made. This contention is without merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b244-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"38\">*38</page-number>8. Allegedly Speculative Testimony</p>\n<p id=\"b244-4\">{\u00b6 110} Dr. Murthy also testified that, inasmuch as Brittany was 47 inches tall and the water in the well was only 36 inches deep, if she could have stood up, she would not have drowned. However, Murthy added, \u201cin view of the * * * multiple injuries, she may not have [had] enough strength to stand on her feet.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b244-5\">{\u00b6 111} Mundt contends that his counsel should have objected to this testimony as speculative. However, Murthy was not speculating; he was offering his expert opinion, based on his personal observation of Brittany\u2019s injuries during the autopsy. Inasmuch as this testimony is not speculative, that is not a proper basis for an objection.</p>\n<p id=\"b244-6\">{\u00b6 112} Mundt further contends that in discussing rigor mortis, Murthy \u201cspeculate^] as to the time of Brittany\u2019s death, a critical but missing part of the prosecution\u2019s case.\u201d Both parts of this contention are wrong. First, time of death was not critical to the state\u2019s case. Second, Murthy never gave an opinion as to time of death. He simply testified that rigor mortis had set in, and explained that its presence showed that Brittany had not been found soon after her death.</p>\n<p id=\"b244-7\">9. Testimony about Vaginal Injuries</p>\n<p id=\"b244-8\">{\u00b6 113} Dr. Bertin, a urologist, assisted in Brittany\u2019s autopsy and testified about her vaginal injuries. Mundt claims that his counsel should have objected to Bertin\u2019s testimony as inflammatory.</p>\n<p id=\"b244-9\">{\u00b6 114} Bertin described Brittany\u2019s vaginal opening as \u201cvery much enlarged,\u201d \u201cvery traumatized,\u201d \u201cimploded,\u201d \u201cdestroyed,\u201d and \u201cmacerated.\u201d He testified that it had been \u201cripped open\u201d by \u201csomething large forced through there with great force.\u201d He testified that Brittany\u2019s vaginal walls were \u201cvery abraded\u201d and had lacerations extending \u201cpractically the full length of the vaginal canal\u201d and \u201call the way through the side walls of the vagina\u201d on either side. He compared her injuries to \u201cforcing something too large into a paper sack where, as you push it in, the sides of the sack tear.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b244-10\">{\u00b6 115} Bertin\u2019s description of Brittany\u2019s vaginal injuries was clearly relevant. Thus, Mundt\u2019s trial counsel could have objected to this testimony only by invoking the trial court\u2019s broad discretion under Evid.R. 403(A). Again, it is at best speculative that the trial court would have excluded this highly relevant testimony under Evid.R. 403(A). Such speculation fails to establish a reasonable probability that the result of the trial would have been different had counsel objected.</p>\n<p id=\"b245-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"39\">*39</page-number>10. \u201cEditorial Comments\u201d by Witness</p>\n<p id=\"b245-5\">{\u00b6 116} Mundt next accuses Bertin of making \u201ceditorial comments\u201d during his testimony, and he claims his counsel should have objected. Again, Mundt simply does not explain what, if any, basis existed for a defense objection. All of the statements complained of are either straightforward descriptions of Brittany\u2019s injuries or expert opinions about the type and size of object that would have been needed to inflict such injuries.</p>\n<p id=\"b245-6\">11. Failure to Cross-Examine</p>\n<p id=\"b245-7\">{\u00b6 117} Mundt also complains that his trial counsel did not cross-examine Bertin. However, he does not show how cross-examination would have helped his case; nothing in the record suggests that Bertin\u2019s credibility was subject to any effective challenge.</p>\n<p id=\"b245-8\">12. Failure to Obtain Expert Assistance</p>\n<p id=\"b245-9\">{\u00b6 118} Mundt contends that his counsel were ineffective because they failed to obtain expert assistance to rebut the state\u2019s DNA evidence. But counsel\u2019s decision to rely on cross-examination instead of calling an expert witness does not constitute ineffective assistance. <em>State v. Nicholas </em>(1993), 66 Ohio St.3d 431, 436, 613 N.E.2d 225, citing <em>State v. Thompson </em>(1987), 33 Ohio St.3d 1, 10-11, 514 N.E.2d 407. Moreover, Mundt fails to show a reasonable likelihood that the outcome of the trial would have been different had his counsel obtained a DNA expert. Nothing in the record shows that a defense expert would have given favorable testimony. See <em>State v. Foust, </em>105 Ohio St.3d 137, 2004-Ohio-7006, 823 N.E.2d 836, \u00b6 97-98.</p>\n<p id=\"b245-10\">13. Alleged Prosecutorial Misconduct in Closing Argument</p>\n<p id=\"b245-11\">{\u00b6 119} Finally, Mundt contends that during the closing argument of the guilt phase of trial, the prosecutor committed misconduct by repeatedly describing Brittany\u2019s rape as brutal, and Mundt claims his trial counsel should have objected. The prosecutor\u2019s characterization of Brittany\u2019s rape as \u201cbrutal\u201d is fair comment. See <em>State v. Keene </em>(1998), 81 Ohio St.3d 646, 666, 693 N.E.2d 246. The remainder of the alleged misconduct consists of factual statements that were supported by the evidence. As there was \u201cno meritorious basis for any objections to these comments,\u201d defense counsel were not ineffective for failing to object. <em>State v. Tibbetts </em>(2001), 92 Ohio St.3d 146, 169, 749 N.E.2d 226.</p>\n<p id=\"b245-12\">C. Penalty Phase</p>\n<p id=\"b245-13\">{\u00b6 120} Mundt contends that he received ineffective assistance of counsel during the penalty phase of the trial when his counsel presented evidence and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"40\">*40</page-number>argument that damaged his mitigation case and when counsel failed to present available evidence that would have made a \u201ccompelling\u201d case for a life sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b246-4\">1. Penalty-Phase Evidence Contradicting Defense Guilt-Phase Theory</p>\n<p id=\"b246-5\">{\u00b6 121} During the guilt phase of the trial, defense counsel argued that Mundt, while guilty of rape, had not been proven guilty of kidnapping or murdering Brittany. The jury, however, rejected that argument and convicted Mundt of aggravated murder.</p>\n<p id=\"b246-6\">{\u00b6 122} Mundt\u2019s chief claim of ineffectiveness during the penalty phase is that his counsel presented testimony that contradicted their theory of the case during the guilt phase. Further, he claims counsel later compounded this error in closing argument by returning to their guilt-phase theory, which was inconsistent with the testimony of the penalty-phase witnesses.</p>\n<p id=\"b246-7\">{\u00b6 123} During the penalty phase, Mundt presented the testimony of Marsha Heiden, a psychologist and mitigation specialist, and Dr. Sandra McPherson, a psychologist. Heiden interviewed Mundt on several occasions, investigated his background, administered a psychological test, and wrote a report. McPherson also interviewed Mundt; administered, scored, and interpreted psychological tests; reviewed background material gathered by the defense; and arrived at a diagnosis of Mundt\u2019s mental condition.</p>\n<p id=\"b246-8\">{\u00b6 124} Heiden noted in her report, and admitted on cross-examination, that Mundt had changed his story. Initially, Mundt told Heiden a story consistent with his guilt-phase position that although he had raped Brittany, he had not taken her to the well or killed her. Mundt later changed his story, admitting to Heiden that he had put Brittany in the well after raping her, first claiming that he had thrown rocks at her, but later stating that he had placed rocks over the well opening and a rock fell on her, and that he acted alone.</p>\n<p id=\"b246-9\">{\u00b6 125} Mundt also gave differing accounts of the crime to Dr. McPherson. McPherson testified that at first, Mundt \u201cadmitted to having violated [Brittany] sexually.\u201d Mundt told McPherson that he became \u201cextremely frightened\u201d when she began bleeding, and he was going to take her to the hospital, but abandoned that plan because he was afraid of what would happen. Instead, he took her to the well, thinking \u201cthat he would leave her there until he figured out what to do.\u201d Later, however, Mundt told McPherson that Hendrickson was \u201cthe primary aggressor,\u201d that she had used a dildo on Brittany, and that Johnny had helped Mundt take the body to the well. McPherson testified: \u201cFred is not a good historian and tends to respond out of whatever is effective at the moment.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b246-10\">{\u00b6 126} Mundt argues that defense counsel rendered ineffective assistance by presenting the testimony of McPherson and Heiden because their testimony <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"41\">*41</page-number>revealed that, contrary to the guilt-phase defense theory, Mundt had indeed murdered Brittany.</p>\n<p id=\"b247-4\">{\u00b6 127} Mundt argues that McPherson and Heiden hurt his case in three ways: first, their testimony eliminated any doubt the jury may have retained as to the degree of Mundt\u2019s involvement in Brittany\u2019s murder, such as whether Mundt was the principal offender;<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> second, it sacrificed defense counsel\u2019s credibility, since counsel had argued Mundt\u2019s innocence in the guilt phase; third, it \u201cdemonized\u201d Mundt.</p>\n<p id=\"b247-5\">{\u00b6 128} In reality however, McPherson and Heiden also gave testimony that was potentially valuable as mitigation. McPherson diagnosed Mundt as having several psychological disorders, including borderline personality disorder. See <em>State v. Newton, </em>108 Ohio St.3d 13, 2006-0hio-81, 840 N.E.2d 593, \u00b6 120 (borderline personality disorder is a relevant mitigating factor). McPherson indicated that those disorders were caused by a factor (an unstable, abused childhood) beyond Mundt\u2019s control. Furthermore, she found a causal link between the disorders and the killing of Brittany.</p>\n<p id=\"b247-6\">{\u00b6 129} Mundt\u2019s admission to murdering Brittany was part of the information that formed a basis for McPherson\u2019s diagnosis. McPherson testified: \u201cI want to know what people think and what they feel in the course of a crime of this type.\u201d Mundt\u2019s statements were \u201cimportant\u201d because they illustrated the \u201cthinking process * * * characteristic of [Mundt] when he\u2019s under any kind of high arousal state.\u201d To McPherson, Mundt\u2019s thoughts during the crime exemplified \u201cpure borderline thinking\u201d and thus supported her diagnosis.</p>\n<p id=\"b247-7\">{\u00b6 130} Mundt\u2019s borderline thinking also supported McPherson\u2019s view that Mundt\u2019s disorder caused him to commit the murder. McPherson explained that Mundt engages in \u201cnarrow\u201d thinking under stress, focusing only on getting out of the stress-inducing situation. Hence, he tends to act upon \u201cwhatever first [comes] to mind,\u201d even though his course of action might not make sense. According to McPherson, Mundt became stressed when he realized he was in trouble for raping Brittany. The solution that \u201cfirst came to mind\u201d was to put her in the well, and Mundt\u2019s disorder caused him to focus on that course of action, without considering consequences or alternatives.</p>\n<p id=\"b247-8\">{\u00b6 131} Heiden presented Mundt\u2019s life history, which was potentially mitigating in itself, and which McPherson had used in diagnosing Mundt.</p>\n<p id=\"b247-9\">{\u00b6 132} Mundt\u2019s contention that the jury may have \u201charbored * * * doubt as to the level of Mundt\u2019s involvement\u201d amounts to speculation and is insufficient to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"42\">*42</page-number>show prejudice. Mundt\u2019s guilt-phase theory \u2014 that Mundt had raped Brittany, but that Hendrickson, Johnny Mundt, or someone else had kidnapped and murdered her \u2014 is implausible and unsupported by credible evidence. Thus, the testimony of McPherson and Heiden was not prejudicial according to the <em>Strickland </em>test, because it is not reasonably probable that the penalty-phase outcome would have been different if counsel had forgone their testimony.</p>\n<p id=\"b248-5\">{\u00b6 133} In a capital case, conceding guilt in the penalty phase can be a valid strategy, even when such a concession is inconsistent with the defense guilt-phase position. During the penalty phase, \u201cthe jury is not, as at the beginning of the guilt phase, disposed in [the defendant\u2019s] favor. Each juror believes beyond a reasonable doubt that [the defendant committed the murder]. * * * [D]espite what [the defendant] may wish it to believe, the jury, and therefore the law, thinks him guilty. * * * Recognizing a verdict of guilty at the penalty phase * * * was simply a sensible concession to the realities of the penalty proceeding in a capital case.\u201d <em>Brown v. Dixon </em>(C.A.4, 1989), 891 F.2d 490, 499.</p>\n<p id=\"b248-6\">{\u00b6 134} Moreover, it is not necessarily deficient performance for defense counsel to present inconsistent alternative theories to the jury. See generally <em>Brown v. Rice </em>(W.D.N.C.1988), 693 F.Supp. 381, 398, reversed in part on other grounds, <em>Brown v. Dixon </em>(C.A.4, 1989), 891 F.2d 490, 498-500; <em>State v. Losee </em>(Iowa 1984), 354 N.W.2d 239, 244; <em>Commonwealth v. Iglesias </em>(1998), 426 Mass. 574, 580, 689 N.E.2d 1315. Nor does a midtrial change in strategy necessarily constitute deficient performance. <em>Gabourie v. State </em>(App.1994), 125 Idaho 254, 260, 869 P.2d 571; <em>State v. Swavola </em>(App.1992), 114 N.M. 472, 476, 840 P.2d 1238.</p>\n<p id=\"b248-7\">{\u00b6 135} There were advantages, as well as disadvantages, to having Heiden and McPherson testify. Certainly, it would have been desirable for the defense to avoid contradicting its own guilt-phase theory if possible. But here, the defense could avoid such contradiction only by abandoning the significant favorable testimony that Heiden and McPherson had to offer. Defense counsel cannot be criticized for their presentation of testimony from Heiden and McPherson during the penalty phase of the trial and their conduct in doing so does not violate <em>Strickland.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b248-8\">{\u00b6 136} Mundt also contends that his counsel were ineffective because, in their penalty-phase argument, they returned to their earlier theory that Mundt may not have been the principal offender.</p>\n<p id=\"b248-9\">{\u00b6 137} In closing argument, they minimized the reliability and importance of Mundt\u2019s \u201cdifferent stories about what happened.\u201d Counsel argued that Mundt had grown up \u201cin a home where people lied,\u201d and hence should not be expected \u201cto tell the truth either to my experts or the State.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b248-10\">{\u00b6 138} Counsel then argued that in the guilt phase, the jury \u201chad a reasonable doubt * * * as to whether Fred Mundt was the principal offender in this case <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"43\">*43</page-number>* * * based on the evidence you heard at that time. And you can still have a reasonable doubt as to whether he was the principal offender, even after everything you\u2019ve heard here. * * * And you can consider that, that reasonable doubt that you had. So that\u2019s another mitigating factor.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b249-6\">{\u00b6 139} Even if counsel\u2019s tactical choice did constitute deficient performance, Mundt has not demonstrated that the outcome would have been different but for this argument. In view of the totality of the evidence, it seems improbable that this part of the defense argument changed any juror\u2019s opinion as to Mundt\u2019s guilt or McPherson\u2019s credibility. Hence, it is not likely that the outcome would have been otherwise but for counsel\u2019s inconsistent argument.</p>\n<p id=\"b249-7\">{\u00b6 140} Further, as we have already noted, presenting inconsistent alternative theories is not per se deficient performance. \u201cEven assuming the defenses were inconsistent, the decision to advance two different theories of non-culpability is a trial tactic or strategy. It is obvious that defendant\u2019s lawyers * * * were presenting any and all possible defenses. Whether the strategy was good or bad, it is a tactic that is not so unreasonable that it shows ineffectiveness.\u201d <em>Losee, </em>354 N.W.2d at 244.</p>\n<p id=\"b249-8\">{\u00b6 141} These observations have special relevance to the penalty phase of a capital murder case. In a capital case, the defense can win a life sentence by creating a reasonable doubt in the mind of only one juror, because the jury may recommend a death sentence only by a unanimous vote. See <em>State v. Springer </em>(1992), 63 Ohio St.3d 167, 586 N.E.2d 96. And each juror is entitled to consider any mitigating factors that he or she <em>individually </em>finds to have been established. See <em>McKoy v. North Carolina </em>(1990), 494 U.S. 433, 442-443, 110 S.Ct. 1227, 108 L.Ed.2d 369. Thus, it may well be a valid defense strategy to present any and all possible evidence and arguments in mitigation, even if they conflict, for evidence and arguments that 11 jurors reject may yet persuade the 12th.</p>\n<p id=\"b249-9\">{\u00b6 142} To be sure, such a strategy is not risk-free. It may not be the best strategy in every case. But every case is different, \u201cand an act or omission that is unprofessional in one case may be sound or even brilliant in another.\u201d <em>Strickland, </em>466 U.S. at 693, 104 S.Ct. 2052, 80 L.Ed.2d 674.</p>\n<p id=\"b249-10\">{\u00b6 143} Due to the nature of Mundt\u2019s crime, counsel could have rationally decided to offer the jury a variety of reasons to vote for life, hoping that at least one juror would accept at least one of those reasons. We cannot conclude, therefore, that this constituted ineffective assistance of counsel.</p>\n<p id=\"b249-11\">2. Presenting Harmful Testimony</p>\n<p id=\"b249-12\">{\u00b6 144} Mundt finds fault with Dr. McPherson\u2019s testimony in various ways. First, he argues that she prejudiced him by diagnosing him with pedophilia, based on the fact that he had been found guilty of having raped Brittany. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"44\">*44</page-number>However, inasmuch as Mundt never contested that he raped Brittany, it is not apparent how this diagnosis prejudiced him.</p>\n<p id=\"b250-5\">{\u00b6 145} Mundt contends that McPherson failed to explain what borderline personality disorder meant. This claim is untrue. McPherson explained borderline personality disorder at length, and she discussed its causes and symptoms with specific reference to Mundt. Mundt also contends that McPherson\u2019s testimony regarding Mundt\u2019s \u201cborderline thinking\u201d was \u201cnonsensical, inflammatory, unintelligible and clearly not mitigating.\u201d However, Mundt fails to explain these assertions and points to nothing in the record that supports them.</p>\n<p id=\"b250-6\">{\u00b6 146} Moreover, his citation of <em>Skaggs v. Parker </em>(C.A.6, 2000), 235 F.3d 261, in support of his argument is inapposite. In <em>Skaggs, </em>defense counsel were found to be ineffective for using a so-called psychologist in the penalty phase who had no license, degree, or training, but \u201chad completely falsified his credentials,\u201d 235 F.3d at 265, and who had previously given \u201cbizarre and eccentric\u201d guilt-phase testimony, id. at 269. In contrast, McPherson\u2019s qualifications are undisputed, and her testimony was material and relevant, not bizarre or eccentric.</p>\n<p id=\"b250-7\">{\u00b6 147} Mundt contends that McPherson \u201cdestroyed\u201d her own credibility by discussing the Minnesota Multiphasic Personality Inventory (\u201cMMPI-2\u201d), which Mundt had taken as part of the defense psychological evaluation. McPherson found that Mundt overstated responses on the MMPI-2. McPherson did not think the results were \u201cuseless,\u201d but thought that their value was \u201climited.\u201d Certain \u201caspects of [Mundt\u2019s MMPI-2 profile] could be interpreted, but only as hypotheses to be confirmed in other ways.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b250-8\">{\u00b6 148} McPherson did not rely heavily on the MMPI-2 in reaching her conclusions, and she forthrightly acknowledged its limited value. Thus, it is unclear how testifying about it undermined her credibility.</p>\n<p id=\"b250-9\">3. Failure to Present Available Mitigation</p>\n<p id=\"b250-10\">{\u00b6 149} Before trial, defense counsel filed a motion to declare Mundt mentally retarded and therefore ineligible for the death penalty pursuant to <em>Atkins v. Virginia </em>(2002), 536 U.S. 304, 122 S.Ct. 2242, 153 L.Ed.2d 335, and <em>State v. Lott, </em>97 Ohio St.3d 303, 2002-Ohio-6625, 779 N.E.2d 1011. Witnesses at the <em>Atkins </em>hearing included Robert Willis and Constance Kline Brady, Ph.D., testifying for the defense, and Jeffrey Stevens, testifying for the state.</p>\n<p id=\"b250-11\">{\u00b6 150} Willis was the special-education supervisor for the Switzerland of Ohio School District. Dr. Brady was a school psychologist who examined students to determine whether they have learning disabilities. Willis and Brady based their testimony on Mundt\u2019s school records. Stevens was the vocational special-educational coordinator at Mundt\u2019s high school. It was his job to assist learning-disabled (\u201cLD\u201d) and developmentally handicapped (\u201cDH\u201d) students with their <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"45\">*45</page-number>studies. His testimony was based on personal knowledge of Mundt, as well as Mundt\u2019s records.</p>\n<p id=\"b251-4\">{\u00b6 151} Brady testified that, at age 12, when Mundt attended school in the Marietta school district, his IQ scores were 82 and 85, consistent with a learning disability. The Marietta schools had classified Mundt as LD. However, when he later attended high school in the Switzerland of Ohio school district, he was classified as DH. Brady and Willis testified that at the time Mundt was classified as a DH student, an IQ measurement of 80 or less was one of the prerequisites for that designation.</p>\n<p id=\"b251-5\">{\u00b6 152} Stevens testified that Mundt had studied cosmetology in a vocational program. Although Mundt had struggled academically as a DH student, he had performed tasks to the best of his ability. In a 1995 evaluation, Stevens had rated Mundt\u2019s daily attendance as good.</p>\n<p id=\"b251-6\">{\u00b6 153} Brady testified that when Mundt was 15, he could read at only a second-grade level. Stevens testified that, as a junior and senior, Mundt read at only a second-grade level and had difficulty with written instructions. It was necessary to speak slowly and clearly to Mundt and to repeat until he understood. Mundt did not retain information well and had a short attention span. Despite receiving special help, he was barely able to keep up with his cosmetology class. He needed extra time to complete most tasks and worked slowly, but persistently-</p>\n<p id=\"b251-7\">{\u00b6 154} Stevens and Willis testified that Mundt had received several \u201cE\u201d grades in high school. Stevens, Willis, and Brady explained that an \u201cE\u201d was a grade given in place of an \u201cF\u201d to a special-education student who had failed to earn a passing grade but had put forth reasonably good effort and done his best.</p>\n<p id=\"b251-8\">{\u00b6 155} Mundt contends that in the mitigation hearing, defense counsel should have called Willis, Brady, and Stevens (\u201cthe <em>Atkins </em>witnesses\u201d) to testify about his academic history and low intelligence. Mundt contends that his low intelligence would have had significant mitigating value. Moreover, he argues, such testimony would have humanized him by showing him as a struggling special-education student who worked hard and tried to achieve despite limited intellectual capability.</p>\n<p id=\"b251-9\">{\u00b6 156} In general, \u201ccounsel\u2019s decision whether to call a witness falls within the rubric of trial strategy and will not be second-guessed by a reviewing court.\u201d <em>State v. Treesh </em>(2001), 90 Ohio St.3d 460, 490, 739 N.E.2d 749. See also <em>State v. Hanna, </em>95 Ohio St.3d 285, 2002-Ohio-2221, 767 N.E.2d 678, \u00b6 118; <em>State v. Williams, </em>99 Ohio St.3d 493, 2003-Ohio-4396, 794 N.E.2d 27, \u00b6 125. \u201cIt may be that often the best strategy in a capital case is to attempt to humanize the defendant by presenting evidence of his personal qualities. We are unable to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"46\">*46</page-number>hold, however, that any other strategy would be so unreasonable as to constitute ineffective assistance of counsel.\u201d <em>Stanley v. Zant </em>(C.A.11, 1983), 697 F.2d 955.</p>\n<p id=\"b252-4\">{\u00b6 157} Moreover, in evaluating the performance of counsel, \u201cstrategic choices made after thorough investigation of law and facts relevant to plausible options are virtually unchallengeable; and strategic choices made after less than complete investigation are reasonable precisely to the extent that reasonable professional judgments support the limitations on investigation.\u201d <em>Strickland, </em>466 U.S. at 690-691, 104 S.Ct. 2052, 80 L.Ed.2d 674.</p>\n<p id=\"b252-5\">{\u00b6 158} Here, the record shows that counsel\u2019s decision not to call the <em>Atkins </em>witnesses in the penalty phase did not result from any lack of investigation. Cf. <em>State v. Tyler </em>(1990), 50 Ohio St.3d 24, 40, 553 N.E.2d 576. Mundt\u2019s lawyers knew the <em>Atkins </em>witnesses existed and what their testimony would be. They had already presented <em>that very testimony </em>at the <em>Atkins </em>hearing. Because Mundt\u2019s counsel were fully aware of what these witnesses had to say, counsel\u2019s decision not to present them in the penalty phase is \u201cvirtually unchallengeable.\u201d <em>Strickland, </em>466 U.S. at 690, 104 S.Ct. 2052, 80 L.Ed.2d 674.</p>\n<p id=\"b252-6\">{\u00b6 159} Moreover, Mundt fails to demonstrate prejudice, i.e., a reasonable likelihood that the outcome of the case would have been otherwise but for the allegedly ineffective assistance. Mundt\u2019s contention that being depicted as a struggling special-education student would have humanized him is rank speculation. Mundt\u2019s claim that the jury would have found this evidence compelling is equally speculative.</p>\n<p id=\"b252-7\">{\u00b6 160} Finally, even without the <em>Atkins </em>witnesses, evidence of Mundt\u2019s low intelligence was placed before the jury in the penalty phase. Mundt\u2019s school records showed that his IQ ranged between 78 and 85, as measured by StanfordBinet and Wechsler Intelligence Scale for Children tests administered during childhood. Dr. McPherson testified that Mundt\u2019s intelligence, as reflected by intelligence test scores, was below average; that he had difficulty in school, especially with reading, memory, and attention; that he had been placed in a \u201cdevelopmentally handicapped section\u201d and had been diagnosed with attention-deficit disorder; and that his \u201climited\u201d intellectual resources contributed to his tendency to avoid problems instead of trying to solve them.</p>\n<p id=\"b252-8\">{\u00b6 161} At most, the <em>Atkins </em>witnesses would have corroborated the other evidence of Mundt\u2019s low intelligence and emphasized its mitigating value. However, there is no reason to assume that the jury would have given Mundt\u2019s low intelligence decisive weight if the <em>Atkins </em>witnesses had testified. Indeed, juries often recommend death sentences despite a defendant\u2019s low intelligence. See, e.g., <em>State v. Drummond, </em>111 Ohio St.3d 14, 2006-Ohio-5084, 854 N.E.2d 1038, \u00b6 264; <em>State v. Craig, </em>110 Ohio St.3d 306, 2006-Ohio-4571, 853 N.E.2d 621, \u00b6 139; <em>State v. Lynch, </em>98 Ohio St.3d 514, 2003-Ohio-2284, 787 N.E.2d 1185, \u00b6 109; <em>State </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"47\">*47</page-number><em>v. Rojas </em>(1992), 64 Ohio St.3d 131, 143, 592 N.E.2d 1376. Thus, no evidence exists that the testimony of the <em>Atkins </em>witnesses would have changed the outcome of the penalty phase.</p>\n<p id=\"b253-4\">{\u00b6 162} Mundt also contends that defense counsel\u2019s argument failed to lay sufficient emphasis on Mundt\u2019s lack of a significant criminal record. However, defense counsel did discuss this mitigating factor in the defense opening statement, and in closing argument as well. The degree of emphasis to be given any individual mitigating factor in argument is a matter of trial strategy, and Mundt fails to demonstrate deficient performance.</p>\n<p id=\"b253-5\">{\u00b6 163} After thorough review, we conclude that Mundt failed to demonstrate that his counsel rendered ineffective assistance during voir dire, during the guilt phase, or during the penalty phase of the trial. Accordingly, we overrule the first proposition of law.</p>\n<p id=\"b253-6\">II. Waived Issues</p>\n<p id=\"A-q\">A. Voir Dire</p>\n<p id=\"b253-7\">{\u00b6 164} In the second proposition of law, Mundt claims that the <em>trial court </em>faded to conduct a sufficient voir dire of prospective juror Watson. Mundt contends that the trial court had a duty to question Watson concerning whether she would automatically vote for a death sentence, even though Mundt\u2019s counsel chose not to ask such questions.</p>\n<p id=\"b253-8\">{\u00b6 165} No such duty exists. \u201cThere is no requirement for a trial court to \u2018life qualify\u2019 any prospective juror, absent a request by defense counsel, in a capital murder case.\u201d <em>State v. Stojetz </em>(1999), 84 Ohio St.3d 452, 705 N.E.2d 329, syllabus. Rather, the trial court must inquire into the prospective juror\u2019s views, or else allow defense counsel to do so, <em>if the defendant so requests. </em>See <em>Morgan v. Illinois </em>(1992), 504 U.S. 719, 735-736, 112 S.Ct. 2222, 119 L.Ed.2d 492.</p>\n<p id=\"b253-9\">{\u00b6 166} <em>State v. Jackson, </em>107 Ohio St.3d 53, 2005-Ohio-5981, 836 N.E.2d 1173, is not to the contrary, and Mundt\u2019s citation to that case is inapposite. <em>Jackson </em>neither holds nor implies that a trial court must conduct a <em>Morgan </em>inquiry sua sponte. Rather, <em>Jackson </em>involved an improper restriction on the scope of defense voir dire: \u201cThe trial court erred when it held that appellant was not entitled to have prospective jurors informed that one of the murder victims was three years old.\u201d Id. at \u00b6 49.</p>\n<p id=\"b253-10\">{\u00b6 167} Here, the trial court imposed no restriction on defense questioning. The defense <em>chose </em>not to question Watson. Since the trial court had no duty to conduct a <em>Morgan </em>inquiry sua sponte, we reject Mundt\u2019s second proposition of law.</p>\n<p id=\"b254-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"48\">*48</page-number>B. Prosecutorial Misconduct</p>\n<p id=\"b254-5\">{\u00b6 168} In his third proposition of law, Mundt contends that the prosecutors committed numerous acts of misconduct that denied him a fair trial in both phases.</p>\n<p id=\"b254-6\">{\u00b6 169} Mundt never objected to any of the alleged prosecutorial misconduct. Thus, he waived his right to claim error. In order to overcome the waiver, a complaining party must demonstrate plain error. An alleged error is plain error only if the error is \u201cobvious,\u201d <em>State v. Barnes </em>(2002), 94 Ohio St.3d 21, 27, 759 N.E.2d 1240, and \u201cbut for the error, the outcome of the trial clearly would have been otherwise,\u201d <em>State v. Long </em>(1978), 53 Ohio St.2d 91, 7 O.O.3d 178, 372 N.E.2d 804, paragraph two of the syllabus. Under this standard, Mundt has not demonstrated plain error with respect to these issues. Therefore, Mundt\u2019s third proposition of law is overruled.</p>\n<p id=\"b254-7\">C. Evidentiary Issues</p>\n<p id=\"b254-8\">{\u00b6 170} In his fourth proposition of law, Mundt contends that the admission of victim-impact evidence in the guilt phase violated his constitutional rights. The record reveals that at trial, the defense did not object to any of the evidence at issue here. These claims are thus waived unless Mundt demonstrates plain error. He has not done so, and, therefore, Mundt\u2019s fourth proposition of law is overruled.</p>\n<p id=\"b254-9\">{\u00b6 171} In his sixth proposition of law, Mundt contends that the testimony regarding the injuries inflicted on Brittany should have been excluded as inflammatory and repetitive. Again, Mundt did not object to this evidence at trial, so this proposition is waived. The admission of the evidence in question does not amount to plain error. We overrule Mundt\u2019s sixth proposition of law.</p>\n<p id=\"b254-10\">D. Guilt-Phase Instructions</p>\n<p id=\"b254-11\">{\u00b6 172} In his seventh proposition of law, Mundt contends that the trial court\u2019s instruction on Count 7 (kidnapping) was flawed. The trial court instructed: \u201cIf you find the Defendant guilty of kidnapping * * *, you will further consider whether the Defendant did or did not release the victim in a safe place, unharmed.\u201d See R.C. 2905.01(C) (release of victim unharmed in a safe place reduces kidnapping from first-degree felony to second-degree felony).</p>\n<p id=\"b254-12\">{\u00b6 173} The trial court did not need to give this instruction, as Mundt never raised the issue of whether the victim was released unharmed in a safe place. See <em>State v. Sanders </em>(2001), 92 Ohio St.3d 245, 265, 750 N.E.2d 90. However, Mundt did not object to it at trial. Hence, he has waived this issue, unless he can show plain error. His assertion that the instruction prejudiced him is speculative. See id. at 265, 750 N.E.2d 90; <em>State v. McKnight, </em>107 Ohio St.3d 101, 2005-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"49\">*49</page-number>Ohio-6046, 837 N.E.2d 315, \u00b6 234. Further, he has not demonstrated that the outcome of the trial clearly would have been otherwise but for the error. Therefore, we overrule this proposition of law.</p>\n<p id=\"b255-6\">{\u00b6 174} In the eighth proposition of law, Mundt contends that the trial court\u2019s instruction on causation<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> shifted the burden of proof on the issue of purpose to kill. Mundt did not object to this instruction at trial. The issue is therefore waived, absent plain error.</p>\n<p id=\"b255-7\">{\u00b6 175} Plain error does not exist here. The trial court instructed the jury that it must find purpose to kill in order to convict Mundt of aggravated murder. <em>State v. Phillips </em>(1995), 74 Ohio St.3d 72, 100, 656 N.E.2d 643. See also <em>Byrd v. Collins </em>(C.A.6, 2000), 209 F.3d 486, 527. This proposition of law is not well taken.</p>\n<p id=\"b255-8\">E. Penalty-Phase Instructions</p>\n<p id=\"b255-9\">{\u00b6 176} In his fifth proposition of law, Mundt contends that the trial court erred in the penalty phase by instructing that although counsel\u2019s arguments were not evidence, the jury could \u201cconsider the arguments of counsel to the extent that they [were] relevant to the sentence that should be imposed.\u201d Mundt claims that this instruction allowed the jurors to give \u201cundue consideration\u201d to the state\u2019s argument.</p>\n<p id=\"b255-10\">{\u00b6 177} However, Mundt did not object at trial, waiving the issue absent plain error. The instruction was not plain error. It was neutral as between prosecution and defense, and Mundt does not explain how it could cause the jurors to give <em>undue </em>consideration to the prosecutor\u2019s argument.</p>\n<p id=\"b255-11\">{\u00b6 178} Mundt\u2019s failure to object waives this claim, and as there is no plain error, we overrule this proposition of law.</p>\n<p id=\"b255-12\">{\u00b6 179} In his tenth proposition of law, Mundt argues that the trial court erred in the penalty phase by instructing the jury to consider guilt-phase evidence only if \u201crelevant to the aggravating circumstances and to any of the mitigating factors.\u201d See <em>State v. Getsy </em>(1998), 84 Ohio St.3d 180, 201, 702 N.E.2d 866 (it is trial judge\u2019s duty to determine what evidence is relevant in penalty phase).</p>\n<p id=\"b255-13\">{\u00b6 180} But, again, Mundt did not preserve this claim at trial, either by objecting to the instruction or by seeking the exclusion of any allegedly irrelevant evidence. \u201cThus, he has waived any objection relating to the relevance of specific items,\u201d <em>State v. Cowans </em>(1999), 87 Ohio St.3d 68, 87, 717 N.E.2d 298, and cannot prevail unless he shows plain error. He has not.</p>\n<p id=\"b255-14\">{\u00b6 181} Plain error does not exist here because the alleged error did not cause the jury to consider any <em>irrelevant </em>guilt-phase evidence in the penalty phase. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"50\">*50</page-number>The guilt-phase evidence that Mundt identifies as irrelevant was Agent Wilgus\u2019s testimony about the condition of Brittany\u2019s body at the crime scene and Murthy\u2019s testimony about the severity of Brittany\u2019s injuries. However, this evidence was relevant to the nature and circumstances of the aggravating circumstances, which the jury <em>must </em>consider in the penalty phase. R.C. 2929.03(D)(1). See <em>State v. DePew </em>(1988), 38 Ohio St.3d 275, 282-283, 528 N.E.2d 542.</p>\n<p id=\"b256-5\">{\u00b6 182} Because the testimony of Wilgus and Murthy was relevant to the penalty phase, the jury would have considered it even had the trial judge issued a more specific instruction. Hence, the alleged instructional error was not outcome-determinative, and no plain error occurred. See <em>State v. Lindsey </em>(2000), 87 Ohio St.3d 479, 485, 721 N.E.2d 995; <em>State v. Fears </em>(1999), 86 Ohio St.3d 329, 345-346, 715 N.E.2d 136. We overrule Mundt\u2019s tenth proposition.</p>\n<p id=\"b256-6\">III. Constitutionality of Death Penalty</p>\n<p id=\"b256-7\">{\u00b6 183} In his 11th proposition of law, Mundt raises long-settled issues attacking the constitutionality of Ohio\u2019s death-penalty statutes. We overrule these claims summarily. See generally <em>State v. Spisak </em>(1988), 36 Ohio St.3d 80, 82, 521 N.E.2d 800; <em>State v. Poindexter </em>(1988), 36 Ohio St.3d 1, 520 N.E.2d 568, syllabus.</p>\n<p id=\"b256-8\">IV. Independent Sentence Review</p>\n<p id=\"b256-9\">{\u00b6 184} In his ninth proposition of law, Mundt contends that death is not the appropriate sentence in this case. This proposition invokes our statutorily mandated independent review.</p>\n<p id=\"b256-10\">Aggravating Circumstances</p>\n<p id=\"b256-11\">{\u00b6 185} After the trial court\u2019s merger of specifications, two aggravating circumstances remain: R.C. 2929.04(A)(3) (murder to escape detection, apprehension, trial, or punishment) and R.C. 2929.04(A)(7) (murder while committing kidnapping). The record supports the jury\u2019s finding of these aggravating circumstances.</p>\n<p id=\"b256-12\">Mitigating Factors</p>\n<p id=\"b256-13\">{\u00b6 186} Mundt cites his history, character, background, low intelligence, and mental disorders as mitigating. He also claims that he has no significant criminal history, a mitigating factor under R.C. 2929.04(B)(5). Finally, he contends that his good behavior in jail, his lack of future dangerousness while imprisoned, and his remorse are mitigating \u201cother factors\u201d under the catchall provision of R.C. 2929.04(B)(7). At trial, he also claimed his youth was a mitigating factor under R.C. 2929.04(B)(4).</p>\n<p id=\"b257-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"51\">*51</page-number>{\u00b6 187} The record demonstrates that Mundt was a special-education student, and that the Marietta school system classified him as learning-disabled. By 1989, when he was attending school in the Switzerland of Ohio district, Mundt had been reevaluated as developmentally handicapped. IQ tests administered during his scholastic career indicate that his intellectual functioning was \u201cborderline.\u201d However, he attended school and earned several grades of \u201cE,\u201d meaning that he put forth his best effort but did not qualify for a passing grade.</p>\n<p id=\"b257-4\">{\u00b6 188} In 1995, Mundt applied for Social Security disability payments, claiming to be mentally retarded. After he took a Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale (\u201cWAIS\u201d) examination, his application was granted. The 1995 WAIS indicated an IQ of 49. Mundt\u2019s benefits were terminated in 2002, when his work income exceeded the allowable amount, but were reinstated in 2004.</p>\n<p id=\"b257-5\">{\u00b6 189} Dr. David Ott, the state\u2019s expert witness in psychology, interviewed Mundt before trial. In the penalty phase, Dr. Ott testified that his observations of Mundt were \u201cvery inconsistent with\u201d an IQ of 49 and indicated a much higher level of functioning than others in that range. According to Dr. Ott, a person with a 49 IQ would need 24-hour supervision. Moreover, Mundt\u2019s IQ ranged between 78 and 85 when measured by IQ tests administered in childhood. Ott concluded that Mundt had \u201cintentionally underperformed\u201d on the WAIS in order to get disability payments.</p>\n<p id=\"b257-6\">{\u00b6 190} Mundt\u2019s low intelligence and the efforts that he made in high school despite that handicap are mitigating factors under R.C. 2929.04(B)(7). See, e.g., <em>State v. Green </em>(1993), 66 Ohio St.3d 141, 153, 609 N.E.2d 1253. However, their mitigating value is affected by Mundt\u2019s malingering on IQ tests as an adult, in order to obtain disability benefits.</p>\n<p id=\"b257-7\">{\u00b6 191} Mundt contends that his childhood was one of \u201cchaos, abuse, and neglect,\u201d which caused him to suffer from borderline personality disorder.</p>\n<p id=\"b257-8\">{\u00b6 192} The evidence confirms that Mundt had an unstable childhood. His mother, Sarah Mundt, had children by four different fathers, and seven of her eight children were born out of wedlock. The family moved frequently during his childhood. In 1975, a children\u2019s protective agency removed Mundt from Sarah Mundt\u2019s custody for approximately one month. In 1979 or 1980, Sarah voluntarily surrendered custody of her children because she had no home.</p>\n<p id=\"b257-9\">{\u00b6 193} During his childhood, children\u2019s services agencies investigated numerous reports of abuse and neglect in Sarah Mundt\u2019s household. However, some of these reports were unsubstantiated.</p>\n<p id=\"b257-10\">{\u00b6 194} Dr. Ali Melhem, a psychiatrist, testified that he treated Mundt from December 2003 to February 2004. Melhem initially suspected bipolar disorder <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"52\">*52</page-number>and intermittent explosive disorder, but ultimately diagnosed Mundt as having bipolar disorder.</p>\n<p id=\"b258-4\">{\u00b6 195} Mundt also presented evidence that he suffered from borderline personality disorder. Dr. McPherson interviewed Mundt, tested him, discussed his background with the mitigation specialist, and reviewed his Social Security, school, mental-health, and children\u2019s services records.</p>\n<p id=\"b258-5\">{\u00b6 196} Dr. McPherson gave Mundt the MMPI-2 test, the Rorschach test, and the Thematic Apperception Test (\u201cTAT\u201d). McPherson found that Mundt overstated his responses on the MMPI-2. Nevertheless, McPherson felt that the MMPI-2 results \u201cwere not useless.\u201d Some features of the MMPI-2 were consistent with aspects of his life history, such as childhood abuse, drug use, and depression.</p>\n<p id=\"b258-6\">{\u00b6 197} McPherson\u2019s examination of Mundt led her to conclude that \u201cunder threat, he tends to deal with the world by narrowing perception,\u201d i.e., by refusing to be aware of problems. Thus, \u201c[w]hen a problem presents itself, he\u2019s mainly going to look for a way to get away from it, rather than a way to deal with it.\u201d Mundt\u2019s low intelligence also contributes to this tendency.</p>\n<p id=\"b258-7\">{\u00b6 198} Moreover, Mundt \u201cdoesn\u2019t process emotion\u201d and lacks a normal capacity to identify with another person\u2019s pain. He tends to \u201cblam[e] the world\u201d for his problems \u201cas opposed to looking within.\u201d He has a \u201cnegative self concept\u201d and is not goal-oriented.</p>\n<p id=\"b258-8\">{\u00b6 199} According to Dr. McPherson, narrow perception, low capacity for emotional response, and externalizing blame are characteristic qualities of persons who have been traumatized or suffered early abuse.</p>\n<p id=\"b258-9\">{\u00b6 200} Dr. McPherson diagnosed Mundt as having depression, posttraumatic stress disorder, pedophilia, and borderline personality disorder. McPherson noted that bipolar disorder and borderline disorder \u201coverlap substantially,\u201d and she was not \u201cin substantial disagreement\u201d with Dr. Melhem\u2019s diagnosis of bipolar disorder. However, Mundt was not psychotic or schizophrenic; in fact, he had no major mental illness.</p>\n<p id=\"b258-10\">{\u00b6 201} Mundt told McPherson that during the crime, he had thought about \u201chimself getting messed with\u201d as a child and thought \u201cit might be okay\u201d if he \u201cmessed with\u201d Brittany. According to McPherson, this was \u201cpure borderline thinking,\u201d illustrating \u201ca confusion of identity\u201d and the \u201cnotion that somehow this reduces responsibility.\u201d McPherson believed that when confronted with an upsetting situation, Mundt simply does whatever first comes to mind, whether it makes sense or not, and that he did so in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b258-11\">{\u00b6 202} According to Dr. Ott, Mundt\u2019s malingering invalidated the MMPI-2 results. Dr. Ott also questioned the validity of the TAT results. In Dr. Ott\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"53\">*53</page-number>view, Mundt\u2019s responses to the TAT were consistent with his pattern of \u201cimpression management.\u201d Ott also testified that the TAT itself is \u201ccontroversial,\u201d particularly for courtroom use, because no norms for interpreting responses exist, allowing for \u201cconsiderable subjectivity\u201d on the part of the examiner.</p>\n<p id=\"b259-5\">{\u00b6 203} Mundt\u2019s history, character, and background evidence depicts a person who, because of factors beyond his control \u2014 an unstable home, alleged childhood abuse and neglect, a personality disorder, and low intelligence \u2014 lacks the ability to empathize with others or to deal appropriately with a situation.</p>\n<p id=\"b259-6\">{\u00b6 204} While there is evidence that supports this picture, the record also contains evidence that tends to refute it. Dr. McPherson admitted that Mundt had overstated his psychological symptoms and that his word was unreliable. Ott testified that two tests McPherson had used to reach her diagnosis were of questionable validity because of Mundt\u2019s malingering and because one of them (the TAT) is interpreted subjectively.</p>\n<p id=\"b259-7\">{\u00b6 205} We accord little weight to Mundt\u2019s personality disorders as a mitigating \u201cother factor.\u201d See <em>State v. Taylor </em>(1997), 78 Ohio St.3d 15, 33, 676 N.E.2d 82. Furthermore, Mundt\u2019s upbringing is entitled to little weight in mitigation. Cf. <em>State v. Murphy </em>(2001), 91 Ohio St.3d 516, 547, 747 N.E.2d 765; <em>State v. Campbell </em>(2002), 95 Ohio St.3d 48, 51-54, 765 N.E.2d 334.</p>\n<p id=\"b259-8\">{\u00b6 206} This court recently reversed a death sentence largely on the basis of the defendant\u2019s upbringing. See <em>State v. Tenace, </em>109 Ohio St.3d 255, 2006-Ohio-2417, 847 N.E.2d 386. <em>Tenace, </em>however, is distinguishable. Tenace\u2019s parents lived criminal lifestyles and actively encouraged the defendant and his siblings to commit crimes. Id. at \u00b6 88-90, 96, 101-103. The record in this case presents nothing comparable to <em>Tenace. </em>Moreover, Mundt\u2019s siblings overcame their upbringing; at least two were employed, and all but Johnny were law-abiding. This was not the case in <em>Tenace. </em>See id. at \u00b6 82, 96, 102.</p>\n<p id=\"b259-9\">{\u00b6 207} Mundt contends that he lacks a \u201csignificant history of criminal convictions,\u201d R.C. 2929.04(B)(5), and the state concedes the existence of this mitigating factor. However, Mundt has a prior misdemeanor conviction for domestic violence against his first wife, Dana Anderson, for which he served a 30-day sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b259-10\">{\u00b6 208} This factor of lack of criminal history is entitled to little weight. Mundt\u2019s prior conviction was for domestic violence, and the instant case also involves violence against a member of Mundt\u2019s household. Moreover, Dr. McPherson testified that Mundt \u201cis dangerous * * * in a domestic context because * * * he will do something stupid and something terrible at times.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b259-11\">{\u00b6 209} McPherson testified that, although Mundt had committed crimes in a domestic context, he would probably not engage in aggression if incarcerated. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"54\">*54</page-number>This is evidence in mitigation that we consider, for \u201cevidence that the defendant would not pose a danger if spared (but incarcerated) must be considered potentially mitigating.\u201d <em>Skipper v. South Carolina </em>(1986), 476 U.S. 1, 5, 106 S.Ct. 1669, 90 L.Ed.2d 1.</p>\n<p id=\"b260-4\">{\u00b6 210} Mundt claims that his good behavior in jail is a mitigating factor. Good behavior in jail is relevant to lack of future dangerousness: \u201c[T]he lack of a prison disciplinary record reveals nothing about a defendant\u2019s character except that the defendant can exist in the highly structured environment of a prison without endangering others.\u201d <em>Franklin v. Lynaugh </em>(1988), 487 U.S. 164, 186, 108 S.Ct. 2320, 101 L.Ed.2d 155 (O\u2019Connor, J., concurring). See also <em>Skipper, </em>476 U.S. at 5, 106 S.Ct. 1669, 90 L.Ed.2d 1.</p>\n<p id=\"b260-5\">{\u00b6 211} According to the Noble County jail administrator, Mundt created no disciplinary problems during almost nine months of pretrial incarceration. However, during this entire period, Mundt was assigned to a room visible to guards at all times. He had no contact with any inmate except trusties, and no unsupervised contact with any inmate. Mundt\u2019s good behavior under these circumstances is given little weight.</p>\n<p id=\"b260-6\">{\u00b6 212} Mundt expressed remorse in his unsworn statement and in allocution. In the unsworn statement, he told the jury he was \u201cvery sorry * * *. I know I was wrong and I ask you to spare my life.\u201d In allocution, he said: \u201cI am sorry for what I did wrong. I\u2019m very, very sorry for Misty\u2019s family. I wish it had never happened. * * * I\u2019m just very sorry for what I done.\u201d These expressions of remorse deserve little weight. See <em>State v. Hoffner, </em>102 Ohio St.3d 358, 2004-Ohio-3430, 811 N.E.2d 48, \u00b6 119; <em>State v. Post </em>(1987), 32 Ohio St.3d 380, 394, 513 N.E.2d 754.</p>\n<p id=\"b260-7\">{\u00b6 213} At trial, Mundt argued that there was doubt as to whether he was the principal offender in the murder. <em>\u201cIf the offender was * </em>* * <em>not the principal offender, </em>the degree of the offender\u2019s participation in the offense and * * * in the acts that led to the death of the victim\u201d must be considered in mitigation. (Emphasis added.) R.C. 2929.04(B)(6). However, overwhelming evidence shows that Mundt <em>was </em>the principal offender; indeed, no substantial, credible evidence suggests that anyone else was involved. This factor deserves no weight in mitigation.</p>\n<p id=\"b260-8\">{\u00b6 214} During the penalty phase, Mundt requested that the jury be instructed on his youth, R.C. 2929.04(B)(4), as a mitigating factor. However, because Mundt was 29 years old at the time of the offense, R.C. 2929.04(B)(4) does not apply.</p>\n<p id=\"b260-9\">Proportionality Review</p>\n<p id=\"b260-10\">{\u00b6 215} Mundt\u2019s death sentence is proportionate to sentences we have approved in similar cases.
