Chapter 4112. In light of the full range of remedies provided in R.C. Chapter 4112, we hold that there is no such public policy tort.</p>\n<p id=\"b517-14\">Background</p>\n<p id=\"b517-15\">{\u00b6 2} Appellee, Marlene Leininger, filed a complaint against appellants, Pioneer National Latex, Jerry Meyer, and Melissa McCormic, alleging a single cause of action for wrongful termination of her employment in violation of Ohio\u2019s public policy against age discrimination as found in R.C. 4112.02(A). In May 2001, Leininger was fired at the age of 60, after having been employed as a human resources administrator with Pioneer and its predecessor for 19 years. Meyer, Leininger\u2019s immediate supervisor, participated in the decision to discharge her. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"312\">*312</page-number>McCormic was the 21-year-old to whom some of Leininger\u2019s job duties were assigned.</p>\n<p id=\"b518-5\">{\u00b6 3} Appellants filed a motion for summary judgment asserting that Leininger had filed her action beyond the statute of limitations for R.C. 4112.02 and that she could not establish a common-law cause of action for wrongful discharge, because statutory remedies exist that provide her with the possibility of complete relief. The trial court granted the motion and dismissed the complaint.</p>\n<p id=\"b518-6\">{\u00b6 4} The Fifth District Court of Appeals reversed the trial court\u2019s judgment, relying on <em>Livingston v. Hillside Rehab. Hosp. </em>(1997), 79 Ohio St.3d 249, 680 N.E.2d 1220, a case in which, on the authority of <em>Kulch v. Structural Fibers, Inc. </em>(1997), 78 Ohio St.3d 134, 677 N.E.2d 308, we reversed, without opinion, an appellate judgment that had refused to allow an age-based common-law claim for wrongful discharge. Although recognizing that later, in <em>Wiles v. Medina Auto Parts, </em>96 Ohio St.3d 240, 2002-Ohio-3994, 773 N.E.2d 526, we questioned the need to recognize a common-law action for wrongful discharge when a statutory remedy adequately protected society\u2019s interests, the Fifth District concluded that Leininger could maintain her claim. It reasoned that <em>Wiles </em>has not been applied to wrongful discharge claims based on R.C. Chapter 4112 and that <em>Wiles </em>did not expressly overrule <em>Livingston.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b518-7\">{\u00b6 5} Appellants argue against recognition of a public policy tort for wrongful discharge based on age discrimination, because the remedies provided in R.C. Chapter 4112 sufficiently protect the public\u2019s interest. Leininger responds that a common-law claim based on public policy would offer broader protection than the statutes and that plaintiffs such as she will not be fully vindicated if they are forced to rely on the limited remedies of R.C. 4112.14.</p>\n<p id=\"b518-8\">Common-Law Claim Based on Public Policy</p>\n<p id=\"b518-9\">{\u00b6 6} The common-law doctrine of employment at will generally governs employment relationships in Ohio. <em>Wiles, </em>96 Ohio St.3d 240, 2002-Ohio-3994, 773 N.E.2d 526, \u00b6 5. We have described this relationship as one in which \u201cthe employee agrees to perform work under the direction and control of the employer, and the employer agrees to pay the employee at an agreed rate. Moreover, either an employer or an employee in a pure at-will employment relationship may legally terminate the employment relationship at any time and for any reason. <em>Mers v. Dispatch Printing Co. </em>(1985), 19 Ohio St.3d 100, 103, 19 OBR 261, 483 N.E.2d 150.\u201d <em>Lake Land Emp. Group of Akron, LLC v. Columber, </em>101 Ohio St.3d 242, 2004-Ohio-786, 804 N.E.2d 27, \u00b6 17.</p>\n<p id=\"b518-10\">{\u00b6 7} A public policy exception to the employment-at-will doctrine was first recognized by this court in <em>Greeley v. Miami Valley Maintenance Contrs., Inc. </em>(1990), 49 Ohio St.3d 228, 551 N.E.2d 981. Greeley\u2019s employment was terminated <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"313\">*313</page-number>because he was subject to a court\u2019s wage-withholding order. Although R.C. 3113.213(D) clearly prohibited the employer\u2019s action, that statute provided only for the employer to be fined for a violation and did not grant the employee any civil remedies. This court held that \u201c[pjublic policy warrants an exception to the employment-at-will doctrine when an employee is discharged or disciplined for a reason which is prohibited by statute.\u201d Id. at paragraph one of the syllabus.</p>\n<p id=\"b519-5\">{\u00b6 8} Later, <em>Greeley </em>was extended, and claims for wrongful discharge were allowed for employment terminations that violated public policy as expressed in sources other than the Revised Code. \u201c \u2018Clear public policy\u2019 sufficient to justify an exception to the employment-at-will doctrine is not limited to public policy expressed by the General Assembly in the form of statutory enactments, but may also be discerned as a matter of law based on other sources, such as the Constitutions of Ohio and the United States, administrative rules and regulations, and the common law.\u201d <em>Painter v. Graley </em>(1994), 70 Ohio St.3d 377, 639 N.E.2d 51, paragraph three of the syllabus.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> <em>Painter </em>also suggested the following elements for the tort of wrongful discharge in violation of public policy:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b519-6\">{\u00b6 9} \u201c T. That clear public policy existed and was manifested in a state or federal constitution, statute or administrative regulation, or in the common law (the <em>clarity </em>element).</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b519-7\">{\u00b6 10} \u201c \u20182. That dismissing employees under circumstances like those involved in the plaintiffs dismissal would jeopardize the public policy (the <em>jeopardy </em>element).</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b519-8\">{\u00b6 11} \u201c \u20183. The plaintiffs dismissal was motivated by conduct related to the public policy (the <em>causation </em>element).</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b519-9\">{\u00b6 12} \u201c \u20184. The employer lacked overriding legitimate business justification for the dismissal (the <em>overriding justification </em>element).\u2019 \u201d Id. at 384, 639 N.E.2d 51, fn. 8, quoting H. Perritt, The Future of Wrongful Dismissal Claims: Where Does Employer Self Interest Lie? (1989), 58 U.CimL.Rev. 397, 398-399.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b519-10\">{\u00b6 13} We expressly adopted this analysis in <em>Collins v. Rizkana </em>(1995), 73 Ohio St.3d 65, 69-70, 652 N.E.2d 653, which also established that the clarity and jeopardy elements are questions of law to be determined by the court. Id. at 70, 652 N.E.2d 653.</p>\n<p id=\"b519-11\">{\u00b6 14} Instead of analyzing these elements, the Fifth District noted that some courts have interpreted <em>Livingston, </em>79 Ohio St.3d 249, 680 N.E.2d 1220, to allow <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"314\">*314</page-number>public policy claims for wrongful discharge based on age discrimination. See, also, <em>Gessner v. Union, </em>159 Ohio App.3d 43, 2004-Ohio-5770, 823 N.E.2d 1, \u00b6 20. Nevertheless, when Livingston\u2019s cause of action arose, a different statutory scheme existed. Livingston\u2019s public policy claim was based solely on an alleged violation of former R.C. 4101.17(A);<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> consequently, civil remedies under R.C. 4112.99 were not available to her. Later, however, former R.C. 4101.17 was incorporated into R.C. Chapter 4112 and renumbered R.C. 4112.14. Am.S.B. 162, 146 Ohio Laws, Part V, 9163, 9627. Now, remedies are available to plaintiffs such as Leininger, pursuant to R.C. 4112.99, that were not available to Livingston.</p>\n<p id=\"b520-4\">{\u00b6 15} Having determined that <em>Livingston </em>does not control, we will now address the two elements of a common-law claim based on public policy that present questions of law.</p>\n<p id=\"b520-5\">The Clarity Element</p>\n<p id=\"b520-6\">{\u00b6 16} As previously noted, in a common-law claim for wrongful discharge, a plaintiff must prove the clarity element by showing that a clear public policy is manifested in the state or federal constitutions, or in a statute, an administrative regulation, or the common law. Here, the parties do not dispute that Ohio has a clear public policy against age discrimination in the employment setting.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> R.C. 4112.02(A) states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b521-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"315\">*315</page-number>{\u00b6 17} \u201cIt shall be an unlawful discriminatory practice:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b521-5\">{\u00b6 18} \u201c(A) For any employer, because of the race, color, religion, sex, national origin, disability, age, or ancestry of any person, to discharge without just cause, to refuse to hire, or otherwise to discriminate against that person with respect to hire, tenure, terms, conditions, or privileges of employment, or any matter directly or indirectly related to employment.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b521-6\">{\u00b6 19} R.C. 4112.14(A) provides that \u201c[n]o employer shall discriminate in any job opening against any applicant or discharge without just cause any employee aged forty or older who is physically able to perform the duties and otherwise meets the established requirements of the job and laws pertaining to the relationship between employer and employee.\u201d The Age Discrimination in Employment Act of 1967, 81 Stat. 602, as amended, Section 621 et seq., Title 29, U.S.Code, offers similar protection. It prohibits age-based discrimination in employment against persons aged 40 and older. Section 631(a), Title 29, U.S.Code.</p>\n<p id=\"b521-7\">{\u00b6 20} Thus, the clarity element is satisfied.</p>\n<p id=\"b521-8\">The Jeopardy Element</p>\n<p id=\"b521-9\">{\u00b6 21} A plaintiff must also prove the jeopardy element, meaning that without a common-law tort claim for wrongful discharge based on age, Ohio\u2019s clear policy against age discrimination would be compromised.</p>\n<p id=\"b521-10\">{\u00b6 22} There is confusion over the proper way to analyze the jeopardy element and \u201cwhether the public policy tort should be rejected where the statute expressing the public policy already provides adequate remedies to protect the public interest.\u201d <em>Collins v. Rizkana, </em>73 Ohio St.3d at 73, 652 N.E.2d 653.</p>\n<p id=\"b521-11\">{\u00b6 23} In <em>Greeley, </em>the statute involved did not provide any private remedies to the employee, and so a claim at common law was recognized. 49 Ohio St.3d 228, 551 N.E.2d 981. In contrast, a common-law claim was not recognized in a case in which the plaintiff had sufficiently broad and inclusive remedies through statutes and regulations governing public employment as well as a collective bargaining agreement with grievance procedures. <em>Provens v. Stark Cty. Bd. of Mental Retardation &amp; Dev. Disabilities </em>(1992), 64 Ohio St.3d 252, 594 N.E.2d 959.</p>\n<p id=\"b521-12\">{\u00b6 24} When public policy arises from more than one source, the analysis has been different. In <em>Collins, </em>the terminated employee\u2019s wrongful discharge claim was based on the public policy against sexual harassment and sex discrimination, and two sources for the public policy were implicated, R.C. Chapters 2907 and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"316\">*316</page-number>4112. \u201cIn cases of multiple-source public policy, the statute containing the right and remedy will not foreclose recognition of the tort on the basis of some other source of public policy, unless it was the legislature\u2019s intent in enacting the statute to preempt common-law remedies.\u201d (Emphasis sic.) <em>Collins, </em>73 Ohio St.3d at 73, 652 N.E.2d 653. This court cautioned, however, \u201cWe do not mean to suggest that where a statute\u2019s coverage provisions form an essential part of its public policy, we may extract a policy from the statute and use it to nullify the statute\u2019s own coverage provisions.\u201d Id. at 74, 652 N.E.2d 653. Collins was precluded from pursuing the remedies available in R.C. Chapter 4112 because her employer did not employ a sufficient number of persons to be covered by the chapter. Id. We declined to decide the issue of whether the availability of statutory remedies should defeat a wrongful discharge claim. Id.</p>\n<p id=\"b522-5\">{\u00b6 25} Like <em>Collins, Kulch </em>presented a case in which there were multiple sources indicating a public policy against the type of wrongful termination alleged. <em>Kulch, </em>78 Ohio St.3d 134, 677 N.E.2d 308. The employee in <em>Kulch </em>alleged that he had been terminated for filing a complaint with the Occupational Safety and Health Administration. Id. at 135, 677 N.E.2d 308. Both Section 660(c), Title 29, U.S.Code and R.C. 4113.52 were identified as separate and independent sources for the public policy against termination for whistleblowing. Id. at 151, 153, 677 N.E.2d 308. After noting that the federal statute did not provide an employee with a private cause of action against an employer, id. at 151, 677 N.E.2d 308, we determined that the remedies available under R.C. 4113.52 were not adequate to fully compensate an aggrieved employee, id. at 155, 677 N.E.2d 308. We held that in the absence of any language indicating that the General Assembly intended the remedies of R.C. 4113.52 to be exclusive, \u201cthe mere existence of statutory remedies in R.C. 4113.52 does not, without more, operate to bar recognition of [a] <em>Greeley </em>claim for tortious wrongful discharge in violation of R.C. 4113.52.\u201d Id. at 156, 677 N.E.2d 308.</p>\n<p id=\"b522-6\">{\u00b6 26} <em>Wiles, </em>however, rejected any interpretation of <em>Kulch </em>that would indicate that a statutory remedy that provides less than a full panoply of relief gives rise to a common-law cause of action for wrongful discharge. 96 Ohio St.3d 240, 2002-Ohio-3994, 773 N.E.2d 526, \u00b6 20. In <em>Wiles, </em>we determined that allowing a wrongful discharge claim based on the public policy expressed in the Family and Medical Leave Act (\u201cFMLA\u201d), Section 2601 et seq., Title 29, U.S.Code, was unnecessary to vindicate the policy goals of the FMLA. Id. at \u00b6 1. The combination of compensatory and equitable remedies, which did not include punitive damages, was determined to be sufficient to ensure that the public policy embodied in the FMLA was not jeopardized. Id. at \u00b6 17. We noted that \u201c[a]n analysis of the jeopardy element necessarily involves inquiring into the existence of any alternative means of promoting the particular public policy to be vindicated by a common-law wrongful-discharge claim. * * * Simply put, there is no <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"317\">*317</page-number>need to recognize a common-law action for wrongful discharge if there already exists a statutory remedy that adequately protects society\u2019s interests.\u201d Id. at \u00b6 15.</p>\n<p id=\"b523-5\">{\u00b6 27} It is clear that when a statutory scheme contains a full array of remedies, the underlying public policy will not be jeopardized if a common-law claim for wrongful discharge is not recognized based on that policy. The parties question what should happen if a statutory scheme offers something less than complete relief. Appellants urge this court to follow <em>Wiles, </em>while appellee and her amici curiae advocate reliance on Kulch; both <em>Wiles </em>and <em>Kulch </em>are plurality opinions with regard to the issue pertinent to this case. After considering our prior decisions, we conclude that it is unnecessary to recognize a common-law claim when remedy provisions are an essential part of the statutes upon which the plaintiff depends for the public policy claim and when those remedies adequately protect society\u2019s interest by discouraging the wrongful conduct.</p>\n<p id=\"b523-6\">{\u00b6 28} We must, therefore, examine the extent of the remedies that R.C. Chapter 4112 provides.</p>\n<p id=\"b523-7\">Available Remedies under R.C. Chapter 4112</p>\n<p id=\"b523-8\">{\u00b6 29} There are four separate statutes that provide remedies for age discrimination in R.C. Chapter 4112. First, R.C. 4112.02(N) awards \u201cany legal or equitable relief that will effectuate the individual\u2019s rights.\u201d Second, upon proof of an unlawful discriminatory practice, R.C. 4112.05(G) provides that the Ohio Civil Rights Commission shall issue \u201can order requiring the respondent to cease and desist from the unlawful discriminatory practice, requiring the respondent to take any further affirmative or other action that will effectuate the purposes of [R.C. Chapter 4112], including, but not limited to, hiring, reinstatement, or upgrading of employees with or without back pay, * * * and requiring the respondent to report to the commission the manner of compliance.\u201d Third, R.C. 4112.14(B) provides that if an employer has discriminated against an employee on the basis of age, the court shall order \u201can appropriate remedy which shall include reimbursement to the applicant or employee for the costs, including reasonable attorney\u2019s fees, of the action, or to reinstate the employee in the employee\u2019s former position with compensation for lost wages and any lost fringe benefits from the date of the illegal discharge and to reimburse the employee for the costs, including reasonable attorney\u2019s fees, of the action.\u201d Fourth, R.C. 4112.99 makes violators of R.C. Chapter 4112 \u201csubject to a civil action for damages, injunctive relief, or any other appropriate relief.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b523-9\">{\u00b6 30} Thus, both R.C. 4112.02(N) and 4112.99 have broad language regarding the relief available. \u201c \u2018Damages,\u2019 absent a restrictive modifier like \u2018compensatory,\u2019 \u2018actual,\u2019 \u2018consequential\u2019 or \u2018punitive,\u2019 is an inclusive term embracing the panoply of legally recognized pecuniary relief.\u201d <em>Rice v. CertainTeed Corp. </em>(1999), <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"318\">*318</page-number>84 Ohio St.3d 417, 419, 704 N.E.2d 1217. Similarly, \u201clegal relief\u2019 means a remedy available in a court of law, i.e., damages. Even though R.C. 4112.05 and 4112.14 provide more specific forms of relief, the intent is to put the plaintiff in the same position as if the unlawful discriminatory practice had not occurred.</p>\n<p id=\"b524-5\">{\u00b6 31} Leininger maintains that we should consider only the remedies in R.C. 4112.14 because it is a more specific statute regarding age discrimination that prevails over the more general provisions of R.C. 4112.02 and 4112.99.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> We reject this argument. R.C. 4112.08 requires a liberal construction of R.C. Chapter 4112. Although R.C. 4112.02(N),<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> 4112.08,<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> and 4112.14(B)<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> all require a plaintiff to elect under which statute (R.C. 4112.02, 4112.05, or 4112.14) a claim for age discrimination will be pursued, when an age discrimination claim accrues, a plaintiff may choose from the full spectrum of remedies available. Leininger\u2019s argument also does not take into account the scope of R.C. 4112.99\u2019s remedies. In <em>Elek v. Huntington Natl. Bank </em>(1991), 60 Ohio St.3d 135, 573 N.E.2d 1056, we stated that R.C. 4112.99 provides an independent civil action to seek redress for any form of discrimination identified in the chapter. Id. at 136, 573 N.E.2d 1056. A violation of R.C. 4112.14 (formerly R.C. 4101.17), therefore, can also support a claim for damages, injunctive relief, or any other appropriate relief under R.C. 4112.99. This fourth avenue of relief is not subject to the election of remedies.</p>\n<p id=\"b525-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"319\">*319</page-number>{\u00b6 32} Leininger contends that the short statute of limitations of R.C. 4112.02 (and of R.C. 4112.05, which also has a six-month statute of limitations) detracts from the remedial scheme of R.C. Chapter 4112. The period within which a claim must be brought, however, is a policy decision best left to the General Assembly.</p>\n<p id=\"b525-5\">{\u00b6 33} Based on the above, we hold that the jeopardy element necessary to support a common-law claim is not satisfied, because R.C. Chapter 4112 adequately protects the state\u2019s policy against age discrimination in employment through the remedies it offers to aggrieved employees.</p>\n<p id=\"b525-6\">Conclusion</p>\n<p id=\"b525-7\">{\u00b6 34} We therefore hold that a common-law tort claim for wrongful discharge based on Ohio\u2019s public policy against age discrimination does not exist, because the remedies in R.C. Chapter 4112 provide complete relief for a statutory claim for age discrimination.

Although R.C. 4112.14 was the only statutory claim available to Leininger at the time she filed her complaint due to the expiration of the statute of limitations for claims under R.C. 4112.02 and 4112.05, this fact does not justify limiting our examination of the available remedies under the chapter as a whole. In determining whether a common-law tort claim for wrongful discharge based on Ohio\u2019s public policy against age discrimination should be recognized, we need to look at all the remedies available to a plaintiff at the time the claim accrued.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b524-7\">.

Hillside Rehab. Hosp. </em>(1997), 79 Ohio St.3d 249, 680 N.E.2d 1220. Granted, the majority\u2019s opinion in <em>Livingston </em>was brief, but it was clear. It read in its entirety: \u201cThe judgment of the court of appeals is reversed, and the cause is remanded to the trial court on the authority of <em>Kulch v. Structural Fibers, Inc. </em>(1997), 78 Ohio St.3d 134, 677 N.E.2d 308.\u201d The lower court in <em>Livingston </em>had held that in regard to an age-discrimination claim, \u201ca plaintiff is * * * precluded from pursuing a common law tort claim in conjunction with a statutory claim already providing the employee with an adequate remedy.\u201d <em>Livingston v. Hillside Rehab. Hosp. </em>(Jan. 24, 1997), 11th Dist. No. 95-T-5360, 1997 WL 51413, *2. That is the holding that was reversed by this court in <em>Livingston, </em>79 Ohio St.3d 249, 680 N.E.2d 1220. Other courts have rightly interpreted this court\u2019s decision in <em>Livingston </em>as recognizing a common-law claim for age discrimination in Ohio. <em>Jones v. Goodyear Tire &amp; Rubber Co., </em>Summit App. No. 21724, 2004-Ohio-2821, 2004 WL 1197209, \u00b6 22; <em>Ferraro v. B.F. Goodrich Co., </em>149 Ohio App.3d 301, 2002-Ohio-4398, 777 N.E.2d 282, \u00b6 51-52; <em>White v. </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"320\">*320</page-number><em>Honda of Am. Mfg., Inc. </em>(S.D.Ohio 2002), 191 F.Supp.2d 933, 954; and <em>Ziegler v. IBP Hog Market, Inc. </em>(C.A.6, 2001), 249 F.3d 509, 519, fn. 10.</p>\n<p id=\"b526-5\">{\u00b6 36} Today, this court holds that because former R.C. 4101.17, the statute at issue in <em>Livingston, </em>is now R.C. 4112.14, the statutory remedies now available through R.C. 4112.99 are adequate, and so there is no common-law claim for age discrimination. I do not believe that the common law should be inextricably tied to the nuances and vagaries of Ohio\u2019s statutory scheme. The common law has its own life.</p>\n<p id=\"b526-6\">{\u00b6 37} When this court recognizes a common-law cause of action for age discrimination, does that not establish the common law? Is our holding in <em>Livingston </em>no longer good law because R.C. 4107.17 later became R.C. 4112.14? Will <em>Livingston </em>become good law again if the General Assembly makes R.C. 4112.99 remedies unavailable to R.C. 4112.14 plaintiffs? Did the public policy behind a common-law action for age discrimination disappear because the General Assembly shifted the statute into a different statutory chapter?</p>\n<p id=\"b526-7\">{\u00b6 38} As this court held in <em>Kulch v. Structural Fibers, Inc., </em>78 Ohio St.3d 134, 161, 677 N.E.2d 308:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b526-8\">{\u00b6 39} \u201cThe employment-at-will doctrine was judicially created, and it may be judicially abolished. Clearly, it is the responsibility of the Ohio judiciary to determine whether sufficiently clear public policy reasons exist to support a common-law exception to the doctrine of employment at will * * * and to set the parameters of those exceptions.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b526-9\">{\u00b6 40} Public-policy exceptions to the employment-at-will doctrine need not be directly tied to specific statutes, but instead can find their <em>support </em>in statutory law, as well as in \u201cother sources, such as the Constitutions of Ohio and the United States, administrative rules and regulations, and the common law.\u201d <em>Painter v. Graley </em>(1994), 70 Ohio St.3d 377, 639 N.E.2d 51, paragraph three of the syllabus. The relevant inquiry is whether there has been an expression of public policy that may support a common-law exception to employment at will; the extent of available statutory remedies is not a primary concern. The role of the common law is not to fill in gaps left by statutory remedies, but to adjust the acceptable breadth of employment at will, a common-law creation. <em>Kulch, </em>78 Ohio St.3d at 155, 677 N.E.2d 308. There is no reason that the statutory tail should wag the common-law dog in this area of the law.</p>\n<p id=\"b526-10\">{\u00b6 41} Concomitantly, the fact that the General Assembly or Congress establishes an exception to employment at will does not mean that a common-law cause of action tracing that statutory right necessarily arises. I created some confusion with my concurrence in judgment only in <em>Wiles v. Medina Auto </em>Parts, 96 Ohio St.3d 240, 2002-Ohio-3994, 773 N.E.2d 526. I concurred only in judgment due to my belief that a violation of the Family and Medical Leave Act did not rise to the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"321\">*321</page-number>level of great societal wrongs \u2014 such as discrimination based on race, sex, or age \u2014 that merit a common-law exception to employment at will. Further, when this court holds that a common-law exception to employment at will exists, that exception should apply to all employment, regardless of the size of the employer. <em>Collins v. Rizkana </em>(1995), 73 Ohio St.3d 65, 652 N.E.2d 653. I agreed with only the outcome of <em>Wiles, </em>and thus the analysis in the lead opinion in <em>Wiles </em>is not binding precedent. Accordingly, the statement in <em>Wiles </em>at \u00b6 15 that \u201cthere is no need to recognize a common-law action for wrongful discharge if there already exists a statutory remedy that adequately protects society\u2019s interests\u201d is of no value to this case or any other.</p>\n<attorneys id=\"A42\">Michael Terrence Conway &amp; Co., and Michael Terrence Conway, for appellee.</attorneys>\n<attorneys id=\"ACx\">Schottenstein, Zox &amp; Dunn Co., L.P.A., Corey V. Crognale, and Kelly K. Curtis, for appellants.</attorneys>\n<attorneys id=\"Adb\">Denlinger, Rosenthal &amp; Greenberg Co., L.P.A., Daniel G. Rosenthal, Gary L. Greenberg, and Michael P. Majba, urging reversal for amicus curiae Ohio Management Lawyers Association.</attorneys>\n<attorneys id=\"A3F\">Gittes <em>&amp; </em>Schulte, Frederick M. Gittes, and Kathaleen B. Schulte, urging affirmance for amicus curiae AARP.</attorneys>\n<attorneys id=\"A6z\">Gordillo <em>&amp; </em>Gordillo, L.L.C., and Gregory A. Gordillo; Christina M. Royer; and Tate <em>&amp; </em>Renner and Richard R. Renner, urging affirmance for amicus curiae the Ohio Employment Lawyers Association.</attorneys>\n<p id=\"b527-4\">{\u00b6 42} In this particular case, a statute offering a clear expression of public policy against age discrimination supported this court\u2019s holding in <em>Livingston. </em>Ohio still has multiple statutes expressing a societal statement against age discrimination. The fact that statutory law may have caught up with the common law as far as remedies are concerned does not mean that the common-law cause of action recognized by this court in <em>Livingston </em>disappears.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
