We find that none of his propositions of law have merit and affirm Frazier\u2019s convictions. We have also independently weighed the aggravating circumstances against the mitigating factors and have compared Frazier\u2019s sen<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"140\">*140</page-number>tence of death to those imposed in similar cases, as R.C. 2929.05(A) requires. As a result, we affirm Frazier\u2019s sentence of death.</p>\n<p id=\"b346-4\">{\u00b6 2} The evidence at trial established that, on the morning of March 2, 2004, James Frazier entered 49-year-old Mary Stevenson\u2019s apartment and murdered her by strangling her and slitting her throat. Frazier stole two of her purses and fled the scene. Subsequently, Frazier was convicted of the aggravated murder of Stevenson and was sentenced to death.</p>\n<p id=\"b346-5\">\n<em>State\u2019s Case</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b346-6\">{\u00b6 3} The evidence at trial established the following facts. Frazier and Stevenson were both residents of the Northgate Apartments in Toledo. Northgate is a federally subsidized apartment complex, and the residents are low income and either elderly or disabled. Frazier was supported by Social Security disability income, and Stevenson suffered from cerebral palsy.</p>\n<p id=\"b346-7\">{\u00b6 4} During the late summer or early fall of 2003, Frazier baked a cake for Stevenson. Later, Stevenson took the cake pan to Cindy Myers, a social worker at Northgate Apartments, and asked Myers to return the pan to Frazier. Stevenson asked Myers to \u201ctell him thanks for baking the cake but she could do that herself, and * * * she also had a boyfriend.\u201d Myers returned the cake pan to Frazier and told him, \u201cMary said thank you for baking the cake but she can bake herself * * * and not to do it anymore.\u201d Frazier responded, \u201c[0]kay.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b346-8\">{\u00b6 5} On the evening of March 1 and in the early morning of March 2, 2004, Frazier and a group of individuals smoked crack cocaine and drank alcohol inside Frazier\u2019s third-floor apartment.</p>\n<p id=\"b346-9\">{\u00b6 6} During the drug party, Frazier provided Chastity McMillen with $200 to $300 worth of crack cocaine without charge. At some point, Frazier\u2019s guests ran out of crack. Frazier called someone to deliver more crack, and he also called someone for money to buy it. More crack was brought to Frazier\u2019s apartment later that night.</p>\n<p id=\"b346-10\">{\u00b6 7} Frazier was wearing jeans and a white T-shirt during the party. At some point during the evening, Frazier left the party. When he returned, Frazier was not wearing a shirt.</p>\n<p id=\"b346-11\">{\u00b6 8} At 7:17 a.m. on March 2, Frazier made a 911 call to report a woman at the complex lying on the laundry-room floor, having seizures. Paramedics met Frazier at the apartment, but no one needing medical attention was found in the laundry room.</p>\n<p id=\"b346-12\">{\u00b6 9} Stevenson lived alone in a first-floor apartment at Northgate. She supported herself on Social Security benefits. Because of her condition, Stevenson had limited mobility and difficulty speaking. Her apartment was located <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"141\">*141</page-number>about 20 to 30 feet from the laundry room and 15 feet from the elevators close to one of the stairways.</p>\n<p id=\"b347-4\">{\u00b6 10} On March 1, Bill Gangway, Stevenson\u2019s boyfriend, and Stevenson talked on the telephone, and they agreed to meet at her apartment the next day. Around 9:00 a.m. on March 2, Gangway knocked on Stevenson\u2019s apartment door, but she did not answer. Gangway remained at Northgate for the rest of the day and unsuccessfully tried to contact Stevenson three or four times. At 4:15 p.m., Susan Adams, Northgate\u2019s assistant manager, checked on Stevenson. After receiving no answer to her knocking, Adams entered Stevenson\u2019s apartment and found her lying on the bedroom floor, dead. Adams then called 911.</p>\n<p id=\"b347-5\">{\u00b6 11} Around 5:00 p.m. on March 2, police arrived at Stevenson\u2019s apartment. Stevenson\u2019s body was near the foot of her bed. Stevenson\u2019s throat had been slashed, and blood had pooled underneath her head and shoulders. She was wearing a nightgown that was tucked into the front of her underpants.</p>\n<p id=\"b347-6\">{\u00b6 12} Police examining Stevenson\u2019s apartment found no signs of a struggle, forcible entry, or indication that her apartment had been ransacked. Stevenson\u2019s purse and identification cards were missing, and police found no cash in her apartment. Stevenson\u2019s apartment key was discovered on her wheelchair in the living room. No knife or other possible murder weapon was found in Stevenson\u2019s apartment. However, a knife was missing from the knife holder on the kitchen counter.</p>\n<p id=\"b347-7\">{\u00b6 13} Police used an alternate light source to look for semen or other bodily fluids in Stevenson\u2019s bedroom, but police found no evidence of semen on Stevenson\u2019s bed, bed sheets, robe, or anything else in the bedroom. Police also searched the area around the apartment building and the Dumpster that was used by first-floor residents, but no evidence was found.</p>\n<p id=\"b347-8\">{\u00b6 14} On March 3, 2004, police investigators examined the sealed trash compactor-Dumpster that was used by Northgate residents living on the second through the tenth floors. During the search, investigators found Stevenson\u2019s clutch purse, which contained her birth certificate, bank card, and library card. Two bills addressed to Frazier were located near the clutch purse. Investigators also found Stevenson\u2019s Social Security and Medicaid cards, her large black purse, and a Fruit of the Loom T-shirt, size double X, 50 to 52, that had been turned inside out. Frazier is six feet one inch tall and weighs 250 pounds. A knife that matched the set of knives in Stevenson\u2019s kitchen was also found and appeared to have blood on it. No money was found in Stevenson\u2019s two purses.</p>\n<p id=\"b347-9\">{\u00b6 15} Investigators returned to the police station with the evidence collected from the trash. Bloodstains were detected on the front of the white T-shirt and tested positive for the presence of human blood. The T-shirt and the knife were sent to the lab for DNA testing.</p>\n<p id=\"b348-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"142\">*142</page-number>{\u00b6 16} On March 4, 2004, investigators executed a search warrant of Frazier\u2019s apartment. There, police seized two T-shirts that were the same size and had the same manufacturing tags as the T-shirt found in the trash compactor.</p>\n<p id=\"b348-5\">{\u00b6 17} At approximately 2:30 p.m. on March 4, Toledo detectives William Seymour and Denise Knight conducted a videotaped interview of Frazier. After being advised of his <em>Miranda </em>rights and waiving them, Frazier stated that sometime after 6:00 a.m. on March 2, he went to the laundry room with a basket of bedding and found a woman lying on the laundry-room floor. According to Frazier, he knocked on Stevenson\u2019s door and said he needed to call 911. Stevenson let Frazier into her apartment. Frazier then called 911 and told the operator that there was a lady lying on the laundry-room floor at Northgate Apartments. Frazier left Stevenson\u2019s apartment and waited for the paramedics.</p>\n<p id=\"b348-6\">{\u00b6 18} Frazier said Stevenson was fine when he left her apartment. Stevenson locked the door when he left. Frazier said he did not return to Stevenson\u2019s apartment after making the 911 call.</p>\n<p id=\"b348-7\">{\u00b6 19} Frazier said the lady was gone when he returned to the laundry room. He told the arriving paramedics that he did not know what happened to the lady. Frazier says he asked Francis Clinton, a fifth-floor resident who was in the laundry-room area, about the lady, and she said, \u201cI didn\u2019t see nobody.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b348-8\">{\u00b6 20} At approximately 9:45 p.m. on March 4, 2004, Detectives Seymour and Knight conducted a second videotaped interview of Frazier. According to Frazier, he watched TV at a friend\u2019s apartment until midnight or 1:00 a.m. on March 2. Frazier then returned to his apartment. Sometime after 6:00 a.m., he took a light load of bedding to the laundry room. He repeated that he found an unidentified lady lying on the laundry-room floor, went to Stevenson\u2019s apartment, and called 911.</p>\n<p id=\"b348-9\">{\u00b6 21} Frazier said, \u201cNothing happened out of the ordinary\u201d when he was in Stevenson\u2019s apartment. Frazier said that Stevenson had a beautiful personality but claimed, \u201cI never looked at her in a sexual way.\u201d He claimed that he was impotent, so he had no interest in sex. Frazier denied throwing away anything that belonged to the victim. However, he admitted, \u201cI threw that T-shirt away.\u201d Frazier said, \u201cI did not do this.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b348-10\">{\u00b6 22} Surveillance cameras at Northgate Apartments provided coverage of the elevators, the main entrances, and the parking lots. However, there were no cameras in the main stairwell next to the laundry room. Police reviewed the surveillance tapes and tracked the movements of Frazier and other residents on the evening of March 1 and the morning of March 2.</p>\n<p id=\"b348-11\">{\u00b6 23} Cameras show Francis Clinton entering the laundry room with a load of clothes at 6:30 a.m. on March 2 and then departing. At 7:16 a.m., Frazier <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"143\">*143</page-number>entered the laundry room with a small bundle of clothes under his arm and then left and walked towards Stevenson\u2019s apartment.</p>\n<p id=\"b349-4\">{\u00b624} At 7:19 a.m., Clinton returned to the laundry room. At 7:24:11 a.m., Frazier came back to the laundry room with the bundle of clothes under his arms, took a quick look inside, and walked away. At 7:25:02 a.m., Frazier took the elevator to the third floor with the bundle still under his arms. At 7:25:25 a.m., Frazier got out on the third floor. He returned to the elevator at 7:25:50 a.m. without the bundle.</p>\n<p id=\"b349-5\">{\u00b6 25} At 7:25:58 a.m., Clinton left the laundry room and returned to the fifth floor. At 7:26:12 a.m., Frazier returned to the laundry room, took another quick peek inside, and left. At 7:26:44 a.m., Frazier and the paramedics entered the laundry room. At 7:27:14 a.m., they departed. Frazier wore a white T-shirt during this entire sequence of events.</p>\n<p id=\"b349-6\">{\u00b6 26} At trial, Detective Seymour testified that the third-floor garbage chute is close to the elevator. He said it takes approximately 20 seconds to walk at a normal pace to the garbage chute and return to the elevator. Frazier\u2019s third-floor apartment is further down the hall. Seymour said that walking at a regular pace to Frazier\u2019s apartment and returning to the elevator takes 40 to 45 seconds.</p>\n<p id=\"b349-7\">{\u00b6 27} Dr. Cynthia Beisser, the deputy coroner for Lucas County, conducted the autopsy on Stevenson. The victim suffered a \u201clarge sharp-force injury across the neck\u201d that cut \u201cboth the carotid arteries and the jugular veins and went through the trachea * * * down to the spine.\u201d Stevenson\u2019s thyroid cartilage was fractured, and \u201cthere was bruising on the undersurface of the chin and on the upper portion of the chest, and * * * blood in the tongue,\u201d which showed that she had also been strangled. Dr. Beisser also found vaginal abrasions and lacerations consistent with vaginal intercourse that had occurred while the victim was alive. Dr. Beisser concluded that Stevenson \u201cdied of a combination of * * * strangulation and the sharp-force injury to the neck.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b349-8\">{\u00b6 28} Detective Terry Cousino collected physical evidence during the autopsy, including a hair found on Stevenson\u2019s right tricep. The hair was sent to the lab for further testing.</p>\n<p id=\"b349-9\">{\u00b6 29} Staci Violi, a serology expert at the Ohio Bureau of Criminal Identification and Investigation (\u201cBCI\u201d), conducted tests and verified the presence of human blood on the knife blade and on some areas of the T-shirt that had been found in the trash compactor. Test results were also positive for the presence of amylase, a component of saliva, on the neck area of the T-shirt. However, vaginal and rectal swabs obtained during the autopsy tested negative for the presence of semen.</p>\n<p id=\"b350-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"144\">*144</page-number>{\u00b6 30} Brian Bowen, a DNA analyst at BCI, conducted DNA tests on bloodstains found on the knife blade. These tests revealed a partial DNA profile consistent with Stevenson\u2019s DNA. Bowen testified that the expected frequency of occurrence of the partial DNA profile found on the knife blade is one in 58,070,000 individuals. DNA testing of the knife handle revealed a \u201cmixture,\u201d with the \u201cmajor DNA type * * * consistent with Mary Stevenson.\u201d Bowen also conducted DNA testing of a bloodstain from the T-shirt. These tests provided a full DNA profile consistent with Stevenson\u2019s DNA. The expected frequency of occurrence from the DNA on this bloodstain is one in 285,500,000,000,000 individuals.</p>\n<p id=\"b350-5\">{\u00b6 31} Bowen also conducted DNA testing on the amylase stain on the T-shirt. DNA testing resulted in a \u201cpartial profile [that] was a mixture, and the major DNA type is consistent with James Frazier.\u201d The frequency of occurrence of the DNA from this stain is one in 493 individuals. DNA testing of the neck band of the T-shirt resulted in a mixture, and Frazier\u2019s DNA is consistent with the DNA of a contributor to the mixture. Bowen testified that the frequency of occurrence of the DNA from the neck band of the T-shirt is one in 15,500 individuals. However, Bowen\u2019s written report states that the expected frequency of occurrence is one in 115,500 individuals. Finally, DNA testing of swabs from the armpit of the T-shirt resulted in a \u201cmixture,\u201d and Frazier\u2019s DNA is consistent with the DNA of a contributor to that mixture.</p>\n<p id=\"b350-6\">{\u00b6 32} Ted Manasian, an expert in trace evidence at BCI, examined the hair found on Stevenson\u2019s right tricep. Manasian testified, \u201cIt was found also to be similar * * * to gross physical characteristics to the pubic hairs of James Frazier.\u201d Subsequently, the hair was sent to the ReliaGene Corporation for further testing.</p>\n<p id=\"b350-7\">{\u00b6 33} Amrita Lal-Paterson, formerly a senior DNA analyst at ReliaGene Technologies, conducted mitochondrial DNA testing of the hair from Stevenson\u2019s arm. Lal-Paterson found that the hair sample is \u201cconsistent with the * * * mitochondrial genetic profile of Mr. Frazier, and * * * therefore Mr. Frazier or a maternal relative of his could not be excluded from that particular sample.\u201d According to Lal-Paterson, the percentage of people that could be excluded as a potential donor is 99.6 percent of the African-American population, 99.8 percent of the Caucasian population, and 99.6 percent of the Hispanic population.</p>\n<p id=\"b350-8\">{\u00b6 34} Lal-Paterson also conducted Y-chromosome testing of swabs from the T-shirt\u2019s armpit. The result of this testing was a \u201cmixture,\u201d and the \u201cmajor contributor was consistent with Mr. Frazier or a paternal relative of his.\u201d LalPaterson testified that the percentage of the population that could be excluded as <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"145\">*145</page-number>a potential donor is 99.8 percent of the African-American population, 99.7 percent of the Caucasian population, and 99.3 percent of the Hispanic population.</p>\n<p id=\"b351-4\">{\u00b6 35} The defense presented no evidence during the trial phase.</p>\n<p id=\"b351-5\">\n<em>Case History</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b351-6\">{\u00b6 36} The grand jury indicted Frazier on one count of aggravated murder. Count 1 charged him with the aggravated murder of Stevenson while committing kidnapping, rape, aggravated arson or arson, aggravated robbery or robbery, aggravated burglary or burglary, or escape. Count 1 included death-penalty specifications for murder while committing, attempting to commit, or fleeing after committing aggravated robbery, R.C. 2929.04(A)(7), and murder while committing, attempting to commit, or fleeing after committing aggravated burglary, R.C. 2929.04(A)(7). Count 2 charged Frazier with aggravated robbery, and Count 3 charged him with aggravated burglary.</p>\n<p id=\"b351-7\">{\u00b6 37} Frazier pleaded not guilty to all charges. However, the jury found Frazier guilty of all charges and specifications, and he was sentenced to death.</p>\n<p id=\"b351-8\">{\u00b6 38} Frazier now appeals to this court as a matter of right.</p>\n<p id=\"b351-9\">\n<em>Pretrial and Guilt-Phase Issues</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b351-10\">{\u00b6 39} <em>Phrasing of voir dire questions. </em>In proposition of law III, Frazier argues that the trial court erred in advising prospective jurors during voir dire that if the law requires a death sentence, jurors must vote to impose death as a sentence, but if the law requires a life sentence, they must \u201cconsider\u201d voting for a life sentence. We find no merit to this argument.</p>\n<p id=\"b351-11\">{\u00b6 40} First, Frazier never objected at trial to the phrasing of these voir dire questions, and he thereby waived the issue absent plain error. <em>State v. Brinkley, </em>105 Ohio St.3d 231, 2005-Ohio-1507, 824 N.E.2d 959, \u00b6 64; <em>State v. Williams </em>(1977), 51 Ohio St.2d 112, 5 O.O.3d 98, 364 N.E.2d 1364, paragraph one of the syllabus.</p>\n<p id=\"b351-12\">{\u00b6 41} Second, no plain error occurred. During voir dire, each of the sitting jurors was questioned about his or her views of the death penalty. The voir dire of juror Benne typifies the court\u2019s line of questioning:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b351-13\">{\u00b6 42} \u201cTHE COURT: Are you religiously, philosophically, morally or otherwise opposed to the death penalty?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b351-14\">{\u00b6 43} \u201cMS. BENNE: No.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b351-15\">{\u00b6 44} \u201cTHE COURT: Okay. I take it then that you are saying that if, according to my instructions, you would find it appropriate to vote to impose the death penalty in a case, that you would do so?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b351-16\">{\u00b6 45} \u201cMS. BENNE: Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b352-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"146\">*146</page-number>{\u00b6 46} \u201cTHE COURT: On the other hand, I take it that if, according to my instructions, you find the imposition of the death penalty inappropriate, <em>you would consider </em>the three other sentencing options of life imprisonment with parole eligibility after serving a full 25 or 30 years or life imprisonment without parole?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b352-5\">{\u00b6 47} \u201cMS. BENNE: Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b352-6\">{\u00b6 48} \u201cTHE COURT: If you were a juror in the sentencing phase of the trial, would you automatically impose \u2014 vote to impose the sentence of death regardless of the facts of the case, or <em>would you consider all of the sentencing </em>options'?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b352-7\">{\u00b6 49} \u201cMS. BENNE: I would consider all of the options.\u201d (Emphasis added.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b352-8\">{\u00b6 50} Other sitting jurors were questioned in a similar fashion.</p>\n<p id=\"b352-9\">{\u00b6 51} The trial court\u2019s use of the term \u201cconsider\u201d referred to all of the sentencing options. The trial court frequently used the term \u201cconsider\u201d in referring to the choice of life-sentence options. But the trial court never suggested that the jurors may be required to vote for a death sentence, yet only \u201cconsider\u201d voting for one of the life sentences. Moreover, we rejected a similar complaint in <em>Brinkley, </em>105 Ohio St.3d 231, 2005-Ohio-1507, 824 N.E.2d 959, \u00b6 85: \u201cthe use of the term \u2018consider\u2019 in voir dire was not misleading or improper.\u201d Thus, we overrule proposition III.</p>\n<p id=\"b352-10\">{\u00b6 52} <em>Batson </em>challenges. In proposition of law II, Frazier asserts that the prosecutor peremptorily challenged two African-American prospective jurors because of their race, in violation of their equal protection rights under <em>Batson v. Kentucky </em>(1986), 476 U.S. 79, 106 S.Ct. 1712, 90 L.Ed.2d 69.</p>\n<p id=\"b352-11\">{\u00b6 53} During jury selection, the prosecutor peremptorily challenged two African-American prospective jurors, Franklin and Robinson. Frazier\u2019s counsel objected to the state\u2019s use of its peremptory challenges as a violation of <em>Batson.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b352-12\">{\u00b6 54} With regard to prospective juror Franklin, the state explained, \u201c[W]e excused her because she said on record during our one-on-one conference that she was morally opposed to the death penalty * * *. She did not rise to the level of cause but she was one of the people that was close to being cause, and we ask that she be excused.\u201d The trial court stated, \u201cWell, that is on the record. * * * And she is excused.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b352-13\">{\u00b6 55} As to prospective juror Robinson, the state provided two reasons for its peremptory challenge:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b352-14\">{\u00b6 56} \u201c[Prosecutor] MR. BRAUN: Yes. Well, Your Honor, a couple things. * * * One is a factual issue. We\u2019ll have testimony from a number of witnesses that the defendant was smoking crack cocaine on the night before the murder occurred. And this defendant [sic; venire member] is a recovering drug addict.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b353-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"147\">*147</page-number>{\u00b6 57} \u201cOur main concern, however, in moving for a challenge on him on a peremptory basis was based on his answers during the <em>Witherspoon </em>portion of the questioning- where he was unable to articulate whether or not he could actually impose capital punishment. He simply could not answer that question. He had to think about it, and he was the only potential juror who could not tell us one way or the other whether or not he could do it.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b353-5\">{\u00b6 58} \u201c * * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b353-6\">{\u00b6 59} \u201cTHE COURT: All right. * * * The <em>Batson </em>challenge is on the record. And we\u2019ll call the next juror. Thank you.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b353-7\">{\u00b6 60} Following jury selection, the trial court provided the following additional matters about the <em>Batson </em>challenges:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b353-8\">{\u00b6 61} \u201cTHE COURT: * * * [T]here were two <em>Batson </em>challenges yesterday. * * * One of the things I wanted to put on the record was that I did a review of the questionnaires that the entire venire answered, the 86 people that we actually talked to. And out of the 86, six people were African American.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b353-9\">{\u00b6 62} \u201cNow, some of those people * * * were released after our individual voir dire because of challenges or other complications. And I think that the final pool, we only had three in the final 44 that were African American.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b353-10\">{\u00b6 63} The trial court stated that the prospective jurors were randomly selected from the voter registration list, and the small number of African-Americans in this jury pool is \u201cjust one of those things that happened.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b353-11\">{\u00b6 64} \u201c \u2018A court adjudicates a <em>Batson </em>claim in three steps.\u2019 \u201d <em>State v. Bryan, </em>101 Ohio St.3d 272, 2004-Ohio-971, 804 N.E.2d 433, \u00b6 106, quoting <em>State v. Murphy </em>(2001), 91 Ohio St.3d 516, 528, 747 N.E.2d 765. \u201cFirst, the opponent of the peremptory challenge must make a prima facie case of racial discrimination. Second, if the trial court finds this requirement fulfilled, the proponent of the challenge must provide a racially neutral explanation for the challenge. <em>Batson, </em>476 U.S. at 96-98, 106 S.Ct. 1712, 90 L.Ed.2d 69.\u201d Id. Third, the trial court must decide, based on all the circumstances, whether the opponent has proved purposeful racial discrimination. <em>Batson </em>at 98, 106 S.Ct. 1712, 90 L.Ed.2d 69.

Dretke </em>(2005), 545 U.S. 231, 251-252, 125 S.Ct. 2317, 162 L.Ed.2d 196. If the trial court determines that the proffered reason is merely pretextual and that a racial motive is in fact behind the challenge, the juror may not be excluded. Id. at 252, 125 S.Ct. 2317, 162 L.Ed.2d 196.</p>\n<p id=\"b354-4\">{\u00b6 66} In his first argument, Frazier invokes <em>Miller-El v. Dretke </em>in arguing that the prosecutor\u2019s reasons for peremptorily challenging Franklin and Robinson were simply a pretext for discrimination. In <em>Miller-El, </em>the Supreme Court outlined the type of evidence to be considered and the analysis to be used to assess a <em>Batson </em>claim. During jury selection in <em>Miller-El, </em>prosecutors used peremptory challenges to exclude ten African-American prospective jurors, and the trial court overruled defense claims that the challenges were racially motivated. Id. at 236, 125 S.Ct. 2317, 162 L.Ed.2d 196. The Supreme Court reversed and held that the totality of the evidence showed that the prosecutor\u2019s race-neutral reasons for the peremptory challenges of two potential jurors were so at odds with the evidence that pretext is the fair conclusion. Id. at 265-266, 125 S.Ct. 2317, 162 L.Ed.2d 196.</p>\n<p id=\"b354-5\">{\u00b6 67} In <em>Miller-El, </em>the court found several disturbing factors that together showed that the prosecutor\u2019s reasons for challenging African-American jurors were pretextual: (1) the \u201cbare statistics,\u201d which showed that of the 20 African-Americans on the 108-person venire, only one served, and ten African-Americans were peremptorily struck by the prosecution, <em>Miller-El, </em>545 U.S. at 240-241, 125 S.Ct. 2317, 162 L.Ed.2d 196; (2) the similarity of answers to voir dire questions by African-American jurors who were peremptorily challenged and answers by non-African-American prospective jurors who were allowed to serve, id. at 241-252, 125 S.Ct. 2317, 162 L.Ed.2d 196; (3) the broader patterns of practice, which included jury shuffling,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> id. at 253, 125 S.Ct. 2317, 162 L.Ed.2d 196; (4) disparate questioning of African-American and non-African-American jurors, id. at 255-260, 125 S.Ct. 2317, 162 L.Ed.2d 196; and (5) evidence that the district attorney\u2019s office had historically discriminated against African-Americans in jury selection, id. at 263-264, 125 S.Ct. 2317, 162 L.Ed.2d 196.</p>\n<p id=\"b354-6\">{\u00b6 68} Two <em>Miller-El </em>factors are not present in Frazier\u2019s case. The state did not engage in jury shuffling, and there is no evidence that the Lucas County prosecutor\u2019s office has historically discriminated against African-Americans in the jury-selection process.</p>\n<p id=\"b355-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"149\">*149</page-number>{\u00b6 69} Frazier\u2019s claims are also not supported by the \u201cbare statistics.\u201d The absence of African-Americans on Frazier\u2019s jury resulted from the few African-Americans randomly selected for the original jury pool. There were six African-Americans out of 86 prospective jurors in the original jury pool for Frazier\u2019s trial. There were only three African-Americans out of a final jury pool of 44 prospective jurors. The prosecution exercised five of its six peremptory challenges, and two of these were against African-Americans. The record is unclear as to what happened to the third African-American juror. Thus, the statistics do not establish that the state had a discriminatory intent in peremptorily challenging Franklin and Robinson.</p>\n<p id=\"b355-4\">{\u00b6 70} There is also no evidence of disparate questioning of African-American and non-African-American jurors. In <em>Miller-El, </em>the prosecutor made prefatory statements cast in general terms to non-African-American prospective jurors, but he used a more graphic script describing in detail the method of execution to African-American prospective jurors. <em>Miller-El, </em>545 U.S. at 258, 125 S.Ct. 2317, 162 L.Ed.2d 196. The Supreme Court held that the use of the graphic script to a higher proportion of blacks than whites provided further evidence that the prosecution wanted blacks off the jury. Id. at 260, 125 S.Ct. 2317, 162 L.Ed.2d 196. Here, there is no evidence that the prosecutor posed a different type of question to Franklin and Robinson than to the other jurors. Rather, the prosecutor asked questions based upon a juror\u2019s previous answers, such as Franklin\u2019s statement that she was morally opposed to the death penalty.</p>\n<p id=\"b355-5\">{\u00b6 71} Frazier argues that the state\u2019s reasons for excluding Franklin and Robinson (e.g., their uneasiness about the death penalty) were improper because other jurors also expressed uneasiness about the death penalty, but were not peremptorily challenged. In <em>Miller-El, </em>the Supreme Court held: \u201cIf a prosecutor\u2019s proffered reason for striking a black panelist applies just as well to an otherwise-similar nonblack who is permitted to serve, that is evidence tending to prove purposeful discrimination to be considered at <em>Batson\u2019s </em>third step.\u201d <em>Miller-El, </em>545 U.S. at 241, 125 S.Ct. 2317, 162 L.Ed.2d 196. Thus, a comparison of the voir dire answers of Franklin and Robinson with the individuals who served on Frazier\u2019s jury is required.</p>\n<p id=\"b355-6\">{\u00b6 72} <em>Prospective juror Franklin. </em>During voir dire, Franklin said that she was opposed to the death penalty on moral grounds. However, Franklin stated that she could set aside her moral views, follow the trial court\u2019s instructions, and vote to impose the death penalty if appropriate. During the prosecutor\u2019s questioning, Franklin stated that she opposed the death penalty because evidence might later show that the accused was innocent. During voir dire, the following exchange occurred between the prosecutor and Franklin:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b356-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"150\">*150</page-number>{\u00b6 73} \u201c[Prosecutor] MR. BRAUN: Okay. And Miss Franklin * * * if we get to this stage you\u2019re going to have four sentencing options, life with 25 full years in prison without the chance of parole, * * * life with 30 years, * * * life without parole, or the death penalty. <em>The way you feel about capital punishment, you\u2019re really going to consider all the life verdicts first?</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b356-5\">{\u00b6 74} \u201cMS. FRANKLIN: <em>Yes, I will.</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b356-6\">{\u00b675} \u201cMR. BRAUN: Okay. And those are the verdicts you\u2019re much more comfortable with than the death penalty; isn\u2019t that right?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b356-7\">{\u00b6 76} \u201cMS. FRANKLIN: Yes, I am.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b356-8\">{\u00b6 77} \u201cMR. BRAUN: And this is just based on your personal beliefs here that the death penalty is something you would just not consider unless \u2014 -if you had one of the life verdicts available to you. Would that be fair, ma\u2019am?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b356-9\">{\u00b6 78} \u201cMS. FRANKLIN: Yes.\u201d (Emphasis added.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b356-10\">{\u00b6 79} Afterwards, the prosecutor challenged Franklin for cause because her moral opposition to the death penalty \u201csubstantially impairs her ability to fairly consider the death penalty as an option.\u201d The trial court overruled this challenge.</p>\n<p id=\"b356-11\">{\u00b6 80} During voir dire, ten of the sitting jurors told the court that they were not religiously, philosophically, or morally opposed to the death penalty. Juror Wagner stated that he felt \u201c[n]either way\u201d about the death penalty, but would vote for the death penalty, if appropriate.</p>\n<p id=\"b356-12\">{\u00b6 81} Juror Schoch was the only sitting juror who stated that she did not believe in the death penalty. But Schoch\u2019s responses differed markedly from Franklin\u2019s. Schoch\u2019s opinion was based on her view that life without parole was sometimes a worse sentence than death. Schoch also expressed no preference for a life sentence over a death sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b356-13\">{\u00b6 82} We find that the comparison of Franklin\u2019s responses with the sitting jurors\u2019 responses does not support Frazier\u2019s pretext claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b356-14\">{\u00b6 83} <em>Prospective juror Robinson. </em>As discussed, Robinson was peremptorily challenged because of his inability to articulate his views about the death penalty and his history of crack cocaine use. Robinson told the trial court that he was \u201cnot sure\u201d about his views of the death penalty. When asked whether he could follow the trial court\u2019s instructions about the death penalty, Robinson stated, \u201cIf you gave me instructions * * * it would probably depend on the evidence I got before that.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b356-15\">{\u00b6 84} The prosecutor also asked Robinson whether he could follow the court\u2019s instructions on the death penalty:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b357-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"151\">*151</page-number>{\u00b6 85} \u201c[Prosecutor] MR. BRAUN: * * * And what I\u2019m going to ask you, sir, is could you sign your name in ink on a verdict form saying somebody should be executed for a crime they committed? Could you take that kind of responsibility?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b357-4\">{\u00b6 86} \u201cMR. ROBINSON: I\u2019d have to go back, I\u2019d have to fully hear out all the facts presented to me.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b357-5\">{\u00b6 87} \u201c * * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b357-6\">{\u00b6 88} \u201cMR. BRAUN: Okay. <em>Do you think you could make that decision if you thought it was warranted by the law and the facts </em>?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b357-7\">{\u00b689} \u201cMR. ROBINSON: <em>If the facts fairly came, I wouldn\u2019t know. </em>I really haven\u2019t got that far. I have to go through it to be convinced before I can even say anything that might * * *, I guess, affect me from knowing \u2014 I don\u2019t want to make that type of decision.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b357-8\">{\u00b6 90} \u201cMR. BRAUN: Is this the kind of decision you don\u2019t want any part of, Mr. Robinson?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b357-9\">{\u00b6 91} \u201cMR. ROBINSON: I would say yes to that.\u201d (Emphasis added.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b357-10\">{\u00b6 92} As to drugs, the prosecutor asked Robinson and several other jurors whether friends or family members had \u201cbeen affected by drugs.\u201d Robinson said, \u201cI was an alcoholic and a drug addict.\u201d He added, \u201cIn 1979 I retired from Chrysler and I went to Flower Hospital and I\u2019ve been in sobriety ever since going through their step program.\u201d Robinson said he has been sober \u201c[g]oing on 26 years\u201d but still attends rehabilitation meetings.</p>\n<p id=\"b357-11\">{\u00b6 93} Several of the sitting jurors indicated that friends or family members used drugs. However, none of these jurors indicated that they had used drugs.</p>\n<p id=\"b357-12\">{\u00b6 94} Unlike sitting jurors, Robinson never clearly articulated whether he could follow the trial court\u2019s instructions and vote for the death penalty. Moreover, Robinson had been a drug addict, unlike the sitting jurors. Thus, Robinson\u2019s voir dire answers were different from the answers provided by sitting jurors.</p>\n<p id=\"b357-13\">{\u00b6 95} Viewed as <em>Miller-El </em>directs, the record does not support Frazier\u2019s claim that the prosecution\u2019s race-neutral reasons for striking Franklin and Robinson were pretextual.</p>\n<p id=\"b357-14\">{\u00b6 96} In his second argument, Frazier claims that the prosecutor failed to question Franklin and Robinson about the underlying basis for peremptorily challenging them, which shows that the state\u2019s reasons for the peremptory challenges were a pretext. This claim has no merit. The record shows that the prosecutor questioned Franklin and Robinson on their views about the death penalty. The prosecutor also questioned Robinson about his history of addiction and alcohol abuse before peremptorily challenging him.</p>\n<p id=\"b358-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"152\">*152</page-number>{\u00b6 97} In his third argument, Frazier asserts that the prosecutor\u2019s failure to challenge Robinson for cause because he was a recovering drug addict shows that the state\u2019s use of his drug addiction as a reason for its peremptory challenge was pretextual. However, this argument has no merit because the \u201cprosecutor\u2019s explanation [for a peremptory challenge] need not rise to the level justifying exercise of a challenge for cause.\u201d <em>Batson, </em>476 U.S. at 97, 106 S.Ct. 1712, 90 L.Ed.2d 69.</p>\n<p id=\"b358-5\">{\u00b6 98} Finally, Frazier contends that the trial court\u2019s failure to make findings in connection with its ruling requires reversal. Certainly, more thorough findings by the trial court in denying the defense <em>Batson </em>objections would have been helpful. However, the trial court is not compelled to make detailed factual findings to comply with <em>Batson. </em>See <em>Miller-El v. Cockrell </em>(2003), 537 U.S. 322, 347, 123 S.Ct. 1029, 154 L.Ed.2d 931 (\u201ca state court need not make detailed findings addressing all the evidence before it\u201d to render a proper <em>Batson </em>ruling). \u201cAs long as a trial judge affords the parties a reasonable opportunity to make their respective records, he may express his <em>Batson </em>ruling on the credibility of a proffered race-neutral explanation in the form of a clear rejection or acceptance of a <em>Batson </em>challenge.\u201d <em>Messiah v. Duncan </em>(C.A.2, 2006), 435 F.3d 186, 198. Thus, no error was committed in ruling on Frazier\u2019s two <em>Batson </em>challenges, because the trial court clearly rejected them.</p>\n<p id=\"b358-6\">{\u00b6 99} Based on the foregoing, we overrule proposition II.</p>\n<p id=\"b358-7\">{\u00b6 100} <em>Outside contact with juror. </em>In proposition of law VI, Frazier argues that the trial court erred by failing to dismiss juror Kennedy because she had been approached by a relative of one of the state\u2019s witnesses. In the alternative, Frazier argues that his counsel were ineffective by failing to request that juror Kennedy be dismissed from the jury.</p>\n<p id=\"b358-8\">{\u00b6 101} Before guilt-phase opening statements, juror Kennedy notified the bailiff that someone had approached her at a softball game and asked whether she was on jury duty. The trial court then conducted an in-chambers hearing to determine whether improper contact had occurred.</p>\n<p id=\"b358-9\">{\u00b6 102} Juror Kennedy informed the court that on the previous evening, she was playing in a softball game for her employer\u2019s team. One of the players, whose name she did not know, approached her and asked, \u201cAre you on jury duty?\u201d Kennedy replied, \u201cYes, but I\u2019m not allowed to discuss it.\u201d He said, \u201cOh, okay,\u201d and \u201cput his hands like he understood and * * * backed away.\u201d He said nothing more to Kennedy for the rest of the game. Kennedy later learned that Tim Gangway was the person who approached her and that Gangway\u2019s wife and Kennedy worked for the same employer. Tim is the brother of Bill Gangway, the victim\u2019s boyfriend.</p>\n<p id=\"b359-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"153\">*153</page-number>{\u00b6 103} Kennedy said that she is not close to Tim or his wife. Kennedy stated that she did not feel intimidated, threatened, or uncomfortable because of this conversation. She added that this experience did not compromise her ability to be a fair and impartial juror.</p>\n<p id=\"b359-4\">{\u00b6 104} Tim\u2019s version of the events echoed Kennedy\u2019s. Tim told the court that he had approached Kennedy after his wife told him that one of her co-workers might be on Frazier\u2019s jury. Tim talked to Kennedy because he was concerned that she might see the name \u201cGangway\u201d on the back of his jersey and make some connection with his brother, who was scheduled to testify in the case. Tim said he approached Kennedy, explaining, \u201cI didn\u2019t want it to cause any problems in the future.\u201d After finishing his explanation, the trial court admonished Tim not to have any kind of contact with the jurors, and he was excused.</p>\n<p id=\"b359-5\">{\u00b6 105} The trial court stated that Tim \u201cwas trying to do the right thing.\u201d The state and trial counsel agreed, both noting, \u201cWe\u2019re good.\u201d The trial court declared the matter resolved, and the trial continued.</p>\n<p id=\"b359-6\">{\u00b6 106} In cases involving outside influences on jurors, trial courts are granted \u201cbroad discretion\u201d in dealing with the contact and determining whether to declare a mistrial or to replace the affected juror. <em>State v. Phillips </em>(1995), 74 Ohio St.3d 72, 89, 656 N.E.2d 643. A trial court is permitted to rely on a juror\u2019s testimony in determining that juror\u2019s impartiality. <em>State v. Herring </em>(2002), 94 Ohio St.3d 246, 259, 762 N.E.2d 940. Moreover, issues concerning the weight given to the evidence and the credibility of the witnesses are primarily for the trier of fact. <em>State v. DeHass </em>(1967), 10 Ohio St.2d 230, 39 O.O.2d 366, 227 N.E.2d 212, paragraph one of the syllabus.</p>\n<p id=\"b359-7\">{\u00b6 107} Frazier argues that the trial court should have dismissed juror Kennedy and replaced her with an alternate because she might have had other conversations with Bill Gangway, Tim Gangway, or Tim\u2019s wife during the trial. Frazier also claims that no one knows the true impact of Tim\u2019s conversation on juror Kennedy. However, trial counsel expressed satisfaction with juror Kennedy\u2019s answers and did not challenge her. Thus, in the absence of plain error, this claim is waived. See <em>State v. Childs </em>(1968), 14 Ohio St.2d 56, 43 O.O.2d 119, 236 N.E.2d 545, paragraph three of the syllabus.</p>\n<p id=\"b359-8\">{\u00b6 108} We find no plain error. Frazier\u2019s claim that Kennedy might have had additional contact with Tim, his wife, or Bill Gangway is totally speculative. Nothing in the record supports this claim. Moreover, juror Kennedy said that she was not affected by Tim\u2019s contact, and the trial court could rely on her assurances.</p>\n<p id=\"b359-9\">{\u00b6 109} Frazier\u2019s alternative argument claiming that his counsel were ineffective by failing to challenge Kennedy also has no merit. Reversal of a conviction for ineffective assistance of counsel requires that the defendant show, first, that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"154\">*154</page-number>counsel\u2019s performance was deficient and, second, that the deficient performance prejudiced the defense so as to deprive the defendant of a fair trial. <em>Strickland v. Washington </em>(1984), 466 U.S. 668, 687, 104 S.Ct. 2052, 80 L.Ed.2d 674. Accord <em>State v. Bradley </em>(1989), 42 Ohio St.3d 136, 538 N.E.2d 373, paragraph two of the syllabus. Here, trial counsel were not deficient because nothing was said during Tim\u2019s brief conversation with Kennedy that would support a defense challenge. Based on the foregoing, proposition VI is rejected.</p>\n<p id=\"b360-5\">{\u00b6 110} <em>Failure to file motions to suppress. </em>In proposition of law V, Frazier argues that his counsel were ineffective by failing to file a motion to suppress his pretrial statements and a motion to suppress evidence seized from his apartment.</p>\n<p id=\"b360-6\">{\u00b6 111} <em>1. Frazier\u2019s pretrial statement. </em>Detective William Seymour testified that Frazier was advised of his <em>Miranda </em>rights prior to making a statement. Frazier waived his <em>Miranda </em>rights orally and in writing and agreed to provide a statement. The advisement and waiver of Frazier\u2019s <em>Miranda </em>rights were also videotaped. According to Detective Seymour, Frazier appeared to be clearheaded and did not appear to be under the influence of alcohol or drugs.</p>\n<p id=\"b360-7\">{\u00b6 112} A court, in determining whether a pretrial statement is involuntary, \u201c \u2018should consider the totality of the circumstances, including the age, mentality, and prior criminal experience of the accused; the length, intensity, and frequency of interrogation; the existence of physical deprivation or mistreatment; and the existence of threat or inducement.\u2019 \u201d <em>State v. Mason </em>(1998), 82 Ohio St.3d 144, 154, 694 N.E.2d 932, quoting <em>State v. Edwards </em>(1976) 49 Ohio St.2d 31, 3 O.O.3d 18, 358 N.E.2d 1051, paragraph two of the syllabus.</p>\n<p id=\"b360-8\">{\u00b6 113} Frazier claims that his statements were involuntary because of his low intelligence. However, mental deficiency is but one factor in the totality of circumstances to be considered in determining the voluntariness of a confession. A defendant\u2019s mental condition may be a \u201csignificant factor in the \u2018voluntariness\u2019 calculus. * * * But this fact does not justify a conclusion that a defendant\u2019s mental condition, by itself and apart from its relation to official coercion, should ever dispose of the inquiry into constitutional \u2018voluntariness.\u2019 \u201d <em>Colorado v. Connelly </em>(1986), 479 U.S. 157, 164, 107 S.Ct. 515, 93 L.Ed.2d 473. See <em>State v. Lynch, </em>98 Ohio St.3d 514, 2003-Ohio-2284, 787 N.E.2d 1185, \u00b6 55-57.</p>\n<p id=\"b360-9\">{\u00b6 114} Frazier has failed to demonstrate that his counsel were ineffective by failing to file a motion to suppress his pretrial statement because of his mental deficiencies. First, there is no evidence of police coercion or overreaching rendering Frazier\u2019s statement involuntary. Absent such evidence, counsel had no basis to request suppression of Frazier\u2019s statements.</p>\n<p id=\"b360-10\">{\u00b6 115} Second, there is no evidence that Frazier was incapable of making a voluntary statement. Frazier was found competent to stand trial. In his evaluation, Dr. Gregory Forgac, a clinical psychologist, reported, \u201cFrazier did <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"155\">*155</page-number>surprisingly well in responding to my questions. He was able to converse with me appropriately and he appeared capable of understanding the nature and objectives of the proceedings which have been brought against him.\u201d In a subsequent evaluation, Dr. Forgac determined that Frazier was not mentally retarded and that his intellectual functioning was within the upper range of borderline intellectual functioning.</p>\n<p id=\"b361-4\">{\u00b6 116} Frazier\u2019s behavior during the police interview also belies his claim that his pretrial statements were involuntary because of his low intelligence. His videotaped statements show that Frazier comprehended the investigators\u2019 questions, and he was able to express his thoughts and recall his actions in a rational manner.</p>\n<p id=\"b361-5\">{\u00b6 117} Moreover, trial counsel appear to have made a tactical decision not to challenge Frazier\u2019s statement because the introduction of Frazier\u2019s statement allowed the jury to hear Frazier\u2019s proclamations of innocence. In his statements, Frazier persistently denied any sexual contact with the victim, denied taking any of her property, and denied any responsibility for her death. The introduction of Frazier\u2019s statements meant that counsel had the benefit of having Frazier\u2019s exculpatory explanation of events in evidence, without the risk of having Frazier take the stand in his own defense and subject himself to cross-examination. See <em>State v. Adams, </em>103 Ohio St.3d 508, 2004-Ohio-5845, 817 N.E.2d 29, \u00b6 32-34 (not contesting a voluntary and exculpatory pretrial statement is a matter of trial strategy and is not ineffective assistance).</p>\n<p id=\"b361-6\">{\u00b6 118} Frazier argues that the prosecutor\u2019s concern about Frazier\u2019s low intelligence should have alerted trial counsel to file a motion to suppress. This argument also has no merit. During a pretrial hearing, Frazier\u2019s trial counsel, Mark Berling, mentioned that Frazier\u2019s \u201climited abilities in abstract thinking\u201d hindered defense efforts to reach a plea agreement with the state. In response, the prosecutor stated, <em>\u201c[BJased upon what Mark\u2019s saying, </em>I have an ongoing concern that his client may not be able to knowingly, intelligently and voluntarily enter into a plea.\u201d The prosecutor\u2019s concerns were based on trial counsel\u2019s description of Frazier\u2019s mental problems. The prosecutor\u2019s comments did not alert the defense to any new information about Frazier\u2019s mental deficiencies that should have led them to file a motion to suppress.</p>\n<p id=\"b361-7\">{\u00b6 119} <em>2. Search of Frazier\u2019s apartment. </em>On March 4, 2004, investigators executed a search warrant for Frazier\u2019s apartment. The police seized two white T-shirts that were the same size and brand as the bloody T-shirt found in the trash.</p>\n<p id=\"b361-8\">{\u00b6 120} Frazier argues that his counsel were ineffective by failing to file a motion to suppress the search warrant because of his mental deficiencies. Nothing in the record suggests that the search warrant was defective, and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"156\">*156</page-number>Frazier presents no evidence that his mental deficiencies had any bearing on the issuance of the search warrant. Based on the foregoing, we overrule proposition V.</p>\n<p id=\"b362-5\">{\u00b6 121} <em>Sealing the prosecutor\u2019s file. </em>In proposition of law XI, Frazier argues that the trial court erred by refusing the defense request to have the prosecutor\u2019s file sealed for appellate review.</p>\n<p id=\"b362-6\">{\u00b6 122} The defense filed a pretrial motion requesting that a complete copy of the prosecutor\u2019s file be made, turned over to the trial court to review, and sealed for appellate review. The defense argued this was necessary to ensure the complete disclosure of exculpatory and impeachment evidence, as required by <em>Brady v. Maryland </em>(1963), 373 U.S. 83, 83 S.Ct. 1194, 10 L.Ed.2d 215. The trial court denied this motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b362-7\">{\u00b6 123} The trial court was not required to examine or seal the prosecutor\u2019s file based on speculation that the prosecutor <em>might </em>have withheld exculpatory evidence. <em>State v. Hancock, </em>108 Ohio St.3d 57, 2006-Ohio-160, 840 N.E.2d 1032, \u00b6 64; <em>State v. Hanna, </em>95 Ohio St.3d 285, 2002-Ohio-2221, 767 N.E.2d 678, \u00b6 60. The prosecutor provided the defense with open-file discovery and was fully aware of his continuing obligation to divulge exculpatory evidence. Thus, we reject proposition XI.</p>\n<p id=\"b362-8\">{\u00b6 124} <em>Expert qualifications. </em>In proposition of law XVI, Frazier claims that the trial court erred by allowing Brian Bowen to testify about DNA test results without determining that he was qualified to testify as an expert.</p>\n<p id=\"b362-9\">{\u00b6 125} At trial, Bowen testified that DNA testing identified Stevenson\u2019s DNA on the knife blade and the bloody T-shirt recovered from the trash. Bowen also identified Frazier\u2019s DNA on the T-shirt. While the state never formally tendered Bowen as an expert, trial counsel never objected to his testimony or challenged his qualifications. Thus, Frazier waived all but plain error. <em>State v. Brinkley, </em>105 Ohio St.3d 231, 2005-Ohio-1507, 824 N.E.2d 959, \u00b6 112.</p>\n<p id=\"b362-10\">{\u00b6 126} No plain error occurred. Bowen, a forensic scientist, testified that he had worked at the DNA serology unit at BCI for approximately five years. Bowen holds a bachelor\u2019s degree in biology from Wittenberg University and a master\u2019s degree in immunology from Ohio State University. He is also a member of the American Academy of Forensic Sciences and the Midwestern Association of Forensic Scientists. Bowen maintains his qualifications by taking biannual proficiency tests in DNA. He testified that he has analyzed thousands of DNA samples during his career.</p>\n<p id=\"b362-11\">{\u00b6 127} Under Evid.R. 702(B), Bowen \u201cqualified as an expert by specialized knowledge, skill, experience, training, or education\u201d to testify as a forensic scientist about DNA test procedures and DNA test results. Based on his <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"157\">*157</page-number>qualifications, the state\u2019s failure to tender him as an expert was of no legal consequence. See <em>State v. Hartman </em>(2001), 93 Ohio St.3d 274, 285-286, 754 N.E.2d 1150. Thus, we overrule proposition XVI.</p>\n<p id=\"b363-5\">{\u00b6 128} In proposition of law XVII, Frazier argues that his counsel were ineffective by failing to object to Bowen\u2019s DNA testimony because he was not qualified as an expert witness. However, his counsel were not deficient by failing to object, because Bowen was qualified to testify as an expert in DNA analysis. Moreover, by not challenging Bowen\u2019s qualifications, trial counsel avoided inviting the prosecutor to ask questions that might bolster Bowen\u2019s qualifications in the eyes of the jury. See <em>State v. Thomas, </em>97 Ohio St.3d 309, 2002-Ohio-6624, 779 N.E.2d 1017, \u00b6 51. Given the strong presumption that counsel\u2019s performance constituted reasonable assistance, we conclude that trial counsel\u2019s actions may have been tactical decisions, and we reject this claim of ineffectiveness. See <em>State v. Bradley, </em>42 Ohio St.3d at 144, 538 N.E.2d 373. Proposition XVII is overruled.</p>\n<p id=\"b363-6\">{\u00b6 129} <em>Rape evidence. </em>In proposition of law VII, Frazier argues that the trial court erred by permitting evidence that the victim suffered vaginal injuries and a bruised cervix because he was not charged with rape or any other sexual offenses. He also contends that the prosecutor committed misconduct during his closing argument by arguing that the victim was raped.</p>\n<p id=\"b363-7\">{\u00b6 130} Count one in the indictment alleged that Frazier \u201cdid purposely cause the death of another while committing or attempting to commit * * * kidnapping, <em>rape, </em>aggravated arson or arson, aggravated robbery or robbery, aggravated burglary or burglary, or escape.\u201d (Emphasis added.) In a motion in limine, the defense sought to prohibit the introduction at trial of \u201cany evidence of alleged sexual activity and/or conduct of defendant.\u201d During a pretrial hearing on this motion, the prosecutor informed the court that \u201crape is one of the theories underlying the aggravated murder.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b363-8\">{\u00b6 131} During the state\u2019s case-in-chief, Detective Schriefer testified that at the crime scene, the victim\u2019s nightgown was tucked into her underpants. Dr. Beisser testified that during the victim\u2019s autopsy, abrasions and lacerations were found on the vagina, and bruising was found on the cervix. Dr. Beisser stated that the vaginal trauma was consistent with vaginal intercourse, but she could not determine whether the victim had been raped. DNA test results were also introduced identifying Frazier as the source of a pubic hair found on the victim\u2019s arm.</p>\n<p id=\"b363-9\">{\u00b6 132} During the state\u2019s guilt-phase closing argument, the prosecutor argued that vaginal injuries, trauma to the cervix, and the presence of Frazier\u2019s pubic hair on the victim\u2019s arm showed that Frazier had raped Stevenson. The <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"158\">*158</page-number>prosecutor also argued that sex was one of Frazier\u2019s motives for breaking into Stevenson\u2019s apartment and attacking her.</p>\n<p id=\"b364-5\">{\u00b6 133} After its motion in limine, the defense did not renew its objections at trial to the introduction of evidence of rape or the prosecutor\u2019s closing argument about rape and thus waived all but plain error. See <em>Gable v. Gates Mills, </em>103 Ohio St.3d 449, 2004-Ohio-5719, 816 N.E.2d 1049, \u00b6 34 (\u201ca ruling on a motion in limine may not be appealed and * * * objections * * * must be made during the trial to preserve evidentiary rulings for appellate review\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b364-6\">{\u00b6 134} Frazier claims that evidence of rape was evidence of another crime that was not admissible under Evid.R. 404(B). Under Evid.R. 404(B), \u201c[e]vidence of <em>other crimes, wrongs, or acts </em>is not admissible to prove\u201d a defendant\u2019s character as to criminal propensity. (Emphasis added.) Frazier\u2019s argument can be rejected because evidence of rape is not evidence of another crime, but proof of one of the underlying felonies for the felony-murder charge. Thus, the state was entitled to present police and expert testimony showing that Stevenson was raped at the time of her murder. Moreover, even if rape had not been charged as one of the underlying felonies, rape evidence would be admissible under Evid.R. 404(B) to prove Frazier\u2019s possible motive for committing the murder. See <em>State v. Brinkley, </em>105 Ohio St.3d 231, 2005-Ohio-1507, 824 N.E.2d 959, \u00b6 34.</p>\n<p id=\"b364-7\">{\u00b6 135} Frazier\u2019s claim that the prosecutor committed misconduct during his closing argument by arguing that Frazier raped Stevenson is also rejected. A prosecutor is \u201centitled to latitude as to what the evidence has shown and what inferences can reasonably be drawn from the evidence.\u201d <em>State v. Smith </em>(1997), 80 Ohio St.3d 89, 111, 684 N.E.2d 668. Thus, the prosecutor committed no plain error in arguing that the evidence showed that Frazier had murdered Stevenson while committing or attempting to commit rape.</p>\n<p id=\"b364-8\">{\u00b6 136} Finally, we reject the defense argument that rape evidence improperly prejudiced Frazier during the penalty phase. First, the trial court excluded photographs of vaginal trauma before the start of the penalty phase. Second, the prosecutor made no reference to rape evidence during his penalty-phase closing argument. Finally, the trial court\u2019s instructions on the aggravating circumstances correctly identified aggravated murder committed during an aggravated robbery and aggravated murder committed during an aggravated burglary as the only two aggravating circumstances for the jury to consider during its penalty-phase deliberations.</p>\n<p id=\"b364-9\">{\u00b6 137} Based on the foregoing, we reject proposition VII.</p>\n<p id=\"b364-10\">{\u00b6 138} <em>Defendant\u2019s absence. </em>In proposition of law XVIII, Frazier argues that the trial court\u2019s failure to secure his presence or obtain a waiver of his presence at various in-chambers discussions and legal conferences violated his constitutional rights to confrontation and due process.</p>\n<p id=\"b365-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"159\">*159</page-number>{\u00b6 139} An accused has a fundamental right to be present at all critical stages of his criminal trial. Section 10, Article I, Ohio Constitution; Crim.R. 43(A). An accused\u2019s absence, however, does not necessarily result in prejudicial or constitutional error. \u201c[T]he presence of a defendant is a condition of due process to the extent that a fair and just hearing would be thwarted by his absence, <em>and to that extent only.\u201d </em>(Emphasis added.) <em>Snyder v. Massachusetts </em>(1934), 291 U.S. 97, 107-108, 54 S.Ct. 330, 78 L.Ed. 674.</p>\n<p id=\"b365-6\">{\u00b6 140} In <em>United States v. Gagnon </em>(1985), 470 U.S. 522, 527, 105 S.Ct. 1482, 84 L.Ed.2d 486, the Supreme Court held that under certain circumstances, a defendant\u2019s absence from a hearing at which his counsel are present does not offend due process. In <em>Kentucky v. Stincer </em>(1987), 482 U.S. 730, 746, 107 S.Ct. 2658, 96 L.Ed.2d 631, the court found no due process or Confrontation Clause violation when an accused was excluded from a hearing on the competency of two child witnesses. See, e.g., <em>State v. Williams </em>(1983), 6 Ohio St.3d 281, 285-286, 6 OBR 345, 452 N.E.2d 1323 (absence at hearings can be harmless error).</p>\n<p id=\"b365-7\">{\u00b6 141} First, Frazier complains about his absence during in-chambers discussions among the court, defense counsel, and the state on March 16, 2004, and January 26, 2005. However, the record does not affirmatively establish Frazier\u2019s absence. <em>State v. Clark </em>(1988), 38 Ohio St.3d 252, 258, 527 N.E.2d 844 (\u201cthe record must affirmatively indicate the absence of a defendant or his counsel during a particular stage of the trial\u201d). Thus, this complaint lacks merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b365-8\">{\u00b6 142} Second, Frazier complains about his absence during an in-chambers discussion on March 17, 2005. During this session, counsel discussed motions that needed to be argued and decided that day. During a subsequent pretrial hearing, the defense counsel waived Frazier\u2019s presence on March 17. Even though the waiver was after the fact, counsel could have waived Frazier\u2019s presence during these in-chambers discussions. See, e.g., <em>State v. Brinkley, </em>105 Ohio St.3d 231, 2005-Ohio-1507, 824 N.E.2d 959, \u00b6 122. Moreover, Frazier suffered no prejudice, because his absence occurred during a discussion involving legal or scheduling issues within the professional competence of counsel. See <em>State v. McKnight, </em>107 Ohio St.3d 101, 2005-Ohio-6046, 837 N.E.2d 315, \u00b6 215; see, also, <em>United States v. Brown </em>(C.A.6, 1978), 571 F.2d 980, 987 (accused must establish prejudice from absence at in-chambers conference).</p>\n<p id=\"b365-9\">{\u00b6 143} Third, Frazier argues that his absence during an in-chambers discussion on April 27, 2005, violated his right to be present. However, the record shows that Frazier was present at these proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b365-10\">{\u00b6 144} Fourth, Frazier complains about his absence during an in-chambers conference on May 3, 2005. During this conference, the parties discussed the status of pretrial negotiations and scheduling issues. Frazier was in open court and did not object when the defense counsel waived Frazier\u2019s presence at the in-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"160\">*160</page-number>chambers conference. Thus, Frazier\u2019s presence was properly waived. See <em>United States v. Gagnon, </em>470 U.S. at 528, 105 S.Ct. 1482, 84 L.Ed.2d 486 (trial court \u201cneed not get an express \u2018on the record\u2019 waiver from the defendant for every trial conference which a defendant may have a right to attend\u201d); <em>United States v. Gallego </em>(C.A.2, 1999), 191 F.3d 156, 171 (waiver can be implied by accused\u2019s failure to object to exclusion).</p>\n<p id=\"b366-4\">{\u00b6 145} Fifth, Frazier objects to his absence during an in-chambers conference on May 11, 2005. During this conference, counsel for both sides talked with the judge about jury selection and excuses and the defendant\u2019s clothing at trial. The record does not show that Frazier\u2019s presence at the in-chambers conference was waived. Nevertheless, Frazier\u2019s absence was not prejudicial because the jury received neither testimony nor evidence, and no critical stage of the trial was involved.</p>\n<p id=\"b366-5\">{\u00b6 146} Sixth, Frazier argues that his absence during two off-the-record bench conferences violated his right to be present. However, no prejudice occurred because of the absence of evidence about the discussions during those bench conferences. See <em>State v. Tyler </em>(1990), 50 Ohio St.3d 24, 38, 553 N.E.2d 576.</p>\n<p id=\"b366-6\">{\u00b6 147} Seventh, Frazier objects to his absence during a conference on jury instructions. Trial counsel waived Frazier\u2019s presence at this conference. Moreover, Frazier\u2019s absence during the hearing on proposed jury instructions did not deprive him of a fair trial. <em>State v. Conway, </em>108 Ohio St.3d 214, 2006-Ohio-791, 842 N.E.2d 996, \u00b6 52.</p>\n<p id=\"b366-7\">{\u00b6 148} Finally, Frazier claims that his absence when a jury question was asked during deliberations constituted prejudicial error. During jury deliberations, the jury returned to the courtroom and asked whether a written copy of the coroner\u2019s report was submitted into evidence. Trial counsel waived Frazier\u2019s presence because \u201c[h]e was brought over and there was some difficulty in getting him in the mood to get dressed for Court * * Because counsel waived the defendant\u2019s presence, Frazier\u2019s claim lacks merit. Moreover, Frazier invited the error that he now complains about because his own behavior caused his absence from court. See <em>Hal Artz Lincoln-Mercury, Inc. v. Ford, Motor Co. </em>(1986), 28 Ohio St.3d 20, 28 OBR 83, 502 N.E.2d 590, paragraph one of the syllabus (a \u201cparty will not be permitted to take advantage of an error which he himself invited or induced\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b366-8\">{\u00b6 149} Based on the foregoing, we overrule proposition XVIII.</p>\n<p id=\"b366-9\">\n<em>Penalty-Phase Issues</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b366-10\">{\u00b6 150} <em>Mental retardation. </em>In proposition of law IV, Frazier asserts that he cannot be executed because he is mentally retarded. In the alternative, Frazier <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"161\">*161</page-number>argues that his counsel were ineffective by failing to present and preserve evidence of his mental retardation.</p>\n<p id=\"b367-4\">{\u00b6 151} In a pretrial motion, trial counsel requested that Frazier be examined to determine whether he is mentally retarded. On April 22, 2005, Frazier was evaluated by Dr. Gregory Forgac at the Court Diagnostic and Treatment Center in Toledo. Dr. Forgac administered the Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale-Third Edition (\u201cWAIS-III\u201d) test, which showed that Frazier had a verbal IQ of 81, a performance IQ of 73, and a full-scale IQ of 75. Dr. Forgac determined that Frazier is not mentally retarded.</p>\n<p id=\"b367-5\">{\u00b6 152} In a pretrial hearing on May 3, 2005, trial counsel withdrew the claim that Frazier is mentally retarded. The defense withdrawal was based on Dr. Forgac\u2019s report and trial counsel\u2019s \u201clengthy discussions with him and * * * Dr. Smalldon, who had initially seen Mr. Frazier.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b367-6\">{\u00b6 153} During mitigation, Dr. Jeffrey Smalldon, a clinical psychologist, testified that Frazier \u201cwas not mentally retarded.\u201d Dr. Smalldon also administered the WAIS-III test, which showed that Frazier has a \u201cverbal IQ estimate of 77, a performance or non-verbal IQ estimate of 72, and a full scale IQ estimate of 72.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b367-7\">{\u00b6 154} In <em>Atkins v. Virginia </em>(2002), 536 U.S. 304, 122 S.Ct. 2242, 153 L.Ed.2d 335, the United States Supreme Court held that executing a mentally retarded person violates the Eighth Amendment\u2019s proscription against cruel and unusual punishment. In advancing an <em>Atkins </em>claim, the defendant bears the burden of proving by a preponderance of the evidence that he or she (1) suffers from \u201csignificantly subaverage intellectual functioning,\u201d (2) experienced \u201csignificant limitations in two or more adaptive skills, such as communication, self-care, and self-direction,\u201d and (3) manifested \u201conset before the age of 18.\u201d <em>State v. Lott, </em>97 Ohio St.3d 303, 2002-Ohio-6625, 779 N.E.2d 1011, \u00b6 12. <em>Lott </em>also held that \u201cthere is a rebuttable presumption that a defendant is not mentally retarded if his or her IQ is above 70.\u201d Id.</p>\n<p id=\"b367-8\">{\u00b6 155} The state argues that Frazier waived this claim because the defense withdrew its <em>Atkins </em>motion at trial. We have not previously decided whether a capital defendant can waive an <em>Atkins </em>claim. However, a constitutional right can be waived in criminal cases by the failure to make timely assertion of it. <em>Peretz v. United States </em>(1991), 501 U.S. 923, 936-937, 111 S.Ct. 2661, 115 L.Ed.2d 808. Moreover, other jurisdictions have held that the failure to raise an <em>Atkins </em>claim results in waiver. <em>Bowling v. Commonwealth </em>(Ky.2005), 163 S.W.3d 361, 371; <em>Winston v. Commonwealth </em>(2004), 268 Va. 564, 617, 604 S.E.2d 21; <em>Head v. Hill </em>(2003), 277 Ga. 255, 259, 587 S.E.2d 613. Absent plain error, Frazier has waived his <em>Atkins </em>claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b367-9\">{\u00b6 156} Here, there is no error, plain or otherwise. After conducting comprehensive evaluations and administering a full battery of tests, Dr. Forgac and Dr. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"162\">*162</page-number>Smalldon determined that Frazier is not mentally retarded. Moreover, the results of two IQ tests showed that Frazier\u2019s IQ was above 70. Thus, Frazier has failed to meet his burden of proof to show that he is mentally retarded, as <em>Atkins </em>requires.</p>\n<p id=\"b368-5\">{\u00b6 157} Frazier argues that his IQ score of 72 has a margin of error of plus or minus five points, and so the score places him within the borderline mentally retarded range. Dr. Smalldon acknowledged that IQ tests have \u201csome wiggle room that goes about five points either way.\u201d However, Dr. Smalldon stated, \u201c[B]ased on everything that I\u2019ve learned about Mr. Frazier, I believe that those numbers [the IQ test results] are pretty good numbers, that those are pretty accurate numbers.\u201d Moreover, Dr. Forgac reported a \u201c95% confidence level\u201d that Frazier\u2019s IQ test results were accurate within a range of a 71 IQ and 80 IQ. See <em>In re Bowling </em>(C.A.6, 2005), 422 F.3d 434, 437; <em>United States v. Roane </em>(C.A.4, 2004), 378 F.3d 382, 409, quoting <em>United States v. Tipton </em>(May 1, 2003), E.D.Va. No. 3: 92CR68 (the psychologist\u2019s care in calculating an IQ score \u201c \u2018belies the suggestion that [the psychologist\u2019s] analysis did not account for possible variations in his testing instrument\u2019 \u201d). Thus, we reject Frazier\u2019s claim for a downward adjustment of his IQ score to within the borderline mentally retarded range.</p>\n<p id=\"b368-6\">{\u00b6 158} Second, Frazier claims that he is mentally retarded because he was awarded Social Security benefits in 1994 based on a diagnosis that he is mentally retarded. However, Frazier has presented neither the IQ test score nor the criteria that the Social Security officials used in making this diagnosis. See <em>State v. Waddy, </em>Franklin App. No. 05AP-866, 2006-Ohio-2828, 2006 WL 1530117, \u00b6 41 (distinguishing diagnosis of mental retardation made for purposes of receiving Social Security benefits from an <em>Atkins </em>claim).</p>\n<p id=\"b368-7\">{\u00b6 159} Finally, Frazier argues that he lived in subsidized housing for the elderly and disabled at the time of the murder, a circumstance revealing significant limitations in his adaptive skills. Frazier also contends that his poor grades in school, erratic employment history, failed marriage, and other poor relationships provide evidence of his limitations in adaptive skills. However, Frazier provides no support for these claims. Moreover, neither Dr. Forgac nor Dr. Smalldon found that Frazier has \u201c \u2018significant limitations in adaptive functioning in at least two * * * skill areas,\u2019 \u201d as <em>Atkins </em>requires. <em>Atkins, </em>536 U.S. at 309, 122 S.Ct. 2242, 153 L.Ed.2d 335, fn. 3, quoting American Psychiatric Association, Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (4th Ed.2000) 41.</p>\n<p id=\"b368-8\">{\u00b6 160} Based on the foregoing, we overrule Frazier\u2019s mental-retardation claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b369-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"163\">*163</page-number>{\u00b6 161} We also reject Frazier\u2019s argument that his counsel provided ineffective assistance by failing to present evidence that he is mentally retarded. See <em>Strickland v. Washington, </em>466 U.S. at 687, 104 S.Ct. 2052, 80 L.Ed.2d 674.</p>\n<p id=\"b369-6\">{\u00b6 162} First, Frazier\u2019s argument that his counsel were ineffective in withdrawing his mental-retardation claim because his IQ score of 72 had a margin of error of five points lacks merit. As previously discussed, Dr. Smalldon testified that Frazier\u2019s IQ score of 72 is a \u201cpretty accurate\u201d score.</p>\n<p id=\"b369-7\">{\u00b6 163} Second, Frazier\u2019s contention that his counsel failed to properly present evidence that he received Social Security benefits based on a diagnosis of mental retardation is also meritless. Frazier presented no evidence linking the criteria used for the Social Security diagnosis and his <em>Atkins </em>claim. Moreover, trial counsel\u2019s decision not to present the Social Security diagnosis represented a tactical decision because Dr. Smalldon and Dr. Forgac had found that Frazier is not mentally retarded.</p>\n<p id=\"b369-8\">{\u00b6 164} Third, we conclude that Frazier\u2019s counsel were not ineffective by failing to request a penalty-phase instruction about what the defense terms Frazier\u2019s \u201cstatus as a mentally retarded individual.\u201d His counsel were not deficient, because no evidence was presented during mitigation that Frazier is mentally retarded.</p>\n<p id=\"b369-9\">{\u00b6 165} Fourth, we reject Frazier\u2019s assertion that his counsel were ineffective by failing to consult with him before withdrawing the mental-retardation claim. During a hearing on May 9, 2005, Frazier told the trial court that he understood his counsel\u2019s reasons for withdrawing his motion for a court\u2019s determination of mental retardation. Frazier stated, \u201cI know what we\u2019re talking about and everything, I understand what he\u2019s saying, IQ and so forth and so on, yes.\u201d Frazier also said, \u201cI don\u2019t have a problem with\u201d the withdrawal of the motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b369-10\">{\u00b6 166} Finally, Frazier contends that his counsel were ineffective by failing to obtain the opinion from a mental-retardation expert, other than Dr. Smalldon and Dr. Forgac, before withdrawing the mental-retardation claim. Dr. Smalldon and Dr. Forgac are clinical psychologists who examined Frazier and determined that he is not mentally retarded. Frazier asserts that Dr. Smalldon and Dr. Forgac were not qualified to render an adequate opinion about mental retardation because they are not mental-retardation experts.</p>\n<p id=\"b369-11\">{\u00b6 167} Dr. Smalldon and Dr. Forgac were both fully qualified to render an opinion that Frazier is not mentally retarded. We note that Dr. Smalldon, the defense\u2019s own expert, has presented testimony about mental retardation in numerous capital cases. See <em>State v. Elmore, </em>111 Ohio St.3d 515, 2006-Ohio-6207, 857 N.E.2d 547, \u00b6 157-158; <em>State v. Ketterer, </em>111 Ohio St.3d 70, 2006-Ohio-5283, 855 N.E.2d 48, \u00b6 224; <em>State v. Thomas, </em>97 Ohio St.3d 309, 2002-Ohio-6624, 779 N.E.2d 1017, \u00b6 118. Thus, we find that counsel were not ineffective by failing to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"164\">*164</page-number>request the opinion of a third expert before withdrawing the mental-retardation claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b370-4\">{\u00b6 168} Based on the foregoing, we overrule proposition IV.</p>\n<p id=\"b370-5\">{\u00b6 169} <em>Prosecutorial misconduct. </em>In proposition of law X, Frazier argues that the prosecutor committed misconduct by arguing that Frazier should receive the death penalty even though the prosecutor had expressed concern about Frazier\u2019s mental capacity to enter a plea. However, trial counsel failed to object to the comments he now complains of and waived all but plain error. <em>State v. Slagle </em>(1992), 65 Ohio St.3d 597, 604, 605 N.E.2d 916.</p>\n<p id=\"b370-6\">{\u00b6 170} The test for prosecutorial misconduct during closing argument is whether the remarks were improper and, if so, whether they prejudicially affected the accused\u2019s substantial rights. <em>State v. Smith </em>(1984), 14 Ohio St.3d 13, 14, 14 OBR 317, 470 N.E.2d 883. To determine prejudice, the record must be reviewed in its entirety. <em>State v. Lott </em>(1990), 51 Ohio St.3d 160, 166, 555 N.E.2d 293.</p>\n<p id=\"b370-7\">{\u00b6 171} During a pretrial hearing on May 3, 2005, trial counsel stated that the defense was trying to negotiate a plea bargain. Counsel continued, \u201cMr. Frazier * * * has very limited abilities in abstract thinking, * * * and if we are going to reach a successful plea agreement, * * * I\u2019m going to need to be able to offer him something concrete other than the death penalty.\u201d Counsel added, \u201cI can\u2019t * * * [present him] with a range of options because he doesn\u2019t get the range of options. He will never understand that.\u201d Trial counsel conceded that Frazier had never expressed an interest in entering a guilty plea.</p>\n<p id=\"A4M\">{\u00b6 172} In response, the prosecutor stated, \u201cBut if we have somebody who can\u2019t plead or won\u2019t plead, there aren\u2019t very many options left to me.\u201d The prosecutor also said, \u201cWell, <em>based upon what [defense counsel] Mark\u2019s saying, </em>I have an ongoing concern that his client may not be able to knowingly, intelligently and voluntarily enter in to a plea.\u201d (Emphasis added.) Ultimately, pretrial negotiations were not successful.</p>\n<p id=\"b370-11\">{\u00b6 173} During the penalty-phase rebuttal argument, the prosecutor argued:</p>\n<p id=\"b370-12\">{\u00b6 174} \u201cWhat else do we have? He\u2019s one short step above mental retardation. He is. Probably the most critical question I asked Dr. Smalldon this morning was, What\u2019s the relationship between his IQ and committing [a] death penalty murder offense? And Dr. Smalldon answered honestly, there is no correlation. Some coldblooded killers have IQs of 120, some have IQs of 72 or 74.</p>\n<p id=\"b370-13\">{\u00b6 175} \u201cWhat\u2019s the point I\u2019m making here? He still had the ability to make other choices throughout his long life, and he chose not to make them.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b370-14\">{\u00b6 176} Frazier contends that the prosecutor\u2019s remarks about Frazier\u2019s ability to make choices constituted misconduct because the prosecutor knew that Frazier <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"165\">*165</page-number>was unable to make a complex decision. However, the prosecutor\u2019s argument was not error, plain or otherwise.</p>\n<p id=\"b371-4\">{\u00b6 177} The prosecutor\u2019s rebuttal comments responded to earlier defense arguments suggesting that Frazier\u2019s behavior was not a matter of choice. During final argument, defense counsel emphasized that Frazier is \u201ca short step above mental retardation,\u201d a crack cocaine addict, and an abuse victim. Trial counsel argued that Frazier \u201cdidn\u2019t have the tools to begin with * * * [and] it\u2019s extremely difficult, especially when you have these limited tools, * * * to break this cycle. And once that monster has its hands on you, you\u2019re going to be a monster and something like this is going to happen.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b371-5\">{\u00b6 178} The prosecutor\u2019s rebuttal simply pointed out the lack of correlation between Frazier\u2019s low IQ and the victim\u2019s murder. Thus, the prosecutor\u2019s rebuttal argument represented fair comment.</p>\n<p id=\"b371-6\">{\u00b6 179} Moreover, the prosecutor\u2019s pretrial concern about Frazier\u2019s ability to enter a plea did not bar the prosecutor from making this rebuttal argument. The prosecutor\u2019s pretrial comments were made in the context of <em>defense assertions </em>that Frazier was having problems understanding his plea options. However, Frazier was found competent to stand trial, and he is not mentally retarded. Thus, the prosecutor\u2019s earlier concerns about Frazier\u2019s abilities did not prevent the prosecutor from making this rebuttal argument. We reject proposition X.</p>\n<p id=\"b371-7\">{\u00b6 180} In proposition of law XIII, Frazier argues that the prosecutor committed misconduct during his penalty-phase closing rebuttal argument. However, the defense failed to object to the prosecutor\u2019s remarks and waived all but plain error. <em>State v. Slagle, </em>65 Ohio St.3d at 604, 605 N.E.2d 916.</p>\n<p id=\"b371-8\">{\u00b6 181} First, Frazier argues that the prosecutor\u2019s rebuttal argument improperly treated the nature and circumstances of the offense as an aggravating factor. Frazier complains about the following comments:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b371-9\">{\u00b6 182} \u201cLet\u2019s look at the other nature and circumstances of this offense. Let\u2019s talk about the victim for a second. He chose somebody who was more helpless than him. Sure he didn\u2019t bring the knife with him, but he brought his hands and he used those hands on her neck until she was this close to being dead and then he cut her throat. This is predatory behavior. That fits in with the lack of remorse, the failure to take responsibility for what he did, the efforts to throw off the police and all the lies he\u2019s told about this case. There\u2019s very little weight, due to the nature and circumstances of this offense, that go on the mitigation side of the scale.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b371-10\">{\u00b6 183} Although \u201cprosecutors cannot argue that the nature and circumstances of an offense are aggravating circumstances, the facts and circumstances of the offense must be examined to determine whether they are mitigating. R.C. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"166\">*166</page-number>2929.04(B). Thus, a prosecutor may legitimately refer to the nature and circumstances of the offense, both to refute any suggestion that they are mitigating and to explain why the specified aggravating circumstance[s] outweigh mitigating factors.\u201d <em>State v. Sheppard </em>(1998), 84 Ohio St.3d 230, 238, 703 N.E.2d 286.</p>\n<p id=\"b372-5\">{\u00b6 184} The prosecutor did not characterize any of the facts of the offense as aggravating circumstances. Rather, the prosecutor refuted trial counsel\u2019s argument suggesting that the nature and circumstances of the offense had mitigating aspects. Trial counsel had argued that Frazier \u201cdidn\u2019t go down there [i.e., to the victim\u2019s room] with his own knife. He didn\u2019t go down there attempting to inflict any harm at all.\u201d In response, the prosecutor pointed out that Frazier did not bring a knife to the victim\u2019s apartment because he strangled her. Thus, the prosecutor properly argued that the nature and circumstances of the offense were not mitigating. See <em>State v. Bryan, </em>101 Ohio St.3d 272, 2004-Ohio-971, 804 N.E.2d 433, \u00b6 178-179. Second, Frazier contends that the prosecutor committed misconduct by urging the jurors to reach a unanimous verdict. During his closing rebuttal argument, the prosecutor stated:</p>\n<p id=\"b372-6\">{\u00b6 185} \u201cIf you all go back there and just vote individual opinions, we haven\u2019t accomplished anything through the course of this trial. You need to go back there and talk about the weight of things and agree among the 12 of you what they weigh, and when you do that, ultimately we\u2019ve reached the right verdict here.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b372-7\">{\u00b6 186} Frazier argues that the prosecutor\u2019s argument undermined the trial court\u2019s instructions that a solitary juror may prevent a death-penalty recommendation. While the prosecutor\u2019s comments were not precise, isolated comments by a prosecutor are not to be taken out of context and given their most damaging meaning. <em>Donnelly v. DeChristoforo </em>(1974), 416 U.S. 637, 647, 94 S.Ct. 1868, 40 L.Ed.2d 431. This argument was not improper because the prosecutor was simply urging the jurors to deliberate before voting.</p>\n<p id=\"b372-8\">{\u00b6 187} Moreover, the trial court accurately instructed the jurors on the weighing process. The court also instructed the jurors that \u201c[o]ne juror may prevent a death penalty determination by finding that the aggravating circumstances do not outweigh the mitigating factors.\u201d Cf. <em>State v. Brooks </em>(1996), 75 Ohio St.3d 148, 160-162, 661 N.E.2d 1030. Thus, we find no plain error.</p>\n<p id=\"b372-9\">{\u00b6 188} For the foregoing reasons, we overrule proposition XIII.</p>\n<p id=\"b372-10\">{\u00b6 189} <em>Instructions. </em>In proposition of law I, Frazier argues that errors in the penalty-phase jury instructions violated his rights and require a new penalty hearing. However, except where noted, the defense failed to object and waived all but plain error. <em>State v. Underwood </em>(1983), 3 Ohio St.3d 12, 3 OBR 360, 444 N.E.2d 1332, syllabus.</p>\n<p id=\"b373-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"167\">*167</page-number>{\u00b6 190} First, Frazier argues that the trial court erred by refusing the defense request to instruct the jury to consider mercy in its deliberations. However, Frazier was not entitled to an instruction on mercy. <em>State v. Garner </em>(1995), 74 Ohio St.3d 49, 57, 656 N.E.2d 623; <em>State v. Lorraine </em>(1993), 66 Ohio St.3d 414, 417, 613 N.E.2d 212.</p>\n<p id=\"b373-4\">{\u00b6 191} Second, Frazier asserts that the trial court erred by failing to instruct the jury to consider each aggravating circumstance separately. Frazier was convicted on one murder count and two attached aggravating circumstances. During penalty-phase instructions, the trial court instructed the jury to weigh the two aggravating circumstances (murder during an aggravated robbery and murder during an aggravated burglary) against the mitigating factors. Contrary to Frazier\u2019s assertion, \u201c[a]ggravating circumstances in a single count are considered collectively in assessing the penalty for that count, and a defendant is sentenced only on individual criminal counts, not on specifications of aggravating circumstances.\u201d <em>State v. Hessler </em>(2000), 90 Ohio St.3d 108, 126, 734 N.E.2d 1237. Thus, no plain error was committed in giving these instructions.</p>\n<p id=\"b373-5\">{\u00b6 192} Third, without citation to authority, Frazier claims that the trial court should have instructed that the state has to prove that the aggravating factors outweigh the mitigating factors beyond a reasonable doubt. This argument has no merit because the trial court\u2019s instruction on the burden of proof followed the language in R.C. 2929.03(D)(1) and (D)(2). See <em>State v. Jackson, </em>107 Ohio St.3d 53, 2005-Ohio-5981, 836 N.E.2d 1173, \u00b6 100.</p>\n<p id=\"b373-6\">{\u00b6 193} Fourth, Frazier asserts that the trial court erred in instructing the jury that \u201c[mjitigating factors are factors that lessen the moral culpability of the defendant * * *.\u201d Mitigation is not about blame or culpability, but rather about punishment. See <em>State v. Holloway </em>(1988), 38 Ohio St.3d 239, 527 N.E.2d 831, paragraph one of the syllabus. Nevertheless, the overall penalty-phase instructions informed the jury that the issue was punishment, not culpability. See <em>State v. Bey </em>(1999), 85 Ohio St.3d 487, 498, 709 N.E.2d 484.</p>\n<p id=\"b373-7\">{\u00b6 194} Finally, Frazier claims that the trial court erred by failing to instruct the jury that Frazier must prove the mitigating factors by a preponderance of the evidence. See <em>State v. Jenkins </em>(1984), 15 Ohio St.3d 164, 171-172, 15 OBR 311, 473 N.E.2d 264.</p>\n<p id=\"b373-8\">{\u00b6 195} In a pretrial motion, the defense requested (1) an order relieving it of the burden of proving the mitigating factors and (2) an instruction that the state bears the burden of proving the absence of any mitigating factors offered by the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"168\">*168</page-number>defense. This motion was denied. However, trial counsel did not preserve this motion by raising it during trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b374-5\">{\u00b6 196} Frazier argues that the trial court\u2019s failure to instruct on the burden of proof for mitigating factors may have caused the jury to believe that the mitigating factors must be proven beyond a reasonable doubt. However, the trial court instructed the jury that the \u201cdefendant does not have the burden of proof,\u201d an instruction more favorable to Frazier than the absent instruction. See <em>State v. Hicks </em>(1989), 43 Ohio St.3d 72, 78, 538 N.E.2d 1030. We find no plain error. Based on the foregoing, we reject proposition I.</p>\n<p id=\"b374-6\">{\u00b6 197} <em>Noncapital sentencing. </em>In proposition of law VIII, Frazier argues that he is entitled to a new penalty-phase hearing because the trial court imposed consecutive sentences in violation of <em>State v. Foster, </em>109 Ohio St.3d 1, 2006-Ohio-856, 845 N.E.2d 470.</p>\n<p id=\"b374-7\">{\u00b6 198} On May 9, 2005, the trial court sentenced Frazier to eight years for aggravated robbery in Count 2, and eight years for aggravated burglary in Count 3. The trial court ordered that the sentences for aggravated robbery and aggravated burglary be served concurrently with each other and consecutively to the aggravated murder count.</p>\n<p id=\"b374-8\">{\u00b6 199} In imposing consecutive sentences, the trial court stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b374-9\">{\u00b6 200} \u201c[T]he Court find[s] that consecutive sentences [are] necessary to fulfill the purpose of 2929.11 of the Ohio Revised Code, and specifically in making that finding, the Court finds that it is necessary to protect the public from future crime and it is not disproportionate to the seriousness of the defendant\u2019s conduct and not disproportionate to the danger the offender poses to the public.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b374-10\">{\u00b6 201} \u201cSpecifically, the Court finds that in the commission of these offenses the defendant caused the death of another, Miss Mary Stevenson, a very vulnerable woman and handicapped woman * * *, and that it was a very senseless act. And the Court also finds that the harm was so great and unusual that no single prison term can adequately reflect the seriousness of the offender\u2019s conduct, and the Court again specifically refers to the findings relative to the specifications and the aggravating factors in those specifications, that being that the commission of these offenses resulted in the brutal murder of * * * Mary Stevenson.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b374-11\">{\u00b6 202} On June 24, 2004, more than ten months before Frazier\u2019s sentencing, the Supreme Court had decided <em>Blakely v. Washington </em>(2004), 542 U.S. 296, 124 S.Ct. 2531, 159 L.Ed.2d 403. <em>Blakely </em>held that the Sixth Amendment prohibits a judge from imposing a sentence greater than that allowed by a jury verdict or by the defendant\u2019s admissions at a plea hearing. Id. at 305-306, 124 S.Ct. 2531, 159 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"169\">*169</page-number>L.Ed.2d 403. However, trial counsel did not object that Frazier\u2019s noncapital sentences were imposed in violation of <em>Blakely.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b375-4\">{\u00b6 203} On February 27, 2006, in <em>Foster, </em>109 Ohio St.3d 1, 2006-Ohio-856, 845 N.E.2d 470, we applied <em>Apprendi v. New Jersey </em>(2000), 530 U.S. 466, 120 S.Ct. 2348, 147 L.Ed.2d 435, and <em>Blakely </em>to Ohio\u2019s noncapital sentencing statutes. <em>Foster </em>at paragraphs one and three of the syllabus. <em>Foster </em>held that portions of R.C. 2929.14(C), which requires judicial fact-finding for maximum prison terms, and R.C. 2929.14(E)(4), which requires judicial findings for consecutive terms, are unconstitutional under <em>Blakely. Foster, </em>paragraph three of the syllabus. <em>Foster </em>also held that these unconstitutional statutory provisions are severable and that judicial fact-finding is no longer required before the imposition of maximum sentences or consecutive prison terms. Id., paragraphs two and four of the syllabus.</p>\n<p id=\"b375-5\">{\u00b6 204} In the present case, the trial court\u2019s fact-finding in support of consecutive sentences violated <em>Foster </em>because a jury did not make findings on the seriousness of the offense justifying consecutive sentences.</p>\n<p id=\"b375-6\">{\u00b6 205} Nevertheless, there is a question as to whether Frazier\u2019s failure to object to his noncapital sentences constitutes waiver. Frazier was sentenced after <em>Blakely </em>but before this court\u2019s decision in <em>Foster. </em>In <em>Foster, </em>we rejected waiver on the ground that <em>Blakely </em>had not been decided at the time of Foster\u2019s sentencing: \u201cFoster could not have relinquished his sentencing objections as a known right when no one could have predicted that <em>Blakely </em>would extend the <em>Apprendi </em>doctrine to redefine \u2018statutory maximum.\u2019 \u201d <em>Foster, </em>109 Ohio St.3d 1, 2006-Ohio-856, 845 N.E.2d 470, \u00b6 31. We recently resolved this issue in <em>State v. Payne, </em>114 Ohio St.3d 502, 2007-Ohio-4642, 873 N.E.2d 306, and we therefore conclude that defense counsel\u2019s failure to challenge Frazier\u2019s noncapital sentencing waived his present claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b375-7\">{\u00b6 206} A waived claim will still be considered when there is plain error. However, the test for plain error is stringent. A party claiming plain error must show that (1) an error occurred, (2) the error was obvious, and (3) the error affected the outcome of the trial. See <em>State v. Barnes </em>(2002), 94 Ohio St.3d 21, 27, 759 N.E.2d 1240; <em>United States v. Olano </em>(1993), 507 U.S. 725, 732, 113 S.Ct. 1770, 123 L.Ed.2d 508; Crim.R. 52(B); see, also, <em>Washington v. Recuenco </em>(2006), 548 U.S. -, 126 S.Ct. 2546, 2553, 165 L.Ed.2d 466 <em>(Blakely </em>error is not a \u201cstructural error\u201d and is subject to harmless-error analysis).</p>\n<p id=\"b375-10\">{\u00b6 207} The burden of demonstrating plain error is on the party asserting it. See, e.g., <em>State v. Jester </em>(1987), 32 Ohio St.3d 147, 150, 512 N.E.2d 962 (\u201cappellant cannot claim that the trial court\u2019s instruction was plain error, inasmuch as he cannot demonstrate that but for the error, the outcome of the trial would have been different\u201d). Additionally, \u201c[n]otice of plain error * * * is to be taken with <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"170\">*170</page-number>the utmost caution, under exceptional circumstances and only to prevent a manifest miscarriage of justice.\u201d <em>State v. Long </em>(1978), 53 Ohio St.2d 91, 7 O.O.3d 178, 372 N.E.2d 804, paragraph three of the syllabus.</p>\n<p id=\"b376-4\">{\u00b6208} We hold that the consecutive sentences imposed on Frazier did not result in plain error. After <em>Foster, </em>\u201ctrial courts * * * are no longer required to make findings or give their reasons for imposing maximum, consecutive, or more than the minimum sentences.\u201d <em>Foster, </em>109 Ohio St.3d 1, 2006-Ohio-856, 845 N.E.2d 470, \u00b6 100. Nothing in the record suggests that the noncapital sentencing would have been different if Frazier had been sentenced in accordance with <em>Blakely </em>and <em>Foster. </em>Indeed, there is no way to know whether the trial court would have imposed consecutive sentences had he sentenced Frazier consistently with <em>Blakely </em>and <em>Foster.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b376-5\">{\u00b6 209} Based on the foregoing, we reject proposition VIII.</p>\n<p id=\"b376-6\">{\u00b6 210} <em>Postverdict discussions with jury. </em>In proposition of law XIV, Frazier contends that the trial judge erred in conducting an off-the-record ex parte discussion with the jurors after the jury had returned its penalty-phase verdict but before the trial court had imposed sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b376-7\">{\u00b6 211} After the jury\u2019s penalty-phase verdict was announced, the trial court acknowledged the jury\u2019s hard work on the case. The trial judge announced, \u201c[WJe\u2019ll be in recess now,\u201d and added, \u201cI\u2019ll come back and talk with you for a couple of minutes.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b376-8\">{\u00b6 212} Frazier\u2019s claim lacks merit. First, trial counsel were present, but did not object, when the trial judge mentioned that she would speak to the jurors. By making no complaint, the defense waived any objection. See <em>State v. Brinkley, </em>105 Ohio St.3d 231, 2005-Ohio-1507, 824 N.E.2d 959, \u00b6 153.</p>\n<p id=\"b376-9\">{\u00b6 213} Second, Frazier has failed to establish prejudice from any conversations that the trial court may have had with the jury. Moreover, Frazier has not attempted to reconstruct what the trial court discussed with the jury in an effort to show prejudice. See App.R. 9(B) and (E); <em>State v. Williams, </em>99 Ohio St.3d 439, 2003-Ohio-4164, 793 N.E.2d 446, \u00b6 98.</p>\n<p id=\"b376-10\">{\u00b6 214} Finally, as in <em>Williams, </em>\u201cwhen the judge and jury met, the jurors had satisfied their official task and were free to discuss the case.\u201d Id. at \u00b6 99. Also, the trial court can be presumed to consider \u201c \u2018only the relevant, material, and competent evidence in arriving at its judgment unless it affirmatively appears to the contrary.\u2019 \u201d <em>State v. Post </em>(1987), 32 Ohio St.3d 380, 384, 513 N.E.2d 754, quoting <em>State v. White </em>(1968), 15 Ohio St.2d 146, 151, 44 O.O.2d 132, 239 N.E.2d 65. Thus, we reject proposition XIV.</p>\n<p id=\"b377-3\">\n<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"171\">*171</page-number>\n<em>Ineffective Assistance of Counsel</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b377-4\">{\u00b6 215} In proposition of law, XII, Frazier raises various claims that his trial counsel provided ineffective assistance and that a new trial is warranted. See <em>Strickland v. Washington, </em>466 U.S. at 687, 104 S.Ct. 2052, 80 L.Ed.2d 674; <em>State v. Bradley, </em>42 Ohio St.3d 136, 538 N.E.2d 373, paragraph two of the syllabus.</p>\n<p id=\"b377-5\">{\u00b6 216} 1. Lack of pretrial preparation. Frazier argues that his counsel provided ineffective assistance by failing to review and object to surveillance footage. The state provided the defense with CD-ROMs (compact discs, read-only memory) showing 350 hours of footage from 16 surveillance cameras at Northgate Apartments. The defense also received a compilation CD-ROM showing relevant footage of Frazier\u2019s and other individuals\u2019 movements around the time of the murder.</p>\n<p id=\"b377-6\">{\u00b6 217} During an out-of-court hearing on May 12, 2005, trial counsel expressed concern about the fairness of the compilation CD-ROM. The trial court ruled that the compilation CD would be admitted. Trial counsel also mentioned that the defense lacked the proper equipment to open the CD-ROMs. Later that day, the state loaned the defense a laptop computer to review the CD-ROMs.</p>\n<p id=\"b377-7\">{\u00b6 218} On May 16, 2005, the compilation CD-ROM was shown, without objection, to the jury. Toledo policeman Randal Navarro and Detective William Seymour provided the foundation for introducing the compilation CD-ROM into evidence. Detective Seymour also provided narrative testimony explaining events shown on the CD-ROM.</p>\n<p id=\"b377-8\">{\u00b6 219} First, Frazier argues that his counsel failed to review the surveillance footage from the CD-ROMs. However, Frazier presents no evidence showing that his counsel did not review the surveillance footage. It cannot be assumed that counsel did not review the footage just because four days elapsed between the date that the defense received equipment to open the CD-ROMs and the date when the surveillance footage was shown in court.</p>\n<p id=\"b377-9\">{\u00b6 220} Second, Frazier argues that his counsel provided ineffective assistance by not cross-examining Navarro and by conducting only a brief cross-examination of Seymour. Frazier fails to state the questions that his counsel should have asked these witnesses. Moreover, whether further questioning would have unearthed any useful information is speculative. We find that counsel\u2019s decision to forgo cross-examination constituted a legitimate tactical decision. See <em>State v. Foust, </em>105 Ohio St.3d 137, 2004-Ohio-7006, 823 N.E.2d 836, \u00b6 125.</p>\n<p id=\"b377-10\">{\u00b6 221} 2. Inadequate voir dire. Frazier argues that his counsel provided ineffective assistance by failing to ask any follow-up questions of six prospective jurors who stated that they could not impose the death penalty. However, \u201c[t]he conduct of voir dire by defense counsel does not have to take a particular form, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"172\">*172</page-number>nor do specific questions have to be asked.\u201d <em>State v. Evans </em>(1992), 63 Ohio St.3d 231, 247, 586 N.E.2d 1042. Moreover, \u201ccounsel is in the best position to determine whether any potential juror should be questioned and to what extent.\u201d <em>State v. Murphy </em>(2001), 91 Ohio St.3d 516, 539, 747 N.E.2d 765.</p>\n<p id=\"b378-5\">{\u00b6 222} The six prospective jurors expressed strong views opposing the death penalty. Contrary to Frazier\u2019s claims, trial counsel did ask venireman Piel whether she \u201ccould or could not sign a death verdict,\u201d and she replied, \u201cCould not.\u201d The remaining five jurors indicated to the court that \u201cunder no circumstances\u201d would they be willing or able to follow the instructions and consider the death penalty. Trial counsel were not deficient by failing to ask follow-up questions of these jurors after they had expressed intractable views opposing the death penalty. See <em>State v. Phillips </em>(1995), 74 Ohio St.3d 72, 85, 656 N.E.2d 643.</p>\n<p id=\"b378-6\">{\u00b6 223} 3. Trial counsel\u2019s comments. Frazier argues that trial counsel made various comments during both phases of the trial that resulted in ineffective assistance.</p>\n<p id=\"b378-7\">{\u00b6 224} Before trial, counsel responded, \u201cYou mean besides enter a plea? Which is what I would prefer,\u201d to the trial court\u2019s question about any further pretrial issues in the case. Frazier claims that this response showed that his counsel were not putting forth a full effort in his defense. Frazier\u2019s complaint takes these comments out of context. The defense had tried to negotiate a pretrial agreement before the trial began. If counsel\u2019s negotiations had been successful, Frazier would not have received the death penalty. Counsel\u2019s remarks reflected no unwillingness to continue actively defending Frazier after these negotiations failed. Counsel\u2019s isolated remarks do not show deficient performance and were not prejudicial. See <em>State v. Drummond, </em>111 Ohio St.3d 14, 2006-Ohio-5084, 854 N.E.2d 1038, \u00b6 214.</p>\n<p id=\"b378-8\">{\u00b6 225} Second, Frazier complains that his counsel provided ineffective assistance during the guilt-phase closing argument by conceding that the crime was \u201chorrible\u201d and that the victim \u201cwas a wonderful person. And she had no reason to die, and she was murdered in a fashion most foul.\u201d Trial counsel\u2019s statements do not reflect deficient performance. Counsel\u2019s candid acknowledgement that a horrible murder was committed on a defenseless victim helped to build rapport with the jury. Indeed, it is difficult to discuss this crime without using such words. See <em>State v. Campbell </em>(2000), 90 Ohio St.3d 320, 337, 738 N.E.2d 1178.</p>\n<p id=\"b378-9\">{\u00b6 226} Third, Frazier argues that his counsel provided ineffective assistance during the penalty-phase opening statement by commenting on the horrible nature of the crime committed on an innocent and defenseless victim. He also claims that his counsel was ineffective by stating:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b378-10\">{\u00b6 227} \u201cI\u2019d like to harken back to the statements I made at the conclusion of the first phase and that is, we worked real hard to get a jury in this case, one <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"173\">*173</page-number>whose verdict we could trust, and that\u2019s what we got. That\u2019s exactly what we got. And I heard the evidence too. I mean, I worked on the case for 14 months. And we got a sound verdict.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b379-6\">{\u00b6 228} Counsel\u2019s acceptance of the jury\u2019s guilt-phase verdict helped trial counsel maintain rapport with the jury as the defense moved into the penalty phase. See <em>State v. Johnson, </em>112 Ohio St.3d 210, 2006-Ohio-6404, 858 N.E.2d 1144, \u00b6 151-152. There was nothing counsel could do to change the jury\u2019s finding of guilt. Counsel merely noted that the jury had already convicted his client and that counsel was then moving beyond that fact to focus the jury\u2019s attention on mitigating factors. Such argument represented a legitimate tactical decision. See <em>State v. Hartman </em>(2001), 93 Ohio St.3d 274, 296, 754 N.E.2d 1150 (counsel not ineffective for conceding blame during the penalty-phase closing argument).</p>\n<p id=\"b379-7\">{\u00b6 229} Finally, Frazier argues that his counsel provided ineffective assistance during the penalty-phase closing argument by stating:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b379-8\">{\u00b6 230} \u201cBut relative to the nature and circumstances of the offense, * * * this was a gruesome crime. They don\u2019t get much more gruesome than that. When you physically lay your [hjands on another human being in the act of strangulation, take their life, that puts you right up to the top, a consideration for imposition of the death penalty.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b379-9\">{\u00b6 231} Frazier\u2019s claim that trial counsel\u2019s argument improperly conveyed to the jury that the gruesome nature of the crime could be considered an aggravating circumstance misconstrues the purpose of this argument. Trial counsel acknowledged that the crime was gruesome; however, he then emphasized that Frazier never intended to kill Stevenson when he went to her apartment. Thus, trial counsel\u2019s remarks focused on highlighting the mitigating features (e.g., no intent to kill) of Frazier\u2019s actions. We find that this argument was a tactical decision and did not constitute ineffective assistance. <em>State v. Bradley, </em>42 Ohio St.3d at 144, 538 N.E.2d 373.</p>\n<p id=\"b379-10\">{\u00b6 232} 4. Failure to ensure a complete record. Frazier claims that his counsel provided ineffective assistance by failing to object to unrecorded bench conferences and an unrecorded jury-instruction conference. However, Frazier cannot show prejudice because there is no evidence about what happened during these conferences. <em>State v. Drummond, </em>111 Ohio St.3d 14, 2006-Ohio-5084, 854 N.E.2d 1038, \u00b6 220. \u201cActs or omissions by trial counsel which cannot be shown to have been prejudicial may not be characterized as ineffective assistance.\u201d <em>State v. Davie </em>(1997), 80 Ohio St.3d 311, 332, 686 N.E.2d 245.</p>\n<p id=\"b379-11\">{\u00b6 233} 5. Alcohol- and drug-abuse expert. Frazier argues that his counsel provided ineffective assistance by failing to retain a substance-abuse expert to present testimony about his history of alcohol and drugs, particularly crack cocaine. This claim has no merit. Dr. Jeffrey Smalldon testified as a mitigation <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"174\">*174</page-number>witness, and his written evaluation was also introduced into evidence. Dr. Smalldon diagnosed Frazier with a \u201chistory of alcohol abuse and a history of polysubstance abuse.\u201d Dr. Smalldon testified that Frazier was drinking 15 to 20 beers a day in his mid-thirties. In the mid-1990s, Frazier went through a detoxification program to treat his cocaine abuse. Thus, Dr. Smalldon found that \u201cthere\u2019s a pretty solid foundation for inferring a history of both significant alcohol abuse and significant substance abuse.\u201d Accordingly, the defense presented \u201c \u2018alternative devices that * * * fulfill the same functions as the expert assistance sought.\u2019 \u201d <em>State v. Foust, </em>105 Ohio St.3d 137, 2004-Ohio-7006, 823 N.E.2d 836, \u00b6 103, quoting <em>State v. Jenkins </em>(1984), 15 Ohio St.3d 164, 15 OBR 311, 473 N.E.2d 264, paragraph four of the syllabus.</p>\n<p id=\"b380-5\">{\u00b6 234} 6. Failure to request change of venue. Frazier argues that his counsel provided ineffective assistance by failing to move for a change of venue. The record does show the pervasive publicity about which Frazier complains. Counsel could also reasonably decide as a matter of trial strategy to conduct the trial in Toledo instead of requesting a change of venue. See <em>State v. Bryan, </em>101 Ohio St.3d 272, 2004-Ohio-971, 804 N.E.2d 433, \u00b6 156 (reviewing court \u201cwill not second-guess trial strategy decisions\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b380-6\">{\u00b6 235} Moreover, a change of venue is not automatically granted when there is extensive pretrial publicity. Any decision to change venue rests largely within the discretion of the trial court. <em>State v. Maurer </em>(1984), 15 Ohio St.3d 239, 250, 15 OBR 379, 473 N.E.2d 768. \u201c[A] careful and searching voir dire provides the best test of whether prejudicial pretrial publicity has prevented obtaining a fair and impartial jury from the locality.\u201d <em>State v. Bayless </em>(1976), 48 Ohio St.2d 73, 98, 2 O.O.3d 249, 357 N.E.2d 1035. Also, a \u201cdefendant claiming that pretrial publicity has denied him a fair trial must show that one or more jurors were actually biased.\u201d <em>State v. Gross, </em>97 Ohio St.3d 121, 2002-Ohio-5524, 776 N.E.2d 1061, \u00b6 29.</p>\n<p id=\"b380-7\">{\u00b6 236} Here, the trial court questioned the jurors about pretrial publicity. Nine of the seated jurors had not been exposed to any media coverage about the case. One juror had heard Frazier\u2019s name in the news, and another juror had seen TV news reports about the case. Both jurors indicated that pretrial publicity would not have any effect on their ability to be fair and impartial. The remaining juror saw a headline about the case in the paper; however, she was not asked whether it would influence her. Nevertheless, this juror said, \u201cI would have to know the circumstances of the case, which I don\u2019t know anything\u201d before reaching a verdict. We find that this claim also lacks merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b380-8\">{\u00b6 237} 7. Other allegations of ineffective assistance of counsel. Frazier raises other instances of alleged ineffective assistance of counsel, but none of these prejudiced him. <em>Strickland v. Washington, </em>466 U.S. at 687, 104 S.Ct. 2052, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"175\">*175</page-number>80 L.Ed.2d 674. As previously discussed in other propositions, Frazier\u2019s counsel were not ineffective by failing to object because Bowen was not qualified as an expert witness (XVII), and his counsel were not ineffective by failing to file motions to suppress (V). Frazier was also not prejudiced by trial counsel\u2019s failure to secure Frazier\u2019s waiver of his presence at in-chambers discussions and legal conferences (XVIII) or by his counsel\u2019s failure to obtain an expert in mental retardation and more fully develop Frazier\u2019s mental status (IV). Finally he was not prejudiced by his counsel\u2019s failure to object to the state\u2019s penalty-phase argument (XIII) or by his counsel\u2019s failure to object to penalty-phase instructions (I).</p>\n<p id=\"b381-7\">{\u00b6 238} For the foregoing reasons, we reject proposition XII.</p>\n<p id=\"b381-8\">{\u00b6 239} In proposition of law XXI, Frazier claims that his counsel failed to preserve meritorious issues, but Frazier never cites any record reference or any specific meritorious issues that counsel failed to preserve. Thus, Frazier fails to establish deficient performance or prejudice. Moreover, we find nothing in the record showing any meritorious issues that were not preserved. Proposition XXI is overruled.</p>\n<p id=\"b381-9\">{\u00b6 240} In proposition of law XXII, Frazier asserts that his counsel were ineffective by failing to adequately preserve the record for appellate review. As discussed in proposition XII, Frazier cannot show prejudice because he fails to establish what transpired during unrecorded in-chambers discussions and legal conferences. Thus, we deny proposition XXII.</p>\n<p id=\"b381-10\">\n<em>Cumulative Errors</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b381-11\">{\u00b6 241} In proposition of law XX, Frazier argues that cumulative errors deprived him of a fair trial and require a reversal of his convictions and death sentence. However, Frazier received a fair trial. Moreover, \u201cerrors cannot become prejudicial by sheer weight of numbers.\u201d <em>State v. Hill </em>(1996), 75 Ohio St.3d 195, 212, 661 N.E.2d 1068. Thus, we reject proposition XX.</p>\n<p id=\"b381-12\">\n<em>Settled Issues</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b381-13\">{\u00b6 242} <em>Reasonable doubt. </em>In proposition of law IX, Frazier challenges the constitutionality of the instructions on reasonable doubt. However, we have repeatedly affirmed the constitutionality of R.C. 2901.05(D). See <em>State v. Van Gundy </em>(1992), 64 Ohio St.3d 230, 232, 594 N.E.2d 604. Thus, proposition IX is denied.</p>\n<p id=\"b381-14\">{\u00b6 243} <em>Constitutionality. </em>In proposition of law XV, Frazier attacks the constitutionality of Ohio\u2019s death-penalty statutes. We summarily reject these claims. See <em>State v. Carter </em>(2000), 89 Ohio St.3d 593, 607, 734 N.E.2d 345; <em>State </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"176\">*176</page-number><em>v. Jenkins, </em>15 Ohio St.3d 164, 15 OBR 311, 473 N.E.2d 264, paragraph one of the syllabus.</p>\n<p id=\"b382-5\">{\u00b6 244} Frazier also contends that Ohio\u2019s death-penalty statutes violate international law and treaties to which the United States is a party. These arguments also lack merit. See <em>State v. Bey, </em>85 Ohio St.3d at 502, 709 N.E.2d 484.</p>\n<p id=\"b382-6\">{\u00b6 245} In proposition of law XVII, Frazier challenges the constitutionality of lethal injection. We have previously rejected similar claims. See <em>State v. Adams, </em>103 Ohio St.3d 508, 2004-Ohio-5845, 817 N.E.2d 29, \u00b6 131; <em>State v. Carter, </em>89 Ohio St.3d at 608, 734 N.E.2d 345.</p>\n<p id=\"b382-7\">\n<em>Sufficiency and Weight of the Aggravating Circumstances</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b382-8\">{\u00b6 246} In proposition of law XXIII, Frazier argues that his death penalty must be vacated because the aggravating circumstances do not outweigh the mitigating factors. We shall address this argument during our independent sentence evaluation.</p>\n<p id=\"b382-9\">\n<em>Proportionality</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b382-10\">{\u00b6 247} In proposition of law XXIV, Frazier claims that his death sentence is disproportionate to death sentences imposed in similar cases. This argument will also be addressed during our independent sentence evaluation.</p>\n<p id=\"b382-11\">INDEPENDENT SENTENCE EVALUATION</p>\n<p id=\"b382-12\">{\u00b6 248} Having considered Frazier\u2019s propositions of law, we are required by R.C. 2929.05(A) to independently review Frazier\u2019s death sentence for appropriateness and proportionality. The evidence at trial established beyond a reasonable doubt that Frazier murdered Mary Stevenson while committing or attempting to commit aggravated robbery, R.C. 2929.04(A)(7), and while committing or attempting to commit aggravated burglary, R.C. 2929.04(A)(7).</p>\n<p id=\"b382-13\">{\u00b6 249} Against these aggravating circumstances, we are called upon to weigh the mitigating factors contained in R.C. 2929.04(B). Frazier called one mitigating witness, Dr. Smalldon, and introduced his written report, the coroner\u2019s verdict, and Dr. Forgac\u2019s written report, and he submitted other documentary evidence for the jury\u2019s consideration. Frazier presented neither a sworn nor unsworn statement.</p>\n<p id=\"b382-14\">{\u00b6 250} Dr. Smalldon evaluated and conducted psychological testing of Frazier. Dr. Smalldon also reviewed Frazier\u2019s records, interviewed Frazier\u2019s brother, reviewed statements from other family members, and talked to Gary Ericson, the defense\u2019s mitigation specialist, about Frazier\u2019s background.</p>\n<p id=\"b382-15\">{\u00b6 251} As discussed in proposition IV, Frazier\u2019s IQ tests show that he has a verbal IQ of 77, a performance IQ of 72, and a full scale IQ of 72. Dr. Smalldon <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"177\">*177</page-number>testified that Frazier\u2019s IQ scores place him \u201ctoward the lower end of the borderline range of intelligence.\u201d Dr. Smalldon also stated that Frazier\u2019s IQ scores are consistent with his failure in first grade, his designation as a slow learner in school, and Frazier\u2019s attendance in special classes before he dropped out of school after the tenth grade.</p>\n<p id=\"b383-6\">{\u00b6 252} Dr. Smalldon diagnosed Frazier with \u201ca depressive disorder not otherwise specified.\u201d According to Dr. Smalldon, Frazier\u2019s records show that he has had \u201cepisodic fluctuating symptoms of depression over a period of many years.\u201d Frazier was also diagnosed with a history of alcohol and polysubstance abuse, including marijuana and cocaine. Finally, Dr. Smalldon diagnosed Frazier with \u201ca personality disorder not otherwise specified\u201d and \u201cborderline intellectual functioning.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b383-7\">{\u00b6 253} According to Dr. Smalldon, Frazier was the \u201cproduct of a very unstable family.\u201d He was one of six children. Social service workers reported that Frazier and his siblings \u201cwere just kind of running around unsupervised, not responsive to parental direction.\u201d Frazier\u2019s family was also very poor. Records showed that the family was living on a weekly wage of $64.</p>\n<p id=\"b383-8\">{\u00b6 254} Frazier\u2019s father was absent and uninvolved with his children. He was also a gambler and a drinker. Frazier described his father as the \u201cmain disciplinarian\u201d and said, \u201cWhen you got a whooping, you got a whooping.\u201d Frazier remembered that on one occasion, \u201chis father crash[ed] through the bathroom door * * * to administer one of those.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b383-9\">{\u00b6 255} Frazier described himself as feeling ashamed as an elementary school student and said that other students would tease him and call him stupid. Frazier was not active in school activities because he lacked money for \u201cclothes and stuff like that.\u201d Frazier was an overall D student, and he dropped out of high school when he was 19 years old.</p>\n<p id=\"b383-10\">{\u00b6 256} Frazier told Dr. Smalldon that when he was 13 or 14 years old, a man abducted him while he was getting off a bus and sodomized him. Frazier stated, \u201cI\u2019ve never forgotten it. Fifty years later, those images are with me today.\u201d Dr. Smalldon testified that Frazier\u2019s trust in other people \u201cevaporated after that experience.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b383-11\">{\u00b6 257} When Frazier was 25 years old, he married Tommie Louise Washington, but they divorced several years later. Frazier dated several other women after his divorce and fathered three illegitimate children. According to Dr. Smalldon, \u201cnone of these relationships had a great deal of staying power, and even when he was involved in them, * * * [there was] quite a bit of turmoil.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b383-12\">{\u00b6 258} Frazier\u2019s employment history has been erratic, and he seldom remained employed for very long. Moreover, most of his employment involved <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"178\">*178</page-number>\u201cunskilled or very marginally-skilled jobs.\u201d Frazier described himself as an unreliable employee. He said, \u201cI\u2019d get fired because I drink.\u201d In 1994, Frazier was granted Social Security disability based on an administrative finding that he was mentally retarded.</p>\n<p id=\"b384-5\">{\u00b6 259} Frazier has a history of significant alcohol and substance abuse. Frazier\u2019s medical records in the mid-1990s show that he was drinking \u201c20 bottles of beer a day, along with using drugs.\u201d His medical records also show that he was hospitalized in the mid-1990s for suicidal and homicidal ideation. Frazier was depressed because he had broken up with his girlfriend, and he was thinking of hurting himself and killing her.</p>\n<p id=\"b384-6\">{\u00b6 260} Dr. Smalldon testified that Frazier never expressed remorse about Stevenson\u2019s murder because he said \u201che didn\u2019t do it.\u201d Dr. Smalldon also reported Frazier to be \u201ca very compliant, easy-to-handle inmate\u201d during the 15 months that he was in the county jail. Dr. Smalldon stated that if he were treating Frazier, \u201cthe very first thing that [he] would look to is structure, [a] highly-controlled environment like a prison.\u201d Beyond that, Dr. Smalldon stated that he would not \u201cexpect to make any major progress in terms of changing [Frazier\u2019s] personality structure.\u201d Rather, he would look at \u201cbehavioral kinds of interventions.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b384-7\">{\u00b6 261} As discussed in proposition IV, Dr. Forgac found that Frazier is not mentally retarded. Dr. Forgac diagnosed Frazier with \u201cborderline intellectual functioning.\u201d When Dr. Forgac asked Frazier whether he hears voices, he replied, \u201cAll the time, even when I\u2019m sitting here sometimes. Men\u2019s voices, not clear, like interference, but mostly when I get ready to go to sleep.\u201d Frazier also indicated that he was \u201c[w]atched all the time\u201d where he lives. However, Dr. Forgac concluded, \u201cThere was nothing in this man\u2019s clinical presentation, including his thought content or stream of thought, which would indicate he was acutely psychotic on the day of this evaluation.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b384-8\">{\u00b6 262} We find nothing in the nature and circumstances of the offense to be mitigating. Frazier entered Stevenson\u2019s apartment and murdered her by strangling her and slitting her throat. Afterwards, Frazier stole two of her purses and fled the scene. These facts establish a horrific crime without any mitigating features.</p>\n<p id=\"b384-9\">{\u00b6 263} Although Frazier\u2019s character offers nothing in mitigation, we give some weight to his history and background. Frazier was raised in an unstable family environment with little parental direction and control. Frazier did poorly in school and dropped out of high school. Frazier claims that when he was a teenager, he was sexually abused by a man. If that is true, Frazier was undoubtedly traumatized by this experience.</p>\n<p id=\"b385-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"179\">*179</page-number>{\u00b6 264} Frazier also had a long history of drug and alcohol abuse. Testimony at trial showed that Frazier was drinking and using crack cocaine on the night before he murdered Stevenson.</p>\n<p id=\"b385-5\">{\u00b6 265} The statutory mitigating features are generally inapplicable here, including R.C. 2929.04(B)(1) (victim inducement), (B)(2) (duress, coercion, or strong provocation), (B)(4) (youth of the offender), (B)(5) (lack of a significant criminal record), and (B)(6) (accomplice only).</p>\n<p id=\"b385-6\">{\u00b6 266} Frazier\u2019s mental deficiencies do not qualify as an R.C. 2929.04(B)(3) factor because there was no testimony that Frazier, by reason of a mental disease or defect, lacked substantial capacity to appreciate the criminality of his conduct or to conform his conduct to the requirements of the law.</p>\n<p id=\"b385-7\">{\u00b6 267} Nevertheless, Frazier\u2019s limited intellectual abilities are entitled to significant weight in mitigation under the catchall provision of R.C. 2929.04(B)(7). Dr. Smalldon testified that Frazier has an IQ of 72, which places him in the borderline range of intelligence. However, the evidence at trial did not establish that he is mentally retarded. Thus, his execution is not barred by <em>Atkins v. Virginia, </em>536 U.S. 304, 122 S.Ct. 2242, 153 L.Ed.2d 335.</p>\n<p id=\"b385-8\">{\u00b6 268} In proposition of law XXIII, Frazier argues that he should not receive the death penalty because he is elderly (he was 63 at the time of the offenses) and not a \u201cfit candidate\u201d for the death penalty. Frazier argues that any life sentence will keep him in prison for the rest of his life. However, Frazier\u2019s age had no effect on his ability to brutally murder Stevenson. Thus, we give little weight to his age as a mitigating factor. The evidence does not reveal any other mitigating factors under R.C. 2929.04(B)(7).</p>\n<p id=\"b385-9\">{\u00b6 269} We find that the aggravating circumstances outweigh the mitigating factors, beyond a reasonable doubt. Frazier murdered Stevenson during the course of an aggravated robbery and an aggravated burglary. Compared with these serious aggravating circumstances, Frazier\u2019s mitigating evidence has little significance.</p>\n<p id=\"b385-10\">{\u00b6 270} Finally, the death penalty imposed for the aggravated murder of Stevenson is proportionate to death sentences approved for other robbery-murder and burglary-murder cases.
