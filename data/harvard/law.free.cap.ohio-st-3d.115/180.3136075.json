The narrow issue on this appeal is whether, pursuant to R.C. 3103.03(B), a parent\u2019s duty to support a child continues beyond the age of majority when the child is enrolled in a high school recognized and accredited by another jurisdiction but not by the state of Ohio.</p>\n<p id=\"b386-16\">{\u00b6 2} In 1988, the trial court granted a divorce to Linnette and Gary Davis and awarded custody of their daughters, Melanie, born July 31, 1978, and Christina, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"181\">*181</page-number>born December 27, 1983, to Linnette Davis. The court ordered Gary Davis to pay child support through the Geauga County Child Support Enforcement Agency (\u201cCSEA\u201d), beginning in September 1988 and \u201ccontinuing until a respective minor child dies, marries, becomes emancipated or reaches the age of eighteen (18) years (provided that said child has completed high school), whichever first occurs.\u201d In addition, the court ordered Linnette Davis to immediately notify the CSEA \u201cof any reason for which the support order shall terminate.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b387-4\">{\u00b6 3} Pursuant to her obligation, Linnette Davis notified the CSEA that Melanie had withdrawn from school as of June 11, 1997, and she later filed a sworn affidavit stating that Christina had withdrawn from school as of April 15, 2002. The effect of these affidavits terminated Gary Davis\u2019s support obligation with respect to his two daughters as of those respective dates.</p>\n<p id=\"b387-5\">{\u00b6 4} In 2003, Gary Davis filed a show-cause motion alleging that Linnette Davis had perpetrated a fraud on the court by falsely stating the dates on which their daughters had withdrawn from school. He contended that Melanie and Christina had actually withdrawn from the South Euclid Lyndhurst public school system about the time they reached the age of majority, not almost two years afterwards, as Linnette had claimed in her affidavits, and he sought reimbursement for the child support payments that he had made for his daughters after they became 18.</p>\n<p id=\"b387-6\">{\u00b6 5} The court referred the motion to a magistrate, who held a hearing and thereafter found that records from the South Euclid Lyndhurst School District revealed that Melanie had withdrawn from high school on November 1, 1995, and that Christina had withdrawn on October 17, 2000. As a result, the magistrate determined that Gary Davis had overpaid child support by $2,066.92 for Melanie and by $696.08 for Christina. Although the magistrate found that Melanie had enrolled in a home-education program known as the American School after withdrawing from the South Euclid Lyndhurst public schools, the magistrate concluded that the American School was not an accredited high school as contemplated by R.C. 3103.03(B). Thus, the magistrate recommended that the court hold Linnette Davis in contempt for failing to abide by prior court orders and impose a 15-day sentence of incarceration, to be suspended upon condition that she repay $2,763.00 and costs to Gary Davis.</p>\n<p id=\"b387-7\">{\u00b6 6} Linnette Davis objected to the magistrate\u2019s assertion that the American School did not qualify as a \u201crecognized and accredited high school\u201d for purposes of R.C. 3103.03(B), and she submitted evidence that the American School is a private, distance-learning high school recognized by the Illinois Board of Education and accredited by the North Central Association of Colleges and Schools, the Accrediting Commission of the Distance Education and Training Counsel, and the Commission on International and Trans-Regional Accreditation. Thus, she <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"182\">*182</page-number>moved to vacate the magistrate\u2019s order for repayment of child support for Melanie.</p>\n<p id=\"b388-4\">{\u00b6 7} The trial court accepted the recommendation of the magistrate, stating that \u201cin order for a school to be \u2018recognized and accredited\u2019 as set out in Ohio Revised Code 3103.03(B), the school must be approved by the state of Ohio. The fact that the American School is accredited by the State of Illinois Board of Education does not make it recognized and accredited by the State of Ohio.\u201d The court found Linnette Davis in contempt and sentenced her to five days in jail unless she purged the contempt by repaying Gary Davis $2,066.92 for Melanie and $696.08 for Christina, plus processing fees.</p>\n<p id=\"b388-5\">{\u00b6 8} Linnette Davis paid $696.08 to Gary Davis, posted a bond, and appealed the court order regarding Melanie to the Geauga County Court of Appeals, alleging that the American School is a \u201crecognized and accredited high school\u201d as contemplated by R.C. 3103.03(B).</p>\n<p id=\"b388-6\">{\u00b6 9} The court of appeals, in a two-to-one decision, held, \u201c[T]he critical element in deciding whether child support should continue for a child who is being home-schooled is not whether the home-school program is \u2018recognized and accredited,\u2019 but whether \u2018it is approved by the state.\u2019 \u201d <em>Davis v. Davis, </em>167 Ohio App.3d 319, 2006-Ohio-2393, 855 N.E.2d 104, \u00b6 36, citing <em>Brown v. Brown </em>(Dec. 27,1995), Seventh Dist. No. 94 C.A. 172,1995 WL 782884, and <em>Gatchel v. Gatchel, </em>159 Ohio App.3d 519, 2005-Ohio-148, 824 N.E.2d 576. In reaching this decision, the court of appeals relied on R.C. 3321.04, which (1) compels parents to send their children to a school that meets the standards prescribed by the Ohio Board of Education unless excused by the local superintendent of schools and (2) authorizes the board to promulgate rules governing the approval of home-education programs by the local superintendent. See R.C. 3321.04(A) and Ohio Adm.Code 3301-34-03.</p>\n<p id=\"b388-7\">{\u00b6 10} Consequently, the appellate court affirmed the trial court\u2019s judgment of contempt and order for repayment because \u201cthe record does not reflect that [Linnette] complied with the statutory and regulatory requirements of R.C. 3321.04 and Ohio Adm.Code 3301-34-3 to get the approval of the superintendent of her local school district to enroll Melanie and Christina in the American School programs.\u201d <em>Davis, </em>at \u00b6 39.</p>\n<p id=\"b388-8\">{\u00b6 11} Linnette Davis appealed from that order, and we accepted discretionary review in order to address a narrow proposition of law: \u201cR.C. 3103.03(B) requires the continuation of child support beyond the age of majority as long as the high school attended is recognized and accredited by any state in the Union.\u201d See <em>Davis v. Davis, </em>167 Ohio App.3d 319, 2006-Ohio-2393, 855 N.E.2d 104. Quoting R.C. 3103.03(B), she asserts that even in the absence of approval by the state of Ohio, the American School qualifies as \u201cany recognized and accredited high <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"183\">*183</page-number>school\u201d because it is a home-education program that offers a high school education, and it has been recognized by the state of Illinois and accredited by three educational agencies. Gary Davis did not file a responsive brief.</p>\n<p id=\"b389-4\">{\u00b6 12} Thus, the issue presented concerns a matter of statutory interpretation regarding the legislature\u2019s intent in mandating a parental duty of support continuing \u201cbeyond the age of majority as long as the child continuously attends on a full-time basis any recognized and accredited high school.\u201d R.C. 3103.03(B).</p>\n<p id=\"b389-5\">{\u00b6 13} Legislative intent controls our analysis. In <em>State ex rel. Russo v. McDonnell, </em>110 Ohio St.3d 144, 150, 2006-Ohio-3459, 852 N.E.2d 145, \u00b6 37, we stated, \u201c \u2018In construing a statute, our paramount concern is legislative intent.\u2019 \u201d Id., quoting <em>State ex rel. Musial v. N. Olmsted, </em>106 Ohio St.3d 459, 2005-Ohio-5521, 835 N.E.2d 1243, \u00b6 23. We further stated that \u201c[i]n order to determine this intent, we must \u2018 \u201cread words and phrases in context according to the rules of grammar and common usage.\u201d \u2019 \u201d Id., quoting <em>State ex rel. Cincinnati Bell Tel. Co. v. Pub. Util. Comm., </em>105 Ohio St.3d 177, 2005-Ohio-1150, 824 N.E.2d 68, \u00b6 27, quoting <em>State ex rel. Lee v. Karnes, </em>103 Ohio St.3d 559, 2004-Ohio-5718, 817 N.E.2d 76, \u00b6 23; see, also, R.C. 1.42.</p>\n<p id=\"b389-6\">{\u00b6 14} This court also explained in <em>Sharp v. Union Carbide Corp. </em>(1988), 38 Ohio St.3d 69, 70, 525 N.E.2d 1386, that \u201c[w]here a particular term employed in a statute is not defined, it will be accorded its plain, everyday meaning.\u201d Id., citing <em>State v. Dorso </em>(1983), 4 Ohio St.3d 60, 62, 4 OBR 150, 446 N.E.2d 449; see, also, <em>State v. Reeder </em>(1985), 18 Ohio St.3d 25, 26-27, 18 OBR 21, 479 N.E.2d 280, quoting <em>Mut. Bldg. &amp; Invest. Co. v. Efros </em>(1949), 152 Ohio St. 369, 40 O.O. 389, 89 N.E.2d 648, paragraph one of the syllabus, and also citing <em>Youngstown Club v. Porterfield </em>(1970), 21 Ohio St.2d 83, 86, 50 O.O.2d 198, 255 N.E.2d 262 (\u201cThe courts however will assume the legislature is using a word in its ordinary meaning and our task is to accord \u2018 * * * its common, ordinary and usually accepted meaning in the connection in which it is used * * *.\u2019 \u201d [Ellipsis sic]).</p>\n<p id=\"b389-7\">{\u00b6 15} Furthermore, in <em>State v. Lowe, </em>112 Ohio St.3d 507, 2007-Ohio-606, 861 N.E.2d 512, \u00b6 15, we affirmed that \u201ca court may not add words to an unambiguous statute, but must apply the statute as written.\u201d Id., citing <em>Portage Cty. Bd. of Commrs. v. Akron, </em>109 Ohio St.3d 106, 2006-Ohio-954, 846 N.E.2d 478; see, also, <em>Columbus-Suburban Coach Lines, Inc. v. Pub. Util. Comm. </em>(1969), 20 Ohio St.2d 125, 127, 49 O.O.2d 445, 254 N.E.2d 8 (\u201cit is the duty of this court to give effect to the words used, not to delete words used or to insert words not used\u201d). And as this court stated in <em>Iddings v. Jefferson Cty. School Dist. Bd. of Edn. </em>(1951), 155 Ohio St. 287, 290, 44 O.O. 294, 98 N.E.2d 827, \u201c[t]o construe or interpret what is already plain is not interpretation but legislation, which is not the function of the courts.\u201d See, also, <em>Barth v. Barth, </em>113 Ohio St.3d 27, 2007-Ohio-973, 862 N.E.2d 496, \u00b6 10; <em>Lake Hosp. Sys., Inc. v. Ohio Ins. Guar. Assn. </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"184\">*184</page-number>(1994), 69 Ohio St.3d 521, 524, 634 N.E.2d 611; and <em>Thompson Elec., Inc. v. Bank One, Akron, N.A. </em>(1988), 37 Ohio St.3d 259, 264, 525 N.E.2d 761.</p>\n<p id=\"b390-5\">{\u00b6 16} At issue in this appeal is R.C. 3103.03(B), which states, \u201c[T]he parental duty of support to children shall continue beyond the age of majority as long as the child continuously attends on a full-time basis any recognized and accredited high school.\u201d Specifically, we are called upon to construe the words \u201cany recognized and accredited high school.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b390-6\">{\u00b6 17} The legislature has not defined the words \u201crecognized\u201d and \u201caccredited,\u201d nor has it manifested any intent to give them a meaning that is particular to this statute; thus, we give them their plain and ordinary meanings. See <em>Sharp, </em>38 Ohio St.3d at 70, 525 N.E.2d 1386, and <em>Reeder, </em>18 Ohio St.3d at 26-27, 18 OBR 21, 479 N.E.2d 280.</p>\n<p id=\"b390-7\">{\u00b6 18} The word \u201crecognize\u201d has several relevant meanings, such as \u201cto acknowledge formally,\u201d \u201cto admit as being of a particular status,\u201d \u201cto acknowledge the de facto existence of,\u201d \u201cto acknowledge in some definite way,\u201d and \u201cto admit the fact or existence of.\u201d Webster\u2019s Third New International Dictionary (1986) 1896. The word \u201caccredited\u201d is defined as \u201cpublicly sanctioned or recognized,\u201d \u201cofficially authorized or recognized: provided with credentials,\u201d \u201cofficially vouched for or guaranteed as conforming to a prescribed or desirable standard,\u201d and, with respect to educational institutions, \u201capproved by an accrediting agency.\u201d Id. at 13.</p>\n<p id=\"b390-8\">{\u00b6 19} Importantly, the legislature has chosen to modify \u201crecognized and accredited high school\u201d with the adjective \u201cany.\u201d The word \u201cany\u201d means \u201cone or some indiscriminately of whatever kind,\u201d \u201cone, no matter what one,\u201d \u201cone that is selected without restriction or limitation of choice,\u201d \u201cone or some of whatever kind or sort,\u201d and \u201cone, some, or all indiscriminately of whatever quantity.\u201d Id. at 97. In choosing this adjective, the legislature has manifested its intent that the phrase \u201crecognized and accredited high school\u201d should be construed expansively for purposes of R.C. 3103.03(B). By doing so, it has acknowledged the mobility of individuals in our society, the educational choices available to them, and the possibility that children may move to or otherwise attend high schools that are recognized and accredited in different jurisdictions.</p>\n<p id=\"b390-9\">{\u00b6 20} Had the General Assembly intended that the parental duty of support for a child who has reached the age of majority depends on whether the child attends a high school that has been recognized, accredited, or otherwise approved <em>in </em>or <em>by the state of Ohio, </em>it could have so specified in R.C. 3103.03(B). Moreover, the legislature could have chosen, in R.C. 3103.03(B), to treat home-education programs differently from traditional high schools and to refer to statutes and rules requiring the approval of home-education programs <em>by the state of </em>Ohio or <em>by the local superintendent. </em>The legislature has not seen fit to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"185\">*185</page-number>do so, however, and we may not add such requirements to R.C. 3103.03(B) under the guise of statutory interpretation, for as we stated in <em>Ritchey Produce Co., Inc. v. Ohio Dept. of Adm. Servs. </em>(1999), 85 Ohio St.3d 194, 206, 707 N.E.2d 871, \u201c[t]his court is not now, nor has it ever been, a judicial legislature.\u201d</p>\n<attorneys id=\"AJC\">McDonald Hopkins Co., L.P.A., and Roger Kleinman, for appellant.</attorneys>\n<p id=\"b391-4\">{\u00b6 21} Here, the undisputed evidence in the record demonstrates that the American School is a private, distance-learning high school that has been recognized by the Illinois State Board of Education and accredited by the North Central Association of Colleges and Schools, the Accrediting Commission of the Distance Education and Training Counsel, and the Commission on International and Trans-Regional Accreditation. Thus, because it has been recognized by another state and accredited by three educational agencies, the American School is a \u201crecognized and accredited high school\u201d for purposes of R.C. 3103.03(B),</p>\n<p id=\"b391-5\">{\u00b6 22} In defining the mandatory parental duty of support for a child who is beyond the age of majority and enrolled in high school, the General Assembly has used the expansive phrase \u201cany recognized and accredited high school\u201d and has not required that a high school\u2019s recognition and accreditation come only from the state of Ohio. A high school that has been recognized by another state and accredited by non-Ohio entities need not also have been approved by the state of Ohio in order to be a \u201crecognized and accredited\u201d high school as contemplated by R.C. 3103.03(B). Accordingly, the judgment of the court of appeals to the contrary is reversed, and this matter is remanded to the trial court with respect to its contempt citation and other matters that remain.</p>\n<p id=\"b391-6\">Judgment reversed and cause remanded.</p>\n<judges id=\"b391-7\">Moyer, C.J., Pfeifer, Lundberg Stratton, Pietrykowski and Cupp, JJ., concur.</judges>\n<judges id=\"b391-8\">Lanzinger, J., concurs in judgment only.</judges>\n<judges id=\"b391-9\">Mark L.
