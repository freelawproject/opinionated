Stated differently, did the board exercise reasonable diligence in attempting to serve Crawford even though the board did not attempt service by ordinary mail at an address from which the certified mail addressed to Crawford was returned marked \u201cAttempted Not Known\u201d? The answer is yes. Therefore, we reverse the judgment of the court of appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b615-13\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b615-14\">{\u00b6 3} The parties do not dispute the relevant facts. A judgment entry of paternity established that appellee, Iler Crawford, is the father of the minor child, Shawn Thompkins. The appellant, Montgomery County Children Services Board, first sought permanent custody of Thompkins in October 2002. The board discovered two possible addresses for Crawford \u2014 one in Columbus and one in Dayton. Crawford\u2019s mother accepted service of process on his behalf at the Dayton address. However, because the trial court did not adjudicate the complaint for permanent custody before the 90-day period set forth in R.C. 2151.35(B)(1) expired, the board filed a new complaint for permanent custody in February 2003.</p>\n<p id=\"b616-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"410\">*410</page-number>{\u00b6 4} The board attempted to personally serve Crawford at the Dayton address in March 2003. That attempt failed, and the process server reported that Crawford had not resided at the Dayton address for almost one year. Pursuant to Civ.R. 4.4(A)(1), the board filed an affidavit for service by publication asserting that Crawford could not be served by summons because his address was unknown to the board and could not be ascertained with reasonable diligence. Thereafter, a notice of the upcoming hearing appeared in the Daily Court Reporter, a newspaper of general circulation in Montgomery County.</p>\n<p id=\"b616-5\">{\u00b6 5} After publication of the notice and before the permanent-custody hearing commenced, the board attempted to serve Crawford by certified mail at the Columbus address. The postmaster returned the certified letter to the Montgomery County Juvenile Court bearing a stamp listing five possible reasons for mail to be returned: \u201cAttempted Not Known,\u201d \u201cInsufficient Address,\u201d \u201cNo Such Number/Street,\u201d \u201cNot Deliverable as Addressed \u2014 Unable to Forward,\u201d and \u201cOther.\u201d A mark appeared next to \u201cAttempted Not Known.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b616-6\">{\u00b6 6} Counsel appointed to represent Crawford appeared at the hearing on the complaint for permanent custody and claimed that the trial court lacked personal jurisdiction over Crawford because the board had failed to perfect service upon him. The magistrate ruled that the board had properly served Crawford by publication and proceeded with the custody hearing. In July 2003, the magistrate determined that Thompkins was a dependent child and awarded permanent custody to the board. Crawford\u2019s counsel objected to the court\u2019s exercise of personal jurisdiction over Crawford. However, the trial court overruled the objection and adopted the magistrate\u2019s decision. Crawford\u2019s counsel appealed the trial court\u2019s judgment to the Second District Court of Appeals. Appellate counsel informed the court that he could not locate his client. Crawford\u2019s counsel filed an <em>Anders </em>brief, see <em>Anders v. California </em>(1967), 386 U.S. 738, 87 S.Ct. 1396, 18 L.Ed.2d 493, in which he noted a potential issue involving a defect in service and resultant lack of personal jurisdiction but concluded that the issue lacked merit. The appellate court determined that the service-of-proeess issue had sufficient merit to prevent the appeal from being wholly frivolous. Consequently, the court appointed new counsel, who filed a brief raising this assignment of error.</p>\n<p id=\"b616-7\">{\u00b6 7} Reviewing the merits, the court of appeals noted that when a children services board seeks to terminate parental rights, Juv.R. 16 requires the board to exercise reasonable diligence in its effort to serve the parents with process and that reasonable diligence requires attempts to serve the parents in accordance with Civ.R. 4(A), (C), and (D), 4.1, 4.2, 4.3, 4.5, and 4.6 before resorting to service by publication.</p>\n<p id=\"b617-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"411\">*411</page-number>{\u00b6 8} The appellate court then determined that the \u201cAttempted Not Known\u201d notation on the certified mail envelope returned to the Montgomery County Juvenile Court was the equivalent of an envelope returned \u201cUnclaimed.\u201d This triggered the application of Civ.R. 4.6(D), which allows a party to request service by ordinary mail. Because the board did not request service by ordinary mail, the appellate court concluded that it did not exercise due diligence in attempting to serve Crawford before resorting to service by publication. Therefore, the appellate court held that service by publication was insufficient and the trial court lacked personal jurisdiction over Crawford.</p>\n<p id=\"b617-6\">{\u00b6 9} We accepted the state\u2019s discretionary appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b617-7\">{\u00b6 10} The right of a parent to the custody of his or her child is one of the oldest fundamental liberty interests recognized by American courts. <em>Troxel v. Granville </em>(2000), 530 U.S. 57, 65-66, 120 S.Ct. 2054, 147 L.Ed.2d 49. See also <em>In re Adoption of Walters, </em>112 Ohio St.3d 315, 2007-Ohio-7, 859 N.E.2d 545, \u00b6 18, citing <em>In re Hayes </em>(1997), 79 Ohio St.3d 46, 48, 679 N.E.2d 680 (the right to raise one\u2019s child is an essential and basic civil right); <em>In re Adoption of Pushcar, </em>110 Ohio St.3d 332, 2006-Ohio-4572, 853 N.E.2d 647, \u00b6 11, citing <em>Santosky v. Kramer </em>(1982), 455 U.S. 745, 753, 102 S.Ct. 1388, 71 L.Ed.2d 599 (\u201cnatural parents have a fundamental right to the care and custody of their children\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b617-8\">{\u00b6 11} Moreover, this court has noted that \u201c[p\u2019jermanent termination of parental rights has been described as \u2018the family law equivalent of the death penalty in a criminal case.\u2019 * * * Therefore, parents \u2018must be afforded every procedural and substantive protection the law allows.\u2019 \u201d <em>Hayes, </em>79 Ohio St.3d at 48, 679 N.E.2d 680, quoting <em>In re Smith </em>(1991), 77 Ohio App.3d 1, 16, 601 N.E.2d 45.</p>\n<p id=\"b617-9\">{\u00b6 12} The Due Process Clause of the Fifth Amendment to the United States Constitution, as applicable to the states through the Fourteenth Amendment, provides: \u201cNo person shall * * * be deprived of life, liberty, or property, without due process of law.\u201d But \u201c[f]or all its consequence, \u2018due process\u2019 has never been, and perhaps can never be, precisely defined. * * * Rather, the phrase expresses the requirement of \u2018fundamental fairness,\u2019 a requirement whose meaning can be as opaque as its importance is lofty. Applying the Due Process Clause is therefore an uncertain enterprise which must discover what \u2018fundamental fairness\u2019 consists of in a particular situation by first considering any relevant precedents and then by assessing the several interests that are at stake.\u201d <em>Lassiter v. Dept. of Social Servs. of Durham Cty., North Carolina </em>(1981), 452 U.S. 18, 24-25, 101 S.Ct. 2153, 68 L.Ed.2d 640.</p>\n<p id=\"b617-10\">{\u00b6 13} Our courts have long recognized that due process requires both notice and an opportunity to be heard. See, e.g., <em>Hagar v. Reclamation Dist. No. 108 </em>(1884), 111 U.S. 701, 708, 4 S.Ct. 663, 28 L.Ed. 569; <em>Caldwell v. Carthage </em>(1892), 49 Ohio St. 334, 348, 31 N.E. 602. In <em>Mullane v. Cent. Hanover Bank &amp; Trust </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"412\">*412</page-number><em>Co. </em>(1950), 339 U.S. 306, 70 S.Ct. 652, 94 L.Ed. 865, the United States Supreme Court enunciated the standard for determining whether service of process comports with due process, holding: \u201cAn elementary and fundamental requirement of due process in any proceeding which is to be accorded finality is notice reasonably calculated, under all the circumstances, to apprise interested parties of the pendency of the action and afford them an opportunity to present their objections.\u201d Id. at 314, 70 S.Ct. 652, 94 L.Ed. 865.</p>\n<p id=\"b618-4\">{\u00b6 14} In accordance with this requirement, the government must <em>attempt </em>to provide actual notice to interested parties if it seeks to deprive them of a protected liberty or property interest. <em>Dusenbery v. United States </em>(2002), 534 U.S. 161, 170, 122 S.Ct. 694, 151 L.Ed.2d 597. However, due process does not require that an interested party receive <em>actual </em>notice. Id. Moreover, while \u201c[t]he means employed must be such as one desirous of actually informing the absentee might reasonably adopt to accomplish it,\u201d <em>Mullane, </em>339 U.S. at 315, 70 S.Ct. 652, 94 L.Ed. 865, due process does not require \u201cheroic efforts\u201d to ensure the notice\u2019s delivery, <em>Dusenbery, </em>534 U.S. at 170, 122 S.Ct. 694, 151 L.Ed.2d 597.</p>\n<p id=\"b618-5\">{\u00b6 15} Here, we must determine whether the board exercised reasonable diligence in attempting to notify Crawford that his parental rights were subject to termination, so that its efforts comport with our rules for the service of process and with due process requirements. Crawford did not receive actual notice of the termination proceeding; he was not aware of the case that could, and did, terminate his constitutionally protected parental rights. Indeed, it appears that Crawford remains unaware of the lengthy proceedings conducted to preserve his parental rights, as even his own court-appointed attorneys have been unable to locate him during the pendency of this action.</p>\n<p id=\"b618-6\">{\u00b6 16} A number of rules and statutes govern the service of process in Ohio. Juv.R. 16(A) states that a \u201csummons shall be served as provided in Civil Rules 4(A), (C) and (D), 4.1, 4.2, 4.3, 4.5 and 4.6.\u201d The rule further provides that \u201cwhen the residence of a party is unknown and cannot be ascertained with reasonable diligence, service shall be made by publication.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b618-7\">{\u00b6 17} Civ.R. 4.6(D) provides: \u201cIf a certified or express mail envelope is returned with an endorsement showing that the envelope was unclaimed, the clerk shall forthwith notify, by mail, the attorney of record or, if there is no attorney of record, the party at whose instance process was issued. If the attorney, or serving party, after notification by the clerk, files with the clerk a written request for ordinary mail service, the clerk shall send by ordinary mail a copy of the summons and complaint or other document to be served to the defendant at the address set forth in the caption, or at the address set forth in written instructions furnished to the clerk. * * * Service shall be deemed complete when the fact of mailing is entered of record, provided that the ordinary <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"413\">*413</page-number>mail envelope is not returned by the postal authorities with an endorsement showing failure of delivery. If the ordinary mail envelope is returned undelivered, the clerk shall forthwith notify the attorney, or serving party, by mail.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b619-6\">{\u00b6 18} Further, R.C. 2151.29 states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b619-7\">{\u00b6 19} \u201cService of summons, notices, and subpoenas * * * shall be made by delivering a copy to the person summoned, notified, or subpoenaed, or by leaving a copy at the person\u2019s usual place of residence. If the juvenile judge is satisfied that such service is impracticable, the juvenile judge may order service by registered or certified mail. * * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b619-8\">{\u00b620} \u201cWhenever it appears by affidavit that after reasonable effort the person to be served with summons cannot be found or the person\u2019s post-office address ascertained, * * * the clerk shall publish such summons once in a newspaper of general circulation throughout the county.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b619-9\">{\u00b6 21} Pursuant to Civ.R. 4.6(D), when service is attempted by certified mail, as it was in this ease, and the certified mail \u201cis returned with an endorsement showing that the envelope was unclaimed,\u201d the serving party must be notified, and may then request that service be attempted by ordinary mail.</p>\n<p id=\"b619-10\">{\u00b6 22} Here, the postal service returned the certified mail marked \u201cAttempted Not Known.\u201d The United States Postal Service, Domestic Mail Manual, Section 507, Exhibit 1.4.1, available at http://pe.usps.gov/text/dmm300/507.htm, provides that the endorsement \u201cUnclaimed\u201d means that the reason for nondelivery was that the \u201c[ajddressee abandoned or failed to call for mail,\u201d while the endorsement \u201cAttempted \u2014 Not Known\u201d means \u201c[djelivery attempted, addressee not known at place of address.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b619-11\">{\u00b6 23} When a postal return reads \u201cAttempted Not Known,\u201d no purpose would be served by a follow-up ordinary mail letter sent to the same address. The \u201cUnclaimed\u201d designation implies that the person may in fact reside or receive mail at the designated address but for whatever reason has chosen not to sign for the certified mail. In that situation, a follow-up communication by ordinary mail is reasonably calculated to provide the interested party with notice and an opportunity to be heard. Such a communication, not returned, bears a strong inference that the intended recipient received the letter. This is not so, however, with ordinary mail following the return of a certified letter with the endorsement \u201cAttempted Not Known.\u201d The inference then is that the intended recipient does not reside or receive mail at the designated address and is not known to the residents there. A follow-up letter in these circumstances would not permit a similar inference of receipt.</p>\n<p id=\"b619-12\">{\u00b6 24} In this case, the board complied with the rules by attempting to personally serve Crawford at the Dayton address, by attempting to serve him by <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"414\">*414</page-number>certified mail at the Columbus address, and by publishing a notice in the Daily Court Reporter in Montgomery County. Neither Civ.R. 4.6(D) nor the Due Process Clause required the board to attempt service at the Columbus address by ordinary mail. The returned certified letter, endorsed \u201cAttempted Not Known,\u201d clearly demonstrated that Crawford did not reside and was not known at the Columbus address. Therefore, any ordinary mail addressed to him at that address could not be reasonably calculated to give him notice and an opportunity to be heard at the permanent-custody proceeding.</p>\n<p id=\"b620-5\">{\u00b6 25} In considering what constitutes reasonable diligence under Civ.R. 4.4(A), this court has stated: \u201cBlack\u2019s Law Dictionary (5 Ed.1979), at 412, defines \u2018reasonable diligence\u2019 as \u2018[a] fair, proper and due degree of care and activity, measured with reference to the particular circumstances; such diligence, care, or attention as might be expected from a man of ordinary prudence and activity.\u2019 As indicated by the above definition, what constitutes reasonable diligence will depend on the facts and circumstances of each particular case.\u201d <em>Sizemore v. Smith </em>(1983), 6 Ohio St.3d 330, 332, 6 OBR 387, 453 N.E.2d 632. We declared that \u201c[rjeasonable diligence requires taking steps which an individual of ordinary prudence would reasonably expect to be successful in locating a defendant\u2019s address.\u201d Id.</p>\n<p id=\"b620-6\">{\u00b6 26} In <em>Sizemore, </em>we recognized that steps taken in the effort to exercise reasonable diligence might include consulting a city directory, examining government records, or making inquiries of possible acquaintances of the person sought. Id. But we cautioned that \u201c[t]hese examples do not constitute a mandatory checklist. Rather, they exemplify that reasonable diligence requires [the use of] common and readily available sources\u201d in the search. Id.</p>\n<p id=\"b620-7\">{\u00b6 27} In support of its request for service by publication, the board submitted a \u201creasonable diligence\u201d affidavit to the trial court on March 13, 2003. That affidavit stated that Crawford\u2019s residence was unknown to the affiant and that his last known addresses were in Columbus, where the board later attempted certified mail service, and his mother\u2019s address in Dayton.</p>\n<p id=\"b620-8\">{\u00b6 28} The affidavit stated that the board conducted a \u201cdiligent search\u201d by (1) checking criminal databases including the CRIS-E Prison Locator, the Montgomery County Jail, and the Ohio Defender Database; (2) sending letters to the Columbus address, which the postal service later returned; (3) attempting to obtain residential service at the Dayton home of Crawford\u2019s mother, which had been successful in the prior case; and (4) attempting to contact family members at the mother\u2019s address. The affidavit further stated that the board \u201cknows of no other addresses for the legal father,\u201d and concluded that \u201c[t]he residence of the legal father cannot be ascertained with reasonable diligence and service should be made by publication as provided by law.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b621-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"415\">*415</page-number>{\u00b6 29} Because we determine that neither Civ.R. 4.6(D) nor the Due Process Clause requires ordinary mail service when the postal authorities return certified mail with the endorsement \u201cAttempted Not Known\u201d before a party attempts service by publication, and inasmuch as no party has otherwise challenged the board\u2019s averment that it exercised reasonable diligence in attempting to ascertain Crawford\u2019s address, we conclude that the board exercised reasonable diligence in attempting to serve Crawford. Accordingly, we reverse the judgment of the court of appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b621-5\">Judgment reversed.</p>\n<judges id=\"b621-6\">Lundberg Stratton, Lanzinger, and Cupp, JJ., concur.</judges>\n<judges id=\"b621-7\">Moyer, C.J., and Pfeifer and O\u2019Connor, JJ., concur in part and dissent in part.</judges>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"concurring-in-part-and-dissenting-in-part\">\n<author id=\"b621-8\">O\u2019Connor, J.,</author>\n<p id=\"Ayg\">concurring in part and dissenting in part.</p>\n<p id=\"b621-9\">{\u00b6 30} The overriding issue in this fact-intensive case is whether appellant, Montgomery County Children Services (\u201cMCCS\u201d), exercised \u201creasonable diligence\u201d under Juv.R. 16(A) in attempting to serve appellee Iler Crawford with notice of a hearing in which his parental rights were at stake. In my view, the majority unjustifiably limits its analysis of that issue by resolving it solely within the narrow confines of a discussion of the requirements of Civ.R. 4.6(D). But this case also presents this court with an opportunity to clarify the standards that should apply to similar situations in the future. The majority fails to take advantage of the opportunity to provide sorely needed guidance on how a court should evaluate the validity of service by publication in a parental-rights case.</p>\n<p id=\"b621-10\">{\u00b6 31} For the reasons explained below, I dissent in part. I would vacate the judgment of the court of appeals and remand this cause to that court to apply <em>Sizemore v. Smith </em>(1983), 6 Ohio St.3d 330, 6 OBR 387, 453 N.E.2d 632, to all the relevant facts and circumstances.</p>\n<p id=\"b621-11\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b621-12\">{\u00b6 32} In <em>In re Adoption of Walters, </em>112 Ohio St.3d 315, 2007-Ohio-7, 859 N.E.2d 545, \u00b6 18, this court stressed that the right to raise a child is an essential and basic civil right. Furthermore, the United States Supreme Court has established that the right of a parent to the custody of his or her child is a fundamental liberty interest. <em>Troxel v. Granville </em>(2000), 530 U.S. 57, 65-66, 120 S.Ct. 2054, 147 L.Ed.2d 49. See also <em>In re Murray </em>(1990), 52 Ohio St.3d 155, 157, 556 N.E.2d 1169.</p>\n<p id=\"b621-13\">{\u00b6 33} Because this case implicates a parent\u2019s constitutional right to the care and custody of his child, Crawford \u201c \u2018must be afforded every procedural and substantive protection the law allows.\u2019 \u201d <em>In re Hayes </em>(1997), 79 Ohio St.3d 46, 48, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"416\">*416</page-number>679 N.E.2d 680, quoting <em>In re Smith </em>(1991), 77 Ohio App.3d 1, 16, 601 N.E.2d 45. I readily acknowledge that Crawford has never exercised his parental rights or taken on any responsibilities with regard to Thompkins. However, although Crawford\u2019s failings as a parent were relevant to the trial court\u2019s determination whether permanent custody should be granted to MCCS, his parental deficiencies are irrelevant to the inquiry whether service of the notice of hearing to terminate his parental rights was valid. To answer that question, a reviewing court must focus only on the details of the service itself.</p>\n<p id=\"b622-4\">{\u00b6 34} When a dispute arises as to whether a party exercised reasonable diligence preceding resort to service by publication under Juv.R. 16(A), the burden is on that party to establish the reasonable diligence of its efforts. See <em>In re Miller </em>(1986), 33 Ohio App.3d 224, 226, 515 N.E.2d 635. Because service by publication is a method of last resort, the requirements of Juv.R. 16(A) are to be strictly enforced. See <em>In re Wilson </em>(1984), 21 Ohio App.3d 36, 40, 21 OBR 38, 486 N.E.2d 152.</p>\n<p id=\"b622-5\">{\u00b6 35} In perfecting service of notice on a person that a court proceeding is to take place and that the proceeding will affect the person\u2019s fundamental rights in property or family, the most reliable method of notification is to have a process server hand the notice to the person. That form of service, however, is not always possible or practical, nor is it necessarily required by rule or statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b622-6\">{\u00b6 36} The next best method is to personally serve the notice at the residence of the individual by leaving it with a competent adult. When these methods of \u201cpersonal\u201d and \u201cresidence\u201d service fail, the next preferred method is to send the notice by certified mail.</p>\n<p id=\"b622-7\">{\u00b6 37} The return of the receipt card signed by the person or another adult at the address signifies (certifies) that the mail was received, and thus, that document suffices to show \u201cpersonal\u201d service of notice of the proceeding.</p>\n<p id=\"b622-8\">{\u00b6 38} If the certified letter is returned, and the reason given to the sender for its failure to be delivered indicates that the letter was unclaimed, ordinary mail service to that same address is then proper. If a letter sent by ordinary mail service is not returned to the sender as undeliverable, then service is deemed to have been made upon the person.</p>\n<p id=\"b622-9\">{\u00b6 39} If, however, a certified letter is returned and indicates that the addressee is unknown at that address, it makes no sense to pursue ordinary mail service there because the addressee is known not to be at the address. Civ.R. 4.6(D) does not require an exercise in futility. Instead, the Civil Rules authorize service of notice by publication in a newspaper of general circulation in the county in which the action is pending.</p>\n<p id=\"b623-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"417\">*417</page-number>{\u00b6 40} The resort to publication service requires the filing of an affidavit that avers that the party or his counsel exercised \u201creasonable diligence\u201d to ascertain the address of the person to be served. Juv.R. 16(A). See also Civ.R. 4.4(A)(1). Service by publication cannot substitute for exercising reasonable diligence in ascertaining the current address of the person. This case must be analyzed by focusing on the reasonable diligence expended by MCCS to ascertain Crawford\u2019s address.</p>\n<p id=\"b623-5\">{\u00b6 41} This court previously considered reasonable diligence under Civ.R. 4.4(A) in <em>Sizemore v. Smith, </em>6 Ohio St.3d 330, 6 OBR 387, 453 N.E.2d 632.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> There, we emphasized that \u201cwhat constitutes reasonable diligence will depend on the facts and circumstances of each particular case.\u201d Id. at 332, 6 OBR 387, 453 N.E.2d 632. We further stated that \u201c[Reasonable diligence requires taking steps which an individual of ordinary prudence would reasonably expect to be successful in locating a defendant\u2019s address.\u201d Id.</p>\n<p id=\"b623-6\">{\u00b6 42} In <em>Sizemore, </em>we gave examples of some steps that could be undertaken in the typical exercise of reasonable diligence, but we commented, \u201cThese examples do not constitute a mandatory checklist. Rather, they exemplify that reasonable diligence requires\u201d the use of \u201ccommon and readily available sources\u201d in the search. Id.</p>\n<p id=\"b623-7\">{\u00b6 43} The resolution of this case depends on whether MCCS exercised \u201creasonable diligence\u201d in attempting to serve Crawford. That inquiry requires a consideration of whether MCCS used reasonable diligence in attempting to ascertain Crawford\u2019s current address, not simply whether the proper method of service was used. See id. at 331, 6 OBR 387, 453 N.E.2d 632. The court of appeals did not focus on whether MCCS exercised reasonable diligence in ascertaining Crawford\u2019s address based on a consideration of all relevant facts and circumstances as required by <em>Sizemore. </em>Instead, it limited its inquiry to whether service by ordinary mail to the Columbus address was required under Civ.R. 4.6(D). This approach unjustifiably concentrated on one small factor and abandoned the larger inquiry.</p>\n<p id=\"b623-8\">{\u00b6 44} It is apparent that a failed attempt at service indicated by certified mail returned marked \u201cAttempted Not Known\u201d is different from a failed attempt at service indicated by certified mail returned marked \u201cunclaimed.\u201d Although Civ.R. 4.6(D) specifies the procedures to be followed when \u201cunclaimed\u201d certified mail is involved, it is not at all clear that those same procedures come into play when certified mail is returned marked \u201cAttempted Not Known.\u201d In part, this is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"418\">*418</page-number>because that phrase is not used within the civil rule and is ambiguous in this situation.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> I therefore conclude that Civ.R. 4.6(D) did not necessarily mandate ordinary mail service in this situation, and so agree with the majority on that point.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b624-4\">{\u00b6 45} This case involves the termination of parental rights, and therefore a comprehensive consideration of whether MCCS established reasonable diligence is especially appropriate here. Because the court of appeals did not conduct such an inquiry, its judgment is incomplete. The proper course at this point is to vacate that judgment and remand the cause to the court of appeals for a full consideration of all facts and circumstances in accordance with <em>Sizemore.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b624-5\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b624-6\">{\u00b6 46} Although there are a large number of competing concerns that I believe should be considered and addressed by the court of appeals, there are three critical facts in the record that I believe warrant special attention.</p>\n<p id=\"b624-7\">{\u00b6 47} First, when service regarding the first hearing, which was scheduled to occur on January 15, 2003, was attempted on Crawford at his mother\u2019s house in Dayton, his mother accepted service on his behalf on December 28, 2002. The summons\u2019s return-of-service form bore the typewritten statement that \u201cresidential service\u201d was made \u201cupon_by leaving a copy of the summons and accompanying document(s) at his/her usual place of residence.\u201d On the blank line within the statement, \u201cIler Crawford\u201d had been printed by hand.</p>\n<p id=\"b624-9\">{\u00b6 48} Second, after a new complaint was filed and the case was assigned a new case number, a hearing was scheduled for April 14, 2003. Service regarding that hearing was attempted on Crawford at the same house in Dayton in March 2003. At the bottom of the identical return-of-service form, the process server wrote that he was unable to serve Crawford because Crawford \u201chad not lived at [that] address <em>for almost a year.\u201d </em>(Emphasis added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b625-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"419\">*419</page-number>{\u00b6 49} Third, the \u201creasonable diligence\u201d affidavit filed by MCCS on March 13, 2003, which was to support the resort to service by publication, detailed that Crawford\u2019s residence was unknown and that his last known addresses were one in Columbus (the address at which certified mail service was later attempted) and his mother\u2019s address in Dayton.</p>\n<p id=\"b625-4\">{\u00b6 50} The affidavit also stated that MCCS checked criminal databases (CRISE, Prison Locator; Montgomery County Jail; Ohio Defender Database) in a \u201cdiligent search\u201d; that letters had been sent to the Columbus address but that they had been returned; that service was \u201cmade residential\u201d under the case number for the first hearing, \u201cas service was accepted by\u201d Crawford\u2019s mother; that after the complaint was refiled, service was again attempted at the mother\u2019s address but that \u201c[t]he process server was told that the father has not lived at that address in a year\u201d; that contact was attempted with family members at the mother\u2019s address but that no response was received; and that \u201cMCCS knows of no other addresses for the legal father.\u201d The affidavit concluded, \u201cThe residence of the legal father cannot be ascertained with reasonable diligence and service should be made by publication as provided by law.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b625-5\">{\u00b6 51} Despite MCCS\u2019s assertion that reasonable diligence was established, an examination of the three facts noted above reveals that that fundamental assumption could be erroneous.</p>\n<p id=\"b625-6\">{\u00b6 52} The note on the March summons\u2019s return of service indicating that Crawford had not lived at his mother\u2019s house \u201cfor almost a year\u201d directly contradicts the language on the December summons\u2019s return of service that indicated that his mother\u2019s address was Crawford\u2019s \u201cusual place of residence.\u201d In addition, as clarified by the statement of the process server regarding the March service attempt, it appears that the December service attempt had not been \u201csuccessful\u201d after all. And if the December service attempt was not successful, then there would be no reason to expect success in the March service attempt.</p>\n<p id=\"b625-7\">{\u00b6 53} Arguably, the contradictions suggested by the service record and the reasonable-diligence affidavit should have alerted MCCS of the need to conduct a new \u201cdiligent search.\u201d The process server\u2019s notes about the lack of success in serving Crawford in Dayton established that that address was not correct. Several letters (apparently by ordinary mail) had been sent to the Columbus address and had been returned by the post office. MCCS attempted to achieve service by certified mail at the Columbus address only in an after-the-fact effort that commenced after notice by publication in Dayton had occurred. Clearly, MCCS did not believe that the Columbus address was a likely one for Crawford. And evidently, MCCS did not find Crawford in any criminal database that would have shown him to be in state custody. Thus, Crawford was at another address.</p>\n<p id=\"b626-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"420\">*420</page-number>{\u00b6 54} It is not for this court to conduct its own consideration of the full record to determine whether MCCS acted with reasonable diligence in ascertaining Crawford\u2019s address. That is a review that should be conducted by the court of appeals. The considerations cited are solely to illustrate that the inquiry is a fact-intensive one that cannot be resolved simply by addressing one specific concern.</p>\n<p id=\"b626-4\">Ill</p>\n<p id=\"b626-5\">{\u00b6 55} The majority opinion pays lip service to the due process concerns that are implicated in this case by recognizing that parents (even those, such as Crawford, who make no attempt to fulfill their parental responsibilities) must be afforded a high level of both procedural and substantive protections. Because service by publication is a service method of last resort that frequently fails to provide a party actual notice of impending proceedings, heightened scrutiny of that service method is especially important in parental-rights cases. But heightened scrutiny can be achieved only if clear standards are set and are applied in evaluating the validity of service on a particular person in a particular situation. Furthermore, when a reviewing court assesses a trial court\u2019s conclusion that service by publication was proper, the reviewing court should apply the same standards, and should not defer to the trial court\u2019s conclusion.</p>\n<p id=\"b626-6\">{\u00b6 56} I would take advantage of the opportunity presented by this case to hold that when parental rights are at stake, a reviewing court has a duty to conduct a de novo analysis of the validity of service. I would hold that this analysis should be done even when, as here, the service issues are presented to the court of appeals in a somewhat limited form and the parent has shown no interest in the child.</p>\n<p id=\"b626-7\">{\u00b6 57} In determining that service by publication was adequate in this case, the magistrate and trial court considered some of the factors discussed in <em>Sizemore, </em>but neither cited any rules, statutes, or case law as standards to guide their considerations. In reviewing the conclusion that service was proper, the court of appeals recognized a heightened duty to thoroughly examine the situation in light of the entire record, commenting that \u201cparental rights are fundamental, and may not be terminated without due process.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b626-8\">{\u00b6 58} As explained above, I agree with the majority that the court of appeals incorrectly reversed the trial court\u2019s judgment on Civ.R. 4.6(D) grounds. However, because I believe that the court of appeals truncated its analysis by focusing on the specifics of Civ.R. 4.6(D) and then stopping once it determined that that rule had not been complied with, I disagree with the majority\u2019s decision to simply reverse the judgment of the court of appeals and reinstate the trial court\u2019s determination that service was proper. I would remand the cause to the court of appeals to complete its analysis.</p>\n<attorneys id=\"Ab5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"421\">*421</page-number>Mathias H. Heck Jr., Montgomery County Prosecuting Attorney, and Jennifer B. Frederick, Assistant Prosecuting Attorney, for appellant.</attorneys>\n<attorneys id=\"ARU\">D.K. Wehner, for appellee.</attorneys>\n<p id=\"b627-4\">{\u00b6 59} For the foregoing reasons, I would vacate the judgment of the court of appeals and remand this cause to that court for consideration whether, in light of all the relevant facts and circumstances, MCCS met its burden of establishing that it exercised \u201creasonable diligence\u201d under the standards discussed in <em>Size-more.</em></p>\n<judges id=\"b627-5\">Moyer, C.J., and Pfeifer, J., concur in the foregoing opinion.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b623-9\">. <em>Sizemore </em>was not an appeal from a juvenile court\u2019s decision, so Juv.R. 16 was not at issue in that case. However, because Juv.R. 16(A)\u2019s relevant provisions on service by publication parallel the pertinent provisions of Civ.R. 4.4(A) analyzed in <em>Sizemore, </em>this court\u2019s discussion of reasonable diligence in <em>Sizemore </em>is fully applicable here.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b624-10\">. Other courts have encountered the term \u201cattempted not known,\u201d but there does not appear to be a consensus on a specific meaning. See, e.g., <em>Jefferson Cty. Treasurer v. Brown, </em>Jefferson Cty. App. No. 04 JE 30, 2005-Ohio-2933, 2005 WL 1385729, \u00b6 30 (suggestion that \u201cattempted not known\u201d means an attempted delivery but the named recipient was not present); <em>Adams v. Commr. of Internal Revenue </em>(T.C.1994), 1994 WL 397318, *2 (\u201cthe notation \u2018Returned to Sender, Attempted, Not Known\u2019 means that the Postal Service carrier attempted delivery and was told at the point of delivery that the addressee did not live there\u201d).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b624-11\">. The attempted service by certified mail on Crawford at the Columbus address was an attempt to obtain service after the publication of notice had <em>already </em>occurred in Dayton and thus could be viewed as merely an after-the-fact attempt to cure earlier deficient efforts at service. It is not an extremely important fact in the overall efforts to obtain service. In focusing extensively on a possible follow-up attempt at service at the Columbus address by ordinary mail, the court of appeals placed undue emphasis on a fact that may not have any import.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
