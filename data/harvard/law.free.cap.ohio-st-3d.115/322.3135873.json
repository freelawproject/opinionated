Lucas </em>(1988), 40 Ohio St.3d 100, 532 N.E.2d 130, we held that under the prior version of R.C. 4511.19(A)(1), \u201cthe results of a properly administered bodily substances test * * * may be admitted in evidence despite the fact that the bodily substance was withdrawn more than two hours from the time of the alleged violation.\u201d Id. at paragraph two of the syllabus. According to one of the appellate judges on the panel that decided this present case, our recent decision in <em>State v. Mayl, </em>106 Ohio St.3d 207, 2005-Ohio-4629, 833 N.E.2d 1216, has cast doubt over the continuing validity of <em>Lucas. </em>See <em>State v. Hassler, </em>5th Dist. No. 05 CAA11 0078, 2006-Ohio-3397, 2006 WL 1814336, \u00b6 52 (Hoffman, P.J., concurring). This concern is unwarranted and is based on a misreading of <em>State v. Mayl.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b528-15\">{\u00b6 2} The issue confronting us is whether, in light of <em>Mayl, </em>a blood sample taken outside the two-hour window set forth in R.C. 4511.19(D) is admissible in a prosecution for a violation of R.C. 2903.06 (vehicular homicide) that alleges a violation of R.C. 4511.19(A) (driving while intoxicated). For the reasons that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"323\">*323</page-number>follow, we hold that a blood sample taken outside the time frame set out in R.C. 4511.19(D) is admissible to prove that a person was under the influence of alcohol as proscribed by R.C. 4511.19(A)(1)(a) in the prosecution for a violation of R.C. 2903.06, provided that the administrative requirements of R.C. 4511.19(D) are substantially complied with and expert testimony is offered.</p>\n<p id=\"b529-4\">Relevant Background</p>\n<p id=\"b529-5\">{\u00b6 3} A January 12, 2005 one-car accident resulted in the death of Leondra Mayo. Appellee, Michael Hassler, was taken to the hospital, where police questioned him. His demeanor suggested to the police that he was intoxicated, but Hassler declined to provide a blood sample, and the parties stipulated that at least seven hours later, police obtained blood samples pursuant to a search warrant.</p>\n<p id=\"b529-6\">{\u00b64} On March 25, 2005, the Delaware County Grand Jury returned an indictment against Hassler, charging him with violating R.C. 2903.06(A)(1)(a), aggravated vehicular homicide. The count alleges that he caused the death of Mayo by committing a violation of R.C. 4511.19(A), which prohibits operating a vehicle while under the influence of alcohol.</p>\n<p id=\"b529-7\">{\u00b6 5} Hassler filed a motion to suppress the results of his blood-alcohol test, based in part on the fact that his blood was drawn for testing outside the two-hour time frame laid out in a former version of R.C. 4511.19(D)(1).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> See Am.Sub.S.B. No. 163, 149 Ohio Laws, Part II, 3553, 3577 (\u201cS.B. 163\u201d). Following a hearing on Hassler\u2019s motion held on November 10, 2005, the trial court granted the motion in a judgment entry dated November 21, 2005. In granting the motion, the trial court ruled that for the test results to be admissible pursuant to <em>Mayl, </em>the test had to be performed within two hours of the incident.</p>\n<p id=\"b529-8\">{\u00b6 6} The state appealed the trial court\u2019s order to the Fifth District Court of Appeals. The appellate court affirmed the trial court\u2019s judgment. We accepted jurisdiction over the state\u2019s discretionary appeal, which asks us to determine the following: whether in a prosecution for aggravated vehicular homicide that alleges driving under the influence of alcohol in violation of R.C. 4511.19(A)(1)(a), a blood sample taken outside the time limit in R.C. 4511.19(D) is admissible when the administrative requirements are substantially complied with and expert testimony is offered.</p>\n<p id=\"b529-9\">Analysis</p>\n<p id=\"b529-10\">{\u00b6 7} We begin our analysis with R.C. 4511.19. The General Assembly amended certain portions of that statute in 2006 to allow admissibility of testing <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"324\">*324</page-number>obtained within three hours of the alleged violation, but former R.C. 4511.19(D)(1) was otherwise similar to the current version. It provided: \u201cIn any criminal prosecution * * * for a violation of division (A) * * * of this section * * * the court may admit evidence on the concentration of alcohol * * * in the defendant\u2019s whole blood, blood serum or plasma, breath, urine, or other bodily substance at the time of the alleged violation as shown by chemical analysis of the substance withdrawn within two hours of the time of the alleged violation.\u201d S.B. 163.</p>\n<p id=\"b530-4\">{\u00b6 8} In <em>Lucas, </em>we were confronted with a situation similar to the one sub judice. Lucas had been charged with a violation of Section 434.01(a)(1) of the Newark Codified Ordinances, which proscribes operating a vehicle while under the influence of alcohol. The alleged violation occurred at 2:51 a.m., yet Lucas\u2019s blood was not withdrawn for blood-alcohol tests until 5:30 a.m.</p>\n<p id=\"b530-5\">{\u00b6 9} The Newark ordinance and R.C. 4511.19 contained the same two-hour time limit. Because Lucas\u2019s blood was taken after the two-hour limit specified in the ordinance, Lucas filed a motion to suppress the evidence, which the trial court granted. The appellate court affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b530-6\">{\u00b6 10} In reviewing Lucas\u2019s case, we first noted that in 1983, the General Assembly had amended R.C. 4511.19 to make \u201cit illegal to operate a vehicle not only while under the influence of alcohol, but also with a proscribed level of alcohol content in one\u2019s blood, breath, or urine.\u201d <em>Lucas, </em>40 Ohio St.3d at 103, 532 N.E.2d 130. The effect of the General Assembly\u2019s amendment was to divide R.C. 4511.19 into two classification of offenses: the offense of operating a vehicle while under the influence, and the \u201cper se\u201d offense.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b530-7\">{\u00b6 11} We affirmed the judgment of the court of appeals as to the motion to suppress regarding the per se violation. But we held that in prosecutions for violations of driving while impaired, \u201cthe behavior of the defendant * * * is the crucial issue. The accuracy of the test is not the critical issue as it is in prosecutions for <em>per se </em>violations.\u201d <em>Lucas, </em>40 Ohio St.3d at 104, 532 N.E.2d 130. We therefore concluded that because the test \u201cresults [were] not dispositive to a determination of innocence or guilt * * *, the fact that a bodily substance is withdrawn more than two hours after the time of the alleged violation does not, by itself, diminish the probative value of the test results in an R.C. 4511.19(A)(1) prosecution.\u201d Id. Based on these principles, we held that \u201cthe results of a properly administered bodily substances test presented with expert testimony may be admitted in evidence despite the fact that the bodily substance was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"325\">*325</page-number>withdrawn more than two hours from the time of the alleged violation.\u201d Id. at 105, 532 N.E.2d 130.</p>\n<p id=\"b531-5\">{\u00b6 12} Our recent decision in <em>Mayl </em>complements the <em>Lucas </em>holding. In <em>Mayl, </em>the defendant, who had been hospitalized after an accident, had had his blood drawn for medical reasons by nurses who, though perhaps qualified for permits under administrative regulations by the Ohio Department of Health (\u201cODH\u201d), had not obtained them. Mayl, who was then charged with a violation of R.C. 2903.06(A)(1) because the victim\u2019s death had been the \u201cproximate result of committing a violation of [R.C. 4511.19(A) ],\u201d moved to suppress his blood-alcohol test because \u201cit did not comply with ODH requirements.\u201d <em>Mayl, </em>106 Ohio St.3d 207, 2005-Ohio-4629, 833 N.E.2d 1216, \u00b6 5-6.</p>\n<p id=\"b531-6\">{\u00b6 13} Mayl contended that \u201cthe regulations pertaining to \u2018standards of observations, qualifications of personnel,\u2019 and other provisions relating to \u2018the taking and keeping of blood samples\u2019 were violated.\u201d Id. at \u00b6 6. The state countered that the requirements of R.C. 4511.19(D) were inapplicable because the test was done \u201cat the request of hospital staff as part of his medical treatment\u201d and not for law-enforcement purposes. Id. at \u00b6 53. The trial court denied the motion, and after the appellate court reversed the trial court\u2019s judgment, we affirmed the judgment of the court of appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b531-7\">{\u00b6 14} The majority in <em>Mayl </em>held that despite the reliability of blood tests taken according to medical standards, in law-enforcement contexts, the law nevertheless requires the state to show substantial compliance with ODH regulations in vehicular-homicide cases. Id. at \u00b6 55.</p>\n<p id=\"b531-8\">{\u00b6 15} As outlined above, <em>Lucas </em>and <em>Mayl </em>deal with two distinct issues. <em>Lucas </em>focused on the two-hour window prescribed in the statute, while <em>Mayl </em>addresses the nature of substantial compliance with the ODH regulations. In fact, like <em>Lucas </em>before it, <em>Mayl </em>acknowledges that the purpose of substantial compliance with the ODH regulations is \u201cto ensure the accuracy of bodily substance test results,\u201d <em>Mayl, </em>106 Ohio St.3d 207, 2005-Ohio-4629, 833 N.E.2d 1216, \u00b6 40; cf. <em>Lucas, </em>40 Ohio St.3d at 103, 532 N.E.2d 130. The time frame at issue here does not by itself implicate the accuracy of the test results. The substantial-compliance component of <em>Mayl, </em>therefore, does not overrule <em>Lucas.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b531-9\">{\u00b6 16} Furthermore, since <em>Lucas </em>was decided in 1988, the General Assembly has amended R.C. 4511.19(D) no fewer than eight times.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> At no point in enacting those previous eight amendments has the legislature rewritten or shown any <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"326\">*326</page-number>intent to supersede our holding in <em>Lucas. </em>When the legislature amends an existing statute, the presumption is that it is aware of our decisions interpreting it. <em>Clark v. Scarpelli </em>(2001), 91 Ohio St.3d 271, 278, 744 N.E.2d 719.</p>\n<p id=\"b532-4\">{\u00b6 17} Consequently, case law interpreting this statute, including Lucas\u2019s distinction between per se and under-the-influence offenses, was incorporated into R.C. 2903.06(A)(1)(a). Cf. <em>State v. Cichon </em>(1980), 61 Ohio St.2d 181, 183-184, 15 O.O.3d 209, 399 N.E.2d 1259. Moreover, as discussed above, our decision in <em>Mayl </em>did not eviscerate <em>Lucas\u2019s </em>rationale. Thus, <em>Lucas </em>remains the law.</p>\n<p id=\"b532-5\">{\u00b6 18} Because the state prosecuted Hassler for a violation of R.C. 2903.06(A)(1)(a) and alleged a violation of driving under the influence pursuant to R.C. 4511.19(A), \u201c[t]he test results, if probative, are merely considered in addition to all other evidence of impaired driving * * <em>Lucas, </em>40 Ohio St.3d at 104, 532 N.E.2d 130. The fact that Hassler\u2019s blood was withdrawn more than two hours after the incident does not bar the admission of the evidence, assuming the state can satisfy the standard enunciated in <em>Mayl.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b532-6\">Conclusion</p>\n<p id=\"b532-7\">{\u00b6 19} For the foregoing reasons, we hold that a blood sample taken outside the time frame set out in R.C. 4511.19(D) is admissible to prove that a person is under the influence of alcohol as proscribed by R.C. 4511.19(A)(1)(a) in a prosecution for a violation of R.C. 2903.06, provided that the administrative requirements of R.C. 4511.19(D) are substantially complied with and expert testimony is offered. We therefore reverse the judgment of the court of appeals and remand this cause to the trial court for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b532-8\">Judgment reversed and cause remanded.</p>\n<judges id=\"b532-9\">Lundberg Stratton, Lanzinger, and Cupp, JJ., concur.</judges>\n<judges id=\"ApC\">Moyer, C.J., and Pfeifer and O\u2019Donnell, JJ., dissent.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b529-11\">.

The trier of fact must find only \u201cthat the defendant operated a vehicle * * * and that the defendant\u2019s chemical test reading was at the proscribed level.\u201d <em>Lucas, </em>40 Ohio St.3d at 103, 532 N.E.2d 130.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b531-10\">.

See Am.Sub.S.B. No. 163, 149 Ohio Laws, Part II, 3553, 3577. But the unfortunate truth is that the blood sample was taken after a time lapse more than three times longer than allowed by former R.C. 4511.19, which provided that blood samples had to be \u201cwithdrawn within two hours of the time of the alleged <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"327\">*327</page-number>violation.\u201d That this court at one time allowed the admission of a test based on a sample withdrawn two and a half hours after the alleged violation does not require us to allow the admission of a test based on a sample withdrawn seven hours after the alleged violation. See <em>Newark v. Lucas </em>(1988), 40 Ohio St.3d 100, 532 N.E.2d 130.</p>\n<p id=\"b533-5\">{\u00b6 21} The General Assembly must have had a reason for including a bright-line standard in R.C. 4511.19. I suggest that the General Assembly is aware that most people in the state know to a reasonable degree of certainty the level of blood alcohol that constitutes a statutory violation and that the General Assembly didn\u2019t want that general knowledge of a per se violation to taint jurors\u2019 consideration of an under-the-influence offense. The court\u2019s holding today is contrary to the plain language of R.C. 4511.19, defeats whatever purpose the General Assembly had in supplying a hard time limit, and appears to be based on little more than \u201cwe did something similar once before.\u201d I dissent and would hold that the test results were inadmissible because the sample was taken more than two hours after the alleged violation.</p>\n<judges id=\"b533-6\">Moyer, C.J., concurs in the foregoing opinion.</judges>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-3\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b533-7\">O\u2019Donnell, J.,</author>\n<p id=\"AE8\">dissenting.</p>\n<p id=\"b533-8\">{\u00b6 22} Respectfully, I dissent.</p>\n<p id=\"b533-9\">{\u00b6 23} In my view, this case presents a straightforward issue of statutory construction. This court\u2019s purpose in construing statutes is to \u201cascertain and give effect to the legislative intent.\u201d <em>Carter v. Youngstown Div. of Water </em>(1946), 146 Ohio St. 203, 32 O.O. 184, 65 N.E.2d 63, paragraph one of the syllabus.</p>\n<p id=\"b533-10\">{\u00b6 24} The relevant version of 4511.19(D)(2) stated: \u201cIn a criminal prosecution * * * for a violation of division (A) of this section or for an equivalent offense, if there was at the time the bodily substance was withdrawn a concentration of less than the applicable concentration of alcohol specified in divisions (A)(2), (3), (4), and (5) of this section, that fact may be considered with other competent evidence in determining the guilt or innocence of the defendant.\u201d Am.Sub.S.B. No. 163, 149 Ohio Laws, Part II, 3553, 3577 (\u201cS.B. 163\u201d). That provision, however, must be read in pari materia with the rest of R.C. 4511.19, which sets forth the requirements for chemical analysis of bodily substances in the context of prosecutions for driving while under the influence of alcohol. See <em>State ex rel. Russo v. McDonnell, </em>110 Ohio St.3d 144, 2006-Ohio-3459, 852 N.E.2d 145, \u00b6 47, citing <em>State ex rel. Commt. for the Proposed Ordinance to Repeal Ordinance No. 146-02, W. End Blight Designation v. Lakewood, </em>100 Ohio St.3d 252, 2003-Ohio-5771, 798 N.E.2d 362, \u00b6 20 (statutory provisions relating to the same subject matter must be construed in pari materia and harmonized so as to give them full effect).</p>\n<p id=\"b534-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"328\">*328</page-number>{\u00b6 25} The relevant version of R.C. 4511.19(D)(1) provided: \u201cIn any criminal prosecution * * * for a violation of division (A) or (B) of this section * * * the court may admit evidence on the concentration of alcohol * * * in the defendant\u2019s whole blood, blood serum or plasma * * * as shown by chemical analysis of the substance withdrawn within two hours of the time of the alleged violation.\u201d S.B. 163.</p>\n<p id=\"b534-5\">{\u00b6 26} It is my view that we read these sections in pari materia in order to determine the meaning of the General Assembly. Hence, the time limit for the extraction of the bodily substance specified in R.C. 4511.19(D)(1) applies to the provisions of R.C. 4511.19(D)(2) in the context of R.C. 4511.19(A) offenses.</p>\n<p id=\"b534-6\">{\u00b6 27} It is true that this court refused to read an earlier version of this statute in an exclusionary manner in the context of R.C. 4511.19(A)(1) prosecutions, holding that \u201c[i]n a criminal prosecution for violation of R.C. 4511.19(A)(1), * * * the results of a properly administered bodily substances test presented with expert testimony may be admitted in evidence despite the fact that the bodily substance was withdrawn more than two hours from the time of the alleged violation.\u201d <em>Newark v. Lucas </em>(1988), 40 Ohio St.3d 100, 532 N.E.2d 130, paragraph two of the syllabus. However, in <em>Newark, </em>the tested blood had been withdrawn two hours and 39 minutes after the automobile accident \u2014 at least arguably in substantial compliance with the statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b534-7\">{\u00b6 28} Here, in contrast, the parties stipulated that the blood sample was extracted more than seven hours after the offense occurred. My departure from the majority view in this case is a purely factual one. Under no circumstances could a sample withdrawn seven to eight hours after an alleged violation constitute either actual or substantial compliance with the time requirement set forth in the applicable version of R.C. 4511.19(D)(1).</p>\n<p id=\"b534-8\">{\u00b6 29} This case arose at a time when an earlier version of R.C. 4511.19 controlled the admissibility of the results of tests performed upon a sample of an alleged violator\u2019s blood, breath, urine, or other bodily substance after the occurrence of an alleged violation. While the legislature has amended R.C. 4511.19, it is telling from my point of view that the legislature has now imposed a three-hour period and used the term \u201climit\u201d to express its intent that there be some degree of urgency in extracting a blood sample from a defendant. See 2005 Sub.S.B. No. 8, effective August 17, 2006. Thus, even under the current version of the statute, nothing approximates the seven to eight hours that elapsed between the accident and the blood draw in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b534-9\">{\u00b6 30} Although the majority baldly concludes that \u201c[t]he time frame at issue here does not by itself implicate the accuracy of the test results,\u201d nonetheless, the General Assembly has incorporated a time limit for the extraction of bodily <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"329\">*329</page-number>substances from alleged violators of both divisions (A) and (B) of the applicable version of R.C. 4511.19 and in its recently enacted version of this statute.</p>\n<attorneys id=\"AUU\">David A. Yost, Delaware County Prosecuting Attorney, and Paul Scarsella, Assistant Prosecuting Attorney, for appellant.</attorneys>\n<attorneys id=\"Azd\">Anthony M. Heald, for appellee.</attorneys>\n<p id=\"b535-4\">{\u00b6 31} I would hold that the state failed to comply with the statutory directive to timely withdraw the blood sample from Hassler for chemical analysis, and therefore, this evidence should not be admitted at trial, as the statute does not authorize its admission into evidence. Accordingly, I dissent.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
