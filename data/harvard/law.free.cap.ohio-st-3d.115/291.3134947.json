Domonko admitted her negligence. After a trial, the jury returned a verdict for the defense, apparently finding that there were no damages proximately caused by the collision. Bryan-Wollman moved for judgment notwithstanding the verdict or for a new trial; the motion was denied. Bryan-Wollman appealed, and the court of appeals reversed, concluding, \u201cThe trial court should have granted plaintiffs\u2019 motion for judgment notwithstanding the verdict or a new trial.\u201d 167 Ohio App.3d 261, 2006-0hio-2318, 854 N.E.2d 1108, \u00b6 21. We accepted Domonko\u2019s discretionary appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b497-14\">{\u00b6 2} Section 3(B)(3), Article IV of the Ohio Constitution states, \u201cNo judgment resulting from a trial by jury shall be reversed on the weight of the evidence except by the concurrence of all three judges hearing the cause.\u201d Though this constitutional language is admirably straightforward, in <em>State v. Thompkins </em>(1997), 78 Ohio St.3d 380, 678 N.E.2d 541,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> paragraph four of the syllabus, we <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"292\">*292</page-number>removed all opportunity to misconstrue Section 3(B)(3), Article IV by stating, \u201cTo reverse a judgment of a trial court on the weight of the evidence, when the judgment results from a trial by jury, a unanimous concurrence of all three judges on the court of appeals panel reviewing the case is required.\u201d The vote of the court of appeals panel in the case before us was two to one; therefore, if the decision to reverse the judgment of the jury was based on the weight of the evidence, the court of appeals decision must be reversed.</p>\n<p id=\"b498-4\">{\u00b6 3} The court of appeals stated, \u201cWhile the record contains a significant amount of disagreement over the extent of plaintiffs damages, there was a certain amount of uncontroverted evidence that plaintiff did suffer some damages as a proximate result of Ms. Domonko\u2019s negligence. In such cases, a defense verdict is against the manifest weight of the evidence because it is not supported by competent, credible evidence.\u201d 167 Ohio App.3d 261, 2006-Ohio-2318, 854 N.E.2d 1108, \u00b6 20. When applying a sufficiency-of-the-evidence standard, a court of appeals should affirm a trial court when \u201c \u2018the evidence is legally sufficient to support the jury verdict as a matter of law.\u2019 \u201d <em>Thompkins, </em>78 Ohio St.3d at 386, 678 N.E.2d 541, quoting Black\u2019s Law Dictionary (6th Ed.1990) 1433. See <em>C.E. Morris Co. v. Foley Constr. Co. </em>(1978), 54 Ohio St.2d 279, 8 O.O.3d 261, 376 N.E.2d 578, syllabus. When applying a civil manifest-weight-of-the-evidence standard, a court of appeals should affirm a trial court when the trial court\u2019s decision \u201cis supported by some competent, credible evidence.\u201d <em>State v. Wilson, </em>113 Ohio St.3d 382, 2007-Ohio-2202, 865 N.E.2d 1264, at \u00b6 32. Although <em>Wilson </em>states that \u201cthe standard in <em>C.E. Morris Co. </em>tends to merge the concepts of weight and sufficiency,\u201d the merger is not complete because of the separate constitutional significance accorded \u201cweight of the evidence\u201d by Section 3(B)(3), Article IV of the Ohio Constitution. Id. at \u00b6 26.</p>\n<p id=\"b498-5\">{\u00b6 4} It is clear to us that the court of appeals was applying a manifest-weight-of-the-evidence standard. First, the court of appeals referred to that standard. Second, the court of appeals stated part of the standard as enunciated in <em>Wilson. </em>Third, in its opinion the court of appeals acknowledged that there was evidence presented on both sides of the damages issue. And finally, the court of appeals <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"293\">*293</page-number>did not state that it was applying the sufficiency-of-the-evidence standard. We conclude that the court of appeals reversed a jury verdict based on the manifest weight of the evidence and that it did so other than unanimously. Accordingly, the judgment of the court of appeals was reached in violation of Section 3(B)(3), Article IV of the Ohio Constitution, and we reverse it and reinstate the jury verdict.</p>\n<attorneys id=\"Aua5\">James A.

More than 20 federal and state cases state that <em>Thompkins </em>has been \u201csuperseded by constitutional amendment on other grounds as stated by <em>State v. Smith </em>(1997), 80 Ohio St.3d 89, 684 N.E.2d 668.\u201d See, e.g., <em>State v. Love, </em>6th Dist. No. L-05-1087, 2006-Ohio-2925, 2006 WL 1580055, \u00b6 14; <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"292\">*292</page-number><em>State v. Litreal, </em>170 Ohio App.3d 670, 2006-Ohio-5416, 868 N.E.2d 1018, \u00b6 18, fn. 1; <em>Walker v. Timmerman-Cooper </em>(Oct. 5, 2006), S.D.Ohio No. I:05cvl03, 2006 WL 3242101, at *6. <em>Smith </em>states no such thing; neither reference to a <em>Thompkins </em>case in <em>Smith </em>indicates that <em>Thompkins </em>has been superseded. <em>Smith, </em>80 Ohio St.3d at 99, 113, 684 N.E.2d 668. Though <em>Smith </em>states that several cases have been \u201cmooted by the passage of the Issue I amendments to the Ohio Constitution,\u201d <em>Thompkins </em>is not one of those eases. Id. at 102, 684 N.E.2d 668, fn. 4. Finally, none of those eases that cite <em>Smith </em>provide a pinpoint citation (primarily because there isn\u2019t one), highlighting the risk of relying on generic cites to an entire opinion. The Sixth District Court of Appeals has also commented on the error. <em>State v. Quinn, </em>6th Dist. No. L-05-1302, 2007-Ohio-878, 2007 WL 625895, V 39, fn. 1.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
