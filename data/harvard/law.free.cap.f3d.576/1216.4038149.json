After review, we affirm in part and vacate and remand for further consideration and explanation by the district court.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1244-7\">I. BACKGROUND FACTS</p>\n<p id=\"AB3\">Douglas\u2019s \u00a7 3582(c)(2) motion was based on Amendment 706 to the Sentencing Guidelines, which lowered the offense levels in U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2Dl.l(c) for most crack cocaine offenses. Douglas\u2019s original sentence was 188 months\u2019 imprisonment, at the high end of the original guidelines range of 151 to 188 months. Upon consideration of Douglas\u2019s \u00a7 3582(c)(2) motion, the district court found that Amendment 706 applied to Douglas and reduced his sentence to 162 months, at the high end of the amended guidelines range of 130 to 162 months.</p>\n<p id=\"b1244-8\">The district court summarily granted Douglas\u2019s motion without a hearing or a response from the government. Thus, there is no sentencing transcript to review. The district court used the standard AO-247 form order, filling in the original and amended guideline ranges, checking the box indicating that Douglas\u2019s motion was granted, and reducing the sentence from 188 months to 162 months. The form order does not mention 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a) or the \u00a7 3553(a) factors. Although space is provided on the form for additional comments, the district court did not include any or otherwise explain its decision to impose a 162-month sentence. Douglas appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b1244-11\">II. DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b1244-12\">Under \u00a7 3582(c)(2), a district court has discretion to reduce a term of imprisonment of an already incarcerated defendant if that defendant \u201chas been sentenced to a term of imprisonment based on a sentencing range that has subsequently been lowered by the Sentencing Commission pursuant to 28 U.S.C. [\u00a7] 994(o).\u201d 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582(c)(2); <em>see also </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7 lB1.10(a)(l). In considering a \u00a7 3582(c)(2) motion, the district court engages in a two-step process. First, the district court must \u201crecalculate the sentence under the amended guidelines, first determining a new base level by substituting the amended guideline range for the originally applied guideline range, and then using that new base level to determine what ultimate sentence it would have imposed.\u201d <em>United States v. Bravo, </em>203 F.3d 778, 780 (11th Cir.2000). As to this first step, Douglas does not dispute that the district court properly calculated his amended guidelines range as 130 to 162 months.</p>\n<p id=\"b1244-13\">In the second step, the district court must then decide, in light of the 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a) factors and in its discretion, whether it will impose a new sentence within the amended guidelines range or retain the original sentence. <em>Id. </em>at 781. On appeal, Douglas argues that the district court erred in the second step by not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1219\">*1219</page-number>sentencing him below his amended guidelines range. However, this Court has expressly held that (1) if the defendant\u2019s original sentence was within the then-applicable guidelines range, at resentencing, the district court has no discretion to impose a sentence below the amended guidelines range and (2) <em>United States v. Booker, </em>543 U.S. 220, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005), and <em>Kimbrough v. United States, </em>552 U.S. 85, 128 S.Ct. 558, 169 L.Ed.2d 481 (2007), do not apply in \u00a7 3582(c)(2) proceedings. <em>See United States v. Melvin, </em>556 F.3d 1190, 1191-92 (11th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S.-, 129 S.Ct. 2382, 173 L.Ed.2d 1300 (2009); <em>United States v. Smith, </em>568 F.3d 923, 929 (11th Cir.2009) (stating that, after <em>Melvin, </em>the argument that a district court should have sentenced the defendant below the amended guidelines range is \u201cno longer tenable\u201d); <em>see also </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7 lB1.10(b)(2)(A)-(B) &amp; cmt. n.3.</p>\n<p id=\"b1245-7\">Although Douglas contends that this Court wrongly decided <em>Melvin, </em>we are bound by it \u201cunless and until it is overruled by this court en banc or by the Supreme Court.\u201d <em>United States v. Vega-Castillo, </em>540 F.3d 1235, 1236 (11th Cir. 2008), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 129 S.Ct. 2825, 174 L.Ed.2d 556 (2009). Because Douglas\u2019s original sentence was within the then-applicable guidelines range, the district court was not authorized to impose a new sentence below the amended guidelines range of 130 to 162 months. Thus, the district court did not err in denying Douglas\u2019s request for a below-guidelines sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b1245-11\">Douglas next argues that we nonetheless must vacate and remand for further proceedings because the record does not demonstrate that the district court considered the \u00a7 3553(a) factors prior to resentencing him within the amended guidelines range. In considering whether to impose an amended sentence, the district court must consider the \u00a7 3553(a) factors, but \u201cis not required to articulate the applicability of each factor, \u2018as long as the record demonstrates that the pertinent factors were taken into account by the district court.\u2019 \u201d <em>United States v. Williams, </em>557 F.3d 1254, 1256 (11th Cir.2009) (quotation marks omitted); <em>see Smith, </em>568 F.3d at 927-28; <em>United States v. Eggersdorf, </em>126 F.3d 1318, 1322 (11th Cir.1997).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> However, if it is not possible to determine from the record whether the district court considered the \u00a7 3553(a) factors, we must vacate and remand the case to the district court. <em>Williams, </em>557 F.3d at 1257. In <em>Williams, </em>the district court summarily granted the defendant\u2019s \u00a7 3582(c)(2) motion without mentioning the \u00a7 3553(a) factors. <em>Id. </em>at 1257. Because there was nothing in the record to show the district court had considered the \u00a7 3553(a) factors, we concluded that remand was necessary. <em>Id. </em>This case is like <em>Williams </em>in that nothing in the record shows that the district court considered the \u00a7 3553(a) factors in choosing a new sentence. There is no record except the form order, which does not mention the \u00a7 3553(a) factors at all. There is no government response or sentencing transcript.</p>\n<p id=\"b1246-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1220\">*1220</page-number>We reject the government\u2019s argument that this case is like <em>Eggersdorf. </em>Although the district court\u2019s \u00a7 3582(c)(2) order was short in <em>Eggersdorf, </em>it stated that the court had reviewed the defendant\u2019s motion, the government\u2019s brief in opposition, and the record. 126 F.3d at 1322. In addition, the defendant\u2019s \u00a7 3582(c)(2) motion set out the \u00a7 3553(a) factors \u201cword for word,\u201d and the government\u2019s brief stated specific factual reasons for denying the .motion that related to three of the \u00a7 3553(a) factors. <em>Id. </em>at 1322-23.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1246-4\">Here, the district court\u2019s form order in Douglas\u2019s case indicates that it granted the motion after \u201chaving considered [the defendant\u2019s] motion.\u201d Although Douglas\u2019s motion cites \u00a7 3553(a), it does not set forth the \u00a7 3553(a) factors, and there is no response from the government at all nor a sentencing transcript reflecting that the factors were argued by the parties. Douglas\u2019s motion points out that, while serving his sentence, Douglas had earned his G.E.D. and completed prison programs on anger management, drug treatment, and parenting. Post-sentencing conduct facts do not implicate the \u00a7 3553(a) factors. <em>See United States v. Lorenzo, </em>471 F.3d 1219, 1221 (11th Cir.2006) (explaining that \u201c[consideration of post-sentencing behavior ... directly contravenes two factors under \u00a7 3553.\u201d). Those facts, however, are relevant to the \u00a7 3582(c)(2) determination. <em>See </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7 1B1.10 cmt. n.l(B) (requiring a district court to consider the \u00a7 3553(a) factors and permitting it to consider the defendant\u2019s post-sentencing conduct in evaluating whether and to what extent to reduce a sentence). Therefore, unlike in <em>Eggersdorf, </em>the district court order\u2019s reference to Douglas\u2019s \u00a7 3582(c)(2) motion is insufficient to show that it considered the \u00a7 3553(a) factors.</p>\n<p id=\"b1246-7\">We are mindful that district courts must deal with a high volume of \u00a7 3582(c)(2) motions in the wake of Amendment 706. We do not suggest that the district court must always wait for a government response or hold a hearing before ruling on a \u00a7 3582(c)(2) motion or that it cannot use a form order in granting such a motion. However, the district court must ensure that the record reflects that it considered the \u00a7 3553(a) factors in deciding to reduce a sentence. Without such information, we cannot engage in meaningful appellate review and must vacate and remand.</p>\n<p id=\"b1246-8\">Accordingly, we affirm the district court\u2019s refusal to grant Douglas\u2019s request for a sentence below the amended guidelines range. However, there is nothing in the record to show the district court has considered the \u00a7 3553(a) factors and thus we vacate Douglas\u2019s sentence and remand for further consideration and explanation.</p>\n<p id=\"b1246-9\">AFFIRMED IN PART; VACATED AND REMANDED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1244-9\">. We review <em>de novo </em>the district court\u2019s legal conclusions regarding the scope of its authority under the Sentencing Guidelines in a \u00a7 3582(c)(2) proceeding. <em>United States v. White, </em>305 F.3d 1264, 1267 (11th Cir.2002). If a sentence reduction is authorized, we review the district court\u2019s decision to grant or deny a sentence reduction for an abuse of discretion. <em>Id.</em></p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b1245-10\">. The \u00a7 3553(a) factors include: (1) the nature and circumstances of the offense and history and characteristics of the defendant; (2) the need for the sentence to reflect the seriousness of the offense, (3) the need to promote respect for the law and afford adequate deterrence; (4) the need to protect the public; (5) the need to provide the defendant with education and vocational training and medical care; (6) the kinds of sentences available; (7) the guidelines range; (8) the pertinent policy statements of the Sentencing Commission; (9) the need to avoid unwarranted sentencing disparities; and (10) the need to provide restitution to victims. 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a)(l)-(7).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b1246-5\">. This case is also unlike <em>United States v. Smith, </em>decided after the briefing in this case concluded. In <em>Smith, </em>we affirmed a form order granting a \u00a7 3582(c)(2) motion and imposing a sentence at the high end of the amended guidelines range where: (1) the district court's order referenced the defendant\u2019s motion; (2) that motion noted that the court could \"consider all pertinent information applying Section 3553(a) factors\u201d and \u201cthen presented arguments as to why those factors supported imposing a more lenient sentence\u201d; (3) the district court held a sentence reduction hearing, at which the parties argued about the factors; and (4) the hearing transcript \"can only be read and understood as an elaborate explication of the \u00a7 3553(a) factors.\u201d 568 F.3d at 928-29.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
