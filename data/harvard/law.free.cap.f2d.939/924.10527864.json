Owen Forrester. Sun, proceeding <em>pro se </em>and <em>in forma pau-peris </em>(IFP), has attempted to compel the public retraction of certain alleged derogatory comments made by Judge Forrester at Sun\u2019s sentencing. Another district judge dismissed the action as frivolous pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(d).</p>\n<p id=\"b995-23\">This court reviews a district court\u2019s dismissal of an IFP complaint for abuse of discretion. <em>Clark v. State of Georgia Pardons &amp; Paroles Bd., </em>915 F.2d 636, 639 (11th Cir.1990). Under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(d), the district court may dismiss an IFP action if it is \u201cfrivolous or malicious.\u201d This circuit has defined a frivolous appeal under section 1915(d) as being one \u201c \u2018without arguable merit.\u2019 \u201d <em>Harris v. Menendez, </em>817 F.2d 737, 739 (11th Cir.1987)<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> (quoting <em>Watson v. Ault, </em>525 F.2d 886, 892 (5th Cir.1976)). \u201c \u2018Arguable means capable of being convincingly argued.\u2019 \u201d <em>Moreland v. Wharton, </em>899 F.2d 1168, 1170 (11th Cir.1990) (per curiam) (quoting <em>Menendez, </em>817 F.2d at 740 n. 5); <em>see Clark, </em>915 F.2d at 639 (\u201cA lawsuit [under section 1915(d)] is frivolous if the \u2018plaintiff\u2019s realistic chances of ultimate success are slight.\u2019 \u201d (quoting <em>Moreland, </em>899 F.2d at 1170)). In deciding whether an IFP appeal is frivolous, a district court determines whether there is \u201ca factual and legal basis, of constitutional dimension, for the asserted wrong, however inartfully pleaded.\u201d <em>Watson, </em>525 F.2d at 892; <em>Menendez, </em>817 F.2d at 739. Additionally, this court has held that a district court\u2019s \u201cauthority to dismiss a complaint as frivolous under section 1915(d) is broader than dismissal under Fed.R.Civ.P. 12.\u201d <em>Menendez, </em>817 F.2d at 739-40.</p>\n<p id=\"b995-24\">All of the alleged derogatory remarks by Judge Forrester occurred while he was conducting Sun\u2019s sentencing proceedings. A judge is absolutely immune from suit in performing his judicial responsibilities. <em>Dennis v. Sparks, </em>449 U.S. 24, 27-29, 101 S.Ct. 183, 186-87, 66 L.Ed.2d 185 (1980); <em>Menendez, </em>817 F.2d at 741. Therefore, Sun\u2019s action against Judge Forrester is completely without a legal basis, and the district court properly dismissed <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"926\">*926</page-number>this case prior to service of process. <em>Menendez, </em>817 F.2d at 742.</p>\n<p id=\"b996-4\">In addition to being frivolous because of legal deficiency, Sun\u2019s appeal is procedurally improper. Mandamus is a \u201cdrastic\u201d remedy which is authorized in only \u201c \u2018extraordinary situations.\u2019 \u201d <em>In re Paradyne Corp., </em>803 F.2d 604, 612 (11th Cir.1986) (per curiam) (quoting <em>Kerr v. United States District Court, </em>426 U.S. 394, 402, 96 S.Ct. 2119, 2123, 48 L.Ed.2d 725 (1976)). It is appropriate specifically to remedy a clear usurpation of power or abuse of discretion, \u201cwhen no other adequate means of obtaining relief is available.\u201d <em>In re Paradyne Corp., </em>803 F.2d at 612; <em>see In re Capital Cities/ABC, Inc., </em>918 F.2d 140, 144 (11th Cir.1990) (Even where exceptional circumstances exist to justify mandamus relief, the party seeking mandamus bears the burden of demonstrating a clear and indisputable right to issuance of the writ.). Because we have found that this case is frivolous and that the district judge did not abuse his discretion in dismissing the complaint, the requirements for mandamus relief are absent and Sun\u2019s request for mandamus is merit-less.</p>\n<p id=\"b996-5\">This case is patently frivolous. We consider another federal court\u2019s commentary, regarding an analogous IFP case in which the <em>pro se, </em>section 1915 plaintiff complained that the remarks made by the judge presiding at his trial had prejudiced his right to a fair trial, to be apt for this case:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b996-6\">Although the instant suit is groundless, it is not, however, without useful purpose. It provides the court with an opportunity to demonstrate the futility of pressing spurious claims upon a judicial system already overtaxed by serious business.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b996-7\">This complaint is totally lacking in merit and is nothing more than the vitriolic diatribe of a disgruntled litigant against the judge who heard his case. As such, its only potentially useful feature might be to discourage other malcontents from instituting similar merit-less actions.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b996-9\"><em>McCord v. Polozola, </em>555 F.Supp. 996, 998, 999 (M.D.La.1983) (Parker, C.J.). The judgment of the district court is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b995-19\">. We note that any portions of <em>Menendez </em>purportedly overruled by this court in <em>Prather v. Norman, </em>901 F.2d 915 (11th Cir.1990) in view of the Supreme Court\u2019s decision in <em>Neitzke v. Williams, </em>490 U.S. 319, 109 S.Ct. 1827, 104 L.Ed.2d 338 (1989), were upheld as \"good law\u201d in this circuit in <em>Clark, </em>915 F.2d at 640 n. 1.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
