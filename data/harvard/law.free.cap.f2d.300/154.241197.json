The decision was rendered by the Tax Court subsequent to the filing of Memorandum Findings of Fact and Opinion. The findings of fact are not clearly erroneous. On the contrary, they appear to be the only possible ones in the area of the major contention of petitioners. The theory advanced by petitioners that the $10,000 paid to Daniel O\u2019Madigan, Jr. by General Motors was on account of any consideration other than the transfer by him to General Motors of his stock is illusory at best.</p>\n<p id=\"b226-20\">Applying the well established rule that \u201cfindings will not be disturbed by an appellate court, unless found to be clearly erroneous\u201d (Wise v. Commissioner, 6 Cir., 1958, 260 F.2d 854),</p>\n<p id=\"b226-21\">The decision of the Tax Court is hereby affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
