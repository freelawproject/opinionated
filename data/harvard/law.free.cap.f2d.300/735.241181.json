The record contains a number of documents including an order of commitment, an order appointing a guardian <em>ad litem, </em>an order appointing a committee, the committee\u2019s petition for authority to sell assets, an order authorizing the sale, an order of restoration of legal status, and an order approving the committee\u2019s account. Thus it plainly appears that appellant\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"736\">*736</page-number>property was sold by a duly appointed officer of the District Court, as authorized by statute and with the court\u2019s approval.</p>\n<p id=\"b808-4\">This appeal is from an order of the District Court granting appellee\u2019s motion to dismiss the complaint. There is no genuine issue as to any material fact and appellee is entitled to judgment as a matter of law. The appropriate motion would have been one for summary judgment. The case is therefore remanded to the District Court with directions to enter judgment pursuant to Rule 12(b) and Rule 56, F.R.Civ.P., 28 U.S.C.A.</p>\n<p id=\"b808-5\">Remanded.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
