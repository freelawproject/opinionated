The difficulties of which he had complained stemmed basically from his repeated parking in what he alleged is a private alley, adjacent to premises on 12th Street <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"729\">*729</page-number>in downtown Washington where he sought to operate a dance club. Since police officers on several occasions issued parking tickets or impounded his car when so parked, appellant\u2019s first complaint <footnotemark><em>2</em></footnotemark><em> </em>in the instant action, C.A. 2638-\u25a060, charged that his civil rights were being violated by officers who \u201cconspired with Clark F. King, head of the Law Enforcement Branch of the Corporation \u25a0Counsel.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b801-5\">Then followed the amended complaint now before us. It is presently alleged that appellee, Bob Seidel, who does business as \u201cBob Seidel\u2019s Restaurant,\u201d<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> '\u201cpursuant to the conspiracy, and as an \u2022overt act towards its consumation [sic], * * * willfully and maliciously instigated and inspired\u201d the various officers, .appellees herein, to charge appellant with the offense of illegal parking in the alley and to impound his car.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> The District Court on February 15, 1961, granted the appellees\u2019 motion to dismiss the amended \u2022complaint.</p>\n<p id=\"b801-6\">Appellant thereupon filed his timely motion in which he asked the court \u201cto vacate the Order of February 15, 1961,\u201d [and] \u201cto allow him a reasonable time,\u201d again to amend Ms complaint.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Appellant\u2019s motion to vacate and to amend was denied by order entered March 30, 1961. Within 30 days, appellant on April 26, 1961, gave notice of his appeal \u201cfrom the Order of this [District] Court entered on the 30 day of March, 1961 in favor of defendants against said . plaintiff, dismissing the amended complaint by denying motion to vacate order, and allow plaintiff to amend.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b801-11\"> The police-officer appellees have asked this court to dismiss the appeal on the ground that the notice of appeal was filed 70 days after the February 15, 1961 order of dismissal. We conclude that the point is not well taken. The motion to vacate was timely since it was filed and served \u201cnot later than 10 days after entry of the judgment.\u201d<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> Accordingly and pursuant to Rule 73(a), the running of the time for appeal was terminated, and that time, 30 days, did not commence to run anew until the entry of the order disposing of the timely motion.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> For the purpose of so concluding, we may take it to be immaterial that denial of the motion to vacate was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"730\">*730</page-number>not appealable.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> We are satisfied under the circumstances as outlined, that the notice of appeal met the requirements of Fed.R.Civ.P. rule 73, 28 U.S.C.A.,<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> and accordingly our jurisdiction is established.</p>\n<p id=\"b802-4\">Since the appellant is representing himself we have considered his amended complaint and h'is arguments without regard to technical niceties.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> We are bound to observe, nevertheless, that he has misconceived his claim of right as to the police-officer appellees, sued \u201ceach in proper person.\u201d The District Court had before it all materials available of record, both from the earlier case and from the various stages of the instant case. Thus before the court was appellant\u2019s conclusory allegation set out in his previosly stricken complaint, pleading:</p>\n<p id=\"b802-5\">\u201cCount Five</p>\n<p id=\"b802-6\">(Abuse of Process-Conspiracy to Deprive Plaintiff of his Civil Rights)</p>\n<p id=\"b802-7\">* * * * * *</p>\n<p id=\"b802-8\">2. In and during the months of December 1959, and January 1960, the defendants conspired with Clark F. King, head of the Law Enforcement Branch of The Corporation Counsel, and others, to violate the Civil Rights of this plaintiff, provided for, and guaranteed to him by the Constitution, and the laws of The United States of America, and the rules and regulations issued thereunder, particularly with respect to the laws dealing with Civil Rights, and \u2018Due Process\u2019 and the protection to citizens granted thereunder, as set forth in the Supplement to Title 42, Section 1981, et seq. and more particularly Section 1983 and 1985 of The United States Code, Annotated.</p>\n<p id=\"AW6\">* * * \u2022\u00bb * <em>*\u00bb</em></p>\n<p id=\"b802-19\">Included in the record were the answering affidavits of named parties as well as that of the appellant. The District Judge clearly could see that this case differed fundamentally from the situation presenting specific violations of constitutional rights as considered in Monroe v. Pape.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> We may assume that no one has a constitutional \u201cright\u201d to park in a forbidden area, or that he is not being denied the equal protection of the laws if his car is ticketed as all others, should be when so parked. That police who ticket, or even impound, illegally parked cars generally are performing an authorized and immune function may be understood. Their acts in so doing have not been shown on the record here to have deprived this appellant of his \u201ccivil rights.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b802-20\">With the general situation so stated,, we turn to the order of February 15, 1961, wherein the trial judge recited he had considered \u201cthe pleadings, the record, the memoranda of points and authorities in support of and in opposition to the motions, and the affidavits relating thereto and other papers on file in the case.\u201d He granted the motions of Seidel and the police-officer appellees to dismiss and denied the alternative motions for summary judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b802-21\">It is clear, as the recitals, supra, indicate,<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> that the judge had considered the materials referred to. Among them was the appellant\u2019s affidavit pointing out his extensive service in the Navy and on merchant vessels as a result of which he <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"731\">*731</page-number>had been \u201cinitiated in the principles of security maintenance.\u201d As a shore patrol officer in New Zealand, he said, he had become \u201ccapable of distinguishing the degree of control which a police force is bringing upon a situation.\u201d An affidavit by Officer Alexander disclosed that early on the morning of March 30, 1960, .an officer had found open the front door to the studio, whereupon he called appellant \u201cat-his home and notified him that the officer assigned on foot patrol had found the front door to his premises unlocked,\u201d and appellant was requested \u201cto -come to his business premises and secure same.\u201d Appellant was informed that the officer would be standing by until appellant arrived. When at 3:30 A.M. the officer was still in the subject premises and appellant had not responded, he placed a second call to appellant\u2019s home and notified him that the officer was still awaiting appellant\u2019s arrival. He set forth that the telephone calls had been made in the course of his official duty as a police officer as required by the rules -of the Police Department. An affidavit by Officer Gainey revealed that on another occasion he had found the front door to the premises unlocked, and that the \u2022officers had inspected the studio, only to determine that apparently there had been no unlawful entry.</p>\n<p id=\"b803-5\">Such references, among others disclosed in the mass of available material, illustrate the background upon which the trial judge acted. He granted the motions to dismiss the amended complaint, no doubt because he concluded but did not say, that there had been a failure to state a claim upon which relief might be granted. In such situations, where \u201cmatters outside the pleading are presented to and not excluded by the court, the motion shall be treated as one for summary judgment and disposed of as provided in Rule 56 * * So reads Fed.R.Civ.P. rule 12(b). In the circumstances of this particular case it may seem immaterial<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> whether the appellant fails as to the police-officer appellees by whichever route was followed. Where, however, the trial judge has relied upon matters outside the pleading, the better practice, as Rule 56 makes clear, is that summary judgment should follow when, as here, the judge could find that there existed no genuine issue of <em>material </em>fact and that the movants were entitled to judgment as a matter of law.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b803-12\">The record as a whole disclosed, in short, that appellant had failed to state a case against the police officers. In some jurisdictions,<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> there is a well established rule of immunity from civil liability of public officers for an injury suffered as a result of acts within the scope of official authority. So to notice such a rule is not to say that police, as distinguished from other public officers identified in our cases, may never be liable for their tortious conduct. Nor on the other hand, <em>need </em>we say as to police officers that the absence of probable cause for the purported exercise of official authority or the presence of malice or other bad motive may not be sufficient to im<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"732\">*732</page-number>pose liability upon officers so acting.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> The question as to their liability, <em>vel non, </em>may turn on the particular function being performed by the police at the time and under the circumstances complained of. Their \u201cbad\u201d motive may in some situations become critical. Here it is not critical because the record relied upon by the trial judge shows, for the purposes of summary judgment, that there was no \u201cbad\u201d motive.</p>\n<p id=\"b804-4\">Certainly the appellant gains no status for his claims against the officers simply by joining them as alleged conspirators.<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> We reexamined the general rule applicable in such situations in Laughlin v. Rosenman.<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> As there reaffirmed, we deem it dispositive here.</p>\n<p id=\"b804-5\">A different situation arises with respect to the appellee Seidel. The series of controversies definitely had arisen be-, cause the appellant had claimed the privilege of parking in what he had alleged to be a private alley. He had pleaded that he had \u201cobtained from his landlord\u201d [not a party] \u201cequal and coextensive\u201d parking privileges in and the use of the \u201cprivate alley\u201d adjoining the business premises here involved, and that the alley for several years had been posted \u201cPrivate Property \u2014 No Trespassing.\u201d Seidel\u2019s answer in the earlier action and his affidavit herein recited that he had requested the appellant not to park in that alley so as to obstruct access to Seidel\u2019s Restaurant by repairmen, and garbage and trash collectors. He set out that \u201con occasions,\u201d when appellant had refused to refrain from blocking the alley, Seidel had reported the \u201cfacts\u201d to police for \u201cappropriate\u201d action. He denied the instigation of \u201cwrongful or illegal action\u201d against appellant, and his; alternative motions in the District Court sought either dismissal or judgment as a. matter of law.</p>\n<p id=\"b804-12\">Seidel has not alleged what \u201crights\u201d he-may have had to use the alley, upon what, basis he claimed to be entitled to unobstructed access to the rear of Seidel\u2019s. Restaurant, or how he may justify calling upon the police officers for \u201cappropriate\u201d action or whatever course they may have taken because of Seidel\u2019s complaints. Appellant had claimed that Seidel \u201cwillfully and maliciously instigated and inspired\u201d the various steps thereafter taken by the police.</p>\n<p id=\"b804-13\">Thus, it would appear that a genuine-issue of material fact has arisen in this critical area. Of course, Seidel\u2019s right to-complete exoneration from any possible liability may yet be demonstrated, but grounds for that result have not been shown. If Seidel acted wrongfully, he-may be liable,<footnotemark>19</footnotemark> but lacking an adequate-record on this aspect, we express no-final opinion on the point.</p>\n<p id=\"b804-14\">It may develop that there was here involved a public alley,<footnotemark>20</footnotemark> the use of which is governed by D.C.Code \u00a7 40-810 (1961) and District of Columbia Traffic &amp; Motor-Vehicle Regulations \u00a7 79(c) which provides :</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b804-15\">\u201cNo person shall park a vehicle . . . otherwise than temporarily for the purpose of and while actually engaged in loading or unloading of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"733\">*733</page-number>passengers or freight in any of the following places:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b805-4\">* * * * -\u00bb *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b805-5\">\u201c6. In any public alley.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b805-6\">The judgment of the District Court had dismissed the action against the police-officer appellees and Seidel.<footnotemark>21</footnotemark> That judgment is reversed.</p>\n<p id=\"b805-7\">The case will be remanded to the District Court:</p>\n<p id=\"b805-8\">(1) with directions to enter summary judgment in favor of the police-officer appellees <footnotemark>22</footnotemark>; and</p>\n<p id=\"b805-9\">(2) as to Seidel, for such further proceedings as the parties may be advised.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b800-18\">. An earlier action entitled Gager v. District of Columbia, C.A. 739-60, D.D.C., was dismissed. There he sought to charge the District Commissioners with responsibility for the actions of certain police officers. Cf. Monroe v. Pape, 365 U.S. 167, 187-192, 81 S.Ct. 473, 5 L.Ed.2d 492 (1961); Brasier v. City of Tulsa, Oklahoma, 268 F.2d 558 (10 Cir. 1959), cert. denied, 361 U.S. 964, 80 S.Ct. 595. 4 L.Ed.2d 546 (1960).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b801-7\">. That complaint was also dismissed but with leave to amend. Mr. King has not been\u2019named as a party herein although he is alleged to have conspired with all other appellees \u201cwrongfully to degrade, humiliate, and injure the plaintiff, in his good name, his reputation personally, and to ruin his efforts in reorganizing the aforesaid dance club.\u201d Our present appellees are \u201cBob Seidel\u201d and eighteen police officers.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b801-8\">. The record discloses that the restaurant is on Pennsylvania Avenue, around the corner from the appellant\u2019s rented premises. Access to the kitchen and rear entrance of Seidel\u2019s restaurant is gained through the controversial alley.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b801-9\">. Basing each of four counts upon the. alleged conspiracy, appellant, appearing pro se, has entitled his complaint \u201cConspiracy-False Arrest-Malicious Prosecution-Wrongful Conversion of Property-Threats-Slander and Defamation of Character.\u201d A second count charges that appellant was slandered and mocked by -the police; a third count charges police with illegal entry upon bis premises; and a fourth count charges that his car has been taken from him and concealed by tlxe police, all \u201cpursuant to the conspiracy.\u201d No special damage has been alleged and no specific business damage has been pleaded. Cf. Fowler v. Curtis Publishing Co., 86 U.S.App.D.C. 349, 182 F.2d 377 (1950).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b801-14\">.
