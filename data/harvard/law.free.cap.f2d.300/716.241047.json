There is no allegation or finding of fraud, mistake or overreaching.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> And the contemporaneous oral \u201cunderstanding\u201d upon which the trial court relied contradicts the plain language of the contract.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AM5\">\u201c[W]here parties enter into a written contract, their rights must be controlled thereby, and, in the absence of fraud or mistake, all evidence of any contemporaneous oral agreement on the same subject matter, contradicting, varying, modifying, or adding to the terms of the written agreement is inadmissible. Shankland v. Mayor, etc., 5 Pet. 390, 30 U.S. 390, 8 L.Ed. 166, affirming Shankland v. Corporation of Washington, Fed.Cas.No. 12,703, 3 Cranch C.C. 328; Selden v. Myers, 20 How. 506, 61 U.S. 506, 15 L.Ed. 976; Willard v. Tayloe, 8 Wall. 557, 75 U. S. 557, 19 L.Ed. 501. The written contract merges all previous negotiations and is presumed, in law, to express the final understanding of the parties. Brawley v. United States, 96 U.S. 168, 24 L.Ed. 622; Van Ness v. Mayor, etc., of City of Washington, 4 Pet. 232, 29 U.S. 232, 7 L.Ed. 842, affirming Van Ness v. United States, Fed.Cas.No. 16,868, 2 Cranch C.C. 376, 2 D.C. 376; Kinney v. Mc-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"718\">*718</page-number>Nabb, 44 App.D.C. 340\u201d [Boomhower, Inc. v. Louis L. Lavine, 151 F.Supp. 563, 567 (D.D.C.1957).]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"Ae-\">It follows that the instant contract must be enforced as written.</p>\n<p id=\"A3M\">The question remaining is whether the defendants are jointly liable for the entire fee or severally liable for only a \u201cpro rata\u201d share.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> We are constrained to hold that they are jointly liable for the entire fee.</p>\n<p id=\"AV6Q\">The contract provides that \u201cthe members of the Committee as such assume[d] responsibility for payment,\u201d and contains no words of severance. The general rule is \u201cthat the obligation created by the promise of several persons is joint unless the contrary is made evident.\u201d 2 Willis-ton, Contracts \u00a7 323 (1936). Cf. Restatement, Contracts \u00a7 112 (1932). Moreover, the contract identifies the promisors as \u201cthe members of the Committee\u201d and discloses an undivided promise to pay the entire fee. This negates the view that each member made a separate promise to pay a pro rata share. See 4 Corbin, Contracts \u00a7 925 (1951). Compare Huff v. Doerr, 206 Mo.App. 563, 228 S.W. 849 (1921), with O\u2019Connor v. Hooper, 102 Cal. 528, 36 P. 939 (1894). Cf. Olson v. Forster, 42 Cal.App.2d 493, 109 P.2d 388 (1941). Compare Adriatic Fire Ins. Co. v. Treadwell, 108 U.S. 361, 2 S.Ct. 772, 27 L.Ed. 754 (1883). Finally, the common object of the members of the Creditors\u2019 Committee \u2014 to secure appellant\u2019s legal services \u2014 suggests that their liability is joint. 4 Corbin, Contracts \u00a7 926 (1951).</p>\n<p id=\"AjnB\">Whether the members of the Creditors\u2019 Committee are entitled to contribution <em>inter se </em>or from other creditors, or both, *s no^ before us.</p>\n<p id=\"A_W\">Reversed and remanded.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b789-16\">. The court below awarded plaintiff $505.-83, presumably as third party beneficiary of another contract in which defendants as creditors promised to pay a portion of the Committee\u2019s expenses based upon their share of the corporation\u2019s debts.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b789-23\">. Fraud is an affirmative defense which must be pleaded. Fed.R.Civ.P. rule 8(c), 28 U.S.C.A.</p>\n<p id=\"b789-25\">Counsel admitted that defendants are experienced businessmen, well aware of the importance of written agreements. Compare Hill v. Marston, 65 App.D.C. 250, 82 F.2d 856 (1936).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"A1K\">. The terms joint, several, and joint and several have occasionally been confused. Co-promisors are liable (1) jointly if all of them have promised the entire performance; or (2) severally if they have promised separate performances. At common law joint promisors had to be joined in a single suit, but any one of them could be compelled to satisfy the entire judgment. 4 Corbin, Contracts \u00a7\u00a7 920, 929 (1951). To obviate the necessity for joining all the promisors, and to avoid problems of survivorship, release of co-obligors, and the like, the promisee obtained the promisors\u2019 agreement to be liable jointly and severally; i. e., collectively and individually liable for the whole performance.</p>\n<p id=\"As9C\">In this jurisdiction, statutes authorize separate suits against joint promisors even if they have not agreed to be liable jointly and severally. D.C.Code \u00a7\u00a7 13-401, 16-901 (1961). Those statutes do not determine, of course, whether each co-promisor has agreed to be liable for the entire performance or only for a part thereof. That determination is governed by the terms of the contract.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
