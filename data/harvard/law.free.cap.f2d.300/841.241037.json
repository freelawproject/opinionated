Hyde, petitioner herein, was sentenced to four years\u2019 imprisonment by the United States District Court for the District of Nevada. On July 5,1955, he was paroled. On June 8, 1960, he was returned to prison as a parole violator and is now confined therein. On July 20, 1961, he applied to the United States District Court for the Southern District of California for a writ of habeas corpus, contending that he was entitled to his release under the good time provisions set out in 18 U.S. C.A. \u00a7\u00a7 4161-62-63-65.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b914-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"842\">*842</page-number>The district court denied the writ and petitioner timely appealed to this court which has jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 1291.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b914-4\">Petitioner contends that under 18 U.S. C.A. \u00a7 4161 he was entitled on July 5, 1955, to 126 days good time (18 months times 7), and that under 18 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 4162 he was then entitled to 13 days industrial good time. Under his calculation he had served as of July 5, 1955, the date of his parole, 540 days (18 times 30) plus 126 days good time (18 times 7) plus 13 days industrial good time, or a total of 679 days.</p>\n<p id=\"b914-5\"> From the date of his return to prison as a parole violator on June 8, 1960, until July 20, 1961, the date of his application for a writ of habeas corpus, a total of 408 days elapsed. If this figure were added to 679 days, which petitioner contends that he was entitled to, the total would equal 1087 days. Inasmuch as his total sentence was four years or 1460 days, it is apparent that petitioner\u2019s application for release was premature at the time the application for writ of habeas corpus was filed.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> This of course does not even take into consideration the provisions of section 4165 which provides for the forfeiture of good time if \u201ca prisoner commits any offense or violates the rules of the institution.\u201d<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b914-16\">The judgment of the district court is affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b913-13\">. \u201c\u00a7 4161. Computation generally</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b913-14\">\u201cEach prisoner convicted of an offense against the United States and confined in a penal or correctional institution for a definite term other than for life, whose record of conduct shows that he has faithfully observed all the rules and has not been subjected to punishment, shall be entitled to a deduction from the term of his sentence beginning with the day on <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"842\">*842</page-number>which the sentence commences to run, as follows:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b914-7\">:&gt;\u00ab &gt;f: # sjs</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b914-8\">\u201cSeven days for each month, if the sentence is not less than three years and less than five years.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"A0G\">* * * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"Anr\">\u201cWhen two or more consecutive sentences are to be served, the aggregate of the several sentences shall be the basis upon which the deduction shall be computed.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"A7M\">\u201c\u00a7 4162.

Appellant filed the appeal in propria persona. However, at appellant\u2019s request, court-appointed counsel Marcia King presented appellant\u2019s claims at oral argument.

Swope, 225 F.2d 674 (8th Cir. 1955). Appellant\u2019s writ was premature even if it be assumed that he was entitled to additional good time for the period from the date of his recommittal on June 8, 1960, to the date of his filing of application with the district court on July 20, 1961.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b914-21\">.
