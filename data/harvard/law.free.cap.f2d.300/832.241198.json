Proe. 28 U.S.C.A., in its finding that Board had reasonable cause to believe that Engineers had engaged in an unfair labor practice or practices?; and</p>\n<p id=\"b906-6\">(2) Did the District Court abuse its judicial discretion in issuing the temporary injunction?</p>\n<p id=\"b906-7\">The facts as adduced by the testimony below and evidenced by the record may be summarized as follows:</p>\n<p id=\"b906-8\">On May 11 and 15, 1961, Nichols Electric Company (\u201cNichols\u201d) filed charges with John J. Cuneo, Regional Director of the Twenty-second Region of the National Labor Relations Board, alleging that Local No. 825, International Union of Operating Engineers, AFL-CIO (\u201cEngineers\u201d) had engaged and was engaging in unfair labor practices proscribed by Sections 8(b) (4) (B) and (D) of the National Labor Relations Act (\u201cAct\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b906-9\">After investigation, the Regional Director concluded the charges had merit and warranted proceedings before the National Labor Relations Board and petitioned the District Court for the injunction now under review.</p>\n<p id=\"b906-12\">The hearing before the District Court developed this situation:</p>\n<p id=\"b906-13\">Elmhurst Contracting Company (\u201cElmhurst\u201d) was awarded a contract by the State of New Jersey to construct the Spruce Run Reservoir near Clinton, New Jersey. Elmhurst sublet a $2,600,-000 subcontract to Selby Drilling Corporation (\u201cSelby\u201d) which in turn subcontracted to Nichols, an electrical contractor, the erection of an electric power line. The latter work necessitated the erection of poles from which the power line was to be strung. For the past ten or twelve years Nichols used an auger drill mounted on and powered by a truck to dig the holes for the poles and a boom attached to the truck to lift the poles into place. Nichols always assigned the operation of the auger and boom to its linemen, who are members of International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers, AFL-CIO (\u201cElectricians\u201d). Nichols had no contract with Engineers for the operation of this equipment; Engineers were never certified by the Board as the collective bargaining representative of any of Nichols\u2019 employees; and Nichols had not been ordered by the Board to bargain with Engineers. The latter, however, had contracts with Elmhurst and Selby recognizing it as the bargaining representative for all employees operating power equipment of the kind <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"835\">*835</page-number>here involved. These contracts contain the following clause:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b907-4\">\u201cThis Agreement shall bind all sub-contractors while working for an Employer who is a party to this Agreement. Any Employer who sublets any of his work must sublet the same subject to all the terms and conditions of this Agreement.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b907-5\">On May 3, 1961, Nichols\u2019 men arrived at the reservoir site with the powered auger and boom to dig the holes and set the poles for the power line. One Gatti, who was Engineers\u2019 job steward and an employee of Selby, told Nichols\u2019 linemen, \u201cYou don\u2019t dig those holes with that machine. That is the Operating Engineers\u2019 work\u201d. Nichols,\u2019 supervisor, O\u2019Brien, then spoke to Yanuzzi, Selby\u2019s lead mechanic in charge of Selby\u2019s operating engineers, and was told by him that Nichols would have to hire members of Engineers to operate the auger and boom. After consulting with Shaffer, Electricians\u2019 business agent, who claimed that operation of the equipment was Electricians\u2019 work, O\u2019Brien decided not to hire Engineers\u2019 members, and the next day Nichols\u2019 employees dug three holes manually.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> On May 9th, Nichols again brought its power equipment to the job site, and its employees started digging holes with the power-driven auger. Gatti immediately summoned fifteen to twenty members of Engineers employed on the job by Selby and Elmhurst and said to them, \u201cSee what they are doing? They are taking your work away from you.\u201d At Gatti\u2019s direction some of the engineers stood in front of the truck so that is could not be moved; the remainder sat on the power line poles which were lying alongside the truck. Yanuzzi advised the members of Engineers to return to work but they refused. When O\u2019Brien sought assistance from a State Trooper, Gatti said that the auger was the type of equipment used by engineers and that Nichols\u2019 linemen \u201cwere not going to use it.\u201d Finally, at 3:30 in the afternoon, after the work stoppage had been in progress for three or four hours, Nichols removed the equipment, and the engineers immediately returned to work. Thereafter Nichols\u2019 employees dug the holes manually without interference from Engineers. On May 17, 1961 at a meeting held in Newark at the request of a representative of the State of New Jersey, Engineers\u2019 business agent claimed that the operation of this type of equipment belonged to his members; Electricians\u2019 business agent, on the other hand, claimed that the operation of this equipment on power line construction was Electricians\u2019 work that had been performed by members of his local for at least thirty years.</p>\n<p id=\"b907-9\">By the time of the hearing in the court below on June 14, 1961, Nichols had almost completed the work on its subcontract with Selby.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> However, the dispute between Electricians and Engineers as to whose members should operate the power equipment had not been settled; and Elmhurst\u2019s project manager, while admitting that there was very little, and possibly not any, electrical work to be done on the project, nevertheless testified that Nichols was one of several companies which at Elmhurst\u2019s request had submitted estimates on further electrical work to be performed at the Spruce Run Reservoir. Nichols\u2019 headquarters were in New Jersey and Nichols had engaged in power line construction in that State on a number of occasions during the preceding several years.</p>\n<p id=\"b907-10\">The District Court, in its oral opinion, expressed agreement with the version of the events as described in the evidence above summarized.</p>\n<p id=\"b908-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"836\">*836</page-number>In its \u201cOrder Granting Temporary Injunction\u201d the District Court enjoined Engineers from engaging in specified conduct designed (1) \u201cto force or require\u201d Selby, Elmhurst or others \u201cto cease doing business with\u201d Nichols, and (2) to compel Nichols to assign the operation of its power equipment to Engineers.</p>\n<p id=\"b908-4\">On this appeal Engineers urges (1) there did not exist a \u201cjurisdictional dispute\u201d between it and Electricians and that the sole dispute was between it and Nichols, and accordingly there was no basis for the application of Section 8(b) (4) (D); and (2) the issuance of the temporary injunction was in error since \u201cthe facts of the present case do not support\u201d its issuance.</p>\n<p id=\"b908-5\"> On review of the record we cannot say that the District Court was \u201cclearly erroneous\u201d in its fact-finding \u201cthat there is reasonable cause to believe that respondent [Engineers] has engaged in, and is engaging in, acts and conduct in violation of Section 8(b) (4) (i) (ii) subparagraphs (B) and (D) * * * and that such acts and conduct will likely be repeated or continued unless enjoined.\u201d <footnotemark>7</footnotemark> Nor can we say that the District Court abused its discretion in issuing the temporary injunction under the evidence earlier recited.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> Since the scope of our review \u201cis limited to a determination whether the district court\u2019s finding that there is reasonable cause to believe that a violation of the Act as charged has been committed is clearly erroneous\u201d and whether the District Court abused its discretion in granting injunctive relief,<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> further consideration becomes unnecessary. Penello v. Local No. 59 Sheet Metal Workers, 195 F.Supp. 458 (D.Del.1961) cited by Engineers is inapposite on its facts.</p>\n<p id=\"b908-9\">For the reasons stated the Order Granting Temporary Injunction will be affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b905-8\">. 29 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 160(Z); 73 Stat. 544.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b905-9\">. 29 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 158(b) (4) (B) and (D).

It is regrettable that the District Court did not, as required by Rule 52(a), Fed. Rules Civ.Proc. \u201cfind the facts specially and state separately its conclusions of law thereon.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b906-10\">. In Schauffler v. Local 1291, International Longshoremen\u2019s Association, 292 F.2d 182 (1961) Chief Judge Biggs, speaking for this Court said (p. 187):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b906-11\">\u00ab* * * the scope of * * * [this Court\u2019s] review of Section 10(\u00cd) proceedings is limited to a determination whether the district court\u2019s finding that there is reasonable cause to believe that a violation of the Act as charged has been committed is clearly erroneous. In applying this standard it must be borne in mind that a Section 10(1) injunction is interlocutory in nature and only remains in force pending the final adjudication of the Board with respect to the unfair labor practice charge. The Section 10(1) procedure reflects the congressional determination that certain unfair labor practices are so disruptive that where there is reasonable cause to believe that they are being engaged in their continuance during the pendency of charges before the Board should not be permitted. * * * The Board need not show that an unfair labor practice has been committed, but need only demonstrate that there is reasonable cause to believe that the elements of an unfair labor practice are present. Nor need the Board conclusively show the validity of the propositions of law underlying its charge; it is required to demonstrate merely that the propositions of law which it has applied to the charge are substantial and not frivolous (citing cases). The final adjudication of the Board of both questions of fact and law is, of course, ultimately reviewable by this court pursuant to Section 10(e) and Section 10(f) of the N. L. R. A.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AMt\">To the same effect see Schauffler v. Highway Truck Drivers and Helpers, 230 F.2d 7, 9 (3 Cir. 1950).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b907-6\">. Yanuzzi testified that on May 3d, O\u2019Brien agreed to hire engineers to operate the power equipment but that O\u2019Brien refused to put them to work when they arrived. O\u2019Brien denied that he agreed to hire engineers or that engineers came to operate the equipment. The trial judge adverted to, but did not resolve, this dispute in the testimony.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"AIM\">. The use of the power equipment had been completed.

The circumstance that the particular job had been completed did not foreclose the granting of injunctive relief in view of the District Court\u2019s specific holding that Engineers\u2019 \u201cacts and conduct will likely be repeated or continued unless enjoined.\u201d Schauffler v. United Association of Journeymen, 218 F.2d 476, 480 (3 Cir. 1955); Shore v.
