Jose T. Tawaran, a United States soldier, died in action in the Philippines April 15, 1942. His widow filed no claim until December 20, 1949, which was not within the period allowed by the statute. The Veterans Administration denied her claim as such but originally allowed it as a claim on behalf of the couple\u2019s minor son, born March 15, 1941, and made an award to him. Appellant Bank qualified as the minor\u2019s guardian and received insurance benefits for him. The Veterans Administration afterwards terminated the award. The Bank repaid on demand the benefits it had received, sued on January 4, 1961, for the entire $5000 of insurance, and now appeals from an adverse judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b791-20\">Congress provided this gratuitous insurance, which requires neither application nor premium, \u201cbecause many of the personnel of our armed forces (1) were unable to comply with the prerequisites necessary to the granting of insurance by reason of extended duty in the North Atlantic, Hawaii, the Philippines, and other outlying bases; (2) had failed or neglected to apply for such insurance in the expectation that their service would be peacetime service only; and (3) by reason of the suddenness with which war was thrust upon us, had not sufficient time to apply for such insurance prior to engaging in combat.\u201d 38 U.S.C. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"720\">*720</page-number>\u00a7 802(d) (4) (1952), 55 Stat. 847. The Supreme Court has said of this Act: \u201cThe statutory provisions, where ambiguous, are to be construed liberally to effectuate the beneficial purposes that Congress had in mind.\u201d United States v. Zazove, 334 U.S. 602, 610, 68 S.Ct. 1284, 92 L.Ed. 1601. We said in United States v. Philippine National Bank, \u201cThe provision for gratuitous insurance was generous legislation, plainly adopted for humane and patriotic reasons.\u201d 110 U.S. App.D.C. 250, 251-252, 292 F.2d 743, 744-745. We there interpreted the word \u201cchild\u201d, in the statutory enumeration of beneficiaries, as including an illegitimate child. See also Woodward v. United States, 341 U.S. 112, 71 S.Ct. 605, 95 L.Ed. 648; Carpenter v. United States, 3 Cir., 168 F.2d 369, 3 A.L.R.2d 841.</p>\n<p id=\"b792-4\">It is clear and unquestioned that not only the insured and his widow, but also his child, were within the class of persons whom Congress intended to benefit. The question is whether the statute is so drawn that the child\u2019s right depends upon the widow\u2019s and his claim is barred when hers is.</p>\n<p id=\"b792-5\">The statute makes gratuitous insurance benefits payable \u201c(A) to the widow or widower of the insured, if living and while unremarried; (B) if no widow or widower entitled thereto, to the child or children of the insured, if living * 38 U.S.C. \u00a7 802(d) (2) (1952). There is now \u201cno widow * * * entitled\u201d. The widow allowed her rights to lapse. Since the statute is to be construed liberally, we think the fact that there was once a widow \u201centitled\u201d is not controlling and clause (B) applies. By its terms \u201cthe child\u201d is entitled.</p>\n<p id=\"b792-10\">The statute provides that suit shall not be allowed unless it is brought \u201cwithin six years after the right accrued for which the claim is made. For the purposes of this section it shall be deemed that the right accrued on the happening of the contingency on which the claim is founded.\u201d 38 U.S.C. \u00a7 784(b) (1958).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Although no right actually accrued to the child when the insured died, because his mother\u2019s rights were prior to his, appellee urges that the \u201ccontingency on which the claim is founded\u201d was the death of the insured. If this be true, it does not follow that the claim of appellant\u2019s ward is barred. For the ward is an infant, and the statute provides that \u201cInfants, insane persons, or persons under other legal disability * * * shall have three years in which to bring suit after the removal of their disabilities.\u201d 38 U.S.C. \u00a7 784 (b) (1958).</p>\n<p id=\"b792-11\">In the Woodward case the Court said: \u201cThe short of the matter is that Congress has not expressed itself in regard to the question before us.\u201d 341 U.S. at 113, 71 S.Ct. at 606. Perhaps this is true here. If so, we resolve the ambiguity in accordance with the settled principle that this legislation is to be construed so as to give effect to its humane purpose. Nothing in the statute requires us to think Congress intended a child\u2019s rights to be cut off before they arose. We are told that the Veterans Administration formerly took a view similar to ours.</p>\n<p id=\"ApK\">Reversed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b791-14\">. 38 U.S.C. \u00a7 802(d) (2) (1952). Although the National Service Life Insurance Act of 1940, 54 Stat. 1008-1014, as amended, 55 Stat. 846, has been repealed and parts of it have not been reenacted, provisions relevant to this litigation remain effective by virtue of a savings clause, 38 U.S.C. \u00a7 788 (1058).
