Mr. Justice Murphy, speaking for the Court in Brotherhood of Railroad Trainmen v. Baltimore and Ohio Railroad Company, 331 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"844\">*844</page-number>U.S. 519, 524, 525, 67 S.Ct. 1387, 91 L.Ed. 1646 (1947), spelled out the applicable rule of appealability in detail. Summarizing his discussion he wrote:</p>\n<p id=\"b916-4\">\"Our jurisdiction to consider an appeal from an order denying intervention thus depends upon the nature of the applicant\u2019s right to intervene. If the right is absolute, the order is appealable and we may judge it on its merits. But if the matter is one within the discretion of the trial court and if there is no abuse of discretion, the order is not appealable and we lack power to review it. In other words, our jurisdiction is identified by the necessary incidents of the right to intervene in each particular instance. We must therefore determine the question of our jurisdiction in this case by examining the character of the Brotherhood\u2019s right to intervene in the proceeding brought under \u00a7 16(12) of the Interstate Commerce Act.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b916-5\">This rule was followed in Sutphen Estates, Inc., v. United States, 342 U.S. 19, 20, 72 S.Ct. 14, 96 L.Ed. 19 (1951). But see Cameron v. President and Fellows of Harvard College, 157 F.2d 993, 997 (C.A. 1, 1946).</p>\n<p id=\"b916-6\">To determine our jurisdiction over this appeal we therefore turn to consideration of the \u201cnature\u201d or \u201ccharacter\u201d of the trustee\u2019s right to intervene to see whether he has an absolute right or is only privileged to intervene in the discretion of the court below.</p>\n<p id=\"b916-7\">The trustee does not invoke the provisions of subsection (b) of Rule 24, Fed.R. Civ.P., 28 U.S.C., dealing with permissive intervention his only claim is of an absolute right to intervene under subsection (a) (3) of the above Rule quoted in the margin.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Conceding, as he must, that the statutory lien of the United States for taxes can be asserted against intangible personal property such as debts, see United States v. Eiland, 223 F.2d 118, 121 (C.A. 4, 1955), and cases cited, he rests his assertion of an absolute right to intervene on the proposition that the Notices of Levy (Form 668-A) served by the United States on the four debtors of the bankrupt pursuant to \u00a7 6331 of Title 26 U.S.C., did not reduce the government\u2019s claims against them to \u201cpossession\u201d within the meaning of \u00a7 67, sub. c of the Bankruptcy Act, 11 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 107, sub. c quoted in material part in the margin below.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Wherefore, the trustee says, the bankrupt\u2019s claims against the four debtors came into his possession as an officer of the bankruptcy court and that if the United States should prevail in its action and recover the claims he will be adversely affected in his official capacity because it will be impossible for him to distribute the proceeds of the claims in accordance with statutory priorities.</p>\n<p id=\"b916-11\">The decisive issue is a narrow one. It is whether the government, by simply serving the notices of levy authorized by \u00a7 6331 of Title 26 U.S.C. upon debtors of a bankrupt, reduces its claims against the debtors to \u201cpossession\u201d thereby preventing the trustee in bankruptcy from subordinating the government\u2019s claims against the debtors to the payment of the expenses of administering the bankrupt's estate and claims against the bankrupt for wages.</p>\n<p id=\"b916-12\">The trustee, in support of his contention that mere notice of levy is not enough but that in addition thereto a \u201cwarrant of distraint\u201d must also be served upon a debtor in order to reduce <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"845\">*845</page-number>the government\u2019s claim against the debt- or to \u201cpossession,\u201d relies primarily upon two cases decided under \u00a7 3692 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1939, 26 U.S.C. \u00a7 3692, United States v. O\u2019Dell, 160 F.2d 304 (C.A. 6, 1947), and Givan v. Cripe, 187 F.2d 225 (C.A.7, 1951). These cases, however, do not stand unquestioned. The late Chief Judge Parker, writing for his court in United States v. Eiland, supra at 121, disagreed with the O\u2019Dell and Givan cases relied upon, by the trustee and in a carefully reasoned opinion held that it was not necessary to serve a \u201cwarrant of distraint\u201d upon a debtor in order to reduce the government\u2019s claim to \u201cpossession;\u201d that under the 1939 Code notice of levy alone was enough to accomplish that end. Moreover, all of these cases were decided under the Internal Revenue Code of 1939 and split upon the meaning to be given to a specific reference to a \u201cwarrant\u201d in its \u00a7 3692 which we quote in material part in the margin,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> whereas in the comparable provision of the Internal Revenue Code of 1954, with which we are here concerned, there is no reference whatever to a \u201cwarrant.\u201d Indeed, \u00a7 6331 \u25a0(b) of the current code specifically provides under the subtitle \u201cSeizure and sale \u25a0of property\u201d that: \u201cThe term \u2018levy\u2019 as \u25a0used in this title includes the power of distraint and seizure by any means.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b917-6\">It seems clear to us that in the 1954 Code Congress resolved the problem under the 1939 Code which split the courts in the cases relied upon by the trustee \u25a0and the court in the Eiland case. In .short we agree with the rationale of Judge Foley in the recent case of United States v. Manufacturers National Bank, 198 F.Supp. 157 (N.D.N.Y.1961), the only case in point under the 1954 Code that we have found, and with his conclusion that the omission of any mention in \u00a7 \u25a06331 of the present code, or in the regulations, of any form of warrant establishes that the effectiveness of federal tax liens does not depend upon service of a warrant of distraint, Our conclusion therefore is that the \u201cnature\u201d or \u201ccharacter\u201d of the trustee\u2019s claim is such that he does not have an absolute right to intervene.</p>\n<p id=\"b917-11\">On the authority of Brotherhood of Railroad Trainmen v. Baltimore and Ohio Railroad Company, cited at the beginning of this opinion:</p>\n<p id=\"b917-12\">An order will be entered dismissing the appeal for lack of appellate jurisdiction.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b916-8\">.
