The other defendant, Broomall, is charged with responsibility on the theory that he did not stop or park his car in accordance with the pertinent Pennsylvania statutory provisions and that this failure contributed to the accident which resulted in the child\u2019s death. The trial judge directed a verdict in favor of the defendant Broomall; the jury returned a verdict in favor of the defendant Pollon. The trial judge not only charged the jury in detail but wrote a memorandum discussing the points in the case and denying the motion for a new trial. There was no error.</p>\n<p id=\"b835-34\">The judgment of the district court will be affirmed, 198 F.Supp. 301.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
