Although the order is effective until modified, the Board directed that the proceedings remain open to enable it \u201cto re-examine the situation at Baltimore at the end of one year\u201d and to make \u201cany necessary modifications which may then be indicated.\u201d The order also provided that \u201cif after a reasonable period of good faith compliance * * * [petitioner] should conclude that actual experience demonstrates that further provision of the service ordered is not justified, it can make appropriate application to the Board for relief.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b785-6\">National brought this petition for review attacking the Board\u2019s determinations respecting (1) inadequacy of existing service, (2) economic feasibility of the service ordered, and (3) the requirement that the additional flights make no more than two intermediate stops between Baltimore and the Florida cities.</p>\n<p id=\"b785-7\">(1) During these proceedings, the Board adopted a rough standard to test the adequacy of service at Baltimore. That test was whether through flights were provided to and from each city with which Baltimore exchanged or will exchange ten passengers per day. National contends that this \u201cten-a-day\u201d standard is not supported by substantial evidence. It was first suggested at the hearing by an expert witness for the Greater Baltimore Committee who testified that airlines should provide through service in markets exchanging ten passengers per day. In its brief, the Bureau of Air Operations urged this test of adequacy upon the trial examiner. He adopted it and sought to support it by a study, based upon data in the record, which showed that two thirds of a sample of city pairs served by through-planes exchanged ten or fewer passengers per day. The Board approved the examiner\u2019s decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b785-14\">Whether the examiner\u2019s study was adequate to support the \u201cten-a-day\u201d standard appears immaterial in the present posture of the case.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> In response to the carrier\u2019s petition for reconsideration, the Board studied the service provided in 1270 markets exchanging various \u201cgraduated volumes of traffic covering the complete range between 5 and 15 passengers daily.\u201d We think that study adequately supported the \u201cten-a-day\u201d standard. But it appeared for the first time in the Board\u2019s supplemental order denying reconsideration.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b785-15\">The question arises whether the Board may invoke this study upon reconsideration as evidence to support the standard applied earlier in the proceeding.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> The Board\u2019s supplementary study <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"714\">*714</page-number>was based upon standard origin and destination surveys and airline schedules which had been stipulated into the record.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Its finding that through-plane service is provided in more than half the markets exchanging ten passengers per day is no more than a statistical inference from that data. National did not object to that inference in its motion for stay following the denial of its petition for reconsideration. Nor does it argue here that it was prejudiced by a lack of opportunity to demonstrate error in the Board\u2019s reasoning. Indeed, it asserts none. Moreover, National had ample opportunity both by exception to the trial examiner\u2019s report and on petition for rehearing to proffer evidence and to argue against the \u201cten-a-day\u201d standard, and to propose an alternative test. Under these circumstances, we think the Board\u2019s supplementary study is sufficient to support the standard of adequacy it adopted.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b786-4\">(2) National\u2019s next contention is that the record does not show that additional service to Miami, Jacksonville and Tampa/St. Petersburg would be economically feasible. The parties agree that \u201cmanifestly, the economic feasibility of additional or improved service sought under section 404(a) is a relevant and material consideration.\u201d National presented evidence which tended to show that additional service in these markets would be \u201cseriously unprofitable.\u201d That evidence consisted of a record of load factors experienced on the Baltimore-Miami segment of an experimental non-stop Baltimore-Miami service originating in Newark which National offered during the 1956-57 peak traffic winter season.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> The Board found this evidence \u201cunpersuasive.\u201d It therefore held that National had failed to meet the burden of proof on the issue of economic feasibility which, the Board says, rests upon the carriers. National asserts that it does not have the burden of proof and that, if it does, it has sustained it.</p>\n<p id=\"b786-11\">The issues embedded in this assertion are of great importance to both the airlines and the public. Careful consideration of economic feasibility is essential to avoid serious losses to the carriers.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> On <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"715\">*715</page-number>the other hand, cities petitioning for adequate service and the Board would be unduly hampered by any requirement for overly detailed profit and loss projections to establish the economic feasibility of adequate service. This could not only intolerably protract adequacy of service proceedings,<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> but might also create an insuperable barrier to petitioning civic groups lacking both the relevant operating data and the assistance of experts.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b787-5\">We think the Board\u2019s practice of keeping adequacy proceedings open to permit either party to attack the remedial order after a trial period and of reviewing its determinations after one year is sound.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> Where an order of that kind is issued after the Board has established a need for additional service, we think it need not affirmatively find economic feasibility but may properly place the burden of producing evidence of infeasibility upon the carriers.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> We turn, therefore, to the question whether National sustained that burden.</p>\n<p id=\"b787-6\">On its face, National\u2019s evidence would appear substantial on the question whether additional service to Florida would be economically feasible, since it shows that when such service was instituted during the peak winter season, it proved unprofitable. National argues that the Board\u2019s own figures show that Miami is Baltimore\u2019s largest market and that <em>a fortiori </em>additional service to Jacksonville and Tampa/St. Petersburg would be economically infeasible.</p>\n<p id=\"b787-12\">But the Board rejected this data because the drawing power of the additional flight was inevitably reduced by the poor over-all pattern of service at Baltimore and the consequent diversion of traffic to Washington, and because a substantial net increase in Miami traffic accompanied National\u2019s experimental flight.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> We think these facts lessen the predictive value of National\u2019s experience to such an extent that they preclude us from disturbing the Board\u2019s conclusion that the experience was not probative evidence of economic infeasibility. We do not decide whether National\u2019s burden required it to produce detailed cost and revenue projections showing that additional service could only be provided at a loss.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> Nor need we consider, as the Board urges in its brief, whether National\u2019s burden also <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"716\">*716</page-number>required it to show that such service would have a seriously deleterious effect on its system-wide earnings.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b788-4\">(3) National\u2019s final assignment of error is that there is no basis in the record for the Board\u2019s requirement that the additional flights ordered make no more than two intermediate stops. Its argument is that the Board adduced no evidence that three or more intermediate stops rendered through-plane service inadequate. We think it was not required to do so.</p>\n<p id=\"b788-5\">Service at Baltimore was inadequate, <em>inter alia, </em>because many passengers had to change planes en route, thus increasing their travel time. This inadequacy could not be remedied unless, in addition to ordering single-plane service, the Board limited the number of intermediate stops, since those stops could cause as much delay as plane changes and thereby deprive Baltimore of the benefit of the Board\u2019s remedial order. In fashioning its remedy, the Board has wide discretion and is entitled to rely upon its cumulative experience as well as the record before it. See National Labor Relations Board v. Seven-Up Bottling Co., 344 U.S. 344, 349, 73 S.Ct. 287, 97 L.Ed. 377 (1953); Jacob Siegel Co. v. Federal Trade Comm., 327 U.S. 608, 611-613, 66 S.Ct. 758, 90 L.Ed. 888 (1956) (dictum). The Board noted that \u201cwith the telescoping of flight time associated with the growing use of modern equipment, the time required for stops represents an increasingly higher proportion of the total flight time than heretofore.\u201d It therefore concluded that the additional flights it ordered would be adequate only if intermediate stops were limited to two. We think this judgment, based upon the Board\u2019s experience, falls within the zone of reasonableness and may not be disturbed.</p>\n<p id=\"b788-6\">So ordered.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b785-8\">.

Underlying that study was the assumption that service requiring a change of planes between Baltimore and a city with which it exchanges a given number of passengers would be inadequate if other city pairs exchanging a like number of passengers <em>ordinarily </em>received through-plane service. To show the traffic level at which single-plane service is ordinarily available, the examiner studied the traffic flow between city pairs receiving such service. We note that the sample contained no cities connected by flights requiring a change of planes, and thus predetermined the conclusion that cities exchanging ten passengers per day ordinarily receive through-plane service.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b785-17\">.

This breakdown was intended to meet the carrier\u2019s contention that distance is an important consideration when determining whether through flights are required. The figures show that through service is available in a majority of the markets comparable in traffic flow and distance to Baltimore-Miami and Baltimore-Jacksonville. Only 43.5 percent of the markets comparable to Baltimore-Tampa/St. Petersburg receive such service, however. But the Board found that through-plane service would be provided in such a market if one terminal were a resort, as is Tampa, and the other a major city, as is Baltimore. We think this adjustment of the figures in the study justified by the Board\u2019s expertise. Of. Southeastern Aviation, Inc. v.

Petitioner argues that Administrative Procedure Act, \u00a7 7(c), 60 Stat. 241 (1946), 5 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 1006(c), which places the burden of proof upon the proponent of an order, prohibits the Board from placing the burden of proving economic infeasibility upon the carriers. We think that once the Board has established that existing service is inadequate to meet the needs of a community, it has discharged its burden of proof. Economic infeasibility is more like an affirmative defense than an element of the Board\u2019s case. Accordingly we think that the Board properly placed the burden of producing evidence of economic infeasibility upon petitioner. See Specht v.
