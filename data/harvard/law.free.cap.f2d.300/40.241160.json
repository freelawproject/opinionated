Gunzburg. Frellsen v. Johannessen, 5 Cir., 1961, 289 F.2d 925; Gunzburg v. United States, 5 Cir., 1962, 297 F.2d 829 [No. 18727, January 12, 1962], Presented here is the Bankrupt\u2019s contention that the District Court erred in approving the Referee\u2019s denial of discharge. After a lengthy hearing on a record which is here over 1,000 pages long, the Referee denied discharge for the failure of the Bankrupt (1) \u201c * * * to keep or preserve books of account or records, from which his financial condition and business transactions might be ascertained * * * \u201d and (2) \u201c * * * to explain satisfactorily * * * losses of assets or deficiency of assets to meet his liabilities * * \u00a7 14, sub. c(2) (7), 11 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 32, sub. c(2) (7).</p>\n<p id=\"b112-23\">To the extent that these conclusions rested on findings of fact, they have almost a triple insulation. First, there being overwhelming evidence showing the existence of \u201c * * * reasonable grounds for believing that the bankrupt has committed * * * \u201d the two actions specified above, the Bankruptcy Act turns the table by providing that upon such a showing <em>\u201c </em>* * * then the burden of proving that he has not committed any of such acts shall be upon the bankrupt.\u201d \u00a7 14, sub. c, 11 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 32, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"41\">*41</page-number>sub. c. This is more than the burden of going forward with the evidence. For \u201c * * * the bankrupt now has the risk of ultimately persuading the Court that the allegations in the specifications are untrue. If the evidence is in a state of substantial equilibrium, the discharge must be denied since the bankrupt has failed to carry his burden of proof.\u201d 1 Collier, Bankruptcy \u00a7 14.12, at 1292-93 (footnotes omitted). In a figure mdigenous to a financial foundering, \u201c * * * once a prima facie case appears, the laboring oar passes to his hands and he must bring the boat to shore.\u201d Federal Provision Co. v. Ershowsky, 2 Cir., 1938, 94 F.2d 574, 575. Second, the terms of General Order 47 are explicit. The Referee is ordinarily to make, as he did here, \u201chis findings of fact and conclusions of law.\u201d And when so done, \u201cthe judge shall accept his findings of fact unless clearly erroneous,\u201d General Order 47, 11 U.S.C.A, following section 53. 2 Collier, Bankruptcy \u00a7 39.-16, at 1473. Third, we review the action of the District Judge whose affirmance of the Referee\u2019s order brings into play for application to this stage of the judicial proceeding principles akin to the \u201cclearly erroneous\u201d concept. Cf. United States v. Twin Cities Power Company of Georgia, 5 Cir., 1958, 253 F.2d 197.</p>\n<p id=\"AQ\">There was evidence which amply warranted the Referee\u2019s finding that the Bankrupt had not satisfactorily overcome the piima facie showing. Indeed, there was quite enough to ^ warrant the Referee s affirmative finding that the books and records were inadequate in serious and substantial respects, and that the Bankrupt had failed to explain satisfactorily the diminution in assets exceeding $100,000. It is equally clear that as to the sufficiency of the books the Referee evaluated the facts in the light of the proper legal standards. See In re Under-hill, 2 Cir., 1936, 82 F.2d 258; Nix v. Sternberg, 8 Cir., 1930, 38 F.2d 611; International Shoe Co. v. Lewine, 5 Cir., 1934, 68 F.2d 517; In Re Marx, 7 Cir., 1942, 125 F.2d 335; In Re Leichter, 3 Cir., 1952,197 F.2d 955; Hedges v. Bushnell, 10 Cir., 1939, 106 F.2d 979. So it was also as to loss of assets. In Re Shapiro &amp; Ornish, N.D.Tex.1929, 37 F.2d 403, affirmed 5 Cir., 37 F.2d 407. 1 Collier, Bankruptcy \u00a7 14.59, at 1401.</p>\n<p id=\"AZR\">Affirmed</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
