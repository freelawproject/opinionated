The plaintiff contends that he has alleged three causes \u2014 for unfair competition, for invasion of privacy and for defamation. According to the complaint the plaintiff is a professional entertainer who has achieved stardom \u2014 with commensurate financial success \u2014 on the legitimate stage, in motion pictures, on radio, television and other entertainment media throughout the United States, Canada and elsewhere. This he has done in substantial measure because his \u201cstyle of vocal comic delivery which, by reason of its distinctive and original combination of pitch, inflection, accent and comic sounds,\u201d has caused him to become \u201cwidely known and readily recognized * * * as a unique and extraordinary comic character.\u201d The complaint alleges that the defendant Adell Chemical Company, in advertising its product \u201cLestoil\u201d on television, used as a commercial a cartoon film of a duck and, without the plaintiff\u2019s consent, \u201cas the voice of the aforesaid duck, an actor who specialized in imitating the vocal sounds of the plaintiff.\u201d It is further alleged that the \u201cvast public television audience and the entertainment industry\u201d throughout the United States, Canada and elsewhere believed that the words spoken and the comic sounds made by the cartoon duck were supplied and made by the plaintiff. It is alleged that this was a misappropriation of the plaintiff\u2019s \u201ccreative talent, voice, vocal sounds and vocal comic delivery\u201d and a \u201ctrading <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"258\">*258</page-number>upon his fame and renown.\u201d In addition, it injured plaintiff\u2019s reputation in the entertainment field, both because it cheapened plaintiff to indicate that he was reduced to giving anonymous television commercials and because the imitation, although recognizable, was inferior in quality and suggested that his abilities had deteriorated.</p>\n<p id=\"b330-4\">Although plaintiff asserts the \u201cvoice of the aforesaid duck,\u201d alias perhaps mockingbird, was heard throughout the land, with possibly varying legal consequences, the law he cites is on no such scale. Upon our pressing, he agreed that we need consider no law except that of Massachusetts and New York. We will interpret this concession as meaning not that plaintiff does not claim injury in other states, but that for present purposes we may assume the law of those states to be in accord with one or both of the two jurisdictions specified.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b330-5\">We deal first with the right of privacy. The Massachusetts court has avoided recognizing such a right. Kelley v. Post Publishing Co., 1951, 327 Mass. 275, 98 N.E.2d 286; Themo v. New England Newspaper Pub. Co., 1940, 306 Mass. 54, 27 N.E.2d 753. Plaintiff alleges nothing on this score which tempts us to depart from that practice. To the extent that the complaint states anything of substantial moment, it should fall within the claims for unfair competition and defamation. We see no profit in exploring this alternative and, if anything, thornier path. Cf. Prosser, Privacy, 48 Cal.L.Rev. 383,401 (1960).</p>\n<p id=\"b330-6\">Any rights resulting from the special New York statute, sometimes ealled the right of privacy statute, flow from the use, for commercial purposes, of a party\u2019s \u201cname, portrait or picture.\u201d New York Civil Rights Law, McKinney\u2019s Con-sol.Laws, c. 6 \u00a7\u00a7 50 and 51. Plaintiff's claim here, at best, is that though the picture was that of a duck, the voice was the \u201cname,\u201d which he enlarges to \u201cidentity,\u201d of the plaintiff. The statute is very specific. If the legislature intended that whenever an anonymous speaker extolled a commercial product a cause of action arose (and criminal penalties could be imposed) if anyone could claim the voice was mistaken as his, it should have used a phrase of more general import. In the absence of any New York authority, \u201cname\u201d can be given no such catholic connotation.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b330-11\">With respect to the claim for defamation, we are not faced with the problem of whether defendant\u2019s conduct in broadcasting a tape-recording is to be considered libel or slander. Since the injury alleged was to plaintiff\u2019s professional reputation, it makes no difference. Lynch v. Lyons, 1939, 303 Mass. 116, 20 N.E.2d 953; Lovejoy v. Whitcomb, 1899, 174 Mass. 586, 55 N.E. 322; Nichols v. Item Publishers, Inc., 1956, 309 N.Y. 596, 132 N.E.2d 860; Rager v. McCloskey, 1953, 305 N.Y. 75, 111 N.E.2d 214. A charge that an entertainer has stooped to perform below his class may be found to damage his reputation. Louka v. Park Entertainments, Inc., 1936, 294 Mass. 268, 1 N.E .2d 41; Sim v. H. J. Heinz Co., Ltd., (C.A.) [1959] 1 W.L.R. 313, semble.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Plaintiff\u2019s allegations in this respect are not insufficient. Whether audible identification was enough in a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"259\">*259</page-number>field where imitation is easy, and perhaps properly suspect, is a matter we do not wish to decide upon the bare allegations of a complaint. But it has never been held in defamation that a plaintiff must be identified by name. Louka v. Park Entertainments, Inc., supra; Robinson v. Coulter, 1913, 215 Mass. 566, 102 N.E. 938; Kern v. News Syndicate Co., 1958, 6 A.D.2d 404, 178 N.Y.S.2d 274.</p>\n<p id=\"b331-5\">Plaintiff\u2019s additional assertion that an inferior imitation damaged his reputation raises a more doubtful question. Even entertainers who make no claim to uniqueness have distinctive vocal characteristics and may be thought to be recognized. If every time one can allege, \u201cYour (anonymous) commercial sounded like me, but not so good,\u201d and contend the public believed, in spite of the variance, that it was he, and at the same time believed, because of the variance, that his abilities had declined, the consequences would be too great to contemplate. Occasional disparagement of public entertainers is the commonly accepted lot. Furthermore, there is no absolute test of excellence in dramatic performance. If what was attributed to the plaintiff was so manifestly inferior as to constitute actionable defamation, see, e. g., Ben-Oliel v. Press Pub. Co., 1929, 251 N.Y. 250, 167 N.E. 432, we hold he must be able to point to some identification with himself more specific than the remaining similarities. We know of no case which gives a plaintiff such liberty to put a cap on and at the same time say it does not fit.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b331-6\">In the light of the foregoing it is not strictly necessary to consider on what further grounds the complaint can be supported, but since the question of unfair competition must inevitably arise we will discuss it briefly. The defendant obscures the issue by arguing at length that imitation is not unfair competition. This may indeed be true, if there is no confusion of source. Cf. Chappell &amp; Co. v. Fields, 2 Cir., 1914, 210 F. 864; Cheney Bros. v. Doris Silk Corp., 2 Cir., 1929, 35 F.2d 279, cert. den. 281 U.S. 728, 50 S.Ct. 245, 74 L.Ed. 1145. But plaintiff here is not complaining of imitation in the sense of simply copying his material or his ideas, but of causing a mistake in identity. Such passing off is the basic offense. True, it was not defendant\u2019s product that was offered in competition, but that of the anonymous imposter whom defendant, for its benefit, subsidized. This is a distinction without a difference. Plaintiff\u2019s complaint is that defendant is \u201cstealing his thunder\u201d in the direct sense; that defendant\u2019s commercial had greater value because its audience believed it was listening to him. In the light of plaintiff\u2019s allegations we could not say there was no such enhancement.</p>\n<p id=\"b331-13\">Furthermore, we can hardly agree with defendant that \u201cthere is no competitive interest or purpose served * * * and no real confusion of product which would lead to the appellant\u2019s loss of opportunity in the entertainment field.\u201d It could well be found that defendant\u2019s conduct saturated plaintiff\u2019s audience to the point of curtailing his market. No performer has an unlimited demand. We may agree with defendant that plaintiff has not shown any \u201cproperty\u201d interest entitled to copyright protection. And we might hesitate to say that an ordinary singer whose voice, deliberately or otherwise, sounded sufficiently like another to cause confusion was not free to do so. Plaintiff here alleges a peculiar style and type of performance, unique in a far broader sense. Before going further into this matter, and the possible relevancy and scope of secondary meanings, we think plaintiff\u2019s adjectival allegations should be tested in the crucible. Cf. Chaplin v. Amador, 1928, 93 Cal.App. 358, 269 P. 544.</p>\n<p id=\"b331-14\"> So far we have been talking about the defendant Adell Chemical Co. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"260\">*260</page-number>(and, in effect, another corporation similarly charged). Plaintiff also claims that defendant Barowsky, a principal stockholder and an officer of Adell, was personally liable. The complaint alleges that the tortious acts were committed by the corporate defendant, its \u201cofficers, servants, agents, affiliates and employees.\u201d We agree with Barowsky that simply identifying him as \u201can officer\u201d does not adequately allege his personal involvement. But a corporate officer is liable for torts in which he personally participated, whether or not he was acting within the scope of his authority. Marks v. Polaroid Corp., 1 Cir., 1956, 237 F.2d 428; National Cash-Register Co. v. Leland, 1 Cir., 1899, 94 F. 502. After remand the district court may, in its discretion, consider a motion to amend the complaint to make the allegations more specific as to Barowsky in this respect if the plaintiff so wishes. However, we cannot agree with the plaintiff that since Adell is dissolved, and Barowsky is an alleged recipient of its assets in distribution, his secondary liability, if any, as a distributee, Burke v. Marlboro Awning Co., 1953, 330 Mass. 294,113 N.E.2d 222, can be enforced in a primary action. Mass.G.L. c. 156, \u00a7 38; see Priest v. Essex Hat Mfg. Co., 1874, 115 Mass. 380; Cambridge Water Works v. Somerville Dyeing &amp; Bleaching Co., 1862, 4 Allen 239, 86 Mass. 239. See also 13A Fletcher Cyclopedia Corporations ch. 58, \u00a7\u00a7 6320, 6322 (1961 revision).</p>\n<p id=\"b332-4\">A word about the statute of limitations. The complaint alleges that the offending activities occurred \u201csince the beginning of December 1958.\u201d In Massachusetts the ordinary tort period of limitations is two years; for libel it is one year. Mass.G.L. c. 260, \u00a7\u00a7 2A, 4. The action was not commenced until January 1961. It does not appear for how long a period the duck trespassed on plaintiff\u2019s reputation. Defendant, relying on the single publication rule, asserts that plaintiff\u2019s rights became barred by December 1960. This rule is normally applicable to continued sales and new editions of a single literary work. See, e. g., Dale System, Inc. v. Time, Inc., D.C.Conn., 1953, 116 F.Supp. 527; Uniform Single Publication Act (1952). Cf. Riley v. Dun &amp; Bradstreet, 6 Cir., 1959, 172 F.2d 303. The statute of limitations is an affirmative defense. Whether the single publication rule should be applied to the circumstances of this case had best be decided when we know what they were. A fortiori, we will decide nothing about laches in respect to unfair competition. Cf. Seaboard Finance Co. v. Martin, 5 Cir., 1957, 244 F.2d 329.</p>\n<p id=\"b332-6\">Judgment will be entered vacating the judgment of the District Court and remanding the case to that court for further proceedings not inconsistent herewith.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b330-7\">. We will not, on the other hand, adopt defendant\u2019s singular theory that Massachusets, as the court of the forum, would not look beyond its own law with respect to unfair competition (which defendant construes with great strictness in its favor) and, on the other hand, would look only to the law of New Xork, as the state of plaintiff\u2019s domicile, for defamation.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b330-8\">. Plaintiff quotes the phrase \u201cword painting\u201d from Levey v. Warner Bros. Pictures, Inc., D.C.S.D.N.Y., 1944, 57 F. <em>Supp. 40, 42. </em>We think the quotation fails to take into account the next sentence. In any event, it is dictum not followed in any state decision.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b330-14\">. Sim was an application for a preliminary injunction. The facts were remarkably like those at bar. In refusing the interlocutory order the court did not suggest that plaintiff had not stated a valid cause of action. For an able discussion of that case, see Mathieson, Comment, 1961, 39 Can.B.Rev. 409.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b331-7\">. We do not accept the dictum favorable to the plaintiff on this point in Gardella v. Log Cabin Products Co., 2 Cir., 1937, 89 F.2d 891, 896. While there may theoretically be a twilight zone where identification and defamation overlap, we think our present decision goes far enough.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
