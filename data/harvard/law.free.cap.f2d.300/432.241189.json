Eden appealed, and thereafter moved for an order staying the condemnation proceedings and granting other relief pending disposition of the appeal by this court.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> At the argument on this motion both Eden and the United States urged us to take the appeal under submission on the merits as well as on the motion for a stay pending disposition of the appeal. This was done.</p>\n<p id=\"b505-18\">The land in question is part of a cemetery owned and operated by Eden. It is being condemned for use as a part of the \u201cInterstate System\u201d of highways referred to in the Federal-Aid Highways Act of August 27, 1958, 72 Stat. 885, 23 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 101, et seq.</p>\n<p id=\"b505-19\">On November 1, 1960, the Department of Public Works of the State of California commenced a condemnation proceeding in the Superior Court of the State of California in and for the County of Los Angeles, for the purpose of acquiring this land for the highway purposes described above. An <em>ex parte </em>order for possession was entered by that court. Subsequently, Eden moved in that proceeding to vacate the order of possession, contending that construction of a highway on this cemetery land was barred by sections 8560 and 8560.5 of the Health and Safety Code of California.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b506-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"434\">*434</page-number>This motion was denied by the Superior Court, whereupon Eden appealed to the State District Court of Appeal of the Second Appellate District. On February 24, 1961, that court issued an order annulling the order of possession theretofore entered by the state trial court and prohibiting further state court proceedings with respect to the condemnation of the cemetery land. The court held that sections 8560 and 8560.5 of the California Health and Safety Code prevented the state from condemning or establishing roads across cemetery property. Eden Memorial Park Ass\u2019n v. Superior Court, 189 Cal.App.2d 421, 11 Cal.Rptr. 189. The California Supreme Court thereafter denied the Department\u2019s petition to review the decision of the District Court of Appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b506-4\">Following this decision, J. C. Womack, State Highway Engineer of the State of California, requested the Secretary of Commerce of the United States to condemn this land. Womack thus sought to invoke a provision of the Federal-Aid Highways Act which authorizes the United States to acquire land by condemnation under certain circumstances, for the purpose of conveying it to a state which would construct and maintain a state highway thereon. See 23 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 107.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b506-10\">Responsive to Womack\u2019s request, the United States on April 27, 1961, commenced the instant condemnation proceeding. Concurrently therewith it filed a declaration of taking and a notice of motion for an order for immediate possession.</p>\n<p id=\"b506-11\">On May 5, 1961, Eden and Sol Rosenberg, filed a complaint for injunction in the Superior Court of the State of California in and for the County of Los Angeles. The ease was docketed as No. 770431. Rosenberg is an officer of Eden, but he joined in the action in his capacity as a citizen, resident and taxpayer of the State of California. Named as defendants in this action were the Department of Public Works of the State of California, the director of that department, the State Highway Engineer (Womack), the California Highway Commission, and various other state officers and employees.</p>\n<p id=\"b506-12\">In this state action plaintiffs sought to enjoin the defendants therein from entering upon or taking possession of the cemetery land involved in the federal con<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"435\">*435</page-number>demnation proceedings or constructing thereon a public highway. They also sought to enjoin those defendants from authorizing contractors to enter upon the land for construction purposes, expending state funds for the purpose of acquiring the land or constructing a highway thereon, entering into contracts purporting to obligate the state to expend state funds for such purposes, and paying to the United States or any official thereof or any person state funds in connection with such purposes.</p>\n<p id=\"b507-5\">In their complaint in this state action plaintiffs alleged the facts concerning the prior state action in which the condemnation proceedings instituted by the Department of Public Works were brought to a halt because of the provisions of sections 8560 and 8560.5. They further alleged that notwithstanding the judgment entered in the prior suit and in disregard of California state policy evidenced by sections 8560 and 8560.5, the state agencies and officials named in the new state suit threaten to take possession of the identical land and to lay out and construct a highway thereon. The plaintiffs in the state action also alleged that the named state agencies and officials intend to enter into contracts and expend state funds for the stated purpose.</p>\n<p id=\"b507-6\">Allegations were made concerning the request which Womack had made for federal condemnation, it being asserted that he was not authorized to make such a request on behalf of the state. It was also averred that it is the intention of the Federal Highway Administrator and the Secretary of Commerce upon acquiring the land in a federal proceeding to transfer title therein to the state or to permit the Department of Public Works to take immediate possession and to commence construction of a state highway thereon. Any such acts by state agencies and officials, it was alleged, would be illegal, unauthorized, arbitrary and in violation of the laws of the state. The threat of irreparable injury and the inadequacy of any remedy at law were also averred.</p>\n<p id=\"b507-8\">On May 12, 1961, Eden filed its verified answer to the complaint in the federal condemnation proceeding. Two defenses were therein asserted, the first being that the complaint in condemnation fails to set forth facts showing that there had been a compliance with alleged statutory conditions precedent to the bringing of such a suit, as prescribed in section 107 of the Federal-Aid Highways Act. According to the answer, these conditions precedent are that (1) the state request the Secretary of Commerce to acquire the lands; (2) the Secretary determine that either the state is unable to acquire the lands or is unable to acquire them with sufficient promptness; and (3) the Secretary determine that the state has agreed with the Secretary to pay a stated percentage of the cost of acquiring the land.</p>\n<p id=\"b507-9\">Eden\u2019s second defense raised the following specific objections: (1) the United States is not authorized by law to take or attempt to take the subject land; (2) the Federal Highway Administrator is not authorized by law to take, or attempt to take the land; (3) the state has not requested that the United States acquire the land, this being a statutory condition precedent to the instituting of a section 107 condemnation proceeding; and (4) the State Highway Engineer was not authorized to make such a request on behalf of the state and the purported request made by him was illegal, ultra vires, arbitrary, in violation of the public policy of the state, and contrary to express state statutory prohibitions.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b507-10\">Concurrently with the filing of its answer Eden filed its response and objection to the Government\u2019s motion for an order of immediate possession together with a motion to vacate and set aside the declaration of taking. In the alternative Eden asked that the district court stay the issuance of an order for immediate possession and stay all other proceedings in the district court until there was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"436\">*436</page-number>a determination by the state court of the issues of law there involved. On May 15, 1961, the district court granted the order of immediate possession and denied Eden\u2019s motion to vacate the declaration of taking and to stay the federal proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b508-4\">In the concurrent state court proceeding the superior court on May 16, 1961, denied plaintiff\u2019s application for a preliminary injunction. However, the court ordered that, pending an appeal from the denial and subject to modification by the court, the defendants would be restrained from building or constructing any permanent structure of any kind or any permanent highway upon the land in question. The order specifically permitted the defendants to construct temporary facilities.</p>\n<p id=\"b508-5\">On May 19, 1961, the Government filed in the condemnation action a petition for a preliminary injunction and for an adjudication in contempt. The facts concerning the federal condemnation proceeding, the plan to have the highway constructed by the state, and the newly instituted state court proceeding were recited therein. It was alleged that Eden instituted the state suit wilfully and with the purpose and intent of circumventing the effect of the declaration of taking and the orders of the court in the federal condemnation proceeding.</p>\n<p id=\"b508-6\">It was further alleged that the state action was commenced for the purpose of hindering, interfering with, and preventing the work of placing the necessary improvements upon the land in question. The Government also averred that although the United States is the real party in interest in the state proceeding because of its ownership of the property involved and by reason of its agreement to provide funds for the highway program, it has no way of participating in the state suit.</p>\n<p id=\"b508-10\">Irreparable damage by reason of the pendency of the state action was alleged. The relief sought was an injunction against Eden and its attorneys restraining them from the prosecution of the state action or the instituting of any other state action, an order requiring Eden to obtain the vacation of the state court restraining order then in effect, and an order adjudging Eden and its attorneys to be in contempt.</p>\n<p id=\"b508-11\">At the hearing on this petition, held on May 25, 1961, the district court orally ordered the restraining order issued by the state court to be vacated by 5:00 P.M. of that day. On May 31, 1961, the district court entered findings of fact and an order, the latter containing the following provisions: (1) directing Eden to forthwith move in the concurrent state court proceedings to set aside the temporary restraining order then in effect,<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> and (2) restraining Eden from applying to a state court for any further injunctions or restraining orders affecting the property in question.</p>\n<p id=\"b508-12\">It is from this order of May 31, 1961, that Eden appeals to this court. It is in connection with that appeal that Eden has moved for a stay. The relief specifically sought in this motion is as follows: (1) a stay of all proceedings in the federal condemnation action pending disposition of the appeal, (2) suspension, pending determination of the appeal, of the order for immediate possession issued on May 15, 1961, (3) suspension of the order of injunction issued on May 31, 1961, and (4) any other relief deemed appropriate to preserve the <em>status quo </em>while this appeal is pending.</p>\n<p id=\"b508-13\">On October 5, 1961, this court entered its order staying certain provisions of the district court order under review pending disposition of this appeal, provided Eden file a supersedeas bond in an indicated amount.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b509-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"437\">*437</page-number>We now proceed to consider, on the merits, the appeal from the order con\u2022cerning which we have granted a partial stay.</p>\n<p id=\"b509-4\">Title 28 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 2283, providing that a court of the United States may not grant an injunction to stay proceedings in a state court \u201cexcept as expressly authorized by Act of Congress, or where necessary in aid of its jurisdiction, or to protect or effectuate its judgments,\u201d is inapplicable to stays sought by the United States. Leiter Minerals, Inc. v. United States, 352 U.S. 220, 226, 77 S.Ct. 287, 291, 1 L.Ed.2d 267.</p>\n<p id=\"b509-5\">But the question remains whether the granting of an injunction was proper in the circumstances of this case. It was proper if necessary to prevent impairment of any rights obtained, or to be obtained, by the United States in the \u2022condemnation proceeding. See United States v. Bank of New York &amp; Trust Co., :296 U.S. 463, 480-481, 56 S.Ct. 343, 80 L.Ed. 331; Leiter Minerals, Inc. v. United States, supra, at 226, 77 S.Ct. 287.</p>\n<p id=\"b509-6\">Two factors, the court found, made it necessary to order Eden to obtain \u2022dissolution of the state court temporary restraining order and to enjoin further state injunction proceedings. The first \u2022of these was, in effect, that in the state action, Eden contests the ownership of the United States in the land despite the declaration of taking. The second was that, in the state action, Eden sought relief which would make ineffective the order of immediate possession, and which would interfere with the exercise of ownership of the United States in this land.</p>\n<p id=\"A7U\">The district court found that in the state action Eden asserted continued ownership of the land despite the declaration of taking.</p>\n<p id=\"b509-8\">Neither the United States nor any of its agencies or officials were made parties to the state action, nor was the land in question brought before the state court in anything approaching an <em>in rem </em>proceeding. Under these circumstances we do not perceive how any claim to ownership made by Eden in that state action could possibly affect the title acquired by the United States by its declaration of taking. Assuming that the outcome of that <em>in personam </em>state action to which the United States is not a party would be an adjudication that Eden continued to own the land, such a judgment would neither operate to divest the United States of its title nor have any effect by way of res judicata to impair such title.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b509-9\">In any event we do not agree with the district court\u2019s view that, in the state action, Eden contests the ownership of the United States. The only language contained in the complaint filed by Eden in the state court which tends to support this view is the two italicized words contained in the following allegation:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b509-10\">\u201c * * * the defendant Department * * * intends and threatens to take possession of, and to lay out and construct a public road * * *, through, over and across the subject land <em>of Eden </em>in violation of the aforesaid statutes. * * * \u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b509-11\">Eden asserts that the words \u201cof Eden\u201d were used inadvertently. Analysis of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"438\">*438</page-number>complaint indicates that this is true. The relief prayed for was directed solely against state agencies and officials who were not alleged to then have any control over the title to the land. No request was made for adjudication of title or to divest or in any manner adversely affect the title then resting in the United States. Moreover, the complaint contains other allegations expressly recognizing that title to the land had passed to the United States.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> In the argument before the district court, counsel for Eden assured the court that they recognized that title was in the United States subject to possible defeasance as a result of further federal court proceedings, and that no issue concerning title was being raised in the state court.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b510-4\">We conclude that the order staying proceedings to obtain a state court temporary restraining order or permanent injunction is not warranted on the ground that, in the state action, Eden contests the ownership of the United States in the land despite the declaration of taking.</p>\n<p id=\"b510-5\">The district court also held, in support of its stay order, that in the state action Eden sought relief which would make ineffective the order of immediate possession, and which would interfere with the exercise of ownership of the United States in this land.</p>\n<p id=\"b510-16\">The relief sought in the state court, to which reference is here made, is the enjoining of state officials from taking possession of the land in question, entering into contracts with road builders to construct highway facilities, and expending state money on the project.</p>\n<p id=\"b510-17\">In our view, none of this relief, if granted in the state action, interferes with any right to possess and use the land which the United States has gained or expects to gain as a result of the condemnation proceedings. If the United States has gained the right to have the state accept this property and construct and operate a highway thereon, it is not because of any rights acquired by the United States in these condemnation proceedings; rather, it is by virtue of the section 107(a) (2) agreement and possibly other agreements which the state has entered into with the United States.</p>\n<p id=\"b510-18\">The Government\u2019s view, advanced in the district court, and accepted by that court,<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> that in the performance of the acts and threatened acts, these state agencies and officials are agents of the United States, seems to us immaterial.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> Any agency relationship which may have come into existence is by virtue of section <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"439\">*439</page-number>107 agreements, and not because of any right acquired by the Government in the \u25a0condemnation proceeding itself.</p>\n<p id=\"b511-5\">Moreover, analysis of the Federal-Aid Highways Act indicates that while close \u2022cooperation between the United States .and the individual states was contemplated, the states or their agencies or officials were in no sense to become agents \u25a0of the United States in projects authorized by that act. The whole tenor \u2022of the act is that the United States stands ready to assist the states when, under \u2022stated conditions, the states seek such assistance. Section 107 agreements are intended to confirm this arrangement, but not to create a principal and agent relationship in either direction.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b511-6\">If, by reason of any judgment entered in the state action, the state is unable to fulfill its obligations under such contract or contracts, the United States, which is not a party to, and not bound by, the state adjudication, has its remedy in a separate court proceeding. But this \u25a0condemnation proceeding, in which the state is not even a party, is not the place to litigate any such contractual rights.</p>\n<p id=\"b511-7\">We therefore conclude that the order staying state court proceedings with respect to a temporary restraining order or permanent injunction is no more warranted by the second factor relied upon by the court than by the first factor discussed above.</p>\n<p id=\"b511-8\">Eden has asked us not only to decide this appeal on the merits \u2014 which we have done \u2014 but also to \u201cdecide the underlying question as to the validity of the condemnation proceeding. * * * \u201d In its brief the Government states: \u201cWe join with appellant in urging this Court to put an end to the entire controversy at the present time. * * * <em>\u201d</em></p>\n<p id=\"b511-9\"> In condemnation proceedings, appellate review as to the validity of the taking may ordinarily be had only upon an appeal from the final order or judgment disposing of the whole case. Rule 71A(e), Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, 28 U.S.C.A.; Catlin v. United States, 324 U.S. 229, 233, 65 S.Ct. 631, 89 L.Ed. 911. Where, however, such a proceeding is before us to review an interlocutory order, we may review the validity of the taking if that question is ripe for review and if such review is necessary to dispose of the interlocutory appeal. But here we have already determined, for independently sufficient reasons, that the interlocutory order staying and enjoining state proceedings must be reversed.</p>\n<p id=\"b511-11\">It is true that a present review as to the validity of the taking might expedite termination of the entire controversy in both its state and federal aspects. This would happen, however, only if such review resulted in an adjudication that the taking was invalid, or that it was valid and, by its own force, required the state to accept the land and construct a highway thereon. We have already held that the latter question cannot be determined in this condemnation proceeding.</p>\n<p id=\"b511-12\">In our opinion the prospect of expediting the disposition of litigation is not a sufficient end in itself to warrant advance consideration of issues which are normally reserved for disposition on final appeal. In this case, moreover, there are other considerations which argue against the unnecessary advance review of the question of validity.</p>\n<p id=\"b511-13\">Under the Federal-Aid Highways Act, which provides the statutory authority for this taking, the only purpose for which the land may be acquired is to transfer it to the state so that the state can construct and maintain a highway thereon. If, by reason of the decision in the pending state case a cloud is thrown over the authority and obligation of the state to accept such a transfer and so utilize the land, the United States may desire to know it before the taking be<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"440\">*440</page-number>comes irrevocable, assuming that it has not already become so.</p>\n<p id=\"b512-4\">Apart from the possible desire of the United States in this regard, the district court might itself desire to re-examine its determination as to validity in the light of any such state adjudication. If, for its own purposes, or to accommodate the United States, the district court should determine to postpone the entry of a final decree in the condemnation proceeding pending such state adjudication, this would be an altogether proper exercise of judicial discretion.</p>\n<p id=\"b512-5\">We cannot perceive how anything will be gained by perfecting title in the United States unless and until California\u2019s ability and obligation to accept a transfer of the land and utilize it for the intended purposes, has been authoritatively determined. It need only be added that it is the pendency of the state action, and not this condemnation proceeding, which has occasioned any delay so far experienced, or which will be the cause of any further delay in completing this highway project.</p>\n<p id=\"b512-6\">The order under review is reversed and the cause is remanded with directions to vacate such order.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b505-11\">.
