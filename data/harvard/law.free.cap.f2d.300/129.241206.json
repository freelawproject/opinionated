The first trial, in April, 1961, was terminated when the jury failed to agree. Judgment was for plaintiff in the second trial before Judge McGohey and a jury in June, 1961.</p>\n<p id=\"b201-25\">Harry Richard Hender, employed by defendant as a conductor, was confined to a Connecticut state mental institution on March 22, 1957, where he remained until July 10, 1957. Prior to that time, he had had a record of irrational and violent behavior on the job. While in the mental institution, his condition was diagnosed as a schizophrenic reaction, paranoid type. He was given tranquilizers for four weeks and then placed on group psychotherapy. He was placid and never violent during confinement. He did suffer from delusions that the doctor and his wife were going to poison him, that his fellow workers wanted him to lose his job and wanted \u201cto get\u201d him and that his fellow Masons wanted to get rid of him. Dr. Prins, of the state mental hospital, realized Hender\u2019s chance of recovery was extremely tenuous but believed there was a possibility of sealing over his delusions. On July 10, 1957 Hender was permitted to return home on the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"130\">*130</page-number>understanding he was still a patient of the institution, should continue taking thorazine, and was to report back at periodic intervals.</p>\n<p id=\"b202-4\">On July 29,1957, Hender was examined on behalf of defendant by Dr. Ralph Jenkins, a urologist in private practice, who made physical examinations for defendant. Dr. Jenkins noted Hender had been confined to a mental institution and requested a diagnosis and opinion from the institution. He received a letter from the superintendent stating that Hender was much improved and that \u201cit would be beneficial for him to resume his work as a train conductor.\u201d Hender was reemployed on July 31, 1957. Thereafter, Hender began telling fellow employees and others that people were trying to kill him with pills and that he was going to harm certain people. He also stated that the decedent Shepard, and one Cosier, were out to get him and to blackball him from the Masons. Numerous other statements and threats appear in the record. At least three such incidents, indicating Hender\u2019s propensity to do violence to fellow employees, were reported to supervisory personnel of defendant. Defendant, however, took no action.</p>\n<p id=\"b202-5\">On October 31, 1957 Mrs. Hender called the state hospital, informing them her husband was sick again. She was told to send him back. On November 5, 1957 Hender called Shepard and asked him to stop tormenting him. Mrs. Hender called the state hospital to send an ambulance for her husband, but when Hender heard of this, he threatened her with a butcher knife, and she called off the ambulance. Hender then left home and purchased a shotgun and shells. In the meantime, Mrs. Hender made three calls to the local police at East Haven and was told by them to warn Shepard. She did so.</p>\n<p id=\"b202-6\">At approximately 5:15 P.M. on the same day, Shepard was in the lead engine and Engineer Cosier was in the rear engine of four diesel engines coupled together in the Cedar Hill Yards. Hender boarded the diesels, killed Shepard and wounded Cosier with the shotgun. At this time Hender was not on duty and had not worked for two days prior to that time. Hender returned to his automobile, drove off and later gave himself up to the police.</p>\n<p id=\"b202-8\">Defendant recognizes the general rules as to the duty of the railroad to furnish a reasonably safe place to work and to take reasonable precautions to protect employees against foreseeable injury. Defendant asserts, however, \u201cthat no reasonable man could have found that defendant breached its duty to decedent.\u201d We do not agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b202-9\">Most of the defendant\u2019s argument and citations support the common law theory of negligence and absence of negligence. On the other hand, this, an FELA case, is \u201csignificantly different from the ordinary common-law negligence action. * * * \u201d Rogers v. Missouri Pacific R. Co., 352 U.S. 500, 509-510, 77 S.Ct. 443, 450, 1 L.Ed.2d 493 (1957). In Rogers, Mr. Justice Brennan recognized the rule in FELA cases as: \u201cJudicial appraisal of the proofs to determine whether a jury question is presented is narrowly limited to the single inquiry whether, with reason, the conclusion may be drawn that negligence of the employer played any part at all in the injury or death.\u201d 352 U.S. at pages 506-507, 77 S.Ct. at page 448. See also Fritts v. Toledo Terminal R. R. Co., 293 F.2d 361, 362 (6 Cir. 1961) (\u201c * * * the question for this court is whether there was a complete lack of probative facts. * * * \u201d) and Sinkler v. Missouri Pac. R. Co., 356 U.S. 326, 329, 78 S.Ct. 758, 762, 2 L.Ed.2d 799 (1958) (\u201cThis statute [is] an avowed departure from the rules of the common law. * * *</p>\n<p id=\"b202-13\">We believe Hender\u2019s record prior to his stay at the mental institution, his rehiring without a fully adequate report from the hospital, and defendant\u2019s failure to act when his conduct after reemployment was reported were matters for the consideration of the jury. We cannot say, in light of the sweeping precedents <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"131\">*131</page-number>in this field, the jury could not conclude defendant\u2019s act of rehiring and subsequent failure to act upon notice of Hender\u2019s conduct negligently caused Shepard\u2019s death. We find no merit in defendant\u2019s other contentions.</p>\n<p id=\"b203-5\">Affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
