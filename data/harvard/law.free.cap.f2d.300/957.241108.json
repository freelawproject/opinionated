JACKSON, Retired.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"ArLc\">WORLEY, Chief Judge.</author>\n<p id=\"Azg\">This is an appeal from the decision of the Trademark Trial and Appeal Board dismissing an opposition by appellant, owner of the registered trademark WORKMASTER for MASONRY SAWS, ^ against appellee s application for registration of the mark HYDRAMATIC for the same goods. The dismissal resulted from the board granting a motion by appellee to dismiss appellant\u2019s notice of opposition for failure to state a claim upon which relief could be granted.</p>\n<p id=\"AJKA\">The notice of opposition is based on three grounds. Broadly, they are (1) that appellee\u2019s mark so resembles appellant\u2019s mark as to be likely, when applied to appellee\u2019s goods, to cause confusion, or mistake or to deceive purchasers; (2) that appellee\u2019s mark, if not deceptively misdescriptive or otherwise deceptive, is merely descriptive; and (3) that appellee\u2019s mark, if not merely descriptive, is deceptively misdescriptive or deceptive.</p>\n<p id=\"Ap3\">In connection with the first ground, appellant relies on the marks being used on the same goods and takes the position that they are visually and phonetically similar and \u201care subject to meaningful association with one another.\u201d The other two grounds are based on the alleged hydraulic and automatic connotation of \u201cHYDRA-MATIC.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"Aqj\">In granting appellee\u2019s motion to dismiss, the board stated that \u201cit is apparent on its face that applicant\u2019s mark \u2018HYDRA-MATIC\u2019 does not resemble op-poser\u2019s mark \u2018WORKMASTER\u2019 in any manner calculated to cause confusion, mistake or deception of purchasers,\u201d citing its own decision in Essex Wire Corporation v. Eagle Electric Mfg. Co., 120 USPQ 123. The board further ruled that the allegations of the second ground were not adequate to support a claim of damage. The third ground of opposition was not specifically treated in the board\u2019s decisi\u00f3n.</p>\n<p id=\"AyY\">The issue is whether the dismissal of the notice of opposition for failure to state a cause of action was proper.</p>\n<p id=\"AhP\">If the ultimate proof s were limited to the bare record before the board an\u00bf here, that is, only to the marks themseiveS) we would agree with the board\u2019s conclusion. However, it must be remembered that appellant seeks to show something more than just the mere existence 0\u00a3 the competing marks. An analogous situation was before the Assistant Commissioner in Ethicon, Inc. v. The Seamlegg Rubber Company, 120 USPQ 114. The markg there were \u201cETHICON\u201d and \"EZON\" applied to related surgical supplies. In reversing the action of the Examiner of Interferences granting the applicant\u2019s motion to dismiss, the Assist-an^ Commissioner said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AkC\">The question of whether or not applicant\u2019s mark, when applied to its goods, so resembles opposer\u2019s previously used and registered mark as to be likely to cause confusion is a question of fact and not of law. <em>Fact questions should, ordinarily not be decided on a motion to dismiss. </em>(Emphasis supplied.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"ArM\">We, no more than the board, have any way \u00b0f knowing the strength or weakness \u00b0f the proofs appellant might have proffered in support of its allegations, but we do feel that the following excerpt from the Ethicon decision is relevant here:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AHMB\">* * * opposer should not be deprived of an opportunity to prefent facts which it believes support *ts ^ pleading and entitle it to the relief sought, <em>irrespective of how insurmountable the task may seem at this juncture. </em>(Emphasis supplied.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"ASI\">It seems to us that statement has application as well to appellant\u2019s second and third grounds of opposition; viz, alleged descriptiveness and, alternatively misdescriptiveness. While the board based its ruling on the allegation of descriptiveness on the fact that appellant does not assert it is presently engaged in the man<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"959\">*959</page-number>ufacture or sale of a \u201chydraulically-operated\u201d masonry saw,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> we are not convinced that appellant should have been denied the opportunity to offer its evidence on those two points, particularly in view of the failure of the board to treat the allegation of misdescriptiveness.</p>\n<p id=\"b1031-5\">The fact that appellant opposed registration of appellee\u2019s mark does not appear to be an idle gesture but clearly suggests a belief that it would be damaged thereby. Perfecting the appeal here further indicates appellant\u2019s conviction that the-evidence which it sought to offer would \u201centitle it to the relief sought.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1031-9\">In our opinion appellant has established its right to its \u201cday in court\u201d and should have been allowed the opportunity of offering proof in support of its-allegations.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1031-10\">The decision is reversed and remanded. Reversed and remanded.</p>\n<p id=\"b1031-11\">RICH, J., concurs in result only.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1031-6\">. Section 13 of the Lanham Act, 15 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 1063, reads:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1031-7\"><em>Any person </em>who believes that he would be damaged by the registration of a mark upon the principal register may, upon payment of the required fee, file a notice of opposition in the Patent Office, stating the grounds therefor, * * *.
