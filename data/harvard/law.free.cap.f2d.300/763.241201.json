The plaintiff sued the defendant under the Federal Employers\u2019 Liability Act for personal injuries sustained when he was hurt while opening a window of a railroad car. The jury gave him a verdict with a deduction for his own contributory negligence.</p>\n<p id=\"b835-17\">The basis of the plaintiff\u2019s complaint is that the judge failed to charge as fully as the plaintiff now says he should have done. We have examined the charge and the plaintiff\u2019s request. We do not agree that a further charge was required. We think the trial judge set out clearly the rule about contributory negligence and he said enough about assumption of risk to get any application of that doctrine out of the case.</p>\n<p id=\"b835-18\">The judgment of the district court will be affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
