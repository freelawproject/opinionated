The findings that seller was insolvent at the time of the conveyance, that it was made to hinder and delay the collection of the claim of appellee then in pending litigation, and to give preference over appellee to other creditors, that appellant had knowledge of such facts and circumstances as would have induced an ordinary prudent person to make inquiry, which inquiry would have led to the discovery of such purpose of seller and that the inquiry was not made, and also that the notice to creditors required under the Florida Bulk Sales statute was not given are not clearly erroneous. Rule 52(a), Fed.R.Civ.P., 28 U.S.C.A., James v. United States, 5 Cir., 1958, 252 F.2d 687. The conclusions drawn from the findings having adequate support and no prejudicial error appearing, we AFFIRM. F. S.A. \u00a7\u00a7 608, 55, 726.01, 726.02, 726.03 and 726.04; Jackson v.
