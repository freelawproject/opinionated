Yet he did not raise the constitutional question upon which he now relies at his trial or even in his notice of appeal to the Supreme Court of Puerto Rico.</p>\n<p id=\"b831-22\">The first hint of any possible assertion of constitutional infirmity in his conviction came over four months after trial when his counsel entered into a stipulation with the District Attorney as to the fact of record that the judge who presided at the trial had also acted as a committing magistrate. So far as appears in the record before us, appellant\u2019s counsel first raised the claim of deprivation of constitutional right in the Supreme Court of Puerto Rico. It seems to us that by waiting until that late stage of the proceeding to raise his constitutional question the appellant waived whatever right he might possibly have had. See Yakus v. United States, 321 U.S. 414, 444, 64 S.Ct. 660, 677, 88 L.Ed. 834 (1944), in which the Court said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b831-23\">\u201cNo procedural principle is more familiar to this Court than that a constitutional right may be forfeited in criminal as well as civil cases by the failure to make timely assertion of the right before a tribunal having jurisdiction to determine it. * * <em>\u00bb\u00bb</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b832-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"760\">*760</page-number>If a judge is subject to disqualification, the party concerned must complain promptly. He cannot be allowed to wait to see how the judge decides. In re United Shoe Machinery Corp., 276 F.2d 77, 79 (C.A.1, 1960).</p>\n<p id=\"b832-4\">An order will be entered dismissing the appeal under Rule 39(b) of this court.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
