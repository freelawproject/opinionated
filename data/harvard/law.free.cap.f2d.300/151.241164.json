A year following the last discovered violation appellee moved in the district court to have the injunction \u201ccancelled\u201d on the ground that it was a restriction on its business, which it described as highly competitive. The court, having found without any basis except talk that the injunction caused appellee \u201cirreparable damage,\u201d and having found no change in circumstances in appellee\u2019s methods of operation, granted the motion. The injunction, of course, merely directed appellee to do what the law obliged him to do in the first place. It requires a strong showing to justify the requested relief. United States v.

There was nothing here approaching this.</p>\n<p id=\"b224-4\">Judgment will be entered vacating the order of the District Court dissolving the injunction and ordering the injunction reinstated.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
