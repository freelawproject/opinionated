His appeal centers around the admission into evidence of copies of a document offered to prove the fact, recited in the document, that defendant had failed to report for civilian employment in lieu of military service, We hold that the document was properly received for the purpose indicated.</p>\n<p id=\"b951-5\">The indictment alleged that defendant was classified as a conscientious objector and ordered to report to the Los Angeles Department of Charities for civilian work contributing to the national health, safety and interest<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> and that he knowingly failed to report as ordered, in violation of 50 U.S.C.A.Appendix, \u00a7 462. On trial to the Court, the government offered in evidence photostats of the defendant\u2019s Selective Service System file. Defendant objected to the admission of one document in the file, identified as Selective Service Form 153. The government also introduced the Department of Charities\u2019 file relating to defendant, authenticated by the testimony of Horace W. Hingston, Personnel Officer of that Department. This file contained a carbon copy of the same Form 153.</p>\n<p id=\"b951-6\">Form 153 is a printed form titled \u201cOrder to Report for Civilian Work and Statement of Employer.\u201d We are concerned with the portion of the form titled \u201cStatement of Employer,\u201d the first line of which had been filled in to read, \u201cThe registrant identified above <em>reported </em>for civilian work on the 29 day of November, 1960, to.\u201d (Emphasis supplied.) The name and address of the Department of Charities was then typed in, followed by the signature of the witness Hingston as Personnel Officer of the Department, Below the date, the notation \u201c(Did Not Report)\u201d had been inserted. The failure to strike the word \u201creported\u201d from the printed language of the form, when the words \u201cDid Not Report\u201d were added to it, left the document ambiguous on its face.</p>\n<p id=\"b951-10\">Mr. Hingston testified that it was his duty, assisted by a staff of six or seven people, to supervise the employment of conscientious objectors assigned to the Department of Charities for civilian work in lieu of induction. He testified that he had no independent recollection of defendant\u2019s case, but described the Department\u2019s general procedure as follows : His office received copies of Forms 153 from the Selective Service Board. The date on which each individual was to report for work was indicated either on the form or in a separate letter from the Board. If an individual did not report as ordered, one of Mr. Hingston\u2019s assistants entered the notation, \u201c \u2018Did not report,\u2019 or something similar to that\u201d on the form, and Mr. Hingston then signed the report and returned it to the Board. Mr. Hingston was asked whether he was able to ascertain by an examination of the Department of Charities\u2019 file, including Form 153, whether defendant had in fact reported on November 29, 1960. He answered that the defendant had not reported.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b951-11\">The documentary evidence in the record, including Form 153 as explained by Mr. Hingston\u2019s testimony, was sufficient to support the trial court\u2019s determination that defendant did in fact knowingly fail to report as ordered.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> However, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"880\">*880</page-number>defendant argues that Form 153 was not admissible as proof of the recited fact of failure to report, and that the evidence of failure to report, other than Form 153, was inadequate.</p>\n<p id=\"b952-4\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b952-5\"> By the terms of 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1732, Form 153 was admissible to prove defendant\u2019s failure to report as a record of that occurrence made in the regular course of business. The operations of the instrumentalities of government constitute \u201cbusiness\u201d within the meaning of the statute,<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> and this is true of the operations of state and county agencies as well as those of the federal government agencies.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Mr. Kingston\u2019s testimony, plus the whole interrelated content of the Selective Service file, established that Form 153 was completed in the routine day-to-day operations of the Local Board and the Department of Charities. It was precisely the kind of contemporaneous record of events, systematically prepared by an agency for its own use and relied upon by it in the performance of its functions, which experience has shown to be trustworthy, and which therefore falls within the purpose and scope of the business records exception to the hearsay rule codified in Section 1732.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b952-6\">Mr. Hingston testified that an examination of office files covering a period of years showed that the general practice was to record a failure to report by writing the phrase \u201cDid not report\u201d on Form 153. He further testified that the printed word \u201creported\u201d was sometimes crossed out, but usually was not. On cross-examination he testified that words other than \u201cDid not report\u201d were sometimes used to indicate failure to report, and that the exact procedure was left to the particular subordinate who made the notation in the particular case. Defendant argues that because of these variations in the mode of entry Form 153 cannot qualify as a report made in the \u201cregular course\u201d of business within the meaning of Section 1732.</p>\n<p id=\"b952-12\">The content and method of preparation of the document sought to be introduced as a business record are relevant to the extent that they bear upon whether the particular document was prepared in the course of systematic routine office procedures to record information relating to, and to be used in, the routine operations of the business or agency. If the particular document is not of this sort it would not be admissible as a business record.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> But if it is a record of this character, then it is admissible, whether or not it is also a type of document which is prepared repeatedly, or always in precisely the same way, or with precisely the same content. And of course the admissibility of a document, as distinguished from its weight, normally does not depend upon either completeness or freedom from ambiguity.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b953-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"881\">*881</page-number>Mr. Hingston testified that he did not have personal knowledge of defendant\u2019s failure to report, and defendant insists that the employee who observed the fact should have been available for cross-examination. Section 1732 provides that \u201clack of personal knowledge by the entrant or maker\u201d affects only the weight of the business record and not its admissibility. It is true that some decisions under the statute have continued to apply the common-law rule that the record must reflect the personal observation of the entrant, but it is also held that this requirement is satisfied when it appears that the entry was based upon oral or written reports made to the entrant in the regular course of business by others in the agency who had personal knowledge of the transaction reported.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> The underlying purpose of Section 1732 was to render it unnecessary to produce as witnesses all those who may have had a part in preparing the document or furnishing the information reflected in it.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> Thus it is sufficient that the entry by Mr. Hingston,<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> made in the regular course of the business of his office, was based upon the report of any one of his six or seven subordinates, made to Mr. Hingston in the regular course of the business of the office, to the effect that the subordinate had personally observed that the defendant failed to report when ordered.</p>\n<p id=\"b953-13\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b953-14\">Form 153 was also admissible in proof of defendant\u2019s failure to report under the exception to the hearsay rule applicable to statements prepared by public servants as part of their official duties. As an official record of the Selective Service System, Form 153 was admissible by the express terms of 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1733,<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> which codifies the \u201cofficial statements\u201d exception to the hearsay rule as applied to records of the federal government, since those who observed and recorded defendant\u2019s failure to report acted as <em>ad hoc </em>officials of the Selective Service System<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> And, in any event, the form was admissible as an official statement of these people in their capacity as officials <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"882\">*882</page-number>of the Department of Charities, for the official statements exception, as a common-law rule, is applied to state and county records as well as federal records.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> Either status of the entrants in this instance would provide the guaranty of trustworthiness which supports the admission of official records. And in either event the fullness and completeness of the official document would bear upon its weight and not upon its admissibility.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b954-4\">It is also sometimes said of official records, as of business records, that they are admissible in proof of the facts recited only if the entrant could have testified to those facts as a witness.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> However, these authorities also recognize that it is sufficient if the facts recorded were observed by the entrant\u2019s subordinates ;<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> and, as noted, in the present case it is a necessary inference that defendant's failure to report was observed by one of Mr. Kingston\u2019s staff.<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> And again, if the subordinate rather than Mr. Hingston is to be treated as the entrant, it is ordinarily unnecessary to produce as a witness the person who created the official record. Indeed, the necessity which justifies the admission of official records in lieu of testimony is the burden which otherwise would be imposed upon government operations if all those who participated in the preparation of government records were required to appear and testify.<footnotemark>19</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b954-14\">Finally, we do not exclude the possibility, though we find it unnecessary to explore it, that if Form 153 were not technically admissible under either the business records or official statements exception, it might nonetheless come in under Rule 26 of the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure, 18 U.S.C.<footnotemark>20</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b954-15\">Affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b951-7\">. See 50 U.S.C.A.Appendix, \u00a7 456(j).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b951-8\">. Defendant appears to contend that Mr. Hingston\u2019s testimony in this regard was based upon only part of the Department\u2019s files relating to the defendant. We read the record to the contrary.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b951-9\">. The files of the Selective Service System detail the step-by-step development of defendant\u2019s ultimate determination to reject the Board\u2019s order, and render virtually irresistible the inference that he knowingly failed to report. On July 21, 1958 defendant advised tbe Board of his conscientious objection to war, and requested the special Conscientious Objector form. He stated in this form that he was \u201cabsolutely opposed to participation in war or assisting others to participate in war.\u201d Satisfied with his showing, the Board on September 4th classified defendant 1-0. On May 31, 1960, defendant wrote the Beard stating, \u201cMy conscience do not permit me to do any civilian service.\u201d He appeared before the Board on June 15th, and the clerk of the Board <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"880\">*880</page-number>noted that \u201cwhen asked if he would he willing to accept civilian work in lieu of induction, he stated he did not believe he could if it was connected with the military in any way.\u201d He was asked to complete an application for civilian employment in lieu of induction, but returned the form without completing it. On July 1st, the Board wrote defendant offering him throe specific types of civilian employment, but received no response. Defendant reported to the Board for an interview on October 6, 1960, and stated that he would refuse to perform any civilian work for Selective Service.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b952-8\">.

Rule 26 provides the standards for the admissibility of evidence in criminal proceedings in federal district courts.

Dallas County v. Commercial Union Assur. Co., 286 F.2d 388, 394-398 (5th Cir. 1961). Rule 26 provides more, rather than less, liberal standards for the admission of evidence. (Preliminary Report on the Advisability and Feasibility of Developing Uniform Rules of Evidence for the United States District Courts, Committee on Rules of Practice and Procedure of the Judicial Conference of the United States, Feb. 1962, pp. 26-27.)
