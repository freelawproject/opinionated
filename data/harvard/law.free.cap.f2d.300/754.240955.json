We affirm. Appellant\u2019s waiver was sanctioned by 11 U.S.C. \u00a7 737(2) (1958), and his desire to escape from its consequences does not amount to \u201cproper circumstances\u201d to justify the referee\u2019s modification of his order. See In re: Frischknecht, 223 F. 417 (2d Cir. 1915); In re: Harry Smith Machine Co., 232 F.2d 950 (9th Cir. 1956). In the light of this conclusion we do not reach the question of the jurisdiction of the referee to modify his previous order.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b826-14\">. \u201cRule 7 \u2014 Modification of Referee\u2019s Order</p>\n<p id=\"ATT\">\u201cAny order or finding of a referee may, under proper circumstances, be reconsidered, vacated or modified by him at any time while the case in which the order or finding is made is still pending before him.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
