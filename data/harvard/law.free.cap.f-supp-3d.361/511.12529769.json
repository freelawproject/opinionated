Beginning in 1988, they maintained a Swiss bank account at the Union Bank of Switzerland (\"UBS\"), with money that Peter earned working as an anesthesiologist in Saudi Arabia. When they returned to the United States they did not close their Swiss bank account; by 2008, its balance was almost $ 2 million. Toward the end of 2008, Peter transferred the money to another Swiss bank account, at Finter Bank (\"Finter\"), this time in his name only. Yet, Peter, who communicated for the couple with their accountant, never mentioned the accounts, and they signed their tax returns each year without ever answering \"Yes\" to the income tax return question about whether they had money in an overseas account or filing a file Form TD F 90-22.1 (\"FBAR\") to disclose either account. In 2010, they disclosed the funds for the first time, and in June 2014, the Government assessed penalties of $ 247,030 against each of them for their alleged willful failure to disclose the UBS account for the 2007 tax year and penalties of $ 247,030 against each of them for their alleged willful failure to disclose the Finter account for the 2008 tax year.</attorneys>\n\n\n<p id=\"p-11\"><strong><em>FBAR Penalties</em></strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p id=\"p-15\">It is true that <extracted-citation index=\"13\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=31%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%20103.27\">31 C.F.R. \u00a7 103.27</extracted-citation>, which is now <extracted-citation index=\"14\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=31%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%201010.820\">31 C.F.R. \u00a7 1010.820</extracted-citation>(g)(2), provides that \"[f]or any willful violation committed after October 27, 1986 ... the Secretary may assess upon any person, a civil penalty[ ] ... not to exceed the greater of the amount (not to exceed $ 100,000) equal to the balance in the account at the time of the violation, or $ 25,000.\" <extracted-citation index=\"15\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=31%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%201010.820\">31 C.F.R. \u00a7 1010.820</extracted-citation>(g)(2) (reorganized and <a class=\"page-label\" data-citation-index=\"1\" data-label=\"515\" href=\"#p515\" id=\"p515\">*515</a>renumbered, with technical corrections, eff.

Jt. Stip. of Facts 1. They lived and worked in Saudi Arabia from 1984 to 1992 and 1994 to 2001. <em>Id.</em> \u00b6\u00b6 4, 9, 10. Susan, who only worked part of the time they resided in Saudi Arabia, was paid in cash, which she spent on family living expenses. <em>Id.</em> \u00b6\u00b6 10, 13, 14. From 1984 to 1988, Peter \"deposited most of his salary into a Saudi Arabian account at Al-Rajhi Bank, which had a branch at the King Feisal Hospital where he worked.\" <em>Id.</em> \u00b6 12.</p>\n<p id=\"p-24\">Using funds from his Al-Rajhi Bank account, Peter established an account at the Swiss bank Foreign Commerce Bank (\"FOCO\") in 1988. <em>Id.</em> \u00b6 16. When the Horowitzes returned to the United States in 1992, \"Peter withdrew the remaining balance in his account at Al-Rajhi Bank.\" <em>Id.</em> \u00b6 18.</p>\n<attorneys id=\"p-25\">In 1994, the Horowitzes returned to Saudi Arabia, and Peter closed the FOCO bank account and opened an account at the Union Bank of Switzerland (\"UBS\"), \"using funds transferred from his FOCO account.\" <em>Id.</em> \u00b6\u00b6 19, 21, 22. Peter and Susan jointly owned the UBS account, and the \"account opening documents listed an address for Peter and Susan [in] Saudi Arabia.\" <em>Id.</em> \u00b6\u00b6 23, 27. Peter used his account at the Al-Rajhi Bank again beginning in 1997 and transferred his savings to the UBS account. <em>Id.</em> \u00b6 25.</attorneys>\n\n<p id=\"p-27\">From 2001 to 2008, Peter monitored the UBS account \"by calling the bank every year or two,\" and neither of the Horowitzes made any deposits into or withdrawals from the account. <em>Id.</em> \u00b6\u00b6 28-29. After \"read[ing] troubling news articles concerning UBS,\" Peter called UBS and then traveled to Switzerland in October 2008 and closed the account. <em>Id.</em> \u00b6\u00b6 30, 32, 34-35.</p>\n<attorneys id=\"p-28\">Peter transferred the account balance to an account that he opened at another Swiss bank, Finter Bank (\"Finter\"). <em>Id.</em> \u00b6 36. Peter had brought Susan's passport with him \"to designate her as a joint account owner of the Finter account at the time that he opened that account,\" but Finter would not allow him to do so because Susan was not present. <em>Id.</em> \u00b6 37. When Peter opened the account, he filled out a \"List of Authorized Signatories and Powers of Attorney for Natural Persons,\" designating Susan as a person to whom he gave \"an unlimited power of attorney.\" Finter Bank Docs., ECF No. 87-8, at 1-2.

ECF No. 66.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The Horowitzes have filed a cross-motion for summary judgment, ECF No. 68, arguing that the IRS reversed the 2014 penalties, such that the penalties the Government is trying to collect were not assessed until 2016, at which time they were untimely. They also argue that their failure to disclose was not willful-a point that would reduce the maximum penalties from 50% of the amount in the foreign account at the time of the violation to $ 10,000. Because the Horowitzes have not shown that the IRS actually reversed the penalties in 2014, they have not established that the statute of limitations ran before the penalties were assessed. Further, the undisputed facts show that their failure to disclose the UBS account on their 2007 tax return was willful, and that Peter's failure to disclose the Finter account on their 2008 tax return also was willful. Therefore, <a class=\"page-label\" data-citation-index=\"1\" data-label=\"514\" href=\"#p514\" id=\"p514\">*514</a>the Government's motion will be granted and Defendants' denied with regard to the penalties for 2007 and those assessed against Peter for 2008.</p><p id=\"p-10\">But, as noted, in October 2008, Peter transferred the funds out of their joint Swiss bank account into a Swiss bank account in his name only at Finter Bank. Despite the undisputed evidence that the parties intended for Susan to be a holder on that account as well, and that they added her to the account in 2009, Susan was not an account holder on the Finter account in 2008.

Therefore, she had no obligation to disclose the Finter account, and FBAR penalties against her for 2008 are not appropriate.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Accordingly, Susan's individual motion for partial summary judgment on this claim regarding 2008 penalties is granted, and the Government's motion with regard to 2008 penalties against Susan will be denied.</p><p id=\"p-12\">Individuals who pay taxes to the United States must \"report annually to the Internal Revenue Service ('IRS') any financial interests they have in any bank, securities, or other financial accounts in a foreign country.\" <em>United States v.

But, it does not agree that these actions amounted to an actual removal of the penalties themselves. <em>Id.</em> at 21-23.</p><p id=\"p-55\">Significantly, Beasley's statements in this regard conflict, as she first declared that she did not reverse the June 2014 assessments and then testified that she did. <em>Compare</em> May 20, 2016 Email from Beasley, ECF No. 87-37, at 1 (stating that Batman was \"correct\" that \"the assessed FBAR penalty was never reversed for both Peter and Susan Horowitz,\" as all Beasley did was \"remove the date Penalty was input\" without \"clear[ing] the information\"), <em>and</em> Jan. 24, 2017 Beasley Decl. \u00b6\u00b6 9-11 (\"I was asked to 'remove' or 'reverse' the June 13, 2014 assessment.... In response to that request, I merely cleared the information in the 'Date Penalty Input' field within the database which is used to track FBAR assessments.... [M]y actions did not effect a reversal or removal of the June 13, 2014 assessment.\"), <em>with</em> Apr. 26, 2017 Beasley Tr. 28:2-9 (\"Q ... [Y]ou said you removed the penalty input date. Does that mean, when you said you followed her instruction, her instruction was remove and reverse the assessed penalties for '07 and '08. Did you remove and reverse the assessed penalties for '07 and '08? A Yes.\"). Thus, Defendants have not demonstrated through evidence of <em>undisputed</em> facts that Beasley reversed the assessment, such that the timely assessment was vacated and the statute of limitations for assessing penalties had run by the time the IRS assessed FBAR penalties in May 2016.</p><p id=\"p-56\">Moreover, \"[t]he statute of limitations is an affirmative defense for which the defendant bears the burden of proof.\" <em>Windsor v.

Defendants have not shown that, even if Beasley believed she reversed the penalty, she had the authority to do so. Notably, to assess the penalties <a class=\"page-label\" data-citation-index=\"1\" data-label=\"521\" href=\"#p521\" id=\"p521\">*521</a>in the first place, Beasley not only input the data; she then printed a form that her manager signed.

For Beasley to be able to reverse or remove an FBAR penalty assessment without her manager's signature would be incongruous with his initial signature required to impose the penalty in the first instance.</p><p id=\"p-57\">And, as the Government notes, Gov't Am.

If an offer to compromise any debt in excess of $ 100,000 is acceptable to the agency, the agency shall refer the debt to the Civil Division or other appropriate litigating division in the Department of Justice using a Claims Collection Litigation Report (CCLR).

But, Defendants have not established that, when the IRS could not \"compromise\" an FBAR penalty above $ 100,000 at all without DOJ approval, it nonetheless could eliminate the debt altogether by removing the FBAR penalties after they undisputedly were assessed. Therefore, Defendants have not proven that the timely FBAR assessments were reversed or removed when Beasley altered the data, nor have they established that she had the authority to reverse an assessment. Consequently, they have not met their burden of proving that the statute of limitations ran before the FBAR penalties were assessed.</p><p id=\"p-60\"><a class=\"page-label\" data-citation-index=\"1\" data-label=\"522\" href=\"#p522\" id=\"p522\">*522</a><em>See</em> <em>Goodman,</em> <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6047463\" index=\"66\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/494/458/#p464\">494 F.3d at </extracted-citation>464 ; <em>Windsor</em> , <extracted-citation index=\"67\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2016%20WL%204939294\">2016 WL 4939294</extracted-citation>, at *9.

The IRS assessed penalties against both Horowitzes for willful failure to disclose the UBS bank account by June 2008 and the Finter bank account by June 2009. Thus, with regard to Peter's failure to file either a 2007 or 2008 FBAR and Susan's failure to file a 2007 FBAR, the issue is simply whether the failure was willful. As for Susan's failure to file a FBAR for 2008 disclosing the Finter account, there is the added issue of whether she was required to make that disclosure.

Susan counters that, despite their intent, she simply was not an owner of the Finter account in 2008 and, because she had not provided a \"signature specimen\" on the power of attorney form, she did not have any authority over the account. Susan's Am. Reply 13.</p><p id=\"p-71\">The Government relies on the 2011 definitions of \"financial interest\" and \"other authority\" that the Treasury Regulations provide. <em>See</em> Gov't Am.

The definition of \"financial interest\" states:</p><p id=\"p-75\">It is true that Peter took the funds in the UBS account, which Susan jointly held, and tried to open the Finter account on behalf of himself and Susan. And, he granted Susan power of attorney for the Finter account. But, when Fitner would not allow him to open the account in both of their names, he proceeded to take their joint funds and place them into an account in his name only, over which Susan could not exercise any control without traveling to Switzerland and providing a signature specimen. Taking money that was in Susan's <a class=\"page-label\" data-citation-index=\"1\" data-label=\"524\" href=\"#p524\" id=\"p524\">*524</a>name and placing it in an account that was not in her name cannot, in any light, be seen as acting on her behalf.</p><p id=\"p-77\">Nor did she have any authority over the account. The definition of \"signature or other authority\" as of 2011 is \"the authority of an individual (alone or in conjunction with another) to control the disposition of money, funds or other assets held in a financial account by direct communication (whether in writing or otherwise) to the person with whom the financial account is maintained.\" <extracted-citation index=\"82\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=31%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%201010.350\">31 C.F.R. \u00a7 1010.350</extracted-citation>(f)(1) ; <em>see</em> Gov't Am.

As noted, the Government acknowledges that she \"could exercise signatory status <em>once</em> she provided a signature specimen to Finter.\" <em>See</em> Gov't Am. Opp'n to Susan's Mot. 6 (emphasis added). Had she done so in 2008, she would have had signatory status and, therefore, authority over the account in 2008. But she did not. Without that signature specimen, she could not write to, or otherwise directly communicate with, the bank \"to control the disposition of money, funds or other assets\" in the Finter account. <em>See</em> <extracted-citation index=\"83\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=31%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%201010.350\">31 C.F.R. \u00a7 1010.350</extracted-citation>(f)(1).

And they offer evidence (much of which is currently disputed) intended to prove that Peter originally selected the UBS account to avoid paying taxes on the overseas funds and then moved the Horowitzes' money from the UBS account because otherwise the account would have been disclosed and they would have had to pay taxes on it. E.G., News articles, \"Ex-UBS Banker Pleads Guilty in Tax Evasion\"; \"Feds Press Swiss Bank to Name U.S. Clients --- Tax Officials <a class=\"page-label\" data-citation-index=\"1\" data-label=\"525\" href=\"#p525\" id=\"p525\">*525</a>Target An Alleged Dodge; UBS Caught in Blind\"; \"U.S. Asks Court to Force UBS to Provide Names\"; \"Judge Clears U.S. Request for UBS Clients' Names\"; \"Senate Report Examines Role of Banks in Tax Evasion\"; \"Senate Report Today Alleges Foreign Banks Help Hide Wealthy Americans' Money\"; \"UBS says it will drop some offshore services for U.S. clients Change should help IRS keep tabs on evasion\"; \"Senate Probe's Targets Give to Campaigns Report Accuses Bank Officials of Helping Clients Hide Money From the IRS\"; \"IRS, Justice Target Undisclosed Assets in Swiss Accounts\"; \"Notice to UBS Accountholders,\" dated Nov. 10, 2009, ECF Nos. 87-44-87-53.</p><p id=\"p-82\">But, the Government did not charge Susan with an FBAR violation with regard to the <em>UBS</em> account, and in this litigation it does not seek to collect penalties assessed for 2008 with regard to the UBS account. Certainly, its desire to pursue penalties on the Finter account for 2008 instead makes sense, since the UBS account no longer had any funds at the time of the 2008 FBAR violation, and therefore the penalty would have been capped at $ 100,000. <em>See</em> <extracted-citation index=\"86\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=31%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%205321\">31 U.S.C. \u00a7 5321</extracted-citation>(a)(5)(C)(i) (providing that the maximum penalty for a willful violation is \"the <em>greater</em> of-(I) $ 100,000, or (II) 50 percent of the [balance in the account at the time of the violation]\"). But, it could have recognized that it would not be able to collect against Susan and instead assessed a greater penalty against Peter for the Finter account. Essentially, it could have assessed approximately the same total penalty for 2008 ($ 494,060) by assessing a penalty of 50% of the account balance against Peter instead of an approximately 25% penalty against each of the Defendants. This would have been a logical approach, given that before October 2008 and after October 2009, these were joint funds but Susan was not a Finter account owner in 2008. The outcome would have been that the couple, who jointly paid their taxes and maintained joint accounts for years, would, together, have had to pay the same amount of penalty that the Government sought to recover by assessing a $ 247,030 penalty against Susan for 2008. The Government did not take this approach, however, and it cannot now collect on a penalty it did not assess. Susan's Motion for Partial Summary Judgment IS GRANTED.</p><p id=\"p-84\">The Horowitzes testified that, based on conversations with other expatriates living in Saudi Arabia, they believed that, for \"income that was earned in Saudi Arabia, taxes were paid on that income from Saudi Arabia\" and \"if you banked it overseas, ... you didn't have to pay U.S. taxes on that income.\" P.

The Government relies on Schedule B of the Form 1040s that the Horowitzes both signed for 2007 and 2008, which included a simple instruction in Part III: \"<strong>You must complete this part if you</strong> (a) had over $ 1,500 of taxable interest or ordinary dividends; or <strong>(b) had a foreign account</strong> ....\" Form 1040, Sched.

B, ECF No. 87-16, at 8; Form 1040, Sched. B ECF No. 87-17, at 7. But, the instruction made clear that Part III also applied to taxpayers with foreign accounts, and, unlike the question covered by subsection (a), the response required by subsection (b) regarding foreign accounts in no way turned on whether the Horowitzes believed the foreign account was taxable-merely on whether it existed. Peter and Susan had the UBS account in 2007 and until October, 2008, and Peter had the Finter account beginning in October 2008. Neither can claim that they did not know that Part III had to be filled out with regard to those unmistakably \"foreign account[s].\"</p><p id=\"p-86\">Schedule B then included a simple question:</p><p id=\"p-89\">Form 1040, Sched.

B, ECF No. 87-16, at 8; Form 1040, Sched. B ECF No. 87-17, at 7. Again, the Horowitzes cannot contend that they did not know that they had an interest in their UBS account until October 2008, and Peter cannot contend that he did not know that he had an interest in the Finter account later in 2008.

Like the Horowitzes, <a class=\"page-label\" data-citation-index=\"1\" data-label=\"527\" href=\"#p527\" id=\"p527\">*527</a>Williams later disclosed his foreign accounts when he applied to the Offshore Voluntary Compliance Initiative. <em><extracted-citation index=\"90\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=31%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%205314\">Id.</extracted-citation></em><extracted-citation index=\"90\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=31%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%205314\"> at 657</extracted-citation>.</p><p id=\"p-91\">The facts diverge in two regards, however. First, unlike the Horowitz's accountants, Williams's accountant had asked whether he had an interest in a foreign bank account, and Williams had said no. <em><extracted-citation index=\"91\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=31%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%205314\">Id.</extracted-citation></em><extracted-citation index=\"91\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=31%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%205314\"> at 656</extracted-citation>. Second, Williams was charged with and pled guilty to conspiracy to defraud and criminal tax evasion, related to his funds held in foreign accounts. And, in pleading guilty, Williams admitted that he knew that the interest from the funds in his foreign accounts was \"taxable income to [him]\" and that he</p><p class=\"attorneys\" id=\"p-92\">had the obligation to report to the IRS and/or the Department of the Treasury the existence of the Swiss accounts, but for the calendar year tax returns 1993 through 2000, [he] chose not to in order to assist in hiding [his] true income from the IRS and evade taxes thereon.</p><p id=\"p-93\"><em><extracted-citation index=\"92\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=31%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%205314\">Id.</extracted-citation></em><extracted-citation index=\"92\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=31%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%205314\"> at 657</extracted-citation>.</p><p id=\"p-94\">The IRS assessed civil penalties against Williams, and the Government sought to enforce them through a civil action in the Eastern District of Virginia. <em><extracted-citation index=\"93\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=31%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%205314\">Id.</extracted-citation></em> The district court entered judgment in favor of Williams, and the government appealed. <em><extracted-citation index=\"94\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=31%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%205314\">Id.</extracted-citation></em> The question before both courts was \"whether the violation was willful.\" <em><extracted-citation index=\"95\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=31%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%205314\">Id.</extracted-citation></em><extracted-citation index=\"95\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=31%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%205314\"> at 658</extracted-citation>. The district court found that Williams' violation was not willful because he \"lacked any motivation to willfully conceal the accounts from authorities,\" which already knew about the accounts, and because he did not fail to disclose the accounts \"intentionally or in deliberate disregard for the law\"; the district court reasoned that the failure to disclose was \"an understandable omission given the context in which it occurred.\" <em><extracted-citation index=\"96\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=31%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%205314\">Id.</extracted-citation></em><extracted-citation index=\"96\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=31%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%205314\"> at 658</extracted-citation>.</p><p id=\"p-95\">The Fourth Circuit disagreed and reversed.

Additionally, his \"guilty plea allocution further confirm[ed] that his violation of \u00a7 5314 was willful.\" <em>Id.</em> at 660.

The Fourth Circuit stated that Williams's \"conduct constitute[d] willful blindness to the FBAR requirement,\" which it stated was \"equally culpable under the law\" to \"actual knowledge.\" <em>Id.</em> (quoting <em>Poole,</em> <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4203484\" index=\"120\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/640/114/#p122\">640 F.3d at </extracted-citation>122 ). It concluded that, \"at a minimum, Williams's undisputed actions establish reckless conduct, which satisfies the proof requirement under \u00a7 5314.\" <em>Id.</em> at 660.</p><p id=\"p-104\">Here, it is undisputed that the Horowitzes signed their 2007 and 2008 tax returns.

It also is undisputed that the tax returns included a question of whether they had foreign accounts, followed by a cross-reference to \"exceptions and filing requirements for Form TD F 90-22.1 [FBAR].\" Because \"[a] taxpayer who signs a tax return will not be heard to claim innocence for not having actually read the return, as he or she is charged with constructive knowledge of its contents, [their] signature[s] [are] prima facie evidence that [they] knew the contents of the return,\" including the foreign accounts question and the cross-reference to \"filing requirements, which put them \"on inquiry notice of the FBAR requirement.\" <em>See</em> <em>Williams II</em> , 489 Fed App'x at 659 (quoting <em>Greer,</em> <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4215922\" index=\"121\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/595/338/\">595 F.3d at </extracted-citation>347 n.4 ).</p><p id=\"p-105\">The Horowitzes argue that their friends told them they did not need to pay taxes on the interest in their foreign accounts. Maybe so, but their friends' credentials are not before the Court, nor is there any information from which I could assess whether it was reasonable for them to have accepted what their friends told them as legally correct. And, in any event, their friends' views would not override the clear instructions on Schedule B, which, as noted, requires a \"Yes\" answer if the taxpayer has an interest in a foreign account, regardless of whether the funds within it constituted taxable income. Moreover, the fact that the Horowitzes discussed their tax liabilities for their foreign accounts with their friends demonstrates their awareness that the income could be taxable. Their failure to have the same conversation with the accountants they entrusted with their taxes for years, notwithstanding the requirement that taxpayers with foreign accounts complete Part III of Schedule B, easily shows \"a conscious effort to avoid learning about reporting requirements.\" <em>Williams II</em> , 489 Fed. App'x at 658 (quoting <em>Sturman,</em> <extracted-citation case-ids=\"10528880\" index=\"122\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/951/1466/#p1476\">951 F.2d at </extracted-citation>1476 ). On these facts, willful blindness may be inferred. <em>See</em> <em>Poole,</em> <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4203484\" index=\"123\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/640/114/#p122\">640 F.3d at 122</extracted-citation> (\"[I]n a criminal tax prosecution, when the evidence supports an inference that a defendant was subjectively aware of a high probability of the existence of a tax liability, and purposefully avoided learning the facts pointing to such liability, the trier of fact may find that the defendant exhibited 'willful blindness' satisfying the scienter requirement of knowledge.\" (quoted in <em>Williams II</em> in the context of civil liability) ). Thus, even without the additional evidence that was present in <em>Williams II</em> , I find based on these undisputed facts that the Horowitzes recklessly disregarded the FBAR filing requirement. <em>See</em> <em>Williams II</em> , 489 Fed App'x at 659. This suffices for a finding of willfulness. <em>See <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4203484\" index=\"124\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/640/114/#p122\">id.</extracted-citation></em> ; <em>Safeco,</em> <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3573430\" index=\"125\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/551/47/#p57\">551 U.S. at 57</extracted-citation>, <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3573430\" index=\"126\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/551/47/#p57\">127 S.Ct. 2201</extracted-citation>.</p><p id=\"p-106\"><strong><em>Conclusion</em></strong></p><p id=\"p-107\">In sum, Susan Horowitz's Motion for Partial Summary Judgment, ECF No. 67, IS GRANTED; the Government's Motion for Summary Judgment, ECF No. 66, IS GRANTED as to the 2007 penalties assessed against Peter and Susan and the 2008 penalties against Peter but DENIED as to the 2008 penalties against Susan; and Defendants' Motion for Summary Judgment, ECF No. 68, IS DENIED.
