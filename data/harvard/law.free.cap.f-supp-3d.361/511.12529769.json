Grimm, United States District Judge\n     United States citizens Peter Horowitz and Susan Horowitz lived in Saudi Arabia for most years between 1984 and 2001. Beginning in 1988, they maintained a Swiss bank account at the Union Bank of Switzerland (\"UBS\"), with money that Peter earned working as an anesthesiologist in Saudi Arabia. When they returned to the United States they did not close their Swiss bank account; by 2008, its balance was almost $ 2 million. Toward the end of 2008, Peter transferred the money to another Swiss bank account, at Finter Bank (\"Finter\"), this time in his name only. Yet, Peter, who communicated for the couple with their accountant, never mentioned the accounts, and they signed their tax returns each year without ever answering \"Yes\" to the income tax return question about whether they had money in an overseas account or filing a file Form TD F 90-22.1 (\"FBAR\") to disclose either account. In 2010, they disclosed the funds for the first time, and in June 2014, the Government assessed penalties of $ 247,030 against each of them for their alleged willful failure to disclose the UBS account for the 2007 tax year and penalties of $ 247,030 against each of them for their alleged willful failure to disclose the Finter account for the 2008 tax year.\n     </p>\n     <p id=\"p-11\">\n      <strong>\n       <em>\n        FBAR Penalties\n       </em>\n      </strong>\n     </p>\n     <p id=\"p-15\">\n      It is true that\n      <extracted-citation index=\"13\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=31%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%20103.27\">\n       31 C.F.R. \u00a7 103.27\n      </extracted-citation>\n      , which is now\n      <extracted-citation index=\"14\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=31%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%201010.820\">\n       31 C.F.R. \u00a7 1010.820\n      </extracted-citation>\n      (g)(2), provides that \"[f]or any willful violation committed after October 27, 1986 ... the Secretary may assess upon any person, a civil penalty[ ] ... not to exceed the greater of the amount (not to exceed $ 100,000) equal to the balance in the account at the time of the violation, or $ 25,000.\"\n      <extracted-citation index=\"15\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=31%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%201010.820\">\n       31 C.F.R. \u00a7 1010.820\n      </extracted-citation>\n      (g)(2) (reorganized and\n     renumbered, with technical corrections, eff.

They also argue that their failure to disclose was not willful-a point that would reduce the maximum penalties from 50% of the amount in the foreign account at the time of the violation to $ 10,000. Because the Horowitzes have not shown that the IRS actually reversed the penalties in 2014, they have not established that the statute of limitations ran before the penalties were assessed. Further, the undisputed facts show that their failure to disclose the UBS account on their 2007 tax return was willful, and that Peter's failure to disclose the Finter account on their 2008 tax return also was willful. Therefore,\n      the Government's motion will be granted and Defendants' denied with regard to the penalties for 2007 and those assessed against Peter for 2008.\n      </p>\n      <p id=\"p-10\">\n       But, as noted, in October 2008, Peter transferred the funds out of their joint Swiss bank account into a Swiss bank account in his name only at Finter Bank. Despite the undisputed evidence that the parties intended for Susan to be a holder on that account as well, and that they added her to the account in 2009, Susan was not an account holder on the Finter account in 2008. Nor has the Government shown that she had any financial interest in or authority over the Finter account in 2008. Therefore, she had no obligation to disclose the Finter account, and FBAR penalties against her for 2008 are not appropriate.\n       <footnotemark>\n        2\n       </footnotemark>\n       Accordingly, Susan's individual motion for partial summary judgment on this claim regarding 2008 penalties is granted, and the Government's motion with regard to 2008 penalties against Susan will be denied.\n      </p>\n      <p id=\"p-12\">\n       Individuals who pay taxes to the United States must \"report annually to the Internal Revenue Service ('IRS') any financial interests they have in any bank, securities, or other financial accounts in a foreign country.\"\n       <em>\n        United States v.

This would have been a logical approach, given that before October 2008 and after October 2009, these were joint funds but Susan was not a Finter account owner in 2008.

It also is undisputed that the tax returns included a question of whether they had foreign accounts, followed by a cross-reference to \"exceptions and filing requirements for Form TD F 90-22.1 [FBAR].\" Because \"[a] taxpayer who signs a tax return will not be heard to claim innocence for not having actually read the return, as he or she is charged with constructive knowledge of its contents, [their] signature[s] [are] prima facie evidence that [they] knew the contents of the return,\" including the foreign accounts question and the cross-reference to \"filing requirements, which put them \"on inquiry notice of the FBAR requirement.\"\n       <em>\n        See\n       </em>\n       <em>\n        Williams II\n       </em>\n       , 489 Fed App'x at 659 (quoting\n       <em>\n        Greer,\n       </em>\n       <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4215922\" index=\"121\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/595/338/\">\n        595 F.3d at\n       </extracted-citation>\n       347 n.4 ).\n      </p>\n      <p id=\"p-105\">\n       The Horowitzes argue that their friends told them they did not need to pay taxes on the interest in their foreign accounts. Maybe so, but their friends' credentials are not before the Court, nor is there any information from which I could assess whether it was reasonable for them to have accepted what their friends told them as legally correct. And, in any event, their friends' views would not override the clear instructions on Schedule B, which, as noted, requires a \"Yes\" answer if the taxpayer has an interest in a foreign account, regardless of whether the funds within it constituted taxable income. Moreover, the fact that the Horowitzes discussed their tax liabilities for their foreign accounts with their friends demonstrates their awareness that the income could be taxable. Their failure to have the same conversation with the accountants they entrusted with their taxes for years, notwithstanding the requirement that taxpayers with foreign accounts complete Part III of Schedule B, easily shows \"a conscious effort to avoid learning about reporting requirements.\"\n       <em>\n        Williams II\n       </em>\n       , 489 Fed. App'x at 658 (quoting\n       <em>\n        Sturman,\n       </em>\n       <extracted-citation case-ids=\"10528880\" index=\"122\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/951/1466/#p1476\">\n        951 F.2d at\n       </extracted-citation>\n       1476 ). On these facts, willful blindness may be inferred.\n       <em>\n        See\n       </em>\n       <em>\n        Poole,\n       </em>\n       <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4203484\" index=\"123\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/640/114/#p122\">\n        640 F.3d at 122\n       </extracted-citation>\n       (\"[I]n a criminal tax prosecution, when the evidence supports an inference that a defendant was subjectively aware of a high probability of the existence of a tax liability, and purposefully avoided learning the facts pointing to such liability, the trier of fact may find that the defendant exhibited 'willful blindness' satisfying the scienter requirement of knowledge.\" (quoted in\n       <em>\n        Williams II\n       </em>\n       in the context of civil liability) ). Thus, even without the additional evidence that was present in\n       <em>\n        Williams II\n       </em>\n       , I find based on these undisputed facts that the Horowitzes recklessly disregarded the FBAR filing requirement.\n       <em>\n        See\n       </em>\n       <em>\n        Williams II\n       </em>\n       , 489 Fed App'x at 659.
