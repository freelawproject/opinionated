Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 1-2, ECF No. 1. Plaintiff Second Amendment Foundation, Inc. (SAF), which has over 650,000 members and supporters across the nation, brings suit on behalf of its members, including Plaintiff Drummond.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 3. Plaintiffs allege that Defendants, Robinson Township and Zoning Officer Mark Dorsey, infringed Plaintiffs' Second Amendment right to keep and bear arms and Fourteenth Amendment rights to equal protection, property, and livelihood by deliberately stalling Plaintiff Drummond's zoning application in order \"to zone the [Greater Pittsburgh Gun Club] out of existence.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 1.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   Counts I and II of the Complaint allege that Sections 601 and 311(D), respectively, of the Robinson Township Zoning Ordinance, facially and as applied to Plaintiffs and their customers and members, deprive Plaintiffs and their customers and members of their Second Amendment right.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 65. Similarly, Count III alleges that Table 208A of the Zoning Ordinance, as applied to Plaintiffs and their customers and members, deprives them of their Second Amendment right.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 70. Counts IV and Count VI allege that Section 601, facially and as applied to Plaintiffs Drummond and GPGC LLC, violates the Fourteenth Amendment rights to equal protection and to the pursuit of livelihood, respectively.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6\u00b6 73, 79. Finally, Count V alleges that Defendants' course of conduct deprived Plaintiff Drummond of his property interest, thereby violating the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6\u00b6 75-76. Plaintiffs request an order permanently enjoining the enforcement of the challenged ordinances and commanding Defendants to issue Plaintiff Drummond all permits necessary for the operation of the Gun Club.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 20. Plaintiffs also request an award of compensatory damages to Plaintiffs Drummond and GPGC LLC, declaratory relief consistent with the permanent injunctions, costs of suit, and attorney fees.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   Additionally, Plaintiffs seek a preliminary injunction in this matter. ECF No. 17. Plaintiffs request that the Court enjoin Defendants from enforcing Robinson Township Zoning Ordinance Table 208A and Sections 311(D) and 601 against Plaintiffs' operation and enjoyment of the Gun Club.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Plaintiffs also request that the Court command Defendants to issue all permits necessary for the operation of the Gun Club, to which Plaintiff Drummond alleges he would be entitled absent the Defendant Township's adoption of the aforementioned Zoning Ordinance Table and Sections.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   Defendants seek dismissal of the Complaint, ECF No. 26, first arguing that\n   Plaintiffs' claims are not ripe. Defs.' Br. 6-8, ECF No. 27. Second, Defendants challenge Counts I and II, as they pertain to Plaintiffs' customers and members, arguing that Plaintiffs failed to properly plead derivative standing.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 8-13. Lastly, Defendants ask the Court to dismiss all counts of the Complaint for failure to state a claim upon which relief can be granted.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 13-20.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   For the following reasons, Defendants' Motion to Dismiss will be granted and Plaintiffs' Motion for Preliminary Injunction will be denied as moot.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   <strong>\n    I. Background\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   A. Ownership and operation of gun clubs on the King Road property\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   According to the Complaint, the property at issue, 920 King Road, Bulger, Pennsylvania 15019, consists of 265 acres in a \"substantially rural\" area. Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 11,13, ECF No. 1. In 1967, the property became the site of a gun club called the Greater Pittsburgh Trap &amp; Skeet Club.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 11. At that time, the property was zoned as \"A-1.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   The gun club, described by Plaintiffs as \"operat[ing] as much as any ordinary commercial shooting range,\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 14, engaged in commercial activities such as renting guns to patrons and selling \"memberships, range time, firearms, ammunition, targets, food and beverage, and other ordinary goods that might be found at any gun range, as well as shooting training and safety courses.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 15. Ownership of the gun club changed hands at various points before the gun club ultimately ceased operations in 2008.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6\u00b6 17, 20.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   Eight years later, in 2016, Iron City Armory, LLC leased the King Road property with plans to open a new gun club.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 21. When Iron City Armory entered the lease, the property was zoned as an Interchange Business Development District, or IBD District.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 23. \"Sportsman's Clubs,\" an undefined term at that time, were permitted principal uses within IBD districts.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 12. In 2016, Iron City Armory submitted a zoning application to the Defendant Township.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 22. The Defendant Township approved the application and issued a permit, which allowed Iron City Armory to operate a gun club on the property.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   However, the permit was issued with restrictions; namely it prohibited \"sales, gun testing, rentals, [and] other commercial endeavors,\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   In December 2017, Iron City Armory announced that it would cease operations the following month and that it would default on its lease.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 29. Plaintiff Drummond, a citizen of North Carolina, then entered into a ten-year lease of the King Road property with the intention of operating the Greater Pittsburgh Gun Club (referred to hereinafter as \"the Gun Club\") through GPGC LLC, an entity wholly owned by Plaintiff Drummond.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6\u00b6 30-31. Plaintiff Drummond, through GPGC LLC, planned to run the Gun Club much as the pre-2008 gun club had been, by engaging in commercial shooting range activities.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 31. Plaintiff Drummond took possession of the King Road property in or around January 2018.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 32.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   B. Past legal action involving the King Road property\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   According to the Complaint, and supported by attached exhibits, there have been two prior legal challenges related to the operation of a gun club on the King Road property. First, in 1993, a nuisance action was filed in state court by the Defendant Township.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 18. In that action, the Township sought relief related to \"the discharge of automatic weapons ...; the club's hours of operation; and projectiles leaving the premises and striking nearby properties.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Additionally, the Township admitted in its complaint that\n   the gun club's operation was lawful under the then-existing Robinson Township Zoning Ordinance, wherein the property was zoned as A-1.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   Compl. Ex. A, \u00b6 3, ECF No. 1-2. The state court dismissed the case in 1997, nearly four years after it was filed, finding that the gun club did not constitute a nuisance. Compl. \u00b6 19, ECF No. 1. That gun club entity ceased operations in 2008.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 20.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   When Iron City Armory opened its gun club in 2016, neighbors of the King Road property appealed the Defendant Township's issuance of the permit to the Zoning Hearing Board.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 23. The Board granted the appeal, reasoning that \"shooting ranges\" and \"shooting range facilities\" were not permitted uses in IBD districts.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   During the pendency of the appeal, the Township received complaints that Iron City Armory's gun club \"was engaging in forbidden commercial activity by selling bottled water, targets, and ammunition to its members.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 24. In response, the Township served Iron City Armory with a \"Notice of Violation/Cease and Desist Order.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Additionally, an undercover police operation confirmed the gun club's sale of targets and ammunition, resulting in a second cease and desist order.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   The Zoning Hearing Board ultimately revoked Iron City Armory's permit, which Iron City Armory appealed.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 25. The Zoning Hearing Board denied the appeal, finding that Iron City Armory had violated the conditions of the issued permit.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   Iron City Armory appealed the Zoning Hearing Board's decisions to the Court of Common Pleas.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 26. In that appeal, the Zoning Hearing Board admitted that the relevant ordinance \"could be read to permit non-commercial gun clubs and shooting ranges in IBD districts.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 27. Regarding the permit revocation, the court determined that selling bottled water and targets fell \"into permissible commercial operations of a gun club and do not violate the restriction\" and that the ammunition sales were de minimis.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 28. Although Iron City Armory prevailed in the appeal, the court cautioned Iron City Armory against selling ammunition in the future, because doing so might run afoul of the permit restrictions.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6\u00b6 26, 28.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   C. Plaintiff Drummond's 2018 zoning application\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   When Plaintiff Drummond leased the property, with plans to open his own gun club, in January 2018, the King Road property was still zoned as an IBD district.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 12. Plaintiff Drummond alleges that, in January 2018, he approached Defendant Mark Dorsey, Robinson Township Zoning Officer, and informed him of his plans for the property.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 33. Plaintiff Drummond asked Defendant Dorsey about what he needed to do for Plaintiffs Drummond and GPGC LLC to open and operate the Gun Club.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   On Defendant Dorsey's advice, Plaintiff Drummond wrote and sent a detailed description of his plans for the Gun Club and the King Road property to Defendant Dorsey.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6\u00b6 33-34. Defendant Dorsey did not respond to Plaintiff Drummond, despite \"numerous follow-up phone calls.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 34.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   Plaintiffs further allege that on February 12, 2018, a neighbor, who had been involved in the previous nuisance action, attended a Robinson Township Board of Supervisors' meeting, where she \"sought expedited action on restrictive zoning amendments targeting the Gun Club.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 35. Defendant Dorsey and Township Manager Crystal Brown also were in attendance.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   No one advised Plaintiff Drummond that the King Road property would be discussed at that meeting.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Four days after the meeting, Plaintiff Drummond contacted Defendant Dorsey.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 36. Defendant Dorsey informed Plaintiff Drummond that he needed to submit\n   additional information and that they would have to meet.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Plaintiff Drummond informed Defendant Dorsey that he had already provided all of the information about his plans for the King Road property.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Defendant Dorsey then told Plaintiff Drummond, for the first time, that he would need to submit a zoning application.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Defendant Dorsey also told Plaintiff Drummond that he did not need to immediately submit the application, as he could file it when they met in person.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Plaintiff Drummond emailed Defendant Dorsey later that day, seeking to clarify which form he needed to submit.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Defendant Dorsey did not respond to Plaintiff Drummond's email.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   On February 19, 2018, the Board of Supervisors met again \"for the apparent purpose of considering restrictive zoning to preclude the Gun Club's operation.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 37. Again, no one informed Plaintiff Drummond of this meeting, but neighbors, who had been involved in the previous legal actions, were present and spoke at the meeting.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Defendant Dorsey and Township Manager Brown were also present at the meeting.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Also on February 19, 2018, Plaintiff Drummond wrote to Defendant Dorsey to advise that they could meet on February 22, 2018.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 38. Plaintiff Drummond also indicated that he wanted to submit the required paperwork \"without further delay.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Defendant Dorsey did not respond to Plaintiff Drummond.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Plaintiff Drummond eventually reached Defendant Dorsey by telephone on March 1, 2018, and they arranged to meet, along with Township Manager Brown, on March 15, 2018.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 39. Defendant Dorsey also requested more information about the Gun Club, which Plaintiff Drummond provided by email on March 7, 2018.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Defendant Dorsey did not respond to this email.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   At the March 15, 2018 meeting, Defendant Dorsey and Township Manager Brown instructed Plaintiff Drummond to fill out a zoning application.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 40. Plaintiff Drummond did so, and Brown and Defendant Dorsey accepted it.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Neither Brown nor Defendant Dorsey mentioned the pending zoning ordinance that would preclude Drummond's application.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   On March 19, 2018, as Plaintiff Drummond was driving back to North Carolina, a neighbor of the King Road property texted him, informing him about a notice posted on King Road.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 41. The notice advised of an upcoming Special Meeting of the Board of Supervisors, which was scheduled for March 22, 2018.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   The notice specified that the Special Meeting would address a zoning measure related to the Gun Club.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Plaintiffs allege that Defendant Dorsey and Township Manager Brown knew about the scheduled meeting, \"but chose to conceal\" it during their March 15, 2018 meeting with Plaintiff Drummond.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 42. Plaintiffs further allege that Brown and Defendant Dorsey did this because they \"knew ... that the Township was plotting to adopt a zoning measure that would preclude Drummond's operation of the Gun Club ... and that Drummond's efforts were being 'slow-rolled' so that he would be kept in the dark until the law had been changed.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   Plaintiff Drummond attended the March 22, 2018 Special Meeting, where he spoke in opposition to the proposed zoning amendments.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 43. The Board of Supervisors tabled the proposed amendments.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   That night and over the following days and weeks, Plaintiff Drummond reached out to Defendant Dorsey and to the Township's Commissioners in an effort to confirm the status of his application and to offer to discuss any questions or concerns the Township might have about his plans.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 45. Neither Defendant Dorsey nor the Commissioners responded to Plaintiff Drummond.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Further, no one informed Plaintiff Drummond that the proposed\n   zoning amendment was on the Board of Supervisor's agenda for their April 9, 2018 meeting.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 46.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   At the April 9, 2018 meeting, the Defendant Township enacted the proposed amendments, as discussed below.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 47. On April 16, 2018, Plaintiff Drummond went to the Robinson Township Municipal Building, where he learned about the Defendant Township's enactment of the amendment.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 52. Plaintiff Drummond immediately contacted Defendant Dorsey to inquire about the amendments and the status of his zoning application.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Defendant Dorsey responded, providing copies of a letter he mailed on April 13, 2018 to inform Plaintiff Drummond that his application had been rejected.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 53. The letter stated that the zoning application had been rejected because Plaintiff Drummond's plans for the Gun Club did not comply with the zoning amendments that were pending when Plaintiff Drummond submitted his application.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   The following day, on April 17, 2018, Plaintiff Drummond sought information about how he might still get permission to operate the Gun Club, but Defendant Dorsey did not respond.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 54.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   According to Defendants' Brief in Support of the Motion to Dismiss, Plaintiff Drummond did not appeal the denial of his application to the Robinson Township Zoning Hearing Board. Defs.' Br. 4, ECF No. 27. Plaintiff Drummond instead appealed the Defendant Township's denial of his application to the Washington County Court of Common Pleas in May 2018.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Plaintiff Drummond ultimately voluntarily dismissed his state court land use appeal, whereupon he filed this suit in August 2018.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   D. Defendant Township's zoning amendments\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   In the ordinance, enacted on April 9, 2018, the Defendant Township stated that it sought to regulate Sportsman's Clubs \"in an effort to avoid nuisances and provide for and protect the public health, safety and welfare for the residents within the geographic limits of the Township.\" Defs.' Br. Ex. C, at 1, ECF No. 27-3. The ordinance amended the Robinson Township Zoning Ordinance in three ways. Compl. \u00b6 47, ECF No. 1. First, the ordinance amended Section 601 to include a definition for \"Sportsman's Club,\" a term that had been previously undefined.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Under the new definition, a \"Sportsman's Club\" is \"[a] nonprofit entity formed for conservation of wildlife or game, and to provide members with opportunities for hunting, fishing or shooting.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Plaintiffs allege that by limiting the activities permitted at Sportsman's Clubs to nonprofit uses, the Defendant Township has barred Plaintiffs' operation of the Gun Club.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 50.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   Next, Section 311 of the Zoning Ordinance was amended to include paragraph D; this new paragraph provides that \"[o]utdoor shooting activities shall be limited to pistol range, skeet shoot, trap and skeet, and rim-fire rifles.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 47. According to the Complaint, this created a prohibition on center-fire rifles at Sportsman's Clubs, which \"has significantly frustrated if not effectively barred the use of the historic King Road Gun Club property as a gun club or shooting range.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 51.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   Lastly, the ordinance amended Table 208A, which is a table of allowed uses in IBD districts.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 47. Under the ordinance, Sportsman's Clubs were changed from Permitted Use to Conditional Use.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Plaintiffs also allege that under the Robinson Township Zoning Ordinance, commercial outdoor shooting ranges are not permitted uses or conditional uses in IBD districts.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 48. Plaintiffs further allege that there is no mechanism under the Zoning Ordinance \"by which anyone\n   might be allowed to operate a for-profit gun club or shooting range within an IBD district, or shoot center-fire rifles at a 'Sportsman's Club.' \"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 49.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   <strong>\n    II. Motion to Dismiss\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   In deciding a motion to dismiss a complaint under Rule 12(b)(6), a court must first \"accept all factual allegations as true\" and \"construe the complaint in the light most favorable to the plaintiff.\"\n   <em>\n    Eid v.

Likewise, by limiting the types of activities that may occur at Sportsman's Clubs, Section 311(D) regulates the manner in which persons may maintain proficiency in firearm use in IBD districts. These ordinances are time, place, or manner regulations. Accordingly, the determination of whether any burden imposed is substantial is based on whether adequate alternatives exist.

Moreover, Plaintiffs plead that commercial outdoor shooting ranges are allowed in other zones in the Township,\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 48, and this fact supports the existence of adequate alternatives. Because Plaintiffs fail to allege a lack of adequate alternatives, Plaintiffs fail to plead that the burdens imposed by the regulations in Sections 311(D) and 601 are substantial. Plaintiffs thus fail to sufficiently allege that the challenged ordinances are within the scope of the Second Amendment.

The overall purpose of the Defendant Township's zoning scheme \"is to establish zoning districts where compatible uses of land may be located.\" Robinson Twp. Zoning Ordinance \u00a7 200. The Zoning Ordinance groups allowed uses into various zones by means of several criteria, including intensity, meaning, the level of impact that certain uses may have on neighboring properties.\n   <em>\n    See id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00a7\u00a7 202-09.

The Zoning Ordinance explains that a distinguishing characteristic of intensive commercial recreation is \"the intense level of impacts, such as noise from ... gun fire.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   It appears, then, that the commercial nature of a shooting range is related to the intensity of land use and the impact that such use may have on neighboring properties.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   Thus, the profit-nonprofit distinction in Section 601 that Plaintiffs challenge here is a land use classification rather than simply an economic one.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-70\">\n   Second, having already determined that Plaintiffs' Second Amendment claims fail, the appropriate level of scrutiny for analyzing the land use classification in Section 601 is rational basis review.

Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 33-34, 55, 75, ECF No. 1; Pls.' Br. 21, ECF No. 31.

Br. 21, ECF No. 31. According to Plaintiffs, the property interest in operating the Gun Club as a commercial shooting range \"inhered in decades of the Club's lawful operation.\" Pls.' Br. 21, ECF No. 31. Additionally, Plaintiffs claim that their plans for a commercial shooting range constituted a lawful use under the Zoning Ordinance prior to the February 2018 proposed amendment. Compl. \u00b6 55, ECF No. 1. It is not entirely clear, but in the Complaint and subsequent filings in this case, Plaintiffs' assertions regarding their right to use the King Road property for commercial gun range purposes prior to the zoning amendment may not be correct. First, the facts indicate that how the King Road property was initially used is irrelevant to the current case. The first gun club operated as a commercial gun club from 1967 to 2008, during which time the property was zoned as A-1.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6\u00b6 11, 14-15. In the nuisance litigation in the mid-1990s, Robinson Township agreed that the gun club was a lawful use in the A-1 zone.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 18. However, the property then ceased to be used as a gun club of any type, nonprofit or for-profit, from 2008 until 2016-a period of eight years.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6\u00b6 20-21. Based on the zoning scheme in place in 2016 when Iron City Armory sought approval to open a new gun club, it appears that the property was re-zoned to an IBD district at some point prior to 2016.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 23. Additionally, in this second gun club, Iron City Armory operated on a non-commercial basis, as evidenced by the permit restrictions that were the subject of the 2016 litigation in the Washington County Court of Common Pleas.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6\u00b6 22, 24-25, 27-28. The lengthy cessation of commercial shooting range activities, combined with the fact that the property was rezoned to an IBD district-wherein Iron City Armory's gun club was only allowed to operate on a non-commercial basis-points to the conclusion that any right that may have inhered in the operation of the first gun club was subsequently lost.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-80\">\n   Second, the current Robinson Township Zoning Ordinance, relevant to the present litigation, distinguishes between commercial shooting ranges and Sportsman's Clubs beyond the provisions Plaintiffs challenge in their Complaint. Plaintiffs, by their own admission, recognize this.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 48; Pls. Br. 20, ECF No. 31. A closer look at the definition of \"Commercial Recreation, Intensive,\" in Section 602 of the Zoning Ordinance, points to the conclusion that even prior to the February 2018 proposed amendment, Sportsman's Clubs could not be operated on a commercial basis. According to this definition, which Plaintiffs do not challenge, intensive commercial recreation includes \"outdoor commercial shooting ranges,\" but excludes \"shooting ranges owned by or operated by any non-profit conservation organization or sportsman's organization, any noncommercial target shooting conducted private or public land, or any traditional hunting activities carried out with Pennsylvania Game Commission regulations.\" Robinson\n   Twp. Zoning Ordinance \u00a7 602. In sum, the Zoning Ordinance appears to categorize Sportsman's Clubs among other nonprofit or non-commercial uses, and perhaps did so prior to the February 2018 proposed amendment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-81\">\n   The foregoing facts signal to the Court that Plaintiff Drummond's plans for the King Road property may not have been allowed to begin with-meaning that the property interest of which Plaintiffs claim they have been deprived may not exist at all. However, not only is this not entirely clear at this juncture based on the facts alleged, but Defendants do not make this argument. Because Plaintiffs allege a legal right existed, Defendants do not dispute this, and further factual development is needed, the Court assumes for the sake of argument regarding the substantive due process claim that a right exists.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-82\">\n   Defendants next argue that even if the Complaint contained an adequately pleaded legal right, Defendant Dorsey's conduct at issue in this case does not shock the conscience.

Pls.' Br. 21-22, ECF No. 31. However, nuisance actions are very fact-specific, and facts can change significantly over the course of twenty years. For example, at the time of the 1997 nuisance decision, the King Road property was zoned as an A-1 district. Compl. \u00b6 11, ECF No. 1. Subsequently, the property was re-zoned to be an IBD district, in which commercial shooting ranges are not allowed, sometime before the 2016 litigation involving Iron City Armory.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    <em>\n     id.\n    </em>\n    at \u00b6 23. Based on the fact-driven nature of nuisance actions and the passage of time, the Court finds that the prior nuisance action is not persuasive or controlling upon the instant case.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"5\">\n   <p id=\"p-96\">\n    Plaintiffs also assert that Defendants \"acted in derogation of the considered judgment of the Court of Common Pleas in the previous nuisance action,\" referring to the nuisance suit filed in 1993 and decided in 1997. Compl. \u00b6 75, ECF No. 1. For reasons discussed above in footnote 4 regarding Plaintiffs' equal protection claim, the Court finds the previous nuisance action to be irrelevant to the current suit.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n </opinion>\n</casebody>\n"
