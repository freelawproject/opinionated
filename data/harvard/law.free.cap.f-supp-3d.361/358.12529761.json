And the two years of processing in the plaintiff's case included review by the NYCERS Medical Board, an appeal, further review by Medical Board, and then a denial letter issued by NYCERS. The plaintiff fails to allege sufficient facts showing why, in her case, two years is an unacceptably long processing time.

Those four allegations therefore do not support the plaintiff's procedural due process claim and there is a procedural mechanism to consider those claims, namely a CPLR Article 78 proceeding. Indeed, the plaintiff brings a CPLR Article 78 claim in this Court to address the denial of benefits that these claimed procedural deficiencies allegedly caused.\n   <footnotemark>\n    12\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-79\">\n   Moreover, as pleaded, the plaintiff's remaining allegations - NYCERS' unduly high denial rates and long processing times, and the two-year processing time in the plaintiff's case - are insufficient to support the plaintiff's procedural due process claim. However, those allegations may support a procedural due process claim if pleaded less summarily.
