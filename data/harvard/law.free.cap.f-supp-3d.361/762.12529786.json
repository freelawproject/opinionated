Phillips, SENIOR UNITED STATES DISTRICT JUDGE\n  </author>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   Plaintiff Paula E. Babb worked as a Certified Registered Nurse Anesthetist (\"CRNA\") for defendant Maryville Anesthesiologists, P.C. (\"Maryville Anesthesiologists\"), a medical practice group that provides anesthesiology services to Blount Memorial Hospital (the \"Hospital\") in Blount County, Tennessee. Plaintiff claims that Maryville Anesthesiologists regarded her as disabled due to a vision impairment and terminated her in violation of the Americans with Disabilities Act (\"ADA\"),\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%2012101\">\n    42 U.S.C. \u00a7 12101\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2009). The defendant claims that plaintiff was terminated for legitimate non-discriminatory reasons, namely, that she made serious clinical errors such that she could not provide safe and appropriate patient care.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   Maryville Anesthesiologists has filed a motion for summary judgment [Doc. 14], with supporting briefs and materials [Docs. 15, 18, 19, 26], and plaintiff has responded in opposition [Doc. 24]. For the reasons set forth herein, the defendant's motion [Doc. 14] will be\n   <strong>\n    GRANTED\n   </strong>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   <strong>\n    I. Relevant Facts\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   Maryville Anesthesiologists provides anesthesiology services to the Hospital in operating rooms and ambulatory surgery centers [Doc. 15-11 at \u00b6 3]. Plaintiff began working as a CRNA with Maryville Anesthesiologists around June 2, 2015 [Doc. 15-1 at p. 6].\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   CRNAs with Maryville Anesthesiologists perform a variety of critical duties including: conducting pre-anesthesia assessments; administering pre-anesthetic medication; administering general and regional anesthesia ; performing sedation techniques; conducting invasive and non-invasive monitoring of patient conditions such as heart rate, pulse, heart rhythm, and oxygen; administering airway management techniques, such as intubation and managing ventilation while the patient is paralyzed; monitoring fluid, electrolyte and acid-base levels; monitoring blood loss and pressures; providing acute and chronic pain therapy; and providing post-anesthesia care [Doc. 15-1 at pp. 2-5]. CRNAs perform many of these tasks independently and exercise discretion in performing many of these tasks [\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at p. 5].\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   Within a few weeks of plaintiff's employment with Maryville Anesthesiologists, Dr. Cheryl Coleman, one of the group's physician-owners, observed plaintiff placing her face very close to a computer screen when looking at it [Doc. 15-4 at \u00b6\u00b6 2-3]. Dr. Coleman mentioned her observation and plaintiff responded by stating that she had a degenerative retinal condition and that she would be blind in ten years [\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 3].\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   Dr. Coleman asked plaintiff to \"let us know when she reached the point that she could not function\" [\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ]. Dr. Coleman reported her concern and her conversation with plaintiff to Dr. Candace Robertson, who was then the chair of the personnel committee for Maryville Anesthesiologists [Doc. 15-2 at p. 22]. Dr. Robertson thereafter monitored plaintiff more closely when she was placing a patient under anesthesia or bringing a patient out of anesthesia [\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at p. 23].\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   In late October 2015, two other physicians reported concerns about plaintiff's performance to Dr. Robertson. On October\n   25, 2015, Dr. Gaelan Luhn sent an e-mail to Dr. Robertson describing a comment from plaintiff that she could not read a record of a patient's anesthesia history - \"I can't read that\" [Doc. 15-11 at \u00b6 5, p. 4]. Dr. Luhn did not follow up on plaintiff's comment because the morning surgery schedule was very busy [\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ].\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   On October 28, 2015, Dr. Daniela Apostoaei sent a memo to Dr. Robertson describing two occasions when plaintiff responded to questions about whether pre-operative blood results were within normal limits by stating, \"I cannot see that\" [Doc. 15-11 at \u00b6 6, p. 5]. Dr. Apostoaei was concerned that plaintiff \"did not take any further necessary steps to ensure that those blood work results where [sic] acceptable before proceeding with surgery\" [Doc. 15-11 at p. 5]. Dr. Apostoaei also advised that two nurses reported that plaintiff \"does not appear to see the monitor to document the vitals\" [\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ].\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   Plaintiff admits that she was unable to read the patient record, but she claims that Dr. Apostoaei asked her for the exact readings from the blood work, not simply whether the results were within normal limits [Doc. 24-3 at \u00b6 14]. According to plaintiff, she responded that she did not recall the exact number, not that she could not see it. She further claims she had already confirmed the blood work results were within an acceptable range before proceeding with surgery [\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ].\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   On October 30, 2015, Dr. Robertson and another physician, Dr. Wilma Proffitt, met with plaintiff and described the concerns that had been expressed regarding her ability to read records and monitors [Doc. 15-11 at \u00b6 7]. They emphasized that these issues - reading records and monitors - impacted patient care and safety [Doc. 15-11 at p. 6]. Plaintiff responded that she felt her vision was stable and that she could perform her job duties [\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ]. She commented that she had known about her eye condition for about ten years and that she was followed by an ophthalmologist in Chattanooga [\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ]. Plaintiff also stated that she had disability insurance [Doc. 15-11 at p. 6]. The doctors instructed plaintiff to ask for help with any record she could not read [\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ]. Drs. Robertson and Proffitt asked plaintiff to follow up with her ophthalmologist and provide them with \"an objective assessment of her vision,\" which she agreed to do [Doc. 15-11 at p. 6].\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   However, plaintiff never provided her employer with a report from her ophthalmologist or any other treatment provider [Doc. 24-1 at pp. 64-65].\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   Several CRNAs testified that it was \"common knowledge\" that plaintiff had issues with her vision [Doc. 15-3 at \u00b6 7; Doc. 15-5 at \u00b6 3; Doc. 15-13 at \u00b6 3]. There is evidence that other CRNAs and Hospital staff expressed concerns over plaintiff's ability to read monitors and patient records and some of those concerns were relayed to the physicians [Doc. 15-6 at \u00b6 3; Doc. 15-10 at \u00b6\u00b6 7-8; Doc. 15-12 at \u00b6 4]. Two of the Hospital's surgeons requested that plaintiff not work in their operating room due to concerns about her vision [Doc. 15-2 at p. 30].\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   On January 2, 2016, Dr. Proffitt sent Dr. Robertson an e-mail describing concerns from operating room staff that plaintiff could not see and read the monitors [Doc. 15-11 at \u00b6 9, p. 7]. Dr. Proffitt also described an incident involving a patient on a\n   fracture table in which the patient began to wake up too soon and moved, thus almost causing the patient to fall from the table [Doc. 15-10 at \u00b6\u00b6 4-5; Doc. 15-11 at \u00b6 10, p. 7]. A fracture table is thin, narrow operating table that allows the surgeon to stand very close to the affected area [Doc. 15-11 at \u00b6 10]. Because the fracture table is so thin, safety protocols require that the patient remain asleep until transferred off of the table [Doc. 15-11 at \u00b6 10]. Plaintiff admits that the patient in question did move; fortunately, other staff members reacted and prevented the patient from falling [Doc. 15-10 at \u00b6 4]. Registered Nurse Charles Price reported this incident to Dr. Proffitt in late December 2015 [Doc. 19-1 at \u00b6 7; Doc. 19-2 at \u00b6 3].\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   On January 5, 2016, Dr. Luhn related to Dr. Robertson an incident in which plaintiff had not adequately sedated a patient prior to a robotic surgery [Doc. 15-11 at \u00b6 11, p. 8]. Another CRNA, Lisa Green, entered the robotic surgery room to give plaintiff a break [Doc. 15-7 at \u00b6\u00b6 6-7]. Ms. Green became very concerned when she observed that the patient had four twitches, or movements, and she \"dosed the patient right away\" [\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 7]. A patient having robotic surgery should have zero twitches; four twitches is the highest level that CRNAs measure [Doc. 15-7 at \u00b6 5].\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   It is very dangerous for a patient to not be adequately relaxed before a robotic surgery because the robot is rigid and does not move [Doc. 15-7 at \u00b6 4; Doc. 15-11 at \u00b6 12]. If a patient moves during a robotic procedure, the patient can be seriously injured [\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ]. Ms. Green reported to Dr. Luhn, the free anesthesiologist on duty that day, that the patient had four twitches [Doc. 15-7 at \u00b6 8; Doc. 15-9 at \u00b6 3]. When Dr. Luhn entered the room an hour later, he observed that the patient again had four twitches, thus the paralytic agent had begun to wear off [Doc. 15-9 at \u00b6 3]. Dr. Luhn brought this to plaintiff's attention and she responded that there are different ways of doing things [Doc. 15-9 at \u00b6 3].\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   On January 8, 2016, Dr. Apostoaei reported to Dr. Robertson that plaintiff wrote the wrong dosage of medicine on a patient record [Doc. 15-11 at \u00b6 13, p. 9]. A nurse caught the error and corrected it [Doc. 15-11 at p. 9]. Plaintiff admits this error [Doc. 15-1 at pp. 13-14].\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   At the January 13, 2016 monthly meeting of the physician-owners, those present discussed the recent surgical incidents involving plaintiff and the issues with her sight reported from Hospital employees [Doc. 15-11 at \u00b6 15]. Dr. Luhn described the robotic surgery incident and the physicians discussed the comments from operating room staff regarding plaintiff's inability\n   to see monitors or read records [\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ]. The physician-owners who were not present were called and informed of the concerns [\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ]. Because of plaintiff's clinical errors, particularly the two surgical incidents, the physician-owners concluded that plaintiff could not provide safe and appropriate patient care and they voted unanimously to discharge plaintiff [\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ]. Dr. Robertson opines that clinical errors, such as bringing someone out of anesthesia too soon or failing to ensure a patient is fully relaxed during a robotic surgery, are different than having difficulty reading records or information on a monitor [Doc. 15-11 at \u00b6 14]. Clinical errors demonstrate a lack of clinical knowledge or judgment or both [\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ].\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   On January 14, 2016, Drs. Luhn and Shivers met with plaintiff and told her that Maryville Anesthesiologists was ending her employment [Doc. 15-1 at pp. 13-15]. When plaintiff asked why, Dr. Luhn referenced the fracture table and robotic surgery incidents, as well as her charting of the wrong dose of morphine [\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ]. Plaintiff asked them to reconsider the decision and Dr. Luhn stated that he would speak to the other physicians again [\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at p. 14]. On January 18, 2016, plaintiff e-mailed Dr. Robertson and inquired about her employment status [Doc. 15-14]. Dr. Robertson confirmed that plaintiff's last day of employment was January 14 and that the fracture table and robotic surgery incidents were the reasons for her termination [\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ].\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   On January 14, 2016, Dr. Proffitt instructed Crystal Aycocke, a CRNA who assisted the group with scheduling, to notify the other CRNAs that plaintiff was no longer employed with Maryville Anesthesiologists and the other CRNAs would have to cover additional shifts due to her departure [Doc. 15-3 at \u00b6\u00b6 4-5]. Neither Dr. Proffitt nor any other physician told Ms. Aycocke the reason why plaintiff was no longer employed [Doc. 15-3 at \u00b6 5, 10]. That evening, Ms. Aycocke sent the following e-mail to the other CRNAs:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-25\">\n   As most of you know, Paula has been having major issues with her eyesight and as of late, it has seemed to be getting even worse. We have had numerous complaints from OR staff regarding her inability to read the monitor, etc. Over the past several months the group has given her several opportunities to provide documentation from her eye specialist saying that she was safe to practice. She was unable to provide this documentation. This, in addition to a few other issues, has forced the group to make a very difficult decision. As of today, she is longer with our group. Sorry to be the bearer of bad news. This was one of the reasons that our meeting was postponed. See you all tomorrow.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   [Doc. 15-3 at p. 2]. Ms. Aycocke drafted the e-mail based on her own opinion without input from the physicians or any pre-approval [Doc. 15-3 at \u00b6\u00b6 6, 10-11].\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   The record contains evidence that Maryville Anesthesiologists has discharged two other CRNAs who, in their opinion, lacked the clinical skills necessary for the job [Doc. 15-8 at \u00b6 3; Doc. 15-11 at \u00b6\u00b6 17-18]. Neither Camille Fritz nor David Kinlaw were given warnings or other progressive discipline prior to their terminations [\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ]. Dr. Robertson stated that the practice does not utilize progressive corrective action when a CRNA displays a lack of clinical skills or judgment because the CRNAs must function independently [Doc. 15-11 at \u00b6 19]. If they cannot do so safely, they create a risk for patients in a very vulnerable position [\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ].\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   <strong>\n    II. Plaintiff's Expert Report\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   In support of her opposition to summary judgment, plaintiff has filed the Declaration and Expert Report of Jennifer W.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   Hultz [Doc. 24-8], a CRNA who has opined on plaintiff's actions in the two contested surgical cases and whether her actions complied with the appropriate standard of care for CRNAs. In the reply brief, Maryville Anesthesiologists argues that Ms. Hultz's expert report should be excluded in considering the motion for summary judgment [Doc. 26 at pp. 5-8]. Defendant does not challenge Ms. Hultz's qualifications to provide expert testimony. Instead, defendant argues that the testimony is not helpful or necessary for the jury to understand the facts and that the testimony regarding the standard of care is not relevant or helpful [\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ]. Plaintiff has not responded to defendant's request to exclude the expert report.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   In her declaration, Ms. Hultz concludes that \"there is reason to doubt Maryville Anesthesiologists new version of what happened in the robotic surgery on January 5, 2016\" [Doc. 24-8 at \u00b6 11]. Ms. Hultz also describes Mr. Price's confusion as to when the fracture table surgery occurred as \"very difficult to accept\" [\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 21]. Ms. Hultz concludes that \"nothing in this case suggests any legitimate basis to doubt [plaintiff's] ability to practice safe anesthesia care for patients\" [\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 26]. In her expert report, Ms. Hultz opines that plaintiff's actions in the two surgical incidents \"were in all respects appropriate, reasonable, and consistent with the standard of care applicable to CRNAs in Tennessee, and none of Paula Babb's actions in either instance should have subjected her to discipline, much less termination, by her employer\" [Doc. 24-8 at p. 10]. Ms. Hultz also concludes that \"Ms. Babb's actions in the two instances described above could not legitimately have been the basis for her termination, because her actions did not fall outside the standard of care\" [\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at p. 12].\n   <footnotemark>\n    7\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   Fed.

It is undisputed that Maryville Anesthesiologists was aware of plaintiff's vision issue based on her early conversation with Dr. Coleman, the October 2015 meeting with Drs.

It is undisputed that this evaluation was not completed prior to her termination. Per Dr. Robertson's testimony, the physician-owners submitted their comments and evaluations of employees through a confidential web-based program [Doc. 15-2 at pp. 26-27].

Ms. Aycocke states that she composed the e-mail herself without input from or review by any of the physician-owners [Doc. 15-3 at \u00b6\u00b6 6, 11] and there is no dispute that she was not a decision-maker with regard to plaintiff's termination.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Rowan v.

Thus, Ms. Aycocke's e-mail is not attributable as a statement by the employer as evidence that plaintiff was regarded as disabled.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-57\">\n   Finally, plaintiff emphasizes Dr. Robertson's admission that she asked whether plaintiff had disability insurance at the October 2015 meeting because plaintiff \"might have a disability\" [Doc. 15-2 at p. 14] and defendant's acknowledgement that concerns regarding plaintiff's vision were discussed at the termination meeting. Defendant has emphasized that, although plaintiff's vision was discussed at the termination meeting, it was not a reason for her termination.

Defendant contends neither the October 2015 meeting nor Ms. Aycocke's e-mail establish a causal connection.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-59\">\n   As with the \"regarded as\" prong, plaintiff emphasizes Ms. Aycocke's e-mail and the admission that the physician-owners discussed plaintiff's vision at the termination meeting [Doc. 24 at pp. 18-20]. In reply, defendant contends that the two surgical incidents were errors in clinical judgment and not as a result of any issue with her vision [Doc. 26 at pp. 2-3]. Thus, defendant contends there is no evidence that plaintiff's vision was a \"but for\" cause of her termination.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-60\">\n   The Court agrees with plaintiff. Dr. Robertson's belief that plaintiff \"might have a disability\" and the admission that the defendant discussed her vision impairment during the meeting to terminate her\n   employment is some evidence that the decision, at least in part, was \"because of\" her vision. Thus, there is a question of fact as to whether plaintiff can establish a causal connection between her perceived vision impairment and her termination.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-61\">\n   B.\n   <em>\n    Whether Defendant's Legitimate Non-Discriminatory Reason is Pretextual\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-62\">\n   Once the plaintiff has established a prima facie case, the burden of production shifts to the defendant to present evidence of a legitimate, non-discriminatory reason for the termination.\n   <em>\n    Hedrick\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9059674\" index=\"71\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/355/444/#p453\">\n    355 F.3d at 453\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

Plaintiff does not really dispute that these are legitimate, non-discriminatory reasons, but instead argues that these reasons are pretext for discrimination [Doc. 24 at pp. 20-25]. The Court agrees that defendant has presented a legitimate, non-discriminatory reason for plaintiff's termination.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    DiGiosia v.

Plaintiff claims that the fracture table patient Mr. Price described was female, rather than male. She recalls that this surgery was problem-free, even though the case was complex due to the patient's obesity [\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6\u00b6 3, 6]. Plaintiff recalls a second fracture table surgery involving a male patient who began to move after she had given a reversing agent to allow him to start breathing on his own, but there was no \"near fall\" as described by Mr. Price [\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6\u00b6 4, 7]. Plaintiff also makes much of the fact that Mr. Price and Dr. Robertson testified that the fracture table incident occurred during a weekend in December 2015. Mr. Price has since corrected his testimony to acknowledge that the surgery occurred in October 2015 [Doc. 19-1 at \u00b6 5].\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-67\">\n   Regarding the robotic surgery, plaintiff claims she had not given the patient a muscle relaxant because the robot was not docked; her practice, which she followed in the January 5, 2016 surgery, was not to provide muscle relaxant to paralyze the patient until almost immediately before the surgery began [Doc. 24-3 at \u00b6 22]. She claims that Dr. Luhn did not enter the surgery room after the surgery had begun [\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 21]. She further opines that \"there is nothing wrong with a patient having twitches before surgery and especially before the robot is docked for surgery. In fact, allowing the patient to have twitches and continue to have twitches can allow the CRNA to have baseline [sic] of information regarding how the patient metabolizes the anesthesia\" [\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 20]. In further support of her position, plaintiff claims the surgeon did not ask for the patient to be given more relaxation drugs and records of her work on prior robotic surgery cases were approved without criticism [\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6\u00b6 23-25].\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-68\">\n   A defendant is entitled to summary judgment on the issue of pretext by showing its \"reasonable reliance on the particularized facts that were before it at the time the decision was made.\"\n   <em>\n    Smith v.

After receiving Ms. Green's report, Dr. Luhn went to the surgery room about an hour later and observed the patient had four twitches [Doc. 15-9 at \u00b6 3]. When Dr. Luhn mentioned the number of twitches to plaintiff, she responded that there \"different ways of doing things\" [\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ]. Dr. Luhn described these events at the physicians' meeting in January [\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 4].\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-71\">\n   (2) Mr. Price reported an incident to Dr. Proffitt when a patient on a fracture table began to awaken before the patient was moved to a regular bed because plaintiff reversed the anesthetic too soon [Doc. 15-10 at \u00b6 4]. Mr. Price also reported this to the Hospital's risk management group within days after it occurred [\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 5; Doc. 19-1 at \u00b6 6]. Mr. Price reported the incident to Dr. Proffitt in December 2015 and, at that time, believed the surgery had occurred in December [Doc. 19-1 at \u00b6 7]. Dr. Proffitt believed that the surgery had occurred in December 2015 and she reported this to Dr. Robertson on January 2, 2016 [Doc. 19-2 at \u00b6\u00b6 3-4; Doc. 15-11 at \u00b6 9].\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-72\">\n   (3) On January 8, 2016, Dr. Apostoaei reported to Dr. Robertson that plaintiff had written the wrong medication on a patient record [Doc. 15-11 at \u00b6 13].\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-73\">\n   (4) Other CRNAs and Hospital employees had reported concerns about plaintiff's vision and her ability to safely perform her job [Doc. 15-6 at \u00b6 3; Doc. 15-10 at \u00b6\u00b6 7-8; Doc. 15-11 at \u00b6 6, 9; Doc. 15-12 at \u00b6 4].\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-74\">\n   Thus, the information before the employer was that plaintiff had made two clinical errors in administering (or failing to administer) anesthesia during surgery and one medication charting error. The physicians were also aware that other employees and staff had concerns about plaintiff's ability to safely treat patients and that two Hospital surgeons did not want her to practice on their patients. While plaintiff makes much of the change in testimony by Mr. Price as to the timing of the fracture table surgery, this evidence came to light through litigation and was not before the physicians at the time of their decision. Moreover, the correct date of the surgery is not the salient point; the issue is whether the physicians' understanding of plaintiff's actions during the surgery led them to conclude that she did not have the clinical skill or judgment to provide safe patient care. Similarly, plaintiff's dispute as to when Dr. Luhn entered the robotic surgery and when the patient showed twitches does not change what the physicians understood the facts to be at the time of their decision. Most importantly, although plaintiff has disputed certain facts regarding the reasons for her discharge, she has not presented evidence that Maryville Anesthesiologists did not honestly believe those facts at the time of her termination.\n   <em>\n    Braithwaite\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11081800\" index=\"83\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/258/488/#p494\">\n    258 F.3d at 494\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-75\">\n   In sum, the evidence is that the clinical errors, based on the facts known at the time, led the defendant to conclude that plaintiff lacked the clinical judgment to provide safe anesthesia care to their patients.

Because of this, on occasions when she has relieved another CRNA and the patient had four twitches, plaintiff contends that a patient with four twitches was not considered a serious problem by her, the surgeon, or anyone else, and was not evidence of a clinical error [\n    <em>\n     Id.\n    </em>\n    at \u00b6 18].\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"6\">\n   <p id=\"p-85\">\n    Plaintiff disputes when Dr. Luhn entered the surgery room and whether Ms. Green had \"dosed the patient.\"\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"7\">\n   <p id=\"p-86\">\n    The Court notes that Ms. Hultz's declaration also contains certain technical opinions regarding anesthesia care which are not directly pertinent to defendant's challenge of her testimony for purposes of the pending motion [\n    <em>\n     see\n    </em>\n    Doc. 24-8 at \u00b6\u00b6 13-16].\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"8\">\n   <p id=\"p-87\">\n    In addition to the \"regarded as\" definition, the ADA definition of \"disability\" includes (1) an individual with a physical or mental impairment that substantially limits one or more major life activities or (2) an individual who has a record of such an impairment.\n    <extracted-citation index=\"84\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%2012102\">\n     42 U.S.C. \u00a7 12102\n    </extracted-citation>\n    (1)(A)-(B) (2009).
