On the night of August 20, 2016, Plaintiff went to dinner with a friend and his father after she had finished training.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 22. After dinner, Plaintiff received a text message inviting her to a fraternity party off-campus that evening.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 22.

At some point, the party became crowded and Plaintiff recalled accidentally bumping into the same person a number of times.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 25. Finally, Plaintiff turned to the person and said \"I have been bumped into you enough times I think that it merits being on a first name basis.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 25. The person was John Doe, and the two carried on a conversation, realizing that they had\n   previously met at an entrepreneurship event for startup companies in Lexington.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 25-26.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   After talking for about an hour, John Doe asked if Plaintiff had any plans for the rest of the night. John Doe Hearing Trans. at 28. She informed him that she was an RA, so she had needed to return to the dormitory by the 2:00 a.m. RA curfew but had no other plans for the evening.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 28. John Doe asked her if she would like to walk back to his apartment, which was close to Plaintiff's dorm, and continue their conversation.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 28. Plaintiff agreed and left the party with John Doe.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 28.

Plaintiff did not feel threatened by this.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 32. Plaintiff helped undress herself as they continued kissing and laughing.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 33-34.

At some point, Plaintiff stopped performing oral sex and began kissing John Doe again.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 34. Plaintiff then requested that John Doe get a condom.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 34-35.

John Doe invited Plaintiff to stay the night if she thought she would not be reprimanded for missing curfew.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 39. Plaintiff declined, and they walked together for the two blocks to her dorm.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 40. John Doe offered to walk Plaintiff to her dorm room door, but Plaintiff declined.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 41.

Plaintiff texted John Doe when she went to her room at 1:53 a.m. on August 21.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 51-52.

Ying told her that this constituted rape.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 42.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   Plaintiff also reached out to two other friends during the early morning of Sunday,\n   August 21, 2016: Michael, via text message, and Ethan, via voicemail. John Doe Hearing Trans. at 48-49. The next morning, Dealla met with Plaintiff to talk about what happened as they walked to a coffee shop.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 49. Dealla told Plaintiff that \"[she] d[id]n't think [John Doe] would ever do this.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 49.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   Plaintiff saw John Doe at a fraternity event the following Monday. John Doe Hearing Trans. at 52. Plaintiff tried to initiate conversation with John Doe, but he brushed her off.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 52-53. Over the next few weeks Plaintiff sent John Doe a number of text messages asking about his classes and if he would meet her for coffee.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 53; Texts with John Doe, Ex. 2. After receiving brief or no responses to her text messages, Plaintiff sent a long text message to John Doe indicating that she had been a virgin and that they had moved too fast during their encounter.

John Doe Hearing Trans. at 54.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   Plaintiff chose not to report the incident to the University at that time because she was worried about her friends in the fraternity knowing what had happened. John Doe Hearing Trans. at 50-51. At the hearing on this incident, Plaintiff stated that initially her \"first concern\" with reporting the incident was the effect it would have on her social life because all of her male friends were in this fraternity and all her female friends frequently attended the fraternity's events.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 55-56. Angelo Ying ultimately reported the incident to university officials on September 13, 2016. Compl. \u00b6 18; John Doe Hearing Trans. at 51. Ying reported that John Doe had \"[e]ngaged in vaginal sexual intercourse with the Plaintiff without her consent.\" Compl. \u00b6 18. Upon receiving this report, Deputy Title IX Coordinator Martha Alexander met with the Plaintiff at the University's Violence Intervention and Prevention Center (\"VIP\") on September 15, 2016. Compl. \u00b6 18. Plaintiff told Alexander that she did not want to pursue a formal investigation or hearing process then. M. Alexander Report, Ex. 1. Weeks passed, and Plaintiff requested the issuance of a No Contact order against John Doe on October 6, 2016. Compl. \u00b6 18.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   Then, on November 9, 2016, Plaintiff indicated to the Title IX office that she wished to pursue a formal investigation against John Doe. Compl. \u00b6 19. Alexander began a formal investigation into the matter, which was completed on December 16, 2016. Compl. \u00b6 19. Plaintiff remained concerned with how the investigation would interfere with her social life. Compl. \u00b6 21. Plaintiff was informed that while the Title IX office appreciated her concern and could provide preliminary sanctions to students involved in investigations, the office has no oversight over either the Office of Fraternity and Sorority Life or over the actions of the individual fraternities and sororities. Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 21-22; Oct. 6, 2016 No Contact Order, attached as Exhibit 4. A no contact order was put in place to ensure that Plaintiff and John Doe would have no physical or verbal interaction. Compl. \u00b6 22.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   Plaintiff was further informed that if she wished preliminary sanctions to be imposed regarding John Doe's contact with his fraternity, she would have need to reach out to the Office of Fraternity and Sorority Life or to his fraternity directly, as the Title IX office has no power to impose such sanctions. Compl. \u00b6 21.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   Plaintiff chose to contact John Doe's fraternity to seek additional preliminary sanctions, including that she be able to attend events for John Doe's fraternity but John Doe, a fraternity member, be excluded. Compl. \u00b6 23. The fraternity decided to require a \"sober buddy\" to attend fraternity events with John Doe, so as to ensure that no contact between Plaintiff and John Doe occurred. Compl. \u00b6 24. Unsatisfied with the fraternity's choice of preliminary sanction, Plaintiff again complained to the Title IX office that she wanted John Doe prohibited from attending his fraternity events. Compl. \u00b6 24. The Title IX office again informed her that it did not have the authority to impose such a sanction as it had no control over fraternity membership or governance. Compl. \u00b6 21, 24.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   Over the course of the investigation, Plaintiff frequently met with the Title IX office to participate in the investigation of her allegations against John Doe. Compl. \u00b6 28. The investigation involved interviewing many students and collecting evidence, such as text messages, one of Plaintiff's journal entries, and dorm entrance logs.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   M. Alexander Report, Ex. 1. Title IX office officials interviewed Jane Doe and John Doe multiple times on various aspects of the investigation., interviewed six other witnesses, and identified and reviewed more than ten exhibits over the course of the investigation.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   On several occasions, Plaintiff contacted the Title IX office, requesting meetings to discuss additional facts or alter her story.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   Plaintiff also contacted the Title IX office on numerous occasions to report actions she perceived as violations of the No Contact order. Compl. \u00b6 28. In November 2016, Plaintiff alleged that John Doe had followed her home, Compl. \u00b6 30, when she saw John Doe on campus outside of Kastle Hall and he followed her from there to her dorm. M. Alexander Report, Ex. 1. The Title IX office immediately investigated this complaint and found that there had been no verbal or physical contact between the two and that, thus, the no contact order had not been violated.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Additionally, John Doe reported this incident to the Title IX office as well because he felt Plaintiff was following him.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   He indicated Plaintiff had been walking the same direction behind he and a friend, then quickly passed him only to then walk very slowly directly in front of him.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   In another complaint, Plaintiff reported that John Doe \"came near\" her at a football tailgate party hosted by John Doe's fraternity. Compl. \u00b6 30; M. Alexander Report, Ex. 1; March 30, 2017 Emails between Pl. and M. Alexander, attached as Exhibit 5. Plaintiff reported that John Doe was present at his fraternity's tailgate and had \"looked at her\" multiple times but did not contact her. M. Alexander Report, Ex. 1. This complaint was investigated, and it was determined that no violation had occurred because there was no physical or verbal contact between the two. Compl. \u00b6 30; M. Alexander Report, Ex. 1. Additionally, witnesses stated that Plaintiff had specifically not been invited to that tailgate but had attended, stayed for five to six hours, and stared at John Doe \"the entire time.\" M. Alexander Report, Ex. 1. Another witness reported that Plaintiff said \"[John Doe] doesn't have any right to be here more than me.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   John Doe reported that he was aware Plaintiff was at the tailgate and was careful to have no contact with her while there.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   The Title IX office again concluded that the No Contact order had not been violated.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   In another instance, Plaintiff reported that she saw John Doe at a New Year's Eve party and felt this was a violation of the No Contact order. Compl. \u00b6 31; M. Alexander Report, Ex. 1. Plaintiff reported that she had been asked not to attend the party and believed this constituted retaliation.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Again, an investigation into the report was made and it was discovered that the party was not a fraternity function but hosted by an individual at the individual's private residence off campus.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Compl. \u00b6 31; M. Alexander Report, Ex. 1. Plaintiff had not been invited to this party but attended anyway. M. Alexander Report, Ex. 1. Additionally, John Doe reported he arrived at the party before Plaintiff.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   After she arrived, John Doe was careful not to have any contact with her and directed his friends and the hosts of the party to have no contact with her either.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   The Title IX office informed Plaintiff that they had no authority to force an individual to invite her to or exclude John Doe from a private party.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ; Compl. \u00b6 31. The Title IX office suggested that Plaintiff may feel safer during the pendency of the investigation if she tried to avoid events and gatherings that she reasonably believed John Doe would attend. Compl. \u00b6 31; M. Alexander Report, Ex. 1.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   During this time, John Doe also made reports to the Title IX office indicating that he felt as though Plaintiff was stalking him, citing the same incidents. M. Alexander Report, Ex. 1; Jan. 4, 2017 Emails between Pl. and M. Alexander, attached as Exhibit 6. As a result, on January 9, 2017, the Title IX office amended the No Contact order to indicate that neither party should attend events hosted by a group with which the other party was affiliated while the investigation and hearing process were underway.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Compl. \u00b6 33; M. Alexander Report, Ex. 1. The first draft of this change was inadvertently overbroad and was promptly amended to reflect that Plaintiff was still permitted to be around members of the fraternity, but not at events hosted by the fraternity unless she received permission to attend from the host.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Compl. \u00b6 35; Jan. 4, 2017 Emails, Ex. 6. Plaintiff continued to find these measures unsatisfactory and insisted that John Doe should be excluded from participation in his fraternity, even though the investigation and hearing process were not complete.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Compl. \u00b6 34; Mar. 30, 2017 Emails, Ex. 5.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   After months of investigation, the Title IX office informed Plaintiff that they had not found enough evidence to indicate that sexual misconduct had occurred to proceed to a hearing. Compl. \u00b6 36. The Title IX office explained that because the standard under which a respondent can be found responsible for sexual misconduct is \"more likely than not,\" they were doubtful enough evidence would support the allegation and elected not to proceed to a hearing. Compl. \u00b6 36. Upon receiving this news, Plaintiff became extremely upset and emotional to the extent that the Title IX office was worried about her emotional state. Compl. \u00b6 37; Jan. 9, 2017 Emails between Pl. and M. Alexander, attached at Exhibit 7. Because of Plaintiff's pleas, the Title IX office reconsidered their evaluation and elected to proceed to a hearing. Compl. \u00b6 38.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   In preparation for that hearing, once a draft of the investigative report regarding this matter was finalized, Alexander scheduled a time for Plaintiff to review the document to ensure her side of the story was accurately reflected. Compl. \u00b6 40; Jan. 23, 2017 Emails between Pl. and M. Alexander, attached as Exhibit 8. Anxious to read the report, Plaintiff inquired numerous times as to whether she could bring a copy of the report home to read or receive a copy by email, rather than going to the Title IX office. Jan. 23 Emails, Ex. 8. Alexander explained to Plaintiff that she\n   must come to the office, so as to maintain the confidentiality of the report and be able to voice any concerns she had prior to the report being finalized and presented to John Doe.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Plaintiff eventually scheduled a time to review the report in the office. Compl. \u00b6 40. While the meeting with Plaintiff was scheduled for an hour, which is typically enough time for complainants to review investigative reports, Plaintiff spent approximately two hours reviewing, discussing, and editing the seventeen page document. Compl. \u00b6 41;\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Jan. 24, 2017 M. Alexander Calendar Entries, attached as Exhibit 9. After Plaintiff reviewed the report for an extended period of time, Alexander informed Plaintiff that John Doe had an appointment to review the report two hours after Plaintiff and would be arriving at the office soon.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Jan. 24, 2017 Emails, Ex. 9. Plaintiff continued to review the report and, because of Plaintiff's extension of her meeting time, Plaintiff and John Doe were both present in the Title IX office at the same time. Compl. \u00b6 42. Plaintiff never saw John Doe nor was there any verbal or physical contact between the two.

The relevant facts are straightforward. Plaintiff reported the alleged assault, Defendant placed a no-contact order in effect at her request, and Plaintiff then alleged that she saw the accused student in passing on a limited number of occasions on campus. Finally, she alleges that she was confronted at an off-campus site by a friend of one of the accused students, and that her request for additional sanctions against them was denied.

In\n   <em>\n    Williams\n   </em>\n   , a student was repeatedly raped by several other students in the same night. She averred that the defendants exhibited deliberate indifference to her rights under Title IX because Georgia officials had knowledge that one of the accused students had a significant history of prior incidents of sexual misconduct but still admitted him as a student and placed him, unsupervised and without advising him of the sexual misconduct policy, in a student dormitory for lodging.\n   <em>\n    Williams\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3779796\" index=\"21\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/477/1282/\">\n    477 F.3d at 1287, 1297\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

The Sixth Circuit has repeatedly held that deliberate indifference is lacking where the evidence establishes that the school promptly responded to complaints, investigated the complaint, and either imposed discipline where an individual was found responsible for wrongdoing or took proactive steps to reduce the opportunity for future conduct.\n   <em>\n    See e.g.\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Stiles ex rel.

In this instance, the University did not \"brush [Plaintiff] off as hysterical\" with regard to complaints she made regarding possible violation of the no contact orders or her requests for amendments to the orders. The University addressed each isolated report but, because none of the reported incidents involved physical or verbal contact between the parties nor did they show evidence that Plaintiff was in danger, the University had no basis to find a violation of the order had occurred or that an amendment should be made.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-50\">\n   Additionally, Plaintiff alleges the University was too slow in investigating and adjudicating her complaints. This allegation ignores the fact that at least some of what she views as delay was made at Plaintiff's request. [\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Alexander Report, DE 13, Ex. 1 at 1-2.] As detailed in the Investigative Report, no complaint was made regarding the alleged August 20, 2016 assault involving John Doe until nearly a month later, on September 13, 2016.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 1. Martha Alexander, Interim Title\n   IX Coordinator, met with Plaintiff two days later, on September 15, 2016.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 1. Plaintiff initially indicated that she did not want to pursue a formal investigation into the incident and \"review of the known facts did not reveal any basis on which to proceed against [Plaintiff's] wishes.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 1-2. Almost a month later on October 6, 2016, Plaintiff requested a no contact order and the order was put in place the very same day.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 2. Not until November 9, 2016, approximately two-and-a-half-months after the alleged assault occurred, did Plaintiff request a formal investigation be conducted.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 2. The report was completed in mid-January 2017 and the subsequent hearing, which Plaintiff requested, was conducted in late February 2017, three-and-a-half months after she requested a formal investigation.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-51\">\n   Nor was there a delay suggesting deliberate indifference in the case of James Doe, Plaintiff again wished not to participate in a formal investigation process to address this report. [Enlow Report, DE 13, Ex. 20 at 2.] However, due to the nature of the allegations and after a thorough review of the facts, the University was obligated to pursue a formal investigation despite Plaintiff's lack of participation.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Prior to and during the investigation process, delay occurred due to the extreme difficulty the University experienced attempting to make contact with James Doe throughout the process.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 3. The University zealously attempted to contact James Doe throughout the process through at least eight telephone calls, seven emails, and even waiting for James Doe twice outside his classes.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Additionally, James Doe failed to attend at least four meetings Title IX officials had scheduled with him and was forty-five minutes late for one meeting.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Ultimately, the University moved forward with a hearing without James Doe's participation (despite providing notice to James Doe via email of the date and time of the hearing) so as to adjudicate the matter in as timely a manner as possible. [James Doe SMAB Decision, DE 13, Ex. 23 at 3-5.]\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-52\">\n   Plaintiff argues that the University's failure to strictly follow its policies constitutes deliberate indifference. However, the Court agrees with the University that Plaintiff's argument here is inappropriately focused on how she, through the University, could punish her alleged assailants - which is not the standard for liability under Title IX. Whether the University failed to discipline is not the question before this Court. Instead, in this lawsuit, she must turn her focus to whether the University acted \"clearly unreasonably\" in attempting to prevent any harassment. This aspect of Doe's Complaint takes issue with the University's administrative\n   <em>\n    process\n   </em>\n   rather than its alleged indifference to Plaintiff's\n   <em>\n    harassment.\n   </em>\n   The Court agrees that, on the facts before it, complaining about the process rather than the response to the alleged harassment itself is simply not actionable by Plaintiff under Title IX.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-53\">\n   Further, the Court can find no support in the case law or common sense to suggest that the participation of John Doe's attorney in the hearing process constituted deliberate indifference to the harassment alleged. The University process utilizes a hearing officer, at the time either a retired professor of law or a retired Court of Appeals judge, who makes rulings during the course of the hearing and vests them with the discretion to make a ruling they deem judicious to comport with the Constitution, including issues of due process. [AR 6:2, DE 13, Ex. 11.] In the case of the John Doe hearing, the hearing officer determined that due process required the limited participation of the accused's attorney.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-54\">\n   Nor was it actionably unfair for the University to allow participation of John Doe's attorney without providing an attorney to advocate for \"her interests\" as well.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-55\">\n   Plaintiff cites no provision for or precedent which suggests that the alleged victim has the right to appointed counsel in a Title IX adjudication process. Nonetheless, Plaintiff was informed that she, too, was permitted to bring an attorney as a support person, and Plaintiff chose not to invite such an individual. The Title IX adjudication process is not a civil lawsuit between the alleged victim and the respondent. Rather, it is a mechanism for universities to keep their campuses safe by responding to actions in violation of University sexual misconduct policies. Through the hearing process, schools determine whether a violation has occurred. In the case of John Doe, the hearing panel did not find that there was enough evidence to show that he had committed a sexual misconduct violation. Since no violation had occurred, he was not punished, although the no contact order remained in place. As for James Doe, James did not appear at his hearing. As such, a hearing panel found that, based on the testimony provided by the alleged victim only, there was enough evidence to find James Doe had committed a sexual misconduct violation. James Doe was expelled. Plaintiff was not a party in either instance, nor could she be since these were internal University student disciplinary proceedings between the University and the accused students.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-56\">\n   Neither can the Court fathom how any reasonable trier of fact could view interviewing her with respect to her complaints or giving her the option to attend or not attend the hearing constitutes deliberate indifference on the facts as averred. The University repeatedly told Plaintiff that she could participate in as little or as much as she wanted to in the investigation and hearing process. Multiple interviews were conducted to clarify Plaintiff's story and were often at Plaintiff's request when she remembered new aspects of her story. Additionally, Plaintiff was informed that she was not compelled to be in the room for the entire hearing and accommodations could be made so that she was only present for her own testimony. Plaintiff chose to participate at the level she did, and the University cannot be held liable for such a decision. On the facts before this Court, there is no plausible argument that giving \"too much\" due process required by the Constitution violates Title IX.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-57\">\n   Plaintiff seeks discovery to further develop the issue of whether the University's actions constitute deliberate indifference. However, further discovery will not overcome the fact that much of Plaintiff's complaints are about the University's administrative\n   <em>\n    process\n   </em>\n   , which is not a viable claim under Title IX, rather than its alleged indifference to Plaintiff's harassment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-58\">\n   <strong>\n    IV.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-59\">\n   Next, the Court concludes that the University has sovereign immunity from suit with respect to Plaintiff's breach of contract claim and any additional negligence claims, so no discovery is needed, despite her arguments to the contrary.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Green v.
