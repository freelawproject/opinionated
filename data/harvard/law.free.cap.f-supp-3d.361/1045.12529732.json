Browning, UNITED STATES DISTRICT JUDGE\n  </author>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   <strong>\n    THIS MATTER\n   </strong>\n   comes before the Court on the Defendant's Motion for Judgment on the Pleadings and Memorandum of Law in Support, filed April 4, 2018 (Doc. 58)(\"MJP\"). The Court held a hearing on August 10, 2018. The primary issues are: (i) whether Defendant Financial Indemnity Company is entitled to judgment as a matter of law as to all claims for insureds who have non-minimum limits underinsured motorist (\"UIM\") coverage;\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   and (ii) whether, as a matter of law, Financial Indemnity can be liable to Plaintiff Helen Bhasker for extracontractual or punitive damages. The Court concludes that: (i) Financial Indemnity is not entitled to judgment as a matter of law as to all claims for insureds who have non-minimum limits UIM coverage, because Bhasker has alleged that Financial Indemnity's business practices misled and deceived not only herself but also proposed class members who purchased greater-than-minimum-limits UIM coverage; and (ii) Financial Indemnity can be liable to Bhasker for extracontractual and punitive damages, at this stage in the proceedings, because Bhasker has alleged that Financial Indemnity's decision to sell illusory UIM coverage was willful or reckless. Although the Court will not dismiss Bhasker's claims on behalf of proposed class members who purchased greater-than-minimum-limits UIM coverage, the Court predicts that the Supreme Court of New Mexico would conclude that higher-than-minimum limits UIM coverage has value, because New Mexico's statutory offset provision is in accord with New Mexico public policy. The Court therefore permits Bhasker's claims on behalf of proposed class members to proceed on the theory that Financial Indemnity misled her and a class of insureds who, like Bhasker, purchased UIM coverage believing that they would receive the full UIM coverage reflected on their declarations pages, whether minimum limits or some greater figure. Accordingly, the Court denies the MJP.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   <em>\n    <strong>\n     FACTUAL BACKGROUND\n    </strong>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   Bhasker contends that, \"[b]ased on the information provided by the Defendant,\" she agreed to \"pay a six-month premium for the State of New Mexico mandated minimum automobile bodily injury and uninsured/underinsured motorist coverage.\" First Amended Class Action Complaint for Breach of Statutory, Common Law, and Contractual Duties \u00b6 30, at 5, filed March 23, 2017 (Doc. 12)(\"Complaint\"). According to Bhasker, her insurance policy features: (i) liability coverage on one vehicle for $25,000.00 per person and $50,000.00 per accident, per vehicle; and (ii) underinsured coverage on one vehicle for $25,000.00 per person and $50,000.00 per occurrence, per vehicle.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Complaint \u00b6\u00b6 42-43, at 7 (citing Coverage for 1995 Lexus LS 500 4D at 1 (dated May\n   14, 2015), filed March 23, 2017 (Doc. 12-2) ). Bhasker asserts that Financial Indemnity did not \"fully inform\" her that \"a purchase of 25/50 underinsured coverage, when triggered by a crash with a tortfeasor who has 25/50 bodily injury liability limits, will result in a payment of premium for which no payment of benefits will occur ....\" Complaint \u00b6 48, at 8.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   Bhasker avers that, on June 24, 2015, she was driving eastbound on I-40 in Albuquerque, New Mexico, when another driver, Stephanie Martinez, \"failed to stop for the traffic in front of her vehicle\" and struck Bhasker's car in the rear, causing \"serious bodily injuries and other damages.\" Complaint \u00b6\u00b6 12-14, at 2-3. Bhasker asserts that Martinez \"was an underinsured motorist at the time of the collision\" as Bhasker's insurance policy and New Mexico law define the term. Complaint \u00b6 17, at 3. Bhasker contends that she \"received the full extent of liability coverage carried by Ms. Martinez,\" which was $25,000.00. Complaint \u00b6 18, at 3. Bhasker asserts that, after the accident, Financial Indemnity provided a certified copy of a document summarizing her policy.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Complaint \u00b6 38, at 6 (citing New Mexico Personal Auto Application at 1-4 (dated July 14, 2011), filed March 23, 2017 (Doc. 12-1)(\"Policy Application\") ). Bhasker contends that the \"certified copy of the [Policy Application] materially misrepresented the terms of [its] underinsured [motorist] coverage and did not contain clear, unambiguous language regarding the effects of New Mexico's underinsured coverage offset laws.\" Complaint \u00b6 39, at 6. Furthermore, Bhasker contends that the Policy Application's language is \"deceptive and clearly ambiguous in that it states that the applicant may purchase underinsured coverage in excess of the bodily injury coverage limits, which is the opposite of the legislative intent\" of\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=N.M.%20Stat.%20Ann.%20%C2%A7%2066-5-301\">\n    N.M. Stat. Ann. \u00a7 66-5-301\n   </extracted-citation>\n   and New Mexico case law. Complaint \u00b6 40, at 6. Bhasker contends that Financial Indemnity's Policy Application\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-13\">\n   did not alert [her], nor make clear to the ordinary and similarly situated insured, the fact that the New Mexico offset law drastically and materially diminished payment of benefits arising from a covered occurrence under the policy....

Bhasker avers that, when she, \"through counsel, demanded Defendant provide [her] with underinsured benefits that Defendant solicited and for which the Plaintiff paid a premium,\" Financial Indemnity denied her claim for underinsured benefits. Complaint \u00b6 44, at 7. Bhasker further contends that Financial Indemnity has \"written direct premium automobile insurance to thousands of New Mexico residents and, from 2010-2014, wrote direct premiums\" around the United States totaling $1.09 billion.

In the MTD, Financial Indemnity argues that the filed rate and voluntary payments doctrines bar Bhasker's claims.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   MTD at 1. Financial Indemnity also asserts that Bhasker's illusory coverage argument is \"simply wrong\" as a matter of law, \"because minimum limits underinsured motorists coverage does provide tangible benefits to those who choose it.\" MTD at 1. The Court held a hearing on July 24, 2017.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Hearing Transcript (taken July 24, 2017) (Doc. 34).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   The Court filed a Memorandum Opinion and Order (\"MOO\") denying Financial Indemnity's requests in the MTD.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Memorandum Opinion and Order, filed January 10, 2018 (Doc. 48);\n   <em>\n    Bhasker v.

Specifically, the Court concluded that: (i) the filed rate doctrine does not bar Bhasker's claims, because the Supreme Court of New Mexico would not apply the filed rate doctrine\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   to bar claims against insurers for unfair or deceptive business practices; (ii) Bhasker's claims are well-pled even if the UIM insurance is not illusory; and (iii) the voluntary payment doctrine\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   does not bar Bhasker's claims, because she alleges that she did not know all the material facts.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   MOO at 56;\n   <em>\n    Bhasker v.

Defendant is entitled to judgment as a matter of law as to all claims for insureds who have non-minimum limits underinsured motorist ... coverage; and 2. Defendant cannot, as a matter of law, be liable to Plaintiff for extra-contractual or punitive damages.\" MJP at 1. Financial Indemnity asserts that, although the Court, in its MOO, denied Financial Indemnity's MTD, the MOO reflects that all Bhasker's claims \"are premised on the theory that the minimum limits UIM coverage at issue in this case is 'illusory.' \" MJP at 1. Financial Indemnity further asserts that the Court should hold that Bhasker is not entitled, as a matter of law, to the extracontractual or putative damages that she seeks, because Financial Indemnity \"certainly had a reasonable basis for enforcing the offset as it did, and for believing its minimum limits UIM coverage was neither illusory nor otherwise unlawful.\" MJP at 2.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   Financial Indemnity argues that \"[t]his Court's Order indicates clearly that the illusory coverage claim raised by this case applies to minimum limits UIM coverage, not where any level of UIM limits above the minimum is at issue.\" MJP at 4. Financial Indemnity cites language from the Court's MOO which emphasizes, for example, that Bhasker's UIM insurance is illusory and that, because of New Mexico's offset law, \"there is virtually\n   <em>\n    no possible underinsured minimum limits claim\n   </em>\n   available\" to Bhasker and \"other similarly situated members of the class.\" MJP at 4 (quoting MOO at 3;\n   <em>\n    Bhasker v. Kemper Cas. Ins. Co.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12522809\" index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/284/1191/#p1191\">\n    284 F.Supp.3d at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   1194 )(emphasis in MJP). Financial Indemnity summarized Bhasker's illusory insurance coverage theory: \"when the tortfeasor's minimum bodily injury liability limits, which would be at least $25,000/$50,000, are offset against the insured's minimum $25,000/$50,000 UIM limits, the injured insured would have paid a premium for which no payment of benefits will occur once the offset is applied.\" MJP at 4-5. Financial Indemnity argues that this theory does not apply outside the minimum limits UIM context, because, for example, \"if the insured has UIM limits of $50,000, $100,000 or any amount greater than $25,000, and the tortfeasor has $25,000 in bodily injury liability limits and that amount is offset, the injured insured\n   <em>\n    will\n   </em>\n   recover UIM benefits where the damages exceed the tortfeasor's limits.\" MJP at 5 (emphasis in MJP).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   Financial Indemnity further asserts that the Court should limit Bhasker's illusory coverage theory to insureds with minimum limits UIM coverage, because\n   <em>\n    Progressive Northwest Insurance Co. v.

Hence, according to Financial Indemnity,\n   <em>\n    Weed Warrior\n   </em>\n   confirms that\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-23\">\n   the problem of \"illusory\" UIM coverage arises, if at all, only in connection with minimum limits UIM coverage --\n   <em>\n    i.e.\n   </em>\n   , where an injured insured's minimum UIM limits of $25,000 are offset by a tortfeasor's $25,000 bodily injury liability limits. It would not arise in cases involving UIM coverage limits above the minimum --\n   <em>\n    e.g.\n   </em>\n   , where an insured's $50,000 or $100,000 UIM limits (or any amount above $25,000) are only partially offset\n   by a tortfeasor's $25,000 bodily injury liability limits.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   MJP at 6.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   Financial Indemnity adds that the Court \"would directly contravene the purpose of New Mexico's UM/UIM statute\" if the Court permits Bhasker to apply her theory beyond the minimum limits UIM coverage context, because the Supreme Court of New Mexico has stated that \u00a7 66-5-301's purpose \"is to assure that, in the event of an accident with an underinsured vehicle, an insured motorist entitled to compensation will receive at least the sum certain in underinsurance coverage purchased for his or her benefit,\" and that the UIM insurer must satisfy the difference only \"[t]\n   <em>\n    o the extent the amount of other available insurance proceeds from responsible underinsured tortfeasors does not equal or exceed the amount of coverage purchased.\n   </em>\n   \" MJP at 7 (quoting\n   <em>\n    Farmers Ins.

According to Financial Indemnity, these cases show that the purpose of New Mexico's UIM statute, with its express offset provision, \"is to put the insured in the same position as he or she would have been had the tortfeasor had liability insurance coverage in the amount of UIM coverage purchased by the insured.\" MJP at 8. Hence, Financial Indemnity alleges:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-26\">\n   If Plaintiff's \"illusory\" UIM coverage approach were adopted beyond the minimum UIM limits context, and the offset provision could therefore not be applied, that would defeat the whole purpose of the statute.

In addition, argues Financial Indemnity, because Bhasker paid a single premium for combined UM and UIM coverage, and because, under New Mexico law, rates must be charged based on the insurer's loss history,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   MJP at 17 (citing N.M.

Moreover, Financial Indemnity maintains that the UM portion of the combined coverage \"certainly\" has value even at minimum limits. MJP at 17.

Financial Indemnity replied by summarizing the arguments made before the Court in its MTD,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Aug. 10 Tr. at 4:1-19 (Hanover), and asserted:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-76\">\n   Since that time, several things have occurred. First, the plaintiff's bar of New Mexico has filed parallel punitive class actions against State Farm, Liberty Mutual, Safeco, GEICO, and Young America. In all but one of those cases, the insurance company has moved to certify questions to the New Mexico Supreme Court, and in at least one of the cases the parties jointly agree that a question should be certified to the Supreme Court, though they don't agree on the wording.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-77\">\n   The second thing that's occurred is that there has been extensive discovery in the present case, including multiple discovery disputes. Plaintiffs currently have pending two motions to compel, and FIC has pending a motion for protective order. While the discovery disputes between the parties include many discrete issues, the source of some of them arises from disagreements about the scope of the plaintiff's case and that's partly what drove FIC to file the present motion.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-78\">\n   Aug. 10 Tr. at 4:20-5:15 (Hanover).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-79\">\n   The Court stated that filing a motion on the pleadings after the Court has decided a 12(b)(6) motion is \"a very unusual practice\" that the Court has neither seen before nor wants to encourage. Aug. 10 Tr. at 5:16-24 (Court). Financial Indemnity replied that it is not asking the Court to reconsider its decision but is asking instead that the Court clarify the scope of how Bhasker can proceed in this case, which will affect ongoing discovery disputes between the parties.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Aug. 10 Tr. at 5:1-6 (Hanover). Financial Indemnity added that it understands the Court's ruling as to Bhasker's minimum limits UIM theory, but is asking the Court to rule as a matter of law that Financial Indemnity is entitled to judgment in its favor for anyone who has greater than minimum limits UIM coverage.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Aug. 10 Tr. at 6:23-7:1 (Hanover).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-80\">\n   Financial Indemnity asserted that the problem with Bhasker's position \"is that it makes no sense for any policyholder who has limits higher than the statutory minimum.\" Aug. 10 Tr. at 7:8-10 (Hanover). Financial Indemnity then provided the Court with several examples involving a\n   hypothetical policyholder with $100,000.00 in UIM coverage who suffers damages exceeding her $100,00.00 liability limits.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Aug. 10 Tr. at 7:10-13 (Hanover). Financial Indemnity first conceded that, if the hypothetical tortfeasor has $100,000.00 in liability limits, the policy holder would not recover anything under her UIM claim,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Aug. 10 Tr. at 7:15-17 (Hanover); however, Financial Indemnity then asserted that in most cases the policyholder would recover, for example, \"if the tortfeasor has liability limits of $25,000, $50,000, ... because the Schmick offset would still leave the policyholder with a positive dollar differential of recovery,\" Aug. 10 Tr. at 7:21-8:4 (Hanover). Under Bhasker's theory, contended Financial Indemnity, the\n   <em>\n    Schmick\n   </em>\n   offset renders all UIM coverage illusory, and, should the Court adopt it for limits above the minimum, the Court would, in effect, overrule\n   <em>\n    Schmick\n   </em>\n   .\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Aug. 10 Tr. at 7:21-8:4 (Hanover).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-81\">\n   The Court then asked Financial Indemnity to summarize what Financial Indemnity wants the Court to say,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Aug. 10 Tr. at 8:19-20 (Court), and Financial Indemnity replied: \"The Court grants judgment to Financial Indemnity Company as to any putative class member with limits above the statutory minimum,\" Aug. 10 Tr. at 8:21-24 (Hanover). The Court asked why,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Aug. 10 Tr. at 8:25 (Court), and Financial Indemnity replied that, in addition to the previously articulated reasons, UIM policies have value with respect to anyone who has liability limits lower than the UIM policy limits, \"which is going to be a lot of people in the state.\" Aug. 10 Tr. at 9:2-9 (Hanover). Financial Indemnity then quoted from\n   <em>\n    Schmick\n   </em>\n   to describe how New Mexico's offset provision permits insurers to offset the UIM coverage purchased for the insured's benefit by any available liability proceeds.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Aug. 10 Tr. at 9:17-10:6 (Hanover). Financial Indemnity returned to its $100,000.00 coverage hypothetical and stated that, pursuant to New Mexico law, if the policyholder collided with a tortfeasor with $25,000.00 of liability coverage, then the $25,000.00 is offset, and the most that the policyholder could recover from her insurer is $75,000.00; \"that's how premiums are determined, and that's how people have been paid, and it has value, and it has value for everyone over the minimum.\" Aug. 10 Tr. at 10:7-15 (Hanover).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-82\">\n   Financial Indemnity stated that, when it last appeared before the Court, it had the impression that Bhasker's theory was limited to insureds with minimum limits only, because, in a collision, insureds with such coverage face two possibilities: \"You're in a collision with someone who has no insurance coverage, in which case your uninsured motorist coverage has full value; or you're insured [sic] with someone who's got $25,000 minimum limits, in which case the plaintiffs say there's no value at all.\" Aug. 10 Tr. at 10:16-11:3 (Hanover). Financial Indemnity added that it still thinks that value exists in the latter scenario, but that those two scenarios alone is where the Court made its prediction about how the Supreme Court of New Mexico would rule.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Aug. 10 Tr. at 11:3-6 (Hanover). Financial Indemnity argued that, because nothing in the Court's MOO considers what would happen if the limits were higher than the minimum, the Court should grant judgment in its favor, which would also resolve ongoing discovery disputes and enable Financial Indemnity to gauge its exposure in this case.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Aug. 10 Tr. at 11:7-13 (Hanover).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-83\">\n   Financial Indemnity next alleged that a second problem with Bhasker's theory is that it is inconsistent with the Court's MOO, because, according to Financial Indemnity, the MOO \"envisioned\" that the case is about minimum limits. Aug. 10 Tr. at 11:17-19 (Hanover)(citing MOO at 2-5). A third problem with Bhasker's theory,\n   alleged Financial Indemnity, is that it contradicts\n   <em>\n    Progressive v. Weed Warrior\n   </em>\n   .\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Aug. 10 Tr. at 11:20-22 (Hanover). Financial Indemnity argued that, in\n   <em>\n    Progressive v. Weed Warrior\n   </em>\n   , the Supreme Court of New Mexico was considering only minimum limits coverage when it stated that \"an insured carries UIM coverage only if the UM/UIM limits on her or his policy are greater than the statutory minimum of $25,000.\" Aug. 10 Tr. at 11:20-22 (Hanover)(quoting\n   <em>\n    Weed Warrior\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4250176\" index=\"156\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/nm/149/157/\">\n    2010-NMSC-050\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , \u00b6 10,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4250176\" index=\"157\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/nm/149/157/\">\n    149 N.M. 157\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 245 P.3d at 1213 ). Hence, Financial Indemnity charged, the Court's reliance on\n   <em>\n    Progressive v. Weed Warrior\n   </em>\n   to predict how the Supreme Court of New Mexico would rule is \"explicitly limited to situations where the UM/UIM coverage is not greater than $25,000.\" Aug. 10 Tr. at 12:3-8 (Hanover).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-84\">\n   Financial Indemnity alleged that the final problem with Bhasker's theory is that it is inconsistent with caselaw from both within and outside New Mexico.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Aug. 10 Tr. at 12:10-12 (Hanover). Financial Indemnity insisted that the reasoning behind both\n   <em>\n    Farmers Insurance Co. of Arizona v. Sandoval\n   </em>\n   , and\n   <em>\n    Fasulo v. State Farm Mutual Automobile Insurance Co.\n   </em>\n   is on making the policyholder whole,\n   <em>\n    i.e.\n   </em>\n   , to the purchased UIM coverage limits.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Aug. 10 Tr. at 12:12-17 (Hanover). Under Bhasker's theory, however, argued Financial Indemnity, insurers could not apply a\n   <em>\n    Schmick\n   </em>\n   offset at any UIM coverage level, thereby permitting policy holders to recover their UIM limits plus the tortfeasor's liability limits.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Aug. 10 Tr. at 12:17-21 (Hanover). Financial Indemnity returned to its $100,000.00 UIM limits hypothetical and asserted that, under Bhasker's theory and a tortfeasor with $25,000.00 of liability limits, \"the policyholder recovers $25,000 in liability, and they get the full $100,000 in UIM for a grand total of $125,000 of insurance recovery.\" Aug. 10 Tr. at 12:21-13:3 (Hanover). This result, insisted Financial Indemnity, ignores\n   <em>\n    Schmick\n   </em>\n   , which says that insurers measure UIM limits based on the \"dec page,\n   <footnotemark>\n    7\n   </footnotemark>\n   $100,000\" in the hypothetical, and apply an offset. Aug. 10 Tr. at 13:6-9 (Hanover). Financial Indemnity contends that, when it explained the\n   <em>\n    Schmick\n   </em>\n   offset to Bhasker, Bhasker replied: \"All UIM coverage is illusory\"; Financial Indemnity thus seeks a ruling from the Court that this case involves only minimum limits UIM coverage. Aug. 10 Tr. at 13:13-18 (Hanover).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-85\">\n   Financial Indemnity turned to out-of-state caselaw and asserted that it cited to\n   <em>\n    Taylor v. Greatway, Insurance Co.\n   </em>\n   -- a case from a state where the state supreme court had held previously that minimum limits UIM coverage is illusory -- as a real-world example of the $100,000.00 hypothetical, with the only material difference being that the insured in that case had $50,000.00 of UIM coverage.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Aug. 10 Tr. at 13:21-14:5 (Hanover). In rejecting the insured's theory that recovery was illusory, because the entirety of her $50,000.00 UIM coverage was offset, the Supreme Court of Wisconsin concluded that, because in most situations the tortfeasor will have less than $50,000.00 in liability coverage, which would permit an insured to recover, her UIM coverage had value.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Aug. 10 Tr. at 14:5-11 (Hanover). Financial Indemnity insisted that the Supreme Court of Wisconsin rejected \"basically\" the same theory that Bhasker advances\n   in this case. Aug. 10 Tr. at 14:12-14 (Hanover).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-86\">\n   Financial Indemnity contended that\n   <em>\n    Pristavec v. Westfield Insurance Co.\n   </em>\n   , the first of two out-of-state cases on which Bhasker relies, although similar to New Mexico caselaw in that West Virginia defines underinsured situations to include those where the tortfeasor's liability limit was lower than the insured's UIM limits, involves a statute which, unlike \u00a7 66-5-301, specifies that insurers evaluate UIM coverage by comparing the tortfeasor's liability limit with the insured's damages -- not with the insured's UIM limits -- and that this results in an offset scheme that differs from what New Mexico law requires.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Aug. 10 Tr. at 14:16-15:10 (Hanover). Financial Indemnity conceded that\n   <em>\n    Hardy v. Progressive Specialty Insurance Co.\n   </em>\n   , the second of Bhasker's two out-of-state cases, indeed found UIM coverage illusory at all levels, as Bhasker argues here, but asserted that the Supreme Court of Montana did so as a matter of Montana public policy, which differs significantly from New Mexico public policy.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Aug. 10 Tr. at 15:11-22 (Hanover). Pursuant to\n   <em>\n    Schmick\n   </em>\n   , New Mexico public policy, urged Financial Indemnity, requires offsets.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Aug. 10 Tr. at 15:19-22 (Hanover).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-87\">\n   The Court then asked to hear from Bhasker on the illusory coverage issue before turning to Financial Indemnity's extracontractual damages argument.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Aug. 10 Tr. at 16:2-7 (Hanover, Court). Bhasker replied that, as she described in the prior hearing, this case is about Financial Indemnity's misleading and deceptive business practices, and that the illusory coverage question \"is a subissue to the overarching theme.\"\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Aug. 10 Tr. at 16:11-15 (Bhasker).\n   <footnotemark>\n    8\n   </footnotemark>\n   Bhasker stated that she believes, as the Court opined at the beginning of the hearing, that \"this is just a motion to reconsider,\" Aug. 10 Tr. at 16:16-19 (Bhasker), and disputed Financial Indemnity's contention that the Court narrowed the case to UIM coverage at minimum limits: \"However, if defendants had taken a thorough reading of the complaint, as the Court did, and a thorough reading of the class definition, the defendants would understand that this case is for the deceptive and misleading practices for all insureds who have ever had an offset applied against them,\" Aug. 10 Tr. at 16:20-17:3 (Bhasker). Bhasker insisted that specific language from the Court's MOO indicates the Court's support for this proposition:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-88\">\n   Bhasker also asserts that [F]inancial [I]ndemnity misled the proposed class in the same way.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   complaint (paragraph 52 at 9) stating that upon information and belief all underinsured applications and insurance policies issued by the defendant to New Mexico policyholders are uniform in all respects material to the claims brought herein (complaint, paragraph 73 at page 15) alleging that [F]inancial [I]ndemnity failed to deliver the quality or quantity of the services applied for and purchased for plaintiffs and other insureds by not providing sufficiently clear applications and policies (complaint, paragraph 83 at 17), alleging that [F]inancial [I]ndemnity misrepresented the terms of the policy sold and provided to plaintiff and other insureds (complaint, paragraph 93, at page 19), stating that [F]inancial [I]ndemnity failed to provide underinsured coverage and/or denied underinsured claims for benefits to plaintiff and other members of the class.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-89\">\n   Aug. 10 Tr. at 17:3-25 (Bhasker)(quoting MOO at 79). Consequently, Bhasker asserted that she is \"dumbfounded\" as to\n   why Financial Indemnity has the impression that the Court narrowed the case to minimum limits UIM coverage. Aug. 10 Tr. at 18:1-3 (Bhasker). Bhasker added that the Court also determined that Bhasker's allegations, which include negligence, New Mexico's Unfair Insurance Practices Act, N.M. Stat. Ann. \u00a7 59A-16-20 (\"UIPA\") violations, and misleading and deceptive business practices that \"amount[ ] to punitive conduct,\" are well pled. Aug. 10 Tr. 18:3-15 (Bhasker). To that end, Bhasker admitted that she \"did launch discovery requests which also include discovery that would encompass insureds who purchase coverage at higher limits.\" Aug. 10 Tr. at 18:19-22 (Bhasker).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-90\">\n   Bhasker next turned to Financial Indemnity's $100,000.00 UIM limits hypothetical and asserted that, although a collision with a minimum limits tortfeasor would result in a maximum offset of $25,000.00, a collision with a $100,000.00 liability limits tortfeasor -- \"maybe they're in the Northeast Heights or driving around Academy school\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    9\n   </footnotemark>\n   -- would result in a $100,000.00 offset, \"even though they have damages that are outstanding.\" Aug. 10 Tr. at 18:24-19:11 (Bhasker). Bhasker reasoned that such higher limits UIM policyholders \"were mislead and deceived in the same manner as the class representative.\" Aug. 10 Tr. at 19:11-15 (Bhasker).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-91\">\n   Bhasker argued that cases like\n   <em>\n    Pristavec v. Westfield Insurance Co.\n   </em>\n   and\n   <em>\n    Hardy v. Progressive Specialty Insurance Co.\n   </em>\n   , provide the Court with persuasive authority to support her assertion that a total offset, like the offset described above, goes against public policy.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Aug. 10 Tr. at 19:16-21 (Bhasker). Bhasker added that New Mexico has robust public policy concerns, as evidenced by its \"consumer-friendly framework,\" to include a consumer protection act which permits private rights of action for instances such as Bhasker's allegations against Financial Indemnity. Aug. 10 Tr. at 19:21-20:1 (Bhasker). The Court asked Bhasker whether the statutory structure of Montana's laws are too different to help the Court predict how the Supreme Court of New Mexico would decide this case.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Aug. 10 Tr. at 20:8-12 (Court). Bhasker replied that the Supreme Court of West Virginia in\n   <em>\n    Pristavec v. Westfield Insurance Co.\n   </em>\n   ignored the statutory structure's \"internal inconsistency with what an underinsured is\" and decided to calculate the offset from the total damages, rather than from the limits and liabilities, which is how New Mexico calculates the offset despite having the same UIM definition as West Virginia. Aug. 10 Tr. at 20:13-25 (Bhasker). Bhasker contended that, in answer to the Court's question, New Mexico's UIM statute and how New Mexico defines a UIM is similar to West Virginia.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Aug. 10 Tr. at 21:3-6 (Bhasker). Bhasker added that the statute in\n   <em>\n    Hardy v. Progressive Specialty Ins. Co.\n   </em>\n   , as Financial Indemnity acknowledged, is ambiguous, and therefore the Supreme Court of Montana concluded that the statute goes against public policy.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Aug. 10 Tr. at 21:3-6 (Bhasker). Bhasker implied that New Mexico's\n   <em>\n    Schmick\n   </em>\n   offset creates an absurd result that the Supreme Court of New Mexico could change.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Aug. 10 Tr. at 21:6-11 (Bhasker). The Court asked whether Bhasker's position requires the Court to do something that is inconsistent with\n   <em>\n    Schmick\n   </em>\n   .\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Aug. 10 Tr. at 21:12-14 (Court). Bhasker replied that the Court has the power \"to go that far .... However\n   ... the coverage does not have to be considered illusory for claims of deceptive and misleading practices to survive,\" which does not require the Court overrule\n   <em>\n    Schmick\n   </em>\n   .\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Aug. 10 Tr. at 21:15-21 (Bhasker). Bhasker concluded her arguments on the illusory coverage issue by reiterating her position that, in the Court's MOO, the Court recognized that there are two separate, viable claims: \"One, that minimum limits UIM coverage was illusory; and two, that defendant failed to meaningfully explain the circumstances in which it would not pay UIM benefits. Those two theories could apply at higher limits, and that's why the class definition also covers claims for those at higher limits.\" Aug. 10 Tr. at 22:4-12 (Bhasker).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-92\">\n   The Court asked whether Financial Indemnity had concluding thoughts on the illusory coverage issue.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Aug. 10 Tr. at 22:15-16 (Court). In response, Financial Indemnity questioned whether the Court could overrule\n   <em>\n    Schmick\n   </em>\n   and reasserted that, assuming the Court follows\n   <em>\n    Schmick\n   </em>\n   , Bhasker's theory falls apart for above minimum limits policyholders, because\n   <em>\n    Schmick\n   </em>\n   means that insureds recover only what is on their declarations page, which in both Bhasker and Financial Indemnity's $100,000.00 UIM limits hypotheticals is \"a grand total of $100,000\"; \"it's the way the law has worked in New Mexico since 1985.\" Aug. 10 Tr. at 23:2-16 (Hanover).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-93\">\n   The Court then asked whether Financial Indemnity wanted to argue the extracontractual damages issue.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Aug. 10 Tr. at 23:19-20 (Court). Financial Indemnity replied that, regarding extracontractual damages, New Mexico requires willful, wanton, malicious, reckless, oppressive, fraudulent, or in bad faith conduct; \"no punitive damages are awardable when the defendant has a justifiable basis for its conduct.\" Aug. 10 Tr. at 23:21-24:2 (Hanover). Financial Indemnity contended that it is thus entitled to judgment as a matter of law, because, according to Financial Indemnity, \"the only conduct that's well-pleaded in the complaint is that the plaintiff purchased an insurance policy with minimum limits UM/UIM coverage, she paid premiums on the coverage; FIC did not pay her UIM claim because the tortfeasor's $25,000 liability limits were offset on her UIM limits. And that's it.\" Aug. 10 Tr. at 24:3-11 (Hanover). Because Bhasker's Complaint neither alleges oral statements nor alludes to unattached documents, \"even if FIC were wrong about the offset, this could not rise as a matter of law to the level of willful, wanton, malicious, oppressive, fraudulent, or bad faith.\" Aug. 10 Tr. at 24:12-18 (Hanover). Financial Indemnity asserted that, although the Court denied the MTD because, in the absence of controlling New Mexico law, the Court predicted how the Supreme Court of New Mexico would rule, the Court also acknowledged out-of-state caselaw wherein courts ruled in the insurers' favor.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Aug. 10 Tr. at 24:19-25 (Hanover). Hence, contended Financial Indemnity, because this issue is a matter of first impression, and because there are several pending parallel matters wherein the parties have sought to certify questions to the Supreme Court of New Mexico, the Court, therefore, should grant judgment on Bhasker's request for extracontractual and punitive damages.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Aug. 10 Tr. at 24:25-25:14 (Hanover).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-94\">\n   The Court then asked to hear from Bhasker on the extracontractual damages question.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Aug. 10 Tr. at 25:15 (Court). Bhasker replied that the Court should grant a motion for judgment on the pleadings only when a complaint fails to state a claim for relief that is plausible on its face and when the factual allegation fail to raise the right to relief above the speculative level.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Aug. 10 Tr. at 25:21-24 (Bhasker). Bhasker asserted that the MJP does not recognize that the Court must accept\n   all facts as true and grant Bhasker all reasonable inferences.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Aug. 10 Tr. at 25:25-26:3 (Bhasker). Bhasker further contended that the issue whether Bhasker and proposed class members are entitled to punitive damages is separate from whether the class is entitled to \"out-of-pocket premium-based\" damages or \"benefit-of-the-bargain\" damages. Aug. 10 Tr. at 26:3-8 (Bhasker). Bhasker added that, because the Court is sitting in diversity,\n   <em>\n    Erie Railroad Co. v.

Bhasker added that the Complaint pleads factual allegations that, taken as true, support a claim against Financial Indemnity for dishonest business judgment, because\n   <em>\n    Weed Warrior\n   </em>\n   , which the Supreme Court of New Mexico decided in 2010, states that UIM coverage is illusory and that insureds do not carry UIM coverage at minimum limits.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Aug. 10 Tr. at 26:19-27:1 (Bhasker). Nevertheless, argued Bhasker, \"since Weed Warrior, defendant FIC continues to market, solicit, and ... sell and receive premiums for this illusory minimal UIM coverage.\" Aug. 10 Tr. at 27:2-5 (Bhasker). Bhasker asserted that this practice amounts to dishonest business judgement, which the Complaint details, and thus, the Court must accept such assertions as true and draw inferences in Bhasker's favor.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Aug. 10 Tr. at 27:6-10 (Bhasker). Bhasker adds that Financial Indemnity could have litigated this issue in its MTD \"but failed to do so.\" Aug. 10 Tr. at 27:13-16 (Bhasker).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-96\">\n   Bhasker argued that the discovery which she is seeking would support her theory that Financial Indemnity misled and deceived her and the proposed class with the knowledge that Bhasker and the proposed class will not receive their policy's benefits in circumstances that permit a complete offset.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Aug. 10 Tr. at 27:17-23 (Bhasker). Bhasker added that she is \"very confident\" that, because there was an offset in her case, \"there are other insureds out there who have been in the same situation ... whether it was minimal limits or at higher limits. It's not a hypothetical.\" Aug. 10 Tr. at 27:24-28:3 (Bhasker).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-97\">\n   The Court then asked to hear from Financial Indemnity.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Aug. 10 Tr. at 28:9 (Court). Financial Indemnity responded that it does not deny that it, together with \"the entire industry,\" has applied a\n   <em>\n    Schmick\n   </em>\n   offset to a lot of insureds over the last thirty years, resulting in stipulations where the policyholder does not recover under UIM, so Financial Indemnity does not see a problem with the number of people affected. Aug. 10 Tr. at 28:10-17 (Hanover). The question, contended Financial Indemnity, is whether such an offset is permissible at minimum limits, and, although the Court must assume as true the Complaint's factual allegations, those allegations include \"nothing that the plaintiff can point to that would possibly justify anything other than some sort of contract-based compensatory damages if it's ultimately determined that minimum limits coverage has no value.\" Financial Indemnity added that the MOO expressly leaves open Financial Indemnity's possible defenses to Bhasker's damages claims,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Aug. 10 Tr. at 29:2-7 (Hanover)(citing MOO at 76;\n   <em>\n    Bhasker v.

Bhasker directed the Court to her Complaint, specifically paragraphs 70, 87, 95, and 102, which, according to Bhasker, describe bad-faith conduct and assert Bhasker's entitlement to punitive damages.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Aug. 10 Tr. at 29:23-30:3 (Bhasker).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-99\">\n   The Court expressed its disinclination to overrule\n   <em>\n    Schmick\n   </em>\n   , but that it would need to decide whether Bhasker's position requires such a decision.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Aug. 10 Tr. at 30:8-15 (Court). The Court added that, although it intends to look at the Uniform Jury Instructions that Bhasker referenced and to relook at Bhasker's theory, the case does not seem to have the intentional or reckless element that New Mexico law requires for punitive damages.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Aug. 10 Tr. at 30:18-24 (Court).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-100\">\n   <strong>\n    5.\n    <em>\n     The October 26, 2018, Hearing\n    </em>\n    .\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-101\">\n   The Court held a hearing on October 26, 2018.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Transcript of Hearing at 1:22 (taken October 26, 2018)(\"Oct. 26 Tr.\").\n   <footnotemark>\n    10\n   </footnotemark>\n   During the hearing, which focused primarily on ongoing discovery disputes, Financial Indemnity alleged that Bhasker \"wanted documents that reach beyond minimum limits,\" but that the Honorable Jerry H. Ritter, Jr., United States Magistrate Judge for the District of New Mexico, to whom the Court has delegated discovery and other pretrial matters, denied Bhasker's motion to compel, because \"the case is clearly limited to m[inimum] limits UIM\" coverage. Oct. 26 Tr. at 28:15-18 (Hanover). Financial Indemnity stated that it agrees with Judge Ritter's ruling, although it conceded that the Court has not ruled on the issue.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Oct. 26 Tr. at 28:18-20 (Hanover). Financial Indemnity alleged that, because Bhasker did not object to Judge Ritter's ruling within the prescribed two-week period to object, \"that shouldn't be at issue.\" Oct. 26 Tr. at 28:22-24 (Hanover). What remains at issue, argued Financial Indemnity, is its motion for a protective order, because, in seeking to fulfil its obligations under rule 30(b)(6), Financial Indemnity desires to limit its corporate representative to the minimum limits UIM context, and Judge Ritter \"takes the opposite approach.\" Oct. 26 Tr. at 28:24-29:4 (Hanover). Financial Indemnity insisted that both it and Bhasker agree that Judge Ritter's position is inconsistent, albeit Bhasker, according to Financial Indemnity, disagrees with Judge Ritter's ruling on the motion to compel and not with his ruling on the motion for a protective order.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Oct. 26 Tr. at 29:5-9 (Hanover).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-102\">\n   The Court asked Bhasker whether she is ready to begin depositions in this case.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Oct. 26 Tr. at 29:15-16 (Court).

The Court then asked Bhasker whether the Court could hold this issue,\n   <em>\n    i.e.\n   </em>\n   , not compel anything further from Financial Indemnity on her illusory-at-greater-than-minimum-limits claim, until issuing a memorandum opinion and order on Financial Indemnity's MJP.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Oct. 26 Tr. at 30:1-7 (Court).

Quite obviously, the mere claim by employees of the same company that they have suffered a Title VII injury, or even a disparate-impact Title VII injury, gives no cause to believe that all their claims can productively be litigated at once. Their claims must depend upon a common contention -- for example, the assertion of discriminatory bias on the part of the same supervisor.

Behrend\n   </em>\n   applies to classwide damages. It is less clear that\n   <em>\n    Comcast Corp. v. Behrend\n   </em>\n   's language applies to the determination of individual damages. There are three ways that the Court could deal with\n   <em>\n    Comcast Corp. v. Behrend\n   </em>\n   and the determination of individual damage awards. First, the Court could decide that\n   <em>\n    Comcast Corp. v. Behrend\n   </em>\n   applies only to classwide damages and is not controlling at all in the determination of individual damages. Second, the Court could decide that everything that Justice Scalia said about classwide damages also applies to the determination of individual damages. Third, the Court could decide that Justice Scalia said some things relating to the determination of individual damages, but not the same things that apply to classwide damages. As to the first option, while much could be said of limiting Justice Scalia's opinion to classwide damages -- even from the language of the opinion and from the wording of the question presented -- the Court is reluctant to say that it has nothing to say that might be relevant to the determination of individual damages awards. Some of Justice Scalia's concerns about admissible evidence to determine damages -- whether classwide or individual damage awards -- still seem relevant to whether damages are classwide or individual. While Justice Scalia was not addressing the determination of individual damage awards, some of what he said -- and how he said it -- causes the Court to be cautious in determining a methodology for calculating individual damage awards. On the other hand, the Court is not convinced that it should or even can apply\n   <em>\n    Comcast Corp. v. Behrend\n   </em>\n   's language to the individual determination of damages as it does to classwide damages. The dissent stated that \"[r]ecognition that individual damages calculations do not preclude class\n   certification under Rule 23(b)(3) is well nigh universal.\"\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12697046\" index=\"342\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/569/27/\">\n    569 U.S. at 42\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12697046\" index=\"343\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/569/27/\">\n    133 S.Ct. 1426\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (Ginsburg, J., dissenting). Justice Scalia did not refute this proposition, and the Court has no reason to think the dissent's statement -- which is accurate -- does not remain good law. Accordingly, just because each plaintiff and class member may get a different amount and there has to be a separate calculation of each plaintiff's damages does not defeat class certification.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-179\">\n   What the Court thinks that\n   <em>\n    Comcast Corp. v. Behrend\n   </em>\n   says that is relevant to the individual determination of damages is threefold. First, at the class certification stage, the Court cannot ignore how individual damages, if any are appropriate, are to be decided. In other words, the Court cannot ignore the possible complexities of the individual damages determinations in making the predominance calculation. A class can have individual damage calculations, but the Court has to look at the issues of individual damages calculations at the class certification stage. Second, the methodology for all class members needs to be common or, if there are different methodologies for some plaintiffs and class members, the Court must take these differences into account at the class certification stage in the predominance analysis. In other words, if the Court is going to use different methodologies for different class members, it must decide: (i) whether these differences create questions affecting only individual members; and (ii) whether these individual questions predominate over the questions of law or fact common to the class. Third, even if the methodology is common to the class, the Court must decide whether it will operate in a consistent way for each individual class member. The law and methodology may be the same, but when applied to the class, they may create issues for one class member or group of class members that they do not create for other class members or groups. The predominance analysis must identify precisely the common issues and uncommon issues that application of the class methodology or methodologies raise, and then determine whether, in the total issue mix, the common issues predominate over the individual ones.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-180\">\n   A defendant's desire to assert individual counterclaims\n   <footnotemark>\n    15\n   </footnotemark>\n   does not typically defeat predominance.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Phillips Petrol.

But probably the parties would agree on a schedule of damages based on the cost of fixing or replacing class members' mold-contaminated washing machines.

R. Civ. P. 26(b)(1). Putting aside the last sentence's changes -- which the advisory committee's notes make clear was a housekeeping amendment to clarify that inadmissible evidence must still be relevant to be discoverable -- the 2000 amendments have two effects: (i) they narrow the substantive scope of discovery in the first sentence; and (ii) they inject courts into the process in the entirely new second sentence.\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-220\">\n   In 1978, the Committee published for comment a proposed amendment, suggested by the Section of Litigation of the American Bar Association, to refine the scope of discovery by deleting the \"subject matter\" language. This proposal was withdrawn, and the Committee has since then made other changes in the discovery rules to address concerns about overbroad discovery. Concerns about costs and delay of discovery have persisted nonetheless, and other bar groups have repeatedly renewed similar proposals for amendment to this subdivision to delete the \"subject matter\" language. Nearly one-third of the lawyers surveyed in 1997 by the Federal Judicial Center endorsed narrowing the scope of discovery as a means of reducing litigation expense without interfering with fair case resolutions. [Federal Judicial Center, T. Willging, J. Shapard, D. Stienstra, &amp; D. Miletich, Discovery and Disclosure Practice, Problems, and Proposals for Change] 44-45 (1997). The Committee has heard that in some instances, particularly cases involving large quantities of discovery, parties seek to justify discovery requests that sweep far beyond the claims and defenses of the parties on the ground that they nevertheless have a bearing on the \"subject matter\" involved in the action.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-221\">\n   The amendments proposed for subdivision (b)(1) include one element of these earlier proposals but also differ from these proposals in significant ways. The similarity is that the amendments describe the scope of party-controlled discovery in terms of matter relevant to the claim or defense of any party. The court, however, retains authority to order discovery of any matter relevant to the subject matter involved in the action for good cause. The amendment is designed to involve the court more actively in regulating the breadth of sweeping or contentious discovery. The Committee has been informed repeatedly by lawyers that involvement of the court in managing discovery is an important method of controlling problems of inappropriately broad discovery. Increasing the availability of judicial officers to resolve discovery disputes and increasing court management of discovery were both strongly endorsed by the attorneys surveyed by the Federal Judicial Center.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Discovery and Disclosure Practice\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    supra\n   </em>\n   , at 44. Under the amended provisions, if there is an objection that discovery goes beyond material relevant to the parties' claims or defenses, the court would become involved to determine whether the discovery is relevant to the claims or defenses and, if not, whether good cause exists for authorizing it so long as it is relevant to the subject matter of the action. The good-cause standard warranting broader discovery is meant to be flexible.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-222\">\n   <strong>\n    The Committee intends that the parties and the court focus on the actual claims and defenses involved in the action. The dividing line between information relevant to the claims and defenses and that relevant only to the subject matter of the action cannot be defined with precision. A variety of types of information not directly pertinent to the incident in suit could be relevant to the claims or defenses raised in a given action. For example, other incidents of the same type, or\n   </strong>\n   <strong>\n    involving the same product, could be properly discoverable under the revised standard. Information about organizational arrangements or filing systems of a party could be discoverable if likely to yield or lead to the discovery of admissible information. Similarly, information that could be used to impeach a likely witness, although not otherwise relevant to the claims or defenses, might be properly discoverable. In each instance, the determination whether such information is discoverable because it is relevant to the claims or defenses depends on the circumstances of the pending action.\n   </strong>\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-223\">\n   The rule change signals to the court that it has the authority to confine discovery to the claims and defenses asserted in the pleadings, and signals to the parties that they have no entitlement to discovery to develop new claims or defenses that are not already identified in the pleadings. In general, it is hoped that reasonable lawyers can cooperate to manage discovery without the need for judicial intervention. When judicial intervention is invoked, the actual scope of discovery should be determined according to the reasonable needs of the action. The court may permit broader discovery in a particular case depending on the circumstances of the case, the nature of the claims and defenses, and the scope of the discovery requested.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-224\">\n   The amendments also modify the provision regarding discovery of information not admissible in evidence. As added in 1946, this sentence was designed to make clear that otherwise relevant material could not be withheld because it was hearsay or otherwise inadmissible. The Committee was concerned that the \"reasonably calculated to lead to the discovery of admissible evidence\" standard set forth in this sentence might swallow any other limitation on the scope of discovery. Accordingly, this sentence has been amended to clarify that information must be relevant to be discoverable, even though inadmissible, and that discovery of such material is permitted if reasonably calculated to lead to the discovery of admissible evidence. As used here, \"relevant\" means within the scope of discovery as defined in this subdivision, and it would include information relevant to the subject matter involved in the action if the court has ordered discovery to that limit based on a showing of good cause.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-225\">\n   Finally, a sentence has been added calling attention to the limitations of subdivision (b)(2)(i), (ii), and (iii). These limitations apply to discovery that is otherwise within the scope of subdivision (b)(1). The Committee has been told repeatedly that courts have not implemented these limitations with the vigor that was contemplated.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    8 Federal Practice &amp; Procedure\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 2008.1 at 121. This otherwise redundant cross-reference has been added to emphasize the need for active judicial use of subdivision (b)(2) to control excessive discovery.\n   <em>\n    Cf.\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Crawford-El v.

R. Civ. P. 26 advisory committee's notes (emphasis added).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-227\">\n   One gets the impression from reading the advisory committee's notes that the amendment was not intended to exclude a delineable swath of material so much as it is intended to send a signal to district judges to become more hands-on in the process of regulating -- mostly limiting -- discovery on relevance grounds alone. The \"two effects\" of the 2000 amendments might, thus, be only one effect: directing district judges to roll up their sleeves and manage discovery, and to do so on a relevance\n   basis. The change in substantive scope from \"subject matter,\" to \"claim or defense,\" would, therefore, seem to \"add teeth\" to the relevance standard instead of narrowing that standard. It is not surprising that the Supreme Court of the United States of America and Congress would want to increase judicial presence: \"relevance\" is a liberal concept in the context of trial. Fed. R. Evid. 401 (\"Evidence is relevant if: (a) it has any tendency to make a fact more or less probable than it would be without the evidence; and (b) the fact is of consequence in determining the action.\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-228\">\n   Of course, regardless of the Court's musings about the rules, courts should also seek to give substantive content to amendments. Read literally, the rule does not permit parties to discover information relevant only to the claim or defense of another party; they must use discovery only to investigate their own claims and defenses. More problematically, however, the rule may prevent using the Federal Rules' compulsory discovery process to obtain \"background\" information not specifically relevant to any one claim or defense --\n   <em>\n    e.g.\n   </em>\n   , a plaintiff naming a pharmaceutical company as a defendant and then using discovery to educate itself generally about medicine, biochemistry, and the drug industry by using the defendant's expertise.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-229\">\n   In\n   <em>\n    In re Cooper Tire &amp; Rubber Co.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3653959\" index=\"392\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/568/1180/\">\n    568 F.3d 1180\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (10th Cir. 2009), the Tenth Circuit clarified that the 2000 Amendments to rule 26\"implemented a two-tiered discovery process; the first tier being attorney-managed discovery of information relevant to any claim or defense of a party, and the second being court-managed discovery that can include information relevant to the subject matter of the action.\"\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3653959\" index=\"393\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/568/1180/\">\n    568 F.3d at 1188\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

When the district court does intervene in discovery, it has discretion in determining what the scope of discovery should be. \"[T]he actual scope of discovery should be determined according to the reasonable needs of the action.

Dr. Yumukoglu does not specify which of the fifteen provisions of this section he feels Provident has violated, and after a review of the statute, the Court cannot perceive which subsection could have been violated under the fact alleged. At the very least, Dr. Yumukoglu has failed to comply with the pleading requirements of Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 8(a)(2). Rule 8(a)(2) requires that a civil complaint set forth \"a short and plain statement of the claim showing that the pleader is entitled to relief.\" Here, it is not clear either what Dr. Yumukoglu is claiming or to what relief he is entitled under \u00a7 56A-16-20.

The Court concludes that Bhasker uses the word \"illusory\" to signify both Financial Indemnity's valueless, minimum limits UIM policies and the alleged deceptive and misleading business practices that compelled insureds to purchase UIM policies above minimum limits. Accordingly, Bhasker's theory is that Financial Indemnity misled her and a class of insureds who, like Bhasker, purchased UIM coverage believing that they would receive the full UIM coverage reflected on their declarations pages, whether minimum limits or some greater figure.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-346\">\n   <strong>\n    A. BHASKER'S USE OF THE WORD \"ILLUSORY\" ENCOMPASSES DECEPTIVE AND MISLEADING BUSINESS PRACTICES.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-347\">\n   In the MJP, Financial Indemnity asserts that \"[t]his Court's Order indicates clearly that the illusory coverage claim raised by this case applies to minimum limits UIM coverage, not where any level of UIM limits above the minimum is at issue.\" MJP at 4. Financial Indemnity cites language from the Court's MOO which emphasizes, for example, that Bhasker's UIM insurance is illusory and that, because of New Mexico's offset law, \"there is virtually\n   <em>\n    no possible underinsured minimum limits claim\n   </em>\n   available\" to Bhasker and \"other similarly situated members of the class.\" MJP at 4 (quoting MOO at 3;\n   <em>\n    Bhasker v.

Financial Indemnity argues that Bhasker's illusory coverage theory does not apply outside the minimum limits UIM context, because, for example, \"if the insured has UIM limits of $50,000, $100,000 or any amount greater than $25,000, and the tortfeasor has $25,000 in bodily injury liability limits and that amount is offset, the injured insured\n   <em>\n    will\n   </em>\n   recover UIM benefits where the damages exceed the tortfeasor's limits.\" MJP at 5 (emphasis in MJP).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-348\">\n   Although the Court agrees with Financial Indemnity that coverage at higher-than-minimum limits is not illusory in the sense that such policies never confer a financial benefit to insureds, the Court maintains its position that Bhasker uses the word \"illusory\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    36\n   </footnotemark>\n   not only to refer to valueless, minimum limits UIM coverage but also as a synonym for the word \"deceptive,\"\n   <em>\n    i.e.\n   </em>\n   , not in reference to any particular legal doctrine, such as, for example, the doctrine of illusory coverage.\n   <footnotemark>\n    37\n   </footnotemark>\n   The Court noted in its MOO:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-349\">\n   Bhasker's references to \"illusory\" coverage indicates that she uses the term loosely. In her Complaint, she alleges that Financial Indemnity sold her \"illusory\" UIM coverage. Complaint \u00b6\u00b6 1, 46, 66, 68, at 1, 7, 13-14. She also alleges that the UIM coverage is illusory \"in part,\" Complaint \u00b6 67, at 14, and \"illusory in the event of a covered occurrence, as in this case, involving a minimally insured driver,\" Complaint \u00b6 32, at 5. Her inconsistent use of \"illusory\" is a good clue that her claims are not based on legal theories in which the coverage's \"illusory\" nature is an element necessary to prove. Rather, Bhasker seems to be arguing, generally, that her UM/UIM policy did not cover what she thought it would, in which case the UIM coverage was illusory in the sense that it appeared to be something it was not. According to her Complaint, she believes her policy's UIM component is worth nothing or close to nothing. Consequently, even if the Court agreed with Financial Indemnity that the policy's UIM coverage has some value, that designation would not foreclose Bhasker's claims that Financial Indemnity misled her about what the UM/UIM policy covered.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-350\">\n   MOO at 76-77;\n   <em>\n    Bhasker v.

Bhasker validated the above analysis during the August 10, 2018, hearing when she stated that \"this case is about defendant's misleading and deceptive business practices. Whether the coverage is illusory is a subissue to the overarching theme.\" Aug. 10 Tr. at 16:12-15 (Bhasker). The Court thus concludes that Financial Indemnity's characterization of Bhasker's illusory coverage theory as limited to minimum limits UIM coverage is unavailing.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-351\">\n   <strong>\n    B.

To begin, the gap theory, which New Mexico follows, is more favorable to insurers than the excess theory, because it caps the amount that insureds can recover and permits insurers to subtract the tortfeasors' liability limits from what insurers would otherwise owe to insureds. The Supreme Court of New Mexico acknowledged as much when it said: \"[W]e observe that the result reached by [jurisdictions that follow the excess theory] is more equitable in that the injured insured collects all proceeds for which, ostensibly, a premium has been paid and has his or her damages compensated more fully.\"\n   <em>\n    Schmick\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"864\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=1985-NMSC-073\">\n    1985-NMSC-073\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , \u00b6 31,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"711406\" index=\"865\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/nm/103/216/\">\n    103 N.M. 216\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"711406\" index=\"866\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/nm/103/216/\">\n    704 P.2d at 1100\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Nevertheless, the Supreme Court of New Mexico continued: \"New Mexico's uninsured/underinsured motorist statute, as presently enacted by our Legislature does not allow for such recovery.\"\n   <em>\n    Schmick\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"867\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=1985-NMSC-073\">\n    1985-NMSC-073\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , \u00b6 31,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"711406\" index=\"868\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/nm/103/216/\">\n    103 N.M. 216\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"711406\" index=\"869\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/nm/103/216/\">\n    704 P.2d at 1100\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

Despite the Court's prediction that the Supreme Court of New Mexico would not conclude that the\n   <em>\n    Schmick\n   </em>\n   offset renders higher-than-minimum-limits UIM coverage illusory, Bhasker may proceed on her theory that Financial Indemnity's misleading and deceptive business practices engendered for the proposed class -- to include insureds who purchased non-minimum limits coverage -- a reasonable expectation that UIM insurance provides additional coverage when the insured's damages exceed what is available from the tortfeasor.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-365\">\n   Bhasker's well-pled Complaint effectively extends her deceptive-and-misleading-business-practices theory to the proposed class. According to the Complaint, Bhasker asserts that she \"brings this action on her own behalf, and on behalf of the many insured around the state who have been deceived by Defendant's practices.\" Complaint \u00b6 4, at 2. The alleged deception includes Financial Indemnity's use of, according to Bhasker, an \"incorrect and inappropriate form from another state,\" which \"included ambiguous language that Plaintiff could purchase underinsured coverage in excess of her selected liability coverage limits.\" Complaint \u00b6 27, at 4 (citing Policy Application at 1-4). Bhasker submits several documents in support: (i) Bhasker's insurance application summarizing her policy,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Policy Application at 1-2; and (ii) a form that Bhasker signed that features a one-paragraph description of UM/UIM coverage,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   New Mexico Auto Supplement at 1 (Doc. 12-1)(\"Policy Form\"). That UM/UIM description reads:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-366\">\n   Under New Mexico Insurance Law (NMSA 1978 sec. 66-5[-]301), we are required to provide Uninsured and Underinsured Motorist coverage up to the Bodily Injury and Property Damage liability limits provided in this policy.\n   <em>\n    Uninsured/Underinsured Motorist bodily injury protects the name insured, resident relatives and occupants of uninsured vehicle if any of those persons sustain bodily injury in an accident for which the owner or operator of the motor vehicle that is legally liable, either does not have insurance, is a hit and run vehicle, or has insurance in an amount less than the limit of your Uninsured Motorist Coverage\n   </em>\n   .

If you choose to add together the limits of your coverage (stack) for each vehicle listed on the policy, your premium will be higher.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-367\">\n   Policy Form at 1 (emphasis added). Bhasker alleges that Financial Indemnity \"failed to state that the underinsured coverage is illusory in the event of a covered occurrence, as in this case, involving a minimally insured driver.\" Complaint \u00b6 33, at 5. Bhasker asserts that \"[a] purchase of higher limits, for example, at a premium of\n   $201 would yield a[n] ... underinsured indemnification to premium ration of 308/1, which compared to the purchase of minimal combined coverage for virtually no underinsured indemnification.\" Complaint \u00b6 34, at 6. Bhasker alleges that Financial Indemnity \"failed to act fairly, honestly, and in good faith when dealing with the Plaintiff [by] fail[ing] to fully inform Plaintiff of illusory underinsured coverage with a disproportionate premium/indemnification ratio when compared to the next tier of available coverage and to not materially misrepresent the terms of underinsured coverage.\" Complaint \u00b6 35, at 6. Bhasker also avers that Financial Indemnity \"misrepresented to [her] that she would benefit from underinsured coverage when they knew, or should have known, that the coverage was meaningless,\" and that Financial Indemnity made these misrepresentations \"knowingly and willfully, with the intent to deceive and induce the Plaintiff in purchasing underinsured coverage.\" Complaint \u00b6 29, at 5.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-368\">\n   Bhasker asserts that Financial Indemnity misled the proposed class in the same way.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Complaint \u00b6 52, at 9 (\"Upon information and belief, all underinsured applications and insurance policies issued by the Defendant to New Mexico policyholders are uniform in all respects material to the claims brought herein.\"); Complaint \u00b6 73, at 15 (alleging that Financial Indemnity \"failed to deliver the quality or quantity of services applied for and purchased by Plaintiff and other insured\" by not providing sufficiently clear \"applications and policies\"); Complaint \u00b6 83, at 17 (alleging that Financial Indemnity \"misrepresented the terms of the policy sold and provided to Plaintiff and other insureds\"); Complaint \u00b6 93, at 19 (stating that Financial Indemnity \"failed to provide underinsured coverage and/or denied underinsured claims for benefits to Plaintiff and other members of the Class\").

Only the damages flowing from the breach of contract ... are at issue.\"). The MJP discusses several cases where courts have concluded that minimum limits UIM coverage is not illusory, thereby suggesting, according to Financial Indemnity, that Financial Indemnity has a reasonable basis for its position that minimum limits UIM coverage provides value, \"and therefore did not act with the requisite animus to allow for a valid extra-contractual or punitive damages claim.\" MJP at 14.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-374\">\n   The Court does not dispute that Financial Indemnity had a reasonable basis for its position that minimum limits UIM coverage provides value;\n   <footnotemark>\n    41\n   </footnotemark>\n   however, regardless\n   whether minimum limits UIM coverage provides value, Financial Indemnity remains liable for material misrepresentations that compelled insureds to purchase its UIM coverage under the mistaken belief that such coverage entitles insureds to not only tortfeasors' liability limits but also to the full amount of UIM coverage reflected on insureds' declarations pages. If such misrepresentations were willful or reckless, as Bhasker's Complaint alleges, then a jury may properly consider whether punitive damages are appropriate. Hence, Financial Indemnity asserts in error that only damages for breach of contract are at issue.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   MJP at 12-13.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-375\">\n   Bhasker's Complaint includes facts sufficient to support a plausible claim for punitive damages, and, because the Court must consider her allegations as true, \"including factual allegations that the defendant was willful or reckless in its decision to continue to sell illusory coverage to consumers in this state,\" MJP Response at 11-12, the Court will not dismiss her punitive damage claims at this stage of the proceedings. The Court agrees with Bhasker that Financial Indemnity may possess information regarding whether it knew that it was violating New Mexico consumer protections laws, and the Court will therefore permit discovery on this issue. Discovery may produce evidence that Financial Indemnity knowingly misrepresented that it would pay out full UIM benefits in the majority of UIM claims situations, for example, by intentionally not disclosing New Mexico's status as an offset state. The Court agrees with Bhasker that such conduct \"is precisely the sort of information, which, if presented to a jury, could lead to an award of punitive damages.\" MJP Response at 14. If discovery proves out by a preponderance of the evidence that Bhasker's assertion that Financial Indemnity engaged in misleading and deceptive business practices, punitive damages are appropriate pursuant to New Mexico law.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Anderson Living Tr. v.

As stated above, the Court concludes that Financial Indemnity had a reasonable basis for enforcing the statutory offset as it did, and for asserting its position that minimum limits UIM coverage is neither illusory nor otherwise unlawful. The Court so concludes for three reasons: (i) because the illusory-coverage-at-minimum-limits question is one of first impression in New Mexico; (ii) because applying the statutory offset is a long-standing practice among New Mexico insurers; and (iii) because numerous out-of-state courts have held that a limits offset in circumstances similar to Bhasker's is not unlawful.

Securities Litigation\n    </em>\n    -- a statement that earlier versions of the treatise espoused). Thus, although the Tenth Circuit has not yet explicitly adopted the preponderance standard for fact-finding in class certification analyses, it most likely will, and the Court will employ that standard here.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"14\">\n   <p id=\"p-401\">\n    The Court will briefly address the other class-action types. Rule 23(b)(1) contains two subcategories of class action, (b)(1)(A) actions and (b)(1)(B) actions; a class need satisfy the requirements of only one to be certified.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    Fed. R. Civ. P. 23(b)(1). Class actions under (b)(1)(A) are designed to avoid the situation in which a defendant subject to suit by multiple plaintiffs is ordered to undertake incompatible courses of conduct as a result of the non-centralized nature of the adjudication.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    Fed. R. Civ. P. 23(b)(1)(A). \"Incompatible\" means more than simply inconsistent. A situation in which, for example, a defendant was ordered to pay ten thousand dollars to a plaintiff in one case, was ordered to pay ten million dollars to another plaintiff in an identical or similar case, and was found to not be at fault at all in yet another case, may be inconsistent, but it does not create \"incompatible standards of conduct for the party opposing the class.\" Fed. R. Civ. P. 23(b)(1)(A). Such alleged inconsistency is a normal and expected part of the system of individualized adjudication used by the judiciary to apply a uniform set of laws to varied factual settings. What (b)(1)(A) is designed to avoid is injunctive or declaratory \"whipsawing,\" in which,\n    <em>\n     e.g.\n    </em>\n    , one court orders a school district to close an underperforming inner-city school and bus its students to suburban schools, and another court orders the district to keep the school open and bus suburban students in to the school. Class actions under (b)(1)(B) serve a similar role, but apply when varying adjudications would result in practically -- rather than legally -- incompatible judgments.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    Fed. R. Civ. P. 23(b)(1)(B). Rule 23(b)(1)(B) applies when the defendant has possession or control of a\n    <em>\n     res\n    </em>\n    -- a pot of money or thing that constitutes the relief that the proposed class seeks -- and the relief sought by all the individual members of the proposed class would more than exhaust the\n    <em>\n     res\n    </em>\n    . For example, if a Ponzi scheme operator took ten billion dollars of investors' money, and, upon law enforcement's discovery of the scheme, had only six billion dollars remaining, then the individual investors' claims to recover their rightful share would add up to four billion dollars more than existed in the\n    <em>\n     res\n    </em>\n    . Thus, the court might certify a (b)(1)(B) class action to ensure that the custodian of the\n    <em>\n     res\n    </em>\n    does not pay out the entire\n    <em>\n     res\n    </em>\n    to the first investors to file suit, but, instead, distributes the\n    <em>\n     res\n    </em>\n    fairly among all investors.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-402\">\n    The two subcategories of (b)(1) class action have other things in common as well. Both exist, in a sense, for the benefit of the defendant -- at least relative to (b)(2) and (b)(3) class actions -- and are rarely brought, in part because plaintiffs have little incentive to bring them. In the (b)(1)(B) example, each investor hopes to recover the full value of his or her investment, not a 60% value, and thus is incentivized to file as an individual. In the (b)(1)(A) example, the plaintiff seeking to close down the school (i) does not care about the inconsistent obligations of the school district, and (ii) would rather not be joined in a class action with plaintiffs who want to keep the school open. Last, (b)(1) class actions, along with (b)(2) class actions, are mandatory: if certified, no person covered under the class definition may opt out of it or pursue his or her own individual claim. As such, no notice needs to be given to the class members that they are part of ongoing litigation, although the certifying court may elect to direct notice in appropriate circumstances.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    Fed. R. Civ. P. 23(c)(2)(A). Class actions under (b)(2) provide for injunctive or declaratory relief when a defendant has \"acted or refused to act on grounds that apply generally to the class.\" Fed. R. Civ. P. 23(b)(2).\n   </p>\n   <blockquote id=\"p-403\">\n    The key to the (b)(2) class is \"the indivisible nature of the injunctive or declaratory remedy warranted -- the notion that the conduct is such that it can be enjoined or declared unlawful only as to all of the class members or as to none of them.\" .... In other words, Rule 23(b)(2) applies only when a single injunction or declaratory judgment would provide relief to each member of the class. It does not authorize class certification when each individual class member would be entitled to a\n    <em>\n     different\n    </em>\n    injunction or declaratory judgment against the defendant. Similarly, it does not authorize class certification when each class member would be entitled to an individualized award of monetary damages.\n   </blockquote>\n   <p id=\"p-404\">\n    <em>\n     Wal-Mart\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5930529,12450492\" index=\"995\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/564/338/\">\n     564 U.S. at 360-61\n    </extracted-citation>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5930529,12450492\" index=\"996\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/564/338/\">\n     131 S.Ct. 2541\n    </extracted-citation>\n    (emphasis in original). The (b)(2) class action was invented for the purpose of facilitating civil rights suits, and much of its use is in that field today.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    <em>\n     Newberg\n    </em>\n    \u00a7 4:26. The (b)(2) class action allows civil rights litigants to advocate on behalf of all similarly situated individuals, such as a disenfranchised black voter representing a class of all black voters within an unconstitutionally drawn district or a jail inmate representing all inmates in an overcrowding case. Anyone familiar with the nation's seminal civil rights cases, however, knows that many of them are not brought as class actions, which raises a question:\n   </p>\n   <blockquote id=\"p-405\">\n    [W]hy would anyone ever bring one? ... Th[is] inquiry is generated because if an individual litigant pursues an individual case for injunctive relief and prevails, she can generally get all of the remedy that she needs without going through the hurdles of certifying a class. For example, to return to\n    <em>\n     Brown v. Board of Education\n    </em>\n    , once Linda Brown prevailed on her race discrimination claim, her remedy -- a desegregated school -- was hers to pursue. Although that remedy would affect many other persons not a part of her litigation, hence making class certification appropriate, there is no requirement that to secure that remedy, she had to file a class action.\n   </blockquote>\n   <blockquote id=\"p-406\">\n    Nonetheless, social change advocates tend to pursue class certification under Rule 23(b)(2) for several reasons. First, and perhaps most importantly, Linda Brown will likely graduate from school long before her case ends; if hers is simply an individual action, it will become moot and risk dismissal. Class certification, however, constitutes an exception to the mootness doctrine in certain circumstances. Second, the scope of the plaintiff's relief is likely augmented by certifying a class. It is arguable that all that Linda Brown would have been able to secure as a remedy for her individual claim was a desegregated school for herself, not for students throughout the entire school district; there is some relationship between the scope of the class and the scale of the remedy. Third, it is often the case that the attorneys pursuing civil rights actions are doing so as public interest lawyers paid by an organization like the NAACP Legal Defense Fund or the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU); they may therefore have a financial incentive to pursue a class's case rather than a series of individual cases as they have limited resources, and the economies of scale may argue for a class action suit. Most generally, many civil rights cases are brought as class suits because the attorneys and clients pursuing them conceptualize their efforts in group, not individual, terms. Thus, while an individual civil rights plaintiff might be able to secure the relief that she seeks without a (b)(2) class, a series of factors may encourage the pursuit of one.\n   </blockquote>\n   <p id=\"p-407\">\n    <em>\n     Newberg\n    </em>\n    \u00a7 4:26 (footnotes omitted). Like (b)(1) class actions, (b)(2) class actions are mandatory -- individuals covered under the class definition may not opt out -- and do not require notice to be given to the class.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    Fed. R. Civ. P. 23(c)(2)(A).\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"15\">\n   <p id=\"p-408\">\n    Generally speaking, counterclaims, even common ones, are not permitted against absent class members at all.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"16\">\n   <p id=\"p-409\">\n    Limitations defenses are an especially common breed of affirmative defense. Limitations defenses generally present common questions, rather than individual ones, because a limitations defense's merits rest on two facts: (i) the date on which the claim accrued; and (ii) the date on which the action was filed. Fact (ii) is a common issue in virtually every class action, because the entire class gets credit for the filing date of the class action complaint. Fact (i) may not be truly common, but it might be, if, for example, the discovery rule delays accrual of a claim until the cause of action is discovered, and all class members' causes of action are discovered at the same time, or if a single act by the defendant breached contracts with all class members at once. Even if the question is individual -- for example, if a class is defined as only encompassing preexisting filed claims, or if the discovery rule might delay the accrual of the claim for some class members but not others -- it still typically does not defeat predominance.\n   </p>\n   <blockquote id=\"p-410\">\n    Although a necessity for individualized statute-of-limitations determinations invariably weighs against class certification under Rule 23(b)(3), we reject any per se rule that treats the presence of such issues as an automatic disqualifier. In other words, the mere fact that such concerns may arise and may affect different class members differently does not compel a finding that individual issues predominate over common ones. As long as a sufficient constellation of common issues binds class members together, variations in the sources and application of statutes of limitations will not automatically foreclose class certification under Rule 23(b)(3). Predominance under Rule 23(b)(3) cannot be reduced to a mechanical, single-issue test.\n   </blockquote>\n   <p id=\"p-411\">\n    <em>\n     Waste Mgmt. Holdings, Inc. v.

Judge Easterbrook then discussed how variations in tires defeat class treatment:\n   </p>\n   <blockquote id=\"p-422\">\n    Because these claims must be adjudicated under the law of so many jurisdictions, a single nationwide class is not manageable. Lest we soon see a Rule 23(f) petition to review the certification of 50 state classes, we add that this litigation is not manageable as a class action even on a statewide basis. About 20% of the Ford Explorers were shipped without Firestone tires. The Firestone tires supplied with the majority of the vehicles were recalled at different times; they may well have differed in their propensity to fail, and this would require sub-subclassing among those owners of Ford Explorers with Firestone tires. Some of the vehicles were resold and others have not been; the resales may have reflected different discounts that could require vehicle-specific litigation. Plaintiffs contend that many of the failures occurred because Ford and Firestone advised the owners to underinflate their tires, leading them to overheat. Other factors also affect heating; the failure rate (and hence the discount) may have been higher in Arizona than in Alaska. Of those vehicles that have not yet been resold, some will be resold in the future (by which time the tire replacements may have alleviated or eliminated any discount) and some never will be resold. Owners who wring the last possible mile out of their vehicles receive everything they paid for and have claims that differ from owners who sold their Explorers to the second-hand market during the height of the publicity in 2000. Some owners drove their SUVs off the road over rugged terrain, while others never used the \"sport\" or \"utility\" features; these differences also affect resale prices.\n   </blockquote>\n   <blockquote id=\"p-423\">\n    Firestone's tires likewise exhibit variability; that's why fewer than half of those included in the tire class were recalled. The tire class includes many buyers who used Firestone tires on vehicles other than Ford Explorers, and who therefore were not advised to underinflate their tires.\n   </blockquote>\n   <blockquote id=\"p-424\">\n    ....\n   </blockquote>\n   <blockquote id=\"p-425\">\n    When courts think of efficiency, they should think of market models rather than central-planning models.\n   </blockquote>\n   <blockquote id=\"p-426\">\n    Our decision in\n    <em>\n     Rhone-Poulenc Rorer\n    </em>\n    made this point, and it is worth reiterating: only \"a decentralized process of multiple trials, involving different juries, and different standards of liability, in different jurisdictions\" (51 F.3d [1293] at 1299 [ (1995) ] ) will yield the information needed for accurate evaluation of mass tort claims.\n   </blockquote>\n   <blockquote id=\"p-427\">\n    ....\n   </blockquote>\n   <blockquote id=\"p-428\">\n    No matter what one makes of the decentralized approach as an original matter, it is hard to adopt the central-planner model without violence not only to Rule 23 but also to principles of federalism.

Thus, the Eleventh Circuit's test is truer to rule 23's text than Judge Posner's. \"Predominate,\" the word that rule 23 uses, means \"[t]o be of greater quantity or importance; preponderate.\"\n    <em>\n     Predominate\n    </em>\n    , The American Heritage Dictionary of the English Language, (5th ed. 2019), https://www.ahdictionary.com/word/search.html?q=predominate (last visited January 22, 2019). Rule 23's text thus arguably suggests a direct comparison of common and individual issues, and not -- as Judge Posner suggests -- an indirect comparison that decides the predominance question on the basis of a fancy economic analysis. There are, however, two other rule 23 provisions whose impact on predominance is not often discussed: (i) the issue class-action clause,\n    <em>\n     see\n    </em>\n    Fed. R. Civ. P. 23(c)(4) (\"When appropriate, an action may be brought or maintained as a class action with respect to particular issues.\"); and (ii) the subclassification clause,\n    <em>\n     see\n    </em>\n    Fed. R. Civ. P. 23(c)(5) (\"When appropriate, a class may be divided into subclasses that are each treated as a class under this rule.\"). These provisions are unfortunate for those who wish to read rule 23 as containing the seeds of its own destruction. Rule 23(c)(4) allows for adjudication of common issues, even if these issues do not add up to a common claim. Rule 23(c)(5) allows for collective adjudication, even if it falls short of being completely \"classwide\" adjudication. Judge Posner's test explicitly admits of subclasses and issue classes. Even if it had not allowed for these classes, their impact in Judge Posner's analysis would be obvious: the district court uses the tools of subclassification and issue classification -- along with other management tools, such as polyfurcation -- to design a class-action management plan, and then decide whether the plan is more or less efficient than separate trials.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-446\">\n    The impact that these provisions have on the Eleventh Circuit's approach is less clear. The Eleventh Circuit's best discussion of subclasses comes from\n    <em>\n     Sacred Heart Health Systems, Inc. v. Humana Military Healthcare Services, Inc.\n    </em>\n    :\n   </p>\n   <blockquote id=\"p-447\">\n    [W]e cannot accept the district court's proposal to use subclasses corresponding to the hospitals' six categories of payment clauses. We recognize the long and venerated practice of creating subclasses as a device to manage complex class actions, but the six subclasses proposed here mask a staggering contractual variety. The sixth proposed subclass -- a miscellaneous residue of numerous payment clauses that are insusceptible of ready classification -- alone is fatal to predominance. When this \"potpourri\" subclass, as Humana has termed it, is broken down into its disparate component parts, the illusion of uniformity gives way to nearly thirty subclasses.\n   </blockquote>\n   <blockquote id=\"p-448\">\n    Common sense tells us that \"[t]he necessity of a large number of subclasses may indicate that common questions do not predominate,\"\n    <em>\n     Manual for Complex Litigation\n    </em>\n    \u00a7 21.23 (4th ed. 2004);\n    <em>\n     see also\n    </em>\n    <em>\n     Harding v.

Here, the necessary recourse to a \"miscellaneous\" subclass readily indicates the lack of a predominant question.\n   </blockquote>\n   <blockquote id=\"p-449\">\n    Ultimately, after examining the many individualized payment clauses contained in the network agreements, we perceive a \"distinct possibility that there was a breach of contract with some class members, but not with other class members.\" Subclasses are no answer to this problem, meaning that the efficiency of a class action will be lost entirely unless the hospitals are allowed \"to stitch together the strongest contract case based on language from various [contracts], with no necessary connection to their own contract rights. The hospitals, however, may not lawfully \"amalgamate\" their disparate claims in the name of convenience.

Yet, from the record before us, an abridgment of the defendant's rights seems the most likely result of class treatment. By glossing over the striking differences in the material terms of the agreements, the district court created an \"unnecessarily high risk,\" of such unlawful results, and thereby abused its discretion.\n   </blockquote>\n   <p id=\"p-450\">\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4226143\" index=\"1036\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/601/1159/#p1170\">\n     601 F.3d at 1176\n    </extracted-citation>\n    (citations omitted). These statements imply that, but for the sixth \"category\" of payment clauses -- really a catchall for all contracts that did not fit into one of the five real categories -- the class would be certifiable. The only \"abridgement of the defendant's rights\" that the district court's plan would produce would be the \" 'amalgamat[ion]' \" of different contractual language into a single category -- the sixth category.\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4226143\" index=\"1037\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/601/1159/#p1170\">\n     601 F.3d at 1176\n    </extracted-citation>\n    . That case, thus, leaves open the question whether subclassification and issue certification can aid in satisfying predominance, or if these techniques are separate from the predominance inquiry.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-451\">\n    The Fifth Circuit staked out a clear answer to this question in its much-discussed\n    <em>\n     Castano v.

Reading rule 23(c)(4) as allowing a court to sever issues until the remaining common issue predominates over the remaining individual issues would eviscerate the predominance requirement of rule 23(b)(3) ; the result would be automatic certification in every case where there is a common issue, a result that could not have been intended.\n   </blockquote>\n   <p id=\"p-453\">\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1793430\" index=\"1039\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/84/734/#p741\">\n     84 F.3d at\n    </extracted-citation>\n    745 n.21 (citations omitted). This logic is hardly unassailable. Namely, the result of reading rules 23(c)(4) and (c)(5) as bearing on the predominance inquiry would\n    <em>\n     not\n    </em>\n    be \"automatic certification in every case where there is a common issue,\" because superiority must still be satisfied.\n    <em>\n     Castano v.

If a proposed class action is superior --\n    <em>\n     e.g.\n    </em>\n    , if it lacks the value to be brought on an individual basis -- and individual issues can be pared away via rules 23(c)(4) and (c)(5) then it is not clear why certification \"could not have been intended\" by the rule.\n    <em>\n     Castano v.

Moreover, it is a poor reading of the rule's text. Presumably, even if rules 23(c)(4) and (c)(5) are mere \"housekeeping rule[s],\" they would still alleviate \"likely difficulties in managing a class action.\"\n    <em>\n     Castano v. Am.

The Fifth Circuit's approach attracted the adherence of a revered jurist on the Fourth Circuit -- although not the Fourth Circuit itself. The Honorable Paul V.

According to the majority, to require the certified issue in this case to predominate over the individualized issues in the action as a whole ignores Rule 23(c)(4)(A), which it appears to view as a fourth avenue for class certification, on equal footing with Rules 23(b)(1), 23(b)(2), and 23(b)(3). In doing so, the majority glorifies Rule 23(c)(4)(A) -- a housekeeping rule that authorizes a court to certify for class treatment \"particular issues\" in a case that otherwise satisfies Rule 23(a) and 23(b) -- with the effect of materially rewriting Rule 23 such that Rule 23(b)(3)'s requirements no longer need be applied to \"[a]n action,\"\n    <em>\n     see\n    </em>\n    Fed.

The real import of the rule is that it will likely lead to more \"proportionality\" objections and more disputes that the district courts will have to resolve, which is what the drafters apparently intended. It is unclear how more judicial involvement in discovery can be squared with a federal court docket that is at a breaking point already. It is also unclear what was wrong with the old goal of discovery of being largely self-executing. The new rules also require attorneys to learn the new vocabulary of \"proportionality,\" delete their old stock legal sections from their briefs, and rewrite these new sections to use the correct language.

If the Court adheres too rigidly to Tenth Circuit case law, ignoring changes undergone by a state's law in the ensuing years, then parties litigating state-law claims will be subject to a different body of substantive law, depending on whether they litigate in state court or federal court. This result frustrates the purpose of\n    <em>\n     Erie\n    </em>\n    , which held that federal courts must apply state court interpretations of state law, rather than their own, in part so that parties achieve a consistent result regardless of the forum. This consideration pulls the Court toward according Tenth Circuit precedent less weight and according state court decisions issued in the ensuing years more weight. On the other hand, when the state law is unclear, it is desirable for there to at least be uniformity among federal judges as to its proper interpretation. Otherwise, different federal judges within the same circuit -- or even the same district, as district courts' decisions are not binding, even upon themselves -- would be free to adopt differing interpretations of a state's law. This consideration pulls the Court towards a stronger respect for vertical stare decisis, because a Tenth Circuit decision on point -- regardless whether it accurately reflects state law -- at least provides consistency at the federal level, so long as federal district judges are required to follow it.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-478\">\n    The Court must decide how to weigh Tenth Circuit case law against more-recent state court decisions, choosing a point on the spectrum between the two extremes: rigidly adhering to Tenth Circuit precedent unless there is intervening case law directly on point from the state's highest court, on one end; and independently interpreting the state law, regarding the Tenth Circuit precedent as no more than persuasive authority, on the other. In striking this balance, the Court notes that it is generally more concerned about systemic inconsistency between the federal courts and the state courts than it is about inconsistency among federal judges. Judges, even those within a jurisdiction with ostensibly identical governing law, sometimes interpret and apply the law differently from one another; this inconsistency is part and parcel of a common-law judicial system. More importantly, litigants seeking to use forum selection to gain a substantive legal advantage cannot easily manipulate such inconsistency: cases are assigned randomly to district judges in this and many federal districts; and, regardless, litigants cannot know for certain how a given judge will interpret the state law, even if they could determine the identity of the judge pre-filing or pre-removal. All litigants know in advance is that whomever federal district judge they are assigned will look to the entirety of the state's common law in making his or her determination -- the same as a state judge would. Systemic inconsistency between the federal courts and state courts, on the other hand, not only threatens the principles of federalism, but litigants may more easily manipulate the inconsistency. When the Tenth Circuit issues an opinion interpreting state law, and the state courts subsequently shift away from that interpretation, litigants -- if the district courts strictly adhere to the Tenth Circuit opinion -- have a definite substantive advantage in choosing the federal forum over the state forum, or vice versa.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-479\">\n    The Court further notes that district courts may be in a better position than the Tenth Circuit to be responsive to changes in state law. Tenth Circuit decisions interpreting a particular state's law on a specific issue are further apart in time than the collective district courts' decisions are. More importantly, the Tenth Circuit does not typically address such issues with the frequency that the state's courts themselves do. Accordingly, Tenth Circuit precedent can lag behind state law developments -- developments that the district courts may be nimble enough to perceive and adopt. Additionally, much of the benefit of having a consistent Tenth Circuit-wide interpretation of a particular state's law is wasted. Other than Oklahoma, every state encompassed by the Tenth Circuit contains only one federal judicial district, and there is relatively little need for federal judges in Wyoming and Kansas to have a uniform body of New Mexico law to which to look. Last, the Court notes, respectfully, that district courts may be in a better position than the Tenth Circuit to develop expertise on the state law of the state in which they sit. Every federal judicial district in the nation, except the District of Wyoming, covers at most one state. It is perhaps a more workable design for each district court to keep track of legal developments in the state law of its own state(s) than it is for the Tenth Circuit to monitor separate legal developments in eight states. The Tenth Circuit used to follow this rationale in applying a clearly erroneous standard of review to district judge decisions of state law with no controlling state supreme court precedent.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    <em>\n     Weiss v. United States\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1560510\" index=\"1077\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/787/518/#p525\">\n     787 F.2d 518\n    </extracted-citation>\n    , 525 (10th Cir. 1986) ;\n    <em>\n     Rawson v.

Since the mid-1980s, however, the Tenth Circuit has abandoned that rationale and applied a de novo standard of review to district judge decisions applying state law with no governing state supreme court precedent.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    <em>\n     Rawson v.

The Court regrets the Tenth Circuit's retreat from the clearly erroneous standard.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-480\">\n    Having outlined the relevant considerations, the Court concludes that the proper stance on vertical stare decisis in the context of federal court interpretations of state law is as follows: the Tenth Circuit's cases are binding as to their precise holding -- what the state law was on the day the opinion was published -- but lack the positive precedential force that its cases interpreting a federal statute or the Constitution of the United States of America possess. A district court considering a state law issue after the publication of a Tenth Circuit opinion on point may not come to a contrary conclusion based\n    <em>\n     only\n    </em>\n    on state court cases available to and considered by the Tenth Circuit, but it may come to such a conclusion based on intervening state court cases.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-481\">\n    When interpreting state law, the Tenth Circuit does not and cannot issue a case holding that\n    <em>\n     x\n    </em>\n    is the law in New Mexico; it holds that the\n    <em>\n     proper interpretation\n    </em>\n    of New Mexico law, at the time the opinion is released, is\n    <em>\n     x\n    </em>\n    . Its holdings are descriptive and not prescriptive -- interpretive and not normative. Because federal judicial opinions lack independent substantive force on state law issues, but possess such force regarding federal law issues, the Court concludes that the following is not an unfair summary of the judicial interpretive process: (i) when interpreting federal law, the federal appellate courts consider the existing body of law, and then issue a holding that both reflects and influences the body of law; that holding subsequently becomes a part of the body of law; but (ii) when interpreting state law, the federal appellate courts consider the existing body of law, and then issue a holding that only reflects the body of law; that holding does not subsequently become a part of the body of law. The federal district courts are bound to conclude that the Tenth Circuit's reflection of the then-existing body of law was accurate. The question is whether they should build a doctrine atop the case and use the existence of the Tenth Circuit's case to avoid any responsibility to independently consider the whole body of state law that exists when the time comes that diversity litigants raise the issue in their courtrooms. Giving such effect to the Tenth Circuit's interpretations of state law is at tension with\n    <em>\n     Erie\n    </em>\n    , giving independent substantive effect to federal judicial decisions --\n    <em>\n     i.e.\n    </em>\n    , applying federal law -- in a case brought in diversity.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-482\">\n    The purpose of\n    <em>\n     Erie\n    </em>\n    is well-known and simple, and the Court should not complicate it beyond recognition: it is that the same substantive law governs litigants' cases regardless whether they are brought in a federal or state forum. For simplicity's sake, most courts have settled on the formulation that \"the federal court must attempt to predict how the states' highest court would rule if confronted with the issue.\"\n    <em>\n     Moore's\n    </em>\n    \u00a7 124.22[3] (citing\n    <em>\n     Comm'r v.

This statement may not be the most precise formulation if the goal is to ensure identical outcomes in state and federal court -- the Honorable Milton I. Shadur, former United States District Judge for the Northern District of Illinois, looks to state procedural rules to determine in which state appellate circuit the suit would have been filed were it not in federal court, and then applies the state law as that circuit court interprets it,\n    <em>\n     see\n    </em>\n    <em>\n     Abbott Labs. v.

While cases interpreting federal law become more powerful over time -- forming the groundwork for doctrines, growing upward from one application (Congress may create a national bank) to many (Congress may set quotas on wheat-growing for personal consumption), expanding outward from the general (states must grant criminal jury trials) to the specific (the jury need not be twelve people, nor must it be unanimous) -- federal cases interpreting state law often become stale. New state court cases -- even when not directly rebuking the federal court's statement of law -- alter the common-law legal landscape with their dicta, their insinuations, and their tone. The Supreme Court, which picks its cases sparingly and for maximum effect, almost never grants certiorari to resolve issues of state law.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-484\">\n    The Court's views on\n    <em>\n     Erie\n    </em>\n    , of course, mean little if the Tenth Circuit does not agree.

Thus, when a panel of this Court has rendered a decision interpreting state law, that interpretation is binding on district courts in this circuit, and on subsequent panels of this Court, unless an intervening decision of the state's highest court has resolved the issue.\n   </blockquote>\n   <p id=\"p-486\">\n    <em>\n     Wankier v.

The Court is partially concerned with the age of\n    <em>\n     Schmick\n    </em>\n    and the trend of New Mexico insurance law over the years since 1985. The Court has thought long and hard whether the current Supreme Court of New Mexico would do the same as it did thirty-four years ago. The Court is not sure that the current Supreme Court of New Mexico would do the same, but as a federal district court, there are rules that restrict its predictions. First, although the Supreme Court of New Mexico decided\n    <em>\n     Schmick\n    </em>\n    in 1985, it has cited\n    <em>\n     Schmick\n    </em>\n    twenty-seven times since then. There is nothing to indicate that the Supreme Court of New Mexico is looking for an occasion or an excuse to reconsider\n    <em>\n     Schmick\n    </em>\n    . Indeed, it has reaffirmed its central message as recently as 2013: \"The statutory offset for a tortfeasor's liability coverage is contained within the formula we announced in\n    <em>\n     Schmick\n    </em>\n    for computing the underinsurance benefits due an insured.\"\n    <em>\n     State Farm Mut.

Furthermore, it is the majority rule and the better rule, because it provides clarity to insurers and prevents insureds from receiving recovery greater than that for which they paid. As the Supreme Court of New Mexico stated in\n    <em>\n     State Farm Mutual Automobile Insurance Co. v.

It is not clear, from its opinion, that the Supreme Court of New Mexico imagined all the scenarios in which UIM coverage may pay, and the Court agrees with Financial Indemnity that such scenarios -- for example, where the tortfeasor has an out-of-state policy with lower bodily injury liability minimum limits than in the state policy, or where there are multiple injured parties in an accident, such that no single policy holder will recover the entirety of the tortfeasor's liability limits, or where the insured receives less than the tortfeasor's policy limits because of a contractual exclusion for punitive damages, in which case, under New Mexico law, the insurer may not offset the full amount of the tortfeasor's liability limits -- are persuasive. The Court, however, does not write on a clean slate and must therefore conclude that\n    <em>\n     Weed Warrior\n    </em>\n    forecloses Financial Indemnity's claims on the illusory coverage issue.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-524\">\n    The Court is cognizant that its conclusions may affect how litigation unfolds. Bhasker may later argue that the Court has already determined that the UIM portion of the UM/UIM coverage is worth zero dollars; that the Court has already determined that the UIM portion is illusory; and that, therefore -- for example -- the policy is void and should be rescinded. The Court, however, is not making any decisions about damages or remedies, but is trying to give Bhasker and Financial Indemnity information as much as possible to help them shape how to proceed. The Court does not necessarily foreclose any of Financial Indemnity's arguments on damages or remedies.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n </opinion>\n</casebody>\n"
