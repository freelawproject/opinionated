BACKGROUND\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   This Medicare Secondary Payer Act (\"MSP Act\"), 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1395y(b), private action originates from conditional payments of medical expenses or supplies that Plaintiff alleges its assignor Florida Health Care Plus (\"FHCP\") made between \"April 29, 2012 (the date of the collision) and July 26, 2012\" on behalf of patient F.C. following a motor vehicle accident (DE 36, \u00b6 69, 74). Plaintiff alleges that, as assignee of FHCP, it first made a demand for reimbursement to Defendant Kingsway Amigo Insurance Company (\"Kingsway\") \"by letter dated November 23, 2015\" (\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 82). Plaintiff does not allege that it made any demands for reimbursement earlier than this date (\n   <em>\n    see id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 64-83).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   Plaintiff filed its Second Amended Complaint in this case (DE 36) on August 17, 2016. The Court denied in part Kingsway's Motion to Dismiss the Second Amended Complaint (DE 62) on September 29, 2017; and denied Kingsway's Motion to Dismiss for Lack of Jurisdiction (DE 84) on May 17, 2018. Thereafter, on August 7, 2018, Kingsway brought its Motion for Judgment on the Pleadings (DE 90), which is the subject of this Order, in which Kingsway argues that 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1395y(b)(2)(B)(vi), a requirement that Plaintiff did not comply with, applies to this case and so renders Plaintiff's claim stale.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   <strong>\n    II.

Three-Year Limitation Requirement\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   As Kingsway argues, the Medicare Secondary Payers Act (\"MSP Act\") plainly and unambiguously requires the government to, as a prerequisite for seeking to recover conditional payments from a primary payer, make a request for payment to the primary payer within three years from the date on which the item or services were furnished to the Medicare enrollee. 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1395y(b)(2)(B)(vi) ;\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   <em>\n    MSPA Claims 1, LLC v.

Plaintiff makes no argument that it complied with the three-year limitation requirement, or that judgment on the pleadings is inappropriate because of the existence of evidence supporting its compliance with the requirement.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   Plaintiff argues that the three-year limitations requirement, \u00a7 1395y(b)(2)(B)(vi), is inapposite to cases like this one, because (1) \"the plain meaning of [the provision] grants [a plaintiff] the right to override claims filing requirements required by primary plans, [but does] not impose a limitations period;\" (2) the legislative history confirms this; and (3) the Court should grant\n   <em>\n    Chevron\n   </em>\n   deference to\n   <extracted-citation index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%20411.24\">\n    42 C.F.R. \u00a7 411.24\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (f)(1) (DE 117, at 2, 8). In support of its first point, Plaintiff argues that the permissive word \"may\" means that the provision is \"not mandatory\" (DE 117, at 4), but this is nonsensical: the word \"may\" plainly refers to United States's option as to whether to seek to recover conditional payments at all in a given case, not that \"3-year period\" actually means \"4-year period\" or \"40-year period.\" Indeed, as Kingsway has repeatedly noted (\n   <em>\n    see, e.g.\n   </em>\n   , DE 106, at 7), the legislative history Plaintiff cites does nothing to counter this (\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   DE 117, at 7 (quoting H.R. Rep. No. 105-149, at 1358-59 (1997) (Conf. Rep.) (contrasting the \"current law\" prior to amendment in which an entity seeking to recover conditional payments needed to abide by an insurance plan's filing requirements, with the amended provision allowing recovery of payments as long as a request for payment is made \"within 3 years\") ). Finally, the regulation Plaintiff cites,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"6\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%20411.24\">\n    42 C.F.R. \u00a7 411.24\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (f)(1) (DE 117, at 8) is in no way inconsistent with the plain language of \u00a7 1395y(b)(2)(B)(vi).\n   <extracted-citation index=\"7\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%20411.24\">\n    42 C.F.R. \u00a7 411.24\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (f)(1) (\"CMS may recover without regard to any claims filing requirements\n   <em>\n    that the insurance program or plan imposes.\n   </em>\n   \" (emphasis added) ). Therefore, the Court concludes that Plaintiff has not supplied any coherent reason whatsoever why \u00a7 1395y(b)(2)(B)(vi) is inapplicable to this case, but goes to great lengths to attempt to confuse the issue.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   <strong>\n    III. CONCLUSION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   Plaintiff MSPA Claims 1, LLC did not request payment from Defendant Kingsway Amigo Insurance Company within three years after the services in question were furnished, in contravention of the Medicare Secondary Payers Act's three-year limitation requirement, 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1395y(b)(2)(B)(vi), which applies to any plaintiff seeking to recover conditional payments under the Act.

The Medicare Act consists of five parts, the first two of which \"create, describe, and regulate traditional fee-for-service, government-administered Medicare.\"\n   <em>\n    In re Avandia Mktg.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3902508\" index=\"13\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/685/353/\">\n    685 F.3d 353\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 357 (3d Cir. 2012). The Third part - Part C - outlines the Medicare Advantage Program, and it is this Section that pertains to the case at hand.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   In 1980, Congress amended the Medicare Act to add the Medicare Secondary Payer Act (\"MSPA\") in an attempt to reduce the burden of rising costs placed on the federal government by the Medicare program.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Omnibus Reconciliation Act of 1980, Pub.

The MSPA is codified at 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1395y and provides that Medicare cannot pay medical expenses when \"payment has been made or can reasonably be expected to be made under ... an automobile or liability insurance policy or plan (including a self-insured plan) or no fault insurance.\" 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1395y(b)(2)(A)(ii). Subsection 1395y(b)(2)(B) gives \"[t]he Secretary\" authority to make conditional payments \"if a primary plan ... has not made or cannot reasonably be expected to make payment with respect to such item or service promptly,\" but such payment \"shall be conditioned on reimbursement.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"15\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=94%20Stat.%202599\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   at (b)(1)(B)(i).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   The MSPA includes an enforcement mechanism in cases where Medicare makes conditional payments to an enrollee covered by a primary plan. The Act provides that \"a primary plan, and an entity that receives payment from a primary plan, shall reimburse the appropriate Trust Fund for any payment made by the Secretary under this subchapter with respect to an item or service if it is demonstrated that such primary plan has or had a responsibility to make payment with respect to such item or service.\" 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1395y(b)(2)(B)(ii). The Act also provides a cause action for \"the United States\", which provides in relevant part:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-31\">\n   In order to recover payment made under this subchapter for an item or service, the United States may bring an action against any or all entities that are or were required or responsible (directly, as an insurer or self-insurer, as a third-party administrator, as an employer that sponsors or contributes to a group health plan, or large group health plan, or otherwise) to make payment with respect to the same item or service (or any portion thereof) under a primary plan. The United States may, in accordance with subparagraph (3)(A) collect double damages against any such entity. In addition, the United States may recover under this clause from any entity that has received payment from a primary plan or form the proceeds of a primary plan's payment to any entity.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1395y(b)(2)(B)(iii). Congress also created a private right of action under the Act.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1395y(b)(3)(A). It provides as follows:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-33\">\n   There is established a private cause of action for damages (which shall be in an amount double the amount otherwise provided) in the case of a primary plan\n   which fails to provide for primary payment (or appropriate reimbursement) in accordance with paragraphs [ (b) ](1) and [ (b) ](2)(A).\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"14278\" index=\"16\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/239/104/#p106\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   In 1997, Congress once again amended Medicare to add Part C, which \"afford[s] beneficiaries the option to receive their Medicare benefits through private organizations\" known as Medicare Advantage Organizations (\"MAOs\").\n   <em>\n    Collins v.

[D.E. 36, \u00b6\u00b6 39, 49]. The Complaint further alleges that La Ley, in turn, assigned all of the rights it obtained from FHCP to Plaintiff on February 20, 2015, which allowed Plaintiff to pursue \"recoveries related to accidents or incidents recoverable pursuant to\" the MSPA.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4224202\" index=\"18\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/73/653/#p659\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   , \u00b6 56.

Plaintiff argues in opposition that the applicable claims-filing period does not begin to run until the MAO (or any assignees with the same rights) receive notice of the primary payer's responsibility to make reimbursement payments, which in this case did not occur until November 16, 2015.

ANALYSIS\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   The dispute centers on the parties' disagreement over the applicable statute of limitations. Defendant contends that it is entitled to judgment on the pleadings because 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1395y(b)(2)(B)(vi) applies. That subsection reads as follows:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-45\">\n   Notwithstanding any other time limits that may exist for filing a claim under an employer group health plan, the United States may seek to recover conditional payments in accordance with this subparagraph where the request for payment is submitted to the entity required or responsible under this subsection to pay with respect to the item or service (or any portion thereof) under a primary plan within the 3-year period beginning on the date on which the item or service was furnished.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1395y(b)(2)(B)(vi). According to Defendant, the Second Amended Complaint asserts that the medical services rendered to the enrollee were furnished between April 29, 2012 and July 26, 2012; hence, Plaintiff was required to make a claim for reimbursement before July 26, 2015. [D.E. 90]. And as the Complaint also alleges that the demand for reimbursement did not occur until November 23, 2015 - more than three years from the date of service - Plaintiff's claim is definitively time-barred on the face of the pleadings.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"14278\" index=\"30\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/239/104/#p106\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   Plaintiff argues in opposition that Defendant relies on the incorrect statute of limitations, and that the relevant claims filing period can instead be found at \u00a7 1395y(b)(2)(B)(iii). That subsection states, in relevant part:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-48\">\n   In order to recover payment made under this subchapter for an item or service, the United States may bring an action against any or all entities that are or were required or responsible (directly, as an insurer or self-insurer, as a third-party administrator, as an employer that sponsors or contributes to a group health plan, or large group health plan, or otherwise) to make payment with respect to the same item or service (or any portion thereof) under a primary plan. ... An action may not be brought ... under this clause with respect to payment owed unless the complaint is filed not later than 3 years after the day of the receipt of notice of a settlement, judgment, award, or other payment.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"14278\" index=\"31\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/239/104/#p106\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   , \u00a7 1395y(b)(2)(B)(iii). The Second Amended Complaint alleges that Plaintiff became aware of Defendant's responsibility on November 20, 2015, and therefore had three years from that date to file suit to seek reimbursement. Thus, according to\n   Plaintiff, the Complaint was timely filed and the case must proceed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-50\">\n   A court in this District recently dealt with this same argument, albeit when confronted with a Motion to Dismiss.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    MSPA Claims 1, LLC v.

Judge Darrin P. Gayles rejected this argument:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-51\">\n   The Court disagrees with Defendant's interpretation of that statute. Subparagraph (B)(vi) does not contemplate litigation. Rather, it merely sets forth a timeframe in which the Government must request reimbursement.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-52\">\n   The applicable statute of limitations is found in subparagraph (B)(iii) ...

Thus, a plain reading of the statute provides clear support for Plaintiff's position.\n   <em>\n    See also\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    United States v.

The provision cited in support of Plaintiff's position states that a private cause of action\n   <em>\n    must\n   </em>\n   be brought within three years of the date of receipt of notice of, among other things, a settlement.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1358877\" index=\"43\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/147/1316/#p1318\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   , 1395y(b)(2)(B)(iii).

(quoting\n   <em>\n    Morales v.

As Justice Scalia further explained, that is particularly true where \"Congress has enacted a comprehensive scheme and has deliberately targeted specific problems with specific solutions.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11729384\" index=\"50\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/504/374/#p384\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   In such cases, \"the general/specific canon is perhaps most frequently applied to statutes in which a general permission or prohibition is contradicted by a specific prohibition or permission. To eliminate the contradiction, the specific provision is construed as an exception to the general one.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11729384\" index=\"51\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/504/374/#p384\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   (citations omitted).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-58\">\n   What we have here, in the light most favorable to Plaintiff, is a comprehensive statutory scheme that has a general authorization (the claims filing period) that sits side-by-side to a more limited, specific authorization (the civil actions limitations provision). In such a case, \"the terms of the specific authorization must be complied with.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11729384\" index=\"52\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/504/374/#p384\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-59\">\n   So, based on the plain language of these provisions, the application of that language in context, and guided by commonplace principles of interpretation, Judge Gayles reached the correct result. At the very least, Plaintiff is on much better statutory footing than Defendant when it comes to divining how Congress intended these statutes to work together. After all, if the purpose of the exercise is to prevent stale claims, that purpose assumes that the claimant will have notice of what the claim actually would be. It is far more persuasive to conclude that Congress, per \u00a7 1395y(b)(2)(B)(iii), adopted the \"receipt of notice of a settlement, judgment, award, or other payment\" as the benchmark by which stale claims are measured. In that case, Plaintiff's claim is timely.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-60\">\n   Finally, even if that conclusion was still debatable, that debate should clearly not be settled on the pleadings. At the very least, Defendant should then have to present a compelling record to support its limitations argument, rebuttable by Plaintiff's evidence, consistent with another established guiding principle that should apply here - limitations or timeliness statutes are traditionally deemed affirmative defenses under Rule 8(c).\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.,\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Navarro v. Santos Furniture Custom Design, Inc.,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5765299\" index=\"53\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-appx/372/24/#p27\">\n    372 F.
