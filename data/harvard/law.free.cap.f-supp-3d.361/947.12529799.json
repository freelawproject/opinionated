Kopf, Senior United States District Judge\n   Plaintiff BNSF alleges that in 2015, it settled a contested Federal Employers' Liability\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   (\"FELA\") and Locomotive Inspection Act\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   (\"LIA\") action with an employee engineer. (Filing 1, Complaint \u00b6\u00b6 16 &amp; 19.) The engineer alleged that the backrest of his locomotive seat gave away suddenly due to an allegedly defective reclining mechanism, resulting in career-ending injuries to his back. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 15 &amp; 17.) He claimed the locomotive seat-which was designed, manufactured, and marketed by the defendant in this action, Seats, Inc., and installed by General Electric (\"GE\")-did not comply with the federal standards set forth in the LIA because it was not in proper condition and safe to operate without unnecessary danger of personal injury. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 12-14, 18.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   In this diversity action, BNSF alleges that Seats, Inc., contracted to sell locomotive seats to GE, a locomotive manufacturer, for use in GE's locomotives, including the one in which the BNSF employee engineer was injured. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 8-9.) BNSF claims it is a third-party beneficiary of the contract between Seats, Inc., and GE to supply and install seats in locomotives used in interstate commerce that were safe, suitable for their intended use, and in compliance with the LIA. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 11.) BNSF asserts claims for products liability based on both negligence and strict liability (Counts I &amp; II); breach of contract (Count III); and equitable subrogation, indemnity, or contribution (Count IV). BNSF seeks to recover from Seats, Inc., the amount of the settlement with its injured engineer, expenses, and attorneys' fees incurred as a result of the physical harm caused to the engineer by the defective, non-LIA-compliant seat.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   On January 23, 2017, this court granted Seats, Inc.,'s Motion to Dismiss based on Fed. R. Civ. P. 12(b)(6) (Filing No. 8) on the ground that BNSF's claims were preempted by the LIA (Filing Nos. 16 &amp; 17). Because the court decided that all of BNSF's claims were preempted, it declined to discuss the remaining grounds for the Motion to Dismiss-that is, Seats, Inc.'s arguments that (1) BNSF's breach-of-contract allegations (Count III) fail to state a claim because BNSF is not an intended third-party beneficiary of the subject contract, and (2) BNSF's equitable subrogation, indemnity, and contribution allegations (Count IV) fail to state a claim because Seats, Inc., and BNSF do not share a common liability.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   BNSF appealed this court's preemption decision, which the Eighth Circuit Court of Appeals reversed and remanded with instructions that this court consider Seats, Inc.'s alternative arguments for dismissal of Counts III and IV \"in the first instance.\" (Filing No. 24 at CM/ECF pp. 6-7.) The original Motion to Dismiss filed by Seats, Inc., (Filing No. 8) was reactivated (Filing No. 28), and the court ordered the parties to file updated briefing regarding the motion. The parties have done so (Filing Nos. 31, 33, 36, 37), and the Motion to Dismiss based on Fed. R. Civ. P. 12(b)(6) is now ripe for decision.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   <em>\n    <strong>\n     I.
