A person who has been convicted and sentenced, but who does not fall within \u00a7 3143(b)(2), must be detained pending appeal unless the person satisfies the requirements at \u00a7 3143(b)(1).

Thus, subparagraph (A) does not cabin this request. The Court also notes that Defendant was not convicted of an offense whose penalties are prescribed by the Controlled Substances Act (\n   <extracted-citation index=\"25\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=21%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20801\">\n    21 U.S.C. \u00a7 801\n   </extracted-citation>\n   et seq. ), the Controlled Substances Import and Export Act (\n   <extracted-citation index=\"26\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=21%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20951\">\n    21 U.S.C. \u00a7 951\n   </extracted-citation>\n   et seq. ), or chapter 705 of title 46. Thus, subparagraph (C) also fails to control.

In fact, the only case that the Court could find that addresses this issue is\n   <em>\n    United States v.

Ill. July 30, 1993). The\n   <em>\n    Burnom\n   </em>\n   court concluded that subparagraph (B) did not apply in this situation and thus the defendant was not subject to mandatory detention pending appeal based on the following analysis:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-47\">\n   Section 3142(f)(1)(B) includes \"\n   <em>\n    offenses(s)\n   </em>\n   for which the maximum sentence is life imprisonment.\" (emphasis added). According to the government's reading of these provisions, since Section 924(e) carries a maximum sentence of life imprisonment and Section 3142(f)(1)(B) includes individuals who have committed an offense subject to a maximum sentence of life imprisonment, defendant must be detained under Section 3143(b)(2).\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-48\">\n   Defendant counters and this court agrees that defendant should not be detained under Section 3143(b)(2) because he has not committed an offense subject to a maximum sentence of life imprisonment as required under Section 3142(f)(1)(B). As defendant suggests, his offense of conviction is Section 922(g), an offense which only carries a maximum penalty of ten years in prison, and not Section 924(e) as the government suggests.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-49\">\n   Contrary to the government's contention, Section 924(e) does not constitute the offense of conviction in this instance. The Seventh Circuit has clearly established that Section 924(e) does not create\n   a separate federal offense.

However, unlike the\n   <em>\n    Burnom\n   </em>\n   court, this Court finds that this holding does not control the issue here.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-52\">\n   More specifically, this Court, bound by Eleventh Circuit precedent, agrees with the\n   <em>\n    Burnom\n   </em>\n   court that the offense of conviction is \u00a7 922(g) and not \u00a7 924(e). However, this Court disagrees with the\n   <em>\n    Burnom\n   </em>\n   court that the fact that the offense of conviction is \u00a7 922(g) automatically leads to the conclusion that subparagraph (B) does not apply since the maximum sentence is 10 years imprisonment. This is because the\n   <em>\n    Burnom\n   </em>\n   court set up its analysis as follows: (1) if the offense of conviction is \u00a7 922(g), then the maximum sentence is 10 years imprisonment, and subparagraph (B) does not apply; but (2) if the offense of conviction is \u00a7 924(e), then the maximum sentence is life imprisonment, and subparagraph (B) does apply. However, that analysis does not properly treat \u00a7 924(e) as a sentence enhancement. Thus, the analysis that this Court will use is as follows: the offense of conviction is \u00a7 922(g) in both scenarios; and (1) if the \u00a7 924(e) sentence enhancement does not apply, then the maximum sentence is 10 years imprisonment, and subparagraph (B) does not apply; but (2) if the \u00a7 924(e) sentence enhancement does apply, then the maximum sentence is life imprisonment, and subparagraph (B) does apply. The way this Court sets up its analysis is consistent with the Eleventh Circuit's treatment of \u00a7 922(g) as having different maximum sentences depending on whether the \u00a7 924(e) sentence enhancement applies.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    United States v.

My incarceration deprives me of access to essential resources and legal material necessary to perfect the defendant/appellant's appeal. Since my arrival at FCI Forrest City Low, all of my motions have been handwritten because this institution does not provide a word processing software, which is essential to the structure, format and perfection of the appellant's brief. The appellant's brief will also be handwritten if I am forced to complete it from here. My incarceration has constantly presented circumstances beyond my control which have prevented me from completing the appeal to date.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-63\">\n   2) In the event that oral argument is granted at the appellate level or this\n   case is remanded for further proceedings, my release would allow me to appear in court at no cost to any government agencies.

To correct the injustice regarding the Information in DC2008-3747, the defendant must move for correction of the record or vacation of the conviction via coram nobis at the state level.

CONCLUSION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-68\">\n   In his Motion, Defendant seeks to be released pending appeal. Section 3143(b) provides two ways for a Court to order that a defendant be detained pending appeal. First, a defendant must be detained pending appeal pursuant to \u00a7 3143(b)(2) if he has been found guilty of certain offenses. Second, even if \u00a7 3143(b)(2) does not require detention, a defendant may be detained if he fails to meet the conditions of \u00a7 3143(b)(1).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-69\">\n   Here, Defendant must be detained pending appeal pursuant to \u00a7 3143(b)(2). Section 3143(b)(2),\n   <em>\n    inter alia\n   </em>\n   , mandates that a defendant who has been convicted of an offense as described in subparagraph (B) of \u00a7 3142(f)(1) be detained.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"63\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%203143\">\n    18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3143\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (b)(2). Subparagraph (B) of \u00a7 3142(f)(1) includes \"offense(s) for which the maximum sentence is life imprisonment or death.\"\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"64\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%203142\">\n    18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3142\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (f)(1)(B). Because Defendant was convicted of violating \u00a7 922(g) and was sentenced according to \u00a7 924(e), he faced a statutory maximum penalty of life imprisonment. Accordingly, Defendant must be detained pending appeal pursuant to \u00a7 3143(b)(2), and the Court need not reach the issue of whether Defendant has satisfied the conditions of \u00a7 3143(b)(1).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-70\">\n   Lastly, Defendant argues that, even if he must be detained pursuant to \u00a7 3143(b)(2), he can still be released if he meets the conditions of \u00a7 3145(c). However, Defendant has not met the conditions of \u00a7 3145(c) because he has failed to \"clearly show[ ] that there are exceptional reasons\" why he should not be detained pending appeal.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"65\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%203145\">\n    18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3145\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (c).

Fla. Aug. 31, 2016) (\"Mr. Burke pleaded guilty to possessing a firearm as a convicted felon in violation of\n    <extracted-citation index=\"74\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20922\">\n     18 U.S.C. \u00a7 922\n    </extracted-citation>\n    (g)(1). The maximum sentence for violating \u00a7 922(g)(1) is ordinarily 10 years in prison.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    <em>\n     <extracted-citation index=\"75\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20922\">\n      id.\n     </extracted-citation>\n    </em>\n    \u00a7 924(a)(2).

However, Defendant does not present this argument to challenge his detention pending appeal pursuant to \u00a7 3143(b)(2). More specifically, Defendant does not argue that this Court should change his sentence so that the \u00a7 924(e) sentence enhancement does not apply and thus he is subject only to a statutory maximum penalty of ten years imprisonment instead of life imprisonment. Instead, Defendant presents this argument to challenge the magistrate judge's alternative finding that Defendant should be detained pursuant to \u00a7 3143(b)(1) because none of his appeal issues-including the issue that the \u00a7 924(e) sentence enhancement was incorrectly applied to him-are likely to result in reversal, a new trial, or a reduction of his sentence. However, because this Court finds that Defendant is subject to mandatory detention pending appeal pursuant to \u00a7 3143(b)(2), the Court does not need to reach a \u00a7 3143(b)(1) analysis and determine whether Defendant's appeal issues are likely to result in reversal, a new trial, or a reduction of his sentence. Further, even if the Court were to construe Defendant's argument as asking the Court to reconsider his sentence and even if the Court had the authority to reconsider his sentence at this time, the Court notes-and Defendant admits-that \"these issues were not raised during the original sentencing hearing\" (doc. 110 at 15) or as objections to the Presentence Investigation Report.

Accordingly, Defendant has admitted all facts material to this analysis stated in the Presentence Investigation Report, and more specifically that he had three prior drug felony convictions as defined at\n    <extracted-citation index=\"77\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20924\">\n     18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924\n    </extracted-citation>\n    (e)(2), all of which were committed on different occasions.
