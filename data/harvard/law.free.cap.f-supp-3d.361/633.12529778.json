Naumann's Motion to Dismiss (docket no. 82), and Defendant Equity Liaison Company's Motion to Dismiss (docket no. 83), and the responses thereto.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   <strong>\n    Factual and Procedural Background\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   This lawsuit, which now involves multiple parties and claims, stems from a contract for the purchase of frac sand between Bates Energy Oil &amp; Gas (\"Bates Energy\") and Complete Oilfield Services\n   (\"COFS\"). The following facts alleged in the Third Amended Counterclaim (\"TAC\") (docket no. 68), which is COFS's live pleading, are taken as true for purposes of the pending motions.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   COFS is a Utah company that was created in 2017 for the specific purpose of supplying frac sand to ProPetro, a pressure pumping and fracking company based in Midland, Texas. COFS and ProPetro have a Supply Agreement for COFS to acquire specific types of frac sand for ProPetro's use, and ProPetro agreed to deposit $ 4 million into an escrow account to pay COFS's eventual sand supplier for the purchase and delivery of sand.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   COFS began researching to find an appropriate source for frac sand, and relied upon information provided by others such as Defendant Austin Howard of Howard Resources. In March 2017, Defendant Howard introduced COFS to Stanley Bates, the principal and CEO of Bates Energy, which was created in February 2017. Despite Bates's reputation as an unscrupulous businessman, Austin Howard firmly vouched for Bates as a trustworthy associate and assured COFS that Bates was well regarded in the frac sand industry. Bates represented to COFS that Bates Energy had the capacity to supply the required frac sand, specifically through its rights with mines in Wisconsin. Relying on Bates's representations about Bates Energy's delivery capabilities, as well as other representations, COFS entered into a Memorandum of Understanding (\"MOU\") with Bates Energy on April 18, 2017. Under the MOU, Bates Energy was to deliver specific amounts and types of frac sand to one of seven rail terminals in Texas on specific due dates, the first being May 10, 2017. COFS alleges that, \"[o]nce Bates Energy became aware that COFS was a potential client, it promptly notified other Counter-Defendants, copying them on emails and giving rise to the conspiracy and other unlawful acts that led to the Counter-Defendants' theft of over $ 650,000 of COFS's funds.\" TAC \u00b6 25.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   COFS alleges that \"[p]ublic allegations of improper conduct by Bates created COFS's need for caution if the parties were to proceed.\" TAC \u00b6 30. COFS alleges that it moved forward based on Howard's endorsement, but \"insisted on a legal structure to protect the funds entrusted by ProPetro,\" including the creation of two independent escrow accounts for ProPetro's monies, one with Counter-Defendant Equity Liaison Company (\"ELC\") and one with Amegy Bank.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Bates Energy originally insisted that all $ 4 million be held in escrow by ELC, which COFS later learned was a close associate of Bates's overseen by its principal Dewayne D. Naumann, ostensibly because Amegy Bank was not embedded in the oil and gas industry and in Bates's opinion, ELC was a \"proven performance company.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 33. But because ELC was not a financial institution and was unknown to COFS, COFS insisted upon the creation of a second escrow account with Amegy Bank.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   ProPetro's money was placed into two escrow accounts, one with Amegy Bank with a deposit of $ 3 million, with Amegy serving as the escrow agent, and one with ELC with a deposit of $ 1 million in account no. 2917\n   at Chase Bank, with ELC acting as the escrow agent.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   COFS, Bates Energy, and ELC entered into an April 14, 2017 Escrow and Distribution Agreement (\"the Escrow Agreement\"). Under the terms of the MOU between Bates Energy and COFS, Bates Energy could be paid from the escrow account the first 50% of each purchase upon delivery of a Bill of Lading (\"BOL\") for the sand, and could receive the outstanding balance within three business days after the sand was \"loaded into the COFS or designated trucking company, and the BOL of the load-out are issued with the final invoice.\" TAC Ex. 3 \u00b6 3. The Escrow Agreement required ELC to deposit and maintain COFS's funds in a separate escrow account under COFS's name, but, unbeknownst to COFS, account no. 2917 was a pre-existing Bates Energy escrow account that ELC/Naumann was already handling for Bates Energy, and thus the $ 1 million was immediately commingled with funds already in the account. TAC \u00b6\u00b6 35-36. COFS alleges that disbursements from the ELC escrow account required the joint instruction of both COFS and Bates Energy, and COFS alleges that the unusual arrangement was acceptable to it \"because both escrow agreements required COFS's notice, signature and authorization to effectuate any disbursements of funds.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 37, 42. COFS alleges that \"Naumann assured COFS that he and ELC recognized their legal obligations as a fiduciary\" and all parties \"knew that disbursement of escrowed funds was improper until COFS signed off on an invoice or disbursement authorization.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 42.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   COFS alleges that Stanley Bates immediately began lying about frac sand being on its way, and in fact represented that Bates Energy had already begun acquiring sand and arranging for delivery by April 17, before the formal MOU was executed on April 18.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 44. Bates again promised that railcars were in Iowa on April 27 and would be leaving for Texas on April 29 with anticipated delivery on May 5.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 47-48. No sand was delivered either time, and Bates Energy provided no BOLs or other documents showing it ever loaded any railcar with sand.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 48.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   After COFS became concerned about the truth of the statements and Bates Energy's ability to deliver, COFS's principal Sam Taylor went to Wisconsin on May 9 to investigate Bates Energy's purported mines and other frac sand sources.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 49. COFS alleges that Bates sent Mark Sylla, who was also in the frac sand business, as a \"company representative,\" and Sylla \"took Sam Taylor on a winding tour around Wisconsin, stopping at two mines along the way,\" neither of which \"had the capacity to deliver any appreciable amount of frac sand and neither permitted Sylla/Bates Energy to access its premises.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 50.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   Bates Energy failed to meet the May 10 initial delivery deadline. COFS alleges that Stanley Bates and David Bravo, who had been described alternatively as an owner, COO, and logistics coordinator of Bates Energy and worked closely with Bates/Bates Energy and was aware of the escrow agreements, knew that Stanley Bates faced imminent indictment for his role in the Four Winds Logistics frac sand scandal.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 102. Consequently, on May 11 or 12, Bravo, Sylla, and Bates's girlfriend Audra Vega, created a new company, Unlimited Frac Sand d/b/a Frac Sand Unlimited (\"FSU\"), a Texas LLC, \"to maintain the parties' fraudulent and illegal acts against COFS, and drain COFS's escrowed funds.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Sylla is listed as a manager of FSU on the LLC formation documents. COFS alleges that FSU \"was essentially one and the same as Bates Energy, and was operated by Bates and Bravo.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 103. COFS alleges that by July 2017, Bates was directing\n   ELC/Naumann to use the name FSU on new escrow agreements and it was listed as the \"assignee\" on Bates/Bates Energy correspondence and false invoices referring to sand that was never procured or delivered.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ELC/Naumann directed numerous unauthorized payments to FSU from COFS's escrowed funds.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 104. On May 12, $ 50,000 was withdrawn from the ELC escrow account, and disbursed $ 16,666 each to ELC/Naumann, Bates/Bates Energy, and FSU/Bravo.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 67. That same day, Bates/Bates Energy approved an unauthorized wire transfer of $ 10,761.52 to purchase railcar insurance.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 68. On May 16, 2017, Stanley Bates was indicted based on his involvement in Four Winds Logistics.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   COFS alleges that Bates Energy changed its strategy in early June to string COFS along, suggesting that it could deliver noncomplying sand.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 52. COFS alleges that Bates admitted that he had never scheduled any sand for delivery until June 9, when he made his first attempt to deliver compliant sand. But this attempt was also deficient.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 57. The railcar documentation indicated that the consignee of the product was \"High Crush\" rather than Bates Energy, and Bates insisted that Sam Taylor \"fix that problem by falsely representing to railroad officials that Sam was with Frac Sand Unlimited, the company managed by David Bravo, Mark Sylla, and Bates' girlfriend Audra Vega.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   After hours of searching the Odessa facility, Taylor never located the sand.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   COFS alleges on information and belief that Bates Energy did not have a mine or other supplier that could provide the tonnage and type of sand COFS required under the MOU.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 54.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   On June 15, COFS and Bates Energy agreed that COFS could use some of the escrowed money to buy sand from CSI, and funds were distributed from the ELC escrow account and then replenished from the Amegy account.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 59. COFS alleges that throughout this time, Defendants were \"secretly and systematically raiding COFS's escrow funds\" despite knowing that \"funds should not have been distributed absent notice to and consent by COFS.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 61. COFS alleges that Defendants absconded with at least $ 652,000 of its funds and \"used various techniques to conceal the unlawful disbursements.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 63-64. ELC/Naumann frequently transferred large sums of money among the Chase bank account that was supposed to be the segregated escrow account, ELC's high-interest money market account, FSU's checking account, and ELC/Naumann's personal checking account.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 64. COFS alleges that ELC also used at least three sets of \"books\" and improperly redacted information, making it impossible to identify all specific recipients of cash disbursements from the account.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 66-67.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   On June 15, $ 65,000 was improperly disbursed as \"liquidated damages,\" including $ 15,000 to ELC and $ 10,000 to Sylla.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 70. On June 30, there was an additional $ 28,500 disbursement as \"liquidated damages and administration fee,\" including $ 7,500 to ELC and $ 5,000 to Sylla.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 71. COFS alleges there were also improper disbursements for attorney's fees to Bates Energy's attorneys, the Rosenblatt firm.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   COFS alleges that Defendants also used a Boerne, Texas company called Tier 1 Sands, LLC for two substantial, fraudulent sand transactions, demanding that money be paid to Tier 1 Sands to purchase frac sand on July 6 and again on July 18. COFS alleges upon information and belief that Bates/Bates Energy and/or Bravo/FSU are either affiliated with Tier 1 Sands and/or have an illegal side agreement to share funds stolen from COFS.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 78-83.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   On July 12, COFS did approve a disbursement of approximately $ 39,000 for frac sand based on supplied BOLs.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 73.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   FSU is listed as the consignee on 18 BOLs that were supplied to COFS as \"proof\" that Bates Energy had procured frac sand.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 104. COFS authorized a payment to Bates Energy in reliance upon those representations, but no sand was delivered, demonstrating that the BOLs were false and/or forged.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   Also on July 12, Bates/Bates Energy and ELC/Naumann facilitated another payment to Bates/Bates Energy for $ 6,500 in unauthorized \"admin fees.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 74. On July 19, Bates/Bates Energy issued a request for the disbursement of funds for \"liquidated damages and admin fees\" of $ 69,000, distributed to Bates Energy ($ 20,000), Bravo ($ 20,000), Sylla ($ 7,500), Howard Resources ($ 6,500), and ELC ($ 15,000), plus $ 31,000 in legal fees likely paid to the Rosenblatt Firm.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 75.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   On July 20, Bates Energy brought this lawsuit, asserting a claim against COFS for breach of contract and against its principal Sam Taylor for tortious interference with contract. COFS alleges that Bates Energy continued obtaining unauthorized disbursements on July 26 and 31. TAC \u00b6 76. On July 30, Bates/Bates Energy attempted \"to drain the entirety of the escrow account\" by demanding that ELC/Naumann distribute all sums in the account to Bates Energy \"due to Liquidated Damages, Cost of Goods, and Demurrage of Rail Cars.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 77. COFS alleges that Bravo and/or FSU have assisted and advised Bates/Bates Energy in its lawsuit.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 106. COFS alleges that, on August 11, Bravo and FSU participated with Bates/Bates Energy in a sham sand transaction involving Transload and Logistics LLC, after which ELC/Naumann transferred $ 204,266.97 of COFS's funds to FSU.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 105.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   On August 15, Bates/Bates Energy requested that ELC/Naumann pay $ 106,970.56 for demurrage obligations purportedly incurred by Tier 1 Sands but divided among the Defendants Tier 1 Sands, Rosenblatt Firm, ELC, Bravo Construction, and Bates Energy.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 83. Also on August 15, COFS officially terminated the MOU, and Rosenblatt emailed the termination notice to Bates/Bates Energy and Bravo, but Defendants continued their conspiracy to drain the escrow funds through August 23, 2017.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 84. Bates sent the termination email to ELC/Naumann and Bravo with the note, \"It's NOW or NEVER!\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Bates/Bates Energy and ELC/Naumann immediately exchanged an email regarding \"Demurrage Invoice and Distribution of Funds.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 85 (Ex 9). The next day, Bates/Bates Energy sent to ELC/Naumann a fake \"demurrage\" invoice from Tier 1 Sands, LLC to FSU for $ 4,550.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 85. On August 23, Bates/Bates Energy sent another invoice to ELC/Naumann demanding payment to itself for $ 140,541.85 for \"demurrage,\" based on yet more fake documents prepared by Bates/Bates Energy, and ELC/Nauman disbursed the funds without any supporting third-party documentation because Bates/Bates Energy had never delivered any sand.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 85-86. Because ELC/Naumann was concerned that the lack of documentation would expose it to liability, Rosenblatt wrote ELC/Naumann \"demanding\" that it pay the funds.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 87. (Ex 10).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   COFS filed a counterclaim against Bates Energy for declaratory judgment, rescission, fraud, breach of contract, equitable accounting, and theft, and sought a writ of attachment to protect monies in the ELC escrow account. COFS and Taylor removed\n   the case on the basis of diversity jurisdiction. After removal, COFS filed additional counterclaims against third-party defendants ELC and Naumann for declaratory judgment, breach of the Escrow Agreement, equitable accounting, breach of fiduciary duty, and \"restitution or money had and received,\" and sought a writ of attachment. ELC answered and filed counterclaims against COFS and cross-claims against Bates for indemnity. Docket no. 36. Naumann filed a motion to dismiss the counterclaims against him for failure to state a claim for relief under Rule 12(b)(6). Docket no. 37. After a hearing, the Court granted the motion to dismiss the claims against Naumann individually, with leave to amend. Text Order dated January 24, 2018.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   Thereafter, COFS filed a motion for leave to file amended pleadings and to join additional defendants, which this Court granted. COFS then filed its Third Amended Counterclaim (\"TAC\") (docket no. 68) against Bates Energy, ELC, and Naumann, and additional Defendants Stanley Bates, David Bravo, Lorena Silvistri Bravo, individually and d/b/a Bravo Consulting Services, Howard Resources, LLC, the Rosenblatt Law Firm, Mark B. Sylla, Tier 1 Sands, LLC, and Unlimited Frac Sand. As noted above, that is COFS's live pleading. In response, Naumann, ELC, and Sylla filed motions to dismiss (docket nos. 82, 83, &amp; 86). Tier 1 Sands, Howard Resources, David Bravo, Lorena Silvistri Bravo, and Unlimited Frac Sand filed answers. Docket nos. 85, 89, &amp; 102.

As part of that conspiracy, the allegations are that (1) Sylla conspired to misrepresent Bates Energy's ability to procure sand, to induce COFS to maintain its relationship with Bates Energy, and, specifically, to keep its money in the Texas escrow account with co-conspirator ELC, so that the members of the conspiracy could steal the funds and (2) participated in the creation of a Texas LLC, of which he was named manager, and used that LLC to create fraudulent invoices and BOLs that were used to misappropriate the specific funds from the Texas escrow account, both without COFS's consent and with its fraudulently obtained consent. And Sylla further personally received money from the Texas escrow account on at least three occasions in June and July 2017 as a result (TAC \u00b6\u00b6 70, 71, 75). Thus, fake documents were directed to Texas to further a fraudulent scheme and to cause the transfer of specified funds in a Texas account out of the account to participants in the scheme, including Sylla.

ELC contends that the economic loss rule bars all of COFS's tort claims because a plaintiff may recover only under a contract\n   theory when the plaintiff claims that the defendant's actions breached a duty that arose solely because the parties have contracted with one another and the injury is only the economic loss to the subject of the contract itself. ELC contends that the economic loss rule requires dismissal of all COFS's tort claims, including the fraudulent inducement and breach of fiduciary duty claims, because any duty, including any fiduciary duty, arises from the contractual agreement, and COFS has failed to identify any damages caused by ELC's actions other than the loss of escrow funds that are the subject of the parties' contract.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-60\">\n   The economic loss rule is a defense that bars negligence and certain other tort claims (such as products liability) for recovery of economic loss when the loss is limited to the subject matter of a contract or to the product itself. However, it is not enough to simply say that all tort claims are barred when the economic loss is the subject of a contract, as \"there is not one economic loss rule broadly applicable throughout the field of torts, but rather several more limited rules that govern recovery of economic losses in selected areas of the law.\"\n   <em>\n    Sharyland Water Supply v.

It focuses on the fact that COFS has alleged that ELC breached independent duties, and the types of equitable relief it seeks, but fails to adequately demonstrate independent injury flowing from a negligent misrepresentation as opposed to a breach of contract. It is not sufficient to argue, as COFS does, that it seeks the equitable relief of forfeiture of the monies wrongfully taken, especially when that relief appears tied to its breach-of-fiduciary duty claim. In addition, a breach-of-contract claim sometimes permits\n   restitution damages, and this relief is specifically tied neither to the contract claim nor the negligent misrepresentation claim.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-68\">\n   COFS notes that the escrow agreement is a services contract, and therefore the subject of the agreement is the services rendered, such that it questions the premise that the subject of the agreement is the escrow funds.

But the relevant question for the independent injury rule is whether COFS is alleging damages/injury flowing from reliance on a negligent misrepresentation independent of its claimed damages/ injury from the breach of the contract. In this regard, all the case law is clear that a party may not seek and recover benefit-of-the-bargain or expectancy damages for negligent misrepresentation,\n   <em>\n    D.S.A.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11708620\" index=\"47\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw2d/973/662/#p663\">\n    973 S.W.2d at 663\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , while such damages are available under a breach-of-contract claim.\n   <em>\n    Chapman Custom Homes\n   </em>\n   directs that the harm for a negligent misrepresentation claim must be \"not merely the economic loss of a contractual benefit\" or \"only ... the economic loss of a contractual expectancy.\"\n   <em>\n    Chapman Custom Homes, Inc. v.

Thus, COFS's request for leave to amend to seek lost profit damages as a \"form of damages independent of the Escrow Agreement,\" docket no. 91 \u00b6 24, is confusing, since the lost profits it seeks are clearly benefit-of-the-bargain damages as they represent the commissions COFS would have received had all gone according to plan. But if COFS is seeking leave to amend to seek lost profits for its breach-of-contract claim, such leave is granted.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-69\">\n   Application of the economic loss rule becomes much more murky when the plaintiff seeks reliance or out-of-pocket damages for the negligent misrepresentation, when such damages are recoverable types of damages under both negligent misrepresentation and contract claims.

In its Response, COFS argues that its negligent misrepresentation claim is based not on an affirmative misrepresentation, but on a failure to disclose information where there is a duty to do so, citing a case in which a bank was held to have a duty to use reasonable care to provide information to customers. COFS further points to the duties of disclosure of escrow agents. COFS relies on the fact that ELC refused to provide an accounting when asked by COFS and failed to disclose the unauthorized distributions. While these arguments may support COFS's assertion that ELC owed an independent duty under tort law, an issue the Court does not decide, COFS fails to identify the specific damages flowing from the alleged breach of duty.

Thus the fraud claim related to the July 12 authorized disbursement is not barred by the economic loss rule. To the extent COFS is arguing that every\n   <em>\n    un\n   </em>\n   authorized disbursement was an actionable fraud, the Court concludes below that such claims are subsumed within the fraudulent inducement claim.

If the plaintiffs lost something, it was because the terms of the contract said they did. In this case, COFS seeks lost monies entrusted under a contract, but the contract did not define how much money ELC was to provide COFS, and COFS's theft claim is not that it did not receive the money it contractually bargained-for.

However, the Texas Supreme Court recognizes that certain professional duties have developed in the common law independent of contracts, and thus generally fall outside the rule.

In\n   <em>\n    Newington\n   </em>\n   , the plaintiff placed $ 1 million in trust with Forrester with instructions to hold the money until the plaintiff finalized a deal with a third party, but Forrester transferred $ 200,000 of the money to another party without authorization. When the plaintiff did not finalize the deal with a third party and asked for the money back, Forrester could only return $ 800,000, and the plaintiff sued under various theories of liability, including conversion, unjust enrichment, breach of fiduciary duties, breach of trust, and money had and received. The plaintiff did not sue for breach of contract, and there was no written agreement, but Forrester asserted that the tort claims were barred by the economic loss rule because the underlying agreement was a contract and the only claimed loss was the $ 200,000 subject to the agreement. The district court disagreed, finding that Forrester owed the plaintiff the independent duties of an escrow agent under Texas common law, and thus the duties owed and liability for breach existed independent of any contract.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-89\">\n   This Court previously noted that, under Texas law, courts have held that escrow agents owe a fiduciary duty to both parties to the contract that arises as a matter of law.

COFS further alleges that ELC breached its duty to make full disclosure beyond the obligations of the Escrow Agreement and breached its duty to conserve the money and pay it only to those entitled to receive it. COFS further seeks equitable remedies beyond those available for breach of contract. Because a fiduciary duty may arise as a matter of law independent of the contract, dismissal of the breach of fiduciary duty claim at this motion to dismiss stage would be premature, and the motion to dismiss is denied on this claim.\n   <footnotemark>\n    8\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-90\">\n   <em>\n    restitution or money had and received\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-91\">\n   In\n   <em>\n    ConocoPhillips Company v.

For the fraudulent inducement claim, COFS pleads that, during the pre-contracting period, ELC/Naumann falsely stated that they would not remove COFS's funds from the escrow account without notice to and consent of COFS and that they would properly require, account for, and audit supporting documentation for any sand deliveries, and that COFS relied on these misrepresentations in entering the escrow agreement with ELC, and that it was harmed thereby because ELC disbursed monies from the account without COFS's knowledge or consent. This is sufficient to plausibly state a fraudulent inducement claim.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-102\">\n   For the fraud claim, the specifics of the alleged misrepresentations upon which COFS relied are less clear. COFS's Response points to \"fraudulent acts of disbursing funds.\" Docket no. 90 at 8. But an unauthorized distribution from the escrow account is not alone a basis for a cause of action for fraud. COFS alleges that ELC paid out numerous unauthorized disbursements from May through August, but alleges no specific misrepresentations upon which it relied other than the pre-contract representations that form the basis of its fraudulent inducement claim. COFS alleges that these transfers were made \"for falsified reasons such as 'liquidated damages,' 'admin fees,' legal fees, or just simple cash grabs.\" TAC \u00b6 62. But COFS alleges that these transfers were made without its knowledge, and thus it establishes no basis for reliance in connection with any of those falsified reasons for the specific alleged sham transfers. Thus, to the extent COFS appears to assert that each sham transaction was a separate fraud based upon ELC/Naumann's pre-contractual promises, these claims would appear to be subsumed by the fraudulent inducement claim: ELC promised to make disbursements only pursuant to the terms of the contract, not intending to carry through on that promise at the time it was made, and then in fact did not abide by the promise in carrying out the agreement. Each unauthorized disbursement then is evidence of the original fraudulent misrepresentation, but is not itself an actionable fraud. COFS did not rely on a misrepresentation with respect to any particular transaction, because it was unaware of those transactions, and relied upon the misrepresentation only in entering the contract. To the extent COFS may be attempting to assert claims of fraud by nondisclosure based on Naumann's failure to provide information concerning the account, such a claim is not clearly set forth in the Third Amended Counterclaim to provide fair notice. Thus, the TAC fails to plausibly plead fraud claims related to unauthorized disbursements other than the fraudulent inducement claim alleging that COFS was fraudulently induced into entering the Escrow Agreement.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-103\">\n   The TAC does state a claim for fraud related to the July 12 authorization to disburse funds, which COFS approved because Bates produced BOLs that appeared legitimate. The TAC \u00b6 127 alleges\n   that Naumann \"made misrepresentations or omission of material facts to induce Counter-Plaintiff to enter into the ELC escrow agreement and other agreements, including but not limited to the fraudulent sale of sand for which these Counter-Defendants obtained the 'consent' of COFS.\" The TAC further alleges that \"fraudulent representations committed by Naumann and ELC include ... b. That sand was delivered with proper support documentation.\" TAC \u00b6 127. Thus, COFS alleges a specific misrepresentation, upon which it relied in authorizing the July 12 disbursement of $ 31,000 or $ 39,000, and states a fraud claim with regard to the July 12 disbursement.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-104\">\n   The motion to dismiss the fraudulent inducement claim and conspiracy to commit fraudulent inducement claim against ELC is denied.

Naumann's Motion to Dismiss\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-114\">\n   Naumann moves to dismiss all of COFS's claims against him in his individual capacity. COFS sues both ELC and Naumann for fraud and conspiracy to commit fraud, theft and conspiracy to commit theft, breach of fiduciary duty, negligent misrepresentation, equitable accounting, and money had and received. COFS's complaint refers to \"ELC/Naumann\" as a single party, but alleges claims against ELC and against Naumann in his individual capacity (direct claims) and vicariously on a veil piercing theory. Naumann argues that he cannot be liable as a party to the Escrow Agreement because he is not a signatory in his individual capacity, signed only as the managing member of ELC, and did not personally undertake any obligations. Naumann contends that COFS fails to state a claim against him individually because every action of which COFS complains was taken by Naumann in his capacity as a principal of ELC.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-115\">\n   Naumann further argues that COFS fails to allege fraud with sufficient particularity;\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-116\">\n   fails to identify which Defendants took which actions sufficient to give fair notice under its TLA and negligent misrepresentation claims; fails to state a claim for breach of fiduciary duty because it fails to allege that Naumann personally acted as escrow agent; fails to plead a relationship between COFS and Naumann individually to support a negligent misrepresentation or equitable accounting claim; fails to identify any money that Naumann personally received and why that money belonged to COFS for the restitution or money had and received claim; and fails to plead sufficient facts to state a claim for veil piercing.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-117\">\n   1.\n   <em>\n    individual liability and vicarious liability/veil piercing\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-118\">\n   Before considering whether the pleadings state any particular causes of action against Naumann, the Court must first consider the extent to which Naumann may be held directly individually liable for the alleged torts or vicariously liable through a veil piercing theory. A defendant's liability in his individual capacity for his own tortious conduct is distinct from liability under a veil piercing theory, which is a form of vicarious liability. COFS asserts that Naumann may be liable in his individual capacity for knowingly participating in fraudulent or tortious acts, even when acting within the course and scope of his employment. Docket no. 90 at 3. COFS cites several cases in that vein. However, Naumann contends that COFS's pleadings fail to state a claim against Naumann individually.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-119\">\n   Naumann also correctly notes that certain language in the TAC indicates that COFS is attempting to reach Naumann by piercing the corporate veil of ELC, specifically alleging that \"Naumann is using the corporate form of ELC to perpetrate a fraud on COFS, and adherence to the corporate fiction would promote injustice and lead to an inequitable result.\" Docket no. 82 at 12 (citing TAC \u00b6 94). Naumann contends that it is insufficient to allege that Naumann was the only principal of ELC, and that COFS must allege more -- specifically that the fraud was perpetrated primarily for Naumann's direct personal benefit. Docket no. 82 at 12-13. COFS contends that it has sufficiently pled its claims for direct and vicarious liability, but seeks leave to amend to address any deficiencies identified by the Court in analyzing the motion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-120\">\n   Texas has long had two methods for holding individual corporate agents or officers personally liable when they are acting within the course and scope of their employment or role as corporate agents - piercing the corporate veil or direct individual liability. First, a plaintiff may impose individual liability against corporate agents by imposing vicarious liability on the individual for the corporation's liability through one of the various veil piercing theories for disregarding the corporate form, including sham to perpetrate a fraud or alter ego. Piercing the corporate veil is not itself a cause of action, but a means to impose personal liability on shareholders and corporate officers who otherwise would be shielded from liability for corporate obligations and liabilities.\n   <em>\n    Shandong Yinguang Chem.

The history of the statute and the statutory language indicate\n   that it applies to veil piercing theories (for both contract and related tort claims), but not to direct liability claims for an individual's own tortious conduct. The protection of subsection (a)(2) applies to \"any contractual obligation\n   <em>\n    of the corporation\n   </em>\n   or any matter relating to or arising\n   <em>\n    from the obligation\n   </em>\n   ,\" \u00a7 21.223(a)(2) (emphasis added), indicating that it applies to claims holding a shareholder or owner liable for a contract-related\n   <em>\n    corporate obligation\n   </em>\n   (both contract and tort), the classic veil piercing scenario.

But \"other similar theory\" would not appear to include direct, individual liability claims based on personal conduct, which have always been separate from veil piercing theories. While\n   <em>\n    TecLogistics\n   </em>\n   and\n   <em>\n    Saeed\n   </em>\n   focus on the language that the statute applies to \"any matter relating to or arising from the [corporate contractual] obligation,\" neither focuses on the\n   <em>\n    theory of liability\n   </em>\n   language, which indicates that the statute applies to veil-piercing theories of liability, not direct liability theories. Accordingly, the Court will not apply the statute to any direct personal liability claims, and will simply examine those claims to determine whether COFS has sufficiently pled a claim.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-146\">\n   With regard to COFS's veil-piercing allegations, COFS alleges that \"Naumann is using the corporate form of ELC to perpetrate a fraud on COFS, and adherence to the corporate fiction would promote injustice and lead to an inequitable result.\" TAC \u00b6 94. Naumann has invoked the protections of \u00a7 21.223. The tort claims relate to or arise from ELC's contractual obligations, and COFS does not contend that the statute is inapplicable. To hold Naumann vicariously liable for the torts of ELC under \u00a7 21.223, COFS must allege that Naumann \"caused the corporation to be used for the purpose of perpetrating and did perpetrate an actual fraud on [COFS] primarily for the direct personal benefit of\" Naumann. TEX. BUS. ORGS. CODE \u00a7 21.223(b). Naumann contends that COFS fails to allege that he perpetrated the fraud primarily for his direct personal benefit, and the allegation that he is the sole principal of ELC is insufficient. In response, COFS contends that Naumann \"was intricately intertwined in the events at issue which give rise to both fraud and other tortious liability\" and again asserts that Naumann is the only principal.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-147\">\n   The Court concludes that COFS has not sufficiently pled facts demonstrating that the fraud was primarily for Naumann's direct personal benefit. The allegations all refer to \"ELC/Naumann\" as one, and they state that unauthorized disbursements were transferred to \"ELC\" or placed in \"ELC/Naumann's personal checking account.\" While \"primarily for the direct personal benefit\" of the individual is not defined, most cases finding the requirement to have been met had evidence showing that \"funds derived from the corporations' allegedly fraudulent conduct were pocketed by or diverted to the individual defendant.\"\n   <em>\n    Hong\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12657063\" index=\"178\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/551/875/\">\n    551 S.W.3d at 885\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (listing\n   cases). When the funds were used for the corporation's benefit, that has been held insufficient, even where it indirectly benefits the corporate officers and agents because the corporation is \"able to live another day due to its ability to satisfy some demands\" or because their ownership interest retains its value, and this appears true even where the individual is the sole shareholder and where corporate formalities are disregarded.\n   <em>\n    Morgan v.

Because the allegations either state that money was given to ELC or to ELC/Naumann (TAC \u00b6 70, 71, 75, 83) or were placed into \"ELC/Naumann's personal checking account\" or \"ELC/Naumann's high-interest money market account,\" the pleadings fail to demonstrate a basis for finding that the fraud was primarily for Naumann's direct personal benefit.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-148\">\n   Accordingly, the Court dismisses any veil piercing claims against Naumann, subject to repleading by COFS to attempt to state such a claim.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-149\">\n   2.\n   <em>\n    fraud/fraudulent inducement and conspiracy to commit fraud\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-150\">\n   Naumann argues that COFS fails to plead fraud or fraudulent inducement with sufficient particularly under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 9(b).

Naumann argues that COFS complains only of (1) failing to release the funds to COFS in accordance with the terms of the Escrow Agreement, (2) failing to disclose activity in and related to the escrow account, and (3) failing to pay the funds only to COFS, who is entitled to the funds. TAC \u00b6 154. Naumann asserts that each of these alleged actions relate to duties that arise out of COFS's deposit of funds with ELC and the terms of the Escrow Agreement, not to actions taken by Naumann in an individual capacity, and COFS has failed to allege facts sufficient to cause Naumann to be personally liable for breach of fiduciary duty. Naumann notes that this Court previously dismissed COFS's claims against Naumann individually based on these exact allegations.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-155\">\n   The Court has found that a corporate agent may still be liable for his own personal tortious activity, even if acting within the course of his corporate agency, and that applies to breach-of-fiduciary duty claims. Thus, the fact that Naumann was acting in his capacity as principal for ELC does not alone preclude liability for his torts. However, questions remain as to whether a fiduciary duty arose as a matter of law as between Naumann individually and COFS, and whether such a duty is actionable separate and apart from the\n   duty owed by ELC. These issues are beyond the scope of this motion to dismiss. The Court denies the motion to dismiss predicated on the argument that Naumann cannot be held individually liable for breach of fiduciary duty because his actions were taken in his capacity as principal for ELC.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-156\">\n   5.\n   <em>\n    negligent misrepresentation\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-157\">\n   Naumann contends that the complaint fails to state a claim against him for negligent misrepresentation because individual liability for negligence \"arises only when the officer or agent owes an independent duty of reasonable care to the injured party apart from the employer's duty,\" and COFS fails to allege the existence of any relationship between Naumann and COFS independent of the relationship between COFS and ELC and fails to allege the existence of any independent duty.

Docket no. 82 at 10.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-160\">\n   With regard to the merits, the Court has already concluded that COFS states a claim sufficient for the Court to order an equitable accounting.

The Court agrees that COFS fails to allege facts showing that Naumann individually received money. As discussed above with regard to the veil piercing allegations, COFS never differentiates between money received by ELC and money received by Naumann individually. This claim is dismissed as to Naumann subject to repleading.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-163\">\n   8.\n   <em>\n    attorney's fees\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-164\">\n   To the extent Naumann moves to dismiss the claim for attorney's fees, any issue of attorneys' fees will be taken up post-judgment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-165\">\n   <strong>\n    III. Defendant Stanley P. Bates\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-166\">\n   The Court notes that Defendant Stanley P. Bates does not appear to have been served as required by Rule 4. The original lawsuit was brought by Bates Energy as plaintiff against COFS and Sam Taylor as defendants. COFS filed a First Amended Counterclaim, asserting counterclaims against Bates Energy and adding Naumann and ELC as defendants. COFS later moved for leave to file a Third Amended Counterclaim to join Unlimited Frac Sand (FSU), David Bravo, Lorena Silvistri Bravo, individually and d/b/a Bravo Consulting Services, Mark Sylla, Howard Resources, Tier 1 Sands, and the Rosenblatt Law Firm as additional counter-defendants. Docket no. 67. No Second Amended Counterclaim had been filed (or was ever filed). Although the motion for leave did not mention adding Stanley P. Bates as a counter-defendant, the proposed Third Amended Counterclaim did include him. And, after leave was granted, COFS filed the proposed Third Amended Counterclaim including Stanley P. Bates as a counter-defendant. As COFS acknowledges, it never filed a Second Amended Counterclaim. Thus, Stanley Bates first appears as a party in the Third Amended Counterclaim. Nevertheless, COFS did not request summons for Stanley Bates and has not served him. COFS is therefore directed to show cause why Stanley Bates should not be dismissed for failure to serve pursuant to Rule 4(m).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-167\">\n   <strong>\n    Conclusion\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-168\">\n   Mark Sylla's motion to dismiss pursuant to Rule 12(b)(2) for lack of personal jurisdiction (docket no. 86) is DENIED.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-169\">\n   Dwayne D.
