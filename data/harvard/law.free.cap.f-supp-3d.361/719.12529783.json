Finally, I will hold a decision on the ineffective assistance claims in abeyance pending the outcome of the hearing.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   <strong>\n    Background\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   The prosecution's case against Simmons permitted the jury to find that Simmons\n   and Bostic had been together on the morning of the murder; that Simmons was angry at Bostic, who won money, a gun, and speakers from Simmons while gambling; and that Simmons was seen leaving the crime scene with a gun in his hand.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   <strong>\n    A. The Withdrawn Alibi\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   To counter this evidence, the defense intended to present an alibi defense that Simmons was working at Excell Personnel, in Detroit, on June 28, 2006. Ten days before trial, defense counsel Luther Glenn Jr. filed an alibi notice regarding this defense. He also produced a list of supporting witnesses and copies of what apparently were Simmons's pay stubs. (ECF No. 7-1, PageID 97; ECF No. 7-4, PageID 186-87).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   On the morning of voir dire, however, defense counsel announced that he was withdrawing the alibi. (ECF No. 7-4, PageID 185 -86). Glenn informed the court that he had discussed this issue with Simmons, and, without objection, Simmons confirmed on the record that he understood \"we won't be calling these witnesses to support an alibi[.]\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   , PageID 186).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   Following this exchange, the prosecutor disclosed his belief that the pay stubs were forged and the alibi false. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   According to the prosecutor, his investigation revealed that: 1) Social Security records established that Simmons did not start working at Excell until much later in 2006; 2) Simmons had previously told police that he was unemployed at the time of the murder; 3) Simmons also told his probation officer in an unrelated case that he started working at Excell in November, 2006; and 4) an Excell managerial employee had never seen paystubs like the ones tendered by the defense. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   , PageID 187-89).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   \"I think what it looks like to me,\" the prosecutor concluded, \"is that maybe somebody in the Defendant's family - obviously it wasn't the Defendant because he was incarcerated in jail, but you can do a lot things with the computers these days and I think it's possible maybe somebody in his family\" created the paystubs. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   , PageID at 189). The prosecutor emphasized that defense counsel \"was as surprised at this as I was.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   This apparent fraud on the court notwithstanding, the trial judge did not make any factual findings as to the source of the false paystubs. During collateral review in state court, however, Simmons would file an affidavit stating that it was defense counsel himself who created this alibi and the supporting documentation. (ECF No. 17-2, PageID 1803, 1808).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   <strong>\n    B. Trial Evidence\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   On June 27, 2006 - the night before the murder - Bostic visited his mother's home with Simmons.

Direct Appeal\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   Represented by new counsel, Simmons filed a direct appeal in the Michigan Court of Appeals. He argued that the prosecutor committed misconduct by: 1) referring to statistics about crime in Detroit and urging the jury to convict Simmons to help stem the tide of violence in the city; 2) vouching for Horace Smith's credibility; and 3) denigrating defense counsel's reputation during rebuttal argument. Simmons also claimed that the trial court erred by admitting testimony that he did not express condolences for Bostic's death or attend his funeral. Finally, Simmons argued that the evidence was insufficient to convict.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   The state appellate court rejected these claims, vacated a duplicative conviction for second degree murder, and otherwise affirmed the convictions and sentence.\n   <em>\n    Simmons,\n    <extracted-citation index=\"22\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2011%20WL%203118802\">\n     supra\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"23\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2011%20WL%203118802\">\n    2011 WL 3118802\n   </extracted-citation>\n   at *1-5.

Federal Habeas Proceedings\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   On July 31, 2012, Simmons filed a \u00a7 2254 petition in this court. (ECF No. 1, PageID 6-7). The petition raised the same three claims that Simmons had raised on direct appeal. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   , PageID 3-4).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   After the Warden answered the petition and filed the state court record (ECF Nos. 6, 7), Simmons moved on April 9, 2013 for a stay of proceedings while he returned to the Michigan courts to exhaust four additional claims for relief. In support of the motion, Simmons explained that he had recently filed a motion under Michigan Criminal Rule 6.500 for relief from judgment in the state trial court. Judge David Lawson granted the motion to stay and ordered Simmons to file an amended petition within twenty-eight days after the\n   conclusion of the state court proceedings. (ECF No. 10).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   <strong>\n    1. Return to State Court\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   Simmons filed his motion for relief from judgment on April 9, 2013.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   The motion raised four claims:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-39\">\n   1. Ineffective assistance of trial counsel based on counsel's failure to conduct an adequate pretrial investigation into (A) Simmons's claim that someone else killed Bostic and (B) an alibi defense based on the testimony of Simmons's mother, brothers, sisters, and girlfriend that he was with them at an all-day family party at the time of the murder;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-40\">\n   2. Ineffective assistance of appellate counsel based on the failure to argue that trial counsel had been ineffective;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-41\">\n   3. Violation of his speedy trial rights and an inordinate delay between the time of the murder and his arrest; and\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-42\">\n   4. Improper admission of Simmons's statements to Bostic's mother.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   (ECF No. 17-2).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   In support of his trial counsel claim, Simmons submitted affidavits from his mother, three sisters, brother, and girlfriend, all of whom averred that Simmons was with them at an all-day family party on June 28, 2006. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   , PageID 1812-22). The witnesses added that this day was particularly memorable to them, as it was the day of the Detroit-Windsor International Fireworks Show. Simmons also submitted his own affidavit stating that he had advised counsel about this alibi and the supporting witnesses, and that counsel refused to investigate the defense. (ECF No. 17-2, PageID 1805).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   The state trial court denied the motion, concluding that Simmons could have raised his claims on direct appeal and that he did not show \"good cause\" for that failure and \"actual prejudice,\" as Michigan Court Rule 6.508(D)(3) required. (ECF No. 17 -3, PageID 1834-35). Simmons sought reconsideration of that decision, but the trial court adhered to its original decision. (ECF No. 17 -4; ECF No. 17-6).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   Simmons then moved for leave to file a delayed appeal in the Michigan Court of Appeals, seeking to press the same claims he had raised in his motion for relief from judgment. (ECF No. 17-7). The state appellate court denied the application because Simmons \"failed to meet the burden of establishing entitlement to relief under MCR 6.508(D).\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   , Page ID 1854).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   The Michigan Supreme Court denied Simmons's ensuing application for leave to appeal on June 30, 2015. (ECF No. 17-8).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   <strong>\n    2. Amended \u00a7 2254 Petition\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   In compliance with Judge Lawson's order, Simmons filed an amended habeas petition on July 22, 2015. (ECF No. 13, PageID 1363). The amended petition raised the three claims in Simmons's original petition and the four claims that Simmons raised in his motion for relief from judgment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-50\">\n   Simmons moved in March, 2016 to expand the record and for an evidentiary hearing. (ECF No. 22). He alleged that the state courts denied him a full and fair\n   hearing with respect to an affidavit he had obtained from Horace Smith that contradicted Smith's trial testimony. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   , PageID 2106). Besides the affidavit, Simmons also attached a report from a private investigator who interviewed Smith in 2015. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   , PageID 2109-12). Smith told the investigator that a Sergeant Clark showed him a picture of Simmons as they drove to the police station. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   , PageID 2110).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-51\">\n   Judge Lawson denied the motion, concluding that the only issue before was \"whether the state courts unreasonably determined any facts relating to the testimony of the witness in question or the circumstances in which he purported to identify the petitioner either before or at trial.\" (ECF No. 26, PageID 2120). Judge Lawson added that\n   <extracted-citation index=\"26\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%202254\">\n    28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (d) restricted his review of the case \"to the record before the state court.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   , PageID 2121).\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-52\">\n   In March, 2016, Judge Lawson appointed the federal public defender to represent Simmons (ECF Nos. 23, 25), and counsel filed a reply to the Warden's answer to the amended petition. (ECF No. 28).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-53\">\n   In August, 2018, following the recusal of Judge Lawson and all Judges of this District, Chief Judge Cole appointed me to sit by designation and adjudicate this case.

Claim One - Prosecutorial Misconduct\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-56\">\n   In his first ground for relief, Simmons alleges that the prosecutor committed misconduct in his opening statement, while questioning certain witnesses, and in closing arguments. (ECF No. 13, PageID 1366-68).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-57\">\n   The first component of the claim involves the prosecutor's reference to crime statistics and the fact that the \"Cold Case Unit\" of the Detroit Police Department investigated Bostic's murder.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-58\">\n   In his opening statement, the prosecutor mentioned that Bostic's murder case was known as \"File 06-223. That means it was the 223rd homicide in the City of Detroit in 2006[.]\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   , PageID1366). Then, while questioning the medical examiner, the prosecutor asked her to decode her office's internal file number relating to Bostic's case, ME case number 06-6132. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ). Finally, the prosecutor asked an evidence technician \"what portion of his business\" involved homicide investigations, to which the technician responded a \"greater per portion it\" [\n   <em>\n    sic\n   </em>\n   ]. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   , Page ID 1366-67).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-59\">\n   In the second part of the claim, Simmons alleges that the prosecutor vouched for Horace Smith's credibility. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   , PageID 1367). He supposedly did so, Simmons maintains, by telling the jury during his closing and rebuttal that Smith \"had nothing to gain and everything to lose\" by testifying. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-60\">\n   The Warden argues that this claim is procedurally defaulted because Simmons failed to object to the alleged misconduct at trial, and because the state appellate court relied on that failure to reject the claim. (ECF No. 16, PageID 1652). In the\n   alternative, the Warden argues that habeas relief is unavailable because the state court's decision rejecting the claim was not unreasonable. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   , PageID 1654 -56).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-61\">\n   <strong>\n    1.

The prosecutor then stated, \"And it[ ] [Elmon's case is] known as Detroit Police/Homicide file 06-223. That means it was the 223rd homicide in the City of Detroit in 2006 on June the 28th.\" When read in context, the prosecutor's statement was part of an explanation for the almost four-year span between Elmon's killing and trial. Moreover, the prosecutor did not use the fact that there were at least 223 homicides in Detroit in 2006 as a basis for convicting defendant. After making the comment, the prosecutor summarized the evidence that he would introduce to establish defendant's guilt. The prosecutor's comment was not improper.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-75\">\n   Second, during examination of Dr. Cheryl Loewe, the deputy chief medical examiner, the prosecutor asked Loewe if she had brought with her a file known in the medical examiner's office as case number 06-6132. Loewe replied that she had the file with her. She explained the case number: \"That's a number assigned by the medical examiner, and '06 would refer to the year 2006, and 6132 would represent a case number assigned to the decedent not necessarily in sequence of death calls or cases brought into their work.\" Contrary to defendant's assertion, the number 6132 has no \"shock value.\" Based on Loewe's testimony, the number has no direct relation to any crime statistics or to the senseless violence in Detroit. We find nothing improper in the prosecutor's question to Loewe.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-76\">\n   Third, the prosecutor asked Officer Donald Rem, an evidence technician called to the scene of Elmon's killing, what percentage of his \"business is homicide.\" Rem responded, \"Greater per portion of it.\" The question was asked by the prosecutor as part of an exchange in establishing Rem's training and credentials as an evidence technician.

In those circumstances, the prosecutor's references to the Cold Case Unit and the meaning of certain case file numbers might have assisted the jury's understanding of why that delay existed and how authorities had tried to handle the case. Likewise, the reference to what percentage of Rem's work involved homicide investigation went only to show that he was a qualified, experienced investigator.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-83\">\n   Finally, the state court permissibly concluded that there was no improper vouching for Smith's credibility.

This is especially true if one considers that evidence alongside,\n   <em>\n    inter alia\n   </em>\n   , Nita Bostic's testimony that Simmons never gave her Bostic's share of the proceeds from the alleged speakers sale, which she had told Simmons she needed to bury her son.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-100\">\n   For these reasons, the state appellate court's holding that the evidence was relevant was reasonable.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-101\">\n   <strong>\n    2.

Counsel also highlighted the contrast between Smith's trial testimony, where he was 100 percent certain of his identification, and an earlier deposition he gave to the prosecutor, where he was only eighty percent certain that Simmons was the man he had seen.

Claim Seven - Admission of Hearsay Evidence\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-137\">\n   Simmons's seventh claim alleges that the trial court erred when it allowed Nita Bostic to testify to statements that Simmons made to her during a phone conversation. (ECF No. 13, PageID 1378).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-138\">\n   After learning that her son had been killed, Nita testified, she called Simmons and asked him what had happened to Elmon. (ECF No. 7-5, PageID 511-12).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-139\">\n   Before she could answer, defense counsel objected that Nita could not relay Simmons's responses unless she could provide a verbatim account of what Simmons had said, as opposed to a mere summary of his words. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   , PageID 513-15). Outside the jury's presence, Nita recounted Simmons's statements to her and testified that \"that's exactly what [Simmons] told me.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   , PageID 517). The trial court therefore overruled the objection and permitted Nita to testify that Simmons told her: 1) \"I haven't seen Elmon and I don't know what happened to him\"; 2) he had sold the speakers he and Elmon had for $ 200; and 3) he would call Nita back about giving her Elmon's share of the $ 200 he got for the speakers. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   , PageID 519 -20).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-140\">\n   The admission of this testimony provides no basis for relief.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-141\">\n   First, there is no federal constitutional requirement that a witness must provide a \"verbatim\" account of a defendant's out of court statements before she may testify to those statements. Second, and in any event, Nita testified that she recounted \"exactly\" what Simmons had told her, and so her testimony would have been admissible even under the rule that Simmons advocates for.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-142\">\n   Finally, there is no merit to Simmons's related claim that trial counsel was ineffective for not blocking admission of this testimony. (ECF No. 13, PageID 1378-79).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-143\">\n   Most simply put, defense counsel made his objection, and the trial court overruled him. That defense counsel apparently failed to follow up on his representation to the trial court that he would provide case law supporting his objection is irrelevant: there was no merit to his objection, whether under Michigan law or federal law, and Simmons has yet to cite any decision, whether from Michigan or another jurisdiction, that would have supported his objection to Bostic's testimony. Accordingly, Simmons is not entitled to relief on his seventh claim.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-144\">\n   <strong>\n    F. Claims Four and Five - Ineffective Assistance of Trial and Appellate Counsel\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-145\">\n   In his fourth ground for relief, Simmons argues that trial counsel was ineffective for failing to conduct an adequate investigation into: 1) his claim that someone else had killed Bostic; and 2) an alibi defense based on his family members' testimony that Simmons was at a family party at the time of Bostic's murder.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-146\">\n   His fifth ground for relief is closely related, alleging that appellate counsel was ineffective for not challenging trial counsel's ineffectiveness on direct appeal.\n   <footnotemark>\n    7\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-147\">\n   The Warden argues that these claims are untimely, procedurally defaulted, barred under \u00a7 2254(d), and meritless even under de novo review. As I explain below, I agree that the claims are time-barred, but I conclude that further proceedings are needed to determine whether Simmons's innocence claim should excuse his untimely filing.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-148\">\n   Although I was able to dispose of Simmons's other untimely claims on the merits, the ineffective assistance claims are not so insubstantial that I can bypass the Warden's timeliness defenses and deny them on the merits.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-149\">\n   On the contrary, Simmons presented the state courts, and has presented this court, with affidavits establishing that trial counsel knew about an alibi defense supported by multiple witnesses whose testimony, if believed by the jury, would have made it impossible for Simmons to have killed Bostic. He also presented evidence, in the form of his own affidavit and those of his family members, establishing that trial counsel did not contact the witnesses or otherwise investigate the alibi defense.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-150\">\n   Nevertheless, the state courts denied relief, either on procedural grounds or on the merits.

Simmons's Claim\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-172\">\n   Simmons's actual innocence claim has three components\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-173\">\n   The first is Simmons's alibi. To support that claim, Simmons has submitted affidavits from: 1) his sisters Nakiya Mitchell, Sa'keenah Simmons, Yulanda Mitchell (and her boyfriend); 2) his brother Derek Mitchell; 3) his mother Gloria Mitchell and his stepfather Carl Johnson; 4) his then-girlfriend Brittany Chavous; and 5) a woman named Tracie McElroy.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-174\">\n   The gist of these affidavits is that Simmons was present at an all-day family party, which took place at his sister Sa'keenah Simmons's apartment, at the time Bostic was killed. These witnesses state that the day of Bostic's murder - June 28, 2006 - was memorable to them because it was the date of the Detroit-Windsor international fireworks show, when many families have such all-day parties. Additionally, Nakiya Mitchell would have testified that she owned a blue Crown Victoria, that she lent it to Simmons, but that he returned it to her around 10:45 a.m. on June 28.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-175\">\n   Simmons alleges that he told trial counsel about these witnesses and the alibi they could have provided. Nevertheless, Simmons claims, trial counsel refused to interview them. For their part, the witnesses say that, had trial counsel contacted them, they would have told counsel that they were willing to testify for Simmons that he was present at the family party at the time Bostic was murdered.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-176\">\n   The second component is an affidavit from Horace Smith.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-177\">\n   In contrast to his trial testimony, Smith swears in his affidavit that the police officer escorting him to the station to view the line-up showed him a picture of a light-skinned African-American man (i.e., Simmons). (Doc. 13-2, PageID 1597). Smith\n   then states that he recognized Simmons from that photo during the actual line-up procedure. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ). However, Smith never says that Simmons was\n   <em>\n    not\n   </em>\n   the man he saw near the crime scene after the shooting.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-178\">\n   On this score, Simmons has also submitted an affidavit from a man named Cordell Lowe.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-179\">\n   Lowe, whose relationship to Simmons or Smith is unclear, states that Smith told him that police officers showed him at least two photo lineups before he viewed the in-person lineup, and that Simmons was the only light-skinned African-American in both of the photo lineups. Lowe also claims to have an audio recording of his conversation with Smith.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-180\">\n   Finally, Simmons has offered a theory as to who the real killer might be.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-181\">\n   Simmons claims that, on either the night before or the morning of the murder, he agreed to help Bostic steal a car. He insists, however, that it was Bostic who stripped the car and was eager to sell the stolen parts to a third party.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-182\">\n   Simmons then claims that a man named Peanut, who was Pasua Keith's boyfriend, was present at Keith's house with him and Bostic. Keith and Peanut allegedly helped Bostic find someone to whom to sell the car's speakers. At some point, the owner of the stolen car learned that Bostic was responsible for stealing his car; he then posed as the interested buyer and killed Bostic.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-183\">\n   As far as I can tell, however, Simmons offers no evidence - other than his own subjective beliefs - to support this \"other killer\" theory.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-184\">\n   <strong>\n    b. Warden's Response\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-185\">\n   The Warden argues that Simmons's innocence claim is implausible and subject to summary rejection.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-186\">\n   <strong>\n    i. Alibi Evidence\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-187\">\n   He first contends that I cannot consider the alibi evidence at all because it was known to Simmons at trial, and thus does not qualify as \"new evidence\" for purposes of the innocence exception. (ECF No. 16, PageID 1648).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-188\">\n   This argument rests on an incorrect premise. For purposes of the innocence exception, evidence is \"new\" as long as it was not presented at trial. As the Supreme Court explained in\n   <em>\n    Schlup,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1333576\" index=\"144\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/513/298/#p329\">\n     supra\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1333576\" index=\"145\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/513/298/#p329\">\n    513 U.S. at 324\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1333576\" index=\"146\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/513/298/#p329\">\n    115 S.Ct. 851\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , an innocence claim is credible only if the petitioner can \"support his allegations of constitutional error with new reliable evidence - whether it be exculpatory scientific evidence, trustworthy eyewitness accounts, or critical physical evidence -\n   <em>\n    that was not presented at trial\n   </em>\n   .\" (Emphasis supplied). The Warden cites no authority suggesting otherwise. (ECF No. 16, PageID 1648).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-189\">\n   The Warden also argues that the timing of the alibi defense makes it incredible. He points out that the defense did not emerge until 2012, some two years after the trial. He contends that, if Simmons really had been at the family party, he and his relatives would have been \"scream[ing] that defense from the rooftops.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   , PageID 1649).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-190\">\n   To be sure, \"[a] federal habeas court, faced with an actual-innocence gateway claim, should count unjustifiable delay on a habeas petitioner's part, not as an absolute barrier to relief, but as a factor in determining whether actual innocence has been reliably shown.\"\n   <em>\n    McQuiggin,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12697052\" index=\"147\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/569/383/#p399\">\n     supra\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12697052\" index=\"148\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/569/383/#p399\">\n    569 U.S. at 385\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12697052\" index=\"149\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/569/383/#p399\">\n    133 S.Ct. 1924\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-191\">\n   While the Warden's argument about delayed assertion of the alibi is not entirely without force, the delay is not, standing alone, sufficient to reject Simmons's innocence claim.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-192\">\n   For one thing, Simmons's mother filed a grievance against trial counsel immediately after the trial. (ECF No. 13-1, PageID 1455). One of her complaints was that \"none of [Simmons's] evidence or witness[es] were submitted on his behalf. Which the attorney had knowledge of. Evidence that would have clearly excluded Paul Simmons from the scene.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ).\n   <footnotemark>\n    8\n   </footnotemark>\n   These allegations, though lacking in specifics, are consistent with Simmons's claim that he told counsel about the alibi witnesses but counsel failed or refused to contact them.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-193\">\n   For another, Simmons's claim that counsel refused to interview his family members or otherwise pursue the alibi defense would, if proved, explain, to a significant degree, the delay in bringing that evidence forward. After all, a criminal defendant must of necessity rely on his attorney to evaluate the case against him, act on the information that the defendant supplies, and make reasonable strategic choices as to how best to defend the client against those charges. But if counsel unreasonably refuses to investigate a potentially meritorious alibi, such that the alibi surfaces only during collateral review in connection with an ineffective assistance claim, it would be unfair to hold that delay entirely against the defendant.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-194\">\n   Finally, Simmons's current attorney has made a convincing argument that Simmons acted diligently from his prison cell to gather all of the alibi evidence while pursuing both federal habeas relief and the motion for relief from judgment in state court. (Doc. 28, PageID 2141-42).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-195\">\n   For these reasons, I cannot discount the alibi evidence out of hand based only on the fact that it emerged in 2012.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-196\">\n   <strong>\n    ii. The Withdrawn Alibi\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-197\">\n   The Warden's most substantial argument centers on the withdrawn alibi that would have placed Simmons at work at the time of the murder. He argues that, had Simmons's family members testified that Simmons was with them at a family party on June 28, 2006, the prosecution could have impeached them with evidence that they had previously offered a falsified alibi, thereby permitting the jury to conclude that this alibi, too, was false.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-198\">\n   If one or more of Simmons's family members were behind the first alibi, then there is little to no chance that a reasonable juror would accept testimony from those family members about a second alibi for Simmons. Likewise, if defense counsel knew that Simmons's family members had concocted the first alibi, he could have, in all likelihood, reasonably declined to call those witnesses to testify about a different alibi.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-199\">\n   But the record does not establish that Simmons or someone close to him forged the paystubs that were at the heart of the withdrawn alibi. Because the state trial court made no factual findings on this issue before trial or during postconviction review, the record does not permit me to determine who created the paystubs or whether that person or persons was or were among Simmons's alibi witnesses. Indeed, Simmons contends that trial counsel forged the paystubs and concocted the withdrawn alibi.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-200\">\n   These unresolved factual questions, which go to the heart of Simmons's innocence claim (and, as well, his ineffective assistance claims), simply underscore the need for a hearing.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-201\">\n   <strong>\n    iii. Smith's Affidavit\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-202\">\n   With respect to Horace Smith's affidavit, the Warden argues that I should view it with \"extreme suspicion\" because it recants Smith's trial testimony that no one had showed him any pictures that might have influenced his identification of Simmons. (ECF No. 16, PageID 1703).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-203\">\n   I of course accept that post-trial affidavits that recant trial testimony should be treated with skepticism.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.,\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Mahaffey v. Scutt\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"150\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2014%20WL%204206947\">\n    2014 WL 4206947\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , *4 (E.D. Mich. 2014) (Levy, J.) (citing\n   <em>\n    United States v. Chambers\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"10528259\" index=\"151\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/944/1253/#p1264\">\n    944 F.2d 1253\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 1264 (6th Cir.1991) (\"The new evidence brought forward by petitioner, ... recanting affidavits and witnesses, is viewed with 'extreme suspicion.') ).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-204\">\n   But here, Smith was a disinterested witness with no relationship to Simmons or Bostic. Nothing in his affidavit indicates, moreover, that someone pressured him to alter his trial testimony. Indeed, his affidavit does\n   <em>\n    not\n   </em>\n   recant his in-court identification of Simmons as the man he claimed to have seen with a gun leaving the area where Bostic's body was found.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-205\">\n   Furthermore, Smith's claim - corroborated by Cordell Lowe's affidavit and, as well, Smith's statements to the private investigator - would, if true, undermine the reliability of his identification of Simmons.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-206\">\n   As the prosecutor acknowledged at trial, Smith was \"the most important witness in this case.\" (ECF No. 7 -8, PageID 956). He was the only witness who placed Simmons near the scene of the crime. But Smith did not identify Simmons until more than three years after the crime. At trial, he said that he was one hundred percent certain that Simmons was the man he had seen on the day of the murder, whereas he had previously told the prosecutor he was only eighty percent certain of the identification. He also admitted telling prosecutors that the car he had seen leaving the scene was tan, not blue.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-207\">\n   To be sure, the jury knew about these grounds to question the reliability and accuracy of Smith's testimony. But Smith was insistent that the police had not done anything to influence his identification of Simmons - testimony that he has now walked back. While Smith's affidavit would not on its own be sufficient to support an actual innocence claim, it, in combination with the testimony of at least six or seven of Simmons's family members that Simmons was with them at the time of the murder, does support Simmons's claim\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-208\">\n   <strong>\n    iv. Summary\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-209\">\n   Much remains to be proved in this case, including,\n   <em>\n    inter alia\n   </em>\n   , whether Simmons advised his lawyer of the alibi defense; what investigation, if any, counsel conducted into that defense; whether the alibi witnesses were truthful in their affidavits; whether any of Simmons's alibi witnesses were involved in developing the withdrawn alibi defense; and the exact circumstances surrounding and preceding Smith's identification of Simmons.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-210\">\n   All of these considerations go, in my view, to the credibility, and thus the viability, of the innocence claim, and need to be resolved before I can make an informed ruling on the claim. At this juncture, however, the claim is sufficiently compelling that I cannot dispose of it summarily on the briefs alone. Indeed, had the jury heard Simmons's alibi witnesses testify uniformly that Simmons was in their presence at the time of the murder, it may very well have been the case that no rational juror among them would have voted to convict.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-211\">\n   <strong>\n    Conclusion\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-212\">\n   It is, therefore,\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-213\">\n   ORDERED THAT:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-214\">\n   1. Simmons's first, second, third, sixth, and seventh grounds for habeas relief\n   be, and the same hereby are, denied with prejudice;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-215\">\n   2. I will hold an evidentiary hearing to resolve Simmons's claim that he is actually innocent, such that I may reach the merits of his untimely claims that trial and appellate counsel were ineffective.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-216\">\n   3. The Clerk of Court shall forthwith set this case for a telephonic status/scheduling conference.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-217\">\n   4. At the status/scheduling conference, counsel should be prepared to discuss what kind of discovery is needed to prepare for the hearing, how the discovery process can be conducted fairly and expeditiously, a schedule for doing so and for the hearing, and any other issues that counsel believe I should be aware of.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-218\">\n   5. Counsel should also be prepared to discuss whether the hearing should be expanded to receive evidence as to the merits of Simmons's ineffective assistance claims, in particular as to the performance prong of the claims. In my view, the merits of the\n   <em>\n    Strickland\n   </em>\n   claims overlap to a large extent with the merits of the innocence claim. Because the hearing will be focused on the alibi evidence, it would seem to be an efficient use of resources to use the hearing to learn what trial and appellate counsel knew about the alibi defense, particularly given that trial counsel will be an indispensable witness on the innocence claim. Should I conclude that Simmons's innocence claim excuses his untimely filing, having a complete record regarding trial counsel's handling of the alibi evidence, and appellate counsel's handling of the direct appeal, would avoid the need for a second hearing should I conclude either that I may review the claims under \u00a7 2254(a) or that the state court's rejection of the claims was unreasonable.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Sanders v.
