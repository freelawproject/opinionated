That motion will be granted and the plaintiff's complaint will be dismissed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   BACKGROUND\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   The facts of this case are set forth in this Court's December 12, 2017 Memorandum and Order. Filing 56. Briefly summarized, the plaintiff, Stephanie Ideus, received the birth control ParaGard T380 Intrauterine Copper Contraceptive. Filing 81 at 6. Four years later, as her physician was removing the ParaGard, a piece of the device broke off and embedded in the myometrium of the plaintiff's uterine wall. Filing 81 at 7. The broken piece was surgically removed in 2016. Filing 81 at 7.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   Ideus claims she was not adequately warned of the possible risks associated with ParaGard.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   filing 96 at 3. To support that contention, Ideus points to an \"Information for Patients\" brochure she received before the device was implanted, and to the product's package insert, which contains prescribing information for treating physicians.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   filing 96 at 3. Both sets of materials, she alleges, lack any warning that the ParaGard \"could break during removal,\" or that smaller pieces of the device (as opposed to the device as a whole) could separate and become embedded \"deep in the uterus[.]\" Filing 96 at 6. Ideus has sued the manufacturers of the device, Teva Pharmaceuticals and Teva Women's Health (collectively, Teva), for allegedly failing to provide adequate warnings.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   filing 21 at 6-17. Teva moves for summary judgment, and for the reason set forth below, that motion will be granted.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   STANDARD OF REVIEW\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   Summary judgment is proper if the movant shows that there is no genuine dispute as to any material fact and that the movant is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Fed. R. Civ. P. 56(a). The movant bears the initial responsibility of informing the Court of the basis for the motion, and must identify those portions of the record which the movant believes demonstrate the absence of a genuine issue of material fact.\n   <em>\n    Torgerson v.

Hoffman-La Roche, Inc.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"317659\" index=\"8\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/neb/260/552/\">\n    260 Neb. 552\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"317659\" index=\"9\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/neb/260/552/\">\n    618 N.W.2d 827\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 841 (2000) ;\n   <em>\n    Rahmig v. Mosley Machinery Co.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5398014\" index=\"10\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/neb/226/423/\">\n    226 Neb. 423\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5398014\" index=\"11\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/neb/226/423/\">\n    412 N.W.2d 56\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1987). In other words, a manufacturer's duty to produce a safe product, with appropriate warnings and\n   instructions when necessary, is no different from the responsibility each of us bears to exercise due care to avoid unreasonable risks of harm to others.\n   <em>\n    Freeman\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"317659\" index=\"12\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/neb/260/552/\">\n    618 N.W.2d at 841\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   According to Ideus, Teva breached this duty. More specifically, Ideus claims that neither the warning given to her prescribing physician (\n   <em>\n    i.e.\n   </em>\n   , the package insert), nor the information received directly by Ideus (\n   <em>\n    i.e.\n   </em>\n   , the patient brochure) adequately, if at all, warned of the risk of \"embedment or breakage.\" Filing 57 at 5-6. Teva, on the other hand, argues that the only relevant warning label, the one in the package insert, was adequate as a matter of law.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   filing 81 at 5. Alternatively, Teva contends that Ideus' claim is preempted by federal law because it could not unilaterally change ParaGard's warning labels without violating federal regulations. Filing 81 at 17-23.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   The Court need not address Teva's latter contention. Even assuming (without deciding) that Ideus' failure-to-warn claim is not preempted, that claim fails nonetheless. But before explaining why that is true, the Court must take a brief detour though the history and applicability of the doctrine underlying much of the parties' dispute: the learned intermediary doctrine.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   The learned intermediary doctrine is an exception to the general rule that a manufacturer or seller is subject to liability for failing either to warn or adequately to warn about a risk or hazard inherent in the way a product is designed or reasonably foreseeable uses that may be made of the products it sells.\n   <em>\n    Freeman\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"317659\" index=\"13\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/neb/260/552/\">\n    618 N.W.2d at 841\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . In essence, the doctrine provides that when prescription drugs are involved, a manufacturers' duty to warn is discharged so long as the manufacturer provided adequate warnings to a patient's prescribing health-care provider.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"317659\" index=\"14\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/neb/260/552/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   But not all courts agree that the learned intermediary doctrine applies to prescription contraceptives. Some courts distinguish contraceptives from other prescription drugs and decline to apply the learned intermediary doctrine.\n   <em>\n    MacDonald v. Ortho Pharm. Corp\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"385114\" index=\"15\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/mass/394/131/\">\n    394 Mass. 131\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"16\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=475%20N.E.2d%2065\">\n    475 N.E.2d 65\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1985) ;\n   <em>\n    Stephens v.

And in those jurisdictions, the learned intermediary doctrine applies to all prescription drugs or devices-including contraceptives.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   Although the Nebraska Supreme Court has adopted the learned intermediary doctrine,\n   <em>\n    Freeman\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"317659\" index=\"31\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/neb/260/552/\">\n    260 Neb. at 571\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"317659\" index=\"32\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/neb/260/552/\">\n    618 N.W.2d 827\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , it has yet to address whether it would recognize an exception to the learned intermediary doctrine for prescription contraceptives. So, this Court is tasked with predicting whether the Nebraska Supreme Court would apply the learned intermediary doctrine to contraceptives.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   According to Teva, the Nebraska Supreme Court would apply the learned intermediary doctrine. In support of that argument, Teva points to the rationale behind the learned intermediary doctrine:\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   \"the physician, as the prescriber of a drug, is in the best position to give a highly individualized warning to a patient based on the physician's knowledge of the patient and the inherent risks of the drug.\"\n   <em>\n    Kociemba v. G.D. Searle &amp; Co.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3961836\" index=\"33\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp/680/1293/#p1305\">\n    680 F.Supp. 1293\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 1305 (D. Minn. 1988). And because contraceptives are prescribed by physicians, Teva argues that the doctrine necessarily applies.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   filing 81 at 27-18. Ideus, however, claims that the Nebraska Supreme Court would distinguish between contraceptives and other prescription drugs. This is true, Ideus argues, because contraceptives are, by their very nature, distinguishable from average prescription drugs.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   filing 90 at 13-15.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   This Court agrees with Teva. It is true that Ideus' view is consistent with courts in Massachusetts and Michigan,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    MacDonald\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"34\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=475%20N.E.2d%2065\">\n    475 N.E.2d at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   66 ;\n   <em>\n    Stephens\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3737021\" index=\"35\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp/602/379/\">\n    602 F.Supp. at 380\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . And Ideus view is also consistent with the Eighth Circuit's decision predicting Arkansas law in\n   <em>\n    Hill v. Searle Labs., a Div. of Searle Pharm., Inc.\n   </em>\n   -a decision Ideus relies on extensively to support why, in her view, Nebraska would create an exception to the learned intermediary doctrine for contraceptives.\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11362019\" index=\"36\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/884/1064/#p1070\">\n    884 F.2d 1064\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 1070 (8th Cir. 1989). But after\n   <em>\n    Hill\n   </em>\n   was decided, the Arkansas Supreme Court determined to the contrary that the learned intermediary doctrine\n   <em>\n    does\n   </em>\n   apply to contraceptives.\n   <em>\n    West v. Searle Co.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1916740\" index=\"37\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ark/305/33/\">\n    305 Ark. 33\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1916740\" index=\"38\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ark/305/33/\">\n    806 S.W.2d 608\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 614 (1991). And just as important, the factors articulated in\n   <em>\n    Hill\n   </em>\n   for a modified approach to the learned intermediary doctrine, if applied in this case, counsel in favor of applying the doctrine.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   In\n   <em>\n    Hill\n   </em>\n   , the plaintiff sued the manufacturer of her copper IUD after the product perforated her uterus and partially imbedded itself in her uterine wall.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1916740\" index=\"39\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ark/305/33/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   The district court determined that the plaintiff could not recover because her doctor had been given adequate warnings, severing the causal connection under the learned intermediary doctrine.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 1071. But a divided panel of the Eighth Circuit predicted that the Arkansas Supreme Court would distinguish contraceptives from other prescription drug products, and would instead require \"either a warning-meaningful and complete so as to be understood by the recipient-or an individualized medical judgment that this treatment or medication is necessary and desirable for this patient.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 1071. And the Court of Appeals concluded that IUD prescription is not the result of \"individualized medical judgment.\"\n   <em>\n    See id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   In reaching that conclusion, the Eighth Circuit focused on several factors which, in its view, distinguished contraceptive prescriptions from other prescription medication. First, the court opined that birth control is a private matter often dependent on factors such as \"effectiveness, convenience or cost, rather than medical necessity.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Second, the court focused on the manufacturer's decision to market directly to the consumer with the idea of convincing women to choose the IUD.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Third, the court thought that beyond the initial contact, there is little to no contact between physician and patient regarding the choice and the risks of using IUD's.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   And finally, the court believed that contraceptives are given more often than not under clinic-type conditions where physician-patient contact is limited.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Together, those factors, the court said, supported the plaintiff's position that contraceptives stand apart from other prescription drugs rendering the learned intermediary doctrine inapplicable.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   But-to the extent that the Eighth Circuit's assumptions regarding how birth control was prescribed in 1991 remain vital over 25 years later-the majority of the factors relied on in\n   <em>\n    Hill\n   </em>\n   are absent here. First, although Ideus' IUD was placed under\n   \"clinic-like\" conditions, there is no evidence to suggest that physician-patient contact was particularly limited in this case.\n   <em>\n    Cf.\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Hill\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11362019\" index=\"40\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/884/1064/#p1070\">\n    884 F.2d at 1070\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . To the contrary. Ideus testified that she \"regularly\" visited her prescribing physician over the years. Filing 95 at 19. During her annual visit in 2011, Ideus told her doctor that she wanted to use a long-term contraceptive. Filing 95 at 20. After Ideus and her physician \"discussed [ ] what [her] options were,\" Ideus was given literature on ParaGard. Filing 95 at 20. On a later date, Ideus' ParaGard was inserted by her physician. Filing 95 at 20. So, unlike\n   <em>\n    Hill\n   </em>\n   , there was actually significant physician-patient contact between Ideus and her prescribing physician.\n   <em>\n    Cf.\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Hill\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11362019\" index=\"41\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/884/1064/#p1070\">\n    884 F.2d at 1070\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   Second, there is no record evidence suggesting that Teva actually marketed directly to consumers near the time Ideus had ParaGard inserted.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   Filing 97 at 6;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   filing 91-2,91-3. Nor is there any evidence that Ideus even saw a ParaGard advertisement-much less relied on one-in choosing ParaGard as her preferred method of contraception.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   filing 97 at 6;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   filing 91-2,91-3. To the contrary, the only evidence before the Court is that Ideus relied on the advice and literature given to her by her prescribing doctor in choosing ParaGard-a fact that actually weighs in favor of applying the learned intermediary doctrine, not against it. Filing 95 at 20-21.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   And that brings the Court to the final distinguishing factor emphasized by the\n   <em>\n    Hill\n   </em>\n   court: the patient's undoubted right to choose her own contraception.\n   <em>\n    Cf.\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Hill\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11362019\" index=\"42\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/884/1064/#p1070\">\n    884 F.2d at 1070\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Although the Court agrees that factors such as \"effectiveness, convenience or cost\" might be considered by a patient when choosing among suggested contraception, those are not the factors Ideus focused on in this case.\n   <em>\n    Cf.\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11362019\" index=\"43\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/884/1064/#p1070\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11362019\" index=\"43\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/884/1064/#p1070\">\n    at 1070\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Instead, Ideus testified that in making her decision, at the forefront of her considerations were factors such as whether the contraceptive \"was hormone free ... reliable ... and would last long term.\" Filing 95 at 20.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   And determining what contraceptive fits that particular criteria necessarily requires the knowledge and advice of a physician. Thus, the Court sees no reason to distinguish between a patient's final choice to use a particular contraceptive and a patient's final decision relating to any other course if treatment. After all,\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-32\">\n   [t]he fact that the patient makes the final choice among suggested contraceptives (or decides not to use any at all) does not constitute a distinction which makes the [learned intermediary] rule inapplicable. [The Court] can readily conceive of situations in which a physician gives the patient a choice of courses to follow. There is, for example, a patient's choice between continuing to endure a physical ailment or submitting to surgery or some other course of treatment; an obese person's choice among\n   diets suggested by the doctor; and a surgery patient's choice of anesthesia where, in the doctor's opinion, a choice is permissible.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-33\">\n   In any such situation which may come to mind, the patient is expected to look to the physician for guidance and not to the manufacturer of the products which he may use or prescribe in the course of treatment.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   <em>\n    Terhune\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"44\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=577%20P.2d%20975\">\n    577 P.2d at 978\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . That logic is particularly true here.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   In sum, the Court concludes that this case is distinguishable from\n   <em>\n    Hill\n   </em>\n   . More broadly though, whatever differences there may be between contraceptives and \"typical\" prescription drugs, they have one important thing in common: both are\n   <em>\n    always\n   </em>\n   prescribed by a physician or through the services of a physician. And when a patient relies on the skill and knowledge of a physician in any particular method of treatment, the learned intermediary doctrine ought to apply.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Terhune\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"45\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=577%20P.2d%20975\">\n    577 P.2d at 978\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . This is no less true for prescription contraceptives as for any other prescription medication.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   Moreover, the Nebraska Supreme Court not only adopted the learned intermediary doctrine-it expressly adopted the doctrine as stated in the Restatement (Third) of Torts: Prod. Liab. \u00a7 6(d) (1998).\n   <em>\n    Freeman\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"317659\" index=\"46\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/neb/260/552/\">\n    260 Neb. at 571\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"317659\" index=\"47\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/neb/260/552/\">\n    618 N.W.2d 827\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . And that section of the Restatement acknowledges circumstances under which the doctrine might not be applicable: \"when reasonable instructions or warnings ... are not provided to ... the patient when the manufacturer knows or has reason to know that health-care providers will not be in a position to reduce the risks of harm in accordance with the instructions or warnings.\" Restatement, \u00a7 6(d)(2). There is nothing in the record or the parties' arguments to suggest with respect to contraceptives in general, or Ideus' circumstances in particular, that a health care provider is not in a position to reduce the risk of any foreseeable harm to the patient. In other words, the Nebraska Supreme Court\n   <em>\n    did\n   </em>\n   acknowledge the possibility of exceptions to the learned intermediary doctrine, when it expressly adopted \u00a7 6(d) of the Restatement-but nothing suggests that such an exception should be recognized here.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   Based on the foregoing, the Court determines that if presented with this decision, the Nebraska Supreme Court would following the overwhelming majority of decisions that have applied the learned intermediary doctrine to cases involving contraceptives.\n   <em>\n    Odom v.

Kinney, M.D., faculty physician at the University of Nebraska Medical Center in the Department of Obstetrics &amp; Gynecology, also opined that \"the instructions and warnings in that ParaGard labeling adequately warned about the possible risks of embedment, breakage of the ParaGard, and surgical removal, including an embedded arm breaking on removal of the ParaGard.\" Filing 85 at 4.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   And Ideus has not come forward with any evidence to dispute those conclusions: she has neither submitted testimony of her own expert challenging the opinions of Dr. Davis and Dr. Kinney, nor has she pointed the Court to any medical literature suggesting ParaGard's warnings might not be adequate.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Scelta\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4082509\" index=\"91\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-appx/404/92/#p94\">\n    404 F.

Instead, Ideus generally argues that because there are numerous reports of breakage and embedment, the ParaGard warnings were necessarily \"ambiguous and incomplete.\" Filing 96 at 33. But that evidence does not demonstrate how the actual warnings given were inadequate-it only proves that the risks warned against actually occurred with some frequency.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   filing 90 at 6-11. Nor is the Court persuaded by Ideus' contention that the ParaGard warnings are suddenly inadequate because the package insert did not specifically warn that \"ParaGard could break during removal or that it could be broken before removal if the threads could be found.\"\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   filing 96 at 33. Any distinction as to when precisely ParaGard could break, or whether the threads could be found before removal, does not in any way diminish the warnings actually given. And despite Ideus' assertions, the prescribing physician was warned of the exact scenario at issue here: that embedment and breakage can make removal difficult, and in some instances, surgery may be required to remove ParaGard.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   filing 57 at 5.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   In sum, based on the evidence before it, the Court concludes that there can be no genuine dispute of as to the adequacy of the ParaGard warning.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Freeman\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"317659\" index=\"93\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/neb/260/552/\">\n    618 N.W.2d at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   841 ;\n   <em>\n    Vallejo\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"94\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2014%20WL%204922901\">\n    2014 WL 4922901\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *3 ;\n   <em>\n    Scelta\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4082509\" index=\"95\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-appx/404/92/#p94\">\n    404 F.
