First, Plaintiff argues that Defendant Soto's submission of the DMCA notice to Draft2Digital, a distributor that has its principal address in Oklahoma, constituted a contact with Oklahoma sufficient to satisfy the requirements of specific personal jurisdiction.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Pl.'s Resp. at 21-25; Am. Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 8, 44. Second, Plaintiff submits that Defendant Soto's alleged tortious interference with Plaintiff's contract with Draft2Digital constitutes an independent basis for exercising specific personal jurisdiction over Defendant Soto.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Pl.'s Resp. at 26-27; Am.

Compl. \u00b6 44; Am. Compl. Ex. 3 (Doc. No. 6-3). As an initial matter, the parties dispute whether Defendant Soto was personally involved in sending the DMCA notice to Draft2Digital. In support of its allegation that Defendant Soto was involved, Plaintiff points to an email written by Draft2Digital's director of operations that states that Draft2Digital had \"been contacted by the author Addison Cain [a/k/a Rachelle Soto] regarding an infringement on her titles.\" Am. Comp. Ex. 3, at 2. Plaintiff further provides the affidavit testimony of Ms. Margarita Coale that \"[Plaintiff] was advised by Draft2Digital that, on or about April 19, 2018, Blushing [Books] and [Soto] delivered a 'take-down' notice to Draft2Digital.\" Coale Aff. \u00b6 4.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   In her Motion and Reply, Defendant Soto disputes that she personally notified Draft2Digital of the alleged infringement, contending instead that the DMCA notice was sent by Blushing Books alone.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Def. Soto Mot. at 9-10; Def. Soto Reply (Doc. No. 24) at 2. As support for her assertion, Defendant Soto points out that the DMCA notice sent to Draft2Digital was signed solely by Blushing Books' office manager.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Def. Soto Reply at 2; Am. Compl. Ex. 3, at 2, 6.

Soto Aff. (Def. Soto Mot. Ex. 1 (Doc. No. 18-1) ) at 1-2.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   While Defendant Soto's argument presents a factual dispute regarding whether Defendant Soto personally directed the DMCA notice to Draft2Digital, the Court is constrained to resolve factual disputes in Plaintiff's favor for purposes of determining personal jurisdiction.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Fed.

The Tenth Circuit added that while \"[s]ome courts have held that the 'expressly aimed' portion of\n   <em>\n    Calder\n   </em>\n   is satisfied when the defendant individually targets a known forum resident,\" the Tenth Circuit takes a \"somewhat more restrictive approach,\" namely, that \"the forum state itself must be the 'focal point of the tort.' \"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 1074 n.9 (alteration and internal quotation marks omitted).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   The Tenth Circuit revisited the issue of personal jurisdiction in the internet context in\n   <em>\n    Shrader v. Biddinger\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4091446\" index=\"38\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/633/1235/#p1248\">\n    633 F.3d 1235\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . In that case, the plaintiff was a writer who lived and worked in Oklahoma. One defendant, the plaintiff's business partner, stopped doing business with the plaintiff and sent an email explaining his reasoning to a list of customers. Another defendant then posted the email on an internet forum.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4091446\" index=\"39\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/633/1235/#p1248\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4091446\" index=\"39\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/633/1235/#p1248\">\n    at 1237-38\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . The plaintiff brought a defamation action in Oklahoma, which the district court dismissed for lack of personal jurisdiction. In determining that the defendant who posted the email to the online forum had not \"expressly aimed\" his conduct at the forum state, the Tenth Circuit looked at the nature of the web forum, the content of the plaintiff's literary works, and the content of the defamatory email. The Tenth Circuit highlighted that the web forum \"[had] no particular connection with Oklahoma\" because it did not specifically \"target[ ] an Oklahoma audience or the work of Oklahoma writers.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4091446\" index=\"40\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/633/1235/#p1248\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4091446\" index=\"40\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/633/1235/#p1248\">\n    at 1242, 1244\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Regarding the plaintiff's literary works, the Court found that \"there [was] nothing about the content ..., or [the plaintiff's] internet customer base, that [had] been shown to have any tie to Oklahoma.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4091446\" index=\"41\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/633/1235/#p1248\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4091446\" index=\"41\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/633/1235/#p1248\">\n    at 1244\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Finally, the Court determined that \"Oklahoma was not the focal point of the email posted by [the defendant], either in terms of its audience or its content.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4091446\" index=\"42\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/633/1235/#p1248\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4091446\" index=\"42\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/633/1235/#p1248\">\n    at 1245\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . In sum, the Tenth Circuit held that \"defamatory postings may give rise to personal jurisdiction if they are directed specifically at a forum state audience or otherwise make the forum state the focal point of the message.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4091446\" index=\"43\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/633/1235/#p1248\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   at 1244 (citing\n   <em>\n    Johnson v.

The most salient factor distinguishing\n   this case from the cases cited above as finding personal jurisdiction is that Plaintiff is not located in Oklahoma and its business activities are not centered in Oklahoma.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Am. Compl. \u00b6 8 (\"[Plaintiff] is a foreign, international corporation organized and existing under the laws of England with its principal place of business in London, England.\"). Plaintiff as a result must base its assertion of personal jurisdiction on Defendant Soto's single contact with nonparty Draft2Digital. While Draft2Digital's principal address is in Oklahoma, there is nothing to suggest that it uniquely targets an Oklahoma audience or Oklahoma writers or that Defendant Soto was aware of Draft2Digital's presence in Oklahoma.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Shrader\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4091446\" index=\"45\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/633/1235/#p1248\">\n    633 F.3d at 1248\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (\"[I]f the plaintiff does not show that the defendant otherwise knew where the recipient was located, the email itself does not demonstrate purposeful direction of the message to the forum state, even if that happens to be where the recipient lived.\"). Like the online forum in\n   <em>\n    Shrader\n   </em>\n   , Draft2Digital is referenced in Plaintiff's pleading as nonlocal in nature, drawing a customer base beyond merely the state of Oklahoma.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Shrader\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4091446\" index=\"46\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/633/1235/#p1248\">\n    633 F.3d at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   1242 ; Am. Comp. \u00b6\u00b6 7-8, 43, 56. Similarly, Plaintiff does not allege that the author of the\n   <em>\n    Myth of Omega\n   </em>\n   series or the series' content has any tie to Oklahoma. And like the defamatory email in\n   <em>\n    Shrader\n   </em>\n   , the DMCA notice sent to Draft2Digital did not \"make [Oklahoma] the focal point of the message.\"\n   <em>\n    Shrader\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4091446\" index=\"47\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/633/1235/#p1248\">\n    633 F.3d at 1244\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . To the contrary, the DMCA notice contains \"geographically-neutral content,\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4091446\" index=\"48\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/633/1235/#p1248\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4091446\" index=\"48\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/633/1235/#p1248\">\n    at 1245\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , that appears tailored for submission to all distributors of the\n   <em>\n    Myth of Omega\n   </em>\n   series, not just Draft2Digital.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Am. Compl. Ex. 3, at 2-6.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   Accordingly, Plaintiff at minimum has not satisfied the third factor required for the exercise of personal jurisdiction-the defendant's \"knowledge that the brunt of the injury would be felt in the forum state.\"\n   <em>\n    Dudnikov\n   </em>\n   , 514 F.3d at 1072. Here, Plaintiff is \"a foreign, international corporation ... with its principal place of business in London, England,\" not Oklahoma; and Plaintiff's alleged injury is primarily a loss in \"book sales in the United States and internationally.\" Am. Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 8, 56. The fact that the DMCA notice was sent to one online distributor of Plaintiff's that is located in Oklahoma, and even that distributor does not direct its sales to Oklahoma, is not sufficient to locate the \"brunt\" of Plaintiff's alleged injury in Oklahoma, much less to establish that Defendant Soto had knowledge that the brunt of Plaintiff's alleged injury would be felt in Oklahoma.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Dudnikov\n   </em>\n   , 514 F.3d at 1077 (finding that plaintiffs had \"satisfied their burden of establishing ... that defendants knew plaintiffs' business and auction were based in [forum state], and therefore knew the effects of the [copyright infringement notice] would be felt there\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   In light of the foregoing, Plaintiff has not established purposeful direction under the\n   <em>\n    Calder\n   </em>\n   framework based upon Defendant Soto's request, via the DMCA notice, that Oklahoma resident and nonparty Draft2Digital remove the\n   <em>\n    Myth of Omega\n   </em>\n   series from sale.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   <em>\n    B. Tortious Interference with Contract\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   Plaintiff additionally submits that Defendant Soto's alleged tortious interference with Plaintiff's contract with Draft2Digital provides an independent basis for exercising specific personal jurisdiction over Defendant Soto.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Pl.'s Resp. at 26-27; Am. Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 87-91. Plaintiff cites a decision by the United States District Court for the Northern District of Oklahoma for the proposition that \"[a] party that tortiously interferes with the contract of another is subject to personal jurisdiction in the state in which the property rights under that contract exist.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   <em>\n    Nat'l Occupational Health Servs., Inc. v.

Okla. 1998). According to Plaintiff, the contract between Plaintiff and Draft2Digital is \"an Oklahoma contract\" that \"represents a property right,\" and Defendant Soto's alleged tortious interference with the contract therefore subjects her to this Court's jurisdiction. Pl.'s Resp. at 26.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   The cited decision, however, makes clear that personal jurisdiction must be exercised only within the parameters of due process and that jurisdiction is not proper when the defendant did not purposefully direct its activities toward the forum state.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Nat'l Occupational Health Servs., Inc.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11664465\" index=\"50\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-2d/50/1111/#p1117\">\n    50 F.Supp.2d at 1117\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . The Court has already determined that Defendant Soto's sole alleged contact with Oklahoma, the sending of a DMCA notice to Draft2Digital, does not constitute purposeful direction.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Dudnikov\n   </em>\n   , 514 F.3d at 1072 ;\n   <em>\n    supra\n   </em>\n   Part I. While interference with an Oklahoma contract may reasonably result in injury within Oklahoma, nothing in Plaintiff's pleading or affidavit suggests that Defendant Soto was aware that Draft2Digital was based in Oklahoma or that it had an Oklahoma-based contract with Plaintiff. Thus, Plaintiff has not shown that Defendant Soto had \"knowledge that the brunt of the injury\" caused by the alleged interference with contract \"would be felt in [Oklahoma].\"\n   <em>\n    Dudnikov\n   </em>\n   , 514 F.3d at 1072, 1077 (explaining that it is not enough that the brunt of the injury was suffered in the forum state; the plaintiff must also show that the defendant knew the effects would predominantly be felt there);\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Browning v.
