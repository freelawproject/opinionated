The Court has also reviewed and considered carefully hundreds of letters and email messages, including a petition, submitted by members of the public and has listened carefully to the oral remarks made on the record of the Confirmation Hearing by members of the public. For the following reasons, the Plan is hereby confirmed and the objections are overruled.\n   <footnotemark>\n    10\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   INTRODUCTION\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   Nearly two years ago, the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico, through the Oversight Board, initiated unprecedented proceedings to restructure the debts of the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico and certain of its instrumentalities, including COFINA, under Title III of PROMESA. At the outset of these historic proceedings, the Court emphasized that the goal of Title III of PROMESA and the Court's goal in overseeing these cases would be to find a\n   path forward for Puerto Rico, its citizens, and the others who hold stakes in its future, including the financial investors who held obligations or are otherwise dependent on Puerto Rico for their financial wellbeing. The COFINA Plan represents a significant step on the path towards Puerto Rico's financial recovery, economic stability, and prosperity.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   The Court is deeply mindful that the COFINA Plan, which is based on compromises of strongly contested positions, commits substantial portions of Puerto Rico's scarce revenues to bond payments over a period of decades while at the same time affording bondholders less value, on different terms, than they had expected when they invested in COFINA. Citizens who live and work in Puerto Rico and institutions that serve them are concerned that the financial settlement that made the Plan possible will hinder the Commonwealth's ability to provide for its people,\n   <footnotemark>\n    11\n   </footnotemark>\n   even though the Settlement gives the Commonwealth access to a substantial amount of revenues that had previously been allocated to COFINA. However, after considering the applicable legal standards and the evidence, the Court is persuaded that the COFINA Plan is a necessary and legally compliant component of Puerto Rico's recovery efforts and is essential to ensure that Puerto Rico is on a path that will restore its access to financial markets as it builds a stronger economy. It is important for all to bear in mind that the Plan before the Court addresses only COFINA's assets and liabilities. It does not map the way forward for the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico. In formulating a separate plan for the Commonwealth, the Oversight Board and the elected Government will have to address the logical and well-founded concerns of citizens and creditors of the Commonwealth in responsible, meaningful ways.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   The Court has also considered the argument raised by certain public participants at the Confirmation Hearing, as by well as citizens of Puerto Rico who have written numerous letters to the Court, that a comprehensive audit of Puerto Rico's financial circumstances should be conducted prior to confirmation of the COFINA Plan. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    e.g.\n   </em>\n   , Docket Entry No. 4348 in Case No. 17-3283 (Notice of Correspondence dated November 20, 2018), at 17; Jan. 16, 2019 Hr'g Tr. 54:1-3, 83:19-23, 95:23-96:3, 98:8-99:13, Docket Entry No. 4848 in Case No. 17-3283; and Jan. 17, 2019 Hr'g Tr. 71:5-17, 73:11-76:22, Docket Entry No. 4850 in Case No. 17-3283;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   Docket Entry No. 4494 in Case No. 17-3283 (Notice of Correspondence dated December 18, 2018); Docket Entry No. 4576 in Case No. 17-3283 (Notice of Correspondence dated December 27, 2018); Docket Entry No. 4650 in Case No. 17-3283 (Notice of Correspondence dated January 9, 2019); Docket Entry No. 4809 in Case No. 17-3283 (Notice of Correspondence dated January 15, 2019).) The COFINA Plan represents a consensual resolution of complicated and expensive litigation that presented serious issues that had been raised well before the commencement of COFINA's Title III case. This resolution resulted from arm's length negotiations and is necessary to allow the Commonwealth to move forward while reducing certain of its existing obligations to COFINA, and to enable COFINA to fulfill reliably its reduced and restructured obligations. The timing of this Plan is therefore reasonable and appropriate. The Court notes that approval of the Settlement and the Plan does not foreclose further investigation, whether through\n   regulatory, law enforcement, or civil litigation channels, into the origins of Puerto Rico's debt crisis and the application of the proceeds of the pre-PROMESA borrowings. The Court's decision on the motion for confirmation of the COFINA Plan, and the reasons for that decision, are explained in the further Findings of Fact and Conclusions of Law that follow.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   FINDINGS OF FACT AND CONCLUSIONS OF LAW\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   1.\n   <em>\n    Findings and Conclusions\n   </em>\n   .

Pursuant to section 306(b) of PROMESA, upon commencement of the Commonwealth Title III Case and the COFINA Title III Case, the Title III Court exercised, and continues to exercise, exclusive jurisdiction over all property of the Commonwealth and COFINA, wherever located. To the extent necessary, pursuant to PROMESA section 305, the Oversight Board has granted consent to, and the Plan provides for, this Court's exercise of jurisdiction over the property and revenues of the Debtor as necessary to effectuate the Settlement Order and to approve and authorize the implementation of this Memorandum, the Confirmation Order, and the Plan.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   3.\n   <em>\n    Judicial Notice\n   </em>\n   .

For more than a decade, Puerto Rico has been facing an unprecedented fiscal and economic crisis. The positions assumed and actions taken in the past caused Puerto Rico to lose access to the capital markets and precipitated the collapse of Puerto Rico's public finance system. These actions accelerated the contraction of the Puerto Rico economy and increased the outmigration of residents of Puerto Rico. The situation was further exacerbated by the devastation caused to Puerto Rico by Hurricanes Irma and Maria in 2017.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   6. On June 30, 2016, the United States of America enacted PROMESA and the Oversight Board was established under PROMESA section 101(b). (Jaresko Decl. \u00b6 3.) Pursuant to section 4 of PROMESA, the provisions thereof prevail over any general or specific provisions of territory law, State law, or regulation that is inconsistent therewith.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   7. On August 31, 2016, President Obama appointed the Oversight Board's seven voting members. (Jaresko Decl. \u00b6 3.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   8. On September 30, 2016, the Oversight Board designated COFINA as a \"covered entity\" under PROMESA section 101(d).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   9. On May 3, 2017, the Oversight Board issued a restructuring certification, pursuant to sections 104(j) and 206 of PROMESA and, at the request of the Governor of Puerto Rico, filed a voluntary petition for relief for the Commonwealth pursuant to section 304(a) of PROMESA, commencing a case under Title III thereof (the \"\n   <em>\n    Commonwealth Title III Case\n   </em>\n   \"). (Jaresko Decl. \u00b6 17.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   10. On May 5, 2017, the Oversight Board issued a restructuring certification pursuant to sections 104(j) and 206 of PROMESA and, at the Request of the Governor of Puerto Rico, filed a voluntary petition for relief for COFINA pursuant to section 304(a) of PROMESA, commencing a case under Title III thereof. (Jaresko Decl. \u00b6 17; Docket Entry No. 1.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   11. On June 1, 2017, the Court entered an order granting the joint administration of the Commonwealth Title III Case and the COFINA Title III Case, for procedural purposes only. (Docket Entry No. 131.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   12. On June 15, 2017, the United States Trustee for Region 21 (the \"\n   <em>\n    U.S. Trustee\n   </em>\n   \") appointed the statutory creditors' committee in the Commonwealth's Title III Case (the \"\n   <em>\n    Committee\n   </em>\n   \" or \"\n   <em>\n    UCC\n   </em>\n   \"). (Docket Entry No. 338 in Case No. 17-3283.) That same day, on June 15, 2017, the U.S. Trustee filed a\n   <em>\n    Notice of No Appointment of Official Committee of Unsecured Creditors for Puerto Rico Sales Tax Financing Corporation (COFINA)\n   </em>\n   , indicating that there is no creditors' committee in the Title III Case. (Docket Entry No. 339 in Case No. 17-3283.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-50\">\n   <em>\n    The Commonwealth-COFINA Dispute\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-51\">\n   13. Prior to the commencement of the Commonwealth Title III Case, the Oversight Board recognized that resolution of the Commonwealth-COFINA Dispute would be a critical component to the restructuring of Puerto Rico's public debt. (Jaresko Decl. \u00b6 9; Jaresko (9019) Decl. \u00b6 8.) Of the approximately $ 74 billion in aggregate Puerto Rico debt, the GO Debt and COFINA's Existing Securities together account for approximately fifty-five percent (55%) of the total funded indebtedness to be restructured. (Jaresko Decl. \u00b6 9; Jaresko (9019) Decl. \u00b6 8.) The determination of which funds are available to service COFINA's debt and the Commonwealth's debt is dependent upon which entity, the Commonwealth or COFINA, owns the portion of the Commonwealth's general sales and use tax (the \"\n   <em>\n    SUT\n   </em>\n   \") that was purportedly transferred to COFINA pursuant to the Act of May 13, 2006, No. 91-2006,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2006%20P.R.%20Laws%20246\">\n    2006 P.R.

Laws Ann. tit. 13, \u00a7 12\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ) (as amended, \"\n   <em>\n    Act 91\n   </em>\n   \"). (Jaresko Decl. \u00b6 9; Jaresko (9019) Decl. \u00b6 8.) The Sales Tax Revenue Bond Resolution, adopted on July 13, 2007, as amended and restated on June 10, 2009 (as amended and supplemented, the \"\n   <em>\n    Resolution\n   </em>\n   \"), states that a portion of the SUT (the \"\n   <em>\n    Pledged Sales Tax Base Amount\n   </em>\n   \") was pledged by COFINA to secure the repayment of COFINA's Existing Securities. (Jaresko Decl. \u00b6 9; Jaresko (9019) Decl. \u00b6 8; Exhibit DX-K.) The amount at issue in the Commonwealth-COFINA Dispute is significant-approximately $ 783 million in the current fiscal year alone, which amount grows at four percent (4%) annually until it reaches $ 1.85 billion in fiscal year 2041 and remains fixed at that amount until COFINA's Existing Securities are repaid in full in accordance with their terms. Under the COFINA Fiscal Plan, this would result in billions of dollars over the next forty (40) years. (Jaresko Decl. \u00b6 9; Jaresko (9019) Decl. \u00b6 8; Exhibit DX-SSS.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-52\">\n   14. If the Pledged Sales Taxes were property of COFINA, the Commonwealth would have $ 783 million less in fiscal year 2019 (which annual amount would increase over time) to pay its liabilities and expenses, including addressing the essential services of the Commonwealth and the\n   needs of its citizens. (Jaresko Decl. \u00b6 9; Jaresko (9019) Decl. \u00b6 8.) Conversely, if the Pledged Sales Taxes were property of the Commonwealth, there would not be any funds available to address and satisfy COFINA's outstanding indebtedness. Unless and until a resolution were reached on the Commonwealth-COFINA Dispute, the Oversight Board would not be able to begin to formulate a Title III plan of adjustment for the Commonwealth, COFINA, or any of their other debtor-affiliates. (Jaresko Decl. \u00b6 9; Jaresko (9019) Decl. \u00b6 8.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-53\">\n   15. Prior to the commencement of the Commonwealth Title III Case, on July 20, 2016, certain holders of GO Bonds filed a complaint in the United States District Court for the District of Puerto Rico against the Governor, Secretary of Treasury, and Office of Management and Budget Director seeking (a) declaratory relief that the Puerto Rico Emergency Moratorium and Financial Rehabilitation Act, Act 21-2016 (\"\n   <em>\n    Act 21\n   </em>\n   \"), which authorized the Governor to, among other things, declare a temporary moratorium on debt service payments and stay creditor remedies, and an executive order issued pursuant to Act 21 announcing a moratorium on the Commonwealth's general obligations bonds, are preempted by PROMESA section 204(c)(3), and (b) an injunction to prevent certain measures taken by the government permitting transfers outside of the ordinary course.\n   <em>\n    Lex Claims, LLC v. Garcia-Padilla\n   </em>\n   ; District Court, District of Puerto Rico, July 20, 2016, Case No. 16-2374-FAB (the \"\n   <em>\n    Lex Claims Litigation\n   </em>\n   \"); (Exhibit DX-M; Jaresko Decl. \u00b6 11; Jaresko (9019) Decl. \u00b6 10). On November 4, 2016, the plaintiffs in that case filed a second amended complaint, as further described below, adding new causes of action, including three causes of action relating to COFINA, and adding COFINA and other parties as defendants. On December 16, 2016, COFINA filed an answer to the second amended complaint generally denying the allegations and asserting various affirmative defenses. Certain COFINA bondholders who intervened in the Lex Claims Litigation also filed answers generally denying the allegations and asserting various defenses and counter- and cross-claims. (Jaresko Decl. \u00b6 10; Jaresko (9019) Decl. \u00b6 10; Exhibits DX-M, DX-N, and DX-O.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-54\">\n   16. Plaintiffs in the Lex Claims Litigation, in their second amended complaint, argue, among other things, that the Puerto Rico Constitution requires the Commonwealth to pay the GO Debt ahead of any other expenditure. They claim that, pursuant to Article VI, Section 8 of the Puerto Rico Constitution, if Puerto Rico's \"available resources\" are insufficient to meet all its appropriations, \"interest on the public debt and amortization thereof shall first be paid, and other disbursements shall thereafter be made in accordance with the order of priorities established by law.\" They further allege the Pledged Sales Taxes are an \"available resource\" and that COFINA was created and has issued bonds in an attempt to evade the claim of holders of GO Debt on \"available resources\" and related constitutional limitations on the amount of public debt the Commonwealth was permitted to issue. Plaintiffs request two declaratory judgments that challenge the legal validity of COFINA: (1) a declaration that the Pledged Sales Taxes constitute \"available resources\" and that such funds cannot be deposited with COFINA or its bondholders; and (2) a declaration that the Commonwealth is obligated to afford the GO Debt absolute priority, including priority over required deposits with COFINA and its bondholders. (Jaresko Decl. \u00b6 11; Exhibits DX-M and DX-O.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-55\">\n   17. Certain holders and insurers of COFINA's Existing Securities, permitted to intervene in the Lex Claims Litigation, asserted that the Pledged Sales Taxes were legislatively rendered property of\n   COFINA from their inception, thereby eliminating any possibility the taxes may be property or \"available resources\" of the Commonwealth. Such holders and insurers rely upon Act 91, which provides that the Pledged Sales Taxes \"shall [not] constitute available resources of the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico nor be available for the use of the Secretary.\" Act 91 \u00a7 2. They further assert that the question whether COFINA's property constitutes \"available resources\" should be certified to the Supreme Court of Puerto Rico because, in their view, its resolution would involve a pure and undecided issue of Puerto Rico constitutional law that would have long-lasting consequences for the Commonwealth. They assert that COFINA is essential in permitting Puerto Rico to access the capital markets on favorable terms, and that the plaintiffs in the Lex Claims Litigation had been able to obtain higher interest rates on the Commonwealth's general obligation bonds precisely because COFINA's property was not available to repay them. (Jaresko Decl. \u00b6 12; Exhibit DX-P.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-56\">\n   18. On April 12 and May 2, 2017, in response to uncertainty surrounding the transfer of the SUT, and contending that an event of default had already occurred under the Existing Bond Resolution, Whitebox and Ambac, respectively, commenced separate litigations against BNYM, the trustee under the Existing Bond Resolution, alleging various causes of action, each premised upon allegations that an event of default occurred prior to April 29, 2017, and that BNYM breached its alleged duties by failing to declare such defaults and resign as trustee of the \"Senior\" or the \"First Subordinate\" (sometimes referred to herein as \"junior\") Existing Securities. If such creditors were correct, then, in their view, the subordination provisions attendant to the Existing Securities would apply and no payments to holders of \"First Subordinate\" Existing Securities would have been permissible until holders of \"Senior\" Existing Securities had been paid in full. (Jaresko Decl. \u00b6 13; Exhibits DX-Q and DX-R.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-57\">\n   19. BNYM responded that the Ambac Action and Whitebox Actions, including any claims and causes of action for gross negligence, willful misconduct, or intentional fraud, lacked merit and should be dismissed with prejudice. BNYM claimed, and Whitebox and Ambac disagreed, that such actions should fail for a variety of reasons, including, without limitation: (i) there were no defaults or events of default under the Existing Bond Resolution prior to April 29, 2017; (ii) BNYM had no obligation to perform any act that would involve it in expense or liability, or to exercise any of the rights or powers vested in it by the Existing Bond Resolution at the request or direction of bond owners, unless the bond owners offered BNYM security or indemnity satisfactory to BNYM against the costs, expenses, and liabilities that might be incurred; and (iii) a failure to comply with the no-action clause contained in Section 1106.1 of the Existing Bond Resolution. (Jaresko Decl. \u00b6 14.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-58\">\n   20. Promptly after certification of the Commonwealth's initial Fiscal Plan on March 13, 2017, the Oversight Board and AAFAF undertook a joint effort to formulate restructuring proposals for all major creditors based on the debt sustainability analysis in such Fiscal Plan. The Oversight Board and AAFAF requested that holders of GO Debt and COFINA's Existing Securities participate in mediation with the Oversight Board and AAFAF. The mediation began on April 13, 2017, under the auspices of retired Bankruptcy Judge Allan L. Gropper. Despite several mediation sessions and other private negotiations, no agreement was reached before the expiration of the pre-Title III stay provided in\n   PROMESA section 405 on May 1, 2017. (Jaresko Decl. \u00b6 15.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-59\">\n   21. After competing bondholder groups commenced litigation against the Commonwealth and COFINA, the Oversight Board determined, in consultation with AAFAF, and at the request of the Governor, and after consideration of creditor support for a Title III filing, that the best path forward for the Commonwealth and COFINA to resolve the Commonwealth-COFINA Dispute was to file the Commonwealth Title III Case and the Title III Case to afford the Commonwealth and COFINA additional time and breathing room to seek to resolve the impasse under the supervision of the Title III Court. (Jaresko Decl. \u00b6 16.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-60\">\n   22. Following the filing of the Title III Case, BNYM, as trustee for the Existing Securities, was in possession of hundreds of millions of dollars for the benefit of holders of both junior and senior Existing Securities, but without clarity about how and to whom the money should be distributed. On May 16, 2017, BNYM filed the Interpleader Action, seeking a determination of competing claims to the Disputed Funds by certain holders of beneficial interests in the Existing Securities (including Whitebox), insurers of the Existing Securities (including Ambac), and COFINA. On May 30, 2017, the Title III Court granted the interpleader request and ordered that the Disputed Funds remain in trust and no distributions made until the Title III Court issues a final ruling in the Interpleader Action. (Jaresko Decl. \u00b6 18; Exhibits DX-S, DX-T, and DX-U.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-61\">\n   23. Significant holders of \"Senior\" and \"First Subordinate\" Existing Securities intervened in the Interpleader Action. From June to September 2017, several parties, including BNYM and certain creditors, served document requests and deposition subpoenas on various Puerto Rico Government entities, affiliates, and officials, including COFINA, the Government Development Bank for Puerto Rico, Rothschild (in its capacity as financial advisor to the Commonwealth), the Commonwealth, AAFAF, and the Oversight Board. The subpoenaed entities and individuals produced documents. In addition, depositions were taken of Banco Popular of Puerto Rico, a private financial services institution, in its capacity as the banking services institution of the Commonwealth, the Government Development Bank, and COFINA. AAFAF, COFINA, the Commonwealth, and the Oversight Board each stipulated to binding statements of facts in lieu of depositions. (Jaresko Decl. \u00b6 19; Exhibits DX-U and DX-ZZZ.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-62\">\n   24. Based upon the parties' agreement, the Court stayed consideration of the Interpleader Action and did not render a determination as to whether an event of default under the Existing Bond Resolution had occurred. (Docket Entry No. 518 in Adv. Proc. No. 17-133.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-63\">\n   25. If an event of default under the Existing Bond Resolution had occurred, the senior bondholders may have had repayment of their bonds accelerated, to the detriment of the junior bondholders. Such acceleration might, in the senior bondholders' view, require the senior bondholders to be paid in full prior to junior bondholders being able to declare an event of default and exercise remedies. The Interpleader Action is in essence a dispute between junior and senior COFINA creditors about their payment rights and priorities\n   <em>\n    vis-\u00e0-vis\n   </em>\n   each other. The issues regarding such payment rights and priorities are being settled pursuant to the Plan.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-64\">\n   26. Pursuant to PROMESA section 315(b), the Oversight Board is representative of the Commonwealth and COFINA in their respective Title III cases. The Oversight Board analyzed various options for\n   resolving the dispute and determined that the best path forward was to institute procedures for an orderly process to resolve the Commonwealth-COFINA Dispute, which process involved the appointment of independent Oversight Board agents to serve separately as the respective representatives of the Commonwealth and COFINA in the Commonwealth-COFINA Dispute. (Jaresko Decl. \u00b6 21.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-65\">\n   27. On June 10, 2017, the Oversight Board filed the\n   <em>\n    Motion of Debtors for Order Approving Procedure to Resolve Commonwealth-COFINA Dispute\n   </em>\n   . (Docket Entry No. 303 in Case No. 17-3283, the \"\n   <em>\n    Commonwealth-COFINA Dispute Procedures Motion\n   </em>\n   \"; Jaresko Decl. \u00b6 21; Jaresko (9019) Decl. \u00b6 15; Exhibit DX-V.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-66\">\n   28. On June 28, 2017, the Court denied the Commonwealth-COFINA Dispute Procedures Motion, without prejudice, but (a) requested that the Oversight Board seek agreement of all interested parties to a procedure for resolving the Commonwealth-COFINA Dispute through confidential mediation with Chief Bankruptcy Judge Barbara Houser of the Northern District of Texas, and (b) authorized the Oversight Board to file a revised motion with or without unanimous support of interested parties. (Jaresko Decl. \u00b6 21; Jaresko (9019) Decl. \u00b6 15; Exhibit DX-W.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-67\">\n   29. Consistent with the Court's request, the Oversight Board worked with Chief Bankruptcy Judge Houser and any creditor party who sought to participate to formulate procedures agreeable to the interested parties. On July 21, 2017, the Oversight Board filed a revised motion seeking approval of a stipulation establishing a protocol to address the Commonwealth-COFINA Dispute, including the appointment of respective agents with independence from the Oversight Board as debtor representatives for the Commonwealth and COFINA to litigate, mediate, and/or settle the Commonwealth-COFINA Dispute, and providing a procedure and timeline for the Agents to consult with creditors of their respective debtor in carrying out their charge, but at all times owing duties only to their respective debtor and to act solely in such debtor's best interest. (Jaresko Decl. \u00b6 22; Jaresko (9019) Decl. \u00b6 16; Exhibit DX-X.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-68\">\n   30. On August 10, 2017, the Court entered the\n   <em>\n    Stipulation and Order Approving Procedure to Resolve Commonwealth-COFINA Dispute\n   </em>\n   (Docket Entry No. 996 in Case No. 17-3283, the \"\n   <em>\n    Procedures Order\n   </em>\n   \"), which provides, among other things, that (a) the Oversight Board, as representative of the Commonwealth in its Title III case, authorized the Committee to serve as the Commonwealth representative to litigate and/or settle the Commonwealth-COFINA Dispute on behalf of the Commonwealth; and (b) the Oversight Board, as representative of COFINA in its Title III case, authorized Bettina Whyte to serve as the COFINA representative to litigate and/or settle the Commonwealth-COFINA Dispute on behalf of COFINA. (Jaresko Decl. \u00b6 23; Jaresko (9019) Decl. \u00b6 17; Exhibit DX-B.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-69\">\n   31. The Procedures Order directed that \"[e]ach Agent shall have a duty of good faith, care, and loyalty to the Debtor the Agent represents. In furtherance of such duties, each Agent shall, with the advice and assistance of counsel, endeavor to the best of the Agent's ability under the circumstances to litigate and negotiate from the perspective of what result is best for the Debtor the Agent represents, as opposed to what result is best for any particular type of creditor of the Debtor the Agent represents.\"\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Procedures Order \u00b6 4(f).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-70\">\n   32. On September 8, 2017, the Commonwealth Agent commenced the Adversary Proceeding against the COFINA Agent seeking a resolution of the Commonwealth-COFINA\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-71\">\n   Dispute and related issues. Concurrently with the litigation of the Adversary Proceeding, the Agents and various parties to the Commonwealth-COFINA Dispute engaged in mediation led by Mediation Team leader Chief Bankruptcy Judge Barbara J. Houser to resolve the dispute. At the time, such efforts were unsuccessful. (Jaresko Decl. \u00b6 24; Exhibit DX-Y.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-72\">\n   33. During the intervening months, (a) the COFINA Agent answered the complaint and asserted counterclaims, (b) multiple parties intervened in the Adversary Proceeding, (c) discovery was undertaken, and (d) the Agents and certain intervenors filed cross motions for summary judgment. Additionally, during this period, the Court clarified the scope of the Agents' authority to litigate and/or settle the issues raised in the Adversary Proceeding. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Docket Entry Nos. 167, 257, and 284 in Adv. Proc. No. 17-257.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-73\">\n   34. Following oral argument regarding the respective motions for summary judgment filed in the Adversary Proceeding, the Mediation Team and the Agents rekindled their efforts to mediate a resolution. The Oversight Board was not a party to such mediation efforts, other than to be informed of their existence. Likewise, the Oversight Board was unaware of the parties which may have participated in such mediation. (Jaresko Decl. \u00b6 25; Jaresko (9019) Decl. \u00b6 21.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-74\">\n   35. On June 7, 2018, the Agents announced the terms of an Agreement in Principle to resolve the Commonwealth-COFINA Dispute. The Agreement in Principle was the product of arm's-length negotiations between the Agents free from any influence or direct participation by the Oversight Board. (Feldman Decl. \u00b6 4; Jaresko (9019) Decl. \u00b6 21.) At the time the Agreement in Principle was reached, both the COFINA Agent and the Commonwealth Agent agreed that it was the best possible outcome for each of their respective estates given the enormous stakes and uncertainty involved in litigating the Commonwealth-COFINA Dispute to conclusion. (Feldman Decl. \u00b6 4.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-75\">\n   36. The Oversight Board asserted that certain aspects of the Agreement in Principle concerned matters beyond the scope of the Commonwealth-COFINA Dispute, as framed by the Procedures Order and the Scope Orders, including the design of new securities to be issued under a plan of adjustment for COFINA and a constraint on the Oversight Board's use of funds allocated to the Commonwealth. Moreover, the Oversight Board asserted that, among other things, the Agreement in Principle exceeded the scope of the Adversary Proceeding and the Procedures Order by attempting to, among other things, dictate the terms of plans of adjustment in the Title III Cases and limit the availability and use of funds. However, the Oversight Board determined, after reviewing the extensive litigation history and issues raised in the Adversary Proceeding and assessing the likelihood of success for the Commonwealth in the litigation, that the central component of the Agreement in Principle-the 53.65% / 46.35% allocation of the disputed sales and use tax revenue between COFINA and the Commonwealth, respectively-was a fair and reasonable settlement and compromise of the Commonwealth-COFINA Dispute given the substantial risks of litigation, and determined to build upon the central component of the Agreement in Principle to garner support for a confirmable COFINA plan of adjustment. (Jaresko Decl. \u00b6 25; Jaresko (9019) Decl. \u00b6 21.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-76\">\n   37. Beginning in July 2018 and using the economic framework of the Agreement in Principle, the Oversight Board and its advisors engaged in over two weeks of court-sanctioned mediation among interested\n   parties convened by the Mediation Team on a COFINA plan of adjustment, including the relative rights between senior and junior COFINA bondholders that remain the subject of the Interpleader Action. (Jaresko Decl. \u00b6 26; Jaresko (9019) Decl. \u00b6 22.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-77\">\n   38. On August 8, 2018, the Oversight Board announced that it had reached an agreement with certain holders and insurers of COFINA's Existing Securities and AAFAF on the economic treatment of COFINA's Existing Securities and the terms of new securities to be issued pursuant to a proposed COFINA plan of adjustment (the \"\n   <em>\n    Securities Terms\n   </em>\n   \"), which Securities Terms were developed by Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (\"\n   <em>\n    Citi\n   </em>\n   \") at the request of the Oversight Board and included in a presentation, of which the Agreement in Principle was the foundation. (Jaresko Decl. \u00b6 26; Jaresko (9019) Decl. \u00b6 22; Exhibit DX-UU; Brownstein Decl. \u00b6 12; Exhibit DX-YY.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-78\">\n   39.

(collectively, the \"\n   <em>\n    Settlement Parties\n   </em>\n   \") entered into that certain Plan Support Agreement, dated as of August 29, 2018 (the \"\n   <em>\n    Original Plan Support Agreement\n   </em>\n   \"), that sets forth, among other things, (a) terms to the compromise and settlement of the Commonwealth-COFINA Dispute implemented by the Oversight Board and Citi and consistent with the terms of the Agreement in Principle developed by the Agents, which, among other things, allocates the first collections of SUT revenues in an amount up to fifty-three and sixty five one-hundredths percent (53.65%) of the annual Pledged Sales Tax Base Amount to COFINA, and confirms that COFINA is the sole and exclusive owner of the amounts held at BNYM as of June 30, 2018, and (b) terms of the relative treatment between junior and senior Existing Securities to resolve the dispute between holders of junior and senior Existing Securities regarding whether or not a default and acceleration had been triggered under the Resolution. (Jaresko Decl. \u00b6 27.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-79\">\n   40. On September 20, 2018, the Settlement Parties amended and restated the Original Plan Support Agreement (the \"\n   <em>\n    A&amp;R Plan Support Agreement\n   </em>\n   \") to (a) include additional holders of Existing Securities, who also hold significant amounts of GO Bonds and were among the plaintiffs in the Lex Claims Litigation and (b) provide that Aurelius Capital Master, Ltd. and Six PRC Investments LLC, and each of their applicable affiliates, who are significant holders of Existing Securities, will request dismissal, with prejudice, of their claims and causes of action in the Lex Claims Litigation premised on challenges to COFINA's constitutionality, COFINA's entitlement to proceeds of the SUT revenues purportedly transferred by the Commonwealth to COFINA, and any other claims and causes of action which may challenge the transactions contemplated in the A&amp;R Plan Support Agreement or the Plan, effective upon the entry of an order approving the Settlement and confirmation of the Plan. (Jaresko Decl. \u00b6 28; Exhibit DX-D (\n   <em>\n    A&amp;R Plan Support Agreement\n   </em>\n   ), \u00a7 4.13.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-80\">\n   41. As of the date of the August 8, 2018, announcement, and due to the changes in the Commonwealth's then-certified fiscal plan, the Commonwealth Agent was unwilling to proceed to finalize any further documentation regarding the Agreement in Principle. (Feldman Decl. \u00b6 5.) As such, the Oversight Board, as representative of the Commonwealth, began negotiation of the terms of the Settlement Agreement with the COFINA Agent, consistent with the economic terms of the Agreement in Principle. (Feldman Decl.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-81\">\n   \u00b6 6.) The Settlement Agreement was the result of a good faith, arm's-length negotiation between the COFINA Agent and the Oversight Board. (Feldman Decl. \u00b6 7.) The Oversight Board did not exert any influence on the COFINA Agent's decision to enter into the Settlement Agreement, nor did the COFINA Agent permit the Oversight Board to affect her judgment or ability to carry out her duty to act in the best interest of the debtor she was appointed to represent. (Feldman Decl. \u00b6 7.) The Settlement Agreement is faithful to and consistent with the Agreement in Principle. (Feldman Decl. \u00b6 8.) On October 19, 2018, after extensive discussion and deliberations, the Oversight Board, as representative of the Commonwealth, approved entry into the Settlement Agreement with the COFINA Agent. (Jaresko Decl. \u00b6 29.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-82\">\n   42. Contemporaneously thereto, on October 19, 2018, the Debtor filed the Plan, Disclosure Statement, and\n   <em>\n    Puerto Rico Sales Tax Financing Corporation's Motion for Order (I) Approving Disclosure Statement, (II) Fixing Voting Record Date, (III) Approving Confirmation Hearing Notice, (IV) Approving Solicitation Packages and Distribution Procedures, (V) Approving Forms of Ballots and Election Notices, and Voting and Election Procedures, (VI) Approving Notice of Non-Voting Status, (VII) Fixing Voting and Election Deadlines, and (VIII) Approving Vote Tabulation Procedures\n   </em>\n   (Docket Entry No. 307).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-83\">\n   43. On November 5, 2018, the Commonwealth Agent entered into a stipulation with the Oversight Board and the COFINA Agent withdrawing any objections to the Settlement Agreement. Pursuant to such stipulation, the Commonwealth Agent agreed, among other things, not to object to the approval of the Settlement Agreement, approval of the Disclosure Statement, or confirmation of the Plan, except in the circumstances set forth in paragraph 4 therein. (Docket Entry No. 4204 in Case No. 17-3283.) On January 10, 2019, the Retiree Committee withdrew its objection to the Settlement Agreement. (Docket Entry No. 4704 in Case No. 17-3283.) In light of the foregoing, as of the date hereof, (a) each of the COFINA Agent, the GO Representative, and the Retiree Committee have agreed to or ratified the terms of the Settlement Agreement resolving the Commonwealth-COFINA Dispute in a manner consistent with the requirements of the Procedures Order, and (b) the Commonwealth Agent also does not object to the approval of the Settlement Agreement. The Oversight Board's execution of the Settlement Agreement with the COFINA Agent was appropriate under the circumstances.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-84\">\n   44. On November 15, 2018, in furtherance of the Settlement and the Plan, the Government enacted Act 241-2018 (\"\n   <em>\n    Act 241\n   </em>\n   \"), amending Act 91, which originally created COFINA.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-85\">\n   45. On November 29, 2018, the Court entered an order (Exhibit DX-J, Docket Entry No. 375, the \"\n   <em>\n    Disclosure Statement Order\n   </em>\n   \") (a) approving the Disclosure Statement as containing adequate information within the meaning of section 1125 of the Bankruptcy Code, (b) establishing (1) January 2, 2019, at 5:00 p.m. (Atlantic Standard Time), as the Confirmation Objection Deadline, (2) January 8, 2019, at 6:00 p.m. (Atlantic Standard Time), as the deadline by which (i) ballots to accept or reject the Plan were required to be received by Prime Clerk (the \"\n   <em>\n    Voting Deadline\n   </em>\n   \"), and (ii) elections regarding the form of distribution (including a determination regarding commutation with respect to certain insured claims) were required to be received by Prime Clerk (the \"\n   <em>\n    Election Deadline\n   </em>\n   \"), which Election Deadline was subsequently extended to January 11, 2019, at 6:00 p.m. (Atlantic Standard Time)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-86\">\n   (Docket Entry No. 400), and (c) scheduling a hearing on January 16, 2019, at 9:30 a.m. (Atlantic Standard Time), to consider confirmation of the Plan (Docket Entry No. 302).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-87\">\n   46. Consistent with the Disclosure Statement Order, the Debtor caused Prime Clerk to distribute solicitation packages to all claim holders entitled to vote. The solicitation packages contained, among other things: (i) the notice setting forth the time, date, and place of the Confirmation Hearing (the \"\n   <em>\n    Confirmation Hearing Notice\n   </em>\n   \"); (ii) a flash drive (or hard copy, in the Debtor's discretion) containing this Disclosure Statement Order (without the exhibits thereto) and Disclosure Statement (together with all exhibits thereto, including the Plan); (iii) the appropriate form of Ballot, if any, with instructions for completing the Ballot, and a pre-addressed, pre-paid return envelope; (iv) solely with respect to holders of Claims in Classes 8 and 9, a W-9 form or W-8 BEN form, as appropriate, for purposes of collecting certain tax related information relating to distributions under the Plan; and (v) in the case of creditors in Class 6, the Class 6 Notice. Prime Clerk also served election notices to holders of Claims in Classes 1 and 5, to permit the election into Classes 4 and 7, respectively, or, if in Class 2 or 3, to elect to receive the applicable trust certificates rather than the commutation alternative being offered by the respective monoline insurers. (Pullo Decl. \u00b6 4.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-88\">\n   COMPLIANCE WITH PROMESA SECTIONS 104(J) AND 313\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-89\">\n   47.

The Oversight Board has complied with its obligations pursuant to PROMESA sections 104(j) and 313. On October 18, 2018, the Oversight Board certified COFINA's current fiscal plan (the \"\n   <em>\n    COFINA Fiscal Plan\n   </em>\n   \"). (Exhibit DX-FFFF.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-91\">\n   49. On October 19, 2018, the Oversight Board certified the submission of the\n   <em>\n    Title III Plan of Adjustment of Puerto Rico Sales Tax Corporation\n   </em>\n   (Docket Entry No. 4072 in Case No. 17-3283, the \"\n   <em>\n    Original Plan\n   </em>\n   \") upon a determination, in the Oversight Board's sole discretion, that the Original Plan was consistent with the COFINA Fiscal Plan.

On November 16, 2018, the Oversight Board certified the modification of the Original Plan and the submission of the\n   <em>\n    Amended Title III Plan of Adjustment of Puerto Rico Sales Tax Corporation\n   </em>\n   (Docket Entry No. 4296 in Case No. 17-3283, the \"\n   <em>\n    First Amended Plan\n   </em>\n   \") upon a determination, in the Oversight Board's sole discretion, that the First Amended Plan was consistent with the COFINA Fiscal Plan.

Accordingly, the Oversight Board certified the modification of the Original Plan and the submission of the First Amended Plan in accordance with PROMESA section 104(j).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-93\">\n   51. On November 26, 2018, the Oversight Board certified the modification of the First Amended Plan and the submission of the\n   <em>\n    Second Amended Title III Plan of Adjustment of Puerto Rico Sales Tax Corporation\n   </em>\n   (Docket Entry No. 4363 in Case No. 17-3283, as subsequently corrected pursuant to Docket Entry No. 4390, the \"\n   <em>\n    Second Amended Plan\n   </em>\n   \") upon a determination, in the Oversight Board's sole discretion, that the Second Amended Plan was consistent with the COFINA Fiscal Plan. (Exhibit DX-DDDD.) Accordingly, the Oversight Board certified the modification of the First Amended Plan and the submission of the Second Amended Plan in accordance with PROMESA section 104(j).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-94\">\n   52. On January 9, 2019, the Oversight Board certified the modification of the Second Amended Plan and the submission of the\n   <em>\n    Third Amended Title III Plan of Adjustment of Puerto Rico Sales Tax Corporation\n   </em>\n   (Docket Entry No. 4652 in Case No. 17-3283, the \"\n   <em>\n    Third Amended Plan\n   </em>\n   \") upon a determination, in the Oversight Board's sole discretion, that the Third Amended Plan is consistent with the COFINA Fiscal Plan.

Accordingly, the Oversight Board certified the modification of the Second Amended Plan and the submission of the Third Amended Plan in accordance with PROMESA section 104(j).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-95\">\n   53. For the reasons explained herein, the Third Amended Plan meets the requirements of PROMESA; the First Amended Plan and Second Amended Plan met the requirements of PROMESA to the same extent that the Third Amended Plan meets the requirements of PROMESA; and the Oversight Board has complied with all applicable provisions of PROMESA. Accordingly, the Oversight Board modified the Original Plan, First Amended Plan, and Second Amended Plan in accordance with PROMESA section 313, and the Third Amended Plan has become the \"Plan.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-96\">\n   COMPLIANCE WITH PROMESA SECTION 314(B)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-97\">\n   <strong>\n    A.

As required by Bankruptcy Rule 3016(a), the Plan is dated and identifies the Debtor as the proponent. Plan at 1, 78. In addition, as detailed below, the Plan satisfies the requirements of sections 1122, 1123(a)(1), 1123(a)(2), 1123(a)(3), 1123(a)(4), 1123(a)(5), 1123(b), and 1123(d) of the Bankruptcy Code :\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-99\">\n   <strong>\n    i. Bankruptcy Code Section 1122(a)\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-100\">\n   55. With the exception of Administrative Expense Claims and Professional Claims, which need not be classified, Article IV of the Plan designates the classification of Claims. Such classification complies with section 1122(a) of the Bankruptcy Code because each Class contains only claims that are substantially similar to each other. The Plan designates the following ten (10) Classes of Claims:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-101\">\n   Class 1 (Senior COFINA Bond Claims)\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-102\">\n   Class 2 (Senior COFINA Bond Claims (Ambac) )\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-103\">\n   Class 3 (Senior COFINA Bond Claims (National) )\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-104\">\n   Class 4 (Senior COFINA Bond Claims (Taxable Election) )\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-105\">\n   Class 5 (Junior COFINA Bond Claims)\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-106\">\n   Class 6 (Junior COFINA Bond Claims (Assured) )\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-107\">\n   Class 7 (Junior COFINA Bond Claims (Taxable Election) )\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-108\">\n   Class 8 (GS Derivative Claim)\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-109\">\n   Class 9 (General Unsecured Claims)\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-110\">\n   Class 10 (Section 510(b) Subordinated Claims)\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-111\">\n   (Exhibit DX-G.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-112\">\n   56. The classification of Claims set forth in the Plan is reasonable and was not done to control the outcome of voting to accept or reject the Plan, as the classification is based upon differences in the legal nature and/or priority of such Claims in accordance with applicable law. (Jaresko Decl. \u00b6 36.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-113\">\n   57. All holders of Claims in Classes 1, 2, and 3 hold substantially similar securities, \"Senior\" Existing Securities, but are classified separately based on whether they are uninsured (Class 1) or insured by Ambac (Class 2) or National (Class 3), as such insurance agreements provide bondholders different rights thereunder. Holders of Claims in Classes 5 and 6 hold substantially similar securities, \"First Subordinate\" Existing Securities, but are classified separately based on whether they are uninsured (Class 5) or insured by Assured (Class 6). (Jaresko Decl. \u00b6 36.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-114\">\n   58. Senior COFINA Bond Claims and Junior COFINA Bond Claims are in different Classes because they have different underlying rights. Specifically, in determining whether claims are \"substantially similar\" for the purpose of section 1122 of Title 11 of the United States Code, made applicable to the Title III Case pursuant to PROMESA section 301(a), the Oversight Board shall consider whether such claims are secured and whether such claims have priority over other claims.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   PROMESA \u00a7 301(e). Under the Resolution, in the event of default, payment to the Junior COFINA Bond Claims, such as those bonds issued under the Seventh Supplemental Sales Tax Revenue Bond Resolution, is subordinate in payment of the Senior COFINA Bond Claims. (Jaresko Decl. \u00b6 37; Exhibit DX-XX.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-115\">\n   59. Based upon the elections offered pursuant to the Plan, holders of Senior COFINA Bond Claims and Junior COFINA Bond Claims which are either Puerto Rico Institutions or Puerto Rico Individuals, to the extent elections were made, were shifted appropriately to other Classes (Class 4 and Class 7, respectively) to denote the election made and the alternative form of distribution elected to be received. (Jaresko Decl. \u00b6 38; Exhibit DX-G.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-116\">\n   60. Numerous formal and informal objections contest the existence of the Taxable Election Class and the different treatment of holders of claims who elect to have their claims placed into Class 7, or the \"Junior Taxable Election Class.\" In particular, the objections note that the bonds issued to the Junior Taxable Election Class have different payment schedules and maturities, and holders of claims who elect to place their claims in the Junior Taxable Election Class will receive shares of Taxable Election Cash (equal to up to two percent of the aggregate amount of Senior and Junior COFINA Bond Claims). The total amount of such cash will not exceed $ 60 million. The Junior Taxable Election Class is properly treated as a separate class of claims from the other classes of claims for holders of junior bonds and it therefore does not implicate Section 1122(a), which concerns whether claims may be classified together.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-117\">\n   61. The Claim in Class 8 arises from or relates to that certain ISDA Master Agreement, dated as of July 31, 2007, between Goldman Sachs Bank USA (as successor to Goldman Sachs Capital Markets, L.P.) and COFINA, as amended by that certain Amendment, dated September 24, 2014. The treatment of the Claim in Class 8 is dependent on the termination value of such Claim and whether the rejection damages, if any, associated with such Claim constitute a Parity Obligation. (Exhibit DX-G.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-118\">\n   62. The Claims in Class 9 are for all other liabilities of COFINA other than an Administrative Expense Claim, a Professional Claim, a Senior COFINA Bond Claim, a Senior COFINA Bond Claim (Ambac), a Senior COFINA Bond Claim (National), a Senior COFINA Bond Claim (Taxable Election), a Junior COFINA Bond Claim, a Junior COFINA Bond Claim (Assured), a Junior COFINA Bond Claim (Taxable Election), a GS Derivative Claim, or a Section 510(b) Subordinated Claim. (Exhibit DX-G.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-119\">\n   <strong>\n    ii. Bankruptcy Code Section 1123(a)(1)\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-120\">\n   63. Section 4.1 of the Plan designates ten (10) separate Classes of Claims for the Debtor, other than Claims of the type described in section 507(a)(2) of the Bankruptcy Code. (Exhibit DX-G.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-121\">\n   64. The Plan satisfies the requirements of section 1123(a)(1) of the Bankruptcy Code.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-122\">\n   <strong>\n    iii. Bankruptcy Code Section 1123(a)(2)\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-123\">\n   65. Section 23.1 of the Plan specifies that Claims in Classes 1 through 10 are impaired. (Exhibit DX-G.) Existing holders of Allowed Junior COFINA Bond Claims (Assured) will receive (through payment by Assured), on the Effective Date, the Acceleration Price for their Assured Insured Bonds, and thus, be effectively rendered unimpaired;\n   <em>\n    provided\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    however\n   </em>\n   , Assured will be subrogated to the rights of such holders and will receive distributions pursuant to the Plan, thereby rendering Assured's claims impaired. Therefore, there are no unimpaired Classes under the Plan.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-124\">\n   66. The Plan satisfies the requirements of section 1123(a)(2) of the Bankruptcy Code.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-125\">\n   <strong>\n    iv. Bankruptcy Code Section 1123(a)(3)\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-126\">\n   67. Articles V through XIV of the Plan identify the treatment of all Classes of Claims that are impaired under the Plan. (Exhibit DX-G.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-127\">\n   68. The Plan satisfies the requirements of section 1123(a)(3) of the Bankruptcy Code.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-128\">\n   <strong>\n    v. Bankruptcy Code Section 1123(a)(4)\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-129\">\n   69. Articles V through XIV of the Plan provide that the treatment of each Claim in each particular Class is the same as the treatment of each other Claim in such Class, except to the extent that a holder of an Allowed Claim has agreed to less favorable treatment of its Claim. If a holder of a Claim in Class 1 or 5 elects out of such Class so as to receive all taxable bonds, rather than a mix of taxable and tax-exempt bonds, pursuant to the Plan, such holder is no longer in such Class, and, instead, is treated as a holder of a Claim in Class 4 or 7, respectively. (Jaresko Decl. \u00b6 42; Exhibit DX-G.) Accordingly, all holders of Claims in each of Classes 1, 4, 5, and 7 receive the same treatment as other Claims in the same Class pursuant to the Plan. Objections to the existence of the Taxable Election Class and the different treatment of holders of claims who elect to have their claims placed into the Junior Taxable Election Class do not implicate Section 1123(a)(4).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-130\">\n   70. Consummation Costs are being paid to the parties to the A&amp;R Plan Support Agreement and are not being paid to the Consummation Cost Parties on account of their Claims against COFINA. (Jaresko Decl. \u00b6 43; Exhibit DX-G.) During the lengthy and complex court-sanctioned mediation led by Chief Bankruptcy Judge Houser, the Consummation Cost Parties agreed to various conditions and covenants set forth in the A&amp;R Plan Support Agreement, including, among other things, a pledge to support the Plan, the imposition of restrictions on the transfer of their bonds, and a waiver of their right to seek reimbursement of expenses through other\n   means, including through substantial contribution claims. As consideration for their efforts in assisting in the formulation of the Plan that has garnered significant creditor support, continuing to assist in the finalization of definitive agreements and ancillary documents, and the costs incurred in those and other efforts (including the expenses of defending COFINA's property interests for which the PSA Creditors asserted a right to seek substantial contribution claims), the Oversight Board determined that it was fair and reasonable for the Consummation Cost Parties to be paid the Consummation Costs. Based upon representations of counsel and, in some instances, pleadings filed with the Title III Court, the Oversight Board estimates the aggregate postpetition fees and expenses of the Consummation Cost Parties to be at least $ 135 million. (Jaresko Decl. \u00b6 43; Rodrigue Decl. \u00b6 8.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-131\">\n   71. The Consummation Cost Parties hold nearly $ 10 billion of the outstanding $ 17.6 billion in outstanding Bond Claims. Thus, approximately $ 190 million ($ 10 billion / $ 17.6 billion * $ 332 million) of the Consummation Costs (approximately 2% of their collective $ 10 billion claim) would have been distributed to the Consummation Cost Parties in the absence of the Consummation Costs provision. Accordingly, the Consummation Cost provision provides for a \"net\" incremental payment for the Consummation Cost Parties of approximately $ 140 million. This amount equates to approximately 1.3% of the total Allowed Bond Claims of the Consummation Cost Parties. The Oversight Board estimates the aggregate postpetition fees and expenses of the Consummation Cost Parties to exceed the \"net\" cost of the Consummation Costs of approximately $ 140 million. (Jaresko Decl. \u00b6 44.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-132\">\n   72. Unlike the Commonwealth and the other Title III debtors in these jointly-administered cases, COFINA does not have a statutory creditors' committee representing the interests of COFINA creditors. Under section 1103(c)(3) of the Bankruptcy Code, made applicable to COFINA's Title III Case under section 301 of PROMESA, participation in the formulation of a plan is a function of a statutory committee, the expenses of which are entirely borne by the debtor. Here, the PSA Creditors served as the counterparty to the Oversight Board and AAFAF in negotiating the Plan and in ensuring the Oversight Board that it had significant creditor support for the Plan.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-133\">\n   73. The payment of the Consummation Costs was a critical component of the interlocking agreements set forth in the A&amp;R Plan Support Agreement. The absence of the A&amp;R Plan Support Agreement could have resulted in a costly, contentious, and lengthy confirmation process for COFINA. Under such a scenario, there would be no certainty that a confirmable plan could be presented to creditors and the Court for approval, further delaying recoveries to creditors who have not received any payments on their bonds for more than eighteen (18) months. In consideration of the benefits obtained for COFINA in entering into the A&amp;R Plan Support Agreement, the benefits to COFINA creditors from the mediation and the costs to and burdens of intense mediation with the Consummation Cost Parties, the Oversight Board determined that it was an appropriate use of COFINA's property to pay the Consummation Costs and provide an opportunity for COFINA to emerge from Title III as expeditiously as possible.

The Plan is consistent with section 1123(b)(2) of the Bankruptcy Code.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-154\">\n   <strong>\n    ix. Bankruptcy Code Section 1123(b)(3)(A)\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-155\">\n   83. The Plan incorporates the settlement and compromise of, among other things, (a) the Commonwealth-COFINA Dispute Settlement in Article II of the Plan, (b) issues regarding the relative rights between senior and junior COFINA bondholders that remain the subject of the Interpleader Action, and (c) the treatment of holders of Senior COFINA Bond Claims (Ambac) and Senior COFINA Bond Claims (National). The Plan is the result of extensive arms' length negotiations among the Governmental Parties and significant creditor constituencies, including the PSA Creditors, each of which was represented by sophisticated counsel, and the compromises and settlements among the Governmental Parties and various PSA Creditors form the very foundation of the Plan. In absence of such compromises and settlements, COFINA's emergence from Title III would likely be significantly delayed by currently stayed and other litigation and burdened by additional expense, which could impair the ability of COFINA to successfully adjust its debts, thereby prejudicing the recovery for all creditors and raising further uncertainties concerning the Commonwealth and COFINA's financial condition. Each of the compromises and settlements incorporated into the Plan (a) is made in good faith, furthers the policies and purposes of PROMESA, is fair, equitable, and reasonable; (b) is in the best interests of COFINA, its creditors, and all other affected Persons with respect to the Claims, Causes of Action, and other matters resolved by such compromises and settlements; (c) is within the range of reasonable results if the issues were litigated; (d) falls above the lowest point in the range of reasonableness; and (e) meets the standards for approval under sections 105(a) and 1123(b) of the Bankruptcy Code, Bankruptcy Rule 9019(a), and other applicable law.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-156\">\n   84. Further, the Plan will fairly and consensually resolve six adversary proceedings pending in the Court, two appeals pending in the First Circuit Court of Appeals, and an additional court action pending in the District of Puerto Rico but not before the Title III Court, each of which raises difficult and complex issues. The Plan thus incorporates a complex series of interrelated compromises and settlements that resolve the most significant potential obstacle to confirmation of a plan of adjustment. Moreover, since the compromises and settlements are inextricably interwoven, they all hinge on one another and the approval of all of these compromises and settlements is required in order to satisfy the conditions to the Effective Date set forth in the Plan.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-157\">\n   85. Accordingly, the Plan is consistent with section 1123(b)(3)(A) of the Bankruptcy Code.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-158\">\n   <strong>\n    x. Bankruptcy Code Section 1123(b)(3)(B)\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-159\">\n   86. The Plan is premised upon the Settlement, which is integral to the Plan and settles and compromises the Commonwealth-COFINA Dispute. The Settlement has been determined to be fair and reasonable and in the best interests of all creditors and above the lowest rung in the range of reasonableness.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-160\">\n   87. Section 26.1 of the Plan provides that, \"[e]xcept as settled and released herein, from and after the Effective Date, Reorganized COFINA shall have the exclusive right and power to litigate any Claim or Cause of Action that constituted an Asset of COFINA, including, without limitation, any Avoidance Action, and any other Cause of Action, right to payment, or Claim that may be pending on the Effective Date or instituted by COFINA or Reorganized COFINA thereafter, to a Final\n   Order, and may compromise and settle such claims, without approval of the Title III Court.\" (Exhibit DX-G.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-161\">\n   88.

Section 18.4 of the Plan provides for the payment of cure amounts required to be paid to the counterparties of Executory Contracts that are assumed, or assumed and assigned under the Plan. All cure amounts will be determined in accordance with the underlying agreements and applicable nonbankruptcy law, and pursuant to the procedures established by the Plan. (Exhibit DX-G.) The Debtor is not aware of any monetary defaults it must cure. (Jaresko Decl. \u00b6 54.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-171\">\n   95. The Plan is consistent with section 1123(d) of the Bankruptcy Code.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-172\">\n   <strong>\n    xiv. Bankruptcy Code Section 1129(a)(2)\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-173\">\n   96. COFINA (i) has complied with applicable provisions of the Bankruptcy Code, except as otherwise provided or permitted by orders of this Court, and (ii) has complied with the applicable provisions of the Bankruptcy Code, the Bankruptcy Rules, the Local Rules, and the Disclosure Statement Order in transmitting the Disclosure Statement, the Plan, the Ballots, the Election Notices, and related documents, and in soliciting and tabulating votes on the Plan. (Jaresko Decl. \u00b6 55.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-174\">\n   97. The Oversight Board, with the assistance of its professionals, and in coordination with AAFAF, expended significant time and effort preparing the Disclosure Statement, and sought and received input and comment thereon from all the parties to the A&amp;R Plan Support Agreement, and all other parties in interest. This Court approved the Disclosure Statement as containing adequate information and meeting the requirements of sections 1125 and 1126 of the Bankruptcy Code. (Jaresko Decl. \u00b6 55.) Based upon the volume of ballots received and elections made, it is clear the\n   Debtor has properly solicited with respect to the Plan, including with respect to each of the possible elections under the Plan. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Pullo Decl. \u00b6\u00b6 7-8, Exh. A.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-175\">\n   98. The Debtor has complied with section 1129(a)(2) of the Bankruptcy Code.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-176\">\n   <strong>\n    xv. Bankruptcy Code Section 1129(a)(3)\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-177\">\n   99. The Plan was proposed in good faith with the legitimate and honest purpose to provide a method for a covered territory to achieve fiscal responsibility and access to capital markets, consistent with the purposes of PROMESA. The Oversight Board, as proponent of the Plan, is the duly-appointed representative of COFINA in its Title III Case as provided under PROMESA and is in all respects consistent with applicable law. In determining that the Plan has been proposed in good faith, the Court has examined the totality of the circumstances surrounding the filing of the Title III Case, the Plan itself, the lengthy process leading to the Plan's formulation (including the compromises, settlements, and releases incorporated therein), and the process associated with the Plan's prosecution. The Debtor's good faith is evident from the facts and records of the Title III Case, the Disclosure Statement and the hearing thereon, and the record of the Confirmation Hearing and other proceedings held in the Title III Case, including related adversary proceedings. The Plan (including the settlements and compromises contained therein) is the result of extensive arm's-length negotiations among the Settlement Parties through mediation led by Chief Bankruptcy Judge Houser. The Agreement in Principle was the product of an independent process overseen by the court-appointed Mediation Team in which the Oversight Board did not participate nor did it have any control over the parties who could participate. (Jaresko Decl. \u00b6 56.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-178\">\n   100. The Oversight Board built upon the Agreement in Principle and engaged in over two weeks of mediation among interested parties on a COFINA plan of adjustment and the attendant issues that needed to be resolved for a viable plan to be proposed, including the relative rights between senior and junior COFINA bondholders that remain the subject of the Interpleader Action. (Jaresko Decl. \u00b6 57.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-179\">\n   101. All major Classes of Claims were represented in such mediation. (Brownstein Decl. \u00b6\u00b6 18-20; Jaresko Decl. \u00b6 58.) The Senior COFINA Bondholders' Coalition represented the interests of holders of Senior COFINA Bond Claims. Ambac and National, as monoline insurers of such Claims, in aggregate amounts in excess of $ 2 billion, participated on behalf of their respective interests and protected the interests of their insureds. Assured, an insurer of approximately $ 274 million in \"First Subordinate\" Existing Securities, is aligned with the economic interest of the holders of Junior COFINA Bond Claims and has no exposure, either through insurance coverage or beneficial ownership, to Senior COFINA Bonds. Assured participated in Plan mediation and was a party to the A&amp;R Plan Support Agreement. Additionally, retail COFINA bondholders were represented throughout the process by retail or mutual funds, representing the interests of mainland and \"on-island\" bondholders, and Bonistas, advocating for the interests of Puerto Rico resident bondholders, actively participated. All are signatories to the A&amp;R Plan Support Agreement that included terms for the treatment of senior and junior COFINA bondholders to settle the issues of the relative rights between the senior and junior COFINA bondholders. (Brownstein Decl. \u00b6 19.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-180\">\n   102. The Plan represents the culmination of months of intensive negotiations and discussions among parties representing\n   the interests of all COFINA and Commonwealth stakeholders in an independently driven process facilitated by the court-appointed Mediation Team. Throughout the Plan negotiations, various constituencies were represented in the negotiation of the Plan, as illustrated by the widespread creditor participation in and execution of the A&amp;R Plan Support Agreement. Cumulatively, such parties hold, own, beneficially own, or insure approximately an aggregate $ 5.6 billion in senior COFINA bonds, and $ 3.7 billion in junior COFINA bonds. (Brownstein Decl. \u00b6 20.) No entity or constituency was denied access to the mediated settlement negotiation process. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Jaresko Decl. \u00b6 22 (stating that the Oversight Board worked with \"any creditor party who sought to participate to formulate procedures agreeable to the interested parties\" as part of the mediation process); (\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   Docket Entry No. 560 in Case No. 17-3283,\n   <em>\n    Order and Notice of Meeting with Representatives of Mediation Team\n   </em>\n   ).)\n   <footnotemark>\n    13\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-181\">\n   103. The Plan is designed to implement the settlement and compromise of, among other things, the Commonwealth-COFINA Dispute and the Interpleader Action, and maximize value for COFINA's creditors, while avoiding protracted litigation which could delay distributions to creditors, or worse, result in no recoveries for any COFINA creditors. (Jaresko Decl. \u00b6 57.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-182\">\n   104. The Plan and the Disclosure Statement reflect the culmination of those efforts and the substantial input of each representative group.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-183\">\n   105. The Plan (including the Settlement Agreement and all other agreements, documents and instruments necessary to effectuate the Plan) achieves a rational adjustment of COFINA's debts, and properly distributes value to Creditors based upon their respective priorities, including through the implementation of parties' elections with respect to distributions. The Plan was proposed with the legitimate and honest purpose of maximizing the value of COFINA's property, and to maximize distributions to all creditors. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Jaresko Decl. \u00b6 57.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-184\">\n   106. The Plan complies with section 1129(a)(3) of the Bankruptcy Code.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-185\">\n   <strong>\n    xvi. Bankruptcy Code Section 1129(a)(6)\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-186\">\n   107. The Plan does not provide for any rate changes by COFINA, and, accordingly, such section of the Bankruptcy Code does not apply.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-187\">\n   <strong>\n    xvii. Bankruptcy Code Section 1129(a)(8)\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-188\">\n   108. Pursuant to the Disclosure Statement Order, the Court approved the Disclosure Statement and found, among other things, that the Disclosure Statement\n   contained \"adequate information\" within the meaning of section 1125 of the Bankruptcy Code and authorized the Debtor to solicit acceptance and rejections of the Plan, as well as certain elections with respect thereto. (Disclosure Statement Order \u00b6\u00b6 B, 2.) Prior to the transmission of the Disclosure Statement, the Debtor did not solicit acceptances of the Plan by any holder of Claims.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-189\">\n   109. The (i) Disclosure Statement Order, (ii) Confirmation Hearing Notice, (iii) Disclosure Statement (which includes as an exhibit a copy of the Plan), (iv) Ballots, (v) Election Notices, (vi) Class 6 Notice, and (vii) Notice of Non-Voting Status - Class 10 (collectively, the \"\n   <em>\n    Solicitation Packages\n   </em>\n   \") were served in compliance with the Bankruptcy Code, Bankruptcy Rules, Local Bankruptcy Rules, and the Disclosure Statement Order.

The (a) service of the Solicitation Packages, (b) publication of the Confirmation Hearing Notice, and (c) airing of radio advertisements regarding the approval of the Disclosure Statement, Confirmation Hearing date, Confirmation Objection Deadline, Voting Deadline, and Election Deadline: (i) were adequate and sufficient under the circumstances of the Title III Case; (ii) provided adequate and sufficient notice of the Voting Deadline, the Election Deadline, the Confirmation Objection Deadline, the method of voting or making an election of distribution under the Plan and the date, time and location of the Confirmation Hearing; (iii) provided holders of Claims with a reasonable period of time to make an informed decision to accept or reject the Plan and to make any election provided thereunder; (iv) were in compliance with PROMESA, the Bankruptcy Code, the Bankruptcy Rules, the Local Bankruptcy Rules, the Disclosure Statement Order, and any other applicable orders and rulings of the Court; and (v) provided due process to all parties in interest in the COFINA Title III Case. (Pullo Decl. \u00b6\u00b6 4-6; Service Affidavits.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-191\">\n   111. No other or further notice with respect to the Plan or the Confirmation Hearing is required. Based upon the foregoing, the Debtor and its successors, predecessors, control persons, representatives, officers, directors, employees, agents, attorneys, financial advisors, investment bankers, accountants, and other retained professionals, and any and all affiliates, managers, employees, attorneys and advisors of the foregoing (i) have acted in \"good faith\" within the meaning of section 1125(e) of the Bankruptcy Code in compliance with the applicable provisions of PROMESA, the Bankruptcy Code, the Bankruptcy Rules, the Local Bankruptcy Rules, and any applicable nonbankruptcy law, rule or regulation governing the adequacy of disclosure in connection with all its activities relating to the solicitation of acceptances to the Plan or elections thereunder and its participation in the activities described in section 1125 of the Bankruptcy Code and (ii) shall be deemed to have participated in good faith and in compliance with the applicable provisions of PROMESA and the Bankruptcy Code in the offer and issuance of securities under the Plan and, therefore, are not, and on account of such offer, issuance and solicitation will not be, liable at any time for the violation of any applicable law, rule, or regulation governing the solicitation of acceptances or rejections of the Plan or elections thereunder or the offer and issuance of the securities under the Plan, and are entitled to the protections afforded by section 1125(e) of the Bankruptcy Code and, to the extent such parties are listed therein, the exculpation provisions set forth in Section 30.7 of the Plan.

Based on an analysis of the provisions of the New Bond Legislation and the record before the Court, the Court finds that the enactment of the New Bond Legislation was a proper exercise of the Legislative Assembly's constitutional power to designate revenues for a legitimate public purpose. Specifically, the New Bond Legislation designates a portion of the COFINA sales tax revenues to be transferred to COFINA in order for COFINA to fully satisfy and discharge the potential judicial liabilities of the Commonwealth and COFINA by issuing new non-recourse bonds. Accordingly, the Court finds that the New Bond Legislation has been validly enacted, is valid, and, subject to the occurrence of the Effective Date of the Plan, is binding and enforceable.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-205\">\n   121. The Plan contains no provisions that would require it to violate the Contracts Clause of the Constitution of the United States. The Contracts Clause provides that no state shall pass any law impairing the obligation of contracts. U.S. Const. art. I, \u00a7 10, cl. 1. While a state or territory cannot make a law impairing the obligation of contracts, Congress is empowered to do so pursuant to Article I, Section 8 of the Constitution, which provides that Congress shall have the power to establish uniform laws on the subject of bankruptcies throughout the United States. U.S. Const. art. I, \u00a7 8, cl. 4. It has long been recognized that one of the fundamental goals of bankruptcy law is to adjust the debtor-creditor relationship, that is, to alter contract rights.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    In re City of Stockton, Cal.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6052853\" index=\"26\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/br/478/8/#p14\">\n    478 B.R. 8\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 14-15 (Bankr.

It follows that this Court may approve the Plan under PROMESA, a federal law enacted by Congress with the express purpose of allowing Puerto Rico to achieve fiscal responsibility and access to the capital markets through,\n   <em>\n    inter\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    alia\n   </em>\n   , adjustment of its debts and those of its instrumentalities, without offending the Constitution. In this connection, Mr. Hein has failed to demonstrate that the fiscal plans constitute territorial laws subject to the restrictions of the Contracts Clause, and his objection with respect to the fiscal plans is therefore overruled. To the extent that Mr. Hein argues that the New Bond Legislation is itself unconstitutional under the Contracts Clause, the Court concludes that the legislation is reasonable and necessary in light of the surrounding circumstances. Although the language of the Contracts Clause is \"unequivocal,\" it \"does not make unlawful every state law that conflicts with any contract.\"\n   <em>\n    United Auto., Aero., Agric. Impl.

The First Circuit considers \"the reasonableness inquiry\" to \"ask[ ] whether the law is reasonable in light of the surrounding circumstances,\" while \"the necessity inquiry focuses on whether Puerto Rico imposed a drastic impairment when an evident and more moderate course would serve its purposes equally well.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4090583\" index=\"35\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/633/37/#p41\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4090583\" index=\"35\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/633/37/#p41\">\n    at 45-46\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . In analyzing these questions, courts may consider \"whether the act (1) was an emergency measure; (2) was one to protect a basic societal interest, rather than particular individuals; (3) was tailored appropriately to its purpose; (4) imposed reasonable conditions; and (5) was limited to the duration of the emergency.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4090583\" index=\"36\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/633/37/#p41\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4090583\" index=\"36\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/633/37/#p41\">\n    at 46\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . The circumstances surrounding the enactment of the New Bond Legislation are clear: the Commonwealth Legislature enacted the New Bond Legislation in response to the Commonwealth's unprecedented fiscal and economic crisis and the need to resolve litigation concerning the legality of the COFINA structure. Faced with the possibilities that, on the one hand, if COFINA were to prevail in the Commonwealth-COFINA dispute,\n   <em>\n    none\n   </em>\n   of the SUT Revenues that are the subject of that dispute would be available for the Commonwealth's use towards payment for essential services or for distribution to its creditors and, on the other, the purported dedication of SUT revenues to COFINA to support bond repayments could be invalidated if the Commonwealth were to prevail, the Legislature agreed to enact a law that would aid the effectuation of the settlement of that dispute. The Legislature's decision is a reasonable one under the surrounding circumstances. It is also necessary in light of the ongoing fiscal emergency in Puerto Rico. The Court therefore concludes that the Contracts Clause does not prohibit confirmation of the Plan, and Mr. Hein's objections invoking the Contracts Clause are therefore overruled.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-206\">\n   122. The Plan contains no provisions that would violate the Takings\n   Clause of the Constitution of the United States. Several bondholders have argued that the Plan and Settlement Agreement take bondholder property-specifically, the lien on revenues dedicated to COFINA that secures repayment of the bonds issued by COFINA-without just compensation. The proper analytical framework for addressing the objectors' Takings Clause challenge is set forth in\n   <em>\n    Penn Central Transportation v. City of New York\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1769262\" index=\"37\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/438/104/#p124\">\n    438 U.S. 104\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 124,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1769262\" index=\"38\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/438/104/#p124\">\n    98 S.Ct. 2646\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1769262\" index=\"39\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/438/104/#p124\">\n    57 L.Ed.2d 631\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1978).\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Patriot Portfolio v.

Pursuant to that test, courts consider three factors: \"(1) the economic impact of the regulation on the claimant; (2) the extent to which the regulation interferes with the claimant's reasonable investment-backed expectations; and (3) the character of the governmental action.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11775449,1381172\" index=\"41\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/164/677/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   Considering the first factor, the Court notes that the actions challenged by the objecting parties will not result in the total destruction of the value of the liens securing the existing bonds. Pursuant to the terms of the Plan, bondholders will receive substantial value in new secured bonds and, in some cases, cash. Furthermore, based upon the record before it, the Court finds that the resolution of substantial legal challenges to the structure underlying the existing COFINA bonds provides significant value to the bondholders. Second, although the proposed treatment of bondholders' claims may interfere with certain bondholders' subjective investment expectations, bondholders' reasonable expectations must take account of the claims and potential claims that have been the subject of the substantial litigation that the Settlement Agreement and the Plan, which were negotiated with the assistance of the Mediation Team, propose to resolve.\n   <em>\n    Cf.\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    New Haven Inclusion Cases\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6170136\" index=\"42\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/399/392/#p492\">\n    399 U.S. 392\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 492,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6170136\" index=\"43\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/399/392/#p492\">\n    90 S.Ct. 2054\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6170136\" index=\"44\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/399/392/#p492\">\n    26 L.Ed.2d 691\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1970) (noting that security holders \"invested their capital in a public utility that does owe an obligation to the public [and thereby] assumed the risk that in any depression or any reorganization the interests of the public would be considered as well as theirs\") (quotation marks omitted) ). Third, the character of the governmental action strongly supports the Court's conclusion that the Plan and Settlement Agreement do not result in an unconstitutional taking. The challenged proposals are not physical invasions of property by the government. Rather, the restructuring of the relationships between the Commonwealth and COFINA, and between COFINA and its bondholders, using the powers established by Congress in PROMESA is a quintessential example of a \"public program adjusting the benefits and burdens of economic life to promote the common good.\"\n   <em>\n    Penn Cent.

Furthermore, even if the reduction of dedicated revenues and restructuring of bond terms under the Plan or Settlement Agreement incorporated therein result in a Fifth Amendment \"taking\" of bondholder property, the Court is satisfied that the value to be received by bondholders as a result of the settlement of the Commonwealth-COFINA dispute and under the Plan constitutes just compensation. The secured creditors' Takings Clause claim is properly assessed based upon the value of the lien, not the face amount of debt.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    In re Aegean Fare, Inc.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6121131\" index=\"47\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/br/33/745/#p747\">\n    33 B.R. 745\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 747-48 (Bankr.

As discussed above, the Commonwealth has validly enacted the New Bond Legislation, which New Bond Legislation is valid, and, subject to the occurrence of the Effective Date of the Plan, is binding and enforceable, and there are no approvals left to obtain to effectuate the Plan. By approving and certifying the COFINA Fiscal Plan, the Oversight Board provided approval for the issuance of securities contemplated by the Plan as required by PROMESA section 207. (Jaresko Decl. \u00b6 66.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-214\">\n   128. The Plan satisfies PROMESA section 314(b)(5).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-215\">\n   <strong>\n    F. PROMESA \u00a7 314(b)(6)\n   </strong>\n   <em>\n    : The Plan Is Feasible and in the Best Interests of Creditors\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-216\">\n   129. The COFINA Fiscal Plan, certified on October 18, 2018, demonstrates that the Plan is feasible, because the COFINA Fiscal Plan provides for the incurrence of obligations contemplated by the Plan and shows that such obligations can be repaid. COFINA's Fiscal Plan projections (as set forth in greater detail in Section XVIII of the Disclosure Statement, entitled \"Financial Information and Projections\" and\n   <em>\n    Exhibit E\n   </em>\n   thereto) demonstrate, as a result of COFINA's ownership of the COFINA Portion, COFINA's ability to fulfill its obligations under the Plan. COFINA's financial projections (and its underlying assumptions) are reasonable and demonstrate a probability that COFINA will be able to satisfy its obligations under the Plan. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Brownstein Decl. \u00b6\u00b6 29-34.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-217\">\n   130. COFINA has no power to raise taxes. The alternative to the Plan is protracted litigation in the Adversary Proceeding, which could lead to an all-or-nothing recovery for either the Commonwealth or COFINA. For any individual class of COFINA creditors to do better than it will under the Plan, COFINA would have to prevail in the Adversary Proceeding, which result is at best uncertain. Even if one side to the litigation were to prevail in this Court, litigation costs would skyrocket, and it could be months, if not years, before a court issues a final, unappealable order resolving who is entitled to the SUT Revenues. (Jaresko Decl. \u00b6 67.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-218\">\n   131. Moreover, the Plan provides additional protections for COFINA and its creditors, such as a federal court order \"quieting title\" to COFINA's ownership of a majority of the Pledged Sales Tax Base Amount-and on a first-dollars basis-against all challenges, removing the cloud over title to COFINA's property interest that has existed since COFINA's creation in 2007, as well as enhanced non-impairment and substitution covenants. If the Plan were to be rejected, and the Commonwealth-COFINA Dispute were litigated to conclusion, even if COFINA were successful, it would not have these strong protections. Nor would successful litigation regarding COFINA's ownership rights necessarily have prevented the Commonwealth from attempting to enact other measures that could have reduced the sales tax transferred to COFINA, or even from outright repealing the sales tax, spurring rounds of litigation as to the appropriate remedies, if any. The Plan, and the Confirmation Order, will ensure COFINA's revitalization and will prevent any challenges to COFINA's ownership of, and any attempts by other parties to divert, COFINA's portion of the Pledged Sales Tax Base Amount. Such outcome is unquestionably in the best interest of COFINA's creditors.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-219\">\n   132. Independent of the validity of the transfer of the SUT to COFINA, the holders of \"First Subordinate\" Existing Securities face the risk that an event of default will accelerate the bonds such that \"First Subordinate\" Existing Securities are not paid until holders of \"Senior\" Existing Securities are paid in full. The Existing Bond Resolution provides that, upon an event of default, the Trustee may, or upon the written request of owners of 25% of all outstanding \"Senior\" Existing Securities, shall, declare the principal of and accrued interest on the \"Senior\" Existing Securities to be immediately due and payable. Upon such declaration, the principal of, and accrued interest on, the \"Senior\" Existing Securities becomes immediately due and payable. In addition, upon a declaration of an event of default, holders of \"First Subordinate\" (\n   <em>\n    i.e.\n   </em>\n   , junior) Existing Securities may not declare a default, or cause the Trustee to take any remedial\n   action thereunder until such time that the \"Senior\" Existing Securities are fully retired or are defeased in accordance with the provision of the Existing Bond Resolution. The senior bondholders have taken the view that, upon an event of default, the Existing Bond Resolution provides for the priority of payments in favor of the \"Senior Existing Securities\" if the funds held by the Trustee are insufficient for the payment of interest and principal or Compounded Amount (as defined in the Existing Bond Resolution) or redemption price then due. (Jaresko Decl. \u00b6 68.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-220\">\n   133. If the Plan were not confirmed, the parties would lose the benefit of the Court-sanctioned agreement resolving the Commonwealth-COFINA Dispute. Litigation would continue in an all-or-nothing fashion, leaving some creditors potentially much worse off and some creditors potentially better off. The Plan's provision for a distribution of approximately 93% of the aggregate value of claims held by the holders of \"Senior\" Existing Securities (\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Plan \u00a7 1.168) and approximately 56% of the aggregate value of claims held by the \"First Subordinate\" Existing Securities (\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Plan \u00a7 1.114), in light of the risks attendant to the Commonwealth-COFINA Dispute and the Interpleader Action, among others, is likely far superior to what both groups of bondholders might receive outside of the Plan. The Plan avoids the pitfalls of delay, litigation costs, and uncertainty by implementing the consensual agreement reached by the major stakeholders in the Title III Case in a manner consistent with the Procedures Order. The robust acceptance of the Plan by the various classes indicates such creditors believe the Plan to be in their best interests. (Jaresko Decl. \u00b6 69.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-221\">\n   134. The Oversight Board retained Citi to serve as investment banker and financial advisor to the Oversight Board in connection with the Oversight Board's statutory duties under PROMESA and its task of working with the Commonwealth to create the necessary foundation for economic growth and to restore opportunity to the people of the Commonwealth. Citi developed the Securities Terms to address the concerns of both COFINA and its bondholders and were designed with two focal points in mind: (i) to ensure broad market access to Reorganized COFINA on a go-forward basis; and (ii) to provide all existing COFINA creditors with as increased a potential recovery as possible by ensuring as high a market value as possible for the bonds issued pursuant to the Plan. In doing so, Citi had been informed by creditor representatives that they were particularly concerned about a possible double \"haircut\" (\n   <em>\n    i.e.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    first\n   </em>\n   , a reduction to the amount of their original claims through the Plan, and\n   <em>\n    second\n   </em>\n   , a subsequent reduction through less-valuable replacement bonds they receive in exchange for their original bonds). (Brownstein Decl. \u00b6\u00b6 12-13.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-222\">\n   135. The Securities Terms also provide that the COFINA Bonds to be issued pursuant to the Plan will bear fixed interest rates, including Current Interest Bonds (\"\n   <em>\n    CIBs\n   </em>\n   \"), which pay cash interest, and Capital Appreciation Bonds (\"\n   <em>\n    CABs\n   </em>\n   \"), which accrete non-cash interest until maturity. All COFINA Bonds accrue interest beginning as of August 1, 2018. The CIBs mature in 2034, 2040, 2053, and 2058 and have a par value in the aggregate of approximately $ 9 billion. The CABs mature in 2024, 2027, 2029, 2031, 2033, 2046, and 2051 and have an initial value of approximately $ 3 billion. (Plan \u00a7 16.1(a)-(b); Brownstein Decl. \u00b6 14.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-223\">\n   136. To provide protection to holders of the COFINA Bonds, the Securities Terms provide that no parity debt may be issued by Reorganized COFINA other than refinancing bonds (\"\n   <em>\n    COFINA Parity Bonds\n   </em>\n   \") that produce debt savings in each\n   year for Reorganized COFINA and no maturity extensions. (Brownstein Decl. \u00b6 15.) The Securities Terms also provide that Reorganized COFINA may issue subordinate lien bonds for the benefit of the Commonwealth only if the following requirements are satisfied (the \"Additional Bonds Test\"): (i) the projected 5.5% SUT equals or exceeds one and one-half\n   <em>\n    times\n   </em>\n   (1.5x), in any succeeding Fiscal Year, the annual aggregate debt service due on the COFINA Bonds, the COFINA Parity Bonds and subordinated lien bonds to remain outstanding after the issuance of such subordinated lien bonds (including the subordinated lien bonds to be issued); (ii) the preceding Fiscal Year's collections from the 5.5% SUT is equal to or greater than one and one-tenth\n   <em>\n    times\n   </em>\n   (1.10x) coverage of the maximum annual aggregate debt service due in any succeeding Fiscal Year on all COFINA Bonds, COFINA Parity and subordinated lien bonds to remain outstanding after the issuance of such subordinated lien bonds (including the subordinated lien bonds to be issued); and (iii) the subordinated lien bonds have a maturity not later than Fiscal Year 2058;\n   <em>\n    provided\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    however\n   </em>\n   , that, subsequent to June 30, 2028, and subject to compliance with the foregoing Additional Bonds Test, final maturity beyond Fiscal Year 2058 shall be permissible for future subordinated lien bonds. (Brownstein Decl. \u00b6 15; Second Amended Plan Supplement at Exhibit A, \u00a7 2.04(b).) In addition, the Securities Terms provide that the repayment of such subordinated lien bonds shall be secured by a second lien that is subordinated in all respects, including, without limitation, in respect of payment, funding and remedies to the COFINA Bonds and COFINA Parity Bonds, with repayment of subordinated lien bonds being secured by a subordinated second or more junior lien on the 5.5% SUT Taxes;\n   <em>\n    provided\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    however\n   </em>\n   , that repayment of the Subordinated Lien Bonds shall not be payable from the COFINA Revenues. To support the credit rating of the COFINA Bonds, the Securities Terms also provide for (a) a non-impairment covenant of the Commonwealth, which provides, among other things, that (i) the pledged SUT percentage shall not be reduced to a rate less than 5.5% unless, in connection with such reduction, Reorganized COFINA shall have received a Rating Confirmation from each of at least two of the rating services then providing a credit rating on the outstanding COFINA Bonds and COFINA Parity Bonds, that the rating of such rating service on the COFINA Bonds and COFINA Parity Bonds (without regard to bond insurance or other credit enhancement) will not be downgraded and will be at least A2/A category or higher following such reduction;\n   <em>\n    provided\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    however\n   </em>\n   , that, notwithstanding the foregoing, if the pledged SUT percentage is reduced below 3%, then, in connection with such reduction, the Commonwealth shall comply with the certain substitution requirements. Further, the Securities Terms provide that repayment of the COFINA Bonds and COFINA Parity Bonds is to be secured by a statutory first lien on Reorganized COFINA's interest in the 5.5% pledged SUT. (Brownstein Decl. \u00b6 16.) The Securities Terms are set forth in the Plan and Amended Plan Supplement and may be amended, restated, supplemented, or otherwise modified in accordance with the terms and provisions hereof and thereof, as applicable.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-224\">\n   137. Each series of Existing Securities was issued pursuant to a supplemental resolution providing for its issuance and the terms of such series, in each case adopted by the Board of Directors of COFINA. The Resolution together with the supplemental resolutions issued pursuant thereto is referred to as the \"\n   <em>\n    Existing Bond Resolution\n   </em>\n   .\" The various supplemental resolutions authorized the issuance of both \"Subordinate Bonds\" and \"Senior Bonds\" as\n   defined in the Resolution. (Brownstein Decl. \u00b6 21.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-225\">\n   138. As of the Petition Date, COFINA had outstanding $ 17.64 billion aggregate principal and unpaid interest amount of bonds issued under the Existing Bond Resolution, including approximately $ 7.76 billion of claims arising from \"Senior\" Existing Securities and approximately $ 9.88 billion of claims arising from \"First Subordinate\" Existing Securities. Approximately $ 1.33 billion of the \"Senior\" Existing Securities are insured by Ambac and $ 1.10 billion are insured by National. Approximately $ 0.25 billion of the \"First Subordinate\" Existing Securities are insured by Assured. (Brownstein Decl. \u00b6 21.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-226\">\n   139. The Existing Bond Resolution in respect of \"Senior\" Existing Securities provides for the issuance of additional bonds that are \"subordinate to payment of the Senior Bonds and which are further subject to the terms of priority of payment among the several Classes, if any, of Subordinate Bonds.\" Many supplemental resolutions issued subsequent to the Resolution indicate that Bonds issued thereunder are \"First Subordinate\" Existing Securities. For example, the Seventh Resolution provides that \"[a]ll of the Series 2009A Bonds shall constitute \"Subordinate Bonds\" under the Resolution.\" (Brownstein Decl. \u00b6 22; DX-XX.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-227\">\n   140. The \"First Subordinate\" Existing Securities cannot declare an event of default or control remedies until the \"Senior\" Existing Securities are satisfied in full. If an event of default under the Existing Bond Resolution had occurred, the senior bondholders could have had repayment of their bonds accelerated, all to the detriment of the junior bondholders. Furthermore, senior bondholders could have established an entitlement to the face value of their bonds and a \"make-whole\" provision before the junior bondholders received any distributions. (Rodrigue Decl. \u00b6 4.) Independent of the validity of the transfer of certain sales and use taxes to COFINA, senior bondholders have taken the view that such acceleration would have required the senior bondholders to be paid in full before junior bondholders could declare an event of default and exercise remedies. (Brownstein Decl. \u00b6 23; Rodrigue Decl. \u00b6 4; Exhibit DX-K.) However, neither the Ambac Insurance Policy nor the National Insurance Policies insures against loss of prepayment premiums, which include \"make-whole\" provisions.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-228\">\n   141. The contractual subordination of the junior COFINA bondholders to the senior COFINA bondholders includes the risk that the amount of SUT available to bondholders is compromised. The original bargained-for agreement between junior and senior COFINA bondholders includes the possibility that, if monies available to COFINA bondholders are reduced, senior bondholders shall be satisfied first. This contractual subordination is not just related to the risk the SUT revenues are less than projected, but covers all possible reasons for a reduction in revenues. One risk was that an event of default occurred, and the acceleration provision in the Bond Resolution was triggered, such that only senior COFINA bondholders would be entitled to receive cash flows thereunder. In the senior bondholders' view, the senior-subordinate relationship and payment waterfall entitle seniors to payment in full before subordinate bondholders receive any recovery. Enforcement of strict priority following an event of default could result in senior bondholders receiving a par recovery plus post-petition interest and other entitlements under the Bond Resolution. In such a situation, subordinate bondholders would not receive any recovery for many years and the present value of any such recovery would be substantially less than the recovery subordinate bondholders\n   will receive under the Plan. (Brownstein Decl. \u00b6 24.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-229\">\n   142. A settlement regarding the validity of the COFINA structure and the ability of the SUT to flow into COFINA was also a potential risk to COFINA bondholders, even when the bondholders first purchased COFINA bonds. The Settlement relieves junior bondholders of these risks. (Brownstein Decl. \u00b6 25.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-230\">\n   143. The senior COFINA bondholders are receiving less than par on their bonds (approximately 93% recovery is projected for Class 1), while the junior bondholders are receiving a significant recovery. Had an event of default been recognized, or the SUT revenues been insufficient to satisfy all bondholders outside of this settlement, junior bondholders would bear the risk of not receiving any monies prior to senior bondholders being paid in full. (Brownstein Decl. \u00b6 25.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-231\">\n   144. The Settlement and securities issued pursuant to the Plan appropriately do not reflect the varying interest rates and maturities on the Existing Securities. As provided in Bankruptcy Code section 502, made applicable to COFINA's Title III Case pursuant to PROMESA section 301, for the purposes of distribution pursuant to the Plan, claims arising from the Existing Securities are valued, based solely on the outstanding principal amount and accrued interest and/or accreted capital appreciation, as of the day before the commencement of COFINA's Title III Case. (Exhibit DX-G; Brownstein Decl. \u00b6 26.) Any objections premised on the failure of the stated return percentage computations under the Plan to take into account future interest and maturity differentials are therefore overruled.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-232\">\n   145. It is uncertain whether all of the COFINA Bonds issued to holders of Existing Securities under the Plan will be tax-exempt. The Plan recognizes that many mainland investors were concerned that their recovery would be artificially depressed if they received taxable bonds on account of their Existing Securities. Puerto Rico Investors and Puerto Rico Institutions, however, generally are not subject to federal taxation. Accordingly, to address this concern, the Plan contains provisions that permit Puerto Rico Investors and Puerto Rico Institutions to elect to receive taxable bonds as well as a supplemental 2% cash recovery rather than a mix of taxable and tax-exempt bonds. Recoveries for mainland investors are enhanced by this election by maximizing the amount of tax-exempt securities available for such investors. (Brownstein Decl. \u00b6 27.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-233\">\n   146. Recoveries for all bondholders are enhanced if \"on island\" bondholders, who generally are not subject to U.S. federal income taxation, elect to be treated in Classes 4 or 7 and, as a result receive taxable bonds. When \"on island\" bondholders elect taxable treatment, the ability of mainland bondholders to receive a higher proportion, and potentially even all, of their distribution in tax-exempt COFINA bonds is enhanced, thereby enhancing recoveries for mainland bondholders. Providing the taxable election only to on-island bondholders ensures that both local and mainland investors receive reasonably equivalent treatment in respect of their claims. (Brownstein Decl. \u00b6 28.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-234\">\n   147. For all of these reasons, the Court finds that the Oversight Board has met its burden of demonstrating that the plan is in the best interests of creditors within the meaning of section 314(b)(6) of PROMESA. As in Chapter 9, PROMESA's \"best interests\" test differs substantially from the Chapter 11 \"best interests\" requirement. In Chapter 11, the test requires a court to determine whether an individual creditor would receive more if the Chapter 11 debtor were to liquidate its assets.\n   <em>\n    Cf.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-235\">\n   <em>\n    In re City of Detroit, Mich.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4338710\" index=\"51\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/br/524/147/#p212\">\n    524 B.R. 147\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 212-13 (Bankr. E.D. Mich. 2014) (comparing the \"best interests\" tests in Chapter 9 and Chapter 11 of the Bankruptcy Code). In contrast, the \"best interests\" test under PROMESA requires the Court to consider \"whether available remedies under the non-bankruptcy laws and constitution of the territory would result in a greater recovery for the creditors than is provided by [the] plan.\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"52\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=48%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%202174\">\n    48 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 2174\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (b)(6) (West 2017).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-236\">\n   148. The Oversight Board has demonstrated that, absent approval of the Plan and the Settlement Agreement, COFINA would be embroiled in ongoing litigation that would likely last months or even years. Beyond the costs associated with that litigation, COFINA's bondholders would also bear a substantial risk of an unfavorable outcome that would invalidate the Commonwealth's transfer of SUT revenues to COFINA. Furthermore, COFINA's subordinate bondholders would bear a further risk that, if an event of default occurred, their claims against COFINA would not be addressed until after satisfaction of the claims of senior bondholders. Under these circumstances, the proposed plan of adjustment satisfies PROMESA's best interest of creditors test.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-237\">\n   REORGANIZED COFINA'S REVENUES ARE SUFFICIENT TO SERVICE ITS DEBT OBLIGATIONS\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-238\">\n   149. Citi reviewed the COFINA Fiscal Plan for accuracy and conformity to the Agreement in Principle. The COFINA Fiscal Plan contemplates that debt service on the COFINA Bonds equals 53.65% of the PSTBA. (Brownstein Decl. \u00b6 30; Exhibit DX-SSS.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-239\">\n   150. Citi helped negotiate the terms of the Plan so that the debt service on the COFINA Bonds is slightly below 53.65% of the PSTBA, virtually identical to the amount contemplated by the COFINA Fiscal Plan. (Brownstein Decl. \u00b6 30.) Critically, the COFINA Revenues comprise the first collections of the 5.50% SUT in each Fiscal Year. Thus, the debt service on the COFINA Bonds is backed by the entire amount of the 5.50% SUT because a shortfall will only exist in the event that the entire amount of the 5.50% SUT generated in a Fiscal Year is less than 53.65% of the Pledged Sales Tax Base Amount. Accordingly, the debt service on the COFINA Bonds is consistent with the debt sustainability analysis contained in the COFINA Fiscal Plan.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-240\">\n   151. Citi's analysis of the COFINA Fiscal Plan showed that sound assumptions-that stimulus from disaster funds, structural and fiscal reforms to the Puerto Rico economy, and improvements in tax collection methods will maintain a robust amount of personal consumption in the Commonwealth-justify the COFINA Fiscal Plan's SUT projections. (Brownstein Decl. \u00b6 31.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-241\">\n   152. Citi's analysis further showed that, because the SUT is a tax of general application covering a broad range of goods and services with few exceptions, more spending and buying in the Commonwealth generates greater SUT revenues. Government and private disaster funding will stimulate spending and buying, and in turn, bolster SUT revenues. Altogether, over $ 82 billion in disaster relief funding is projected from 2018 to 2033. Among other things, this funding will be distributed directly to individuals and families affected by Hurricane Maria and will support reconstruction on the island. Such funds are reasonably projected to stimulate spending in the Commonwealth and maintain robust SUT revenue projections. Government reforms including labor, energy and corporate reforms are projected, to increase Puerto Rico's economic output by 0.95% by FY 2023. It is reasonable to assume that this economic growth will translate to growth in SUT revenues and\n   that better tax collection methods and increased compliance efforts will yield a 5% increase in total SUT collected by 2021. (Brownstein Decl. \u00b6 32.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-242\">\n   153. In FY 2019, the 5.5% SUT, from which COFINA collects \"first dollars\" pursuant to Section 16.3 of the Plan, is projected to be approximately $ 1.4 billion. The SUT taxable base from which Reorganized COFINA collects its revenue in \"first dollars\" should more than amply cover the debt service on COFINA Bonds in FY 2019 of $ 420 million. COFINA has a significant debt service coverage ratio of 3.33x (\n   <em>\n    i.e.\n   </em>\n   , $ 1.4 billion / $ 420 million) in FY 2019. While the debt service coverage ratio is projected to decrease as the PSTBA increases by 4% each year, the 40-year average coverage ratio is still a robust 2.46x. Further, the projected PSTBA reaches a plateau in FY 2041 and never increases after that point, so any subsequent increase in the 5.5% SUT after FY 2041 will necessarily improve the debt service coverage ratio. In fact, the 5.5% SUT could remain exactly the same until the last stated maturity date of any of the COFINA Bonds in FY 2058, and Reorganized COFINA would have no issue servicing the debt obligations on the COFINA Bonds. (Brownstein Decl. \u00b6 33.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-243\">\n   154.

The Commonwealth-COFINA Dispute presented the potential for extended, complex, expensive, and value-destructive litigation among competing interests and entities. A fundamental objective of the Debtor and the Oversight Board throughout COFINA's Title III Case has been to structure a transaction to fairly divide the SUT while avoiding the winner-take-all nature of litigation related to the validity of the COFINA structure and related claims. The prompt, efficient conclusion of COFINA's Title III Case is premised on the proposed comprehensive resolution and settlement of this dispute. (Jaresko Decl. \u00b6 73.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-250\">\n   159. None of these issues has been fully litigated in these cases. However, cross-motions for summary judgment had been\n   filed on the underlying constitutional questions, and significant resources had already been expended on the litigation. In an effort to avoid disputes that could jeopardize a consensual resolution creating the highest value for all stakeholders, the Agents and then the PSA Creditors engaged in good faith negotiations over a period of many months, as discussed above. The robust, arm's-length negotiations were successful and yielded substantial consensus and support for a consensual plan, as evidenced by the Agreement in Principle, culminating in the Settlement Agreement and the Plan that has garnered substantial creditor support from all impaired voting classes. (Jaresko Decl. \u00b6 74.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-251\">\n   160. In order to incentivize the PSA Creditors to grant the concessions outlined above, and in consideration of the substantial benefits provided by the Released Parties, the Debtor agreed to prosecute and pursue the releases, exculpation, and injunction provisions set forth in the Plan. Each aspect of the Settlement is interdependent and relied upon by the Agents and, especially, the PSA Creditors, who made material concessions as to their respective positions to enable the expeditious confirmation of the Plan. Such settlements take into account the legal and factual risks to the allowance of the claims. Modifications to any aspect of the Settlement or the failure to approve the Settlement undoubtedly may result in events of termination under the A&amp;R Plan Support Agreement, jeopardize settlement of the Commonwealth-COFINA Dispute, and set back the administration of COFINA's Title III Case for an extended period as holders of GO Debt and COFINA's Existing Securities get bogged down in the maze of litigation for prosecution of their claims. (Jaresko Decl. \u00b6 75.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-252\">\n   <strong>\n    A. Debtor Releases\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-253\">\n   161. Pursuant to Section 30.5 of the Plan, each of COFINA and Reorganized COFINA, the Disbursing Agent and each of COFINA's and Reorganized COFINA's Related Persons proposed to release the Released Parties from Claims or Causes of Action they may have against such Released Parties. The Debtor's Release constitutes a sound exercise of the Debtor's judgment and meets the applicable legal standard: the Debtor's Release is fair, reasonable, and in the best interests of the Debtor. During the course of negotiations regarding the Plan and predecessor agreements, it was clear that the Debtor's Release would be a necessary condition to consummation of the Settlement embodied in the Plan. In exchange for such releases, the Debtor secured the substantial concessions provided by the Settlement and the Plan. Similarly, the Released Parties provided integral support throughout COFINA's Title III Case, and incurred significant costs in doing so. (Jaresko Decl. \u00b6 76.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-254\">\n   162. Furthermore, with the exclusion of the Commonwealth-COFINA Dispute, which is being compromised pursuant to the Settlement and incorporated into the Plan, and acts relating to the Ambac Action and Whitebox Actions, which are being preserved pursuant to the Plan,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Section 30.2(c), the Debtor is not aware of any claims that could be asserted against the Released Parties and no creditor has informed the Debtor that it believes such an action should be brought, which the Debtor believes would be meritorious. In addition, without the assurance of protection from liability, the Released Parties involved in the Plan process may not have participated in the negotiations that led to the development of the Settlement and Plan. Had the Debtor's Release not been provided, the Debtor's chances of resolving the Commonwealth-COFINA Dispute, and proposing the Plan that was ultimately accepted by every voting Class, would have been diminished. (Jaresko Decl. \u00b6 77.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-255\">\n   <strong>\n    B. Consensual Releases\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-256\">\n   163. Section 30.2 of the Plan provides for the Consensual Releases of the Released Parties by the holders of Claims. The consensual releases seek only to release parties that made a significant contribution to the Plan:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-257\">\n   a. COFINA and Reorganized COFINA, from all Claims or Causes of Action, and from all Entities,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Plan \u00a7 30.2(a)-(b);\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-258\">\n   b. the Government Releasees, from all Government Released Claims or any of the claims or causes of action asserted or which could have been asserted in the Actions, who are being released by each of the PSA Creditors and their respective Related Persons,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Plan \u00a7 30.2(c);\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-259\">\n   c. BNYM and (a) each of its Related Persons, from any and all Claims and causes of action arising from or related to the Existing Securities, the Bond Claims and the Bond Resolution by each of the PSA Creditors,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Plan \u00a7 30.2(c), excluding any and all Claims and Causes of Action for gross negligence, willful misconduct and intentional fraud asserted or which can be asserted by Ambac or Whitebox in the Ambac Action and Whitebox Actions, respectively, and (b) each holder and beneficial holder of Existing Securities and their transferees, successors or assigns, from liability for all Claims and Causes of Action arising from or related to the payment by BNYM to beneficial holders of Existing Securities of regularly scheduled payments of principal and interest, excluding acts of gross negligence, intentional fraud, or willful misconduct, of BNYM, including, without limitation, any acts which have been asserted, or which could have been asserted in the Ambac Action and the Whitebox Actions,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Plan \u00a7 30.2(d);\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-260\">\n   d. the Commonwealth Agent Releasees, from liability for all Claims and Causes of Action (as if such Causes of Action were against the Commonwealth Agent Releasees) with respect to the Adversary Proceeding, the Agreement in Principle, the Settlement Agreement, the Settlement Motion and the Settlement Order,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Plan \u00a7 30.2(e); and\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-261\">\n   e. the Commonwealth, from all Claims and Causes of Action held by any Creditor, solely in such capacity.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Plan \u00a7 30.2(f).\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-262\">\n   (Exhibit DX-G.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-263\">\n   164. The consensual releases are necessary and essential to the Plan. As mentioned above, the releases have been negotiated with COFINA's key creditor constituencies as part of the formulation of the Plan. Thus, it is clear that a substantial number of creditors have expressly consented to the releases. The two third-party releases included in the Plan-in favor of the Commonwealth and BNYM-can likewise be approved. The Commonwealth has committed substantial assets to the reorganization, by funding the expenses of the Commonwealth Agent (and AAFAF) in negotiating the Plan, and in agreeing to the Settlement.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    In re Master Mortgage Investment Fund, Inc.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6524845\" index=\"53\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/br/168/930/#p934\">\n    168 B.R. 930\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 934-35 (Bankr. W.D. Mo. 1994) (enumerating various factors to be considered in approving third-party releases, including whether the non-debtor has contributed substantial assets to the reorganization). Without the release, the Commonwealth would not have agreed to the Settlement, which laid the groundwork for the formulation of this Plan. (Jaresko Decl. \u00b6 79.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-264\">\n   165. Further, it is imperative to the Plan that BNYM be released. Without a release, BNYM would attempt to withhold distributions to bondholders necessary to effectuate the Plan. Additionally, the release is narrowly tailored so that it exempts acts of gross negligence, intentional fraud, or willful misconduct, solely in the context of the Ambac Action and Whitebox Actions. (Jaresko Decl. \u00b6 80.) For these reasons, the Court finds that the third-party releases are reasonable, necessary and appropriate to implementation of the Plan and, therefore, the third-party releases are hereby approved.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-265\">\n   <strong>\n    C. Exculpation\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-266\">\n   166. Section 30.7 of the Plan contains a release and exculpation for certain parties for claims arising out of or relating to, among other things, any act taken or omitted to be taken consistent with the Plan in connection with the formulation, preparation, dissemination, implementation, acceptance, confirmation, or approval of the Plan (the \"\n   <em>\n    Exculpation Provision\n   </em>\n   \"). (Exhibit DX-G.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-267\">\n   167. Such parties greatly contributed to the Debtor's reorganization efforts and enabled the successful prosecution of the Plan in exchange, in part, for the Exculpation Provision. Failing to approve this provision would expose the parties to litigation after months of good faith negotiations. (Jaresko Decl. \u00b6 82.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-268\">\n   <strong>\n    D. Injunction\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-269\">\n   168. The injunction set forth in Sections 30.3, 30.6, and 30.11 of the Plan provides for an injunction (the \"\n   <em>\n    Injunction\n   </em>\n   \") against all Entities from commencing or continuing in any manner any suit, action, or other proceeding on account of or respecting any Claim, demand, liability, obligation, debt, right, Cause of Action, interest or remedy released or to be released pursuant to the Plan or the Confirmation Order, both prior to and after the Effective Date. The Injunction is necessary to preserve and enforce the releases and exculpations, and is narrowly tailored to achieve that purpose. (Jaresko Decl. \u00b6 83; Exhibit DX-G.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-270\">\n   169. The releases, exculpation provisions and injunctions pursuant to the Plan are integral and critical parts of the Plan and the compromises and settlements implemented pursuant to the Plan. The approval of such releases is a condition to the occurrence of the Effective Date, and all Released Parties have relied on the efficacy and conclusive effects of such releases and injunctions and on the Title III Court's retention of jurisdiction to enforce such releases and injunctions when making concessions pursuant to the Plan and by agreeing to, accepting, and supporting the settlement and treatment of their respective Claims, Causes of Action, and other rights under the Plan. Accordingly, such provisions are justified and warranted based upon the circumstances of the Title III Case and the consideration being provided by all parties in connection with the Plan.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-271\">\n   VALIDITY OF COFINA BONDS\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-272\">\n   170. On November 15, 2018, in furtherance of the Settlement, the Commonwealth validly enacted the New Bond Legislation, amending Act 91, which originally created COFINA. The New Bond Legislation is valid, and, subject to the occurrence of the Effective Date of the Plan, is binding and enforceable. The effectiveness of such legislation is subject only to the occurrence of the Effective Date.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-273\">\n   171. Confirmation of the Plan demonstrates that Puerto Rico is taking the steps necessary to enable its return to the capital markets. The restructuring of the COFINA debt under Title III of PROMESA is expected to act as a catalyst for other restructurings, setting the stage for Puerto\n   Rico's emergence from bankruptcy and reducing costly litigation.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-274\">\n   172. The Plan demonstrates Puerto Rico's continued good faith commitment to correct Puerto Rico's financial crisis, honor Puerto Rico's financial obligations, regain access to the capital markets and achieve economic certainty and debt sustainability for Puerto Rico. For their part, in exchange for the material concessions and releases provided through the Plan, COFINA's bondholders will benefit from the elimination of the previous uncertainty as to whether the property transferred to COFINA to secure their repayment nevertheless remained \"available resources\" or \"available revenues\" of the central government of Puerto Rico under the Puerto Rico Constitution. The issues that previously cast a cloud on the structure are being resolved through the Plan, rather than through \"all or nothing\" litigation.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-275\">\n   173. The Plan will quiet title to the Pledged Sales Tax Base Amount and resolve all disputes of all parties relating thereto. Moreover, the Court shall retain jurisdiction over all matters related to the COFINA Bonds to ensure compliance with the Plan.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-276\">\n   174. Confirmation of the Plan constitutes a judicial determination and, pursuant to section 4 of PROMESA and sections 944, 1123, and 1125 of the Bankruptcy Code as incorporated by section 301 of PROMESA, the terms of these Findings of Fact and Conclusions of Law shall prevail over any general or specific provisions of territory law, State law, or regulation that is inconsistent therewith and be full, final, complete, conclusive, and binding and shall not be subject to collateral attack or other challenge in any court or other forum, except as permitted under applicable law.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-277\">\n   175. COFINA is a separate covered territorial instrumentality that is legally distinct from the Commonwealth, with its own Title III case, its own certified fiscal plan, and its own plan of adjustment.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   13 L.P.R.A. \u00a7 11a(a) (\"A public corporation and instrumentality of the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico, is hereby created, which constitutes a corporate and political entity independent and separate from the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico to be known as the Corporacion del Fondo de Interes Apremiante de Puerto Rico ('COFINA'), Spanish acronym), whose name in English shall be Puerto Rico Sales Tax Financing Corporation.\"); New Bond Legislation art. 2.1 (providing that Reorganized COFINA \"shall be recognized for all purposes as an independent and separate legal entity from the Government of Puerto Rico and any other Government Entity.\").

The Plan, the Settlement, and the settlement and compromise of claims embodied in the Plan are the result of extensive arms' length negotiations among the Debtor, the Commonwealth Agent, the COFINA Agent, the Settlement Parties, and other significant Creditor constituencies, and, among other things, resolve the Commonwealth-COFINA Dispute. (Jaresko Decl. \u00b6\u00b6 15-29.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-295\">\n   178. Any attempt to confirm a Title III plan of adjustment without the compromises and settlements embodied in the Plan would have invited significant confirmation objections by various significant Creditor constituencies. (Jaresko Decl. \u00b6 45.) Without addressing the Commonwealth-COFINA Dispute, among other issues settled and compromised pursuant to the Plan, it is beyond doubt that such issues were likely to lead to further contested confirmation hearings, significant delays in confirmation of a plan, and erosion of Creditor distributions.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4200537\" index=\"57\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/br/496/644/#p664\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-296\">\n   179. The detrimental effects of further delay in confirmation and consummation of a plan of adjustment in the Title III Case cannot be underestimated. As delay in consummation of a plan would be accompanied by a continued depletion of COFINA's resources and increase in total Claims, further delay would have significantly eroded recoveries for COFINA's junior-most Creditors and stakeholders. (Jaresko Decl. \u00b6\u00b6 45, 57, 69.) Thus, it is a reasonable exercise of business judgment for the Debtor to conclude that the Plan is more likely to result in an expeditious exit from the Title III Case and prevent further deterioration of Creditors' recoveries than any alternative plan. The Court finds that the compromises and settlements embodied in the Plan are fair, reasonable, in the best interests of COFINA's stakeholders and above the lowest level of the range of reasonableness.\n   <footnotemark>\n    19\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-297\">\n   <strong>\n    H.

After the Voting Deadline passed, the Oversight Board filed the \"Third Amended Plan,\" containing minor revisions to address certain concerns raised by certain parties. (Exhibit DX-G.) None of the modifications adversely changes the treatment of the Claims of any creditor. In Article X, the Plan was amended to provide that COFINA will enter a remarketing agreement with Assured with respect to the COFINA Bonds allocable to the holders of Allowed Junior COFINA Bond Claims (Assured), and which will be received by Assured as subrogee of such holders. (Exhibit DX-G.) Assured was\n   already responsible for the 100% cash payment of the Acceleration Price to holders of Allowed Junior COFINA Bond Claims (Assured) on the Effective Date, so the holders of Claims in Class 6 are not impacted in any way by this change.

Este proyecto, al igual que el acuerdo de reestructuraci\u00f3n del Banco Gubernamental de Fomento, encamina a Puerto Rico en la ruta de la credibilidad. Con este acuerdo, hacemos ajustes significativos en el repago de la deuda gubernamental que otras administraciones tomaron prestado pero que nos toca a nosotros resolver.

Este ambiente hostil hacia Puerto Rico tambi\u00e9n reson\u00f3 en el Congreso de los Estados Unidos debido a la falta de transparencia y honestidad, generando consistentemente coberturas noticiosas negativas sobre Puerto Rico a nivel local, nacional e internacional.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-332\">\n   Las decisiones equivocadas de la pasada administraci\u00f3n llevaron al \"Estado Libre Asociado de Puerto Rico\" a la quiebra, lo que requiri\u00f3 el uso de sus recursos para atender y proveer servicios esenciales al pueblo de Puerto Rico. Esto, a su vez, actu\u00f3 como catal\u00edtico para una controversia en la cual se cuestion\u00f3 la estructura bajo la cual la Corporaci\u00f3n del Fondo del Inter\u00e9s Apremiante (COFINA) emiti\u00f3 sus bonos. En particular, algunos acreedores radicaron reclamaciones argumentando, entre otras cosas, que (i) las emisiones de bonos de COFINA violaron la Constituci\u00f3n de Puerto Rico, y (ii) la porci\u00f3n de la contribuci\u00f3n sobre ventas y uso impuesta por el Gobierno de Puerto Rico a la tasa de 5.5% (el IVU) y transferida a COFINA constituye \"recursos disponibles\" del Gobierno de Puerto Rico bajo el Art\u00edculo VI, Secci\u00f3n 8 de la Constituci\u00f3n de Puerto Rico y debe utilizarse para el pago de la \"deuda p\u00fablica\".

This bill, as well as the restructuring agreement reached with the creditors of Government Development Bank for Puerto Rico, will enhance Puerto Rico's credibility, With this agreement, we will achieve significant adjustments in the repayment of the government's debts incurred by other administrations, but that it is now our responsibility to resolve. This way, we ensure that the Government is able to continue operating and serving the people of Puerto Rico.\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-538\">\n   23\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-539\">\n   The positions assumed and actions taken by the prior administration caused Puerto Rico to lose access to the capital markets and precipitated the collapse of our public finance system. These actions accelerated the contraction of the Puerto Rico economy and increased the outmigration of residents of Puerto Rico to the United States mainland.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-540\">\n   The prior administration developed a hostile relationship with participants of the financial markets, including tens of thousands of residents of Puerto Rico that invested their savings trusting the good name and credit of the Commonwealth and that of its public corporations. This hostile environment towards Puerto Rico also pervaded the United States Congress due to the lack of transparency and honesty, while generating consistently negative news coverage for Puerto Rico at the local, national and global level,\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-541\">\n   Misguided decisions of the prior administration led to the bankruptcy of the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico and its need to gather its resources to address and provide essential services to the people of Puerto Rico. This, in turn, acted as a catalyst for a controversy that challenged the structure pursuant to which the Puerto Rico Sales Tax Financing Corporation (COFINA by its Spanish acronym) issued its bonds. In particular, certain parties asserted claims arguing, among other things, that (i) COFINA's issuance of its bonds violated the Puerto Rico Constitution and (ii) the portion of the sales and use tax imposed by the Commonwealth at a rate of 5.5% (the SUT) and transferred to COFINA constituted \"available resources\" of the Commonwealth pursuant to Article VI, Section 8, of the Puerto Rico Constitution and must be used for the payment of the Commonwealth's \"public debt.\" Certain creditors also challenged the scope of the Puerto Rico Constitution based on the whether the Spanish term \"recursos disponibles\" or the English term \"available revenues, plus surplus\" was used. On May 5, 2017, the Financial Oversight and Management Board (Oversight Board) created pursuant to the provisions of the Puerto Rico Oversight, Management and Economic Stability Act (PROMESA) commenced a proceeding as representative of COFINA under Title III.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-542\">\n   The Commonwealth's and COFINA's various stakeholders sought an orderly process to resolve the disputes relating to COFINA and the ownership of the SUT (collectively, the Commonwealth-COFINA Dispute). To that end, on August 10, 2017, the Title III Court entered a stipulation and order appointing the Commonwealth's Official Committee of Unsecured Creditors to act as agent for the Oversight Board in its capacity as representative of the Commonwealth (the Commonwealth Agent) and Bettina M. Whyte to act as agent for the Oversight Board in its capacity as representative of COFINA (the COFINA Agent) in an effort to facilitate a settlement of the Commonwealth-COFINA Dispute.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-543\">\n   On June 5, 2018, the Commonwealth Agent and the COFINA Agent announced that they had reached an agreement in principle to resolve the Commonwealth-COFINA Dispute (the Agreement in Principle). The Agreement in Principle was premised on\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-544\">\n   24\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-545\">\n   splitting the fixed amount of the SUT transferred to COFINA each fiscal year (the PSTBA) between the Commonwealth and COFINA beginning in fiscal year 2019, with COFINA receiving 53.65% of the yearly scheduled PSTBA and the Commonwealth receiving 46.35% of the yearly scheduled PSTBA plus all other revenues collected on account of the SUT.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-546\">\n   Consistent with the public policy implemented by the Governor of Puerto Rico, the Fiscal Agency and Financial Advisory Authority, the Oversight Board, and various creditors and insurers of COFINA bonds executed a plan support agreement (as amended and restated on September 21, 2018, the Plan Support Agreement), which incorporates the Agreement in Principle's PSTBA split and provides for the settlement of the Commonwealth-COFINA Dispute pursuant to a plan of adjustment for COFINA under Title III of PROMESA (the COFINA Plan).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-547\">\n   The Legislative Assembly is now called upon to implement the agreement by and among the parties of the Commonwealth-COFINA Dispute by amending the provisions of Act No. 91, which created COFINA and authorized it to issue bonds. These amendments will serve to release the lien that holders of COFINA bonds currently have over approximately $17.5 billion of previously pledged SUT revenues. These revenues will now be available for use by the Government of Puerto Rico to better serve and provide for its citizens. By implementing the Plan Support Agreement, this legislation also puts an end to the costly litigation between the agents appointed by the Oversight Board and settles the claims of COFINA's bondholders, while also making clear the original legislative intent of Act 91-2006, as amended. Moreover, as a result of this implementing legislation, we will be saving the Government of Puerto Rico approximately $437.5 million per year, which will now be available to the Government for the benefit of the people of Puerto Rico.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-548\">\n   Equally important, this legislation shows that the Legislative Assembly is determined to take the steps necessary to enable Puerto Rico's return to the capital markets. As one of the steps required to implement the Plan Support Agreement, this legislation will allow for the restructuring of the COFINA debt under Title III of PROMESA, act as a catalyst for other restructurings, setting the stage for Puerto Rico's emergence from bankruptcy, reduce costly litigation, and accelerate termination of the Oversight Board in accordance with PROMESA.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-549\">\n   This Act demonstrates the Legislative Assembly's continued public policy commitment to correct Puerto Rico's financial crisis, honor Puerto Rico's financial obligations, regain access to the capital markets, and achieve economic certainty and debt sustainability for Puerto Rico.\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-550\">\n   25\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-551\">\n   CHAPTER 1. - TITLE AND DEFINITIONS\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-552\">\n   Article 1.1.-Title.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-553\">\n   This Act shall be known as the \"Puerto Rico Sales Tax Financing Corporation Act.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-554\">\n   Article 1.2.-Definitions.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-555\">\n   The following terms shall have the meanings stated below:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-556\">\n   (a) AAFAF - means the Puerto Rico Fiscal Agency and Financial Advisory Authority.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-557\">\n   (b) Act - means Act 91-2006, as amended, also known as the Puerto Rico Sales Tax Financing Corporation Act.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-558\">\n   (c) Ancillary Agreements - means the Corporation Plan of Adjustment, the Bond Indenture, the Settlement Agreement, and any other agreement or instrument entered into by the Corporation or the Indenture Trustee in connection with, or in furtherance of, the Restructuring Transaction and in accordance with, or in furtherance of, the Corporation Plan of Adjustment.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-559\">\n   (d) Authorized Activities - means the activities authorized to be carried out by the Corporation under Article 2.4 of this Act.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-560\">\n   (e) Board of Directors - means the Board of Directors of the Corporation.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-561\">\n   (f) Bond Indenture - means one or more trust agreements, bond indentures and any supplements or amendments thereto, or similar contracts or agreements, entered into by the Corporation and the Indenture Trustee pursuant to which Plan of Adjustment Bonds are issued, and establishing the rights and responsibilities of the Corporation and of the holders of Plan of Adjustment Bonds issued thereunder.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-562\">\n   (g) Chair - means the chairperson of the Board of Directors.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-563\">\n   (h) COFINA Revenues - means the First Funds up to an amount equal to fifty-three and sixty-five one hundredths percent (53.65%) of the Fixed Income for each Fiscal Year and all legal and equitable rights, title and interest thereto (including the right to receive the First Funds as set forth under Article 4.1 of this Act).\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-564\">\n   26\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-565\">\n   (i) COFINA Revenues Fund - means the segregated fund or funds owned by the Corporation into which the COFINA Revenues are deposited (1) which account shall be held in the name of the Indenture Trustee for the benefit of the holders of the Plan of Adjustment Bonds, (2) may not be owned or controlled in any way by the Government of Puerto Rico or any Government Entity other than the Corporation, and (3) is maintained in one or more mainland U.S. banks.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-566\">\n   (j) Corporation - means the Puerto Rico Sales Tax Financing Corporation created by this Act.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-567\">\n   (k) Corporation Plan of Adjustment - means the plan of adjustment consummated in connection with the Corporation's case under Title III of PROMESA, including the order of the District Court confirming such plan of adjustment.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-568\">\n   (l) District Court - means the United States District Court for the District of Puerto Rico.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-569\">\n   (m) Effective Date - means the date on which the Corporation Plan of Adjustment becomes effective in accordance with its terms.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-570\">\n   (n) Financing Costs - means all costs associated with the Restructuring Transaction, including the costs, fees and expenses to (1) issue, service, repay or refinance the Plan of Adjustment Bonds, whether such costs are incurred upon issuance of such Plan of Adjustment Bonds or over the term of the Plan of Adjustment Bonds, (2) make payments as required by the Ancillary Agreements, (3) pay any stamp, issuance or similar taxes and other charges related to the Restructuring Transaction;

Given these circumstances, the experience and logic test does not support a finding of a First Amendment right of public access to the mediation proceedings. The objection is therefore overruled.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"14\">\n   <p id=\"p-748\">\n    The VAMOS objectors argue that a pending adversary proceeding challenging the constitutionality of the New Bond Legislation must be resolved prior to confirmation of the proposed COFINA Plan. (\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    VAMOS Obj. at 2-6.) These objectors contend that the New Bond Legislation is unconstitutional under both the United States and Puerto Rico Constitutions because Representative Natal-Albelo was prohibited, in violation of the rules of the House of Representatives, from participating in the legislative process leading up to the House of Representatives vote on the New Bond Legislation. Plaintiffs also assert that both the original COFINA legislation and the New Bond Legislation violate the Constitution of Puerto Rico because borrowing authorized thereunder allegedly exceeds the limits on \"public debt\" set forth in Sections 2 and 7 of Article VI of the Constitution of Puerto Rico (which sections respectively limit the amount and duration of direct obligations of the Commonwealth backed by a pledge of the full faith and credit and taxing power of the Commonwealth, and provide that appropriations for a fiscal year shall not exceed total estimated revenues for the year absent the imposition of taxes to cover the shortfall). Plaintiffs' arguments regarding an alleged violation of the rules of the Commonwealth House of Representatives are nonjusticiable and are therefore overruled insofar as they are raised as objections to the Plan.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    <em>\n     Noriega Rodr\u00edguez v. Jarabo\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11556540\" index=\"62\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/pr-dec/136/497/\">\n     136 D.P.R. 497\n    </extracted-citation>\n    (P.R. 1994) ;\n    <em>\n     Silva v.

Offic. Trans. 55\n    </extracted-citation>\n    (P.R. 1986). Furthermore, arguments regarding the Commonwealth's \"public debt\" limit have been resolved as part of the 9019 Settlement Agreement between the Commonwealth and COFINA insofar as they relate to the statutory authorization of the existing COFINA bonds. The New Bond Legislation, which is presumptively valid and not facially inconsistent with the cited Puerto Rico constitutional provisions, clearly provides that Reorganized COFINA is a \"corporate and political entity independent and separate from the Government of Puerto Rico,\" that Plan of Adjustment Bonds shall be payable solely from COFINA Revenues, and that the \"COFINA Revenues do not constitute 'available resources' or 'available revenues' of the Government of Puerto Rico as used in Section 8 of Article VI of the Puerto Rico Constitution.\" (Exhibit DX-QQQ \u00a7\u00a7 2.1, 2.2(e), 3.1(c).) The VAMOS objectors' objections are overruled. (\n    <em>\n     See also infra\n    </em>\n    \u00b6\u00b6 175-76.) Additionally, in its amicus brief, the PDP argues that the New Bond Legislation impermissibly restricts the ability of a successor Legislative Assembly to exercise its exclusive taxing, spending, and police powers. PDP's position is unfounded. Although the New Bond Legislation sets forth procedures that must be met before any amendments to the New Bond Legislation can become effective, the procedures do not preclude the possibility of future alterations. The New Bond Legislation merely clarifies the means by which the Legislative Assembly's taxing power may be exercised in the future without impairing COFINA's interests.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    New Bond Legislation \u00a7 3.3(b), (e). The other arguments raised in the PDP Amicus Brief are similarly unavailing.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"15\">\n   <p id=\"p-749\">\n    At least one opponent argues that the Consummation Costs are \"intended as a payoff to buy the votes of institutional bondholders and insurers.\" Mangiaracina Obj. at 3. However, no evidence of any such \"payoff\" or other illicit conduct has been presented to the Court. To the contrary, as the Court has found above, there is ample evidence that the consummation cost payments have a sound basis in law and in fact. (\n    <em>\n     See supra\n    </em>\n    \u00b6\u00b6 70-74.) The objections to the Consummation Costs payments are therefore overruled.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"16\">\n   <p id=\"p-750\">\n    The Court precluded the tender of an economist's declaration concerning future Commonwealth finances because its proponent, PROSOL-UTIER, lacks standing as a non-creditor of COFINA. (Docket Entry No. 4848 in Case No. 17-3283, January 16, 2019 Hearing Transcript, 130:8-132:11.) PROSOL-UTIER also argued that the Plan's proponents had a burden to tender expert economic evidence. The Court finds the declaration of Brownstein, an experienced municipal finance professional who participated in the formulation of the COFINA Fiscal Plan, sufficient to carry the Plan proponents' burden as to feasibility.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"17\">\n   <p id=\"p-751\">\n    Adversary Proceeding, Docket Entry No. 483,\n    <em>\n     Decision and Order\n    </em>\n    , dated May 24, 2018, at 5-6, Exhibit DX-TT (\"the Court must decide what the relevant property rights are within the context of these Title III proceedings, under PROMESA and federal bankruptcy law provisions that Congress has incorporated into PROMESA....
