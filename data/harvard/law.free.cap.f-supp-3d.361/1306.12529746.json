STAN BAKER, UNITED STATES DISTRICT JUDGE\n  </author>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   This Federal Tort Claims Act lawsuit comes before the Court on Defendant United States of America's Motion to Dismiss, (doc. 10), and Plaintiffs Jarred and Heather Lee's Request for Oral Argument, (doc. 18).\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   Plaintiffs filed a Response in Opposition to Defendant's Motion, (doc. 15), and Defendant filed a Reply, (doc. 17). This case arises out of a motor vehicle collision between Plaintiff Jarred Micah Lee's vehicle and a military service vehicle on a public highway on the Fort Stewart military reservation. The parties dispute whether the\n   <em>\n    Feres\n   </em>\n   doctrine precludes the Court from exercising jurisdiction over Plaintiffs' claims. Defendant has failed to establish that the collision arose out of or occurred in the course of activity incident to Mr. Lee's military service. Thus, Mr. Lee's claims survive Defendant's Motion. However, Plaintiff Heather Lee failed to timely exhaust her administrative remedies prior to filing this lawsuit, and, therefore, the Court lacks jurisdiction over her claims.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   For these reasons, which the Court explains more fully below, the Court\n   <strong>\n    GRANTS in part and DENIES in part\n   </strong>\n   Defendant's Motion to Dismiss, (doc. 10). The Court\n   <strong>\n    DISMISSES\n   </strong>\n   all claims of Plaintiff Heather Lee for failure to exhaust and\n   <strong>\n    DIRECTS\n   </strong>\n   the Clerk of Court to terminate her as a party to this case. The Court also\n   <strong>\n    DENIES\n   </strong>\n   Plaintiffs' Request for Oral Argument, (doc. 18).\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   <strong>\n    BACKGROUND\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   Plaintiff Jarred Micah Lee (at times \"Mr. Lee\"), and his wife, Plaintiff Heather Lynn Lee (at times \"Mrs. Lee\"), filed this action against the United States requesting damages incident to injuries that Mr. Lee sustained in a collision with a military vehicle. (Doc. 1, pp. 1-4.) Mr. Lee is a former Specialist in the United States Army and, at all times relevant to this action, Mr. Lee was on active duty at Fort Stewart Military Reservation (\"Fort Stewart\") where he resided with his wife and minor son. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) On the weekend of the accident, Mr. Lee had what is known as a \"pass.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at p. 4.) Passes are \"short, non-chargeable, authorized absence[s] from post or place of duty during normal off duty hours.\" (Doc. 17-1, p. 1.) Mr. Lee had a \"weekend pass\" and was not expected to report for duty at Fort Stewart until Monday morning, April 25, 2016. (Doc. 1, p. 4.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   Mr. Lee utilized his weekend pass on Saturday, April 23, 2016, when he left Fort Stewart in his personal vehicle to have dinner with his son. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) On the drive home, Mr. Lee and his son traveled on Georgia Highway 144 East, a public highway which traverses Fort Stewart. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) As Mr. Lee's vehicle approached the intersection of 144 East and Fort Stewart Road 58B, it collided with a military tractor-trailer driven by an active duty United States Marine. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at pp. 3-4.) Mr. Lee sustained significant injuries in the accident and was subsequently medically discharged from the Army. (Doc. 10-1, pp. 1-2.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   Plaintiffs filed this action on March 16, 2018, pursuant to the Federal Tort Claims Act,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%201346\">\n    28 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1346\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 2671\n   <em>\n    et seq.\n   </em>\n   (\"FTCA\"), alleging negligence, vicarious liability, and loss of consortium. (Doc. 1.) On May 22, 2018, Defendant filed the instant Motion to Dismiss, claiming the Court lacks subject matter jurisdiction over the claims of both Mr. and Mrs. Lee. (Doc. 10.) Defendant contends that any claims asserted by Mrs. Lee must be dismissed because she failed to exhaust her administrative remedies as required under the FTCA. (Doc. 10-1, p. 4.) As to Mr. Lee's claims, Defendant urges that such claims are barred by the\n   <em>\n    Feres\n   </em>\n   doctrine, which is described in detail below. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at p. 6.) In their Response, Plaintiffs address Defendant's arguments regarding Mr. Lee's claims and aver that the case is properly before the Court.

Motions pursuant to Rule 12(b)(1) take one of two forms: a \"facial attack\" on subject matter jurisdiction based on the complaint's allegations taken as true or a \"factual attack\" based on evidentiary matters outside of the pleadings.\n   <em>\n    McElmurray v.

In the \"factual attack\" context, the court considers whether subject matter jurisdiction tangibly exists in fact, irrespective of the complaint's allegations.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1245118\" index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/919/1525/#p1529\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   When faced with such a challenge to subject matter jurisdiction, a\n   plaintiff has the burden to prove facts which show jurisdiction exists over its claims.\n   <em>\n    OSI, Inc. v.

In deciding a fact-based motion to dismiss for lack of subject matter jurisdiction, a court may dismiss on the basis of (1) \"the complaint supplemented by undisputed facts evidenced in the record\" or (2) \"the complaint supplemented by undisputed facts plus the court's resolution of disputed facts.\"\n   <em>\n    Williamson v.

Dismissal of Plaintiff Mrs. Lee's Claims for Failure to Exhaust Administrative Remedies\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   Defendant contends that any claims brought by Mrs. Lee should be dismissed because she did not exhaust her administrative remedies as required by the FTCA,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"10\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%202675\">\n    28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2675\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a).\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   (Doc. 10-1, pp. 4-6.)

(Doc. 15-1, p. 3.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   According to Plaintiffs' Complaint, this action and all claims contained therein were brought pursuant to the FTCA. (Doc. 1, p. 1.) However, a federal court may not exercise jurisdiction over an FTCA suit unless the claimant first files an administrative claim with the appropriate agency within two years from the time the claim accrues.\n   <extracted-citation index=\"11\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%202675\">\n    28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2675\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a).

Because Mrs. Lee did\n   not satisfy the statutory prerequisites for a claim brought under the FTCA, the Court lacks jurisdiction over her claims. Accordingly, the Court\n   <strong>\n    GRANTS\n   </strong>\n   Defendant's Motion to Dismiss, (doc. 10), as to Mrs. Lee's claims and\n   <strong>\n    DISMISSES\n   </strong>\n   all claims brought by Mrs. Lee for her failure to exhaust her administrative remedies.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   <strong>\n    II.

First, as to duty status, the parties agree that Mr. Lee left Fort Stewart for dinner with his son pursuant to a weekend pass. (Doc. 10-1, p. 2; doc. 15-1, p. 1.) \"[J]ust as a serviceman on furlough may bring an action under the Federal Tort Claims Act, a soldier exercising his rights under a pass may maintain an action.\"\n   <em>\n    Pierce\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1689816,1689884\" index=\"45\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/813/349/\">\n    813 F.2d at 353\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (citations omitted). A servicemember with an \"\n   <em>\n    unexercised\n   </em>\n   right to a pass\"-meaning he had not left his post and remained engaged in service-related activities-generally may not bring such an action, but a servicemember on furlough or leave generally may.\n   <em>\n    Parker\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"470289\" index=\"46\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/611/1007/#p1013\">\n    611 F.2d at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   1013 ;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Zoula v.

In this case, Mr. Lee undisputedly left Fort Stewart to have dinner with his son. This conduct required Mr. Lee to leave his post and cease any job-related duties on the reservation, meaning he exercised his right to a pass and was accordingly under a duty status akin to leave.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Pierce\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1689816,1689884\" index=\"48\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/813/349/\">\n    813 F.2d at 350\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (\"When a serviceman ... leave[s] the base and exercise[s] the right to be absent from regular duty, the serviceman attains a status much akin to being on furlough.\"). As such, consideration of the first factor indicates that Mr. Lee was not engaged in activity incident to service at the time of the collision.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   The parties also agree that the accident occurred on a public highway within the geographic boundary of Fort Stewart.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   (Doc. 15-1, p.2.) When an injury occurs on base, it is more likely that the injured servicemember's activity was incident to his service.\n   <em>\n    Parker\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"470289\" index=\"49\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/611/1007/#p1013\">\n    611 F.2d at 1014\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Thus, at first blush it appears that the second factor weighs towards a finding that Mr. Lee was engaged in activity incident to service. However, in cases involving public highways or roads near a military base, courts have allowed FTCA actions to go forward.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ;\n   <em>\n    see, e.g.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    Pierce\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1689816,1689884\" index=\"50\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/813/349/\">\n    813 F.2d at 350, 353-54\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (finding that\n   <em>\n    Feres\n   </em>\n   did not bar a suit for injuries sustained on a public road in Fort Stewart);\n   <em>\n    Hand v.

In a situation like Mr. Lee's, where \"it is determined that the service member['s] duty status might warrant allowing the action [and the] injury occurred on the base, the court should go further and inquire into precisely what the person was doing when injured.\"\n   <em>\n    Parker\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"470289\" index=\"52\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/611/1007/#p1013\">\n    611 F.2d at 1014\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   As to the third factor, Mr. Lee's activity at the time of his injury is precisely the one addressed in\n   <em>\n    Brooks\n   </em>\n   . Like the plaintiffs in\n   <em>\n    Brooks\n   </em>\n   , Mr. Lee's personal car was struck by a military vehicle on a public highway. The\n   <em>\n    Brooks\n   </em>\n   court found that an accident under these circumstances had \"nothing to do with [the servicemember's] army career.\"\n   <em>\n    Brooks\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"572590\" index=\"53\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/337/49/\">\n    337 U.S. at 52\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"572590\" index=\"54\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/337/49/\">\n    69 S.Ct. 918\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Mr. Lee was on a pass and \"was not directly subject to military control; [ ] was not under the compulsion of military orders; [and] was not performing any military mission.\"\n   <em>\n    Parker\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"470289\" index=\"55\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/611/1007/#p1013\">\n    611 F.2d at 1014\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . The personal (as opposed to service-related) nature of Mr. Lee's activity at the time of the collision is further fortified by the fact that his son was travelling in the car with him. The fact that Mr. Lee lived on the military reservation is not dispositive-merely residing on military property \"does not mean that everything [done] in connection with his personal life can legitimately be considered activity proximately related to military service.\"\n   <em>\n    Pierce\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1689816,1689884\" index=\"56\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/813/349/\">\n    813 F.2d at 354\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . While the accident technically took place \"on base,\" the location of the accident does not change what Mr. Lee was doing at the time it occurred-operating his personal vehicle while completely relieved of military responsibilities.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Hand\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1532611\" index=\"57\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp/260/38/#p41\">\n    260 F.Supp. at 42\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (\"Even though the portion of the highway where this incident occurred is technically within the military reservation, ... the question is whether what the man was doing at the time of injury was in the course of activity incident to his military service.\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   Based on the totality of the circumstances, the Court concludes that Mr. Lee's accident was not caused by an activity incident to his service. Mr. Lee left Fort Stewart with his son pursuant to his weekend pass, was not expected to perform any military functions until the following Monday morning, and was driving his personal vehicle on a public road that passed through the reservation. Though the accident technically occurred within the reservation, operating a motor vehicle while relieved of any militarily assigned tasks is not an \"activity materially related to military service.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    8\n   </footnotemark>\n   <em>\n    Pierce\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1689816,1689884\" index=\"58\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/813/349/\">\n    813 F.2d at 354\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Because Mr. Lee was not injured in a service-related activity, this Court has subject matter jurisdiction over his claims and the case may proceed under the authority of\n   <em>\n    Brooks\n   </em>\n   .
