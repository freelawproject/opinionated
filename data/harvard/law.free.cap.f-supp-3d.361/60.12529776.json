MOSS, United States District Judge\n  </author>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   This action, brought by three organizations challenging an Executive Order and related guidance issued by the Office of Management and Budget (\"OMB\"), is before the Court for a second time. In a prior decision, the Court concluded that Plaintiffs had not met their threshold burden of\n   alleging or otherwise proffering facts sufficient to establish that they have Article III standing to sue.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Pub. Citizen, Inc. v. Trump\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12524065\" index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/297/6/#p40\">\n    297 F.Supp.3d 6\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 40 (D.D.C. 2018) (\"\n   <em>\n    Pub. Citizen I\n   </em>\n   \"). The Court therefore dismissed the action. In response, and with leave of the Court, Plaintiffs filed an amended complaint, Dkt. 64, and they have now moved for partial summary judgment on the sole issue of their standing, Dkt. 71. Defendants, for their part, contend that nothing has changed, and they have renewed their motion to dismiss for lack of standing. Dkt. 70.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   The Court concludes that Plaintiffs have now met their burden of plausibly alleging that they have standing to sue. That is all they need to do to survive a Rule 12(b)(1) motion to dismiss that poses a facial challenge to the Court's jurisdiction. It is not all that they need to do, however, to prevail on their motion for partial summary judgment. To carry the more onerous burden applicable on summary judgment, Plaintiffs must show that there is no genuine dispute of material fact regarding their standing to sue. As the Court explains below, they have not done so.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   Establishing standing in a case like this one is no easy task.\n   <em>\n    Pub. Citizen I\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12524065\" index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/297/6/#p40\">\n    297 F.Supp.3d at 21\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . To be sure, one need only read the Executive Order to understand that it is designed to constrain the ability of federal agencies to issue new regulations and to create incentives for those agencies to rescind existing regulations. Likewise, one need only read the Unified Agenda of Regulatory and Deregulatory Actions (\"Unified Agenda\") to understand that many proposed rules have failed to advance or have been withdrawn since the Executive Order was issued. What is far less clear, however, is whether the Executive Order-as opposed to a more general change in policy between administrations-is the cause of this decline in regulatory activity.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   The hurdle that Plaintiffs face in attempting to establish a causal link between the Executive Order and an injury sufficient to sustain their standing is heightened, moreover, by three factors. First, the operation of the Executive Order is not transparent. The government has not disclosed, and there is no process for disclosing, whether the Executive Order has, in fact, precluded or delayed the finalization of any proposed rule. To contrary, although the administration has reported, in general, on its efforts to reduce regulation, it has yet to identify any proposed regulation that would have been adopted but for the Executive Order. Second, the Court must \"avoid any undue intrusion on the discretion of the Executive Branch to set policy priorities.\"\n   <em>\n    Pub. Citizen I\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12524065\" index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/297/6/#p40\">\n    297 F.Supp.3d at 25\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . It is not the Court's role to decide which proposed regulations should, or should not, be adopted, nor is it the Court's role, absent a statutory directive, to set a timetable for an agency to act. Third, even assuming the Executive Order has precluded or delayed the finalization of proposed regulations, Plaintiffs still bear the burden of demonstrating that they or their members have been or will likely be injured by the government's failure to regulate. It is relatively easy to establish standing when you are the regulated party; it is more difficult to do so when the government fails to regulate the conduct of someone else.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.,\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Arpaio v. Obama\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6771912,4332161\" index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/797/11/\">\n    797 F.3d 11\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 20 (D.C. Cir. 2015).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   But the existence of these hurdles does not mean that Plaintiffs' task is impossible. As detailed in\n   <em>\n    Public Citizen I\n   </em>\n   and explained further below, Plaintiffs have marshalled a multitude of examples of proposed regulatory actions that have failed to move forward since the Executive Order was issued, a number of which have moved from the \"Final Rule Stage\" to the \"Long-Term Actions\" section of the Unified Agenda. They have identified executive branch statements and logical inferences\n   that support their claims of delay. And, they have filed numerous declarations in an effort to demonstrate that they, or their members, have suffered redressable injuries due to those delays. All told, they have now made out a plausible claim to standing.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   There is a significant difference, however, between establishing a plausible claim to standing and showing that Plaintiffs, in fact, have standing to sue. With respect to that more demanding burden, Plaintiffs have not cleared the substantial hurdles they face. They have not yet met-and ultimately may be unable to meet-their burden of proving that the Executive Order, as opposed to separate policy considerations or other factors, has delayed the issuance of a specific regulation, which would have otherwise issued, and that the resulting delay has caused them, or their members, to suffer a redressable injury. This leaves the case in an unfortunate state of incertitude: Plaintiffs have done enough to stay afloat but not enough to move forward.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   The Court must, accordingly, deny the government's motion to dismiss, Dkt. 70, but must also deny Plaintiffs' motion for partial summary judgment, Dkt. 71. The parties may renew their motions following the development of a further factual record. Finally, because the Court's subject matter jurisdiction remains in doubt, the Court must deny the motion of the States of California and Oregon to intervene, Dkt. 73, as premature.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   <strong>\n    I. BACKGROUND\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   <strong>\n    A. Executive Order 13771 and OMB Guidance\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   The Court described Executive Order 13771 and OMB's implementing guidance in its prior opinion,\n   <em>\n    Pub. Citizen I\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12524065\" index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/297/6/#p40\">\n    297 F.Supp.3d at 13-15\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , and will provide only a brief overview here. Executive Order 13771, entitled \"Reducing Regulation and Controlling Regulatory Costs,\" imposes three new restrictions on the authority of agencies to adopt or to propose new regulations: a \"two for one\" requirement, an \"offset\" requirement, and an \"annual cap\" on the net costs of private compliance with covered regulations. Exec. Order No. 13771,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=82%20Fed.%20Reg.%209339\">\n    82 Fed. Reg. 9339\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (Jan. 30, 2017). Under the \"two for one\" requirement, \"whenever an executive department or agency ... publicly proposes for notice and comment or otherwise promulgates a new regulation,\" the agency must \"identify at least two existing regulations to be repealed.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"6\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=82%20Fed.%20Reg.%209339\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 2(a). This requirement works in tandem with the \"offset\" requirement, which requires agencies to offset \"any new incremental cost associated with new regulations\" by eliminating \"existing costs associated with at least two prior regulations.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"7\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=82%20Fed.%20Reg.%209339\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 2(c). Finally, the \"annual cap\" provision works in the aggregate and prohibits agencies from adopting new regulations that exceed their \"total incremental cost allowance\" for the year-a cap based on the costs of any new regulations adopted in the relevant year, less any cost savings achieved through the repeal of existing regulations.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"8\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=82%20Fed.%20Reg.%209339\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 3(d). The cap must be reset every year by the Director of OMB,\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"9\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=82%20Fed.%20Reg.%209339\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 3(d), who set the total at zero for fiscal year 2017,\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"10\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=82%20Fed.%20Reg.%209339\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 2(b), and from zero to negative $ 196 million, depending on the agency, for fiscal year 2018.

Similar provisos appear within particular provisions.\n   <em>\n    See\n    <extracted-citation index=\"11\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=82%20Fed.%20Reg.%209339\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 2(a) (two-for-one requirement applies \"[u]nless prohibited by law\");\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"12\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=82%20Fed.%20Reg.%209339\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 2(c) (offset requirement applies \"to the extent permitted by law\" and any elimination of costs must comport \"with the Administrative Procedure Act and other applicable law\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   The Director of OMB is charged with fleshing out the Executive Order's requirements and exceptions. OMB issued interim guidance on February 2, 2017 and final guidance on April 5, 2017.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Office of Mgmt. &amp; Budget, Interim Guidance Implementing Section 2 of the Executive Order of January 30, 2017 (2017) (\"Interim Guidance\");\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   Office of Mgmt. &amp; Budget, Guidance Implementing Executive Order 13771 (2017) (\"Final Guidance\").\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   These guidance documents (collectively \"OMB Guidance\") clarified the Executive Order in several respects.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   First, OMB explained that the Executive Order applies only to \"significant regulatory action[s]\" and \"significant guidance document[s],\" Final Guidance, Q &amp; A 2-that is, actions or guidance documents likely to \"[h]ave an annual effect on the economy of $ 100 million or more\" or to meet other criteria. Exec. Order No. 12866 \u00a7 3(f), 3 C.F.R. 638 (1994). Covered deregulatory actions, in contrast, need not qualify as \"significant\" and thus take a \"wide[r] range\" of forms than regulatory actions. Final Guidance, Q &amp; A 4.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   Second, unlike prior executive orders,\n   <em>\n    cf.\n   </em>\n   Exec. Order No. 12866, Executive Order 13771 focuses only on compliance costs borne by regulated parties, without regard to the public benefit of the existing or proposed rule.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Final Guidance, Q &amp; A 21, 32; Interim Guidance at 4. In calculating costs and savings for purposes of the Executive Order, agencies are required to determine the present value of the costs or savings of the regulatory or deregulatory action \"over the full duration of the expected effects of the action[ ].\" Final Guidance, Q &amp; A 25. An agency's \"total incremental cost\" for a fiscal year \"means the sum of all costs from\" significant regulatory actions and guidance documents \"minus the cost savings from ... deregulatory actions.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"13\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=82%20Fed.%20Reg.%209339\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   , Q &amp; A 8.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   Third, the Executive Order recognizes that certain federal statutes prohibit agencies from considering costs in determining whether a significant regulatory action is warranted. With respect to those regulatory actions, the OMB Guidance acknowledges that the Executive Order cannot-and does not-\"change the agency's obligations under [such a] statute.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"14\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=82%20Fed.%20Reg.%209339\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   , Q &amp; A 18. But, agencies implementing these statutes are still \"generally ... required to offset the costs of such regulatory actions through other deregulatory actions taken pursuant to statutes that do not prohibit consideration of costs.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"15\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=82%20Fed.%20Reg.%209339\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   Likewise, if an agency faces an imminent statutory or judicial deadline for taking a regulatory action, the Executive Order \"does not prevent\" the agency from taking the regulatory action in a timely manner, even if it cannot first satisfy the requirements of the Executive Order.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"16\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=82%20Fed.%20Reg.%209339\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   , Q &amp; A 33. The agency must, however, \"offset [the]\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   regulatory action[ ] as soon as practicable thereafter.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"17\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=82%20Fed.%20Reg.%209339\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   Fourth, agencies are permitted to \"bank\" cost savings and deregulatory actions \"for use in the same or a subsequent fiscal year\" to offset significant regulatory actions or guidance documents and to meet their \"total incremental cost allowance[s].\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"18\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=82%20Fed.%20Reg.%209339\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   , Q &amp; A 29. This means, for example, that an agency that takes four deregulatory actions in fiscal year 1 may take two covered regulatory actions in year 1 or in future years, or that an agency that \"issues two ... deregulatory actions with total cost savings of $ 200 million\" and a \"regulatory action with a cost of $ 150 million\" in fiscal year 1, \"may bank the surplus cost savings of $ 50 million to offset the costs of another ... regulatory action\" in a future fiscal year.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"19\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=82%20Fed.%20Reg.%209339\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   Finally, neither the Executive Order nor the OMB Guidance provides a mechanism for notifying the public whether and when a proposed (or possible) regulatory action might be delayed or abandoned due to the requirements of the Executive Order.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Dkt. 56 at 64 (Tr. Oral Arg. 64:7-22) (Counsel for Defendants: \"I suspect [that information on delayed or abandoned regulatory actions] will not be public.\"). Moreover, although the Executive Order requires that agencies identify offsetting deregulatory actions as a\n   <em>\n    condition\n   </em>\n   of taking new regulatory actions, the OMB Guidance precludes agencies from relying on the Executive Order \"as the\n   <em>\n    basis or rationale\n   </em>\n   , in whole or in part, for\" taking a deregulatory action, and the guidance does not require that agencies publicly identify the \"offsetting ... deregulatory actions\" that allow for the regulation.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Final Guidance, Q &amp; A 37 (emphasis added). Similarly, although the Unified Agenda\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   should \"include, to the extent practicable, ... deregulatory actions that ... are sufficient to offset [any] regulatory actions,\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"20\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=82%20Fed.%20Reg.%209339\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   , the Unified Agenda merely designates certain actions as \"deregulatory\" pursuant to the Executive Order, without providing additional information about whether those actions were taken to comply with the Executive Order or for independent policy reasons.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Office of Mgmt. &amp; Budget,\n   <em>\n    Introduction to the Unified Agenda of Federal Regulatory and Deregulatory Actions-Fall 2018.\n   </em>\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   As a result, neither the Executive Order nor the OMB Guidance provides a mechanism for notifying interested parties that an otherwise desirable regulation is being delayed\n   or withheld in order to comply with the Executive Order or that a deregulatory action was initiated in order to comply with the Executive Order.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   <strong>\n    B. Procedural History\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   Plaintiffs Public Citizen, Inc., Natural Resources Defense Council, Inc. (\"NRDC\"), and the Communication Workers of America, AFL-CIO (\"CWA\") filed this action against the President, the Director of OMB, the heads of thirteen federal agencies, and the United States in February 2017, alleging that Executive Order 13771\"impose[s] rulemaking requirements beyond and in conflict with the requirements of the\" Administrative Procedure Act (\"APA\") and \"the statutes from which ... federal agencies derive their rulemaking authority.\" Dkt. 1 at 5-6 (Compl. \u00b6 9). Plaintiffs alleged that the Executive Order (1) exceeds the President's authority under Article II of the Constitution and usurps Congress's power to legislate; (2) conflicts with the President's duty to execute legislation under the Take Care Clause; and (3) directs federal agencies to take actions that are ultra vires.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 43-46 (Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 121-47). They further allege that the OMB Guidance (4) is ultra vires; and (5) violates the APA.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 46-48 (Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 148-61).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   After Plaintiffs filed suit, the government moved to dismiss the complaint for lack of standing and for failure to state a claim, Dkt. 9, and fourteen states filed an amicus brief in support of the government addressing the merits of the dispute, Dkt. 12. In response, Plaintiffs filed an amended complaint as of right, which, among other things, added further allegations relating to their standing to sue.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Dkt. 14 (First Am. Compl.). The government then renewed its motion to dismiss, Dkt. 15, and Plaintiffs cross-moved for summary judgment, Dkt. 16. In opposing Defendants' motion to dismiss and in seeking summary judgment, Plaintiffs relied on theories of both associational and organizational standing.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   The Court first addressed associational standing, which at the motion to dismiss stage requires that the plaintiff association \"plausibly allege or otherwise offer facts sufficient to permit the reasonable inference (1) that the plaintiff has at least one member who 'would otherwise have standing to sue in [her] own right;' (2) that 'the interests' the association 'seeks to protect are germane to [its] purpose;' and (3) that 'neither the claim asserted not the relief requested requires the participation of [the] individual members in the lawsuit.' \"\n   <em>\n    Pub.

As the Court explained, because the Plaintiffs could not plausibly allege that the delay in finalizing the regulatory actions at issue would\n   <em>\n    certainly\n   </em>\n   cause their members injury, they could plead only that that the identified individuals might someday suffer an injury based on the\n   <em>\n    increase in risk\n   </em>\n   due to the regulatory delay.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 21. In order to satisfy\n   <em>\n    Lujan\n   </em>\n   's requirements of causation, redressability, and injury-in-fact, Plaintiffs therefore had to show \"that the relevant agency intended to issue the regulation in question;\" \"that Executive Order 13771 will likely cause the agency to delay issuance of the regulation;\" \"that-with the relevant period of delay taken into account-an identified member of one of the associations will face a substantial probability of a concrete injury;\" and, finally, \"that the period of delay attributable to the Executive Order will substantially increase that risk of harm.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 22. Although Plaintiffs identified \"over a dozen putative regulatory actions\" that might be (or might have been) \"delayed, weakened, or barred\" because of the Executive Order\n   or OMB Guidance,\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 18, the Court concluded that Plaintiffs had failed to show that at least one of their members would otherwise have standing to sue in her own right,\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 35. With respect to some of the identified regulatory actions, Plaintiffs failed to identify particular members who would likely be harmed.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 18-19. With respect to others, they failed to allege facts or otherwise to show that the relevant agency was likely to have issued the particular rule absent the Executive Order.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 25-28. And, with respect to yet others, they failed \"plausibly to allege or otherwise to show that any delay in the regulatory action attributable to the Executive Order [would] substantially increase the risk that any of their members [would] be harmed or that any of their members [would] face a substantial probability of harm once such an increase in risk [was] taken into account.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 12 (emphasis omitted).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   The Court was also unconvinced by Plaintiffs' contention that they had organizational standing, that is, standing to sue in their own right as institutions.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 40. Plaintiffs argued that the trade-off demanded by the Executive Order-requiring that agencies rescind at least two regulations for every new regulatory action-would chill their advocacy efforts.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 35.

It does not dispute, for example, that it would take decades for the Department of Transportation to accrue sufficient cost savings to pay for the rule, and it does not assert that it is no longer convinced, as a matter of policy, that the rule is a good idea. Instead, it points to a statement that the Department of Transportation issued on November 8, 2017, and argues that, in light of that statement, \"Plaintiffs cannot demonstrate that [the Department of Transportation] intends to issue a final rule, or that such a rule is being delayed by Executive Order 13,771.\" Dkt. 70-1 at 23-24.

Dkt. 70-1 at 23-24 (quoting V2V Statement). That language may well support the government's view that the Department is considering whether to issue the rule (and, if so, what revisions are appropriate) without regard to the limits imposed on significant, new regulatory action by the Executive Order. But it reads too much into the statement to conclude that it renders Plaintiffs' jurisdictional allegations implausible. The Department, for example, might just as well be taking its time in considering the 460 comments because it knows that the Executive Order will, in any event, preclude issuance of the rule anytime soon. Likewise, the Executive Order and the availability (or unavailability) of regulatory offsets may just as well be the \"other relevant new information\" that will \"inform\" the Department's \"next steps.\"\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   V2V Statement. Finally, the statement was issued almost fifteen months ago, and, although the Department promised to provide an \"update ... at the appropriate time,\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12524065\" index=\"107\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/297/6/#p40\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   , it did not promise to provide notice as soon as it completed the review of the comments. In short, although the government\n   <em>\n    might\n   </em>\n   be correct, the statement is not nearly as definitive as the government suggests.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-67\">\n   It has now been almost twenty-two months since the comment period on the proposed rule closed, and the regulatory agenda continues to reflect that the rule is on the list of items for \"[l]ong-[t]erm [a]ction\" with an \"[u]ndetermined\" date for any further action. Fall 2018 Agenda. Although it is possible that the Department is simply engaged in a detailed review of the comments it has received, the Court adheres to its prior conclusion that Plaintiffs have plausibly alleged that the delay is due, at least in part, to Executive Order 13771. It is also possible that the Department will engage in a massive deregulatory action, sufficient to offset the estimated cost of $ 2 billion or more each year for the first several years the V2V rule is in effect or that another agency will transfer sufficient cost savings to the Department of Transportation. And, it is possible that OMB will waive the regulatory cap in order to permit the rulemaking to proceed. But, as the record now stands, it appears that the Executive Order currently precludes issuance of the rule, raising the plausible inference that the Department is not rushing to finalize a rule that it will not be permitted to issue. If that inference is incorrect, the government can rebut it after the parties are provided an opportunity for further factual development.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-68\">\n   (iii)\n   <em>\n    Adequacy of Plaintiffs' allegations of injury\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-69\">\n   Finally, the government argues that Plaintiffs' allegations and declarations do not plausibly allege or otherwise show that Fleming or Weissman are likely to suffer a non-speculative and redressable injury due to any delay in finalizing the V2V rule. In particular, according to the government, Fleming and Weissman will be able to purchase V2V-equipped vehicles even if the rule is not finalized; their plans to purchase new vehicles with V2V technology years from now are too speculative to support standing; and that their injuries, if any, are not redressable. The Court is unconvinced.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-70\">\n   The government first contends that Fleming and Weissman have not suffered, and will not suffer, any concrete injury because they will be able to purchase V2V-equipped vehicles, \"regardless of whether DOT issues a final V2V rule.\" Dkt. 70-1 at 25- 26. For support, the government points to two news stories, one from March 2017 reporting that \"Cadillac [had] introduce[d] ...

Although recognizing that the plaintiffs might have met their burden had they shown that the agency action made \"thimerosal-free alternatives\n   <em>\n    difficult to obtain\n   </em>\n   ,\" the court stressed that the plaintiffs did not even meet this modest burden; to the contrary, the plaintiffs acknowledged \"that thimerosal-free vaccines [were] readily available.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3732370,3769877\" index=\"110\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/671/1275/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3732370,3769877\" index=\"110\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/671/1275/\">\n    at 1282\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Under those circumstances, the D.C. Circuit held that the plaintiffs lacked standing. Even assuming for present purposes that the cited press reports constitute competent evidence, however, the Court is unconvinced that the reports or\n   <em>\n    Coalition for Mercury-Free Drugs\n   </em>\n   rebut Plaintiffs' claim to standing.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-72\">\n   This case differs from\n   <em>\n    Coalition for Mercury-Free Drugs\n   </em>\n   in a number of important respects. First, and foremost, the product that Plaintiffs seek here-V2V-equipped vehicles-is fundamentally different from thimerosal-free vaccines. Unlike thimerosal-free vaccines, the value of the technology at issue here turns on its employment in as many vehicles as possible. To be sure, there might be\n   <em>\n    some\n   </em>\n   value in a technology that prevents accidents between Cadillac CTS sedans and Toyota and Lexus vehicles. But that limited benefit falls far short of the objective of the rule, and it renders the technology included in those vehicles far less attractive.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-73\">\n   Significantly, the products that Fleming and Weissman would like to purchase are not simply vehicles or even vehicles equipped with V2V technology, but vehicles that are capable of communicating with most, if not all, other light vehicles on the road. Nothing the government has offered suggests that Fleming and Weissman-or anyone else-will be able to purchase cars with that capability.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-74\">\n   The Court, moreover, need not assess the potential availability of a desired product in a vacuum. Under prevailing D.C.

Here, although the administrative record is not yet complete, NHTSA's most recent pronouncement mirrors Plaintiffs' claims. According to the notice of proposed rulemaking:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-75\">\n   Despite the[ ] potential benefits, V2V offers challenges that are not present[ed] [by independent safety technologies such as radar and camera systems]. Without government action, these challenges could prevent this promising safety technology from achieving sufficiently widespread use\n   <em>\n    throughout the vehicle fleet\n   </em>\n   to achieve these benefits. Most prominently, vehicles need to communicate a standard set of information to each other, using interoperable communications that all vehicles can understand.... Without interoperability, manufacturers attempting to implement V2V will find that their vehicles are not necessarily able to communicate with other manufacturers' vehicles and equipment, defeating the objective of the mandate and stifling the potential for innovation that the new information environment can create. In addition, there is the issue of achieving\n   <em>\n    critical mass\n   </em>\n   : That V2V can only begin to provide significant safety benefits when\n   <em>\n    a significant fraction of vehicles comprising the fleet\n   </em>\n   can transmit and receive the same information in an interoperable fashion.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-76\">\n   The improvement in safety that results from enabling vehicles to communicate with one another depends directly on the fraction of the vehicle fleet that is equipped with the necessary technology, and on its ability to perform reliably.... Because\n   <em>\n    the value to potential buyers of purchasing a vehicle that is equipped with V2V communications technology depends upon how many other vehicle owners have also purchased comparably-equipped models\n   </em>\n   , V2V communications has many of the same characteristics as more familiar network communications technologies.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-77\">\n   * * *\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-78\">\n   ...

Reg. at 3856 (emphasis added). Based on all of this, the notice of proposed rulemaking concluded that, \"[w]ithout government intervention, the resulting uncertainty could undermine manufacturer plans or weaken manufacturers' incentive to develop V2V technology to its full potential.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   That is precisely Plaintiffs' point, and nothing contained in either of the press reports that the government now cites undermines NHTSA's prior statement.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-80\">\n   The government's reliance on\n   <em>\n    Coalition for Mercury-Free Drugs\n   </em>\n   is unavailing for a\n   second reason as well. In that case, the agency's action did not limit the choices available to consumers. There was no suggestion that, with the exception of the preservative, the vaccines on the market differed in any material respect from one another. Against that backdrop, the D.C. Circuit held that the plaintiffs lacked standing to challenge the FDA's approval of thimerosal-containing vaccines because the FDA's action did not \"prevent[ ] [the association's members and individual plaintiffs] from purchasing thimerosal-free vaccines altogether,\" and the plaintiffs did \"not allege that mercury-free vaccines [were] 'not readily available' \" or that those vaccines were \"unreasonably priced.\"\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3732370,3769877\" index=\"114\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/671/1275/\">\n    671 F.3d at 1281-82\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . That scenario bears little resemblance to the facts of this case, at least as the record now stands. Without the V2V rule, Fleming and Weissman will only be able to purchase a Cadillac CTS sedan, Toyota, or Lexus. Thus, unlike the consumers in\n   <em>\n    Coalition for Mercury-Free Drugs\n   </em>\n   , who were able to purchase just what they wanted at a reasonable price, Fleming and Weissman's choices will be significantly curtailed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-81\">\n   As a result, this case is more like\n   <em>\n    Consumer Federation of America\n   </em>\n   , where the D.C.

Moreover, even though the value of owning a V2V-equipped vehicle will not be fully realized for years to come, the alleged harm under the purchaser theory of standing is not the realization of the maximum safety benefit but the ability to purchase the desired product-even before it attains its maximum utility.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-85\">\n   The government also argues that \"numerous contingencies outside of its control ... could delay the installation of V2V technology, such as public rejection of the product and the possibility that a court might enjoin the rule.\" Dkt. 70-1 at 27 n.9. That argument, however, turns the concept of undue speculation on its head. To be sure, it is always possible that a regulation might be enjoined or that members of the public might ask the agency to rescind a mandate. The question for present purposes, however, is simply whether Plaintiffs have plausibly alleged or otherwise shown that they have standing, and they have met that burden.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-86\">\n   Finally, the government contends that Plaintiffs have not plausibly alleged that overturning of the Executive Order would redress Fleming and Weissman's injuries. Dkt. 70-1 at 29-30. As is often the case in standing analysis, this argument is simply the flip side of the government's contention that Plaintiffs have not plausibly alleged that the Executive Order has delayed the issuance of the V2V rule.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Carpenters Indus.

Thus, to the extent that Plaintiffs have plausibly alleged that NHTSA has not issued a final V2V rule because the Department of Transportation has yet to accrue sufficient cost savings to offset the cost of the rule under the Executive Order, it does not require a substantial leap to conclude that they have also plausibly alleged that invalidating the Executive Order would redress the injuries they allege. \"Article III does not demand a demonstration that victory in court will without doubt cure the identified injury,\"\n   <em>\n    Teton Historic Aviation Found. v.

For present purposes, as in\n   <em>\n    Public Citizen I\n   </em>\n   , the government does not dispute that Plaintiffs\n   satisfy the second and third criteria, and the Court agrees. The question, accordingly, once again comes down to whether Plaintiffs have demonstrated that at least one of their members would have standing to sue in her own right.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-94\">\n   To meet that burden, Plaintiffs now identify five putative regulatory measures that they contend have been delayed or withdrawn due to Executive Order 13771, to the detriment of one or more of their members. The Court will consider each of these measures in turn and, as to each, will consider whether Plaintiffs have shown-beyond genuine dispute-(1) that at least one of their members has sustained, or faces the imminent threat of sustaining, an \"injury-in-fact\" that is neither \"conjectural\" nor \"hypothetical;\" (2) that a \"causal connection\" exists between the Executive Order and that injury, such that the injury is \"fairly trace[able] to the\" Executive Order or OMB Guidance \"and [is] not the result of the independent action of some third party;\" and (3) that the injury would \"likely\" be redressed \"by a favorable decision.\"\n   <em>\n    Lujan\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11730070\" index=\"153\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/504/555/#p561\">\n    504 U.S. at 560\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11730070\" index=\"154\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/504/555/#p561\">\n    112 S.Ct. 2130\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . A failure to satisfy any one of these \"irreducible constitutional\" requirements for Article III standing will preclude granting Plaintiffs' motion for partial summary judgment. As the Court explains below, each one of the putative rules suffers from one or more deficiencies, disputes, or difficulties that precludes the entry of summary judgment on the present record. The Court will limit its analysis to the most evident challenges posed by each of the putative regulatory measures Plaintiffs identify.\n   <footnotemark>\n    11\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-95\">\n   (i)\n   <em>\n    V2V Proposed Rule\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-96\">\n   Plaintiffs' contention that they have established associational standing based on the injuries that Fleming and Weissman will allegedly sustain due to the delay in finalizing the V2V rule does not\n   require much analysis beyond that set forth above. As already explained, Plaintiffs have plausibly alleged that the Executive Order has injured, and will continue to injure, Fleming and Weissman by delaying issuance of a final V2V rule and thereby interfering with their plans to purchase and use V2V-equipped vehicles several years from now. They have not, however, shown that this asserted \"causal connection\"-and, by extension, the redressability of their asserted injuries-is beyond genuine dispute. To the contrary, the government plausibly contends that the delay in finalizing the rule is the product of \"the kind of run-of-the-mill evaluation of a propose rule that often results in additional consideration and, at times, a decision to take a different substantive approach.\" Dkt. 75 at 12. In short, Plaintiffs have presented evidence that the Executive Order has delayed finalization of the rule, but that evidence is disputed, and the government has done more than offer an unsupported denial.

Although almost a year has passed since the comment period for the RFI closed, the Court cannot conclude that Plaintiffs have established beyond genuine dispute that issuance of a proposed rule, much less a final rule, has been delayed by the Executive Order or the OMB Guidance. To the contrary, as the Court discussed in\n   <em>\n    Public Citizen I\n   </em>\n   , almost seven years passed from the time OSHA issued an RFI on infectious diseases to the time it planned to\n   issue a proposed rule, and that far more substantial delay occurred before the Executive Order was adopted.\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12524065\" index=\"169\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/297/6/#p40\">\n    297 F.Supp.3d at 24\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Even assuming that seven years is well out of the ordinary, the Court cannot conclude on the present record that the passage of time since the workplace violence RFI comment period closed, even when considered in light of when the Executive Order was issued and in light of the regulatory pronouncements upon which Plaintiffs rely, is sufficient to establish beyond genuine dispute that the Executive Order has delayed issuance of a proposed workplace violence rule.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-108\">\n   Plaintiffs face another hurdle as well.

The Department's most recent annual cost estimate for the proposed rule of $ 42.6\n   <em>\n    million\n   </em>\n   , 81 Fed.

Although Plaintiffs argue that the two-year period has now passed, it is far from clear that either the Executive Order or OMB Guidance is to blame.

Although the Court need not-and cannot-resolve that factual issue on the present record, it appears that the delay is more likely the product of disagreement about the substance of the proposed rule. Moreover, as with the residential cooking products standard, Plaintiffs' contention that the Department was required by statute to issue a final rule in or before April 2018 does little to advance their position. As explained above, the OMB Guidance provides that such a statutory requirement must be observed, notwithstanding the Executive Order. It is, of course, possible that the Department is nonetheless reluctant to issue the final rule because its cost might prevent the Department from taking other, possibly higher priority actions. But that possibility, at this point, is both speculative and at odds with the evidence that the Department remains engaged in an effort to assess the proposed rule on the merits.

As they argued during the last round of briefing, Plaintiff contend that the Executive Order and OMB Guidance have put them to \"an untenable choice\"-either to urge agencies \"to adopt new regulations, when adopting those regulations would depend on the repeal of existing regulatory safeguards\" that they support, or to \"refrain[ ] from advocating for new public protections to avoid triggering the need to repeal existing ones.\" Dkt. 71 at 46-47. According to Plaintiffs, this dilemma undermines their ability to pursue their respective missions of advocating for health and safety, consumer protection, the environment, and improved working conditions, and, as a result, the Executive Order and OMB Guidance are causing Plaintiffs a cognizable and redressable injury in fact.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-121\">\n   The Court rejected this theory of standing in\n   <em>\n    Public Citizen I\n   </em>\n   for two reasons.

Specifically, she attests that \"NRDC has decided not to petition EPA for new drinking water standards for contaminants including PFOA and PFOS, microcystins,\n   and legionella\" because, if \"NRDC's petition were to succeed[,] EPA would have to repeal two or more existing regulations to offset costs, which would likely undermine other health protections and harm NRDC's members.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 2-3 (Wu Decl. \u00b6 7).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-123\">\n   Little turns on the adequacy of this factual proffer, however, because the Court remains convinced that its alternative holding is both sound and sufficient.\n   <footnotemark>\n    17\n   </footnotemark>\n   For present purposes, Plaintiffs do not press the point but, rather, merely preserve the question \"for possible appeal.\" Dkt. 71 at 47.

The states of California and Oregon have moved to intervene as of right under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 24(a) or, in the alternative, for permissive intervention under Rule 24(b). Dkt. 73. According to the proposed intervenors, they \"have unique interests in the health and well-being of their citizens, natural resources, infrastructure, institutions, and economies, among other things, and these interests cannot be adequately represented by the NGO Plaintiffs.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 19. In support of their motion, the proposed intervenors have also filed a request for judicial notice of seven publications (in either full or excerpted form) \"downloaded from the websites of California, Oregon, and the United States government agencies,\" Dkt. 81 at 5, which purportedly support their claim of standing. The government opposes the intervention,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Dkt. 77, but has not taken a position with respect to the request for judicial notice. The Court will therefore grant the request for judicial notice. But, because this Court's jurisdiction remains in doubt for the reasons discussed above, the Court must deny the States' motion to intervene as premature.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-132\">\n   \"The general rule is that '[i]ntervention presupposes the pendency of an action in a court of competent jurisdiction.' \"\n   <em>\n    Aeronautical Radio, Inc. v.

Third, most of the evidence that Plaintiffs have offered, and which they cite in their statement of undisputed material fact, is the same regulatory materials that the government does address in its briefs.
