Instead, they suggest that Commerce abused its discretion by using that test when a different test would have supported a different result. In order to challenge Commerce's methodology for conducting its cost test, Plaintiffs must show that the agency's methodology was unreasonable.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Whirlpool Corp. v.

Plaintiffs' challenge fails in that regard. The fact that Plaintiffs' alternative methodology would have achieved a different result is insufficient to suggest that Commerce's methodology, consistently applied for at least a decade and rooted in International Financial Reporting Standards, is unreasonable.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   I &amp; D Mem. at 15 and nn.57-58. As Commerce explained, its test examines, in the first instance, the total cost of manufacture because \"it accounts for all production costs, the total of which impact pricing.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 16. The fact that Plaintiffs, in this case, may alter their pricing based on price changes for direct materials does not change the reasonableness of Commerce's total cost of manufacturing approach.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-57\">\n   Habas's argument that Commerce's \"methodology results in disparate treatment of respondents that are in the same position\" with respect to changing input costs based solely on differing DIRMAT to TCOM ratios is misplaced.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Habas's Mem. at 20; Habas's Reply at 12. The existence of different DIRMAT to TCOM ratios means, quite simply, that respondents are not similarly situated.

As Commerce explained, Plaintiffs' changing raw material costs \"were just not significant enough to impact the reported [T]COM.\" I &amp; D Mem. at 15. This is not arbitrary, but instead reflects \"each producer's\n   actual overall cost experience.\" Def.-Int.'s Resp. at 11.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-58\">\n   Icdas's argument that Commerce's 25 percent threshold is \"too rigid\" also fails.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Icdas's Mem. at 28. Commerce pointed to generally accepted International Financial Reporting Standards to support its use of the 25 percent threshold and explained that it \"is high enough to ensure that [it] do[es] not move away from [the agency's] normal practice without good cause and forgo the benefits of using an annual average cost, but allows for a change in methodology when significantly changing input costs are clearly affecting [its] annual average cost calculations.\" I &amp; D Mem. at 15 (citation omitted).
