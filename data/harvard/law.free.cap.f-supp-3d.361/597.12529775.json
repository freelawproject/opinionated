As detailed below, Defendants' Motion to Dismiss [33] is granted in part but otherwise denied.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   I. Facts and Procedural History\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   This case centers around a December 2, 2016 sexual encounter between Plaintiff Andrew Doe and Bethany Roe, both undergraduate students at the University of Mississippi. While both participants were intoxicated at the time, Doe and Roe agree that they had sexual intercourse on December 2. Doe maintains that the encounter was consensual, but Roe's friends called law enforcement and reported the incident as a sexual assault. Roe underwent an examination at the hospital that evening. A representative of the University's Title IX Office appeared at the hospital and opened a Title IX investigation into the incident.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   Defendant Honey Ussery, the University's Title IX Coordinator, conducted the Title IX investigation and submitted a report to Defendant Tracy Murry, the Director of the University's Office of Conflict Resolution and Student Conduct. Murry notified Doe of the charges and scheduled a disciplinary hearing before a panel of the University Judicial Council.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   The Judicial Council held a hearing on March 31, 2017, and found Doe responsible. As punishment, the Judicial Council expelled Doe from the University. Doe appealed, and on April 27, 2017, the Appellate Consideration Board upheld the finding that Doe was responsible but changed the sanction levied from expulsion to suspension until fall 2020.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   On March 5, 2018, Doe filed this lawsuit alleging discrimination claims under Title IX, due-process claims under\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201983\">\n    42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , and a state-law claim for breach of contract. He filed an Amended Complaint on April 4, 2018, and a Second Amended Complaint on May 16, 2018, to add new defendants. The Second Amended Complaint [9] asserts claims against the State of Mississippi; the University of Mississippi; the State Institutions of Higher Learning (\"IHL\"); the Board of Trustees of the IHL; the Commissioner and all members of the Board of Trustees of the IHL in their official capacities; Jeffrey S. Vitter, in his official capacity as the Chancellor of the University of Mississippi; and Murry and Ussery, in their official and individual capacities.

Some of these documents would be proper for the jurisdictional issues only. Others can be considered under both Rule 12(b)(1) and 12(b)(6).

The court emphasized that under the second\n   <em>\n    Mathews\n   </em>\n   factor, the \"amount of process constitutionally required in state university disciplinary proceedings will vary in accordance with\n   the particular facts of each case.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 774 n.8.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-64\">\n   Because the evidence of guilt in\n   <em>\n    Plummer\n   </em>\n   was overwhelming, the process was deemed sufficient as a matter of law. As the Fifth Circuit explained, \"In light of the graphic conduct depicted in the videos and photo-which the panels viewed for themselves before affirming the University's findings-further procedural safeguards would not have lessened the risk of an erroneous deprivation of [the plaintiffs'] interests or otherwise altered the outcome.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 774 (citing\n   <em>\n    Mathews\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12026449\" index=\"85\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/424/319/#p332\">\n    424 U.S. at 335\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12026449\" index=\"86\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/424/319/#p332\">\n    96 S.Ct. 893\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ). Accordingly, the plaintiffs failed to show that the issues regarding the Title IX Coordinator \"undermined the integrity of their proceedings.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 776.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-65\">\n   This case is different for two main reasons. First, it is before the Court under Rule 12(b)(6), so the issue is plausibility rather than a lack of evidence. Second, the facts-as pleaded and in the light most favorable to Doe-do not suggest overwhelming proof that Doe sexually assaulted Roe. Thus, the amount of process due may be higher than in\n   <em>\n    Plummer\n   </em>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-66\">\n   Turning then to Doe's arguments regarding Ussery, he says her investigation was flawed, it resulted in an incomplete report that was presented to the Judicial Council as the official report of the Title IX Coordinator, and the panel itself had been trained in a way that prejudiced Doe's ability to be heard. Starting with the investigation, Doe complains that he \"did not meet with Ussery regarding the matter and was never provided with any specifics regarding the allegations by Ussery, nor was he asked to identify potential witnesses or submit any evidence,\" and that Ussery's report excluded some relevant and exculpatory evidence. Am. Compl. [9] \u00b6 65.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-67\">\n   As to the training, Doe makes the following points: (1) the training material \"provides that just because an individual does not protest or resist sexual activity their silence and lack of resistance does not constitute consent,\" (2) it \"provides that when both parties are intoxicated, findings are to be made in favor of the complainant, who is typically female,\" and (3) the materials \"advise the panel members that 'victims' sometimes withhold facts and lie about details, question if they've truly been victimized[,] and 'lie about anything that casts doubt on their account of the event.' \"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 12;\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Am. Compl. [9] \u00b6\u00b6 94-96; Pl.'s Mem. [48] at 14 (slightly mis-quoting Training Slides [42-18] at 21 (\"The desire (sometimes) to increase their credibility by leaving out or lying about anything that might cast doubt on their account of events.\") ).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-68\">\n   Taken as a whole, the Court concludes that Doe has stated a plausible claim. This is a consent-based case in which the victim did not appear before the hearing panel, yet there seems to have been an assumption under Ussery's training materials that an assault occurred. As a result, there is a question whether the panel was trained to ignore some of the alleged deficiencies in the investigation and official report the panel considered. Coupled with the alleged deficiencies in the investigation, it is plausible that the scales were tipped against Doe to such a degree that further procedural safeguards may have lessened the risk of an erroneous deprivation.\n   <em>\n    Mathews\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12026449\" index=\"87\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/424/319/#p332\">\n    424 U.S. at 335\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12026449\" index=\"88\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/424/319/#p332\">\n    96 S.Ct. 893\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . These claims survive.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-69\">\n   b. Panel Selection\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-70\">\n   Doe complains that \"[p]rior to the hearing, [he] was not informed that he had the right to know the identity of the panel members or the right to challenge a panel member.\" Am. Compl. [9] \u00b6 70. He says when he arrived for his hearing, \"he learned that all panel members had not yet\n   been selected,\" so \"[t]he hearing was delayed in order for the University to find a third panel member,\" who \"was presented with the case file for the first time\" \"[a]pproximately fifteen minutes before the hearing began.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 71. Doe asserts that \"one of the female panel members selected ... to preside over his hearing had previously mocked the defenses raised by men accused of sexual assault.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 72. And he contends that \"one of the panelists did not even identify himself at the hearing\" making it impossible for Doe to \"reasonably assess the appropriateness of [that] panel member[ ].\" Pl.'s Mem. [48] at 21.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-71\">\n   Doe is correct that, pursuant to the University's Sexual Misconduct Policy, \"the complainant and respondent will have an opportunity to see a list of board members who will be serving as fact-finders and request recusal of any they have reason to believe are biased\" prior to the hearing. Sexual Misconduct Policy [42-14] at 9. But \"[t]he fact that a valid school policy ... was not followed is not by itself significant in determining whether procedural due process has been violated.\"\n   <em>\n    Vann ex rel. Vann v.

This portion of the claim will go forward. And because some of the panel-selection claim will proceed, the Court will allow the allegation regarding the panel member who did not identify himself to go forward as well.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-73\">\n   c. Cross-Examination\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-74\">\n   Because neither Roe nor any other witnesses against Doe appeared at the hearing, he was not permitted to cross-examine-either directly or through written questions submitted to the hearing panel-the witnesses whose accounts of the evening led to his discipline. To assess the possible impact of cross-examination, it is important to understand the factual context. Doe was found responsible under the University's Sexual Misconduct Policy, which requires consent for all sexual activity and states that \"an incapacitated person is not able to give consent.\" Sexual Misconduct Policy [42-14] at 4. The policy defines incapacitation as follows: \"Someone is incapacitated when he or she cannot understand who, what, when, where, why, or how, with respect to the sexual interaction.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 5.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-75\">\n   The parties agree that Doe and Roe were intoxicated on the night of their encounter, but Roe's level of intoxication-particularly as it relates to the \"who, what, when, where, why, or how\" of the encounter-is less clear from the record before the hearing panel. Starting with the police reports from the night of the fraternity party, Roe seemed to have some ability to understand what was happening: she knew she had returned to Doe's apartment after the party, that they went into a bedroom, and that they had intercourse. Ussery Report [40-1] at 9, 11, 16. But a\n   few days later, Roe came to the police department with her parents and told police officers that she \"did not remember having sex with [Doe.]\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 13. Roe later intimated to Ussery that her drink may have been spiked at the pre-game party and claimed to not remember anything after she left the fraternity party.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 1-2.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-76\">\n   \"In almost every setting where important decisions turn on questions of fact, due process requires an opportunity to confront and cross-examine adverse witnesses.\"\n   <em>\n    Goldberg v. Kelly\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12052726\" index=\"94\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/397/254/#p269\">\n    397 U.S. 254\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 269,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12052726\" index=\"95\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/397/254/#p269\">\n    90 S.Ct. 1011\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12052726\" index=\"96\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/397/254/#p269\">\n    25 L.Ed.2d 287\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1970).

Supp. Mem. [58] at 5. But the Court can consider the Sixth Circuit's reasoning on the value of cross-examination under the second\n   <em>\n    Mathews\n   </em>\n   factor-i.e., \"the risk of erroneously depriving\" Doe's interests by conducting the hearing without cross-examination, and the \"probable value, if any\" of providing cross-examination.\n   <footnotemark>\n    7\n   </footnotemark>\n   <em>\n    Plummer\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12276304\" index=\"102\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/860/767/\">\n    860 F.3d at 774\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-79\">\n   Defendants also argue that cross-examination was not constitutionally required here because Doe \"admitted critical facts central to the determination\" of the finding of responsibility \"and the fact-finder's decision could have been adequately supported by uncontested facts, the observations of the investigating officers, and Doe's own statements.\" Defs.' Rebuttal [52] at 8. Defendants apparently base this argument on Doe's admission that Roe was intoxicated when they had intercourse. According to Defendants, this admission rendered Doe responsible under the Sexual Misconduct Policy. But Doe's admission does not necessarily indicate that Roe was incapacitated under the policy. In fact, Doe testified at the hearing that Roe was not stumbling around and was coherent. Hearing Tr. [40-2] at 13.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-80\">\n   His admission also falls short of the proof in\n   <em>\n    Plummer\n   </em>\n   , which influenced\n   the Fifth Circuit to find that the process in that case was sufficient. It is at least plausible in this he said/she said case, that giving Doe an opportunity to cross-examine Roe could have added some value to the hearing under the second\n   <em>\n    Mathews\n   </em>\n   factor. And while Defendants argue that requiring cross-examination will significantly burden the University by making it unable \"to process complaints regarding alleged student misconduct whenever a witness or party declines to appear at a hearing,\" Defs.'

Thus, he and Roe were not similarly situated.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-94\">\n   While Defendants may ultimately prevail, at this point, the Court lacks sufficient information to assess whether Doe and Roe were similarly situated. As it is, Doe has alleged that he and Roe drank together at his fraternity party; that Roe reported to her doctor that she and Doe \"were both drunk and that she felt it was a mutual decision between both of them\" to have sex; and that the University pursued disciplinary action against him but not Roe.

In other words, existing precedent must have placed the statutory or constitutional question confronted by the official beyond debate. In addition, [the Supreme Court] ha[s] repeatedly told courts ... not to define clearly established law at a high level of generality, since doing so avoids the crucial question whether the official acted reasonably in the particular circumstances that he or she faced.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-102\">\n   <em>\n    Plumhoff v.

Those not specifically addressed would not have changed the outcome. For the foregoing reasons, Defendants' Motion to Dismiss [33] is granted as to all claims against all Defendants other than (1) the Title IX claims against the University; IHL; the Board of Trustees of the IHL; the State of Mississippi; and the Chancellor, IHL Commissioner, and IHL Board Members in their official capacities, and (2) those portions of the claim against Chancellor Vitter under\n   <em>\n    Ex parte Young\n   </em>\n   discussed herein.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-106\">\n   Given that Plaintiff's Motions for Preliminary Injunction [41, 42] have not been fully briefed and the Court has now narrowed the substantive issues, those motions are terminated without prejudice. If Doe wishes to seek preliminary injunctive relief, he may file a new motion that addresses the substantive claims that survived Defendants' motion to dismiss.

Without converting the Rule 12(b)(6) motion into a Rule 56 motion, the Court cannot definitively say which State Defendants face Title IX liability. But the claim at least seems plausible, so the Court will let the Title IX claim go forward against the defendants Doe says Title IX covers: the State, the University, IHL, and the Commissioner and members of the Board of Trustees of IHL.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"4\">\n   <p id=\"p-113\">\n    While such allegations, standing alone, might not be indicative of gender bias,\n    <em>\n     see, e.g.\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <em>\n     Doe v.
