Maloney, United States District Judge\n  </author>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   Michigan allows Defendant Lee Blomquist to grow and use marijuana for personal medical reasons. When he was arrested, he was cultivating over 100 marijuana plants and possessed over 37 pounds of marijuana. Blomquist is charged with violations of federal law, provisions of the Controlled Substances Act. Blomquist moved to enjoin his prosecution. Blomquist argues he holds a valid, state-issued medical marijuana card and asserts that the federal government cannot prosecute him until after a state court has determined that he violated state law. Alternatively, Blomquist argues he should be able to present his state-law affirmative defense to a jury. Neither argument is persuasive. Blomquist's motion to enjoin will be denied.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   I.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   Some background is necessary. On three occasions in March 2017, police observed Clifford Lautzenheiser visit Norman Blomquist's residence. Each time, Lautzenheiser placed something in the trunk of his car and then drove to a parking lot where he sold marijuana to a third party. In April 2017, on a fourth occasion, police arrested Lautzenheiser. He informed detectives that he had been purchasing marijuana from Lee Blomquist on a weekly basis for approximately nine months. Lautzenheiser is a Wisconsin resident and does not possess a Michigan medical marijuana card.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   With the information obtained from Lautzenheizer, police obtained a search warrant for Norman Blomquist's residence. As officers began to execute the warrant, Defendant Lee Blomquist walked out of small building, a chicken coop. Blomquist was detained and handcuffed. He told officer he possessed a Michigan medical marijuana card, asserted that he was in compliance with the law, and offered to give the officers a tour of the property. Blomquist showed the officers the interior of the chicken coop. The officers found more than 100 marijuana plants in five rooms. Blomquist contends most of the plants are not his. The plants belong to other medical marijuana card holders, and he merely tends to the plants. Blomquist also showed the officers the locked entrance to a space above the garage. In the space, the officers found approximately 37 pounds of marijuana, which was packaged and separated in five-gallon buckets. The officers did not seize the plants in the chicken coop.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   The Government charged Blomquist with four crimes: (1) manufacturing 100 or more marijuana plants, (2) possession with the intent to distribute more than 100 marijuana plants, (3) conspiracy to distribute and to possess with the intent to distribute marijuana, and (4) distribution of marijuana. Blomquist filed a motion for an evidentiary hearing, to enjoying the prosecution, and to dismiss the indictment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   II.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   A. Evidentiary Hearing\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   Blomquist contends that his prosecution violates federal law. The 2015 Appropriations Act contained a provision that prevented the Department of Justice from using funds to prevent states that have passed marijuana laws \"from implementing their own laws that authorize the use, distribution, possession, or cultivation of medical marijuana.\" Consolidated and Furthering Continuing Appropriations Act 2015, Pub. L. No. 113-234 \u00a7 538,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=128%20Stat.%202130\">\n    128 Stat. 2130\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 2217 (2014). The same language was added to Appropriations Acts for 2016 ( Pub. L. No. 114-113 ), 2017 ( Pub. L. No. 115-31 ) and 2018 ( Pub. L. No. 115-141 ).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   When a criminal defendant believes that his or her prosecution violates the restrictions in the Appropriations Act, the defendant should file a motion to enjoin the prosecution and the court should hold an evidentiary hearing. The Ninth Circuit held that federal criminal defendants charged with marijuana-related crimes may seek to enjoin a criminal action when the act of prosecuting requires the expenditure of funds which has been prohibited by these Appropriations Acts.\n   <em>\n    United States v. McIntosh\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4350591\" index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/833/1163/#p1172\">\n    833 F.3d 1163\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 1172-73 (9th Cir. 2016). The Appropriations Clause, U.S. Const. art. I, \u00a7 9, cl. 7, prohibits the payment of money from the Treasury unless it has been approved by an act of Congress.\n   <em>\n    McIntosh\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4350591\" index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/833/1163/#p1172\">\n    833 F.3d at 1174\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Thus, if the Department of Justice spends money in a manner explicitly prohibited by statute, here the prosecution of a criminal action, the Department violates the Appropriations Clause and the maintenance of the criminal action constitutes a violation of the separation of powers.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4350591\" index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/833/1163/#p1172\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4350591\" index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/833/1163/#p1172\">\n    at 1175\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . The separation of powers violation can be raised by the defendant to challenge the act of prosecuting.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4350591\" index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/833/1163/#p1172\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   The court should then hold an evidentiary hearing to determine whether the defendant's conduct was authorized by state law.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4350591\" index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/833/1163/#p1172\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4350591\" index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/833/1163/#p1172\">\n    at 1179\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   Accordingly, Blomquist is entitled to an evidentiary hearing. The Court scheduled and held a hearing for Blomquist's motion. After both parties were afforded an opportunity to present proofs, the Court afforded both sides the opportunity to file supplemental briefs.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   B. Burden of Proof\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   Blomquist argues the Government bears the burden of proof at the evidentiary hearing. Blomquist reasons that if he can show that he is licensed or certified by Michigan, the Government must prove that his prosecution does not violate the separation-of-powers concerns arising from the limitations on prosecution established in the Appropriations Act. Put another way, Blomquist contends that his state-issued medical marijuana card entitles him to a presumption that his conduct was legal under state law and the Government must prove that he was violating state law in order to prosecute him for violating federal law. The Court disagrees.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   First, this criminal action is a valid exercise of the Government's authority to enforce the criminal laws. Blomquist has been charged with violations of the Controlled Substances Act (CSA). The Sixth Circuit Court of Appeals has held that the CSA is a valid exercise of Congress' authority under the Commerce Clause.\n   <em>\n    United States v. Brown\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9451892\" index=\"6\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/276/211/#p214\">\n    276 F.3d 211\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 214-15 (6th Cir. 2002) (collecting cases). At trial, the Government bears the burden of proving that Blomquist committed the crime with which he has been charged.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   Blomquist's motion to enjoin raises a separation of powers challenge to his prosecution.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    McIntosh\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4350591\" index=\"7\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/833/1163/#p1172\">\n    833 F.3d at 1174\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (holding that the defendant-appellants had \"standing to invoke separation-of-powers powers provisions of the Constitution to challenge their criminal prosecutions.\"). The court remanded the consolidated appeals to the various district courts for evidentiary hearings without identifying which party would bear the burden of proof at the evidentiary hearing.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   As the moving party, the defendant bears the burden of proving complete compliance with Michigan's Medical Marijuana Act.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   After\n   <em>\n    McIntosh\n   </em>\n   was published, the Eastern District of California held that the defendant bears the burden in a\n   <em>\n    McIntosh\n   </em>\n   evidentiary hearing.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    United States v. Daleman\n   </em>\n   , No. 1:11-cr-385,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"8\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2017%20WL%201256743\">\n    2017 WL 1256743\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *3 (E.D.

Cal. Apr. 24, 2017) (finding initially that the Government had the burden and then, after reading\n   <em>\n    Daleman\n   </em>\n   , placing the burden on the defendant). In\n   <em>\n    Daleman\n   </em>\n   , Judge Drozd identified three reasons the defendant bore the burden of proof. First, the text of the appropriations rider does not place the burden on the government to prove non-compliance.\n   <extracted-citation index=\"10\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2017%20WL%201256743\">\n    2017 WL 1256743\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *3 n.5. Second, traditionally the burden of proof is not placed on a litigant to prove facts within the knowledge of the adversary.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at *3. Third, generally the proponent of a motion bears the burden of proof.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   The nature of the relief sought also supports the conclusion that the defendant bears the burden of proof. Judge Lawson in the Eastern District of Michigan reached the same conclusion as Judge Drozd, but for a different reason.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    United States v. Bally\n   </em>\n   , No. 17-20135,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"11\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2017%20WL%205625896\">\n    2017 WL 5625896\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *5 (E.D. Mich. Nov. 22, 2017). Following\n   <em>\n    McIntosh\n   </em>\n   , Judge Lawson explained that the purpose of the evidentiary hearing was not to prove guilt, a\n   burden shouldered by the Government.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"12\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2017%20WL%205625896\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   Rather, the purpose of the hearing was to determine whether the federal prosecution should be enjoined.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"13\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2017%20WL%205625896\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   And, the party seeking an injunction bears the burden of proof.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"14\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2017%20WL%205625896\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   To prove that the prosecution should be enjoined, the defendant had to prove compliance with Michigan's medical marijuana statute.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"15\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2017%20WL%205625896\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   The Court must acknowledge an opinion reaching the opposite conclusion. The discussion of the burden of proof in\n   <em>\n    United States v. Samp\n   </em>\n   , No. 16-cr-20263,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"16\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2017%20WL%201164453\">\n    2017 WL 1164453\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (E.D. Mich. Mar. 29, 2017) (Ludington, J.) is perfunctory. Judge Ludington concluded that the Government had the burden at the evidentiary hearing because the Government had the burden of proving guilt.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at *2. But, as Judge Lawson reasoned, the purpose of the hearing was not to determine guilt or innocence of the federal charges. The purpose of the hearing was to determine whether the prosecution should be enjoined because the restrictions placed on the use of appropriated funds. That conclusion, whether an injunction should issue, depends on compliance with state law, an issue unrelated to the federal charges.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   III.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   Having concluded that Blomquist, not the Government, bears the burden of proof at the evidentiary hearing, the Court considers whether Blomquist established that he was in strict compliance with Michigan law. Michigan's Medical Marijuana Act (MMMA), 333.26421,\n   <em>\n    et seq.\n   </em>\n   , sets forth both an immunity provision, \u00a7 333.26424 (\u00a7 4), and an affirmative defense, \u00a7 333.26428 (\u00a7 8).\n   <em>\n    People v.

First, the record contains no evidence that Blomquist had a bona fide physician-patient relationship with a medical provider who conducted the required patient assessment. No doctor testified at the hearing and no medical records were introduced. Second, Blomquist has not established that the amount of marijuana he possessed was reasonable. He is credited with possession of 37 pounds, nearly 600 ounces. Blomquist has not put forth any evidence about how much marijuana was necessary for his medical condition or about the reliability of the source of his marijuana. Finally, Blomquist has a prior felony drug conviction. (ECF No. 58.) Therefore, he cannot be a caregiver under the MMMA and cannot possess marijuana or marijuana plants for other qualifying patients.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   C. Injunction and Dismissal\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   Blomquist is not entitled to an injunction of the prosecution because he has not demonstrated that he was complying with Michigan law.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   At the hearing, and in the supplemental briefs, Blomquist argues that Counts 1 and 2, the charges related to possession of plants, should be dismissed. Blomquist notes that the plants were not seized by the police. Blomquist infers from the lack of seizure that the plants cannot be evidence of a crime.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   The Court will not dismiss Counts 1 and 2. At the hearing, officers explained why they did not seize the plants. They had no ability to care for the growing plants. In the event that the plants did not violate Michigan law, the officers wanted to avoid being civilly liable. The Government presented a number of pictures of the plants at the hearing. And, the officers provided some testimony about the scope of the grow operation. The decision not to seize the plants does not require the Court to dismiss the charges.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   IV.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   Finally, Blomquist argues his prosecution violates his Due Process and Equal Protection rights. He asserts that the assumptions about marijuana in the Controlled Substance Act (CSA) are irrational, are not related to a legitimate government interest, and insists that prosecuting him for locally cultivated marijuana violates the commerce clause.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   A. Due Process and Equal Protection\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-50\">\n   Blomquist argues the classification of marijuana as a Schedule I controlled substance violates the Fifth Amendment, specifically the due process and equal protection guarantees in that amendment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-51\">\n   The Fifth Amendment states that no person shall be deprived over liberty without due process of law.

The Court concludes that Blomquist bears the burden of proof. To be entitled to an injunction, Blomquist must prove that he was complying with state law. He did not do so. Blomquist has not established that he was immune from prosecution under the Michigan Medical Marijuana Act or that he qualified for the affirmative defense under the MMMA.
