INTRODUCTION\n   </strong>\n  </author>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   Defendant Marcus Hutchins is a hacker who received considerable attention for disabling a North Korean malware called WannaCry. He has a reputation as a \"white hat\" hacker, which implies a hacker who works for the benefit of the public. Hutchins has nevertheless been indicted for various crimes related to his activity with two forms of malware, \"Kronos\" and \"UPAS Kit.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   On March 30, 2018, Hutchins filed a motion to suppress the statement that he made to Federal Bureau of Investigation (\"FBI\") agents immediately following his arrest, as well as any evidence the government may have obtained as a result. (Docket # 55). On July 13, 2018, Hutchins also filed three motions to dismiss various counts in the superseding indictment. (Docket # 92, # 95, and # 96).\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   Magistrate Judge Nancy Joseph issued a report and recommendation in which she recommended denying all motions. (Docket # 109). Hutchins timely objected, and each party has fully briefed the issues. The Court will address each of the motions below. In accord with Magistrate Joseph's analyses, all motions will be denied. The Court will overrule Hutchins's objections and adopt Magistrate Joseph's recommendation in large measure.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   <strong>\n    2.

RELEVANT FACTS\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   Hutchins, a citizen of the United Kingdom, is a coder and hacker of considerable repute. He is most well-known for finding the kill-switch to a North Korean malware called WannaCry in May 2017. According to the superseding indictment, several years ago, Hutchins developed two types of malware, UPAS Kit and Kronos (a \"banking trojan\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   The superseding indictment alleges that Hutchins developed UPAS Kit and, in 2012, sold it to Individual A, who then sold it to an individual in the Eastern District of Wisconsin. At some point before July 2014, Hutchins allegedly developed Kronos and provided it to Individual A, intending for Individual A to advertise, promote, and sell it. Hutchins used a YouTube video to demonstrate how Kronos worked, and referred prospective customers to Individual A. In December 2014, Hutchins hacked and analyzed a malware that competed with Kronos, and published a blog post describing the competing malware's vulnerability. In February 2015, Hutchins allegedly updated the Kronos malware, and distributed it to Individual B, who was\n   located in California and was known to be involved in cyber-based criminal activities.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   On July 11, 2017, a grand jury indicted Hutchins on various counts related to his activity with the malware. He was charged with conspiracy, fraud, and unlawfully intercepting communications. (Docket # 1). On June 5, 2018, the government filed a superseding indictment with additional charges. (Docket # 86). In Count One, the superseding indictment charges Hutchins with conspiring to violate the Computer Fraud and Abuse Act (\"CFAA\"),\n   <extracted-citation index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201030\">\n    18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1030\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , and the Electronic Communications Privacy Act (\"Wiretap Act\"),\n   <extracted-citation index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%202510\">\n    18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2510\n   </extracted-citation>\n   <em>\n    et seq.\n   </em>\n   , in violation of\n   <extracted-citation index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20371\">\n    18 U.S.C. \u00a7 371\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Counts Two and Three charge Hutchins with disseminating, aiding, and abetting an attempt to advertise the malware, in violation of the Wiretap Act. Counts Four and Five charge Hutchins with aiding and abetting the distribution of the malware, in violation of the Wiretap Act. Count Six charges Hutchins with using, or getting others to use, the malware to intercept communications in violation of the Wiretap Act. Count Seven charges Hutchins with causing, aiding, and abetting the transmission of malware in violation of the CFAA. Count Eight charges Hutchins with aiding and abetting the intentional access and damage to protected computers for the purpose of private financial gain, in violation of the CFAA. Count Nine charges Hutchins with lying to the FBI about whether he knew that his computer code was part of Kronos, in violation of\n   <extracted-citation index=\"6\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201001\">\n    18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1001\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a)(2). Finally, Count Ten charges Hutchins with conspiring to commit fraud in connection with his malware activities, in violation of\n   <extracted-citation index=\"7\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%201343\">\n    18 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1343\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 1349.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   In the summer of 2017, Hutchins spent a week in Las Vegas to attend \"Defcon,\" which is a conference for hackers. On August 2, 2017, Hutchins was about to embark on his journey back to the U.K. Hutchins was waiting in a lounge at the Las Vegas airport when a federal agent and two Customs and Border Patrol (\"CBP\") officials approached him. Unbeknownst to him, FBI Special Agents Lee Chartier (\"Chartier\") and Jamie Butcher (\"Butcher\") had been monitoring Hutchins's whereabouts all morning, and had followed him to the airport, through security, and to his lounge. Although the FBI had originally planned to arrest Hutchins as he boarded the flight, they opted to arrest him earlier in order to ensure that he did not consume any alcoholic beverages that might affect his ability to answer questions in an interrogation. Indeed, Hutchins had spent much of the week partying, which included ingesting various intoxicating substances. He had had very little sleep the night before. There are no allegations, however, that Hutchins was intoxicated whilst at the airport-only exhausted and, it can be assumed, terribly hungover.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   Thus, at approximately 1:17 p.m., Hutchins was approached in the airport lounge by two CBP officers and a plainclothes FBI agent, Chartier. These officials escorted Hutchins to a stairwell, whereupon he was handcuffed. Chartier informed Hutchins that he was under arrest pursuant to a federal warrant. The officials then led Hutchins to an interview room, where Butcher was waiting. The agents observed Hutchins to be alert, engaged, and not visibly intoxicated or disoriented. Hutchins verbally confirmed that he was able to answer questions and was not drunk. Hutchins received his\n   <em>\n    Miranda\n   </em>\n   rights orally. He was also given an advisement of rights form. He listened to his rights and signed the advisement form in the presence of both agents. There is a dispute as to what time he signed it, but the Court does not find this to be material for reasons that will be explained below.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   Hutchins then proceeded to respond to the questions asked by the agents, and gave consent for them to search his phones, laptops, backpacks, and USB drives. He did not request a lawyer or invoke his right to remain silent, although he did ask \"what this is all about.\" The agents told him they would explain eventually, but continued questioning him. In total, Hutchins was questioned for approximately 105 minutes. He was offered food, an opportunity to use the restroom, and-eventually-allowed to contact his mother. He was not shown a copy of the arrest warrant until over an hour into the interrogation.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   Hutchins showed every indication of being voluntarily cooperative with the agents, but was also clearly confused about the nature of the interrogation. The interrogation began with broad questions about his career and his online activities, but about ten minutes in, the questions focused on Hutchins's involvement with malware. Hutchins acknowledged that when he was younger, he had written some code that ultimately ended up in malware, but denied that he developed malware. About eleven minutes into the interrogation, after looking at a string of code, Hutchins asked if they were looking for the developer of Kronos. Hutchins stated that he did not develop Kronos, and he had \"gotten out\" of writing code for malware before he was eighteen. Thirteen minutes in, he said that he had feared that law enforcement authorities would come after him, instead of the actual developer, because pieces of his code appeared in Kronos. Thus, Hutchins was aware that the criminal investigation was, at least in part, about Kronos, and that he was implicated in the investigation, although he expressed confusion about why he was being detained throughout the interrogation. Almost eighty minutes into the recorded interrogation, the agents finally provided him with the warrant, and told him that it had \"nothing to do with WannaCry.\" The interrogation continued for about twenty minutes after that. Throughout the remainder of the interrogation, Hutchins tried to be helpful but noted that he had been \"out\" of so-called \"black hat\" hacking for so long that he did not have any helpful connections.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   Hutchins was taken to a jail, where he proceeded to make two phone calls, which were recorded. Prior to making the phone calls, Hutchins was informed that the phone calls were subject to monitoring and recording. In the calls, Hutchins also made incriminating statements.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   <strong>\n    4. ANALYSIS\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   <strong>\n    4.1 Motion to Suppress\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   Hutchins seeks to suppress his post-arrest statements and any evidence that may have been obtained as a result of his statements. He argues that he did not waive his\n   <em>\n    Miranda\n   </em>\n   rights, (Docket # 55 at 6-9), and submits that the government has not met its burden in rebutting the presumption against waiver, (Docket # 111 at 13). Hutchins calls into question whether (1) he received notice of his rights at all; and (2) whether he was able to voluntarily waive his rights due to his intoxication, his\n   limited understanding of the American criminal procedural system, and the deceptive nature of the interrogation.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   It is axiomatic that law enforcement officers must inform suspects of their\n   <em>\n    Miranda\n   </em>\n   rights before a custodial interrogation.\n   <em>\n    United States v. Thurman\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12516815\" index=\"8\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/889/356/#p364\">\n    889 F.3d 356\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 364 (7th Cir. 2018). \"If the suspect invokes his rights, the officers must cease their questioning.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12516815\" index=\"9\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/889/356/#p364\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   However, before officers must cease their questioning, the burden is on the suspect to assert his\n   <em>\n    Miranda\n   </em>\n   rights in a \"clear and unambiguous\" fashion.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12516815\" index=\"10\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/889/356/#p364\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   (quoting\n   <em>\n    United States v.

Hutchins did not make any statements regarding his intent to invoke his\n   <em>\n    Miranda\n   </em>\n   rights; therefore, his rights were not invoked in a clear and unambiguous fashion. The interrogation properly proceeded.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   However, \"[e]ven if a suspect does not invoke his\n   <em>\n    Miranda\n   </em>\n   rights, his self-incriminating statements cannot be used against him in court unless the Government shows by a preponderance of the evidence that he voluntarily waived these rights.\"\n   <em>\n    Thurman\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12516815\" index=\"12\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/889/356/#p364\">\n    889 F.3d at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   364 (citing\n   <em>\n    Berghuis v.

This argument is a non-starter, in part because Hutchins acknowledges that he was read his rights. (Docket # 55 at 5-6) (\"[T]here seems to be little doubt that the agents-in some unspecified fashion, at an uncertain time-advised Mr. Hutchins of his rights under\n   <em>\n    Miranda\n   </em>\n   .\"). Hutchins makes much about the fact that there is no proof that he received his rights at the beginning of the interrogation, but he does not suggest when else they may have been given. Additionally, both agents have testified, under oath and in non-contradictory terms, that the rights were given at the beginning of\n   the interrogation. Moreover, in the recorded portion of the interrogation, Butcher provided Hutchins with a consent form to search his computers and said, \"because we're the government, there's a form for that, too,\" implying that Hutchins had previously received other consent forms. The Court sees no reasonable basis to conclude that Hutchins did not receive notice of his rights before the interrogation.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   Additionally, it does not actually matter when Hutchins signed the advisement of rights form, so long as he was apprised of his\n   <em>\n    Miranda\n   </em>\n   rights prior to questioning. \"[T]he rigidity of\n   <em>\n    Miranda\n   </em>\n   does not extend to the precise formulation of the warnings given a criminal defendant...[and] no talismanic incantation is required to satisfy its strictures.\"\n   <em>\n    Duckworth v.

The agents monitored\n   Hutchins from the beginning of the day to ensure that he was sober when he was arrested. They ensured that he was in custody before he had the opportunity to drink at the airport. They walked him to two separate locations (first, the stairwell; second, the interview room) and engaged him in conversation, which gave them opportunity to evaluate whether Hutchins appeared to be somehow impaired by an intoxicant. Hutchins appeared to be alert, engaged, coordinated, and coherent. There is no evidence in the record to the contrary. There is also no evidence, nor does Hutchins claim, that he was under the influence of drugs that day-only that he was exhausted. But a terrible hangover alone does not, as a matter of law, render someone unable to exercise or waive their\n   <em>\n    Miranda\n   </em>\n   rights.

But it may harm your defence if you do not mention when questioned something which you later rely on in Court. Anything you do say may be given in evidence.\" Police and Criminal Evidence Act 1984 Code G 3.5, Revised Code of Practice for the Statutory Power of Arrest by Police Officers (revised July 2012), https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/117583/pace-code-g-2012.pdf. For comparison, an arrest warning in the United States reads to the effect of, \"you have the right to remain silent, anything you say can and will be used against you in a court of law.\"\n   <em>\n    See e.g.,\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Miranda v.

In the U.K., a defendant is told, \"You do not have to say anything.\" There is neither right, nor waiver-the consequence stems, in fact, from\n   <em>\n    not\n   </em>\n   saying anything (\"it may harm your defence if you do not mention when questioned...\"). By contrast, in the U.S., a defendant is told \"you have a right to remain silent,\" and the consequences of failing to remain silent are clear: \"anything you say can and\n   <em>\n    will be used against you\n   </em>\n   .\" The warnings-and their consequences-are substantively different, although their cadences are similar. It is conceivable that anyone-even a well-educated person-would find comfort in the broad similarities between the two, and believe that, wording aside, the substance is the same.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   The Seventh Circuit has held that\n   <em>\n    Miranda\n   </em>\n   waivers are valid so long as the defendant has a general understanding of the nature of the right, and the consequences of waiver.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Collins v.

However, Hutchins's recent triumph with WannaCry had vaulted him into the public eye as a \"white hat\" hacker. Thus, Hutchins could have been reasonably confused about the FBI's interest in him. In assessing whether he voluntarily waived his rights, some consideration must be given to the fact that white hat hacking is a complex and relatively novel field that can toe an already blurry line vis-\u00e0-vis online criminal activity. The agents did not tell Hutchins why he was under arrest, and did nothing to explain the nature of the charges against him until the end of his interrogation. Hutchins, who had no cause for concern regarding his role in WannaCry, and who had distanced himself from nefarious internet activity, cooperated. The interrogation ended twenty minutes after he was presented with the warrant, though he continued to consent to searches and answer questions after he understood the charges against him.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   This case differs from\n   <em>\n    Serlin\n   </em>\n   in one salient way: Hutchins had already been indicted on a host of specific charges. Thus, the aim of the agents' questioning was not to cobble together enough information to establish probable cause for arrest, as it was in\n   <em>\n    Serlin\n   </em>\n   . Rather, the purpose of the interrogation was to continue collecting enough evidence to establish guilt beyond a reasonable doubt. The stakes were dramatically higher, and Hutchins's privilege against self-incrimination all the more precious. The government argues that this fact cuts against Hutchins-that is, he understood that the \"nature\" of the investigation was criminal, and should have known not to make incriminating statements. However, this ignores the context of Hutchins's work as a hacker. Hutchins had recently dealt with matters of international concern, and reasonably believed that it was in his best interest to answer their questions. At one point in the interrogation, he made a comment that showed that he did not realize he had even been indicted. There is no reason why the government could not have told him exactly why he was arrested, as he requested, and as was required of them by Federal Rule of Criminal Procedure 4(c), unless they were concerned that he would not be cooperative with them. There is certainly an element of deception to this set of events that the Court does not endorse.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   On the other hand, the scope of the agents' questions should have put Hutchins on notice of the nature of the investigation. The agents did not try to \"hide the ball,\" so to speak, about their interest in Kronos, and asked him about it early and often in the interrogation. And although the agents acted very familiarly with Hutchins, which may have put him at false ease, Chartier did remind him that he was in trouble. The Court is concerned by the abject failure of the agents to abide by the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure 4(c), but their obvious interest in Kronos-including providing Hutchins with a string of code related to Kronos-leads the Court to conclude that there is not clear and convincing evidence that they acted with intent to deceive. Moreover, the fact that\n   Hutchins continued to answer questions and consented to the search after he knew the substance of the indictment indicates that the deception was not material to his statements-that is, it seems that he would have attempted to be helpful even if he had seen the warrant.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   <strong>\n    4.1.2.4 Totality of the Circumstances\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   Under the totality of the circumstances-considering Hutchins's exhausted state, his unfamiliarity with the American criminal procedure system, his high level of intelligence, and the lack of material deception, there is an insufficient basis for the Court to find that Hutchins's statements were involuntary. It is wholly improper that he was not provided with a warrant immediately upon arrest. But in light of the record of the post-arrest interrogation, the government has met its burden in proving that the waiver was voluntary.\n   <em>\n    Thurman\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12516815\" index=\"71\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/889/356/#p364\">\n    889 F.3d at 364\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-50\">\n   <strong>\n    4.2 Motion to Dismiss\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-51\">\n   Hutchins advances several motions to dismiss, all of which must be denied for the reasons given below.

Therefore, the Court adopts the magistrate's recommendation to deny all motions.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-101\">\n   Accordingly,\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-102\">\n   <strong>\n    IT IS ORDERED\n   </strong>\n   that Marcus Hutchins's motion to suppress (Docket # 55) be and the same is hereby\n   <strong>\n    DENIED\n   </strong>\n   ;\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-103\">\n   <strong>\n    IT IS FURTHER ORDERED\n   </strong>\n   that Marcus Hutchins's motion to dismiss (Docket # 56) be and the same is hereby\n   <strong>\n    DENIED as moot\n   </strong>\n   ;\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-104\">\n   <strong>\n    IT IS FURTHER ORDERED\n   </strong>\n   that Marcus Hutchins's motions to dismiss (Docket # 92, # 95, and # 96) be and the same are hereby\n   <strong>\n    DENIED\n   </strong>\n   ;\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-105\">\n   <strong>\n    IT IS FURTHER ORDERED\n   </strong>\n   that Marcus Hutchins's objections to Magistrate Judge Nancy Joseph's Report and Recommendation (Docket # 111) be and the same are hereby\n   <strong>\n    OVERRULED\n   </strong>\n   in accordance with the terms of this Order; and\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-106\">\n   <strong>\n    IT IS FURTHER ORDERED\n   </strong>\n   that Magistrate Judge Nancy Joseph's Report and Recommendation (Docket # 109) be and the same is hereby\n   <strong>\n    ADOPTED\n   </strong>\n   in accordance with the terms of this Order.\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-109\">\n    Hutchins's motion to dismiss for failure to state offenses and multiplicity (Docket # 95) relates to the superseding indictment and is intended to replace his original motion to dismiss (Docket # 56), which will be denied as moot.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"2\">\n   <p id=\"p-110\">\n    The Court notes that the agents' testimony is somewhat contradictory on this point. Chartier stated that they showed Hutchins the warrant before the interrogation was recorded. By contrast, Butcher stated that they first showed Hutchins the warrant over an hour into the interrogation. The recording of the interrogation suggests that Butcher is correct. Specifically, over an hour into the recording, Chartier says: \"Okay. Well, here's the arrest warrant. And just to be honest-just to be honest, hey, now I'm going to tell you the truth...If I'm being honest with you, Marcus, this has absolutely nothing to do with WannaCry.\" The balance of the evidence strongly suggests that Hutchins was not shown the arrest warrant until over an hour into the interrogation.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"3\">\n   <p id=\"p-111\">\n    Hutchins also stresses that agents arrested him at the last possible moment, rather than on July 11, 2017, when the indictment came in, in order to confuse him. The logic underlying this argument is not entirely clear, and there are other obvious, less nefarious reasons why there might be a delay in the arrest (\n    <em>\n     e.g.\n    </em>\n    , the desire to prolong the investigation throughout the conference; the arrest logistics). It is not eminently clear what is confusing about being arrested\n    <em>\n     on the plane\n    </em>\n    versus at any point earlier.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"4\">\n   <p id=\"p-112\">\n    Hutchins does not argue the effect of the violation of Federal Rule of Criminal Procedure 4(c)(3)(A), which governs execution of a warrant:\n   </p>\n   <blockquote id=\"p-113\">\n    Upon arrest, an officer possessing the original or a duplicate original warrant must show it to the defendant. If the officer does not possess the warrant, the officer must inform the defendant of the warrant's existence and of the offense charged and, at the defendant's request, must show the original or a duplicate original warrant to the defendant as soon as possible.\n   </blockquote>\n   <p id=\"p-114\">\n    Few courts have had moment to consider whether a violation of this rule would warrant exclusion of evidence, though it certainly might, for deterrent purposes, if the violation compromised a substantive constitutional right and the officers acted bad faith.\n    <em>\n     Bryson v.
