MASTROIANNI, UNITED STATES DISTRICT JUDGE\n  </author>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   Plaintiff Michael Hootstein is a custodial grandparent of a student at Amherst Regional High School (\"ARHS\") and of a young child who will attend Amherst schools. Plaintiff is proceeding\n   <em>\n    pro se\n   </em>\n   and brought claims against Defendant Amherst-Pelham Regional School Committee (\"Defendant\") related to lead-contaminated water at Defendant's schools, including ARHS. The complaint alleges two causes of action: first, a claim under\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201983\">\n    42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983\n   </extracted-citation>\n   that Defendant's response to lead-contaminated drinking water violated Plaintiff's, his grandson's, and others' Fourteenth Amendment due process rights (Count I); and second, the same conduct violated Article 97 of the Amendments to the Massachusetts Constitution (Count II). Plaintiff seeks various forms of injunctive and declaratory relief, but he does not seek monetary damages. Defendant moved to dismiss both counts, arguing the \u00a7 1983 claim is preempted by the Safe Drinking Water Act (\"SDWA\"), Defendant is not subject to the SDWA, and Art. 97 does not confer a private right of action. The court heard argument on the motion on January 17, 2019.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   As explained below, Defendant's motion to dismiss will be granted in part and denied in part.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   <strong>\n    I. BACKGROUND\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   As the custodian of his two grandsons (one a student at ARHS who has a learning disability, the other a 5-year-old who will attend Amherst schools), Plaintiff is concerned about lead contamination in the water at Amherst schools.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   (Compl. (Dkt. No. 1) at \u00b6\u00b6 1, 12.) \" 'There is no safe level of exposure to lead and even exposure to relatively low levels can cause severe irreversible health effects.' \" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 21 (quoting June 2016 report from Massachusetts Department of Public Health).) Legislation pending in Massachusetts when Plaintiff filed his complaint, if passed, would have required immediate shut-off of school drinking or cooking water containing more than 1 part per billion (\"ppb\") of lead. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 1).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   Water at Amherst schools is lead-contaminated, and, Plaintiff alleges, five Amherst schools have 90th percentile lead levels between 35 ppb and 93 ppb, which is between 1.4 and 3.7 times more contaminated than the water in Flint, Michigan.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6\u00b6 15-19.) A local newspaper reported \"many\" water samples that remained in pipes overnight \"exceeded the EPA's 15 parts per billion action level for lead,\" but \"almost all\" of the samples \"had negative tests for lead when water ran for 30 seconds.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 28.) The article quoted the Amherst Health Director as saying, \" '[T]he water consumed at schools is likely to be just a minor portion of any lead intake.' \" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) Subsequent news coverage claimed that, of schools tested in western Massachusetts, \"the Amherst-Pelham Regional School District had the highest number of taps with elevated levels of lead.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 29.) The same Health Director was quoted as saying, \" 'It's not that there's lead in the water, the water that enters the schools is safe. What happens is as it goes through these fixtures; [sic] it's picking up some lead.' \" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) Thus, the town itself acknowledged water became contaminated when passing through fixtures in schools.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   On October 11, 2016, the Acting Superintendent informed parents that school drinking water was safe \"after using the flushing protocols.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 23.) Plaintiff subsequently sent four written complaints to Defendant that the flushing protocols were ineffective, lead contamination in school drinking water had not been reduced to safe levels, and Amherst schools had been providing children contaminated drinking water and food prepared using contaminated water. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6\u00b6 23-26.) He contended that \"increased rates of Amherst children with learning disabilities in our schools suggest the possibility that lead ingested by our children at school caused or contributed to our children's learning disabilities.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 25.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   Plaintiff acknowledges Defendant took corrective action to remediate lead in school drinking water but claims that after remediation, Defendant failed to test the water to ensure it was safe to drink. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 27.) He also alleges Defendant falsely claimed water was safe to drink when it was not, which exposed people to lead-contaminated water and possible lead poisoning. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6\u00b6 4, 30) He requested Defendant provide Amherst schools with bottled water (\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 25), which Defendant has allegedly not done.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   Plaintiff alleges Defendant created a \"foreseeable risk\" that he, his grandson, and others would be \"lead-poisoned at an Amherst public school from drinking lead-contaminated water deceptively certified as safe by defendant.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 4.) Defendant's alleged misconduct began in September 2016 when it learned that Plaintiff and others \"were likely drinking/ingesting lead-contaminated school drinking water/food\" and chose not to warn them. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 5.) Defendant allegedly \"provid[ed] toxic, lead-contaminated school drinking water unfit for human use and consumption to schoolchildren and adults (like the plaintiff)\" knowing \"lead-poisoning is likely to cause foreseeable irreparable physical, emotional and financial harm.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 32;\n   <em>\n    see also\n    <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201983\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201983\">\n    at \u00b6 36\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (Defendant \"continues to expose all their [sic] students and their parents (the plaintiff in the current matter) to toxic lead-contaminated school drinking water\").) In addition, Defendant \"has continued to deny irrefutable scientific evidence proving Amherst school drinking water dangerously exposes students (like plaintiff's grandson), parents (like the plaintiff), teachers and school staff to dire injury and imminent impairment known to be caused by even low levels of lead toxicity that bioaccumulates over time and is mostly stored in human bone.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 6.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   In Count I, Plaintiff claims Defendant deprived him of his rights to bodily integrity and to care and protect his grandson; Plaintiff also claims that, under the state-created danger doctrine, Defendant exposed him and others to possible lead poisoning. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6\u00b6 4, 7, 30, 33, 37, 39.) Plaintiff further claims he has been denied his procedural due process right to seek redress for Defendant's conduct. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 35.) In Count II, Plaintiff claims Defendant violated his right \"to clean water\" under Art. 97 of the Amendments to the Massachusetts Constitution. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6\u00b6 38-39.) He alleges he has suffered and will suffer emotional, economic, and physical injuries, but the complaint does not seek monetary damages. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6\u00b6 3-7, 32-33, 36-37, 39.) Rather, he seeks declaratory and injunctive relief, including an order requiring Defendant to provide bottled water to schools, install lead-free water supply lines in contaminated schools, conduct periodic lead testing, and perform an independent assessment of the extent of students' and others' lead exposure. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at Prayer for Relief.) Plaintiff also requests the appointment of a monitor to ensure Defendant complies with lead standards in proposed legislation pending in Massachusetts in 2017. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   )\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   <strong>\n    II. CLAIMS BROUGHT ON BEHALF OF A MINOR OR OTHER PERSON\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   Plaintiff listed himself as the only plaintiff in the caption on the complaint. But throughout the complaint, his various motion papers, and at oral argument, he stated he is bringing this action to protect the rights of himself, his grandson, all other students and parents, teachers, staff, and the general public. (Compl. (Dkt. No. 1) at \u00b6\u00b6 3-6, 32-34, 36, 39; MTD Opp. (Dkt. No. 14) at 1-3, 13-15; Motion for PI (Dkt. No. 24) at 1; PI Brief (Dkt. No. 25) at 1-2, 7-14.) Defendant did not raise the issue of standing in its motion to dismiss, but, in its opposition to Plaintiff's motion for a preliminary injunction, Defendant argued Plaintiff lacks standing to assert claims on his grandson's behalf.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   \"By law, there are 'only' two ways an individual may appear in federal court, either '\n   <em>\n    pro se\n   </em>\n   or through legal counsel.' \"\n   <em>\n    Clauson v.

But the potential unfairness of the rule is evident to the court because it prevents minors-who cannot bring their own\n   <em>\n    pro se\n   </em>\n   actions-from vindicating their rights in federal court unless they are represented by counsel. As a result, children are denied access to our legal system if their guardians are not attorneys, cannot afford counsel, or cannot find an attorney willing to take a case on contingency.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Sonja Kerr, Winkelman: Pro Se\n   <em>\n    Parents of Children with Disabilities in the Courts (or Not?)\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"16\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=26%20Alaska%20L.%20Rev.%20271\">\n    26 Alaska L.

Nevertheless, the court is bound by the rule prohibiting a lay guardian from representing a minor. As a result, Plaintiff-as a\n   <em>\n    pro se\n   </em>\n   litigant-can assert claims only on his own behalf. He cannot bring claims on behalf of his grandson or anyone else. This means the court cannot consider any claim that Plaintiff's grandson or anyone else suffered or will suffer harm because of Defendant's conduct. If Plaintiff would like to bring an action on behalf of his grandson or a class action on behalf of a class of people similarly situated to Plaintiff or his grandson, he must first arrange for counsel to represent him.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   Thus, the court will consider only Plaintiff's claims brought on his own behalf.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   <strong>\n    III.

As to the \u00a7 1983 claim, the Sixth Circuit reviewed what a plaintiff must prove to establish a substantive due process violation, focusing on the state's culpability for the contaminated water, which varies depending on circumstances like whether there was time \"for reflection and unhurried judgments\" (in which case the standard is deliberate indifference) or if there was no opportunity for \"reasoned deliberation\" (in which case the standard might be higher).\n   <em>\n    Boler\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12275592\" index=\"99\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/865/391/\">\n    865 F.3d at 408\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (internal quotation marks omitted).

As explained above, the\n   <em>\n    Sea Clammers\n   </em>\n   Court reviewed the savings clauses only in the context of whether the plaintiffs could bring claims-outside of the statutes' citizen-suit provisions-to redress violations\n   of those statutes.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Sea Clammers\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11721902\" index=\"124\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/453/1/\">\n    453 U.S. at 15-16\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11721902\" index=\"125\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/453/1/\">\n    101 S.Ct. 2615\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Boler\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12275592\" index=\"126\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/865/391/\">\n    865 F.3d at 405\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (Supreme Court's determination about savings clauses in\n   <em>\n    Sea Clammers\n   </em>\n   \"was premised on violations of the statute[s] [themselves],\" not on constitutional violations). The context in\n   <em>\n    Mattoon\n   </em>\n   is similar to that in\n   <em>\n    Sea Clammers\n   </em>\n   : the\n   <em>\n    Mattoon\n   </em>\n   plaintiff's \u00a7 1983 claim was based on (1) an alleged violation of the SDWA, and (2) an alleged violation of an unrecognized \" 'constitutional right' to safe drinking water.\" In comparison, the context here is similar to that in\n   <em>\n    Boler\n   </em>\n   : Plaintiff's \u00a7 1983 claim is based solely on alleged violations of his due process rights.

Here, Plaintiff's \u00a7 1983 claim alleges Defendant violated his Fourteenth Amendment due process rights under the state-created danger doctrine and by violating his rights to bodily integrity and to care for and protect his grandson. Plaintiff also raised a procedural due process claim.\n   <footnotemark>\n    8\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-71\">\n   Defendant misconstrues Plaintiff's federal constitutional claim by inferring he raised a Fourteenth Amendment claim separate from his \u00a7 1983 claim. Defendant contends Plaintiff seeks redress for a Fourteenth Amendment right to clean water, which does not exist. And, even if it\n   did exist, Defendant argues the SDWA precludes that claim. In its reply brief, Defendant argues for the first time that the complaint fails to allege sufficient facts to support a substantive due process claim, but only with respect to the \"state-created danger doctrine\" and only in a perfunctory manner.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-72\">\n   The court will briefly address the proper legal framework for Plaintiff's state-created danger and bodily integrity substantive due process theories and consider whether he has standing to assert a due process claim.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Pollard v.

The court will assess Plaintiff's proposed amendments, including whether they are futile, meaning the court will consider whether the proposed amendments contain legally and factually sufficient allegations to state a plausible claim for relief.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    <em>\n     Iqbal\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3653744\" index=\"199\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/556/662/#p678\">\n     556 U.S. at 678-79\n    </extracted-citation>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3653744\" index=\"200\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/556/662/#p678\">\n     129 S.Ct. 1937\n    </extracted-citation>\n    .\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"9\">\n   <p id=\"p-120\">\n    In addition to the state-created danger doctrine, several circuits also recognize another exception to the general rule that the state does not have an affirmative duty to protect that applies if there is a \"special relationship\" between the state and the victim.
