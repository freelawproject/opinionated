Plaintiffs aver that Defendant Parrott, among others, played a role in devising, perpetrating, carrying out, marketing and/or covering up the fraudulent Mare Lease Program scheme to individual and business investors, including Plaintiffs.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   Plaintiffs aver that defendant David Plummer owned Classic Breeders, LLC.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Complaint, at \u00b6\u00b6 61-64. Classic Breeders, LLC was later acquired by GeoStar, the name was changed to ClassicStar, LLC (\"ClassicStar\").\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Complaint, at \u00b6 65. Robinson, Parrott and Ferguson owned the primary interests in GeoStar and controlled it.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Complaint, at \u00b6 40. ClassicStar's affairs were conducted through its parent and/or subsidiary companies, such as ClassicStar Farms, LLC, and ClassicStar Farms, Inc.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   , Complaint, at \u00b6 67. The Mare Lease Programs were represented as a method of participating in the thoroughbred horse industry, wherein a participant would (1) lease the rights to a mare for a breeding season, (2) select a stallion nomination to sire a foal with the leased mare and (3) retain or sell the resulting - and presumably extremely valuable - thoroughbred foal.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Complaint at \u00b6 54. The purported arrangement usually included the price of board and insurance for the mare and/or resultant foal.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   This lease arrangement was touted as having beneficial tax consequences\n   for the participant, which were represented by the defendants to be compliant with the Internal Revenue Code.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   , Complaint, at \u00b6\u00b6 71, 85, 92, 113, 131.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   After GeoStar's acquisition of Classic Breeders, LLC, ClassicStar began selling many more Mare Lease Programs than the thoroughbred interests owned by ClassicStar could support.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   , Complaint, at \u00b6 5, 68, 99. Defendants, including Parrott, intentionally oversold the Mare Lease Programs knowing that ClassicStar, ClassicStar Farms, LLC or ClassicStar Farms, Inc. did not own enough thoroughbred mare interests sufficient to support the number of Mare Lease Programs sold.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Complaint, at \u00b6 6. The defendants, including the Parrott, worked together to aggressively market the Mare Lease Programs to individuals and business with significant incomes and assets, despite the fact that they knew that ClassicStar, ClassicStar Farms, LLC or ClassicStar Farms, Inc. did not own enough thoroughbred mare interests sufficient to support the number of Mare Lease Programs sold.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   , Complaint, at \u00b6\u00b6 2, 68, 99.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   These parties frequently sent correspondence, made or received telephone calls, and certainly received funds from investors using the mail and wires, all in order to make this plan work. In order to conceal the fact that the Programs were unsustainable, participants were urged by defendants to exchange their Mare Lease Program interests for other supposedly valuable business opportunities with entities related to and/or controlled by defendants and obscuring the fact that the exact same mares were being marketed and leased to multiple investors at the same time.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   , Complaint, at \u00b6 5, 111.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   For his part, Parrott owned a \"primary interest\" in GeoStar, was an officer and/or director of GEEI, took \"active roles in the management of ClassicStar's sale and promotion of the Mare Lease Programs,\" including the review of marketing materials and the negotiation of commission contracts with salespeople.

He argues, as well, (3) that the RICO claims would also fail because they fail to plead the underlying predicate acts with the particularity required by Fed. R. Civ. P. 9(b) and that (4) the 1962(a) claim fails because Plaintiffs have not pleaded an injury directly related to the investment or use of illegally obtained income. Parrott next argues that (5) Plaintiffs' Colorado Organized Crime Control Act (\"COCCA\") claims fail for the same reason as their RICO claims; (6) Plaintiffs' fraud claims\n   fail for failure to state their claims against him with the particularity required by Fed. R. Civ. P. 9(b) ; (7) Plaintiffs' negligent misrepresentation claims fail as they have not alleged misrepresentations made by him; (8) Plaintiffs' civil theft claim fails because their fraud claims against him fail; (9) Plaintiffs' accounting claim fails because they have not properly alleged that Parrott entered into a contract with, owed a fiduciary duty to, or received property from Plaintiffs; and (10) Plaintiffs' fraudulent transfer claims against him should be denied.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   <strong>\n    A.

Here, Plaintiffs aver that defendant violated the statute by using money derived from alleged racketeering activity, which is a violation of 1962(a), acquired or maintained an interest or control of an alleged enterprise, which is a violation of 1962(b), and conducted the affairs of an enterprise with which he was associated by soliciting investments through mail fraud, which is a violation of 1962(c), as well as participation in a conspiracy to violate RICO, a violation of\n   <extracted-citation index=\"9\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201962\">\n    18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1962\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (d). The Complaint alleges that: (1) the RICO defendants constituted an Enterprise affecting interstate commerce; (2) each of the RICO defendants was associated with or employed by the enterprise and each conspired to and did as part of that employment or association conduct or participate in the conduct of the Enterprise affairs through engaging in a pattern of racketeering activity in order to misappropriate Plaintiffs' significant investments as income derived from the Enterprise; (3) each of the RICO defendants conspired to and did derive income from a pattern of racketeering activity (including mail fraud), some of which was used to operate the Enterprise, enabling the Enterprise to defraud Plaintiffs; and (4) that the RICO defendants' actions violated\n   <extracted-citation index=\"10\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201962\">\n    18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1962\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

The Court disagrees, however, with his assertion that there can be no RICO claim in this case because the alleged enterprise consists merely of a corporate entity (\n   <em>\n    i.e.\n   </em>\n   , Classicstar) associated with its own employees or agents carrying on the regular affairs of the corporation.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"10526538,3474877\" index=\"33\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/883/132/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   , at 7.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   The \"enterprise\" alleged is not ClassicStar, but rather the \"Mare Lease Marketing Enterprise,\" which was comprised of the following \"persons\": David Plummer, Spencer Plummer, Tony Ferguson, John Parrot, Thom Robinson, ClassicStar, LLC, ClassicStar Farms, LLC, ClassicStar Thoroughbreds of Kentucky, ClassicStar 2004, ClassicStar 2004 Powerfoal Stable, ClassicStar 2005 PowerFoal Stables, ClassicStar 2003 Racing Partnership, GeoStar Corp., FEEP, GeoStar Equine Energy, Inc., GeoStar Financial Services, NELC, New NEL, Terry Green and Strategic Opportunity Solutions, LLC.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Complaint, 60, 425-435. Thus, Parrott, the other moving defendants whose requests for relief are now moot, and individuals and entities entirely unrelated to ClassicStar, such as Terry Green, are the persons forming the Mare Lease Marketing Enterprise. While, under the \"distinctness\" requirement, a corporation may not be liable under section 1962(c) for participating in the affairs of an enterprise that consists only of its own subdivisions, agents, or members, and cannot join with its own members to undertake \"regular corporate activity\" and thereby become an enterprise distinct from itself,\n   <em>\n    Davis v.

The distinctiveness requirement is met because the Mare Lease Marketing Enterprise consisted of several entities and individuals, including those outside the chain of corporate ownership of ClassicStar, GeoStar and other ostensibly related entity defendants. Moreover, the activities of the Mare Lease Marketing Enterprise were not the \"regular corporate activities\" of ClassicStar, which were purportedly breeding, raising and boarding thoroughbred horses, and the like.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    e.g.\n   </em>\n   , Complaint \u00b6\u00b6 72, 82-84. Thus, the Complaint adequately pleads the element of \"enterprise.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   That the conspirators include related corporations, such as GeoStar and ClassicStar, and their officers, directors, managers and/or employees, such as Ferguson, Robinson and Parrott, does not, without more, mean that there is no distinction between the \"persons\" and the \"enterprise.\" For example, taking the averments of the Complaint as true, GeoStar and ClassicStar are separate and distinct legal entities, and thus separate and distinct \"persons\" for RICO purposes. Similarly, Ferguson, Robinson and Parrott are both corporate owners/employees and natural persons, and they are distinct from the corporation itself, a legally separate entity with different rights on the facts before this Court.

Defendants pointing their fingers at one another does not change that Plaintiffs have averred in detail the sale of Mare Lease Programs consisting primarily of thoroughbred breeding pairs that either did not exist or whose values were so inflated as to make them wholly fictional. The Programs were nonetheless sold through promotion of both their great profit potential and their alleged tax benefits, and Parrott, among others, played a role in inducing the Plaintiffs to participate in the Programs, then accepted the benefits of the Plaintiffs' participation with knowledge of the underlying fraud.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   Parrott's alleged involvement in this scheme is averred in sufficient detail as to give him more than fair notice of the behavior underlying his respective liability.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Michaels Building Co. v.

Parrott, along with Robinson, was alleged to have been actively involved in the promotion of the Mare Lease Programs, engaging salespeople to promote the programs, reviewing and approving marketing materials containing the baseless projected returns, and obtaining opinion letters from various professionals to vouch for the tax aspects of\n   the Programs. It is enough to plead, as here, that he did so with knowledge of the overselling and other fraudulent aspects of the Programs. Parrott also vouched for the FEEP transaction by allowing himself to be identified as a member of FEEP's advisory committee, thus inducing participants as to the stability of the FEEP alternative. In addition, Plaintiffs aver that Parrott accepted the proceeds of the fraudulent scheme with knowledge of the fraud. This is enough to satisfy the pleading with particularity requirement of Rule 9(b) and state a claim against Parrott.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Michaels\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1783453\" index=\"46\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/848/674/#p679\">\n    848 F.2d at 679\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (principal purpose of Rule 9(b) is to ensure that defendant receives fair notice of the alleged misconduct in order to prepare a responsive pleading).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   In considering a motion to dismiss a complaint based on a similarly structured scheme, the United States Court of Appeals for the Eighth Circuit noted \"no one fact in isolation demonstrates that there was a scheme to defraud.

By funneling the Enterprise money to GeoStar and to NELC, particularly by way of the circular loan structure and FEEP interest exchanges, the defendants worked to conceal their fraudulent activities by obscuring the actual value of the equine interests and the Mare Lease Programs, thus, making it more difficult for Plaintiffs to initially uncover the scheme and to ultimately recover their money.

Because Plaintiffs' Complaint alleges an enterprise, properly pleads an \"investment injury\" and is sufficiently particularly plead as to the RICO claims, the COCCA claims are sufficient and Parrott's motion to dismiss will be denied. Similarly, because the predicate acts of fraud for the purposes of RICO are sufficiently pleaded, Parrott's motion to dismiss claims of fraud and claims of theft by deception and, for that matter, his argument that there is no need for an accounting of his gains from these torts fail. If Parrott reviewed and approved of marketing materials used by ClassicStar, including the falsely stated projected returns and misleading attorney opinion letters, he could have anticipated that participants would rely on those materials, as well as FEEP documents, for example, in deciding to participate in the Programs. Plaintiffs aver that they did. The pleading concerning the scheme in the Complaint, notably the fraudulent representations and Parrott's connection to it all, is enough to show that the claims are plausible on their face and permit the Court to draw the reasonable inference that Parrott is liable for the misconduct alleged.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Fed.
