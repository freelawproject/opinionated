Pl.'s Mem., Ex. 1, Yianacopolus Compl., ECF No. 26-1. He alleged that in the early morning hours of August 19, 2014, outside the front door of the Club, Cohne \"suddenly,\" \"without any warning,\" and \"without provocation\" committed an assault and battery against him.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6\u00b6 7-10. \"A short time later,\" Yianacopolus alleged, Cohne followed him \"out onto the street and committed\" a second assault and battery against him, \"using a baton as a weapon.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 11. Yianacopolus alleged that Cohne was \"at all times ... acting within the scope of his employment\n   duties\" and \"under the direction and control\" of BBC.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6\u00b6 12-13.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   Yianacopolus brought both a negligence and a civil assault and battery claim against Cohne.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6\u00b6 15-19, 26-30. In the negligence claim, Yianacopolus alleged that Cohne's breach of his duty to use reasonable care as a doorman caused Yianacopolus' injury.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6\u00b6 16-19. Yianacopolus further alleged that at all relevant times he \"exercised reasonable care for his own safety.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 18.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   In July 2018, Cohne's attorneys deposed Yianacopolus. Pl.'s Mem., Ex. 3, Yianacopolus Dep., ECF No. 26-3. There, Yianacopolus testified that he entered the Club at around eleven o'clock p.m. on the night of the incident and consumed alcohol.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 37:10-24. He stated that at some point \"around closing time\" he left.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 51:7-8. He testified that as he was trying to re-enter the Club to speak with a woman whom he had met earlier,\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 53:3-19, 71:11-21, Cohne, who was working at the door,\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 58:8-18, \"negligently used excessive force\" by \"striking [him] in the face,\"\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 64:20-65:18.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   During his deposition, Yianacopolus agreed that a bouncer has an obligation to ensure the safety of patrons of the establishment for which he works,\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 65:19-66:8, and clarified that the basis of his negligence claim is Cohne's failure to undertake safer alternatives to keep him out of the club and his assessment that Cohne used force \"above and beyond what a bouncer should do in that situation,\"\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 67:8-20. Yianacopolus was not able to provide specific examples of safer alternatives, but suggested that verbal warnings, which he claims Cohne failed to provide, would have been better than \"his fist.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 66:15-70:8.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   In May 2018, Cohne provided sworn answers to interrogatories from BBC about the incident at the core of Yianacopolus' complaint. Pl.'s Mem., Ex. 4, Cohne's Answers Interrogs. (\"Cohne's Answers\") 3, ECF No. 26-4. Cohne stated that Yianacopolus \"appeared to be intoxicated\" when \"attempting to enter the [C]lub by pushing his way through the inside hallway.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Cohne stated that he began by verbally telling Yianacopolus not to enter, but Yianacopolus \"proceeded to throw his shoulder into [him] while making threatening remarks.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Cohne claimed that he then \"made physical contact\" with Yianacopolus in a continued effort to prevent him from going inside, after which \"Yianacopolus subsequently threw a punch at [him].\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Cohne stated that at that point he \"feared for [his] own personal safety,\" so he again \"made physical contact with [Yianacopolus].\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   2.\n   <strong>\n    The Maltacea Action\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   In July 2017, Maltacea sued Cohne and BBC. Maltacea Compl. Maltacea alleged that on the early morning of August 10, 2014, Cohne, while acting as a bouncer of the Club and \"in the due course of his employment ... without provocation, right, or reason, struck and beat [Maltacea] with a metal baton and caused [him] severe physical injuries.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6\u00b6 9-10. Maltacea's complaint against Cohne includes one count of \"Negligent and Excessive Force,\" which alleges that Cohne \"negligently caused and did cause a harmful contact with [Maltacea]'s person.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6\u00b6 27-31.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   3.\n   <strong>\n    Navigators' Policy\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   Two parts of the Policy relate to this case: the Commercial General Liability Coverage Form CG 00 01 04 13 (\"CGLC\"), Pl.'s Mem., Ex. 5, Navigators Policy 13-28, ECF No. 26-5, and the Assault And Battery And Negligent Supervision Limitation (\"Limitation\"),\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 43-44.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   The CGLC lays out the situations covered by the Policy.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 13-28.

Navigators refutes each of these arguments and contends that they have no duty to defend Cohne in either action.\n   <em>\n    See generally\n   </em>\n   Def.'s Opp'n. The Court concludes that Navigators is correct, but rests on somewhat different reasoning than that Navigators advances.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-51\">\n   <strong>\n    A.

For example, the CGLC provides in section II, \"WHO IS AN INSURED,\" that \"your 'volunteer workers' ... or your 'employees' \" could count as an insured for \"acts within the scope of their employment by you.\" Navigators Policy 21-22.
