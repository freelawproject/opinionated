Scott Coogler, United States District Judge\n  </author>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   Before the Court is Plaintiff Canal Insurance Company's (\"Canal\") motion for summary judgment. (Doc. 25.) The motion has been briefed and is ripe for review. For the reasons stated below, Canal's motion for summary judgment (doc. 25) is due to be denied.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   <strong>\n    I. BACKGROUND\n   </strong>\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   This is a declaratory judgment action seeking a determination of the parties' respective rights and obligations under an insurance policy issued by Canal to Defendant Alan Farmer Trucking, Inc. (\"Alan Farmer\"). Defendant Sheridan Logistics, Inc. (\"Sheridan\") is listed as an additional insured in the policy. On September 14, 2017, Defendant Michael Butler (\"Butler\") filed an underlying state court action against Alan Farmer and Sheridan. In the state court action, Butler alleges that he was injured while working as an independent contractor transporting military vehicles for Alan Farmer and Sheridan. Butler asserts that as he was unloading a tactical vehicle from a trailer the vehicle flipped and injured him. Both Alan Farmer and Sheridan dispute that Butler had any duty to unload the vehicle.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   Although the incident that forms the basis of the underlying state court action occurred on January 9, 2017, it was not reported to Canal until October 4, 2017, after Butler filed suit. Canal is providing a conditional defense to Alan Farmer and Sheridan in the underlying action under a complete reservation of rights. In the insurance policy at issue, Canal agreed to defend Alan Farmer and Sheridan in the following provision:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-13\">\n   SECTION II - COVERED AUTOS LIABILITY COVERAGE\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   A. Coverage\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-15\">\n   We will pay all sums an \"insured\" legally must pay as damages because of \"bodily injury\" or \"property damage\" to which this insurance applies, caused by an \"accident\" and resulting from the ownership, maintenance or use of a covered \"auto.\"\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-16\">\n   ....\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-17\">\n   We have the right and duty to defend any \"insured\" against a \"suit\" asking for such damages or a \"covered pollution cost or expense\". However, we have no duty to defend any \"insured\" against a \"suit\" seeking damages for \"bodily injury\" or \"property damage\" or a \"covered pollution cost or expense\" to which this insurance does not apply.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Doc. 1-2 at 33.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   Canal's insurance coverage is subject to an \"injury to employee\" exclusion. This exclusion provides that the insurance coverage does not apply to bodily injury to an employee of the insured arising out of the employee's employment with the insured or performance of \"duties related to the conduct of the 'insured's' business.\" (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 34-35.) A separate policy provision contains the following definition of the term employee: \" 'Employee' \" includes a 'leased worker'. \" 'Employee' does not include a 'temporary worker.' \" (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 42.) Canal's insurance coverage is also subject to the following condition precedent:\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   2. Duties In The Event of Accident, Claim, Suit Or Loss\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-21\">\n   We have no duty to provide coverage under this policy unless there has been full compliance with the following duties:\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-22\">\n   a. In the event of \"accident\", claim, \"suit\" or \"loss\", you must give us or our authorized representative prompt notice of the \"accident\" or \"loss\". Include:\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-23\">\n   (1) How, when and where the \"accident\" or \"loss\" occurred;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-24\">\n   (2) The \"insured's\" name and address; and\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-25\">\n   (3) To the extent possible, the names and addresses of any injured persons and witnesses.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 39.)

The Canal policy is subject to\n   Federal Motor Carrier Safety Act regulations, which state that no motor carrier can operate a vehicle until it has obtained the required level of insurance.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"27\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=49%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%20387.7\">\n    49 C.F.R. \u00a7 387.7\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a). This is evidenced by the policy's inclusion of the federally-mandated MCS-90 endorsement. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Doc. 1-2 at 51-58.) The applicable regulations define employee as:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-37\">\n   any individual, other than an employer, who is employed by an employer and who in the course of his or her employment directly affects commercial motor vehicle safety. Such term includes a driver of a commercial motor vehicle (including an independent contractor while in the course of operating a commercial motor vehicle), a mechanic, and a freight handler. Such term does not include an employee of the United States, any State, any political subdivision of a State, or any agency established under a compact between States and approved by the Congress of the United States who is acting within the course of such employment.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   <extracted-citation index=\"28\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=49%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%20390.5\">\n    49 C.F.R. \u00a7 390.5\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . According to Canal, as the underlying state court complaint identifies Butler as an independent contractor for Alan Farmer and Sheridan, Butler is a \"statutory employee\" under the federal regulations and the \"injury to employee\" exclusions apply to his claims.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   The Court disagrees with Canal's contention that the \"statutory employee\" definition should be read into the policy. The Canal policy already includes a definition of employee. It states that \" '[e]mployee includes a 'leased worker'. 'Employee' does not include a 'temporary worker'.\" (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Doc. 1-2 at 42.)\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   This definition includes no reference to the federal regulations and provides no indication that the parties intended to use the \"statutory employee\" definition.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   The majority of courts to address this issue have concluded that the federal \"statutory employee\" definition does not apply where the policy itself supplies its own definition of employee.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    Gramercy Ins.

In both\n   <em>\n    Progressive Mountain Insurance Company v. Madd Transportation, LLC\n   </em>\n   , 633 Fed. App'x 744 (11th Cir. 2015), and\n   <em>\n    Lancer Insurance Company v.

Ala. 2012), the courts did not consider whether the \"statutory employee\" definition should be used where an insurance policy already included a definition of employee. Instead, key to the\n   <em>\n    Progressive Mountain\n   </em>\n   holding was that \"there [was] no indication that the term 'employee' [was] used differently in the [MCS-90] endorsement than in the employee exclusion.\"\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Progressive Mountain\n   </em>\n   , 633 Fed. App'x at 746. This distinction is important. The fact that the Canal policy includes a definition of employee that does not reference the federal motor carrier safety regulations provides an indication that they were not meant to supply the policy's definition of \"employee.\" If the Court were to find that the federal \"statutory employee\" definition applied, it would be upsetting the expectations of the parties, who contracted for a definition of employee that did not include a reference to the federal regulations. As the Court must interpret the policy so as to give effect to the parties' intentions, it concludes that the federal \"statutory employee\" definition should not be incorporated into the Canal policy's \"injury to employee\" exclusions.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   Because the Court has determined that the federal \"statutory employee\" definition does not apply to the Canal policy's exclusions, the Court need not determine whether Butler was acting as \"an independent contractor while in the course of operating a commercial motor vehicle.\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"32\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=49%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%20390.5\">\n    49 C.F.R. \u00a7 390.5\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Instead, to determine whether the \"injury to employee\" exclusion applies, the Court must look to both the policy's definition of employee and the common understanding of the term. Nothing in the underlying state court complaint suggests that Butler was acting as a leased worker. Moreover, in the underlying complaint, Butler identifies himself as \"an independent contractor retained by defendants Sheridan Logistics, Inc. and/or Alan Farmer Trucking.\" (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Doc. 1-1 at 3.) Canal refers to him as such, and Sheridan identifies Butler as working as an independent contractor for it at the time of his injury. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Doc. 30-2 at 3.) Applying the Canal policy as written, and giving the term \"employee\" its \"common, everyday meaning,\"\n   <em>\n    Brown\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7052650\" index=\"33\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-3d/26/1167/#p1169\">\n    26 So.3d 1167\n   </extracted-citation>\n   at 1169, the Court finds that the term \"employee\" as defined and used in the \"injury to employee exclusion\" does not include an independent contractor like Butler.

The Canal policy provides that prompt notification is a condition precedent to Canal's duty to defend. Specifically, the policy states: \"[i]n the event of 'accident', claim, 'suit' or 'loss', you must give us or our authorized representative prompt notice of the 'accident' or 'loss'.\" (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Doc. 1-2 at 39.)

Instead, it focuses its argument on the length of time between when Butler sustained his injuries and when Canal was informed of the incident. Butler was injured on January 9, 2017, and Sheridan's chief operating officer was notified of the incident that same day. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Doc. 29-2 at 2.) The parties agree that Canal was first notified of the incident on October 4, 2017 (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Doc. 28 at 3.) Thus, the length of delay between the incident and Canal's notification was a little less than ten months. The Alabama Supreme Court has found similar, unexcused delays to be unreasonable as a matter of law.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Pharr v. Continental Cas.

In such case notice is not required until some claim within the coverage of the policy has been presented or is reasonably to be anticipated, in which event the requirement as to notice is satisfied if notice is given within a reasonable time after the situation assumes an aspect suggestive of a possible claim for damages. Clearly, notice is necessary when there has been such an occurrence as would lead a reasonable and prudent\n   man to believe that it might give rise to a claim for damages.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   <em>\n    Pan Am.

The Canal policy defines \"accident\" to include \"continuous or repeated exposure to the same conditions resulting in 'bodily injury' or 'property damage'.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 41.) The Alabama Supreme Court has interpreted \"accident\" in the insurance context to mean \"[a]n unintended and unforeseen injurious occurrence; something that does not occur in the usual course of events or that could not be reasonably anticipated.\"\n   <em>\n    Hartford Cas. Ins. Co. v. Merch. &amp; Farmers Bank\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8427388\" index=\"46\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-2d/928/1006/#p1009\">\n    928 So.2d 1006\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 1011 (Ala. 2005) (internal quotation marks omitted). In other words, an accident refers to \"something unforeseen, unexpected, or unusual.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8427388\" index=\"47\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-2d/928/1006/#p1009\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   (internal quotation marks omitted). The Court has no trouble concluding that a military vehicle unexpectedly falling from a trailer and injuring Butler constitutes an accident under Alabama law.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-51\">\n   However, even when an accident occurs, delayed notification is excusable where a reasonably prudent person in the insured's position would have no reason \"to believe ... that a claim for damages [would] arise or that the injury is one insured against.\"\n   <em>\n    Pan Am. Fire &amp; Cas. Co.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"2555085\" index=\"48\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ala/289/206/\">\n    266 So. 2d at 771\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Using this line of reasoning, Alan Farmer and Sheridan argue that any delay in providing notice to Canal was reasonable under the circumstances. Sheridan's chief operating officer, Michael Farmer, testified that while he knew about this incident on the date it occurred that he did not believe there had been an \"accident\" under the Canal policy because the military vehicle sustained only nominal damage and there was no damage to any property owned by Alan Farmer or Sheridan. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Doc. 29-2 at 2.) Farmer also testified that he had no knowledge that Butler was contemplating bringing claims against Alan Farmer or Sheridan until the underlying lawsuit was filed. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 3-4.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-52\">\n   The Court cannot say, as a matter law, that the delay in providing Canal with notice was unreasonable under the circumstances. Alan Farmer and Sheridan apparently suffered little to no property damage from this incident. Additionally, Canal has presented no evidence of when Alan Farmer and Sheridan were informed that Butler sustained injuries. Indeed, there is no evidence in the record of when Alan Farmer, the primary insured, was first notified of the accident. Where the insured has no reason to believe an accident will result in a legal claim for damages, there is no duty to notify the insurer about the incident. To hold otherwise would, as Alan Farmer and Sheridan argue, essentially impose a burden on the insured to provide its insurance company with almost daily notice. Such a requirement is not created by the Canal policy, and this Court does not find that, as a matter of law, the ten month delay in notification was unreasonable.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-53\">\n   Canal also points to the fact that Sheridan was in contact with Butler's attorney as evidence that the delay in notification was unreasonable as a matter of law. Canal states that the Alabama Supreme Court's holding in\n   <em>\n    Thomas\n   </em>\n   is instructive. In\n   <em>\n    Thomas\n   </em>\n   , two weeks after the insured was notified that a cable he strung had injured a passerby, the injured party's attorney informed the insured that he intended to bring suit.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Thomas\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9667841\" index=\"49\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-2d/334/879/#p883\">\n    334 So.2d 879\n   </extracted-citation>\n   at 881.The attorney's letter specifically suggested that the insured notify his homeowner insurance carrier of his client's claims.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9667841\" index=\"50\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-2d/334/879/#p883\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   Despite receiving this letter and repeated reminders from his own attorney to check into whether his homeowner's policy would cover the accident, the insured waited approximately six months after the accident to notify his insurer of the incident.\n   <em>\n    See\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9667841\" index=\"51\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-2d/334/879/#p883\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-54\">\n   The court held that the insured's subjective belief that suit would not be filed was unreasonable and that he violated his insurance policy's notification requirement as a matter of law.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9667841\" index=\"52\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-2d/334/879/#p883\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9667841\" index=\"52\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-2d/334/879/#p883\">\n    at 885\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . The court reasoned that the plain language of the letter received by the insured clearly indicated that claims would be brought against him.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9667841\" index=\"53\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-2d/334/879/#p883\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9667841\" index=\"53\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-2d/334/879/#p883\">\n    at 884\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . As the court noted, \"[i]t was not the insured's duty under the terms of the policy to determine the probability of suit being filed; it was his duty to give the insurer notice of any accident or occurrence and to forward to the insurer every demand within a reasonable time.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9667841\" index=\"54\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-2d/334/879/#p883\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9667841\" index=\"54\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-2d/334/879/#p883\">\n    at 885\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-55\">\n   Here, it was not as evident that Butler would pursue claims against Alan Farmer and Sheridan. It is undisputed that prior to filing suit an attorney retained by Butler requested that Sheridan allow Butler to have an expert inspect the trailer and power unit involved in the incident. However, according to Farmer's affidavit, Butler's attorney \"never said or implied anything to suggest that Butler would sue [Alan Farmer] or Sheridan.\" (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Doc. 29-2 at 3.) Thus, Farmer states that he believed that \"any claim Butler might have would be against the manufacturer of the trailer.\" (\n   <em>\n    See\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9667841\" index=\"55\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-2d/334/879/#p883\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   ) Reasonable minds could differ as to whether these communications with Butler's attorney should have put Alan Farmer and Sheridan on notice that Butler might bring claims against them. Moreover, based on the evidence before the Court, it is unclear when Butler's attorney first contacted Sheridan. Although Farmer's affidavit states that it took several months to set up the requested inspection, there is no evidence of the exact date Butler's attorney contacted Sheridan or when the inspection occurred. Without a more definite timeline, the Court cannot make a decision as to whether the prompt notification requirement was satisfied. Therefore, the Court is unwilling to hold that the delay in notifying Canal was unreasonable as a matter of law.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-56\">\n   <strong>\n    IV.
