The intent of the agreement is undoubtedly clear and unmistakable to the authors, most likely employers, but the intent is obfuscated, possibly intentionally, for the employee unless the employee happens to know the AAA rules, a ridiculous assumption, or takes the time to read the rules and specifically notices, among all the other rules, the rule permitting the arbitrator to determine gateway issues.

The Agreement's arbitration provision covers any \"disagreement relating in any way to\n   <em>\n    services, accounts\n   </em>\n   or matters; to [Stone's] use of any of the Bank's\n   <em>\n    banking locations\n   </em>\n   or facilities; or to\n   <em>\n    any means [she] may use to access [her] accounts.\n   </em>\n   \" ECF 5-2 at 8 (emphases added). Plaintiff contends that Counts VII, VIII, and IX do not relate to the Agreement. Rather, they relate to her claim that Wells Fargo caused her \"to be wrongfully charged with a crime she did not commit.\" ECF 8, \u00b6 5. These criminal charges, she contends, are \"wholly unrelated\n   to\" the Agreement.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 6. Further, Stone argues that these counts are not arbitrable \"because they do not relate or have anything to do with\" her accounts with Wells Fargo. ECF 8, \u00b6 4. The Agreement's arbitration provision pertains to the accounts she opened, but she did not open the accounts at issue in Counts VII-IX.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-87\">\n   In Count VII, Stone contends that Wells Fargo negligently hired and supervised its employee. ECF 1, \u00b6\u00b6 42-47. Stone alleges that Wells Fargo,\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 45:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-88\">\n   \"knew or should have known its Agents would, or had a propensity to, improperly change the Plaintiff's banking information and Accounts, improperly accept and receive debit cards approved for the Plaintiff and improperly approve large cash withdrawals, improperly investigation allegations of wrongdoing against the Plaintiff related to Plaintiff[']s relationship with the Defendant and Plaintiff's Accounts and improperly accuse the Plaintiff of illegal and/or fraudulent activity and otherwise fail to follow standard practices[.]\"\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-89\">\n   Count VII lies within the ambit of the Agreement's arbitration provision. The alleged negligence of the Wells Fargo employee amounts to a dispute concerning Wells Fargo's services and is therefore arbitrable. Similarly, the dispute as to the employee changing the banking information and accounts is closely related to Stone's means of accessing her Bank accounts and services of the Bank.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-90\">\n   In Count VIII, Stone alleges \"respondeat superior,\" claiming that defendant is liable for the acts and omissions of its employees as described in Count VII. ECF 1, \u00b6\u00b6 48-53. Therefore, Count VIII turns on the same allegations underlying Count VII and is arbitrable for the same reasons.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-91\">\n   Plaintiff alleges in Count IX that Wells Fargo is liable for \"malicious prosecution.\" ECF 1, \u00b6\u00b6 54-62. Stone maintains that \"an investigation and claims by Defendant's agent, Margaret 'Peggy' Stanton and statements by Defendant's Agent Joshua Kahn, caused Anne Arundel County Police-Criminal Investigation Division to file an application for statement of charges on December 17, 2014,\" against plaintiff.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 55. As a consequence, an arrest warrant was issued for Stone, who turned herself into custody and was released pending prosecution.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 56-57. The Complaint alleges that \"Defendant and/or its Agents acted with malice and without any probable cause in causing the warrant to be issued and the Plaintiff to be prosecuted\" even though they \"knew the Plaintiff had not committed any crime.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 60-61.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-92\">\n   Count IX is also subject to arbitration. There is a significant relationship between the events that allegedly underlie Stone's malicious prosecution claim and her use of Wells Fargo banking services and accounts.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   ECF 8-4. For example, the Anne Arundel Police Department's Statement of Charges relies heavily on plaintiff's use of Wells Fargo's banking locations and the services she received there. Indeed, the Department's interview of Kahn pertained almost exclusively to events occurring at a Wells Fargo location and services provided by a Wells Fargo employee.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 9-11. As a consequence, Count IX is arbitrable.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-93\">\n   <strong>\n    D.
