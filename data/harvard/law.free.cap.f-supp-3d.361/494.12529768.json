Factual Background\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   On or about July 13, 2004, Brennan, a Christian, was hired by Payce, Inc. (\"Payce\") as a Software Engineer. ECF 1-4, \u00b6 1. Prior to 2017, Payce \"became a subsidiary and an affiliate of\" Deluxe.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 2. Deluxe then \"took control of day to day operations\" at Payce, \"including the management of Payce employees.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   Deluxe \"is a Minnesota Corporation which, at all times relevant, conducted business in Maryland.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 3. According to plaintiff, Deluxe \"is a joint employer\" with Payce, \"because ... it exercised control over [Brennan's] compensation, hours and terms of employment.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 4. Among other things, Deluxe required Payce to follow \"Deluxe's Code of Ethics and Business Conduct.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 5.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   Of relevance here, Deluxe \"required employees to take an online Ethics Compliance course,\" which \"required\" employees to respond to \"multiple choice questions.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 6. The course \"was structured to accept only those responses acceptable to\" Deluxe.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 7. \"When a response was entered which [wa]s not acceptable to\" Deluxe, \"the Ethics Compliance course refused to allow the employee to continue to the next question.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Nor could an employee \"skip any questions.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   On or about March 24, 2017, Brennan \"proceeded to take the Ethics Compliance Course.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 8. \"When Plaintiff entered his choices to [the] question labeled 'Bad Behavior,' relating to transgender issues, the course did not agree with Plaintiff's choices.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 9.

Thereafter, he \"requested that he be excused from completing the Ethics Compliance course as an accommodation to his religious beliefs.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 11. Deluxe denied Brennan's request.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 12.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   Moreover, on January 19, 2018, Deluxe \"advised [Brennan] that he would receive a 1% salary reduction as a disciplinary action for failing to complete the Ethics Compliance course.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Thereafter, on April 20, 2018, Deluxe \"directed\" Payce to \"terminate the Plaintiff.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 13.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   Plaintiff filed a Charge of Discrimination with the U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (\"EEOC\") on February 5, 2018.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 14.

Now as I understand it, Deluxe's policy requires employees to address a person using pronouns reflecting the sex that the person identifies him/herself with, and not necessarily the sex they were born as; For example, in the hypothetical example in the course, Alex is a man but desires to become a woman, so in that case Deluxe would expect employees to use 'her' referring to Alex, and not 'him.'\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-53\">\n   Let me be quite clear on this. I will never be following this guideline. If God has created someone as a man, I will use the pronoun 'him' to refer to that person, or if God created someone as a woman, I will use the pronoun 'her' to refer to that person.

Moreover, he asserts that \"the Court, at this point, cannot entertain Defendant's assertions because it is required to view the allegations of the complaint in the light most favorable to the Plaintiff.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 5.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-91\">\n   Although Brennan does not attempt to refute Deluxe's proffered legitimate, non-discriminatory reason, his failure-to-accommodate claim stands at this juncture.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    Abeles\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12390969\" index=\"209\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-appx/676/170/#p176\">\n    676 F.
