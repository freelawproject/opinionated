D.E. 7.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   THE COURT has considered the pertinent portions of the record and is otherwise fully advised in the premises. For the reasons discussed below, Rapture's Sherman Act claims are dismissed with prejudice, and its state-law claims are dismissed without prejudice.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   On February 4, 2019, the Court dismissed Rapture's initial complaint\n   <em>\n    sua sponte\n   </em>\n   . D.E. 5. On February 12, Rapture filed the amended complaint, and it comes no closer to stating a claim than the first did. Rapture's amended complaint is little more than a list of reasons why Rapture thinks the Ultra music festival is no good. But the legal claims attached to that list are incidental; like a rickety soapbox, they serve no purpose other than to hoist Rapture's list of grievances into court and, from there, into the public's view.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   The Sherman Act claims, in particular, are not proper claims for the facts alleged. They are, simply put, baseless. And the Court will not clutter its busy docket with a case that relies on the Sherman Act for federal jurisdiction when the facts, as stated and if proven, would clearly not amount to a restraint of trade, illegal monopolization, or a conspiracy within the meaning of the antitrust laws. The Court does not, however, take the position that Rapture could not possibly state a claim under some state law, and accordingly the Court will not dismiss the state law claims with prejudice.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   <em>\n    <strong>\n     BACKGROUND\n    </strong>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   These facts come from the amended complaint (D.E. 7) and, at this stage, are taken as true.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   Plaintiff, YMD Records, (\"Rapture\"), produces the Rapture music festival, which for the past two years, has been held on Virginia Key in March. D.E. 7 \u00b6\u00b6 12, 13. Defendants Ultra Enterprises (\"Ultra\") and Event Entertainment Group (\"EEG\") run the Ultra music festival, which until September 2018, was held annually at the Bayfront Park in Miami.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 17. In September 2018, Ultra was forced to look for a new location after the city of Miami voted against Ultra returning to the Bayfront Park location.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 18.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   In January 2018, Defendant Virginia Key Beach Trust (the \"Trust\"), published a letter from its executive director stating that the Trust welcomed a three-year plan for Rapture to perform at Virginia Beach Park and expressing the \"intention [ ] for the event to be held at this venue for the next 3 years.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   , ex. A. And so, on March 11, 2018, Rapture submitted its application to hold its music festival at Virginia Key Beach during the last weekend of March 2019.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   , ex B. Then, in October 2018, Rapture paid its application fee and deposit for the beach park.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 44. Rapture expected that the City of Miami (the \"City\") would hold a hearing on its application in November 2018, as it had done in previous years.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 29. But City officials\n   told Rapture that its approval hearing would not occur in November.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 35.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   Instead, in November, the City planning commission met and voted to allow Ultra to host its music festival on Virginia Key during the last weekend of March 2019.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 38. At that meeting, certain City officials misled the commission by saying that Rapture had not paid its deposit.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 41. Someone somehow prevented Rapture from correcting this error (the complaint does not say who or how).\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 42. Sometime after this meeting, someone informed Rapture (again, the complaint does not say who) that there is no way for its application to be approved.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 48.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   Rapture alleges that the City's approval of the Ultra music festival for the last weekend in March arose out of a meeting between Defendants in October 2018, to which Rapture was not invited.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 25. After that meeting, the City planning commission met to discuss the November hearing where they would vote on Ultra's application.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 31. At that meeting, certain City officials misled other officials\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   by saying that Rapture's festival had been canceled or rescheduled.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 32.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   Rapture alleges that the misleading information presented at the two commission meetings was part of a conspiracy between all Defendants to block Rapture from holding its festival.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 49, 50. It appears (although the amended complaint is far from clear) that the City and Trust conspired to block Rapture's festival because Ultra agreed to pay them a $ 2 million license fee.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 53, 54. As further evidence that the City and Trust were conspiring to replace Rapture's festival, Rapture alleges that the Ultra festival was disruptive, dirty, and bad for the \"delicate environment\" of Virginia Key.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 55. The decision to allow the Ultra festival at the \"environmentally friendly\" beach park, therefore, was \"ridiculous[ ]\" and \"a signal of an antitrust violation and unfair competition.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 58.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   Rapture alleges that this conspiracy caused it a litany\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   of damages including lost relationships and goodwill with DJs, vendors, and ticket purchasers.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 82-98.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   <em>\n    <strong>\n     LEGAL STANDARD\n    </strong>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 8(a)(2) provides that a plaintiff's pleading \"must contain ... a short and plain statement of the claim showing that the pleader is entitled to relief.\" Fed.

Apr. 29, 2008) (dismissing FDUTPA claims where plaintiffs based all FDUTPA allegations on violations of state and federal statutes that the court had already considered and rejected, thus there could be no FDUTPA violation). Additionally, Rapture fails to explain who made the allegedly false statements to the city commission, whether Ultra and EEG had any hand in causing those misrepresentations to be made, and whether those misrepresentations caused the City commission to give the venue and date to Ultra.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Blackhawk\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"84\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2013%20WL%2012199875\">\n    2013 WL 12199875\n   </extracted-citation>\n   at *4 (dismissing a FDUPTA claim because the plaintiff \"fail[ed] to specify precisely what statements were made; whether the statements were oral or written; the person(s) who made the statements ... the content of each statement; and the manner in which each statement misled the Plaintiff\").

Rapture does not allege that its application has been denied or that it could not hold its festival at another time or nearby venue.

And in fact, Rapture alleges that sometime in the last two weeks, the City asked Rapture to provide dates for its planned festival. D.E. 7 \u00b6 45.

First, Rapture does not allege that these two Defendants did anything to interfere with its prospective interest in holding its festival at Virginia Key during the last weekend in March. The only allegation about these two Defendants is that they met with the City and Trust in October and discussed holding the Ultra festival at that venue and time. But critically, Rapture does not allege that these Defendants made false statements to the city commission, instructed or otherwise arranged for the unidentified \"city officials\" to do so, or in any other way interfered with Rapture's anticipated festival venue and time.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   D.E. 7 \u00b6\u00b6 32, 41. Second, even if Ultra and EEG did attempt to convince the City and Trust to give Rapture's venue and time to Ultra, that effort falls within the privilege of interference because Rapture does not allege that it was contractually entitled to that venue and time.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-61\">\n   As to the fourth element, damages, Rapture's claim fails for the same reason its FDUPTA claim fails. It damages are speculative and dependent upon its festival not happening. And Rapture has not alleged that it will not or cannot happen at a proximate venue or time. Accordingly, Rapture's final claim fails.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-62\">\n   <em>\n    <strong>\n     CONCLUSION\n    </strong>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-63\">\n   In its order dismissing the first complaint\n   <em>\n    sua sponte\n   </em>\n   , the Court warned Rapture that it would have one and only one chance to amend. D.E. 4. Rapture has now twice failed to state a claim as to these same five counts. And despite that Rapture is represented by counsel, the substantive allegations of its amended complaint are not materially different from those of its first complaint. Accordingly, the Court finds that it would be futile to permit Rapture a third bite at the apple and not in accordance with the purpose of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure \"to secure the just, speedy, and inexpensive determination of every action.\" Fed.
