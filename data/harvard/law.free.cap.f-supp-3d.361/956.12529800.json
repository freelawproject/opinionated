INTRODUCTION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   Plaintiff Morteza Benjamin Ray Karimi brought this action against Defendant Golden Gate School of Law (\"Golden Gate\") and its dean, Defendant Anthony Niedwiecki, based on disciplinary action taken against Karimi, including an indefinite interim suspension. The Court previously denied Karimi's motion for a preliminary injunction. Karimi thereafter withdrew from Golden Gate and enrolled in a different law school. Defendants now move for summary judgment, as well as sanctions against Karimi for failing to appear at his deposition. The Court found the matter suitable for resolution without oral argument and vacated the hearing on Defendants' motions. For the reasons discussed below, Defendants' motions are\n   GRANTED. The Court excludes Karimi's own declarations and testimony under Rule 37 of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, and Defendants are entitled to summary judgment on all claims.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   <strong>\n    II. BACKGROUND\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   <strong>\n    A. Karimi's First Amended Complaint\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   Karimi enrolled at Golden Gate in the summer of 2017. 1st Am. Compl. (\"FAC,\" dkt. 58) at 3. He alleges that Golden Gate did not respond appropriately when another student cursed at him in his torts class, and when that student later joined a conversation uninvited in the library and repeatedly interrupted Karimi, despite Karimi calling the San Francisco Police Department to report the incident.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 4.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   Karimi alleges that he first emailed his classmates after his torts professor canceled class before the Labor Day holiday weekend at the request of some students, and after neither the professor nor the Associate Dean of Law Student Support was receptive to Karimi's concern that class should not have been canceled.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 5. After Karimi emailed his classmates, he alleges that he was asked to speak with Niedwiecki and Assistant Dean Mark Yates, at which time Niedwiecki instructed Karimi not to use a particular communications platform known as TWEN to email his classmates, and Karimi complied with that instruction.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   Karimi alleges that he later complained to Golden Gate about professors allowing students to speak about student organizations and student government elections during class time.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   When Golden Gate did not intervene, Karimi alleges that he emailed his classmates to state his objections.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Karimi alleges that some students replied to the whole class, calling Karimi a \"coward\" and a \"bully.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 5-6.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   Karimi alleges that he emailed Niedwiecki on September 14, 2017 about a professor who Karimi believed was not calling on him or allowing him to speak in class as much as other students.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 6. Karimi alleges that Niedwiecki emailed him later the same day informing him that he was suspended indefinitely, but that Karimi did not read the email before going to class the next day, where a Golden Gate security officer told him to come to a private room and gave him a copy of the suspension email.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Karimi alleges that he called the police, who arrived and informed him that he would be trespassing if he returned to campus.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 6-7. According to Karimi, Niedwiecki then emailed the Golden Gate community regarding \"security concerns\" related to Karimi's \"behavioral issues,\" and noting that security would be increased.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 7.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   Karimi alleges that Niedwiecki later sent him an email presenting the options of withdrawal from Golden Gate or formal disciplinary procedures, and that other representatives of Golden Gate pressured him to withdraw in exchange for a refund of tuition and other expenses, but he declined to do so.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 7-8. According to Karimi, Golden Gate's counsel sent him a disciplinary complaint prepared by Niedwiecki alleging infractions based on Karimi's emails to his classmates, and later a \"Disciplinary Action Letter.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 7-8. Karimi alleges that after Golden Gate professor and administrator Dan Devoy told Karimi he would like to engage in an \"informal resolution process,\" Karimi filed his motion for a preliminary injunction in this\n   action, and Golden Gate agreed to postpone its internal disciplinary process.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 9.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   Karimi alleges that Niedwiecki \"kicked [Karimi] out of school for emails that [Karimi] had sent regarding how class time was being spent.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 2. According to Karimi, his emails to classmates regarding the use of class time were polite, did not single out particular students, and were intended to improve the quality of his education.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 3. Karimi alleges that he was humiliated by the suspension and that it violated Golden Gate's procedures.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 2-3.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   Karimi asserts six claims. First, Karimi contends that Defendants violated section 94367 of the California Education Code, also known as the \"Leonard Law,\" by imposing disciplinary sanctions for speech protected by the United States Constitution and California Constitution if made off campus, and by restricting Karimi's association with members of the Golden Gate community.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 9-10.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   Second, Karimi asserts that Defendants breached their contractual obligations under the Golden Gate student handbook by: (1) Niedwiecki imposing interim suspension before disciplinary charges were pending against Karimi; (2) Niedwiecki imposing interim suspension unilaterally rather than approving suspension imposed by the Assistant Director for Student Conduct and Professionalism (\"Assistant Director\"); (3) failing to provide Karimi due process; (4) suspending Karimi when he did not violate Golden Gate policies; (5) canceling the torts class before Labor Day weekend; (6) allowing students to promote their organizations and candidacies during class time; and (7) not having an Assistant Director in place to oversee Karimi's disciplinary process from the beginning.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 10-12.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   Third, Karimi asserts that Defendants breached their duty of good faith and fair dealing by imposing disciplinary measures against Karimi but not against the student who harassed him in class, suspending Karimi without notice or formal charges, keeping his fall tuition while he was suspended, failing to comply with certain provisions of the student handbook, and pressuring Karimi to withdraw.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 13-15.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   Fourth, Karimi asserts a claim for \"Defamation/False Flight\" (sic) based on Niedwiecki's email to the Golden Gate community.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 15-17. Karimi alleges that the email falsely stated he was \"requested\" to leave for an \"indefinite period\" when Niedwiecki in fact ordered him to leave and that Karimi exhibited \"behavioral issues at the University\" when his suspension was in fact based on emails sent from off campus, and generally gave the impression that Karimi was dangerous, all of which damaged Karimi's reputation and caused him to lose friends.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   Karimi's fifth claim is for invasion of privacy by public disclosure of private facts.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 17-18. Karimi asserts that Niedwiecki's email to the Golden Gate community violated the Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act (\"FERPA\") by disclosing \"personal identifying information\" and \"educational records.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   Karimi's sixth and final claim is for intentional infliction of emotional distress, based both on the incident where another student cursed at him and on his later suspension.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 18-20. Karimi asserts that Golden Gate's failure to investigate or take action beyond reassigning seats regarding the alleged harassment, which Karimi characterizes as \"reckless negligence\" by Golden Gate, \"totally disregarded [his] emotional state as well as physical safety\" and left him scared and humiliated.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 19. Karimi alleges that his suspension was an abuse of power by Niedwiecki that disregarded Karimi's personal circumstances, including his desire to practice law\n   and his need to provide for his family.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 19-20.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   Karimi seeks damages in excess of $ 200,000, including for violation of his civil rights under section 94367 and for delaying his ability to work as a lawyer for at least a year, among other categories of damages.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 20-21. Karimi also seeks declaratory relief under section 94367, and-at the time he filed his amended complaint-sought injunctive relief of reinstatement in the event that he was not admitted to another law school.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 20.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   <strong>\n    B. Evidence Submitted by Karimi\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   To ensure that Karimi's evidence is given sufficient consideration where the analysis below assumes for the sake of argument that it would not be excluded, this section summarizes the evidence submitted by Karimi in opposition to Defendants' motions. Evidence submitted by Defendants is discussed in context where relevant to the Court's analysis. The Court's previous order denying Karimi's motion for a preliminary injunction provides a more detailed review of the factual background of the case.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Order Denying Mot. for Prelim. Inj. (dkt. 57) at 1-15.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   <strong>\n    1. Karimi's Declaration Opposing Summary Judgment\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   The evidence that Karimi has filed opposing summary judgment is relatively sparse. Karimi states that he was a student at Golden Gate in September of 2017. Karimi MSJ Decl. (dkt. 92-1) \u00b6 1. Early in the year, he was harassed by another student and called the San Francisco Police Department to file a report.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 15. He waited about four hours for police to arrive but eventually went home when the police department was unable to provide an estimate for when officers would arrive.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Karimi was fearful at Golden Gate and considered the environment on campus to be hostile.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 16. According to Karimi, \"[s]tudents had sent [him] hostile emails and would make fun of [him] in class and about campus.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   He had only one friend and generally did not speak or socialize with other Golden Gate students, instead spending his time on campus in class, where he would ask questions, or studying in the library.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 16-17.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   Karimi expressed concern when a torts class was canceled.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 2. He characterizes his efforts to communicate that concern as \"civil,\" and states that he \"was never enraged by the cancellation.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   Karimi sent emails to his classmates about the canceled class and other issues, including Karimi's disapproval of students using class time to discuss student groups (including \"ethnocentric groups\"), personal stories, and candidacies for student government.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   Exs. 3, 4. Several of Karimi's classmates responded negatively to those emails.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   Ex. 4. Karimi states that when classmates asked him not to email them, he attempted to remove them from future emails, although in one case he accidentally emailed someone again who used multiple email addresses.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 6.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   According to Karimi, Niedwiecki instructed him not to use the TWEN system to contact students, and he did not do so.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 3. Hours before Karimi was suspended on September 14, 2017, Niedwiecki sent him an email instructing him not to use TWEN or any other method of emailing his class.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 4. Karimi did not email his classmates again after he read that email from Niedwiecki.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 5.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   Later the same day, Niedwiecki emailed Karimi again to inform him that he was\n   suspended, but Karimi did not read that email before going to campus the next day.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 8-9. When Karimi arrived at the library, Associate Dean Jessica Bride made eye contact with him but did not speak to him.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 10. Golden Gate's Director of Business Services and Facilities Mike Koperski (whose responsibilities include security), along with \"another plain clothes security guard,\" confronted Karimi when he was leaving the library and escorted him to a private room, where Koperski gave Karimi a copy of Niedwiecki's email regarding Karimi's suspension.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 11-12. In the email, Niedwiecki stated that he was the \"final decision maker\" regarding Karimi's suspension, which Karimi characterizes as a denial of due process under the Golden Gate student handbook.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 18 &amp; Ex. 5. After Koperski told Karimi that he could not speak to Niedwiecki, Karimi \"demanded that police be called\" and left the building to wait outside for the police.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 12. Karimi states that Koperski never instructed him to leave campus.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   About fifteen minutes later, police officers arrived and, after Karimi explained the situation, told him that he would be trespassing if he returned to Golden Gate while suspended.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 13.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   After Karimi was suspended, he \"did not email students who told [him] they did not want to email.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 7. He \"attempted to contact [Niedwiecki] and [Golden Gate] to get back in and be given due process,\" and when he determined that those efforts were futile, \"attempted to negotiate a settlement.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 23.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   In the summer of 2018-while this lawsuit was pending-Karimi was accepted to another law school in Houston, Texas, and informed the Court and defense counsel of that fact.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 20. Defense counsel nevertheless attempted to schedule Karimi's deposition in Austin, Texas, and on days when Karimi had class or during his midterms.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 21-22.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   <strong>\n    2. Karimi's Declaration Opposing Sanctions\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   Karimi's declaration in response to Defendants' motion for sanctions reads, in full, as follows:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-39\">\n   1.

Briefing Regarding Defendants' Motion for Sanctions\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   Defendants seek sanctions against Karimi for adding claims other than under section 94367 in his amended complaint, which Defendants characterize as a violation of the Court's order permitted Karimi leave to amend, and for Karimi's failure to appear at his deposition.\n   <em>\n    See generally\n   </em>\n   Sanctions Mot. (dkt. 90). Defendants contend that they made repeated efforts to schedule a deposition convenient for Karimi, including rescheduling the deposition to avoid Karimi's midterms, but that Karimi nevertheless failed to appear or cooperate with Defendants' efforts to take his deposition, instead insisting that a written deposition would be sufficient.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 3-5.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   Defendants argue that a sanction of dismissal is appropriate under Rule 37 of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure where a party willfully fails to appear for his own deposition, and that a sanction of excluding Karimi's evidence as to several claims is appropriate here.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 4-6. Defendants contend that no alternative sanctions are available because discovery has closed and Karimi, who is indigent, would be unable to pay an award of attorneys' fees or other monetary sanctions.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 6-7. Defendants also seek to strike Karimi's third, fourth, and fifth claims as purportedly added without leave of the Court.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 6.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   Karimi argues that Defendants initially noticed a deposition to occur in Austin, Texas despite knowing that Karimi had relocated to Houston, Texas, and that by waiting until near the end of the discovery period, Defendants \"attempted to schedule the deposition at an extremely inconvenient time and place to annoy and inconvenience\" him. Opp'n to Sanctions (dkt. 93) at 1-2. Karimi also argues that Defendants failed to comply with Civil Local Rule 7-8(c), which requires a party to file a motion for sanctions as soon as practicable after learning of the circumstances giving rise to the motion, because Defendants waited more than a month after Karimi failed to appear for his deposition to bring their motion.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 2-3. Karimi asserts that he \"never had an objection to a deposition and in fact stated that he would be willing to also give a written deposition.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 3.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-50\">\n   Defendants argue in their reply brief that they attempted to work around Karimi's schedule and that Karimi has not refuted their showing that a deposition was necessary and that Karimi intentionally failed to appear.\n   <em>\n    See generally\n   </em>\n   Reply Re Sanctions (dkt. 94). Defendants do not address Karimi's argument that the sanctions motion was untimely.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-51\">\n   <strong>\n    2.

Mot. for Summ. J. (\"MSJ,\" dkt. 91). Defendants contend that Karimi cannot prevail under section 94367 of the California Education Code because that statute only authorizes a private action for injunctive and declaratory relief, and any claim for such relief is moot now that Karimi has withdrawn from Golden Gate without any notation of discipline on his record and enrolled at a different law school, and does not intend to return to Golden Gate.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 8-10.

Karimi argues that Niedwiecki had actual malice in sending the email, because Niedwiecki knew his statements were false or recklessly disregarded the possibility that they might be, and because Niedwiecki intended to discredit Karimi's \"complaint regarding [Golden Gate's] low bar passage rates and history of being put on probation by the ABA.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 12-13.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-64\">\n   Karimi argues that his claim for public disclosure of private information should proceed because FERPA restricts the disclosure of disciplinary records, and Niedwiecki's email effectively disclosed that Karimi had been suspended.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 13-14. Karimi contends that the events described in the email were not within the public domain because his claim is \"based on [Niedwiecki's] defamatory email, not events that took place in the library,\" and because his \"interaction with police [was] off campus, outside of any building, and on a public sidewalk.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 14.

Defendants repeatedly offered to adjust, and in fact adjusted, the time and location of Karimi's deposition in an effort to accommodate his location and schedule, including an offer to take the deposition by telephone without requiring Karimi to appear at any particular location.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Defs.'

Karimi states, for example, that Defendants' assertion that they \"requested [his] address is false,\" and that \"[t]here is no record that proves this.\" Opp'n to Sanctions at 2. Defense counsel Stacey Leask's October 10, 2018 email to Karimi includes the following: \"Please provide me with your current residence address in Houston or if not Houston, where you presently reside.\" Defs.'

Exs. TT, VV, BBB.

Ex. RR, asked Karimi to propose an alternative date after Karimi objected to the date originally noticed, Defs.' Ex. UU, changed the date after Karimi failed to propose an alternative date, Defs.' Ex.

Ex. ZZ. Given the time constraints imposed by the discovery cutoff date, it is difficult to see how Defendants could have been more accommodating of Karimi's objections without forsaking entirely the deposition to which they were entitled.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-85\">\n   Litigating a civil case requires significant efforts by both parties. Karimi's failure to take discovery to support his own case was a decision he was entitled to make, albeit one with consequences for his likelihood of success. His failure to cooperate with Defendants' legitimate efforts to obtain discovery from him, however, significantly prejudiced Defendants' ability to defend against the claims Karimi brought against them. This is particularly true with respect to claims that would depend on Karimi's subjective testimony, such as claims involving emotional distress. A deposition provides an important and unique opportunity for a party to test its opponent's testimony before trial, potentially revealing contradictions, qualifications, or admissions that undermine the opponent's position. Karimi's failure to appear for his deposition deprived Defendants of that opportunity. The prejudice to Defendants weighs heavily in favor of meaningful sanctions.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-86\">\n   Karimi does not suggest any viable alternative sanctions in his opposition brief. Defendants argue persuasively that attorneys' fees or other monetary sanctions are not viable alternative because Karimi is indigent. Even if the Court extended the\n   discovery period and ordered Karimi to submit to a deposition, Defendants would be prejudiced by their increased attorneys' fees, extended litigation, and the likely need to re-brief their summary judgment motion after a belated deposition. The Court is aware of no sanction-short of the evidence preclusion ordered here-that would effectively compensate Defendants for that prejudice. And although the Court did not explicitly warn Karimi of potentially dispositive sanctions, at the case management conference the Court explicitly approved the deposition that Karimi failed to appear for, and Defendants warned Karimi via email that they would seek dipositive or monetary sanctions if he failed to appear.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Defs.' Ex. XX. The Court also notes that, as a law student, Karimi had resources available to research his discovery obligations, the avenues available to seek relief from those obligations, and the potential sanctions for failure to comply. The Court concludes that Karimi had sufficient actual and constructive notice of his obligations and that no lesser sanction than that imposed here would be effective. Moreover, although Karimi is correct that this Court's local rules require a motion for sanctions to be filed as soon as practicable,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Civ. L.R. 7-8(c), Defendants filed their motion within a matter of weeks after Karimi failed to appear for his deposition, and Karimi has not identified any prejudice stemming from that relatively short delay, or any alternative sanctions that would have been available if Defendants had filed their motion earlier.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-87\">\n   In crafting a narrow sanction, the Court need not dismiss outright any claim. Instead, the Court prohibits Karimi \"from introducing designated matters in evidence\" pursuant to Rule 37(b)(2)(A)(ii) -specifically, his own declarations and testimony, which Defendants were unable to test through a deposition. As discussed below, that sanction is effectively dispositive of Karimi's claim for intentional infliction of emotional distress. The Court concludes for the reasons discussed above that this limited dispositive effect is justified under the test described in\n   <em>\n    Connecticut General Life Insurance\n   </em>\n   and similar Ninth Circuit authority. While this sanction might also prevent Karimi from prevailing on other claims, its practical effect is fairly narrow, as the analysis below explains that Defendants would be entitled to summary judgment on many of Karimi's claims even without this sanction.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-88\">\n   Much of the analysis below assumes for the sake of argument that Karimi's declarations could be considered. The Court discusses the effect of precluding those declarations in detail only where relevant to the outcome of the motion.\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-89\">\n   <strong>\n    B.

The Disciplinary Action Letter that Devoy sent to Karimi explained Karimi's option to pursue a formal hearing through Golden Gate's internal disciplinary process.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"85\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=21%20Cal.%20Rptr.%203d%20192\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   Karimi instead sought unsuccessfully to enjoin any disciplinary proceedings, stipulated to postpone such proceedings, and ultimately agreed to withdraw from Golden Gate without reaching any resolution of the internal disciplinary process. Having declined to exhaust that process, Karimi is not entitled to challenge before the Court Golden Gate's determination that it had grounds for disciplinary action. To the extent that Karimi's contract claims are based on such a theory, Defendants are entitled to summary judgment. The same is true of any theory of damages based on Karimi's inability to obtain a degree from Golden Gate, or to obtain a law degree within three years of beginning his studies at Golden Gate, as the question of what sanction could be imposed for Karimi's violation of student conduct standards was entrusted to the process that Karimi declined to pursue.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-107\">\n   Karimi argues that he \"lost this year [towards obtaining a law degree] regardless of\" the outcome of disciplinary proceedings because even if he ultimately prevailed in Golden Gate's internal process, it would not change the fact that he was suspended during necessary first-semester classes.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Opp'n to MSJ at 9. This argument is unavailing because it is based on the assumption that Karimi would have prevailed under that process and Golden Gate lacked valid reasons to suspend or expel him. Having failed to exhaust the process, Karimi is not entitled to such a presumption.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-108\">\n   Because these aspects of Karimi's claims are barred by his failure to exhaust internal procedures, the Court need not decide whether an incorrect decision under Golden Gate's procedures could support a claim for breach of contract.\n   <em>\n    But see\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Kashmiri\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6052353\" index=\"86\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/cal-app-4th/156/809/#p824\">\n    156 Cal.

Claims Based on Purported Procedural Defects\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-110\">\n   One aspect of Karimi's contract claims, however, is not necessarily barred by the exhaustion analysis set forth above, but Defendants are nevertheless entitled to judgment because the handbook is not amenable to Karimi's interpretation of it. Karimi argues that Golden Gate did not follow its own procedures for imposing an interim suspension. Those procedures read as follows:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-111\">\n   Pending action on charges, a student's status as a member of the University\n   community will not be altered or his or her right to attend classes or perform his or her prescribed duties suspended, except under any of the following circumstances as determined by the Assistant Director and approved by the dean:\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-112\">\n   1. To ensure the safety and well-being of members of the University community or preservation of University property;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-113\">\n   2. To ensure the student's own physical or emotional safety and well-being;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-114\">\n   3. If the student poses a credible threat of disruption of or interference with the normal operations of the University; and/or\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-115\">\n   4. If the student fails to attend the scheduled hearing on the disciplinary charges.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-116\">\n   During the interim suspension, the student shall be denied access to University facilities including classes, and/or all other University activities or privileges for which the student might otherwise be eligible, and/or other restrictions, as the Assistant Director may determine.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-117\">\n   Defs.' Ex. A (Handbook) at 110, \u00a7 XVI.J.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-118\">\n   According to Karimi, his interim suspension violated the handbook procedures because: (1) no formal charges were pending when he was first suspended; and (2) Niedwiecki, the dean, had no authority to suspend him unilaterally rather than acting on a determination by the Assistant Director as called for in the handbook.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   FAC at 10-13; Opp'n to MSJ at 2, 9-10. Defendants do not address these arguments, and it is not clear that Defendants' exhaustion argument applies to this claim, because Defendants have not explained why a disciplinary hearing committee would have reason to consider any procedural errors in imposing an interim suspension that applied only \"[p]ending action on charges\" and thus would have reached its end when a decision on those charges was reached, regardless of the outcome.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-119\">\n   Karimi is correct that the handbook, by its terms, calls for a decision by the Assistant Director and approval by the dean, rather than a unilateral decision by the dean. Based on the available record, the Assistant Director position appears to have been vacant at the time Niedwiecki placed Karimi on interim suspension. Defendants do not dispute Karimi's assertion that the position was vacant, which is consistent with Devoy's declaration that he became Assistant Director in the fall of 2017.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Opp'n at 9-10; Devoy Decl. \u00b6 2.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-120\">\n   The Court interprets the interim suspension provision of the handbook as allowing the dean to place a student on interim suspension if the Assistant Director position is vacant. The purpose of the provision is to ensure safety and prevent interference with operations when the university determines that a student must be removed from campus on a provisional basis more quickly than a decision could be reached through the full disciplinary process. Taking into account that purpose, as well as the deference given to educational institutes in managing student discipline, it would be untenable to interpret the handbook as disallowing interim suspension while the Assistant Director position is vacant. Instead, it is appropriate in that event for the dean-who even under normal circumstances holds the right of final approval of interim suspensions-to act unilaterally, as Niedwiecki did here.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-121\">\n   The introductory phrase \"[p]ending action on charges\" also does not clearly require that formal charges must be filed before a student may be placed on interim suspension. For much the same reasons-the purpose of interim suspension, and deference to university discipline-the Court concludes that the phrase merely qualifies interim suspension as applicable before a final decision is reached, and does not require charges to be filed before interim\n   suspension may be imposed. Karimi therefore cannot prevail on his contract claims based on Niedwiecki's unilateral decision to place him on interim suspension before filing formal disciplinary charges, because the handbook implicitly permitted Niedwiecki to do so. Defendants' motion for summary judgment on these claims is GRANTED.\n   <footnotemark>\n    7\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-122\">\n   <strong>\n    E.

Assuming for the sake of argument that Niedwiecki's statement that a law student had \"in our judgment...been demonstrating some behavior issues\" implies any factual assertion, it suggests at most that Karimi behaved in an unusual or confrontational manner on campus. The record does not support any factual dispute as to whether Karimi behaved confrontationally on campus, or at least in the immediate vicinity of campus.

Even if Koperski did not verbally instruct Karimi to leave, Niedwiecki's statement that \"we requested a law student...to leave campus for an indefinite period\" remains substantially accurate, because Koperski provided Karimi with Niedwiecki's suspension email instructing him to remain off campus.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Karimi MSJ Decl. \u00b6 12; Defs.'

Karimi cites no authority for the proposition that any record governed by FERPA-which does not itself provide a private right of action-constitutes the sort of \"intimate detail\" protected from disclosure under California tort law. Even accepting Karimi's premise for the sake of argument, Niedwiecki's email did not disclose that Karimi had been suspended or that any formal disciplinary action had occurred. The email stated only that Golden Gate had \"\n   <em>\n    requested\n   </em>\n   a law student...to leave campus for an indefinite period of time.\" Defs.' Ex. N (emphasis added). No reasonable finder of fact could conclude that the email disclosed intimate private details of Karimi's life.

The elements of such a claim are:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-147\">\n   (1) extreme and outrageous conduct by the defendant with the intention of causing, or reckless disregard of the probability of causing, emotional distress; (2) the plaintiff's suffering severe or extreme emotional distress; and (3) actual and proximate causation of the emotional distress by the defendant's outrageous conduct....A defendant's conduct is \"outrageous\" when it is so extreme as to exceed all bounds of that usually tolerated in a civilized community....And the defendant's conduct must be intended to inflict injury or engaged in with the realization that injury will result.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-148\">\n   <em>\n    Hughes v.

The degree of injury required is also high: \"Severe emotional distress means emotional distress of such substantial quality or enduring quality that no reasonable\n   [person] in civilized society should be expected to endure it,\" and assertions that a plaintiff \"suffered discomfort, worry, anxiety, upset stomach, concern, and agitation\" do not meet that bar.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"127\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=209%20P.3d%20963\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"127\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=209%20P.3d%20963\">\n    at 1051\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"128\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=95%20Cal.%20Rptr.%203d%20636\">\n    95 Cal.Rptr.3d 636\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"129\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=209%20P.3d%20963\">\n    209 P.3d 963\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (citations and internal quotation marks omitted; alteration in original).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-149\">\n   The only conduct Karimi identifies in his opposition brief to support this claim is Niedwiecki \"totally disregard[ing] student handbook policy and de facto expell[ing Karimi] without due process and jeopardizing [his] dream of being a lawyer.\" Opp'n 14-15.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-150\">\n   Niedwiecki did not \"de facto expel\" Karimi without an opportunity for process. The student handbook provided a process for a hearing on the disciplinary charges eventually filed against Karimi, but Karimi declined to participate in that process, unsuccessfully sought an injunction against it, and agreed with Golden Gate to postpone the disciplinary process until he eventually agreed to withdraw from Golden Gate after being admitted to a different law school. Karimi was entitled to process before he could have been expelled, and was presented with opportunities to take advantage of that process. Because Karimi failed to exhaust internal university processes to challenge the grounds for his suspension, he may not do so here.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-151\">\n   The Court need not address whether a finder of fact could conclude from this record that any of Defendants' conduct was \"outrageous\" as that term is used in the context of an intentional infliction of emotional distress claim. Even if Karimi could both show outrageous conduct and overcome his failure to exhaust internal remedies, the only evidence of subjective distress is Karimi's own declaration, and Defendants were unable to test that evidence through discovery because Karimi refused to appear for a deposition. In light of the Court's decision to exclude Karimi's declaration under Rule 37, there is no evidence in the record from which a finder of fact could conclude that Karimi suffered \"emotional distress of such substantial quality or enduring quality that no reasonable [person] in civilized society should be expected to endure it.\"\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Hughes\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3896584\" index=\"130\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/cal-4th/46/1035/#p1050\">\n    46 Cal. 4th at 1051\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"131\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=95%20Cal.%20Rptr.%203d%20636\">\n    95 Cal.Rptr.3d 636\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"132\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=209%20P.3d%20963\">\n    209 P.3d 963\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

If Defendants objected to Karimi's amended complaint, they could have filed an appropriate motion after Karimi filed it in May of 2018. Taking into account the liberal policy of amendment underlying the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, the Court would very likely have granted Karimi leave to add additional claims to his complaint if he had sought such leave at the time.

Such claims would be limited to Karimi's loss of campus privileges until the procedural defects were cured, because as discussed above, Karimi's failure to exhaust internal adjudication of the charges against him bars any damages related to his ultimate separation from Golden Gate. The purported procedural defects were cured no later than December 20, 2017, at which time formal charges had been filed and Devoy, as stated in his declaration bearing that date, concurred with Niedwiecki's decision that interim suspension was appropriate. Devoy Decl. Re Prelim. Inj. (dkt. 27) \u00b6 32.
