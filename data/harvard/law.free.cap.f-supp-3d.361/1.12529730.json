KELLY, United States District Judge\n   Mary Tyes-Williams, an African-American woman, has worked in various chaplaincy positions for the Federal Bureau of Prisons (BOP) since 2004. She describes the first decade of her career as a steady climb marked by superior performance reviews and robust skills development. After 11 years with BOP, however, she ran into trouble with two coworkers who at various times held supervisory positions over her and received promotions that Tyes-Williams sought for herself. From Tyes-Williams's perspective, these coworkers unlawfully discriminated against her by treating her condescendingly, interfering with her career advancement, and depriving her of advantages routinely offered to white, male employees. Tyes-Williams sought support from an Equal Employment Opportunity (EEO) counselor and later filed an EEO complaint, but she claims her coworkers' bad behavior did not abate. After BOP took no action on her formal EEO complaint, Tyes-Williams filed this lawsuit.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-8\">\n   Tyes-Williams brings four claims, alleging discrimination, retaliation, a hostile work environment, and a retaliatory hostile work environment under Title VII of the Civil Rights Act. Defendant has moved to dismiss the latter three, arguing that Tyes-Williams failed to administratively exhaust some of her claims and that, in any case, none of them allege misconduct serious enough to state a discrimination claim. For the reasons explained below, the Court will grant Defendant's motion and dismiss Tyes-Williams's claims of retaliation, hostile work environment, and retaliatory hostile work environment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   <strong>\n    I. Factual and Procedural Background\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   Tyes-Williams has worked for the BOP since December 2004. ECF No. 1, Complaint (\"Compl.\"), \u00b6\u00b6 1, 6, 7. In June 2014, she was promoted to a GS-13 position as a Chaplaincy Services Coordinator with BOP's Central Office Reentry Division.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 9. Although this position was based in Washington, D.C., Tyes-Williams worked remotely, first from the Southeast Regional Office in Atlanta, Georgia, and most recently from the Federal Correctional Complex in Yazoo City, Mississippi.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 1, 9.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   According to Tyes-Williams, in her new position she was subjected to a pattern of discrimination and retaliation on the basis of her race and gender beginning in \"approximately November 2015.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 14. She identifies two allegedly discriminating officials: Heidi Kugler and Kevin Kelley.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   In August 2015, Tyes-Williams reported directly to Kugler, a white female.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 14, 15. Tyes-Williams and Kelley, a white male, held positions of the same grade, GS-13.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 15. In November 2015, the BOP advertised an opening for a GS-15 position.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 19. Although Tyes-Williams alleges that she was well-qualified and recommended for the position, she did not receive an interview.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 20. Instead, Kugler was selected for the position.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   Tyes-Williams alleges that Kugler and Kelley proceeded to treat her in a cold, unpleasant, and hostile manner.\n   <em>\n    See id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 17-18, 21, 38, 40-41. She contacted an EEO counselor about filing an EEO complaint of discrimination on November 16, 2015.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 22. Thereafter, she alleges, Kugler circumscribed her responsibilities-although not those of any white employees-and limited her advancement potential.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 23-26. Further, Kugler limited Tyes-Williams's access to training opportunities.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 27-31.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   In February 2016, Kelley was promoted to Kugler's old position, although Tyes-Williams alleges that she had applied and was qualified for it.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 33-34. This made Kelley Tyes-Williams's supervisor.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 33. In March 2016, Tyes-Williams requested to be transferred to Yazoo City, Mississippi.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 42. Her request was not approved for more than three months.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 43. In response to this alleged \"ongoing discriminat[ion],\" Tyes-Williams followed up on her original EEO contact by filing an informal complaint on March 18, 2016.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 44.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   Thereafter, Tyes-Williams experienced trouble with her assigned performance standards and the performance ratings she received. Among other things, she received a less-than-perfect \"Excellent\" rating-her first such rating in eight years-and was frustrated by the vagueness of the standards she was expected to meet.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 48, 51, 54-55. Eventually, however, the rating that Tyes-Williams received in April 2017 was adjusted upward.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 58-60. Finally, in April 2017, Tyes-Williams requested two days per week of telework and was granted only one, despite some white employees being allowed two.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 60-62.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   On June 16, 2017, Tyes-Williams filed the instant action. Her complaint includes four counts: discrimination (Count I), hostile work environment (Count II), retaliation (Count III), and retaliatory hostile work environment (Count IV).\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 64-89. Defendant has moved to dismiss Counts II and IV for failure to allege misconduct that rises to the level of a hostile work environment claim. ECF No. 6-1, Memorandum of Points and Authorities in Support of Defendant's Motion to Dismiss Counts II, III, and IV, at 7. As to Count III, Defendant moves to dismiss on the grounds that Tyes-Williams (1) has not exhausted \"most subparts\" of her claim, (2) has failed to allege a materially adverse action, and (3) has failed to allege a causal connection between her protected activity and some of the alleged retaliation.\n   <em>\n    See id.\n   </em>\n   at 15-23.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   <strong>\n    II.

About half of the affronts Tyes-Williams identifies are interactions with Kugler or Kelley that she found offensive or inappropriate. For example, she alleges that Kugler was \"cold\" to her and was \"unfairly critical\" of her work. Compl. \u00b6 16. Kugler also referred to herself as Tyes-Williams's \"boss,\" but referred to subordinate white employees as \"co-worker[s]\" or \"teammate[s].\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 17.

Tyes-Williams alleges that when Kugler became her supervisor, she instructed Tyes-Williams to stop performing work for the South Central and Southeast Regional branches despite consistent positive feedback from those\n   branches on her performance. Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 23-24. Tyes-Williams characterizes this work as \"front-facing\" and providing a \"terrific opportunity for advancement.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 25. Tyes-Williams also alleges that Kugler required her-and no other employee-to obtain explicit permission before working on any new tasks, even if they fell within her existing job responsibilities.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 26. When Kugler issued performance ratings, Tyes-Williams received \"Excellent\" rather than \"Outstanding\" for the first time in eight years.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 46, 48.

She alleges that at one point, Kugler forbade her-and no other employee-from attending trainings at the BOP's training center unless she was presenting the training. Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 27, 30-31. Although Kugler said this decision was made for budgetary reasons, Tyes-Williams alleges that the branch's budget had recently increased by $ 30,000.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 32.

And finally, when Tyes-Williams submitted a request to Kelley to telework two days of the week, he authorized only one day, even though a number of other employees in the office were permitted two days.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 60-62.

Of course, it is possible that a plaintiff could state a hostile work environment claim by pleading some combination of actions that courts have previously found insufficient if, in total, those actions rose to the requisite level of hostility. But that is not the case here.
