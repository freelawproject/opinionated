The court heard oral argument on January 16, 2019, and took the matter under advisement. For the reasons explained below, Plaintiff's motion is denied and Defendant's motion is granted.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   <em>\n    BACKGROUND FACTS\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   Plaintiff, International Outdoor, Inc., challenges the constitutionality of the City of Troy's sign ordinance under\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201983\">\n    42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . The court previously dismissed Count II of Plaintiff's complaint, which alleged that the sign ordinance was an unconstitutional regulation based upon content.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Doc. 10. The only remaining cause of action is Count I, which alleges that the sign ordinance's variance process creates an unconstitutional prior restraint on speech.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   Plaintiff is an outdoor advertising company that erects billboards. The City of Troy regulates billboards and other signs through Chapter 85 of its Code of Ordinances (\"Sign Ordinance\").\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Doc. 26-3. The purpose of the Sign Ordinance is to \"control the occurrence and size of signs in order to reduce ... negative effects\" such as undue distractions, traffic hazards, and the reduction of property values. \u00a7 85.01.01(B). Section 85.01.04(A) of the Sign Ordinance requires a permit for each sign, unless it meets one of several enumerated exceptions. Billboards are considered \"ground signs,\" which are defined as \"[a] freestanding sign supported by one or more uprights, braces, or pylons located in or upon the ground and not attached to any building.\" \u00a7 85.01.03. Ground signs are subject to specific zoning district regulations outlined in section 85.02.05(C). These regulations limit a sign's size, height, and location. Pursuant to section 85.01.08(B)(1), Troy's Building Code Board of Appeals may grant a variance to signs that do not comply with the requirements of the Sign Ordinance:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-13\">\n   The Board of Appeals has the power to grant specific variances from the requirements of this Chapter, upon a showing of each of the following:\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-14\">\n   a. The variance would not be contrary to the public interest or general purpose and intent of this Chapter; and\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-15\">\n   b. The variance does not adversely affect properties in the immediate vicinity of the proposed sign; and\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-16\">\n   c. The petitioner has a hardship or practical difficulty resulting from the unusual characteristics of the property that precludes reasonable use of the property.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   \u00a7 85.01.08(B).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   Plaintiff sought to erect two digital billboards on property it leases in Troy. Because the proposed signs exceeded the Sign Ordinance's size and height limitations, Plaintiff sought a variance. At a special meeting on November 18, 2015, the Troy Building Code Board of Appeals denied Plaintiff's request because \"[t]he applicant has not proved the variance would not be contrary to the public interest or general purpose and intent of Chapter 85\"; \"[t]he applicant has not proved the variance does not adversely affect properties in the immediate vicinity\"; and \"[t]he applicant has not proved a hardship or practical difficulty.\" Doc. 28-8. Subsequently, Plaintiff filed this action challenging the constitutionality of the ordinance.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   <em>\n    LAW AND ANALYSIS\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   I.\n   <em>\n    Standard of Review\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   The parties each seek summary judgment with respect to Count I of Plaintiff's complaint, which alleges that the Sign Ordinance violates the First Amendment because it creates an impermissible prior restraint on speech. Summary judgment is appropriate if \"there is no genuine issue as to any material fact and ... the moving\n   party is entitled to a judgment as a matter of law.\" Fed. R. Civ. P. 56(c).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   II.\n   <em>\n    Mootness\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   Defendant contends that Plaintiff's claim is now moot, because the City of Troy amended the variance provision effective October 1, 2018, to provide additional standards for and limits on granting variances.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Doc. 28-15 (amended ordinance) at \u00a7 85.01.08(B). Plaintiff concedes that the amended ordinance renders its claims for declaratory and injunctive relief moot. Plaintiff argues, however, that its claim for monetary relief arising from the application of the prior Sign Ordinance and variance process is not moot.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   Claims become moot \"when the issues presented are no longer 'live' or parties lack a legally cognizable interest in the outcome.\"\n   <em>\n    County of Los Angeles v.

Doc. 10 at 20-21. Defendant brings the court's attention to the official version of the ordinance, which was not completely reproduced on its website, and which contains the following severability clause: \"Should any word, phrase, sentence, paragraph or section of this Ordinance be held invalid or unconstitutional, the remaining provision of this ordinance shall remain in full force and effect.\" Docs. 33-1, 33-2 at \u00a7 3. According to the Troy City Clerk, this severability clause was enacted along with Chapter 85 of the Troy City Code (Sign Ordinance) in 2005 and remains in effect.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"62\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=611%20N.W.2d%20530\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   The severability clause evidences the Troy City Council's intent that any unconstitutional provision should not be fatal to the entire ordinance. The remaining provisions of the Sign Ordinance - such as size and setback limitations - stand independently from the variance provision. Plaintiff has not articulated how the variance provision is \"so entangled\" with the rest of the Sign Ordinance such that the variance provision's removal would impair the operation of the Sign Ordinance. Accordingly, the court finds that the variance provision is severable from the Sign Ordinance.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   It is undisputed that Plaintiff's proposed signs would exceed the Sign Ordinance's size limitations, which Plaintiff does not challenge. Because these unchallenged provisions would preclude Plaintiff from erecting its signs, any injury suffered by Plaintiff as a result of the application of the severable variance provision is not redressable.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Midwest Media Property, L.L.C. v.

In\n   <em>\n    Midwest Media\n   </em>\n   , the Sixth Circuit held that a sign company could not challenge a township's ban on off-site advertising because the proposed signs did not comply with the ordinance's height and size restrictions.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"2923526\" index=\"64\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/503/456/#p460\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   The court explained that even if the plaintiffs successfully challenged the off-site advertising ban, \"that would not redress plaintiffs' injury because the size and height restrictions still would preclude the township from approving their sign applications and thus still would preclude plaintiffs from erecting each of these signs.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"2923526\" index=\"65\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/503/456/#p460\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"2923526\" index=\"65\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/503/456/#p460\">\n    at 461-62\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   Consistent with this authority, Plaintiff's claim for damages based upon its inability to erect its nonconforming signs fails as a matter of law.
