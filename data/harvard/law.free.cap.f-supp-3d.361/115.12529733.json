Pet. Writ Habeas Corpus (\"Pet.\"), ECF No. 1. Brad Cowen (\"Cowen\"), Superintendent of Massachusetts Correctional Institution (\"MCI\") Norfolk, opposes Santana's petition for habeas relief. Resp't's Mem. Law Opp'n Pet. Writ Habeas Corpus (\"Opp'n Mem.\"), ECF No. 18.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   In his petition, Santana insists that the Massachusetts Supreme Judicial Court, based upon the evidence before it, unreasonably determined that he voluntarily made incriminating statements to police officers. Pet. 6; Mem. Points &amp; Authorities Supp. Pet. Writ Habeas Corpus (\"Pet. Mem.\") 8-13, ECF No. 2. Santana further asserts that the Supreme Judicial Court unreasonably applied clearly established federal law in ruling that he voluntarily gave incriminating statements to the police. Pet. 6; Pet. Mem. 13-18 (citing U.S. Const. amends. V, XIV ). Santana argues that the Supreme Judicial Court erred when it determined that because the police provided him with\n   <em>\n    Miranda\n   </em>\n   warnings, after assuring him that his incriminating statements would be confidential, his statements\n   were voluntary. Pet. Mem. 13-16. Santana also suggests that the Supreme Judicial Court failed to weigh the police officer's promise to put in a good word for him with state officials.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%202254\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%202254\">\n    at 16-18\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Santana thus maintains that the Massachusetts Superior Court erred when it refused to suppress his incriminating statements and that the Supreme Judicial Court erred when it did not overturn the Superior Court's decision.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%202254\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%202254\">\n    at 8-18\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Therefore, Santana asks this Court to grant his petition for habeas corpus and order his release or a new trial.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%202254\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%202254\">\n    at 20\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   Cowen, in response, counters that the Supreme Judicial Court rightfully, from both a factual and legal standpoint, refused to overturn the trial court's denial of Santana's motion to suppress. Opp'n Mem. 9-17. Thus, Cowen asks this Court to deny Santana's request for relief.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%202254\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%202254\">\n    at 17\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   After hearing argument from both parties, and careful consideration, this Court DENIES Santana's petition for habeas relief.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   <strong>\n    A.

There was no evidence in the record to support this determination, Santana insists.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Santana asserts that the Supreme Judicial Court did not take into account expert testimony that he \"spoke at a beginner's level of English and was only capable of conversing in English on a superficial level, such as a standard greeting, and spoke the beginner's level of English.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 10. Based on Santana's inability fully to translate his\n   <em>\n    Miranda\n   </em>\n   rights into English when asked and his seeming confusion over the functions of the District Attorney, which LaBarge referenced during questioning, Santana argues that \"[t]here can be no reasonable finding that [he] could 'obviously' understand what LaBarge was saying in English or 'fully understood what was going on,' \" despite the Supreme Judicial Court's contrary determination.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 9-10.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-156\">\n   The Supreme Judicial Court's second error, Santana argues, was concluding that he understood that his statements could be used by law enforcement against him based on the fact that he subsequently requested to speak to the officers without being recorded and declined to provide his signature for the officer's interview notes.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 11 (citing\n   <em>\n    Santana\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12451932\" index=\"86\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/mass/477/610/#p611\">\n    477 Mass. at 619\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"87\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=82%20N.E.3d%20986\">\n    82 N.E.3d 986\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ).

Santana insists that just because a statement is made in self-interest does not mean that it cannot also be involuntary.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Further, Santana argues that an interviewee can simultaneously fear retaliation and the use of his statements in court.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   The record, Santana claims, evidences that \"he did not want his words to be used in court [and] specifically asked for (and received) assurances that they would not be so used.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Therefore, Santana contends that the Supreme Judicial Court violated his Fifth and Fourteenth Amendment rights when it included these factual determinations in its totality-of-the-circumstances analysis of whether his statement was voluntary.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-158\">\n   The Supreme Judicial Court's decision here did not result from an \"unreasonable determination of the facts in light of the evidence presented.\"\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"91\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%202254\">\n    28 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 2254\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (d)(2) - (e).
