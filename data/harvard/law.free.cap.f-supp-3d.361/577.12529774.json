Plaintiff, a citizen and resident of Poland, claims Officers Wheeler, Adcock, Blakely, Bronte-Tinkew, Clark, Grande, Jakowicz, Labarca, McNaught, Mulhern, and Zesk (\"the police defendants\") are liable for violating plaintiff's Fourteenth and Fourth Amendment rights pursuant to\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201983\">\n    42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983\n   </extracted-citation>\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   and for gross negligence under Virginia law. Plaintiff also brings a claim of negligence against defendants Brooks, a lifeguard and plaintiff's former co-worker, and American Pool Inc., plaintiff's former employer (\"the pool defendants\"). The police defendants and the pool defendants have each moved to dismiss plaintiff's Complaint on a variety of grounds.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   At issue on defendants' motions to dismiss are the following questions:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-11\">\n   (i) Are the police defendants entitled to qualified immunity with respect to plaintiff's Fourteenth Amendment claim brought pursuant to \u00a7 1983 ?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-12\">\n   Put differently, did the police defendants violate plaintiff's \"clearly established\" substantive due process rights by preventing a lifeguard from taking timely steps to rescue plaintiff from drowning himself?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-13\">\n   (ii) Did the police defendants violate plaintiff's substantive due process rights by their own failure to prevent plaintiff from drowning himself?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-14\">\n   (iii) Did the police defendants violate plaintiff's right against unreasonable seizure by failing to prevent plaintiff from drowning himself after securing plaintiff within the fenced-in area around the pool?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-15\">\n   (iv) Did the police defendants' failure to prevent plaintiff from drowning himself constitute gross negligence?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-16\">\n   (v) Does Virginia's workers compensation scheme cover plaintiff's negligence claims against the pool defendants and thus deprive this court of subject matter jurisdiction over that claim?\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   <strong>\n    I.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   The standards that govern a motion to dismiss for lack of subject-matter jurisdiction under Rule 12(b)(1), Fed.

P., are well settled and thus require only brief elaboration.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   Pursuant to Rule 12(b)(6), a complaint must be dismissed when the plaintiff fails to state a claim upon which relief can be granted. The district court must examine the face of the complaint and, taking all allegations of fact as true and construing them in the light most favorable to plaintiff, decide whether the complaint contains \"sufficient factual matter, accepted as true, to 'state a claim to relief that is plausible on its face.' \"\n   <em>\n    Ashcroft v.

Compl. \u00b6 6. Plaintiff obtained employment with defendant American Pool Inc. as a pool attendant at the Riverside Apartments swimming pool in Fairfax County, Virginia.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 7, 9. On May 23, 2016, plaintiff arrived in the United States, and three days later plaintiff began his employment with defendant American Pool Inc.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 9. Defendant American Pool Inc. trained plaintiff to clean the pool, arrange deck chairs, and check the pH level of the water.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 10. Plaintiff did not know how to swim, and defendant American Pool Inc. did not require him to perform lifeguarding duties as part of his employment.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 10, 16.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   On May 30, 2016, plaintiff arrived for work at the Riverside Apartments pool. At some point that afternoon, plaintiff experienced a psychotic episode,\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   which was caused by plaintiff's bipolar disorder.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 2, 13, 53. Plaintiff exhibited irrational behavior, such as arguing with guests over the colored wristbands required for entry into the pool and grabbing one young woman by the arm and ripping off her wristband.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 11. Plaintiff began talking to himself in Polish and walking around the pool without purpose and appeared to be emotionally or mentally distressed.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Defendant Brooks, who was a lifeguard also employed by defendant American Pool Inc., witnessed plaintiff's behavior and called for police assistance.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 12. The police defendants responded to the pool a few minutes later.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 13, 14.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   When the police defendants arrived, the police attempted to communicate with plaintiff several times, but plaintiff did not acknowledge the police defendants.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 14. Instead, plaintiff blew a lifeguard whistle and continually moved away from the police defendants.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   After discussing how to proceed, the police defendants directed all pool patrons to leave the pool area and locked the fence that surrounded the pool.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 17. The only individuals that remained inside the fenced-in pool area were plaintiff, defendant Brooks, and the police defendants.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Defendant Brooks informed the police defendants about plaintiff's behavior and told the police defendants that plaintiff was experiencing a psychotic episode.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 15. Defendant Brooks also told the police defendants that plaintiff could not swim.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 16. According to the Complaint, the police defendants understood that plaintiff's serious mental health crisis and related behavior made plaintiff a potential risk of harm to himself and to others at the pool.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 19.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   The police defendants called one of plaintiff's Polish roommates and a Polish-speaking police officer to the pool to attempt to communicate with plaintiff, whose English was poor.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 6, 21, 25. Again, plaintiff would not acknowledge either the Polish-speaking officer or plaintiff's Polish roommate.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 21, 25.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   Plaintiff continued to exhibit unusual and erratic behavior. Plaintiff paced around the pool and continued to talk to himself, apparently praying in Polish.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 24. Plaintiff threw his cell phone into the deep end of the pool and then walked into the pool, submerging himself in the deep end, which was eight feet deep.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 24, 37. After recovering the cell phone, plaintiff emerged from the pool. Plaintiff then threw his cell phone into the deep end of the pool a second time. Again, plaintiff walked into the pool and submerged himself underwater. And again, plaintiff emerged from the pool after recovering the cell phone. Plaintiff then climbed into a lifeguard tower and shouted and blew his whistle for no reason. The police defendants continued to attempt to communicate with plaintiff, but plaintiff did not respond.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 24.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   After some period of time, plaintiff finally stood calmly and silently for about one minute near the ladder at the shallow end of the pool.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 26, 28. Plaintiff then walked slowly to the ladder and entered the water a third time.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 28. The police defendants neither ordered plaintiff not to re-enter the pool nor physically prevented plaintiff from re-entering the pool.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 27.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   Plaintiff again walked into the deep end of the pool and submerged himself underwater.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 28, 29. Defendant Brooks and the police defendants stood around the pool and watched plaintiff.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 30. After some period of time, plaintiff grabbed onto the pool's drain cover underwater in the deep end and struggled not to surface. Plaintiff eventually vomited underwater and then stopped moving.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 31. After being underwater for one minute and twenty-two seconds, plaintiff released the air retained in his lungs. The police defendants and defendant Brooks continued to stand around the pool and look at plaintiff underwater.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 32. According to the Complaint, the police defendants and defendant Brooks should have recognized that plaintiff was at risk of drowning after plaintiff had been submerged for thirty seconds and had released the air from his lungs.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 34, 39.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   At some point in time unspecified by the Complaint, defendant Brooks expressed that he needed to enter the pool to rescue plaintiff.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 40. As a trained lifeguard with access to rescue equipment, defendant Brooks was fully capable of rescuing plaintiff.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 41. Nonetheless, one or more of the police defendants ordered defendant Brooks not to enter the pool.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 40. Although defendant Brooks did not agree with the police defendants, defendant Brooks obeyed the police defendants' order.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 42.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   After plaintiff had been submerged for over two and one-half minutes, defendant Brooks again requested permission from the police defendants to dive into the pool and rescue plaintiff. This time the police defendants gave defendant Brooks permission to dive into the pool.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 43. Defendant Brooks brought plaintiff's body to the surface, and several of the police defendants removed their belts and jackets and jumped into the pool to help drag plaintiff out of the pool.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 45, 47. In total, plaintiff had been submerged for two minutes and forty-four seconds.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 46.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   The police defendants began to perform cardio-pulmonary resuscitation (\"CPR\") on plaintiff.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 47. Emergency medical technicians (\"EMTs\") arrived about two minutes later and used a ladder to climb over the locked pool fence to reach plaintiff.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 48. Upon arrival, the EMTs found that plaintiff was not breathing and did not have a pulse.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 49. The EMTs continued CPR and applied an automatic external defibrillator to plaintiff's chest.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 50. The EMTs revived plaintiff and transported plaintiff to Fairfax Hospital Emergency Department.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 51.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   Plaintiff remained in the hospital's Heart and Vascular Institute until June 8, 2016. Thereafter, plaintiff was transferred to the hospital's psychiatric unit, where he was diagnosed with bipolar disorder and was found to have suffered from psychosis, thought disorganization, delusions, and paranoia on May 30, 2016. Plaintiff retained only scattered memories of what had occurred during his psychotic episode.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 53. On June 14, 2016, plaintiff was discharged from the hospital and returned to Poland with his father.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 54.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   Based on these facts, plaintiff has brought suit to recover damages for the physical and mental injury, emotional distress, and medical expenses caused by the conduct allegedly taken by defendants in response to plaintiff's psychotic episode and attempt to drown himself. Specifically, plaintiff claims the police defendants are liable for violating plaintiff's Fourteenth and Fourth Amendment rights pursuant to\n   <extracted-citation index=\"11\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201983\">\n    42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983\n   </extracted-citation>\n   and for gross negligence under Virginia law.

To the contrary, the police officer had violated the wife's substantive due process rights under the state-created danger doctrine because, by conspiring to prevent the arrest of a man who had violently abused his wife, the police officer committed affirmative acts that directly enabled the man to murder his wife.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 344.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-52\">\n   The above cases are instructive both for determining the contours of an individual's substantive due process rights under the state-created danger doctrine and for considering whether the due process right that plaintiff claims was violated in the instant case was clearly established at the time of the police defendants' conduct. In the latter respect, plaintiff argues that under the state-created danger doctrine the police defendants violated plaintiff's Fourteenth Amendment right to substantive due process by ordering defendant Brooks, a trained lifeguard, to refrain from rescuing plaintiff from drowning until plaintiff had been submerged for two and one-half minutes. Even assuming,\n   <em>\n    arguendo\n   </em>\n   , this constitutes a cognizable due process violation under the state-created danger doctrine-an assumption that is not without its difficulties\n   <footnotemark>\n    8\n   </footnotemark>\n   -plaintiff's claim must nevertheless be dismissed on the basis of qualified immunity.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-53\">\n   As a review of the Supreme Court's and the Fourth Circuit's state-created danger cases reflects, the police defendants did not violate any clearly established substantive due process right enjoyed by plaintiff. As the Fourth Circuit has repeatedly emphasized, the state-created danger doctrine is \"narrow.\"\n   <em>\n    Doe\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4289418\" index=\"82\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/795/429/\">\n    795 F.3d at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   437 ;\n   <em>\n    Robinson\n   </em>\n   , 536 F.

Put simply, the Supreme Court's and the Fourth Circuit's decisions do not place \"beyond debate\" and do not give \"fair notice\" to the police defendants here that it is unlawful under the state-created danger doctrine for a police officer to delay a lifeguard for two and one-half minutes from attempting to rescue a mentally unstable individual from drowning himself.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Ashcroft\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5924024,12459540\" index=\"83\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/563/731/\">\n    563 U.S. at 741\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5924024,12459540\" index=\"84\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/563/731/\">\n    131 S.Ct. 2074\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ;\n   <em>\n    Brosseau\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5925704\" index=\"85\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/543/194/#p198\">\n    543 U.S. at 198\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5925704\" index=\"86\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/543/194/#p198\">\n    125 S.Ct. 596\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . This is so not simply because the Fourth Circuit has not considered a case factually on all fours with the instant case; rather, this conclusion is also based on the fact that a police officer's efforts to enable a third party to commit a violent act, which constituted a state-created danger in\n   <em>\n    Robinson\n   </em>\n   , are of \"an entirely different nature\" from a police officer's temporary inhibition of a would-be rescuer in an emergency situation involving a person exhibiting psychotic behavior.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Doe\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4289418\" index=\"87\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/795/429/\">\n    795 F.3d at 442\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Thus, because a review of the controlling precedent demonstrates that plaintiff's asserted due process right was not clearly established at the time of the police defendants' conduct, the police defendants are entitled to qualified immunity from plaintiff's due process claim.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-54\">\n   Seeking to avoid this conclusion, plaintiff does not meaningfully dispute that the police defendants did not violate any due process right that was clearly established under existing Fourth Circuit precedent. Instead, plaintiff argues that the police defendants' alleged conduct was so egregious that no precedent was necessary to give the police defendants fair notice that their conduct was unlawful and violative of plaintiff's rights. To be sure, the Fourth Circuit has recognized that \"when the defendants' conduct is so patently violative of the constitutional right that reasonable officials would know without guidance from the courts that the action was unconstitutional, closely analogous pre-existing case law is not required to show that the law is clearly established.\"\n   <em>\n    Clem v.

United States\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"10540983\" index=\"89\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/910/1422/#p1433\">\n    910 F.2d 1422\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 1433 (7th Cir. 1990). The question, then, is whether the police defendants' alleged conduct exhibited such arbitrary disregard toward plaintiff's life that a reasonable officer in the police defendants' shoes would have known without guidance from the courts that the conduct was unconstitutional.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-55\">\n   In this respect, the facts alleged in the Complaint demonstrate that the police defendants' conduct was not so patently arbitrary and violative of plaintiff's due process rights that a reasonable official would have known that it was unconstitutional. According to the Complaint, the police defendants observed that plaintiff had twice walked to the deep end of the pool where he fully submerged himself for a period of time before safely emerging from the deep end and exiting the pool of his own accord. Moreover, prior to plaintiff's attempt to drown himself, the police defendants were\n   aware that plaintiff was mentally unstable and that plaintiff had taken a series of bizarre and aggressive actions, including grabbing a young woman by the arm, arguing with pool patrons, throwing his cell phone into the pool, shouting at the police, and otherwise exhibiting a total lack of responsiveness to efforts by the police defendants and other crisis intervention personnel to communicate with him. Indeed, according to the Complaint, the police were aware that plaintiff's psychotic episode made plaintiff \"a potential risk of harm to himself and others at the pool.\" Compl. \u00b6 19. For these reasons, there was a sufficient basis on which the police defendants could rationally conclude that it was neither safe nor necessary for defendant Brooks to attempt to rescue plaintiff during the period of time that the police defendants ordered defendant Brooks not to enter the pool.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-56\">\n   Therefore, in view of the circumstances confronting the police defendants, it is appropriate to conclude that the police defendants' conduct, namely ordering a lifeguard not to enter the pool to rescue plaintiff from drowning himself until plaintiff had been submerged for two and one-half minutes, was not so irrational or taken with such disregard toward plaintiff's safety that a reasonable police officer would have known such conduct violated plaintiff's constitutional rights. To the contrary, the police defendants might reasonably have decided that to allow the lifeguard to enter the pool at the time of the first request would have endangered the lifeguard and plaintiff and that it was appropriate to wait to see if plaintiff would emerge from the pool voluntarily as he had done twice before.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-57\">\n   Importantly, this is not to say that the police defendants' decision to inhibit the lifeguard for as long as they did was prudent or correct. Yet, as the Sixth Circuit has persuasively stated, \"public safety officials should have broad authority to decide when civilian participation in rescue efforts is unwarranted. If police officials are not satisfied that would-be rescuers are equipped to make a viable rescue attempt ... it would certainly be permissible to forbid such an attempt.\"\n   <em>\n    Beck v.

Thus, for the reasons already stated, it would be inappropriate to conclude, based on the facts alleged in the Complaint, that the police defendants' actions were so egregious as to deny qualified immunity to those defendants in the absence of clear guidance from controlling precedent.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-58\">\n   Furthermore, the case on which plaintiff chiefly relies in support of his argument to the contrary,\n   <em>\n    Ross v.

First, unlike\n   <em>\n    Ross\n   </em>\n   , where the deputy sheriff obstructed private rescue efforts for twenty minutes and no rescue was conducted until the boy had been underwater for thirty minutes, the police defendants here prevented defendant Brooks from entering the pool at most for only two and one-half minutes.\n   <footnotemark>\n    10\n   </footnotemark>\n   This substantial difference in time is significant because delaying private rescue efforts for a relatively brief period of time is far less indicative of a disregard for the safety of the drowning individual and may be necessary to enable public safety officials to assess an uncertain emergency situation before exercising their discretion to allow civilians to attempt a rescue. Second, and more importantly, for the reasons already stated, the police defendants here, unlike the deputy sheriff in\n   <em>\n    Ross\n   </em>\n   , had an ample basis on which to conclude that it was neither safe nor necessary for defendant Brooks to attempt to rescue plaintiff for at least some period of time. Again, this is not to say that the police defendants correctly judged the necessary amount of time by which to delay defendant Brooks's rescue efforts; indeed, in hindsight it appears that the police defendants may have waited too long. But unlike the deputy sheriff in\n   <em>\n    Ross\n   </em>\n   , the police defendants had adequate, rational reasons to support their decision to prevent defendant Brooks from entering the pool for a brief period of time. Therefore,\n   <em>\n    Ross\n   </em>\n   is inapposite and does not compel the conclusion that the police defendants' conduct was sufficiently arbitrary such that a reasonable police officer in their shoes would have known the conduct was clearly unconstitutional.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-60\">\n   Accordingly, the police defendants are entitled to the defense of qualified immunity to plaintiff's state-created danger due process claim.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-61\">\n   <strong>\n    B.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-62\">\n   In Count I, plaintiff claims that the police defendants also violated plaintiff's substantive due process rights by failing to prevent plaintiff to enter into the pool while suffering a mental health episode.

Specifically, the Complaint alleges that after the police arrived at the Riverside Apartments pool, they took the following steps: (i) they attempted to communicate with plaintiff by calling to the scene crisis intervention-trained officers and a Polish-speaking officer; (ii) they monitored plaintiff during the entire time they were on the scene; (iii) they jumped into the pool to help defendant Brooks bring plaintiff above water and out of the pool; and (iv) they performed CPR after plaintiff was removed from the pool. Together, these actions clearly demonstrate that the police defendants exercised some care in assisting plaintiff and that the police defendants were not completely indifferent or neglectful with respect to plaintiff's safety. Indeed, distilled to its essence, plaintiff argues that the police defendants were grossly negligent not because they did nothing to rescue plaintiff, but because they waited too long to rescue plaintiff. This argument fails because, as the Supreme Court of Virginia has made clear, \"the standard for gross negligence [in Virginia] is one of indifference, not inadequacy.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12646106\" index=\"122\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/se2d/791/730/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   Thus, because the facts alleged in\n   the Complaint establish that police the defendants exercised some degree of diligence and care in response to plaintiff's psychotic episode and attempted self-drowning, plaintiff's gross negligence claim fails to state a claim and must be dismissed.\n   <footnotemark>\n    12\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-73\">\n   <strong>\n    V.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-74\">\n   Finally, Counts VI and VII of the Complaint allege claims of negligence against the pool defendants on the ground that defendant Brooks allegedly abided by directions from the police defendants and failed to take steps to rescue plaintiff from drowning until plaintiff had been submerged for over two and one-half minutes.

Each of these factors is satisfied here because the injury that plaintiff allegedly suffered was a near drowning and cardio-pulmonary arrest caused by defendant Brooks's alleged failure to rescue plaintiff in a timely manner. The particular time, place, and occasion of this injury was at the Riverside Apartments pool on May 30, 2016 during the two to three minutes that elapsed from the time plaintiff submerged himself in the deep end of the pool until the time defendant Brooks eventually entered the pool to rescue plaintiff. The identifiable, precipitating event that caused plaintiff's injury was defendant Brooks's allegedly negligent failure to prevent plaintiff from drowning himself in a timely manner. And as a result of plaintiff's injury,\n   <em>\n    i.e.\n   </em>\n   the cardio-pulmonary arrest plaintiff suffered as a result of nearly drowning, plaintiff's body experienced a mechanical or structural change in the form of an inability to breathe or to circulate blood. Accordingly, it is clear that the injury for which Counts VI and VII seek relief constitutes an \"injury by accident.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-77\">\n   To constitute an injury arising out of the plaintiff's employment, \"the employment must expose the employee to the particular danger causing the injury, notwithstanding the public's exposure generally to similar risks.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    17\n   </footnotemark>\n   <em>\n    Combs\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"165886\" index=\"129\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/va/259/503/#p508\">\n    259 Va. at 510\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"130\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=525%20S.E.2d%20278\">\n    525 S.E.2d 278\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

These principles, applied here, point persuasively to the conclusion that plaintiff's injury arose from his employment. Plaintiff's position as a pool attendant entailed duties such as cleaning the pool, arranging deck chairs around the pool, and checking the pH level of the water in the pool. Each of these responsibilities required plaintiff to work in close proximity to the pool. Thus, plaintiff's employment plainly exposed plaintiff to the danger of drowning in the pool and the danger that the on-duty lifeguard might fail to take adequate steps to rescue plaintiff from drowning. And it is clear that these workplace conditions bear a \"causal connection\" to the injury suffered by plaintiff on May 30, 2016.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    United Parcel Serv. of Am.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"2069033\" index=\"133\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/va/230/257/#p258\">\n    230 Va. at 258\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"134\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=336%20S.E.2d%20892\">\n    336 S.E.2d 892\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

It is clear-and the parties do not dispute-that the first two factors are satisfied here because plaintiff's injury occurred during his shift and in proximity to the pool that plaintiff was responsible for maintaining. Yet, whether plaintiff's injury occurred while he was fulfilling duties of his employment or while he was doing something incidental to those duties is a significantly closer question. Virginia courts have held that an employee's conduct at the time of an injury is incidental to his employment duties if that conduct is \"reasonably connected to the fulfillment of employment duties\"; it is not necessary to show that plaintiff's conduct was safe or otherwise reasonable.\n   <em>\n    Town &amp; Country Animal Hosp. v.

The question then is whether plaintiff's erratic, irrational, psychotic behavior occurring in temporal proximity to plaintiff's injury was reasonably connected to the fulfillment of plaintiff's employment duties.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-80\">\n   In this respect, the Supreme Court of Virginia's decision in\n   <em>\n    Combs v.

After concluding that Combs's injury constituted an accident that arose out of her employment, the Supreme Court of Virginia determined that Combs's injury also occurred in the course of her employment. This was so, the\n   <em>\n    Combs\n   </em>\n   Court held, because Combs was injured at a place where she was reasonably expected to be while engaged in an activity reasonably incidental to her employment by Virginia Power, namely temporarily deviating from work activities while she experienced her aneurysm-related migraine in Virginia Power's \"quiet room.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 511-512,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"150\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=525%20S.E.2d%20278\">\n    525 S.E.2d 278\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-81\">\n   The facts of\n   <em>\n    Combs\n   </em>\n   are closely apposite to the facts of the instant case and thus compel the same conclusion. Like the plaintiff in\n   <em>\n    Combs\n   </em>\n   , plaintiff here was at work performing his work-related tasks before he began to experience symptoms of his pre-existing bipolar condition. Plaintiff's symptoms manifested themselves in the form of a psychotic episode, in which plaintiff experienced delusions, exhibited a variety of erratic behavior, including submerging himself in the pool, and later retained only partial memories of what had occurred. It was during this psychotic episode that defendant Brooks failed to rescue plaintiff from the pool until after plaintiff had been underwater for almost three minutes. Thus, similar to the plaintiff in\n   <em>\n    Combs\n   </em>\n   , plaintiff here was injured by a co-worker while plaintiff had temporarily deviated from the performance of his assigned duties due to the sudden onset of the debilitating symptoms of his bipolar condition. To be sure, those symptoms involved\n   a series of bizarre actions by plaintiff, which would not ordinarily constitute the fulfillment of plaintiffs assigned duties. Yet, as recognized by the Supreme Court of Virginia in\n   <em>\n    Combs\n   </em>\n   , an employee's temporary deviation from his assigned tasks, stemming from the sudden onset of the symptoms of a pre-existing illness, is reasonably incidental to the performance of the employee's duties. Thus, plaintiff's injury occurred in the course of his employment because defendant Brooks failed to rescue plaintiff from the pool while plaintiff was doing something reasonably incidental to his work-related tasks, namely temporarily deviating from the performance of his assigned duties owing to the sudden onset of the symptoms of his bipolar condition.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-82\">\n   In sum, the injuries plaintiff claims he suffered as a result of the pool defendants' allegedly negligent rescue efforts were nearly drowning and experiencing cardio-pulmonary arrest. Those injuries were injuries by accident, arising out of, and in the course of plaintiff's employment. Therefore, the VWCA constitutes the exclusive remedy for plaintiff's negligence claims against the pool defendants, and Counts VI and VII must be dismissed for lack of jurisdiction.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-83\">\n   <strong>\n    VI.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-84\">\n   For the reasons stated above, the police defendants' motion to dismiss for failure to state a claim and the pool defendants' motion to dismiss for lack of jurisdiction must both be granted, and all Counts of the Complaint must be dismissed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-85\">\n   An appropriate Order will issue.\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-88\">\n    Plaintiff represented in his opposition to the police defendants' motion to dismiss that plaintiff consents to the dismissal of the due process claim alleged in Count II because it is duplicative of Counts I and III, which also allege due process claims.

In the instant case, it appears from the allegations in the Complaint that plaintiff was not of sound mind when he submerged himself in the deep end of the pool and struggled to avoid surfacing. Specifically, the Complaint alleges that plaintiff was suffering from psychosis and delusions and thus was not in touch with reality when he attempted to drown himself. Thus, assuming the truth of the factual allegations in the Complaint, it appears that plaintiff did not commit the crime of attempted suicide and thus is not barred from bringing his tort claims. In any event, it is unnecessary to reach or decide this issue because, as explained above, the Complaint's allegations are insufficient to demonstrate that the police defendants were grossly negligent.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"12\">\n   <p id=\"p-99\">\n    This conclusion finds further support in two additional facts alleged by the Complaint. First, plaintiff had twice walked to the deep end of the pool where he fully submerged himself for a period of time before safely emerging from the deep end and exiting the pool of his own accord. Second, before plaintiff attempted to drown himself, he had exhibited a series of bizarre and aggressive actions. Indeed, the Complaint specifically alleges that plaintiff's psychotic episode made plaintiff \"a potential risk of harm to himself and others at the pool.\"\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    Compl. \u00b6 19. These facts further weaken plaintiff's argument that the police defendants' delay in removing plaintiff from the water, alone, is sufficient to demonstrate that the police defendant were indifferent to plaintiff's safety because there were ample reasons to believe, at least for some period of time, that plaintiff needed no assistance and that it was not safe to attempt to remove plaintiff from the pool.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"13\">\n   <p id=\"p-100\">\n    Va.

This discussion misses the mark. The Complaint does not allege, and the pool defendants do not contend, that plaintiff's bipolar disease or the related psychotic manifestations of the disease are the injuries for which plaintiff seeks to recover via his negligence claims. Rather, the injuries alleged by plaintiff in the Complaint are plaintiff's near drowning and cardio-pulmonary arrest. Accordingly, the correct inquiry under the VWCA is whether these alleged injuries were injuries \"by accident arising out of and in the course of the employment.\" Va.
