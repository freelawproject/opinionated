Wright, United States District Judge\n   This case was initiated by Plaintiffs Paisley Park Enterprises, Inc., and Comerica Bank &amp; Trust, N.A., after a dispute arising from the posthumous release of several sound recordings by internationally renowned recording artist Prince Rogers Nelson. Several motions are pending before the Court. Defendant Brown &amp; Rosen, LLC, moves to dismiss the claims against it in Plaintiffs' third amended complaint. (Dkt. 330.) Plaintiffs oppose this motion and move to supplement the record. (Dkt. 360.) In addition, Plaintiffs move to dismiss the tortious interference counterclaim brought by Defendants George Ian Boxill; Rogue Music Alliance, LLC; Deliverance, LLC; David Staley; and Gabriel Solomon Wilson. (Dkts. 188, 306.) For the reasons addressed below, the Court grants Brown &amp; Rosen's motion to dismiss the claims against it and grants Plaintiffs' motion to supplement the record. The Court also grants in part and denies in part Plaintiffs' motion to dismiss the tortious interference counterclaim.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   <strong>\n    BACKGROUND\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   This lawsuit arises from the attempted commercialization of previously unreleased recordings of the acclaimed recording artist Prince Rogers Nelson (Prince), who died in 2016. Plaintiffs are Paisley Park Enterprises, Inc., and Comerica Bank &amp; Trust, N.A., as Personal Representative of the Estate of Prince Rogers Nelson. Defendants are George Ian Boxill, Rogue Music Alliance, LLC (RMA); Deliverance, LLC; David Staley; Gabriel Solomon Wilson; Brown &amp; Rosen, LLC (B &amp; R); and Sidebar Legal, PC.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   Plaintiffs allege that Defendants unlawfully possess and have commercially exploited several of Prince's sound recordings (Prince Recordings). Defendants counter that Plaintiffs have interfered with Defendants' lawful attempts to release these recordings.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   Boxill is a sound engineer who worked with Prince during his lifetime, both as a remodeling consultant for Paisley Park and a sound engineer. RMA is a music labelling service company operated by Staley and Wilson. Boxill, RMA, and Sidebar Legal jointly own Deliverance, LLC, an entity created to market and release the Prince Recordings. B &amp; R is a Massachusetts law firm that provided legal advice to RMA and Boxill regarding the authorship status of the Prince Recordings.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   Plaintiffs allege that Boxill executed a Confidentiality Agreement with Paisley Park Enterprises in 2004. The Confidentiality Agreement provides that recordings and other physical materials that resulted from Boxill's work with Prince \"shall remain Paisley's sole and exclusive property, shall not be used by [Boxill] in any way whatsoever, and shall be returned to Paisley immediately upon request.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   Two years later, in 2006, Boxill provided sound\n   engineering services to Prince with respect to the recordings at issue in this lawsuit. Plaintiffs assert that they own copyrights in the Prince Recordings and filed applications to register those copyrights.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   After Prince's death in 2016, Defendants sought to distribute the previously unreleased Prince Recordings. On March 16, 2017, B &amp; R drafted a letter to Sidebar Legal, opining that the Prince Recordings were a joint work by Prince and Boxill, and that both Prince and Boxill had rights to the recordings. To support their position that Boxill is\n   <em>\n    not\n   </em>\n   a joint author of the Prince Recordings, Plaintiffs sent a copy of the 2004 Confidentiality Agreement to B &amp; R on March 21, 2017. As relevant to Plaintiffs' claims against B &amp; R, Plaintiffs allege that B &amp; R allowed Defendants to circulate the March 16, 2017 opinion letter to third parties, even after being put on notice of the Confidentiality Agreement. Plaintiffs contend that Defendants, in turn, used the opinion letter to convince third parties to advertise and distribute the Prince Recordings. Boxill, RMA, and Deliverance began distributing the Prince Recordings online in April 2017.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   Plaintiffs initiated a lawsuit and removed the state-court action to this Court on April 18, 2017. Plaintiffs filed the third amended complaint, the subject of B &amp; R's pending motion, on June 14, 2018. In the third amended complaint, Plaintiffs assert four claims against B &amp; R: tortious interference with contract, indirect copyright infringement, and requests for a declaratory judgment and injunctive relief. B &amp; R moves to dismiss Plaintiffs' claims against it for lack of personal jurisdiction or, alternatively, for failure to state a claim on which relief can be granted. Boxill, RMA, Deliverance, Wilson and Staley have answered Plaintiffs' third amended complaint and asserted counterclaims against Plaintiffs. Plaintiffs move to dismiss Defendants' tortious interference counterclaim for failure to state a claim on which relief can be granted.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   <strong>\n    ANALYSIS\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   There are four pending motions before the Court. The Court first addresses the two motions related to the third amended complaint, B &amp; R's motion to dismiss and Plaintiffs' motion to supplement the record.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   The Court then addresses Plaintiffs' two motions to dismiss Defendants' counterclaim.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   <strong>\n    I.

Plaintiffs counter that B &amp; R's contact with Minnesota-through sales, conversations with the Prince Estate, and client advice-establish sufficient minimum contacts with the forum. Specifically, Plaintiffs allege that (1) with knowledge that the nationwide distribution would include sales to Minnesota, B &amp; R advised Boxill and RMA to distribute the Prince Recordings; (2) B &amp; R engaged in license negotiations and discussed Boxill's authorship status with the Prince Estate on multiple occasions; and (3) B &amp; R authored an opinion letter regarding a contract involving a Minnesota entity.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   The United States Court of Appeals for the Eighth Circuit considers five factors to determine the sufficiency of a defendant's contacts with the forum state: (1) the nature and quality of contacts, (2) the quantity of contacts, (3) the relation of the cause of action to the contacts, (4) the interest of the forum state in providing a forum for its residents, and (5) the convenience of the parties.\n   <em>\n    Land-O-Nod Co. v.

For the analysis here, factors one and two warrant further explanation.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   The first factor, the nature and quality of a defendant's contacts with the\n   forum state, considers how purposeful the defendant's contact is. A defendant's indirect sale to a forum state generally is insufficient to establish personal jurisdiction.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Asahi Metal Indus. Co. v.

Absent other contacts, B &amp; R's emails, phone calls, and opinion letter are not so purposefully directed to Minnesota to justify this Court's exercise of personal jurisdiction over B &amp; R.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    <em>\n     Burlington\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7650295\" index=\"33\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/97/1100/#p1102\">\n     97 F.3d at\n    </extracted-citation>\n    1103 ;\n    <em>\n     Nash Finch Co.\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7849030\" index=\"34\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp/867/866/#p868\">\n     867 F.Supp. at 868-69\n    </extracted-citation>\n    .\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-29\">\n    The second factor, the quantity of contacts, strongly favors neither Plaintiffs nor B &amp; R.

B &amp; R's alleged conduct relates to the causes of action asserted in the third amended complaint: tortious interference with contract, indirect copyright infringement, and declaratory judgment. The tortious interference with contract claim arises from B &amp; R's alleged notice of and response to the Confidentiality Agreement. The indirect copyright infringement claim and requested declaratory relief relate to B &amp; R's alleged encouragement of the distribution of the Prince Recordings.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-31\">\n    Likewise, the final two factors favor Plaintiffs. Because the Prince Estate is located in Minnesota, the state is both an interested and convenient forum. However, a state's interest in the litigation and convenience as a forum are of limited significance for the purpose of this analysis.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    <em>\n     Burlington\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7650295\" index=\"37\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/97/1100/#p1102\">\n     97 F.3d at 1102\n    </extracted-citation>\n    .\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-32\">\n    In summary, because the nature and quality of the asserted contacts weigh strongly against the Court's exercise of personal jurisdiction over B &amp; R, Plaintiffs have not made a prima facie showing that B &amp; R has sufficient minimum contacts with Minnesota.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-33\">\n    <strong>\n     B.\n     <em>\n      Calder\n     </em>\n     Test\n    </strong>\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-34\">\n    Plaintiffs allege that B &amp; R committed intentional torts directed at Minnesota which, in combination with the contacts described above, justify the Court's exercise of personal jurisdiction over B &amp; R.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-35\">\n    A defendant's tortious conduct can be a basis for personal jurisdiction.\n    <em>\n     Calder v.

Instead, personal jurisdiction under\n    <em>\n     Calder\n    </em>\n    is appropriate when a defendant purposefully targets the forum state, such as by directly selling an infringing product to retailers or customers in that state.\n    <em>\n     See, e.g.,\n    </em>\n    <em>\n     Dakota Indus., Inc. v.

Plaintiffs allege that B &amp; R committed intentional torts by allowing its opinion letter to be circulated after B &amp; R was aware of the Confidentiality Agreement, thereby encouraging the unlawful distribution of the Prince Recordings. And Plaintiffs maintain that B &amp; R knew its actions would primarily affect the Prince Estate, a Minnesota entity. Here, as in\n    <em>\n     Hicklin\n    </em>\n    , B &amp; R is an out-of-state entity that distributed a letter to out-of-state recipients. Although competitive effects were felt in Minnesota, this alone is not enough to invoke the Court's personal jurisdiction.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"10521398\" index=\"45\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/959/738/#p739\">\n     959 F.2d at 739\n    </extracted-citation>\n    . Plaintiffs' reliance on\n    <em>\n     Dakota\n    </em>\n    is unavailing. Unlike directly selling a product with an infringing trademark, B &amp; R passively allowed the continued circulation of its opinion letter to third parties who, in turn, decided to distribute and promote the Prince Recordings. Mere effects in Minnesota do not confer personal jurisdiction over B &amp; R.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    <em>\n     Johnson\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3706350\" index=\"46\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/614/785/#p794\">\n     614 F.3d at 797\n    </extracted-citation>\n    .\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-38\">\n    In sum, the contacts and conduct that Plaintiffs allege are insufficient to establish that B &amp; R has purposefully availed itself of Minnesota's laws. An out-of-state law firm provided advice to out-of-state clients. The advice happened to concern a Minnesota entity and several sales happened to be to Minnesota residents. But to subject B &amp; R to this Court's personal jurisdiction under these circumstances would discourage the dissemination of legal advice and expand the reach of personal jurisdiction well beyond its current limits. Accordingly, the Court dismisses without prejudice the claims in the third amended complaint against B &amp; R.\n    <footnotemark>\n     5\n    </footnotemark>\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-39\">\n    <strong>\n     II.

First, Plaintiffs argue that Defendants have not stated a claim on which relief can be granted because they have not identified a specific business partner or customer with whom Defendants could expect any future economic advantage. But Plaintiffs rely on\n    <em>\n     Gieseke\n    </em>\n    , which provides only the elements required to\n    <em>\n     prove\n    </em>\n    tortious interference with prospective economic advantage, not the elements required to\n    <em>\n     plead\n    </em>\n    that claim.\n    <em>\n     See\n     <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6947178\" index=\"63\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/nw2d/844/210/#p219\">\n      id.\n     </extracted-citation>\n    </em>\n    It is not clear from the\n    <em>\n     Gieseke\n    </em>\n    decision that identifying a specific business partner or customer is necessary to survive a motion to dismiss. However, even assuming without deciding that identification of a specific business partner or customer is a pleading requirement, Defendants satisfy this requirement. In their counterclaim, Defendants allege that one of the Prince Recordings, \"Deliverance,\" was the top-selling pre-order on iTunes before Apple removed the song from its platform and the second best-selling album pre-order on Amazon. These allegations clearly identify Apple and Amazon as specific business partners with whom Defendants expected to have an ongoing relationship. Accordingly, Plaintiffs' first argument fails.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-52\">\n    Second, Plaintiffs argue that Defendants have not alleged an independently tortious act. Plaintiffs maintain that any interference with Defendants' business partners was justified because Plaintiffs are entitled to enforce their intellectual property rights.

But\n    <em>\n     Select Comfort\n    </em>\n    is inapposite here because Defendants allege that Plaintiffs acted in bad faith. Defendants specifically allege that Plaintiffs intentionally misrepresented the Confidentiality Agreement and TRO. And by doing so, Plaintiffs knowingly made unfounded threats to take legal action against entities that distributed certain Prince Recordings. Accepting Defendants' allegations as true, as the Court must for the purpose of this motion to dismiss, Defendants have alleged an independently tortious act. The third element of a tortious interference with prospective economic advantage claim is met.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-53\">\n    Plaintiffs do not challenge the sufficiency of the pleadings with respect to the other elements of Defendants' tortious interference with prospective economic advantage counterclaim, nor does the Court determine that Defendants' allegations are lacking.

A careful review of the supplemental document does not change the Court's determination that B &amp; R's contacts with Minnesota are insufficient to establish personal jurisdiction.\n    </p>\n   </footnote>\n   <footnote label=\"6\">\n    <p id=\"p-68\">\n     Defendants combine the tortious interference with contracts claim and tortious interference with prospective economic advantage claim in a single count. Because tortious interference with contracts and tortious interference with prospective economic advantage have distinct elements, the Court analyzes each claim separately.\n    </p>\n   </footnote>\n   <footnote label=\"7\">\n    <p id=\"p-69\">\n     Plaintiffs argue that dismissal of the counterclaim should be with prejudice because Defendants have had two previous attempts to state a claim for relief properly. A district court, in its discretion, may dismiss a pleading for failure to state a claim with or without prejudice.\n     <em>\n      See\n     </em>\n     <em>\n      Orr v. Clements\n     </em>\n     ,\n     <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3498858\" index=\"65\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/688/463/#p465\">\n      688 F.3d 463\n     </extracted-citation>\n     , 465 (8th Cir. 2012). Dismissal with prejudice may be warranted if amending the pleading would be futile.\n     <em>\n      See\n     </em>\n     <em>\n      Pet Quarters, Inc. v. Depository Tr. &amp; Clearing Corp.\n     </em>\n     ,\n     <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5660232\" index=\"66\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/559/772/#p782\">\n      559 F.3d 772\n     </extracted-citation>\n     , 782 (8th Cir. 2009). Here, although Defendants have asserted this counterclaim on two prior occasions, this is the first instance that Defendants' counterclaim is the subject of a judicial ruling. And there is no indication in the record that it would be impossible for Defendants to adequately plead a tortious interference with contracts claim. For these reasons, the dismissal is without prejudice.\n    </p>\n   </footnote>\n  </p>\n </opinion>\n</casebody>\n"
