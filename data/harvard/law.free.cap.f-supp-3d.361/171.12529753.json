Defendants, all Boston Police Officers, spent the day patrolling the Saint Patrick's Day parade route, and after that, responding to party calls.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   At 5:54 p.m., a 911 caller reported a loud party at the intersection of East 6th Street and O Street in South Boston. According to the caller, the party participants were \"whipping\" beer bottles off the second-floor porch, which faced 6th Street. Officer Kaplan did not hear the 911 call, but he received notice from dispatch of a disturbance and the street intersection where the party was located.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   Around 7:29 p.m., when police officers, including Kaplan, Edwards, and Jean, approached East 6th Street and O Street, the only apartment with music and yelling was a first-floor apartment on 6th Street, later identified as Christopher Castagna's apartment. Officer Kaplan observed several people leave the apartment and other people inside drinking and dancing. Detective Jean observed what appeared to be someone vomiting on the sidewalk outside of the apartment. Detective Edwards heard loud music as he approached the apartment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   According to the officers, the front door of the apartment was open. (Although Plaintiffs attempted to show that the temperature was too cool for the door to be open, there was no dispute that people were entering and exiting the apartment, and there was no direct evidence to contradict the officers' assertion that at the moment they arrived, the door was ajar). Officer Kaplan stepped into the apartment first and yelled \"hello\" and \"Boston Police\" into the apartment. No one answered right away. Without asking for permission, Officer Kaplan and Detectives Edwards and Jean walked into the apartment. At this point, the people inside the apartment\n   stopped dancing, turned down the music, and walked over towards Officer Kaplan.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   Officer Kaplan testified that when he entered the apartment, his objective was to get the attention of the homeowners and to tell them to keep the doors shut and the noise down. Officers Edwards and Jean also testified that their objectives were to contact the owner and ask him to turn the music down. Officer Kaplan and Detective Jean further testified that they had no intention of arresting anyone at the party.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   After entering, the officers inquired about where the homeowners were. Some guests told the officers that the owner of the apartment, Christopher Castagna, was down the hall, in the bathroom. While Officer Kaplan and Detective Edwards stayed in the kitchen speaking to the guests, Detective Jean and another officer, Terry Cotton, walked down the hall.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   B.\n   <em>\n    The Officers' Entry Was Unlawful and Was Not Protected by Qualified Immunity\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   Plaintiffs argue that the entry of Officer Kaplan and Detectives Edwards and Jean into Plaintiffs' home and Christopher Castagna's bedroom was not supported by a warrant or exigent circumstances, and was not entitled to qualified immunity. Pls.' Mem. Supp. Mot. New Trial (\"Pls.' Mem.\") at 8-12 [# 293]. Defendants respond that exigent circumstances did exist and moreover, that the officers' actions were justified by an exception to the warrant requirement for police officers engaging in community caretaking functions. Defs.' Opp. Pls.' Mot. New Trial (\"Defs.' Opp.\") at 11-14 [# 298]. Defendants further argue that the officers are also entitled to qualified immunity due to the unsettled nature of the community caretaking exception in 2013, at the time of the entry.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 16.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   <em>\n    1.

The weight of the evidence does not support this claim of a concern for the safety of underage party goers, let alone a need for emergency assistance. Although Detective Jean testified that he saw someone vomiting twice outside of the apartment, he also admitted that he did not look for or inquire inside about the person who vomited. No other officer testified that they observed any vomiting inside or outside of the apartment. Prior to entering the apartment, none of the officers observed anything remarkable about the scene in the apartment; Officer Kaplan testified that he observed people dancing and Detective Edwards testified that he observed people chatting and drinking from cups.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   During the trial, none of the officers articulated any concern as to an emergency need to enter. Nor did the officers articulate a specific safety concern other than the possibility that the party goers may have been underage, and as to that concern, none of the officers testified to asking any party goers their age or for identification. Officer Kaplan testified that upon entering the home, the guests were cooperative. None of the officers testified that the anyone tried to run or hide from the officers to avoid detection.\n   <em>\n    Cf.\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Howes v.

Defs.' Mem. at 14-16 [# 298]. For qualified immunity to apply, the court must explore \"whether the facts that a plaintiff has alleged or shown make out a violation of a constitutional right\" and \"whether the right at issue was 'clearly established' at the time of defendant's alleged conduct.\"\n   <em>\n    Matalon\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4357851\" index=\"50\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/806/627/#p633\">\n    806 F.3d at 633\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (quotations and citations omitted). Defendants fail the first prong, as detailed above. The court turns here to the second prong and finds the right at issue to be clearly established at the time of Defendants' warrantless entry into Plaintiffs' home.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   Defendants rely on the First Circuit's decision in\n   <em>\n    MacDonald\n   </em>\n   , where the court stated that \" 'the reach of the community caretaking doctrine is poorly defined' outside of the motor vehicle milieu,\" that the court \" 'has not decided whether the community caretaking exception applies to police activities involving a person's home,' \" and that the First Circuit's \"survey of the case law revealed that 'the scope and boundaries of the community caretaking exception [were] nebulous.' \" Defs.' Mem. at 14-15 [# 298] (quoting\n   <em>\n    MacDonald\n   </em>\n   , 745 F.3d at 13-14 ). Moreover, Defendants note, the First Circuit concluded that \" 'neither the general dimensions of the community caretaking exception nor the case law addressing the application of that exception provides the sort of red flag that would have semaphored to reasonable police officers that their entry into the plaintiff's home was illegal.' \"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   (quoting\n   <em>\n    MacDonald\n   </em>\n   , 745 F.3d at 15 ). Defendants' reliance on the First Circuit's comments on the poorly defined reach of the doctrine outside of the automobile context, without consideration of the specific facts at issue in that case or here, suggests that, in their view, officers are immune from all entry and search of an occupied home so long as the officer is not engaged in criminal investigation and claims instead a \"community caretaking\" function. The court disagrees.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   Although the First Circuit did find the officers' entry into the home in\n   <em>\n    MacDonald\n   </em>\n   to be protected by qualified immunity, the facts in\n   <em>\n    MacDonald\n   </em>\n   were quite different than those here. In\n   <em>\n    MacDonald\n   </em>\n   , police officers responded to a call from a citizen concerned about a neighbor's front door standing wide open. 745 F.3d at 10. The police officers first interviewed the citizen, then approached the neighbor's home, announced their presence, and entered the home only after receiving no response.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   The entry and search of a home with an open door and no response from any inhabitant was taken \"to ensure that nothing was amiss.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 14. As the court noted, \"given the parade of horribles that could easily be imagined had the officers simply turned tail, a plausible argument can be made that the officers' actions were reasonable under the circumstances.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   The language concerning the absence of a \"red flag\" followed the court's discussion of cases in other states finding the community caretaking exception applicable on facts, similar to those in\n   <em>\n    MacDonald\n   </em>\n   , involving\n   the entry of homes where doors were open, no occupants responded to the officers' inquiry, and there were true safety concerns.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   Here, in contrast, while the door was open, the front room was filled with people, and Defendants' reason for entering was to find the owner and have him turn down the music. Even if a plausible argument can be made that the officers' initial step across the threshold of the open door was reasonable as necessary to obtain the partygoers attention, there is no argument that the officers' further entry into the home was reasonable once the partygoers' attention was obtained. Unlike in\n   <em>\n    MacDonald\n   </em>\n   , no \"parade of horribles ... [can] ... be imagined\" if the officers simply had directed the guests to keep the music down or had waited outside for the guests to bring the owner to the door.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   The First Circuit again addressed qualified immunity in connection with a community caretaking argument in\n   <em>\n    Matalon\n   </em>\n   .

He knocked on the door, and Christopher Castagna opened it. The room was not a bathroom, but a bedroom, with Christopher Castagna's girlfriend, Samantha Pratt, his friend John Doran, and Gavin Castagna inside of the room.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-52\">\n   Detective Jean testified further that after Christopher Castagna opened the door and saw Detective Jean, Christopher Castagna promptly shut the door on Detective Jean's foot. Detective Jean testified that he pushed the door open, and entered the room, and that after he entered the room, Christopher Castagna pushed him. (Christopher Castagna denies being the person who pushed Detective Jean). Officer Kaplan and Detective Edwards testified that they ran to Christopher Castagna's bedroom after they heard yelling and swearing coming from the room.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-53\">\n   Detective Jean informed Christopher Castagna that he was under arrest. The officers did not have handcuffs and they requested backup officers to bring handcuffs to the apartment. Detective Jean and Officer Cotton escorted Christopher Castagna from the bedroom into the kitchen area. Before doing so, the officers asked everyone else in the bedroom to leave that room, and Detective Jean told Christopher Castagna to tell the party goers to leave the apartment. When he was brought to the kitchen, rather than asking the party goers to leave, Christopher Castagna instead told everyone to record everything with their phone cameras.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-54\">\n   At some point, backup officers, including Anthony Troy, Jay Tully, Kamau Pritchard, and Michael Bizzozero arrived at the apartment with handcuffs. Officers testified that once they obtained handcuffs, Christopher Castagna actively resisted arrest, by stiffening and then flailing his arms; the officers eventually had to pull him to the ground to arrest him. (Christopher Castagna denies resisting arrest). Christopher Castagna was eventually handcuffed, escorted from his apartment, and brought to the police station. He was charged with assault and battery on a police officer, keeper of a disorderly house, and disturbing the peace.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-55\">\n   Officers testified further that Gavin Castagna attempted to stop a police officer from arresting another party goer by grabbing the officer's shoulder. Sergeant Troy testified that he grabbed Gavin Castagna, told him to back off, and attempted to place him under arrest, but Gavin attempted to struggle and pulled away from Sergeant Troy. Both Sergeant Troy and Gavin Castagna fell to the ground. Ultimately, other officers assisted in placing handcuffs on Gavin Castagna and he was brought to the police station. Gavin Castagna was initially charged with assault and battery on a police officer and resisting arrest; however, the charges were amended to disturbing the peace and resisting arrest.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-56\">\n   B.\n   <em>\n    Plaintiffs Are Not Entitled to a New Trial on their False Arrest Claims\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-57\">\n   Plaintiffs further argue that the court provided incomplete jury instructions as to the elements for disturbing the peace and disorderly conduct, and that\n   these incomplete instructions may have allowed the jury to improperly find probable cause to arrest on these grounds.

Christopher Castagna testified that the men who entered his room were \"wearing masks\" and that he initially thought that he was being robbed. Officer Kaplan testified that when he, the only non-black police officer, entered the room, Christopher Castagna became calmer and spoke to him in a normal level.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-63\">\n   The day after the arrests, Gavin Castagna sent and received multiple text messages to friends related to the incident. Their text messages, introduced as Exhibits 75 and 86 at trial, include statements such as, \"We all need to meet up sometime in the next few days to go over the events with each other so we can have the story for our lawyers,\" and \"We are getting all our stories together at Chris's right now.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-64\">\n   Gavin Castagna's text communications also used derogatory language, including racial slurs, in describing the police officers. In less explicit messages, he stated, \"[the police officers] were all huge black cops from the gang unit in Roxbury,\" \"I felt like I was in a rap video,\" and \"Cause black cops hate whites.\" Gavin Castagna also described the incident as \"a matter of race. Black cops beating up white people.\" Six months later, he still referred to the officers in text messages using racial slurs.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-65\">\n   B.\n   <em>\n    Closing Arguments\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-66\">\n   Plaintiffs object to portions of defense counsel's closing argument, where counsel stated as follows:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-67\">\n   You have seen Chris and Gavin testify in this courtroom. They presented very well. Very polite. Nice suits. But Trial Chris and Trial Gavin are not the real Chris and the real Gavin. Trial Chris and Trial Gavin are not the Chris and Gavin that these officers encountered on March 17, 2013. Real Chris assaults police officers, and Real Gavin is a racist. But that's not a good look when you're trying to get a jury to award you damages, which is why Attorney Klehm told you at the beginning of this case, in his opening statement, that you're going to hear some racially charged language that came from Gavin Castagna, but don't pay attention to that. It's not important. Don't let it distract you. Chris and Gavin don't want you to pay attention to who they really are or what they really did that day because they would prefer that you use your imaginations. And those are not my words. That is another quote from Gavin. He said, \"The video going black is good because it leaves it up to people's imaginations.\"\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-68\">\n   And so they have concocted this theory, which Attorney Falkner just called a battle plan, where the police are targeting Gavin and Chris because they're white, where these officers are knocking and punching phones out of people's hands to prevent them from showing their misconduct, where the police are putting on masks and stepping on Chris' neck and saying things like, \"They've got cell phones, come in hard.\" That is not reality. In fact, I think all of these officers would agree that that sounds pretty unreasonable. But none of this stuff happened. This is a fiction that Chris and Gavin have created because, at the end of the day, they don't like that these police officers, especially black police officers, who Gavin refers to as the n-word, were in their home no matter how reasonable of an explanation the officers had to be there.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-69\">\n   As Attorney Klehm mentioned in his opening, Chris and Gavin weren't attacking all cops. He made that very clear. It's just something about this group in particular that Gavin and Chris have a problem with. And I submit to you that's because six out of the seven officers who entered that apartment originally were black and that, had Officer Kaplan been the officer to go into the bedroom that evening, we wouldn't be sitting here because, after all, the hostility of this whole incident only begins as a result of Chris and Gavin's initial interaction with Detective Jean.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-70\">\n   Tr.

There was no evidence whatsoever that Christopher had any kind of racial motives whatsoever, and it was suggested during the closing argument that Christopher, just like Gavin, was behaving on the basis of race. There was just no evidence that he had any kind of racial motive whatsoever. And I think it was unfair, unfairly prejudicial, and the jury needs to be instructed that there was nothing like that.

They argue further that the closing arguments unfairly painted Christopher Castagna as a racist, even though only Gavin Castagna had used a racial slur, and that Defendants' counsel left the jury to think that, because of his alleged racism, Christopher Castagna was part of a scheme to create a false story about the actions of the police officers, and that \"the claim that the brothers concocted a story about what happened because of the race of some of the officers is unfair and untrue.\" Pls.' Mem. at 17-20 [# 293]. Plaintiffs argue further that the court's curative instruction \"constituted plain error,\" and that the result was a \"substantial miscarriage of justice\" and requires a new trial as to all claims.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"80\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201983\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"80\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201983\">\n    at 17-18\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-81\">\n   A determination of whether a closing statement was prejudicial depends on the totality of the circumstances, including: \"(1) the nature of the comments; (2) their frequency; (3) their possible relevance to the real issues before the jury; (4) the manner in which the parties and the court treated the comments; (5) the strength of the case; and (6) the verdict itself.\"\n   <em>\n    Mejias-Aguayo v.

With or without the closing statement, the evidence\n   strongly supported the officers' version of events. Although the entry was improper as discussed, the evidence at trial was overwhelmingly supported Defendants' version of events. While the witnesses who testified on behalf of the Plaintiffs all claimed that they were not drunk at the time of the events, most conceded that they had been drinking since morning, making their recollection of events far less reliable than otherwise. And as Plaintiffs attempted to piece together what happened and may well have convinced themselves as to the truth of their version, the events they described did not seem credible. For example, while witnesses for Plaintiffs contended that they were assaulted for filming the officers, the jury appears to have found, and the court agrees, that the film footage does not support Plaintiffs' version of events. In another example, friend John Doran testified that he heard Sergeant Troy as Troy was entering the Castagna residence say something to the effect of, \"they have their phones out, come in hard.\" Doran also testified that he saw Brian Feltch, another friend, leaning over the railing near the doorway holding his phone as Sergeant Troy walked into the apartment. Troy testified meanwhile that he was hit in the face with the phone as he entered the apartment. While Feltch may not have intended to hit Troy in his face, Troy's recounting of being hit was far more credible than Doran's testimony that Troy told his officers to \"come in hard\" because the party goers had cell phones. Similarly, while Christopher Castagna testified that as he was being handcuffed, he was told to shut up and had his necked stepped on by Officer Bizzozero, and while he offered as evidence of this alleged assault, Trial Exhibit 15E, the exhibit only shows Officer Bizzozero looking down, and shows no evidence of this alleged brutal assault. The jury had more than ample reason to credit the officers' version of events.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-83\">\n   To the extent that defense counsel argued that Christopher Castagna's perceptions or reactions may have been based on racial stereotyping, there was no error. Christopher Castagna testified that when he first saw Detective Jean at his bedroom door, he believed that he was about to be robbed. Officer Kaplan testified that Christopher Castagna noticeably calmed down when he spoke him as opposed to when Detectives Jean and Edwards, two black police officers, spoke to him. Defendants' closing statement draws a reasonable inference based on these interactions. That Christopher Castagna initially thought the black officers were robbers (but may have understood that they were police officers once the white officer joined the others) is relevant, as it suggests that his perception of what was happening may well have been affected by stereotypes that affect understanding, actions and decisions in an unconscious manner. Defense counsel's comments on such evidence does not amount to a miscarriage of justice.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-84\">\n   Throughout the rest of defense counsel's 35-minute closing, defense counsel differentiated as to what the evidence established for each Plaintiff, arguing that \"Real Chris assaults police officers, and Real Gavin is a racist.\" Trial Tr. Day 8, 92:3-4 [# 296]. In addressing the text messages, defense counsel argued that they were indicative of Gavin Castagna's state of mind.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4220974\" index=\"83\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/597/474/#p490\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   103:1-104:1-17 (\"What matters is what Gavin thought at the time of the incident, and his text messages speak for themselves.\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-85\">\n   To the extent that defense counsel may have inferred anything negative about Christopher Castagna based on Gavin Castagna's\n   text messages, the court provided a curative instruction.
