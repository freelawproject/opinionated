Schiltz, United States District Judge\n  </author>\n  <p id=\"p-7\">\n   Defendant Ryan Manning is charged with possessing, producing, and attempting to produce child pornography. Manning moved to suppress evidence found when law-enforcement officers searched his home pursuant to a search warrant. Manning also moved to suppress statements that he made to law-enforcement officers during the search. This matter is before the Court on Manning's objection to the November 1, 2018 Report and Recommendation (\"R&amp;R\") of Magistrate Judge David T. Schultz. Judge Schultz recommends denying Manning's motions to suppress. The Court has conducted a de novo review.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20636\">\n    28 U.S.C. \u00a7 636\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (b)(1) ; Fed. R. Civ. P. 72(b). Based on that review, the Court agrees with Judge Schultz that Manning's suppression motions should be denied, although the Court's reasoning differs somewhat from Judge Schultz's. The\n   Court therefore adopts the R&amp;R to the extent that it is consistent with this order.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-8\">\n   I. BACKGROUND\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   The Court will assume familiarity with the R&amp;R, including its description of the facts.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   ECF No. 55 [R&amp;R] at ---- - ----, ---- - ----. The challenged search warrant was issued on the basis of an affidavit submitted by Special Agent Dawn Johnson of the Minnesota Bureau of Criminal Apprehension (\"BCA\"). To briefly summarize the contents of that affidavit:\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   Omegle is an online social media platform that \"randomly pairs users in one-on-one chat sessions where they chat anonymously.\" ECF No. 33-1 at 5. Through the use of webcams and microphones, Omegle users may both see and speak to each other. ECF No. 33-1 at 5. Omegle users may also use third-party software to \"transmit pre-recorded video.\" ECF No. 33-1 at 5. Omegle \"automatically captures snapshots from users' webcam video streams\" for moderation teams to review. ECF No. 33-1 at 5. If Omegle moderators spot what appears to be child pornography, they forward the relevant snapshots to a \"CyberTipline\" run by the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children (\"NCMEC\").\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   ECF No. 33-1 at 4-5. NCMEC analysts \"examine and evaluate the content\" of CyberTips, add \"related information\" that might assist law enforcement, and then \"provide all information to the appropriate law enforcement agency for investigation.\" ECF No. 33-1 at 4.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   In August 2016, the BCA received a CyberTip from NCMEC involving apparent child pornography flagged by Omegle. ECF No. 33-1 at 4. The CyberTip reported that the snapshots came from a user identified as:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-12\">\n   ESP User ID: YS7SG2SLIP Address: 50.188.79.76 (Upload)07-19-2016 00:33:35 UTC\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   ECF No. 33-1 at 4. The CyberTip included twelve snapshots of a video stream intercepted by Omegle's moderation team. Agent Johnson (who specializes in investigating \"crimes against children\" and \"crimes related to predatory offenders\") reviewed all twelve snapshots. ECF No. 33-1 at 4-5. Through further investigation and visual surveillance, Agent Johnson traced the Omegle account to Manning.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   ECF No. 33-1 at 4-6.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   On December 15, 2016, Agent Johnson applied for a warrant to search Manning's residence, vehicles, and belongings. ECF No. 33-1 at 1-3, 10. As noted, Agent Johnson submitted an affidavit in support of her application. Judge Allen Oleisky issued the warrant the same day. ECF No. 33-1 at 13. The BCA executed the warrant on the following day, ECF No. 55 at ----, and discovered evidence of child pornography. During the search of his home, Manning made several incriminating statements in response to questions asked by Agent Johnson. Manning made those statements after Agent Johnson told him that he was not in custody and not under arrest. Gov't Ex. 1A at 2.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   Manning now moves to suppress both the evidence found during the search of his home and the statements that he made to Agent Johnson.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   II.

Agent Johnson described the CyberTip that Omegle sent to NCMEC after discovering that an Omegle user had streamed \"apparent child pornography.\" ECF No. 33-1 at 4. Agent Johnson reviewed all twelve snapshots in the CyberTip and included in her affidavit a description of the snapshot depicting child pornography.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   ECF No. 33-1 at 5. Agent Johnson's detailed description of that snapshot was sufficient to establish a fair probability that one Omegle user had transmitted child pornography to another in the course of a video chat.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Mutschelknaus\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5687770\" index=\"10\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/592/826/#p828\">\n    592 F.3d at 828-29\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   Moreover, Agent Johnson's affidavit provided strong evidence that Manning had been one of the two Omegle users involved in that video chat. As Agent Johnson explained in her affidavit, the CyberTip included an IP address that she traced to Manning's residence.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   ECF No. 33-1 at 5-6. The CyberTip also contained eleven snapshots of a man that Agent Johnson \"confident[ly]\" identified as Manning. ECF No. 33-1 at 5-6. Agent Johnson's affidavit further connected Manning to the Omegle video chat by explaining that the snapshot showing child pornography being livestreamed came from the \"same IP address\" and the \"same webcam\" as the eleven snapshots of Manning. ECF No. 33-1 at 5. Taken together, these facts gave Judge Oleisky a substantial basis for concluding not only that Manning had participated in the video chat, but that he had streamed child pornography from his residence.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    United States v. Gray\n   </em>\n   , No. 13-CR-0256 (DSD/SER),\n   <extracted-citation index=\"11\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2014%20WL%201415080\">\n    2014 WL 1415080\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *2 (D. Minn. Apr. 10, 2014) (finding probable cause where the \"affidavit in support of the warrant\" detailed the \"activities of\n   [the] investigators\" and \"connected their findings\" to the defendant).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   The R&amp;R asserted that Agent Johnson had failed to clarify in her affidavit \"whether the association of the image to Manning's IP address indicates that he was transmitting the video at issue or merely viewing it.\" ECF No. 55 at ---- n.2.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   That is not accurate. As just noted, Agent Johnson provided evidence that child pornography had been streamed from the same webcam and the same IP address as the images of Manning. That makes it fairly clear that Manning was doing the transmitting, and the other user was doing the viewing. In any event, even if Agent Johnson had provided no evidence whatsoever about whether it had been Manning or the other Omegle user who had been doing the transmitting, Judge Oleisky still had probable cause to issue the warrant. Agent Johnson explained in her affidavit that Omegle allows users to video chat \"one-on-one.\" ECF No. 33-1 at 5. Based on that fact, Judge Oleisky knew that either Manning or the other Omegle user had been streaming the child pornography. Even if the evidence pointing to Manning as the transmitter of the child pornography were ignored, Judge Oleisky would nevertheless have known that there was a 50/50 chance that Manning was the Omegle user who had streamed the child pornography.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    United States v. Thompson\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11532447\" index=\"12\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/210/855/#p860\">\n    210 F.3d 855\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 860 (8th Cir. 2000) (allowing judges to draw \"reasonable inferences\" when determining if \"probable cause exists to issue a warrant\"). Probable cause exists even when there is\n   <em>\n    less\n   </em>\n   than a 50/50 chance of finding evidence of a crime.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    United States v. Carbajal\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4203724\" index=\"13\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-appx/449/551/#p554\">\n    449 F. App'x 551\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 554 (8th Cir. 2012). Obviously, then, Agent Johnson's affidavit provided probable cause that Manning had streamed the video.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    United States v. Garcia\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"844512\" index=\"14\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/179/265/#p269\">\n    179 F.3d 265\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 269 (5th Cir. 1999) (\"[T]he requisite 'fair probability' is something more than a bare suspicion, but need not reach the fifty percent mark.\").\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   Manning next argues that the evidence in Agent Johnson's affidavit did not support a finding of probable cause because it was stale, given that at least five months (and perhaps much longer) had elapsed between the Omegle chat and the application for the warrant. \"A warrant\n   becomes stale if the information supporting the warrant is not 'sufficiently close in time to the issuance of the warrant and the subsequent search conducted so that probable cause can be said to exist as of the time of the search.' \"\n   <em>\n    United States v. Brewer\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3495308\" index=\"15\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/588/1165/#p1173\">\n    588 F.3d 1165\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 1173 (8th Cir. 2009) (citation omitted). Staleness depends on \"the lapse of time since the warrant was issued, the nature of the criminal activity, and the kind of property subject to the search.\"\n   <em>\n    United States v. Estey\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4215336\" index=\"16\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/595/836/#p840\">\n    595 F.3d 836\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 840 (8th Cir. 2010) (citation omitted).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   Agent Johnson's affidavit noted that the CyberTip was dated July 19, 2016 and had been transmitted from NCMEC to the BCA in August 2016. But neither Agent Johnson nor the CyberTip itself clarified whether July 19, 2016 was the date of the video chat, the date when the Omegle team reviewed the snapshots of the video chat, the date when Omegle transmitted the CyberTip to NCMEC, or some other date. And thus, as Manning argues, Judge Oleisky could not have known precisely how much time had elapsed between the video chat and the search-warrant application.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   The Court does not believe that, under Eighth Circuit precedents, the absence of this information meant that Agent Johnson's affidavit failed to establish probable cause. Child pornography cases are unique. Knowing that a person possessed illegal drugs several months ago may not (in and of itself) provide probable cause to believe that the same person possesses illegal drugs today, as those who possess illegal drugs typically use or sell them promptly.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    United States v. Kennedy\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1240985\" index=\"17\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/427/1136/#p1142\">\n    427 F.3d 1136\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 1142 (8th Cir. 2005) (\"[I]nformation of an unknown and undetermined vintage relaying the location of mobile, easily concealed, readily consumable, and highly incriminating narcotics could quickly go stale in the absence of information indicating an ongoing and continuing narcotics operation.\"). But knowing that a person possessed child pornography several months ago generally does (in and of itself) provide probable cause to believe that the same person possesses child pornography today, given the \"compulsive nature of the crime ... and the well-established hoarding habits of child pornography collectors[.]\"\n   <em>\n    United States v.

Indeed, the Eighth Circuit has upheld warrants executed\n   <em>\n    years\n   </em>\n   after the discovery of evidence of child pornography.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.,\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Notman\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6056021\" index=\"22\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/831/1084/#p1088\">\n    831 F.3d at 1088\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (several years);\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    United States v.

Given that both Omegle and NCMEC were attempting to assist law enforcement in apprehending someone who had streamed child pornography during a video chat, common sense would suggest that the period of time between the video chat and the search-warrant application did not exceed the capacious time frames approved by the Eighth Circuit in child-pornography cases. Moreover, the Eighth Circuit has upheld search warrants for child pornography based on supporting affidavits containing\n   <em>\n    no dates whatsoever\n   </em>\n   when it was reasonable to conclude that evidence would be discovered\n   because of the suspect's demonstrated interest in child pornography.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.,\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    United States v.

The Court disagrees. Agent Johnson's affidavit provided evidence that Manning had either (1) livestreamed the sexual abuse of a young child by an adult woman or (2) streamed a pre-recorded video depicting such abuse. Surely a judge can reasonably infer that a man who would stream a depiction of the sexual molestation of a child to a stranger that he recently met through Omegle would have at least as much interest in collecting child pornography as someone who had downloaded child pornography from the Internet or sought child pornography in a chat room.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    United States v.

He further asserts that, when there is only a single image or incident of child pornography, there must be some independent corroborating evidence of the person's interest in child pornography or of his propensity to possess or retain such images, in order to support an inference that there is a fair probability that a search of his home would result in the discovery of child pornography.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 10-11. He states that traditionally that such corroboration might include a subscription to a child pornography website, use of a peer-to-peer file sharing system to download and share child pornography files, or maintaining an Internet account and username that is connected to child pornography.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 15, 18.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-71\">\n   First, the Court does not find the Omegle CyberTip\n   <em>\n    per se\n   </em>\n   stale based on the affidavit's lack of detail regarding the July 19, 2016 date. CyberTip # 13208593 reported the user and IP address to NCMEC and included the date July 19, 2016. Application at 1-4, Docket No. 33-1. The affidavit does not specify whether that is the date of the user's chat session during which Omegle captured the image from the video stream, the date on which the Omegle Moderation Team flagged the snapshot, or the date on which it forwarded the CyberTip to NCMEC - or whether all three of these things occurred on that same date. While it would have been clearer to have a specific explanation for the July 19, 2016 date,\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   the Court does not find that the absence of additional detail makes the information\n   <em>\n    per se\n   </em>\n   stale, as Manning urges. He cites no Eighth Circuit precedent to support his argument for a\n   <em>\n    per se\n   </em>\n   rule, citing only a First Circuit case that the Court finds inapposite and unpersuasive in the present circumstances.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Rosencranz v.

The Court recognizes that the cases Manning cites have described traditional indicia of sexual interest in children and a predisposition to collect child pornography, but that is at least in part because those cases have largely involved more traditional technologies and modes of possessing, sharing and/or distributing child pornography.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    United States v.

Manning argues, in essence, that at most the affidavit links Manning to an image of child pornography that existed in cyberspace and - absent other corroborating evidence of an interest in child pornography that could support an inference of a propensity to collect and retain such images - there was insufficient basis to believe a search of his home would uncover child pornography.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-74\">\n   The Court concludes, however, that one cannot take words or phrases in isolation from those other cases without accounting for the setting and the evolution of technology in a forum such as Omegle that is specifically designed to be free of traditional indicia such as registrations, passwords, accounts, subscriptions to child-porn-only services, or similar records, and is designed to make random pairings of individuals in chat sessions. This Court is persuaded that the signing magistrate could reasonably infer from the totality of the circumstances - including the unique characteristics of the technology (a \"chat roulette\") and the nature of the medium (a video stream), as well as the image captured - that Manning was affirmatively interested in child pornography.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   Even\n   though Omegle is not intended or used exclusively for purposes related to child pornography, this fact alone does not defeat the inference. From this inference, the signing judge could reasonably conclude that the person linked to the snapshot depicting child pornography captured by Omegle's Moderation Team from the video stream of his chat session, may have saved that image on his home-based computers or devices, or collected and stored other depictions of child pornography in his home or on mobile devices on his person or in his vehicles. Manning has cited no Eighth Circuit precedent involving this technology and circumstances that would deem the reference to the hoarding habits of persons interested in child pornography was so unwarranted as to mandate suppression of the evidence.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-75\">\n   The circumstances here are also distinguishable from cases cited by Manning in which the affidavits established no link at all to support a warrant to search for child pornography in the person's home. In\n   <em>\n    Zimmerman\n   </em>\n   , one alleged child victim of molestation stated that the perpetrator showed him one video clip of adult pornography, but there was no mention of any child pornography.\n   <em>\n    United States v.

The context of her statement that she did not want Manning to think he was \"going somewhere right now\" refers to her immediately preceding statement that he was not being placed under arrest and taken from the house. She did not say or suggest that he would have to miss work so that they could question him; rather, after she asked him where he worked, what kinds of activities he engaged in, where he traveled, and about various computers in the house, Manning himself raised the issue of how to let his workplace know that he would not be a \"no-show\" at his work assignment that day.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-103\">\n   SA Johnson's position on the arm rest rather than seated right next to Manning on the couch is not so overbearing as to be oppressive or intimidating, especially in light of the calm, conversational tone of the interview. Moreover, the positioning of SA Johnson and of Det. Potter in the chair did not as a practical matter restrict him from moving from the couch or exiting the room, and a reasonable person would not have concluded that they were blocking his exit. Det. Potter's position three feet in front of the door, somewhat off to the side, is not the position of a sentry guarding the door to prevent his exit.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-104\">\n   The fact that Manning's vehicle was not available to him is attributable to the scope of the warrant, which included several vehicles registered to him. It is also true that there was a large law enforcement presence at his home. Armed officers intercepted him in his vehicle as he was leaving for work and took him back to his house, and several officers and/or BCA agents searched the house and vehicles. This is a consequence of the scope of the warrant and the property and things to be searched and/or seized. However, the atmosphere overall, including in the room in which the interview took place, was not so police-dominated as to create a custodial setting and overcome SA Johnson's statements to him that he was not under arrest, was free to leave, and did not have to talk to her. Therefore, the interrogation was non-custodial; the statements Manning made were voluntary and need not be suppressed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-105\">\n   <strong>\n    RECOMMENDATION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-106\">\n   IT IS HEREBY RECOMMENDED that:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-107\">\n   1.

ECF No. 55 at ---- - ----. Judge Schultz reached this conclusion notwithstanding his expressed uncertainty about whether Manning merely viewed the child pornography. To be clear: This Court does not believe that probable cause would have existed if Agent Johnson's affidavit merely provided evidence that Manning may have\n    <em>\n     viewed\n    </em>\n    a single child-pornography video during a single Omegle video chat. But, as the Court has explained, Agent Johnson's affidavit provided evidence that Manning had\n    <em>\n     streamed\n    </em>\n    child pornography from his home-which, in turn, provided probable cause that child pornography would be found in his home.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"3\">\n   <p id=\"p-114\">\n    Manning argues that, even if there was evidence that he streamed an image of child pornography, the fact that he streamed a single image cannot support an inference that he was \"a collector who would have child pornography at his residence.\" ECF No. 48 at 17. The Court disagrees. As the Eighth Circuit has held, probable cause to search a suspect's residence can be established even when law enforcement intercepts only one image of child pornography.\n    <em>\n     See, e.g.,\n    </em>\n    <em>\n     United States v.

ECF No. 55 at ---- - ----. Manning argues that the good-faith exception does not apply because the affidavit in support of the warrant was so bare-bones and speculative that no official could reasonably believe probable cause existed. ECF No. 48 at 20-24. For the reasons explained above, the Court disagrees with Manning and agrees with Judge Schultz that the good-faith exception would apply. After all, three judges-a federal district judge, a federal magistrate judge, and a state trial judge-have now reviewed the affidavit and found that it provided probable cause to search Manning's home.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"5\">\n   <p id=\"p-116\">\n    Manning argues that the third mitigating factor is actually absent because he did not initiate contact with the BCA.

If the association indicates that Manning was transmitting the video (as opposed to merely viewing it) the issue of probable cause is far easier. (Mere viewing, after all, could be inadvertent). If the affidavit specified the duration of the chat session, that fact might also bear on the question of inadvertence. Moreover, the affidavit does not explain how often snapshots are captured form users' chat sessions and how long Omegle stores them. Both details would help explain whether the absence of other child pornography snapshots associated with Manning's IP address is significant.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"3\">\n   <p id=\"p-120\">\n    Gov't Ex. 1A is a transcript made from a CD (Govt' Ex. 1) of the audio recording of the interview.
