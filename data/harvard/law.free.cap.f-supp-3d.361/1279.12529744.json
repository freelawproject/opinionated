(\"CVS\")'s Motion and Incorporated Memorandum of Law in Support of Defendant's Motion to Dismiss Plaintiff's Claims, ECF No. [43] (\"Motion\"), filed on March 13, 2018. The Court heard oral argument on the Motion on July 19, 2018. ECF No. [111];\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   Oral Argument Transcript, ECF No. [112]. The Court has reviewed Motion, the record, and is otherwise fully advised.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   <strong>\n    I. FACTUAL BACKGROUND\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   Plaintiff Sentry Data Systems, Inc. (\"Sentry\" or \"Plaintiff\") is a developer and provider of information technology systems that assist certain hospitals and hospital-like entities-which the parties refer to as \"covered entities\"-in monitoring compliance with a federal drug pricing program, the 340B Program. ECF No. [1] \u00b6 1;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   Public Health Services Act, 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 256b. The 340B Program allows hospitals that serve a disproportionate share of low-income patients to buy certain outpatient drugs at a discount, but seek reimbursement through the patient or a third-party payer at a non-discounted price, thereby providing an additional revenue\n   stream for the hospital.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 14. The program helps a participating hospital defray other operating losses, including costs incurred by providing care to under-or uninsured patients.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 15. Drug manufacturers participating in Medicaid are required to participate in the 340B Program.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 14.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   In order for a hospital to participate in the program, it must register with the Health Resources and Services Administration (\"HRSA\") and comply with multiple reporting and auditing requirements to insure that the covered entity is operating within the restrictions of the 340B Program.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 16-17, 19-23. This is where Plaintiff Sentry comes in.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 24. Sentry has developed tracking software to assist covered entities in managing their prescription inventory, tracking reimbursements and rebates, and maintaining records of eligible drugs and patients.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 36-40. Sentry's products further help covered entities comply with self-auditing requirements of the 340B Program, as well as respond to reporting inquiries from HRS.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   For both cost and convenience, most hospitals do not dispense the 340B Program drugs themselves.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 25, 26-27, Rather, they contract with certain pharmacies to dispense prescribed 340B Program outpatient medication.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   A covered entity may contract with several \"contract pharmacies\" to dispense its 340B Program-eligible drugs.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Thus Sentry, and 340B administrators like it, provide tracking software to their covered entity customers and serve as a conduit of information between the covered entity and the contract pharmacy.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 25. Defendant CVS is one of these contract pharmacies.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   According to the Complaint, since 2007, Sentry has not only provided its tracking software to its covered entity customers, but also worked directly with CVS to develop contracts between CVS and covered entities, improve CVS's operational procedures, and develop proprietary software programs for CVS.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 41-45. During this process, CVS was given a \"front-row seat to Sentry's core business model and internal business methods ...,\" subject to several confidentiality, non-disclosure, and non-compete agreements.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 46-53. In this capacity for CVS, Sentry also worked with Wellpartner, Inc. (\"Wellpartner\"), a competitor 340B administrator, to provide CVS with operational and software support for administering CVS's side of the 340B Program where Wellpartner served as the 340B administrator.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 54. As part of this arrangement, Wellpartner and Sentry also entered into several non-disclosure and confidentiality agreements.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 56-57.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   On December 18, 2017, CVS announced that it had acquired Wellpartner and that all covered entities seeking to maintain CVS as a contract pharmacy must use Wellpartner for their 340B tracking and program administration by December 31, 2018.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 58. Specifically, the announcement stated:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-16\">\n   CVS Health has completed an acquisition of Wellpartner, Inc., a leading provider of 340B program management solutions. Wellpartner has a reputation for industry leading technology solutions, excellent Health Resources &amp; Service Administration (HRSA) compliance record, and consistently high levels of customer satisfaction, making it an excellent fit for CVS Health.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-17\">\n   Over the last two years, CVS Health has significantly expanded its 340B contract pharmacy program to include hundreds of covered entities (CEs) and thousands of pharmacies across the country. This increased scale and complexity has driven a need to focus on a single administrator to help insure optimal results for our CEs.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-18\">\n   ...\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-19\">\n   In addition, by having Wellpartner as the exclusive 340B program administrator for all CVS Health retail and specialty pharmacies, we will also eliminate the restriction of limiting one CVS Pharmacy location to one administrator per CE, enabling us to offer clients expanded access to all CVS Pharmacy locations.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-20\">\n   <strong>\n    To ensure all clients benefit from these enhancements, we will transition all covered entities to Wellpartner by December 31, 2018.\n   </strong>\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-21\">\n   <strong>\n    ...\n   </strong>\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-22\">\n   <strong>\n    Account teams will contact you to discuss next steps and answer any questions about the integration and transition, and continue providing future updates.\n   </strong>\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   ECF No. [1-11] at 2 (emphasis in original);\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   ECF No. [1] \u00b6 58. In furtherance of this announcement, representatives from Wellpartner reached out individually to covered entities, including entities listed on Sentry's confidential customer lists that had been shared with CVS subject to the confidentiality and non-disclosure agreements. ECF No. [1] \u00b6 64.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   According to the Complaint, CVS's announcement effectively displaced Sentry as the 340B program administrator for at least some of its clients which relied heavily on CVS.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 61. At least fifty-six Sentry customers were contacted by CVS or Wellpartner and expressed to Sentry that they felt forced or coerced to switch to Wellpartner and terminate their relationship with Sentry or not renew their Sentry contracts.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   One customer stated that it felt \"handcuffed\" by the announcement, while another stated that it had \"little choice\" but to switch to Wellpartner.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 63.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   Plaintiff alleges that through this process, CVS misappropriated Sentry's trade secrets, including its customer lists and proprietary software to target Sentry customers to switch to Wellpartner and pitch a seamless transition from Sentry's system to Wellpartner.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 64-65. Specifically, Plaintiff alleges that when CVS reached out to Sentry customers, it misappropriated the customer lists and breached the non-disclosure and confidentiality agreements.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Plaintiff further alleges that CVS misappropriated Sentry's proprietary software and trade secrets in developing a platform that would allow an efficient switch for Sentry's customers between Sentry's product and Wellpartner's platform in violation of the confidentiality and non-disclosure agreements.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   <strong>\n    II.

ECF No. [43]. Sentry filed an opposition to the Motion on March 27, 2018, ECF No. [56], and CVS filed a reply on April 3, 2018, CF No. [62]. After several reschedulings, the Court held oral argument on the Motion on July 19, 2018. ECF No. [111]. The Court now addresses the Motion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   <strong>\n    III.

See\n   </em>\n   ECF No. [112] at 7-8. The Court agrees that the allegations of the Complaint are sufficient to demonstrate antitrust standing at this stage to survive a motion to dismiss. Sentry alleges that CVS's influence as a contract pharmacy allows it to leverage that power to force covered entities to purchase 340B administration services from CVS. Sentry further alleges that CVS's requirement that covered entities must use Wellpartner as their 340B administrator in order to use CVS as a contract pharmacy will cause injury in the market by forcing hospitals to choose Wellpartner over other 340B administrators and pay higher fees for the services currently provided by Sentry and its competitor 340B administrators.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   ECF No. [1] \u00b6\u00b6 32, 40, 59, 63, 72, 74, 77-78. These allegations are sufficient to allege antitrust injury.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   Moreover, in applying the non-exhaustive factors to the allegations in the Complaint, Sentry has sufficiently alleged that it is an efficient enforcer of the antitrust laws. Sentry is a direct competitor of Wellpartner. As a result of the tying arrangement, Sentry's customers have been coerced to decline to renew their contracts with Sentry or to breach the Sentry contracts to switch to Wellpartner. Sentry alleges that it has suffered injury in both losses of current clients under contract and current clients who may have, but for the CVS's requirement, continued to use Sentry. Thus, Sentry both has a strong incentive to sue, damages which are not highly speculative, and, as a player in the 340B administrator market, the ability to efficiently and effectively enforce any judgment it may obtain. Accordingly, Sentry is an efficient enforcer and has antitrust standing to pursue its claims.\n   <em>\n    Palmyra\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4228132,6053566\" index=\"35\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/604/1291/\">\n    604 F.3d at 1303-06\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   <strong>\n    2.

Sentry alleges facts which appear to seek to define a relevant geographic market as the entire\n   United States, including allegations related to the national roles of covered entities, contract pharmacies, and 340B administrators in the federal 340B Program. Moreover, the Complaint alleges that CVS has approximately 23.88% of the U.S. retail pharmacy market and cites numerous statistics citing CVS's national footprint.\n   <em>\n    See e.g.\n   </em>\n   , \u00b6\u00b6 27-29, 32.

Sentry attempts to clarify in its opposition that \"the relevant markets in this case are local, not national,\"\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   , but only points the Court to its allegations in the Complaint that evince that \"CVS has a high share of specific local markets around the country\" and that for a select 180 covered entities, CVS provides a high percentage of their contract pharmacy business.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 1;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   Exhibit A, ECF No. [1-1].

ECF No. [1] \u00b6\u00b6 86-89. Sentry alleges that it performed each of its obligations under these agreements, Defendant breached these agreements, and Plaintiff has been damaged.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   Defendant does not move to dismiss Plaintiff's breach of contract claims premised on a breach of the CVS Mutual Non-Disclosure Agreement, the 340B Backbone Agreement, or the Wellpartner Mutual Non-Disclosure Agreement.\n   <em>\n    Cf.\n   </em>\n   ECF No. [1] \u00b6\u00b6 87-89, 92-94\n   <em>\n    with\n   </em>\n   ECF No. [43] at 16-17. Accordingly, the Court need only address Defendant's Motion as to the 340B Platform Agreement.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   Plaintiff alleges that Defendant breached the contract when it began using Wellpartner, and not Sentry, as its 340B administrator in violation of the exclusivity provisions that CVS agreed to in the 340B Platform Agreement.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 86. Under paragraph 1 of the 340B Platform Agreement, \"Exclusive Appointment,\" the parties agreed that:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-50\">\n   Pharmacy [CVS] hereby appoints Sentry as the sole and exclusive 340B Platform Software Services Provider for Pharmacy, and Sentry hereby accepts such appointment for the Term (as defined below) of this Agreement. Accordingly, during the Term of this Agreement, Pharmacy shall neither enter into any contract, or similar arrangement for the Services with any third party other than Sentry, nor appoint any other third party as the 340B Platform Software Services Provider for the Pharmacy.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-51\">\n   ECF No. [27-2] at 2. The 340B Platform Agreement defines the \"Term\" as two years beginning on July 9, 2014, with automatic renewals every year unless either party provides notice of termination ninety days prior to renewal.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 3. The 340B Platform Agreement also prohibits disclosure of confidential information, defined as \"any information that is disclosed by one party to the other party under this Agreement....\" to any third-party with certain exceptions not pertinent to the allegations in the Complaint.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 3-4. Plaintiff thus alleges that Defendant breached the 340B Platform Agreement by using third-party Wellpartner as its 340B administrator and by sharing confidential information exchanged under the 340B Platform Agreement with third-party Wellpartner. ECF No. [1] \u00b6 92.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-52\">\n   In its Motion, Defendant argues that Wellpartner is not a \"third-party\" and Plaintiffs breach of contract claim fails as a matter of law. ECF No. [43] at 16. Defendant further argues that, even if Wellpartner was considered a third-party, Wellpartner is not offering the same services as those contemplated in the 340B Platform Agreement.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   16-17. However, based on a plain reading of the 340B Platform Agreement and the allegations in the Complaint, the Court does not find that Wellpartner-a separate legal entity and competitor of Sentry-could not be considered\n   a \"third-party\" under the 340B Platform Agreement. Moreover, Sentry has further alleged that Wellpartner is offering the platform services contemplated under the 340B Platform Agreement. ECF No. [1] \u00b6 92.

ECF No. [1] \u00b6 111, 120. Sentry further alleges that it derives significant economic value from these trade secrets and took reasonable steps to protect them, including requiring CVS to sign confidentiality and non-disclosure agreements.

Jan. 23, 2017) (collecting cases). Sentry alleges that\n   it compiled its customer lists through \"considerable effort, knowledge, time, and expense to identify covered entities interested in participating in the 340B program, and in understanding and identifying their capabilities and needs.\" ECF No. [1] \u00b6 47. Defendant argues in its Motion that the customer list is openly available, pointing the Court to the HRSA website which allows a user to search a database of all participants in the 340B program. ECF No. [43] at 18. However, this does little to defeat Sentry's claim that Defendant misappropriated its curated customer list since the information reflected in Sentry's customer list, including which covered entities use Sentry as its 340B administrator, is not readily available through the HRSA website. ECF No. [112] at 27.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-67\">\n   Second, Defendant argues that Plaintiff has failed to plead with the requisite specificity the additional trade secrets-other than the customer list-that it alleges were misappropriated. While a \"plaintiff is required to identify with reasonable particularity the trade secrets at issue before proceeding with discovery ... to satisfy this requirement at the dismissal stage in federal court, the plaintiff need only allege sufficient facts to plausibly show a trade secret was involved and to give the defendant notice of the material it claims constituted a trade secret.\"\n   <em>\n    DynCorp Int'l v.

App'x 844\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 848 (11th Cir. 2016) (per curiam). Sentry specifically alleges that it shared trade secrets including its Pharmacy Services Agreement template, proprietary software programs for administering the 340B program, \"proprietary configurations and data specifications of Sentry's software in order to submit properly formatted data to Sentry for processing on behalf of CVS,\" \"proprietary configurations and data specifications of Sentry's 340B software, as embodied in the Operational Documentation,\" and certain customizations of the Backbone technology.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 43-45, 55, 67, 68. These allegations provide sufficient specificity regarding the trade secrets that form the basis of Sentry's misappropriation claims.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-68\">\n   Finally, Defendant argues that Plaintiff failed to adequately allege misappropriation because there are \"no credible allegations even suggesting why or how CVS would have used such information....\" ECF No. [43] at 20. However, in evaluating the sufficiency of the pleadings, the \"credibility\" of the allegations is irrelevant. Taking the allegations as true, Sentry has alleged that Defendants misappropriated these trade secrets by using the confidential customer lists to call Sentry customers to persuade them to switch to Wellpartner and by using the trade secret information to develop the Wellpartner platform so that it was compatible with Sentry's platform to promote a seamless transition of Sentry's customers to Wellpartner. At this stage, these allegations are sufficient.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-69\">\n   <strong>\n    2. Preemption\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-70\">\n   Section 688.008 of FUTSA \"displace[s] conflicting tort, restitutory, and other law of this state providing civil remedies for misappropriation of a trade secret.\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"79\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Fla.%20Stat.%20%C2%A7%20688.008\">\n    Fla.

To determine whether allegations of trade-secret misappropriation preempt a plaintiff from sufficiently pleading a separate, but related tort, the Court must evaluate \"whether allegations of trade secret misappropriation alone comprise the underlying wrong; if so, the cause of action is barred by \u00a7 688.008.\"\n   <em>\n    Allegiance Healthcare Corp. v.

While both Counts IV and V rely on misappropriation of trade secrets and confidential information as the \"improper means,\" ECF No. [1] \u00b6\u00b6 90-102, 104-09, the factual underpinnings of these claims are sufficiently distinct from Plaintiff's misappropriation of trade secrets claims such that they are not preempted.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Gonzalez-Hernandez\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"84\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2009%20WL%2010668626\">\n    2009 WL 10668626\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *2.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-74\">\n   <strong>\n    D.
