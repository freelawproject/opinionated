The court heard oral argument on September 19, 2018. (ECF No. 114.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   For the reasons stated herein, the court GRANTS, in part, Ms. Young's Motion against Medicredit for violations of the FDCPA; GRANTS, in part, Ms. Young's Motion against NPAS for violations of the FDCPA; DENIES Defendants' Motion on actual Damages; and DENIES Ms. Young's Motion to Amend Complaint.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   <strong>\n    Facts\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   Plaintiff Robyn Young (Ms. Young) was employed with Granite School District as a teacher for special needs children, including children with severe autism. (ECF No. 100 at 4.) In the Spring of 2013, Ms. Young was attacked at work by one of her students and suffered a concussion. (ECF No. 100 at 4.) In the Spring of 2014, Plaintiff was again attacked at work by a different student. (ECF No. 100 at 4.) As a result of these attacks, Ms. Young suffered from migraine headaches, partial paralysis, sensitivity to light, and blurry vision. (ECF No. 100 at 4.) Ms. Young filed a worker's compensation claim with the State of Utah against Granite School District to recover for her injuries. (ECF No. 100 at 4.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   As part of her treatment for the injuries suffered in 2013 and 2014, Ms. Young sought medical care, on six different dates,\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   from St. Mark's Hospital. St. Mark's Hospital is owned by Hospital Corporation of America (HCA). (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   ECF No. 99-1 at 10.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   ) HCA also owns an entity named \"Parallon.\" (ECF No. 99-1 at 5.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   ) Parallon, in turn, owns Defendants NPAS, Inc. and Medicredit, Inc. (ECF No. 99-1 at 5.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   ). NPAS, Inc., Medicredit, Inc., and HSS Systems LLC are all Parallon Affiliates. (ECF No. 93-2 at 4.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   According to NPAS, Inc., NPAS conducts \"early out\" collections \"for St. Mark's Hospital.\" (ECF No. 93-1 at 3.) NPAS claims that \"early out\" collections involve \"attempts to collect unpaid accounts prior to the time that the account is deemed to be [in] default.\" (Wright Decl., \u00b6 3, ECF No. 93-1 at 3.) According to NPAS, Inc., its collection services for St. Mark's Hospital are governed, \"in part,\" by two agreements: (1) an Intercompany Services Agreement (Intercompany Agreement) and (2) an Amended and Restated Master Services Agreement (Master Agreement). (Wright Decl., \u00b6 3, ECF No. 93-1 at 3.) The Intercompany Agreement is \"between NPAS on the one hand, and HSS Systems, LLC\" on the other. (Wright Decl., \u00b6 3, ECF No. 93-1 at 3.) The Master Agreement is between Parallon and \"non-party Mountain Division, Inc.\" (Wright Decl., \u00b6 3, ECF No. 93-1 at 3.) Ms. Young was not a party to either agreement.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   The Intercompany Agreement provides that \"HSS desire[d] to contract with\n   NPAS ... to provide ... early-out collection services for its\n   <strong>\n    Client-Hospitals\n   </strong>\n   .\" (ECF No. 93-3 at 2 (emphasis in original).) The Intercompany Agreement further provides that \"NPAS ... shall use commercially reasonable efforts to obtain the amounts owed ....\" (ECF No. 93-3 at 3-4.) The Intercompany Agreement also provides that \"NPAS ... shall maintain its own employees to provide Early-Out Collection Services for HSS.\" (ECF No. 93-3 at 4.) And the Agreement provides that \"NPAS ... possesses experience and expertise in providing early-out collection services for hospital facilities.\" (ECF No. 93-3 at 2.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   According to NPAS, \"[u]nder the [Master Agreement,] St. Mark's Hospital is a facility which receives services from NPAS and HSS.\" (Wright Decl., \u00b6 5, ECF No. 93-1 at 3.) \"As part of the services that HSS provides for St. Mark's Hospital, it contracts certain services with NPAS via the [Intercompany Agreement].\" (Wright Decl., \u00b6 7, ECF No. 93-1 at 4.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   On four of six dates on which Ms. Young received treatment from St. Mark's Hospital, she \"signed a 'Conditions of Admission and Consent for Outpatient Care,' [Consent for Care Agreement] in connection with medical services received ....\" (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   ECF No. 98 at 13-14.) On one date, June 3, 2014, Ms. Young's husband signed one of the Consent for Care Agreements. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   ECF No. 98 at 13.) It is unclear from the record whether Ms. Young signed a Consent for Care Agreement on February 23, 2015. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   ECF No. 98 at 13-14.) Each of these Consent for Care Agreements contained the following provision:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-20\">\n   I acknowledge that the Providers may utilize the services of a third party Business Associate or affiliated entity as an extended business office (\"EBO Servicer\") for medical account billing and servicing. During the time that the medical account is being serviced by the EBO Servicer, the account shall not be considered delinquent, past due or in default, and shall not be reported to a credit bureau or subject to collection legal proceedings. When the EBO Servicer's efforts to obtain payment have been exhausted due to a number of factors (for e.g., Patient of Guarantor's failure to pay or make a payment arrangement after insurance adjustments and payments have been credited, and/or the insurer's denial of claim(s) or benefits is received), the EBO Servicer will send a final notice letter which will include the date that the medical account may be returned from the EBO Servicer to the Provider. Upon return to the Provider by the EBO Servicer, the Provider may place the account back with the EBO Servicer, or, at the option of the Provider, may determine the account to be delinquent, past due and in default. Once the medical account is determined to be delinquent it may be subject to late fees, interest as stated, referral to a collection agency for collection as a delinquent account, credit bureau reporting and enforcement by legal proceedings.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   ECF No. 92-6 at 3-4.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   As a result of the treatment she received from St. Mark's Hospital, six different accounts were placed with NPAS, and four were placed with Medicredit.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   <em>\n    NPAS Accounts\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   Six different accounts were placed with NPAS as shown in the following chart.\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <pre id=\"p-25\">Placement Date Date of Service Amount Account Number 7/22/14 6/3/14 $431.76 4860 2/27/15 5/23/14 $2,539.88 4683 6/11/15 2/23/15 $181.05 1437 12/28/15 11/2/15 $952.84 4604 2/29/16 2/2/16 $847.36 6966 8/2/16 5/29/16 $713.89 1159</pre>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   NPAS maintained records of these accounts in its Collection Notes. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   ECF No. 32-17 at 1-73.) The court first discusses Account 4683 and then the remaining accounts placed with Medicredit.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   <em>\n    Account 4683\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   On or around October 26, 2015, NPAS sent Ms. Young a letter stating, in part, that \"[d]espite [its] efforts,\" it had \"been unable to secure payment on\" Account 4683. It also stated: \"You are obligated to pay for the services provided.\" (ECF No. 82-2 at 2.) On or around May 17, 2016, NPAS sent Ms. Young another letter regarding Account 4683 in which it requested that Ms. Young send NPAS her attorney's information. (ECF No. 32-3 at 2.) Ms. Young's attorney, Lester Perry replied on July 5, 2016 with reference to this account, and accounts 6966 and 4604, requesting certain information from NPAS and informing NPAS that there could be other accounts that NPAS was attempting to collect on. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   ECF No. 32-4 at 2.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   <em>\n    Medicredit Accounts\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   Account 4683 was first placed with Medicredit on October 11, 2014. (Wright Decl., \u00b6 21, ECF No. 62-2 at 6;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   ECF No. 32-16 at 2 (Medicredit's Account Notes indicate that the \"placement date\" of this account was \"10/11/2014.\").) Four months later, on February 27, 2015, Account 4683 \"was placed with NPAS ....\" (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   ECF No. 98 at 16.) Three additional debts were placed with Medicredit on three different dates for the services that St. Mark's Hospital performed for Ms. Young. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   ECF No. 62 at 15.) All of these debts were assigned different \"reference ID\" numbers: 4683, 1437, 4604, and 6966. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   ECF No. 101-5 at 2.) Even though the four accounts were each assigned a different reference ID number, Medicredit had a single \"consumer ID\" that was specifically tied to Ms. Young and all four of her accounts. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   ECF No. 101-5 at 2.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   Medicredit maintained records of these four accounts in its \"Medicredit Account Notes\" and in its \"Noble System\" call history log. (Wright Decl., \u00b6 20, ECF No. 62-2 at 6.) The Medicredit Account Notes are comprised, at least in part, of \"notes from St. Mark's [hospital]\" and \"notes from NPAS.\" (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   ECF No. 101-2 at 17, Wright Depo. 59: 7-14.) The Medicredit Account Notes also include some entries from the Noble System Call Log.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   Medicredit's Account Notes do not clearly delineate between accounts-if it all. (\n   <em>\n    Compare\n   </em>\n   ECF No. 32-16\n   <em>\n    with\n   </em>\n   ECF No. 32-17\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n   .) In other words, the Medicredit Account Notes appear to be one large, amorphous, omnibus account. In his deposition, Medicredit's 30(b)(6) witness, Mr. Wright, described the Medicredit Account Notes as \"a Consumer Fact Sheet out of\n   the system we have at Medicredit.\" (ECF No. 101-2, Wright Depo. 30: 1-2.) He then stated that \"[i]t's called DM9, it's a collection system.\" (ECF No. 101-2 at 10, Wright Depo. 30:4.) The following line of questioning then ensued between Ms. Young's counsel and Mr. Wright:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-33\">\n   <strong>\n    Q.\n   </strong>\n   What type of information is in the Consumer Fact Sheet?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-34\">\n   <strong>\n    A.\n   </strong>\n   This is the record of the history of accounts that were placed, demographic information, and notes associated, related to those accounts.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-35\">\n   <strong>\n    Q.\n   </strong>\n   So if I wanted to go into the system there at Medicredit and look up, for instance, Mrs. Young's information, how would you do that at Medicredit?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-36\">\n   <strong>\n    A.\n   </strong>\n   There's lots of ways to do it, but the best way to do it would just be to pull the accounts up by the consumer ID number, the upper left-hand corner.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-37\">\n   <strong>\n    Q.\n   </strong>\n   So this ID number would have every account that Medicredit has worked on that -- Mrs. Young?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-38\">\n   <strong>\n    A.\n   </strong>\n   As long as the -- as long as all of the information from subsequent accounts matched in the merging rules, then all those accounts would merge together and belong to one single consumer number for Robyn Young.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   (ECF No. 101-2 at 10, Wright Depo. 30:10-22.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   Mr. Wright explained that when an account is placed with Medicredit, no one at Medicredit independently verifies that the consumer actually owes money before Medicredit contacts the consumer. (ECF No. 101-2 at 15, Wright Depo. 52: 6-14.\n   <footnotemark>\n    7\n   </footnotemark>\n   ) Mr. Wright also clarified that the information contained in the \"Consumer Fact Sheet\" would have been available to Medicredit representatives, but that it would not have been in the same format as has been presented to the court. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   ECF No. 101-2 at 12, Wright Depo. 38: 23-25; 39: 1-6,\n   <footnotemark>\n    8\n   </footnotemark>\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   ECF No. 101-2 at 13, Wright Depo. 44: 7-9.\n   <footnotemark>\n    9\n   </footnotemark>\n   )\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   <em>\n    Medicredit Treatment of Account 4683\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   As noted, Account 4683 was placed first with Medicredit.\n   <footnotemark>\n    10\n   </footnotemark>\n   (Wright Decl., \u00b6 21, ECF No. 62-2 at 6;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   ECF No. 32-16 at 2.) Medicredit assigned Ms. Young with the \"Consumer ID\" \"48159461\" at this time. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   ECF No. 32-16 at 73.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   After receiving Account 4683, Medicredit called Ms. Young six times in October 2014-on October 13, 15, 16, 17, 20 and 21. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   ECF No. 32-16 at 78;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   ECF No. 32-16 at 73.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   Account 4683 was then removed from Medicredit, and placed with NPAS on February 27, 2015. (Wright Decl., \u00b6 15, ECF No. 62-2 at 5.) Almost a year later, on February 5, 2016, Medicredit \"merged\" Ms. Young's previous Consumer ID, \"48159461\" with the most recent Consumer ID, \"29169038.\" (ECF No. 32-16 at 73.) Again, the Consumer ID allowed Medicredit employees to see all accounts associated with Ms. Young. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   ECF No. 101-2 at 10, Wright Depo. 30:10-22.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   On July 4, 2016, Account 4683 was placed with Medicredit for a second time. (ECF No. 32-16 at 2.) At the same time, NPAS' Collection Notes for Account 4683 were transferred to Medicredit's Account Notes. (\n   <em>\n    Compare\n   </em>\n   ECF No. 32-17 at 32-43\n   <em>\n    with\n   </em>\n   ECF No. 32-16 at 7-36.) Many of the entries in NPAS' Collection Notes for Account 4683 are nearly identical to Medicredit's Account Notes dated \"7/4/2016\". For example, a June 3, 2016 entry from NPAS' Collection Notes providing \"LETTER FROM K DAWN ATLAN ... STATING THAT THEY REPRSESENT PT\" can be found in Medicredit's Account Notes timestamped \"7/4/2016.\" (\n   <em>\n    Compare\n   </em>\n   ECF No. 32-17 at 42\n   <em>\n    with\n   </em>\n   ECF No. 101-5 at 27.) As another example, NPAS' collection notes from 11/23/15 provides \"NOTES: ATTN WORK COMP ... GN STTD THIS ACCT IS WORK COMP RELATED AND IS CURRENTLY UNDER LITIGATION.\" (ECF No. 32-17 at 34.) Medicredit's Account Notes for 7/4/2016 similarly provide \"ATTN WORK COMP ....\" and also provide \"[T]HIS ACCT IS WORK COMP REL ....\" (ECF No. 101-5 at 29.) The similarities between the NPAS Collection Notes and Medicredit's Account Notes demonstrate that NPAS' Collection Notes for Account 4683 were imported into Medicredit's Account Notes on 7/4/2016-the date that Account 4683 was placed with Medicredit for the second time.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   On the very next day, Lester Perry sent Medicredit a letter asking for information. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   ECF No. 32-14 at 2.) This letter also referenced Ms. Young's Consumer ID number, 29169038.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   On or around July 11, 2016, notwithstanding the letter from Lester Perry, Medicredit sent Ms. Young a further letter about Account 4683, informing her that Medicredit had \"the full intention of collecting on this account(s)\" and stating that \"this office will assume this debt is valid\" unless Ms. Young disputed the debt within 30 days of receiving the letter. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   ECF No. 32-10 at 2; Young Decl. \u00b6 17, ECF No. 101-4 at 4.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   One of Medicredit's Account Note entries confirms that Medicredit had received an attorney letter, at the latest, on July 20, 2016. For example, one of Medicredit's Account Notes, timestamped on 7/20/2016, provides \"RECV ATTY REP LETER.\" (ECF No. 32-16 at 5.) Another entry, timestamped on 7/21/2016 provides \"RCVD CORR FROM HOOLE &amp; KING LAW OFFICES STATING THAT THEY REPRESENTS TO CONS AND REQUESTING I/S FOR ACCT# 67838544, 69726746 &amp; 73736726 ....\" (ECF No. 32-16 at 5.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   In addition to the July 11 letter, Medicredit also called Ms. Young four more times after July 4, 2016-on July 5, 7, 15, and 21 of 2016. (ECF No. 32-16 at 80.) Importantly, Medicredit called Ms. Young on July 21, 2016-after Medicredit's time stamp from July 20, 2016 revealed that, at least by that date, Medicredit had received a letter from Ms. Young's attorney. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   ECF No. 32-16 at 5.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-50\">\n   <em>\n    Account 1437\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-51\">\n   \"On February 5, 2016,\" Account 1437 \"was first placed with Medicredit.\" (Wright Decl., \u00b6 22, ECF No. 62-2 at 6;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   ECF No. 32-16 at 2.) Just like Account 4683, NPAS' Collection Notes for\n   Account 1437 were imported into Medicredit's Account Notes on this placement date.

For example, a July 29, 2015 entry from NPAS' Collection Notes providing \"ATTN WORKERS COMP: RPLS REVIEW, AND DETERMINE ORDER OF INSR. THANK YOU\" can be found in Medicredit's Account Notes timestamped on 2/5/2016. (\n   <em>\n    Compare\n   </em>\n   ECF No. 32-17 at 24\n   <em>\n    with\n   </em>\n   ECF No. 32-16 at 65.) As another example, NPAS' collection notes from 10/13/15 for Account 1437 provides \"CHKD CORRES SAYS CLM IN LITIGATION ....\" (ECF No. 32-17 at 26.) The identical entry is found in Medicredit's Account Notes, timestamped on 2/5/2016. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   ECF No. 32-16 at 67.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-52\">\n   After Account 1437 was placed with Medicredit, Medicredit called Ms. Young five times before March 4, 2016 (the date that the next account, Account 4604, was placed with Medicredit). Medicredit called Ms. Young on February 11, 16, 19, 25 of 2016 and on March 3, 2016. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   ECF No. 32-16 at 78.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-53\">\n   On May 13, 2016, Ms. Young's then attorney, Dawn Atkin, sent St. Mark's Hospital a letter regarding Account 1437. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   ECF No. 32-13 at 2.) She informed St. Mark's Hospital that she represented Ms. Young, and that based on \"Utah Code. Ann. 34-2-401(b),\" Ms. Young \"dispute[d] the validity of this debt ....\" (ECF No. 32-13 at 2.) An entry from Medicredit's Account Notes, timestamped on 5/27/2016, provides in part, \"ATKIN &amp; ASSOC SENT LTR STTN WC HAS BEEN FILED.\" (ECF No. 101-5 at 37.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-54\">\n   <em>\n    Account 4604\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-55\">\n   \"On March 4, 2016,\" Account 4604 \"was first placed with Medicredit.\" (Wright Decl., \u00b6 22, ECF No. 62-2 at 6;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   ECF No. 32-16 at 2.) Just like Account 4683 and Account 1437, NPAS' Collection Notes for Account 4604 were imported into Medicredit's Account Notes on this placement date.

And it is undisputed that Medicredit contacted Ms. Young alleging she was obligated to pay debts for services she received from St. Mark's Hospital.

It is undisputed that the debts relate to services that St. Mark's provided to Ms. Young for treatment relating to injuries she sustained at work.

(\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   ECF No. 32 at 15, 19, 21, and 22.) The fourth element is disputed and the court addresses Medicredit's violations below.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-77\">\n   A.\n   <em>\n    Medicredit Violated 1692(f)(1)\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-78\">\n   Ms. Young argues that Medicredit \"violated the FDCPA by collecting or attempting to collect debts that were not permitted by law.\" (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   ECF No. 32 at 14.) Section 1692f(1) provides that \"[t]he collection of any amount\" of debt is \"a violation of this section\" \"unless such amount is expressly authorized by the agreement creating the debt or permitted by law.\" 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 1692f(1). Ms. Young argues that Medicredit's efforts to collect the debts at issue were not permitted under Utah law because \"Young never owed the debts\" Medicredit \"tried to collect.\" (ECF No. 82 at 10.) Rather, Ms. Young argues that her employer, Granite School District, owed the debts.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-79\">\n   Ms. Young argues that \"[u]nder Utah law,\" her \"employer [was] solely responsible for\" the payments relating to \"medical expenses incurred within the course and scope of [her] employment.\" (ECF No. 82 at 10.) Here, Ms. Young relies on Utah's Workers Compensation Act, Utah Code Ann. \u00a7 34A-2-401. That statute provides that an employee of a school district \"who is injured ... by accident arising out of and in the course of the employee's employment ... shall be paid ... for ... medical, nurse, and hospital services.\" Utah Code Ann. \u00a7 34A-2-401(1)(b)(i). The statute further provides that \"[t]he responsibility for compensation and payment of medical, nursing, and hospital services and medicines ... provided under this chapter shall be ... on the employer and the employer's insurance carrier,\" and \"\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     not on the employee\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n   .\" Utah Code Ann. \u00a7 34A-2-401(2)(a-b) (emphasis added).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-80\">\n   Defendants argue that Ms. Young \"provides no actual evidence that the unpaid medical debts ... are actually debts regarding which the law prohibits Defendants from taking certain actions.\" (ECF No. 62 at 34.) But there is no dispute that Ms. Young was employed with Granite School District when she was attacked by students and injured on the job. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   ECF 100 at 4.) Nor is there any dispute that \"[a]s a result of these attacks,\" Ms. Young \"filed a worker's compensation claim with the State of Utah against Granite School District.\" (ECF No. 100 at 4.) Further, at oral argument, Ms. Young's counsel stated that a Utah \"administrative decision\" confirmed that the debts at issue were not Ms. Young's debts. Defendants did not dispute these facts.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-81\">\n   Ms. Young's counsel's representation is supported by a March 10, 2017 Order issued by the Utah Labor Commission Appeals Board.

Because the statute is clear, the court concludes that the Utah Supreme Court would not allow a debt collector to attempt to collect medical debt from an employee when the responsibility to pay for that debt is on the employer.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-84\">\n   The court next addresses an argument that Defendants made at oral argument that it is \"a disputed fact\" about whether Medicredit had knowledge that the accounts at issue were subject to worker's compensation. Defendants' counsel stated that Medicredit's representatives \"didn't look at\" the \"client notes\" \"when they came over.\" An underlying assumption of Defendants' argument is that Plaintiff must show that Medicredit had knowledge that the accounts at issue were subject to worker's compensation in order to be liable under the FDCPA. In her reply, Ms. Young argues that \"it ... does not matter whether Defendants had notice [that she] was not responsible for the debts\" (ECF No. 82 at 2) because the \"FDCPA is a strict liability statute that\" does not require proof of an intentional violation. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   ECF No. 82 at 11.) The court proceeds in two steps. First, the court addresses whether Medicredit can be charged with knowledge that the accounts at issue were subject to worker's compensation. Second, the court addresses whether this knowledge is even required to show a violation of 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 1692f(1).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-85\">\n   1.\n   <em>\n    Medicredit Is Charged With Knowledge\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-86\">\n   As noted above, Medicredit's counsel argues that it is \"a disputed fact\" about whether Medicredit had knowledge that the accounts at issue were subject to worker's compensation because Medicredit's representatives \"didn't look at\" the \"client notes\" \"when they came over.\" Here, Defendants' counsel relied on Medicredit's 30(B)(6) representative, Don Wright. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   ECF No. 101-2 at 3, Wright Depo. 5: 2-4.)

(\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   ECF No. 101-2 at 17, Wright Depo. 60: 2-6.) Mr. Wright further explained that when an account is placed with Medicredit, no one at Medicredit independently verifies that the consumer actually owes money before Medicredit contacts the consumer. (ECF No. 101-2 at 15, Wright Depo. 52: 6-14.\n   <footnotemark>\n    12\n   </footnotemark>\n   ) Mr. Wright also explained that the information contained in the \"Consumer Fact Sheet\" would have been available to Medicredit representatives, but that it would not have been in the same format as has been presented to the court. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   ECF No. 101-2 at 12,\n   Wright Depo. 38: 23-25; 39: 1-6,\n   <footnotemark>\n    13\n   </footnotemark>\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   ECF No. 101-2 at 13, Wright Depo. 44: 7-9.\n   <footnotemark>\n    14\n   </footnotemark>\n   )\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-87\">\n   The court rejects Medicredit's arguments that it should not be charged with knowledge of its own records. Mr. Wright's deposition reveals that Medicredit's representatives had access to the Medicredit Account notes. Medicredit is a corporation. (ECF No. 27 at 2.) \"[C]orporations are charged with knowledge of information known to their officers ....\"\n   <em>\n    Helton v.

As explained, Medicredit had knowledge that each of the four accounts at issue was not Ms. Young's responsibility to pay.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-88\">\n   <em>\n    Medicredit Had the Required Knowledge for Account 4683\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-89\">\n   An entry from Medicredit's Account Notes from October 11, 2014 states \"PT CI V HIPAA STATES THIS IS\n   <strong>\n    WORK COMP\n   </strong>\n   .\" (ECF No. 32-16 at 77 (emphasis added).) This is the same date Account 4683 was placed with Medicredit. Because Medicredit's Account Notes indicated that this account was associated with worker's compensation, it is charged with knowledge that this account was not Ms. Young's responsibility to pay under Utah Code Ann. \u00a7 34A-2-401(2)(b). Medicredit nevertheless called Ms. Young six times in October 2014 regarding this account. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   ECF No. 32-16 at 78;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   ECF No. 32-16 at 73.)

(ECF No. 32-16 at 2.) An entry from Medicredit's Account Notes on that same date from July 4, 2016 provides \"ATTN\n   <strong>\n    WORK COMP\n   </strong>\n   \" and also provide \"[T]HIS ACCT IS\n   <strong>\n    WORK COMP\n   </strong>\n   REL ....\" (ECF No. 101-5 at 29 (emphases added).) This is further evidence that Medicredit is charged with knowledge that this account was not Ms. Young's responsibility to pay. Medicredit nevertheless sent Ms. Young a letter regarding Account 4683, informing her that Medicredit had \"the full intention of collecting on this account(s)\" and stating that \"this office will assume this debt is valid\" unless Ms. Young disputed the debt within 30 days of receiving the letter. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   ECF No. 32-10 at 2; Young Decl. \u00b6 17, ECF No. 101-4 at 4.) And Medicredit called Ms. Young on July 5, 7, 15, and 21 of 2016. (ECF No. 32-16 at 80.) Each of those phone calls, and the July 11, 2016 letter, were violations of 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 1692f(1).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-91\">\n   <em>\n    Medicredit Had the Required Knowledge for Account 1437\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-92\">\n   Account 1437 was first placed with Medicredit on February 5, 2016.

Medicredit nevertheless called Ms. Young five times before March 4, 2016 (the date that the next account, Account 4604, was placed with Medicredit). Medicredit called Ms. Young on February 11, 16, 19, 25 of 2016 and on March 3, 2016. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   ECF No. 32-16 at 78.)

Again, because Medicredit's Account Notes indicated that this account was associated with worker's compensation, it is charged with knowledge that this account was not Ms. Young's responsibility. Nevertheless, on or around March 8, 2016, Medicredit sent Ms. Young a letter regarding Account 4604, informing her that Medicredit had \"the full intention of collecting on this account(s)\" and stating that \"this office will assume this debt is valid\" unless Ms. Young disputed the debt within 30 days of receiving the letter. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   ECF No. 32-8 at 2; Young Decl. \u00b6 15, ECF No. 101-4 at 4.) Additionally, after account 4604 was placed with Medicredit, Medicredit called Ms. Young eight times before April 25, 2016 (the date that the next account, Account 6966, was placed with Medicredit). Medicredit called Ms. Young on March 8, 14, 21, 28, and April 6, 11, 19, and 22, 2016. (ECF No. 32-16 at 78-79.) Because Medicredit was not permitted under Utah law to contact Ms. Young, each of these phone calls and the March 8, 2016 letter were violations of 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 1692f(1).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-95\">\n   <em>\n    Medicredit Had the Required Knowledge for Account 6966\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-96\">\n   Account 6966 was placed with Medicredit on April 25, 2016.

STATES THIS IS IN LITIGATION THRU\n   <strong>\n    WCF\n   </strong>\n   ....\" (ECF No. 32-16 at 39 (emphasis added).) As to this account, Medicredit is also charged with knowledge that this account was not Ms. Young's responsibility. Medicredit called Ms. Young twenty-five times before July 4, 2016 (the date that Account 4683 was placed with Medicredit for the second time). (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   ECF No. 32-16 at 79-80.) Medicredit called Ms. Young on April 25, 26, 27, 28, May 2, 4, 5, 9, (twice on May 10,) 11, 17, 23, 25, June 2, 7, 9, 13, 14, 15, 21, 22, 27, 28, and 29. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   ECF No. 32-16 at 79-80.) And on May 1, 2016, Medicredit sent Ms. Young a letter on this account informing her that Medicredit had \"the full intention of collecting on this account(s)\" and stating that \"this office will assume this debt is valid\" unless Ms. Young disputed the debt within 30 days of receiving the letter. (ECF No. 32-9 at 2.) Because Medicredit was not permitted under Utah law to contact Ms. Young, each of these phone calls and the May 1, 2016 letter were violations of 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 1692f(1).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-97\">\n   To summarize, Medicredit is charged with knowledge of the information in the Medicredit Account Notes. The Medicredit Account Notes demonstrate that each of the medical debts owed to St. Mark's hospital\n   were subject to worker's compensation. Because they were subject to worker's compensation, they were not Ms. Young's responsibility to pay under Utah Code Ann. \u00a7 34A-2-401(2)(b). Because they were not Ms. Young's responsibility to pay, Medicredit was not permitted under Utah law to contact Ms. Young about any of the accounts. Each time Medicredit contacted Ms. Young, it violated 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 1692f(1).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-98\">\n   2.\n   <em>\n    Medicredit Has Strict Liability\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-99\">\n   In her reply, Ms. Young argues that \"it ... does not matter whether Defendants had notice [that she] was not responsible for the debts\" (ECF No. 82 at 2) because the \"FDCPA is a strict liability statute that\" does not require proof of an intentional violation. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   ECF No. 82 at 11.) \"While the Tenth Circuit has not ruled definitively that the FDCPA is a strict liability statute, it is true that 'courts generally treat the FDCPA as a strict liability statute ....

Ms. Young's cited authority,\n   <em>\n    Stuart\n   </em>\n   , provides that \"an attempt to collect a debt from a non-debtor is best characterized as a misrepresentation as to 'the character, amount, or legal status of any debt' in violation of 1692e(2)(A).\"\n   <em>\n    Stuart\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"31\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2011%20WL%20904167\">\n    2011 WL 904167\n   </extracted-citation>\n   at *4 n. 2. As discussed at length above, Medicredit repeatedly attempted to collect money from Ms. Young on debts that she did not owe. These efforts constitute attempts to collect a debt from a non-debtor. Medicredit violated 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 1692e(2)(A).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-104\">\n   C.\n   <em>\n    Medicredit Violated 1692e(10)\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-105\">\n   Ms. Young argues that Medicredit violated 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 1692e(10). (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   ECF No. 32 at 19.) That provision provides that \"[t]he use of any false representation or deceptive means to ... attempt to collect any debt or to obtain information concerning a consumer\" \"is a violation\" of the FDCPA. 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 1692e(10). Medicredit\n   sent Ms. Young at least three letters, each requesting that she \"give the past due account(s) the attention it deserves.\" (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   ECF Nos. 32-8, 32-9, and 32-10.) As noted above, Ms. Young did not owe on any of these accounts. Medicredit's letters create the false impression that she was obligated to pay these accounts. Medicredit's letters to Ms. Young constituted the use of a \"false representation or deceptive mean\" to attempt to collect a debt.

At least with respect to Account 4683, Medicredit violated \u00a7 1692c(a)(2).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-108\">\n   On July 5, 2016, Ms. Young's attorney, Lester Perry, sent Medicredit a letter regarding Account 4683-in addition to Account 4604 and Account 6966. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   ECF No. 32-14.) The letter stated that Mr. Perry's firm represented Ms. Young. (ECF No. 32-14 at 2 (\"Our firm represents Ms. ...

The letter also provided the firm's phone number and address. (ECF No. 32-14 at 2.) An entry from the Medicredit Account Notes, timestamped 7/20/2016 indicates that Medicredit received the letter by that date. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   ECF No. 32-16 at 5 (\"RECV ATTY REP LETTER.\").) On July 21, 2016, Medicredit called Ms. Young. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   ECF No. 32-16 at 80.) Medicredit violated 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 1692c(a)(2) because they contacted Ms. Young after knowing she was represented by an attorney.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-109\">\n   E.\n   <em>\n    Ms. Young Has Failed to Prove that Medicredit Violated 1692c(c)\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-110\">\n   Ms. Young argues that Medicredit \"violated\" \u00a7 1692c(c) of \"the FDCPA by failing to cease communicating with Young after receiving her refusal to pay the alleged debts.\" (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   ECF No. 32 at 21.) That provision provides, in relevant part, that \"[i]f a consumer notifies a debt collector in writing that the consumer refuses to pay a debt or that the consumer wishes the debt collector to cease further communication with the consumer, the debt collector shall not communicate further with the consumer with respect to such debt ....\" 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 1692c(c).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-111\">\n   Ms. Young argues that her \"attorneys informed Defendants that she did not owe the alleged debts because the Worker's Compensation Fund was solely responsible for payment.\" (ECF No. 32 at 21.) Here, Ms. Young appears to be referring to the two letters from Dawn Atkin to NPAS, (ECF No. 32-15 at 2-3.) Those letters were regarding Accounts 6966 and 4604. (ECF No. 32-15 at 2-3.) In each of those letters, Dawn Atkin wrote: \"based on\" \" Utah Code Ann. 34A-2-401(b)\" \"we dispute the validity of this debt as it applies to Robyn Young.\" (ECF No. 32-15 at 2-3.) The Medicredit Account Notes from July 5, 2016 provide, in relevant part, that \"SHE DOES HAVE AN ATTORNEY, DAWN ATKIN,\" and also provide \"LETTER # 2002 VA WC:PAT ND ATY INFO.\" (ECF No. 32-16 at 15.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-112\">\n   Despite this evidence, an issue of fact remains as to whether the letters should have informed Medicredit that it must\n   cease its collection efforts. First, the attorney letters mentioning \"workers compensation claim[s],\" (ECF No. 32-15 at 2-3) were sent to NPAS, not Medicredit. While there is evidence that Medicredit was aware that Dawn Atkin had sent letters, (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   ECF No. 32-16 at 15) Ms. Young has not presented evidence that Medicredit received the content of those letters. Second, even if Medicredit did receive the contents of those letters, those letters were regarding Accounts 6966 and 4604. An issue of fact exists as to whether that notice should have informed Medicredit that it must cease its collection efforts in Ms. Young's accounts that were not specifically referenced in the letters. Because issues of material fact exist, Ms. Young is not entitled to summary judgment as to whether Medicredit violated \u00a7 1692c(c).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-113\">\n   <em>\n    Summary as to Medicredit\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-114\">\n   To summarize, Ms. Young is entitled to summary judgment against Medicredit for violations of Sections 1692f(1), 1692e(2)(A), 1692e(10), and 1692c(a)(2) of the FDCPA. Ms. Young is not entitled to summary judgment against Medicredit for violating section 1692c(c).

In support of this argument, NPAS relies on the Intercompany Agreement, the Master Agreement, and the Consent for Care Agreements.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-135\">\n   The court first addresses the Intercompany Agreement and the Master Agreement. As noted above, Ms. Young was not a party to the Intercompany Agreement. Nor was she a party to the Master Agreement. As explained above, the Intercompany Agreement is \"between NPAS on the one hand, and HSS Systems, LLC\" on the other. (Wright Decl., \u00b6 3, ECF No. 93-1 at 3.) The Master Agreement is between Parallon and \"non-party Mountain Division, Inc.\" (Wright Decl., \u00b6 3, ECF No. 93-1 at 3.) NPAS relies on these agreements to support its position that NPAS only serviced accounts that were not in default. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   ECF No. 91 at 13.) The court is unpersuaded by NPAS' argument that it should defer to the definition of default in the agreements between NPAS and HSS and between Parallon and Mountain Division.

(\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   ECF No. 110 at 12 (\"a straightforward reliance on the [Consent for Care] Agreements confirms that NPAS is not bound by the FDCPA ....\").) The Consent for Care Agreements provided that \"[d]uring the time that the medical account is being serviced by the [Extended Business Office] Servicer, the account shall not be considered ... in default ....\" (ECF No. 92-6 at 3.) The Consent for Care Agreements allowed the \"Provider,\" St. Mark's Hospital, to unilaterally determine when the debt was \"in default.\" (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   ECF No. 92-6 at 3-4 (\"Upon return to the Provider by the EBO Servicer, the Provider ... may determine the account to be ... in default.\").)

NPAS' position is that until Congress ends its silence regarding the definition of the term \"default,\" parties may contractually define their own periods of default-and that under the Consent for Care Agreement, the debt NPAS was attempting to collect on was not in \"default.\" (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   ECF No. 110 at 10.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-138\">\n   This court acknowledges that some courts have looked to \"contractual provisions between\" \"creditors and debtors to determine whether a debt is in default at any given time.\"\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Barbato v.

Under the facts of this case the court finds the later cases persuasive.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-139\">\n   The Consent for Care Agreements do not define an objective period of default. Rather, they allow St. Mark's to unilaterally determine when an account is in default. The record reveals that St. Mark's Hospital did not place accounts with NPAS in any consistent manner. For example, Account 6966 was placed with NPAS just 22 days after Ms. Young received services. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   ECF No. 91 at 15.) Account 4683, on the other hand, was placed with NPAS 280 days after Ms. Young received services from St. Mark's. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   ECF No. 91 at 15.) The agreements place no constraints on St. Mark's ability to declare a debt in default and any supposed agreement with a patient on this issue would be illusory and not enforceable. Allowing St. Mark's to unilaterally determine the date an account has defaulted would contravene the FDCPA's purpose. Based on the facts of this case the court holds that the Consent for Care Agreements do not dictate when the accounts at issue are \"in default\" for FDCPA purposes.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-140\">\n   As discussed above, \"the determination of whether a debt is in default is to be made by the court on a case-by-case basis.\"\n   <em>\n    Head v.

Later, on \"February 27, 2015,\" Account\n   4683 was withdrawn from Medicredit and \"placed with NPAS for services performed by St. Mark's Hospital ....\" (Wright Decl., \u00b6 15, ECF No. 62-2 at 5.) \"This means that the debt was placed with NPAS two hundred eighty ... days after services were rendered to Plaintiff by St. Mark's Hospital.\" (ECF No. 91 at 15.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-143\">\n   Because it is undisputed that Medicredit is a debt collector, St. Mark's treated the account as in default when Medicredit attempted to collect on Account 4683 prior to NPAS obtaining the debt. Based on this fact alone, a reasonable person would have believed that St. Mark's viewed Account 4683 as already being in default when NPAS obtained it.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-144\">\n   Other factors discussed in\n   <em>\n    Mavris\n   </em>\n   support this conclusion. The urgency of the language used in NPAS' request weighs in Ms. Young's favor. NPAS sent Ms. Young a letter on or around November 5, 2015 stating: \"you are obligated to pay for the services provided. We strongly urge you to take advantage of this opportunity to resolve your balance.\" (ECF No. 82-2 at 2.) The use of the word \"obligated\" is strong language that weighs against NPAS. Ms. Young's \"knowledge that she ha[d] been referred to a third party\" also weighs in her favor.\n   <em>\n    Mavris\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4304565\" index=\"57\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/86/1079/#p1086\">\n    86 F.Supp.3d at 1086\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Based on Medicredit having already called Ms. Young six times prior to NPAS obtaining Account 4683, Ms. Young would have believed that she had been referred to a third party for collections. Additionally, the \"apparent attempt[ ] by the creditor or third party to circumvent the FDCPA's consumer protections\" factor weighs in Ms. Young's favor. St. Mark's Hospital is owned by Hospital Corporation of America. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   ECF No. 99-1 at 10.) Hospital Corporation of America owes Parallon. (ECF No. 99-1 at 5.) Parallon, in turn, owns Defendant NPAS, Inc. and Defendant Medicredit, Inc. (ECF No. 99-1 at 5.) The Intercompany Agreement itself provides that \"[t]he services provided by NPAS ... are as an extension of the Client Hospital's business office and not as a 'debt collector' as that term is defined under the ... FDCPA ....\" (ECF No. 93-3 at 4.) This by itself is evidence that NPAS' intent was to circumvent the protections of the FDCPA.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-145\">\n   The court concludes that the Account 4683 was in default by the time NPAS obtained it because any reasonable person in Ms. Young's position would have believed that St. Mark's viewed the debt as being in default. On these facts no reasonable jury could find otherwise.\n   <em>\n    Mavris\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4304565\" index=\"58\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/86/1079/#p1086\">\n    86 F.Supp.3d at 1086\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Even assuming the \"reasonable person\" standard does not govern, the 280 day period between St. Mark's providing the service and placing the account with NPAS provides further support for the conclusion that Account 4683 was in default when NPAS obtained it.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Alibrandi v. Fin. Outsourcing Servs., Inc.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9109004\" index=\"59\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/333/82/#p86\">\n    333 F.3d 82\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 87 (2d Cir. 2003) (\"various other federal regulations have defined default as commencing anywhere between thirty and 270 days after a debt becomes due.\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-146\">\n   Alternatively, even assuming that the Consent for Care Agreements could dictate when the accounts at issue were \"in default\" for FDCPA purposes, the fact that Account 4683 was placed with Medicredit before it was placed with NPAS provides an alternative basis for the court to hold that Account 4683 was \"in default\" when NPAS obtained it. To prevail on her motion for partial summary judgment, Ms. Young must prove that NPAS is a \"debt collector\" within the meaning of 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 1692a(6). Ms. Young has pointed to undisputed facts demonstrating that St. Mark's Hospital placed Account 4683 with NPAS after it had already placed that account with Medicredit. It is undisputed that Medicredit is a debt collector. And it\n   is undisputed that Medicredit called Ms. Young six times in October 2014 regarding this account. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   ECF No. 32-16 at 78;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   ECF No. 32-16 at 73.) If St. Mark's hospital placed Account 4683 with Medicredit, that is undisputed evidence that St. Mark's considered Account 4683 to be \"in default\" under the Consent for Care Agreement. If Account 4683 was \"in default\" prior to being placed with NPAS, that is evidence that NPAS serviced defaulted accounts. If NPAS serviced defaulted accounts, it is a \"debt collector\" under the FDCPA-at least with respect to Account 4683.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-147\">\n   The fourth element a plaintiff must prove to establish a violation of the FDCPA is that the defendant \"violated, by act or omission, a provision of the FDCPA.\"\n   <em>\n    Rhodes v. Olson Assocs., P.C.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4289170\" index=\"60\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/83/1096/#p1103\">\n    83 F.Supp.3d 1096\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 1103 (D. Colo. 2015). As noted above, Ms. Young argues that NPAS violated sections [1] 1692f(1), [2] 1692e(2)(A), [3] 1692e(10), [4] 1692c(a)(2), and [5] 1692c(c) of the FDCPA. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   ECF No. 32 at 15, 19, 21, and 22.) At this point of the analysis, the court holds only that Ms. Young has established for purposes of summary judgment that Account 4683 was in default when NPAS obtained it. As such, the violations discussed immediately below relate only to Account 4683. The court will discuss the other NPAS accounts separately below.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-148\">\n   1.\n   <em>\n    NPAS' Actions As to Account 4683 Violated 1692(f)(1)\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-149\">\n   Ms. Young argues that NPAS \"violated the FDCPA by collecting or attempting to collect debts that were not permitted by\" Utah law. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   ECF No. 32 at 14.) Ms. Young argues that under Utah's Workers Compensation Act, her employer, Granite School District, owed the debts. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   ECF No. 32 at 14.) As discussed above, because that statute is clear, the court concludes that the Utah Supreme Court would not allow a debt collector to attempt to collect medical debt from an employee when the responsibility to pay for that debt is on the employer. And, as discussed above, \"[t]he fact that the FDCPA is a strict liability statute ... means that one does not need to act knowingly or intentionally to violate the statute.\"\n   <em>\n    Sartori v. Steider &amp; Assocs., P.C.\n   </em>\n   , No. 1:15-CV-00991-JCH-LF,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"61\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2017%20WL%203602029\">\n    2017 WL 3602029\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *2 (D.N.M. Jan. 19, 2017). Because the FDCPA is a strict liability statute, NPAS violated section 1692f(1) when it sent her a letter on or around October 26, 2015 attempting to collect a debt that was not her duty to pay.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-150\">\n   2.\n   <em>\n    NPAS' Actions As to Account 4683 Violated 1692e(2)(A)\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-151\">\n   Ms. Young argues that NPAS \"violated the FDCPA by making false representations about the character, amount, or legal status of the debt ....\" (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   ECF No. 32 at 16.) NPAS attempted to collect money from Ms. Young on Account 4683 when it sent her a letter stating \"[y]ou are obligated to pay for the services provided.\" (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   ECF No. 82-2.) She did not owe this money. NPAS' letter violated 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 1692e(2)(A).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-152\">\n   3.\n   <em>\n    NPAS' Actions As to Account 4683 Violated 1692e(10)\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-153\">\n   Ms. Young argues that NPAS violated 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 1692e(10). (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   ECF No. 32 at 19.) That provision provides that \"[t]he use of any false representation or deceptive means to ... attempt to collect any debt or to obtain information concerning a consumer\" \"is a violation\" of the FDCPA. 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 1692e(10). NPAS' letter sent on or around October 26, 2015, provides that she was \"obligated to pay for the services\" St. Mark's provided. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   ECF No. 82-2 at 2.) Because Ms. Young was not obligated to pay the debt associated with Account 4683, NPAS' letter constituted a false representation\n   and a violation of 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 1692e(10).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-154\">\n   4.\n   <em>\n    As to Account 4683, Ms. Young's Motion for Summary Judgment Fails Against NPAS for Violating 1692c(a)(2)\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-155\">\n   Ms. Young argues that NPAS \"violated\" \u00a7 1692c(a)(2) of \"the FDCPA by communicating with Young after [it] knew she was represented by an attorney.\" (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   ECF No. 32 at 19.) That provision provides, in relevant part, that \"a debt collector may not communicate with a consumer in connection with the collection of any debt\" \"if the debt collector knows the consumer is represented by an attorney with respect to such debt and has knowledge of, or can readily ascertain, such attorney's name and address, unless the attorney fails to respond within a reasonable period of time to a communication from the debt collector ....\" 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 1692c(a)(2).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-156\">\n   Ms. Young's former attorney, Dawn Atkin, first wrote to NPAS on May 13, 2016. Dawn Atkin wrote two letters to NPAS on this date. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   ECF No. 32-15 at 2-3.) Neither letter referenced Account 4683. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   ECF No. 32-15 at 2-3 (the first letter referenced Account 6966; the second letter referenced Account 4604.).) On or around May 17, 2016, NPAS sent Ms. Young a letter regarding Account 4683. (ECF No. 32-3 at 2.) This letter, titled \"Attorney Representation Form,\" stated: \"[y]ou or the patient/responsible party have informed us that you are representing the patient/responsible party on the above listed account.\" (ECF No. 32-3 at 2.) On July 5, 2016, Ms. Young's attorney, Lester Perry, sent NPAS a letter regarding Account 4683 stating that his firm represented Ms. Young. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   ECF No. 32-4 at 2.) On or around August 26, 2016 NPAS sent Ms. Young a \"request for payment\" regarding Account 1159. (ECF No. 32-5 at 2.) NPAS sent Ms. Young another \"payment request\" regarding this account on or around September 23, 2016. (ECF No. 32-6 at 2.) NPAS sent Ms. Young a similar letter on or around October 24, 2016. (ECF No. 32-7 at 2.) This timeline presents two issues.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-157\">\n   First, whether NPAS' \"Attorney Representation Form\" letter constitutes a communication \"with a consumer in connection with the collection of [a] debt.\" 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 1692c(a). NPAS argues that the letter was not \"an attempt to collect a debt\" but merely sought \"to obtain confirmation about Plaintiff's attorney so that NPAS could thereafter communicate with Plaintiff's attorney.\" (ECF No. 62 at 38.) A reasonable jury could find that this letter was a communication with a consumer in connection with the collection of a debt in violation of 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 1692c(a)(2). But a reasonable jury could also find that this communication was not in connection with debt collection. Ms. Young is not entitled to summary judgment against NPAS on Account 4683 based on the May 17, 2016 letter.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-158\">\n   Second, whether the attorney letters NPAS received regarding Accounts 6966, 4604, and 4683 put NPAS on notice that Ms. Young was \"represented by an attorney with respect to\" Account 1159. Again, this is a question better answered by a jury. As to Account 4683, Ms. Young's Motion for Summary Judgment fails against NPAS for violating 1692c(a)(2).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-159\">\n   5.\n   <em>\n    As to Account 4683, Ms. Young's Summary Judgment Fails Against NPAS for Violating 1692c(c)\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-160\">\n   Ms. Young argues that NPAS \"violated\" \u00a7 1692c(c) of \"the FDCPA by failing to cease communicating with her after receiving her refusal to pay the alleged debts.\" (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   ECF No. 32 at 21.) That provision provides, in relevant part, that \"[i]f a consumer notifies a debt collector in writing that the consumer refuses to pay a debt or that the consumer wishes the debt\n   collector to cease further communication with the consumer, the debt collector shall not communicate further with the consumer with respect to such debt ....\" 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 1692c(c). Ms. Young has not presented evidence that NPAS communicated with her about Account 4683 after she informed NPAS in writing that she refused to pay. Absent such evidence her motion for summary judgment as to that account fails.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-161\">\n   <em>\n    Summary as to NPAS\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-162\">\n   To summarize, regarding Account 4683, Ms. Young is entitled to summary judgment against NPAS for violations of sections 1692f(1), 1692e(2)(A), and 1692e(10). Ms. Young is not entitled to summary judgment against NPAS for violating sections 1692c(a)(2) and 1692c(c). Regarding Account 4683, Ms. Young's Motion for Partial Summary Judgment against NPAS is therefore GRANTED in part and DENIED in part. NPAS' Motion for Partial Summary Judgment is DENIED.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-163\">\n   <em>\n    Disputed Issues of Fact Preclude Partial Summary Judgment Against NPAS as to the Other Accounts\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-164\">\n   Ms. Young's Motion for Summary Judgment against NPAS on accounts other than Account 4683 fails. There are disputed facts as to whether the other accounts were in default when NPAS obtained them from St. Mark's Hospital. Under the factors set out in\n   <em>\n    Mavris v. RSI Enterprises Inc.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4304565\" index=\"62\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/86/1079/#p1086\">\n    86 F.Supp.3d 1079\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 1090 (D. Ariz. 2015), a reasonable jury may find the accounts were in default at the time NPAS attempted to collect them. A reasonable jury may also, however, reject those findings and rule in favor of NPAS. Ms. Young's and NPAS' cross motions regarding the other five accounts at issue are both DENIED.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-165\">\n   III.\n   <em>\n    Defendants' Motion on Actual Damages\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-166\">\n   In her First Amended Complaint, Ms. Young alleges that \"[p]ursuant to Section 1692k, each of the defendants are liable ... for the actual damage caused by their collection actions plus additional damages not exceeding $1,000 for each defendant.\" (Am.

The court reasoned:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-177\">\n   Since the FCRA was enacted seven years before the FDCPA, the Court concludes that Congress must have been aware of those decisions that predate the FDCPA. Despite its awareness of these decisions, Congress still enacted the FDCPA using nearly identical enforcement language.

(ECF No. 89-6, Young Depo. 38: 12-21 (\"if I received a letter or a telephone call from Medicredit ... or NPAS ... [t]hat causes me to get more anxiety, more stress\n   <em>\n    and crying.\n   </em>\n   \") (emphasis added).) Further, unlike the plaintiff in\n   <em>\n    Llewellyn\n   </em>\n   , Ms. Young did provide corroborating evidence.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-183\">\n   Ms. Young's testimony was corroborated by her sister, Ms. Wheat. Ms. Wheat testified that Ms. Young was \"sick and tired of [the Defendants] calling.\" (ECF No. 89-7, Wheat Depo. 23: 24-25.) Ms. Wheat also testified that the phone calls \"wore on\" Ms. Young. (ECF No. 89-7, Wheat Depo. 24: 1-2.) Ms. Wheat also testified about a specific time that Ms. Young went to her office to talk about one of the phone calls she received from a debt collector. (ECF No. 89-7, Wheat Depo. 28: 14-22 (\"She walked in and we started talking and she -it was a fine day and she wasn't having a migraine or anything like that. She was fine.

Ms. Wheat further testified that the debt collectors \"coming after her\" (ECF No. 89-7, Wheat Depo. 30: 24) \"ma[d]e her emotional\" and \"\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     would make her cry\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n   .\" (ECF No. 89-7, Wheat Depo. 32: 2-5 (emphasis added).).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-184\">\n   The court agrees with Defendants that Ms. Young is required to explain \"her injury in reasonable detail and not rely on conclusory statements.\"\n   <em>\n    Llewellyn\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3804025\" index=\"92\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/711/1173/#p1178\">\n    711 F.3d at 1182\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . But viewing allegations in the light most favorable to Ms. Young, and drawing all reasonable inferences in her favor, the court concludes that she has provided sufficient evidence to create a genuine dispute of fact as to whether the Defendants actions caused her to suffer emotional damages.

Because Ms. Young seeks to amend her complaint after the time for amendment under the court's scheduling order has expired, she must demonstrate both \"(1) good cause for seeking modification under Fed.

A stronger rationale exists for having a uniform interpretation when it comes to defining 'actual damages' under the FDCPA.\")\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"17\">\n   <p id=\"p-219\">\n    In order to determine whether the Defendants' collection efforts were \"permitted by law\" under 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 1692f(1), this court relied on\n    <em>\n     Johnson\n    </em>\n    for the proposition that \"every circuit court decision that has applied the 'permitted by law' standard has asked simply whether state substantive law permitted the FDCPA defendant to collect the money that it demanded.\"\n    <em>\n     Johnson v. Riddle\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11393165\" index=\"95\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/305/1107/#p1117\">\n     305 F.3d 1107\n    </extracted-citation>\n    , 1118 (10th Cir. 2002). The court recognizes that-at first blush-there may appear to be an incongruity in looking to state law on this issue while simultaneously holding that actual damages for emotional distress can be proved independent of state law requirements. But Congress made its intent regarding state laws clear in 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 1692n, which provides:\n   </p>\n   <blockquote id=\"p-220\">\n    [t]his subchapter does not annul, alter, or affect, or exempt any person subject to the provisions of this subchapter from complying with the laws of any State with respect to debt collection practices except to the extent that those laws are inconsistent with any provision of this subchapter, and then only to the extent of the inconsistency. For purposes of this section, a State law is not inconsistent with this subchapter if the protection such law affords any consumer is greater than the protection provided by this subchapter.\n   </blockquote>\n   <p id=\"p-221\">\n    15 U.S.C. \u00a7 1692n.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-222\">\n    Utah Code Ann. \u00a7 34A-2-401(2)(a-b) is not inconsistent with the FDCPA because, when read in conjunction with the FDCPA, it affords consumers greater protections from unfair collection practices than the FDCPA alone. Looking to state law standards for intentional infliction of emotional distress in order to recover actual damages for emotional distress would afford consumers fewer protections than the standard adopted by those courts that analogize the FDCPA to the FCRA. Affording fewer protections to consumers was not Congress' intent. \"Because the FDCPA\" \"is a remedial statute\" that should be \"construed liberally in favor of the consumer,\"\n    <em>\n     Johnson v. Riddle\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11393165\" index=\"96\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/305/1107/#p1117\">\n     305 F.3d 1107\n    </extracted-citation>\n    , 1117 (10th Cir. 2002) the court holds that when a violation of the FDCPA has been established, actual damages for emotional distress can be proved independent of state law requirements.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n </opinion>\n</casebody>\n"
