With this motion, Defendant requests the Court to dismiss the action in its entirety with prejudice. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 2.) In her two-count Complaint, Plaintiff alleges that Defendant violated the Age Discrimination in Employment Act (\"ADEA\") and the Pennsylvania Human Relations Act (\"PHRA\") in that she was terminated because of her age and/or because of age-related complaints lodged to both the trainer, Judy Kunkel, and the hiring manager/site supervisor, Stacy Mason, during her initial training period. (Doc. 1.) For the reasons discussed below, the Court concludes that Defendant is entitled to summary judgment on Plaintiff's age discrimination claims but disputed issues of\n   material fact preclude the entry of summary judgment on Plaintiff's retaliation claims.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   <em>\n    <strong>\n     II.

(Def.'s Statement of Undisputed Material Facts, Doc. 26 \u00b6\u00b6 1-2; Pl.'s Answer to Defendant's Statement of Undisputed Material Facts, Doc. 33-1 \u00b6\u00b6 1-2.) In 2015, she applied to work at Citizens Telecom Services Co. (\"CTSI\"), commonly referred to as \"Frontier.\" (Doc. 26 \u00b6 8; Doc. 33-1 \u00b6 8.) Plaintiff wrote on the application that her full name is \"Gloria J. Saporito Chase\" and she signed the application \"Gloria Jean Saporito.\" (Doc. 26 \u00b6\u00b6 8, 11; Doc. 33-1 \u00b6\u00b6 8, 11.) Plaintiff had worked for CTSI from about 2004 to 2007. (Doc. 26 \u00b6 6; Doc. 33-1 \u00b6 6.) Plaintiff used her maiden name on her application because she felt she could use both names or either name and was seeking a new feeling of independence after separating from her husband. (Doc. 26 \u00b6 10; Doc. 33-1 \u00b6 10.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   Stacy Mason was based in Johnstown, New York, and was the Supervisor of the Commercial Contact Center with responsibility for managing a team of work-at-home employees in New York and Pennsylvania. (Doc. 26 \u00b6 14; Doc. 33-1 \u00b6 14.) After Frontier Recruiting Coordinator, Sarah Gallert, first reached out to Plaintiff at Mason's request to set up a phone interview, Mason conducted the phone interview on February 17, 2015. (Doc. 26 \u00b6\u00b6 13-15; Doc. 33-1 \u00b6\u00b6 13-15.) During the in-person interview on February 23, 2015, at Defendant's Dallas, Pennsylvania, location, Plaintiff told Mason that she had worked for CTSI under her married name and she was using her maiden name. (Doc. 26 \u00b6 17; Doc. 33-1 \u00b6 17.) Gallert did not know Plaintiff was a former CTSI employee during the hiring process because she checked Frontier's records under the name Saporito. (Doc. 26 \u00b6 19; Doc. 33-1 \u00b6 19.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   Plaintiff received an offer of employment via email from Gallert. (Doc. 26 \u00b6 21; Doc. 33-1 \u00b6 21.) The offer letter attached to the email was addressed to Gloria Jean Saporito. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) The offer letter stated as follows:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-15\">\n   Federal law requires that you provide documentation (I-9) confirming your eligibility to work in the United States. A list of documents that you may use to establish our identity and employment eligibility can be found through our electronic on-boarding tool, Red Carpet.

Plaintiff understood that providing the documentation was a requirement of the job. (Doc. 26 \u00b6 24; Doc. 33-1 \u00b6 24.) Plaintiff accepted the job offer, signing her name \"Gloria Jean Saporito.\" (Doc. 26 \u00b6 25; Doc. 33-1 \u00b6 25.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   On March 19, 2015, Plaintiff received an email from Gallert reminding her to bring two forms of identification to the first day of training. (Doc. 26 \u00b6 26; Doc. 33-1 \u00b6 26.) The list of acceptable identification documents was attached to the email. (Doc. 26 \u00b6 27; Doc. 33-1 \u00b6 27.) Plaintiff understood that the Lists of Acceptable Documents noted that all documents must be unexpired. (Doc. 26 \u00b6 28; Doc. 33-1 \u00b6 28.) Plaintiff responded to the email, \"Thanks I will bring ID.\" (Doc. 26 \u00b6 29; Doc. 33-1 \u00b6 29.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   Work-at-home employment with Frontier starts with a five to six week in-person training course. (Doc. 26 \u00b6 30; Doc. 33-1 \u00b6 30.) Plaintiff's class had twelve employees. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) Plaintiff started work on Monday, March 23, 2015. (Doc. 26 \u00b6 31; Doc. 33-1 \u00b6 31.) The new-hire trainer, Judy Kunkel, collected everyone's I-9 documentation. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) Plaintiff claims she told Kunkel that everything was under her married name, Gloria Chase, and Kunkel said to \"let HR worry about it.\" (Doc. 26 \u00b6 32; Doc. 33-1 \u00b6 32.) Plaintiff provided a driver's license which was dated as expired in 2007 and a Social Security Card, both under the name \"Gloria Jean Chase.\" (Doc. 26 \u00b6\u00b6 33-34; Doc. 33-1 \u00b6\u00b6 33-34.) Kunkel testified that she faxed the new-hire class I-9 documentation to Gallert who was responsible for making sure the documentation for the class was in order. (Doc. 26 \u00b6 36; Doc. 33-1 \u00b6 36.) Plaintiff provided to Defendant the documents that she felt were legal. (Doc. 26 \u00b6 38; Doc. 33-1 \u00b6 38.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   On the first day of training, Kunkel distributed a document titled \"Course Expectations.\" (Doc. 26 \u00b6 39; Doc. 33-1 \u00b6 39.) Plaintiff understood that training attendance was required to be one hundred percent. (Doc. 26 \u00b6 40; Doc. 33-1 \u00b6 40.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   Early in the training, Kunkel displayed a spreadsheet for the employees in the class to write down their employee ID numbers and took it down a few seconds later when she realized it also contained the employees' birthdates. (Doc. 26 \u00b6 41; Doc. 33-1 \u00b6 41.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   Plaintiff said that two other new hires, Lisa Webby and Mollie Peeler, began teasing her on the first day of training. (Doc. 26 \u00b6 42; Doc. 33-1 \u00b6 42.) Webby was born in 1965 and Peeler was born in 1960. (Doc. 26 \u00b6 43; Doc. 33-1 \u00b6 43.) Peeler believed she was the oldest in the class. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) The next day, Tuesday, Plaintiff complained to Kunkel about the comments made by Webby and Peeler. (Doc. 26 \u00b6 44; Doc. 33-1 \u00b6 44.) Plaintiff said the teasing included comments such as \"Are you okay? Are you getting this\" \"Are you learning this?\" and \"I hope I'm not working at that age.\" (Doc. 26 \u00b6 45; Doc. 33-1 \u00b6 45.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   On Wednesday, March 25\n   <sup>\n    th\n   </sup>\n   , Gallert emailed Kunkel about the I-9 documentation issues with the class. (Doc. 26 \u00b6 46; Doc. 33-1 \u00b6 46.) She stated that Plaintiff and another employee would be suspended if they did not turn in identification. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) Kunkel the told Plaintiff that she received an email from Gallert indicating that Frontier needed more information with her maiden name, which she had used on her application. (Doc. 26 \u00b6 47; Doc. 33-1 \u00b6 47.) Plaintiff emailed Gallert her Certificate of Baptism that night. (Doc. 26 \u00b6 48; Doc. 33-1 \u00b6 48.) Plaintiff acknowledged that a Certificate of Baptism is not an acceptable form of identification. (Doc. 26 \u00b6 49; Doc. 33-1 \u00b6 49.) Plaintiff did not send Gallert the Voter Registration card or license camera card she had offered to Kunkel, both of which were under the name Gloria Jean\n   Chase. (Doc. 26 \u00b6\u00b6 50-51; Doc. 33-1 \u00b6\u00b6 50-51.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   On Thursday, March 26\n   <sup>\n    th\n   </sup>\n   , Plaintiff called Mason before work to complain about the alleged comments made by her co-workers. (Doc. 26 \u00b6 52; Doc. 33-1 \u00b6 52.) Plaintiff noted that Mason was \"very upset\" and \"shocked\" by Plaintiff's complaints. (Doc. 26 \u00b6 53; Doc. 33-1 \u00b6 53.) After Plaintiff and Mason spoke, Mason called Kunkel and asked her to address the class about basic common courtesy and Kunkel did so. (Doc. 26 \u00b6 55; Doc. 33-1 \u00b6 55.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   Mason then heard from Gallert that Plaintiff had not produced two forms of identification as required. (Doc. 26 \u00b6 56; Doc. 33-1 \u00b6 56.) Gallert was not aware of Plaintiff's complaint as to her co-workers' comments on seeing her birthdate as listed on the spreadsheet posted, and Gallert did not discuss terminating Plaintiff with Mason. (Doc. 26 \u00b6 57; Doc. 33-1 \u00b6 57.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   Mason spoke with Plaintiff again, and Plaintiff indicated she did not know when she would get the required identification documents. (Doc. 26 \u00b6 58; Doc. 33-1 \u00b6 58.) Mason then spoke with Human Resources Manager, Tracy Owen, about Plaintiff's not having her documentation in on time and not having an estimate of when it would be available. (Doc. 26 \u00b6 59; Doc. 33-1 \u00b6 59.) Owen said she made the decision to terminate Plaintiff. (Doc. 26 \u00b6 61; Doc. 33-1 \u00b6 61.) She took into consideration the one hundred percent attendance policy and Plaintiff's inability to say when she would get valid identification documents. (Doc. 26 \u00b6 62; Doc. 33-1 \u00b6 62.) Owen was not aware of any other employee in her region who failed to provide the legally-required documentation to accompany their I-9 form. (Doc. 26 \u00b6 63; Doc. 33-1 \u00b6 63.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   After speaking with Owen, Mason called Kunkel and told her the decision had been made to terminate Plaintiff. (Doc. 26 \u00b6 64; Doc. 33-1 \u00b6 64.) Plaintiff was terminated on Thursday, March 26, 2015. (Doc. 26 \u00b6 65; Doc. 33-1 \u00b6 65.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   Plaintiff understood the purpose of the I-9 Form was to verify her identity and eligibility to work in the United States and that Frontier has rules it has to follow. (Doc. 26 \u00b6 66; Doc. 33-1 \u00b6 66.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   After Plaintiff was terminated, she went home and called to see if she could obtain a birth certificate and called the courthouse to apply for a name change. (Doc. 26 \u00b6 67; Doc. 33-1 \u00b6 67.) Plaintiff felt it may take time to get the documents needed but if she could prove she could get them she could be permitted to make up training with another employee in her class, Jack Marchese, who had missed class during the first week because of a medical emergency. (Doc. 26 \u00b6\u00b6 68-69; Doc. 33-1 \u00b6\u00b6 68-69.) Mason permitted Marchese, who had not turned in I-9 documents by the end of the work day on Wednesday, to make up the training time on Saturday. (Doc. 26 \u00b6 70; Doc. 33-1 \u00b6 70.) Mason made the decision to permit Marchese to make up the training as an accommodation because he missed class due to a medical issue. (Doc. 26 \u00b6 71; Doc. 33-1 \u00b6 71.) Owen was not aware the Marchese was permitted to make up class until after Plaintiff was terminated. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) Marchese was born in 1963. (Doc. 26 \u00b6 73; Doc. 33-1 \u00b6 73.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   After Plaintiff's termination, Owen spoke to her about the termination and other concerns. (Doc. 26 \u00b6 75; Doc. 33-1 \u00b6 75.) Owen did not do any additional investigation because she felt what had been done was sufficient. (Doc. 26 \u00b6 76; Doc. 33-1 \u00b6 76.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   Plaintiff believes Defendant discriminated against her on the basis of her age. (Doc. 26 \u00b6 77; Doc. 33-1 \u00b6 77.) She also believes she was retaliated against for complaints made to Mason. (Doc. 26 \u00b6 78; Doc. 33-1 \u00b6 78.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   <strong>\n    III.

Owen also testified that she was the one who made the decision to terminate Plaintiff. (Owen Dep., Doc. 33-20 at 4, 11:5-11.) No evidence of record contradicts Mason's and Owen's testimony of the decisionmaker issue or otherwise infers that Owen did not make the decision to terminate Plaintiff. On these facts, a reasonable factfinder could not conclude that Owen did not make the decision to terminate Plaintiff. Therefore,\n   for purposes of the comparator analysis, Owen was the main decisionmaker for Plaintiff's termination while Mason decided the accommodation for Marchese.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-56\">\n   Although Plaintiff and Marchese arguably engaged in the same conduct insofar as neither timely submitted I-9 documents, there were \"differentiating or mitigating circumstances that would distinguish their conduct or the employer's treatment of them for it,\"\n   <em>\n    Ogden\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11425267\" index=\"74\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-2d/226/588/#p603\">\n    226 F.Supp.2d at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   603 : Plaintiff's failure to provide documents was not due to medical absence as was the case with Marchese; and Plaintiff admitted that she did not provide a timeframe for submitting I-9 documentation (Doc. 33-1 58) where no evidence suggests Marchese would not provide the documentation upon his return. In\n   <em>\n    Martino v. Southern Financial Group\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6047690\" index=\"75\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/715/195/\">\n    715 F.3d 195\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (7th Cir. 2013), the substantially different \"nature of I-9 issues vis-\u00e0-vis the termination decision\" precluded finding the suggested comparator suitable in the similarly-situated inquiry.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6047690\" index=\"76\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/715/195/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6047690\" index=\"76\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/715/195/\">\n    at 204\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . The record here shows Plaintiff's and Marchese's I-9 issues are substantially different. Therefore, Plaintiff has not satisfied her burden of showing that Marchese was a similarly situated employee. As she presents no other comparator, she cannot satisfy the fourth prong of her prima facie case by showing that a sufficiently younger employee was treated more favorably.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-57\">\n   Plaintiff also urges the Court to find that the fourth prong is satisfied because her request to make up time was denied under circumstances that give rise to an inference of discrimination. (Doc. 33 at 7.) In support of the general argument that she has established an inference of discrimination, Plaintiff notes that, in addition to being relevant to her retaliation claim, her request to be allowed to make up time as Marchese was permitted is relevant to her prima facie case as the request was denied after she \"almost unquestionably made a complaint of age discrimination to Stacy Mason\" a short time before she was fired. (Doc. 33 at 7.) She also asserts the following: Defendant's argument that make-up training was not available lacks credibility; Mason's characterization of the termination as a type of government requirement is not supported by law and, if it was, an exception was made for Marchese; emails stated that the consequence for failing to turn in I-9 documents was suspension; Plaintiff was a rehire who had a permanent ID with the company; her background check provided both her maiden name and married name and indicated she had completed basic employment verification; Defendant's argument that certain people were not aware of Plaintiff's rehire status is not credible; Mason admitted she knew Plaintiff was a former employee; and there is a dispute of fact as to whether Mason asked for permission to fire Plaintiff from Tracy Owen. (Doc. 33 at 7-10.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-58\">\n   Assuming Plaintiff's assertions to be true for purposes of her prima facie age discrimination showing, she does not point to a single fact that relates to discrimination on the basis of age. As set out above, the rebuttable presumption established with the prima facie case is only warranted where there is a logical connection between the element and the illegal discrimination.\n   <em>\n    O'Connor\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11744659\" index=\"77\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/517/308/#p312\">\n    517 U.S. at 311-12\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11744659\" index=\"78\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/517/308/#p312\">\n    116 S.Ct. 1307\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Thus, no matter how flexible the fourth prong of an age discrimination prima facie case is, facts relied upon to create an inference of age discrimination must show a logical connection with such discrimination. The record in this case is devoid of age references or potential inferences except for the facts that Kunkel mistakenly posted the spreadsheet that included new hires' birthdates several days before Plaintiff was terminated, Plaintiff alleged that after the spreadsheet\n   was posted two coworkers made derogatory comments related to her age and where she lived, she told Kunkel about the coworker conduct the day before her termination, and she told Mason about it the morning of her termination. The record does not show that any of Defendant's administrative employees ever made a comment, expressly or inferentially, about age of any sort before or after Plaintiff lodged her complaints. Kunkel and Mason mention age only at their depositions in the context of being asked whether other new hires made comments about Plaintiff's age or Plaintiff reported coworker harassment about her age. (Doc. 33-6 at 6, 17:4-7; Doc. 33-11 at 7-8, 20:16-22:8.) Kunkel said she never heard any comments about age and both Mason and Kunkel denied Plaintiff had complained about age-related harassment and were unsure what had been said about the spreadsheet display. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) Plaintiff does not proffer other allegedly age-related terminations by Defendant or any adverse action whatsoever which might be connected to age bias. She relies on flaws and inconsistencies in statements made and actions taken by Defendant's administrative employees, apparently presuming they create the inference that the decision to terminate her was based on age. On this record, the Court is not persuaded that Plaintiff has pointed to evidence sufficient to raise an inference of unlawful age discrimination, the minimum showing required.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.,\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Pivirotto\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11577279\" index=\"79\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/191/344/#p357\">\n    191 F.3d at 357\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

(Doc. 33 at 13.) In this section of her brief, Plaintiff first highlights the fact that she was terminated rather than suspended, asserting that \"[t]he record indicates that the consequence for failing to provide I-9 documentation was suspension.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 13-14.) Presumably, Plaintiff is referring to the email which Gallert sent to Kunkel on Wednesday, March 25, 2015, indicating that certain employees had outstanding I-9 issues and the issues \"needed [to be] addressed today so they can take care of prior to COB tomorrow. If these issues are not resolved at that time, the employee will be suspended pending they can provide\n   appropriate documents.\" (Doc. 26-1 at 112.) Regarding Plaintiff, the email indicated that \"Gloria Saporito\" needed \"to provide documents with correct last name. She filled out all new hire forms with 'Saporito' the documents need to match.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) Gallert then noted \"* *All documents must be unexpired as well,\" and closed with the comment \"[l]et me know if they have any questions.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   )\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-66\">\n   If this email is the evidence Plaintiff relies upon for the proposition that suspension was the appropriate consequence, she cannot show pretext on the basis alleged by pointing to an email from a person who was not the decisionmaker. While Owen conferred with Gallert about Plaintiff's failure to provide documents (Doc. 33-20 at 4, 11:12-20), Owen testified that Gallert had no authority to say that Plaintiff would be suspended rather than fired (Doc. 33-20 at 7, 22:4-7) and she made the decision to terminate Plaintiff because Gallert had told her that Plaintiff \"had not complied and was unable to get any of the documents that were required for I-9 compliance\" (\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 4, 11:21-24). Owen also testified that she had the discretion to suspend or terminate Plaintiff by virtue of her \"abilities under [her] current role\" and she did not suspend Plaintiff because Plaintiff did not know when she would be able to get the required documents. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 5, 16:12-20.) This unrefuted testimony indicates that Owen had the authority to terminate rather than suspend Plaintiff-she consulted with Gallert and no evidence suggests that Gallert had the authority to decide the repercussions of not being able to provide I-9 documentation within a given timeframe.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-67\">\n   Elsewhere in her brief, Plaintiff asserts there is a dispute of material fact as to whether Mason asked Owen for permission to fire Plaintiff, implying that Mason was the decisionmaker. (Doc. 33 at 10.) However, as discussed previously, Plaintiff's assertion does not give rise to a disputed issue of material fact in that the record shows Mason clarified what she meant by permission and no evidence suggests Owen was not the decisionmaker.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    supra\n   </em>\n   pp. 437-38. Further, even if there were a disputed fact as to the decisionmaker's identity, such a dispute would not show that termination was not an available option to suspension.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-68\">\n   The record may support the conclusions that the decision to terminate Plaintiff was not based on careful consideration of the facts related to her I-9 issues, administrative personnel were not sensitive to the predicament created by Plaintiff's use of her maiden name on her application, and the decision to terminate rather than suspend Plaintiff was harsh. However, the difference between what was said in Gallert's email and the subsequent final decision does not present a contradiction that a reasonable factfinder could find Owen's rationale unworthy of credence: it is undisputed that she had the authority to terminate Plaintiff, Plaintiff had not submitted acceptable paperwork in response to Gallert's email, and Plaintiff indicated that she did not know when she would be able to do so.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-69\">\n   Plaintiff maintains it is \"highly suggestive of pretext\" that federal law does not require what Defendant says regarding I-9's provision addressing the situation where an employee does not have the appropriate documentation.

(Doc. 33 at 15.) Putting aside the arguable factual flaws contained in the argument (\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Doc. 35 at 10), Plaintiff makes no attempt to show that Owen or anyone else knew the receipt-rule applied and chose not to apply it. Thus she has not presented evidence that the alleged failure to apply the receipt rule was a pretext for discrimination and the evidence in the record does not support the inference. Owen's testimony included the following statements: the I-9 document list provided to employees includes \"such things as birth certificates, valid driver's licenses, valid passports and such\" (Doc. 33-20 at 10, 33:20-34:5); she was not aware of Defendant accepting any forms of identification beyond what was on the list, \"[i]t has to be something on the list\" (\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   , 34:13-17); \"we comply with the law that says we have to produce these documents\" (\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   , 33:6-7); \"Our understanding is due to the federal law that we are not allowed to have employees work if they have not produced those documents within three business days ... [s]o our ... action if they don't is to either suspend[ ] them or terminate them\" (\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   ); and a corporate employee has the authority to make that decision (\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   , 35:10-36:5). From this testimony, taken in conjunction with that reviewed above concerning the specifics of the decision to terminate Plaintiff, a reasonable factfinder could not conclude that Owen believed she acted inappropriately in Plaintiff's case. Therefore, failure to provide Plaintiff with a ninety-day period to produce documents does not show pretext for discrimination.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-82\">\n   Before moving to the\n   <em>\n    Fuentes'\n   </em>\n   second prong, the Court will briefly review evidence presented at the prima facie stage which Plaintiff also relies upon at step three. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Doc. 33 at 13.) Evidence identified related to treatment of Marchese (Doc. 33 at 7-8) does not show pretext for the reasons discussed above: he is not a proper comparator so any discrepancy between his treatment and Plaintiff's is not evidence of pretext.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    supra\n   </em>\n   pp. 437-38.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-83\">\n   Plaintiff asserts that \"to the extent Defendant attempts to argue that make-up training was unavailable, such an argument lacks credibility.\" (Doc. 33 at 8.) Plaintiff points to a Saturday make-up training for Marchese as evidence that the accommodation was available. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) But Plaintiff does not refute with evidence of record that Owen did not make the decision to allow Marchese to make up the time missed in the first week or that Owen did not know about Mason's accommodation when she terminated Plaintiff. (Doc. 26 \u00b6 71; Doc. 33-1 \u00b6 71.) Nor does she point to evidence which shows Owen believed that Plaintiff could work until she provided the required documentation or make up an indeterminate amount of time if she was suspended until she provided the documentation. The record shows that Owen testified that Gallert told her Plaintiff did not know when she could produce the required documents (Doc. 33-20 at 4-6, 11:14-24, 16:23-17:4) and Mason provided the same information (Doc. 33-11 at 22, 79:24-80:9). This testimony indicates that Owen did not know the duration of the period of time Plaintiff would be out of work and miss training. Evidence showing that limited make-up training was available does not show that more extensive make-up training was possible for Plaintiff or anyone else. Therefore, Plaintiff's conclusory assertion that an argument that make-up training was unavailable for Plaintiff lacks credibility could not provide a basis for a\n   reasonable factfinder to conclude that the reason for termination was pretext.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-84\">\n   Plaintiff's reliance on Mason's characterization of the termination as \"some type of government requirement\" (Doc. 33 at 8) is also unavailing. For reasons similar to those discussed above regarding IRCA compliance, a misapprehension about a regulatory provision does not show pretext without a showing that the error was knowing and intentional.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.,\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Martino\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6047690\" index=\"123\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/715/195/\">\n    715 F.3d at 205\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . More importantly, this principle applies to the decisionmaker.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6047690\" index=\"124\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/715/195/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   Mason testified that Owen made the decision to terminate Plaintiff (Doc. 33-11 at 9, 28:3-29:9), Owen testified that she made the decision to terminate (Doc. 33-20 at 4, 11:5-11), and, as the Court previously decided, Plaintiff presents no evidence sufficient to contradict this testimony. In this context, the fact that Mason did not make a recommendation to Owen about suspending Plaintiff rather than terminating her does not show that Owen's proffered reason for termination was pretextual. The question of whether the decision not to weigh in on Owen's decision was due to a belief that a government recommendation regarding documentation was in play (Doc. 33-11 at 10) or some other reason may go to Mason's credibility, but, without more, that credibility question is not imputed to Owen. No evidence suggests that Mason was tasked with IRCA compliance or interpretation such that she was to inform Owen about the application of relevant provisions to Plaintiff's case-a situation which would put her in the position of a co-decisionmaker.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-85\">\n   Plaintiff next points to evidence related to \"rehire\" status, she had a permanent ID number with the company, and information contained in her background check showed both names and her eligibility to work. (Doc. 33 at 9.) Although the Court does not find that Defendant's evaluation of Plaintiff's employment status could be characterized as thorough, the inquiry is not whether HR and other administrative personnel did a good job. As the Circuit Court has regularly reminded, \"we do 'not sit as a super-personnel department that reexamines an entity's business decisions.' \"\n   <em>\n    Capps\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12185052\" index=\"125\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/847/144/#p155\">\n    847 F.3d at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   154 n.9 (quoting\n   <em>\n    McCoy\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"10520108\" index=\"126\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/957/368/#p373\">\n    957 F.2d at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   373 ;\n   <em>\n    Boyle v.

App'x 140\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 144 (3d Cir. 2017) (quoting\n   <em>\n    Capps\n   </em>\n   ) ). While the evidence shows some administrative personnel knew Plaintiff had worked for a company absorbed by Defendant, the employment ended eight years earlier. (Doc. 26 \u00b6 6; Doc. 33-1 \u00b6 6.) Importantly, Plaintiff never explicitly told Gallert, Mason, or Kunkel that she had completed the I-9 paperwork for her previous employment. Rather, in a March 19\n   <sup>\n    th\n   </sup>\n   pre-employment email she sent to Gallert in response to Gallert's email outlining \"First Day Details\" including the need for two-forms of ID to establish identity and work eligibility within the U.S., Plaintiff said \"I will bring\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12397528\" index=\"128\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-appx/689/140/#p144\">\n    ID.\n   </extracted-citation>\n   I completed paperwork previously.\" (Doc. 26-1 at 89; Doc. 33-1 \u00b6 82.) The fact that Plaintiff's maiden name and married name appeared on numerous documents, including her application and background check, raises a question as to why some procedure to address the I-9 problem could not have been worked out. However, the record evidence does not show that Plaintiff's direct conversations about the name confusion issue with Kunkel (first day of employment and day before termination) and Mason (day of termination) were shared with Owen before she made the decision to terminate Plaintiff. Moreover, it is not disputed that following Gallert's March 25\n   <sup>\n    th\n   </sup>\n   email Plaintiff did not provide a document needed to establish employment authorization as identified in Gallert's March 19\n   <sup>\n    th\n   </sup>\n   email.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-86\">\n   Plaintiff avers that the timing of her termination applies to her discrimination\n   claim as well as her retaliation claim. (Doc. 33 at 7.) Plaintiff does not provide authority or otherwise develop an argument to support a conclusion that the timing shows pretext for discrimination\n   <em>\n    on the basis of age.\n   </em>\n   Importantly, while suspicious timing does constitute circumstantial, or indirect, evidence to support a claim of discrimination, \"timing alone does not create a genuine issue as to pretext if the plaintiff is unable to prove, through other circumstantial evidence, that he was terminated for a reason other than that proffered by the employer.\"\n   <em>\n    Pugh v.

Thus, suspicious timing is only sufficient to demonstrate a showing of pretext if the plaintiff presents other evidence (in addition to his own explanation) that casts doubt on the veracity the proffered reason for the adverse action. (\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9499476\" index=\"130\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/259/619/#p628\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   ) The foregoing review indicates that Plaintiff has not produced such evidence.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-87\">\n   In sum, the evidence cited by Plaintiff is not sufficient to allow a factfinder to reasonably disbelieve Defendant's articulated reason for termination. In making this determination, the Court adheres to the guiding principle set out in\n   <em>\n    Boyle\n   </em>\n   : \"[n]o matter how medieval a firm's practices, no matter how high-handed its decisional process, no matter how mistaken the firm's managers, the ADEA does not interfere.

(Doc. 33 at 16.) To support this assertion, Plaintiff posits that \"[i]t is genuinely hard to believe that trained HR processionals would be completely\n   unaware of I-9 applicable regulations. And, again, Plaintiff was a former employee with an ID number.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) The Court concludes Plaintiff has not satisfied her burden of showing a genuine dispute for trial as to pretext based on the second prong of the\n   <em>\n    Fuentes\n   </em>\n   analysis.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-92\">\n   Plaintiff has not pointed to evidence that would allow a factfinder to reasonably disbelieve Defendant's articulated reason for termination, and she does not discuss how the evidence unsuccessfully relied upon to satisfy the first prong satisfies the second prong. Further, Plaintiff has not provided additional evidence addressing specific second-prong methodology. Plaintiff does not even suggest that Defendant previously discriminated against her or against others within her protected class. Although she has attempted to show discrimination based on treatment of an allegedly similarly situated individual, the Court has rejected her argument that the identified comparator was similarly situated as required under the ADEA.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    supra\n   </em>\n   pp. 439-40. Further, as noted in the context of Plaintiff's prima facie case, the record is devoid of any disparaging reference to age or any inference of age bias on the part of any of Defendant's employees.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    supra\n   </em>\n   pp. 440-41.

(Doc. 27 at 20.) Defendant maintains the necessary causal connection is missing because, even assuming Plaintiff complained of the alleged age-related harassment to Mason and Kunkel, the decisionmaker, Owen, was not aware of the complaints when she terminated Plaintiff. (Doc. 27 at 20-21 (citing\n   <em>\n    Ambrose\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11433881\" index=\"158\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/303/488/#p493\">\n    303 F.3d at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   493 ).) Defendant points to Plaintiff's undisputed statement that \" 'Mason never reported [Plaintiff's] complaint to HR' \" in support of the assertion that Owen did not know of the complaint so the causal connection is lacking. (Doc. 35 at 13 (quoting PSOF \u00b6 121).) Defendant next argues that Plaintiff's inability to produce I-9 documentation breaks any causal chain between her complaint and her termination. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 21-22 (listing cases).) Plaintiff responds that \"coupled with the obvious fact that Plaintiff complained to Mason earlier in the morning\" on the day she was terminated, Plaintiff asserts that \"there is a dispute of material fact as to whether Owen was the actual or sole decision maker in light of Mason's testimony that she asked for permission to terminate.\" (Doc. 33 at 18 (citing Doc. 33-1 \u00b6\u00b6 118-120).)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-102\">\n   As discussed above, the Court found that Plaintiff did not point to a genuine issue of material fact as to whether Owen was the decisionmaker in that Mason clarified what she meant by \"permission\" and both she and Owen consistently testified that Owen made the decision to terminate rather than suspend Plaintiff.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    supra\n   </em>\n   pp. 437-38. Plaintiff has not shown that Owen did not make the decision to terminate her, and she does not point to evidence indicating that Owen knew of Plaintiff's complaint to Mason. As Defendant points out, Plaintiff says that Mason did not report the complaint she had made to Mason on the morning she was fired to human resources. (Doc. 33-1 \u00b6 121.) Therefore, her conclusory assertion that the issue of causation is for a jury because there is a disputed material fact as to whether Owen was the sole decisionmaker which must be resolved by a jury (Doc. 33 at 18) is insufficient to satisfy her prima facie burden.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-103\">\n   This conclusion does not end the inquiry of whether Plaintiff can show retaliation under the ADEA and PHRA because Plaintiff proceeds to advance her retaliation claims based on a \"cat's paw\" theory of liability which is also known as the \"subordinate bias\" theory.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   (Doc. 33 at 18.)

Whether Mason engaged in activity motivated by retaliatory animus is a separate matter. Plaintiff's argument in support of the cat's paw theory of recovery is somewhat vague and conclusory. However, the Court finds the evidence referenced could support a conclusion by a reasonable factfinder that retaliatory animus was a proximate cause of Plaintiff's termination.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-108\">\n   Assuming that Plaintiff complained to Mason about age-related harassment,\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   evidence shows that Mason called Owen less than two-hours after Plaintiff complained to her. Mason did not share any information about the specifics of Plaintiff's situation with Owen other than informing Owen that Plaintiff did not know when she could get the required documentation. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Doc. 33-11 at 22.) Plaintiff told Mason at the interview about using her maiden name rather than her married name (Doc. 26 \u00b6 17; Doc. 33-1 \u00b6 17), and Plaintiff testified that Mason said that was fine (Doc. 33-1 \u00b6 102). This information combined with Gallert's March 25\n   <sup>\n    th\n   </sup>\n   email (Doc. 26-1 at 112) shows Mason knew that the documentation problem was complicated by Plaintiff's decision to use her maiden name on her application yet this apparently was not discussed by Mason and Owen. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Doc. 33-11 at 22.) Plaintiff testified she told Mason on the morning of her termination about sending the baptism certificate the night before and Mason then said to go to work. (Doc. 33-7 at 24, 92:1-3.) From her conversation with Kunkel the preceding day, Plaintiff understood that the baptism certificate could clear up the documentation problem. (Doc. 33-7 at 19-20, 72:7-73:2.) Mason testified that she told Plaintiff in her second phone call on Thursday that the baptism certificate was not an acceptable form of identification. (Doc. 33-11 at 18.) This evidence shows Mason was aware that Plaintiff had attempted to satisfy the I-9 requirements by submitting her baptism certificate, yet she did not share that information with Owen. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Doc. 33-11 at 22.) Mason knew that Plaintiff had been employed by a company absorbed by Defendant (Doc. 33-11 at 6, 16:9-25), yet she did not mention this to Owen or ask about a record search (\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Doc. 33-11 at 22.) Mason testified that, during her second conversation with Plaintiff on the Thursday of the termination, she asked Plaintiff if she would have her documentation within a week or two weeks \"so we could work something out with her if she gave us some type of time frame to work with, and she didn't. She just said, 'I don't know when she can get them.' So we had no recourse but to terminate her because we had no end date.\" (Doc. 33-11 at 22, 80:2-8.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-109\">\n   Mason also testified that she knew it took about a week to get a copy of a social security card and she agreed that Plaintiff could not know when she would receive the documentation but she said Plaintiff \"could have put forth some effort as to, you know, when she would go to try to obtain the documents and when she would get them\n   She didn't give any of that, so I had nothing to work with other than we don't have the documents.\" (Doc. 33-11 at 22-23, 81:11-82:18.) Though Plaintiff's recollection of the second phone call is vague, she said that if Mason asked her for her birth certificate and she said she did not have it, she would have meant she did not have it with her and would have to look for it. (Doc. 33-7 at 25, 944-9.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-110\">\n   Evidence of \"unusually suggestive\" temporal proximity,\n   <em>\n    LeBoon\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"2922917\" index=\"172\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/503/217/#p232\">\n    503 F.3d at 232\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , between Plaintiff's complaint and Mason's call to Owen coupled with the fact that Mason did nothing to provide potentially relevant information to Owen are sufficient to create a triable issue on whether Mason's withholding of information from Owen was motivated by retaliatory animus. This conclusion is bolstered by evidence that indicates Mason was initially very supportive of Plaintiff's employment with Defendant (\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Doc. 33-7 at 11, 40:17-22) but did nothing to help her after Plaintiff lodged what she contends was an age related complaint on Thursday morning, March 26, 2015. Despite her testimony that she did not discuss suspension rather than termination with Owen because \"that was a government recommendation\" (Doc. 33-11 at 10, 32:24-33:6), Mason knew that exceptions could be made in some circumstances based on the handling of Marchese's medical situation and it could be inferred from her testimony that Plaintiff had given her \"nothing to work with other than we don't have the documents\" (Doc. 33-11 at 23, 82:16-18) that more information could have resulted in a different outcome. These considerations raise questions of credibility regarding Mason's articulated reasons for not discussing alternatives to termination with Owen. Further, Mason's failure to fully apprise Owen of the circumstances of Plaintiff's I-9 problem could be considered suspect because evidence shows that at least some responsibility for Plaintiff's documentation confusion may be attributable to Defendant: Plaintiff told Mason at her interview about using her maiden name instead of her married name (Doc. 26 \u00b6 17; Doc. 33-1 \u00b6 17) and no evidence suggests she was informed of a potential problem related to the decision; Kunkel told Plaintiff on the first day of training to let HR work out the maiden name/married name documentation issue (Doc. 33-1 \u00b6 81); and, on the day before Plaintiff's termination, Kunkel concurred with Plaintiff regarding Plaintiff's plan to send in her baptism certificate and marriage license (Doc. 33-1 \u00b6\u00b6 90-91). While it is not clear what Mason knew about Kunkel's conversations with Plaintiff, minimal investigation on her part and in her role as site supervisor would have revealed that Kunkel's comments to Plaintiff did not help Plaintiff's maiden name/married name compliance problem.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-111\">\n   In terms of the proximate causation required by\n   <em>\n    Staub\n   </em>\n   , the foregoing evidence review shows that a reasonable factfinder could find the required causation in that evidence could support the conclusion there was \"some direct relation\" between Mason's characterization of the documentation problem to Owen (including evidence\n   <em>\n    not\n   </em>\n   revealed to Owen) and Owen's decision to terminate rather than suspend Plaintiff.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Jones\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5768541\" index=\"173\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/796/323/#p330\">\n    796 F.3d at 330-31\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . A reasonable factfinder could conclude that Mason's failure to inform Owen of the circumstances as she knew them at the time she called Owen caused Owen to terminate rather than suspend Plaintiff. As set out above, Mason implicitly acknowledged that more information about the documentation could have resulted in a decision not to terminate. Thus, the Court rejects Defendant's conclusion that no evidence suggests that Mason influenced Owen to make the decision to terminate Plaintiff. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Doc. 35 at 16.) Rather, evidence shows that the question of whether Defendant is liable to Plaintiff for retaliation\n   based on the cat's paw theory of recovery is one for a jury.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-112\">\n   <strong>\n    V.\n    <em>\n     CONCLUSION\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-113\">\n   For the reasons discussed above, Defendant Frontier Communication Corporation's Motion for Summary Judgment (Doc. 25) is denied in part and granted in part.
