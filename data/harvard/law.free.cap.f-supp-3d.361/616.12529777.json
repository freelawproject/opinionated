Rogers has not disputed that Mimms complained to Briggs regarding Rogers' service, but argues only that the complaint was solicited.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 31.

The Court is not persuaded that all of Rogers' arguments regarding pretext create questions of fact; however, viewed in totality and in the light most favorable to him, they are sufficient to create a fact question regarding whether Medline's reasons for terminating him were false and therefore pretextual. Rogers has presented evidence that STAR quota is not mandatory, that Gallarelli and Briggs planned his corrective action plan prior to documenting any customer complaints, and that Medline did not fire him or place him on any form of corrective action for quota\n   numbers significantly lower than his 2015 finish.\n   <footnotemark>\n    8\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-85\">\n   Because Rogers has called into question the truth of Medline's legitimate, nondiscriminatory reasons for his termination, he has done enough to withstand Medline's Motion [55] for Summary Judgment.
