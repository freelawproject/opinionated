HERNANDEZ COVINGTON, UNITED STATES DISTRICT JUDGE\n  </author>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   This matter comes before the Court upon consideration of Defendants Larry Smith, Stat Direct, LLC, and Z Stat Medical, LLC's Motion to Dismiss the United States of America's Complaint in Intervention (Doc. # 76), filed on December 24, 2018. The United States responded on January 25, 2019. (Doc. # 86). For the reasons that follow, the Motion is granted in part and denied in part.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   <strong>\n    I.\n    <em>\n     Background\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   Relators Jennifer Silva and Jessica Robertson initiated this False Claims Act (FCA) action under seal in March of 2015. (Doc. # 1). Relators' Complaint alleged that all Defendants - VICI Marketing, LLC, VICI Marketing Group, LLC, Z Stat Medical, Stat Direct, Anthony Crowe, Vinson Di Santo, Jude Germain, Marjorie Lantum, Medvest LLC, Naveed Naeem, Scott Roix, and Smith - violated the FCA by \"seeking payment at greatly inflated rates for lidocaine\" and \"submitting fraudulent claims for payment to government healthcare programs including Tricare, Medicare and Medicaid.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 1-2).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   Three years later, on August 10, 2018, the United States elected to intervene for the claims against VICI Marketing, VICI Marketing Group, Roix, Z Stat Medical, Stat Direct, and Smith, and filed a Complaint in partial intervention. (Doc. ## 24, 39). The United States has settled its claims against Roix and the VICI Defendants. (Doc. # 38). The United States is now pursuing its claims against Smith, Z Stat Medical, and Stat Direct alone.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   In its Complaint in partial intervention, the United States alleges that Smith, Z Stat Medical, and Stat Direct participated in two kickback schemes.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   <strong>\n    A.\n    <em>\n     Centurion Scheme\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   First, the United States alleges that \"from September 2014 to February 2015, [ ] Smith via [ ] Z Stat Medical ... knowingly submitted and/or caused the submission of claims to TRICARE for reimbursement for compounded drugs that were false or fraudulent because they were tainted by kickbacks to marketers.\" (Doc. # 39 at 2). Z Stat Medical, which does\n   business as Oldsmar Pharmacy, \"is a compounding pharmacy that was owned during the relevant time by [ ] Smith.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 9). Z Stat Medical \"was registered as being managed by Stat Direct\" and \"advertised itself as the specialty compounding division of Stat Direct.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 3).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   According to the Complaint in partial intervention, \"[i]n November 2014, [Z Stat Medical] entered into a kickback arrangement with Centurion Compounding, Inc. [ ] under which [Z Stat Medical] and Centurion agreed to split the profits of TRICARE prescriptions in exchange for referrals.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 9). \"Centurion ... engage[d] sales representatives as independent contractors to market expensive compounded medications, specifically creams for pain and scars, among others, to beneficiaries of healthcare plans, especially TRICARE.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 10-11). \"Centurion continued to direct [both] the patients that Centurion sales representatives had recruited and the physicians in their network to send all of their compounded cream prescriptions to Centurion, which then transmitted them to [Z Stat Medical] to fill.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   \"Smith and other employees of [Z Stat Medical] negotiated with Anderson, co-owner of Centurion, the commission that [Z Stat Medical] would pay to Centurion per prescription that Centurion referred to [Z Stat Medical].\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 11). They ultimately agreed that Z Stat Medical would take fifteen percent of the profits off the top, and then the remaining eighty-five percent of the profits would be split 50-50 between Z Stat Medical and Centurion. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   Z Stat Medical and Centurion maintained \"commission reports\" - spreadsheets listing \"all of the prescriptions generated by Centurion, the amounts received by [Z Stat Medical] for claims that the pharmacy submitted to the patients' insurance for reimbursement, and the amounts owed in commission, thereby documenting the kickback arrangement.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ). \"[T]he commission report for December 1, 2014 through December 15, 2014 identified over $9,700,000 received by [Z Stat Medical] and over $3,500,000 in commissions owed to Centurion.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   \"[T]he vast majority of prescriptions from federal beneficiaries were submitted to TRICARE.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ). From November 2014 to February 2015, Z Stat Medical submitted over 4,000 claims to TRICARE \"for compounded prescriptions that Centurion arranged for [Z Stat Medical] to fill in exchange for commissions on each prescription.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 12). \"TRICARE paid approximately $18,000,000 for those prescriptions.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   During this kickback scheme, Z Stat Medical and Centurion \"sought the assistance of attorneys to try to create a legally permissible arrangement whereby the relationship between Centurion and [Z Stat Medical] could continue and the individual marketers could be compensated on a commission basis.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ). Although they never reached such an arrangement, the kickbacks continued. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   In total, Z Stat Medical paid over $6,000,000 in commissions to Centurion from November 2014 to February 2015. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ). \"Centurion then disbursed to its independent contractor sales representatives their share of the commissions for the prescriptions they generated.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ). \"The only work the Centurion marketers performed in exchange for the commissions was to generate prescriptions that went to [Z Stat Medical].\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 13). Because the marketers were independent contractors, Z Stat Medical \"did not control how the marketers generated the prescriptions that were sent to the pharmacy and did not supervise the marketers.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ). \"Smith, President of [Z Stat Medical], knew that the money paid to Centurion was used to pay commissions to the marketers,\n   who were not employees of [Z Stat Medical] or Centurion.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 12).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   \"The United States executed a search warrant on [Z Stat Medical] and others on February 10, 2015. On February 13, 2015, [the Defense Health Agency] sent a letter to Smith suspending payments for present and future claims from [Z Stat Medical].\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 13).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   <strong>\n    B.\n    <em>\n     Roix Scheme\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   Smith and Z Stat Medical allegedly entered a separate kickback agreement with Roix, whereby Roix's companies would send prescriptions to Z Stat Medical. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ). \"Companies associated with Roix, including Health Saving Solutions, would publish online advertisements offering free consultations for pain creams. Customers would call the number listed in the advertisement and speak with telemarketers at Vici Marketing, a call center company owned by Roix.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   Customers with insurance that would cover compounded medicines would be connected to a telemedicine company, and the doctor would prescribe compounded medications without seeing the customers. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 14). \"The resulting prescription would go to one of Roix's companies, who would then send the prescription to [Z Stat Medical] to fill.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   \"[Z Stat Medical] would submit a claim for reimbursement to private payors and federal health care programs and then include the amount of the reimbursement in the next commission payment to Health Saving Solutions.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ). \"The amount paid by [Z Stat Medical] to Health Saving Solutions was approximately 41 percent of the revenue for each prescription.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   In September 2014, Smith - on behalf of his company Direct Telemedicine Resources, Inc. - entered into an alleged sham agreement with Roix on behalf of Health Saving Solutions. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ). Under the agreement, \"Smith's company agreed to compensate Roix's company in the amount of $5.5 million for services performed from September 1, 2014 to February 28, 2015,\" and the agreement stated this amount was not based on the value of the business generated by Z Stat Medical. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 15).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   In fact, however, \"[Z Stat Medical's] payments to Health Saving Solutions were based on the value of business generated by [Z Stat Medical].\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ). The parties violated other provisions of the agreement as well, including that (i) the parties would comply with federal laws (such as anti-kickback laws) and refrain from soliciting any federal health care program beneficiaries, and (ii) Health Saving Solutions would provide monthly reports of its legal marketing efforts. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 15). \"The parties to the agreement used a spreadsheet to keep track of prescriptions, the amount received for each prescription, and the commission owed to Health Saving Solutions per prescription.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 15-16).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   \"From September 2014 to February 2015, [Z Stat Medical] submitted approximately 700 prescriptions to TRICARE for compounded prescriptions that Health Saving Solutions arranged for [Z Stat Medical] to fill in exchange for a commission on each prescription.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 16). \"TRICARE paid approximately $3.4 million for the prescriptions.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   \"The only work Health Saving Solutions performed in exchange for the commissions was to generate reimbursable prescriptions for [Z Stat Medical] to fill.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ). Because they were independent contractors, \"Health Saving Solutions and Vici Marketing were not given specific work assignments by [Z Stat Medical],\" and Z Stat Medical \"did not control how the companies generated the prescriptions that were sent to the pharmacy and did not supervise the marketers.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   <strong>\n    C.\n    <em>\n     Additional Allegations\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   \"[Z Stat Medical], with the assistance of the marketing companies, rather than the prescribing doctors, designed the compounds to maximize profits on each prescription.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 17). \"Almost all of the patients who received compounded medication received pain cream or scar cream that had the highest rates of reimbursement.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ). \"[Z Stat Medical] designed prescription pads that Centurion and the sales representatives provided to patients to give to doctors that included compound medications that would be reimbursed.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   Smith allegedly \"would discuss with Centurion the prescriptions that they should encourage doctors to prescribe because of the amount that insurance paid for them\" and \"provided advice ... on how to encourage doctors to complete the prescriptions pads to increase the likelihood and the amount of reimbursement.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 18). \"[T]he doctors were encouraged to sign prescriptions with unlimited refills in order to maximize revenue for [Z Stat Medical] and the marketers.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ). Also, Z Stat Medical \"sometimes waived co-payments for prescriptions, in violation of TRICARE regulations and its own policies, in order to encourage patients to continue accepting medications, including when patients expressed they did not want or need them.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   According to the Complaint in partial intervention, \"Smith had conducted his own independent research into the anti-kickback laws.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 19). \"Specifically, Smith was aware that no pharmacy could pay a commission per prescription to any marketing firm in connection with government funded insurance claims because it was illegal.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ). Smith allegedly \"also understood this to be a norm in the pharmacy industry.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ). And Smith, Z Stat Medical, and Stat Direct \"knew that compliance with the [Anti-Kickback Statute] was a material requirement for receiving TRICARE reimbursement.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 20).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   \"Only after the United States executed a search warrant that notified [Z Stat Medical] that the Government was aware of its improper conduct, [Z Stat Medical] paid more than $19 million to [the company that administers prescription drug coverage for TRICARE], which included all amounts received for claims submitted in connection with Centurion.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 21). Z Stat Medical \"also reversed approximately $40 million in pending claims before they could be paid by TRICARE.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 22).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   The United States additionally includes specific information about three false claims submitted by Z Stat Medical. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 21-22).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   Smith, Z Stat Medical, and Stat Direct now move to dismiss the Complaint in partial intervention (Doc. # 76) as a shotgun complaint, for failure to plead fraud with particularity under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 9(b), and for failure to state a claim for violation of the FCA under Rule 12(b)(6). The United States has responded (Doc. # 86), and the Motion is now ripe for review.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   <strong>\n    II.\n    <em>\n     Legal Standard\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   On a motion to dismiss, this Court accepts as true all the allegations in the complaint and construes them in the light most favorable to the plaintiff.\n   <em>\n    Jackson v.

According to them, \"[t]he United States failed to particularly describe (or even allege) how [ ] Smith submitted a false claim.

They insist that \"the allegations in the Complaint contradict any argument that [ ] Smith would have knowingly submitted a false claim\" because he had consulted with attorneys to draft agreements that would not violate federal law and actually entered a referral agreement promising that neither Smith's companies nor Roix's companies would violate federal law. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 7).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-56\">\n   The Court disagrees and finds that the United States has pled Smith's role in the kickback schemes with particularity. The United States is correct that Smith can be held liable under the FCA if he caused the submission of false claims, even if he did not submit the claims himself. (Doc. # 86 at 12-13);\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    United States v.

The Complaint in partial intervention alleges with particularity how Smith caused false claims to be submitted to TRICARE - specifically, he allegedly negotiated the kickback schemes with Roix and Centurion. (Doc. # 39 at 11, 14). Smith also allegedly spoke with the marketers about what prescriptions should be issued to maximize the reimbursement rates from TRICARE. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 18).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-57\">\n   Furthermore, scienter can be alleged generally.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Urquilla-Diaz\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4073220\" index=\"24\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/780/1039/#p1052\">\n    780 F.3d at 1051\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (\" Rule 9(b) provides that a party alleging fraud 'must state with particularity\n   the circumstances constituting fraud' but may allege scienter generally.\"). And the United States' allegations regarding Smith's scienter - that he knowingly entered the kickback schemes and knew kickbacks are illegal - are sufficient at this stage. The United States has clearly alleged that Smith knew that paying commissions per prescription to marketers regarding government-funded claims was illegal because of his research into anti-kickback statutes and his experience in the healthcare industry. (Doc. # 39 at 19).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-58\">\n   Accepting all the allegations as true and drawing reasonable inferences in the United States' favor, the Court can easily conclude that Smith's actions do not contradict the allegation that Smith knew his kickback arrangements were unlawful. The United States alleged that the agreement with Roix was a sham that no party ever intended to follow and that the alleged kickback scheme with Centurion continued unabated even while Smith consulted with lawyers without success about crafting a legal referral arrangement. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 12, 14).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-59\">\n   As for the claim that Z Stat Medical violated the FCA, Smith, Z Stat Medical, and Stat Direct argue the claim should be dismissed because all Defendants are lumped together, making \"it [ ] impossible to determine what allegations specifically relate to\" Z Stat Medical. (Doc. # 76 at 9). And they contend that, \"[b]y self-reporting and repaying TRICARE plus interest, [Z Stat Medical] cannot be liable for a violation of the FCA.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 10).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-60\">\n   Where the pertinent allegations of fraud lump all defendants together without specific assertions about a defendant's conduct, Rule 9(b) requires dismissal of that defendant.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Ambrosia Coal &amp; Const.

But the United States has also pled with particularity actions that Z Stat Medical specifically undertook in violation of the FCA. For example, the United States alleges that Z Stat Medical submitted thousands of false claims to TRICARE under the kickback schemes with both Centurion and Roix and then paid millions in kickback commissions to those marketers. (Doc. # 39 at 12, 16). The Complaint in partial intervention also describes how Z Stat Medical maintained spreadsheets outlining the kickbacks due under each kickback scheme. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 11, 15-16). The United States pled the dates and amounts of various kickback payments paid through Z Stat Medical and the details of some representative false claims. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 16, 21). Thus, there are sufficient allegations about Z Stat Medical individually to support the FCA claim.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-62\">\n   The Court acknowledges that Z Stat Medical returned $19 million to TRICARE for moneys it received through its kickback scheme with Centurion. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 21). But that does not absolve Z Stat Medical of liability under the FCA for its submission of false claims in the first place, and Z Stat Medical has not cited to any case law to that effect. The FCA allows for treble damages,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"26\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=31%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%203729\">\n    31 U.S.C. \u00a7 3729\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a)(1), so Z Stat Medical is still potentially liable for significant damages. If Z Stat Medical is ultimately found liable, the Court will deduct the amount already paid to the United States from the trebled damages when the case concludes.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    United States v.

Fla. 1990) (stating that damages under the FCA should be tripled before any deductions for prior recoveries by the United States).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-63\">\n   Finally, Smith, Z Stat Medical, and Stat Direct argue that the United States has failed to state a claim with particularity against Stat Direct. (Doc. # 76 at 8-9). They note that the only allegations about Stat Direct specifically are \"the ones that describe the parties\" and that \"the United States simply lumps Stat Direct into the defined term 'Defendants,' and provides no particularity as to how Stat Direct violated the FCA.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ). Thus, they reason, the United States has failed to allege the who, what, where, when, and why of a false claim submitted by Stat Direct.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-64\">\n   Again, dismissal of an FCA claim is proper under Rule 9(b) when a complaint is \"devoid of specific allegations with respect to each defendant\" and \"lump[s] together all of the defendants in [its] allegations of fraud.\"\n   <em>\n    Ambrosia Coal &amp; Const.
