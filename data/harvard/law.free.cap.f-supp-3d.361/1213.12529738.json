Suffering offense from truly insulting conduct is sometimes an unfortunate fact of life, so the law understandably hesitates to impose money damages for causing emotional distress in the minds of others. But, in very limited circumstances, the law recognizes extremely egregious conduct that no person should be expected to endure without some sort of civil justice. This case plausibly presents such outrageous conduct.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   Twelve years after Natalee Holloway disappeared while on a high school trip to Aruba in 2005, Defendants Oxygen Media and Brian Graden Media tried to capitalize on the world's fascination with the tragedy. Defendants produced and published what they termed a six-part \"true crime documentary\" series entitled \"The Disappearance of Natalee Holloway.\" The series documented a so-called \"unscripted\" and \"real-time investigation\" of what happened to Natalee when she disappeared.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   But Natalee's mother, Plaintiff Beth Holloway, alleges that the series was not a \"true-crime documentary\" or a legitimate \"investigation\" whatsoever. Instead, Ms. Holloway contends that it was scripted and outrageous fiction produced and published at the expense of her severe emotional distress. In addition, she alleges that Defendants fraudulently procured her DNA in production of the series.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   Defendants have filed a motion to dismiss Ms. Holloway's claims for fraud and the tort of outrage. The court will DENY the motion. As further explained below, Ms. Holloway has pled with particularity the fraudulent procurement of her DNA by plausible agents of Defendants. And she has sufficiently alleged facts showing a plausible claim for the tort of outrage.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   <strong>\n    I.

FACTUAL BACKGROUND\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   As the court must do on a motion to dismiss, the court accepts as true the following well-pled factual allegations.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   Natalee Holloway disappeared on May 30, 2005 while on a high school senior class trip in Aruba. Print and broadcast media gave Natalee's disappearance \"nearly unprecedented\" and \"round-the-clock\" coverage. (Doc. 23 at \u00b6 45). Natalee's mother, Beth Holloway, has worked tirelessly to find Natalee, but neither Natalee nor her remains have ever been located.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   <strong>\n    A.\n    <em>\n     The Series\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   Defendants produced and published a six-part television series entitled \"The Disappearance of Natalee Holloway\" (the \"Series\"). The Series aired between August 19, 2017 and September 23, 2017. Defendants marketed the Series as an \" 'unscripted' 'real-time investigation' and 'documentary' following 'a new lead that could deliver justice for Natalee once and for all,' including 'the specifics of what happened to her and the remains of her body.' \" (Doc. 23 at \u00b6 57).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   The Series followed Natalee's father and Beth Holloway's ex-husband, Dave Holloway, and his private investigator, T.J. Ward, as they investigated John Ludwick, the suspect who claimed to have exhumed and desecrated Natalee's remains in Aruba and asserted that he knew where Natalee's remains were buried.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   Ms. Holloway alleges that the Series and the \"real-time\" events that it depicted were actually scripted. She relies on the complaint in the matter styled\n   <em>\n    Kramer v. Brian Graden Media, LLC, et al.\n   </em>\n   , Case No. 2:17-cv-5990 (C.D. Cal. Aug. 11, 2017), where the plaintiff, Edward Kramer, sought compensation for services he alleges that he rendered to Oxygen and BGM for the Series. (Doc. 23 at \u00b6 62). Mr. Kramer asserted in that case that he created the Series as early as the fall of 2014. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 69). Mr. Kramer alleged that he created the plot, plans, scenarios, episode guides, and resolution for the Series; that is, he \"scripted\" the Series beforehand. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 64). In addition, Mr. Kramer alleged that the main characters in the series, even those depicted in the Series as unaware that they were being filmed, were paid participants. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6\u00b6 70, 74, 76, 79-80).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   As depicted in the Series, on March 19, 2017, Mr. Ludwick took his roommate, Gabriel Madrigal, to identify the grave site in Aruba where Mr. Ludwick claimed to have\n   dug up Natalee's remains. But Mr. Ludwick could not find the grave site. (Doc. 23 at \u00b6\u00b6 86-87).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   Then, on April 6, 2017, Mr. Madrigal told Mr. Holloway and Mr. Ward that Mr. Ludwick would travel to Aruba again \"to pinpoint the exact location and cooperate with the Aruban authorities in showing the exact location [of Natalee's remains] and hopefully solving the case.\" (Doc. 23 at \u00b6 90). But on Mr. Ludwick's second trip to Aruba, he again could not find the grave site. In addition, Mr. Ludwick could not identify the cave near his aunt's property where he claimed that he and another man burned Natalee's skull. Defendants then cut ties with Mr. Ludwick \"because they believed the lead to have been false and unfounded.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 94).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   But the Series then depicts a third visit to Aruba, this time filmed on Mr. Madrigal's cell phone and purportedly undertaken without Defendants' knowledge. Mr. Madrigal and Mr. Ludwick stated on the cell phone videos that they \"returned to Aruba for a third time to 'bring Natalee home' and because Ludwick knew where her remains are because 'he kept [them] as a trophy.' \" (Doc. 23 at \u00b6 96).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   During this third search, within seconds of the men's arrival at Mr. Ludwick's aunt's house, Mr. Ludwick uncovered a Ziploc bag \"from just beneath the ground surface\" containing four bone fragments. (Doc. 23 at \u00b6 100). According to Ms. Holloway, \"[t]he Ziploc bag, supposedly buried for seven years, appears fairly new, clean, and in good condition.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 101).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   The Series then shows more footage from Mr. Madrigal's cell phone on which Mr. Ludwick fails to identify the grave site with the rest of Natalee's remains. (Doc. 23 at \u00b6\u00b6 104-05).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   <strong>\n    B.\n    <em>\n     The Bone Fragments and Ms. Holloway's DNA\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   Mr. Holloway and Mr. Ward traveled to Aruba to collect the bone fragments. Aruban authorities advised the men that the bones were animal remains. (Doc. 23 at \u00b6 5).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   Defendants then delivered the bone fragments to their forensic expert, Dr. Jason Kolowski. Defendants told Dr. Kolowski that Mr. Ward recovered the bone fragments from a pet cemetery. Defendants did not disclose that Mr. Ludwick found the bones in a Ziploc bag without any corroboration. Dr. Kolowski later told Ms. Holloway that Defendants did not inform him of the true origin of the bones because he could have been \"burned\" professionally by testing bone samples contaminated by Mr. Ludwick. (Doc. 23 at \u00b6 14).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   Dr. Kolowski first tested the bone fragments for nuclear DNA, the presence of which would establish that the bones were human and from which Dr. Kolowski could identify the person to whom the remains belonged. The test came back negative. (Doc. 23 at \u00b6 12).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   Dr. Kolowski then tested the bone fragments for mitochondrial DNA, which all living beings possess. At best, because mitochondrial DNA cannot uniquely identify one person, the test would allow Dr. Kolowski to \"exclude the Bone Fragments as belonging to Natalee or determine that the bones belonged to an individual with a mitochondrial DNA sequence similar to Natalee's, a sequence that is presumably shared very widely amongst humankind.\" (Doc. 23 at \u00b6 5). The test revealed the\n   <em>\n    presence\n   </em>\n   of human mitochondrial DNA belonging to a Caucasian individual; it did not reveal that the bones themselves were human bones.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   According to Ms. Holloway, the presence of human mitochondrial DNA \"is not at all surprising-and may even be expected-given that the Bone Fragments were handled and likely contaminated by Mr. Ludwick, a Caucasian and a heroin addict.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 13). Defendants did not perform a speciation test or submit the bones to an anthropologist to determine whether the bone fragments were human bones.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   On August 10, 2017, Mr. Holloway called Ms. Holloway privately and advised her that \"human female remains,\" at least ten years old and from a single Caucasian individual, were discovered at a \"grave site\" in Aruba. (Doc. 23 at \u00b6\u00b6 6-7, 112). Mr. Holloway asked Ms. Holloway for a DNA sample. The same day, Dr. Kolowski told Ms. Holloway that the DNA test would either match the bone fragments to Natalee or fully exclude that the bones belonged to Natalee. Ms. Holloway provided a sample of her DNA two days later.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   Neither Mr. Holloway nor Dr. Kolowski informed Ms. Holloway of the true origin of the bones or the circumstances of their discovery. The men did not tell her that Dr. Kolowski had not determined that the bones were human or female; that Defendants would use her DNA for the Series; that the Series existed at all; that Dr. Kolowski could not match the bones to Natalee even with Ms. Holloway's DNA; or that Mr. Ludwick, who was Caucasian and a paid participant in the Series, recovered the bone fragments from a Ziploc bag only after Defendants stopped filming him and after twice failing to locate the bone fragments. (Doc. 23 at \u00b6\u00b6 7, 118, 128).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   The Series then turned all of its attention to the bone fragments and DNA testing. The Series depicted a staged meeting between Mr. Holloway, Mr. Ward, and Dr. Kolowski held on August 17, 2017. Defendants conveyed this scene as the first time that Mr. Holloway and Mr. Ward learned the results of Dr. Kolowski's initial DNA testing, but Mr. Holloway had already informed Ms. Holloway of the results one week before the meeting. Also in this scene, Defendants conveyed that some or all of the bone fragments were human, that the bone fragments belonged to a Caucasian of European descent, and that Ms. Holloway's DNA could definitively determine whether the bone fragments belonged to Natalee. (Doc. 23 at \u00b6\u00b6 122-27).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   On September 22, 2017, Defendants received a laboratory report that the results of the DNA tests were not reportable. (Doc. 23 at \u00b6 135).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   Defendants aired the Series finale on September 23, 2017. The episode shows a meeting between Mr. Holloway, Mr. Ward, and Dr. Kolowski on September 11, 2017. In the scene, Defendants convey that they were expecting a match, inconclusive results, or a full exclusion with the DNA test. The episode ends without divulging the results of the DNA test. (Doc. 23 at \u00b6 134).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   All along, the bone fragments came from the skull of a wild boar. Mr. Ludwick admitted to Mr. Madrigal that he planted the bones. (Doc. 23 at \u00b6\u00b6 8-9).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   <strong>\n    C.\n    <em>\n     The Articles\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   Between August 16 and September 21, 2017, Oxygen published seven articles about the Series on Oxygen.com to generate hype for the Series.

(Doc. 23). In her amended complaint, she brings one count of fraud and one count of outrage against both Defendants. She alleges that Defendants committed fraud when Mr. Holloway and Dr. Kolowski, acting as agents for Defendants, procured her DNA under false pretenses.

(Doc. 26). In their motion to dismiss, Defendants assert that Ms. Holloway failed to plead fraud with particularity as required by Rule 9(b) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, that she failed to allege facts showing intentional, reckless, extreme, or outrageous conduct to state a claim for the tort of outrage under Alabama law, and that the First Amendment protects Defendants' publications from tort liability.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-54\">\n   The court will address both of Ms. Holloway's claims, and, in doing so, will find that she has stated a plausible claim for relief as to both claims and that the First Amendment does not protect Defendants' publications.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-55\">\n   <strong>\n    III.

She alleges that Mr. Holloway and Dr. Kolowski, acting as agents of Defendants, falsely represented to her that Mr. Holloway and Mr. Ward had found human female remains at a grave site in Aruba that belonged to a female, and that they needed Ms. Holloway's DNA to determine if the bones matched Natalee's DNA. (Doc. 23 at \u00b6\u00b6 11-16, 139, 141, 143, 152-54). The location of Natalee's remains was a material fact to Ms. Holloway. Ms. Holloway reasonably relied on the representations because they came from her ex-husband and Natalee's father who had also been searching for Natalee ever since she disappeared. And Ms. Holloway alleges that she suffered severe emotional distress and corresponding physical distress because of the false representations, so she has alleged each of the four elements of her fraud claim. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6\u00b6 196, 198).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-61\">\n   And she has pled fraud with particularity as required by Rule 9(b). She alleges precisely who made the statements: Mr. Holloway and Dr. Kolowski, acting as agents of Defendants. She alleges precisely when Mr. Holloway and Dr. Kolowski made the statements: August 10, 2017, on the phone. She alleges precisely what Mr. Holloway and Dr. Kolowski said: Mr. Holloway told her that he and Mr. Ward found human female remains at a grave site in Aruba and needed her DNA, and Dr. Kolowski told her that a DNA test could match the bones to Natalee's DNA. But in truth, Mr. Ludwick and Mr. Madrigal, not Mr. Holloway and Mr. Ward, found the bones; the men found the bones at Mr. Ludwick's aunt's house, not a grave site; nobody knew that the bones belonged to a female; and they could only make an \"exclusion\" with Ms. Holloway's DNA, not a \"match.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-62\">\n   In addition, she alleges precisely how Mr. Holloway misled her. She alleges that Mr. Holloway concealed several material facts: (1) that Defendants were filming a show that would broadcast the DNA test results (doc. 23 at \u00b6\u00b6 118, 156, 160-61, 183); (2) that Mr. Ludwick was a paid participant and a heroin addict who failed to uncover the purported grave site on two prior occasions (\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6\u00b6 86-87, 90-93, 177, 182, 235); (3) that Mr. Ludwick found the bone fragments only after Defendants had stopped filming him (\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6\u00b6 95-101, 178-82); and (4) that Mr. Ludwick discovered the bones in a Ziploc bag that appeared new (\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 98-101, 175). These specific allegations satisfy the heightened Rule 9(b) pleading standard.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-63\">\n   Defendants make two unpersuasive arguments for why Ms. Holloway has failed to plead fraud with particularity. First, Defendants contend that Ms. Holloway has failed to \"plead sufficient facts to 'inform each defendant of the nature of [its] alleged participation in the fraud' \" as required to state a fraud claim against multiple defendants.\n   <em>\n    Transatlantic, LLC v.

And she alleges that Defendants knew or should have known that several statements in the Series were false. For example, she alleges that the Series provided several gruesome descriptions of Natalee's murder and the desecration of her remains, but Defendants should have known that the descriptions were false because Mr. Ludwick, the only source of Defendants' information, failed to recover Natalee's remains on numerous occasions, recovered pig bones from an apparently new Ziploc bag only after Defendants stopped filming him, was a heroin addict, and failed to corroborate any of his claims.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-75\">\n   From these factual allegations, the court can infer that Defendants, at the very least, acted with reckless disregard for the truth by procuring Ms. Holloway's DNA and publishing the Series.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-76\">\n   <em>\n    2.

But, given Alabama law's heightened concern with human remains and loved ones' connection with the deceased, and given the egregious nature of Defendants' conduct as alleged by Ms. Holloway, the court cannot say at the motion to dismiss stage that Defendants' conduct was not\n   <em>\n    plausibly\n   </em>\n   extreme and outrageous that caused Ms. Holloway emotional distress so severe that no reasonable person could be expected to endure it.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-83\">\n   Ms. Holloway alleges that Mr. Holloway gave her a false glimmer of hope after twelve years of searching for her daughter's remains. He called her and told her that \"human female remains\" were discovered at a \"grave site\" in Aruba and that they could determine whether the bones matched Natalee if Ms. Holloway provided a DNA sample. But Mr. Holloway concealed the truth that no meaningful chance existed that the remains belonged to Natalee and that Defendants had a financial motivation to procure her DNA.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-84\">\n   In particular, Mr. Holloway did not tell Ms. Holloway that Mr. Ludwick, a paid participant in an allegedly scripted television series, found the bones after twice failing to uncover Natalee's remains after claiming to know of their location, and only found the bones that the Aruban authorities described as animal bones at his aunt's house in an apparently new Ziploc bag after Defendants stopped filming him. Mr. Holloway also falsely claimed that the bones were from a female and hid that the DNA found on the bones could likely have come from Mr. Ludwick after he \"discovered\" them. And then Dr. Kolowski added to Ms. Holloway's false hope by telling her that her DNA could match the bones to Natalee's DNA, even though Ms. Holloway's DNA could only exclude the bones as belonging to Natalee.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-85\">\n   Ms. Holloway thus alleges facts that show Defendants essentially took advantage of her grief and tireless efforts to find her daughter's remains by baiting her with false hope for the benefit of a television series. Such conduct is plausibly extreme and outrageous and so severe that no reasonable person could be expected to endure it under Alabama law.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-86\">\n   And Defendants also plausibly undertook extreme and outrageous conduct by\n   publishing the Series. Ms. Holloway has alleged facts showing that Defendants subjected Ms. Holloway to a sham that took advantage of her grief and her daughter's disappearance week by week. She alleges that the Series was scripted and thus designed to capitalize on viewers' fascination with Natalee's disappearance and followed leads that Defendants knew or should have known were bogus. The Series-a supposedly \"true crime documentary\" and \"real-time investigation\"-presented several gruesome descriptions of Natalee's murder and the desecration of her body as credible information. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Doc. 23 at \u00b6 227). But, in reality, Defendants had more than enough reasons to doubt the veracity of Mr. Ludwick's claims, much less make him the main character of a \"true crime documentary.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-87\">\n   Of course, the First Amendment's guarantee of freedom of speech and freedom of the press protects Defendants' publications from tort liability, but that protection is not absolute.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Hustler Magazine, Inc. v.

The media gave her daughter's disappearance \"nearly unprecedented media coverage with round-the-clock coverage of the investigation.\" (Doc. 23 at \u00b6 45). Ms. Holloway worked with several public officials, including presidents, senators, and governors, and \"the media, celebrities, and countless others in her ongoing efforts to find Natalee.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 47). She published a book about Natalee's disappearance and the aftermath. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 21). Ms. Holloway describes herself as \"that desperate mother on TV holding up pictures of her missing child, pleading for help, describing the details surrounding an unthinkable crime ... living an endless nightmare in front of the whole world.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ). These allegations show that Ms. Holloway is a public figure for purposes of her outrage claim.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Holloway v. Am.

She first alleges that Defendants made several false statements of fact in the Series, particularly descriptions of the murder of Natalee, the location and desecration of her remains, that Defendants discovered human remains, and that Defendants could match the bone fragments to Natalee. (Doc. 23 at \u00b6\u00b6 227, 259-60). These statements are false because the location of Natalee's remains and the manner in which Natalee died, if she died, is unknown. And Defendants did not, in fact, discover human remains and never received test results showing that the bones were human. Further, Defendants could never match the bone fragments to Natalee with Ms. Holloway's DNA.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-90\">\n   And Ms. Holloway has alleged several facts showing that Defendants plausibly acted with intentional or, at least, reckless disregard for the truth of the statements they made in the Series. She alleges that the Aruban authorities informed Defendants that the bones in Aruba were animal bones; that Defendants should have known that Mr. Ludwick, their primary source,\n   lacked any credibility because his story changed significantly during the course of the Series and he failed to locate the remains on several occasions; that Mr. Ludwick almost immediately found the bones in a Ziploc bag when he returned to his aunt's house without corroboration; that Defendants should have known that Mr. Ludwick was highly unlikely to incriminate himself in criminal activity; that Defendants themselves harbored serious doubts as to the truth of the information they published; that Defendants failed to conduct a reasonable investigation into Mr. Ludwick's claims; that Defendants published episodes before receiving the DNA test results so they could market the Series as discovering Natalee's remains; and that Defendants delayed the DNA test results so they could publish the Series with plausible deniability as to the results at the time of publication. (Doc. 23 at \u00b6\u00b6 277, 284-90, 294-99). And, at all times, Defendants marketed the allegedly scripted series as an unscripted true-crime documentary.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-91\">\n   From these allegations, the court may infer that Defendants either knew that they were publishing false claims in the Series or purposefully hid themselves from the obvious falsity of the claims, and thus plausibly acted with actual malice to avoid the First Amendment's protections.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-92\">\n   So, as she does with Defendants' private conduct, Ms. Holloway states a plausible claim for the tort of outrage as to Defendants' publications.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-93\">\n   <strong>\n    IV. CONCLUSION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-94\">\n   By separate order, the court will\n   <strong>\n    DENY\n   </strong>\n   Defendants' motion to dismiss.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-95\">\n   <strong>\n    DONE\n   </strong>\n   and\n   <strong>\n    ORDERED\n   </strong>\n   this 7th day of January, 2019.\n  </p>\n </opinion>\n</casebody>\n"
