The court repeats certain facts and aspects of the procedural history here as necessary to introduce and to decide the instant motion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   <strong>\n    A. Factual Overview\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   The MPs are retail merchants that have each entered into an American Express Card Acceptance Agreement (the \"Agreement\") with Amex. (Am. Compl. \u00b6 1.) In those Agreements, \"and in virtually every other such Agreement that Amex has entered into with a merchant,\" Amex has included the NDPs, which prevent the merchant \"from differentially pricing the use of payment cards, stating a preference for any form of payment, or allowing the retail customer to use different payment cards on differing terms or conditions established by the merchant.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ;\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 2-3 (describing the NDPs).) The MPs claim that these restraints are anticompetitive \"because they nullify the operation of the price mechanism, impede competition among credit card networks and suppress output.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 4;\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 4-6.) As a result, the MPs allege, \"merchant fees and the net two-sided transaction price for Amex and other credit card networks are higher than the competitive level and higher than they otherwise would be in the absence of Amex's anticompetitive restraints [and] the number of credit card transactions is lower than it otherwise would be in the absence of the Amex restraints.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 7.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   The MPs allege that the NDPs \"have had an actual adverse effect on competition as a whole ... in that they have reduced output, quality and consumer choice and increased price and barriers to entry in each of the relevant markets and/or submarkets.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 53.) The MPs seek to proceed to trial with respect to four formulations of the relevant market:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-23\">\n   1. a one-sided, all-general purpose credit card (\"GPCC\") market;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-24\">\n   2. a one-sided, Amex-only market;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-25\">\n   3. a two-sided, all-GPCC market; and\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-26\">\n   4. a two-sided, Amex-only market.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 11,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 56-57, 64.) The MPs assert claims under each cause of action with respect to all four formulations of the relevant market and submarket. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 68-85.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   <strong>\n    B. Procedural History\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   In 2008, certain of the MPs brought suit against Amex in this court.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    In re Amex\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"7\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2016%20WL%20748089\">\n    2016 WL 748089\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *2 &amp; n.3. As stated above, the MPs allege that the anti-steering rules Amex imposes on merchants that participate in its network are an anticompetitive restraint on trade in violation of the Sherman Act.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Rite Aid Corp. v. Am. Exp. Travel Related Servs. Co.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4011780\" index=\"8\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-2d/708/257/#p261\">\n    708 F.Supp.2d 257\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 261-62 (E.D.N.Y. 2010). After\n   answering each MP's complaint, Amex moved for judgment on the pleadings, arguing that all of the MPs' claims were barred by the Sherman Act's four-year statute of limitations, On March 3, 2010, the court denied the motion.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4011780\" index=\"9\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-2d/708/257/#p261\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   at 264 ;\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    In re Amex\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"10\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2016%20WL%20748089\">\n    2016 WL 748089\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *2.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   Meanwhile, in October 2010, the Department of Justice and the attorneys general of eighteen states filed suit against Amex, MasterCard, and Visa (the \"Government Action\").\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   The MP Actions and the Government Action proceeded to coordinated discovery. In late 2013, Amex moved for summary judgment in both the Government Action and the MP Actions, and moved to consolidate the actions for trial. The court denied Amex's motion for summary judgment in the Government Action in May 2014.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    United States v. Am. Exp. Co.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4272785\" index=\"11\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/21/187/\">\n    21 F.Supp.3d 187\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (E.D.N.Y. 2014). Separately, the court denied Amex's motion to consolidate the actions for the purpose of trial (Feb. 11, 2014, Order (Dkt. 335) ), and stayed the MP Actions during the pendency of a motion for final settlement approval in consolidated class actions that comprise part of the MDL and in which the MPs are putative class members (\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Apr. 9, 2014, Order). The court reserved judgment on Amex's motion for summary judgment in the MP Actions.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   The Government Action proceeded to a bench trial during the summer of 2014. On February 19, 2015, the court found by a preponderance of the evidence that the specific NDPs challenged by the Government violate Section 1 of the Sherman Act. After receiving additional briefing from the parties to the Government Action, as well as other interested parties including the MPs, the court issued a permanent injunction on April 30, 2015.\n   <em>\n    United States. v. Am. Exp.

The court denied Amex's motion to stay the permanent injunction pending appeal.\n   <em>\n    United States v. Am. Exp. Co.\n   </em>\n   , No. 10-CV-4496 (NGG),\n   <extracted-citation index=\"15\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2015%20WL%2013735045\">\n    2015 WL 13735045\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (E.D.N.Y. May 19, 2015). Amex then filed a notice of appeal and sought a stay pending appeal from the Second Circuit. Although a three-judge panel of the Second Circuit initially denied Amex's motion to stay (Order of USCA (Dkt. 687 in No. 10-CV-4496) ), the Second Circuit ultimately entered a temporary stay of the permanent injunction and a temporary stay of the Government Action in this court (Order of USCA (Dkt. 697 in No. 10-CV-4496) ).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   On September 26, 2016, the Second Circuit reversed this court's judgment in the Government Action, holding that the court erred in excluding the market for cardholders from its definition of the relevant market.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    U.S. v. Amex\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12172626\" index=\"16\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/838/179/\">\n    838 F.3d at 197, 206-07\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Because the Second Circuit found that the Government could not, on the facts of the case, prove net harm to both cardholders and merchants, it directed this court to enter judgment in favor of Amex.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12172626\" index=\"17\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/838/179/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12172626\" index=\"17\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/838/179/\">\n    at 207\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

On June 25, 2018, the Supreme Court affirmed the Second Circuit,\n   holding that this court should have included both sides of the Amex platform when defining the relevant market.\n   <em>\n    Ohio\n   </em>\n   , 138 S.Ct. at 2285-86.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   Following the Supreme Court's affirmance of the dismissal of the Government Action, matters resumed in the MP Actions. The court granted the MPs leave to file an amended complaint-intended to address some of the deficiencies with the Government Action raised by the Court in\n   <em>\n    Ohio\n   </em>\n   -and set a briefing schedule on various anticipated motions for summary judgment by Amex. (July 10, 2018, Order (Dkt. 811).) The MPs filed the amended complaint on July 27, 2018. (Am. Compl.) Under the original briefing schedule set by the court, Amex was to serve its motions for summary judgment-one as to the allegations of one-sided and Amex-only markets, and one \"additional\" motion as to the allegation of a two-sided market that includes all GPCCs-on the Merchant Plaintiffs by no later than August 17, 2018. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   July 10, 2018, Order.) On August 6, 2018, Amex requested that it \"be given leave to file a summary judgment motion directed to the Merchant Plaintiffs' allegations regarding competitive harm in a two-sided market after the new discovery is complete.\" (Aug. 6, 2018, Letter (Dkt. 815) at 2.) The court granted Amex's request and set the briefing schedule on the motion for summary judgment as to the Merchant Plaintiffs' claims on the two-sided, all-GPCC market to take place following the completion of additional fact discovery. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Aug. 6, 2018, Min. Entry; Aug. 17, 2018, Order.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   On August 17, 2018, Amex served on the Merchant Plaintiffs a motion to dismiss or, in the alternative, for summary judgment. (Amex Mem. in Supp. of Mot. to Dismiss (Dkt. 828 at ECF p.6).) Amex did not answer the amended complaint. The MPs subsequently sought an order from this court compelling Amex to file its answer and defenses to the amended complaint. (Mot. to Compel (Dkt. 828 at ECF p.1).) On September 26, 2018, the court held that, because Amex did not \"seek to dismiss any 'claims' in the amended complaint,\" its motion could not be considered a motion to dismiss, but rather one for summary judgment.\n   <em>\n    In re Am.

Supp.3d 94\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 100-02, 104 (E.D.N.Y. 2018).

The court also provisionally terminated the pending briefing schedule on the motion for summary judgment, on the assumption that it would be more efficient to deal with Amex's anticipated summary-judgment motion in one fell swoop after the completion of additional fact discovery.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    In re Amex\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12528215\" index=\"22\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/343/94/#p100\">\n    343 F.

On October 1, 2018, however, Amex informed the court that it had \"decided that it [would] not file a motion for summary judgment directed to Plaintiffs' two-sided market allegations.\" (Oct. 1, 2018, Amex Letter (Dkt. 832).) Accordingly, Amex's motion seeking summary judgment as to the MPs' one-sided and Amex-only relevant market allegations was fully briefed on October 12, 2018.

That is, in certain cases, the platform must \"[s]trik[e] the optimal balance of the prices charged on each side of the platform\" so as to \"maximize the value of [the platform's] services and to compete with their rivals.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 2281.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-51\">\n   In Ohio, the Supreme Court held that credit-card networks are two-sided platforms.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 2285.

On the flip side, a credit-card network that raises the price on either cardholders or merchants risks entering \"a feedback loop of declining demand\" due to the likelihood that members of the affected side will leave the platform, thus decreasing the value to the other side and increasing the risk that members of that side will in turn leave the platform.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 2281, 2285.

But even if the network is losing money on the cardholder side-usually because the network offers rewards, such as airline miles, as an incentive for cardholders to use the card-the network is able to remain viable \"because increasing the number of cardholders increases the value of accepting the card to merchants and, thus, increases the number of merchants who accept it.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 2286 (\"To optimize sales, the network must find the balance of pricing\n   that encourages the greatest number of matches between cardholders and merchants.\").

Despite this seemingly ironclad language, the MPs contend that the holding in\n   <em>\n    Ohio\n   </em>\n   is irrelevant to the instant action because market definition is a question of fact. (Opp'n at 3;\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 6.) Further, they submit that it would be inappropriate to apply the\n   <em>\n    Ohio\n   </em>\n   holding to this case given that these are different \"cases based on different facts.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 3.) In response, Amex states that the Supreme Court's holding in\n   <em>\n    Ohio\n   </em>\n   binds this court to reject the MPs' one-sided market allegations because the Supreme Court set forth a \"conclusion[ ] of law\" contrary to the MPs' legal formulation, and because \"the economic activity and the basic facts are the same\" between the Government Action and the MP Actions. (Reply at 3-4 &amp; n.6.) The court agrees with Amex.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-58\">\n   It strains credulity for the MPs to claim that this case is essentially dissimilar from the Government Action. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Opp'n at 3-4.) As in the Government Action, the plaintiffs claim that Amex is liable under the Sherman Act for restraining trade by including the NDPs in its merchant contracts. As in the Government Action, the plaintiffs' allegations are dependent on the economic realities of the credit-card market and the unique features of how Amex operates. And as in the Government Action, the plaintiffs seek to define the \"relevant market\" for Sherman Act purposes at least in part by reference to Amex's interactions with merchants alone, rather than by simultaneously scrutinizing Amex's interactions with merchants\n   <em>\n    and\n   </em>\n   cardholders.\n   <footnotemark>\n    7\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-59\">\n   The MPs argue that this case is distinguishable from the one that both the Supreme Court and the Second Circuit decided in Amex's favor because the MPs \"have come forward with different relevant market facts.\" (Opp'n at 4.) As far as the court can tell, the MPs do not argue that there is actually anything different about the facts at issue in this action. Rather, the MPs want the\n   <em>\n    chance\n   </em>\n   to make arguments that they claim were not properly presented in the Government Action and that would, in their estimation, result in a different legal outcome from that reached in\n   <em>\n    Ohio\n   </em>\n   . These arguments include: that Amex is a \"mature\" market, thus calling into question whether it exhibits indirect network effects (Opp'n at 9-12); and that \"there is abundant evidence that Amex does not 'balance' the prices on the two sides of its platform and that those prices are not 'relative' to each other or 'interconnected' \" (\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 12-15). The MPs are first incorrect that the Supreme Court must have explicitly considered an argument in order for its opinion to be binding as to that argument.\n   <footnotemark>\n    8\n   </footnotemark>\n   While the\n   <em>\n    Ohio\n   </em>\n   opinion does not mention the arguments made by the Government and its\n   <em>\n    amici\n   </em>\n   as to market maturity (\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Opp'n at 12), the Court still held that \"two-sided transaction platforms exhibit more pronounced indirect network effects\" and thus that both sides of the platform must be included in the relevant-market analysis,\n   <em>\n    Ohio\n   </em>\n   , 138 S.Ct. at 2286-87.\n   <footnotemark>\n    9\n   </footnotemark>\n   Similarly, while the\n   <em>\n    Ohio\n   </em>\n   opinion may not critically engage with the claim that \"Amex brings merchants and cardholders together and that credit card transactions occur simultaneously on both sides of the platform\" (Opp'n at 14), it is clear that the Supreme Court based its holding on this assumption, even if it was \"unchallenged\" (\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   ).\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Ohio\n   </em>\n   , 138 S.Ct. at 2286 (\"[T]wo-sided transaction platforms exhibit ... interconnected pricing and demand.... In the credit-card market, these transactions are jointly consumed by a cardholder, who uses the payment card to make a transaction, and a merchant, who accepts the payment card as a method of payment.\" (internal quotation marks omitted) ). The upshot of this analysis is that the MPs are wrong that\n   <em>\n    Ohio\n   </em>\n   \"did not ...\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-60\">\n   hold that credit card platforms\"-in particular, the Amex platform-\"are two-sided markets as a matter of law.\" (Opp'n at 6.)

[Amex] will lose cardholders and sales to MasterCard, Visa or Discover.\" (Opp'n at 20;\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Amex Mem. at 10.) In Amex's view, that is the end of the inquiry: because \"competition between two-sided transaction platforms does not exist just on one side of the platform or the other,\" the admission that competition for transactions exists on the cardholder side of the platform precludes the court from defining an Amex-only market. (Amex Mem. at 10.) Not so, argue the MPs: they submit that they will be able to present evidence at trial that cross-elasticity of demand on the\n   <em>\n    merchant\n   </em>\n   side of the platform is \"weak or non-existent\"-in other words, that \"Amex can raise its net two-sided price by increasing merchant fees while leaving rewards alone without losing sales to other credit cards\"-thus making it inappropriate for the court to grant summary judgment as to the single-brand submarket allegations. (Opp'n at 20.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-80\">\n   The court does not think it prudent to state, as a matter of law, that cross-elasticity of demand on one side of a two-sided market forecloses the possibility that a single-brand market or submarket may be appropriate. It is true that one group of participants in the two-sided market before the court-the cardholders-treats Amex cards interchangeably with other credit cards. But it is misguided to end the analysis there. If there is a disputed question of fact regarding whether the merchants treat Amex as interchangeable, there remains an open question as to whether the product at issue-the transactions-is actually interchangeable. This analysis is not, as Amex claims, an \"attempt to segment the substitutability analysis.\" (Mem. at 10.) As the MPs point out, the Supreme Court has commanded that, in the case of a two-sided transaction market, courts \"must look to 'both sides of the platform.' \" (Opp'n at 22 (quoting\n   <em>\n    Ohio\n   </em>\n   , 138 S.Ct. at 2286 );\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 21 (stating that there is \"no rational basis\" to look only at the cardholder side of the platform \"where the anticompetitive restraint is directed only at the merchant side of the platform).)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-81\">\n   But this is not the end of the inquiry. The \"prevailing rule against single-brand markets\" has multiple underpinnings which must be dealt with before the court may conclude that a single-brand market is appropriate. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Mem. at 11.) Chief among these is the rule that a market of \"otherwise identical products\" cannot be rendered \"non-interchangeable\" simply by a plaintiff's assumption of contractual restraints.\n   <em>\n    Queen City Pizza\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11903544\" index=\"146\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/124/430/\">\n    124 F.3d at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   438 ;\n   <em>\n    accord\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Smugglers Notch Homeowners' Ass'n v.

Amex argues that the MPs' claims as to an Amex-only market are barred because this market definition is \"based on the contractual restraints at issue.\" (Mem. at 14.) In order to understand whether this defense is on-point, the court once again turns to\n   <em>\n    Queen City Pizza\n   </em>\n   . In\n   <em>\n    Queen City Pizza\n   </em>\n   , the franchisee plaintiffs alleged that Domino's was restraining trade in the market for Domino's-approved pizza ingredients and supplies because franchisees could not use non-Domino's-approved products without violating the franchise agreement.\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11903544\" index=\"152\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/124/430/\">\n    124 F.3d at 438\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . The court concluded that the only reason Domino's had power to restrain the plaintiffs from purchasing other-interchangeable-pizza ingredients and supplies was due to the contracts that the plaintiffs had voluntarily entered into, and that that was insufficient to make out a showing that Domino's had power in the market.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11903544\" index=\"153\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/124/430/\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11903544\" index=\"153\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/124/430/\">\n    at 438-41\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-83\">\n   The same seems true here: the MPs would be permitted to steer customers away from using Amex cards but for the inclusion of the NDPs in the contracts which the MPs voluntarily entered into with Amex; the only thing allegedly restraining competition for \"Amex\" transactions-and thereby distinguishing those transactions from transactions using any other credit card-are the NDPs. As Amex points out, the MPs have admitted to the fact that their single-brand market theory is based solely on the NDPs. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Amex Rule 56.1 Statement of Material Facts (Dkt. 837) \u00b6 36 (\"[W]ith its Merchant Restraints in place, AmEx operates in a product market unto itself....\" (quoting Expert Report of Dr. Christopher A. Vellturo (\"Vellturo I\") (Dkt. 840-5) (under seal) \u00b6 104) ).) Indeed, in their brief in opposition to Amex's motion for summary judgment, the MPs seemingly do not dispute the contention that their \"allegation for an Amex-only submarket is 'based on the contractual restraints at issue.' \" (Opp'n at 22 (quoting Mem. at 14).) Instead, the MPs state that\n   <em>\n    Queen City Pizza\n   </em>\n   does not preclude their Amex-only market definition because here, unlike in\n   <em>\n    Queen City Pizza\n   </em>\n   , Amex has \"pre-contract economic power that gives it the ability to compel merchants to accept its cards and agree to the anti-steering rules.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 24;\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 23.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-84\">\n   The MPs' Amex-only market allegations founder at this juncture, due to the fact that the MPs impermissibly seek to prove Amex's pre-contract market power by reference to \"critical loss analysis.\" In general, a critical loss analysis \"identifies the volume of business a supplier would have to lose (or correspondingly, the number of customers who would have to threaten to shift to another supplier) for a posited price increase to be rendered unprofitable.\" (Vellturo I \u00b6 106;\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 109-13.) In this case, the MPs argue that a critical loss analysis would show that they are unable to respond to increases in Amex's merchant fees by ceasing to accept Amex cards. (Opp'n at 23-24;\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Vellturo I \u00b6 114.) This is so because a merchant that stops accepting Amex would suffer a greater \"loss of profits on purchases by customers who no longer shop at the merchants because AmEx is no longer accepted\" than it would gain profits from \"a reduction in its payment acceptance costs on customers that it retains who now use a lower cost card rather than AmEx.\" (Vellturo\n   I \u00b6 107;\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Opp'n at 24 (\"[A] small loss of sales causes the merchant a greater loss than does the Amex anticompetitive overcharge.\").) In other words, the supposed pre-contract power that Amex possesses that allegedly compels merchants to accept the terms of their cardholder agreement-including the NDPs-comes from the fact that Amex cardholders would rather take their business to an Amex-accepting merchant than use a different card to shop at a merchant that has ceased accepting Amex.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-85\">\n   As Amex correctly identifies, this is cardholder insistence by another name.\n   <footnotemark>\n    16\n   </footnotemark>\n   (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Amex Reply at 8.) In the Government Action, this court relied on cardholder insistence-which refers to \"the segment of Amex's cardholder base who insist on paying with their Amex cards and who would shop elsewhere or spend less if unable to use their cards of choice\"-for its finding that Amex possessed sufficient market power to cause an adverse effect on competition.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    U.S. v.

The Second Circuit reversed, stating that cardholder insistence could\n   <em>\n    not\n   </em>\n   form the basis of a finding of market power.\n   <em>\n    U.S. v.
