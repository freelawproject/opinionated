The United States has filed a Response in Opposition (Doc. 27) and Defendant filed a Reply (Doc. 28). On August 21, 2018 and September 10, 2018, a hearing was held on the Motion. (Docs. 19, 20, 23, 25). The United States presented the testimony\n   of Wilmington Police Officer Robert Martin and Wilmington Police Sergeant Neil Rager.

Defendant maintains the search was conducted in violation of his Fourth Amendment rights because officers failed to obtain a search warrant or valid consent to search the home.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   On May 20, 2018, City of Wilmington Police Department Sergeant Neil Rager arrived at a house on Darbyshire Road in Wilmington, Ohio. (Doc. 25, PAGEID# 17). Sergeant Rager was responding to a 911 call made by someone who was driving past the house and saw \"a male hitting on a female in the front yard of a house.\" (Gov't Exh. 1; Doc. 25, PAGEID# 78). Officer Rager testified that he been to this house on Darbyshire Road on other occasions and that \"[u]sually it's the lady that owns the house wants somebody removed for disturbances, loud arguing.\" (Doc. 25, PAGEID# 81).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   Officer Rager's body camera footage from that day was introduced at the trial as Government's Exhibit Two.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   When Sergeant Rager arrived at the house, no one was in the front yard. (Doc. 25, PAGEID# 79). As he was walking up to the front of the house, Sergeant Rager saw a young boy coming out of the house with a basketball, and asked the boy if his mom or dad were home. (Doc. 25, PAGEID# 82; Gov't Exh. 2 at 0:48). The boy ran into the house and a young female walked out of the house. (Doc. 25, PAGEID# 82).\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   Sergeant Rager explained to her why he was there. (Doc. 25, PAGEID# 82). The female then told Sergeant Rager that the people who were fighting were in the garage. (Gov't. Exh. 2, at 1:40). When Sergeant Rager asked how he could get into the garage, the female started walking into the front door of the house. (Gov't. Exh. 2, at 1:45). Sergeant Rager followed the female into the house and the female showed him to a door which led to the garage. (Doc. 25, PAGEID# 82-83). Sergeant Rager went to the door, but it was locked. (Doc. 25, PAGEID# 83). The female told Sergeant Rager that this was not her house, but it belonged to \"Christy\" who was not there. (Gov't. Exh. 2, at 1:53, 2:17). Sergeant Rager asked a male who was sitting on a couch inside the house if he had been the one fighting in the front yard. (Gov't. Exh. 2, at 2:07). The male got off the couch and explained that the people who had been fighting were in the garage. (Gov't. Exh. 2, at 2:29). Sergeant Rager then knocked on the door to the garage. (Doc. 25, PAGEID# 83). Defendant opened the door. (Doc. 25, PAGEID# 83). Sergeant Rager testified that he could see into the garage and it was full of \"loose\n   random furniture\" and looked like a place where people \"just slept there overnight.\" (Doc. 25, PAGEID# 84). Defendant had a backpack on his shoulder when he came to the door. (Doc. 25, PAGEID# 83, 95). When Sergeant Rager asked Defendant where he lived, Defendant told Sergeant Rager that he was staying there. (Doc. 25, PAGEID# 96).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   Sergeant Rager testified that because was on the scene alone and he could see that there were other people in the house, he asked Defendant to step outside to talk to him. (Doc. 25, PAGEID# 83-84). Sergeant Rager testified that before Defendant left the doorway, he \"deliberately set [the backpack] down on the floor.\" (Doc. 25, PAGEID# 84). However, Defendant did not go outside as instructed. Instead, Defendant went to the back of the house yelling for the \"house lady.\" (Doc. 25, PAGEID# 85). Defendant then walked out the back door and yelled to people in the yard, asking them, \"where's the lady at?\" (Doc. 25, PAGEID# 85). Sergeant Rager followed Defendant. (Gov't. Exh. 2, at 4:22). Sergeant Rager's bodycam video shows that outside there was a man and a woman in a fenced-in yard working on a lawnmower, another adult male in the yard who appears to be smoking, a toddler in diapers on the back deck along with least two other children. (Gov't. Exh. 2, at 4:15 to 4:24). None of these people responded to Defendant or spoke to Sergeant Rager. Sergeant Rager continued to follow Defendant as he walked back into the house, became more and more agitated, and repeatedly asking \"somebody to call somebody.\" (Gov't. Exh. 2, at 4:27 to 4:34). Inside the house, Sergeant Rager and Defendant got into a scuffle, and Sergeant Rager arrested Defendant for obstructing, assault and resisting. (Doc. 25, PAGEID# 86).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   After Sergeant Rager took Defendant outside and placed him in the back of his police vehicle, he had a conversation with Jennifer Alston, who told him Defendant's name and explained that she was Defendant's fianc\u00e9. (Doc. 25, PAGEID# 97-98). Sergeant Rager walked back towards the front door where he was met by two of the adult males coming out of the house. (Gov't. Exh. 2, at 13:12). Sergeant Rager asked them whose house this was, and the men responded that the house belonged to \"Christy\" and she was not home. (Gov't. Exh. 2, at 13:20 to 13:25). Sergeant Rager asked to speak to the young woman again. (Gov't. Exh. 2, at 1:45). The two men yelled to her to get her to come outside, and she came to the front door carrying a child. (Gov't. Exh. 2, at 1:45). Sergeant Rager then went back into the house. (Doc. 25, PAGEID# 87). At the hearing, Sergeant Rager explained that he went back into the house because wanted to \"talk to the witnesses and to see why [Defendant] had left his backpack behind.\" (Doc. 25, PAGEID# 87). Sergeant Rager testified that there were a total of approximately eight adults and children in the home. (Doc. 25, PAGEID# 86). At no time did anyone in the house tell Sergeant Rager that he did not have permission to go back into the house or into the garage. (Doc. 25, PAGEID# 87-88).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   When Sergeant Rager saw the backpack it was partially unzipped. (Doc. 25, PAGEID# 88). Sergeant Rager could see part of a pistol grip. (Doc. 25, PAGEID# 89). Sergeant Rager removed it from the garage and took it outside in order to maintain control of the area. (Doc. 25, PAGEID# 91). Jennifer Alston was present from the time Sergeant Rager picked up the backpack and brought it outside. (Gov't. Exh. 2, at 13:41 to 14:45). Sergeant Rager and Alston discussed who the backpack belonged to and what was in the backpack, but at no point did Altson object to Sergeant Rager entering the garage or searching the backpack. (Id.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   Wilmington Police Officer Robert Martin testified that when he arrived on the scene, he removed a Taurus .40 caliber pistol and MasterPiece Arms .45 caliber pistol from the backpack. (Doc. 25, PAGEID # 70-72; Gov't Exh. 8-A; Gov't Exh. 9-A).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   Defendant maintains that neither he, his fianc\u00e9, nor any third-party gave the Wilmington, Ohio police officers permission to search the house, let alone his living area in the garage. Defendant argues that as a result, the search violated his Fourth Amendment rights and the evidence discovered as a result of the search should be suppressed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   The United States responds that (1) Defendant lacks standing to contest the entry of law enforcement into the house; (2) the weapon was in plain view of the officer; and (3) Defendant abandoned the backpack.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   <strong>\n    II.\n    <em>\n     ANALYSIS\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   The Fourth Amendment protects the \"right of the people to be secure in their persons, houses, papers, and effects, against unreasonable searches and seizures, shall not be violated.\" U.S. Const. amend.

The United States Supreme Court has recently explained:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-26\">\n   The concept of standing in Fourth Amendment cases can be a useful shorthand for capturing the idea that a person must have a cognizable Fourth Amendment interest in the place searched before seeking relief for an unconstitutional search; but it should not be confused with Article III standing, which is jurisdictional and must be assessed before reaching the merits.\n   <em>\n    Arizona Christian School Tuition Organization v.

Even though the Court need not address the issue of standing first, the Court chooses to do so in this instance because the question as to whether Defendant has standing to challenge the search can be easily resolved in this case.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   It is well-settled that an overnight guest retains a \"legitimate expectation of privacy in his host's home\" sufficient to establish standing to challenge the validity of a warrantless search.\n   <em>\n    Minnesota v.

(Doc. 20, PAGEID# 53). However, the only credible evidence is that the backpack belonged to Defendant. When Sergeant Rager first encountered Defendant, Defendant was carrying the backpack on his shoulder.

After Sergeant Rager arrested Defendant, Sergeant Rager spoke with Alston, who told him that she was Defendant's fianc\u00e9 and confirmed that they had been the two people fighting in front yard. (Gov't. Exh. 2, at 7:49). After speaking with Alston, Sergeant Rager went back into the house to search the garage. There are no facts in the record which would indicate that Sergeant Rager believed there was an individual in the area posing a danger to those on the arrest scene.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   The Government argues that there was some other risk of danger.

The scene at the house was somewhat chaotic when Sergeant Rager arrived, but there had been no mention of a gun by the 911 caller or anyone present in the house. The main source of the chaos at the scene was Defendant himself and his refusal to cooperate. However, Sergeant Rager had placed Defendant in the back of his police vehicle before he went back into the house. Defendant no longer presented a risk of danger at that time.
