KANE, SENIOR U.S. DISTRICT JUDGE\n  </author>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   On the night of February 14, 2014, Plaintiff Patti French called 911 to obtain\n   a mental health hold for her son, Plaintiff Shane French. Officers from the Cortez Police Department arrived at the French home in short order. Hearing voices inside, they entered the residence, tackled Shane, and tased him several times. In the commotion, an officer was injured, and an officer shoved Plaintiff Glenn French, Shane's father and Patti's husband. Shane was arrested and charged with attempted murder, felony criminal mischief, felony obstruction, reckless endangerment, and menacing. He was acquitted of all charges after spending ten months in jail.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   The claims brought by Patti, Glenn, and Shane French (the \"Frenches\") in this case arise out of the February 14, 2014 events and Shane's subsequent prosecution. Defendants are the City of Cortez, its Police Department Chief Roy C. Lane, and officers involved in the incident, Sergeant David Allmon and Officers Casey Eubanks, Jennifer Goodall,\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   and Boyd Neagle. In effect, six civil rights claims are asserted under\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201983\">\n    42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983\n   </extracted-citation>\n   : (1) the Frenches allege unlawful entry into their home by Officers Eubanks and Neagle; (2) Shane alleges excessive force by Officers Eubanks, Neagle, and Goodall;\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   (3) Glenn alleges excessive force by Officers Eubanks and Neagle; (4) Shane alleges false arrest and unlawful seizure of his person by Sergeant Allmon and Officers Eubanks, Neagle, and Goodall; (5) Shane alleges malicious prosecution by Officers Eubanks, Neagle, and Goodall; and (6) the Frenches allege that the City of Cortez failed to adequately train its officers in the recognition of and interaction with persons with mental illness.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   Glenn and Shane additionally allege that Officer Eubanks denied them the benefits reserved to them by the Americans with Disabilities Act (\"ADA\"). Defendants now move for summary judgment on each of these claims.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   The Frenches submit that \"this is a classic example of law enforcement, as a result of inadequate training, criminalizing and incarcerating mentally ill people.\" Resp. at 1. The facts, as presented by the Frenches, support that charge. The officers involved unreasonably acted based on previously held assumptions and information without reacting to the circumstances as they unfolded. Still, some of the Frenches' claims cannot overcome the defense of qualified immunity or are legally deficient. For the reasons that follow, I grant Defendants' Motion for Summary Judgment in part and deny it in part.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   I.

Facts-Viewed in the Light Most Favorable to the Frenches\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   Shane French has struggled with mental health problems, like post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and bipolar disorder, for years.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   In the past, when Shane was down or not thinking clearly, Patti usually just let him talk until he wore himself out so that he wouldn't drive or leave their home. Patti Dep. at 46:16-47:10, ECF No. 49-1. On a few occasions, however, Patti and Glenn French sought assistance from the Cortez Police Department.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 47:20-48:9, 66:24-67:1; Glenn Dep. at 14:19-15:3, ECF No. 49-2. The responding officers generally were successful in calming Shane down just by talking to him or offering to give him a ride somewhere.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   Shane had many other less congenial interactions with the Police Department over the years, though, including instances in which he injured family members and engaged in criminal activity. Shane's criminal history, for example, includes arrests in 2000 for resisting arrest and in 2011 for misdemeanor assault of a police officer. Patti Dep. at 148:2-24, 151:3-6.\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   In September 2003, the police were called by a neighbor after Shane accidentally poked his father with a barbecue fork while climbing through a window.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 109:19-110:1, 133:9-15; Glenn Dep. 35:16-36:22. Almost ten years later, Shane hit his brother while they were wrestling, and his brother decided to press charges so that Shane could receive help. Patti Dep. at 110:2-111:15.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   The Cortez Police Department was impacted by its interactions with Shane to the extent that Chief Lane admitted, when Shane was involved in a call, it was not one the Department liked to take. Lane Dep. at 39:10-14, ECF No. 55-20. Prior to February 14, 2014, a number of the Department's officers, including Officer Goodall and Sergeant Allmon, had been dispatched to the French residence due to Shane's\n   conduct. Goodall Aff. at 2, ECF No. 49-6; Allmon Aff. at 2, ECF No. 49-7. Likewise, Officer Neagle had interacted with Shane and had knowledge that he carried knives in the sleeves of his leather jacket. Neagle Dep. at 7:17-9:13, 11:13-14, ECF No. 49-3;\n   <em>\n    accord\n   </em>\n   Patti Dep. at 154:20-155:8 (admitting that, starting in 2013, it was typical for officers to find knives on Shane or in his vehicle when coming into contact with him). The prevailing attitude within the Department in responding to incidents involving Shane was that he must be \"high\" or \"off his meds.\" Lane Dep. at 36:22-37:1.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   In Colorado in 2014, an individual could be placed under a 72-hour emergency mental health hold for treatment and evaluation if he appeared to have a mental illness and, as a result of that illness, appeared to be \"an imminent danger to others or to himself\" or to be \"gravely disabled.\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"10\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Colo.%20Rev.%20Stat.%20%C2%A7%2027-65-105\">\n    Colo.

Initiating the process for such a hold could be done either: (1) by a certified peace officer, medical professional, licensed professional counselor, or clinical social worker, among others, or (2) via an affidavit sworn to or affirmed before a judge.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"11\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Colo.%20Rev.%20Stat.%20%C2%A7%2027-65-105\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   On the night of February 14, 2014, Patti French called 911 for the Cortez Police Department to initiate that process. Shane was in trauma after he stopped taking his psychiatric medications. Patti Dep. at 67:19-21, 112:14-16, 132:4-7. Patti and Glenn had attempted to calm him but ultimately decided they needed the police to intervene. Shane had been rambling nonsensically and yelling at the top of his lungs outside the house for hours, and Patti didn't want to disturb the neighborhood.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"12\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Colo.%20Rev.%20Stat.%20%C2%A7%2027-65-105\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   at 64:16-65-16. She called 911 and calmly informed dispatch that Shane was \"out of control\" and she believed he needed a mental health hold. 911 Call at 00:18-20, 00:45-46, ECF No. 55-1. Patti specifically requested that any officers arrive with their lights and sirens turned off because she believed they would upset Shane further.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 00:33-40.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   Cortez Police Dispatch radioed the call and relayed that the officers should not arrive with their emergency lights or sirens activated. Neagle Aff. at 2, ECF No. 49-5. Because Shane was involved and the call came from Patti and late at night, Sergeant Allmon coded it a \"10-0,\" indicating to the officers that they should use additional caution when responding. Allmon Aff. at 2. Dispatch contacted and questioned Patti again, and she confirmed that Shane's acting out was entirely verbal, he was not violent, and he needed \"mental help.\" 911 Call at 03:28-36.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   Upon arriving at the French home, Officers Eubanks and Neagle observed Shane at the entrance to the residence. Eubanks Aff. at 2, ECF No. 49-4; Neagle Aff. at 2. As they approached, Shane went inside and shut the door.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   The officers then heard voices, including a man talking very loudly, inside the home. Patti Dep. at 181:19-182:1. Officer Eubanks engaged the door handle and found it to be locked. He began to bang loudly on the door. As Patti and Glenn moved toward the door, Shane was in Patti's line of sight with his hands empty.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 81:2-25. Patti reached the door and unlocked it, but before either Glenn or Patti could open it, the officers burst through.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 77:13-78-16. The door flung open with such force that it left a hole in the wall and broke the frame.

The officers were\n   yelling and told Glenn to get out of the way.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 18:2-3; Patti Dep. at 82:16-25. Officer Ryan Carter, who is no longer a defendant in this case, entered the home behind the other officers. Together they moved directly toward Shane without giving him any verbal warnings.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 82:4-13. Shane took at most a step or so in the direction of the kitchen where the officers were headed.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 82:6-11. Shane did not lunge at Officer Eubanks,\n   <em>\n    French\n   </em>\n   , No. 2014-CR-000040, 04/30/2014 Trans. at 58:15, and his hands were at his sides empty,\n   <em>\n    French\n   </em>\n   , No. 2014-CR-000040, 10/17/2014 Trans. at 46:4-13, ECF No. 55-5. Officer Eubanks rushed towards Shane, made chest-to-chest contact with him, picked him up off the ground, and threw him down so that he fell face-down on the floor. Officer Eubanks' body camera was inadvertently activated during this skirmish.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   While on top of Shane, Officer Eubanks saw a knife in each of Shane's hands.\n   <footnotemark>\n    7\n   </footnotemark>\n   Eubanks Aff. at 4; Eubanks Dep. at 99:21-100:1, ECF No. 49-8. Officer Carter removed the two knives and placed them behind him out of reach. Carter Dep. at 16:25-17:10, ECF No. 49-11. To assist Officer Eubanks, Officer Neagle drew his Taser and delivered a drive stun\n   <footnotemark>\n    8\n   </footnotemark>\n   with the Taser to Shane's lower back on the right side at least two times. Taser Log at 6, ECF No. 55-13. Shane was yelling \"just kill me\" as he was restrained. Body Camera Video at 00:13, ECF No. 49-15.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   Officers Eubanks, Neagle, and Carter along with Sergeant Allmon, who had also entered the home, placed Shane in handcuffs. The two knives-a paring knife and a steak knife-were laying on the floor. Neagle Aff. at 4; Goodall Aff. at 3; Patti Dep. at 166:9-24. Meanwhile, Officer Eubanks felt a burning or stinging on his lower right side and confirmed that he had a \u00bd mm cut.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   Sergeant Allmon and Officer Neagle removed Shane to the front yard, shutting the front door of the Frenches' home. Patti Dep. at 94:13-20. They began a pat-down search of Shane at Officer Neagle's patrol vehicle. At least five officers surrounded and restrained Shane, pressing his cuffed hands up over his shoulders. As a compliance technique, Sergeant Allmon struck the area of Shane's suprascapular nerve. Allmon Aff. at 4. Officer Neagle administered approximately five drive stuns with his Taser to Shane's back within two minutes and thirty-six seconds. Neagle Aff. at 5; Taser Log at 6, ECF No. 55-13. And Officer Jennifer Goodall, who also appeared at the scene, administered a compression wrist lock to Shane. Goodall Aff. at 3. Officer Eubanks' body camera video shows Shane moving and the officers using force against him. Ultimately, a hobble restraint device was secured on Shane's ankles. Neagle Aff. at 5; Allmon Aff. at 4.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   While he was restrained against the vehicle, Shane apologized to the officers no\n   fewer than ten times and explained that he believed they were trying to hurt his family, specifically his blind father. Body Camera Video at 06:41-09:42. He also informed the officers that he had \"mental problems.\" In response, individual officers called him a \"stupid fuck\" and told him to \"shut up.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 08:06-08:51. Stepping away, Officer Eubanks, muttered, \"I should have fucking shot that son of a bitch,\" Body Camera Video at 09:56-58, and at some point struck a patrol car with his knee. Eubanks Dep. at 29:16-25, ECF No. 55-8.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   The assessment and pat-down of Shane outside was completed in a little over six minutes, and he was placed into Officer Neagle's vehicle. From the time of Patti's 911 call to the time the officers radioed that Shane was in custody, approximately 15 minutes elapsed. Shane was taken to the hospital, where the numerous burn marks on his back from the drive stuns did not prevent him from being medically cleared. Goodall Aff. at 4; Shane Photos. at 1-3, ECF No. 55-9. The officers then transported him to the jail and did not seek any type of mental health treatment for him.\n   <footnotemark>\n    9\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   Based on the statements of the other officers involved in the February 14, 2014 incident and what she witnessed, Officer Goodall selected the criminal offenses with which Shane was initially charged. They included attempted murder, felony criminal mischief, attempting to disarm a police officer, felony obstruction, reckless endangerment, and menacing. Goodall Aff. at 4-5. The District Attorney's Office filed and prosecuted those criminal charges against Shane, who spent approximately ten months in custody as a result.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Furse Aff., ECF No. 49-12. Shane took the case to trial, and a jury acquitted him of all charges.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   The individual Defendants in this case had all undergone training on the Cortez Police Department's Use-of-Force Policy, which directs officers to take into account a \"subject's mental state or capacity\" in determining the reasonableness of force. Cortez Police Dep't Policy Manual at 37, ECF No. 49-14. The Department provides annual training on that Policy, and its Field Training Program and Daily Training Bulletins update officers regarding the appropriate use of force. Lane Aff. at 2, ECF No. 49-13. Each of the Department's officers are also sent to the Colorado Peace Officer Standards and Training Crisis Intervention Training, which includes training on how to identify and interact with persons with mental illnesses.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 3. Nonetheless, Officer Eubanks testified that he has no training in identifying mental health disorders or in how to interact with individuals with bipolar disorder, PTSD, or schizophrenia. Eubanks Dep. at 103:20-104:10, 114:6-115:1, ECF No. 55-8.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   III. Analysis\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   The purpose of motions for summary judgment is to demonstrate there is no need for a trial because under the undisputed facts, or based on the facts presented by the nonmovants, the law dictates a judgment in the movants' favor. As noted in the previous Section, however, Defendant-Movants dispute and recharacterize the factual record put forward by the Frenches. Viewing the facts in the light most favorable to the Frenches, as I must, I conclude that summary judgment is not proper for the Frenches' unlawful entry claim, Shane's excessive force and false arrest claims, or the Frenches' claim against the City of Cortez for failure to train its officers. It is, however, appropriate on the remaining claims.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   A.

Simply calling 911 for purposes other than reporting a crime cannot be construed as boundless consent for officers to disregard evolving circumstances and enter a home in any manner without attempting to question the caller or occupants.\n   <footnotemark>\n    11\n   </footnotemark>\n   Setting such a low threshold for consent would eviscerate the protection against unreasonable governmental intrusion provided by the Fourth Amendment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   With their ill-considered consent theory, Officers Eubanks and Neagle highlight the qualified immunity standard's potential for abuse.

Although the facts in\n   <em>\n    Casey\n   </em>\n   are not identical in that the plaintiff there was suspected of committing a crime, he was not in his home, he stepped around the officer, and he was not noted to have any history with the police, the court's directives were unequivocal and should have been instructive for the present circumstances.\n   <footnotemark>\n    18\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-80\">\n   That being the case, Officer Eubanks is not entitled to summary judgment on the basis of qualified immunity for Shane's excessive force claim.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-81\">\n   <em>\n    Officer Neagle\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-82\">\n   After Officer Eubanks' initial takedown of Shane, while he was restraining Shane in the prone position, he saw a knife in each of Shane's hands. Officer Carter promptly removed the two knives from Shane's hands. Seeking to assist Officer Eubanks, Officer Neagle drew his Taser and delivered a drive stun with the Taser to Shane's lower back on the right side at least two times. Officer Neagle asserts those two drive stuns were justified, regardless of whether it was known Shane was in possession of knives or that Officer Eubanks had been injured, since Shane was resisting and presented a threat to Officer Eubanks.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-83\">\n   Once Shane was cuffed and taken outside, Officer Neagle employed his Taser to drive stun Shane at least five times as the officers were completing the pat-down. Officer Neagle argues his use of force during that period was reasonable because Shane was still resisting, had not yet been cleared for weapons after having injured Officer Eubanks, and attempted to take his Taser from him.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-84\">\n   Viewing the facts in the light most favorable to Shane, Officer Neagle's use of force both inside and outside the French home rose to the level of a constitutional violation. Inside the home, Shane was tackled after taking at most a step or so, but not lunging, in the direction the officers were headed. When Officer Neagle deployed his Taser, Officer Eubanks was on top of Shane and had him positioned face down beneath him. Officer Eubanks had already demonstrated that he could physically dominate Shane by picking him up and turning him as he threw him to the ground. More than that, at least three officers were surrounding Shane and assisting to control his limbs. Once Officer Carter removed the knives from Shane's hands, the immediate threat Shane posed to the officers was minimal.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-85\">\n   The evidence is conflicting on the extent to which Shane resisted arrest. Shane did not initiate the physical struggle with the officers. Officer Eubanks' body camera video documents Shane yelling \"just kill me,\" not commonly the words of a combative individual. There is no indication or testimony that Shane fought Officer Carter's removal of the knives from his possession. Making all inferences in Shane's favor, his resistance could have been a less than voluntary reaction to being thrown to the ground and tased. Shane's defiance in such a fashion \"does not retroactively justify\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-86\">\n   the uses of force.\n   <em>\n    Dixon v.

Shane's actions must also be considered in light of the fact that he was not informed why he was being arrested, nor was he given any warnings regarding use of the Taser. The Tenth Circuit recently emphasized the significance of giving a warning regarding the imminent use of force, distinguishing\n   <em>\n    Cavanaugh v. Woods Cross City\n   </em>\n   , in which a woman was tased in the back without warning, from\n   <em>\n    Aldaba v. Pickens\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12177099\" index=\"166\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/844/870/#p876\">\n    844 F.3d 870\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 876 (10th Cir. 2016), in which several warnings were given before deployment of the Taser.\n   <em>\n    Lee\n   </em>\n   , 904 F.3d at 1150 n.1.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-87\">\n   Outside the French home, it was known to Officer Neagle that Officer Eubanks had been injured, likely due to the knives in Shane's possession. But Shane was surrounded by at least five officers and handcuffed with his hands being forced up toward his shoulders. At that point, he certainly did not pose an immediate threat to the officers. \"While it is reasonable to frisk a detainee suspected of carrying a weapon, ... it is not reasonable to hit him in the stomach with a flashlight, or choke and beat him, solely on the basis of that suspicion.\"\n   <em>\n    Dixon\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"10548338\" index=\"167\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/922/1456/#p1463\">\n    922 F.2d at 1463\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (citation omitted). As to the extent Shane resisted arrest while being patted down, it is unclear for that period as well. Officer Eubanks' body camera video shows Shane moving and the officers using force against him. Shane can also be heard confessing that he has \"mental problems\" and apologizing to the officers repeatedly, again not an intuitive utterance by someone resisting arrest. Still, he was provided with no explanation, and there were no commands given to him other than to \"stop resisting.\" Faced with this situation, Officer Neagle drive stunned Shane five more times within two minutes and thirty-six seconds. Each time Officer Neagle tased Shane, the more excessive and at the same time the less necessary the use of force became.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Perea v.

Officer Neagle does not allege and no evidence indicates that he altered the manner or level of his use of force based on Shane's obvious mental health struggles.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-90\">\n   A number of other circuits have made broad pronouncements that less intrusive or de-escalation techniques are to be employed when faced with a mentally unstable individual. For example, in\n   <em>\n    Bryan v. MacPherson\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6053754\" index=\"179\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/630/805/#p829\">\n    630 F.3d 805\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 829 (9th Cir. 2010), the Ninth Circuit explained:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-91\">\n   [I]f [the officer] believed [the plaintiff] was mentally disturbed he should have made greater effort to take control of the situation through less intrusive means. As we have held, \"[t]he problems posed by, and thus the tactics to be employed against, an unarmed, emotionally distraught individual who is creating a disturbance or resisting arrest are ordinarily different from those involved in law enforcement efforts to subdue an armed and dangerous criminal who has recently committed a serious offense.\"\n   <em>\n    Deorle\n   </em>\n   [\n   <em>\n    v. Rutherford\n   </em>\n   ], 272 F.3d [1272,] 1282-83 [ (9th Cir. 2001) ]. Although we have refused to create two tracks of excessive force analysis, one for the mentally ill and one for serious criminals, we have found that even \"when an emotionally disturbed individual is 'acting out' and inviting officers to use deadly force to subdue him, the governmental interest in using such force is diminished by the fact that the officers are confronted ... with a mentally ill individual.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 1283. The same reasoning applies to intermediate levels of force. A mentally ill individual is in need of a doctor, not a jail cell, and in the usual case-where such an individual is neither a threat to himself nor to anyone else-the government's interest in deploying force to detain him is not as substantial as its interest in deploying that force to apprehend a dangerous criminal. Moreover, the purpose of detaining a mentally ill individual is not to punish him, but to help him. The government has an important interest in providing assistance to a person in need of psychiatric care; thus, the use of force that may be justified by that interest necessarily differs both in degree and in kind from the use of force that would be justified against a person who has committed a crime or who poses a threat to the community.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-92\">\n   Similarly, in\n   <em>\n    Martin v. City of Broadview Heights\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3555093\" index=\"180\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/712/951/#p962\">\n    712 F.3d 951\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 962 (6th Cir. 2013), the Sixth Circuit confirmed that its precedent required officers confronted with an unarmed individual exhibiting \"conspicuous signs that he was mentally unstable\" to \"de-escalate the situation and adjust the application of force downward.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    19\n   </footnotemark>\n   Again,\n   there is no suggestion Officer Neagle took Shane's mental state into consideration as he drive stunned him over and over.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-93\">\n   The above factors-Shane posing no immediate threat, not initiating the altercation, minimally resisting as a reaction to the officers' use of force, exhibiting signs of mental illness, and being given no warnings or explanations-substantiate the conclusion that Officer Neagle's repeated deployment of his Taser over such brief periods was unreasonable. Since Shane has met his burden of showing Officer Neagle's use of force violated his constitutional rights, I must address whether the law establishing that violation was clear as of February 14, 2014. Based on two Tenth Circuit cases-\n   <em>\n    Casey v. City of Federal Heights\n   </em>\n   and\n   <em>\n    Cavanaugh v.

After the first officer tackled Mr. Casey, another officer arrived and, believing Mr. Casey \" 'needed to be controlled,' \" tased him with her Taser in dart mode. Once the officers had Mr. Casey on the ground and handcuffed, another officer drive stunned him. The court found Mr. Casey was not \"violent or attempting to flee\" even though he admitted he \"kept trying to get up\" as he was being beaten and tased.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 1280, 1282. Ultimately, the court declared: \"[I]t is excessive to use a Taser to control a target without having any reason to believe that a lesser amount of force-or a verbal command-could not exact compliance.\"\n   <em>\n    Casey\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3327851\" index=\"181\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/509/1278/#p1282\">\n    509 F.3d at 1286\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-95\">\n   In\n   <em>\n    Cavanaugh\n   </em>\n   , a husband called the police for help locating his wife after they had a fight and she left their home with a kitchen knife.\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3799757\" index=\"182\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/625/661/#p666\">\n    625 F.3d 661\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 662-63.

In\n   <em>\n    Perea\n   </em>\n   , the court unequivocally wrote that \"[i]t is-and was [in 2011]-clearly established law in the Tenth Circuit that the use of disproportionate force to arrest an individual who, is not suspected of committing a serious crime and who poses no threat to others constitutes excessive force.\"\n   <em>\n    Perea\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6814360\" index=\"188\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/817/1198/#p1203\">\n    817 F.3d at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   1204 (citing\n   <em>\n    Fogarty v.

Here, as well then, every reasonable official would have understood that tasering Shane repeatedly was disproportionate under the circumstances and unreasonable. The two-part test to overcome qualified immunity has been fulfilled with respect to Officer Neagle's use of force against Shane.

The City responds that its officers are sufficiently trained in that it provides (1) annual training on its use-of-force policy, which directs officers to take into account the subject's mental state and capacity; (2) updates on that policy through daily training bulletins; and (3) a 40-hour crisis intervention training on how to identify and interact with persons with mental illness. The City maintains then that its training policy could not have been the moving force behind any constitutional deprivation. It further asserts that the Frenches have not demonstrated it acted with deliberate indifference or that the single incident on February 14, 2014, can sustain their claim.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-133\">\n   The direct causal link between the policy and the constitutional violations alleged here are evident. The Frenches have presented evidence that there was a negative impression of Shane within the Police Department related to his mental illness and that at least Officer Eubanks could not identify any training or skills he had obtained that would aid him in identifying and interacting with mentally ill persons. Implicit in the obligation to train officers is verifying that the training has been learned and implemented. If the Department generally had a better understanding of mental illness and had administered sufficient training for its officers, perhaps the officers would have received more specific information regarding Shane's state on February 14, 2014; would not have banged so loudly on the French door or burst through it; would not have tackled and repeatedly tased Shane; would have explained the situation to him and given him warnings; and would have sought mental health treatment for him.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-134\">\n   Police encounters with individuals struggling with mental illness are not some theoretical occurrence. The National Institute\n   of Mental Health reports that nearly one in five adults in the U.S. lives with mental illness.\n   <footnotemark>\n    23\n   </footnotemark>\n   Countless articles and studies have been dedicated to the treatment of mentally ill individuals by law enforcement and the criminal justice system, many documenting the abuses suffered by such individuals.\n   <footnotemark>\n    24\n   </footnotemark>\n   While the Cortez Police Department provides some training to its officers, the facts presented by the Frenches show that this training was ineffective and insufficient. As a result, the Frenches have established the City acted with deliberate indifference to the constitutional rights of its inhabitants as \"the need for more or different training is so obvious, and the inadequacy so likely to result in the violation of constitutional rights.\"\n   <em>\n    City of Canton\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12032186\" index=\"267\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/489/378/#p390\">\n    489 U.S. at 390\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12032186\" index=\"268\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/489/378/#p390\">\n    109 S.Ct. 1197\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-135\">\n   With respect to the City's argument that it cannot be held liable based on a single incident, I agree with the Frenches that the facts cited are not limited to one event. Chief Lane confirmed that an attitude developed over time regarding Shane and his mental struggles. The mindset was so pervasive that it permitted at least five officers to stand by while Shane was repeatedly tased as he told them he had mental problems.

The likelihood that the situation will recur and the predictability that an officer lacking specific tools to handle that situation will violate citizens' rights could justify a finding that policymakers' decision not to train the officer reflected \"deliberate indifference\" to the obvious consequence of the policymakers' choice-namely, a violation of a specific constitutional or statutory right.

Based on the evidence put forward by the Frenches, this case fits squarely within those narrow circumstances. It was and is likely that Cortez police officers will encounter mentally ill individuals and that, if the officers do not receive adequate training, the individuals' Fourth Amendment rights will be violated.
