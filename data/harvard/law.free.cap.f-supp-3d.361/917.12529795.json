SHAW, UNITED STATES DISTRICT JUDGE\n  </author>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   This matter is before the Court on defendant Bi-State Development Agency of\n   the Missouri-Illinois Metropolitan District's (\"defendant\") motion to dismiss plaintiff's third amended complaint under Rule 12(b)(1), Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, for lack of standing, and Rule 12(b)(6), Fed. R. Civ. P., for failure to state a claim upon which relief can be granted. Plaintiff Scott Gustafson (\"plaintiff\") opposes the motion to dismiss and it is fully briefed. For the following reasons, the motion will be granted as to plaintiff's Missouri Human Rights Act (\"MHRA\") claims in Counts I and II, and denied as moot as to plaintiff's Americans with Disabilities Act claims in Count III.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   <strong>\n    I. Background\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   The complaint alleges plaintiff is a visually impaired resident of Missouri who relies on a guide dog to navigate his surroundings, audio formats to decipher text, and screen-reading software to interpret electronic content on his computer and smart phone. Defendant is an entity which provides public transportation services, including the MetroBus and Metrolink, in Missouri and Illinois. In conjunction with providing transportation services, defendant operates a website, www.metrostlouis.org (\"website\"), and a mobile application, \"Metro On the Go\" (\"mobile app\"). The website and mobile app provide the general public with information regarding defendant's services, such as trip planning assistance, map routes, schedules, rider alerts, ticketing, and bus stop locations.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   Plaintiff alleges he was discriminated against on the basis of his vision disability because defendant denied him equal access to public transportation systems and services by failing to: (1) design, implement, and maintain a website and mobile app that can be used independently by visually impaired individuals; (2) transport plaintiff and his guide dog on December 26, 2013, June 13, 2014, and August 5, 2014; (3) properly identify the location of bus stops and ticket sales equipment at MetroLink stations; (4) discontinue use of inaudible fare boxes and ticket vending machines; (5) discontinue use of machinery requiring precise placement of paper bills and coins; (6) maintain audio equipment that clearly and consistently plays announcements on the MetroLink and MetroBus, including route identifications and stops; (7) issue fare cards that can be interpreted by visually impaired individuals; and (8) properly train employees on how to effectively transport and communicate with visually impaired individuals.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   Plaintiff's third amended complaint includes four claims against defendant: public accommodation discrimination in violation of the MHRA, \u00a7 213.065, Mo. Rev. Stat. (2010) (Count I); unlawful discriminatory practices in violation of the MHRA, \u00a7 213.070(3) (Count II); denial of access to governmental services, programs, and activities in violation of Title II of the Americans with Disabilities Act,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%2012101\">\n    42 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 12101\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    etseq.\n   </em>\n   (\"ADA\") (Count III); and failure to provide accommodations and access to information in violation of Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=29%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20794\">\n    29 U.S.C. \u00a7 794\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (\"Rehab Act\") (Count IV).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   In its motion to dismiss, defendant argues that plaintiff's state law claims under the MHRA should be dismissed pursuant to Rule 12(b)(6), Fed. R. Civ. P., because it is not subject to the MHRA due to its interstate compact status, and it is not a \"person\" that can violate \u00a7 213.065 of the MHRA. Defendant further argues that plaintiff's ADA claims should be dismissed pursuant to Rule 12(b)(1), Fed. R. Civ. P., for lack of standing. Defendant additionally argues that plaintiff is not entitled to monetary damages under the ADA and all allegations arising from the inaccessibility of its website and mobile app are not subject to the ADA because these electronic services do not qualify as places of\n   public accommodation. Defendant does not seek dismissal of plaintiff's Rehab Act claim.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   In its reply memorandum, defendant withdraws its motion to dismiss plaintiff's ADA claims, including all corresponding arguments related to lack of standing, monetary damages, and public accommodation. Defendant maintains its position that the Court should dismiss plaintiff's MHRA claims. Thus, the Court will only address the portion of defendant's motion to dismiss relating to plaintiff's MHRA claims under Rule 12(b)(6) for failure to state a claim upon which relief can be granted, and will deny the motion as moot with respect to plaintiff's ADA claims.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   <strong>\n    II. Legal Standard\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   The purpose of a motion to dismiss for failure to state a claim is to test the legal sufficiency of the complaint.

The motion is\n   <strong>\n    DENIED\n   </strong>\n   as\n   <strong>\n    moot\n   </strong>\n   as to plaintiff's ADA claims in Count III. [Doc. 14]\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   An order of partial dismissal will accompany this Memorandum and Order.\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-32\">\n    On August 28, 2017, the MHRA was amended and its standard for assessing claims of discrimination became analogous to that of the IHRA.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    <em>\n     Bram v. AT &amp; T Mobility Servs., LLC,\n    </em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12658563,12658564\" index=\"41\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/564/787/\">\n     564 S.W.3d 787\n    </extracted-citation>\n    , 794-95,\n    <extracted-citation index=\"42\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2018%20WL%206611594\">\n     2018 WL 6611594\n    </extracted-citation>\n    , at *4 (Mo. Ct. App. Dec. 8, 2018). However, the new standard under the MHRA does not apply retroactively to discriminatory conduct alleged prior to the amendment.\n    <em>\n     Id.\n    </em>\n    at 794-96,\n    <extracted-citation index=\"43\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2018%20WL%206611594\">\n     2018 WL 6611594\n    </extracted-citation>\n    at *4-5. Because plaintiff filed the instant case in state court on December 23, 2015 and the discriminatory conduct occurred prior to August 2017, the Court will apply the pre-amendment MHRA standard for assessing plaintiff's claims of discrimination.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n </opinion>\n</casebody>\n"
