Specifically, Burns contends that the substantial federal question in need of resolution, given the purported preemption of state law with respect to Medicare Advantage plans, is \"by what legal authority does the Insurance Commissioner of the State of Connecticut assert a right to take adjudicatory action which will ultimately impose additional or variant standards, conditions, limitations, restrictions or other requirements on the marketing and/or delivery of the MA Program?\" Notice \u00b6 47.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   A closer look at the relevant federal statutes shows that Burns is wrong about federal law preempting state law in the arena of Medicare Advantage marketing. He quotes 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1395w-26(b)(3) as support for his preemption argument: \"The standards established under this part shall supersede any State law or regulation (\n   <em>\n    other than State licensing laws\n   </em>\n   or State laws relating to plan solvency) with respect to MA plans which are offered by MA organizations under this part.\" Burns Mem. at 26 (emphasis added). The administrative complaint makes clear that it concerns a state licensing issue. Doc. 1-1 at 2. Burns also admits that federal regulations require him to \"hold a state-issued 'insurance-producer' license.\" Burns Mem. at 5;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   Doc. 11 at 9 (\"Plans/Part D Sponsors\n   <em>\n    must comply with applicable State licensure and/or appointment laws\n   </em>\n   when engaging with marketing representatives to sell Medicare products.\") (emphasis added). That the federal statutes and regulations have so clearly delegated licensing responsibility to the states wholly undermines Burns's position here. Without preemption, Burns is effectively arguing that the state of Connecticut does not have the authority to suspend or revoke a license-that the state issued to him in the first place-for violating state statutory laws. The Court sees no federal issues here.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   Congress explicitly left space for states to regulate the\n   <em>\n    marketing\n   </em>\n   of Medicare Advantage programs, and it is within this delegated space that the Department of Insurance operates. Because the assumption underlying Burns's proposed substantial federal question has no basis and the Court cannot identify any other federal questions, removal based upon\n   <extracted-citation index=\"45\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%201331\">\n    28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1331\n   </extracted-citation>\n   is unwarranted.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   <strong>\n    C. Timeliness of Removal\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   Although the Court has already rejected Burns's substantive arguments, it is worth noting that procedural limitations also prohibit the removal of this case from the Department of Insurance. \"The notice of removal of a civil action or proceeding shall be filed within 30 days after the receipt by the defendant, through service or otherwise, of a copy of the initial pleading setting forth the claim for relief upon which such action or proceeding is based, or within 30 days after the service of summons upon the defendant if such initial pleading has then been filed in court and is not required to be served on the defendant, whichever period is shorter.\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"46\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201446\">\n    28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1446\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (b)(1) (2018). Burns acknowledges receipt of the administrative complaint on August 13, 2018, meaning he generally needed to have filed the notice of removal before September 12, 2018.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Notice \u00b6 5. Instead, the notice was filed on September 28, 2018. Doc. 1-4 at 2.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   As noted by Burns, the Second Circuit has indeed held, albeit for diversity jurisdiction, that \"the 30-day period [does] not begin to run until the defendant received the first document from which all of the facts giving rise to removability were evident-i.e., the complaint.\"\n   <em>\n    Moltner v.

In support, he alleges that the administrative complaint fails (1) to allege the specific statutes implicated, (2) to state that the Commissioner is seeking to enforce federal guidelines or law, and (3) to aver any federal authority.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9495352\" index=\"50\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/261/196/#p206\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   At a superficial level, Burns is correct about the standard as applied to this case. It is true that the complaint does not set forth the bases for removal predicated upon federal question jurisdiction. Moreover, \"[t]he presence or absence of federal-question jurisdiction is governed by 'the well-pleaded complaint rule,' which provides that federal jurisdiction exists only when a federal question is presented on the face of the plaintiff's properly pleaded complaint.\"\n   <em>\n    Caterpillar Inc. v. Williams\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6214062\" index=\"51\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/482/386/#p392\">\n    482 U.S. 386\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 392,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6214062\" index=\"52\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/482/386/#p392\">\n    107 S.Ct. 2425\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"640953,6214062\" index=\"53\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/l-ed-2d/96/318/\">\n    96 L.Ed.2d 318\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1987). Because the administrative complaint does not set forth federal question jurisdiction, it is also true that the thirty-day period has not yet begun to run. As explained\n   <em>\n    infra\n   </em>\n   , however, federal question jurisdiction does not exist because the Department of Insurance is not implicating federal law when exercising powers incidental to its state licensing duties.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   If this Court had hypothetically found that there is federal question jurisdiction, it would have been because the administrative complaint had adequately established it. It then necessarily follows that the thirty-day period began with Burns's receipt of the complaint on August 13, 2018. Accordingly, even if federal question jurisdiction existed with respect to the Commissioner's state regulatory complaint, removal to this Court for adjudication is time-barred because the notice of removal was filed outside of the thirty-day removal period mandated by\n   <extracted-citation index=\"54\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201446\">\n    28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1446\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (b)(1).\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-49\">\n    Burns seemingly urges a broader interpretation for \"State court\" in Section 1442 than in Section 1441 by citing cases that generally state Section 1442 should be read expansively in light of the statute's purpose in protecting federal interests.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <em>\n     e.g.\n    </em>\n    , Burns Mem. at 10-11 (citing\n    <em>\n     Watson v.
