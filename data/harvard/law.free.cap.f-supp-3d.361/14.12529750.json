Finally, in 2000, after persistent efforts by the Koi Nation, the defendant, the United States Department of the Interior (\"DOI\"), acknowledged the \"egregious\" administrative mistake and reaffirmed the Koi Nation's status as a federally recognized tribe, without requiring the tribe to undergo a formal regulatory process to obtain the same result. In a stark example of the government giving with one hand and taking away with the other, DOI's correction of its own long-standing error is now being used by DOI as the basis to deny the Koi Nation's eligibility for an exception to a statutory prohibition on gaming on Indian land, set out in the Indian Gaming Regulatory Act (\"IGRA\"),\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=25%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%202701\">\n    25 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 2701\n   </extracted-citation>\n   <em>\n    et seq.\n   </em>\n   , the law that \"prescribes the conditions under which Indian tribes may engage in commercial gaming on their reservations,\"\n   <em>\n    City of Roseville v.

The Koi Nation supplemented this request with additional letters and supporting documents in December 2014, January 2016, July 2016, September 2016, and December 2016, all of which DOI treated as part of the Koi Nation's initial April 2014 request.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   AR at 1 n.2 (DOI 2017 Decision at 1 n.2).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-70\">\n   On January 19, 2017, DOI issued the challenged decision denying the Koi Nation's April 2014 request for a determination that it is \"an Indian tribe that is restored to Federal recognition\" for purposes of IGRA, as that exception is defined by the Part 292 regulations,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"125\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=25%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%20292\">\n    25 C.F.R. \u00a7 292\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

The defendants argue briefly, in a total of two paragraphs, that the Koi Nation's claims are \"unripe\" because, as a landless tribe, \"Interior cannot determine whether the 'restored lands' exception applies until a Tribe obtains a specific parcel of land and seeks to have that land taken into trust for gaming.\" Defs.'

In other words, the defendants have turned the justiciability of the Koi Nation's claims into a chicken and egg puzzle, in which the tribe would be required to obtain a parcel of\n   land before the tribe's claim to restored federally recognized status would be ripe for consideration. Setting land ownership as a prerequisite for the ripeness of a claim for a judicial resolution of a dispute over DOI's decision on the tribe's status is both untenable and incorrect, as demonstrated by DOI's own handling of the Koi Nation's 2014 request.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-88\">\n   DOI's 2017 Decision shows the flaw in the defendants' ripeness argument that DOI \"cannot determine\" whether the restored lands exception applies to the Koi Nation until the tribe obtains a parcel of land. DOI states in this decision that, \"I regret to inform you that in applying the regulations to your factual submission, I have determined that the Tribe doesn't satisfy the regulatory requirements to constitute a 'restored tribe,' pursuant to 292.10(b),\" and \"[a]lthough the Tribe has not submitted a fee-to-trust request for gaming purposes pursuant to IGRA's 'restored lands' exception, based on my determination today if the Tribe did submit such an application I would have no alternative but to deny it.\" AR at 1-2.

The fact that DOI has already made a final determination, applying the Part 292 regulations to the Koi Nation and concluding IGRA's restored lands exception is not available to the tribe, renders the Koi Nation's challenge to this decision ripe.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Nat'l Park Hosp.

As the defendants concede, the federal government treated the Koi Nation \"as if it had been terminated from approximately the time of the Lower Lake Act's enactment\" in 1956. AR at 3 (DOI 2017 Decision at 3). For decades, BIA repeatedly referred to the Koi Nation's status as a tribe whose federal recognition had been terminated, including in the 1970s, when BIA listed the Koi Nation as \"terminated\" pursuant to the Lower Lake Act,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   AR at 89-90, 93-94 (BIA 1975 Law Enforcement Manual at 1-2, 60-61); in the 1980s, when BIA declined to include the Koi Nation on the Federal Register list of federally recognized tribes,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   AR at 377-79 (BIA 1980 Memo); and, in 1995, when BIA denied the Koi Nation's application for tribal government grant funding because the Koi Nation did \"not appear in the February 16, 1995 Federal Register List of Indian entities recognized and eligible to receive services from\" BIA,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   AR at 95 (DOI 1995 Letter). The Koi Nation's original federal recognition,\n   <em>\n    de facto\n   </em>\n   termination, and reinstatement of recognition through reaffirmation by DOI's correction of the agency's long-standing, internal error, thus fits squarely within the plain meaning a tribe \"restored to Federal recognition\" under IGRA.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"322\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=25%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%202719\">\n    25 U.S.C. \u00a7 2719\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (b)(1)(B)(iii).\n   <footnotemark>\n    14\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-126\">\n   In addition to the plain meaning of the restored lands exception, two aspects of IGRA's structure indicate Congress's intent to include tribes like the Koi Nation, which were improperly treated as terminated and subsequently reaffirmed outside the Part 83 process, as tribes restored to federal recognition. First, \"the syntax of\" the restored lands exception, \"which discusses not simply the restoration of the lands themselves, but their restoration 'for an Indian tribe,' fits more comfortably\n   with the concept of restitution,\"\n   <em>\n    City of Roseville\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9070673,3703201\" index=\"323\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/348/1020/\">\n    348 F.3d at 1027\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , for decades of improper treatment as a terminated tribe. Second, Congress could have explicitly limited tribes \"restored to Federal recognition\" to those tribes recognized in a particular way, as reflected in the \"initial reservation\" exception to IGRA's prohibition on gaming on after-acquired lands, which immediately precedes the restored lands exception in Section 20.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"324\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=25%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%202719\">\n    25 U.S.C. \u00a7 2719\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (b)(1)(B)(ii).

This argument suffers from several flaws.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-137\">\n   First, this argument is predicated on the exaggerated notion that including the Koi Nation as a tribe \"restored to Federal recognition\" would allow \"unlimited use of restored land for gaming purposes.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   This premise is simply incorrect. A determination that the Koi Nation is a restored tribe is merely a first step since gaming under the restored lands exception also requires the Secretary to take land into trust, which is based on a number of factors.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    CETAC\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3506849,3564708\" index=\"370\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/492/460/\">\n    492 F.3d at 469\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (explaining that it is incorrect to suggest \"that a newly recognized tribe may select any piece of land for its casino site\" under IGRA's initial reservation exception because, \"under the IRA, the land must still be acquired in trust by the Secretary whose determination is based on a number of factors\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-138\">\n   Second, the defendants' conclusory argument fails to identify any evidence suggesting that other tribes would be harmed if the restored lands exception covers those tribes mistakenly treated as terminated and then reaffirmed administratively outside of the Part 83 Federal acknowledgment process. Indeed, the defendants have not disputed the Koi Nation's claim that it \"is the only tribe\" that was not federally recognized when IGRA was passed, subsequently reaffirmed, and then left without a determination that the tribe is \"restored\" for purposes of IGRA. Pl.'s Mem. at 25. The purported detrimental impact of one additional tribe potentially being able to game on \"restored lands,\" if any are acquired, on other tribes is highly speculative and falls far short of showing any impact at all, let alone one that is detrimental to Indian tribes generally.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-139\">\n   Finally, the D.C. Circuit has recognized that, by enacting IGRA, \"Congress's overarching intent was 'in large part to provide a statutory basis for the operation of gaming by Indian tribes as a means of promoting tribal economic development, self-sufficiency, and strong tribal governments' ... and to do so to ensure that the Indian tribe is the primary beneficiary of the gaming operation.\"\n   <em>\n    CETAC\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3506849,3564708\" index=\"371\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/492/460/\">\n    492 F.3d at 468\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (internal quotation marks and citations omitted).

Opp'n; Defs.' Reply. The two tribes identified by the Koi Nation as similarly situated share significant salient historical facts with the Koi Nation. The Grand Traverse Band after a period of recognition, was mistakenly treated as terminated for decades and then \"restored,\" for purposes of IGRA's restored lands exception, when the federal government recognized the tribe again, through the Part 83 Federal acknowledgment process.\n   <em>\n    Grand Traverse\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9248041,7345474\" index=\"398\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/369/960/\">\n    369 F.3d at 961-62, 972\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . The Ione Band, a recognized tribe that the federal government treated as terminated, became restored to federal recognition when DOI reaffirmed this tribe's status, outside the Part 83 Federal acknowledgment process, and directed BIA to include the Ione Band on the Federal Register list of federally recognized tribes, so that the Ione Band was eligible to receive the federal services and benefits afforded to recognized Indian tribes.\n   <em>\n    Cty. of Amador\n   </em>\n   , 872 F.3d at 1018, 1028. Based on this historical record, the Koi Nation asserts that, just like the Grand Traverse Band and the Ione Band, it was recognized, treated as terminated, and then recognized again, and, more particularly, just like the Ione Band, the Koi Nation's federally recognized status occurred through reaffirmation by DOI rather than through the Part 83 Federal acknowledgment process.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-155\">\n   The defendants try to distinguish the histories of both comparator tribes. According to the defendants, unlike the Koi Nation, the Grand Traverse Band re-attained recognition through the Part 83 Federal acknowledgment process and thus satisfies the Part 292 criteria to be considered \"restored\" under IGRA.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"399\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=25%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%20292.10\">\n    25 C.F.R. \u00a7 292.10\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (b). Of course, the Koi Nation tried to invoke, but was denied access to, the Part 83 Federal acknowledgment process.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   AR at 293 (DOI 2000 Recognition Memo at 4). Nevertheless, in the defendants' view, differential treatment of the tribes is warranted because the Koi Nation's recognition was reaffirmed through a waiver of the Part 83 Federal acknowledgment process, which waiver was premised on DOI's finding in 2000 that the tribe's government-to-government relationship never terminated.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"400\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=25%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%20292.10\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-156\">\n   The defendants' myopic focus on the different means by which the Koi Nation and the Grand Traverse Band achieved restoration of their federally recognized status overlooks the similarities in how both tribes lost that status. As the Sixth Circuit explained with respect to the\n   Grand Traverse Band, \"[t]here is no dispute that only Congress had the\n   <em>\n    legal right\n   </em>\n   to terminate\" the Grand Traverse Band's recognized status, but the federal government severed the government-to-government relationship with the tribe when the executive branch \"acted as if\" the Grand Traverse Band's recognition had been terminated, denying the tribe federal services for over a century.\n   <em>\n    Grand Traverse\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9248041,7345474\" index=\"401\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/369/960/\">\n    369 F.3d at 968\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (emphasis in original). The Koi Nation's recognized status was\n   <em>\n    de facto\n   </em>\n   terminated in the same way, due to the federal government's mistaken treatment of the tribe as terminated. To the extent that DOI views the Koi Nation's recognized status as never actually terminated, the Grand Traverse Band is in precisely the same position, but nevertheless was afforded the Part 83 process.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-157\">\n   DOI's reaffirmation of the recognized status of both the Koi Nation and the Grand Traverse Band, after years of mistaken terminated treatment, through different administrative methods does not lessen that similarity. Therefore, treating the Koi Nation differently due to DOI's reaffirmation of the tribe's status, rather than under the Part 83 Federal acknowledgment process, violates\n   <extracted-citation index=\"402\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=25%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%205123\">\n    25 U.S.C. \u00a7 5123\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (f)'s prohibition against treating similarly situated recognized tribes differently.

Reg. at 29363 (Section 20 Final Rule). \"Congress clearly understood the part 83 process because it created an exception [in IGRA] for tribes acknowledged through the part 83 process.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Due to the extant Part 83 Federal acknowledgment process and this process's purpose, DOI \"believe[d] that in 1988 Congress did not intend to include within the restored tribe exception these pre-1979 ad hoc determination[s].\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Even if DOI's reasoning were correct about \"pre-1979 ad hoc determinations\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-167\">\n   of recognized status not being covered by IGRA's restored lands exception, the Koi Nation's recognized status was reaffirmed much later, in 2000, AR at 293 (DOI 2000 Recognition Memo at 4), after the tribe's effort to be included on the Federal Register list of federally recognized tribes was denied in 1980, AR at 377-79 (BIA 1980 Memo).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-168\">\n   In any event, DOI's conclusion that Congress when enacting IGRA sought, without any textual reference or express limitation in Section 20's restored lands exception, to exclude tribes recognized outside the Part 83 Federal acknowledgment process, simply because that process was extant at the time of IGRA's enactment, takes a leap too far. As already noted,\n   <em>\n    see supra\n   </em>\n   Section III.C.1, Congress was perfectly capable of limiting a Section 20 exception to tribes administratively recognized only in the Part 83 process and did so in another exception,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"423\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=25%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%202719\">\n    25 U.S.C. \u00a7 2719\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (b)(1)(B)(ii), but not in the restored lands exception.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-169\">\n   DOI's second reason for the policy change to exclude from IGRA's restored lands exception any tribe administratively recognized outside the Part 83 Federal acknowledgment process fares no better. This second reason relied on a single congressional finding in the 1994 List Act that referenced \"only the part 83 procedures as the process for administrative recognition.\" 73 Fed.

Reg. at 29363 (Section 20 Final Rule), runs counter to policies articulated in other congressional findings for, and the actual text of, the List Act. Among the List Act's eight congressional findings, are findings that emphasize the statute's ultimate goal of maintaining an \"accurate, regularly updated, and regularly published\" list of federally recognized tribes, regardless of how those tribes came to be recognized, because the Federal Register list \"is used by the various departments and agencies of the United States to determine the eligibility of certain groups to receive services from the United States.\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"430\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=25%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%205130\">\n    25 U.S.C. \u00a7 5130\n   </extracted-citation>\n   notes (Congressional Findings \u00b6 7);\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"431\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=25%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%205130\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   (Congressional Findings \u00b6 8) (stating the Federal Register list of federally recognized tribes \"should reflect all of the federally recognized Indian tribes in the United\n   States which are eligible for the special programs and services provided by the United States to Indians because of their status as Indians\"). This stress on accuracy carries over to the text of the List Act, which directs the DOI Secretary to publish regularly the Federal Register List of \"all Indian tribes\" which are \"recognize[d] ... because of their status as Indians.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"432\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=25%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%205130\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 5131(a).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-171\">\n   Thus, every effort by DOI to identify, correctly and promptly, federally recognized tribes, whether through the Part 83 process or though administrative correction of the agency's erroneous treatment of a tribe outside that process, promotes the expressed purpose, goals and efficacy of the List Act. In fact, DOI's correction, in 2000, of the agency's erroneous treatment of the Koi Nation's status through the agency's waiver of the Part 83 process and reaffirmation of the tribe's recognized status, \"was intended to rectify a past wrong, without litigation or utilizing the Part 83 acknowledgement process,\" AR at 6 (DOI 2017 Decision at 6), and provided a prompt correction of the Federal Register list of federally recognized tribes with the addition of the Koi Nation. Encouraging DOI to correct its own mistakes and thereby avoid the comparatively lengthy alternative methods of federal recognition, through congressional action, court order predicated on litigation, or the Part 83 administrative process, is wholly consistent with the over-arching goals of the List Act, and more sensible public policy than discouraging such agency self-correction.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-172\">\n   By contrast, excluding from the restored lands exception reaffirmed tribes, such as the Koi Nation, that had been incorrectly left off the Federal Register list of federally recognized tribes, penalizes such tribes, discouraging them from seeking correction of agency errors regarding evaluation of a tribe's status outside the Part 83 process, and thereby undermines the strong public policy interests reflected in the List Act to have DOI strive for correct and accurate decision-making with respect to federally recognized tribes. In this way, the defendants' position here is antithetical to the purpose animating the List Act of maintaining an accurate, up-to-date list of federally recognized tribes.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-173\">\n   DOI's gaps in reasoning for the agency's interpretation of the restored lands exception, which purported to make the exception harmonious with the List Act, renders the agency's explanation for\n   <extracted-citation index=\"433\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=25%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%20292.10\">\n    25 C.F.R. \u00a7 292.10\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (b) arbitrary and capricious and the challenged regulation itself invalid.

Since the Grand Traverse Band and Ione Band are already deemed restored, the defendants' concern about including the Koi Nation as a restored tribe, pursuant to \u00a7 5123(f)'s privileges and immunities clause, appears over-blown since this new class of purportedly \"preferred\" tribes is a class that already exists.
