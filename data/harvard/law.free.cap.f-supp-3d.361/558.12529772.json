DEVER III, United States District Judge\n  </author>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   On October 17, 2017, Lenton Credelle Brown (\"Brown\" or \"plaintiff\"), a pro se plaintiff proceeding in forma pauperis [D.E. 1, 4], filed a complaint against Goodwill Industries of Eastern North Carolina, Inc. (\"defendant\" or \"Goodwill\") alleging violations of Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 2000e\n   <em>\n    etseq\n   </em>\n   . (\"Title VII\") [D.E. 5]. On December 4, 2017, Goodwill moved to dismiss Brown's complaint for failure to state a claim [D.E. 12]. On May 29, 2018, the court dismissed Brown's complaint without prejudice [D.E. 20].\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   On June 29, 2018, Brown filed an amended complaint [D.E. 21]. On July 9, 2018, Brown moved to submit an amended complaint that conformed to the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure [D.E. 24]. On August 3, 2018, Goodwill moved to dismiss Brown's amended complaint for failure to state a claim [D.E. 25] and filed a memorandum in support [D.E. 26]. On November 2, 2018, Brown responded in opposition [D.E. 32]. On November 26, 2018, Goodwill replied [D.E. 35]. As explained below, the court grants Goodwill's motion and dismisses the amended complaint without prejudice for failure to state a claim upon which relief can be granted, and grants Brown's motion to file another amended complaint.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   I.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   On March 3, 2016, Brown, an African-American male, began working for Goodwill as a part-time retail manager at a Goodwill store in Kinston, North Carolina.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Compl. [D.E. 5] 2; Def.'s Ex. 1 [D.E. 13-1] 1; Am. Compl. [D.E. 21] 2, 5. Brown worked at the store with Keisha (\"Keisha\"), his co-manager, Julia Cunningham (\"Cunningham\"), and Keotta Williams (\"Williams\").\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   [D.E. 21] 1. On July 29, 2016, Brown observed Cunningham, a white female, talking on her cell phone to her boyfriend instead of working.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   [D.E. 5] 3, 8; Def.'s Ex. 1 [D.E. 13-1] 1; [D.E. 21] 2, 9. Brown reported Cunningham for \"stealing time on the clock.\" [D.E. 21] 2.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   Cunningham was \"friends both inside and outside of work\" with Williams and Brown's co-manager, Keisha. [D.E. 5] 4;\n   <em>\n    cf.\n   </em>\n   [D.E. 21] 2. When Goodwill hired Brown, Brown alleges that the district manager \"warned [him] about how [Cunningham, Williams, and Keisha] set people up.\" [D.E. 5] 7; [D.E. 21] 10. After Brown reported to the district manager that Cunningham had been talking on her cell phone while on the clock, Brown alleges that Williams and Keisha made false complaints against him, including Williams \"accus[ing] Brown of harassing her\n   <em>\n    in retaliation\n   </em>\n   [for reporting Cunningham].\" [D.E. 21] 9-10;\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   [D.E. 5] 6-7; [D.E. 21] 1. For example, Williams claimed that Brown threatened to fire her if she \"exposed certain safety violations.\" [D.E. 21] 4. Nevertheless, Williams reported several concerns for customer and employee safety to the district manager, including \"customers shopping in waste all day,\" \"a little boy [who] had a nose bleed near the toy section\" that was not promptly cleaned, and an incident involving unidentified \"red spots\" on dollar bills. [D.E. 5] at 5-6, 8-10;\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   [D.E. 21] 4, 8-10. Brown calls these\n   reports \"bogus.\" [D.E. 5] 5, 8; [D.E. 21] 2, 8. Brown also mentions that Williams reported Brown for \"looking through the glass portion of a door\" to observe the sales floor, something that Williams perceived as harassment. [D.E. 21] 5.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   Goodwill investigated Williams's and Keisha's claims concerning Brown. Brown contends that Goodwill's investigation into Williams's complaint against Brown was \"biased and racist.\" [D.E. 5] 7-8, 11; [D.E. 21] 10. For example, Brown contends that Charles Bailey, Goodwill's Head of Compliance, never interviewed Brown concerning Williams's allegations because Brown is an African-American male.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   [D.E. 21] 2-3, 6 (comparing Goodwill's investigation concerning Brown with Goodwill's investigation of \"Cheryl, a light skinned female who was also accused of harassment\"). Additionally, Brown alleges that Goodwill never advised him about his rights, never told him how to file a complaint with Goodwill internally, never gave him \"the opportunity to appeal the decision,\" and never informed of the charges against him.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 10-11. On August 2 or 3, 2016, based on the investigation, Goodwill terminated Brown's employment.\n   <em>\n    Compare\n   </em>\n   [D.E. 5] 2 (alleging termination date of August 3, 2016),\n   <em>\n    with\n   </em>\n   Def.'s Ex. 1 [D.E. 13-1] 1 (alleging termination date of August 2, 2016). According to Brown, he reported Cunningham's cell phone violation in good faith, and \"[i]t is against [Goodwill] policy to retaliate against any emp[l]oyee for good faith reporting of violations of the Code of Conduct.\" [D.E. 5] 7; [D.E. 21] 10.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   On October 3, 2016, Brown filed a discrimination charge with the EEOC, claiming retaliatory discharge and discrimination on the basis of race and in violation of Title VII. [D.E. 13-1] 1. On July 17, 2017, the EEOC issued Brown a notice of dismissal and right to sue.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 2-3. On May 29, 2018, the court dismissed Brown's complaint pursuant to Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 12(b)(6) for failure to state a claim upon which relief could be granted [D.E. 20]. On June 29, 2018, Brown filed an amended complaint.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   [D.E. 21].\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   II.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   A motion to dismiss under Rule 12(b)(6) tests the complaint's legal and factual sufficiency.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Ashcroft v.

Brown alleges that Keisha assisted Cunningham \"in stealing time on the clock,\" knew that \"Cunningham was mixing prescription drugs and alcohol and was running around partying with her,\" lied to the district manager, and had \"a history of setting people up and costing people their jobs.\" [D.E. 21] 2; [D.E. 32] 4. Brown fails to allege how Keisha's alleged misconduct is similarly severe to his alleged misconduct. Moreover, Brown fails to identify any individuals that Keisha set up or explain the circumstances surrounding those individuals' terminations. Finally, Brown fails to allege what, if any, disciplinary action Goodwill took against Keisha; therefore, the court cannot compare Brown's termination with any disciplinary action taken against Keisha. Accordingly, Keisha is not an appropriate comparison.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   As for Cheryl, Brown fails to allege the nature of and circumstances surrounding the disciplinary action taken against Cheryl. Brown alleges only that Goodwill investigated Cheryl, a while female, for harassment.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   [D.E. 32] 4-5, 7. Brown's allegations do not plausibly show that Cheryl engaged in similarly serious misconduct. Brown also fails to allege what, if any, disciplinary action Goodwill took against Cheryl. Brown only alleges that Goodwill investigators interviewed Cheryl about the allegations of harassment. Therefore, Brown does not plausibly allege that the disciplinary measures taken against him were more severe than those taken against Cheryl. Accordingly, Cheryl is not an appropriate comparison.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   As for Williams, Brown alleges in his response that Williams \"was allegedly part of a theft ring operating inside of the store.\" [D.E. 32] 9. Brown fails to allege that Goodwill knew of Williams's misconduct; therefore, Williams's alleged misconduct cannot be compared to Brown's misconduct. Stated differently, Brown does not allege that Goodwill knew of Williams's misconduct and affirmatively decided not to take disciplinary action against her. Therefore, Brown does not plausibly allege that Goodwill took more severe disciplinary action against Brown based on his conduct as compared to Williams's conduct. Accordingly, Williams is not an appropriate comparison.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   As for Frankie, Brown alleges that Frankie, \"the third highest paid individual in the store,\" was not disciplined for failing to clean up \"sewage and blood ... in a timely manner.\" [D.E. 32] 6. Brown does not allege, however, that Frankie engaged in similarly severe conduct as Brown's alleged harassment. Moreover, Brown fails to allege that Frankie is not in the same protected class as Brown. Accordingly, Frankie is not an appropriate comparison.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   Finally, Brown still fails to plausibly allege any facts that show that Goodwill was biased against him based on his race or sex in conducting its investigation concerning the complaint.
