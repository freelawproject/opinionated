HURD, United States District Judge\n  </author>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   <strong>\n    I.\n    <em>\n     INTRODUCTION\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   Acting on information from another drug investigation, an alphabet soup of state and federal law enforcement agencies spent the better part of the 2017 calendar year exploring whether defendant Abner Peralta (\"Peralta\" or \"defendant\") might be an additional conduit through which cocaine flowed into the Utica area.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   In October of that year, Drug Enforcement Agency (\"DEA\") Special Agent Ryan Phelan (\"Agent Phelan\") swore out an affidavit detailing how this joint state-federal task force had used physical and electronic surveillance to catalogue Peralta's movements and scrutinize his associates' behavior. Backed up with controlled buys from confidential sources, Agent Phelan described how he and his fellow agents unearthed an incriminating pattern of activity in which defendant played a central role.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   The strength of Agent Phelan's thirty-seven page affidavit convinced U.S. Magistrate Judge David E. Peebles to issue a warrant authorizing a search of Peralta's home, his vehicle, and another property frequented by him. When agents executed the warrant, they discovered evidence consistent with drug trafficking activity.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   Thereafter, a federal grand jury indicted defendant as a co-conspirator in a cocaine distribution ring, and with possession of cocaine base and of a firearm in furtherance of that criminal enterprise.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   Peralta contends the evidence against him must be suppressed because Agent Phelan's affidavit contains material inaccuracies and omissions that were either knowingly false or made with reckless disregard for the truth. The United States of America (the \"Government\") opposes the motion, which has been fully briefed. Oral argument was heard on December 20, 2018 in Utica, New York.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   Decision was reserved.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   <strong>\n    II.\n    <em>\n     BACKGROUND\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   In December of 2015, the DEA opened an investigation into a cocaine trafficking organization run out of the Utica area by a man named Julian Lucia-Cedano, better known by the alias \"Gilbert Rosa Sanchez.\" Aff. \u00b6 15. Over the next six months, federal agents wiretapped cell phones used by the Rosa-Sanchez organization and, by October of 2016, state and federal agents managed to arrest and charge ten of its members.\n   <em>\n    Id\n   </em>\n   . After several of these defendants agreed to exchange information for more favorable treatment, they identified Peralta as the head of another cocaine trafficking ring operating in the Utica area.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id\n   </em>\n   . \u00b6\u00b6 15-16 &amp; n.2.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   In January of 2017, law enforcement used this new information to open an investigation into Peralta. Aff. \u00b6\u00b6 17-18. Agents soon learned that defendant lives at 314 Richardson Avenue in Utica, a two-story multi-dwelling house with a detached garage in the back.\n   <em>\n    Id\n   </em>\n   . \u00b6\u00b6 9, 18-20. Surveillance at that address established that defendant owns a 2012 white Mercedes-Benz SUV and a 2016 white Honda Accord bearing New York license plate HCX-7741.\n   <em>\n    Id\n   </em>\n   . \u00b6 21.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   On May 30, 2017, at about 9:08 p.m., agents watched Peralta leave his house, get into the Mercedes-Benz SUV parked in the driveway, and drive to an address on Thomas Street in Utica to meet a man referred to by agents as \"Individual 2.\" Aff. \u00b6\u00b6 9, 23-24. Agents observed defendant leave a few minutes later.\n   <em>\n    Id\n   </em>\n   . \u00b6 24. According to Agent Phelan's affidavit, this is an instance in which defendant delivered a quantity of cocaine to Individual 2.\n   <em>\n    Id\n   </em>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   This conclusion is based, at least in part, on the fact that other cocaine sales executed by other parties are connected to Individual 2 and the Thomas Street location. Aff. \u00b6 24. For instance, in June of 2017 agents used a confidential source (\"CS # 2\") to make two controlled purchases of cocaine from \"Individual 1,\" another suspect in the ongoing investigation.\n   <em>\n    Id\n   </em>\n   . On both occasions, Individual 1 entered the Thomas Street building just before making each drug sale.\n   <em>\n    Id\n   </em>\n   . \u00b6\u00b6 38-42 (detailing a June 9 sale);\n   <em>\n    id\n   </em>\n   . \u00b6\u00b6 43-44 (detailing a June 30 sale).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   The affidavit also alleged Peralta has delivered cocaine to Luis Colon (\"Colon\"), a co-defendant charged in the indictment in this case. Aff. \u00b6\u00b6 28-29. Among other things, the affidavit explained that agents had previously intercepted evidence that Colon obtained cocaine from members of the Rosa-Sanchez organization.\n   <em>\n    Id\n   </em>\n   . \u00b6 28. Just as with the two Thomas Street sales connected to Individual 1, the affidavit established\n   defendant's alleged criminal relationship with Colon through a series of intermediate steps.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id\n   </em>\n   . \u00b6\u00b6 25, 28-29.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   First, on June 9, 2017, at about 2:30 p.m., Agent Phelan followed Colon as he left the Black Cat Bar &amp; Grill, took a call on his cell phone, and then drove to Peralta's house. Aff. \u00b6\u00b6 25-26. From there, Colon waited about four minutes until defendant showed up in his white Honda Accord.\n   <em>\n    Id\n   </em>\n   . \u00b6 27.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   Agent Phelan then watched as Peralta got out of his own car, walked toward the detached garage located in the back of the house, returned a few minutes later, and \"walked toward the passenger side door\" of Colon's car. Aff. \u00b6 27. After about two minutes, defendant walked away from Colon's car and Colon drove away.\n   <em>\n    Id\n   </em>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   Second, later that week agents used another confidential source (\"CS # 1\") to make a controlled buy of cocaine from Colon. Aff. \u00b6 29. On that occasion, agents followed Colon to Peralta's house and, \"immediately\" after Colon left the residence, Colon returned to his own house and sold the cocaine to CS # 1.\n   <em>\n    Id\n   </em>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   That same week, on July 12 and 13, agents watched Peralta pull into the driveway of the Thomas Street address in his white Honda Accord, stay for a few minutes, and then leave. Aff. \u00b6\u00b6 30-32, 46-47. The affidavit alleged these were two examples of defendant delivering drugs to Colon and Individual 2, who in turn sold the product to other end users.\n   <em>\n    Id\n   </em>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   On August 18, 2017, at about 2:54 p.m., agents covering Peralta's house watched him greet and shake hands with a co-worker of Employee 1, an employee at \"Carbone Auto Group\" known to law enforcement as a person who \"frequently sen[t] other employees of [Carbone] to pick up cocaine\" from Rosa-Sanchez group members. Aff. \u00b6\u00b6 33-35.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   On September 12, 2017, at about 10:50 a.m., real-time tracking data indicated that Peralta's white Honda Accord was near 1316/1318 Catherine Street, a three-story multi-dwelling residence in Utica.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   Aff. \u00b6\u00b6 9, 54. At about 11:00 a.m., agents saw defendant's car parked in the Catherine Street building's driveway with its trunk open.\n   <em>\n    Id\n   </em>\n   . \u00b6 54. At that time, an unknown white male was standing next to the car \"holding a book bag around his shoulder.\"\n   <em>\n    Id\n   </em>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   On September 15, 2017, at about 12:05 p.m. the tracking data indicated Peralta's white Honda Accord had returned to the Catherine Street building. Aff. \u00b6 56. Three minutes later, the vehicle drove straight to the Thomas Street address, where agents picked up visual surveillance.\n   <em>\n    Id\n   </em>\n   . The white Honda Accord drove away a few minutes later.\n   <em>\n    Id\n   </em>\n   . Agent Phelan alleged defendant delivered cocaine to Individual 2 at the Thomas Street address at this time.\n   <em>\n    Id\n   </em>\n   . Later that afternoon, around 3:16 p.m., agents watched defendant exit the side door of the Catherine Street building carrying a dark backpack, which he placed in the back seat of the car.\n   <em>\n    Id\n   </em>\n   . \u00b6 57.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   During the week of September 15, 2017, agents set up a larger cocaine purchase from Individual 1 using CS # 2. Aff. \u00b6 48. Before the deal went down, CS # 2 told the agents that Individual 1 advised him to make contact using a new telephone number.\n   <em>\n    Id\n   </em>\n   . At around 10:22 a.m., a woman believed to be an associate of Individual 1\n   called CS # 2 from this new phone number and told him she could not meet up to make a sale until around noon.\n   <em>\n    Id\n   </em>\n   . \u00b6 49. Eventually, CS # 2 received a follow-up phone call from the woman around 11:48 a.m., who instructed CS # 2 to meet her James and Clementian Streets in Utica.\n   <em>\n    Id\n   </em>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   At about 12:10 p.m., a black female exited the passenger side door of a brown Honda Accord parked in the driveway of the Thomas Street building.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   Aff. \u00b6 50. A few minutes later, CS # 2 showed up at the designated location.\n   <em>\n    Id\n   </em>\n   . \u00b6 51.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   The black female approached CS # 2's car on foot, walked to the passenger side door, and \"conducted a narcotics transaction.\" Aff. \u00b6 51. Agent Phelan alleged that the female bought the drugs from Individual 2 (since she had just exited his vehicle) and then immediately re-sold them to CS # 2.\n   <em>\n    Id\n   </em>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   On September 22, 2017, at about 4:54 p.m., agents parked outside the Catherine Street building saw Peralta and another man exit the side door and walk toward Peralta's white Honda Accord. Aff. \u00b6 58. According to the agents, defendant carried a black bag with him into the vehicle.\n   <em>\n    Id\n   </em>\n   . The agents followed defendant back to his house, where he exited the vehicle carrying the black bag toward the garage in back.\n   <em>\n    Id\n   </em>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   Shortly thereafter, at about 5:33 p.m., Agent Phelan watched Employee 1 pull up in front of defendant's house in a gray Honda Accord, exit the car, and walk around the back toward the detached garage. Aff. \u00b6\u00b6 36, 59. At about 5:42 p.m., the pair \"appeared in front\" of the house, spent some time talking, and then Employee 1 walked toward his car and drove away.\n   <em>\n    Id\n   </em>\n   . \u00b6 59.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   Agent Phelan alleged that on this occasion Peralta moved a quantity of drugs from his stash house in the Catherine Street building using the black bag and then brought them to his home, where he in turn sold them to Employee 1. Aff. \u00b6 60. Agent Phelan further alleged that telephone records analysis \"suggests\" that Employee 1 and defendant communicate \"frequently.\"\n   <em>\n    Id\n   </em>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   On October 4, 2017, based on these and other allegations in Agent Phelan's amended affidavit, Judge Peebles signed a search warrant that authorized, among other things, the search of (1) Peralta's house and its detached garage; (2) the Catherine Street building; and (3) the white Honda Accord. When agents executed the searches just over a week later, they recovered several firearms as well as some cocaine, packaging materials, and other related paraphernalia.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   <strong>\n    III.\n    <em>\n     DISCUSSION\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   Peralta's suppression motion is premised on\n   <em>\n    Franks v. Delaware\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1769234\" index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/438/154/\">\n    438 U.S. 154\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1769234\" index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/438/154/\">\n    98 S.Ct. 2674\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1769234\" index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/438/154/\">\n    57 L.Ed.2d 667\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1978), a case in which the Supreme Court held that the Fourth Amendment entitles a defendant to a hearing if he or she can make a \"substantial preliminary showing\" that one or more statements necessary to the magistrate's probable cause finding were either knowingly false or made with reckless disregard for the truth.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   Peralta contends he is entitled to suppression, or at the very least a\n   <em>\n    Franks\n   </em>\n   hearing, because Agent Phelan deliberately omitted or mischaracterized important contextual information. For instance, the affidavit alleged that agents observed defendant conduct \"hand-to-hand transactions\n   with known cocaine customers\" employed by Carbone Auto, but failed to disclose that defendant performed auto body work out of his detached garage, where he would occasionally meet with Carbone employees to pick up or drop off vehicles.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   Peralta also takes issue with Agent Phelan's description of his involvement with his co-defendant, Colon. Although the affidavit points toward Colon's sale of drugs to CS # 1 as being easily traceable back to him, defendant argues that Agent Phelan glossed over a crucial piece of the puzzle: Colon spent much of the day in question driving other places, visiting other people, and even making other drug sales before ever meeting up with defendant.\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   Peralta also faults Agent Phelan's description of the \"controlled buys\" with CS # 2. In particular, defendant argues the affidavit fails to assure the reviewing authority that these buys were completed using the appropriate practices, such as searching the informant before the drug transaction (to ensure the drugs later recovered were not already on their person) and maintaining constant surveillance throughout the process (to ensure the drugs were not sourced from elsewhere).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   Finally, Peralta complains that Agent Phelan omitted certain exculpatory information about the Catherine Street building, which defendant's company had purchased to use as a rental property. According to defendant, he and others were actively renovating it and therefore Agent Phelan's statements about the building \"being vacant,\" or \"observing unknown people carrying black backpacks\" in and out of it, are misleading.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   The Government responds that these innocent explanations for some of Peralta's activity, such as his assertion that he performed auto body work out of his detached garage or that he purchased the vacant Catherine Street building to renovate it, were not known to Agent Phelan at the time and would be insufficient to negate probable cause anyway.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   The Government recounts how the timing and frequency of Peralta's interactions with drug customers known from the Rosa-Sanchez investigation supply important context in which to view the other allegations made in the affidavit. In particular, the Government explains how agents worked backward to trace the movement of drugs between the Catherine Street building and the garage at defendant's home, where they were later passed off to Colon, to Employee 1, or sometimes delivered to the Thomas Street location.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   Peralta replies by insisting the affidavit's information about Thomas Street is a red herring, since none of the drug buys connected to that location involved him. According to defendant, the affidavit does nothing more than show that defendant visited that location a few times over the course of the year. And even that, according to defendant, is suspect, since the affidavit alleges only that \"a car\n   <em>\n    believed\n   </em>\n   to be Peralta's\" was present there. By that time, agents obviously knew defendant's license plate. So why the circumlocution?\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   The constitutional backdrop to this dispute is the Fourth Amendment and in\n   particular the Warrants Clause, which commands that \"no Warrants shall issue, but upon probable cause, supported by Oath or affirmation, and particularly describing the place to be searched, and the persons or things to be seized.\" U.S. Const. amend.
