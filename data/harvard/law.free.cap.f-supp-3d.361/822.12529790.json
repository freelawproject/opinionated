Plaintiffs allege Defendants Jerry Foxhoven, Richard Shults, and Mark Day maintain unconstitutional and illegal treatment\n   practices with respect to the juveniles at the School who have significant mental illnesses. Following the close of discovery, Defendants filed this Motion for Summary Judgment as to all of Plaintiffs' claims. [ECF No. 148]. The parties have not sought oral argument on Defendants' motion, and the Court finds the issues can be resolved without it.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   LR 7(c).

They are committed to the School after \"an average of six, eight, or ten failed previous placements.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Iowa%20Code%20%C2%A7%20232.52\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   These previous placements vary and include private residential placements and commitments to psychiatric medical institutions for children.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Iowa%20Code%20%C2%A7%20232.52\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Iowa%20Code%20%C2%A7%20232.52\">\n    at 2\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

Plaintiffs assert the students at the School \"have a significant need for mental health services.\" [ECF No. 163 \u00b6 4]. They claim that an estimated 90% of the students have a mental health diagnosis prior to arriving at the School; between 75% and 100% of the students have experienced trauma in some form; and over half of the students at the School are on psychotropic medication at any given time.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"8\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Iowa%20Code%20%C2%A7%20232.52\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   Defendants deny all of this.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"9\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Iowa%20Code%20%C2%A7%20232.52\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   Plaintiffs identify numerous ways in which the mental health care at the School allegedly falls below professional standards. After a review of the medical files of thirty-three students, including those of the Plaintiffs, Plaintiffs' expert found the School \"failed to conduct comprehensive mental health assessments, failed to complete mental health treatment plans, failed to provide necessary mental health treatment, and failed to provide appropriate medication oversight.\" [ECF No. 155 at 13]. Although it is not necessary for the purpose of this Order to discuss these alleged failings in detail, they can be summarized as follows. Plaintiffs allege the School has insufficient staff to meet the\n   mental health care needs of the students, including qualified staff to provide basic therapy and mental health crises services.\n   <em>\n    See\n    <extracted-citation index=\"10\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Iowa%20Code%20%C2%A7%20232.52\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"10\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Iowa%20Code%20%C2%A7%20232.52\">\n    at 13, 15\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . The School does not provide adequate individual psychotherapy, and, consequently, is over-reliant on psychotropic medication as a primary treatment option.\n   <em>\n    See\n    <extracted-citation index=\"11\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Iowa%20Code%20%C2%A7%20232.52\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"11\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Iowa%20Code%20%C2%A7%20232.52\">\n    at 14\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Plaintiffs also allege the School fails to adequately screen for mental health issues, develop adequate treatment plans, and adopt adequate oversight for the systems that support necessary mental health care.\n   <em>\n    See\n    <extracted-citation index=\"12\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Iowa%20Code%20%C2%A7%20232.52\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"12\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Iowa%20Code%20%C2%A7%20232.52\">\n    at 13\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Defendants contest these conclusions and the standards on which they are based.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   At various times, Defendants have been made aware of potential deficiencies with the mental health care services at the School. Defendant Mark Day, the Superintendent of the School, has made various statements concerning the School's lack of adequate resources to meet the mental health care needs of its students.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   [ECF No. 163 \u00b6 93]. As early as 2015, the School's \"long-time psychologist,\" Dr. Augspurger, informed Day that he needed \"additional support to serve the students\" at the School.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"13\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Iowa%20Code%20%C2%A7%20232.52\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"13\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Iowa%20Code%20%C2%A7%20232.52\">\n    \u00b6 94\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . In 2015, Day and Dr. Heilbrun (an outside consultant) informed Defendant Richard Shults-the Administrator of the Division of Mental Health and Disability Services-of the School's need for additional psychiatric staffing.\n   <em>\n    See\n    <extracted-citation index=\"14\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Iowa%20Code%20%C2%A7%20232.52\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"14\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Iowa%20Code%20%C2%A7%20232.52\">\n    \u00b6\u00b6 102, 104\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

The School has recently made additional hires related to these services, but the parties dispute the motivations behind these hires and their impact on the adequacy of the mental health care services offered at the School.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   [ECF No. 158 \u00b6 24].\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   Defendants argue the School \"is not a secure facility overall,\" but it does contain one secure building with single occupancy rooms, Corbett Miller Hall (\"CMH\"). [ECF No. 148-1 at 3]. CMH is a secure residential building with twenty-four individual locked rooms measuring fifty-four square feet. [ECF No. 163 \u00b6 114]. The rooms are sparsely furnished, containing only a concrete slab on which can be placed a mattress; a narrow window; a sink; a toilet; and plastic shelving.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"16\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Iowa%20Code%20%C2%A7%20232.52\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   Within CMH is a wing of twelve such rooms called the Behavioral Stabilization Unit (the \"BSU\"). The BSU is used as a \"segregation unit\" for \"solitary confinement.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"17\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Iowa%20Code%20%C2%A7%20232.52\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"17\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Iowa%20Code%20%C2%A7%20232.52\">\n    \u00b6 115\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   Defendants claim the BSU is meant to be a \"short term intervention,\" typically lasting one hour or less, which allows students to \"de-escalate in a safe and segregated setting.\" [ECF No. 158 \u00b6 28]. However, Plaintiffs assert students are \"commonly paced in the BSU for more than [one] hour.\" [ECF No. 158 \u00b6 28]. They claim that, from May 2016 to May 2017, the average time in solitary confinement ranged from 6.7 to 15.5 hours.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"18\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Iowa%20Code%20%C2%A7%20232.52\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   Defendant Day admitted in a deposition that a student could be held in the BSU \"for a series of days.\" [ECF No. 163 \u00b6 131]. The School's BSU policy states that the BSU \"will be utilized when the student's behaviors are such that the safety or security of other students or staff is threatened.\" [ECF No. 159-2 at 185]. However, that policy also allows students to be placed in the BSU for \"[d]isciplinary\" reasons.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"19\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Iowa%20Code%20%C2%A7%20232.52\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"19\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Iowa%20Code%20%C2%A7%20232.52\">\n    at 188\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Defendants admit that students can be placed in the BSU for rule infractions. [ECF No. 163 \u00b6\u00b6 142-43]. Further undercutting the BSU's purported focus on safety, the policy allows students to be placed in the BSU for arm-wrestling or shadow boxing.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   [ECF No. 159-2 at 192]. A teacher at the School testified during a deposition that she was encouraged to send students to the BSU for\n   being disruptive in class. [ECF No. 163 \u00b6 150]. Other evidence also suggests the School employs solitary confinement for relatively minor rule infractions.\n   <em>\n    See\n    <extracted-citation index=\"20\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Iowa%20Code%20%C2%A7%20232.52\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"20\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Iowa%20Code%20%C2%A7%20232.52\">\n    \u00b6 151\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

However, Plaintiffs highlight that the Corbett-Miller program \"simply consists of the twelve cells in the other wing of CMH.\" [ECF No. 163 \u00b6 116]. Students who are extended beyond a placement in the BSU are \"staffed\" to the Corbett-Miller program.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"22\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Iowa%20Code%20%C2%A7%20232.52\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   This means that those students live at CMH.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"23\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Iowa%20Code%20%C2%A7%20232.52\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   There is no material difference between the rooms in the BSU and those used in the Corbett-Miller program.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"24\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Iowa%20Code%20%C2%A7%20232.52\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"24\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Iowa%20Code%20%C2%A7%20232.52\">\n    \u00b6 117\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

Defendants allege students are staffed at CMH due to actions that pose a safety risk to School students and staff. [ECF No. 158 \u00b6 29]. Plaintiffs dispute whether this is always true, highlighting examples of when students were staffed at CMH following non-violent, \"attention seeking antics.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"26\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Iowa%20Code%20%C2%A7%20232.52\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   Plaintiffs claim, and Defendants deny, that students at CMH, whether staffed there or held in the BSU, are denied educational and recreational opportunities available to other students.\n   <em>\n    See\n    <extracted-citation index=\"27\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Iowa%20Code%20%C2%A7%20232.52\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"27\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Iowa%20Code%20%C2%A7%20232.52\">\n    \u00b6\u00b6 19, 28\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ; [ECF No. 163 \u00b6 120].\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   CMH also contains two interior six-by-twelve foot locked isolation cells.

However, the record showed that the plaintiff requested an interpreter on a prior occasion, but the defendants refused to discuss it with him.\n   <em>\n    See\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11588254\" index=\"122\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/170/850/#p857\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   The Eighth Circuit reasoned, \"[w]hile it is true that public entities are not required to guess at what accommodations they should provide, the requirement does not\n   narrow the ADA or RA so much that the [defendants] may claim [the plaintiff] failed to request an accommodation when it declined to discuss the issue with him.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11588254\" index=\"123\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/170/850/#p857\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11588254\" index=\"123\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/170/850/#p857\">\n    at 858-59\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Thus, although Plaintiffs need not have made an accommodation request in order to make out a prima facie claim under the ADA and RA, the circumstances must have been such that Defendants were aware of Plaintiffs' disabilities and their need for an accommodation.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Robertson v. Las Animas Cty. Sheriff's Dep't\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3700401\" index=\"124\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/500/1185/#p1197\">\n    500 F.3d 1185\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 1197-98 (10th Cir. 2007) (\"[A] public entity is on notice that an individual needs an accommodation when it knows that an individual requires one, either because that need is obvious or because the individual requests an accommodation.\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-60\">\n   As already discussed, there are numerous disputed facts regarding Plaintiffs' mental illnesses and the School's use of isolation and restraint in response to behavior arising from their disabilities. Based on the present record, the Court cannot determine as a matter of law whether Defendants knew their practices concerning these measures were inappropriate and should have been modified.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-61\">\n   3. Receipt of public funds\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-62\">\n   Defendants argue Plaintiffs cannot establish the public funds element of their RA claim because the School only receives federal funding under the National School Lunch Program, which is unrelated to Plaintiffs' claims. However, the Court has already noted that \"program or activity\" is broadly defined in the RA so that it applies to the entirety of the recipient's operations, rather than the specific function for which federal funding is received.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"125\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=29%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20794\">\n    29 U.S.C. \u00a7 794\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (b) (defining \"program or activity,\" in relevant part, as \"all of the operations of ... a department, agency, special purpose district, or other instrumentality of a State or of a local government ... any part of which is extended Federal financial assistance\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-63\">\n   Defendants also argue that applying the RA in this case violates the Constitution's Spending Clause because standards of mental health treatment and limits on the use of isolation and restraints are not reasonably related to the federal interests promoted by the National School Lunch Program.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   [ECF No. 148-1 at 31-32]. At least three circuit courts have rejected similar arguments.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Miller v. Tx. Tech Univ. Health Scis.

Accordingly, the Court rejects Defendants' Spending Clause argument.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-64\">\n   4. Undue burden\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-65\">\n   Defendants do not expressly argue that accommodating Plaintiffs' disabilities would constitute an undue burden. However, even if they had, the Court finds this type of highly factualized inquiry cannot be determined as a matter of law based on the record presently before the Court.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-66\">\n   <em>\n    C. Eleventh Amendment Defense\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-67\">\n   Defendants argued for the first time in their reply brief that Plaintiffs' claims must be dismissed because \"the sweeping relief sought by Plaintiffs' counsel would require a significant infusion of [state] resources\" in violation of the Eleventh Amendment.\" [ECF No. 162 at 4]. The Court disagrees. Under the\n   <em>\n    Ex parte Young\n   </em>\n   exception to the Eleventh Amendment's grant of sovereign immunity to the states, the Eleventh Amendment does not bar a suit that \"alleges an ongoing violation of federal law and seeks relief properly characterized as prospective.\"\n   <em>\n    Va.

Both conditions are established here. Plaintiffs assert claims for violations of the ADA, RA, and the Eighth and Fourteenth Amendments to the Constitution. They\n   seek no retrospective relief or money damages. Rather, they seek: (1) declaratory relief regarding the unconstitutional and unlawful nature of Defendants' course of conduct; (2) injunctive relief to prohibit Defendants' unconstitutional conduct going forward; (3) the appointment of a monitor to oversee implementation of this injunctive relief; and (4) attorney's fees.\n   <footnotemark>\n    7\n   </footnotemark>\n   This relief is focused on correcting the ongoing statutory and constitutional violations going forward, and is properly viewed as prospective.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-68\">\n   That some of this relief will impose ancillary costs on the state of Iowa does not render it unconstitutional.
