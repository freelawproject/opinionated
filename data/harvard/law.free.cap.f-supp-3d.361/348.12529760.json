Bianco, District Judge\n  </author>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   Plaintiff LI Neuroscience Specialists (\"plaintiff\" or \"LI Neuroscience\") filed this action against defendant Blue Cross Blue Shield of Florida (\"defendant\" or \"BCBS\"), seeking the full amount of its billed charges for medical care provided to a beneficiary of defendant, Barton W. (\"the patient\"), alleging that it is entitled to recover this amount because the patient transferred all of his rights to benefit payments under his insurance plan, as well as all related rights under the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 (\"ERISA\"), to plaintiff.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   Presently before the Court is defendant's motion to dismiss the Complaint, pursuant to Rule 12(b)(6) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, on the following grounds: (1) plaintiff lacks standing to pursue this claim under ERISA because the assignment of benefits was invalid; and (2) plaintiff fails to state a claim under ERISA for any relief. For the reasons set forth below, the motion to dismiss is granted.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   In particular, the Court dismisses the Complaint because the Court finds that the unambiguous anti-assignment provision in the Plan document nullified any purported assignment of the patient's benefits to plaintiff and because plaintiff does not seek equitable relief such that a claim for breach of fiduciary duty under ERISA would be proper. However, because plaintiff asserted at oral argument that it is considering pursuing an alternative standing argument using a power of attorney theory, the Court will conduct a status conference to determine whether plaintiff wishes to seek leave to re-plead in light of the Court's decision.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   I. BACKGROUND\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   A. The Complaint\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   According to the Complaint, plaintiff provided emergency medical services to\n   the patient on August 16, 2013, the value of which was $ 214,925. (Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 3-6, 8.) The patient was a beneficiary of defendant's health care plan and policies (\"the Plan\"). (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 2.) Plaintiff asserts that the patient transferred all of his rights under his insurance plan and all of his related rights under ERISA to plaintiff. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 7.) Plaintiff did not attach the alleged assignment to the Complaint or its opposition papers, nor do any of plaintiff's filings specify the terms of the assignment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   As the purported assignee of the benefits, plaintiff prepared Health Insurance Claim Forms demanding reimbursement in the amount of $ 214,925 for the emergency medical services rendered to the patient, and defendant subsequently issued reimbursement in the amount of $ 12,257.90 and indicated that an additional $ 850.54 was the patient's coinsurance liability. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 8-9.) Plaintiff then exhausted the administrative appeals process maintained by defendant. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 10.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   Plaintiff contends that pursuant to \u00a7 502(a)(1)(B) of ERISA, codified at\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=29%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201132\">\n    29 U.S.C. \u00a7 1132\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a)(1)(B), it has standing to seek relief \"based on the assignment of benefits obtained by [p]laintiff from [p]atients,\" and that it is entitled to recover benefits due to the patient under any applicable ERISA Plan and Policy. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 17, 19.) Plaintiff further asserts that defendant has failed to make payments pursuant to the Plan, and that its decision to deny additional reimbursement was wrongful. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 20-21.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   Plaintiff further alleges a cause of action pursuant to ERISA \u00a7 502(a)(3), codified at\n   <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=29%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201132\">\n    29 U.S.C. \u00a7 1132\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a)(3), contending that defendant acted in a fiduciary capacity in administering any claims determined to be governed by ERISA, and breached its fiduciary duties by: (1) failing to issue an Adverse Benefits Determination; (2) participating in, or knowingly undertaking to conceal, an act or omission of such other fiduciary; (3) failing to make reasonable efforts to remedy the breach of such other fiduciary; and (4) wrongfully withholding money belonging to plaintiff. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 18, 31.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   Although the Complaint does not state the basis for BCBS's authority, other than to allege that BCBS was the patient's health insurer, defendant has not challenged that that the relevant Plan is a health and welfare benefit plan under ERISA, and the patient was a Plan participant. Additionally, the Court notes that plaintiff seeks identical relief under both its breach of contract claim and its equitable relief claim.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   B. The Plan\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   Defendant appended a copy of the relevant Plan document to its motion to dismiss, along with a declaration by its attorney declaring that the provided plan document was the pertinent benefits plan for the patient here. The relevant provision related to assignment of benefits states:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-21\">\n   Except as set forth in the last paragraph of this section, we will not honor any of the following assignments, or attempted assignments, by you to any Provider:\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-22\">\n   \u2022 an assignment of the benefits due to you for Covered Services under this Benefit Booklet;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-23\">\n   \u2022 an assignment of your right to receive payments for Covered Services under this Benefits Booklet; or\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-24\">\n   \u2022 an assignment of a claim for damage resulting from a breach, or an alleged breach, of the Group Master Policy.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-25\">\n   We specifically reserve the right to honor an assignment of benefits or payment by you to a Provider who: 1) is In-Network under your plan of coverage; 2) is a NetworkBlue Provider even if that\n   Provider is not in the panel for your plan of coverage; 3) is a Traditional Program Provider; 4) is a BlueCard\u00ae (Out-Of-State) PPO Program Provider; or 5) is a BlueCard\u00ae (Out-of-State) Traditional Program Provider.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   (Plan, ECF No. 13-3, at 38.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   C. Procedural History\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   Plaintiff filed its Complaint on December 27, 2017. (ECF No. 1.) On March 7, 2018, defendant moved to dismiss the Complaint pursuant to Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 12(b)(6). (ECF No. 13.) Plaintiff opposed the motion on March 22, 2018, and defendant filed its reply in support of the motion on April 6, 2018. (ECF Nos. 16-17.) The Court heard oral argument on the motion on May 22, 2018. (ECF No. 20.) Defendant submitted supplemental authority on the issue of the enforceability of anti-assignment provisions on November 28, 2018 and January 14, 2019. (ECF Nos. 21-22.) Plaintiff did not respond to the supplemental submissions. To date, Barton W., the patient, has not participated in this case. The Court has fully considered all of the parties' submissions and arguments.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   II.

DISCUSSION\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   Defendants argue that the Complaint fails to state a claim for which relief can be granted because: (1) plaintiff lacks a cause of action under ERISA to bring a claim under \u00a7 502 because the assignment of benefits was invalid; (2) plaintiff fails to state a claim under \u00a7 502(a)(1)(B) because plaintiff fails to identify any plan term entitling it to relief; and (3) plaintiff fails to state a claim under \u00a7 502(a)(3) because the claim is duplicative of the claim under \u00a7 502(a)(1)(B) and impermissibly seeks legal relief where Congress only authorized equitable remedies. For the reasons set forth below, the Court concludes that plaintiff does not have a cause of action to bring a claim pursuant to \u00a7 502(a)(1)(B) because the unambiguous anti-assignment provision in the Plan nullified any purported assignment of benefits under the plan, including the right to bring a claim under \u00a7 502(a)(1)(B). Because the Court concludes that plaintiff does not have a cause of action to pursue a claim under \u00a7 502(a)(1)(B), the Court need not address whether plaintiff has alleged sufficient facts to state a claim under that provision. Further, the Court concludes that plaintiff's \u00a7 502(a)(3) claim impermissibly seeks legal relief in the form of money damages where Congress only authorized equitable relief, and therefore, that claim must be dismissed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   A.

Plaintiff does not dispute that the Plan contains an anti-assignment provision or that the anti-assignment provision is unambiguous, but rather argues that this Court should not enforce the anti-assignment provision \"as a matter of policy, fairness, and common sense.\" (Pl. Opp., ECF No. 16, at 2.) As this Court is bound by the precedent set by the Second Circuit, the Court concludes that the unambiguous anti-assignment provision in the Plan is enforceable, and thus plaintiff does not have a cause of action to bring an ERISA enforcement claim pursuant to \u00a7 502(a)(1)(B).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   As an initial matter, the Court agrees with defendant (and plaintiff) that the language of the anti-assignment provision in the Plan is unambiguous. \"We interpret ERISA plans in an ordinary and popular sense as would a person of average intelligence and experience.\"\n   <em>\n    Critchlow v.

Accordingly, because the assignment of benefits was invalid, plaintiff does not have a cause of action pursuant to \u00a7 502(a)(1)(B).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-51\">\n   Plaintiff argues that this Court should ignore the binding precedent of the Second Circuit and conclude that the assignment of benefits was valid despite the unambiguous anti-assignment provision in the Plan, because of public policy considerations. The primary case plaintiff cites in support of this argument is\n   <em>\n    Hermann Hospital v. MEBA Medical &amp; Benefits Plan\n   </em>\n   , relying on the statement of that court that it would be \"inequitable\" to enforce the anti-assignment provision at issue in that case because the assignee of benefits was \"the provider of the very services which the plan is maintained to furnish.\"\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"10520990\" index=\"45\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/959/569/#p575\">\n    959 F.2d 569\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 575 (5th Cir. 1992). However, as plaintiff notes in footnote two of its opposition brief, that holding from\n   <em>\n    Hermann\n   </em>\n   was expressly limited by the Fifth Circuit in\n   <em>\n    LeTourneau Lifelike Orthotics &amp; Prosthetics, Inc. v. Wal-Mart Stores, Inc.\n   </em>\n   , in which the court stated that the two decisions in\n   <em>\n    Hermann\n   </em>\n   did not \"stand[ ] for the proposition that all anti-assignment clauses are\n   <em>\n    per se\n   </em>\n   invalid vis-\u00e0-vis providers of health care services,\" and concluded that, unlike the specific anti-assignment provision at issue in\n   <em>\n    Hermann\n   </em>\n   , \"[a]pplying universally recognized canons of contract interpretation to the plain wording of the instant anti-assignment clause leads inexorably to the conclusion that any purported assignment ... would be void.\"\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11449852\" index=\"46\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/298/348/#p352\">\n    298 F.3d 348\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 353 (5th Cir. 2002). Despite the Fifth Circuit's express conclusion to the contrary, and without relying on any other authority, plaintiff asserts that the\n   <em>\n    Hermann\n   </em>\n   rationale \"very clearly applies to all anti-assignment clauses vis-\u00e0-vis providers of health care services.\" (Pl. Opp., at 2 n.2.) The Court concludes that plaintiff's position is inconsistent with the Fifth Circuit's interpretation of its own case law.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-52\">\n   In any event, to the extent\n   <em>\n    Hermann\n   </em>\n   could somehow be read more broadly to support plaintiff's argument, it is inconsistent with the Second Circuit's decision in\n   <em>\n    McCulloch\n   </em>\n   , which is binding on this Court. Plaintiff argues that\n   <em>\n    McCulloch\n   </em>\n   does not apply because the Second Circuit did not consider the policy arguments advanced in the instant case, and other circuits that have directly addressed policy arguments in the context of anti-assignment provisions \"completely mistake the analysis.\" (Pl. Opp., at 5.) However, even assuming\n   <em>\n    arguendo\n   </em>\n   that such public policy arguments were persuasive (an issue which this Court does not reach), such considerations are irrelevant when binding precedent is controlling.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.,\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    United States v.

Though plaintiff argues that it is improper to dismiss its \u00a7 502(a)(3) claim until it is determined whether plaintiff can succeed on its \u00a7 502(a)(1) claim (which the Court has already concluded it cannot, as plaintiff has no cause of action to bring the claim), or alternatively that \"the monetary relief [p]laintiff seeks under [\u00a7 502(a)(1)(B) ] is by definition separate and distinct from the monetary relief sought under [\u00a7 502(a)(3) ],\" the Court finds no merit to those arguments.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-62\">\n   Plaintiff points to cases interpreting the Supreme Court's decision in\n   <em>\n    Varity Corp. v.

Moreover, in\n   <em>\n    Devlin v. Empire Blue Cross and Blue Shield\n   </em>\n   , the Second Circuit emphasized that \"[t]he Supreme Court in\n   <em>\n    Varity Corp\n   </em>\n   . did not eliminate the possibility of a plaintiff successfully asserting a claim under both \u00a7 502(a)(1)(B), to enforce the terms of a plan, and \u00a7 502(a)(3) for breach of fiduciary duty; instead, the Court indicated that\n   <em>\n    equitable relief under \u00a7 502(a)(3)\n   </em>\n   would 'normally' not be appropriate.\"\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9456495\" index=\"77\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/274/76/#p89\">\n    274 F.3d 76\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 89 (2d Cir. 2001) (emphasis added).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-63\">\n   Here, the possibility of pursuing both claims simultaneously is not at issue, because the Court concludes that plaintiff is not seeking equitable relief at all, but rather seeks the balance of the billed and unreimbursed medical expenses-the exact same relief sought in plaintiffs \u00a7 502(a)(1)(B) claim. Because plaintiff seeks reimbursement for the balance of\n   the charges for medical services provided (as well as other \"classic\" legal remedies such as compensatory damages), rather than any equitable remedy that could be awarded if plaintiff's \u00a7 502(a)(3) claim was successful, and plaintiff's equitable claim is clearly an effort to \"repackage\" its claim under \u00a7 502(a)(1)(B), the Court dismisses this claim.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-64\">\n   C. Leave to Amend\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-65\">\n   In its opposition papers, plaintiff requested leave to re-plead if the claims were dismissed. At oral argument, plaintiff specifically noted the possibility of seeking leave to amend its Complaint to attempt to pursue a cause of action under ERISA as plaintiff's power of attorney. Because this issue was not briefed, and plaintiff did not have the Court's decision, the Court will conduct a status conference to discuss whether plaintiff will now seek leave to re-plead in light of the Court's decision.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-66\">\n   IV. CONCLUSION\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-67\">\n   BCBS's motion to dismiss the Complaint in its entirety is granted. Plaintiff does not have a cause of action to pursue a claim under ERISA for any violation of \u00a7 502(a)(1)(B) because of the unambiguous anti-assignment provision in the Plan. Further, plaintiff's \u00a7 502(a)(3) claim against BCBS is dismissed because the relief sought is a purely legal, rather than equitable remedy. The parties shall participate in a telephone conference with the Court on Monday, March 11, 2019, at 4:30 p.m., to discuss whether plaintiff is seeking leave to file an amended complaint.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-68\">\n   SO ORDERED.\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-71\">\n    The following facts are taken from the Complaint and are not findings of fact by the Court.
