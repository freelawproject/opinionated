Iowa Rev. 790; Code, 902; <em>Peck </em>v. Sexton, 41 Iowa, 566; <em>Lockridge </em>v. Daggett, 47 id. 679; <em>Moingona Coal Co. </em>v. <em>Blair, </em>51 id. 447.</p>\n<p data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b677-4\">It not only -deprives the plaintiff in error of his property \u25a0without due process of law, but impairs the contract of purchase from the State. \u25a0</p>\n<p data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b677-5\">' Since it is a universal rule that an action for the recovery of real property, whether called \u201cejectment,\u201d or \u201can actipn of right,\u201d or what else, cannot be brought unless there is an adverse possession^ it is clear that this actipn could not be brought until there was a mature-right to enforce it in the proper .court, and by the appropriate remedy. Ii&gt; follows, therefore, that under the-laws of Iowa there could not be such mature right, nor was the appropriate remedy afforded, until the plaintiff\u2019s right to possession\u00bbwas denied, either by an actual adverse holding, or some act equivalent thereto.

'</p>\n<p data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b677-6\">A title is not barbed by the mere failure to bring suit within the time limited; but there must have been an adverse posses-sion. <em>Neddy v.

The statute1 cannot begin to \u25a0 run until there, is an entry or possession which challenges the right of the owner. In oljher words, the entry must unequivocally denote an intent to take or assume actual possession,. <em>Altemas </em>v. Campbell, 9 Watts (Pa.), 28.</p>\n<p data-order=\"21\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b677-9\">There can be no -such thing as an acquiescence in an adverse claim which will defeat.- a recovery, until such claim be asserted by entry.\u2019 A party relying upon the bar of the statute must show that he has held the premises, not. only by a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"654\">*654</page-number>possession actual, open, and adverse, but that he has maintained it. as a right resulting\u2019 from an- exclusive property in and dominion over them for the time limited by the statute. 3 Wash.

By it a new and perfect title . was established. This results from the authority of the State to levy taxes on property, within her limits,, and coerce payment by subjecting it to sale. It is one of the necessary and inherent rights of the sovereign power. .Rev. 2267; Code, 1928; <em>Atkins </em>v. <em>Hinman, </em>7 Ill. 449; <em>Dunlap </em>v. <em>Gallatin County, </em>15 id. 7; <em>Irwin </em>v. <em>Treqo, </em>22 Pa.

(Pa.) 351.</p>\n<p data-order=\"23\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b678-6\">The formal execution and record of the tax deed which is the source of the title of the plaintiff in error being for land unoccupied, drew after it the possession, and it was unnecessary for hirn to bring an action,-or do anything to vindicate his title or right to possession until another challenged it-by entering.-into actual possession, or doing something in law which is equivalent thereto; <em>Dean </em>v. <em>Earley, </em>15 Wis. 100; <em>Paris</em>h v. <em>Eager, </em>id. 532; <em>Whitney </em>v. <em>Marshall, </em>17 id. 174; <em>Gunnison </em>v. <em>Hoehne, </em>18 id. 268.</p>\n<p data-order=\"24\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b678-7\">In declaring that \u201c no action for the recovery of real property, sold for the non-payment of taxes shall lie unless brought within five -years after the treasurer\u2019s deed is executed and recorded,\u201d the legislature could not haye intended to prevent an action after\u2019 the expiration of five years, in cases in which it was impossible that any measures\u2019 could be ta-lren in this form of action for the recovery within -th\u00a1at time. The term \u201crecovery\u201d implies an adverse proceeding through the medium of-the law; and the action for such recovery is utterly impracticable-under the Iowa statute, except where there is an actual /adverse possession. The owner of dhe tax title-being by his purchase, seised of the premises, theretofore and then unoccupied, could not be.divested of the possession until entry by-the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"655\">*655</page-number>former owner or some one Claiming title. Until then an action' \u25a0for the recovery did not accrue. <em>Waln </em>v. <em>Shearman, supra; Jackson </em>v. Huntley, 5 Johns. (N. Y.) 60; <em>Jackson </em>v. <em>McKee, </em>8 id. 429.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"25\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b679-4\">No counsel ^appeared for the defendant in- error.</attorneys>\n<opinion data-order=\"26\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b679-5\">Mb. Justice Woods,</author>\n<p id=\"AaP\">after stating the case, delivered the opinion of the court.</p>\n<p id=\"b679-6\">The Supreme Court of Iowa has, by several decisions, con-' stru'ed the five years\u2019 Statute of Limitations, which, is set up as a defence in this case, to apply .to an', action brought by one claiming under a tax deed, as well as'; to one brought by the-original owner of the' land. - <em>Brown </em>v. Painter, 38 Iowa, 456; <em>Laverty </em>v. Sexton, 41 id. 435. And the court so ruled in1 this c\u00e1se. See <em>Barrett </em>v. Love, 48 id. 103.</p>\n<p id=\"b679-7\">By these decisions the Supreme Court of the State has established a .rule of property in the State of Iowa which'is binding on this and other courts of the United States. <em>Jackson </em>v. Chew, 12 Wheat. 153; <em>Beauregard </em>v. <em>New </em>Orleans, 18 How. 497; <em>Suydam </em>v. <em>Williamson, </em>24 id. 427; <em>Nichols </em>v. <em>Levy, </em>5 Wall. 433; <em>Williams </em>v. <em>Kirtland, </em>13 id. 306.</p>\n<p id=\"b679-8\">\u25a0 So far, therefore, as this point is concerned, it must be con-; sidered a?'settled. \u25a0 . ,,</p>\n<p id=\"b679-9\">But the court further held that the limitation began to run' at the time of the-, \u00e9xecution and recording of the t'ax deed, irrespective of the question of adverse possession, so \"that, if at any time during the period of five years, no matter how near its close, the former owner takes actual possession, and holds until the expiration of the five years from the date of the \u2022execution and recording of the tax deed, the right of the purchaser at the tax sale is completely barred.</p>\n<p id=\"b679-10\">. The plaintiff in error claims that when thus construed the statute is in conflict with the Constitution of the United States: first,\" because fit deprives the purchaser at a tax sale of his' property without due' process of law; and, second, because it .impairs the obligation of the contract of purchase, of which the statute in force when it was made, forms a part. Art. 5, Amendments-to the Constitution, and sect. 10, art. 1.</p>\n<p id=\"b679-11\">The argument of the plaintiff in error is that the purchaser <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"656\">*656</page-number>at a tax sale cannot bring suit to\u2018recover the land purchased by him until the former owner, or some one else, tajees adverse possession; and as no such possession may be taken until just before, or even after, the expiration of the five years, .his right to the land is cut off without giving him his day in court, arid the obligation of the contract- contained in his deed, and the law under which it was executed, is impaired.</p>\n<p id=\"b680-5\">We do not think that the premise from which this conclusion is drawn is true in -point of fact, nor,- if it were, that the conclusion would follow.</p>\n<p id=\"b680-6\">The Iowa statute (Rev. 3601; Code, 3273) declares that \u201can action to determine and quiet the title of real property' may be brpught by any one having or claiming an interest therein, whether in or out of possession \u25a0 of the same, against any person claiming title thereto though not in possession.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b680-7\">The Supreme Court of Iowa, in this case, held that the bringing of an. action under the section first quoted would be an action for the recovery of the property, arid would interrupt the running of the five* years\u2019 Statute of Limitation. <em>Barrett </em>v. Love, 48 Iowa, 103.</p>\n<p id=\"b680-8\">The fact, therefore, that- the lands are unoccupied \u25a0 during the five years succeeding the execution and recording of the tax deed is no obstacle to .the-bringing of a suit which would interrupt the' running of the limitation. .</p>\n<p id=\"b680-9\">But even if no such action could be brought, we think that the purchaser at a tax sale is not deprived of any of the rights conferred on him by his purchase and deed, by reason of the construction put upon the five years\u2019 Statute of Limitation. .</p>\n<p id=\"b680-10\">The' right of the legislature to prescribe what shall be'the effect of'a tax sale and deed cannot be questioned. The legislature of Iowa, in-the-enactments brought to our notice in this' case, has exercised that right- with great liberality to the purchaser at the tax sale. It has made his deed presumptive evidence of certain facts\" and conclusive evidence of others; it has declared that it shall vest in him all the estate of the \u25a0former owner and of the county and State' in the premises. But it has also declared, in effect, that the deed shall not support an action for the recovery \u00f3f the land unless the suit <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"657\">*657</page-number>therefor is brought within five-years after the treasurer\u2019s deed is executed and recorded. When, therefore, the purchaser at a tax sale receives the treasurer\u2019s deed, he takes it with all tbe advantages and disadvantages incident thereto. 'He knows precisely its effect, and what he must do to protect his title under it, for all this is plainly written in the law. If there should turn out- to be an insuperable obstacle to his estab- ' lishing his title to unoccupied lands-, he cannot' complain, for tbe whole subject was under the legislative control, the rules affecting his title-were proclaimed in advance, and he bought with his eyes open. He'took the risk- of being able to make his deed effectual under the rules prescribed by the legislature. He gets all he bargained for. So that when the Statute of Limitation cuts him off, he haying, as he imagined, been unable to bring his suit for want of a party in adverse possession, he has been deprived of no fight which he ever possessed.</p>\n<p id=\"b681-3\">The legislature might have declared that the title of the purchaser at the tax sale should be divested without his consent by the repayment to him within a prescribed period, by. the former owneiyof the amount of his bid, or the tax and the interest and penalty thereon. \u25a0 The'right to redeem the title of lands sold for. taxes is one commonly reserved, and the right is \u00cd.\u00bb /ored by the policy of the law. <em>Dubois </em>v. Hepburn, 10 Pet. 1; <em>Corbett </em>v. <em>Nutt, </em>10 Wall. 464; <em>Grault\u2019s </em>Appeal, 33 Pa. St. 94; <em>Rice </em>v. <em>Nelson, </em>27 Iowa, 148; <em>Schenk </em>v. <em>Peay, </em>1 Dill. 267; <em>Masterson </em>v. <em>Beasley, </em>3 Ohio, 301; <em>Jones </em>v. <em>Collins, </em>16 Wis. 594; <em>Curtis </em>v. <em>Whitney, </em>13 Wall. 68. But it would scarcely be contended that such statute deprived the purchaser of his property without due process- of law, or impaired the obligation of his contract of. purchase.</p>\n<p id=\"b681-4\">But under the Iowa law the purchaser at a tax sal\u00e9, who can find no one in possession against whom to bring his suit, has a plain way to' make his title indefeasible, and that is by taking possession- hims\u00e9lf.</p>\n<p id=\"b681-5\">When the section prescribing the effect of the treasurer\u2019s deed and that prescribing the five years\u2019 limitation are considered together, -the policy of the law is plain, and no cause of complaint is left the purchaser at tax sale. The effect of the two sections is this, that the party holding under-the tax <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"658\">*658</page-number>deed must within five years either himself- take actual possession of the property, or within the same period bring' a- suit to recover possession; and, upon his failure to do either, his action upon his dfeed- shall be barred..</p>\n<p id=\"b682-3\">When thus considered,\u2019 the law violates- no contract and deprives the purchaser at the tax- sale of no estate or property to which he had a right. He bought subject to a condition, with explicit warning that if he did not comply with it, his deed should become ineffectual to support -an action. Failing to perform the condition, he is left- without remedy, but also \u2022 without just ground for complaint.</p>\n<p id=\"b682-4\">We see no error in the record.</p>\n<p id=\"b682-5\">\n<em>Judgment affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
