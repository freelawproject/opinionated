On the 26th of October, 1864, th\u00e9 Secretary of the Treasury signed and delivered to the claimants the paper of that date, annexed to the petition ; and on the same day Abraham Lincoln, President of the United States, signed the order of that date, accompanying said paper, and also' annexed \u2022 to the petition.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b347-3\">II. On the 16th of November, 1864, the claimants delivered to George S.

On the 13th of December, 1864, on the United States ship \u201c Choctaw,\u201d off Bayou Sara, La., John J. Cornwell, lieutenant-commander of the United States navy, commanding the second and third, districts of the Mississippi River, issued the following order, addressed to naval officers between Bayou Sara and New Orleans: \u201c Pass the steamer \u2018Sciota,\u2019 Captain Owesney, with a cargo of three hundred and thirty-six (336) bales of cotton, to New Orleans, without molestation.

On the arrival of the steamer \u201c Sciota \u201d at New Orleans, she and her cargo were seized by tbe United States military police, under the control of Col. Harai Robinson, then acting as provost-marshal-general of the Department of the Gulf, of which department Gen. S. A.

After the seizure of the \u201c Sciota \u201d and her cargo, General Hurlbut issued a. special order, stating that, by direction of the major-general, commanding the military division west of the Mississippi, the cotton brought by the steamer \u201c Sciota \u201d should be disposed of as follows: A certain number of bales (number not shown) to be given to the claimants; the remainder to be.turned over to O. N. Cutler, the United States purchasing-agent ; and that the claimants, should give bonds for their appearance when required. On said Robinson\u2019s receipt of said order he sent for the claimants, and they appeared before him, and gave bonds; at which time they did not exhibit to him any papers in relation to the shipment of cotton. It was not the province of said Robinson to have' anything to do with the receiving or disposing of the cotton.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"ASF\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"324\">*324</page-number>, VI.

He told them he thought it was - a sweeping one; that it covered all ground. They answered that, notwithstanding that permit, the cotton aboard the \u201c Sciota \u201d had been seized and detained, and themselves put under bond. He asked how that could be. .They answered that the permit was of no account unless signed by the major-general commanding the department. He asked them if they had presented it to the general commanding. They said yes, and it had been refused. He then advised them to' go to General Canby, who commanded the military division west of the Mississippi, and.show the permit to him. They replied, \u201cYou know that is useless by the very order which put us under bond: it states by order of the general commanding the military division west of the Mississippi.\u201d They further said they were satisfied that it could not be done exc\u00e9pt by money; that money was wanted; and that they were willing to pay most lib\u00e9rally to have it signed; that that would cover and release their cotton. They said they would pay $10,000 to have that presidential permit indorsed, and their cotton released. He then told them to leave the-permit with him, and he would see about it.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b348-5\">The next day the said Robinson'took, the permit to General Hurlbut, and told him the parties wished to have it signed-by him.

The appellants\u2019 cotton had been seized previously to the payment' of the money, and the executive order of the President of the United-States, exempting it from seizure by the military authorities, was ignored and treated with contempt. The acts of the p'rovost-marshal- ' general were illegal and oppressive, and the appellants were obliged to pay the money extorted by.that officer or submit to those acts. It was' n\u00f3t a case of <em>par delictum. </em>It was oppression on one side and submission- on the other.' It can never be predicated as <em>par delictum, </em>when one holds the rod and the other bows to it. <em>Smith </em>v. <em>Cuff, </em>6 Man. <em>&amp; </em>Sel. 160; <em>Alsoqer </em>v. <em>Spalding, </em>4 Bing.

The claimants undoubtedly held an executive license to transport by way of New Orleans, notwithstanding the act of July 2,1864 (13 Stat. 377, sect. 9), any cotton they had bought in the parishes of East Feliciana and West Feliciana, under the authority of the special agent- of the treasury'at New Orleans, if they gave the required bond and presented to the acting collector of customs' at that-' port the original authorities or permits under which <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"331\">*331</page-number>they acted, or copies thereof certified by the officer with whom they were filed, with proof to the satisfaction of the acting, collector that the cotton was actually purchased in good faith under and by virtue of such authorities. By the express terms of this licence any cotton transported, or attempted to be trans-, ported, under it, without the original permits or authorities or certified copies and proof required, was subject to seizure and condemnation. It is not pretended that when the seizure was made the claimants had in their possession any evidence of their right, under this authorization, to transport the cotton which was seized. While it has been found that the bond was executed and delivered to the acting collector on the 16th of November, 1864, the findings are entirely silent as to the presentation of the original permits or the required proof before the transportation was entered upon. Neither did the executive license .have upon it the prescribed certificate that the bond had been executed and delivered. Under such, circumstances the seizure could not have been wrongful in the first instance. It was the duty of the military authorities at that point to eee that nothing passed out from the enemy\u2019s country under this authority until the requisite evidence was furnished. New Orleans was a military post, and Congress had seen fit to restrict materially the power of the President to permit commercial intercourse with the inhabitants of the insurgent territory. The executive license, when construed in' connection with this new congressional action, w\u00e1s evidently intended .only to protect such rights as had become vested under previous authorities or,permits rightfully-issued. Therefore, nothing could pass except what the collector had been satisfied by proof was \u201c actually purchased in good faith under and by virtue of said authorities.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b355-5\">The claimants, when the seizure was made, did not attempt to secure a release by producing the necessary evidence of their rights, but by tempting \u00e1 subordinate .officer in the military service by a liberal offer of money.. He &gt; made no demands, but accepted what they voluntarily gave him. Tn this way the executive order was evaded and a pass through the lines secured by corrupting an officer. Clearly this' was bribery, and placed the claimants and the man'they corrupted <em>in pari </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"332\">*332</page-number><em>delicto. </em>They could not recover back from him the money they paid, neither can they from the United States after it has been taken, from him as a punishment for his. faithlessness to his trust.</p>\n<p id=\"Am8\">It is insisted, howfever, that when the claimants presented to the inilitary authorities the executive license, with the certificate of the acting -collector indorsed to the effect that the requisite bond- had^been delivered to him, they had- done all that was required to get, their property back and proceed with the' transportation; They evidently did not so understand the effect pf what they had done, for they voluntarily offered and' paid more money to secure .what they wanted, and that they interpreted, the instrument. correctly is, to our minds, clear. The execution of the bond is one thing, and the production of the original permits and proof an\u00f3ther. It is true that in the \u25a0 license the provision as to the bond follows that as to the per.mits and proof; but the delivery and acceptance of the bond were no more evidence of the.presentation of the permits than the presentation of the permits would have been of the\" delivery of the- bond. The certificate of the bond on the license was evidence of the performance of that condition,-but nothing more. The execution of the bond was not at all dependent on the presentation of the permits and proof.
