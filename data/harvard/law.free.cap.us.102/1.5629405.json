It also reserved but did not exercise the privilege of purchasing them at the original cost at any time during the existence of ' the contract. A. retained the right to rescind the contract, if the company failed to pay the interest on its bonds. While the contract was in force, the mortgagee filed his bill of foreclosure. The court appdinted a receiver, who took charge of the road and used the ears in operating it. The contract was never recorded. <em>Held, </em>1. That the contract was binding between the parties . thereto, and the failure to record it did not, under the statute of Iowa, render the cars subject to the lien of the mortgage. 2.

S. Connor, <em>Seo'y.\u201d</em></summary>\n<summary data-order=\"21\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b28-12\">The court appointed a receiver, who took charge of -the road and said cars.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"22\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b28-13\">\u25a0 The Western Car Company filed an answer and a cross-bill claiming title and right of possession to the cars, and compensation for the use' of them by the receiver. The Western Car Company Association originally leased ninety cars to the railroad company, and became a corporation under the name of The Western Car Company, under a charter granted by the State of Delaware. .An agreed statement was filed in the court below, setting forth the following facts: The cars were delivered to the railroad company under a conditional contract or lease with the Western .Car Company Association, between Feb. 8, 1872, and Feb. 15, 1873; $22,179.02 was paid for the rent thereof prior to Oct. 1, 1873, under a similar lease or contract to that of Oct. 1,1873; the Western Car Company was formed at or prior to Oct. 1, 1873, and the foregoing contract was executed-between it and the railroad - company; the words <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"5\">*5</page-number>having been the property of the Western Car Company Association, and by them delivered \u201d to the said railroad company, mentioned in that contract, refer to the delivery above named, and the car company claims title to and rent for the cars under-the contract of Oct. 1, 1873. The trustees- of the bondholders claim title under the mortgage dated May 12, 1871, which was duly, recorded. . The contract of Oct. 1, 1873, was never recorded. The receiver has paid no rent for the cars, and they were marked as stated in that contract.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"23\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b29-5\">The cars were all in use by the railroad company, and were constantly passing, in and for its business to Chicago and back, on the Chicago and\u2019Northwestern Railroad, and in carrying and earning freight for the Davenport and St. Paul road up' to the time of the receiver\u2019s appointment. . Some parties, in a proceeding against the Chicago and Northwestern Railroad Company, garnished the cars, and the court below made an order on that company to deliver them to the receiver. Before the order was executed, the car company .applied to the court . to direct a payment of rent to them by the receiver. When the court refused to Mo so, that company, through the same attorneys who applied for rent, replevied fifty-eight of the cars from the Chicago and Northwestern Railroad Company by writ from .the Circuit \u00f3ourt of the United States for the Northern District of Illinois. B. E. Smith was, Oct. 1, 1873, president of the car company, and of the Davenport Railway Construction- Company, and a stockholder in the Da.venport and St. Paul Railroad Company. At that date, George H. French was president of the latter-company, and secretary of the Construction Company.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"24\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b29-6\">It-was further agreed that if the court decided that the car company was entitled to the cars, the amount of rent was to be fixed by a reference +o such- competent person as the court might select.,</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"25\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b29-7\">The court found that the said nin - \u2018 y cars leased by the railroad company from the Western Car Company, at\u2019 all times had been and then were the property of the latter company, and that it was entitled to the immediate possession thereof. \u25a0 The court thereupon adjudged that the complainants\u2019 bill be dismissed as against the car company.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"26\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b30-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"6\">*6</page-number>The court further found that of the said ninety cars fifty-six had come into the possession of the car company under and by virtue of said writ of replevin ;\u25a0 that thirty-four of them were .then, and had been since the filing of the bill, in the possession of the receiver appointed by the court, but that two of them were subject to the lien of the deed of trust under which the complainants claim. It was adjudged and decreed that the receiver immediately surrender and deliver up unto the car company the remaining thirty-two cars.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"27\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b30-5\">It having been stipulated by the parties -that the value of the use of the said thirty-two cars, since and while they were in the possession of and in use by the receiver of the court, was $10 per car for each month since March, 1875, a period of twenty-six m\u00f3nths, it was further adjudged and decreed that the car company do have and recover for such use the sum of $8,320 ; and the receiver was ordered and directed to pay over the said moneys to the said company.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"28\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b30-6\">Myer and Dennison, the trustees named in the mortgage, thereupon appealed to this court.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"29\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b30-7\">Sect. 1922 of the Revised Code of Iowa of 1873 is as follows : \u2014</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"30\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b30-8\">\u201c That no sale, contract, or lease, wherein the transfer of title or ownership of personal property is made to depend upon any condition, shall be valid against any creditor or purchaser of the vendee or lessee in actual possession obtained in pursuance thereof, without notice, unless the same be in writing, exeouted by the vendor or lessor, acknowledged and recorded the same as chattel mortgages.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"31\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b30-9\">It is a transcript of an act having for its title \u201cAn Act requiring conditional sales of personal property to be executed, acknowledged, and recorded like mortgages of personal property, to- be of any validity as against <em>bona fide </em>purchasers, executions, and attaching creditors.\u201d \u25a0</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"32\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b30-10\"><em>Mr. Joseph U. Choate </em>and <em>Mr. James Grant </em>for the appellants.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"33\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b30-11\">By the true and fair construction of its terms, the statute of Iowa applies to this case. It invalidates the title or right of recovery of the lessor, as against the prior mortgagees, and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"7\">*7</page-number>makes their title as \u25a0 creditors superior to that of the actual owner.</p>\n<p data-order=\"34\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b31-5\"><em>\u0430. </em>The title of the original act does not control the enacting clause. The latter is free from all ambiguity, and secures the benefit of its provisions to \u201c any creditor.\u201d Potter\u2019s Dwarris on Statutes, pp. 265-270<em>; Mace </em>v. <em>Cadell, </em>Cowp. 232; Sedgwick, Statutes, pp. 50-52.</p>\n<p data-order=\"35\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b31-6\">\u0431. Although <em>United States </em>v. <em>New Orleans Railroad </em>(12 Wall. 362) holds that, as a general rule of equity, the mortgagee in such a mortgage must take after-acquired property <em>cum onere, </em>the express terms of this statute create a clear. exception to that rule. <em>United States Wind Engine Co. </em>v. Burlington, &amp;c. <em>Railway Co., </em>4 Dill. 580.</p>\n<p data-order=\"36\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b31-7\">e. The contract in question comes -directly within those terms. It is \u201c a contract or lease wherein the transfer of title or owmership of personal property is made to depend upon a condition,\u201d and the \u201c lessee or vendee was in actual possession, obtained in pursuance thereof without*notice\u201d to creditors.</p>\n<p data-order=\"37\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b31-8\">The condition, on which the transfer of title is made to depend, is' the payment of the original cost. At any time during tli'e lease, by performing this condition, the lessee is to become the owner of the cars.'</p>\n<p data-order=\"38\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b31-9\">The purposes of the statute are to be considered. Like all similar legislation which aims at prohibiting the separation of the apparent or reputed title from the real ownership, it is to\u2019 be construed for the prevention of' fraud upon creditors and-others, who rely upon the apparent ownership, which the possession and use of chattels indicate. Had an actual purchaser bought and paid for the cars, there can be no question that his title would be sustained as against the real owner, and the statute expressly puts \u201cany creditor\u201d in the same'position.</p>\n<p data-order=\"39\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b31-10\">The principle of such statutes is that a divorce of the apparent ownership, manifested-by possession, from tbe actual ownership, shall not avail as against creditors who rely upon the possession.</p>\n<p data-order=\"40\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b31-11\">In <em>Twyne\u2019s Case </em>(3 Co. 87), it was resolved that such statutes made against.fraud must be liberally and beneficially expounded, and that the whole instrument must be taken together to ascertain its meaning.</p>\n<p data-order=\"41\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b32-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"8\">*8</page-number>The statute of Iowa does not contemplate a consummated sale and purchase, but a contract or lease whereby the transfer of title is made to depend upon a condition. This exact feature is found in this contract. Whenever the lessee pays or secures the original cost \u25a0 of the cars, they are to be its property; This is an executory agreement binding on the lessor during the whole term of the lease. The statute dispenses in favor of creditors of the lessee with the performance of the condition, i-f the contract, \u2022 as in this case, be not recorded.</p>\n<p data-order=\"42\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b32-4\">Leases wherein payment of rent to the amount of a fixed purchase-price is stipulated for have frequently been held to be within the statute. <em>Sewing-Machine Company </em>v. <em>Holcomb, </em>40 Iowa, 33; <em>Mosely </em>v. <em>Shattuck, </em>43 id. 540; <em>Lucas </em>v. <em>Campbell, </em>88 Ill. 447; <em>Latham </em>v. <em>Sumner, </em>89 id. 233; <em>Hervey </em>v. <em>Rhode Island Locomotive Works, </em>93 U. S. 664. The distinguishing feature of' these cases is that the rent for which the lessee is .bound is paid and received as part of the purchase-money, and that when he, by paying the whole amount, has performed the condition on which the transfer of title is made to depend, the property becomes his.</p>\n<p data-order=\"43\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b32-5\">The statute of Towa covers not only that case, but every case where' the contract under which possession is taken contains a condition on the performance of which the title is to pass to the party in possession, although he may not be bound to perform the condition.</p>\n<p data-order=\"44\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b32-6\">A conditional sale does not require a mutual and binding agreement of sale and purchase. It means an agreement of sale, provided the contemplated purchaser performs the prescribed condition. <em>Horn </em>v. <em>Baker, </em>9 East, 215; <em>Strong </em>v. <em>Taylor, </em>2 Hill (N. Y.), 326; <em>Herring v. Willard, </em>2 Sandf. (N. Y.) 418.</p>\n<p data-order=\"45\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b32-7\">The court cannot, to palliate the supposed hardships of a particular case, annul the express, provisions of the statute of Iowa. This it would do if it held that Myer and Dennison were not \u201c creditors \u201d in the sense of that statute.</p>\n<p data-order=\"46\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b32-8\"><em>d. </em>The lease provides that the lessee may at any time during its continuance become the owner of the cars on payment of the original cost. Is not some light shed upon this <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"9\">*9</page-number>singular provision by tbe stipulation filed in tbe court below showing that the actual value of the rent of them was just one-half of that reserved by the lease ? Doubtless, therefore, long before the receiver took possession, the lessor had received in excessive rent their full original cost,'and the plea of hardship in losing them wholly fails.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"47\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b33-5\"><em>Mr. Robert </em>6r. <em>Ingersoll </em>and <em>Mr. John M, </em>Butler, <em>contra.</em></attorneys>\n<opinion data-order=\"48\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b33-6\">.Me. Chief Justice Waite</author>\n<p id=\"AS\">delivered the opinion of the court.</p>\n<p id=\"b33-7\">We consider it unnecessary to decide in this case whether a' lease of personal property at a specified rent, with an option in. the lessee to buy for a fixed price, is in legal effect a conditional sale; because, even if it be, the decree below is in our opinion right. In <em>Fosdick </em>v. <em>Schall </em>(99 U. S. 235), a case which came up from Illinois, we decided that such a contract of sale, if. not recorded in accordance with the requirements of the chattel-mortgage acts, was legal and valid as between the parties,. and that under a mortgage reaching after-acquired property the mortgagee would take such property subject to all the conditions with which it was incumbered when.it came into the hands of the mortgagor. The statute we were then considering was as follows: \u2014 \u25a0</p>\n<p id=\"b33-8\">\u201c That no mortgage, trust-deed, or other conveyance of personal property, having the effect of a mortgage or lien upon such property, shall be valid as against the rights and interests of any. third person, unless possession thereof shall be delivered to and remain with the grantee, or the instrument shall provide for the possession of the property to remain with the grantor, and the instrument is acknowledged and recorded as hereinafter directed; and every such instrument shall,-for the purposes of this act, be deemed' a chattel mortgage.\u201d Rev- Stat. Ill., 1874, p. 711.</p>\n<p id=\"b33-9\">' Under this statute the courts of Illinois have uniformly held that contracts of conditional sale are in effect, so far as the chattel-mortgage acts are concerned, the same as though a formal bill of sale had been executed and a mortgage given back to secure the purchase-money. So that the question we were then called on to decide was whether one holding as a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"10\">*10</page-number>mortgagee of after-acquired property was a \u201c third person \u201d within the meaning <em>of </em>that law.</p>\n<p id=\"b34-5\">The statute of Iowa which is involved in the present case is as. follows: \u2014</p>\n<p id=\"b34-6\">'* That no sale, contract, or lease, wherein the transfer of title or ownership of personal property is made to depend upon any condition, shall be valid against any creditor or purchaser of the vendee or lessee, in actual possession obtained in pursuance thereof, without notice, unless the same be in writing, executed by the vendor or lessor, acknowledged and recorded the same as chattel mortgages.\u201d Code of 1873, sect. 1922, p. 356; Acts of Fourteenth General Assembly, c. 63, p. 69.</p>\n<p id=\"b34-7\">It will thus be seen that the statutes of the two States are substantially alike, unless, a different meaning is given the term. \u201c third person,\u201d used in'the one, from that of \u201c creditor or purchaser,\u201d found in the other. \u2019 If these terms are the same in legal 'effect, the principal question involved in this case has already been Settled here.</p>\n<p id=\"b34-8\">In <em>Fosdick </em>v. <em>Schall </em>we held that a mortgagee, whose mortgage embraced property to be acquired in the future was in no sense a purchaser of such property. \"His rights were not granted after the property was bought by the mortgagor\". He got nothing by this provision in his mortgage except what the mortgagor himself had acquired. He paid nothing for his new security. . He took as mortgagee just such title as the mortgagor had; no more, no less. The code of Iowa, sect. 1283, authorized mortgages of property afterwards' to be acquired, and made them as valid and effectual as if the property were in possession at the time- of the execution thereof; but this does not change the case. The question still is, what property has been acquired to which the mortgage can attach. \u25a0</p>\n<p id=\"b34-9\">\"We think, therefore, that the word \u201c purchaser \u201d in the. Iowa statute gives the appellants no rights other than those to which they would be entitled under like circumstances in Illinois</p>\n<p id=\"b34-10\">Every mortgagee is necessarily a creditor. \u2022 A mortgage is in general but an incident to the debt it secures, and the mortgagee is nothing more than \u00e1 creditor secured by mort<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"11\">*11</page-number>gage; These appellants are mortgagees; but, as has just been seen, their mortgage gives them no rights to the property in dispute against the car company, the lessor, or conditional vendor. Their claim is only such as belongs to creditors of the. railroad company, the' lessee, or conditional vendee. So far as any rights they have as simple creditors \u00e1re concerned, the railroad company could do with' the property just what it pleased. It might have been surrendered to the c\u00e1r company or sold to another. The'car company, too, could have taken, possession under'its lien, and held against any proceeding these creditors might afterwards commence as\u2019 mere creditors.\" Unless a creditor is in a condition to prevent the vendee from controlling his property, he is powerless, and the vendor and vendee may contract with each other as they please without consulting him.' It follows .that although the word \u201c creditor \u201d appears in the statute, it must have been used with some limitation. This makes it necessary to inquire what that limitation was.</p>\n<p id=\"b35-5\">The statute as we now \"find it is part of the. code of Iowa adopted in 1873. - This code, like the Revised Statutes of the United States, was in reality only a convenient compilation or codification of laws- before that time in. force. In the brief of counsel for&gt; the appellants, it is stated in terms that the particular section of the code now in question (sect. 1922) is a copy of chapter 63 of the acts of the Fourteenth General Assembly.</p>\n<p id=\"b35-6\">In relation to the Revised Statutes of the United States, we held, in <em>United States </em>v. <em>Bowen </em>(100 U. S. 508), that \u201c when it becomes neeess\u00e1ry to construe language, in the revision which leaves \u00e1 substantial doubt as to its meaning, the original statute may be resorted to for the purpose of ascertaining that meaning.\u201d The same rule is applicable to the Iowa code, and there is a substantial doubt here as-to what The word \u201ccreditor \u201d means.' Looking then to\" the original act, we' find the text the same as the code ;\u2022 but the title, omitted in the codification, is as follows:. \u201c An Act requiring conditional sales of' personal property to be recorded like mortgages of' personal property to be of any validity as against <em>bona fide </em>purchasers, execution and attaching creditors.\u201d In cases of doubt the title <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"12\">*12</page-number>might always be resorted to for the purpose of ascertaining the meaning of the-body of the act; but especially is this true in States like Iowa, where the, constitution provides that \u201c eyery act shall embrace but one,subject and matters properly connected therewith; which-subject shall be expressed in the title. But if any subject shall be embraced in an act which shall not be expressed in the title, such act shall be void, only as to so much thereof as shall not be expressed in the title.\u201d Art. 3, sect, 29. This leaves no doubt, and clearly confines the operation of the text to such creditors as have by suit perfected a right to impeach the transaction. Such has always been the rule in respect to conveyances made to hinder and delay creditors. Until suit was commenced, the parties were at liberty to deal as they pleased with the property conveyed, and the rights of creditors were determined by the condition in which the property was when they interfered. 'It' is clear, therefore, that these appellants, as creditors at large, had acquired no such special interest in the property, when their bill to foreclose their mortgage Was filed, as would give them the right to contest the validity of. the car company\u2019s title. As against them, in the condition they were, the lien created by the conditional sale was to all intents and purposes valid and subsisting when the receiver, on his appointment, took possession of the property; and his possession, as we said i\u00f1 <em>Fosdick </em>v. Schall, was for the benefit of whomsoever in the end it should be found to concern. The rights of the .parties were fixed at the moment the property was taken by the'- court through its receiver into its own possession. At that time these appellants were not either execution, or attaching creditors. They had not then, neither have they since, sued as any other than mortgage creditors endeavoring to \u00e9nforce- their mortgage lien. We conclude, therefore, that the statute of Iowa has a no more extended operation, so far as the circumstances of this case are concerned, than that of Illinois, and that under our former decision the appellants stand precisely where the railroad company would in a controversy with its vendor. To our miuds it is unimportant that under the railroad mortgage laws. of Iowa \u201c the rolling-stock and- personal property of the company, properly belonging to the road and appertaining thereto, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"13\">*13</page-number>shall be deemed a part of the road,\u201d for the purposes of a mortgage. Such personal property is- still \u201c loose property, susceptible of separate ownership and separate liens,\u201d and it is only such interest as \u201c properly belongs \u201d to the company that the authorized mortgage reaches. The evident purpose of \u00bfhe act was t.o do no more than prevent confusion growing out of any difference there might be between recording acts -having reference to persona] prop nty and those affecting real estate. This disposes of the principal question in the case.</p>\n<p id=\"b37-5\">The money reqovery below was only for the use of the cars by the receiver during the receivership, and the amount was substantially agreed on. In other words, it - is in effect admitted that the use- of the cars was worth to the court while\u2019 operating the road under the trust created by the appointment of a receiver, at the instance of these appellants, just what has been decreed. There can be .no doubt that it is the.duty of a court to pay from the trust fund, it has in possession all the debts it incurred in its judicial capacity while administering, the trust assumed, pending'the litigation, in\u2019 behalf of the litigatirig parties. The objection here is not that the fund in hand did not incur the debt, the payment of which has been ordered,' but that the railroad company, while operating the road b.efofe the receivership, paid the ear company too large a sum for the use of its cars, and that the debt of the fund should be reduced by the amount of this improvident and excessive payment. There is nothing in the case as it has been brought here by the appeal which will enable us to determine whether the car company ought to contribute anything to the fund in court on this account or not. It is sufficient for our purposes on this appeal that an authorized officer of the-court -has in. a legitimate way charged the fund, in hand with the debt, the payment of which has been ordered, and that it has not been proved that the car company owes the railroad company for over-payments made before the receivership was created.</p>\n<p id=\"AyC\">It is impossible for us to determine from anything now here whether the receiver is indebted to the car company for the use of the cars in question after the decree below, or whether the purchaser of the railroad property under the mortgage has used the cars pending the appeal, or that he Can, in this suit, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"14\">*14</page-number>be required to make compensation therefor. All those .questions will properly corpe before the court below for determination on the law and the facts when-the case goes down.</p>\n<p id=\"b38-4\">\n<em>Decree affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
