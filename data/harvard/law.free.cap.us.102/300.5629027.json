Sims. She was then .a minor less than seventeen years old, having been, born Sept. 25} 1828. \u2022 Her father, April 3, 1845, conveyed to her in fee the tract of \u2022 land in controversy, and, May 28, 1847, she, joining with her husband, executed a deed therefor to Magdalena Everhardt. \u2022 The deed, subscribed by her and her husband in the presence of a magistrate, was acknowledged in due form, and the purchase-money paid.

Her demand not having been complied with, this suit was brought to set aside the dee'd, and for an account of the rents and profits of the land, as well as of the amount, she is in duty bound to' pay to the defendants on account of the purchase-money paid by. the grantee, and the mortgage aforesaid.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b325-7\">The other .facts are stated in the opinion of the court.

It has not been overruled or qualified by any later case.</p>\n<p data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b327-3\">In the absence of any decision by that court, we should suppose the deed of an infant <em>feme covert, </em>in which her husband joined, to be good and effective. By marriage, guardianship is terminated. This common-law rule has been declared expressly by statute in Indiana. The Revised Statutes of 1843, sect. 102, c. 35, enact that \u201c the marriage of any female, under guardianship as a minor, to any person of full age, shall operate as a legal discharge of her guardianship, <em>in like manner as if she had arrived at full age.\u201d </em>The act of June 9, 1852, sect. 12, c. 4, omits the words italicized, and adds: \u201c And her guardian shall account'to the husband of the ward in the same manner as if she had arrived at full age.\u201d The Supreme Court of Indiana holds that the guardianship being thus terminated, an infant married to a man of full age can have no guardian. <em>State </em>v. <em>Joest, </em>46 Ind. 235; <em>Ex parte Post, </em>47 id. 142. The husband takes the place of the guardian, and the Revised Statutes of 1843, sect. 17, c. 28, .art. 2, would seem to empower a married woman of any age to unite with him in making title. It has, however, been held that the section merely authorizes a- minor wife to join in a conveyance which might be avoided by her within' a reasonable time after attaining her majority. <em>Scranton </em>v. <em>Stewart et al., supra.</em></p>\n<p data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b327-6\">2. The deed being only voidable, Mrs. Sims, if she desired to avoid it, was bound to do so, within a reasonable time after becoming. of age; and a period of twenty-one years is not a reasonable time. <em>Hartman </em>v. <em>Kendall, </em>4 id. 403; <em>Law v.

Sep above cases, and also <em>Doe </em>v. Abernathy, 7 Blackf. (Ind.) 442; <em>Babcock </em>v. Bowman, 8 Ind. 110; <em>Dearborn </em>v. Eastman, 4 N. H. 441; <em>Robbins </em>v. <em>Eaton, </em>10 id. 561; <em>Emmons </em>v. Murray, 16 id. 385; <em>Wallace </em>v. <em>Lewis, </em>4 Harr. (Del.) 75; Hastings. v. <em>Dollarhide, </em>24 Cal. 195. These cases held that such act of disaffirmance must be done .within a reasonable time. <em>Irvine </em>v. Irvine (9 Wall. 617) calls four years a long time. ' That period was held sufficient evidence of ratification in <em>Wallace </em>v. <em>Lewis, supra; </em>so was six years in New Hampshire, 10 N. H. 561; 16 N. H. 385; and nine years; in New York, 11 Johns. (N. Y.) 539; <em>Richardson </em>v. <em>Boright, </em>9 Vt. 368, 371; <em>Kline </em>v. <em>Beebe, </em>6 Conn. 494; <em>Wheaton </em>v. <em>East, </em>5 Yerg. (Tenn.) 41. <em>Hartman </em>v. <em>Kendall </em>(4 Ind. 403) declares thirteen years to be an unreasonable delay. These decision's also declare that the question as to what constitutes reasonable time must be determined by the peculiar circumstances of each case.</p>\n<p data-order=\"21\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b328-5\">In this'connection we rely upon the statement of Mrs. Sims, subjoined to the deed. We never supposed that she could make her deed effective by merely averring capacity ; but the deliberate averment of a fact known to her, but not to her grantee, must operate to shorten the period within which'it would be reasonable'to permit her to avoid'her deed by proof of a different state of things from that so averred. The fact that after 1852 she <em>might </em>have brought suit without joining her husband is also an element to be considered. Even if not bound to <em>sue </em>while covert, she was bound to disaffirm. Disaffirmance is a preliminary act: a fact vital to be proved and to be seasonably performed. The time for its performance will not be extended by delaying the suit. <em>Bool </em>v. <em>Mix, supra. </em>As the consideration was obtained' by her false pretences, it might well be held that she would be barred by an acquiescence, extending throughout the time within which she would have been liable to indictment therefor. \u25a0 Neither in civil nor criminal-procedure is it a conclusive presumption that a woman acts under the coercion of her husband. The facts in this case xebtit that presumption.</p>\n<p data-order=\"22\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b329-2\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"305\">*305</page-number>The fact of coverture does not excuse an act of positive fraud, such as her signing the false statement appended to the deed. While the law of Indiana gives to married women rights superior to those which they enjoy in some of the other States, it does not release them from the obligations of good' faith and common honesty. In <em>Litchenberger </em>v. <em>Graham </em>(50 Ind. 290), the silence of a woman was held to be a ratification of her .husband\u2019s sale of\u2019her personal property. <em>A fortiori, </em>then, will active participation' in his fraud greatly shorten the time for disaffirmance, if it does not estop her altogether from repudiating the contract. <em>Gatling </em>v. <em>Rodman, </em>6 id. 289; <em>Barnes </em>v. <em>McKay, </em>7 id. 301.</p>\n<p data-order=\"23\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b329-3\">8. This is a bill in chancery,, brought upon the assumption that the deed was void-\u00ab5 <em>initio. </em>Assuming that the title is and always has been in the complainant, it seeks merely to remove therefrom a cloud caused by an alleged fraudulent conspiracy against her, in which the deceased grantee was'a participant. Such is the equity which she sets out ,to establish. It finds no support in the evidence nor warrant\u2019 in the law as it. is-expounded and enforced in Indiana.</p>\n<p data-order=\"24\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b329-4\">Since 1852, a married woman\u2019s real estate in Indiana has been her separate property.</p>\n<p data-order=\"25\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b329-5\">Mrs. Sims was thereafter; if not before, empowered to file her bill in the Eed\u00e9ral or the State court, and make her husband a defendant. This is in -addition to and entirely distinct from the right to sue at law given by the State statute. It .is incident to chancery jurisdiction, and her failure to resort to it in due time is such laches as will bar her recovery now.</p>\n<p data-order=\"26\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b329-6\">4. Though the chancery <em>power </em>of the Federal courts cannot be conferred or restrained by State legislation, yet in exercising it this court will recognize the rules of property established by such legislation, and' construe a- contract accordingly-. <em>Fairfield v.

S. 47.</p>\n<p data-order=\"27\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b329-7\">Under the statute of Indiana the deed in question was neither void nor absolutely and unconditionally voidable. It passed the present title upon delivery, and became unimpeachable, unless' avoided within a reasonable time. Though Mrs. Sims\u2019s declaration could not operate to bar a seasonable action of ejectment, it may be held an estoppel in these proceedings. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"306\">*306</page-number>Bispham, Principles of Equity, 293; 2 Story, Eq.

She gave notice of her disaffirmance almost immediately after she became <em>dis-covert, </em>\u2014 certainly within less than two months. This was, however, a. little more than twenty years after she attained her majority. \u25a0</p>\n<p id=\"b330-8\">The Circuit Court dismissed the complainant\u2019s bill for the reason that it did not appea-f she had disaffirmed the deed of May 28,1847, within a reasonable time after the attainment of her majority, being pf opinion that the' rule was established in Indiana she must have so disaffirmed it, notwithstanding her coverture; that is, in the same time as if she had been <em>discovert.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b330-9\">We find no decision of the Indiana courts that ought to be regarded as establishing that rule. The case relied upon by the appellees in support of the judgment of the Circuit Court is <em>Scranton </em>v. Stewart, 52 Ind. 68. The facts of that case, it must be admitted, were in some respects like those of the present, though in others essentially different. The plaintiff was at the time of her marriage an infant, aged sixteen. She was then seised in fee-simple of a tract \u00f3f land, containing forty-five acres, and also of an undivided interest in another tract. On the second day of March, 1864, when she was in the nineteenth year of'her age, <em>she </em>and <em>her </em>husband conveyed the lands to one George W. Stewart, for a consideration of $2,500, a considerable part of which -was paid. Mrs. Scranton came of age on the 12th of January, 1867, gave notice to Stewart of her disaffirmance of the &lt;ieed on the 22d of 'July, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"307\">*307</page-number>1870, and- shortly after brought her action to recover the land.' This was\u2019 more than three years and a half after she had attained her majority. The Supreme Court held that her disaffirmance was in time. It .was all the case required. But the judge went on to declare that a married woman who has made a deed of her lands during her infancy and. coverture must disaffirm it within a reasonable time after she arrives at age, notwithstanding her coverture, .and that the fact of the continued coverture would not extend the time \u25a0 for the disaffirmance. All this was (\u00a1biter.. It had nothing to do with the . case before the court. Nothing in the facts or the judgment required the assertion of such a rule. And it is observable that it was said in a case in which it appeared the married woman was seised of her land before her marriage, and that slie was married in 1864,- after the statutes of the State had greatly enlarged the power of a <em>feme covert </em>over her property. Those statutes had given her the rights of a <em>feme sole </em>in regard to her lands, and empowered her to sue as such without joining her husband. \u25a0 They had denied to \u00e1 husband the rights which at common law lie acquired in the wife\u2019s property by the marriage. They had made her lands and the profits of them her separate property, as fully at if she was unmarried, with the single exception that she could not incumber or convey them except by deed in which her husband should join.- The effect of the State statute, touching the marriage relation and the liabilities incident thereto, was in part considered <em>in Miles </em>v. <em>Lingerman </em>(24 id. 385), where it was said by. the Supreme Court of the State : \u201c Under our present statute the wife may bring her action in regard to her own estate as though she were a <em>feme sole. </em>Still our legislature has seen proper to continue the protection formerly accorded to her as a <em>feme </em>covert-, although as to her power to disaffirm her contracts made during minority her legal disability has been removed. . She has the .legal-power to disaffirm her contracts made during infancy, and to bring her action without the assent, and even' against the will, of her husband.\u201d \u25a0 This language, if not a positive assertion of its converse, contains at least a strong implication that her power to disaffirm a conveyance .made by her during infancy did not exist at common law, or before the statutes of 1847 and 1852 were enacted.</p>\n<p id=\"b332-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"308\">*308</page-number>We find nothing in any prior decision of the Indiana courts that sustains what was said <em>obiter </em>in <em>Scranton </em>v. <em>Stewart. Law </em>v. <em>Long </em>(41 Ind. 586), to which reference has 'been made, decided that the deed of a minor, conveying' her land for a valuable consideration, is'voidable only and not void, and that the right to avoid it on coming of age' is a personal privilege of the minor and her heirs. It also decided- that when the act of an infant is executed, as when -a deed has been made and delivered, the infant must, on attaining full age, do some act to disaffirm the contract, and that such act must precede the commencement of an action. But the case did 'not define what is a reasonable time, or rule that if the wife came of age during coverture she was bound to disaffirm the contract notwithstanding her coverture, as if she was a <em>feme sole. ' </em>In that case the conveyance was made by the wife- and her husband before the act of 1852 was passed. He died in 1852. She married again in 1853, and came of age in 1854. Her second husband died in 1864, and she married a third time in 1868; It was not until after her third marriage that her suit was brought. \u2022 She had been <em>discovert </em>during more than four years after her deed was made, and after she had reached her majosity, and yet she had taken no step or done any act to disaffirm the deed prior to the institution of her suit. No intimation is given in the case that she was bound to disaffirm or could disaffirm during her. coverture. Nothing, therefore, in <em>Law </em>v. <em>Long </em>supports what was said, but not decided, in <em>Scranton </em>v. <em>Stewart.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b332-5\">But if the law was accurately stated in the opinion given by the court in <em>Scranton </em>v. <em>Stewart, </em>as applicable to a deed of her lands made by an- infant <em>feme covert </em>after the statute of 1852, it by no means follows that it should rule the present case. There is a radical difference in the facts of the two cases. Mrs. Sims was married before the act of 1852 or that of 1847 was passed, and while the common law relative to the marriage relation existed. By the marriage her husband acquired a vested freehold interest in her lands, and became entitled to the rents and profits. His control over the usufruct thereof' became absolute. His- interest extended during their joint lives, or at least as long as the marriage relation continued. Tt was an interest capable of sale. When, therefore, the deed <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"309\">*309</page-number>was made to Mrs. Everhardt in 1846, it gave to the grantee the wife\u2019s right,\u2019 subject to disaffirmance, and the husband\u2019s right to the possession and enjoyment of the profits absolutely.When the wife subsequently came of age, she continued powerless to disturb the possession of the grantee, as long as her coverture lasted; for. the grantee held not only her right, but that also of her husband. The most she could have done was to give notice that she would, not be bound by her deed. Was she required to do that? To; answer the question it is important to keep in mind her condition at common law. , The land was not her separate estate,.such as the wife had in <em>Scranton </em>v. <em>Stewart. </em>In regard to it she was <em>sub potestate </em>viri, incapable of suing or making any contract without hey husband\u2019s assent. She could not even receive a grant of land if her, husband dissented. Her disability during her coverture was even greater \u25a0than that of an infant, and it is settled that an infant cannot disaffirm his deed while his infancy continues. <em>Zouch </em>v. <em>Par</em>sons, 3 Burr. 1794; Roof <em>v. </em>Stafford, 7 Cow. (N.Y.) 179. The reason is that a disaffirmance works a reinvestiture of the estate in\u2019 the infant, and he is pre\u00e1umed not to have sufficient discretion for that. Why should not the greater disability of coverture be attended with the same consequences ? If a wife cannot contract about any land which is not her separate property, how can she, without the concurrence of her husband, do any act, the effect of which is to transfer the title to land from another, to herself ?</p>\n<p id=\"b333-3\">We are not, however, called upon by the exigencies of this case to decide that a wife cannot, during her-coverture, disaffirm a deed which she made during her infancy. -The question now is, whether\u2019 Mrs. Sims did disaffirm her deed within a reasonable time after she attained her majority. What is a reasonable time is nowhere determined in such.a manner as to furnish a rule applicable to all cases. The question \u2019must always be answered in view of the peculiar \u25a0 circumstanc es of each case. <em>State </em>v. <em>Plaisted, </em>43 N. H. 413; <em>Jenkins </em>v. <em>Jenkins, </em>12 Iowa, 195, and. numerous other cases. It must be admitted that generally the disaffirmance must be within the period limited ,by the Statute of Limitations for bringing an action of ejectment. A much less time has m some cases been <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"310\">*310</page-number>held unreasonable. It is obvious that delay in some cases could have no justification, while in others it would be quite reasonable.</p>\n<p id=\"b334-3\">Now, in this case, though there was no disaffirmance for nearly twenty-one years after Mrs. Sims attained her majority, there were very remarkable reasons for the delay, sufficient,- in our opinion, to excuse it. When the deed was made she was laboring under a double disability, \u2014 infancy and coverture. \u2019Even if her deed and that of her husband had not conveyed his marital right to the possession and enjoyment of the land, she would have been under no obligation, imposed by the Statute of Limitations, to sue until both the disabilities had ceased; that is, until after 1870. It is an acknowledged rule that when there are two or more coexisting disabilities in the same person when his right of action accrues, he is not obliged to act until the last is removed. 2 Sugden, Vendors, 103, 482; <em>Mercer's Lessee </em>v. <em>Selden, </em>1 How. 37. This is the rule under the Statute of Limitations. But Mrs. Sims could not sue until after her divorce, and until the right the husband acquired by his marriage terminated. And had she given notice during her coverture of disaffirmance of her deed, it was in the power of her husband to disaffirm her disaffirmance. 2 Bishop, Married Women, sect. 392. Giving notice, therefore,- which was all she could do, would have been a vain thing. The law does not compel the performance of things that are vain. Mr. Bishop, in his work to which we have referred, says that if an infant, who is also a married woman, makes an instrument voidable because of her infancy, the disability of coverture enables her to postpone the act of avoidance to a reasonable time after the coverture is ended. Sect. 516. In support of this he refers to <em>Dodd </em>v. <em>Benthal, </em>4 Heisk. (Tenn.) 601, and <em>Matherson </em>v. Davis, 2 Coldw. (Tenn.) 443. These cases certainly sustain the rule stated in the text. In the former it was decided that an infant, who is also a married woman, has the option to dissent from her deed within a reasonable time after her discoverture, though her coverture may continue more than twenty years. And if this were not so, the disability of coverture, instead of being a prot\u00e9ction to the wife, as the la,w intends it, would be the contrary. We have <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"311\">*311</page-number>found.no decision that is in conflict with this doctrine, and no dicta even,- except 'those in <em>Scranton </em>v. <em>Stewart. </em>And why should the rule not be thus? The person who takes a dee\u2019d from an infant <em>feme covert </em>knows that she is not <em>sui </em>juris, and that she will be under the., control of her husband while the coverture lasts. He is bound to know, also, that she has the disability of Infancy. He assumes, therefore, the risk attending both those disabilities.</p>\n<p id=\"ATf\">. But the continued coverture of Mrs. Sims, after she attained full age, is not the only circumstance of importance to the inquiry whether she disaffirmed her. deed within a reasonable time. The circumstances under which the deed was made are to be considered.:. There is evidence that she .was constrained by her husband to execute the deed; that his conduct toward her was abusive, violent, and threatening, in order to induce her to consent to the sale; that she was intimidated by him; that a look from him would make her do almost anything, and that she was in a weak and nervous condition. It is not strange that a woman bound. to such -a husband should delay during -her coverture, disaffirming a contract which he' had forced her to make.</p>\n<p id=\"b335-4\">\u2022 Add 'to this, that she had very little opportunity to disaffirm until after her divorce. Before she had reached her majority she removed to another State, and never returned to the neighborhood of the property to reside. Betw\u00e9\u00e9h 1848 or 1849 and 1870 she made but two visits to Laporte, both on account of sickness or the death of a relative, and neither visit was prolonged beyond three, days. It is not a case, therefore, of standing by after she came of age and- seeing her property in the enjoyment of another.</p>\n<p id=\"b335-5\">And again, she never did any act after her deed was made .and after she came- \u00f3f age expressive of h\u00e9r consent to it or implying an affirmance of the' contract. The most s that is alleged against her is that she was silent during her coverture. But silence is not necessarily acquiescence.</p>\n<p id=\"ACr\">We are aware that the decisions respecting the disaffirmance of an infant\u2019s deed are not in entire harmony with each other. While it is generally agreed that the infant to avoid it must disaffirm it within a reasonable time after his-major-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"312\">*312</page-number>ity is attained, they differ as to what constitutes disaffirmance and as to the effect* of mere silence. Where there is nothing more than silence, many cases hold that an infant\u2019s deed may be.avoided at any time after his reaching majority until he is barred by the Statute of Limitations, and that silent acquiescence for any period less than the period of limitation is not a bar. Such was in effect the ruling in <em>Irvine </em>v. Irvine, 9 Wall. 617. See also <em>Prout </em>v. <em>Wiley </em>(2 Mich. 164), a well-considered case, and <em>Lessee of Drake </em>v. Ramsey, 5 Ohio, 251. But, on the other hand, there appears to be a greater number of cases which hold that silence during a much less period of time will be held to be a confirmation of the voidable deed. But they either rely upon <em>Holmes </em>v. <em>Blogg </em>(8 Taunt. 35), which was not a case of an infant\u2019s deed, or subsequent cases decided on its authority, or they rest in part upon other circumstances than mere silent acquiescence, such as. standing by without speaking while the grantee has made valuable improvements, or making use of the consideration for the deed. We think the preponderance of authority is that,-in deeds executed by infants, <em>mere </em>inertness or silence', continued for a period less than that prescribed by the Statute of Limitations, unless accompanied by affirmative acts, manifesting an-' intention to assent to the conveyance, will not bar the infant\u2019s right to avoid the deed. And,those confirmatory acts must be voluntary. As we have said, one who is under a disability to make a contract cannot confirm One that is voidable, or, what is the same thing, cannot disaffirm it. An affirmance or a disaffirmance is in its nature a mental assent, and necessarily implies the action of a free mind, exempt from all constraint or disability.</p>\n<p id=\"b336-5\">In view of these considerations, our conclusion is that Mrs. Sims, the complainant, having been a <em>feme covert </em>until 1870, and never having, done, during her coverture, any act to confirm the deed which she made during her infancy, could effectively disaffirm it in 1870, when she became a free agent, and that her notice of disaffirmance and her suit avoided her deed made in 1847.</p>\n<p id=\"b336-6\">The remaining question is whether she is estopped by anything which she has done from asserting her, right to the land <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"313\">*313</page-number>in controversy. In regard to this very little need be said. It is not insisted that she did anything since she attained her majority which can work an estoppel. All that is claimed is that when she made her deed she asserted that she was of age and competent to convey. We are not, therefore, required to' consider how far a married woman can be estopped by her acts when she has the single disability of coverture. The question is, whether acts and declarations of. an infant during infancy can estop him. from asserting the invalidity of his deed after he has attained his majority. In regard to this there can be no doubt, founded either upon reason or authority. Without spending time to look at the reason\", the authorities are all one way. An estoppel <em>in pais </em>is hot applicable to infants, and a fraudulent representation of capacity cannot be an equivalent for actual capacity. <em>Brown </em>v. <em>McClune, </em>5 Sandf. (N. Y.) 224; <em>Keen v. Coleman, </em>39 Pa. St. 299. A conveyance by an infant is an assertion of his right to convey. A contemporaneous declaration of his right or.of his age adds nothing to what is implied in his deed. An assertion of an estoppel against him is but a claim that he has assented or contracted. But he can no more do that effectively \"than he can make the' contract alleged to be \"confirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b337-5\">It is, however, unnecessary to dilate upon this branch of the case. \u2022 The judgment of the Circuit Court was not rested upon any estoppel of the '.complainant. \u2022</p>\n<p id=\"b337-6\">Our conclusion upon the whole matter is that the complainant was entitled to the decree for which she asked. The decree will-be reversed, and the record remitted with instructions to enter a decree in accordance with this opinion; and it is</p>\n<p id=\"b337-7\">\n<em>So ordered.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
