The twelfth section of the ninth article of the Constitution of Illinois, adopted .in 1870, declares that \u201c no county, city, township, school district, or other municipal corporation, shall be allowed to become indebted in any manner, or for any purpose, to an amount, including existing indebtedness,' in the aggregate exceeding five per centum on the val.ue of the taxable property therein, to be ascertained by the la3t assessment for State and county taxes previous to the incurring of such indebtedness.\u201d Under a statute of that\u2019State, approved April 15,1873, authorizing cities to construct waterworks, and for that purpose to appropriate and borrow money, andde.vy and collect a general tax in the same .manner as other municipal taxes may be levied and collected, the city of Litchfield, by her ordinance, authorized and' directed the issue of city bonds not exceeding a certain amount to be used for borrowing money for the erection, construction, and maintenance of water-works for the use. of the people of that city. Bonds in the form and amount prescribed were accordingly issued, bearing date Jan. 1, 1874. Bach recites that it \u201c is issued under authority of an act of the Gen-feral Assembly of the, State of Illinois, entitled \u2018An Act authorizing cities, incorporated towns, and villages to construct and maintain water-works/ approved April 15, 1873, and in pursuance of an ordinance of the said city of Litchfield, No. 184, and entitled \u2018 An Ordinance to provide for the issuing of bonds for the construction of the Litchfield water-works/ approved Dec. 4, 1873.\u201d The said twelfth section is not referred to in the statute or ' the ordinance, nor does the latter make mention of the city\u2019s indebtedness, although at the time of the issue of the bonds it exceeded-the constitutional limit. A <em>bona fide </em>holder of them brought suit upon the unpaid coupons thereto attached. \u25a0 <em>Held, </em>that he was not entitled to recover.</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"2\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b302-9\">2. Inasmuch as neither the Constitution nor the statute prescribes any mode by which a party dealing with the city can ascertain the amount of her indebtedness, <em>quiere, </em>if the bonds had contained' recitals which could be justly interpreted as amounting to a representation by her constituted authorities, that her indebtedness, increased by the amount of .the bonds, did not exceed the constitutional limit, would stye, as against a <em>bona fide </em>holder of them,; be estopped from disputing the truth of such representations.</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"3\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b302-11\">8.

Palmer </em>and <em>Mr. Prank Morison </em>for the plaintiff in error.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"37\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b307-11\">The defence relied upon by the city is the nullity of the \u2022 bonds by reason of her asserted absolute want of power to issue <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"284\">*284</page-number>them. It rests upon the constitutional clause, that \u201cno county,city, &amp;c., <em>shall be </em>allowed,\u201d &amp;c. The question arises, whether the clause operates <em>pjroprio vigore </em>upon municipal corporations, and imposes an actual limitation upon them, or whether it enjoins a 'duty upon the legislature, when either creating them or providing for the government and control of such as are already in existence. The sounder view, we submit, is that it requires for its enforcement legislation prescribing, under adequate penalties, the duties of the officers of a municipal corporation and declaring the mode by which those dealing with them may ascertain its indebtedness. None has been enacted.</p>\n<p data-order=\"38\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AevJ\">But, conceding the clause to be self-operating, it does not -unconditionally prohibit the . city from contracting debts\u2019for .the purposes enumerated in'its charter, or in the act of April 15, 1873. That power is expressly granted, and the limitation upon it taking effect only under certain circumstances, the question as to when it may be lawfully exercised must be necessarily dependent upon the decision of the city council whether they do in 'fact exist. \u2022 That body alone has access to the means- by which they can be investigated and determined. The passage of the ordinance, so far as innocent third parties are concerned, was a final and authoritative declaration, by those who were clothed with authority'to make it, that no circumstances existed \\vhich precluded the exercise of that power. The bonds issued, whereon the money wa.s raised to ' carry that ordinance into effect, are, therefore, valid securities in the hands, of a <em>bona fide </em>holder for value. The city is as effectually estopped by their recitals as'if 'the ordinance had declared in express terms, as it now does virtually and by necessary implication, that, at the time of its passage, her.debt, including that thereby incurred, would not be in excess of the prescribed amount.</p>\n<p data-order=\"39\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b308-4\">Under the well-settled rule of this court, .that nothing but a total want o.f power renders this class of securities void in the hands of such a holder, bonds issued without proper formalities, bonds issued contrary to the provisions of the laws authorizing them, bonds fraudulently, issued, Stolen bonds, the proceeds of'which .never reached the. municipalities ' issuing them, and bonds declared to be invalid by the courts of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"285\">*285</page-number>States in wbicb they were issued, have all been pronounced good here. The municipalities have been held to the payment of them,' without regard 'to any equities which would constitute a good defence against a party who had notice of them. <em>Commissioners of Knox County </em>v. <em>Aspinwall, </em>21 How. 539;<em> Moran </em>v. <em>Miami County, </em>2 Black, 732; <em>Mercer County </em>v. <em>Hacket, </em>1 Wall. 83; <em>Mayor </em>v. <em>Muscatine, </em>id. 384; <em>Kennicott </em>v. <em>Supervisors, </em>16 id. 452; <em>Supervisors </em>v. <em>Schenk, 5 </em>id. 784; <em>County of Daviess </em>v. <em>Huidekoper, </em>98 U.

Each recited that it was issued by virtue of and. in accordance with that statute, and in \u2022 pursuance of and in accordance with the rote of three-fifths of the legal voters of the township. A recovery' was resisted, upon the ground that the authorized amount was exceeded; but this court held the bonds to be valid in the hands of a <em>bona fide </em>holder, and remarked:' \u201cIt is to.be observed that every prerequisite fact to the execution and issue of the bonds was of a nature that required examination and decision. The existence of sufficient taxable property to warrant the amount of the subscription and issue was no more essential to the exercise of the authority conferred upon the board of county commissioners than, was the petition for the election, or the fact that fifty freeholders \u25a0had signed, &amp;c. These are all extrinsic facts, bearing not so much upon the authority vested1 in the board 'to issue the bonds, as upon the question whether that authority should be exercised.\u201d ,</p>\n<p data-order=\"41\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b309-5\">The bonds now in question recite,that they are issued under the authority of an act of the General Assembly and pursuant to an ordinance of the city. -The cases are not distinguishable in principle. The only difference in point of fact is that the' <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"286\">*286</page-number>prohibition in one is declared by statute, and in the other by a constitutional provision. It is hardly necessary to say that a law passed pursuant to the Constitution has, while it remains in force, the same binding efficacy as the Constitution itself.</p>\n<p data-order=\"42\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AS_\">In <em>Humboldt Township </em>v. <em>Long </em>(id. 642), which was governed by the same statute, the required notice of the popular election was not given. This court, however, reaffirming the doctrines of <em>Marcy </em>v. <em>Township of </em>Oswego, ruled, in view of the recitals -in the bonds, \u2014 and they are not substantially different in effect from those in the present case, \u2014 that the township was liable. Unless the vote cast at such an election was in favor of the issue of the bonds, the commissioners were not authorized to order it.- Their decision that the election had been duly held, although only inferrible from their- order \u2022 for the issue, was regarded as conclusive. So here, under the statute of Illinois and her Constitution, giving to the latter the broadest effect, it was. a condition precedent to the power. of the city council that certain facts, peculiarly if not exclusively within its knowledge, should exist, but which a third party had no means of ascertaining. The exercise of the power was a decision by the appointed tribunal 'that such facts existed. We may therefore insist, in the language of Mr, Justice Strong, that \u201cthe bonds are not invalid by reason of their having been voted and issued in excess of the statutory (constitutional) limit.\u201d <em>Wilson </em>v. <em>Salamanca </em>(99 id. 499) is to the same effect, and the. decisions here contain nothing in conflict therewith.</p>\n<p data-order=\"43\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b310-6\">If the city had contracted with a party to erect the water-works, she, after accepting them and enjoying the benefit and protection which they afford, could n\u00f3t set up that the contract entailed upon .her a debt in excess of the amount she was allowed to incur. <em>Union Water Co. </em>v. <em>Murphy's Flat Fluming Co., </em>22 Cal. 650; <em>Whitney Arms Co. </em>v. <em>Barlow et al., </em>63 N. Y. 62. The bondholders\u2019 case is as meritorious as his, because their money was, in this instance, faithfully applied to the construction and maintenance of those works.</p>\n<p data-order=\"44\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b310-7\">Again, if the city, with a knowledge of .her then indebtedness, passed the ordinance, sold the bonds, and received into her treasury the money therefor, can she set up her own fraud to exempt her from liability to pay it? 'The.doctrine of <em>ultra </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"287\">*287</page-number><em>vires </em>has no application to such a case, and she, to the same extent as an individual, is liable for the acts of her servants, who, in their appropriate sphere of duty, are engaged in the transaction of her business.</p>\n<p data-order=\"45\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b311-5\">No assessment of, the taxable property of the city of Litchfield was made or authorized to be-made in-the. year 1873, and the.value of that property was, therefore, not \u201cascertained,\u201d as provided for in the constitutional provision.</p>\n<p data-order=\"46\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b311-6\">This being so, the remaining evidence shows that the valuation of the towns of North and South Litchfield was ascertained by their assessors; that other officers ascertained the value of the railroad property, and still others that of the school property in a part of the county in which Litchfield is situated; and that, by compiling these different returns, the \u00e1ssessable valuation of the property in the city of Litchfield may be determined.</p>\n<p data-order=\"47\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b311-7\">It is not in evidence that it was the duty of any city officer to so compile these'various returns, or that any authorized person ever did so; but the court is now asked to- do it, and so far constitute itself a city functionary as to make from these returns an estimate of the taxable value of the then property in the city.</p>\n<p data-order=\"48\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b311-8\">The fact indispensable to make out tbe defendant\u2019s case on this point is the ascertained taxable value of this property in T8-73.

The authority, therefore; conferred by the act of April 15, 1873, to incur <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"288\">*288</page-number>indebtedness in the construction and maintenance of a system of water-works, could have been lawfully exercised by a city, incorporated town, or village, only when its liabilities, increased by any proposed new indebtedness, would be within the eonsti-tutional limit. No legislation could confer upon a municipal corporation authority to contract indebtedness which the Constitution expressly declared it should not be allowed to incur. <em>Law et al. </em>v. <em>The People ex rel. </em>87 Ill. <em>385; Fuller </em>v. <em>City of </em>Chicago, 89 id. 282.</p>\n<p id=\"b312-5\">. It was proved that the debt of the city of Litchfield on and before the 1st of January, 1874, exclusive of the water bonds, was |70,OfiO.</p>\n<p id=\"Asv\">If, therefore, it 'appears, by evidence, of which the city may rightfully avail itself, as against a <em>bona fide </em>holder for value of the coupons in suit, that the bonds, issued'Jan. 1,1874, created an indebtedness in excess of the amount to which municipal' indebtedness is restricted by the Constitution, there would seem to be no escape from the conclusion that thfe bonds are void for the want of legal authority to issue them at the' time they .were issued.</p>\n<p id=\"b312-7\">To the evidence upon which the city relied as showing such .want of authority, objections were interposed by the plaintiff, 'who insisted'that it was not admissible against him,\" as a <em>bona fide </em>holder of the coupons in suit.</p>\n<p id=\"b312-8\">That evidence was made the basis of important findings of fact. Introduced for the purpose of showing the value of taxable property within .the limits, of the city, and the extent of her indebtedness, when these .water bonds were issued, it is nbt, in our opinion, liable to any serious objection. It seemed to be the best proof upon those subjects that the law furnished.</p>\n<p id=\"b312-9\">In determining whether the constitutional limit of indebtedness has been exceeded by a municipal corporation, an inquiry' would always be necessary, as to the amount of taxable property within its boundaries. Such inquiry would be solved, not by information derived, from individual officers of the municipality, but only in the mode prescribed in the Constitution; that is, by reference to the last assessment for State and county taxes for the year preceding the issuing of the bonds. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"289\">*289</page-number>That test was applied in this case.- Had there been, under or by competent legal authority, an assessment for that year of taxable property within the city, separately from all other property in the county or township to which the city belonged, such assessment would undoubtedly have been controlling. But there was no such official assessment, in fact, or required by'law. There were, however, official assessments for State and county taxes for 1873, embracing all taxable property within\u2018the county and townships of which the city formed a part, and from which, in connection with the map of the city, could be readily ascertained the location and taxable value of all property within the corporate limits of the city for that year. The purchaser \u00f3f the bonds was certainly bound to take notice not only of the constitutional limitation upon municipal indebtedness, but of such facts as the authorized official assessments disclosed concerning the valuation of taxable property within the city for the year 1873.</p>\n<p id=\"b313-3\">But in what way was' the purchaser to ascertain the extent of the city\u2019s indebtedness existing at the time the bonds in question were issued? The extent of that indebtedness was a fact peculiarly within the knowledge of the constituted authorities of the city. It was necessarily left, both by the Con- \u2022 stitution and the statute of 1873, to their examination and determination, under the constitutional injunction, however, that no municipal corporation should exceed the prescribed amount of indebtedness. It was, nevertheless, a fact which, so far as we are advised by the record, could not at all times and absolutely, or with reasonable certainty, be ascertained from any official documents to which the public had access. A like difficulty, perhaps, would arise in the case- of any municipal corporation, possessing the general power of raising money, by taxation and otherwise, to carry on local government. Its liabilities might frequently vary in their aggregate amount, and at particular periods might be of different kinds, some fixed and absolute, while others would be contingent upon events thereafter to happen. These . considerations were, doubtless, present in the minds as well of those who framed the Constitution as of those who passed the' statute of 1873.</p>\n<p id=\"b314-2\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"290\">*290</page-number>As, therefore, neither the Constitution nor 'the statute prescribed any rule or test by which persons contracting with municipal corporations should ascertain the extent of their,. \u201c existing indebtedness,\u201d it would seem that if the bonds in question, had contained recitals which, upon any fair construction, amounted to a representation, upon the part of the constituted authorities of the city that the requirements of the Constitution were met, \u2014 that is, that the- city\u2019s indebtedness, increased by the amount of the bonds in question, was within the constitutional limit, \u2014 then the city, under the decisions of this court, might have been estopped from disputing the truth of such representations as against a <em>Iona fide </em>holder of its bonds. The case might then, perhaps, have been brought within the rule announced by this court in <em>Town of Coloma </em>v. <em>Eaves </em>(92 U. S. 484), in which case we said, and now repeat, that \u201c where legislative authority has been given to a municipality, or to its officers, to subscribe .for the' stock of a railroad company, and to issue municipal bonds in payment, but only \"on some precedent condition, such as a popular vote favoring the subscription, and where it may be gathered from the legislative enactment that the officers of the municipality were invested with power to1 decide whether the condition precedent has been complied with, <em>their recital that it has been, </em>made on the bonds issued by them and held by a <em>bona fide </em>purchaser, is conclusive of the fact, and binding upon the municipality1 ; for the recital is itself a decision of the fact by th\u00e9 appointed tribunal.\u201d So,-in the more-recent case of <em>Orleans </em>v. <em>Pratt </em>(99 id. 676), it was said that \u201cwhere the bonds on their face <em>recite the circumstances which bring them within the power, </em>the corporation is estopped to deny the truth of the \u2022 recital.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b314-3\">The cases cited by counsel for the plaintiff do not' assert any different doctrines, as will be seen from an examination of those, chiefly relied upon. In <em>Commissioners of Knox County </em>v. <em>Aspinwall </em>(21 How. 539), whic'h was a case of municipal subscription of stock in a railroad company, the statute upon which the subscription there purported to rest made the existence of certain facts essential-to the exercise of authority to make the subscription and issue bonds therefor. The bonds, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"291\">*291</page-number>upon their face, however, recited that they were issued <em>in pursuance of </em>the statute, which prescribed the conditions pre-. cedent to any subscription, and, therefore, the court said, they imported a compliance with the law under which they were issued. It was, consequently, ruled that the purchaser was not bound to look further for evidence of a compliance with the condition annexed to the grant, of the power.</p>\n<p id=\"b315-5\">In <em>Kenicott </em>v. <em>Supervisors </em>(16 Wall. 452), the rule was thus stated: \u201c If an election or other fact is required to authorize the issue of the bonds of a municipal corporation, and if the result of that election, or the existence of that fact, is by law; to be ascertained and declared by any judge, officer, or tribunal, and that judge, officer, or tribunal, on behalf of the corporation, executes' or issues the bonds, <em>with a recital that the election has been held or thzt the fact exists or has taken </em>place, this will be sufficient evidence of the fact to all <em>bona fide </em>holders of the bonds.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b315-6\">In <em>County of Moultrie </em>v. <em>Savings Bank </em>(92 U. S. 631), the validity of the bonds there in suit was questioned, upon the ground that certain precedent conditions imposed by statute had not been complied with. The bonds, however, recited their issue to be \u201c <em>in conformity to the </em>provisions\u201d of the statute which gave the authority-to issue them. So, in <em>Marcy </em>v. <em>Township of Oswego </em>(id. 637), where the statute authorizing a municipal subscription, with the sanction of- three-fifths of the voters interested, and the issue of bonds in payment thereof, required particular facts to exist and certain acts to be performed before the right to make the subscription and to issue bonds in discharge thereof could be. exercised. The statute.contained, amongst other things, a proviso to the effect \u25a0that the amount of bonds sold by the township should not exceed such a sum as vhuld require a levy of more than one per cent per annum on the taxable property of the township to pay the ye'arly interest. It' appeared that the statute had not, in some of these respects, been complied with; that is, that the conditions had not been performed which the statute required before any subscription should be made or bonds issued. But, adhering to the rule announced in <em>Town of Coloma </em>v. <em>Eaves, </em>the defence was overruled in favor of a <em>bona fide </em>holder for <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"292\">*292</page-number>value, because of the <em>recital </em>in the bonds that their issue was \u201c <em>by virtue of, </em>and <em>in accordance </em>with,\u201d the statute, and \u201c <em>in pursuance of, </em>and <em>in accordance with, </em>the vote of three-fifths of the legal voters of the township.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b316-5\">Returning to the case in hand, it will be observed that the bonds issued by the city of Litchfield contain no recital whatever' of the circumstances which, under the Constitution of the State, must have existed before the city could legally incur the indebtedness for which the bonds were issued. They purport, it is true, to be issued under the authority of the act of April 15, 1873, and in pursuance of the ordinance of the.city based upon that statute. But that statute does not expressly restrict the exercise of the power to erect and maintain a system of water-works to cases in which the aggregate indebtedness of' the city was within tfye limit which the Constitution declared no municipal corporation should exceed. Nor does the city ordinance recite or state, even in general terms, that the proposed indebtedness was incurred in pursuance of or in accordance with the Constitution of the State, or under the circumstances which permitted the issue of the bonds. Consequently, a recital that the bonds were issued under the authority of the statute, and in pursuance of the city ordinance,' did not necessarily import a compliance with the Constitution.' Had \u2022 the bonds made the additional recital that they were issued in accordance with the Constitution, or had the ordinance stated, in any form, that the proposed indebtedness was within the constitutional limit, or had the statute restricted the exercise of the authority therein conferred to those municipal corporations whose indebtedness did not, at the time, exceed the constitutional limit, there would have been ground for holding that the city could not, as against the plaintiff, dispute the fair inference to be drawn, from such recital or statement, as to the extent of its existing indebtedness.</p>\n<p id=\"b316-6\">Any different conclusion from that indicated would extend the doctrines of' this court upon the subject of municipal bonds farther than would be consistent.'with reason and sound policy, and farther than we are now willing to go. The present action cannot be maintained, unless we should hold that the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"293\">*293</page-number><em>mere fact </em>that the bonds <em>were </em>issued, without any recitals of the circumstances bringing them within the limit fixed by the Constitution, was; in itself, conclusive proof, in favor of a <em>Iona fide </em>.holder, that the circumstances existed which authorized them to be issued. We cannot so hold. \u2022</p>\n<p id=\"b317-4\">Our attention is called by counsel to the exceeding hardship of this case upon those whose money, it is alleged, has supplied the city of Litchfield with a system of water-works, the benefits of which are daily enjoyed by its inhabitants. The defence is characterized as fraudulent and dishonest.' Waiving all considerations of the case, in its moral aspects, it is only necessary to say that the settled principles of law cannot, with safety to the public, be disregarded in order to remedy the hardships of special cases.</p>\n<p id=\"ASv\">Whether the city is under a legal obligation to make restitution of the money, obtained without authority of law, that is, to refund to \u25a0 the proper party or parties such sums as were actually received by its authorized agents or officers upon the sale of the bonds, is not a question arising in the present action, which is only for the recovery of the stipulated interest upon such bonds. Upon this point it is not proper at this time, or in this form of action, to express an opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b317-6\">What we have said constitutes a sufficient answer to all of the questions certified to us, and requires an affirmance of the judgment. .</p>\n<p id=\"b317-7\">\n<em>Judgment affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
