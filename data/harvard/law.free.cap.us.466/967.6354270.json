Hence, it seems, at least, that petitioner Professional Positioners, Inc., may reproduce those documents on larger paper. Petitioner now moves that \u201cit be permitted to file a single appendix containing both the patent in suit and the decisions of the two courts below rather than preparing separate appendices,\u201d arguing that it would be \u201cmore convenient for the court to have a single appendix\u201d and would be \u201cunduly clumsy and ex<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"968\">*968</page-number>pensive to prepare a separate appendix solely for the opinions below of a size different than the appendix containing the patent.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b962-5\">No set of procedural rules can anticipate every problem that may arise in litigation. Courts must therefore retain the power to grant exceptions when a litigant\u2019s request fully accommodates the court\u2019s needs and when strict compliance would be wasteful. This movant\u2019s request to submit a single appendix on the same size paper as the patent at issue is perfectly reasonable and should be granted.</p>\n<p id=\"b962-6\">Presumably the Court has denied the motion because it believes the value of the time saved by simply requiring literal compliance with all of its Rules in all cases will outweigh the cost of occasional inconvenience and undue expense. My experience has persuaded me, however, that motions of this kind can be fairly processed so rapidly that the cost of exercising judgment and common sense will not only be trivial, but will actually produce a net savings to the Court in the long run. Surely less time would be spent than the Court has recently devoted to a careful scrutiny of every debatable motion to proceed <em>in forma pauperis. </em>See generally <em>Brown </em>v. <em>Herald Co., </em>464 U. S. 928, 931 (1983) (Stevens, J., dissenting). I would grant petitioner\u2019s sensible motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b962-7\">I respectfully dissent.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
