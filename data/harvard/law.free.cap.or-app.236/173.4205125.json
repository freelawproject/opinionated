She assigns error to the trial court\u2019s denial of her motion to suppress evidence \u2014 namely, a methamphetamine pipe \u2014 found when police officers searched her while conducting a warranted search of a residence that she was visiting. Because we conclude that the search was not justified, we reverse and remand.</p>\n<p id=\"b205-5\">We review the trial court\u2019s legal conclusions regarding the constitutionality of a search for errors of law. <em>State v. Ehly, </em>317 Or 66, 75, 854 P2d 421 (1993). We are bound by the court\u2019s findings of fact if there is constitutionally sufficient evidence in the record to support them. <em>State v. Pamperien, </em>156 Or App 153, 155, 967 P2d 503 (1998).</p>\n<p id=\"b205-6\">Defendant, who was not named in the warrant, was present when police executed warrants to search Parras\u2019s premises and to arrest him. Parras had a \u201cvery violent criminal history of assaults,\u201d including involvement in a second-degree manslaughter. Police had executed another warrant to search Parras\u2019s premises about four months earlier. During that earlier search, they found a loaded pistol within an arm\u2019s reach of Parras. Savage, one of the officers involved, testified that Parras\u2019s history raised concerns about threats to the officers\u2019 safety during execution of the later warrant. In addition, two informants had told Savage that, after the execution of the first search warrant, Parras had been very upset and had made threatening statements.</p>\n<p id=\"b205-7\">Police returned to Parras\u2019s home to execute the warrant involved in this case. Savage knocked twice on the door of a fifth-wheel trailer, which he understood to be Parras\u2019s living quarters, and announced, \u201cPolice, search warrant.\u201d He heard someone moving inside the trailer and then heard a female voice saying, \u201cI\u2019m coming.\u201d Savage opened the trailer door and saw defendant pick up a purse, put it on her shoulder, and step out the door. Savage then told defendant that she was being detained but not arrested. He had her place her hands behind her back, removed the purse from her shoulder, and handcuffed her.</p>\n<p id=\"b206-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"176\">*176</page-number>After a few minutes, another officer, Morgan, patted down defendant. Defendant was wearing cowboy boots, and the pant legs of her blue jeans were over the boots. Morgan lifted defendant\u2019s pant leg to look inside her boot. Morgan explained that she did so because \u201ctypically most people will hide things inside their boots[ \u2014 Jknives, guns, <em>et cetera[ </em>\u2014 ] and it was loose enough at the top that there could be something in between the skin and the boot * * Inside defendant\u2019s boot, Morgan saw a glass methamphetamine pipe, which she seized.</p>\n<p id=\"b206-4\">After defendant was charged with possession of a controlled substance, she moved to suppress the evidence found in her boot, and the trial court denied that motion. The court concluded that Morgan\u2019s actions \u2014 lifting defendant\u2019s pant leg and looking in her boot \u2014 did not exceed the scope of a reasonable frisk conducted for officer safety. The court explained that feeling the outside of a boot was like \u201cpatting a briefcase or patting something else that\u2019s made of leather or some heavier material.\u201d Defendant entered a guilty plea, reserving the right to challenge the denial of her suppression motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b206-5\">On appeal, defendant renews her contention that the evidence found as a result of the search of her boot should have been suppressed because the search violated her rights under Article I, section 9, of the Oregon Constitution. In her view, even if the officers had reasonable safety concerns to justify detaining and frisking her, those concerns did not justify the search of her boot. The state responds that, because defendant\u2019s boots impaired Morgan\u2019s ability to complete a frisk, it was necessary to lift the pant leg in order to complete an effective frisk.</p>\n<p id=\"b206-6\">Article I, section 9, provides, in part, \u201cNo law shall violate the right of the people to be secure in their persons, houses, papers, and effects, against unreasonable search, or seizure[.]\u201d Nevertheless, an officer may</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b206-7\">\u201ctake reasonable steps to protect himself or others if, during the course of a lawful encounter with a citizen, the officer develops a reasonable suspicion, based on specific and articulable facts, that the citizen might pose an immediate <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"177\">*177</page-number>threat of serious physical injury to the officer or to others then present.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b207-4\"><em>State v. Bates, </em>304 Or 519, 524, 747 P2d 991 (1987). Although we do not \u201cuncharitably second-guess an officer\u2019s judgment\u201d in such cases, <em>id., </em>we must determine \u201cwhether the <em>particular </em>step taken by the police was one that was reasonable under the <em>particular </em>circumstances, not whether that step was within the range of reasonable responses to officer safety concerns <em>in general,\u201d State v. Rudder, </em>347 Or 14, 22, 217 P3d 1064 (2009) (emphasis in original).</p>\n<p id=\"b207-5\">In <em>Rudder, </em>a police officer attempted to conduct a patdown search of the defendant, but the defendant twice turned away when the officer tried to touch the defendant\u2019s pocket. The officer and a second officer then handcuffed the defendant and, instead of completing the patdown, the first officer pulled open the defendant\u2019s pocket, shined a flashlight into it, and discovered a container of a white crystalline substance that turned out to be methamphetamine. <em>Id. </em>at 16-17. The court concluded that, although a patdown search of the defendant\u2019s exterior clothing was justified, the more intrusive search of the defendant\u2019s pocket was not: \u201cA patdown, because of its limited intrusiveness, is constitutionally permissible if it is based on a reasonable suspicion of a threat to officer safety. But intrusion <em>into </em>a suspect\u2019s clothing requires something more \u2014 either probable cause or some greater justification than was present here.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 25 (footnote omitted; emphasis in original).</p>\n<p id=\"b207-6\">Similarly here, Morgan conducted a search that went beyond an ordinary patdown when she intruded into defendant\u2019s clothing \u2014 that is, when she lifted defendant\u2019s pant leg to look inside defendant\u2019s boot. The state contends that .Rudder is factually distinguishable because, here, an exterior patdown of defendant\u2019s boots would not have permitted Morgan to determine whether defendant had a weapon in her boot. We note that there was no testimony describing the boots in any more detail than \u201ccowboy boots,\u201d and Morgan did not testify about what she could or could not feel through defendant\u2019s boot. Even assuming that the boot was thick enough to prevent Morgan from feeling anything hidden in the boot, defendant was handcuffed at the time that she was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"178\">*178</page-number>searched and thus did not have access to anything hidden under her pant leg and inside her boot. <em>See, </em>e.g., <em>State v. Petri, </em>214 Or App 138, 144, 162 P3d 1053 (2007) (concluding that opening a sunglasses case was not justified, because the contents of the case posed no threat where the officer already had taken the case from the handcuffed defendant\u2019s pocket). Here, under the circumstances, the more intrusive search was not justified, and the trial court erred in denying defendant\u2019s motion to suppress.</p>\n<p id=\"b208-4\">Reversed and remanded.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
