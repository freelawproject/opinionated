They sought defendant\u2019s consent to search his home, but he refused. The officers then arrested defendant on an outstanding warrant. Once defendant had been escorted from his home and placed in a patrol car, the officers sought and obtained consent from the co-occupant of the home to enter and seize firearms. The question in this case is whether, for purposes of the Fourth Amendment, the co-occupant\u2019s voluntary consent justified the warrantless entry of the home, notwithstanding defendant\u2019s earlier objection. The issue is one that has split federal circuit courts in the wake of <em>Georgia v. Randolph, </em>547 US 103, 126 S Ct 1515, 164 L Ed 2d 208 (2006), and one of first impression in this court. For the reasons that follow, we hold that defendant\u2019s arrest did not vitiate his previously registered objection to a search of his home, and that the co-occupant\u2019s subsequent consent was ineffective as to defendant. Accordingly, we reverse and remand.</p>\n<p id=\"b246-5\">We recite the facts \u201cconsistently with the trial court\u2019s factual findings and its decision denying defendant\u2019s motion to suppress.\u201d <em>State v. Shaff, </em>343 Or 639, 641, 175 P3d 454 (2007). In September 2006, defendant\u2019s neighbor reported to police that she had seen defendant, whom she knew to be a felon, carrying a rifle from his vehicle; police also received a report that there was a \u201cdog-at-large\u201d near defendant\u2019s residence. Officers Hargis and Pole responded separately to those reports and encountered defendant and his girlfriend, Hanscomb, in the driveway of their home. Hargis asked defendant and Hanscomb where they had been, and they replied that they had been target shooting. Hanscomb told the officers that she had attempted to use a new rifle, but it had malfunctioned. Defendant admitted carrying the rifle\u2019s case, but he denied carrying or using the rifle itself. Rather, he claimed to have fired only a BB or pellet gun.</p>\n<p id=\"b246-6\">Hargis then asked about the location of the guns. Hanscomb told him that the rifle was in a gun cabinet in the house, along with another rifle that she owned. Defendant indicated that there were also pistols in the house that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"217\">*217</page-number>belonged to his sons. At that point, Hargis contacted dispatch and confirmed that defendant was, in fact, a convicted felon. Hargis also learned that there was a warrant out for defendant\u2019s arrest.</p>\n<p id=\"b247-3\">Hargis next asked defendant and Hanscomb, both of whom lived at the house, whether they would consent to a search of the house and seizure of the firearms. Hanscomb indicated that she would consent, but defendant refused, telling the police, \u201cNo, get a warrant.\u201d Defendant also told Hanscomb to call an attorney.</p>\n<p id=\"b247-4\">After defendant refused to allow the officers to enter his house, they took him into custody on the arrest warrant and escorted him away from the house. Additional officers arrived on the scene, and Hanscomb was led into the house to get a telephone book to call an attorney. She returned outside and began making phone calls.</p>\n<p id=\"b247-5\">Meanwhile, Hargis had phoned the district attorney, Schutt, to discuss whether to obtain a search warrant, and shortly after defendant was arrested, Schutt arrived at the house. He explained to Hanscomb that she could either voluntarily turn over the firearms that were in the house, or he could apply for a search warrant. Hanscomb then asked for and received permission to make additional phone calls, which she did for 10 to 15 minutes. After mulling her options, Hanscomb told Schutt that she would not consent to a search of the house but would \u201cconsent to let the officers take the guns.\u201d Schutt passed that information along to Hargis, expecting him to \u201cdeal with getting them turned over physically.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b247-6\">Hargis spoke with Hanscomb about the logistics of retrieving the firearms from inside the house. Hargis had officer safety concerns about Hanscomb entering and retrieving the firearms on her own, and Hanscomb agreed to allow Hargis and another officer to accompany her into the house. Once they entered the house, Hanscomb led the officers to a gun cabinet, which she opened. The officers could see \u201cnumerous firearms and ammunition,\u201d and seven guns were seized \u2014 two pistols, two shotguns, and three rifles. Three of the guns were loaded, and the officers \u201cma[d]e those safe.\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"218\">*218</page-number>The police were in the house for a total of six or seven minutes.</p>\n<p id=\"b248-3\">Defendant was charged with multiple counts of felon in possession of a firearm, ORS 166.270. He then moved to suppress evidence of the firearms seized by police when they entered his home. The motion was based on <em>Randolph, </em>a then-recent decision in which the Supreme Court held that \u201ca physically present co-occupant\u2019s stated refusal to permit entry prevails\u201d over the voluntary consent of the other occupant. 547 US at 106. Defendant contended that his circumstances were indistinguishable from those in <em>Randolph, </em>and that the warrantless entry into his home was unreasonable, notwithstanding Hanscomb\u2019s later consent to the officers\u2019 entry and seizure of evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b248-4\">The state, in response, argued that defendant\u2019s situation was entirely distinguishable from <em>Randolph, </em>and the warrantless entry was justified, because the police did not \u201csearch\u201d defendant\u2019s home over his objection, as they had done in <em>Randolph-, </em>rather, with Hanscomb\u2019s consent, they entered the house for the specific purpose of seizing evidence that Hanscomb herself could have delivered to them. The trial court was persuaded by that reasoning and denied defendant\u2019s motion on the ground that \u201cthe police had valid consent from a household member to seize certain items from her house over the objections of the defendant that the state could not search.\u201d The court further explained:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b248-5\">\u201c[TJhere is a distinct difference between a search and seizure, and had the state conducted a search, rather than a seizure, over the objection of defendant, the result of this motion would be different. However, the state did not search and merely retrieved evidence upon the consent of a party having control over that object.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b248-6\">Following the denial of his motion to suppress, defendant entered a conditional guilty plea to four counts of felon in possession of a firearm, reserving the right to appeal the denial of his motion to suppress.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b248-7\">On appeal, defendant reprises his arguments that the warrantless entry into his home was indeed a search; <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"219\">*219</page-number>that, in any event, the Fourth Amendment, as made applicable to the states by the Fourteenth Amendment, prohibits police from entering a person\u2019s home \u2014 without a warrant and over the person\u2019s objection \u2014 to find and remove evidence; and that the case is indistinguishable from <em>Randolph. </em>The state, in response, essentially jettisons its argument below (and the trial court\u2019s reasoning) that <em>Randolph </em>is inapplicable because police entered the home to \u201cseize\u201d but not \u201csearch.\u201d Instead, the state now contends that, once defendant was arrested, the Fourth Amendment calculus changed, because he was no longer \u201cpresent and objecting\u201d to the search; in that circumstance, the state argues, Hanscomb\u2019s authority to consent to the officers\u2019 entry of the home prevails over defendant\u2019s earlier objection.</p>\n<p id=\"b249-4\">Because it is central to the issue before us, we begin by discussing <em>Randolph </em>in some detail. That case arose out of a domestic dispute between Janet Randolph and her husband, Scott Randolph. Janet Randolph complained to the police that her husband had taken their son away, and when officers arrived at their house, she told them that her husband had a cocaine habit that was creating financial troubles for the couple. Shortly after the police arrived, Scott Randolph returned home and explained that he had taken their son to a neighbor\u2019s house out of concern that his wife would leave the country with the child. 547 US at 107.</p>\n<p id=\"b249-5\">After their son was reclaimed from the neighbor\u2019s house, Janet Randolph renewed her complaints about her husband\u2019s drug use and also volunteered that there was drug evidence in the house. <em>Id. </em>At that point, one of the officers asked Scott Randolph for consent to search the house, \u201cwhich he unequivocally refused.\u201d <em>Id. </em>The officer then turned to J anet Randolph for consent, \u201cwhich she readily gave.\u201d <em>Id. </em>She led the officers into the house to an upstairs bedroom, which she identified as her husband\u2019s. The officer noticed a drinking straw with a powdery residue that he suspected was cocaine. He left the house to obtain an evidence bag and to call the district attorney\u2019s office. The district attorney\u2019s office instructed the officer to apply for a search warrant, which he did. Police returned after obtaining the warrant and seized further evidence of drug use, and Scott Randolph was indicted for possession of cocaine. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b250-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"220\">*220</page-number>Scott Randolph then moved to suppress the evidence of drug use on the ground that it was the product of the initial, warrantless search of his house. The trial court denied the motion on the ground that Janet Randolph had common authority to consent to that search. The Georgia Court of Appeals, and then the Georgia Supreme Court, disagreed with that conclusion, holding that Janet Randolph\u2019s consent to search was invalid in the face of Scott Randolph\u2019s objection. The United States Supreme Court \u201cgranted certiorari to resolve a split of authority on whether one occupant may give law enforcement effective consent to search shared premises, as against a co-tenant who is present and states a refusal to permit the search.\u201d 547 US at 108.</p>\n<p id=\"b250-4\">The starting point for the Court\u2019s analysis was \u201cthe Fourth Amendment rule ordinarily prohibiting the warrant-less entry of a person\u2019s house as unreasonable <em>per </em>se[.]\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 109 (citing <em>Payton v. New York, </em>445 US 573, 586, 100 S Ct 1371, 63 L Ed 2d 639 (1980), and <em>Coolidge v. New Hampshire, </em>403 US 443, 454-55, 91 S Ct 2022, 29 L Ed 2d 564 (1971)). That ordinary rule, the Court explained, has a \u201c \u2018jealously and carefully drawn\u2019 exception\u201d that recognizes \u201cthe validity of searches with the voluntary consent of an individual possessing authority.\u201d 547 US at 109 (quoting <em>Jones v. United States, </em>357 US 493, 499, 78 S Ct 1253, 2 L Ed 2d 1514 (1958)). Under prior case law \u2014 namely, <em>Illinois v. Rodriguez, </em>497 US 177, 110 S Ct 2793, 111 L Ed 2d 148 (1990), and <em>United States v. Matlock, 415 US 164, 94 S </em>Ct 988, 39 L Ed 2d 242 (1974)\u2014 consent by a fellow occupant who shared common authority over the premises (or even someone whom the police reasonably believed to share that authority) was sufficient to justify a search of the premises. However, \u201cnone of [the Court\u2019s] co-occupant consent-to-search cases * * * presented the further fact of a second occupant physically present and refusing permission to search, and later moving to suppress evidence so obtained.\u201d 547 US at 109. \u201cThe significance of such a refusal,\u201d the Court explained, \u201cturns on the underpinnings of the co-occupant consent rule, as recognized since Matlock.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b250-5\">And so the Court turned to its prior search cases, exploring the basis for its holding in <em>Matlock </em>that \u201c \u2018the consent of one who possesses <em>common authority </em>over premises or effects is valid as against the absent, nonconsenting person <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"221\">*221</page-number>with whom that authority is shared.\u2019 \u201d 547 US at 110 (quoting <em>Matlock, </em>415 US at 170; emphasis added). The \u201ccommon authority\u201d described in <em>Matlock, </em>the Court explained, can be \u201cbroader than the rights accorded by property law\u201d: \u201cThe constant element in assessing Fourth Amendment reasonableness in the consent cases, then, is the great significance given to widely shared social expectations, which are naturally enough influenced by the law of property, but not controlled by its rules.\u201d <em>Randolph, </em>547 US at 110-11. That is, \u201cthe reasonableness of [a consent search] is in significant part a function of commonly held understanding about the authority that co-inhabitants may exercise in ways that affect each other\u2019s interests.\u201d Id. at 111.</p>\n<p id=\"b251-4\">Shared tenancy, the Court went on to explain, generally carries with it certain commonly held understandings \u2014 including the understanding that co-occupants \u201cassum[e] the risk\u201d that \u201cany one of them may admit visitors, with the consequence that a guest obnoxious to one may nevertheless be admitted in [that occupant\u2019s] absence by another.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Police, under the rule <em>o\u00ed Matlock, </em>are entitled to rely on that understanding and have \u201cno burden * * * to eliminate the possibility of atypical arrangements, in the absence of reason to doubt that the regular scheme was in place.\u201d 547 US at 112.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b251-5\">The Court then analyzed the relevant question in <em>Randolph </em>\u2014 i.e., the \u201creasonableness of police entry in reliance on consent by one occupant subject to immediate challenge by another\u201d \u2014 in terms of whether there exists a \u201ccommon understanding\u201d regarding the rights of disagreeing co-occupants. The Court explained that, in the absence of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"222\">*222</page-number>some recognized hierarchy (like military personnel of varying ranks housed in barracks), \u201cthere is no societal understanding of superior and inferior, a fact reflected in a standard formulation of domestic property law * * <em>Id. </em>at 114. \u201cIn sum,\u201d the Court concluded, \u201cthere is no common understanding that one co-tenant generally has a right or authority to prevail over the express wishes of another, whether the issue is the color of the curtains or invitations to outsiders.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b252-5\">That lack of \u201ccommon understanding\u201d was dispositive in Randolph:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b252-6\">\u201cSince the co-tenant wishing to open the door to a third party has no recognized authority in law or social practice to prevail over a present and objecting co-tenant, his disputed invitation, without more, gives a police officer no better claim to reasonableness in entering than the officer would have in the absence of any consent at all.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b252-7\"><em>Id. </em>Accordingly, in the balancing of competing interests that is required under the Fourth Amendment, \u201cthe cooperative occupant\u2019s invitation adds nothing to the government\u2019s side to counter the force of an objecting individual\u2019s claim to security against the government\u2019s intrusion into his dwelling place.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 115-16. And that was so, the Court explained, despite \u201ccountervailing claims\u201d such as the consenting tenant\u2019s \u201cinterest as a citizen in bringing criminal activity to light\u201d or \u201clegitimate self-interest in siding with the police to deflect suspicion raised by sharing quarters with a criminal [<em>.] Id. </em>at 116. \u201c[S]ociety can often have the benefit of these interests,\u201d the Court reasoned, \u201cwithout relying on a theory of consent that ignores an inhabitant\u2019s refusal to allow a warrantless search.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 116. For example, the \u201cco-tenant acting on his own initiative may be able to deliver evidence to the police,\u201d or \u201ccan tell the police what he knows, for use before a magistrate in getting a warrant.\u201d <em>Id. </em>The Court also rejected, in an extended discussion, the principal dissent\u2019s position that the Court\u2019s holding would endanger victims of domestic violence; in the majority\u2019s view, \u201c[t]he undoubted right of the police to enter in order to protect a victim * * * has nothing to do with * * * whether a search with the consent of one co-tenant is good against another, standing at the door and expressly refusing consent.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 118-19. The Court then summarized its holding in this way:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b253-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"223\">*223</page-number>\u201cThe dissent\u2019s red herring aside, we know, of course, that alternatives to disputed consent will not always open the door to search for evidence that the police suspect is inside. The consenting tenant may simply not disclose enough information, or information factual enough, to add up to a showing of probable cause, and there may be no exigency to justify fast action. But nothing in social custom or its reflection in private law argues for placing a higher value on delving into private premises to search for evidence in the face of disputed consent, than on requiring clear justification before the government searches private living quarters over a resident\u2019s objection. We <em>therefore hold that a warrantless search of a shared dwelling for evidence over the express refusal of consent hy a physically present resident cannot be justified as reasonable as to him on the basis of consent given to the police by another </em>resident.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b253-4\"><em>Id. </em>at 120 (footnote omitted; emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b253-5\">After expressing its holding, the Court proceeded to tie up \u201ctwo loose ends.\u201d <em>Id. </em>The first was a question that arose in light of the statement in <em>Matlock </em>that co-inhabitants individually have the right to permit inspection: \u201cIf <em>Matlock\u2019s </em>co-tenant is giving permission \u2018in his own right,\u2019 how can his \u2018own right\u2019 be eliminated by another tenant\u2019s objection?\u201d<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> <em>Randolph, </em>547 US at 120. The answer to that question, the Court explained, is that the \u201cright\u201d to which <em>Matlock </em>referred is not an \u201cenduring and enforceable ownership right\u201d under private property law, but \u201cis instead the authority recognized by customary social usage as having a substantial bearing on Fourth Amendment reasonableness in specific circumstances.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 120-21. Therefore,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b253-6\">\u201cto ask whether the consenting tenant has the right to admit the police when a physically present fellow tenant <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"224\">*224</page-number>objects is not to question whether some property right may be divested by the mere objection of another. <em>It is, rather, the question whether customary' social understanding accords the consenting tenant authority powerful enough to prevail over the co-tenant\u2019s objection. </em>The <em>Matlock </em>Court did not purport to answer this question * * *: the Court described the co-tenant\u2019s consent as good against the \u2018absent, nonconsenting\u2019 resident. [415 US] at 170.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b254-4\"><em>Randolph, </em>547 US at 121 (emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b254-5\">The \u201csecond loose end,\u201d the Court explained, was the continuing significance of <em>Matlock </em>and <em>Rodriguez. </em>In both of those cases, the defendants were nearby but not asked for consent before police entered based on the consent of a co-occupant. Distinguishing those cases from the one before it, the Court acknowledged, was an intricate task:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b254-6\">\u201cIf those cases are not to be undercut by today\u2019s holding, we have to admit that we are drawing a fine line; if a potential defendant with self-interest in objecting is in fact at the door and objects, the co-tenant\u2019s permission does not suffice for a reasonable search, whereas the potential objector, nearby but not invited to take part in the threshold colloquy, loses out.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b254-7\">\n<em>\u201cThis is the line we draw, and we think the formalism is justified. So long as there is no evidence that the police have removed the potentially objecting tenant from the entrance for the sake of avoiding a possible objection, there is practical value in the simple clarity of complementary rules, one recognizing the co-tenant\u2019s permission when there is no fellow occupant on hand, the other according dispositive weight to the fellow occupant\u2019s contrary indication when he expresses it.\u201d</em>\n</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b254-8\"><em>Randolph, </em>547 US at 121 (emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b254-9\">Finally, the Court concluded by summarizing the application of that formalistic rule to the facts of the case:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b254-10\">\u201cThis case invites a straightforward application of <em>the rule that a physically present inhabitant\u2019s express refusal of consent to a police search is dispositive as to him, regardless of the consent of a fellow occupant. </em>Scott Randolph\u2019s refusal is clear, and nothing in the record justifies the search on grounds independent of Janet Randolph\u2019s consent. The State does not argue that she gave any indication to the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"225\">*225</page-number>police of a need for protection inside the house that might have justified entry into the portion of the premises where the police found the powdery straw (which, if lawfully seized, could have been used when attempting to establish probable cause for the warrant issued later). Nor does the State claim that the entry and search should be upheld under the rubric of exigent circumstances, owing to some apprehension by the police officers that Scott Randolph would destroy evidence of drug use before any warrant could be obtained.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b255-3\">\u201cThe judgment of the Supreme Court of Georgia [suppressing the evidence] is therefore affirmed.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b255-4\"><em>Id. </em>at 122-23 (emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b255-5\">With that backdrop of <em>Randolph, </em>we return to the matter before us: the denial of defendant\u2019s motion to suppress.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> We start with the trial court\u2019s reasoning \u2014 that this case is entirely distinguishable from <em>Randolph </em>because the officers here only \u201cseized\u201d evidence, whereas <em>Randolph </em>involved a \u201csearch.\u201d The state, as previously noted, goes to no great lengths to defend that theory on appeal \u2014 and for good reason. The Supreme Court has, in no uncertain terms, explained that Fourth Amendment protections apply equally to warrantless searches and seizures that involve government intrusions inside the home:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b255-6\">\u201c[T]he critical point is that any differences in the intrusiveness of entries to search and entries to arrest are merely ones of degree rather than kind. The two intrusions share this fundamental characteristic: the breach of the entrance to an individual\u2019s home. The Fourth Amendment protects the individual\u2019s privacy in a variety of settings. In none is the zone of privacy more clearly defined than when bounded by the unambiguous physical dimensions of an individual\u2019s home \u2014 a zone that finds its roots in clear and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"226\">*226</page-number>specific constitutional terms: \u2018The right of the people to be secure in their * * '* houses * * * shall not be violated.\u2019 That language unequivocally establishes the proposition that \u2018[a]t the very core [of the Fourth Amendment] stands the right of a man to retreat into his own home and there be free from unreasonable governmental intrusion.\u2019 <em>Silverman v. United States, </em>365 US 505, 511, 81 S Ct 679, 683, 5 L Ed 2d 734 (1961). <em>In terms that apply equally to seizures of property and to seizures of persons, the Fourth Amendment has drawn a firm line at the entrance to the house. Absent exigent circumstances, that threshold may not reasonably be crossed without a warrant.\u201d</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b256-4\"><em>Payton, </em>445 US at 589-90 (alterations in Payton; emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b256-5\"> Moreover, nothing in <em>Randolph </em>itself suggests that a warrantless entry for purposes of a \u201cseizure\u201d should be treated altogether differently than a warrantless search. Indeed, <em>Randolph </em>relies on <em>Payton </em>\u2014 a seizure case \u2014 as the starting point for its analysis: \u201cthe Fourth Amendment rule ordinarily prohibiting the warrantless entry of a person\u2019s house as unreasonable <em>per </em>se[.]\u201d 547 US at 109 (quoting <em>Payton, </em>445 US at 586). So even assuming that the police actions in this case were not a \u201csearch\u201d of defendant\u2019s home for purposes of the Fourth Amendment (itself a dubious proposition<footnotemark>5</footnotemark>), the rule of <em>Randolph </em>nevertheless governs the reasonableness of the <em>entry </em>into defendant\u2019s home based on a co-occupant\u2019s consent, whether that entry is for purposes of search or seizure. <em>See Randolph, </em>547 US at 109 (explaining that the \u201cexception for consent extends even to entries and searches with the permission of a co-occupant whom the police reasonably, but erroneously, believe to possess shared <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"227\">*227</page-number>authority as an occupant\u201d); <em>see also Rodriguez, </em>497 US at 181 (\u201cThe Fourth Amendment generally prohibits the warrant-less entry of a person\u2019s home, whether to make an arrest or to search for specific objects.\u201d); <em>Coolidge, </em>403 US at 468 (even if the police are certain that a home contains contraband, the Court \u201chas repeatedly stated and enforced the basic rule that the police may not enter and make a warrantless seizure\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b257-4\">Thus, the dispositive issue, for purposes of the Fourth Amendment, is not whether this case involved a \u201cseizure\u201d rather than \u201csearch,\u201d but instead whether the warrant-less, physical intrusion into defendant\u2019s home was reasonable based on the consent of defendant\u2019s co-occupant\u2014 consent that was given after defendant had been arrested and, so the state argues, when defendant was no longer \u201cpresent and objecting.\u201d The answer to that question depends on how one reads the holding in <em>Randolph.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b257-5\">Since <em>Randolph, </em>three federal circuits have split on the issue before us. In <em>United States v. Murphy, </em>516 F3d 1117 (9th Cir 2008), police encountered the defendant at the entrance to a storage facility unit in which he was living. They knew the defendant to be a methamphetamine user, were able to observe an operating methamphetamine lab in the unit, and arrested the defendant. They sought the defendant\u2019s consent to search the unit, but he refused. The police then sought and obtained the consent of Roper, a third party who rented the storage facility and had permitted the defendant to live there. Based on Roper\u2019s consent, the police searched the unit and seized the lab. The defendant moved to suppress the evidence that derived from the search, and the trial court denied the motion. After <em>Randolph </em>was decided, the defendant unsuccessfully petitioned the trial court to reconsider its earlier ruling. 516 F3d at 1119-20.</p>\n<p id=\"b257-6\">On appeal, the government attempted to distinguish <em>Randolph </em>on the ground that, because the defendant had been arrested, \u201cthe objecting co-tenant was not physically present when the other tenant gave consent to the search.\u201d 516 F3d at 1124. The Ninth Circuit rejected that argument, seeing no reason \u201cwhy [the defendant\u2019s] arrest should vitiate the objection he had already registered to the search.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Thus, the court \u201ch[e]ld that when a co-tenant objects to a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"228\">*228</page-number>search and another party with common authority subsequently gives consent to that search in the absence of the first co-tenant the search is invalid as to the objecting co-tenant.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b258-4\">The court found support for that holding in \u201cthe <em>Randolph </em>Court\u2019s treatment of the related issue of police removal of a tenant from the scene for the purpose of <em>preventing </em>him from objecting to a search.\u201d 516 F3d at 1124 (emphasis in original). \u201cIf the police cannot prevent a co-tenant from objecting to a search through arrest, surely they cannot arrest a co-tenant and then seek to ignore an objection he has already made.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1124-25. The court further held:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b258-5\">\u201cNor, more generally, do we see any reason to limit the <em>Randolph </em>rule to an objecting tenant\u2019s removal by police. Once a co-tenant has registered his objection, his refusal to grant consent remains effective barring some objective manifestation that he has changed his position and no longer objects. The rule that <em>Randolph </em>establishes is that when one co-tenant objects and the other consents, a valid search may occur only with respect to the consenting tenant. It is true that the consent of either co-tenant may be sufficient in the absence of an objection by the other, either because he simply fails to object or because he is not present to do so. <em>Nevertheless, when an objection has been made by either tenant prior to the officers\u2019 entry, the search is not valid as to him and no evidence seized may be used against him.\u201d</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b258-7\"><em>Id. </em>at 1125 (emphasis added). Thus, the court reversed the denial of the defendant\u2019s motion to suppress.</p>\n<p id=\"b258-8\">The Seventh and Eighth Circuits, however, have understood <em>Randolph </em>differently. In <em>United States v. Henderson, </em>536 F3d 776, 779 (7th Cir 2008), <em>cert den, </em>130 S Ct 59 (2009), the \u201csole issue on appeal [was] whether <em>Randolph </em>requires exclusion of evidence obtained in a warrantless search of a home after a present and objecting occupant is arrested and removed from the home and a co-occupant with authority consents to the search.\u201d The defendant, relying on the Ninth Circuit\u2019s reasoning in <em>Murphy, </em>argued that his subsequent arrest did not vitiate his earlier objection to a search. The case, the court acknowledged, was \u201cmaterially indistinguishable\u201d from <em>Murphy, </em>nevertheless, the court held that the search was valid. <em>Henderson, </em>536 F3d at 783.</p>\n<p id=\"b259-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"229\">*229</page-number>The Seventh Circuit\u2019s decision in <em>Henderson </em>took a narrow view of <em>Randolph, </em>confining it to the \u201cindispensible\u201d predicate of \u201cthe contemporaneous presence of the objecting and consenting cotenants.\u201d 536 F3d at 783. The continuing \u201cpresence\u201d of the objecting co-occupant, in the Seventh Circuit\u2019s view, \u201cplays a vital role in the <em>Randolph </em>majority\u2019s \u2018social expectations\u2019 premise; a third party, attuned to societal customs regarding shared premises, would not, \u2018[wjithout some very good reason,\u2019 enter when faced with a disputed invitation between cotenants.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(quoting <em>Randolph, </em>547 US at 113). However, \u201c[t]he calculus shifts,\u201d the court explained, \u201cwhen the tenant seeking to deny entry is no longer present.\u201d <em>Id. </em>At that point,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b259-4\">\u201c[h]is objection loses its force because he is not there to enforce it, or perhaps (if we understand the Court\u2019s rationale correctly) because the affront to his authority to assert or waive his privacy interest is no longer an issue. As between two present but disagreeing residents with authority, the tie goes to the objector; police may not search based on the consent of one in the face of \u2018a physically present inhabitant\u2019s express refusal of consent\u2019 to search. <em>[Randolph, </em>547 US at 122.] We do not read <em>Randolph </em>as vesting the objector with an absolute veto; nothing in the majority opinion suggests the Court was creating a rule of continuing objection.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b259-6\"><em>Henderson, </em>536 F3d at 783-84.</p>\n<p id=\"b259-7\">The court also relied on the \u201climiting effect of Justice Breyer\u2019s concurrence on the scope of the majority opinion.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Justice Breyer joined the majority opinion in <em>Randolph </em>but also wrote separately to explain his understanding that the majority opinion was \u201ccase-specific\u201d and \u201cdoes not apply where the objector is not present \u2018and object[ing].\u2019 \u201d <em>Randolph, </em>547 US at 126-27 (Breyer, J., concurring). In the Seventh Circuit\u2019s view, \u201c[t]hat [concurrence], and the specific limiting language in the majority opinion itself, convince us that <em>Randolph's </em>holding ought not be extended beyond the circumstances at issue there.\u201d <em>Henderson, </em>536 F3d at 784. For that reason, the Seventh Circuit rejected the reasoning in <em>Murphy </em>and instead followed the lead of the Eighth Circuit, which had earlier held that, after an objecting co-occupant has been arrested and removed from the scene, there is no <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"230\">*230</page-number>longer a valid objection by a \u201cpresent\u201d occupant for purposes of <em>Randolph. Id. </em>(citing <em>United States v. Hudspeth, </em>518 F3d 954 (8th Cir 2008)).</p>\n<p id=\"b260-4\">The facts in this case, for purposes of our analysis, do not differ in key respects from <em>Murphy, Henderson, </em>or <em>Hudspeth. </em>Here, as in those cases, police asked defendant for consent to search his home. He refused, and police then arrested him and removed him from the premises. They subsequently sought, and obtained, consent to enter the home from defendant\u2019s co-occupant, for the purpose of seizing evidence in the home. Thus, the question for us \u2014 an intermediate state court bound neither by the Ninth Circuit nor by other federal circuits \u2014 is which of the courts has the better understanding of <em>Randolph </em>and its underpinnings. That is, does the \u201ccalculus shift\u201d regarding reasonableness once the objecting tenant is arrested and removed from the scene, as the Seventh and Eighth Circuits reasoned? Or is it the case, as the Ninth Circuit held, \u201cthat when a co-tenant objects to a search and another party with common authority subsequently gives consent to that search in the absence of the first co-tenant the search is invalid as to the objecting co-tenant\u201d? <em>Murphy, </em>516 F3d at 1124.</p>\n<p id=\"b260-5\">In discerning the merits of the competing views, we find it most helpful to return to the underlying principle that drove the Court\u2019s opinion in <em>Randolph: </em>Sanctity of the home is the rule, and co-occupant consent the exception. Indeed, <em>Randolph\u2019s </em>analysis begins with the core tenet of Fourth Amendment law that, ordinarily, \u201cwarrantless entry of a person\u2019s house [is] unreasonable <em>per se.\u201d Randolph, </em>547 US at 109. <em>Matlock </em>and <em>Rodriguez </em>notwithstanding, co-occupant consent is not itself the default, but is instead a \u201c \u2018jealously and carefully drawn\u2019 <em>exception\u201d </em>to the ordinary rule against warrantless entry. 547 US at 109 (quoting <em>Jones, </em>357 US at 499) (emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b260-6\">Bearing in mind that construct, <em>Randolph </em>is best viewed not as an \u201cexception\u201d to co-occupant consent cases like <em>Matlock </em>and <em>Rodriguez, </em>but rather as an illustration of the ordinary rule that warrantless searches are unauthorized. That is, <em>Randolph </em>is properly understood as a case in which the Court was unable to find, as it had in <em>Matlock </em>and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"231\">*231</page-number><em>Rodriguez, </em>an exception to the warrant requirement. In determining whether the circumstances merited a departure from the ordinary rule, the Court explained that the \u201cconstant element\u201d in assessing whether a warrantless entry is reasonable based on the co-occupant\u2019s consent is \u201cthe great significance given to widely shared social expectations.\u201d 547 US at 111. The Court ultimately concluded that police cannot reasonably rely on a co-occupant\u2019s consent in the face of an express, \u201cat-the-door\u201d objection, because there is ordinarily \u201cno societal understanding of superior and inferior\u201d as between the rights of co-occupants. 547 US at 114. Such is the case, according to the Court, \u201cwhether the issue is the color of the curtains or invitations to outsiders.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b261-4\">Thus, the question before us is whether some <em>different </em>societal understanding obtains once the objecting tenant has been arrested. That is, does it somehow become \u201creasonable\u201d under the Fourth Amendment for police to ignore a tenant\u2019s earlier objection once that tenant is arrested? We are not persuaded that it does.</p>\n<p id=\"b261-5\">To begin with, the state has not identified any readily analogous fact pattern that convinces us that, once a present and objecting co-occupant is no longer at the door of the dwelling, social expectations immediately shift such that the unwelcome visitor would then be expected to enter notwithstanding the earlier \u201cat-the-door\u201d objection. Indeed, as the dissenting opinion pointed out in <em>Henderson, </em>that approach entails something of a Hobbesian view of the world: that social expectations extend only so far as one is able to physically and presently enforce them. 536 F3d at 787 (Rovner, J., dissenting). We do not find that view to be a particularly convincing ground on which to depart from the premise in <em>Randolph </em>that, \u201cwhen people living together disagree over the use of their common quarters, a resolution must come through voluntary accommodation.\u201d 547 US at 113-14.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"232\">*232</page-number>Moreover, considering that consent is a \u201c jealously and carefully drawn\u2019 exception\u201d to the prohibition on warrantless entry, we are disinclined to resolve doubt regarding social expectations in favor of the state.</p>\n<p id=\"b262-4\">Echoing <em>Henderson, </em>the state emphasizes the general social understanding \u2014 exemplified in <em>Matlock </em>and <em>Rodriguez </em>and recognized in <em>Randolph </em>\u2014 \u201cthat any [co-occupant] may admit visitors, with the consequence that a guest obnoxious to one may nevertheless be admitted <em>in his absence </em>by another.\u201d <em>Randolph, </em>547 US at 111 (emphasis added). However, the social understanding described in those cases concerned not only an \u201cabsent\u201d co-occupant, but also the absence of <em>any objection. </em>In fact, <em>Randolph </em>expressly rejected the view that <em>Matlock </em>purported to say anything about the circumstance in which an occupant has explicitly objected to entry. <em>Id. </em>at 121.</p>\n<p id=\"b262-5\">There is a fundamental difference between the <em>Matlock/Rodriguez </em>situation and the circumstances presented here. In the <em>absence of any objection, </em>as in <em>Matlock </em>and <em>Rodriguez, </em>police are justified in relying on the assumption that any joint tenant typically has the right to permit inspection. <em>Randolph, </em>547 US at 111. The same is not true, however, once the police meet with an objection by an occupant who is physically present. At that point, the objection takes on primary importance <em>under Randolph, </em>and the question becomes whether \u201ccustomary social understanding accords the consenting tenant authority powerful enough <em>to prevail over the co-tenant\u2019s objection.\u201d Id. </em>at 121. For the reasons stated earlier, the state has not persuaded us that any \u201ccustomary social understanding\u201d is powerful enough under these circumstances to disturb the ordinary rule that police must obtain a warrant before entering a person\u2019s dwelling for the purpose of obtaining evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b262-6\">We acknowledge that, as the state correctly points out, the majority in <em>Randolph </em>(as well as Justice Breyer\u2019s concurrence) appears to go out of its way to emphasize the narrowness of the Court\u2019s holding and the continuing viability of <em>Matlock </em>and <em>Rodriguez. </em>At the same time, nothing in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"233\">*233</page-number>the Court\u2019s opinion (or even in the concurring or dissenting opinions) even hints that a different result would have obtained had Mr. Randolph been arrested immediately after his objection; indeed, the majority opinion identified a number of ways in which \u201csociety can * * * have the benefit of [the consenting co-occupant\u2019s and the state\u2019s] interests without relying on a theory of consent that ignores an inhabitant\u2019s refusal to allow a warrantless search\u201d \u2014 including the co-occupant delivering evidence to police, or the police obtaining a warrant based on information provided by the co-occupant. <em>Id. </em>at 116-17. The Court also explained that, in the course of requesting consent, the officers might discover an exigency that would permit their entry. <em>Id. </em>at 116 n 6. But at no point did the Court suggest that, in addition to those means of protecting the co-occupant\u2019s rights, police had the option of simply arresting the defendant and then seeking the co-occupant\u2019s consent \u2014 something of a glaring omission, given the potential significance of that exception and the depth of treatment given to other hypothetical fact patterns.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b263-4\">In sum, we are unable to find any \u201crecognized authority\u201d that one co-occupant might have to admit police over the then-present objection of the other occupant, whether or not the objecting occupant is subsequently arrested at the scene. And in the absence of such \u201crecognized authority,\u201d \u201ca police officer [has] no better claim to reasonableness in entering than the officer would have in the absence of any consent at all.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 114. Accordingly, we hold that the police entry into defendant\u2019s home was unconstitutional, and that the trial court erred in denying defendant\u2019s motion to suppress.</p>\n<p id=\"b263-5\">Reversed and remanded.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b248-8\"> The remaining counts were dismissed.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b251-6\"> At the same time, there are circumstances in which \u201cneither state-law property rights, nor common contractual arrangements, nor any other source points to a common understanding of authority to admit third parties generally without the consent of a person occupying the premises,\u201d such as when a landlord or manager offers to admit guests without the consent of the current occupant, <em>Randolph, </em>547 US at 112; moreover, some occupants might lack any perceived authority to consent to certain searches \u2014 for example, no one calling on the home of an eight-year-old child would reasonably expect that child to be in a position to authorize the guest to rummage through the parents\u2019 bedroom, <em>id. </em>In either of the latter situations (where there is no common understanding as to authority, or a common understanding that such authority does not exist), the police cannot reasonably rely on third-party consent as the justification to enter and search the premises. <em>Id.</em></p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b253-7\"> Chief Justice Roberts, in his dissent, emphasized that aspect of <em>Matlock\u2019s </em>reasoning:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b253-8\">\u201cThe common thread in our decisions upholding searches conducted pursuant to third-party consent is an understanding that a person \u2018assume[s] the risk\u2019 that those who have access to and control over his shared property might consent to a search. * * * And we concluded that shared use of property makes it \u2018reasonable to recognize that any of the co-inhabitants has the right to permit the inspection in his own right.\u2019 \u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b253-9\"><em>Randolph, </em>547 US at 134 (Roberts, C.
