We review <em>de novo, </em>ORS 19.415(3) (2007),<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> and conclude, consistently with the trial court\u2019s judgment, that the increased conflict between the parents and the effect of that conflict on child constitutes a substantial change in circumstances. After due consideration of the trial court\u2019s ability to assess the parties\u2019 credibility and demeanor, <em>Cooksey and Cooksey, </em>203 Or App 157, 172, 125 P3d 57 (2005), we nevertheless disagree with its ruling on best interests and conclude that changing custody to father is in child\u2019s best interests. Accordingly, we reverse and remand for entry of a judgment granting custody to father.</p>\n<p id=\"b630-5\">The litigation between the parties is highly contentious and has extended over several years, including a prior custody order in 2005. Before we begin a chronological review of the record, we highlight four themes that emerge from that review. First, mother has repeatedly accused father of serious crimes, but all of those accusations have proved unfounded. Second, mother has repeatedly excluded father from participating in various medical and psychological interventions to treat and evaluate child, calling into question the validity of some of those interventions. Third, after father was granted increased parenting time, child\u2019s behavioral problems escalated in ways that appear to have been driven by mother\u2019s influence. Fourth, the experts who evaluated the case have not arrived at a definitive diagnosis, but they all characterize child as displaying symptoms of anxiety, some developmental delay, and aggressive behavior, and all, to at least some degree, attribute child\u2019s problems to the conflict between the parties.</p>\n<p id=\"b630-6\">We proceed to a recitation of the pertinent facts. Mother and father began their relationship in 1999 and never married. Child was born in December 2001. Mother and father separated completely in 2002 when father moved to the Seattle area, where he continued to reside at the time <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"581\">*581</page-number>of the custody hearing at issue. Their final failed attempt to reconcile occurred toward the end of 2003.</p>\n<p id=\"b631-3\">Father has a GED and is a plumber. During the relevant time period, he has had sole custody of his teenage daughter, B. B and mother have a strained relationship; at one point, mother alleged that B posed a physical threat to child, but one year later, mother acted inconsistently with that allegation by inviting B to visit child in mother\u2019s home.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Father currently resides with his fiancee, Nicole, and her daughter E, who is two years older than child. Both B and E are doing well in father\u2019s home and have bonded with child.</p>\n<p id=\"b631-4\">Mother has earned a J.D. and formerly practiced law. She is single and has a son, DT, who is five years younger than child. Mother\u2019s relationship with DT\u2019s father was conditioned on his lack of involvement in DT\u2019s life. DT is doing well in mother\u2019s home and is bonded with child. Mother generally lives with at least one roommate.</p>\n<p id=\"b631-5\">The parties have been in litigation since mother\u2019s pregnancy with child. Before litigating custody, they filed several restraining orders against each other, which were vacated soon after filing. Soon after child was born, mother drafted a stipulated custody judgment, which the parties agreed to set aside shortly thereafter. When child was seven months old, they entered into a second stipulated judgment, also prepared by mother, granting mother sole custody and father extremely limited parenting time.</p>\n<p id=\"b631-6\">About a year later, father moved to change custody, and the parties stipulated to an order appointing Bell, with whom they had already worked once before, to conduct a custody evaluation. At Bell\u2019s request, mother and father underwent psychological evaluations. The evaluator, Gwin, reported that mother\u2019s test results showed signs of moderate to severe depression and a tendency to feel overburdened, blocked, or trapped. Gwin was concerned that mother would be prone to attempt to alienate child from father, noting that mother is \u201cdisposed to dichotomize someone * * * [and] could be quickly sensitive to her child\u2019s comments that favored the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"582\">*582</page-number>other parent over her.\u201d Gwin reported that father\u2019s test results indicated a tendency toward sudden and intense emotional outbursts. She observed that father lacked insight and self-awareness and could be self-assertive, controlling, and difficult to coparent with; however, his \u201cdepth of parent-to-child bonding appears adequate to reasonably good.\u201d She observed that he did not dichotomize people and \u201cis not likely to be especially sensitive as to whether his child\u2019s comments are for or against him or the other parent.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b632-4\">Each parent expressed concern about the other during the evaluation process, but mother went further and, during that process, accused father of at least three serious crimes, none of which could be substantiated. First, she reported to Bell and to the police that father had stolen cash (her reports varied from $30,000 to $60,000) that she held for a \u201cmafia\u201d client. However, the record does not indicate that father was ever investigated for theft, although mother\u2019s change to inactive status with the Oregon State Bar is related to the missing cash, by her report. Second, mother accused father of setting fire to his trailer home, but father submitted to a polygraph test and eventually was cleared by police investigators of having set the fire. Third, mother reported to Bell that father had sexually abused child. A CARES NW examination found no evidence of abuse; the Department of Human Services recommended supervised parenting time for father for his own protection and then closed the case as unfounded. Father also submitted to another polygraph test, which supported his denial of any sexual abuse.</p>\n<p id=\"b632-5\">Mother continually pushed Bell to recommend supervised visits for father, but Bell did not see a need for supervision. Although mother never once asserted during several contacts with Bell and Gwin that father had physically or sexually abused her, she obtained a second psychological evaluation by Mallory during that same time period; in the Mallory evaluation, she reported physical and sexual abuse by father. In light of mother\u2019s report, Mallory interpreted mother\u2019s test results as if domestic violence had occurred and determined that mother had a \u201cwell-balanced personality style\u201d and \u201cwould make a positive and effective primary custodial parent.\u201d Mother\u2019s reports of abuse are <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"583\">*583</page-number>otherwise unsubstantiated in the record. Mother finally acceded to father\u2019s requests to increase his parenting time to two entire weekends per month and six weeks during the summer without mother\u2019s supervision, but mother insisted that the exchanges occur at Safety Matters, a supervised exchange site for cases that typically involve domestic violence.</p>\n<p id=\"b633-4\">Bell\u2019s custody evaluation, completed in August 2004, when child was not quite three years old, reflected concern about both parents and the friction between them. Bell recommended that they share custody in the short term. She concluded that father was the more likely to facilitate and encourage a relationship with mother and was more capable of recognizing his weaknesses and past poor choices. Although mother was the primary parent, Bell had concerns that mother would undermine father\u2019s relationship with child. Bell also expressed concern \u201cregarding the type of bond that [child] has with his mother given her personality style and the ongoing allegations against * * * father.\u201d Bell was very concerned about the timing of mother\u2019s abuse allegations, her blaming father for the fire in his home, and her unilateral decisions to reduce or terminate visitation. Bell found no credible indicators of domestic violence. She noted that, \u201cwhen the case somewhat slows down there are new allegations, assertions and I caution counsel regarding where this case is going.\u201d She concluded with the hope that \u201cwithin the next two years one or both of the parties can get themselves in a healthier position\u201d and admonished that, \u201cif [child] is in therapy[,] both parents need access to the clinician so a one sided statement paper does not come out regarding the other parent.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b633-5\">The 2005 custody determination, reached when child was three years old, followed a two-day trial. The court increased father\u2019s parenting time to two weeks per month but did not find a substantial change of circumstances and therefore did not modify the award of sole custody to mother. The court noted that it had \u201csome concerns about [m]other\u2019s fitness as a parent, but these concerns are not significant enough to merit a modification of legal custody.\u201d The court was satisfied that mother could care for child on a day-to-day basis.</p>\n<p id=\"b634-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"584\">*584</page-number>Conflicts persisted between the parents, culminating in this second attempt by father to obtain a custody modification, which he initiated in December 2005 and which was tried in the summer of2007. Keeping in mind that the parties assess child\u2019s behavior and emotional problems quite differently, we consider the psychological evaluations that child has undergone since the last custody review. Despite Bell\u2019s admonitions regarding the importance of involving both parents in the professional services offered to child, mother has maintained sole control over nearly all such services.</p>\n<p id=\"b634-4\">Child has received at least three evaluations and regular counseling at Morrison Child and Family Services, all without father\u2019s participation. During the first evaluation, mother falsely reported to Dr. Stanford that father was aware of the evaluation, but was \u201cnot interested in becoming involved in [child\u2019s] psychiatric care.\u201d Mother reported to evaluators that father had been violent toward her and had \u201cmentally abused\u201d child. Stanford gave child an Axis I diagnosis of \u201cParent/Child Relational Problem\u201d and noted severe psychosocial stressors related to the custody battle. He recommended parenting training, efforts to involve father in therapy, and \u201c[a]ctive separation of [child\u2019s] presentation from biases that may be presented in the context of secondary gain related to [the] custody battle.\u201d Mother did not agree with Stanford\u2019s diagnosis and later attempted to have the report removed from child\u2019s file. Stanford\u2019s evaluation occurred before the 2005 custody determination, but mother was the only party aware of it and did not present it to the court at that time. Additionally, her attorney contacted Morrison and instructed that father could not be involved as part of child\u2019s therapy and could only review the treatment records.</p>\n<p id=\"b634-5\">Child continued therapy at Morrison and received a second evaluation without father\u2019s involvement. The evaluating psychologists agreed with an earlier diagnosis of Pervasive Developmental Disorder, not otherwise specified (PDD-NOS), reached by the Child Development and Rehabilitation Center (CDRC, discussed below), and noted that child had engaged in clear acts of aggression toward mother and that attachment issues should not be ruled out. The evaluators opined that frequent changes in child\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"585\">*585</page-number>routine resulting from transition between households had a negative effect; they recommended fewer transitions, as well as counseling to address his relational and communication difficulties. In response to mother\u2019s report that child had witnessed domestic violence, the evaluators recommended further assessment.</p>\n<p id=\"b635-4\">During child\u2019s final Morrison evaluation \u2014 in which, again, father was not involved \u2014 mother continued to report that she had concerns about behavioral changes around visits with father and that child had witnessed domestic violence. The evaluator diagnosed PDD-NOS, \u201caccompanied by difficulties in emotional regulation, social interactions and communication,\u201d with possible post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD). The evaluator recommended counseling for behavior issues and anxiety, noting that it is in child\u2019s best interest to minimize transitions between the parents\u2019 households.</p>\n<p id=\"b635-5\">During an overlapping time period, CDRC twice evaluated child through the Autism Clinic. Mother sought the first evaluation after the trial for the 2005 custody determination, and father was only minimally involved. As during the Morrison evaluations, mother reported a history of domestic violence, but this time she expressed the belief that child had not witnessed any violence. CDRC provisionally diagnosed PDD-NOS, with possible PTSD related to the visitation schedule and domestic violence. The evaluator recommended that both parents actively work with mental health professionals on parenting and supervision. The evaluator noted that children of child\u2019s age (then four years old) who are \u201cexposed to domestic violence, maternal depression, and a chaotic lifestyle often display behavior typical of children with autism.\u201d Determining the cause of child\u2019s behaviors was critical to providing appropriate treatment. The evaluator recommended that child continue mental health services and return for reevaluation in approximately two years because the \u201cteam had concerns that [child\u2019s] behaviors were secondary to emotional distress rather than a developmental disorder.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b635-6\">Almost two years later, when child was five and one-half, at the request of a second custody evaluator, Dudley, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"586\">*586</page-number>and child\u2019s appointed attorney in the context of this second custody proceeding, CDRC again evaluated child. That evaluation was the only psychological evaluation of child in which father had full access throughout the process and participated equally with mother. Although mother believed child\u2019s problems were more serious than father did, both parents were concerned about child\u2019s anger and aggression.</p>\n<p id=\"b636-3\">The CDRC team concluded that child no longer met the criteria for PDD-NOS and did not report concern regarding possible PTSD or domestic violence, but had concern \u201cabout the long-term psychological impact of [child\u2019s] parents\u2019 custody battle and related parent conflict.\u201d They recommended an occupational therapy evaluation and that \u201cparents continue to work together and communicate to best meet all of [child\u2019s] needs.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b636-4\">The efforts of third parties to assist parents in resolving their conflicts were not successful. For example, after the 2005 custody determination, the court ordered parents to use a parent facilitator, Dr. Sabin, to resolve any disagreements regarding child\u2019s health, welfare, and education. Sabin noted that the parties disagreed regarding child\u2019s diagnosis and that mother appeared invested in child \u201chaving extreme special needs\u201d and father was \u201cinvested in [child] as having no special needs.\u201d She felt that reality was probably \u201csomewhere in between\u201d those two extremes. Sabin recommended that child have a therapist with whom both parents could meet. Mother did not want child to see a therapist without her, however, and would not give Sabin child\u2019s insurance information for a therapist referral when child\u2019s therapy at Morrison ended. About six months after being appointed, Sabin terminated services because of mother\u2019s \u201cunwillingness to pay for my services and other issues.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b636-5\">Sabin had recommended that mother enter dialectic behavioral therapy (DBT) because of \u201cdifficulties with emotional modulation\u201d and because she has \u201chistorically sought therapists specializing in domestic violence who are very supportive of her and do not challenge her to think about her own role in the parental conflict.\u201d She also thought that father would benefit from counseling; apparently as a result, father and Nicole completed anger management classes in 2006. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"587\">*587</page-number>Meanwhile, mother began DBT in October 2005 with Peters, who diagnosed her with an Anxiety Disorder, Not Otherwise Specified, noting that mother \u201ctends to go on the offensive\u201d with her fears.</p>\n<p id=\"b637-4\">After father initiated this custody proceeding in late 2005 and mother moved for more parenting time, the court appointed attorney Smith to represent child and ordered a custody evaluation by Dudley, a psychologist who has completed hundreds such evaluations. Over 12 months, Dudley completed a thorough evaluation that included observations of parents and child, including a visit to father\u2019s residence and three to mother\u2019s; review of reports and evaluations; interviews and psychological testing of mother, father, and Nicole; and review of three hours of recorded phone calls provided by mother and a DVD of child that was provided by father. Both Dudley and Smith ultimately concluded that custody should be changed from mother to father.</p>\n<p id=\"b637-5\">Dudley\u2019s custody recommendation was not a \u201cclose call.\u201d Dudley emphasized that, after the 2005 custody determination, child\u2019s behavioral problems escalated in ways that suggested mother\u2019s influence and that the parental conflict was destructive to child. Although mother believed that child suffers from PDD or an autistic spectrum disorder, nothing in child\u2019s behavior led Dudley (or child\u2019s current therapist, Hubbard) to such a diagnosis. Rather, child consistently presented with age-appropriate behavior and normal speech and activity throughout visits and interacted in a warm and affectionate manner with both parents. Dudley concluded that, \u201cwhile some mild developmental delays have been noted in the record, much of [child\u2019s] emotional and behavioral difficulties are a function of a highly dysfunctional family situation.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b637-6\">Dudley completed psychological tests of father, Nicole, and mother. He found father to be a relatively calm and extroverted person with high self-esteem, who can be \u201crather assertive and potentially domineering,\u201d and a concrete thinker who \u201cis not vulnerable to situational stress and who approaches problems in a very pragmatic and matter of fact manner.\u201d Nicole is energetic and generally concrete in her thinking, but relatively accommodating and unassertive. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"588\">*588</page-number>Mother is \u201cmore anxious and high strung than most,\u201d very rule conscious and structured, but also \u201cvery reactive to situational stress\u201d with \u201cdifficulty modulating [her] feelings of anxiety\u201d with elevated \u201chypersensitivity and suspiciousness * * * suggestive of clinical paranoia,\u201d particularly in regard to father.</p>\n<p id=\"b638-3\">Dudley noted disturbing trends in child\u2019s behavior after the 2005 custody determination. Father reported to Dudley that, after having phone contact with mother, child tended to act out more, often toward Nicole. Dudley was particularly concerned about child\u2019s extremely negative statements about Nicole, which were \u201cindicative of alignment or alienation, or at the very least, exposure to extreme negativity towards [Nicole] on the part of [mother].\u201d Child displayed increasing verbal and physical aggression toward Nicole. For example, he spat at Nicole, hit her, and threatened to cut off her face and hands and to slice her throat open and kill her. He called her a \u201cf-ing bitch,\u201d \u201cslut,\u201d and \u201cho.\u201d Child\u2019s therapist, Hubbard, indicated that, in light of child\u2019s age, child was likely repeating something he had heard in referring to Nicole as \u201cNick-ho.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b638-4\">Father and Nicole reported an incident when father awoke during the middle of the night to find child standing next to the bed with a baseball bat in hand. When asked what he was doing, child said that he was going to hit Nicole in the head while she was sleeping. When father asked why, child said, \u201cMy mom told me to.\u201d Nicole testified that, on another occasion, child reported that mother was going to have somebody kill Nicole; during a trip to the store, child was \u201clooking all around and he was just acting scared and wanted to hurry up and get back to the house\u201d so that they would be safe.</p>\n<p id=\"b638-5\">Another development that Dudley found concerning was that, when in mother\u2019s care or during parent exchanges from mother\u2019s house, child would occasionally wear nail polish and girls\u2019 clothing. Further, mother had both of child\u2019s ears pierced. Mother claimed that child wanted to wear earrings and have his nails polished, but she also testified that she believed father to be homophobic. Father reported to Dudley that he did not approve of child wearing the earrings that mother sent him wearing, which impressed Dudley as <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"589\">*589</page-number>being rather feminine. Nicole testified that, after arriving with his ears pierced the first time, child stated that he was \u201cgay\u201d because \u201c[t]hat\u2019s what my mom said.\u201d Sometimes the polish would not come off with polish remover, and child informed Nicole that \u201chis mom put [s]uper [g]lue over the top to make it stay.\u201d Dudley was concerned about these aspects of child\u2019s appearance because they were \u201cin sharp contrast with how I observed him playing at both households, which was generally more kind of stereotypic[al] male play behavior.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b639-4\">Eventually, the court ordered that \u201c[n]either party shall return the child to the other party with nail polish on his fingernails.\u201d Dudley testified that child\u2019s feminine appearance \u201ccorresponding with visits to Dad, * * * heat[s] up the conflict between the parties.\u201d Additionally, Dudley expressed concern that, in the long term, it could create confusion for child \u201cbecause it\u2019s not consistent with the boy\u2019s gender, and, by virtue of his play, his gender orientation.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b639-5\">Dudley also observed the effects of parental conflicts on child. Mother insisted not only that the parties use Safety Matters for child\u2019s transitions but also that she needed two days\u2019 advance notice for father to attend child\u2019s therapy sessions or doctor visits so that she could arrange a security escort. Dudley felt that mother did not want father involved and that child was \u201cresponding more and more to the parental conflict,\u201d becoming \u201ca much more active participant\u201d in the conflict. Sabin expressed similar concerns to parents that child was \u201clearning to relate to each [parent] by saying negative things about the other.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b639-6\">Ultimately, Dudley felt that father was better equipped to provide for child\u2019s needs in the situation. He observed that mother has an \u201coverly suspicious and paranoid personality style, and is predisposed to perceive pathology on the part of [child],\u201d while father is \u201cgenerally more emotionally stable.\u201d Dudley was more concerned about the \u201coverall impact of parental psychopathology upon [child] relative to [mother\u2019s] overly suspicious perceptions, emotional reactivity, and tendency to perceive [child\u2019s] behavior in an overly pathological manner.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b639-7\">Child\u2019s attorney, Smith, agreed with Dudley\u2019s assessment of parents and advocated for a change in custody. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"590\">*590</page-number>Smith communicated with child during several custody transitions and visited both parents\u2019 homes over the course of a year. She observed an increase in conflict between the parties and, after Sabin\u2019s resignation, eventually filled a role similar to a parenting coordinator, mediating disputes over matters such as telephone contact and visit transitions.</p>\n<p id=\"b640-4\">Smith testified about child\u2019s emotional display. During a visit at mother\u2019s home, Smith asked child, who was comfortably playing, to identify the people in photos in his room. Child calmly identified his mother, but when asked to identify his father, he</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b640-5\">\u201csprang up, grabbed the photo and threw it as hard as he could across the room and back into his closet. [Child] then stood there, his body completely rigid, his fists clenched and his face turning red as he screamed, \u2018That fucking man. That fucking man. I hate him. He\u2019s stupid. He\u2019s a liar.\u2019 \u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b640-6\">Smith was alarmed at that complete change in demeanor. She \u201ctried to calm him down[, but child] ignored all of that and sat back down on the floor and almost immediately started playing again.\u201d When questioned about it, child reiterated that his dad was a liar and that he was stupid, but was not interested in discussing why he made those comments or why he used that kind of language. In a later home visit with child at his father\u2019s house, Smith noticed that child also had photos of his mother. Curious to see if she would get a similar response there, she asked child, \u201cHow\u2019s your mom?\u201d Child replied simply that he loved and missed his mom.</p>\n<p id=\"b640-7\">Smith also described events suggesting that mother had dyed child\u2019s hair and then accused father of maliciously doing so. Smith was present during the child exchange. When father was picking child up, Smith noticed that child\u2019s hair was bright red from dye that apparently had been recently applied: Smith had tousled child\u2019s hair, and it took a couple of days to get the color off her hand. Father indicated it was not the first time that child had arrived at an exchange with wet red hair. The very next week, Smith observed the return exchange. When Smith and child reached mother, mother pointed to child\u2019s head before greeting him, looked at Smith and said, \u2018You see that? [Father] dyed his hair. He knew we were doing photos this week and he\u2019s ruined our <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"591\">*591</page-number>photos.\u201d Mother told Smith that father had done similar things in the past when he knew that she was going to have photos done or there was a special occasion.</p>\n<p id=\"b641-3\">During the custody evaluation period, mother made another accusation of criminal conduct by father. The Washington Department of Social and Health Services, Children Protective Services (CPS) received a report that father was \u201cmaking and selling meth\u201d and made an unannounced visit. Mother informed Smith that she was concerned because child had spoken of possible drug manufacturing paraphernalia, but Smith had noticed no evidence of drug use during her recent visit. CPS found no evidence of any drug involvement at father\u2019s house, determined the allegation was unfounded, and closed the case.</p>\n<p id=\"b641-4\">After several days of trial, the court concluded that the increase in parental conflict created a change in circumstances that negatively impacted child, but did not find that a change in custody was in child\u2019s best interests. Mother retained primary custody and father received reduced parenting time.</p>\n<p id=\"b641-5\">On appeal, father renews his arguments that the elevated parental conflict, in which child has become an increasingly active participant, constitutes an unanticipated change of circumstances and awarding father custody is in child\u2019s best interests because mother has excluded father from participation in child\u2019s medical evaluations and treatment, pursued diagnoses that avoided looking at how the conflict has affected child, and interfered with child\u2019s relationship with father and other family members. Father contends that he can best facilitate a relationship between child and mother.</p>\n<p id=\"b641-6\">For her part, mother argues that the parties\u2019 conflict and its effect on child did not increase sufficiently to create a change of circumstances and that, in all events, the court correctly determined that it was in child\u2019s best interest to remain with mother. She contends that she merely sought appropriate medical care for child and will best facilitate a relationship between child and father.</p>\n<p id=\"b642-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"592\">*592</page-number>A party seeking a change of custody must show, first, that \u201ccircumstances relevant to the capacity of either the moving party or the legal custodian to take care of the child properly have changed\u201d since the entry of the last custody order and, second, that, \u201cconsidering the asserted change of circumstances in the context of all relevant evidence, it would be in the child\u2019s best interests to change custody.\u201d <em>Boldt and Boldt, </em>344 Or 1, 9, 176 P3d 388, <em>cert </em>den,_US_, 129 S Ct 47 (2008). We find such a change of circumstances here and conclude that changing custody is in child\u2019s best interests.</p>\n<p id=\"b642-6\"> Focusing on evidence that arose after the 2005 custody determination, <em>Greisamer and Greisamer, </em>276 Or 397, 401-02, 555 P2d 28 (1976), we agree with the trial court that the escalated conflict between the parties has had an adverse effect on child sufficient to constitute a change in circumstances. Adequate care and supervision by the custodial parent includes the promotion of a healthy relationship between the child and the noncustodial parent. <em>Connelly and Connelly, </em>215 Or App 465, 474, 169 P3d 1279 (2007). Where the claimed change of circumstances involves events of inadequate care and supervision, they \u201cmust be of [such] a nature or number [reflecting] a course of conduct or pattern [that] has had or threatens to have a discernable adverse effect upon the child.\u201d <em>Niedert and Niedert, </em>28 Or App 309, 314, 559 P2d 515, <em>rev den, </em>277 Or 237 (1977). Here, mother\u2019s pattern of actions has undermined child\u2019s ability to have a healthy relationship with father and embroiled child in the parental conflict.</p>\n<p id=\"b642-7\">Dudley\u2019s recommendation to change custody was based largely on the escalation of parental conflict. Dudley commented that, \u201cgiven that I do a lot of this work, I see a lot of high-conflict families, and this is really one of the top of the list.\u201d He noted that child has made \u201csome very unusual verbalizations [and] behaved in a threatening manner * * * that\u2019s pretty extreme.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b642-8\">Dudley\u2019s conclusion is consistent with our view of the record. Child\u2019s extreme comments and behavior\u2014 including verbal attacks on father and Nicole and standing over Nicole with a baseball bat in the middle of the night\u2014 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"593\">*593</page-number>appear to reflect mother\u2019s influence. Child\u2019s grooming and appearance during transfers for parenting time with father seem calculated to provoke conflict. Mother has interfered with father\u2019s participation in child\u2019s medical evaluation and treatment, contrary to treatment providers\u2019 recommendations. All of that evidence supports the conclusion that the escalation of conflict between the parties, and particularly mother\u2019s evident role in that conflict, has had an adverse effect on child and represents an unforeseen change of circumstances.</p>\n<p id=\"b643-4\"> We next consider, in the context of all relevant evidence \u2014 including evidence considered at the prior custody proceeding, <em>Greisamer, 216 </em>Or at 401 \u2014 whether changing custody is in child\u2019s best interests, <em>Boldt, </em>344 Or at 9. In determining child\u2019s best interests, we consider the following relevant factors:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b643-5\">\u201c(a) The emotional ties between the child and other family members;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b643-6\">\u201c(b) The interest of the parties in and attitude toward the child;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b643-7\">\u201c(c) The desirability of continuing an existing relationship;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b643-8\">\u201c(d) The abuse of one parent by the other;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b643-9\">\u201c(e) The preference for the primary caregiver of the child, if the caregiver is deemed fit by the court; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b643-10\">\u201c(f) The willingness and ability of each parent to facilitate and encourage a close and continuing relationship between the other parent and the child. However, the court may not consider such willingness and ability if one parent shows that the other parent has sexually assaulted or engaged in a pattern of behavior of abuse against the parent or a child and that a continuing relationship with the other parent will endanger the health or safety of either parent or the child.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b643-11\">ORS 107.137(1). A parent seeking to change custody must establish by a preponderance of the evidence that it is in the child\u2019s best interest to do so. <em>Id., Smith and Smith, </em>290 Or 567, 571, 624 P2d 114 (1981); <em>Holcomb and Holcomb, </em>132 Or App 498, 503, 888 P2d 1046, <em>rev den, </em>321 Or 94 (1995).</p>\n<p id=\"b644-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"594\">*594</page-number>Here, although the trial court concluded that it was in child\u2019s best interests to remain with mother, we conclude otherwise. We address the trial court\u2019s findings regarding specific factors in our discussion below, but pause to note that the trial court specifically declined to make any credibility findings on issues where there was conflicting testimony, including the troubling issues regarding custody exchanges and child\u2019s involvement in the conflict, which figure prominently in our analysis. The record contains testimony and recommendations from neutral professionals who had extensive opportunities to evaluate the circumstances. That body of evidence, which contains consistent and well-supported articulations of concerns about mother\u2019s involvement of child in parental conflicts, carries significant weight in our analysis.</p>\n<p id=\"b644-4\">We turn to an examination of each statutory factor. Two of the factors, ORS 107.137(l)(a) and (c), equally favor both parents. Child has emotional ties with other family members on both sides of his family, and he has an interest in continuing the relationships that he has with both parents. Thus, those factors do not weigh heavily in our analysis.</p>\n<p id=\"b644-5\">The statutory preference for the child\u2019s primary caregiver, ORS 107.137(l)(e), is more complicated. We agree with the trial court\u2019s finding that mother has been the primary caregiver and, \u201c[s]eparate from consideration of other factors, * * * is a fit caregiver.\u201d However, in light of what the trial court termed mother\u2019s \u201cnear obsession\u201d with micromanaging child\u2019s diagnosis and treatment and her approach to coparenting with father, we share the concerns regarding mother\u2019s parenting abilities that the trial court first articulated in the 2005 custody determination. Accordingly, we consider the preference for the primary parent outweighed by other factors under consideration.</p>\n<p id=\"b644-6\">We next consider the parties\u2019 interest in and attitude toward child, ORS 107.137(l)(b). We agree with the trial court\u2019s findings that (1) both parents have a positive image of child and love him, but on occasion have manipulated him in order to develop evidence for custody, and (2) father is more likely to allow child to be himself, but mother takes her concerns about his developmental problems \u201cto the point of near <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"595\">*595</page-number>obsession.\u201d Although the trial court perceived some improvement in mother\u2019s attitude toward child\u2019s problems, that apparent attitude shift occurred under the watchful eye of the court during the six months preceding the custody determination. Also, both Dudley and Smith expressed the view that father was more stable, that child was more likely to thrive under his care, and that mother demonstrated a willingness to use child in an effort to manipulate father and build her case for custody. Her pattern of sending child to father\u2019s home with changes to his appearance apparently designed to provoke father, along with child\u2019s aggressive language and physical abuse toward Nicole, reflect mother\u2019s involvement of child in parental conflict that is destructive to child. Accordingly, like the trial court, we conclude that this factor favors father.</p>\n<p id=\"b645-3\">We next consider whether there is evidence of \u201cabuse of one parent by the other.\u201d ORS 107.137(l)(d). We agree with the trial court that neither parent abused the other, as defined in ORS 107.705, and that this factor does not favor either parent.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b645-4\">Most significantly, we address each parent\u2019s willingness and ability to facilitate and encourage child\u2019s relationship with the other parent. The trial court explicitly declined to resolve conflicts in testimony regarding problems with custody exchanges and mother\u2019s role in fomenting conflict between the parties. Choosing to rely only on undisputed facts, the court found by a \u201cclose call\u201d that mother was more likely to facilitate and encourage a continuing relationship between father and child. We consider the entire record, not only undisputed facts. Our <em>de novo </em>review of the record leads us to conclude \u2014 consistently with the views of Dudley, Smith, and Bell \u2014 that father is more likely to facilitate and encourage a positive relationship with mother than the reverse.</p>\n<p id=\"b645-5\">Mother\u2019s interference with father\u2019s relationship with child has been severe. Mother has a pattern of making <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"596\">*596</page-number>unsubstantiated criminal accusations against father, has obstructed his access to child\u2019s treatment providers, and has sent child to father\u2019s house with changes in his appearance designed to provoke conflict. By contrast, father has engaged in minor interference with mother\u2019s telephone access to child during visits, and father reports that mother likewise denied him telephone access. Although both parents should have telephone access to child, father\u2019s behavior does not give rise to the same concerns as mother\u2019s pattern of behavior. Accordingly, although we share the court\u2019s concerns about both parties, we conclude that this factor favors father.</p>\n<p id=\"b646-3\">Considering all these factors together, we are persuaded that it is in child\u2019s best interests for father to have custody. Both parties have contributed to the parental conflict, but mother\u2019s escalation of that conflict, heedless of the effect on child, shows a willingness to disregard child\u2019s needs and has been damaging to child. Both Dudley and Bell had the opportunity to observe child and parents at both households over the course of several months; Bell\u2019s evaluation provides early support for Dudley\u2019s later determination that mother tends to pathologize child and that father is more accepting and more willing to recognize the effect of the parental conflict on child. Smith likewise observed child and parents over an extended period, and she too advocated a change in custody. We likewise conclude that a change in custody is in child\u2019s best interests.</p>\n<p id=\"b646-4\">Finally, we address the issue of attorney fees. Both parties appeal the attorney fee ruling, which ordered father to pay $26,931.53 toward mother\u2019s fees and $15,000 toward child\u2019s attorney\u2019s fees, and required mother to pay the balance of her own fees and $5,000 toward child\u2019s attorney\u2019s fees. Given our disposition of this appeal and the lack of adequate findings in the record,<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> we vacate the attorney fee award and remand for the trial court to address the issue of fees.</p>\n<p id=\"b647-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"597\">*597</page-number>Reversed and remanded for entry of judgment granting legal and physical custody of child to father and for development of a plan giving mother reasonable parenting time; supplemental judgment for attorney fees vacated and remanded.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b630-7\"> Because the notice of appeal in this case was filed before June 4, 2009, we apply the 2007 version of ORS 19.415. Or Laws 2009, ch 231, \u00a7 3.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b631-7\"> Mother invited B\u2019s mother (father\u2019s ex-wife) to move in with her. Mother then disclaimed any concern about B being a danger to child and encouraged her to visit.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b645-6\"> The trial court commented, \u201cThat does not mean that [mother\u2019s] feelings of fear and distrust of [father] are unjustified.\u201d On this record, we are not satisfied that mother\u2019s feelings are justified, and we note that mother\u2019s history of making unfounded criminal allegations and accusations of abuse has played a part in escalating the conflict between the parties that has been so destructive to child.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b646-5\"> Mother claims that the court made discretionary findings in a hearing held July 2007, but that hearing was not recorded and a transcript is not available. At a September 2007 hearing, the court indicated that that it would make discretionary findings on the pertinent ORS 20.075 factors when the court issued an order on attorney fees, and the January 2008 supplemental judgment incorporates \u201csubstantive [flindings and rulings from trial,\u201d as the basis for award of attorney fees. However, we have not located any such findings in the record.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
