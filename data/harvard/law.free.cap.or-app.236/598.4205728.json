The state concedes that there is insufficient evidence to support a finding that appellant\u2019s disorder caused him to be a danger to himself, but maintains that the evidence shows that he is unable to provide for his basic needs. On <em>de novo </em>review,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> <em>State v. O\u2019Neill, </em>274 Or 59, 61, 545 P2d 97 (1976), we accept the state\u2019s concession, and, because we conclude that there was insufficient evidence that appellant was unable to meet his basic needs, we reverse.</p>\n<p id=\"b650-5\">We review the facts as they existed on the date of the commitment hearing. <em>State v. Miller, </em>198 Or App 153, 155, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"601\">*601</page-number>107 P3d 683 (2005). Here, the record establishes the following facts. Appellant was diagnosed with schizophrenia and had been living with his grandmother for 10 to 12 years. Due to his mental illness, appellant did not want to leave his grandmother\u2019s home. Appellant treated his schizophrenia with medication. His mother regularly obtained the medication from a mental health service provider and delivered it to him. After appellant missed appointments at the provider, it refused to dispense the medication to appellant\u2019s mother. Appellant discontinued that treatment.</p>\n<p id=\"b651-4\">On December 1, 2008 \u2014 after appellant failed to take his medication for three months \u2014 he destroyed his bedroom, smeared feces on the floors and walls, and injured his hands causing them to bleed. Appellant\u2019s grandmother testified that appellant\u2019s room was \u201cabsolutely totally destroyed this time. Every picture \u2014 the only thing not broken was a window \u2014 the window in his bedroom. Anything breakable was on the floor in pieces.\u201d Appellant told the court that he incurred cuts on his hands by \u201cpushing glass through a wall.\u201d At his commitment hearing, appellant stated that he did not intend to cut or hurt himself when pushing glass through walls, but that it was part of a religious battle he was going through at the time and that the battle had since ended. Appellant also stated that the smearing of feces was part of that battle.</p>\n<p id=\"AcH\">Appellant\u2019s grandmother is frail and elderly and has heart problems. Due to these physical ailments and the stress of appellant\u2019s behavior while off medication, she testified that he could no longer live at her home. Appellant\u2019s grandmother described him as a very charming, loving, and responsive person when he is on medication. Appellant helped her with groceries, garbage, laundry, and other household tasks. However, when appellant was off his medication, his grandmother stated that she had to ask for help with household tasks, and his assistance was not prompt.</p>\n<p id=\"b651-6\">Appellant manages his own money, receives approximately $400 in Social Security funds each month, and has about $800 in a checking account. He also has clean hygiene and has not gained or lost weight recently. During mental examinations at the commitment hearing, appellant gave <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"602\">*602</page-number>varied answers regarding his living plans on release. He did not fully understand that he could not return to live at his grandmother\u2019s home and proposed that he would live by a lake if released. Appellant testified that he did not want to return to Bridge View, a living facility where he had stayed in the past, but at certain points in his testimony he agreed to go there and comply with a medication regimen.</p>\n<p id=\"b652-4\">Appellant was examined by two mental health examiners during the civil commitment hearing. After questioning appellant, examiner David Mohler testified that he believed that appellant suffered from a schizophrenic mental disorder and expressed concern about appellant\u2019s destructive behavior, \u201cparticularly pushing his hands through glass and spreading his feces around,\u201d which Mohler described as a \u201cregressed schizophrenic activity.\u201d In his examiner\u2019s report, Mohler stated that appellant \u201cis unable to articulate any plan for self care even though he has resources he could use to secure food and housing.\u201d Examiner Fonda Edelson drew a similar determination, testifying that appellant\u2019s disorganization, impaired judgment, and schizophrenic traits made him unable to care for himself. In her examiner\u2019s report, Edelson stated that appellant\u2019s inability \u201cto formulate and execute a plan for his basic needs\u201d was evidence of appellant\u2019s inability to provide for his basic needs.</p>\n<p id=\"b652-5\">The trial court agreed with the examiners\u2019 assessments and had appellant committed because his mental disorder made him unable to provide for his basic needs and he was a danger to himself. The court stated that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b652-6\">\u201che continues to be very psychotic, he continues to be involved in spiritual battles, he \u2014 and continues to be unable to organize his thoughts well enough to provide me with a reasonable and credible plan.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b652-7\">The court ordered appellant to be committed for a period not to exceed 180 days.</p>\n<p id=\"b652-8\">On appeal, appellant argues that the state failed to prove, by clear and convincing evidence, that his mental disorder made him unable to provide for his basic needs or that he was a danger to himself. As noted earlier, we agree that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"603\">*603</page-number>there was insufficient evidence to prove appellant was a danger to himself. For the reasons that follow, we agree with appellant that the state failed to prove that he was mentally ill on the ground that his mental disorder made him unable to provide for his basic needs.</p>\n<p id=\"b653-4\">ORS 426.005(l)(e)(B) defines a \u201cmentally ill person\u201d as a person, who, because of a mental disorder, is \u201c[u]nable to provide for basic personal needs and is not receiving such care as is necessary for health or safety.\u201d Sufficient proof to commit a \u201cmentally ill person\u201d on that basis under ORS 426.130(l)(b) \u201crequires more than evidence of speculative threats to safe survival.\u201d <em>State v. M. C., </em>227 Or App 530, 534, 206 P3d 1096 (2009). In order to commit a person on \u201cbasic needs\u201d grounds,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b653-5\">\u201c[t]he state must establish by clear and convincing evidence that the individual, due to a mental disorder, is unable to obtain some commodity <em>(e.g., </em>food and water) or service <em>(e.g., </em>life-saving medical care) without which he cannot sustain life.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b653-6\"><em>State v. Bunting, </em>112 Or App 143, 145, 826 P2d 1060 (1992).</p>\n<p id=\"b653-7\"> Put another way, the \u201cbasic needs\u201d standard requires clear and convincing evidence that \u201cthere is a likelihood that the person probably would not survive in the near future because the person is unable to provide for basic personal needs.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 146. Furthermore, the \u201cclear and convincing evidence\u201d standard of proof requires that the state produce evidence that is of \u201cextraordinary persuasiveness\u201d and that makes the facts at issue \u201chighly probable.\u201d <em>State v. Allen, </em>209 Or App 647, 652, 149 P3d 289 (2006). Although \u201c[t]he goal of the commitment statute is safe survival, not merely the avoidance of immediate death,\u201d and therefore the state \u201cneed not postpone action until the individual is on the brink of death,\u201d <em>Bunting, </em>112 Or App at 145, the state has not shown in this case that appellant\u2019s refusal to take his medication and inability to organize a plan for his care presents an imminent likelihood that he would not survive in the near future.</p>\n<p id=\"b653-8\">The facts in this case are analogous to those in <em>State v. Baxter, </em>138 Or App 94, 906 P2d 849 (1995). Although <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"604\">*604</page-number>fact-matching in mental commitment cases is not particularly useful and each case must be determined on its own facts, <em>State v. Jayne, </em>174 Or App 74, 82, 23 P3d 990 (2001), we find the reasoning in <em>Baxter </em>persuasive in the context of this case. In <em>Baxter, </em>the appellant was committed because the court determined that his mental disorder rendered him unable to provide for his basic needs. In that case, the appellant was diagnosed with schizophrenia, was off his medication, had been committed to several hospitals for mental treatments, received Social Security funds, and planned to go to a shelter or \u201ccamp out\u201d on release. 138 Or App at 99. On appeal, we held that the state failed to meet its burden, reasoning that \u201cthere is no medical evidence establishing that schizophrenia is <em>per se </em>life-threatening\u201d and that, \u201cby itself, failing to take medication is not sufficient if it causes only a speculative threat.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 98 (emphasis in the original). Moreover, we stated that, \u201c[ajlthough the lack of certain shelter is not a good plan, we cannot say that homelessness by itself is sufficient grounds for commitment.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 99.</p>\n<p id=\"b654-4\">Like the alleged mentally ill person in <em>Baxter, </em>appellant was diagnosed with schizophrenia, was off his medication, subsisted on Social Security funds, and planned to live without shelter on release. As in <em>Baxter, </em>appellant\u2019s failure to treat his schizophrenia was proved to be only a speculative threat to his well-being. The minor cuts that appellant inflicted on himself while pushing glass through walls were not life threatening. Appellant\u2019s failure to take his prescribed medication caused a change in his behavior, but that behavior was not so severe as to cause a threat to his survival. Although it seems plausible that appellant will not have housing services available on release, as we said in <em>Baxter, </em>homelessness is not adequate justification for involuntary commitment. <em>Id. </em>at 99. In order for homelessness to be sufficient justification, there needs to be \u201ca likelihood that the person probably would not survive in the near future because the person is unable to provide for basic personal needs and is not receiving care necessary for health or safety.\u201d <em>Bunting, </em>112 Or App at 146. Here, nothing in the record indicates that to be the case.</p>\n<p id=\"b654-5\">Appellant has not lacked housing, food, or medical care in the past. There is little evidence in the record from <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"605\">*605</page-number>which to infer the effect of his untreated mental disorder on the provision of those necessities. To the contrary, appellant had roughly $800 in a bank account with which he could buy food and water and obtain shelter. Appellant claimed to have health insurance through which he can obtain medical services as needed. The testimony by appellant\u2019s grandmother, mother, and mental health examiners claiming that appellant would be unable to provide for his basic needs on release was purely speculative. Because the mental commitment statute \u201crequires more than evidence of speculative threats to safe survival,\u201d <em>M. C., </em>227 Or App at 534, the record in this case was insufficient to prove by clear and convincing evidence that appellant was unable to provide for his basic needs. Accordingly, the state failed to prove that appellant was \u201cmentally ill\u201d and qualified for involuntary commitment under ORS 426.130(1).</p>\n<p id=\"b655-5\">Reversed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b650-6\"> ORS 426.130(1) provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b650-7\">\u201cAfter hearing all of the evidence, and reviewing the findings of the examining persons, the court shall determine whether the person is mentally ill.
