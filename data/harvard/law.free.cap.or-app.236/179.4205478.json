Defendant advances three arguments on appeal. First, he contends that the trial court erred in entering separate convictions on the money-laundering counts. His second contention is that the court erred in admitting certain evidence over his objection based on OEC 403 that the evidence would unduly prejudice the jury against him. Third, defendant contends that the court erred in instructing the jury that it could convict him based on a nonunanimous verdict. We reject defendant\u2019s latter two arguments without discussion and write only to address the issue of merger of the convictions for money laundering; we reverse and remand for merger of those convictions.</p>\n<p id=\"b210-5\">ORS 164.170(1) defines the crime of \u201claundering a monetary instrument,\u201d and defendant\u2019s three money-laundering counts were based on different paragraphs within that subsection. As we have noted, defendant asserts that the trial court should have merged his convictions on those three counts, because, in his view, those paragraphs simply describe different ways in which a person can commit the single crime of money laundering. He acknowledges that he failed to preserve that claim of error, but urges this court to exercise its discretion to correct it as error \u201capparent on the face of the record\u201d under ORAP 5.45(1). <em>See State v. Brown, </em>310 Or 347, 355, 800 P2d 259 (1990) (providing that an error qualifies as error apparent on the face of the record, or \u201cplain error,\u201d if (1) it is an error of law; (2) the legal point is not reasonably in dispute; and (3) the court does not have to go beyond the record to identify the error).</p>\n<p id=\"b210-6\">The state concedes that defendant\u2019s merger argument is correct under ORS 161.067(1), which provides in part that, \u201c[w]hen the same conduct or criminal episode violates <em>two or more statutory provisions </em>* * *, there are as many separately punishable offenses as there are separate statutory violations.\u201d (Emphasis added.) The state acknowledges that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"181\">*181</page-number>this court typically exercises its discretion to review and correct such an error as plain error. Furthermore, the state notes that the prosecutor told the court, at sentencing, that the money-laundering counts represented three different theories for how defendant committed a single crime and not three separate crimes.</p>\n<p id=\"b211-4\">We agree that the court plainly erred in failing to merge defendant\u2019s convictions for money laundering. The error is one of law, is not in dispute, and is apparent on the face of the record. We also agree that it is appropriate to exercise our discretion to correct the error. <em>See State v. Camacho-Alvarez, </em>225 Or App 215, 216, 200 P3d 613 (2009) (\u201c[I]n the past, we have held that \u2018failure to merge\u2019 errors are apparent on the face of the record and have chosen to exercise our discretion to review and correct those errors under ORAP 5.45.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b211-5\">Convictions for laundering a monetary instrument on Counts 4, 5, and 6 reversed and remanded with instructions to enter a single conviction reflecting that defendant was found guilty on all three theories and remanded for resentencing; otherwise affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
