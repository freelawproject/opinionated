As part of defendant\u2019s sentence, the court ordered her to pay $18,145.30 in restitution, ORS 137.106, and $1,200 as a compensatory fine, ORS 137.101. On appeal, defendant argues that the trial court erred in ordering the compensatory fine because such fines are authorized only for objectively verifiable monetary losses and the state did not adduce any evidence that the $1,200 met that criterion. Because that argument differs from the argument that defendant made to the trial court and, as a consequence, the state never had the opportunity to respond to it, we decline to address it on appeal. We therefore affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b189-5\">Defendant, while intoxicated, stole a car belonging to the Donnellys. The Donnellys knew defendant and reported the theft to the police. When an officer saw the stolen car and tried to pull it over, defendant sped away through downtown La Grande, reaching speeds estimated to be near 80 miles per hour, and stopped only when she crashed the car into a tree, injuring herself and totally destroying the vehicle.</p>\n<p id=\"b189-6\">After negotiations with the prosecution, defendant pleaded guilty to the above charges; three other charges were dismissed with prejudice. At sentencing, the state sought restitution. The Donnellys\u2019 insurance company valued the car at $18,145.30; the Donnellys had a policy with a $1,000 deductible. The state argued that defendant should be ordered to pay the insurer $17,145.30, and the Donnellys $1,000. When Mr. Donnelly spoke during the sentencing hearing, however, it became clear that the Donnellys had incurred expenses beyond the $1,000 deductible. It is not clear, however, whether that additional expense resulted from the fact that the Donnellys\u2019 insurer concluded that the value of the stolen car was $1,200 less than the amount that the Donnellys had to spend for a replacement, or from the fact that the Donnellys had made only one payment on the destroyed car and that payment went entirely to interest. Mr. Donnelly stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b189-7\">\u201c[T]he insurance and the gap insurance wouldn\u2019t pay the full amount [for the new car]. There was still like <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"160\">*160</page-number>$1,200.00 that * * * the dealership wasn\u2019t willing to add * * * to the new loan. We had to get our own \u2014 a new loan processed and start it. Because we only made one payment on [the stolen] vehicle. We\u2019d only had it for a month.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b190-4\">* * * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b190-5\">\u201c[We spent] around $1,200.00 some dollars that * * * had to be added to the new loan because that was what was left on the loan for the new vehicle after the insurance paid their part.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b190-6\">After this information came to the state\u2019s attention, the state asked the court for additional restitution to cover the $1,200. The trial court did not believe that those costs were appropriate for restitution and thought they would be more appropriate as a compensatory fine. The court stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b190-7\">\u201cI \u2014 the thing is I can\u2019t order anything that\u2019s not a \u2014 that\u2019s not a result of \u2014 of the damage, you know, as restitution. I can order, I believe you\u2019ve asked for a compensatory] fine and I might be able to \u2014 to raise that to $1,200.00 to cover\u2014 cover that because that\u2019s part of one of the things in the\u2014 being without a vehicle for three weeks, that\u2019s a loss and plus \u2014 and\u2014and I \u2014 I think I can order that. But I don\u2019t think I can order it as restitution.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b190-8\">The court did not explain why it believed that restitution was inappropriate or why it believed that a compensatory fine was. The state, however, agreed to characterize the $1,200 as a compensatory fine. Defendant objected, arguing that the statute governing compensatory fines, ORS 137.101(1), limited such fines to the amount that could be recovered in a civil action, and the $1,200 did not meet that criterion. The statute provides, in part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b190-9\">\u201cWhenever the court imposes a fine as penalty for the commission of a crime resulting in injury for which the person injured by the act constituting the crime has a remedy by civil action, unless the issue of punitive damages has been previously decided on a civil case arising out of the same act and transaction, the court may order that the defendant pay any portion of the fine separately to the clerk of the court as compensatory fines in the case. The clerk shall pay over to the injured victim or victims, as directed in the court\u2019s order, moneys paid to the court as compensatory <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"161\">*161</page-number>fines under this subsection. This section shall be liberally construed in favor of victims.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b191-4\">Defendant did not explain why she believed that the Donnellys did not have a \u201cremedy by civil action.\u201d The court overruled defendant\u2019s objection and, when it later imposed the compensatory fine, explained:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b191-5\">\u201cI\u2019m [going to] order a $1,200.00 compensatory] fine to cover not only the \u2014 well, to cover basically their * * * not having a car. I imagine there was other things that were in that vehicle that were either lost or damaged or whatever that were never \u2014 never retrieved. * * * An insurance claim rarely, if ever, if ever pays all the damages to somebody. It may \u2014 may look good on paper, but it doesn\u2019t cover the damages that I believe are covered by the compensatory] fine.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b191-6\">Defendant did not object to that ruling at the time.</p>\n<p id=\"b191-7\">On appeal, defendant makes the following argument. A \u201cvictim\u201d for purposes of the compensatory fine statute is defined in ORS 137.103(4) as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b191-8\">\u201c \u2018Victim\u2019 means:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b191-9\">\u201c(a) The person against whom the defendant committed the criminal offense, if the court determines that the person has suffered economic damages as a result of the offense.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b191-10\">\u201c(b) Any person not described in paragraph (a) of this subsection whom the court determines has suffered economic damages as a result of the defendant\u2019s criminal activities.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b191-11\">\u00ab\u2021 # \u2021 \u2021</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b191-12\">\u201c(d) An insurance carrier, if it has expended moneys on behalf of a victim described in paragraph (a) of this subsection.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b191-13\">\u201cEconomic damages,\u201d in turn, \u201c[h]as the meaning given that term in ORS 31.710,\u201d ORS 137.103(2), which provides, as relevant, that the term \u201cmeans objectively verifiable monetary losses.\u201d According to defendant, \u201c[t]he state presented no evidence of \u2018objectively verifiable monetary losses.\u2019 \u201d Although defendant\u2019s brief is not altogether clear on this point, the argument seems to be this: The court ruled that the $1,200 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"162\">*162</page-number>compensatory fine was justified as compensation for loss of use of the car while it was being replaced, or for items that were in the car and were destroyed with it. The only evidence at trial, however, was that the Donnellys lost $1,200 in either prepaid interest or undervaluation by the insurer; there was no testimony or other evidence of the losses upon which the court ultimately based the compensatory fine. Consequently, the state presented no evidence of the \u201ceconomic damages\u201d underlying the fine and, that being the case, there was no evidence that the Donnellys or the insurer were \u201cvictims\u201d for purposes of the compensatory fine statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b192-3\">In response, the state first notes that the argument on appeal is not the argument that defendant made below. In the alternative, the state proposes an interpretation of the compensatory fine statute under which the court is authorized to impose such a fine for the benefit of a victim in any amount that is less than the statutory maximum fine for the criminal offense \u2014 here, $125,000 for unauthorized use of a vehicle \u2014 so long as the victim would have had a remedy against the defendant in a civil action, unless the issue of punitive damages had already been litigated in such a civil action. According to the state, in other words, all that the prosecution had to prove at trial was that (1) defendant committed a crime punishable by fine, (2) that crime caused verifiable economic damages to a victim, (3) the ultimate compensatory fine imposed was less than the fine that the court could have imposed on the defendant for the crime, and (4) the issue of punitive damages had not been litigated in a civil action. In support of its position, the state notes that nothing in ORS 137.101(1) ties the amount of the compensatory fine to the amount of damages that a victim sustains and, in fact, expressly provides whenever a court imposes a punitive fine, it can designate <em>any portion </em>of it as compensatory; that ORS 137.101(2) provides that compensatory fines \u201cmay be awarded in addition to restitution\u201d and ORS 137.103(3) allows restitution \u201cin addition to a compensatory fine\u201d; and that both ORS 137.101(1) and (3) indicate that, despite being denominated as \u201ccompensatory,\u201d the fines are a criminal analog to punitive damages.</p>\n<p id=\"b193-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"163\">*163</page-number>This case, however, does not provide us with the need (or the opportunity) to consider the state\u2019s statutory argument. That is so because the state\u2019s primary argument is correct: defendant\u2019s argument on appeal was never made below and is therefore not preserved. Rules of preservation are meant to ensure that the parties\u2019 positions are presented clearly to the trial court and that the parties are not taken by surprise, misled, or denied opportunities to meet an argument. <em>State v. Olivar, </em>216 Or App 126, 135, 171 P3d 1006 (2007), <em>rev den, </em>344 Or 110 (2008). At the trial court, defendant argued that the Donnellys would not have had a civil remedy allowing them to recover for the difference between the value that the insurer determined the destroyed car to be worth, on the one hand, and, on the other hand, what they had to pay to replace it. On appeal, defendant makes an altogether different argument: There was no evidence of an objectively verifiable loss in the amount of $1,200. Had defendant made that argument below, the state may have had the opportunity to put on such evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b193-4\">We understand that, under <em>Stull v. Hoke, </em>326 Or 72, 77, 948 P2d 722 (1997), we are \u201cresponsible for identifying the correct interpretation [of a statute], whether or not asserted by the parties.\u201d That responsibility arises, however, only when the parties have put the issue of statutory interpretation before us by disagreeing as to what a statute means; in such situations, we are not limited to choosing the better of two erroneous interpretations. Here, the factual and procedural predicates for statutory interpretation simply have not arisen. Defendant loses, not because a correct interpretation of ORS 137.101(1) compels that outcome, but because she has not adequately preserved the argument that would have put the meaning of the statute at issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b193-5\">Affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
