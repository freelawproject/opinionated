Phillips, </em>235 Or App 646, 234 P3d 1030 (2010). He argues that we made an error in the procedural disposition of the appeal when we \u201cremanded for resentencing\u201d because that procedural disposition is broader than our decision to vacate the supplemental judgment on the restitution portion of defendant\u2019s sentence. <em>See id. </em>at 657. Defendant argues that the correct procedural disposition is to remand for a new restitution hearing. The state did not respond to defendant\u2019s petition. In order to clarify our intended procedural disposition, we grant the petition for reconsideration and, accordingly, modify our former opinion as follows.</p>\n<p id=\"b510-5\">In our former opinion, we stated, \u201cFor the reasons that follow, we vacate the supplemental judgment awarding restitution of $2,728.88 and remand for resentencing.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 648. We modify that sentence to omit the phrase \u201cfor resentencing.\u201d In addition, we withdraw the procedural disposition from our former opinion and substitute a new procedural disposition to provide as follows: \u201cSupplemental judgment vacated and remanded; otherwise affirmed.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b510-6\">Reconsideration allowed; former opinion modified; former disposition withdrawn; supplemental judgment vacated and remanded; otherwise affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
