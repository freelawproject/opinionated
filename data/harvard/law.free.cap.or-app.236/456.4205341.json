On appeal, he contends that his convictions should be reversed because the trial court erroneously admitted (1) hearsay testimony about what defendant had told an interpreter during an interrogation and (2) a doctor\u2019s medical diagnosis of \u201chighly concerning for sexual abuse.\u201d We agree that the trial court erred in admitting the doctor\u2019s diagnosis, and we therefore reverse defendant\u2019s convictions and remand for a new trial. Given that remand, we decline to reach defendant\u2019s hearsay argument.</p>\n<p id=\"b501-4\">Defendant was charged with three counts of first-degree sexual abuse after a young girl alleged that he had touched her breasts and vaginal area. During the course of defendant\u2019s trial, the state offered the testimony of Dr. Skinner, a physician who had examined the girl. Skinner testified that the results of the girl\u2019s physical examination were normal, but that during an interview, the girl told Skinner that defendant had touched her breasts and vaginal area. Based on those statements and previous statements the girl made to police, Skinner made a diagnosis of \u201chighly concerning for sexual abuse.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b501-5\">On appeal, defendant argues that, under the reasoning in <em>State v. Southard, </em>347 Or 127, 218 P3d 104 (2009), Skinner\u2019s medical diagnosis should have been excluded as unfairly prejudicial under OEC 403.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Defendant acknowledges that he did not preserve that claim of error, but he nonetheless urges this court to exercise its discretion to correct the error as one \u201capparent on the face of the record.\u201d ORAP 5.45(1). The state, in response, maintains that no error appears on the face of the record and that, even if it does, this is not an appropriate case in which to exercise our discretion to correct it.</p>\n<p id=\"b501-6\">We have held, on similar facts, that the trial court\u2019s admission of this type of medical diagnosis \u2014 that is, a diagnosis regarding sexual abuse based solely on a child\u2019s report \u2014 constitutes error apparent on the face of the record in light of <em>Southard. See, e.g., State v. Clay, </em>235 Or App 26, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"458\">*458</page-number>230 P3d 72 (2010); <em>State v. Merrimon, </em>234 Or App 515, 228 P3d 666 (2010); <em>State v. Lovern, </em>234 Or App 502, 228 P3d 688 (2010). We have exercised our discretion to correct the error in each instance, and we likewise do so here, for the reasons explained in those cases.</p>\n<p id=\"b502-4\">In another assignment of error, defendant contends that the trial court erred in admitting a detective\u2019s testimony regarding an interpreter\u2019s version of defendant\u2019s statements \u2014 double hearsay, he argues, under <em>State v. Rodriguez-Castillo, </em>345 Or 39, 188 P3d 268 (2008). The state counters that defendant did not preserve that claim of error, having never mentioned \u201chearsay\u201d as part of his objection to the detective\u2019s testimony. Considering that the case must be remanded, and that questions swirl regarding preservation, we decline to reach defendant\u2019s assignment of error regarding the detective\u2019s testimony. <em>Rodriguez-Castillo </em>was decided after defendant\u2019s trial, and to the extent that the hearsay issue arises on remand, the parties will have an opportunity to further develop their arguments \u2014 and the record \u2014 in the trial court.</p>\n<p id=\"b502-5\">Reversed and remanded.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b501-7\"> OEC 403 provides that relevant evidence may be excluded \u201cif its probative value is substantially outweighed by the danger of unfair prejudice * *</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
