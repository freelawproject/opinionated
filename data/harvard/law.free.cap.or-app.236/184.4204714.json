The identity theft counts were based on defendant\u2019s possession of the victim\u2019s purse, which contained five different forms of the victim\u2019s personal identification. The court entered a conviction for each count of identity theft. On appeal, defendant contends that the trial court erred in entering those separate convictions and that the identity theft convictions should have merged. In defendant\u2019s view, this case is indistinguishable from <em>State v. Mac Donald, </em>232 Or App 431, 432, 222 P3d 718 (2009), a case in which we held that the defendant\u2019s possession of the victim\u2019s wallet, which contained various different forms of personal identification, constituted a single criminal episode for the purposes of merger of convictions. The state concedes that the trial court erred in entering the separate convictions in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b215-5\">Because defendant is correct that <em>Mac Donald </em>is on point, we agree with the parties that the court should have merged the convictions. Accordingly, the case must be remanded for merger of the identity theft convictions.</p>\n<p id=\"b215-6\">Convictions for identity theft reversed and remanded with instructions to enter a judgment of conviction for one count of identity theft and for resentencing; otherwise affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
