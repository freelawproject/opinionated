J.</author>\n<p id=\"b665-4\">Defendants appeal convictions for hunting on the enclosed land of another, ORS 498.120, and aiding or sharing in a wildlife violation, ORS 496.695.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> On appeal, they argue that the land on which they were hunting was not \u201cenclosed\u201d land for purposes of ORS 498.120, and, in the alternative, that the statute is unconstitutionally vague as applied to them under the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution. We reverse because the land upon which defendants were hunting was not \u201cenclosed land\u201d under the statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b665-5\">Defendants were charged with offenses related to unlawfully and knowingly hunting on the enclosed land of another without first obtaining permission from the owner or lawful occupant. At trial, the state offered evidence that a group of men, including defendants, had entered onto land owned by Davidson Industries, a logging company, without permission and, while there, killed two elk. At the close of the state\u2019s case-in-chief, defendants moved for a judgment of acquittal, arguing that the evidence offered by the state was insufficient to prove that the area in which the elk were killed \u2014 a \u201cclear-cut\u201d area \u2014 was enclosed as required by the statute and, alternatively, that ORS 498.120 is unconstitutionally vague. Defendants did not contest that they knew when they entered the Davidson property that they were hunting on land without permission of the owner. Rather, they argued:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b665-6\">\u201c[T]here\u2019s been no testimony that this clearcut area that my client[s] [have] allegedly taken part in hunting on, the Davidsons\u2019 property, is completely enclosed. This is not a matter where there has been even an attempt to enclose <em>\u2022Jt\u00a1 </em>* * \u201d<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b666-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"616\">*616</page-number>Defendants also pointed out that there was a \u201cgap\u201d in the purported clear-cut lines where power lines were running. That gap, in defendants\u2019 view, further undermined any argument that the land was \u201cenclosed.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b666-4\">The state, in response, argued that the land in question was indeed set apart \u2014 and therefore \u201cenclosed\u201d \u2014 by the timber lines created by the clear-cut:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b666-5\">\u201cEverything is clearcut. * * * Very distinctively different from the property that is beyond Davidson to the west.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b666-6\">\u2018Yes, there is a gap where the power line runs through, but it\u2019s also obvious that the power line is continuing to run through, and that as soon as that \u2014 on the other side of the power line, that property boundary, that change into timberland, changes at the same level as it did before the power lines.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b666-7\">\u201cAnd on the north side it\u2019s the same story. There\u2019s a very clear, distinctive change in property from the clearcut land into the U.S. Forest Service property timber.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b666-8\">\u201cAnd again on the east, looking back, very clear as it goes into Rosboro.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b666-9\">\u201cAnd I think based on that there is evidence that this is an enclosed property.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b666-10\">The trial court ultimately ruled that the question was one for the jury:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b666-11\">\u201cI think the land does need to be enclosed by boundaries. But the boundaries have to be either visible, which the statute says, or they have to be distinctive, which the statute also says. And a reasonable person, such as a juror, will have to determine whether there\u2019s a boundary or not.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b666-12\">\u201cAnd I think that the statute leaves that up to the reasonableness of the trier of fact to determine whether there\u2019s a boundary or not. I think the defendants\u2019 arguments are that it\u2019s' \u2014 for the reasons that they\u2019ve suggested here, that it\u2019s not reasonable where there\u2019s not anything indicated by <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"617\">*617</page-number>a distinctive line, if the jury concludes there isn\u2019t. That a reasonable person would have to be put on notice that they were crossing a boundary.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b667-4\">\u201cAnd the State is free to argue that a reasonable person coming onto this land at any point, it would be unreasonable for them not to conclude that they are coming onto a distinct \u2014 a piece of land that was separate and distinct from the surrounding or contiguous territory.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b667-5\">\u201cSo the motion for judgment of acquittal is denied.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b667-6\">On appeal, defendants reiterate their arguments that they were entitled to judgments of acquittal. According to defendants, \u201cthe state failed to offer sufficient evidence to prove the land was enclosed for two reasons: (1) the property was not <em>entirely </em>surrounded by boundaries and/or (2) clear-cut lines do not constitute boundaries\u201d for purposes of \u201cenclosing\u201d land.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> (Emphasis added.) The state, for its part, continues to argue that the land on which defendants hunted was \u201cenclosed by a visible and distinct clear-cut line that indicated a separation from the surrounding territory.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b667-7\">The parties\u2019 arguments on appeal frame issues of statutory interpretation. At the onset of our discussion, it is important to note that defendants do not challenge the fact that they knowingly hunted on the land of another. Rather, their argument focuses on a different issue: whether the state proved that the land on which they were hunting was \u201cenclosed\u201d land for purposes of ORS 498.120.</p>\n<p id=\"b668-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"618\">*618</page-number>That question is one of legislative intention\u2014 namely, what the legislature contemplated when it used the word \u201cenclosed\u201d in the statute. As with any issue involving statutory interpretation, our task is to discern the intent of the legislature. We initially seek to determine the intent of the legislature in regard to ORS 498.120 by resorting to an examination of its text and context as well as any helpful legislative history. <em>State v. Gaines, </em>346 Or 160, 171-72, 206 P3d 1042 (2009).</p>\n<p id=\"b668-4\">ORS 498.120 provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b668-5\">\u201c(1) No person shall hunt upon the cultivated or enclosed land of another without first obtaining permission from the owner or lawful occupant thereof, or the agent of such owner or occupant. No prosecution shall be commenced under this section except upon written complaint filed with a magistrate. The complaint shall be verified by the oath of the owner or lawful occupant of the cultivated or enclosed land, or the agent of such owner or occupant.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b668-6\">\u201c(2) For the purpose of subsection (1) of this section, the boundaries of \u2018enclosed\u2019 land may be indicated by wire, ditch, hedge, fence, water or by any visible or distinctive lines that indicate a separation from the surrounding or contiguous territory, and includes the established and posted boundaries of Indian reservations established by treaties of the United States and the various Indian tribes.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b668-7\">The term \u201cenclosed lands\u201d is not expressly defined in ORS 498.120 or in any related statutory provision. However, subsection (2) provides examples of how the boundaries of \u201cenclosed land\u201d for purposes of subsection (1) may be indicated for purposes of the statute. The common requirement among those examples is that the boundaries must be manifested by \u201cany visible or distinctive lines that indicate a separation from the surrounding or contiguous territory[.]\u201d ORS 498.120(2).</p>\n<p id=\"b668-8\">When the legislature has not provided an express definition for a particular term, we generally look to the term\u2019s plain and ordinary meaning. <em>See PGE v. Bureau of Labor and Industries, </em>317 Or 606, 611, 859 P2d 1143 (1993). With respect to ORS 498.120, the statute\u2019s antecedent was enacted in 1921. <em>See </em>General Laws of Oregon, ch 153, \u00a7 31 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"619\">*619</page-number>(1921). Subsection (2) of the statute was added in 1973. <em>See </em>Or Laws 1973, ch 723, \u00a7 83. We initially consider definitions of the term \u201cenclose\u201d from dictionaries that are roughly contemporaneous to the 1921 enactment of what became ORS 498.120. For example, <em>Webster\u2019s New Int\u2019l Dictionary </em>1088 (1910) defines the word \u201cinclose\u201d as \u201c[t]o surround; to encompass; to bound, fence, or hem in on all sides; as, a lake <em>inclosed </em>by hills, a town by walls\u201d and \u201cto fence off or in (common land) in order to appropriate it to individual use.\u201d The same definitions appear in <em>Webster\u2019s New Int\u2019l Dictionary </em>1088 (1926). Those definitions comport with usage from a century earlier and decades later. <em>See, e.g., </em>Noah Webster, 1 <em>An American Dictionary of the English Language </em>107 (1828) (defining \u201cinclose\u201d as \u201c[t]o surround; to shut in; to confine on all sides\u201d and \u201c[t]o separate from the common grounds by a fence; as, to <em>inclose </em>lands\u201d); <em>Black\u2019s Law Dictionary </em>607, 955 (9th ed 2009) (defining \u201cenclose\u201d as \u201cto surround or to encompass; to fence or hem in on all sides\u201d and \u201cenclosed land\u201d as \u201c[l]and that is actually enclosed and surrounded with fences\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b669-4\">The ordinary definitions of \u201cenclosed land\u201d in the statute were expanded by the 1973 amendment to the statute. Although the ordinary definition of \u201cenclosed\u201d might suggest a requirement that, to be enclosed, land must be fenced, subsection (2) of the statute manifests the legislature\u2019s intention that land can become \u201cenclosed\u201d when it is surrounded by types of boundaries other than a fence, including hedges, ditches, or water. Indeed, the statute specifically provides that boundaries may be indicated by <em>\u201cany </em>visible or distinctive line\u201d that shows that the \u201cenclosed land\u201d is separate from the surrounding or contiguous territory. ORS 498.120(2) (emphasis added). Thus, in light of the language of the statute, the question is not whether the land in question is encircled by a boundary line <em>fence </em>but, instead, whether it is surrounded by any kind of visible or distinctive line that demonstrates its separation from contiguous properties.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b669-5\">Here, the state contends that the clear-cut lines on the Davidson property constitute a boundary for purposes of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"620\">*620</page-number>ORS 498.120. We disagree. To be enclosed, the land was required to have a boundary that marked it as separate from \u2014 in other words, not a part of \u2014 the lands surrounding it. Although it is true that land that is clear-cut has different characteristics than land that remains forested, that distinction is not necessarily one that serves to show that the clear-cut land is separate from surrounding property. To be sure, the statute appears to contemplate circumstances where a hunter enters onto the unenclosed land of another without the permission of the owner and then encounters an agricultural area or an area enclosed by visible or distinctive boundary lines marking it as separate. A person who nonetheless enters and hunts on such lands would be subject to the penalties available under the statute. However, subsection (2) requires that the boundary indicators of \u201cenclosed land,\u201d whatever their nature, somehow delineate the confines of that land. Contrary to the state\u2019s contention, in this case, there is no evidence that the clear-cut lines serve that purpose and, for that reason, they cannot constitute a boundary for purposes of the statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b670-4\">In light of the foregoing, as a matter of law, the Davidson property was unenclosed land and the trial court erred in denying defendants\u2019 motion for judgment of acquittal.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b670-5\">Reversed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b665-8\"> Specifically, defendant Berkner was convicted of hunting on the enclosed land of another and multiple counts of aiding or sharing in a wildlife violation. Defendant Kimble was convicted only on counts of aiding or sharing in a wildlife violation. The convictions pursuant to ORS 496.695 were based on defendants having aided or assisted another in violation of ORS 498.120. The validity of those convictions depends on whether ORS 498.120 was violated. Given our resolution of that issue, defendants\u2019 other convictions must also be reversed.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b665-9\"> Defendants further explained:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b665-10\">\u201cThis is not a situation where it is any different from defense standpoint of having a corral for horses, and having two sets of rails or three sets of rails on <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"616\">*616</page-number>one side that are open. It is not enclosed as it is defined unless it is complete. You can\u2019t have three sides to make it enclosed. You can\u2019t have three sides and two feet on the fourth side, if it is a square or a rectangle, and it had \u2014 and it he enclosed. It simply is not enclosed unless it is complete, or at least there is the intent to complete it.\u201d</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b667-8\"> Defendants explain that,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b667-9\">\u201cin order for something to be \u2018enclosed,\u2019 it must he <em>surrounded </em>by something. Under the statute, the land must be <em>surrounded </em>by boundaries. Here, the Davidson tract was not surrounded by boundaries [of trees and vegetation on the Bonneville Power Easement],</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b667-10\">\u201cThe undisputed evidence was that the clearcut lines proffered by the state as constituting the eastern and western boundaries of the Davidson tract were interrupted by two approximately 200 foot sections of trees and vegetation on the Bonneville Power easement. Furthermore, there was an area of the clearing that continued onto United States Forest Service property from the northwest corner of the Davidson property, as well as unlogged areas of land in the southwest and southeast corners of the Davidson property that contained trees and other large vegetation.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b667-11\">(Transcript references omitted; emphasis in original.)</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b669-6\"> For example, \u201cNo Trespassing or Hunting\u201d signs prominently displayed at intervals could operate to delineate an \u201cinvisible\u201d but nevertheless distinctive boundary line in an area where a boundary line fence had not been erected.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b670-6\"><em> In </em>light of that conclusion, we need not reach defendants\u2019 constitutional argument.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
