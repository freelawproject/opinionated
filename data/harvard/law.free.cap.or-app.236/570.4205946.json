During the stop, the deputy developed probable cause to believe that defendant was guilty of driving under the influence of intoxicants (DUII) and driving while his license was revoked. At trial, defendant moved to suppress the evidence discovered during and after the stop, arguing that the stop was unlawful because the statute purportedly authorizing it, ORS 815.025, was unconstitutionally vague. He also argued that, by asking him to take a breath test after he had invoked his right to counsel, the officer violated Article I, section 12, of the Oregon Constitution and the Fifth Amendment to the United States Constitution. The trial court denied defendant\u2019s motion, and he was convicted of DUII after entering a conditional guilty plea and reserving his right to appeal. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b620-4\">The relevant facts are few and undisputed. Columbia County Deputy Ritchie stopped his patrol car at a four-way stop sign shortly after midnight. Defendant drove by the deputy and proceeded through the intersection. The deputy believed that defendant\u2019s truck made \u201cexcessive noise,\u201d as if the truck lacked a muffler or the muffler was disconnected, and decided to pull defendant over for the excessive noise violation.</p>\n<p id=\"b620-5\">After the deputy activated his overhead lights, defendant drove a few hundred feet before pulling over. Defendant briefly attempted to walk away from his truck, but the deputy succeeded in detaining him. When he did so, he noticed that defendant\u2019s eyes were watery and bloodshot, his speech was slurred, and he smelled of alcohol. The deputy asked for identification; defendant responded that he did not have a driver\u2019s license but that he had an identification card in his wallet. A records check disclosed that defendant was on probation, with an alcohol restriction, and that his license was \u201cfelony revoked.\u201d The deputy cited defendant for DUII and driving while revoked.</p>\n<p id=\"b621-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"573\">*573</page-number>After defendant was cited, <em>Mirandized, </em>and taken to the local jail, the deputy asked defendant to complete a field sobriety test. Defendant asked to consult an attorney first. The deputy noted this as a refusal and then asked defendant to submit to a breath test. Again, defendant requested to speak to an attorney. The deputy gave defendant 20 minutes to do so. When defendant could not reach one, he told the deputy to record a refusal. The deputy then contacted defendant\u2019s probation officer, who also asked defendant to take a breath test; defendant again refused to do so without a lawyer. As noted above, defendant at trial sought suppression of \u201call observations of the accused, statements, admissions and/ or confessions * * * and the fruits thereof\u2019 on the grounds that the stop resulted from enforcement of an unconstitutional statute and that the refusals to take field sobriety and breath tests resulted from violation of his right to counsel. Defendant renews those arguments on appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b621-4\">Defendant\u2019s \u201cright to counsel\u201d argument under the United States and Oregon constitutions depends on the proposition that asking a person to take field sobriety or breath tests is \u201cinterrogation.\u201d That argument has been unequivocally rejected, <em>South Dakota v. Neville, </em>459 US 553, 564 n 15, 103 S Ct 916, 74 L Ed 2d 748 (1983); <em>State v. Gardner, </em>236 Or App 150, 155, 236 P3d 742 (2010); <em>State v. Cunningham, </em>179 Or App 498, 502, 40 P3d 535, <em>rev den, </em>334 Or 327 (2002), and we reject it again with no further discussion.</p>\n<p id=\"b621-5\">Defendant\u2019s \u201cvoid for vagueness\u201d argument focuses on the phrase \u201cgreater noise * * * than is reasonably necessary for the proper operation of the vehicle.\u201d ORS 815.025(1). Under the Oregon Constitution,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b621-6\">\u201c[t]he terms of a criminal statute must be sufficiently explicit to inform those who are subject to it of what conduct on their part will render them liable to its penalties. In addition to its function of giving fair notice of the forbidden conduct, criminal statute must not be so vague as to permit a judge or jury to exercise uncontrolled discretion in punishing defendants, because this offends the principle against <em>ex post facto </em>laws embodied in Article I, section 21, of the Oregon Constitution. The equal privileges and immunities clause is also implicated when vague laws give unbridled discretion to judges and jurors to decide what is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"574\">*574</page-number>prohibited in a given case, for this results in the unequal application of criminal laws. A criminal statute need not define an offense with such precision <em>that a </em>person in every case can determine in advance that a specific conduct will be within the statute\u2019s reach. However, a reasonable degree of certainty is required by Article I, sections 20 and 21.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b622-4\"><em>State v. Graves, 299 </em>Or 189, 195, 700 P2d 244 (1985) (citations and footnote omitted). Under the Due Process Clause of the United States Constitution, a statute is unconstitutionally vague \u201cif it either contains no identifiable standard, <em>Kolender v. Lawson, </em>461 US 352, 358, 103 S Ct 1855, 75 L Ed 2d 903 (1983), or employs a standard that relies on the shifting and subjective judgments of the persons who are charged with enforcing it, <em>City of Chicago v. Morales, </em>527 US 41, 62, 119 S Ct 1849, 144 L Ed 2d 67 (1999).\u201d <em>State v. Illig-Renn, </em>341 Or 228, 240, 142 P3d 62 (2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b622-5\">The state contends that this case cannot meaningfully be distinguished from <em>State v. Marker, </em>21 Or App 671, 536 P2d 1273 (1975). In that case, this court confronted a vagueness challenge to the phrase \u201cunreasonable noise\u201d in ORS 166.025(l)(b), a \u201cdisorderly conduct\u201d statute. After surveying case law from other jurisdictions and noting our obligation to uphold statutes if possible, <em>Marker, </em>21 Or App at 673, we concluded</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b622-6\">\u201cthat the action element of ORS 166.025(l)(b) [including the term \u2018unreasonable noise\u2019] is described with words of common usage with a well defined, well understood and generally accepted meaning, and, as written, enables [persons] of common intelligence to understand what conduct is prohibited. We are satisfied that the language of ORS 166.025(l)(b) is not vague, and that it contains the requisite specificity for a penal statute.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b622-7\"><em>Id. </em>at 677. Defendant argues that <em>Marker </em>is distinguishable because the disorderly conduct statute in that case contained a <em>mens rea </em>requirement (\u201cintent to cause public inconvenience, annoyance or alarm, or recklessly creating a risk thereof\u2019). <em>Marker, </em>however, separately analyzed each phrase of the statute, and the analysis of \u201creasonable noise\u201d was not conditioned on the existence of a <em>mens rea </em>element \u2014 nor can we discern how the existence or nonexistence of such an element is relevant to a vagueness challenge.</p>\n<p id=\"b623-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"575\">*575</page-number>The disorderly conduct statute, however, is not the excessive motor vehicle noise statute, nor is the phrasing in the former (\u201cunreasonable noise\u201d) identical to the phrasing in the latter (\u201cgreater noise * * * than is reasonably necessary\u201d). Technically, therefore, the analysis in <em>Marker </em>does not necessarily carry over to the analysis in this case. However, we need not decide whether it does or not. That is so because, even if ORS 815.025(1) is unconstitutionally vague, and even if a stop based on an unconstitutionally vague statute entitles a defendant to a suppression remedy \u2014 an issue that we do not address \u2014 the court\u2019s ruling was correct on a different basis. The court was \u201cright for the wrong reason.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b623-4\">Under <em>Outdoor Media Dimensions Inc. v. State of Oregon, </em>331 Or 634, 659-60, 20 P3d 180 (2001), we may affirm the trial court when</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b623-5\">\u201c(1) * * * the facts of record [are] sufficient to support the alternative basis for affirmance; (2) * * * the trial court\u2019s ruling [is] consistent with the view of the evidence under the alternative basis for affirmance; and (3) * * * the record materially [is] the same one that would have been developed had the prevailing party raised the alternative basis for affirmance below.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b623-6\">Further, a stop is lawful even if the officer who executes it does so under the mistaken belief that the defendant has violated one law if the facts that the officer perceives amount to a violation of a different law. \u201c[P]robable cause may be based on a mistake as to <em>which </em>law the defendant violated. * * * [T]he facts that the officer perceives to exist must establish the elements of <em>an </em>offense, even if not the offense that the officer believed the defendant committed.\u201d <em>State v. Boatright, </em>222 Or App 406, 410, 193 P3d 78, <em>rev den, </em>345 Or 503 (2008) (emphasis in original). ORS 815.250(1) creates the offense of \u201cOperation without proper exhaust system.\u201d An exhaust system is proper only if, among other things, it is \u201cin good working order.\u201d ORS 815.250(2)(a). In this case, the following colloquy occurred:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b623-7\">\u201cQ [by prosecutor]: Okay. Could you describe how you came about seeing the defendant at that time?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b623-8\">\u201cA [by Deputy Ritchie]: I was on patrol at the intersection of Holbrook Road and Walker Road. That\u2019s a four-way <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"576\">*576</page-number>intersection. While at the stop sign the defendant came up behind me in a white Ford pickup. I allowed the pickup to go by and as he did I noticed excessive noise coming from the motor. <em>Sounded like an engine with no muffler or one disconnected. Decided to stop the vehicle </em>and proceeded up Walker Road.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b624-4\">\u201cQ: Okay. Are you familiar with the operation of a muffler such as [sic] a Ford pickup?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b624-6\">\u201cA: I\u2019m not a mechanic but I know they have to have one.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b624-7\">\u201cQ: Okay. And are you familiar with the sound that a pickup in general makes to operate properly?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b624-9\">\u201cA: Yes. I own one.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b624-10\">\u201cQ: Okay. And what was it about the pickup that night that caught your attention noise-wise?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b624-11\">\u201cA: It wasn\u2019t \u2014 it wasn\u2019t the normal reasonableness [sic] noise you would hear from a Ford pickup. <em>Sounded like either the muffler or muffler system was disconnected from the motor, </em>extremely loud and ratchety, not smooth and muffled sounding.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b624-12\">(Emphasis added.) Clearly, this testimony demonstrates that the deputy subjectively believed that defendant was driving a vehicle in violation of ORS 815.250(1). The evidence also demonstrates that his belief was objectively reasonable. The only testimony about the sound level of the truck from somebody other than the deputy came from defendant\u2019s father, the vehicle\u2019s owner. And although he testified that, to the best of his knowledge there was nothing wrong with the exhaust system, he also testified that the vehicle was 20 years old, that he used it as a \u201c[w]ork truck basically,\u201d that it \u201cmakes a little bit more\u201d noise when started up than a new car would because \u201cthey just do after 20 years or so.\u201d He acknowledged that the truck made \u201ca little throaty grumbling noise with the exhaust.\u201d That testimony may or may not have been sufficient to convict defendant of violating ORS 815.250(1), but it certainly is enough to provide an objective basis for the deputy\u2019s belief that the exhaust was not \u201cin good working order.\u201d Further, we cannot discern how the record would have developed differently if the motion to suppress had been based on the argument that the deputy lacked probable cause to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"577\">*577</page-number>believe that defendant violated ORS 815.250(1). Thus, regardless of whether ORS 815.025 is unconstitutionally vague, the stop was lawful and the court correctly denied defendant\u2019s motion to suppress.</p>\n<p id=\"b625-4\">Affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
