The dis-positive issue is whether the court had authority to dismiss this case as a sanction for the state\u2019s lack of readiness to proceed to trial against defendant in a different case because the attendance of one of its witnesses in that case was not procured. Because the trial court lacked authority to dismiss this case for that reason, we reverse and remand.</p>\n<p id=\"b676-5\">While this case was pending before the trial court, defendant was the subject of another criminal prosecution in the same trial court involving several theft-related charges (the theft case). The theft case was set for trial on December 12, 2007. On that day, the state moved to postpone the trial because it had learned that one of its witnesses, a police officer who recently had moved to another state, was unavailable. The court deferred its consideration of the motion until the next day, because it wanted to determine whether the witness was able and willing to return to Oregon to testify on a later date. At the hearing on December 13, the state advised the court that the witness was willing to return to Oregon to testify and asked that the case be continued. Defendant sought dismissal of the theft case without prejudice on the grounds that the state had failed to act diligently to procure the attendance of the witness, and any further delay would prejudice defendant and his own witnesses. The state asked the court not to dismiss the theft case, because dismissal would punish the victim, defendant had previously obtained trial setovers in the case, and the state would simply reprosecute defendant if the case were dismissed without prejudice. The court granted the motion to postpone but, as a sanction for the state\u2019s lack of readiness to proceed in the theft case, the court dismissed this case with prejudice.</p>\n<p id=\"b676-6\">The court explained:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b676-7\">\u201cI think there needs to be some sort of an equitable remedy here, because I think this \u2014 it is an unusual set of circumstances. This doesn\u2019t fit the normal model. And I do think the defense is entitled to a remedy, but one that is consistent with the nature of the problems in this case.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b677-2\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"627\">*627</page-number>\u201cAnd this is what I\u2019m going to do. I\u2019m going to grant the State setover, over the defense objection. However, I\u2019m going to dismiss, as a sanction for what I think is an error on * * * the State\u2019s part, [the instant case]. That case is going to be dismissed.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b677-3\">The following colloquy ensued:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b677-4\">\u201c[THE PROSECUTOR]: Well, Judge, since that\u2019s not something I ever anticipated and wasn\u2019t part of the defense argument, so I didn\u2019t\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b677-5\">\u201cTHE COURT: Right. The alternative is to dismiss [the theft case], which was one of the things I was considering. And I\u2019m instead taking into account that one has a victim named with circumstances and they\u2019re special, and the other does not.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b677-6\">\u201c[THE PROSECUTOR]: But, Judge, there\u2019s no reason to dismiss [the instant case].</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b677-7\">\u201cTHE COURT: Except as a lesser, in my view, remedy for \u2014 that is more appropriate under the circumstances, taking into account there\u2019s a victim in [the theft case]. Otherwise, I would dismiss this one. So if you disagree, we\u2019ll switch it.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b677-8\">\u201c[THE PROSECUTOR]: No. Obviously, I don\u2019t want that, Judge, but\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b677-9\">\u201cTHE COURT: I appreciate, you don\u2019t see the logic.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b677-10\">\u201c[THE PROSECUTOR]: I don\u2019t see the logic or even the legal authority.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b677-11\">\u201cTHE COURT: It\u2019s a condition of doing something less than \u2014 you don\u2019t have to accept it. But then the alternative is the other. So\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b677-12\">\u201c[THE PROSECUTOR]: Judge, I\u2019m just a lawyer.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b677-13\">\u201cTHE COURT: Right.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b677-14\">\u201c[THE PROSECUTOR]: You\u2019re the judge, obviously.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b677-15\">\u201cTHE COURT: So I\u2019m going to go ahead and implement that ruling.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b677-16\">\u201c[THE PROSECUTOR]: And that\u2019s dismissed without prejudice; is that correct?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b678-2\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"628\">*628</page-number>\u201cTHE COURT: No. It\u2019s a sanction. It\u2019s dismissed with prejudice.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b678-3\">Although this case had not been called for trial, the court then entered a judgment dismissing this case with prejudice. On appeal, the state asserts that the trial court lacked a lawful basis for its action. We agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b678-4\">Dismissal based on the state\u2019s lack of readiness for trial in a criminal case is governed by ORS 136.120, which provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b678-5\">\u201cIf, when the case is called for trial, the defendant appears for trial and the district attorney is not ready and does not show any sufficient cause for postponing the trial, the court shall order the accusatory instrument to be dismissed, unless, being of the opinion that the public interests require the accusatory instrument to be retained for trial, the court directs it to be retained.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b678-6\">ORS 136.130 addresses the effect of a dismissal under ORS 136.120. <em>State v. Sondenna, </em>222 Or 506, 509 n 3, 194 P3d 817 (2008). ORS 136.130 provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b678-7\">\u201cIf the court orders the accusatory instrument to be dismissed and the instrument charges a felony or Class A misdemeanor, the order is not a bar to another action for the same crime unless the court so directs. If the court does so direct, judgment of acquittal shall be entered. If the accusatory instrument charges an offense other than a felony or Class A misdemeanor, the order of dismissal shall be a bar to another action for the same offense.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b678-8\">In a felony case, dismissal of an accusatory instrument with prejudice under ORS 136.120 and ORS 136.130 is authorized only after the court has considered and weighed three criteria. The first criterion, whether there is \u201csufficient cause for postponement of the trial,\u201d is determined by considering the \u201creasons for seeking the postponement\u201d and whether \u201cthe prosecutor\u2019s conduct constitute[d] inexcusable neglect.\u201d <em>State v. Parliament, </em>164 Or App 707, 712, 995 P2d 544 (2000). The second criterion, whether \u201cthe public interests require the accusatory instrument to be retained for trial\u201d is assessed in light of the \u201cmagnitude of the interests at stake.\u201d <em>Id. </em>The third criterion concerns \u201cwhether the defendant would suffer <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"629\">*629</page-number>actual prejudice or whether the defendant\u2019s right to a speedy trial would be compromised.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b679-4\"> For three reasons, we conclude that the trial court erred in dismissing this case with prejudice based on the state\u2019s conduct in the theft case. First, this case had not been \u201ccalled for trial\u201d when the trial court entered the judgment dismissing it. Thus, a statutory prerequisite for the exercise of the court\u2019s authority to dismiss this case under ORS 136.120 had not been satisfied. Second, and moreover, none of the factual predicates for a dismissal of this case <em>with prejudice </em>was shown on the record. <em>Parliament, </em>164 Or App at 712. Finally, defendant posits no authority for the proposition that, based on the state\u2019s conduct in another case, the trial court had discretionary or equitable authority to dismiss this case in the absence of a statutory basis for dismissal, and we are aware of no such authority.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Accordingly, we reverse and remand.</p>\n<p id=\"b679-5\">Reversed and remanded.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b679-6\"> We summarily reject defendant\u2019s assertion that the state invited the court\u2019s error by \u201celecting\u201d the dismissal of this case rather than the theft case. The record set out above shows that the state objected to the dismissal of both cases.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
