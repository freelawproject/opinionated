According to the trial court, defendant\u2019s statements were inadmissible because police officers did not give her <em>Miranda </em>warnings. The state appeals. ORS 138.060(l)(c). Defendant cross-appeals, arguing that police did not have probable cause to arrest her. We reverse and remand on appeal and affirm on cross-appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b182-4\">The facts are not in dispute. Officer May, on patrol near Prineville, received a report from a citizen complainant who indicated that a white Ford pickup truck was swerving in its lane and repeatedly activating its left turn signal without ever turning. May intercepted the truck and began following it. He saw it weaving within the lane, then crossing over the fog line, and then correcting sharply. This particularly concerned May because the roads were icy.</p>\n<p id=\"b182-5\">May turned on his overhead lights and defendant pulled to the side of the road, then drove over 400 feet before coming to a stop. May approached her truck, explained to defendant why she had been pulled over, and asked for her license, registration, and proof of insurance. Defendant appeared confused during the encounter, and initially tried to give May her checkbook instead of her identification. He noticed that her eyes were glassy, her pupils were dilated and nonreactive to light, and her speech was choppy and non-responsive. May ultimately obtained defendant\u2019s name and date of birth, instead of her identification, and returned to his car to run a record check on her. It came back clear.</p>\n<p id=\"b182-6\">When May returned to defendant\u2019s truck, he asked her to perform field sobriety tests. She refused. After May told her the consequences of a refusal and renewed his request, she refused again. May then arrested her for DUII, ORS 813.010, and took her to the local jail. When they arrived there, May \u2014 without giving defendant <em>Miranda </em>warnings \u2014 asked her if she would take a breath test and advised her of her right to refuse. Defendant asked May to explain what would happen if she refused, and he told her <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"153\">*153</page-number>that a refusal could subject her to suspension of her license. She then asked what would happen if she was found guilty of DUII. He replied that there were different outcomes and options but that he could not tell her what the best choice was. Defendant repeated her questions two or three times before May directly asked her if she would consent to the test \u201cright now.\u201d Defendant responded, \u201cI am afraid I will fail because I drank two glasses of wine, so I am going to refuse.\u201d Defendant was then cited for DUII.</p>\n<p id=\"b183-4\">At trial, defendant filed a motion to suppress her refusal and statement, arguing that she was arrested without probable cause and that May failed to give her <em>Miranda </em>warnings before asking her to take the breath test. The trial court rejected the probable cause argument but agreed with defendant regarding her statements in response to May\u2019s question about the breath test. The court found that,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b183-5\">\u201calthough her response very well might not be a part of a specific question other than, will you take the Intoxilyzer; the burden is on the State to prove that the statement made by [defendant] was voluntary. There is no question that she was currently in custody and under arrest for Driving Under the Influence of Intoxicants. She was asked on several occasions by [May] whether or not she would take the [breath test]. * * * The Court finds that the State has not proven that the admission made of drinking two glasses of wine was made voluntarily and orders that the admission be suppressed.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b183-6\">The state appeals the trial court\u2019s ruling suppressing defendant\u2019s statements, and defendant cross-appeals the court\u2019s ruling on probable cause.</p>\n<p id=\"b183-7\">We reject defendant\u2019s cross-appeal. Defendant\u2019s erratic driving, evident confusion, and physical symptoms described above are more than adequate to create probable cause to believe she was driving while intoxicated.</p>\n<p id=\"b183-8\">Although the court\u2019s ruling suppressing defendant\u2019s statements is worded in terms of voluntariness, the court ruled in response to defendant\u2019s argument based on failure to administer <em>Miranda </em>warnings. The two inquiries \u2014 whether defendant\u2019s statement was voluntary and whether she received <em>Miranda </em>warnings \u2014 are not necessarily the same. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"154\">*154</page-number>Involuntary or coerced statements that result from custodial interrogation are inadmissible. A statement may be involuntary because a defendant\u2019s will is overborne or, presumptively, because the defendant did not receive <em>Miranda </em>warnings. <em>State v. Vu, </em>307 Or 419, 424-25, 770 P2d 577 (1989). In the present case, defendant\u2019s only argument on appeal is that she had a right to <em>Miranda </em>warnings and, because the state violated that right, her subsequent statements were presumptively involuntary and were therefore correctly suppressed. She does not argue that her will was overborne by coercion.</p>\n<p id=\"b184-4\">As a general rule, officers are required to give suspects <em>Miranda </em>warnings when they are subject to custodial interrogation. <em>Miranda v. Arizona, </em>384 US 436, 86 S Ct 1602, 16 L Ed 2d 694 (1966); <em>State v. Fish, </em>321 Or 48, 84, 893 P2d 1023 (1995) (Graber, J., concurring in part and dissenting in part). In this case, there is no dispute that defendant was in custody for the purposes of <em>Miranda </em>when May asked her to take the breath test. The only issue is whether the officer\u2019s request constituted an \u201cinterrogation.\u201d That issue arises with respect to two aspects of defendant\u2019s response to the request: her statement that she had consumed two glasses of wine and her statement that she would not take the breath test.</p>\n<p id=\"b184-5\">Oregon has adopted, for the purposes of Article I, section 12, of the Oregon Constitution the definition of interrogation set out in <em>Rhode Island v. Innis, 446 US </em>291, 100 S Ct 1682, 64 L Ed 2d 297 (1980). <em>See State v. Bradbury, </em>80 Or App 613, 616, 723 P2d 1051, <em>rev den, </em>302 Or 342 (1986) (adopting Innis\u2019s definition of interrogation). Under that definition,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b184-6\">\u201cthe term \u2018interrogation\u2019 under <em>Miranda </em>refers not only to express questioning, but also to any words or actions on the part of the police (other than those normally attendant to arrest and custody) that the police should know are reasonably likely to elicit an incriminating response from the suspect.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b184-7\"><em>Innis, 446 </em>US at 301 (footnote omitted). Thus, some questions are not \u201cinterrogation\u201d (questions normally attendant to arrest and custody) and some nonquestions are (statements <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"155\">*155</page-number>that police should know are reasonably likely to elicit an incriminating response).</p>\n<p id=\"b185-4\">In <em>State v. Cunningham, </em>179 Or App 498, 502, 40 P3d 535, <em>rev den, </em>334 Or 327 (2002), we implicitly adopted the United States Supreme Court\u2019s explanation of what questions are \u201cnormally attendant to arrest and custody.\u201d In <em>South Dakota v. Neville, </em>459 US 553, 564 n 15, 103 S Ct 916, 74 L Ed 2d 748 (1983), the Court explained that a \u201cpolice inquiry of whether the suspect will take a blood-alcohol test is not an interrogation within the meaning of Miranda\u201d because it is a question \u201cnormally attendant to arrest and custody.\u201d The Court reasoned that the question came within the exception because it was highly regulated by state law and presented in virtually the same words to all suspects. <em>Id. </em>Thus, even if we were to conclude that the officer\u2019s question asking whether defendant would take the breath test was intended and likely to elicit an incriminating statement\u2014 ORS 813.095(1) creates the offense of refusing to take a breath test \u2014 the question is not \u201cinterrogation\u201d for purposes of <em>Miranda </em>because it is part of the normal process of arrest and custody.</p>\n<p id=\"b185-5\">Defendant argues that, because May\u2019s colloquy went beyond what is normally presented to other suspects,\u201d the encounter differed significantly from that which is \u201cnormally attendant to arrest and custody.\u201d We disagree. Nothing requires a police officer to read a warning verbatim. ORS 813.100, the implied consent law, is designed to overcome the possibility of physical resistance of a suspected driver, despite legal consent, without resorting to physical compulsion by imposing adverse legal consequences on a refusal to submit to the test. <em>State v. Spencer, </em>305 Or 59, 71, 750 P2d 147 (1988). In this case, due to defendant\u2019s confusion\u2014 evidenced by her inability to locate her identification, trying to give the officer her checkbook, and choppy, nonresponsive interaction with the officer \u2014 it was reasonable for May to engage her in colloquy in order to ensure that she understood the consequences of a refusal. We conclude that the court erred in suppressing evidence of defendant\u2019s refusal to submit to the breath test.</p>\n<p id=\"b186-2\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"156\">*156</page-number>We reach a similar conclusion with respect to her statement that she had consumed two drinks. Nothing in May\u2019s conversation with defendant could be regarded as likely to elicit that statement. \u201c[S]ince the police surely cannot be held accountable for the unforeseeable results of their words or actions, the definition of interrogation can extend only to words or actions on the part of police officers that they <em>should have known </em>were reasonably likely to elicit an incriminating response.\u201d <em>Innis, </em>446 US at 301-02 (emphasis in original) (footnote omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b186-3\">To summarize: Defendant\u2019s statement that she would not take the breath test was not a response to \u201cinterrogation\u201d for purposes of <em>Miranda </em>because the question that elicited the response was part of the normal arrest and booking procedures. Her statement that she had consumed two drinks was not a response to \u201cinterrogation\u201d for purposes of <em>Miranda </em>because the question that elicited that response was not a question that the police officer should have known would elicit that response. The trial court therefore erred in suppressing the statements.</p>\n<p id=\"b186-4\">On appeal, reversed and remanded; on cross-appeal, affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
