J.</author>\n<p id=\"b584-4\">The Three Affiliated Tribes of Fort Berthold Reservation (the tribes) appeal a judgment in which the trial court concluded that \u201cgood cause\u201d under the Indian Child Welfare Act (ICWA) existed to designate the adoptive placement for two Indian children as the home of their current foster parents rather than the home designated by the tribes. On appeal, the legal issue is whether \u201cgood cause\u201d exists to depart from ICWA\u2019s placement preferences. 25 USC \u00a7 1915(a).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> As we will explain, we are bound by the trial court\u2019s findings of fact if there is any evidence in the record to support them, but independently assess whether those findings are sufficient to support the trial court\u2019s legal conclusion that \u201cgood cause\u201d exists under the circumstances of this case. Applying that standard, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b584-5\">Before turning to the facts of this case, we begin by identifying the appropriate standard of review. Historically, pursuant to ORS 19.415(3) (2007) and ORS 419A.200(6) (2007), in juvenile cases such as this one, we reviewed the facts <em>de novo </em><footnotemark><em>2</em></footnotemark><em> </em>In other words, we \u201cindependently assess[ed] and evaluate[d] the evidence,\u201d <em>State ex rel SOSCF v. Frazier, </em>152 Or App 568, 572, 955 P2d 272, <em>rev den, </em>327 Or 305 (1998), and \u201creweigh[ed] the facts and reassess[ed] the persuasive force of the evidence,\u201d <em>Marvin Wood Products v. Callow, </em>171 Or App 175, 180, 14 P3d 686 (2000). In 2009, however, the legislature amended ORS 19.415(3) to change our standard of review.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b585-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"539\">*539</page-number>Specifically, ORS 19.415(3) now provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b585-4\">\u201cUpon an appeal in an equitable action or proceeding, review by the Court of Appeals shall be as follows:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b585-5\">\u201c(a) Upon an appeal from a judgment in a proceeding for the termination of parental rights, the Court of Appeals shall try the cause anew upon the record; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b585-6\">\u201c(b) Upon an appeal in an equitable action or proceeding other than an appeal from a judgment in a proceeding for the termination of parental rights, the Court of Appeals, acting in its sole discretion, may try the cause anew upon the record or make one or more factual findings anew upon the record.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b585-7\">Pursuant to ORS 19.415(3)(b), because this case does not concern the termination of parental rights, we need not review <em>de novo </em>but have discretion to do so.</p>\n<p id=\"b585-8\">Our decision whether to exercise that discretion is governed by a temporary amendment to ORAP 5.40 that is embodied in Chief Judge Order 09-06.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Specifically, ORAP 5.40 provides, in part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b585-9\">\u201cThe appellant\u2019s opening brief shall open with a clear and concise statement of the case, which shall set forth in the following order under separate headings:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b585-10\">* * * sfi</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b585-11\">\u201c(8)(a) In those proceedings in which the Court of Appeals has discretion to try the cause anew on the record and the appellant seeks to have the court exercise that discretion, the appellant shall concisely state the reasons why the court should do so.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b585-12\">\u201c(b) In those proceedings in which the Court of Appeals has discretion to make one or more factual findings anew on the record and the appellant seeks to have the court exercise that discretion, the appellant shall identify with particularity the factual findings that the appellant <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"540\">*540</page-number>seeks to have the court find anew on the record and shall concisely state the reasons why the court should do so.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b586-4\">\u201c(c) The Court of Appeals will exercise its discretion to try the cause anew on the record or to make one or more factual findings anew on the record only in exceptional cases. Consistently with that presumption against the exercise of discretion, requests under paragraph (a) or (b) of this section are disfavored.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b586-5\">(Footnote omitted.)</p>\n<p id=\"b586-6\">To summarize, ORAP 5.40(8)(a) and (b) require that, if an appellant seeks to have us exercise our discretion to review <em>de novo, </em>the appellant must include a concise statement explaining the reasons why we should do so in its statement of the case in the opening brief. In the face of such a request, our decision whether to exercise discretion is guided by the nonexclusive list of considerations stated in ORAP 5.40(8)(d).<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> However, a presumption exists \u201cagainst the exercise of discretion\u201d and we will exercise it \u201conly in exceptional cases.\u201d ORAP 5.40(8)(c).</p>\n<p id=\"b587-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"541\">*541</page-number>In its opening brief in this case, the tribes appear to have assumed that, as had been the case historically, our review is <em>de novo. </em>In their brief, the tribes do not acknowledge the 2009 amendments to ORS 19.415 and, contrary to the requirements of ORAP 5.40(8)(a), do not request that we exercise our discretion to review <em>de novo </em>or explain the reasons that we should do so. In the absence of such a request and in light of the \u201cpresumption against the exercise of discretion,\u201d ORAP 5.40(8)(c), we decline, under the circumstance of this case, to exercise our discretion under ORS 19.415(3)(b) to review <em>de novo.</em><footnotemark><em>6</em></footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b587-4\">Consequently, our standard of review in this case is governed by ORS 19.415(1), which provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b587-5\">\u201c[U]pon an appeal in an action or proceeding, without regard to whether the action or proceeding was triable to the court or a jury, the scope of review shall be as provided in section 3, Article VII (Amended) of the Oregon Constitution.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b587-6\">Stated differently, \u201c[o]ur review * * * is limited to examining the record to determine if there is any evidence to support the trial court\u2019s factual findings.\u201d <em>G. I. Joe\u2019s, Inc. v. Nizam, </em>183 Or App 116, 123, 50 P3d 1282 (2002).</p>\n<p id=\"b588-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"542\">*542</page-number>Here, our review of the record confirms that we are bound by the relevant trial court findings, because they are supported by evidence in the record. Accordingly, we state the facts consistently with those findings and augment them where necessary with uncontroverted background and procedural facts.</p>\n<p id=\"b588-4\">Mother and father moved to The Dalles from Pierre, South Dakota, in 2006 when their daughter, K, was a few months old and mother was pregnant with their son, I.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> In December 2006,1 was born. Shortly after I\u2019s birth, he and K were placed in foster parents\u2019 home, where they have lived ever since.</p>\n<p id=\"b588-5\">In July 2008, mother\u2019s and father\u2019s parental rights were terminated. Father stipulated to the termination of his parental rights. We affirmed the judgment that terminated mother\u2019s rights without opinion in May 2009.</p>\n<p id=\"b588-6\">During the course of this ongoing dependency proceeding, two significant events occurred. First, mother became an enrolled member of the tribes. As a result, the children became eligible for membership under the tribes\u2019 rules and were considered Indian children under ICWA.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> Second, a couple (grandparents) who lived in Pierre, and had been mother\u2019s guardians when she was a child, adopted her as an adult \u2014 and, consequently, became the children\u2019s grandparents. The tribes, consistently with their law and customs, considered grandparents to be \u201cextended family members\u201d for purposes of ICWA\u2019s placement preferences.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b589-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"543\">*543</page-number>Foster parents want to adopt the children \u2014 and so do grandparents. Neither foster parents nor grandparents are \u201cIndian.\u201d<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> The tribes seek to have grandparents designated as the children\u2019s adoptive placement in accordance with ICWA\u2019s placement preferences, which provide, in part, that \u201cpreference shall be given, <em>in the absence of good cause to the contrary, </em>to a placement with * * * a member of the child\u2019s extended family[.]\u201d 25 USC \u00a7 1915(a) (emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b589-4\">As noted by the trial court in its detailed letter opinion, foster parents\u2019 home and grandparents\u2019 home \u201chave some similarities.\u201d For example, \u201c[b]oth are experienced foster homes,\u201d and both have previously adopted children, including children of Native American heritage.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> However, as the trial court noted,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b589-5\">\u201c[t]he two homes also have distinctions.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b589-6\">\u201cThere are no children presently in [grandparents\u2019] home. However, [grandparents] have an ongoing relationship with [mother], who has returned to Pierre. She visits them, and brings her new son to visit. She uses a day care facility on their property * * *. [Grandparents] also have ongoing relationships with other members of [mother\u2019s] biological family. The members of [mother\u2019s] biological family described by [grandmother] suffer from similar problems of addiction, criminality, unemployment, homelessness, and under-education that have plagued [mother]. [Grandparents] intend [the children] to have ongoing relationships with [mother], her new son, and [mother\u2019s] biological family, if they deem it \u2018safe.\u2019</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b589-7\">\u201c[Foster parents\u2019] home is probably the only home [K] remembers, and is the only home [I] has ever known. It is decorated with Indian art. [Foster parents] have taken their children, including [K] and [I] to local Indian festivals, and have contacted a local Indian woman to help [K] and [I] understand their Indian heritage. They intend to travel to the Tribes\u2019 reservation to help [K] and [I] understand their specific cultural heritage.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b590-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"544\">*544</page-number>\u201c[K] is now an apparently untroubled little girl, although her life was disrupted when her parents\u2019 behavior made it necessary to first place her in foster care. [I] is delayed in receptive language, and to a greater degree, expressive language. He suffers from a swallowing disorder. * * * [Foster parents] have taken him to specialists, and work regularly with him on his language skills. [K] often acts as his interpreter, and as his boss. Both children are bonded to [foster parents] as their father and mother. Despite his delays, [I] calls them \u2018dada\u2019 and \u2018momma.\u2019 [Grandparents] have spent no more than a few hours in [K\u2019s] presence since [her parents] brought her to The Dalles, and no more than a few hours with [I] in his lifetime.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b590-4\">\u201c[Foster parents] and the Tribes have intervened in [K\u2019s] and [I\u2019s] dependency cases, making them parties to those cases. [Grandparents] have not intervened, but [grandmother has] \u2018rights of limited participation.\u2019 The State filed a motion for a review hearing \u2018* * * to address * * * placement of the children, including ICWA issues * * *.\u2019 The motion [raised] the present issue, whether there is good cause to place the children in an adoptive home, [foster parents\u2019] home, that is not [ICWA\u2019s] preferred home nor the Tribes\u2019 preferred home of extended family. The State proposes to place [the children] in [grandparents\u2019] home.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b590-7\">\u201cSeveral experts testified at the hearings on the State\u2019s motion, regarding the risks and benefits of adoption in either home. Ms. Strickland is a clinical social worker who evaluated [the children] * * *. Ms. Smutz is [the children\u2019s] DHS caseworker. Mr. St. Martin is the social services director for the Yurok Tribe of Northern California. Ms. Felix is the Tribes\u2019 ICWA representative. Generally, I found Ms. Strickland and Ms. Smutz credible regarding [the children], and the effect on them of moving them from [foster parents\u2019] home. I also found Mr. St. Martin and Ms. Felix credible regarding the more general effect on Indian children of being isolated from their Indian culture.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b590-8\">\u201cAlthough the experts disagreed about where [the children] should be placed, they agreed on two major points. [The children] will be harmed by a move, and it is important that they grow up aware of their own tribal culture. I accept both propositions. <em>I also accept Ms. Strickland\u2019s testimony that the harm to [the children] will be serious and lasting, if they are moved from [foster parents\u2019] home.\u201d</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b591-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"545\">*545</page-number>(Brackets in original omitted; third and fourth omissions in original; emphasis added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b591-4\">In light of those findings, the court ultimately reasoned that foster parents had demonstrated that \u201cgood cause\u201d existed to depart from ICWA\u2019s placement preferences. Specifically, the court stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b591-5\">\u201cIf the Indian Child Welfare Act did not apply to the present case, [K] and [I\u2019s] adoptive placement would be a simple issue. \u2018The primary purpose of adoption proceedings is the promotion and protection of a child\u2019s best interests.\u2019 <em>P and P [v.] Children\u2019s Services Division, </em>66 Or App 66, 72[, 673 P2d 864] (1983). [K] has been in [foster parents\u2019] home almost all of her life. [I] has been in [foster parents\u2019] home all of his life. From their perspective as children, [foster parents] are their mother and father: the people they know to love, nurture and protect them. [Foster parents] meet [I\u2019s] special needs. [Foster parents] will raise [K] and [I] in a multi-racial home, connect them to local Indian culture, and take them to the Tribes\u2019 reservation to learn of their specific tribal culture, achieving each of the goals the various experts testified are important for [K\u2019s] and [I\u2019s] well being. It would serve no purpose, and certainly would not be in [K\u2019s] and [I\u2019s] best interests, to take them from their good home with the hope that another will be better. * * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b591-7\">\u201cSince the Act does apply to the present case, I must also examine the suitability of [grandparents\u2019] home as a placement for [K] and [I]. I am sure it is a home with many virtues. However, * * * [i]t is a home in which [mother] * * * claimed to have been sexually abused. * * * It is a home in which [K] and [I] will be exposed to biological family, a circumstance which Ms. Strickland credibly testified will damage [K], It is also a home in which [I\u2019s] special needs may or may not be met. * * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b591-8\">\u201c* * * [T]he right placement of these children is a question of balancing degrees of harm against degrees of benefit. When I balance those, I conclude that the harm to these children in removing them from their home outweighs any other consideration by a degree of magnitude.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b591-9\">Ultimately, the court entered a judgment in which it concluded that \u201cgood cause exists to place the * * * children in an adoptive home that is contrary to the home designated by the [tribes].\u201d The tribes appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b592-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"546\">*546</page-number>On appeal, the tribes contend that the trial court erred in determining that good cause existed to deviate from ICWA\u2019s placement preferences. The tribes\u2019 position is based on their understanding that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b592-4\">\u201cthe intent of [ICWA\u2019s] placement provisions * * * are to whenever possible place Indian children within their tribal community and extended family by establishing placement preferences and requiring state court and state child protective agencies to follow an Indian Tribe\u2019s placement preference for tribal children in the absence of a finding of good cause to the contrary.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b592-5\">Specifically, the tribes assert that the trial court\u2019s decision contravened the intent underlying ICWA\u2019s placement provisions in two ways. First, the tribes contend that the court misunderstood its role in examining the suitability of grandparents\u2019 home and used that consideration \u201cto justify comparison of the two homes based on subjective factors that were culturally biased\u201d and \u201cto substitute [its] judgment * * * for that of the * * * professional determination of the suitability of [grandparents\u2019] home\u201d that was made by the tribes as well as the states of Oregon and South Dakota. Second, we understand the tribes to contend that the trial court\u2019s determination that it was in the children\u2019s best interests to be adopted by their foster parents was erroneous because, \u201c[i]f th[at] were the standard for good cause under * * * ICWA, no Indian child could ever be removed from any non-Indian placement and the policies and intent of * * * ICWA would be completely negated.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b592-8\">Conversely, the children contend on appeal that the trial court did not abuse its discretion in determining that good cause existed to deviate from ICWA\u2019s placement preferences. According to the children, in making that determination, the trial court properly considered the best interests of the children.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> Specifically, the children contend that they</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b593-2\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"547\">*547</page-number>\u201chad been in [foster parents\u2019] home for almost all of their lives. They were bonded to the entire family, relying heavily on the family to meet their ordinary and extraordinary needs. [K] had been subject to multiple moves, and Ms. Strickland testified that there would be damage lasting at least a few years if she was required to move again. With regard to [I], he would not be understood in the new home for a period of time. He was likely to regress even further if subjected to the stress and confusion a move would cause.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b593-3\">The parties\u2019 competing contentions present two issues of first impression in Oregon that we must resolve: (1) What considerations properly bear on a court\u2019s determination of the existence of \u201cgood cause\u201d for purposes of 25 USC section 1915(a)? (2) What is the proper appellate standard of review of a trial court\u2019s \u201cgood cause\u201d determination? The resolution of those two questions determines our disposition here.</p>\n<p id=\"b593-4\">Before addressing those two questions in detail, we begin with a general overview of the ICWA provisions and policies that inform our inquiry. ICWA embodies a congressional policy</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b593-5\">\u201cto protect the best interests of Indian children and to promote the stability and security of Indian tribes and families by the establishment of minimum Federal standards for the removal of Indian children from their families and the placement of such children in foster or adoptive homes which will reflect the unique values of Indian culture * *</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b593-6\">25 USC \u00a7 1902. To further that policy, ICWA establishes preferences for the adoptive placements of Indian children. Specifically, 25 USC section 1915(a) provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b593-7\">\u201cIn any adoptive placement of an Indian child under State law, a preference shall be given, in the absence of good cause to the contrary, to a placement with (1) a member of the child\u2019s extended family; (2) other members of the Indian child\u2019s tribe; or (3) other Indian families.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b593-8\"> Section 1915(a) embodies the federal policy that, \u201cwhere possible, an Indian child should remain in the Indian community\u201d and is \u201c[t]he most important substantive requirement imposed on state courts.\u201d <em>Mississippi Choctaw Indian Band v. Holyfield, </em>490 US 30, 36-37, 109 S Ct 1597, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"548\">*548</page-number>104 L Ed 2d 29 (1989). In practical terms, section 1915(a) establishes a presumption that an adoptive placement in accordance with the preference criteria is in an Indian child\u2019s best interests. <em>See In re C.H., </em>299 Mont 62, 67, 997 P2d 776, 780 (2000) (\u201cICWA expresses the presumption that it is in an Indian child\u2019s best interests to be placed in an Indian home in conformance with the \u00a7 1915 placement preferences.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b594-4\">Although that presumption may be rebutted if the court determines that \u201cgood cause\u201d exists, ICWA does not define the term \u201cgood cause\u201d as used in section 1915(a) and does not identify the considerations on which a good cause determination may be predicated. However, the Bureau of Indian Affairs (BIA) has promulgated guidelines that set forth three circumstances that may constitute good cause to depart from ICWA\u2019s placement provisions:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b594-5\">\u201cF.3. Good Cause to Modify Preferences</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b594-6\">\u201c(a) For purposes of * * * adoptive placement, a determination of good cause not to follow the order of preference * * * shall be based on one or more of the following considerations:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b594-7\">\u201c(i) The request of the biological parents or the child when the child is of sufficient age.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b594-8\">\u201c(ii) The extraordinary physical or emotional needs of the child as established by testimony of a qualified expert witness.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b594-9\">\u201c(in) The unavailability of suitable families for placement after a diligent search has been completed for families meeting the preference criteria.\u201d<footnotemark>13</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b595-2\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"549\">*549</page-number>Guidelines for State Courts; Indian Child Custody Proceedings, 44 Fed Reg 67, 594 (1979).</p>\n<p id=\"b595-3\">We have noted in related contexts that the BIA guidelines are not an exclusive statement of the considerations that are pertinent to a \u201cgood cause\u201d determination under ICWA. For example, in <em>State ex rel SOSCF v. Lucas, </em>177 Or App 318, 324 n 4, 33 P3d 1001 (2001), <em>rev den, </em>333 Or 567 (2002), the issue was whether \u201cgood cause\u201d existed to deny a motion to transfer jurisdiction of an ICWA proceeding to the tribe. We reasoned that, \u201c[although we have declined to adopt the BIA guidelines, we have recognized that they may be instructive.\u201d <em>Id. </em>The same is true here.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b595-4\">Indeed, the introduction to the guidelines indicates that \u201cthey are not intended to have binding legislative effect\u201d and that courts that decide ICWA cases have \u201cprimary responsibility\u201d for \u201cinterpreting\u201d the term \u201cgood cause.\u201d 44 Fed Reg 67,584 (1979). In particular, the introduction states that \u201cthe legislative history of the Act states explicitly that the use of the term \u2018good cause\u2019 was designed to provide state courts with flexibility in determining the disposition of a placement proceeding involving an Indian child.\u201d<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b595-5\">In exercising their responsibility for amplifying and applying the term \u201cgood cause,\u201d courts across the country have identified a variety of considerations on which their decisions in individual cases have been predicated. \u201cThese include but are not necessarily limited to the best interests of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"550\">*550</page-number>the child, the wishes of the biological parents, the suitability of persons preferred for placement, the child\u2019s ties to the tribe, and the child\u2019s ability to make any cultural adjustments necessitated by a particular placement.\u201d <em>Adoption of M., </em>66 Wash App 475, 482, 832 P2d 518, 522 (1992) (citations omitted). \u201c[T]he certainty of psychological and emotional trauma if the child is removed from the adoptive parents\u201d and \u201cthe likelihood of emotional damage\u201d to a child from contact with his or her biological parent if placed according to ICWA\u2019s preferences are also relevant considerations. <em>Matter of Baby Boy Doe, </em>127 Idaho 452, 462-63, 902 P2d 477, 487-88 (1995).</p>\n<p id=\"b596-4\">Against that statutory backdrop of ICWA and the case law interpreting it, we return to the dispositive issue in this <em>case </em>\u2014 viz., whether \u201cgood cause\u201d existed to depart from ICWA\u2019s placement preferences. Resolution of that issue requires that we first examine the nature of a \u201cgood cause\u201d determination as well as the proper standard by which to review it.</p>\n<p id=\"b596-5\">In their briefs, DHS and the children contend, without elaboration, that most courts that have addressed the issue have concluded that a trial court\u2019s good cause determination should be reviewed for abuse of discretion. <em>See, e.g., Adoption of M., </em>66 Wash App at 482, 832 P2d at 522 (\u201cGood cause is a matter of discretion[.]\u201d). However, for the reasons that we will explain, we disagree that a \u201cgood cause\u201d determination is a matter of judicial discretion.</p>\n<p id=\"b596-6\">Generally, \u201cgood cause\u201d is a legal standard. In <em>State v. Johnson, </em>339 Or 69, 86, 116 P3d 879 (2005), the Supreme Court discussed the nature of a \u201cgood cause\u201d determination in the context of a trial court\u2019s ruling on a motion to dismiss a criminal case on statutory speedy trial grounds:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b596-7\">\u201cWe acknowledge the temptation to treat indefinite terms like \u2018good cause,\u2019 \u2018sufficient reason,\u2019 and \u2018reasonable period of time\u2019 as calling for a subjective determination and, thus, as invoking personal judgment. However, it is clear that, when such terms appear in a statutory context, they are focused on real, albeit sometimes difficult to discern, legal standards: the <em>legislature\u2019s </em>view of what is \u2018good,\u2019 \u2018sufficient,\u2019 or \u2018reasonable.\u2019 As such, in the absence of a factual <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"551\">*551</page-number>dispute, a determination that \u2018good cause\u2019 not to dismiss has been shown under <em>former </em>section 320 (or that \u2018sufficient reason\u2019 not to dismiss has been shown under present-day ORS 135.750) invokes an objective standard and must be reviewed for legal error. In no case would judicial <em>discretion </em>play any role in the \u2018good cause\u2019 determination of <em>former </em>section 321.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b597-4\">(Footnote omitted; emphasis in original.) <em>See also State v. Rogers, </em>330 Or 282, 312, 4 P3d 1261 (2000) (\u201cIf there is only one legally correct outcome, then \u2018discretion\u2019 is an inapplicable concept.\u201d); <em>Black\u2019s Law Dictionary </em>251 (9th ed 2009) (defining \u201cgood cause\u201d to include \u201c[a] legally sufficient reason\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b597-5\">The Supreme Court\u2019s reasoning in <em>Johnson </em>applies equally to a \u201cgood cause\u201d determination in the context of ICWA\u2019s placement preferences. That is so because, as we previously explained, one purpose of ICWA was to establish \u201cminimum Federal standards\u201d for the placement of Indian children in adoptive homes. The \u201cgood cause\u201d exception to the placement preferences described in section 1915(a) is one such standard. Moreover, as the Court explained in <em>Holyfield, </em>\u201c[i]t is clear from the very text of the ICWA, not to mention its legislative history and the hearings that led to its enactment, that Congress was concerned with the rights of Indian families and Indian communities vis-\u00e1-vis state authorities.\u201d 490 US at 44-45. More specifically, citing various provisions of ICWA, including the placement preferences in section 1915, the Court noted that \u201c[that] conclusion is inescapable from a reading of the entire statute, the main effect of which is to curtail state authority.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 45 n 17. With the purposes underlying the statute so understood, it is likely that Congress intended a single set of facts in a given case to be either legally sufficient or legally insufficient to establish \u201cgood cause.\u201d<footnotemark>16</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b598-2\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"552\">*552</page-number>Accordingly, we conclude that \u201cgood cause\u201d as used in the placement preferences of section 1915(a) is a legal standard and that, consequently, we review a trial court\u2019s \u201cgood cause\u201d determination for errors of law. More particularly, that means that we must determine whether the facts, as found by the trial court and as supported by evidence in the record, are legally sufficient to establish \u201cgood cause\u201d to depart from ICWA\u2019s placement preferences.<footnotemark>17</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b598-4\">That inquiry, in turn, requires some identification of those considerations that properly pertain to a judicial determination as to whether good cause exists to depart from ICWA\u2019s placement preferences. As we previously explained, courts across the country have relied on the BIA guidelines as well as other considerations in determining whether good cause exists in a given case. 236 Or App at 548-50. In this case, however, we need not identify the universe or totality of considerations that might bear on \u201cgood cause.\u201d That is so, because, regardless of whether, as an abstract proposition, in a different case or on a different record other considerations <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"553\">*553</page-number>might properly pertain to a \u201cgood cause\u201d determination, the trial court\u2019s \u201cgood cause\u201d determination in this case was ultimately predicated on a consideration that is legally sufficient by itself to establish \u201cgood cause\u201d and that is supported by evidence in this record.</p>\n<p id=\"b599-4\">Here, as noted, the trial court emphasized in its findings that \u201cthe harm to [K] and [I] will be serious and lasting, if they are moved from [foster parents\u2019] home\u201d and that, in grandparents\u2019 home, \u201c[K] and [I] will be exposed to biological family, a circumstance which Ms. Strickland credibly testified will damage [K].\u201d Given those findings, which were based substantially on the trial court\u2019s assessment of expert testimony, the court concluded that \u201cthe harm to these children in removing them from their home outweighs any other consideration by a degree of magnitude.\u201d Thus, the court\u2019s reasoning demonstrates that its \u201cgood cause\u201d determination was fundamentally predicated on two considerations: (1) the serious and lasting harm that will result from the removal of the children from their current home and (2) the significant potential that the preferred caretakers will engage in conduct or conditions will exist in their home that would be seriously detrimental to the children.</p>\n<p id=\"b599-5\"> We agree with the trial court that both of those considerations are pertinent in determining whether good cause exists to depart from ICWA\u2019s placement preferences. We further conclude that, regardless of the trial court\u2019s assessment of the latter, the former is conclusive.</p>\n<p id=\"b599-6\">We fully appreciate the fundamental and compelling policies that underlie ICWA. We are also mindful of the tribes\u2019 expressed concerns that those policies can be subverted or eroded through judicial decision-making that partakes of cultural biases, either implicit or explicit, especially with respect to \u201cgood cause\u201d determinations. Further, we are fully cognizant from our extensive experience in juvenile dependency matters that in virtually every case involving a change of custody from a well-established placement, the affected child or children will suffer some degree of emotional distress and dislocation. The nature, severity, and durability of that harm can vary greatly from case to case.</p>\n<p id=\"b600-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"554\">*554</page-number>We are mindful of all of those things \u2014 and of our sworn obligation to apply ICWA consistently with that statute\u2019s mandates. But ICWA does not mandate effectuation of its placement preferences in every case. Rather, the statute explicitly provides that, notwithstanding a strong presumption of deference to the placement preferences, the presumption can, in special cases, be overcome by a showing of \u201cgood cause.\u201d \u201cGood cause\u201d properly and necessarily includes circumstances in which an Indian child will suffer serious and irreparable injury as a result of the change of placement.<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> Here, as noted, the trial court explicitly accepted as credible and persuasive expert testimony that \u201cthe harm to [the children] will be serious and lasting, if they are moved from [foster parents\u2019] home.\u201d That finding, substantiated by evidence in this record, is legally sufficient to establish \u201cgood cause\u201d for purposes of 25 USC section 1915(a).</p>\n<p id=\"b600-4\">Affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b584-6\"> The text of 25 USC section 1915(a) is set out below. 236 Or App at 547.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b584-7\"> ORS 19.415(3) (2007), <em>amended by </em>Or Laws 2009, ch 231, \u00a7 2, provided that, \u201c[u]pon an appeal from a judgment in an equitable proceeding, the Court of Appeals shall try the cause anew upon the record.\u201d Relatedly, with regard to juvenile cases, ORS 419A.200(6) (2007), <em>amended by </em>Or Laws 2009, ch 231, \u00a7 6, provided, in part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b584-8\">\u201cAn appeal to the Court of Appeals must be conducted in the same manner as an appeal under ORS chapter 19 except that:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b584-9\">\u00ab* * * * \u2021</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b584-10\">\u201c(b) The court\u2019s scope of review is de novo on the record.\u201d</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b584-11\"> Those amendments to ORS 19.415 apply to appeals, such as this one, in which the notice of appeal was filed on or after June 4,2009.

Even if we were to do that here, a heightened standard of proof would be inappropriate because the children\u2019s adoptive placement is an issue related to the children\u2019s permanency plan of adoption and a preponderance standard of proof applies in permanency hearings. <em>See </em>ORS 419B.476(1) (providing, in part, that \u201c[a] permanency hearing shall be conducted in the manner provided in ORS * * * 419B.310\u201d); ORS 419B.3KX3) (providing that \u201c[t]he facts alleged in the petition showing the child to be within the jurisdiction of the court as provided in ORS 419B. 100(1), unless admitted, must be established by a preponderance of competent evidence\u201d).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"18\">\n<p id=\"b600-5\"> In <em>Matter of Baby Boy Doe, </em>127 Idaho at 462, 902 P2d at 487, the Idaho Supreme Court held that the trial court did not err in determining that good cause to deviate from ICWA\u2019s placement preferences existed, in part, because of \u201cthe certainty of psychological and emotional trauma if the child is removed from the adoptive parents.\u201d There, the court reasoned:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b600-6\">\u201cThe trial court stated there was little disagreement among the expert witnesses that a change in custody would have adverse consequences on the child\u2019s psychological and emotional well being.
