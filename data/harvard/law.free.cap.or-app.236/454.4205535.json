In his opening brief on appeal, defendant raises three assignments of error. In the first assignment of error, he contends that the trial court erred in denying his request for self-representation. In his other assignments of error, he challenges two of the court\u2019s jury instructions. In a <em>pro se </em>supplemental brief, defendant raises five additional assignments of error, including one concerning the trial court\u2019s denial of his motion to dismiss the case on statutory speedy trial grounds. A discussion of the facts would not benefit the bench, the bar, or the public.</p>\n<p id=\"b499-4\">With regard to defendant\u2019s first assignment of error, the state concedes that \u201c[t]he trial court erred when it denied defendant\u2019s request for self-representation.\u201d Further, the state took \u201cno position on counsel\u2019s second and third assignments of error and the assignments of error in defendant\u2019s <em>pro se </em>supplemental brief\u2019 because \u201cits concession on [the first assignment of error] is dispositive.\u201d However, after the case was submitted to us, we issued an order directing the state to file a supplemental brief addressing defendant\u2019s assignment of error concerning the denial of his motion to dismiss on statutory speedy trial grounds because, \u201cif the speedy trial issue is well-taken, that would render moot the proceeding at trial without counsel issue.\u201d Thereafter the state filed a supplemental brief addressing the speedy trial issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b499-5\">We reject defendant\u2019s assignment of error in his <em>pro se </em>supplemental brief concerning the speedy trial issue without discussion. With regard to defendant\u2019s first assignment of error concerning the trial court\u2019s denial of his request for self-representation, we agree with and accept the state\u2019s concession that the trial court erred in that regard. Our resolution of the first assignment of error obviates any need to address defendant\u2019s other assignments of error in his opening brief and his <em>pro se </em>supplemental brief.</p>\n<p id=\"b499-6\">Reversed and remanded.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
