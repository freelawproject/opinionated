(mother) appeals from an order terminating parental rights to her daughter, S.B. At the preceding hearing, at which the juvenile court set the termination hearing, the social worker learned for the first time that S.B. had Indian ancestry. At that point, the social worker attempted to give notice pursuant to the Indian Child Welfare Act (25 U.S.C. \u00a7 1901 et seq.) (the ICWA). Although the notice did not comply fully with all applicable requirements, it did reach the Cherokee Nation (the Tribe), and the Tribe did respond. As a result, the mother and S.B. became members of the Tribe; the Tribe intervened; and, with the Tribe\u2019s approval, S.B. was placed with Indian foster parents who wanted to adopt her.</p>\n<p id=\"b1061-12\">In the published portion of this opinion, we consider the mother\u2019s contention that the juvenile court and the social worker complied only belatedly <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1154\">*1154</page-number>with their duty under the ICWA to inquire into S.B.\u2019s Indian ancestry. We will reject this contention for three reasons. First, the mother waived it by failing to raise it at the first opportunity; although a parent cannot waive an Indian tribe\u2019s rights under the ICWA, the parent can waive his or her own rights. Second, the fact that the social worker\u2019s reports stated that the ICWA did not apply, along with the fact that the ICWA check boxes on the petition were left blank, constituted sufficient evidence that an inquiry was made. Third, at least as to the mother, the asserted error was harmless. The detention hearing did not involve a foster care placement within the meaning of the ICWA; hence, the substantive provisions of the ICWA did not apply. The jurisdictional/dispositional hearing did involve a foster care placement, and we may assume the review hearings did as well, but there is no reasonable probability that, if the substantive provisions of the ICWA had been applied, the mother would have enjoyed a more favorable result.</p>\n<p id=\"b1062-5\">In the unpublished portion of this opinion, we find no other error. Accordingly, we will affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b1062-6\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b1062-7\">FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b1062-8\">When this dependency proceeding was originally filed, S.B. was two, going on three. She is now five.</p>\n<p id=\"b1062-9\">On November 7, 2002, because both of her parents were found to be under the influence of drugs, and because of hazardous conditions in the home, S.B. was detained. On November 8, 2002, the San Bernardino County Department of Children\u2019s Services (the Department) filed a dependency petition concerning her. Initially, she was placed in a group foster home. Within weeks, however, she was moved to a foster family home.</p>\n<p id=\"b1062-10\">Both the report for the detention hearing and the report for the jurisdictional/dispositional hearing stated, \u201cThe Indian Child Welfare Act does not apply.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1062-11\">On December 2, 2002, at the jurisdictional/dispositional hearing, the parents submitted on the social worker\u2019s reports. The juvenile court found jurisdiction based on failure to protect. (Welf. &amp; Inst. Code, \u00a7 300, subd. (b).) It ordered reunification services.</p>\n<p id=\"b1062-12\">On January 14, 2004, at the 12-month review hearing, the juvenile court terminated reunification services and set a hearing pursuant to Welfare and Institutions Code section 366.26 (section 366.26 hearing). At that same <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1155\">*1155</page-number>hearing, however, the social worker learned (apparently from the mother, but possibly from the maternal grandmother, who was at the hearing) that S.B. had Indian heritage.</p>\n<p id=\"b1063-5\">On February 2, 2004, after obtaining the necessary information from the maternal grandmother, the social worker mailed a form SOC 318 to the Bureau of Indian Affairs (the BIA). That form would have provided information about S.B.\u2019s ancestry. There is no indication, however, that the social worker sent a form SOC 319, which would have provided notice of the dependency proceeding. (See <em>In re C.D. </em>(2003) 110 Cal.App.4th 214, 223-226 [1 Cal.Rptr.3d 578].)</p>\n<p id=\"b1063-6\">On February 18, 2004, the juvenile court held a \u201cnotice review\u201d hearing. The maternal grandmother appeared and stated that she was a member of the Tribe. Counsel for the Department indicated that it was going to give notice pursuant to the ICWA.</p>\n<p id=\"b1063-7\">Meanwhile, the Tribe responded to the notice already sent to the BIA. In a letter dated February 20, 2004, it confirmed that the maternal grandmother was a member of the Tribe and that S.B. was eligible for membership. A membership application was enclosed. The letter also stated: \u201cThe Cherokee Nation is not empowered to intervene in this matter unless the child/children or eligible parent(s) apply and receive membership.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1063-8\">On June 18, 2004, the mother filed a \u201cmotion to invalidate jurisdictional, dispositional, 366.21(e) and 366.21(f) findings and orders for failure to comply with the Indian Child Welfare Act and Welfare &amp; Inst. Code section 360.6.\u201d (Capitalization altered.)</p>\n<p id=\"b1063-9\">On July 2, 2004, the prospective adoptive parents indicated that they had changed their minds about adoption; they asked that S.B. be removed from their home.</p>\n<p id=\"b1063-10\">On or about July 15, 2004, both the mother and S.B. became members of the Tribe. On July 27 (or 29), 2004, the Tribe filed a \u201cNotice of Intervention.\u201d (Capitalization altered.)</p>\n<p id=\"b1063-11\">On August 9, 2004, S.B. was placed with a family that wanted to adopt her. The prospective adoptive mother had both Cherokee and Navajo ancestry; the prospective adoptive father had both Cherokee and Cheyenne ancestry. Although not members of any tribe, they were \u201cactively involved in cultural events\u201d such as powwows. The Tribe took the position that, although it would have preferred a placement in the home of members of the Cherokee Nation, S.B.\u2019s current placement was in her best interest because she \u201chas <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1156\">*1156</page-number>adjusted to her community [and] school environment, and she will be raised attending cultural events with her foster/adoptive parents . . . .\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1064-5\">On August 26, 2004, the juvenile court denied the mother\u2019s motion to invalidate prior orders. It then proceeded to hold a contested section 366.26 hearing. For purposes of the ICWA, it specifically found, beyond a reasonable doubt, that continued custody of the child by the parents was likely to cause serious emotional or physical damage to the child (see 25 U.S.C. \u00a7 1912(f)) and, by clear and convincing evidence, that active efforts had been made to provide remedial services and rehabilitative programs designed to prevent the breakup of the Indian family (see 25 U.S.C. \u00a7 1912(d)). It also found that S.B. was adoptable and that none of the exceptions to termination of parental rights applied. It therefore terminated parental rights.</p>\n<p id=\"b1064-6\">The mother filed a timely notice of appeal. The Tribe has been given notice of the appeal, including copies of all of the briefs. It has notified us, however, that it does not wish to participate in the appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b1064-7\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b1064-8\">FAILURE TO INQUIRE INTO S.B.\u2019S INDIAN ANCESTRY</p>\n<p id=\"b1064-9\">The mother contends the juvenile court should have granted her motion to invalidate previous findings and orders because the juvenile court and the Department had failed to inquire into whether S.B. was an Indian child.</p>\n<p id=\"b1064-10\">A. <em>Statutory Background.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1064-11\">Among the stated purposes of the ICWA are \u201cto protect the best interests of Indian children and to promote the stability and security of Indian tribes and families by the establishment of minimum Federal standards for the removal of Indian children from their families and the placement of such children in foster or adoptive homes which will reflect the unique values of Indian culture____\u201d (25 U.S.C. \u00a7 1902.)</p>\n<p id=\"b1064-12\">In general, the ICWA applies to any state court proceeding involving the foster care or adoptive placement of, or the termination of parental rights to, an Indian child. (25 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1903(1), 1911(1)-(3), 1912-1918, 1920, 1921.) \u201cIndian child\u201d is defined as a child who is either (1) \u201ca member of an Indian tribe\u201d or (2) \u201celigible for membership in an Indian tribe and ... the biological child of a member of an Indian tribe . . . .\u201d (25 U.S.C. \u00a7 1903(4).)</p>\n<p id=\"b1064-13\">We are concerned with three types of ICWA provisions, which we will call the \u201cnotice provisions,\u201d the \u201csubstantive provisions,\u201d and the \u201cenforcement provision.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1065-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1157\">*1157</page-number>First, under the notice provisions, if \u201cthe court knows or has reason to know that an Indian child is involved,\u201d the social services agency must \u201cnotify ... the Indian child\u2019s tribe, by registered mail with return receipt requested, of the pending proceedings and of their right of intervention.\u201d (25 U.S.C. \u00a7 1912(a).) \u201cIf the identity or location of ... the tribe cannot be determined,\u201d the notice need only be given to the BIA. <em>(Ibid.) </em>\u201cNo foster care placement or termination of parental rights proceeding shall be held until at least ten days after receipt of notice by . . . the tribe or the [BIA].\u201d <em>(Ibid.)</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1065-5\">Second, under the substantive provisions, the Indian child\u2019s tribe has \u201ca right to intervene at any point in the proceeding.\u201d (25 U.S.C. \u00a7 1911(c).) As a condition of any foster care placement or termination of parental rights, the court must find \u201cthat active efforts have been made to provide remedial services and rehabilitative programs designed to prevent the breakup of the Indian family and that these efforts have proved unsuccessful.\u201d (25 U.S.C. \u00a7 1912(d).) The court also must find, based at least in part on the \u201ctestimony of qualified expert witnesses,\u201d that \u201cthe continued custody of the child by the parent ... is likely to result in serious emotional or physical damage to the child.\u201d (25 U.S.C. \u00a7 1912(e), (f).) For a foster care placement, this must be proven \u201cby clear and convincing evidence.\u201d (25 U.S.C. \u00a7 1912(e).) For termination of parental rights, it must be proven \u201cbeyond a reasonable doubt.\u201d (25 U.S.C. \u00a7 1912(f).)</p>\n<p id=\"b1065-6\">Third and finally, under the enforcement provision, on the petition of the Indian child, a parent from whose custody an Indian child has been removed, or the Indian child\u2019s tribe, \u201cany court of competent jurisdiction\u201d must invalidate any \u201caction for foster care placement or termination of parental rights\u201d that violated the notice provision or any of the substantive provisions. (25 U.S.C. \u00a7 1914.)</p>\n<p id=\"b1065-7\">A host of subsidiary requirements have been adopted to implement, interpret, and enlarge upon this statutory language. These requirements are embodied in: (1) federal regulations (25 C.F.R. \u00a7 23.1 et seq.), which are binding in all federal and state courts by virtue of the supremacy clause (see <em>Olszewski v. Scripps Health </em>(2003) 30 Cal.4th 798, 814 [135 Cal.Rptr.2d 1, 69 P.3d 927]); (2) federal \u201cGuidelines for State Courts\u201d (Guidelines) (44 Fed.Reg. 67584 (Nov. 26, 1979)), which by their terms are \u201cnot intended to have binding legislative effect\u201d <em>(ibid.); </em>(3) a state rule of court (Cal. Rules of Court, rule 1439); (4) several \u201cmandatory\u201d state Judicial Council forms (JV-130, JV-135; see also Gov. Code, \u00a7 68511); and (5) sections 31-515 and 31-520 of the state Child Welfare Services Manual of Policies and Procedures (CWS Manual)<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> (see <em>In re Asia L. </em>(2003) 107 Cal.App.4th 498, 506 [132 Cal.Rptr.2d 733]).</p>\n<p id=\"b1066-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1158\">*1158</page-number>For example, the ICWA notice provisions, by their terms, apply if \u201cthe court knows or has reason to know that an Indian child is involved . . . .\u201d (25 U.S.C. \u00a7 1912(a).) The ICWA does not define \u201creason to know.\u201d Neither do the controlling federal regulations. (See 25 C.F.R. \u00a7 23.11(a) (2005).) The Guidelines, however, require \u201cthe state court [to] <em>make inquiries </em>to determine if the child involved is a member of an Indian tribe or if a parent of the child is a member of an Indian tribe and the child is eligible for membership in an Indian tribe.\u201d (Guidelines, \u00a7 B.5.a, 44 Fed.Reg. 67588 (Nov. 26, 1979), italics added.) The state rule of court provides that \u201c[t]he court <em>[and] the </em>county welfare department. . . have an affirmative duty to inquire whether a child for whom a [dependency] petition ... is to be, or has been, filed is or may be an Indian child.\u201d (Cal. Rules of Court, rule 1439(d), italics added.) Judicial Council form JV-135, effective January 1, 2005, provides for a parent to indicate whether the child is or might be an Indian child.</p>\n<p id=\"b1066-5\">The CWS Manual, finally, provides that \u201cthe social worker shall: [f] . . . [i]dentify in the petition that the child is or may be an Indian child as defined by the ICWA.\u201d (CWS Manual, \u00a7 31-515.) \u201cTo make such a determination, the social worker shall ask the child, his parent or custodian whether the child is or may be a member of an Indian tribe, or whether the child identifies himself/herself as a member of a particular Indian organization.\u201d (CWS Manual, \u00a7 31-515.111.) If the child\u2019s Indian status cannot be determined before the first hearing, the social worker must \u201c[a]dvise the court of all information which indicates that the child may be an Indian child,\u201d \u201c[a]dvise the court of all efforts made to establish the child\u2019s status as an Indian child,\u201d and \u201c[c]ontinue contacts with the BIA until the question of the child\u2019s status as an Indian child . . . has been resolved and the resolution is documented in the case record for future reference.\u201d (CWS Manual, \u00a7 31-515.2.)</p>\n<p id=\"b1066-6\">The ICWA expressly permits \u201c[s]tate or [f]ederal law [to] provide[] a higher standard of protection . . . than the rights provided under\u201d the ICWA. (25 U.S.C. \u00a7 1921.) This simply means, however, that the ICWA does not preempt such higher state standards. It does not incorporate such higher state standards into the ICWA itself. The enforcement provision, by its terms, applies only to violations \u201cof sections 1911, 1912, and 1913 of this title\u201d (25 U.S.C. \u00a7 1914); it does not purport to address the penalty for other violations of federal or state law.</p>\n<p id=\"b1066-7\">B. <em>Analysis.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1066-8\">1. <em>Waiver.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1066-9\">\u201cAs a general rule, a party is precluded from urging on appeal any point not raised in the trial court. Any other rule would permit a party to play <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1159\">*1159</page-number>fast and loose with the administration of justice by deliberately standing by without making an objection of which he is aware. [Citation.]\u201d <em>(In re Richard K. </em>(1994) 25 Cal.App.4th 580, 590 [30 Cal.Rptr.2d 575].) Similar principles apply to a belated attempt to raise a point in the trial court. For example, \u201c[t]he rule is well settled that when at any time during trial a party or his counsel becomes aware of facts constituting misconduct or irregularity in the proceedings of the jury, he must promptly bring such matters to the attention of the court, if he desires to object to it, or he will be deemed to have waived the point as a ground for a motion for a new trial. [Citations.]\u201d <em>(Weathers v. Kaiser Foundation Hospitals </em>(1971) 5 Cal.3d 98, 103 [95 Cal.Rptr. 516, 485 P.2d 1132].)</p>\n<p id=\"b1067-5\">Here, the mother raised her present contention for the first time by filing a motion to invalidate prior orders pursuant to the enforcement provision of the ICWA. (25 U.S.C. \u00a7 1914.) Previously, she had appeared (or waived her appearance) at every hearing that she now claims was held without the notice required by the ICWA. Nevertheless, she failed to object on ICWA grounds until those hearings were over and the section 366.26 hearing loomed. She does not offer any excuse for her previous failure to object; for example, she does not claim that she was unaware of her own Indian ancestry. We conclude that she thereby forfeited any right she might otherwise have had to invoke the enforcement provision.</p>\n<p id=\"b1067-6\">Admittedly, it has been held\u2014including by this court\u2014that a parent does not necessarily waive an ICWA notice issue by failing to raise it below. <em>(In re Suzanna L. </em>(2002) 104 Cal.App.4th 223, 231-232 [127 Cal.Rptr.2d 860] [Fourth Dist., Div. Two]; <em>In re Jennifer A. </em>(2002) 103 Cal.App.4th 692, 706 [127 Cal.Rptr.2d 54]; <em>Dwayne P. </em>v. <em>Superior Court </em>(2002) 103 Cal.App.4th 247, 257-258 [126 Cal.Rptr.2d 639]; <em>In re Samuel P. </em>(2002) 99 Cal.App.4th 1259, 1267-1268 [121 Cal.Rptr.2d 820]; <em>In re Marinna J. </em>(2001) 90 Cal.App.4th 731, 738-739 [109 Cal.Rptr.2d 267]; <em>In re Desiree F. </em>(2000) 83 Cal.App.4th 460, 471-472 [99 Cal.Rptr.2d 688].) These cases, however, reason that \u201c \u2018[t]he notice requirements serve the interests of the Indian tribes \u201cirrespective of the position of the parents\u201d and cannot be waived by the parent. [Citation.]\u2019 [Citation.]\u201d <em>(Suzanna L., </em>at pp. 231-232, quoting <em>Samuel P., </em>at p. 1267, quoting <em>In re Kahlen W. </em>(1991) 233 Cal.App.3d 1414, 1421 [285 Cal.Rptr. 507].)</p>\n<p id=\"b1067-7\">Once the child\u2019s tribe has appeared and has not asked, on its own behalf, that any prior actions be invalidated, this rationale does not apply. The parent has an independent right to invalidate prior actions, but there is every reason to hold that this can be waived. As in other cases, \u201c. . . \u2018[i]t would seem . . . intolerable to permit a party to play fast and loose with the administration of justice by deliberately standing by without making an objection of which he <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1160\">*1160</page-number>is aware and thereby permitting the proceedings to go to a conclusion which he may acquiesce in, if favorable, and which he may avoid, if not.\u2019 \u201d <em>(Caminetti </em>v. <em>Pac. Mutual L. Ins. Co. of California </em>(1943) 22 Cal.2d 386, 392 [139 P.2d 930], quoting <em>Lindsay-Strathmore Irr. Dist. v. Superior Court of Tulare County </em>(1920) 182 Cal. 315, 338 [187 P. 1056] (conc. opn. of Onley, J.).)</p>\n<p id=\"b1068-5\">While the social worker and the trial court have a duty to inquire into the child\u2019s Indian ancestry, a parent has superior access to this information. Moreover, a parent has a right to counsel, including appointed counsel, if necessary (Welf. &amp; Inst. Code, \u00a7 317, subds. (a), (b)), who has not only the ability but also the duty to protect the parent\u2019s rights under the ICWA. As the trial court in this case observed, if a parent has Indian ancestry, \u201cI would think as officers [of] the court, counsel for parents would have [a] similar interest [in] bringing] that information forward at the earliest possible time.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1068-6\">We recognize that, in a proceeding for foster care placement of, or termination of parental rights to, an Indian child, a parent\u2019s failure to object does not waive the <em>substantive </em>provisions (as opposed to the notice provisions) of the ICWA unless \u201cthe court is satisfied that the [parent] has been fully advised of the requirements of the Act, and has knowingly, intelligently, and voluntarily waived them.\u201d (Cal. Rules of Court, rule 1439(i)(2), &amp; (4), (j)(2), (m)(2) &amp; (4); see <em>In re Jennifer </em>A., <em>supra, </em>103 Cal.App.4th at pp. 707-708.) Here, however, S.B. was not yet an Indian child. The substantive provisions of the ICWA did not yet apply. There is no state rule of court similarly restricting waiver of the <em>notice </em>provisions, which are the source of the duty of inquiry.</p>\n<p id=\"b1068-7\">Accordingly, the mother could and did waive the supposed failure to inquire concerning S.B.\u2019s Indian ancestry.</p>\n<p id=\"b1068-8\">2. <em>The Sufficiency of the Evidence.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1068-9\">Separately and alternatively, the record indicates that the Department did inquire as to whether S.B. was an Indian child. <em>In re Aaliyah G. </em>(2003) 109 Cal.App.4th 939 [135 Cal.Rptr.2d 680] is practically on point. There, the petition application was marked \u201cNo\u201d to indicate that the child did not have Indian heritage. All subsequent reports stated that the ICWA did not apply. <em>(Id. </em>at p. 942.) On appeal, the father argued that the juvenile court and the social services agency had \u201cfailed to satisfy their affirmative duty to inquire as to ICWA\u2019s applicability.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 941.) The appellate court disagreed: \u201cChecking the \u2018No\u2019 box suggests that an inquiry as to Aaliyah\u2019s heritage was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1161\">*1161</page-number>made. There is no indication to the contrary. The court had no obligation to make a further or additional inquiry absent any information or suggestion that the child might have Indian heritage.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 942.) It concluded: \u201cBased on the record, there is sufficient evidence that an inquiry was made as to whether Aaliyah is an Indian child.\u201d <em>(Ibid.)</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1069-5\">Here, the Judicial Council form petition, JV-100 (Jan. 1, 1999 rev.), provided two check boxes for indicating the child\u2019s Indian status. One box meant: \u201cChild may be a member of, or eligible for[] membership in[,] a federally recognized Indian tribe.\u201d The other meant: \u201cChild may be of Indian ancestry.\u201d Neither was checked. The report for the detention hearing stated, \u201cThe Indian Child Welfare Act does not apply.\u201d The report for the jurisdictional/dispositional hearing likewise stated, \u201cThe Indian Child Welfare Act does not apply.\u201d The mother appeared in court, with her appointed counsel, but she never objected to these statements. Indeed, at the jurisdictional/dispositional hearing, she submitted on the reports.</p>\n<p id=\"b1069-6\">From the affirmative representation that the ICWA did not apply, it is fairly inferable that the social worker did make the necessary inquiry. The only even arguable distinction between <em>Aaliyah G. </em>and this case is that there, a box indicating that the ICWA <em>did not </em>apply <em>was </em>checked, whereas here, boxes indicating that the ICWA <em>did </em>apply were <em>not </em>checked. The form in this case, however, did not provide a box for indicating that the ICWA did not apply. As the Department aptly argues, the \u201cslight difference in the [forms] does not undermine the legal rationale.\u201d The mother did not introduce any contrary evidence. Although her counsel <em>argued </em>that the social worker had not made any inquiry, the mother did not submit a declaration or otherwise <em>testify </em>to this effect.</p>\n<p id=\"b1069-7\">The mother could argue that the social worker evidently did not make any inquiry to the maternal grandmother, because if she had, she would have learned that S.B. had Indian ancestry. However, as long as the social worker did inquire of the parents, and as long as the parents failed to provide any information requiring followup, she had no further duty of inquiry. The Guidelines require \u201cthe state court [to] make inquiries . . . .\u201d (Guidelines, \u00a7 B.5.a, 44 Fed.Reg. at p. 67588.) The court could hardly make inquiries of persons not parties to the proceeding. Although the state rule of court imposes a duty of inquiry on both the court and the social services agency (Cal. Rules of Court, rule 1439(d)), the Judicial Council form designed to implement this rule indicates that the initial inquiry need only be made to the parents. As the Judicial Council writes the rules of court, its interpretation seems definitive. Even the CWS Manual merely requires the social worker to \u201cask the child [and] his parent or custodian . . . .\u201d (CWS Manual, \u00a7 31-515.111.)</p>\n<p id=\"b1070-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1162\">*1162</page-number>We conclude that there was sufficient evidence that the juvenile court and the Department met their duty of inquiry.</p>\n<p id=\"b1070-5\">3. <em>Harmless Error.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1070-6\">Finally\u2014and, again, separately and alternatively\u2014the asserted error was harmless. An ICWA notice violation may be held harmless when the child\u2019s tribe has actually participated in the proceedings (see <em>In re Kahlen W., supra, </em>233 Cal.App.3d at p. 1424)<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> or when, even if notice had been given, the child would not have been found to be an Indian child, and hence the substantive provisions of the ICWA would not have applied <em>(ibid.; In re Antoinette S. </em>(2002) 104 Cal.App.4th 1401, 1411-1413 [129 Cal.Rptr.2d 15]). Moreover, any failure to comply with a higher state standard, above and beyond what the ICWA itself requires, must be held harmless unless the appellant can show a reasonable probability that he or she would have enjoyed a more favorable result in the absence of the error. (Cal. Const., art. VI, \u00a7 13; <em>People </em>v. <em>Watson </em>(1956) 46 Cal.2d 818, 836 [299 P.2d 243].)</p>\n<p id=\"b1070-7\">As already noted, to be an Indian child, a child must be either (1) a member of an Indian tribe, or (2) <em>both </em>eligible for membership in an Indian tribe <em>and </em>the biological child of a member of an Indian tribe. (25 U.S.C. \u00a7 1903(4).) Neither the mother nor S.B. was a member of the Tribe until July 2004. Hence, at the hearings up to and including the 12-month hearing, S.B. was not an Indian child. As soon as S.B. did become an Indian child, the Tribe intervened. Thereafter, the juvenile court complied with all of the substantive provisions of the ICWA. Accordingly, the mother essentially argues that the failure to inquire was prejudicial because it prevented S.B. from becoming an Indian child\u2014and hence it prevented the substantive provisions of the ICWA from applying\u2014earlier.</p>\n<p id=\"b1070-8\">a. <em>The Effect of the Asserted Error at the Detention Hearing.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1070-9\">Preliminarily, we do not believe that all of the provisions of the ICWA apply to a detention hearing. We recognize that the ICWA defines a \u201cfoster care placement\u201d as \u201cany action removing an Indian child from its parent ... for temporary placement in a foster home or institution or the home of a guardian or conservator where the parent. . . cannot have the child returned upon demand, but where parental rights have not been terminated[.]\u201d (25 U.S.C. \u00a7 1903(l)(i).) A detention hearing might appear to fit this description. Such a construction, however, would result in absurdities.</p>\n<p id=\"b1071-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1163\">*1163</page-number>In most cases, a detention occurs only because a social worker has determined that the child cannot be left in a parent\u2019s custody without endangering the child\u2019s health or safety. (Welf. &amp; Inst. Code, \u00a7 306, subds. (a)(2), (b); see also Welf. &amp; Inst. Code, \u00a7\u00a7 305, 306, subd. (a)(1).) It is an emergency removal; it results in an emergency placement. The detention hearing then provides for judicial review of the detention. Most provisions of the ICWA clearly are not intended to apply to such emergency removals or placements. For example, under California law, a detention hearing must be held within 48 hours, plus one court day, after the child is detained; otherwise, the child must be returned to the parents. (Welf. &amp; Inst. Code, \u00a7\u00a7 313, 315; see also Welf. &amp; Inst. Code, \u00a7\u00a7 215, 272, subd. (a)(1).) If the notice provisions of the ICWA applied, however, such an emergency hearing could not be held until at least 10 days after the parent and the tribe received notice by registered mail.</p>\n<p id=\"b1071-5\">Moreover, in an emergency, providing services typically is not a reasonable alternative to removal. Here, for example, the family had no prior referrals; it came to the attention of the Department when both parents were arrested, and the Department had no option other than to take S.B. into custody. Under the substantive provisions of the ICWA, however, the Department would have to show that it made \u201cactive efforts\u201d to prevent removal. Moreover, if it could not make such a showing, the juvenile court would have to return the child to the parents, even if that meant placing the child back into imminent danger.</p>\n<p id=\"b1071-6\">The only provision of the ICWA that is demonstrably intended to apply to an emergency placement provides, as relevant here: \u201cNothing in this subchapter shall be construed to prevent the emergency removal of an Indian child who is a resident of or is domiciled on a reservation, but temporarily located off the reservation, from his parent ... or the emergency placement of such child in a foster home or institution, under applicable State law, in order to prevent imminent physical damage or harm to the child. The State authority, official, or agency involved shall insure that the emergency removal or placement terminates immediately when such removal or placement is no longer necessary to prevent imminent physical damage or harm to the child and shall expeditiously initiate a child custody proceeding subject to the provisions of this subchapter, transfer the child to the jurisdiction of the appropriate Indian tribe, or restore the child to the parent or Indian custodian, as may be appropriate.\u201d (25 U.S.C. \u00a7 1922.)</p>\n<p id=\"b1071-7\">Read literally, this would appear to apply only to \u201can Indian child who is a resident of or is domiciled on a reservation, but temporarily located off the reservation . . . .\u201d If this reading were correct, however, the statute would not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1164\">*1164</page-number>then go on to allow the social services agency to initiate a child custody proceeding <em>or </em>to transfer the child to the jurisdiction of the appropriate Indian tribe; an Indian tribe has <em>exclusive </em>jurisdiction over any child custody proceeding involving an Indian child who is a resident of or domiciled on a reservation. (25 U.S.C. \u00a7 1911(a).) Moreover, it would make no sense to give a state <em>more </em>power to make an emergency placement of an Indian child who lives <em>on </em>a reservation than one who lives <em>off </em>the reservation. Thus, as the legislative history confirms, Congress intended this section to apply to emergency removals and placements of <em>all </em>Indian children. (H.R.Rep. No. 95-1386, 2d Sess., p. 25 (1978), reprinted in 1978 U.S. Code Cong. &amp; Admin. News, pp. 7530, 7548.)</p>\n<p id=\"b1072-5\">As far as we can tell, only two courts have considered whether a detention hearing is a \u201cfoster care placement\u201d within the meaning of the ICWA. Both have held it is not. <em>(In the Matter of the Welfare of J.A.S. </em>(Minn.Ct.App. 1992) 488 N.W.2d 332, 334-335; <em>State ex rel. Juvenile Department of Multnomah County v. Charles </em>(1984) 70 Ore.App. 10, 13, 14, fn. 2 [688 P.2d 1354] [\u201c[e]mergency removal... is <em>initially </em>purely a state law matter and is not subject to all of tire ICWA requirements\u201d].) For the reasons we have discussed, we agree. It follows that, in this case, the failure to inquire sooner into S.B.\u2019s Indian ancestry could not have had an effect on the detention hearing.</p>\n<p id=\"b1072-6\">b. <em>The Effect of the Asserted Error at the Jurisdictional/Dispositional Hearing.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1072-7\">This brings us to the jurisdictional/dispositional hearing. At that hearing, the juvenile court for the first time formally removed S.B. from her parents\u2019 custody (Welf. &amp; Inst. Code, \u00a7 361, subd. (c)) and placed her in the custody of the Department. This vested the Department with the authority to place her in foster care. (Welf. &amp; Inst. Code, \u00a7 361.2, subd. (e).) The juvenile court also approved her existing placement. (See Welf. &amp; Inst. Code, \u00a7\u00a7361, subd. (e), 366, subd. (a)(1)(A).) Thus, the jurisdictional/dispositional hearing did effect a foster care placement within the meaning of the ICWA.</p>\n<p id=\"b1072-8\">The applicable substantive provisions of the ICWA are twofold. First, before making a foster care placement, the juvenile court would have had to find, based on clear and convincing evidence, \u201cthat active efforts ha[d] been made to provide remedial services and rehabilitative programs designed to prevent the breakup of the Indian family and that these efforts ha[d] proved unsuccessful.\u201d (25 U.S.C. \u00a7 1912(d); see also <em>In re Michael G. </em>(1998) 63 Cal.App.4th 700, 709-712 [74 Cal.Rptr.2d 642].)</p>\n<p id=\"b1073-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1165\">*1165</page-number>Under state law, however, the juvenile court was already required to \u201cmake a determination as to whether reasonable efforts were made to prevent or to eliminate the need for removal of the minor from his or her home .. . .\u201d (Welf. &amp; Inst. Code, \u00a7 361, subd. (d).) It has been said that \u201cthe standards in assessing whether \u2018active efforts\u2019 were made to prevent the breakup of the Indian family, and whether reasonable services under state law were provided, are essentially undifferentiable.\u201d <em>(In re Michael G., supra, </em>63 Cal.App.4th at p. 714; see also <em>Letitia V. v. Superior Court </em>(2000) 81 Cal.App.4th 1009, 1016 [97 Cal.Rptr.2d 303].) Certainly they were undifferentiable as applied to this case. Both parents submitted on the social worker\u2019s reports. Accordingly, the juvenile court found that such reasonable efforts had been made. The mother did not appeal this finding, and it is now res judicata. <em>(In re Matthew C. </em>(1993) 6 Cal.4th 386, 393 [24 Cal.Rptr.2d 765, 862 P.2d 765].) On this record, we see no reason to suppose that the juvenile court had been asked to find whether \u201cactive efforts\u201d had been made, rather than \u201creasonable efforts,\u201d it would have made a different finding.</p>\n<p id=\"b1073-5\">The mother notes that, under California Rules of Court, rule 1439(i)(4)(B), \u201c[ejfforts to provide services shall include attempts to utilize the available resources of extended family members, the tribe, Indian social service agencies, and individual Indian caregivers.\u201d<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> She argues that, if S.B. had been an Indian child, she herself would have been entitled to different or additional services. The family\u2019s problems, however, consisted of drug abuse and hazardous conditions in the home. There is no reason to suppose that Indian services would have been any more successful in eliminating these problems than non-Indian services were. Ultimately, at the section 366.26 hearing, the Department\u2019s expert testified, and the juvenile court found, that the active efforts required by the ICWA had been made.</p>\n<p id=\"b1073-6\">Second, before making a foster care placement, the juvenile court would have had to find, based at least in part on the testimony of a qualified expert witness, that parental custody was likely to result in serious emotional or physical damage to the child. (25 U.S.C. \u00a7 1912(e).) Again, however, as a matter of state law, it had to find, by clear and convincing evidence, the existence of one of several specified imminent threats to S.B.\u2019s well-being. (Welf. &amp; Inst. Code, \u00a7 361, subd. (c).) Both parents, again, submitted on the social worker\u2019s reports. Accordingly, the juvenile court found that: \u201cThere is a substantial danger to the physical health, safety, protection, or physical or emotional well-being of [S.B.] or would be if [S.B.] were returned home . . . .\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1166\">*1166</page-number>When an expert witness ultimately did testify, at the section 366.26 hearing, she opined that returning S.B. to her parents\u2019 custody was likely to result in serious emotional or physical damage because they were still using drugs. Thus, there is no reason to suppose that, if an expert witness had testified at the jurisdictional/dispositional hearing, the juvenile court would have made a different finding.</p>\n<p id=\"b1074-5\">c. <em>The Effect of the Asserted Error at the Six- and 12-month Review Hearings.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1074-6\">The six- and 12-month review hearings did not result in S.B. being removed from a parent and placed in a foster home or institution. (See 25 U.S.C. \u00a7 1903(1)(i).) She simply remained in the same foster care placement made previously at the jurisdictional/dispositional hearing. Nevertheless, we may assume, without deciding, that these review hearings involved a foster care placement within the meaning of the ICWA. (See <em>In re Bridget R. </em>(1996) 41 Cal.App.4th 1483, 1520-1521, fn. 24 [49 Cal.Rptr.2d 507].)</p>\n<p id=\"b1074-7\">If so, the juvenile court was required to make both \u201cactive efforts\u201d and \u201cserious damage\u201d findings. Nevertheless, at the six-month review hearing, both parents once again submitted on the social worker\u2019s report. At the 12-month hearing, the mother\u2019s counsel conceded that \u201cthe social worker\u2019s representations are very close to accurate [and] at the present time she isn\u2019t able to take this child into her home.\u201d Both times, the juvenile court found, as state law required, that reasonable services had been offered or provided and that returning S.B. to her parents would create a substantial risk of detriment. (Welf. &amp; Inst. Code, \u00a7 366.21, subds. (e), (f).) Thus, it would appear that, if \u201cactive efforts\u201d and \u201cserious damage\u201d findings had been required, the juvenile court would have made them.</p>\n<p id=\"b1074-8\">Ill</p>\n<p id=\"b1074-9\">THE SUFFICIENCY OF THE EVIDENCE TO SUPPORT THE ICWA FINDINGS<footnotemark>*</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1075-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1167\">*1167</page-number>IV</p>\n<p id=\"b1075-5\">DISPOSITION</p>\n<p id=\"b1075-6\">The order appealed from is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b1075-7\">Ramirez, P.
