Barrera was in the backyard <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1205\">*1205</page-number>when she heard a man yell, \u201cF\u2014 you, guys. E.Y.C.\u201d<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Barrera ran to the front of her house where she saw codefendant Joseph Atilano Johnson get out of the front passenger seat of a car, jump into Morrell\u2019s pickup, and drive off. Defendant, who had been in the backseat of the car, climbed into the front passenger seat where Johnson had been sitting. Barrera recognized both defendant and Johnson because they had driven by her house in the same car a few hours earlier.</p>\n<p id=\"b1113-5\">Barrera got into her own car to try to find Johnson and the truck. Ten or 15 minutes after the truck had been taken, she spotted it near a convenience store about a mile and a half from her house. Barrera and her aunt, who was with her in the car, saw Johnson pushing the truck toward the gas pumps at the convenience store. Both women testified they saw defendant get out of the passenger seat of the truck and enter the convenience store.</p>\n<p id=\"b1113-6\">Barrera yelled out, \u201cThat\u2019s our truck.\u201d Johnson called defendant out of the convenience store, and the two men walked away. Barrera called 911. Johnson and defendant started running into a field at the back of the convenience store. After a search of the field, a deputy sheriff found defendant and Johnson at 7:45 or 8:00 p.m., lying on their stomachs and concealed by weeds.</p>\n<p id=\"b1113-7\">Deputy Sheriff Donovan Brooks arrested defendant and Johnson. At the jail, defendant asked Brooks why they had been arrested, and Brooks said it was for stealing a truck. Johnson stated that he had seen the truck rolling down the street with the keys in it, so he jumped in and took off in it. Brooks told them that because someone had yelled out, \u201cF\u2014 you, E.Y.C.,\u201d they were also facing a gang enhancement. Johnson said that defendant had not even been there when he, Johnson, had yelled out that remark.</p>\n<p id=\"b1113-8\">Riverside Sheriff\u2019s Officer Robert Kwan testified as a gang expert. Kwan described the structure of the different cliques within E.Y.C. as follows: \u201cThey have the P.WJL.\u2019s, which is the Pee-Wee Locos, the kids in the elementary school levels. They have the Tiny Winos, which is between 12 and 18 years old, which their acronym is T.W.S., and then they have the Nite Owls, which are the guys that are 18 and older.\u201d Kwan testified that E.Y.C. was primarily a Hispanic gang, although some of the members were White. The primary activities of E.Y.C. ranged \u201cfrom graffiti to robbery, to burglary, to attempt murder, up to murder\u201d as well as stealing cars.</p>\n<p id=\"b1113-9\">In Kwan\u2019s opinion, both defendant and Johnson were members of E.Y.C., and the crime was committed for the benefit of the E.Y.C. Kwan based his <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1206\">*1206</page-number>opinion that defendant was a member of the gang on Kwan\u2019s \u201ctraining and experience, reports written where he [was] a suspect, times [Kwan had] contacted him being in the presence of other gang members, when he was caught with Mr. Johnson; also with\u2014that day being caught with another gang member.\u201d Kwan testified that he had known defendant \u201cto admit to commit other crimes with other gang members.\u201d Specifically, Kwan referred to a 1992 robbery in which defendant and other gang members had stolen \u201csome bikes and hats off some kids.\u201d In February 2002, when searching a house for an E.Y.C. member who was an attempted murder suspect, Kwan found defendant hiding in a concealed basement. Moreover, Kwan had seen an incident report that indicated that defendant had been present at a knife fight or stabbing in 1995 involving another E.Y.C. member, although defendant had not been charged with any crime in connection with that incident.</p>\n<p id=\"b1114-4\">Defendant had numerous gang-related tattoos: \u201cHe\u2019s got \u2018Elsinore\u2019 on his neck, on his eyebrow; \u2018Y.C.\u2019 on his eyebrow; \u2018P.W.L.\u2019 on his head underneath his hair; \u2018Y.C.\u2019 on the back of his head. \u2018P.W.L.\u2019 on his arms; \u2018E.Y.C.\u2019 across his whole midsection and chest. Numerous other tattoos depicting \u2018South Side\u2019 or \u2018LE.\u2019; \u2018SUR,\u2019 S-U-R, \u2018Y.C.\u2019 on his hands.\u201d Defendant had the number \u201c13\u201d<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> tattooed on his arm; \u201cThug\u201d tattooed on his back; \u201cElsinore\u201d tattooed on his back, and another tattoo stating \u201cBrand.\u201d<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Another tattoo on his arm stated \u201c \u2018909\u2019 depicting . . . area code; that he\u2019s from the Inland Empire.\u201d He had \u201cBrown Pride\u201d on his arm. Defendant\u2019s head had been shaved when he was arrested so the tattoos on the back and side of his head were fully visible. In Kwan\u2019s opinion, that meant defendant was still active in the gang; otherwise, he would have grown his hair out to conceal the tattoos.</p>\n<p id=\"b1114-5\">Kwan testified that he had talked with other E.Y.C. members about defendant, and they had told him that defendant was a member of E.Y.C. and that defendant\u2019s moniker was \u201cLittle Casper\u201d or \u201cVillain.\u201d Kwan had also talked with members of rival gangs about defendant\u2019s membership in E.Y.C.</p>\n<p id=\"b1114-6\">In Kwan\u2019s opinion, based on his training and experience, the current crimes were committed for the benefit of E.Y.C. because the crimes caused fear and intimidation on rival gang members. A week before the pickup was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1207\">*1207</page-number>taken, the graffito \u201cGrizzly\u201d had appeared on the fence next door to Barrera\u2019s house; \u201cGrizzly\u201d was Johnson\u2019s gang moniker.</p>\n<p id=\"b1115-5\">On cross-examination, Kwan conceded that defendant did not appear in the photographs of E.Y.C. gang members that were introduced into evidence. Moreover, Kwan was not aware of any recent crimes defendant had committed, although he knew that defendant had committed crimes 11 and nine years ago and had had a seven-year prison term.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Kwan testified that defendant was about 30 years old, and E.Y.C. was \u201cpredominantly geared towards younger age groups.\u201d Kwan testified on cross-examination that much of his expertise concerning Elsinore gangs had been provided by other Elsinore officers and deputies as well as by speaking with E.Y.C. gang members.</p>\n<p id=\"b1115-6\">Kwan described conversations with gang members concerning defendant: \u201c[J]ust a lot of consensual conversation, you know. We just started talking and names get thrown out on who\u2019s who and monikers and\u2014.\u201d Kwan testified that he had not documented those conversations. The only record he had in his file concerning defendant was about the February 2002 contact when defendant was found hiding in a concealed basement. Kwan did not have any field identification cards for defendant. There was no record that defendant had bragged about committing any crimes. Defendant had not been charged with any gang enhancement in connection with the prior robbery.</p>\n<p id=\"b1115-7\">The jury found defendant guilty of receiving stolen property in count 2 (Pen. Code, \u00a7 496, subd. (a); all further statutory references are to the Penal Code unless otherwise specified) and of active participation in a criminal street gang (\u00a7 186.22, subd. (a)); however, the jury found him not guilty of vehicle theft in count l.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> In bifurcated proceedings, the jury found true the allegations that defendant had suffered a prior prison term (\u00a7 667.5, subd. (c)(5)); two prior serious convictions (\u00a7 667, subd. (a)) and three strike priors (\u00a7\u00a7 667, subds. (c), (e), 1170.12, subd. (c)(2)(A)).</p>\n<p id=\"b1115-8\">The trial court exercised its discretion to strike two of defendant\u2019s strike priors with respect to count 2 and sentenced defendant on count 2 to the aggravated term of six years as a second strike. However, the trial court refused to strike any of the priors with respect to count 3 and sentenced defendant to a concurrent term of 25 years to fife plus an additional and consecutive five-year term for each of the two serious felony priors for a total sentence of 35 years to life.</p>\n<p id=\"b1116-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1208\">*1208</page-number>DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b1116-3\">A., B. <footnotemark>*</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1116-6\">C. <em>Admission of Hearsay Evidence of Gang Membership</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1116-7\">Citing <em>Crawford v. Washington </em>(2004) 541 U.S. 36 [158 L.Ed.2d 177, 124 S.Ct. 1354] <em>(Crawford), </em>defendant contends that his right to confront witnesses was violated by the admission of hearsay evidence in the form of the gang expert\u2019s conversations with other gang members in which they identified defendant as a gang member. Deputy Kwan testified that he learned through casual, undocumented conversations with other gang members that defendant was a member of E.Y.C., and his gang moniker was \u201cLittle Casper\u201d or \u201cVillain.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1116-8\">1. <em>Waiver</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1116-9\">The People contend that defendant waived the issue by failing to raise an objection in the trial court on the basis now urged on appeal. However, because <em>Crawford </em>was decided after the trial in this case, we conclude that the failure to object was excusable. <em>(People </em>v. <em>Johnson </em>(2004) 121 Cal.App.4th 1409, 1411, fn. 2 [18 Cal.Rptr.3d 230].) We will therefore address the issue on the merits.</p>\n<p id=\"b1116-10\">2. <em>Analysis</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1116-11\">In all criminal prosecutions, the accused has a right, guaranteed by the Sixth and Fourteenth Amendments to the United States Constitution, \u201cto be confronted with the witnesses against him . . . .\u201d (U.S. Const., Amend. 6; <em>Pointer v. Texas </em>(1965) 380 U.S. 400 [13 L.Ed.2d 923, 85 S.Ct. 1065].) The central concern of the Sixth Amendment\u2019s confrontation clause is \u201cto ensure the reliability of the evidence against a criminal defendant by subjecting it to rigorous testing in the context of an adversary proceeding before the trier of fact.\u201d <em>(Maryland v. Craig </em>(1990) 497 U.S. 836, 845 [111 L.Ed.2d 666, 110 S.Ct. 3157].)</p>\n<p id=\"b1116-12\">In <em>Crawford, </em>the Supreme Court held that out-of-court statements that are testimonial in nature are inadmissible unless the declarant is unavailable and the accused has had a prior opportunity to cross-examine the declarant. In <em>Crawford, </em>therefore, the court held that a wife\u2019s out-of-court statement to an <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1209\">*1209</page-number>officer during a custodial interrogation about a knife fight, in which both the husband and wife were suspects, could not be used against the husband in his trial for attempted murder. <em>(Crawford, supra, </em>541 U.S. 36 at pp. 68-69 [158 L.Ed.2d 177, 124 S.Ct. 1354].)</p>\n<p id=\"b1117-5\">The <em>Crawford </em>court stated, however, that \u201c[w]here nontestimonial hearsay is at issue, it is wholly consistent with the Framers\u2019 design to afford the States flexibility in their development of hearsay law\u2014as does <em>[Ohio </em>v.] <em>Roberts </em>[(1980) 448 U.S. 56 [65 L.Ed.2d 597, 100 S.Ct. 2531]], and as would an approach that exempted such statements from Confrontation Clause scrutiny altogether .... We leave for another day any effort to spell out a comprehensive definition of \u2018testimonial.\u2019 \u201d <em>(Crawford, supra, </em>541 U.S. at p. 68 [124 S.Ct. 1354, 1374], fn. omitted].) The court nonetheless provided illustrations of statements that could be considered testimonial: (1) \u201c <em>'ex parte </em>in-court testimony or its functional equivalent\u2014that is, material such as affidavits, custodial examinations, prior testimony that the defendant was unable to cross-examine, or similar pretrial statements that declarants would reasonably expect to be used prosecutorially,\u2019 \u201d and (2) \u201c \u2018statements . . . made under circumstances which would lead an objective witness reasonably to believe that the statement would be available for use at a later trial.\u2019 \u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 52 [124 S.Ct. at p. 1364].)</p>\n<p id=\"b1117-6\">Few published California cases have yet addressed the scope of <em>Crawford\u2019s </em>limitation on the use of hearsay evidence,<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> and none of those cases has analyzed the use of hearsay as the basis for an expert witness\u2019s opinion. Defendant argues, however, that the statements on which Kwan relied were testimonial, and therefore inadmissible, because when the officer inquired about gang membership, he \u201cwas obviously gathering information which he intended to use and in fact did use in at least one criminal prosecution that being the instant case.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1117-7\">The rule is long established in California that experts may testify as to their opinions on relevant matters and, if questioned, may relate the information and sources on which they relied in forming those opinions. Such sources may include hearsay. (See <em>People v. Gardeley </em>(1996) 14 Cal.4th 605, 618-619 [59 Cal.Rptr.2d 356, 927 P.2d 713]; Evid. Code, \u00a7 801, subd. (b) [an expert\u2019s opinion may be based on matter \u201cwhether or not admissible, that is</p>\n<p id=\"AXY\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1210\">*1210</page-number>of a type that reasonably may be relied upon by an expert in forming an opinion upon the subject to which his testimony relates\u201d].) In <em>People </em>v. <em>Vy </em>(2004) 122 Cal.App.4th 1209, 1223, footnote 10 [19 Cal.Rptr.3d 402], the court stated, \u201cOf course, because the culture and habits of gangs are matters which are \u2018sufficiently beyond common experience that the opinion of an expert would assist the trier of fact\u2019 (Evid. Code, \u00a7 801, subd. (a)), opinion testimony from a gang expert, subject to the limitations applicable to expert testimony generally, is proper. [Citation.] Such an expert\u2014like other experts\u2014may give opinion testimony that is based upon hearsay, including conversations with gang members as well as with the defendant. [Citations.] Such opinions may also be based upon the expert\u2019s personal investigation of past crimes by gang members and information about gangs learned from the expert\u2019s colleagues or from other law enforcement agencies. [Citations.]\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1118-4\"><em>Crawford </em>does not undermine the established rule that experts can testify to their opinions on relevant matters, and relate the information and sources upon which they rely in forming those opinions. This is so because an expert is subject to cross-examination about his or her opinions and additionally, the materials on which the expert bases his or her opinion are not elicited for the truth of their contents; they are examined to assess the weight of the expert\u2019s opinion. <em>Crawford </em>itself states that the confrontation clause \u201cdoes not bar the use of testimonial statements for purposes other than establishing the truth of the matter asserted.\u201d <em>(Crawford, supra, </em>541 U.S. at p. 59 [124 S.Ct. at p. 1369, fn. 9], citing <em>Tennessee </em>v. <em>Street </em>(1985) 471 U.S. 409, 414 [85 L.Ed.2d 425, 105 S.Ct. 2078].)</p>\n<p id=\"b1118-5\">Here, the conversations with other gang members were mentioned only as a basis for Kwan\u2019s opinion that defendant was a gang member. There was no Sixth Amendment violation based on Kwan\u2019s reliance on hearsay matters.</p>\n<p id=\"b1118-6\">Moreover, although no published California case has yet addressed whether <em>Crawford </em>applies to hearsay statements that are used not as direct evidence against the defendant but merely as the basis for an expert\u2019s opinion, courts in other jurisdictions have held upheld such use. (See <em>People v. Goldstein </em>(2004) 14 A.D.3d 32, 38 [786 N.Y.S.2d 428, 432]; <em>Howard </em>v. <em>Walker </em>(W.D.N.Y., July 21, 2004, No. 98-CV-6427FE) 2004 WL 1638197, 2004 U.S. Dist. Lexis 14425; <em>United States v. Stone </em>(E.D.Tenn., 2004) 222 F.R.D. 334.)</p>\n<p id=\"b1118-7\">Thus, because the statements were not offered to establish the truth of the matter asserted, but merely as one of the bases for an expert witness\u2019s opinion, the confrontation clause, as interpreted in <em>Crawford, </em>does not apply. There was no error in the use of the hearsay statements.</p>\n<p id=\"b1119-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1211\">*1211</page-number>D. <em>Conviction of Section 186.22, Subdivision (a) as a Serious Felony</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1119-5\">DISPOSITION</p>\n<p id=\"b1119-6\">The judgment is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b1119-7\">Ramirez, P.
