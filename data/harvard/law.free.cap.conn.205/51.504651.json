The trial court rendered judgment for the plaintiff in the sum of $9098.32, the amount of the tax and interest thereon that the plaintiff had paid.</p>\n<p id=\"b68-6\">In his appeal from the judgment, the defendant claims error in the court\u2019s conclusions: (1) that \u00a7 12-458 imposes the tax on the purchaser as the primary obligor; (2) that the plaintiff could recover the tax by way of subrogation; and (3) that the plaintiff was also equitably entitled to recover the amount of taxes it had been compelled to pay \u201cfor which another is legally or equitably bound.\u201d<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b68-7\">The parties presented a written stipulation to the court containing the relevant facts and no additional evidence was introduced. The plaintiff is a distributor of fuel and oil products in Connecticut. The defendant operates various businesses located on Huntington Avenue, Waterbury, in which machinery and equipment are used. Between October, 1983, and June, 1985, the plaintiff sold motor vehicle fuel to the defendant, who paid the plaintiff for the amounts billed as the fuel was delivered. During that period the plaintiff was unaware of its statutory responsibility to collect the tax upon each sale as it was made.</p>\n<p id=\"b68-8\">The state, after auditing the plaintiff\u2019s accounts, assessed a deficiency of $9098.32 in taxes and interest relating to the defendant\u2019s account. The plaintiff paid this sum to the state. Its request for reimbursement has been refused by the defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b68-9\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b68-10\">The defendant claims that, as the purchaser, he is not the primary obligor for the tax imposed by \u00a7 12-458 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"55\">*55</page-number>upon motor vehicle fuel, because \u201cthe fuel tax is not a user tax, but is a tax on the distributor.\u201d The statutory language imposing the tax, however, is that \u201ceach distributor <em>shall pay </em>to the commissioner <em>for the account of the purchaser or consumer </em>a tax on each gallon of such fuels sold or used in this state . . . .\u201d (Emphasis added.) Another provision of the statute requires the distributor to \u201cfurnish to the purchaser an invoice showing . . . the amount of tax <em>to be paid </em>by the distributor <em>for the account of the purchaser or consumer.\u201d </em>(Emphasis added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b69-6\">This court has previously construed the provision under which the tax is paid by the distributor \u201cfor the account of the purchaser or consumer\u201d to indicate that \u201cthe intent of the legislature was to impose an excise tax upon persons using the highways for the purpose of propelling motor vehicles upon them.\u201d <em>Anastasio </em>v. <em>Gulf Oil Corporation, </em>131 Conn. 708, 716, 42 A.2d 149 (1945). \u201c[W]hile the tax was to be paid by [the distributors] it was in fact one imposed upon those who used the gasoline for that purpose; and the distributors were in effect agents of the state in collecting it.\u201d <em>Carroll </em>v. <em>Socony-Vacuum Oil Co., </em>136 Conn. 49, 53, 68 A.2d 299 (1949). \u201cUnder Connecticut law the wholesaler is the collecting and remitting agency .... He pays \u2018for the account of the purchaser.\u2019 \u201d <em>Ciarleglio </em>v. <em>Benedict &amp; Co., </em>127 Conn. 291, 293, 16 A.2d 593 (1940); see <em>Spencer </em>v. <em>Consumers Oil Co., </em>115 Conn. 554, 559,162 A.2d 23 (1932). Statutes of other states taxing fuel used in motor vehicles have been construed similarly to impose an excise tax upon those using motor vehicles on public highways. <em>Monamotor Oil Co. </em>v. <em>Johnson, </em>292 U.S. 86, 93, 54 S. Ct. 575, 78 L. Ed. 1141 (1934); <em>Commonwealths. Wallace, </em>294 Mass. 31, 34, 200 N.E. 406 (1936).</p>\n<p id=\"b69-7\">We conclude that the plain intent of the legislature was to impose the burden of the tax upon the motor <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"56\">*56</page-number>vehicle fuel purchaser or user, and to make the distributor responsible only for its collection and payment.</p>\n<p id=\"b70-6\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b70-7\">We shall consider together the defendant\u2019s second and third claims, that the doctrine of subrogation is inapplicable and that the plaintiff was not equitably entitled to recover the taxes it had paid.</p>\n<p id=\"b70-8\">As the trial court noted, there is no statutory provision expressly authorizing a distributor to recover from a motor vehicle fuel purchaser the tax due upon the sale. The requirement of General Statutes \u00a7 12-457 that the distributor include in his invoice to the purchaser a written statement indicating \u201cwhether or not the required state tax has been charged thereon\u201d implies that a distributor may absorb the tax if the invoice so discloses. By contrast, our sales and use tax imposed on retailers provides that \u201c[reimbursement for the tax . . . shall be collected by the retailer from the consumer . . . [and] shall be paid by the consumer to the retailer. . . and that \u201c[s]uch tax shall be a debt from the consumer to the retailer, when so added to the original sales price, and shall be recoverable at law in the same manner as other debts . . . .\u201d General Statutes \u00a7 12-408 (2).</p>\n<p id=\"b70-9\">We are not persuaded that the absence of an express statutory provision for reimbursement of the motor vehicle fuel tax forecloses the distributor from resorting to appropriate equitable remedies where he has been legally compelled to pay a tax the incidence of which the legislature intended to impose upon the purchaser. \u201cWhere property of one person is used in discharging an obligation owed by another . . . under such circumstances that the other would be unjustly enriched by the retention of the benefit thus conferred, the former is entitled to be subrogated to the position of the obligee . . . .\u201d Restatement, Restitution \u00a7 162. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"57\">*57</page-number>This doctrine is inapplicable where the payment has been made \u201cofficiously,\u201d i.e., where the circumstances do not justify the interference with another\u2019s affairs resulting from conferring a benefit upon him. Restatement, supra, \u00a7 2. A person does not act officiously when he pays another\u2019s debt under a mistake or when he has discharged an obligation for which he is also liable, but which another should equitably have paid. Restatement, supra, \u00a7 162, comment b; see Restatement, supra, \u00a7\u00a7 43, 76.</p>\n<p id=\"b71-6\">The payment of taxes by one not primarily responsible therefor is a situation where subrogation has been permitted. 73 Am. Jur. 2d, Subrogation \u00a7 66. In <em>Hart </em>v. <em>Tiernan, </em>59 Conn. 521, 21 A. 1007 (1890), this court allowed a tax collector, who was statutorily liable to the town for municipal taxes for which tax liens had been filed and who had accordingly paid the taxes due, to be subrogated to the rights of the municipality under those liens. In a similar case we declared: \u201cThat he had all the rights under the lien that could be asserted by the city is true.\u201d <em>Cole </em>v. <em>Rice, </em>74 Conn. 680, 683, 51 A. 1083 (1902). These cases, however, \u201carose under the peculiar provisions of the charter of the city of Waterbury\u201d that were construed to provide to the tax collector who had paid the taxes not only the right to reimbursement from the delinquent taxpayer but also \u201call the securities and remedies against the delinquents held by the community . . . .\u201d <em>Sperry </em>v. <em>Butler, </em>75 Conn. 369, 374, 53 A. 899 (1903). \u201cWhen the case is one of subrogation of the individual to public rights and remedies, the situation assumes an aspect not presented where the substitution relates to private rights. Questions of public policy, questions as to the propriety of turning over the governmental machinery to individuals and conferring upon them the powers of the organized public, at once arise.\u201d Id., 373. Thus, subrogation to a governmental claim for taxes does not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"58\">*58</page-number>necessarily make available all of the remedies created for the benefit of the government in collecting taxes; id., 373-74; or give a private individual seeking indemnification for payment of such taxes the preferential status accorded to tax claims asserted by the government. <em>In re Page Express, Inc., </em>220 F. Sup. 14,18-19 (D. Conn. 1963).</p>\n<p id=\"b72-6\">The plaintiff distributor in this case does not, by virtue of its payment of the motor vehicle fuel tax, assert any special status or privilege that the state might have relied upon in collecting the tax or claiming priority over other creditors. See General Statutes \u00a7\u00a7 12-458e, 12-461a, 12-461b, 12-461c, 12-475. This is an ordinary civil action for debt based upon the undisputed circumstance that the plaintiff has been compelled to pay a tax that it mistakenly failed to include in its invoice to the defendant. The essential question is whether it is equitable to order reimbursement from the purchaser on whom we have concluded the burden of the tax was intended to fall. In similar situations in other jurisdictions recovery has been allowed. <em>Brandtjen &amp; Kluge </em>v. <em>Fincher, </em>44 Cal. App. 2d 939, 111 P.2d 979 (1941) (retailer against whom state assessed an uncollected use tax entitled to recover amount paid from purchaser deemed to be primarily liable); <em>Drake </em>v. <em>Thayer Manufacturing Corporation, </em>105 Ga. App. 20, 123 S.E.2d 457 (1961) (seller not estopped from recovering amount paid for uncollected use tax from purchaser claiming to have relied upon misrepresentation of seller as to taxability of sale); <em>American Cast Iron Pipe Co. </em>v. <em>Volentine, </em>191 So. 2d 661 (La. App. 1966) (payment of uncollected sales tax by seller created a debt owed by the purchaser); <em>Howitt </em>v. <em>Street &amp; Smith Publications, Inc., </em>251 App. Div. 461, 462, 297 N.Y.S. 3 (1937) (reimbursement allowed for uncollected sales tax paid by seller \u201cprimarily liable for the payment of it to the city\u201d acting as agent for the city in its collec<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"59\">*59</page-number>tion); <em>Reaves &amp; Becker Co. </em>v. <em>Wilkes Co., </em>392 S.W.2d 379, 381 (Tex. Civ. App. 1965) (seller\u2019s action to recover previously unbilled sales tax from purchaser not barred because of its \u201cmistake of law\u201d); <em>Morrison-Knudsen Co. </em>v. <em>Department of Revenue, </em>6 Wash. App. 306, 311-12, 493 P.2d 802 (1972) (where statute imposes on seller \u201cduty to collect and remit the tax\u201d and on buyer \u201cthe duty to pay the tax,\u201d buyer is ultimately responsible for previously unbilled tax, which constitutes a debt owed to seller). These cases employ different theories to allow recovery, and some rely on statutory provisions that preclude absorption of the tax by the seller. Once it has been determined, however, that the incidence of the tax was intended to fall upon the purchaser and that the liability imposed on the seller was intended as a device to enforce his responsibility to collect the tax, the purchaser has been required to reimburse the seller despite his error in failing to include the tax in his original invoice or estimate.</p>\n<p id=\"b73-6\">We conclude that, based upon the stipulated facts in this case, the plaintiff was entitled to recover under the principle that it has been legally compelled to pay an obligation for which primary liability is imposed by \u00a7 12-458 on the defendant purchaser, who \u201cwould be unjustly enriched by the retention of the benefit thus conferred.\u201d Restatement, supra, \u00a7 162. There are no circumstances presented by the stipulation that militate against application of this equitable doctrine. The plaintiff has not acted \u201cofficiously,\u201d but has been compelled to pay the tax to the state in order to protect its own interests. Restatement, supra, \u00a7 2, comment (a). No priority has been sought over other creditors, such as the state might have asserted in pursuing a claim for the delinquent taxes against the defendant. See <em>Sperry </em>v. <em>Butler, </em>supra, 373. The fact that the plaintiff had mistakenly assumed the sale was not taxable does not preclude resort to the equitable remedy of subrogation. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"60\">*60</page-number>Restatement, supra, \u00a7 43. Neither the pleadings nor the stipulation indicate that the defendant has suffered any loss or prejudice resulting from the failure to include the tax in the invoice submitted at the time of the sale.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> No claim has been raised of an agreement by the plaintiff to absorb the tax. We agree with the trial court that the plaintiff was entitled to recover from the defendant the amount of the assessment for the motor vehicle fuel tax that it paid to the state.</p>\n<p id=\"b74-6\">The judgment rendered by the trial court in the sum of $9098.32 included $1605.69 of interest that the plaintiff had paid to the state because of its failure to pay the tax on the sale to the defendant when due. Although no separate issue concerning this portion of the judgment had been raised until inquiry by this court during oral argument, in responding the plaintiff conceded that it was erroneous for the trial court to have included in the judgment the interest resulting from its delay in paying the tax. Accordingly, the judgment should be revised, by eliminating the interest component, to reflect an award of only the amount of the tax paid to the state, $7492.63.</p>\n<p id=\"b74-7\">There is error only in the amount of the judgment, the judgment is set aside and the case is remanded with direction to correct the judgment in accordance with this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b74-8\">In this opinion the other justices concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b66-14\">\"[General Statutes] Sec. 12-458. returns, rate and payment of tax. exemptions.
